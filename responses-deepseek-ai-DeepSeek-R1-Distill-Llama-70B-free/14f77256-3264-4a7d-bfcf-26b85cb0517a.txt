Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about research designs, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says a researcher is looking into how parent alcoholism affects child and family development. They recruited 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, and 14-year-olds, each group having 100 participants. Half have an alcoholic parent, and half don't. The study is multiple-year and longitudinal, assessing various outcomes. The options are from A to J, each a different study design.

Hmm, I remember that research designs can be a bit tricky. So let me think about each option and see which fits.

Option A: Cross-sectional design. Cross-sectional studies take data from different groups at a single point in time. For example, comparing 12, 13, 14-year-olds all at the same time. But wait, the question says it's a multiple-year study. So maybe it's not cross-sectional because that's usually done once, not over years. Unless it's cross-sectional with different cohorts each year? Not sure yet.

Option B: Correlational study. That's when you look for relationships between variables, but it doesn't imply causation. The study here has two groups: with and without alcoholic parents, so maybe it's correlational. But I think the main point here is the study design structure, not just the method of analysis.

Option C: Pretest-posttest design. That's typically an experiment where you measure before and after a treatment. But this study doesn't mention any intervention, so probably not C.

Option D: Cross-sequential cohort design. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think cross-sequential involves multiple cohorts measured at different times, maybe to study age effects. Like, for example, measuring 12, 13, 14-year-olds each year over a few years. But wait, the question says it's a longitudinal study. So maybe not D because cross-sequential might be a type of longitudinal design?

Option E: Quasi-experiment. That's when you have an independent variable (like alcoholic parent vs not) but it's not randomly assigned. Since the researcher is comparing groups where the condition is pre-existing (alcoholic parent), it's a quasi-experiment. But the question is about the study design, not the type of experiment.

Option F: Natural experiment. This occurs when the independent variable is present in a real-world setting without researcher intervention. Like a flood causing a change, so you study before and after. But the setup here doesn't describe an event like that. It's more about group differences over time.

Option G: Cross-sectional cohort design. Wait, I'm not sure about this one. Maybe it's a mix of cross-sectional and cohort? Or perhaps it's when you have different cohorts measured at different times, but each time it's a cross-section.

Option H: True experiment. That involves random assignment to groups and control over variables. Here, the groups are based on existing conditions, not random assignment. So H is not correct.

Option I: Case-control study. This usually involves looking back in time, comparing people with a condition (cases) to those without (controls). For example, if you have an outcome and look for past exposures. But this study is longitudinal, looking forward, so probably not I.

Option J: Longitudinal cohort design. Longitudinal means you study the same group over time. Cohort design follows a group with shared characteristics (like age) over time. But wait, the study has three different age groups—12, 13, 14. Each group is a different cohort, right? So if they're each being followed over time, it's a bit more than a single cohort.

Wait, so the key here is that the study is multiple-year and longitudinal. The researcher is recruiting three different age groups and following them over time. So each group is a cohort. So it's a longitudinal design with multiple cohorts. But what's the term for that?

Alternatively, cross-sequential design (option D) involves studying different age cohorts at different times. So for example, in year 1, you have 12, 13, 14-year-olds. Then in year 2, they become 13,14,15. So you can look at how age affects the variables. But the question doesn't say they're being measured each year across the age groups. It's a bit unclear.

Wait, the study is multiple-year, assessing various outcomes, but the setup is recruiting each age group once. So each participant is in one cohort (12, 13, 14) and followed over time. So each group is a separate longitudinal study. But that would be multiple longitudinal cohorts. But the term for that might be a cross-sequential or cross-sectional.

Alternatively, the question says it's a longitudinal study. So the primary design is longitudinal, but the fact that they have different age groups suggests that it's a cohort design, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in a longitudinal cohort design (option J), you have a single cohort that you follow over time. But here, there are three different age cohorts. So perhaps it's a cross-sequential design because you have multiple cohorts measured across different time points.

Hmm. So cross-sequential (D) is when you have different cohorts (like different birth years) and you assess them at different times. So you can see both age effects and changes over time.

Wait, but the study is a multiple-year longitudinal. So each group is followed over time. So, the 12-year-olds are followed for perhaps 2-3 years, becoming 14. The 13-year-olds for maybe 1-2 years, etc. So each group is a longitudinal study on their own. But the researcher is looking across the groups to see how the outcomes change with age and over time.

That sounds like a cross-sequential design because it's combining cross-sectional (different ages) and longitudinal (each group's data over time) elements.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between options D and J. Option J is a longitudinal cohort design, which is a single cohort followed over time. Option D is cross-sequential, which includes multiple cohorts.

So in this case, since the researcher has recruited three different age groups (cohorts) and is following each over multiple years, it's a cross-sequential design. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but another angle: the fact that it's a multiple-year study. Each group is being followed over time, making it longitudinal. So each cohort is a longitudinal study. But the presence of multiple cohorts makes it a cross-sequential.

Alternatively, another approach: the study's main aim is to examine the potential impact over time. So the researcher is tracking changes as the children get older. By having different starting ages, they can look at the same developmental stages across different groups, which might control for some variables.

So, putting it all together, the design is cross-sequential because it includes multiple cohorts (ages) and follows each over time.

Wait, but another thought: cross-sectional design (A) is when you have different age groups at a single point. But this is over multiple years. So cross-sectional cohort design (G) might not be right either.

Hmm, perhaps the correct term is cross-sequential. Because cross-sequential is a combination of longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches. So the answer would be D.

Alternatively, maybe it's just a longitudinal design with multiple cohorts, which would be J? But J says longitudinal cohort, which I thought was for a single cohort.

Wait, perhaps the correct term for the overall study is a longitudinal design, but since they have multiple age groups, it's a type of longitudinal approach.

Wait, another thought: the question says it's a multiple-year longitudinal study, so the primary design is longitudinal. The fact that they have different age groups is part of the sampling strategy, but the design is still longitudinal. So maybe the correct choice is J: longitudinal cohort design.

Wait, but each age group is its own cohort. So the study includes three different longitudinal cohorts. So the design would involve multiple cohorts, but without a cross-sequential approach, perhaps it's just a series of longitudinal studies. But I'm not sure if that's a standard term.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall definitions.

Cross-sectional: Data collected at one point in time from different groups.

Longitudinal: Data collected from the same group over multiple time points.

Cohort study: A type of longitudinal study where a group (cohort) is followed over time.

Cross-sequential design: Involves multiple cohorts, each of which is studied longitudinally, allowing the researcher to examine both age and time effects.

So in cross-sequential, you have, say, three age groups (cohorts) each measured at multiple time points. So you can look at changes over time within each cohort and also compare across cohorts.

So in this case, the researcher has three age groups, each followed over multiple years. So it's a cross-sequential design, which is option D.

Wait, but the question says the study is a multiple-year longitudinal study. So is cross-sequential a type of longitudinal design?

Yes, I think cross-sequential is a type of longitudinal design that includes multiple cohorts to examine developmental trends.

So the correct answer would be D: A cross-sequential cohort design.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option D is "A cross-sequential cohort design"

Option J is "A longitudinal cohort design"

So, the key difference is that J is a single cohort followed over time, while D uses multiple cohorts to look at different ages and time periods.

In the scenario, the researcher has three different age groups, each being followed over time. Therefore, it's a cross-sequential design, which uses multiple cohorts.

So the answer should be D.

The question involves a study examining the impact of parent alcoholism on child and family development. The researcher recruits 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, and 14-year-olds, with half of each group having an alcoholic parent and the other half not. The study is described as a multiple-year longitudinal design assessing various outcomes. The task is to identify the most appropriate characterization of this study from the given options.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Cross-sectional design**  
   Cross-sectional studies involve data collection from different groups at a single point in time. However, this study is explicitly described as multiple-year and longitudinal, meaning it involves repeated measurements over time. Thus, this option does not fit.

2. **Option B: Correlational study**  
   While the study may involve correlations between variables (e.g., parent alcoholism and child outcomes), this term primarily describes a method of analysis rather than the overall study design. The question focuses on the design, so this is not the best choice.

3. **Option C: Pretest-posttest design**  
   This design typically involves measuring outcomes before and after an intervention or treatment. Since the study does not mention any intervention, this option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: Cross-sequential cohort design**  
   A cross-sequential design combines longitudinal and cross-sectional elements by studying multiple cohorts (e.g., different age groups) at different time points. This allows researchers to examine both developmental changes over time and age-related differences. In this study, the researcher recruits three age groups (12-, 13-, and 14-year-olds) and follows them over multiple years. This matches the definition of a cross-sequential cohort design, making this a strong candidate.

5. **Option E: Quasi-experiment**  
   A quasi-experiment involves comparing groups with pre-existing conditions (e.g., alcoholic vs. non-alcoholic parents) without random assignment. While the study compares such groups, the question focuses on the overall design, not just the type of experiment. Thus, this is not the best choice.

6. **Option F: Natural experiment**  
   Natural experiments occur when the independent variable is present in a real-world setting without researcher intervention, often due to an event (e.g., a disaster). This study does not describe such a scenario, so this option is incorrect.

7. **Option G: Cross-sectional cohort design**  
   This term is not standard in research design terminology. The study is longitudinal, not cross-sectional, so this option does not fit.

8. **Option H: True experiment**  
   A true experiment involves random assignment to groups and control over variables. Since the groups in this study are based on pre-existing conditions (alcoholic vs. non-alcoholic parents), this is not a true experiment.

9. **Option I: Case-control study**  
   Case-control studies involve comparing individuals with a specific outcome (cases) to those without (controls), often retrospectively. This study is longitudinal and forward-looking, so this option does not apply.

10. **Option J: Longitudinal cohort design**  
    A longitudinal cohort design follows a single cohort over time. While this study is longitudinal, it involves three different age groups (cohorts), making it more complex than a single-cohort longitudinal design. Thus, this option does not fully capture the study's structure.

### Conclusion:
The study recruits three age groups (cohorts) and follows them over multiple years, combining longitudinal and cross-sectional elements. This structure aligns with the definition of a cross-sequential cohort design, which allows researchers to examine developmental changes over time and age-related differences. Therefore, the best characterization of the study is **Option D: A cross-sequential cohort design**.
