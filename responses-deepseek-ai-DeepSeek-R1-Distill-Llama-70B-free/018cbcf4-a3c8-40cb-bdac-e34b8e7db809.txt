Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a boatman crossing a canal. Hmm, I need to find out how long the trip will take. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the canal is 3 km wide. The boatman wants to land at a point that's 2 km upstream from where he started. The current's speed is 3.5 km/h, and the boat's speed is 13 km/h. So, the boat's speed is relative to the water, and the water itself is moving due to the current. I remember that in such problems, you have to consider the boat's velocity relative to the ground, which is the combination of its velocity relative to the water and the water's velocity relative to the ground.

Wait, the key here is that he wants to land upstream. So he must aim his boat at an angle upstream to counteract the current. Otherwise, the current would carry him downstream. 

Let me visualize this. The canal is 3 km wide, so the shortest distance across is 3 km. But he doesn't want to land directly across; he wants to end up 2 km upstream. So the resultant displacement vector has two components: across the canal (3 km) and upstream (2 km). 

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the resultant displacement is the vector from the starting point to the landing point. So the straight-line distance he travels relative to the ground isn't simply the hypotenuse of 3 and 2. Because his actual path is determined by his velocity relative to the water and the time taken, which is influenced by the current.

Alternatively, perhaps I should break his velocity into components. Let me think in terms of vectors. The boat's velocity relative to the ground is the vector sum of the boat's velocity relative to the water and the water's velocity relative to the ground.

The water is moving at 3.5 km/h downstream. So the boatman needs to point upstream to counteract this. Let me model this with vectors.

Let me denote:
- Boat speed (relative to water) = v_b = 13 km/h.
- Current speed (water relative to ground) = v_c = 3.5 km/h downstream.

He wants his resultant velocity relative to the ground to have two components: one across the canal (let's say the y-direction) and one upstream (negative x-direction, since upstream is against the current). Wait, but maybe it's better to set up a coordinate system where x is upstream-downstream, and y is across the canal.

Wait, no, perhaps better to model it this way: The boat is trying to reach a point that's 3 km across (let's say in the y-direction) and 2 km upstream (so in the x-direction, but negative if downstream is positive). So the displacement vector is (2 km upstream, 3 km across). Or wait, no, because upstream is opposite to the current's direction. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting point is on the south bank, and he wants to land 2 km upstream (north) on the north bank. So the displacement in the x-direction (along the canal) is +2 km (assuming x is upstream positive), and the displacement in the y-direction (across the canal) is 3 km.

But the water is flowing downstream, which would be the negative x-direction. So the current's velocity is v_c = -3.5 km/h in x, and 0 in y.

The boat's velocity relative to water is v_b, which can be directed at an angle θ upstream from the y-axis (directly across). So the boat's velocity relative to water has components: v_bx = v_b * sinθ (upstream, positive x), and v_by = v_b * cosθ (across, positive y).

Then the boat's velocity relative to ground is the sum of v_b (relative to water) and the current's velocity. So:

v_ground_x = v_bx + v_current_x = v_b sinθ + (-3.5)
v_ground_y = v_by + v_current_y = v_b cosθ + 0 = v_b cosθ

We want the resultant velocity to take him to the point (2 km upstream, 3 km across). So the displacement in x is +2 km, and displacement in y is +3 km.

The time taken for the trip is the same for both x and y directions. So the time t = displacement / velocity component.

So in the y-direction: t = 3 km / (v_b cosθ)
In the x-direction: t = 2 km / (v_b sinθ - 3.5)

Since both times are equal, we can set them equal:

3/(v_b cosθ) = 2/(v_b sinθ - 3.5)

Now, substituting v_b =13 km/h,

3/(13 cosθ) = 2/(13 sinθ - 3.5)

Hmm, solving for θ. Let me cross-multiply:

3*(13 sinθ -3.5) = 2*(13 cosθ)

39 sinθ - 10.5 = 26 cosθ

Hmm, this looks a bit tricky. How do I solve for theta here? Let's see, perhaps square both sides after rearranging.

But perhaps let's rearrange terms:

39 sinθ - 26 cosθ = 10.5

Hmm, this is of the form A sinθ + B cosθ = C. So perhaps I can write this as R sin(θ + φ) = C or something like that.

Wait, but the coefficients are 39 and -26. So let me compute R:

R = sqrt(39² + (-26)^2) = sqrt(1521 + 676) = sqrt(2197) ≈ 46.872

Then, 39 sinθ -26 cosθ = R sin(theta - phi), where phi is such that cos phi = 39/R and sin phi = 26/R. Wait, wait, because the formula is A sinθ + B cosθ = R sin(theta + phi), but with a negative sign here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express it as:

39 sinθ -26 cosθ = 10.5

Divide both sides by R:

(39/R) sinθ - (26/R) cosθ = 10.5/R

Let me compute 39/R: 39 / 46.872 ≈ 0.832

26/R: 26 / 46.872 ≈ 0.5547

So, 0.832 sinθ - 0.5547 cosθ = 10.5 /46.872 ≈ 0.224

Hmm, let me call the left side as sin(theta - phi), where phi is an angle such that sin phi = 0.5547 / sqrt(0.832² + 0.5547²) ?

Wait, maybe another approach. Alternatively, let me let phi be such that:

sin phi = (26)/R, cos phi = 39/R.

Wait, because in the identity a sinθ + b cosθ = R sin(theta + phi), when a and b are coefficients with the same signs. But in this case, the equation is 39 sinθ -26 cosθ = 10.5, so a=39, b=-26.

So perhaps using the identity: a sinθ + b cosθ = R sin(theta + phi), where R = sqrt(a² + b²), and phi is such that tan phi = b/a. But in our case, since b is negative, phi would be in a different quadrant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write it as:

39 sinθ = 26 cosθ +10.5

Wait, but maybe it's easier to square both sides.

Wait, let's get back to:

39 sinθ -26 cosθ =10.5

Square both sides:

(39 sinθ -26 cosθ)^2 = (10.5)^2

39² sin²θ + 26² cos²θ - 2*39*26 sinθ cosθ = 110.25

Compute each term:

39² = 1521, 26²=676, 2*39*26=2028.

So:

1521 sin²θ + 676 cos²θ -2028 sinθ cosθ = 110.25

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe express in terms of sin²θ and cos²θ.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity sin²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/2, cos²θ=(1 + cos2θ)/2, and sinθ cosθ = (sin2θ)/2.

But this might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that t is the time, and in the y-direction, the distance is 3 km, so t=3/(13 cosθ).

In the x-direction, the distance is 2 km, so t=2/(13 sinθ -3.5).

Set them equal:

3/(13 cosθ) = 2/(13 sinθ -3.5)

Cross-multiply:

3*(13 sinθ -3.5) = 2*13 cosθ

Which brings us back to 39 sinθ -10.5 =26 cosθ.

Wait, maybe I can express this as tanθ = (26 cosθ +10.5)/39. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let me try to express everything in terms of tanθ.

From 39 sinθ -26 cosθ =10.5, divide both sides by cosθ:

39 tanθ -26 = 10.5 / cosθ.

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, let me express in terms of tanθ:

Let me denote tanθ = t.

Then, sinθ = t / sqrt(1 + t²), cosθ = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²).

Substituting into 39 sinθ -26 cosθ =10.5:

39*(t / sqrt(1 + t^2)) -26*(1 / sqrt(1 +t^2)) )=10.5

Factor out 1/sqrt(1 + t^2):

(39 t -26) / sqrt(1 + t^2) =10.5

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 +t^2):

39t -26 =10.5 sqrt(1 + t^2)

Now, square both sides:

(39t -26)^2 = (10.5)^2 (1 +t^2)

Expand the left side:

39² t² - 2*39*26 t +26² = 110.25 (1 + t²)

Compute:

39²=1521, 2*39*26=2028, 26²=676.

So,

1521 t² -2028 t +676 =110.25 +110.25 t²

Bring all terms to left:

1521 t² -2028 t +676 -110.25 -110.25 t² =0

Calculate coefficients:

t² terms: 1521 -110.25=1410.75

t term: -2028

Constants:676-110.25=565.75

So equation becomes:

1410.75 t² -2028 t +565.75=0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in t. Let's write it as:

1410.75 t² -2028 t +565.75=0

To simplify, perhaps multiply all terms by something to eliminate decimals. Alternatively, use the quadratic formula.

Quadratic formula: t=[2028 ±sqrt(2028² -4*1410.75*565.75)]/(2*1410.75)

First compute discriminant D=2028² -4*1410.75*565.75.

Calculate 2028^2: 2028*2028. Let me compute this.

2028^2: 2000²=4,000,000. 28²=784. 2*(2000)(28)=112,000. So (2000+28)^2=4,000,000 +112,000 +784=4,112,784.

Now compute 4*1410.75*565.75.

Compute 1410.75 *565.75 first. Let me compute this approximately.

Well, 1410 *565 = let's compute 1400*565= 791,000 and 10*565=5,650, so 796,650.

But wait, more accurately, perhaps calculate 1410.75 *565.75.

Let me consider it as (1410 + 0.75) * (565 + 0.75) = 1410*565 +1410*0.75 +565*0.75 +0.75^2.

Compute each term:

1410*565: Let's compute 1400*565= 793,000 (since 1400*500=700,000 and 1400*65=91,000; total 791,000) plus 10*565=5,650 → total 796,650.

1410 *0.75= 1057.5.

565 *0.75= 423.75.

0.75^2=0.5625.

Add all terms:

796,650 +1057.5=797,707.5

797,707.5 +423.75= 798,131.25

798,131.25 +0.5625=798,131.8125.

Now multiply by 4: 4*798,131.8125=3,192,527.25.

So D =4,112,784 -3,192,527.25 =920,256.75.

Now sqrt(D)=sqrt(920,256.75). Let's see, 960^2=921,600, which is a bit higher. 959^2=919,681. So 959^2=919,681. The difference is 920,256.75-919,681=575.75. So sqrt is approximately 959 + 575.75/(2*959) ≈959 + 0.3 ≈959.3.

So t= [2028 ± 959.3 ]/(2*1410.75)

Compute both possibilities.

First, the positive sign:

t= (2028 +959.3)/(2*1410.75) = (2987.3)/(2821.5)≈1.059.

Second, the negative sign:

t=(2028 -959.3)/2821.5 = (1068.7)/2821.5≈0.379.

So tanθ is either approximately 1.059 or 0.379.

We need to determine which one is correct. Since the boat is trying to counteract the current, the angle θ should be upstream, so the x-component of the boat's velocity should be greater than the current's speed. Wait, no, because the boat's speed relative to the ground in the x-direction is v_b sinθ -3.5. If this is negative, the boat would be moving downstream, which isn't desired. So to have a positive x-component (upstream), v_b sinθ must be greater than 3.5.

So, let's compute for both cases.

Case 1: tanθ=1.059 → θ≈46.7 degrees.

Then, sinθ≈0.725, 0.725*13=9.425 km/h upstream. So v_ground_x=9.425 -3.5=5.925 km/h upstream.

Case 2: tanθ=0.379 → θ≈20.7 degrees.

sinθ≈0.354, 0.354*13≈4.602 km/h upstream. So v_ground_x=4.602-3.5=1.102 km/h upstream.

Both are positive, so both solutions are possible. But which one is correct?

Wait, but in the equation, when we squared, we might have introduced extraneous solutions. Let me check which one satisfies the original equation.

Original equation after substitution: 39 sinθ -26 cosθ=10.5.

Let's compute for case 1: θ≈46.7 degrees.

sinθ≈0.725, cosθ≈0.688.

So 39*0.725=28.275, 26*0.688≈17.888.

So 28.275 -17.888≈10.387, which is close to 10.5. Considering rounding errors, this is acceptable.

Case 2: θ≈20.7 degrees.

sinθ≈0.354, cosθ≈0.935.

39*0.354≈13.806, 26*0.935≈24.31.

So 13.806 -24.31≈-10.504. That's approximately -10.5, which would be negative. But our equation is 39 sinθ -26 cosθ=+10.5, so case 2 gives the negative, which doesn't satisfy the equation. So only case 1 is valid.

So tanθ≈1.059 → θ≈46.7 degrees.

Now, compute the time taken. Let's use the y-component.

v_by =13 cosθ. cos(46.7)≈0.688.

So v_by≈13 *0.688≈8.944 km/h.

Time t=3 km /8.944 km/h≈0.3356 hours.

Convert to minutes: 0.3356 *60≈20.136 minutes. Hmm, looking at the options, F is 20.2 min, which is close. But wait, let me double-check calculations because the approximate value might have some errors.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in approximations. Let's compute more accurately.

First, let's compute tanθ=1.059 exactly. So θ=arctan(1.059).

Using calculator, arctan(1.059)≈46.76 degrees.

Then, cosθ=1 / sqrt(1 + (1.059)^2 )=1/sqrt(1+1.122)=1/sqrt(2.122)=≈0.670.

Wait, wait, maybe a better approach: cos(theta)=1 / sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta)).

tanθ=1.059 → tan^2=1.1225 → 1+1.1225=2.1225 → sqrt=1.456 → cosθ=1/1.456≈0.687.

So v_by=13 *0.687≈8.931 km/h.

Time t=3 /8.931≈0.336 hours.

0.336 hours *60≈20.16 minutes. So approximately 20.16 minutes, which is very close to option F:20.2 min.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the magnitude of the resultant displacement vector. Because the boat's path is determined by his velocity relative to the ground, but maybe I can find the resultant speed.

Wait, the resultant displacement is 3 km across and 2 km upstream, so the straight-line distance is sqrt(3^2 +2^2)=sqrt(
