Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about advertising types, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: "This is a form of targeted advertising, on websites, with advertisements selected and served by automated systems based on the content displayed to the user." Then it gives options from A to J.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my advertising terms, but I'll try to break it down. So the key points here are that it's targeted advertising on websites, and the ads are selected and served automatically based on the content the user is seeing.

I remember that there are several types of online advertising. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Social media marketing. That's more about promoting products on social platforms like Facebook or Twitter. It might involve targeted ads, but the question is about ads on websites in general, not just social media. So maybe not A.

Option B: Display advertising. Display ads are like banners, images, or videos on websites. They can be targeted, but I'm not sure if this specifically refers to contextual targeting. I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: Mobile advertising. That's ads on mobile devices, apps, or mobile websites. The question doesn't specify mobile, so probably not C.

Option D: Search engine marketing. This involves ads appearing on search engines, like Google Ads, based on keywords. These are targeted based on the user's search query, not the content of a website. So maybe not D.

Option E: Contextual advertising. Oh, I think this is the one. Contextual ads are where the ad content is related to the content of the webpage the user is viewing. Automated systems select the ads based on the page's content. That matches the description perfectly.

Option F: Email advertising. That's sending ads via email. Doesn't fit the website-based, content-targeted description.

Option G: Direct marketing. This is more about direct communication, like mail or phone calls, not online ads.

Option H: Affiliate marketing. This involves partners promoting products and earning commissions. It's a form of marketing but doesn't directly relate to the ad serving method described.

Option I: Interactive marketing. This involves engaging with customers through interactive means, like chat or games. Not exactly the same as automated ad serving based on content.

Option J: Internet advertising. This is a broad term that includes all forms of online ads, including display, search, etc. But the question is more specific, so J is probably too general.

Putting it all together, the description points to contextual advertising, which is option E. The ads are selected based on the webpage's content using automated systems. So I think the correct answer is E.
