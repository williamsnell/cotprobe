Okay, so I've got this question here about vector spaces and linear algebra. Hmm, I remember that vector spaces have some properties related to bases and linear independence. Let's see what the question says.

The first statement is that in a finite-dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis. Wait, I think I remember something about this. So, if I have a set of vectors that are linearly independent, can I always add more vectors to make it a basis? Oh right, because a basis is a maximal linearly independent set, meaning you can't add any more vectors without losing linear independence.

So in a finite-dimensional space, any linearly independent set can be extended to a basis. Because the space has a finite dimension, say n, so any set with size less than n can be extended. Yeah, that makes sense. So statement 1 must be true.

Now the second statement: If B1 and B2 are bases for the same vector space, then |B1| equals |B2|. I remember that all bases of a vector space have the same cardinality, which is the dimension of the space. Like, in RÂ², every basis has exactly two vectors. So this should be true regardless of whether the space is finite or infinite-dimensional. Wait, but does this hold in infinite dimensions too? I think it does because even in infinite-dimensional spaces, bases have the same cardinality, which is the dimension. So statement 2 should be true as well.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Oh, right! The second statement is definitely true because it's one of the fundamental theorems in linear algebra. It's called the replacement theorem or something similar. So yes, both statements are true.

Looking at the options, option B says both are true. So I think the answer is B.

Statement 1 asserts that in a finite-dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to form a basis. This is true because a basis is a maximal linearly independent set, and in a finite-dimensional space, any smaller linearly independent set can be expanded to include additional vectors until it spans the entire space.

Statement 2 claims that if \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \) are bases for the same vector space, then \( |B_1| = |B_2| \). This is also true, as all bases of a vector space, whether finite or infinite-dimensional, have the same cardinality, which corresponds to the dimension of the space.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is:

B: True, True

B
