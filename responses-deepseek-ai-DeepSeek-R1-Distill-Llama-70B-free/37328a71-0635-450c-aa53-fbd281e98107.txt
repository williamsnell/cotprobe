The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

You are a consultant asked to design an intervention program in a recently integrated housing project where antagonism and hostility between old and new residents are extremely high. The goal is to improve relations through contact. You would be more likely to facilitate that goal if you could arrange interactions that provide opportunities

Options:

A: for each group to reinforce their own positive traits without considering the other
B: where old and new residents are separated during most interactions
C: which encourage residents to ignore each other's presence
D: which provide an open airing and all-out discussion about what each group believes to be the negative crits of the other
E: which make explicit the status hierarchy chat is implicit in the interactions between the wo groups
F: that allow residents to vent their frustrations without any moderation
G: where residents can engage in competitive activities to establish dominance
H: for each group of residents co disconfirm negative traits of the other group
I: that involve only the leaders of each resident group in discussions

Alright, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about designing an intervention program to improve relations between old and new residents in a housing project where there's a lot of antagonism and hostility. The goal is to enhance their interactions through contact. Hmm, okay.

The question asks which arrangement of interactions would best facilitate this goal. Let me think about what I know about improving intergroup relations. I remember something about contact theory, which suggests that under certain conditions, contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve relations.

Wait, the key here is the conditions under which contact occurs. Just bringing people together isn't enough; it's how they're brought together that matters. From what I recall, the contact hypothesis proposes that positive outcomes are more likely when certain factors are present. One of those factors is that the contact should provide opportunities for people to learn about each other's positive traits and disconfirm negative stereotypes.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that aligns with this idea. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Each group reinforces their own positive traits without considering the other. That doesn't seem right because it doesn't involve interaction between the groups. They might just end up reinforcing their own stereotypes without challenging the other group's negative views.

Option B: Residents are separated during most interactions. That doesn't make sense because separation doesn't facilitate contact. If they're separated, they can't really interact and learn from each other.

Option C: Encourage residents to ignore each other. Ignoring each other's presence doesn't help either. It avoids the problem rather than addressing it, so no improvement would come from that.

Option D: Open discussion about negative critiques. Hmm, this might allow each group to express their grievances, but if not managed properly, it could lead to more conflict. The key is whether the discussion is constructive. But I'm not sure if this is the best approach compared to other options.

Option E: Make explicit the status hierarchy. That might actually highlight differences and could exacerbate tensions, especially if one group feels superior or inferior. So probably not the best choice.

Option F: Allow venting frustrations without moderation. Venting can sometimes relieve tension, but without moderation, it might just lead to more hostility. It could become a shouting match without any real understanding or resolution.

Option G: Competitive activities to establish dominance. Competition can increase tensions rather than reduce them. If they're competing, it might reinforce us vs. them mentality, which isn't helpful.

Option H: Each group can disconfirm negative traits of the other. Oh, this sounds promising. Disconfirming negative stereotypes means that through interaction, each group can see that the other doesn't fit the negative traits they believed. So when old and new residents interact in ways that show the opposite of what each group expects, it can break down those stereotypes and improve relations.

Option I: Only involve leaders in discussions. This is a top-down approach. While it might help the leaders understand each other better, it might not trickle down to the rest of the residents. The broader population's relations might not improve much.

So, considering all of this, the best option seems to be H, where interactions allow each group to disconfirm the negative traits they believe about the other. This active disconfirmation can lead to more positive perceptions and reduce hostility.

The best approach to improve relations between old and new residents in the housing project is to design interactions where each group can disconfirm the negative traits they believe about the other. This aligns with the contact hypothesis, which suggests that positive outcomes are more likely when interactions allow for the breaking down of stereotypes. By providing opportunities for disconfirmation, residents can challenge and overcome their preexisting biases, fostering mutual understanding and reducing antagonism.

Answer: H
