Okay, so I have this question about warranties in contracts, specifically when a buyer purchases an item that's unfit, defective, and unsafe. The question is asking which warranty the buyer can invoke, given that there are no other warranties. The options are A through J, each representing a different type of warranty.

First, I need to remember what each of these warranties means. I think the main ones are the implied warranties. There's the warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Oh, and there's also something about title, but that's probably about ownership, not the product's condition.

So the scenario is that the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. That sounds like it's not doing what it's supposed to do normally. So maybe it's about whether it's fit for its ordinary use.

Wait, the warranty of merchantability is an implied warranty that the goods are fit for their ordinary purpose. So if a product isn't suitable for what it's meant to be used for, that would breach this warranty. 

On the other hand, the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose applies when the seller knows the buyer has a specific use in mind and the buyer relies on the seller's judgment. But the question doesn't mention anything about a specific purpose beyond the ordinary use.

Looking at the options, option C is warranty of merchantability, and F is fitness for a particular purpose. Since the problem states the item is unfit for ordinary purposes, C seems right.

Wait, but what about option B, implied warranty? Implied warranties include both merchantability and fitness for particular purpose. So is the question asking for the specific warranty or the category? The question says "which of the following can be invoked," and the options are specific, so probably looking for C.

Other options: A is title, which is about ownership, so not relevant here. D is suitability, but I'm not sure if that's a standard term. E is non-infringement, which is about patents or trademarks, not product defects. G is durability, which I don't think is a standard warranty term. H is express warranty, which would require the seller to have made specific promises, but the question says no other warranties, so probably not. I is safety, which might be part of merchantability, but as a separate warranty, I'm not sure. J is quality, which again might be part of merchantability.

So the best fit is C: Warranty of merchantability.

The question revolves around determining which warranty a buyer can invoke when an item purchased is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. The key is to identify the most applicable warranty from the given options.

- **Warranty of merchantability (Option C)**: This is an implied warranty that goods are fit for their ordinary purpose. Since the item is described as unfit for its ordinary use, this warranty is directly relevant.
- **Warranty of fitness for a particular purpose (Option F)**: This applies when the seller knows the buyer has a specific use in mind and the buyer relies on the seller's judgment. The question does not mention a specific purpose beyond ordinary use, making this less applicable.
- Other options like warranty of title (A), non-infringement (E), durability (G), express warranty (H), safety (I), and quality (J) are either unrelated to the product's fitness for ordinary use or not standard terms in this context.

Thus, the most appropriate warranty in this scenario is the **warranty of merchantability**.

Answer: C
