Okay, so I've got this problem here about buying a radio. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about calculating the cash price and the installment price of a radio. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

The radio costs $38.00, and there are two taxes: a 3% excise tax and a 4% sales tax. Oh wait, so the total tax would be the sum of these two? Or maybe they're applied one after the other? I think taxes are usually applied one after another, so first excise, then sales tax on the new amount. Or maybe they're just added together. Let me think.

Wait, the cash price is the total amount you have to pay if you buy it outright, including taxes. So first, I need to calculate the total cost with both taxes.

Excise tax is 3% of $38. So, 3% of 38 is 0.03 * 38 = 1.14. Then the sales tax is 4% on the total after excise? Or on the original price? Or is the total tax 3% + 4% = 7% on $38?

I think each tax is applied sequentially. So first, excise tax is added to the price, then sales tax is calculated on the new amount. Let me confirm that.

So, initial price: $38.00.

First, add 3% excise tax. 3% of 38 is 1.14. So the price becomes 38 + 1.14 = $39.14.

Then, add 4% sales tax on this new amount. So 4% of 39.14 is 0.04 * 39.14 = 1.5656. Adding that to 39.14 gives 40.7056, which I'd round to about $40.71. So the cash price would be $40.71.

Wait, but let me check if the taxes are applied together. Another possibility is that both taxes are applied to the original price. So total tax would be 3% + 4% = 7% on $38. 0.07 *38 = 2.66. So 38+2.66=40.66, which is $40.66, close to $40.71. Maybe I was right the first time with applying them sequentially because it gives $40.71, which is one of the options.

Looking at the options, option A and B have cash price $40.71. So that's part (A) done. So the cash price is $40.71.

Now, part (B) is the installment price. The problem says you can buy it for $10 down and 3 payments of $11.60. So the total installment price would be the down payment plus the sum of the three payments.

So down payment is $10. Each payment is $11.60, and there are 3 payments. So 3 * 11.60 = 34.80. Adding the down payment: 10 + 34.80 = 44.80.

Wait, but that's the total amount paid in installments. So the installment price is $44.80. But wait, is that the total price including taxes, or is there interest or something? The problem doesn't mention any interest, so I think the installment price is just the sum of the down payment and the installments.

So the installment price is $44.80. Now, looking at the options, option A has installment price $44.80, and cash price $40.71. So that would make option A correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Cash price: 38 + 3% = 39.14, then 4% on 39.14 gives 40.7056, which rounds to 40.71. So cash price is $40.71.

Installment: 10 + (3 * 11.60) = 10 +34.80=44.80. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option A: Cash price $40.71, Installment $44.80.

The problem involves calculating the cash price and installment price of a radio. The radio costs $38.00, with a 3% excise tax and a 4% sales tax. 

**Step 1: Cash Price Calculation**  
- The excise tax is calculated as $38.00 * 3% = $1.14.  
- Adding this to the original price gives $38.00 + $1.14 = $39.14.  
- The sales tax is then applied to $39.14: $39.14 * 4% = $1.5656.  
- Adding the sales tax gives the cash price: $39.14 + $1.5656 = $40.71 (rounded to two decimal places).  

**Step 2: Installment Price Calculation**  
- The radio can be purchased with a $10.00 down payment and 3 payments of $11.60 each.  
- The total installment payments are 3 * $11.60 = $34.80.  
- Adding the down payment gives the total installment price: $10.00 + $34.80 = $44.80.  

**Final Answer**  
The cash price is $40.71, and the installment price is $44.80. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **A**.
