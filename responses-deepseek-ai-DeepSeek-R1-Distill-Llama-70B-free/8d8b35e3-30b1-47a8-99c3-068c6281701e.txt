Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Okay, so I've got this history question here about a poem called "Poor Winter King." I'm not super familiar with it, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking why the narrator mentions "Rhine and Prague." The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason. I need to figure out which one is the best explanation.

First, I'll look at the poem itself. It's a seventeenth-century song, and the lines go: "Now you will have to stay away / Alike from Rhine and Prague." So the Winter King is being told to stay away from these places. 

I remember that the Winter King is a nickname for Frederick V, Elector Palatine. He was involved in the Thirty Years' War. Bohemia was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and when Frederick accepted the crown of Bohemia, it pissed off Ferdinand II, the Holy Roman Emperor. Ferdinand was a Catholic, and Frederick was a Protestant, so this was part of the religious conflicts of the time.

The poem seems to be scolding the Winter King, telling him he's done something wrong by taking the crown. It mentions that Ferdinand is the rightful king of Bohemia. So the narrator is probably supporting Ferdinand and criticizing Frederick.

Now, the specific mention of Rhine and Prague. The Rhine River is a major river in Europe, flowing through Germany and the Netherlands. Prague is the capital of Bohemia. So why would the narrator tell Frederick to stay away from these places?

Looking at the options:

Option A: These were the capitals of the Winter King's empire. Wait, the Winter King's main territory was the Palatinate, which is along the Rhine. But Prague is the capital of Bohemia, which he briefly held. But if he's being exiled, maybe he can't go back to his own territories? Not sure.

Option B: These were strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire, so the narrator is warning him to stay away. That makes sense because the Holy Roman Empire, under Ferdinand, would control these areas. If Frederick is being told to stay away, it's because those places are now off-limits, maybe under imperial control.

Option C: Birthplaces of his parents. I don't think that's relevant here. The poem is about his actions, not his lineage.

Option D: Locations of his armies. If he can't go there, maybe his armies are stationed there, but I'm not sure that's the reason the poem mentions it.

Option E: Sites of his victories. If he had victories there, why would he be told to stay away? Maybe because he lost them, but the poem seems to be about his defeat.

Option F: Significant military posts within the Holy Roman Empire. This is similar to B. If Rhine and Prague are military strongholds, then staying away would make sense because they're under imperial control now.

Option G: Lands he lost in battle. That could be possible. If he lost these territories, he can't go back. But the poem says he'll have to stay away, implying they are now controlled by someone else.

Option H: Territories where he hid his wealth. I don't think the poem mentions anything about wealth.

Option I: Cities where he seeks asylum. If he's being exiled, maybe he's looking for a place to go, but the poem says he has to stay away, not seek refuge.

Option J: Destinations for pilgrimage. Doesn't seem relevant to the context.

So, narrowing it down, the main options are B, F, and G. 

The Holy Roman Empire controlled a lot of territories along the Rhine, and Prague was the capital of Bohemia. After Frederick was defeated, Ferdinand took back control of Bohemia. So the Winter King would be exiled from both the Rhine (his Palatinate) and Prague (Bohemia), which were now under Ferdinand's control.

So the narrator is telling him he can't go back to these places because they're now part of the Empire that's against him. That fits with option B or F. Option B says they are strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire, and the narrator is warning him to stay away. Option F says they're military posts within the Empire.

I think the key is that Rhine and Prague are places he can't return to because they're under imperial control. So the best explanation is that they're strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire, so the narrator warns him to stay away. That would be option B.

The poem "Poor Winter King" refers to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who was exiled after his defeat in the Thirty Years' War. The narrator mentions "Rhine and Prague" to emphasize that Frederick must stay away from these places. The Rhine River was associated with Frederick's Palatinate territories, while Prague was the capital of Bohemia, which he briefly ruled before being ousted by Ferdinand II of the Holy Roman Empire. 

The best explanation for the narrator's mention of these locations is that they were strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire. After Frederick's defeat, these areas fell under imperial control, and he was no longer welcome there. This aligns with the narrator's warning to Frederick to stay away, as these places were now off-limits to him due to their association with the Empire.

ANSWER: B
