Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about pea plants. Hmm, let's see. I remember that pea plants are a classic example used in Mendelian genetics. The question involves two traits: height and cotyledon color.

Alright, the problem says that tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d), and yellow cotyledons (G) is dominant to green (g). So, each trait is determined by a separate gene with two alleles each.

The cross is between a tall, homozygous, yellow pea plant and a dwarf, green pea plant. Wait, the tall plant is homozygous. Homozygous for which traits? Oh wait, the plant is tall and yellow. Since tall is dominant, being homozygous probably means DD for the tall trait. And for yellow, since G is dominant, the plant must be GG because yellow is dominant and it's homozygous.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The plant is tall and yellow. So, for the D gene, the tall plant would be either DD or Dd. But the question says it's homozygous, so homozygous for which? Oh wait, the entire plant is homozygous, meaning for both genes? Or just for one? Wait, the question says "tall, homozygous, yellow." Oh, I think it's homozygous for both traits. So, for the D gene, the tall plant is homozygous, so DD. For the G gene, yellow is dominant, so the plant is GG.

So the tall, homozygous, yellow plant has the genotype DDGG. Wait, is that right? Because each gene is on a separate chromosome, so the genotype would be DD for D gene and GG for G gene, so combined as DDGG.

The other parent is dwarf and green. Dwarf is recessive (d), and green is recessive (g). So the genotype is d d g g, which is ddgg.

So the cross is between DDGG (tall, yellow) and ddgg (dwarf, green).

Wait, but when you cross two plants, each contributes one allele for each gene. So for the D gene, DD (homozygous) crossed with dd. The cross would produce Dd for all offspring because DD can only give D, and dd can only give d. So all F1 for the D gene are Dd.

For the G gene, GG (homozygous) crossed with gg. So all offspring will be Gg.

So the F1 generation's genotype is Dd Gg. Now, what's the phenotype?

Tall (D is dominant), and yellow (G is dominant). So F1 are all tall and yellow. 

Wait, but looking at the options, which F1 options have tall and yellow? Let's check the options.

Looking at options:

Option E: F1 all tall and yellow. Option G: F1 all tall and yellow. Option I: same. Option H: F1 all dwarf and yellow, which doesn't fit.

So possible options are E, G, I, and maybe others. But let's proceed.

Now, the question also asks about the F2 generation. So to get F2, we need to self-pollinate the F1 plants. So each F1 is Dd Gg. When you self them, each gene will segregate.

For the D gene: Dd x Dd. The possible genotypes are DD (25%), Dd (50%), dd (25%). So phenotypes are tall (DD and Dd) and dwarf (dd).

For the G gene: Gg x Gg. The possible genotypes are GG (25%), Gg (50%), gg (25%). So phenotypes are yellow (GG and Gg) and green (gg).

Since the two genes are independent (assuming they are), the F2 phenotypic ratio is a 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering both traits. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. For two traits with independent assortment, the F2 would have (3:1 for each gene) leading to 9:3:3:1 overall.

Wait, but each of the two genes is considered separately. So for each gene:

F2 for D gene: 3/4 tall (DD and Dd) and 1/4 dwarf (dd).

F2 for G gene: 3/4 yellow (GG and Gg) and 1/4 green (gg).

So the combined phenotypes would be:

- Tall and yellow: (3/4 * 3/4) =9/16
- Tall and green: (3/4 *1/4) =3/16
- Dwarf and yellow: (1/4 *3/4)=3/16
- Dwarf and green: (1/4 *1/4)=1/16

Wait, but the F1 is Dd Gg. So when selfing, the F2 will display this ratio.

So the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9/16 tall yellow, 3/16 tall green, 3/16 dwarf yellow, 1/16 dwarf green.

Now looking back at the options.

Looking for F1: all tall and yellow. So options E, G, I have that.

Option E: F2 has 3/4 tall yellow, 1/4 dwarf green. No, that's not right because F2 has more categories.

Option G: F2 has 1/2 tall yellow, 1/4 tall green, 1/4 dwarf yellow. That's a 2:1:1 ratio, which doesn't match the 9:3:3:1.

Option I: F2 has 9/16 tall yellow, 3/16 tall green, 3/16 dwarf yellow, 1/16 dwarf green. That matches what I calculated.

So option I would be the correct one.

Wait, but let me check the other options. For example, option B has F1 as tall and green, which doesn't fit our case because F1 should be tall and yellow.

Option I says F1 all tall and yellow, F2 as 9/16, etc. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, let me double-check F1. So the parents are DDGG and ddgg. So for the D gene, DD x dd: all Dd. For the G gene, GG x gg: all Gg. So F1 is Dd Gg, which is tall (D dominant) and yellow (G dominant). So yes, F1 is all tall and yellow.

So in F2, when Dd Gg is selfed, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 as above.

So the correct answer should be option I.

In peas, tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d), and yellow cotyledons (G) is dominant to green (g). The cross involves a tall, homozygous, yellow pea plant (genotype **DDGG**) and a dwarf, green pea plant (genotype **ddgg**). 

### F1 Generation:
- For the **D gene**: DD (homozygous dominant) crossed with dd (homozygous recessive) produces offspring with genotype **Dd** (heterozygous). Since tall (D) is dominant, all F1 plants will be tall.
- For the **G gene**: GG (homozygous dominant) crossed with gg (homozygous recessive) produces offspring with genotype **Gg** (heterozygous). Since yellow (G) is dominant, all F1 plants will be yellow.
- Therefore, the F1 generation will have the genotype **Dd Gg** and the phenotype **tall and yellow**.

### F2 Generation:
To produce the F2 generation, the F1 plants (**Dd Gg**) are self-pollinated. Each gene segregates independently:
- For the **D gene**: Dd × Dd produces genotypes **DD** (25%), **Dd** (50%), and **dd** (25%). Phenotypes are **tall** (DD and Dd) and **dwarf** (dd).
- For the **G gene**: Gg × Gg produces genotypes **GG** (25%), **Gg** (50%), and **gg** (25%). Phenotypes are **yellow** (GG and Gg) and **green** (gg).

Since the two genes assort independently, the F2 phenotypic ratio is calculated as:
- **Tall and yellow**: (3/4 tall × 3/4 yellow) = 9/16
- **Tall and green**: (3/4 tall × 1/4 green) = 3/16
- **Dwarf and yellow**: (1/4 dwarf × 3/4 yellow) = 3/16
- **Dwarf and green**: (1/4 dwarf × 1/4 green) = 1/16

Thus, the F2 generation will have the phenotypic ratio **9/16 tall and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, 1/16 dwarf and green**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option I** correctly states that the F1 generation is all tall and yellow, and the F2 generation has the phenotypic ratio **9/16 tall and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, 1/16 dwarf and green**. This matches the calculated results.
