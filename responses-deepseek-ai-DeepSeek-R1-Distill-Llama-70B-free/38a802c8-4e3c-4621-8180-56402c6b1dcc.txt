Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vertex cover problem. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that a vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the minimum vertex cover, which means the smallest possible set that satisfies this condition.

The graph G has edges E = {<0,4>, <4,1>, <0,3>, <3,4>, <3,2>, <1,3>}. Let me try to visualize this. I'll list out all the nodes and their connections.

Node 0 is connected to 4 and 3.
Node 1 is connected to 4 and 3.
Node 2 is connected to 3.
Node 3 is connected to 0,4,1,2.
Node 4 is connected to 0,3,1.

Hmm, so node 3 seems to be a central hub connected to almost everyone. 

Wait, maybe I should draw the graph. Alternatively, I can list all edges and see which vertices cover them.

Let me list each edge and see which nodes can cover them. Each edge has two endpoints, and selecting either will cover it.

Edges:
0-4: covered by 0 or 4
4-1: covered by 4 or 1
0-3: covered by 0 or 3
3-4: covered by 3 or 4
3-2: covered by 3 or 2
1-3: covered by 1 or 3

I need to pick the smallest set of nodes so that every edge has at least one endpoint in the set.

I think it's helpful to look for any edges that are only covered by a single node. Wait, but each edge has two options. Maybe I should approach this using Konig's theorem, which relates the maximum matching to the minimum vertex cover in bipartite graphs. But wait, is this graph bipartite?

Let me check if the graph is bipartite. A bipartite graph can be colored with two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

Let me try to color the nodes. Let's assign color A to node 0. Then its neighbors, 4 and 3, must be color B. Then, node 4's neighbors are 0 (A), 3 (B), and 1. So node 1 must be color A. Node 3 is connected to 0 (A), 4 (B), 1 (A), and 2. So node 2 must be color B because it's connected to 3 (B). 

Wait, is there any conflict here? Node 4 is connected to node 1 (A), which is correct. Node 1 is connected to 3 (B), correct. Node 2 is connected to 3 (B) and no others. So the coloring is possible. So the graph is bipartite, partitioned into two sets: {0,1} (color A) and {2,3,4} (color B).

Since it's bipartite, Konig's theorem says that the size of the minimum vertex cover equals the size of the maximum matching. So maybe I can find the maximum matching and then apply Konig's theorem.

Let me find the maximum matching. A matching is a set of edges without common vertices.

Looking for the maximum matching:

Start with edge 0-4. Then, 3-2 (since 3 is connected to 2, which isn't in the first edge). Wait, but 3 is connected to 0,4,1,2. So if I pick 0-4, I can't use 0 or 4 for other edges.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's list possible edges and see how to maximize the matching.

Possible edges: 0-4, 4-1, 0-3, 3-4, 3-2, 1-3.

Let me try to select edges that don't share vertices.

One approach is to select:

0-4, 3-2, 1-3? Wait, no, because 3 can't be in two edges. So perhaps:

0-4, then 1-3. That uses 0,4,1,3. Then, 3 is connected to 2, but 3 is already used. So the next edge could be 2-3, but 3 is taken. Alternatively, maybe another combination.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model it as a bipartite graph and find the maximum matching.

In bipartition A: {0,1}, B: {2,3,4}.

Edges from A to B:

0 connected to 4,3.

1 connected to 4,3.

So the possible edges are 0-4, 0-3, 1-4, 1-3.

What's the maximum matching here? Let's see.

We can match 0-4, and 1-3. That's two edges. Are those independent? Yes, because 0 is matched to 4, and 1 is matched to 3. No shared vertices.

Alternatively, another matching: 0-3 and 1-4. Also two edges.

So maximum matching size is 2.

According to Konig's theorem, the minimum vertex cover has size equal to the maximum matching, so 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Konig's theorem applies to bipartite graphs, which this is. So the min vertex cover size is equal to the maximum matching size, which is 2.

Wait, but let me think again. Because if the maximum matching is 2, then the min vertex cover is 2. But looking at the options, the minimum options are C: [3,4], E: [1,3], etc. Let's see what those options cover.

Option C: [3,4]. Let's see if that's a vertex cover.

Check each edge:

0-4: 4 is in the cover. Good.

4-1: 4 is in the cover.

0-3: 3 is in the cover.

3-4: 3 and 4 are in the cover.

3-2: 3 is in the cover.

1-3: 3 is in the cover.

Yes, all edges are covered. So option C is a vertex cover of size 2. So that's the minimum possible.

But wait, another option: E is [1,3]. Let's check.

0-4: neither 1 nor 3 is 0 or4. So this edge isn't covered. So E is not a valid vertex cover. So E can't be the answer.

Option J: [0,3,4]. Size 3. But we have a size 2 cover, so J can't be the minimum.

Option C: [3,4]. Covers all edges as we saw.

So the correct answer must be C.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check.

Another possible vertex cover could be selecting nodes 3 and 1. Let's see.

Edges:

0-4: neither 3 nor 1 is 0 or 4. So this edge is not covered. So that can't be a vertex cover.

What about nodes 3 and 4? As in option C.

Yes, that works. Because every edge has either 3 or 4.

Let me list all edges again:

<0,4> → 4 is in the cover.

<4,1> →4 is in the cover.

<0,3> →3 is in the cover.

<3,4> → both are in the cover.

<3,2> →3 is in the cover.

<1,3> →3 is in the cover.

So yes, all edges are covered. So option C is a valid vertex cover of size 2.

Is there a smaller cover? Since the maximum matching is 2, the minimum vertex cover should be 2. So yes, option C is the minimum.

To solve the problem, we need to find the minimum vertex cover of the given undirected graph \( G \) with edges \( E = \{<0,4>, <4,1>, <0,3>, <3,4>, <3,2>, <1,3>\} \). A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest such set.

### Step 1: Analyze the Graph
The graph is bipartite, as it can be divided into two sets of vertices:
- Set \( A = \{0, 1\} \)
- Set \( B = \{2, 3, 4\} \)

This bipartition is confirmed by assigning colors to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Using this property, we can apply Konig's theorem, which states that in a bipartite graph, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching.

### Step 2: Find the Maximum Matching
A matching is a set of edges where no two edges share a common vertex. The maximum matching in this graph is:
- \( <0,4> \) and \( <1,3> \)

These two edges are independent, meaning they do not share any vertices. Thus, the size of the maximum matching is 2.

### Step 3: Apply Konig's Theorem
According to Konig's theorem, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching. Therefore, the minimum vertex cover must have 2 vertices.

### Step 4: Identify the Minimum Vertex Cover
We need to check which set of 2 vertices covers all edges in the graph. After analyzing the options:
- Option \( C: [3, 4] \) covers all edges:
  - \( <0,4> \): Covered by 4.
  - \( <4,1> \): Covered by 4.
  - \( <0,3> \): Covered by 3.
  - \( <3,4> \): Covered by both 3 and 4.
  - \( <3,2> \): Covered by 3.
  - \( <1,3> \): Covered by 3.

Thus, \( [3, 4] \) is a valid vertex cover of size 2, and no smaller vertex cover exists.

### Final Answer
The minimum vertex cover of \( G \) is \( [3, 4] \).
