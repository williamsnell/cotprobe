Okay, so I've got this problem here where Pauline has to choose between buying a stereo in New Jersey or New York. Let me try to figure out which option is cheaper for her.

Alright, first, the New Jersey option is straightforward—it's $698.50. No other costs mentioned there, I think. So that's easy enough.

Now, the New York option is a bit more complicated. The price there is $684.75, but there are taxes involved. Specifically, a 4% state tax and a 2% city tax. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total cost after adding these taxes.

Wait, how do taxes work here? Are they applied one after the other, or is it a combined tax? I think usually, when you have multiple taxes, you apply them sequentially. So first, you calculate the state tax on the price, then the city tax on the new amount, or vice versa. Or maybe they're combined into a total tax rate. Let me think.

Actually, the way taxes usually work is that each tax is applied to the base price, and then added together. Wait no, sometimes they stack. Like, if you have a state tax and a local tax, they can be added together and applied to the price. So for example, if it's 4% state and 2% city, the total tax rate would be 6% of the price. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the case here. The problem says a 4% state tax and a 2% city tax. So does that mean each is calculated on the original price, or is one applied after the other?

Wait, perhaps each tax is applied to the original price, and then added together. So the total tax would be 4% + 2% = 6% of $684.75. Let me calculate that.

So 6% of $684.75 is 0.06 * 684.75. Let me compute that. 684.75 times 0.06. Well, 700 * 0.06 is 42, but since it's 684.75, which is 15.25 less than 700. So 15.25 * 0.06 is about 0.915. So 42 minus 0.915 is about $41.085. So the total tax would be approximately $41.085. Then add that to the $684.75, which gives 684.75 + 41.085 = $725.835. So around $725.84.

Wait, but wait a minute. Alternatively, maybe the taxes are applied one after the other. Let me check that possibility. So, first apply the 4% state tax on $684.75, then apply the 2% city tax on the result.

So first, 4% of 684.75 is 0.04 * 684.75. Let me calculate that. 684 * 0.04 is 27.36, and 0.75 * 0.04 is 0.03, so total is 27.39. So the price after state tax is 684.75 + 27.39 = $712.14.

Then, apply the 2% city tax on $712.14. 2% of 712.14 is 0.02 * 712.14 = $14.2428. So adding that gives 712.14 + 14.2428 = $726.3828, which is approximately $726.38.

Wait, so depending on whether the taxes are applied together or sequentially, the total is a bit different. When I assumed they were additive (6%), I got $725.84. When applied one after the other, I got $726.38. The difference is minimal, but I need to be precise.

But I think the correct approach is to apply each tax on the original price and sum them, because that's how sales tax usually works. So for example, if you have state tax and local tax, each is calculated on the pre-tax amount, then added together. So the total tax would be (4% + 2%) of the price, which is 6%, leading to $725.84.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check. Suppose the item is $100. 4% state tax is $4, 2% city tax is $2, so total tax is $6, making the total $106. Alternatively, applying 4% first makes it $104, then 2% on $104 is $2.08, total $106.08. So the difference is 8 cents in this example. So in the problem, the two methods give slightly different results.

Hmm, but the question might be assuming that the taxes are applied one after the other. So perhaps I should calculate both possibilities.

Wait, but in the first approach, where both taxes are applied to the original price, the total tax is 6% of $684.75, which is $41.085, making the total $725.835, approximately $725.84.

In the second approach, applying 4% then 2%, the total is $726.38.

So depending on the method, the total is either around $725.84 or $726.38.

But wait, the problem might be expecting the first approach where the taxes are added together. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the taxes are compounded. So state tax is 4%, then city tax is 2% on the new amount. Let me calculate that.

So first, 4% tax on $684.75: 0.04 * 684.75 = $27.39. So new price is 684.75 + 27.39 = $712.14.

Then, 2% tax on $712.14: 0.02 * 712.14 = $14.2428. So total is 712.14 + 14.2428 = $726.3828, which is about $726.38.

So the New York total would be approximately $726.38, which is higher than the New Jersey price of $698.50.

Wait, so that would make the New Jersey stereo cheaper. So Pauline should buy the New Jersey one.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Maybe I should write it out step by step.

New York price: $684.75.

State tax: 4% of 684.75 = 0.04 * 684.75 = let's compute this accurately.

684.75 * 0.04: 600*0.04=24, 80*0.04=3.2, 4.75*0.04=0.19. So 24+3.2=27.2 +0.19=27.39. So state tax is $27.39.

So after state tax, total is 684.75 + 27.39 = $712.14.

Now, city tax is 2% on $712.14: 0.02 * 712.14.

Let me compute 712 * 0.02 = 14.24, and 0.14 * 0.02=0.0028. So total is 14.24 + 0.0028 ≈ $14.2428.

So adding that to $712.14 gives 712.14 +14.2428 = $726.3828, which is approximately $726.38.

So the total cost in NY is about $726.38, which is more than the NJ price of $698.50.

Therefore, Pauline should buy the stereo in New Jersey because it's cheaper after considering the taxes in New York.

Wait, but let me check if I did the math correctly.

Alternative approach: total tax is 4% + 2% = 6%. So 0.06 * 684.75.

Compute 684.75 * 0.06.

Well, 684 * 0.06 = 41.04, 0.75 * 0.06 = 0.045, so total $41.085.

So total cost is 684.75 + 41.085 = $725.835, which is about $725.84.

Wait, but this approach assumes that the taxes are applied to the original price and added together, not compounded. So which is correct?

In real life, when you have state and local taxes, each is typically applied to the pre-tax amount, and then added together. So for example, if you have a 4% state tax and a 2% local tax, the total tax is 6% of the original price, not compounded.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, in many places, the local tax is applied after the state tax. So the correct way is to compute state tax first, then local tax on the new amount.

Wait, no, that's not right. Typically, both taxes are applied to the original amount. So for example, if the price is $100, 4% state tax is $4, 2% local tax is $2, total tax $6, total price $106. So in that case, it's additive, not compounded.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me think of it another way. If I have a 10% state tax and a 5% local tax, is the total tax 15% or is it 10% then 5% on the new amount, making it 10% + 5% on 110, which is 5.5%, total 15.5%?

Wait, no, I think in most cases, state and local taxes are both applied to the original price, so they are additive. So 10% +5% would be 15% total. So the total tax is 15% of the original price.

But I'm not 100% sure. Let me try to find an example. Suppose an item costs $100.

- State tax: 4% → $4.

- Local tax: 2% → $2.

So total tax is $6, making the total $106.

Alternatively, if local tax is applied after state tax, then:

$100 + $4 = $104.

Then 2% on $104 is $2.08.

Total tax would be $4 + $2.08 = $6.08, making the total $106.08.

So depending on the application order, the total is slightly different.

But I think in reality, both taxes are applied to the original price, so the total is 6% of $100, which is $6, making the total $106.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the correct approach is to apply each tax to the original price, so the total tax is 4% + 2% = 6% of the original price.

So for the problem, that would mean the total tax is 6% of $684.75, which is $41.085, making the total $725.835, approximately $725.84.

Comparing to the New Jersey price of $698.50, which is lower.

So the New York total is higher, so she should buy in New Jersey.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate both ways to be thorough.

First way: additive taxes.

Total tax = 4% + 2% = 6% → 0.06 * 684.75 = $41.085.

Total cost: 684.75 + 41.085 = $725.835 → ~$725.84.

Second way: compounded taxes.

State tax: 4% of 684.75 = $27.39 → total $712.14.

City tax: 2% of 712.14 = $14.2428 → total $726.3828 → ~$726.38.

So depending on the method, the total is either about $725.84 or $726.38.

In either case, both totals are higher than $698.50, so the New Jersey option is cheaper.

Therefore, Pauline should buy the stereo in New Jersey.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: The New York stereo.

Option D: The New Jersey stereo.

Other options involve additional factors like discounts, travel expenses, etc., but the question doesn't mention any of that. So based purely on price, New Jersey is cheaper.

So the correct answer would be option D: The New Jersey stereo.
</think>

Pauline has two options for purchasing a stereo: buying it in New Jersey for $698.50 or buying it in New York for $684.75 plus a 4% state tax and a 2% city tax. To determine which option is cheaper, the taxes in New York must be calculated.

### New York Total Cost:
1. **State Tax**: 4% of $684.75  
   \[
   0.04 \times 684.75 = 27.39
   \]
   Total after state tax:  
   \[
   684.75 + 27.39 = 712.14
   \]

2. **City Tax**: 2% of $712.14  
   \[
   0.02 \times 712.14 = 14.2428
   \]
   Total after city tax:  
   \[
   712.14 + 14.2428 = 726.3828
   \]

Thus, the total cost in New York is approximately **$726.38**.

### Comparison:
- New Jersey price: **$698.50**  
- New York price: **$726.38**

The New Jersey stereo is cheaper after accounting for the taxes in New York.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The question does not mention travel expenses.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. There is no mention of negotiating a discount.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The New York stereo is more expensive.  
- **Option D**: Correct. The New Jersey stereo is cheaper.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The information provided is sufficient to determine the answer.
