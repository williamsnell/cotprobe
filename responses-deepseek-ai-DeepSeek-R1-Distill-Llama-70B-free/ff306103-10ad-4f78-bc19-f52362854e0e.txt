Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about psychology theories. The question is about determining which theory aligns with the belief that a child's misbehavior has four specific goals: attention, revenge, power, or to display inadequacy.

Hmm, I remember that different psychological theories propose various reasons behind a child's behavior. I need to think about each option and see which one fits.

Let's start by breaking down the key points. The idea here is that misbehavior serves one of four goals. So, the theory in question probably categorizes behavior into these specific motivations.

Option A: Skinner's behaviorism. Skinner was all about operant conditioning—reinforcement and punishment. He focused on external factors that influence behavior, like rewards or negative outcomes. But I'm not sure if he specifically outlined four goals like attention, revenge, etc. Maybe not the best fit.

Option B: Adler’s individual psychology. Adler talked about the importance of social interests and striving for superiority. He also mentioned inferiority complexes. Oh wait, I think he discussed behavior in terms of goals, like children acting out to get attention or power. That rings a bell. Adler might have categorized misbehavior into these four goals.

Option C: Beck’s cognitive-behavioral therapy. CBT focuses more on thought patterns and how they influence behavior. It's about identifying and changing negative thought processes. I don't recall Beck specifically outlining four goals for misbehavior, so probably not this one.

Option D: Perls’s Gestalt therapy. Gestalt is more about the present moment and the individual's experience, focusing on personal growth and awareness. I don't think it's about categorizing misbehavior into these four goals.

Option E: Erikson's stages. Erikson proposed psychosocial stages, each with its own crisis or conflict. His theory is more about development across the lifespan rather than specific reasons for misbehavior in children. So maybe not E.

Option F: Freud's psychoanalytic theory. Freud's approach deals with the unconscious mind and conflicts between the id, ego, and superego. He talked about defense mechanisms and repression. I don't think he categorized misbehavior into those four specific goals, so probably not F.

Option G: Mahler’s object relations theory. Mahler's work was about the separation-individuation process in early childhood. It's more about how children develop a sense of self. Not directly related to the four goals mentioned.

Option H: Piaget's cognitive development. Piaget focused on stages of cognitive development, like sensorimotor, preoperational, etc. His theory is about how children think and understand the world, not about the goals behind their misbehavior.

Option I: Rogers's person-centered therapy. Rogers emphasized unconditional positive regard and the therapeutic relationship. His approach is about providing a supportive environment for self-actualization, not about categorizing misbehavior into specific goals.

Option J: Bandura's social learning theory. Bandura is known for the Bobo doll experiment, showing that behavior is learned through observation and imitation. He talked about reinforcement and punishment, but again, not the four specific goals mentioned.

Wait, going back to option B, Adler. Adler's theory includes the concept of "mistaken goals," where children misbehave because they have wrong ideas about how to achieve their goals. He identified four such goals: attention, power, revenge, and the display of inadequacy. So when a child acts out, it's to achieve one of these. That fits perfectly with the question.

So the correct answer should be B: Adler’s individual psychology.

The belief that a child's misbehavior is driven by four specific goals—attention, revenge, power, or to display inadequacy—is most consistent with Adler’s individual psychology. Adler proposed that children may develop "mistaken goals" due to incorrect assumptions about how to achieve their desires, and he identified these four goals as common motivations for misbehavior. This aligns directly with the question's description.

Answer: B
