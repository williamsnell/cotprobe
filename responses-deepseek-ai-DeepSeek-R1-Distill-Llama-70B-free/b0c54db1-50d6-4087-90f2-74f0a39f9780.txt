Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about logical fallacies. Hmm, okay, I remember that logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that can undermine the logic of an argument. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking: When someone tries to support a proposition with information that's irrelevant to the claim, what fallacy have they committed? The options are A: straw person, B: genetic fallacy, and C: irrelevant conclusion.

Wait, I need to recall what each of these fallacies means. Let's start with option A, straw person. From what I remember, a straw person fallacy occurs when someone misrepresents someone else's argument to make it easier to attack. Like, they create a weaker version of the argument and then knock that down instead of addressing the real argument. So, it's about misrepresenting the argument, not necessarily about irrelevant information.

Option B is genetic fallacy. I think the genetic fallacy is when someone's argument is dismissed based on its origin rather than its actual merit. For example, if someone says you shouldn't listen to a particular idea because it comes from a certain person or place, that's the genetic fallacy. So it's more about the source of the argument rather than the argument itself.

Option C is irrelevant conclusion. This sounds like when the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premises. Like, if someone is arguing about the benefits of a new tax policy, and then they start talking about how the weather is nice today, that's not relevant. So the argument's conclusion isn't supported because the premises are unrelated to the claim.

Wait, the question says the person is using information that has nothing to do with the claim. So, if someone is trying to support a proposition with irrelevant info, they're not addressing the actual issue. That would mean their conclusion isn't supported by relevant premises. So that's the irrelevant conclusion fallacy.

Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. The straw person is about misrepresenting the argument, genetic is about the origin, and irrelevant conclusion is about using unrelated info to support the claim. So the correct answer should be C.

The question asks about a fallacy where someone uses irrelevant information to support a proposition. 

- **Straw person** involves misrepresenting an argument to attack it, which isn't the case here.
- **Genetic fallacy** dismisses an argument based on its origin, not its relevance.
- **Irrelevant conclusion** occurs when the argument's premises don't logically support the claim, fitting the scenario described.

Answer: C
