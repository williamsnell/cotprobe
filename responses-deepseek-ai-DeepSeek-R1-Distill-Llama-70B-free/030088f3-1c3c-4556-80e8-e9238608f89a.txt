Question:

Miranda enlarged a picture proportionally. Her original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long. If the new, larger picture is 10 cm wide, what is its length?

D: 10 cm
E: 12 cm
F: 24 cm
G: 8 cm

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Miranda enlarging a picture proportionally. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long. So, width is 4, length is 6. And she made it larger, keeping the proportions. The new width is 10 cm. I need to find out what the new length is.

Hmm, proportional enlargement means that the ratio of width to length stays the same before and after enlargement. So the aspect ratio is maintained. That makes sense because if you just scale up the picture without changing the proportions, it won't look stretched or squashed.

So the original ratio is width over length, which is 4/6. Let me simplify that. 4 divided by 6 is 2/3. So the ratio is 2:3. 

Now, the new picture has a width of 10 cm. I need to find the new length. Let's call the new length L. So the new ratio should be the same as the original. That gives me 10/L = 2/3.

Wait, no, actually, I think I should set it up as the original ratio equals the new ratio. So width1/length1 = width2/length2. So 4/6 = 10/L. 

Right, that's correct. So plugging in the numbers, 4/6 = 10/L. Let me solve for L. 

First, I can cross-multiply. So 4 * L = 6 * 10. That gives 4L = 60. 

Then, divide both sides by 4. L = 60 /4. That would be 15. So the new length should be 15 cm. 

Wait, let me double-check. Because 10 cm is the new width, and the original was 4 cm. So the scale factor is 10/4, which is 2.5 times bigger. So the length, which was 6 cm, should also increase by the same factor. 6 times 2.5 is 15. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option B is 15 cm. So that's the answer.

To determine the length of the enlarged picture, we maintain the original aspect ratio of the picture. The original dimensions are 4 cm (width) and 6 cm (length), giving a ratio of:

\[
\frac{\text{width}}{\text{length}} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

Let the new length be \( L \). Since the picture is enlarged proportionally, the new ratio must match the original ratio:

\[
\frac{\text{new width}}{\text{new length}} = \frac{10}{L} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
4L = 60 \quad \Rightarrow \quad L = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Thus, the length of the enlarged picture is 15 cm. The correct answer is:

**B: 15 cm**
