Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the heat of fusion of sucrose. Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that the heat of fusion relates to the solubility of a substance, especially in an ideal solution. Oh right, there's this formula called the van't Hoff equation or something like that which connects solubility with the heat of fusion.

Wait, the question gives me the solubility of sucrose in water at 25°C, which is 6.2 molal. The molecular weight of sucrose is 342, and its melting point is 200°C. Also, the heat of fusion of water is 1400 cal/mole. I need to find the heat of fusion of sucrose.

I think the formula I need is the one that relates solubility (S) to the heat of fusion (ΔHfus) and other constants. Oh right, the equation is something like:

ln(S) = - (ΔHfus / R) * (1/Tm) + (ΔHfus / R) * (1/T)

Wait, no, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, I recall that the solubility S is related to the heat of fusion by the formula:

S = (1000 * ΔHfus) / (M * R * T) * (1 / (1 - (T/Tm)))

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

ln(S) = -(ΔHfus / R)(1/T - 1/Tm)

But wait, that doesn't seem right because S is in molality, which is a concentration. Oh, perhaps the formula I'm thinking of is the cryoscopic formula, which relates the freezing-point depression to the molal concentration. But wait, this isn't a freezing point problem. Oh, but wait, the solubility might be considered in terms of the solution's behavior.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the solubility equation. I remember that the solubility S (in mol/kg) is given by S = (1000 * ΔHfus * Tm) / (M * R * T) ) * (1/(Tm - T)).

Wait, perhaps it's something like S = (1000 * ΔHfus) / (M * R) * (Tm - T) / (T * Tm)) ?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, since this is a thought process, I need to proceed as if I'm recalling it.

Wait, the formula that relates solubility (S) to the heat of fusion (ΔHfus) is:

S = (1000 * ΔHfus) / (M * R) * (1/(Tm - T)) * (Tm / T)

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the equation might be:

ΔHfus = (R * Tm * S * M) / (1000 * (1 - (T/Tm)))

Wait, that might make more sense. Let me break it down.

So, S is the solubility in mol/kg. M is the molecular weight. R is the gas constant, but I need to make sure of the units. Oh wait, R is usually 8.314 J/mol·K, but since the answer options are in cal, I might need to convert units.

Wait, the heat of fusion for water is given as 1400 cal/mole. So maybe R should be in cal units. Let me think: R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K) approximately.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to write the formula correctly. The formula for solubility in an ideal solution is derived from the van't Hoff equation, which in the case of solid-liquid equilibrium can be approximated by:

ln(S) = -(ΔHfus/R)(1/T - 1/Tm)

Wait, but S here would be molar concentration, but in this case, we have molality. So maybe the equation is similar.

Wait, but maybe it's better to use the formula:

ΔHfus = ( (1000 * R * Tm * T) / (M * (Tm - T)) ) * S )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula I'm looking for is:

ΔHfus = (M * R * Tm^2 * S) / (1000 * (Tm - T))

Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula:

S = (1000 * ΔHfus * Tm) / (M * R * T) ) * (1 / (Tm - T))

Wait, perhaps that's it. Let me think about the units. S is in mol/kg, M is molecular weight (g/mol), R is in cal/(mol·K), T is in Kelvin, Tm is the melting point in Kelvin.

So let's plug the numbers:

Given:
S = 6.2 mol/kg
M = 342 g/mol
Tm = 200°C = 473 K (since 200 + 273 = 473)
T = 25°C = 298 K
ΔHfus_water = 1400 cal/mol. Wait, but that's for water. Wait, but in this problem, we're dealing with sucrose's heat of fusion. So maybe the water's ΔHfus is a red herring. Or perhaps it's relevant if we're considering the solution's properties. Hmm, maybe not. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the formula I think I need is:

ΔHfus = (M * R * Tm * S * 1000) / ( (Tm - T) * T )

Wait, let me be precise. The correct formula I think is:

ΔHfus = (M * S * R * Tm^2) / (1000 * (Tm - T))

Wait, let me check the units. M is g/mol, S is mol/kg, R is cal/(mol·K), Tm is K.

So M (g/mol) * S (mol/kg) = (g/mol) * (mol/kg) ) = g/kg = (since 1 kg is 1000 g) so 1e-3 g²/kg·mol? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I'm better off computing it step by step.

Wait, let me try to write the equation again. The van't Hoff equation for solubility can be written as:

ln(S) = - (ΔHfus / R)(1/T - 1/Tm) + (ΔSfus / R)

But assuming that the entropy of fusion (ΔSfus) is negligible compared to the other terms, maybe we can ignore it. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation:

ln(S) ≈ - (ΔHfus / R) * (1/T - 1/Tm)

But wait, S is the solubility, so rearranging:

ΔHfus = - (R * ln(S)) / (1/T - 1/Tm )

Wait, but I don't have ln(S) here. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for solubility in terms of the heat of fusion, as given by:

S = (1000 * ΔHfus) / (M * R * T) ) * (Tm / (Tm - T))

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the formula that directly relates the solubility to the heat of fusion. Oh wait, I think the formula is:

ΔHfus = (M * R * Tm^2 * S) / (1000 * (Tm - T))

Wait, let's plug in the numbers:

M = 342 g/mol
R = 1.987 cal/(mol*K)
Tm = 473 K
S = 6.2 mol/kg
T = 298 K

So:

ΔHfus = (342 * 1.987 * 473^2 * 6.2) / (1000 * (473 - 298))

Wait, let me compute the denominator first: 473 - 298 = 175 K.

So numerator is 342 * 1.987 * (473^2) * 6.2.

Compute 473 squared: 473 * 473. Let me compute that. 400^2 is 160,000. 73^2 is 5329. Then, 2*400*73=58,400. So (400+73)^2 = 160,000 + 58,400 + 5329 = 223,729.

Wait, 473^2 = 473*473. Let me compute it accurately:

473 * 473:

Compute 400*400=160000

400*73=29,200 → times 2 (since 400 is multiplied by 73 twice) → 58,400.

73*73 = 5,329.

So total is 160,000 + 58,400 +5,329 = 223,729.

So 473^2 = 223,729.

Now compute numerator:

342 * 1.987 = let's do 342 * 2 = 684, then subtract 342 * 0.013 (since 1.987 is 2 - 0.013).

342 * 0.013 = 4.446. So 684 - 4.446 = 679.554.

So 342 * 1.987 ≈ 679.554.

Now, 679.554 * 223,729 = Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute:

Approximately, 679.554 * 223,729 = Let me compute 679.554 * 200,000 = 135,910,800. Then 679.554 * 23,729 ≈ ?

Wait, maybe I can approximate this step. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

But maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHfus = (M * R * Tm^2 * S) / (1000 * (Tm - T))

Yes, that seems right.

So let's proceed.

Compute numerator: 342 * 1.987 = 679.554 cal/(mol*K) * g/mol → Wait, no, let me think about the units.

Wait, R is in cal/(mol·K), M is g/mol, Tm is in K, S is mol/kg.

So, M (g/mol) * R (cal/(mol·K)) → (g * cal) / (mol^2 * K). Then multiplied by Tm^2 (K^2), gives (g * cal * K^2) / (mol^2 * K) → (g * cal * K) / mol^2.

Then multiplied by S (mol/kg): (g * cal * K * mol) ) / (mol^2 * kg) → (g * cal * K) / (mol * kg).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe that's getting too detailed.

Let me proceed with the numbers. So numerator is 342 * 1.987 * 223729 * 6.2.

Wait, first, 342 * 1.987 = 679.554.

679.554 * 223,729 = Let's compute 679,554 * 223.729 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute 679.554 * 223729 ≈ 679.554 * 2.23729e5 = ?

Wait, 679.554 * 223729 = ?

Wait, 679.554 * 223,729 → Let me compute this as (approx) 680 * 224,000.

680 * 224,000 = 680 * 2.24e5 = (680 * 2e5) + (680 * 24,000) → 136,000,000 + 16,320,000 = 152,320,000.

But perhaps that's an overestimation. Let me compute 679.554 * 223729:

Compute 679.554 × 200,000 = 135,910,800.

679.554 × 23,729 = ?

Compute 679.554 × 20,000 = 13,591,080.

679.554 × 3,729 = ?

Compute 679.554 × 3,000 = 2,038,662.

679.554 × 729 = Let's see, 679.554 × 700 = 475,687.8.

679.554 × 29 = 19,697.066.

So 475,687.8 + 19,697.066 ≈ 495,384.866.

So 679.554 × 3,729 ≈ 2,038,662 + 495,384.866 ≈ 2,534,046.866.

So 679.554 × 23,729 ≈ 13,591,080 + 2,534,046.866 ≈ 16,125,126.866.

So total numerator is 135,910,800 + 16,125,126.866 ≈ 152,035,926.866.

Now multiply by 6.2:

152,035,926.866 × 6.2 = Let's compute 152,035,926.866 × 6 = 912,215,561.2 and 152,035,926.866 × 0.2 = 30,407,185.3732. So total is 912,215,561.2 + 30,407,185.3732 ≈ 942,622,746.57 cal·g·something.

Now the denominator is 1000 * (Tm - T) = 1000 * 175 = 175,000.

So ΔHfus = 942,622,746.57 / 175,000 = ?

Compute 942,622,746.57 ÷ 175,000.

Let me compute 942,622,746.57 ÷ 175,000:

First, 175,000 = 1.75e5.

942,622,746.57 ÷ 1.75e5 = (942,622,746.57 / 1.75) / 1e5.

Compute 942,622,746.57 / 1.75:

Well, 942,622,746.57 ÷ 1.75 = 942,622,746.57 * (4/7) ≈ because 1/1.75 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So 942,622,746.57 * 4/7 ≈ ?

Compute 942,622,746.57 * 4 = 3,770,490,986.28.

Divide by 7: 3,770,490,986.28 ÷ 7 ≈ 538,613,569.466.

So 3,770,490,986.28 ÷7 ≈ 538,613,569.466.

Now divide by 1e5: 538,613,569.466 ÷ 1e5 = 5,386.13569466 ≈ 5,386.136 cal/mol.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are in the thousands. Oh wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the units. Because the result I'm getting is around 5,386 cal/mol, but the options are all around 3,000-4,000 cal.

Wait a second, let's think again. Maybe I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is ΔHfus = (M * S * R * Tm^2) / (1000 * (Tm - T))).

Wait, but that's what I used, but perhaps I messed up the units. Let me check the units again.

M is in g/mol, S is in mol/kg, R is in cal/(mol·K), Tm is in K. So:

M (g/mol) * S (mol/kg) = (g/mol) * (mol/kg) )= g/(kg) = 0.001 g/g? No, wait: 1 kg = 1000 g, so 1 g = 0.001 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted S from mol/kg to mol/(1000 g), since R is in cal/(mol·K). Hmm, no, I think the formula accounts for that.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that M is in kg/mol instead of g/mol. Wait no, M is given in g/mol (342 g/mol), so perhaps I need to convert it to kg/mol by dividing by 1000.

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong. Because in the formula, M should be in kg/mol.

So M = 342 g/mol = 0.342 kg/mol.

Let me recompute with M = 0.342 kg/mol.

So numerator is M * R * Tm^2 * S.

M = 0.342 kg/mol.

So 0.342 * 1.987 * 473^2 * 6.2.

Compute 0.342 * 1.987 first.

0.342 * 2 = 0.684, minus 0.342 * 0.013 = 0.004446 → 0.684 - 0.004446 = 0.679554.

So 0.342 * 1.987 ≈ 0.679554 cal/(mol·K) * kg/mol.

Wait, then multiply by Tm^2 (473^2 = 223729 K²).

So 0.679554 * 223729 ≈ Let's compute 0.679554 * 223729.

0.679554 * 200,000 = 135,910.8.

0.679554 * 23,729 ≈ Let's compute 0.679554 * 20,000 = 13,591.08.

0.679554 * 3,729 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.679554 * 3,000 = 2,038.662.

0.679554 * 729 = 495.384.

So 2,038.662 + 495.384 ≈ 2,534.046.

So 0.679554 * 23,729 ≈ 13,591.08 + 2,534.046 ≈ 16,125.126.

So 0.679554 * 223729 ≈ 135,910.8 + 16,125.126 ≈ 152,035.926 cal·kg/(mol·K²).

Now multiply by S, which is 6.2 mol/kg.

So 152,035.926 * 6.2 ≈ Let's compute 152,035.926 * 6 = 912,215.556.

152,035.926 * 0.2 = 30,407.185.

Total ≈ 912,215
