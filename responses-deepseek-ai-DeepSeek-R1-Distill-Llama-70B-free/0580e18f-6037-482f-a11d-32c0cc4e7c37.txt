Question:

Discuss Mead's (1935) study of three New Guinea tribes. What do her findings indicate about the effect of culture on personality?

Options:

A: Culture has no effect on personality traits.
B: Personality traits, especially those related to dominance, vary depending on the culture.
C: The differences in personality traits among the tribes were insignificant.
D: Only one of the tribes showed variation in personality traits due to cultural influences.
E: Personality traits are universally consistent due to shared human experience.
F: The study concluded that environment has a stronger effect on personality than culture does.
G: Personality traits are determined by genetics.
H: The study indicated that cultural norms have no distinct patterns or effects on the personality traits of the tribes.
I: Personality traits are the same across all cultures.
J: Mead's findings suggest that personality traits are primarily influenced by biological factors, with little cultural impact.

Okay, so I have this question about Margaret Mead's study from 1935 on three New Guinea tribes. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

From what I remember, Mead was an anthropologist who studied different cultures to see how they influence personality. She looked at three tribes, if I'm not mistaken. Each tribe had different child-rearing practices, and she wanted to see if that affected the personalities of the people.

So the question is about the effect of culture on personality. The options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says culture has no effect, which doesn't sound right. I think Mead found that culture does influence personality, so A is probably incorrect.

Option B states that personality traits, especially dominance, vary by culture. That rings a bell. I think she found that different cultures emphasized different traits. Like, one tribe might value aggressiveness while another values cooperation. So B could be a good candidate.

Option C says the differences were insignificant. No, I think her findings highlighted clear differences, so C is likely wrong.

Option D suggests only one tribe varied due to culture. That doesn't fit because she studied three tribes, so probably more than one showed variation.

Option E claims personality is universally consistent. That's the opposite of what I remember. Mead's work was about cultural differences shaping personality, so E is not right.

Option F says environment affects personality more than culture. I'm not sure about the specifics, but the question is about culture's effect, so maybe F is trying to trick us. I think Mead focused on culture, not environment.

Option G is about genetics determining traits. That's not related to her study, which was about culture, so G is incorrect.

Option H says cultural norms have no distinct effects. That contradicts what I remember, so H is wrong.

Option I says traits are the same everywhere. Again, Mead showed variation, so I is incorrect.

Option J suggests biology is the main influence. Her study was more about culture, so J is not the right choice.

Putting it all together, the correct answer is probably B. Mead's findings indicated that personality traits like dominance vary depending on the culture because each tribe she studied had different cultural practices that influenced their behaviors and personalities.

Margaret Mead's 1935 study of three New Guinea tribes demonstrated that cultural practices significantly influence personality traits. She observed that each tribe, with its distinct child-rearing practices, fostered different personality traits such as dominance or cooperation. This variation across cultures highlights that personality is shaped by cultural norms rather than being universally consistent or solely determined by biology or environment. 

The correct answer is B: Personality traits, especially those related to dominance, vary depending on the culture.

Answer: B
