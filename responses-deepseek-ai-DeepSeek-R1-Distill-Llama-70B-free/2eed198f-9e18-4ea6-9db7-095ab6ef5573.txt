Okay, so I've got this transformer problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about calculating the efficiency of a transformer under two different load conditions. The transformer is rated 150 kVA, with a primary voltage of 2400 V and secondary 240 V, operating at 60 Hz. They've given data from both an open-circuit test and a short-circuit test. 

Wait, right, the open-circuit test is usually used to find the iron losses, or the no-load losses, right? And the short-circuit test is for the copper losses, which are the I²R losses in the windings. So, the open-circuit test measures the losses that are always there even when there's no load, like the core losses. The short-circuit test measures the losses that depend on the load current because they're related to the resistance of the windings.

So the open-circuit data given is 240 volts, 16.75 amperes, and 580 watts. Hmm, since it's an open-circuit test, the current is the no-load current. But wait, in an open-circuit test, the power is low because it's just the core losses. So the 580 watts here must be the iron losses, right? Because that's what's being measured when there's no load.

Then for the short-circuit test, the data is 63.0 volts, 62.5 amperes, and 1660 watts. In a short-circuit test, since the secondary is shorted, the current is higher, and the power measured is the copper losses because it's I²R. So, those 1660 watts are the copper losses, or the load losses.

Wait, but in these tests, the power is measured as the input for the open-circuit and the input in the short-circuit. So for the open-circuit, the power is V * I, which gives the iron losses. For the short-circuit, the power is V * I, which gives the copper losses because the secondary is shorted, so all the power is lost as I²R.

So first, I think I need to calculate the rated currents on both the primary and secondary sides because I need that to compute the efficiency.

The transformer is 150 kVA, which is 150,000 VA. The primary voltage is 2400 V, so the rated primary current should be 150,000 / 2400 = 62.5 A. Wait, 150,000 divided by 2400: 2400 goes into 150,000 how many times? Let me calculate that. 2400 * 60 is 144,000. So 150,000 - 144,000 is 6,000. 6,000 / 2400 is 2.5. So 62.5 A on the primary side. And on the secondary side, 150,000 / 240 V is 625 A. So the secondary rated current is 625 A.

Wait, but in the short-circuit test, the current is 62.5 A on the primary side. Oh wait, that's the same as the rated primary current. So maybe the short-circuit test was done at rated current? But wait, in a short-circuit test, you usually don't go up to rated current because the voltage applied is much lower. Oh, but maybe that's the case here.

Wait, the short-circuit test is done with the secondary shorted, and you apply a voltage Vsc such that the primary current is the rated current. Because when the secondary is shorted, the current would be higher for a given voltage. So in this case, when they did the short-circuit test, they applied 63 V to get 62.5 A, which is the rated primary current. So the 63 V is the voltage required to circulate the rated current in the primary when the secondary is shorted. That makes sense because the short-circuit test is usually done at rated current.

So from the short-circuit test, the power is 1660 W, which is the copper loss at rated current. So the copper loss, P_c, is 1660 W.

From the open-circuit test, the power is 580 W, which is the iron loss, P_i.

Wait, but wait a second. The open-circuit test was done at 240 V on the primary, which is the rated primary voltage. So that's the correct way to measure the iron losses because the core flux depends on the voltage applied.

So the iron loss is 580 W, and the copper loss at rated current is 1660 W.

Now, the efficiency of a transformer is defined as (output power) / (input power) * 100%. Or, it's usually calculated as (rated kVA * load p.f. ) / (rated kVA * load p.f. + P_i + P_c) ) * 100%.

Wait, no, more accurately, efficiency (η) is given by η = (output power) / (input power) * 100%. The input power is the power supplied to the primary, which includes the output power plus the losses (iron and copper). So, η = (S * pf - P_loss) / (S * pf) * 100%, but I might be mixing something up. Alternatively, since S is the apparent power (kVA), the output in kW would be S * pf minus the losses.

Alternatively, the formula I remember is η = (kW output) / (kW output + losses) * 100%. But the losses include both iron and copper.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The total losses are the sum of the iron losses and the copper losses. So, η = (output power) / (output power + total losses) * 100%.

But output power is the load power, which is S * pf, but S is the rated kVA. Wait, no. The S is the kVA, which is the apparent power. So the actual power (kW) is S * pf.

But when calculating efficiency, you take the output power (kW) divided by the input power (kW). Input power is output power plus losses.

So, η = (output power) / (output power + P_i + P_c) * 100%.

But wait, in this case, the P_c is the copper loss, which depends on the load current. So for part (a), it's at rated load, 0.8 pf.

Wait, for part (a), the load is rated, so the output power is 150 kVA * 0.8 = 120 kW. But wait, no, kVA is apparent power. So the actual power P is kVA * pf. So yes, 150 * 0.8 = 120 kW.

The copper loss at rated load is given as 1660 W, which is 1.66 kW. The iron loss is 580 W, 0.58 kW.

Wait, but wait: the copper loss varies with the square of the load current. So if the load is at half-rated current, the copper loss would be a quarter of that.

Wait, but in the given short-circuit test, the copper loss is 1660 W at rated current. So for part (a), which is at rated load, the copper loss is 1660 W.

So, for part (a), the total losses are 580 W (iron) + 1660 W (copper) = 2240 W, which is 2.24 kW.

Wait, but the output power is 120 kW. So the input power is 120 + 2.24 = 122.24 kW. Then efficiency is (120 / 122.24) * 100%.

Let me compute that: 120 / 122.24 ≈ 0.9817, so 98.17% efficiency.

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation. 120 / 122.24 = Let me compute 122.24 divided by 120 is approximately 1.01866, so reciprocal is about 0.9817, yes.

So part (a) is approximately 98.17% efficiency.

Now, part (b) is at half the rated load, which would be 75 kVA, but more importantly, the current is half. So the load is 0.5 * 150 kVA = 75 kVA. But the power factor is 0.6, so the actual power is 75 * 0.6 = 45 kW.

Wait, no, wait. The question says (b) is at one-half rated load, 0.6 power factor. So, the load is 75 kVA, but the power is 75 * 0.6 = 45 kW.

But the copper loss depends on the square of the load current. So since the load is half, the current is half, so copper loss is (0.5)^2 times the rated copper loss. So 1660 W * 0.25 = 415 W.

So the copper loss at half load is 415 W or 0.415 kW.

Iron loss remains the same, 580 W, because it's voltage-dependent, and as long as the voltage is the same, the iron loss is the same. So total losses are 580 + 415 = 995 W, 0.995 kW.

So the input power is output (45 kW) plus losses (0.995 kW) = 45.995 kW.

Efficiency is (45 / 45.995) * 100% ≈ ?

Let me calculate 45 / 45.995.

45.995 is approximately 46 kW. So 45/46 is approx 0.97826, so about 97.826% efficiency.

Wait, but let me do more precise calculation.

45 / 45.995 = let's see.

Let me compute 45 ÷ 45.995.

Well, 45.995 = 45 + 0.995. So let me think, 45/(45 + 0.995) = 1/(1 + 0.995/45) ) = 1/(1 + 0.022111) ) ≈ 1/1.022111 ≈ 0.9783.

So approximately 97.83% efficiency.

Wait, but let me think again about the copper loss calculation. Since the load current is half the rated, the copper loss is (0.5)^2 * 1660 W. So 0.25 * 1660 = 415 W, yes.

So for part (b), the efficiency is about 97.83%.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: 0.9817, 0.9784.

That's exactly what I got for part (a) 98.17% (0.9817) and part (b) 97.83% ≈ 0.9783. So option D matches.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

In part (a), the output is 150 kVA * 0.8 = 120 kW.

Copper loss is 1660 W = 1.66 kW.

Iron loss is 580 W = 0.58 kW.

Total loss = 1.66 + 0.58 = 2.24 kW.

Input power = 120 + 2.24 = 122.24 kW.

Efficiency = (120 / 122.24) * 100 = 98.17% (0.9817).

Yes, that's correct.

For part (b), half load is 75 kVA, 0.6 pf, so output power is 75 * 0.6 = 45 kW.

Copper loss is (0.5)^2 * 1660 = 415 W = 0.415 kW.

Iron loss is 580 W = 0.58 kW.

Total loss = 0.415 + 0.58 = 0.995 kW.

Input power = 45 + 0.995 = 45.995 kW.

Efficiency = 45 / 45.995 ≈ 0.9783, which is 97.83%.

So the closest option is D: 0.9817 and 0.9784.

Yes, that seems correct.

- **Short-circuit test (copper losses)**: 63.0 V, 62.5 A, 1660 W.

### Key Calculations:

   \]

2. **Copper Losses (P_c)**: From the short-circuit test, the power measured is the copper loss at rated current:
   \[
   P_c = 1660 \, \text{W}.
   \]

3. **Rated Currents**:
   - Primary side: 
     \[
     I_{\text{rated, primary}} = \frac{\text{Rated kVA} \times 1000}{V_{\text{primary}}} = \frac{150 \times 1000}{2400} = 62.5 \, \text{A}.
     \]
   - Secondary side:
     \[
     I_{\text{rated, secondary}} = \frac{\text{Rated kVA} \times 1000}{V_{\text{secondary}}} = \frac{150 \times 1000}{240} = 625 \, \text{A}.
     \]

4. **Efficiency Formula**:
   Efficiency is calculated as:
   \[
   \eta = \frac{\text{Output Power}}{\text{Output Power} + \text{Total Losses}} \times 100.
   \]
   Total losses are the sum of iron losses and copper losses:
   \[
   P_{\text{total}} = P_i + P_c.
   \]

---

### Part (a): Efficiency at Rated Load (0.80 Power Factor)
1. **Output Power**:
   \[
   P_{\text{output}} = \text{Rated kVA} \times \text{Power Factor} = 150 \times 0.8 = 120 \, \text{kW}.
   \]

2. **Total Losses**:
   - Copper loss at rated load: \( P_c = 1660 \, \text{W} = 1.66 \, \text{kW} \).
   - Iron loss: \( P_i = 580 \, \text{W} = 0.58 \, \text{kW} \).
   \[
   P_{\text{total}} = P_i + P_c = 0.58 + 1.66 = 2.24 \, \text{kW}.
   \]

3. **Efficiency**:
   \[
   \eta = \frac{120}{120 + 2.24} \times 100 = \frac{120}{122.24} \times 100 \approx 98.17\%.
   \]

---

### Part (b): Efficiency at Half Rated Load (0.60 Power Factor)
1. **Output Power**:
   \[
   P_{\text{output}} = \frac{\text{Rated kVA}}{2} \times \text{Power Factor} = \frac{150}{2} \times 0.6 = 45 \, \text{kW}.
   \]

2. **Copper Loss**:
   Copper loss varies with the square of the load current. At half load:
   \[
   P_c = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \times 1660 = 0.25 \times 1660 = 415 \, \text{W} = 0.415 \, \text{kW}.
   \]

3. **Total Losses**:
   - Copper loss: \( P_c = 0.415 \, \text{kW} \).
   - Iron loss: \( P_i = 0.58 \, \text{kW} \).
   \[
   P_{\text{total}} = P_i + P_c = 0.58 + 0.415 = 0.995 \, \text{kW}.
   \]

4. **Efficiency**:
   \[
   \eta = \frac{45}{45 + 0.995} \times 100 = \frac{45}{45.995} \times 100 \approx 97.83\%.
   \]

---

### Final Answer:
- Part (a): \( \eta \approx 98.17\% \).
- Part (b): \( \eta \approx 97.83\% \).
