Question:

On February 1, a woman conveys her farm to a man, and the man duly records the conveyance. The following day, the man conveys the property to his sister; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the man executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a friend. The friend gives the man a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the sister. The sister, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to a farmer, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the farmer purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the sister and duly records the deed. If the property in question was located in a state having a notice-type statute, which of the following parties would ultimately prevail?

Options:

A: The man and the farmer.
B: The sister and the friend.
C: The friend.
D: The man.
E: None of the above.
F: The woman.
G: The sister.
H: Both the man and the friend.
I: The farmer.
J: Both the sister and the farmer.

Okay, so I've got this property law question to tackle, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario involves a series of conveyances of a farm, and the state has a notice-type recording statute. I remember that notice statutes affect who gets priority when there are multiple conveyances.

So, the timeline is crucial here. Let's outline the events:

1. February 1: Woman conveys farm to Man. He records it. So, the public record shows Man owns it now.
2. February 2: Man conveys to Sister. She doesn't record it yet. So, the record still shows Man as owner.
3. February 4: Man conveys same farm to Friend. Friend records it, but Friend knows about the prior conveyance to Sister. So Friend has actual knowledge.
4. February 6: Sister records her deed. So now, the record shows Sister as owner.

Wait, but Friend recorded on Feb 4, Sister on Feb 6. But since the state is a notice jurisdiction, the recording date and notice are important.

Then, Friend conveys to Farmer on February 5. Farmer pays $115,000, and records on Feb 5. Farmer had no notice of the conveyance to Sister.

Wait, no: The Farmer's purchase was on February 5, which is before Sister records on Feb 6. But Farmer records on Feb 5. So let me check the timeline again.

Wait, no, the events as described:

- On Feb 4, Friend records.

- On Feb 5, Friend conveys to Farmer, who records that same day.

- Sister records on Feb 6.

Wait, that seems important.

So let me list all the conveyances and recordings:

1. Feb 1: Woman → Man. Recorded immediately.
2. Feb 2: Man → Sister. Not recorded until Feb 6.
3. Feb 4: Man → Friend. Friend records on Feb 4, even though he knows about the Sister conveyance.
4. Feb 5: Friend → Farmer. Farmer records on Feb 5. Farmer has no notice of Sister's conveyance.
5. Feb 6: Sister records her deed.

So, the key is to determine the priority of interests under a notice-type statute.

In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance will prevail over the earlier conveyance, provided they record promptly.

But let me think about each conveyance.

First, Woman to Man on Feb 1, recorded. So Man is the first recorded owner.

Then, Man conveys to Sister on Feb 2 but doesn't record until Feb 6. So between Feb 2 and Feb 6, Sister has an unrecorded deed.

Then, on Feb 4, Man conveys to Friend. Now, Friend knows about the conveyance to Sister (actual knowledge). So Friend has knowledge at the time of purchase. So even though Sister hasn't recorded yet, Friend has notice. So Friend's deed, recorded on Feb 4, would be behind Sister's because Friend had actual knowledge. So in a notice state, if you have actual knowledge, you can't prevail over a prior unrecorded interest.

So Friend's conveyance from Man on Feb 4 is junior to Sister's interest because Friend knew about it.

Then, Friend conveys to Farmer on Feb 5, and Farmer records on Feb 5. Farmer didn't have notice of Sister's conveyance. So Farmer would take free of Sister's interest if Farmer is a bona fide purchaser (BFP).

Wait, but can Farmer be a BFP? Because in a notice state, BFP must have no actual or constructive notice.

Farmer buys from Friend on Feb 5, and records that same day. At the time Farmer takes, Sister's deed hasn't been recorded yet (it's recorded on Feb 6). So the public records don't show Sister's ownership yet.

But Farmer is buying from Friend, whose deed was recorded on Feb 4. So when Farmer records on Feb 5, does that help?

Wait, but when Farmer records on Feb 5, Sister's conveyance was recorded on Feb 6, which is after Farmer's recording. So in terms of the recording, Farmer's is earlier.

But in a notice jurisdiction, the key is whether Farmer had notice when he took the deed from Friend.

Farmer had no notice of Sister's conveyance. So when Farmer buys from Friend, he has no knowledge (actual or constructive) about Sister's prior interest.

Wait, but Friend's conveyance to Farmer would only be valid if Friend had good title. But Friend's title was junior because Friend had knowledge of Sister's prior conveyance. So Friend didn't have good title to pass to Farmer.

Wait, but maybe it's a chain of title issue. Let's map it out.

- Woman → Man (recorded Feb 1)
- Man → Sister (unrecorded until Feb 6)
- Man → Friend (recorded Feb 4, but Friend had actual knowledge of Sister's conveyance)
   - So Friend's title is junior to Sister's. Because in a notice state, a subsequent purchaser with notice is subordinate to a prior conveyance even if it's unrecorded.

So Friend's deed is junior to Sister's, so Friend doesn't have good title.

Then Friend conveys to Farmer on Feb 5. Farmer, when purchasing, doesn't have notice of Sister's conveyance (which hasn't been recorded yet). So Farmer would take the property subject to Sister's interest only if Farmer had notice.

But in a notice jurisdiction, if Farmer is a BFP, he would take free of prior unrecorded interests if he had no notice.

Wait, but Farmer is purchasing from Friend, whose own title was defective (because Friend had notice of Sister's prior interest). So Farmer can't get better title than Friend had.

Because in real property, you can't convey better title than you have. So if Friend's title was junior to Sister's, then Farmer gets whatever interest Friend had, which is junior.

So Farmer's interest is also junior to Sister's.

Wait, but let me think again. Farmer records on Feb 5, before Sister records on Feb 6.

So as of Feb 5, the records show:

- Woman to Man (Feb 1)
- Man to Friend (Feb 4)

There's no record of the Sister's conveyance yet. So when Farmer records on Feb 5, he's recording after Friend's conveyance but before Sister's.

In a notice statute, a subsequent BFP without notice will prevail over a prior unrecorded conveyance.

But Farmer is a subsequent purchaser from Friend. So, when Farmer takes the deed from Friend, what's the situation?

At the time Farmer bought (Feb 5), Sister's conveyance was unrecorded, and Farmer had no actual knowledge. So Farmer would qualify as a BFP, right? Because he had no notice, and the records didn't show Sister's deed yet.

So even though Friend had knowledge, Farmer didn't. So, when Farmer buys from Friend, Farmer's interest would be protected against Sister's prior unrecorded conveyance if Farmer is a BFP.

Wait, but this is where the Shelter Rule comes into play. The Shelter Rule allows a subsequent BFP to take the protection even if the prior grantor (Friend) had notice. So, Farmer, as a BFP, can 'shelter' under Friend's interest, even if Friend didn't have a clean title.

Wait, no. The Shelter Rule typically applies when someone takes from a BFP. So, for example, if A sells to B (who is a BFP), and then B sells to C, C can take under the Shelter Rule, even if B had notice. But in this case, Farmer is purchasing directly from Friend, who had notice. So would that affect Farmer's status as a BFP?

Wait, no. Because Farmer's status depends on whether he had notice when he took from Friend. If, when Farmer bought, he had no notice of Sister's conveyance, then regardless of Friend's knowledge, Farmer could be a BFP.

But wait, Friend had knowledge when he bought from Man, but when Friend sells to Farmer, Farmer's knowledge is what matters.

In a notice jurisdiction, each purchaser's knowledge is considered at the time they take. So Farmer's lack of notice when he bought from Friend would make him a BFP, even if Friend had prior knowledge.

So, in that case, Farmer's interest would take priority over Sister's because Farmer is a BFP without notice, and he recorded before Sister recorded.

But wait, Sister's conveyance was from Feb 2, which was before Friend's conveyance. But since Friend had notice, Friend's interest is junior to Sister's.

When Friend conveys to Farmer, Farmer's interest would depend on whether he's a BFP. If Farmer is a BFP, he takes free of Sister's claim because he had no notice, and Sister's conveyance was unrecorded when Farmer took.

So, in this scenario:

- Sister has an unrecorded deed until Feb 6.
- Friend buys from Man on Feb 4, with knowledge of Sister's conveyance, so Friend's interest is behind Sister's.
- Farmer buys from Friend on Feb 5, without notice, and records on Feb 5.
- Sister records on Feb 6.

So, when Farmer records on Feb 5, the records do not yet show Sister's conveyance. So Farmer, as a BFP, would take priority over Sister because Sister's conveyance was unrecorded when he took, and he had no notice.

Additionally, under the Shelter Rule, even if Friend wasn't a BFP, Farmer, as a subsequent BFP, can take under the Shelter Rule. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the Shelter Rule says that if you are a BFP who takes from someone who isn't a BFP, you can still gain protection. For example, if A (original owner) → B (not a BFP) → C (BFP), then C is protected.

In this case, Farmer is C, who is a BFP, buying from Friend (B), who was not a BFP because Friend had notice. So Farmer can shelter under B's interest because he's a BFP.

Therefore, Farmer's interest would take priority over Sister's.

So, the final ownership would be Farmer, right? Because Farmer is a BFP who recorded before Sister did.

Wait, but Sister's conveyance was on Feb 2, which is earlier than Friend's on Feb 4. But because Friend had notice, Friend's interest is junior. But Farmer, buying from Friend, is a BFP, so Farmer's interest is senior to Sister's.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in the chain, Sister's interest is prior in time to Friend's, but because Friend had notice, Friend's is junior. Farmer, as a BFP, would take priority over Sister.

So, the order would be:

1. Sister's interest is from Feb 2, but unrecorded until Feb 6.
2. Friend's interest from Feb 4, recorded on Feb 4, but junior to Sister's because Friend had notice.
3. Farmer's interest from Feb 5, recorded on Feb 5, and as a BFP, takes priority over Sister's unrecorded interest.

So, Farmer's interest would prevail over Sister's.

But wait, let me think about recording dates. Farmer recorded on Feb 5, Sister on Feb 6. In a notice jurisdiction, the recording isn't as crucial as notice, but it does provide constructive notice.

So, when Farmer records on Feb 5, if someone else (like Sister) later records, does that affect Farmer? No, because Farmer's recording comes first.

But in this case, when Sister records on Feb 6, she's recording after Farmer. So, Farmer's interest is already on record, so Sister can't affect Farmer.

Wait, but in a notice jurisdiction, the rule is that a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice and records first will prevail, regardless of when the prior conveyance was recorded.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. In a notice statute, the subsequent BFP who takes without notice and records will prevail over a prior unrecorded conveyance, even if the prior conveyance is later recorded.

So, in this case:

Sister's conveyance is prior in time (Feb 2) but unrecorded until Feb 6.

Farmer's conveyance is subsequent in time (Feb 5), but Farmer is a BFP (no notice), and records before Sister does.

So, Farmer's interest would take priority over Sister's.

Thus, Farmer would own the farm.

Wait, but what about the Man's original conveyance to Sister? Man conveyed to Sister before Friend. So, Man no longer had title when he conveyed to Friend on Feb 4. If Man didn't have title, then Friend gets nothing, and Farmer gets nothing from Friend.

Wait, that's a different angle. Let's think about whether Man had the authority to convey to Friend on Feb 4.

When Man conveyed to Sister on Feb 2, he transferred title to her. So, when he later conveyed to Friend on Feb 4, he was transferring title he no longer had. So, the conveyance to Friend would be a wild deed, meaning Friend gets nothing because Man had already sold the property to Sister.

But wait, recording comes into play here. Because Sister didn't record until Feb 6, but Friend recorded on Feb 4.

If the state is a notice jurisdiction, then Friend, when he took the conveyance from Man on Feb 4, had actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to Sister. So, Friend cannot be a BFP because he had actual knowledge, making his deed junior to Sister's.

So, Friend's deed, even though recorded earlier, is subordinate to Sister's because Friend had notice.

Then, when Friend conveys to Farmer on Feb 5, Farmer, who had no notice, would take under the Shelter Rule.

Wait, the Shelter Rule says that a BFP can take under a prior defective title if they are a BFP. So if Friend wasn't a BFP, but Farmer is, then Farmer can take.

But if Man had already conveyed to Sister, then Friend's title was defective because Man didn't have title anymore. So, when Friend sells to Farmer, who is a BFP, Farmer can take good title despite Friend's defective title.

So, in that case, Farmer would own the farm, because he's a BFP without notice, and he recorded before Sister did.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me try to outline the possibilities.

Option 1: Sister has the best claim because she was the first to receive the conveyance, even though she didn't record until later. But in a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent BFP without notice can take priority.

Option 2: Farmer, as a BFP, takes priority over Sister because he had no notice and recorded before her.

Additionally, under the Shelter Rule, even if Friend had a defective title, Farmer as a BFP can take good title.

So, putting it all together:

- Sister's conveyance is first in time but unrecorded until after Farmer records.

- Friend's conveyance is second, but he had notice, so his interest is subordinate to Sister's.

- Farmer buys from Friend, but is a BFP because he had no notice when he bought.

- Farmer records before Sister does.

Thus, Farmer's interest would take priority over Sister's.

Wait, but if Man didn't have title when he sold to Friend, because he already sold to Sister, then Friend had nothing to sell to Farmer. So, Farmer gets nothing.

But in a notice jurisdiction, if the subsequent purchaser (Farmer) is a BFP, they can take even if the prior conveyance was unrecorded but earlier. So, perhaps Farmer would take over Sister.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to apply the recording statute step by step.

In a notice jurisdiction, the rule is that a subsequent BFP for value without notice will take free of earlier unrecorded conveyances.

So, Sister's conveyance was on Feb 2, unrecorded until Feb 6.

Farmer's conveyance was on Feb 5, from Friend, who had a defective title because he had notice of Sister's conveyance.

But Farmer, when he took from Friend, did not have notice, so he's a BFP.

So, Farmer's interest would take priority over Sister's because Farmer is a subsequent BFP without notice.

So, the ultimate owner would be Farmer.

But wait, what about the fact that Friend had notice? Because when Friend bought from Man, he knew about Sister's conveyance, so Friend's title was defective. But when Friend sold to Farmer, Farmer didn't know, so Farmer's title is protected.

So, Farmer gets the farm, Sister is out because she didn't record in time, and her conveyance was unrecorded when Farmer took as a BFP.

So, looking at the options, the question is which parties would ultimately prevail. The options are about which parties' interests are valid.

Let me look at the options again:

Options:

A: The man and the farmer.

B: The sister and the friend.

C: The friend.

D: The man.

E: None of the above.

F: The woman.

G: The sister.

H: Both the man and the friend.

I: The farmer.

J: Both the sister and the farmer.

Wait, so if Farmer prevails, the answer would be I.

But wait, let me think again. The sister's conveyance was prior, but Farmer is a BFP. So Farmer would take over Sister.

But the sister's deed was unrecorded when Farmer bought, and Farmer had no notice. So yes, Farmer's interest is better.

Thus, the answer would be I: The farmer.

Wait, but I need to make sure. Let me think of it another way.

In a notice jurisdiction:

- The first in time to record (without notice of prior claims) prevails.

But in this case, the first in time is Sister, but she didn't record until after Farmer.

Farmer, as a subsequent purchaser, is a BFP because he had no notice. So, under the recording statute, Farmer's interest takes priority over Sister's unrecorded interest.

So, yes, Farmer would prevail.

So, the correct answer is I: The farmer.
</think>

In a notice-type jurisdiction, the priority of property interests is determined by whether a purchaser is a bona fide purchaser (BFP) who takes without notice of prior unrecorded conveyances and records promptly. The key events and their implications are as follows:

1. **February 1**: The woman conveys the farm to the man, and the man records the conveyance. The man is now the recorded owner.
2. **February 2**: The man conveys the farm to the sister, but the sister does not record her deed until February 6. At this point, the sister has an unrecorded interest.
3. **February 4**: The man conveys the farm to the friend, who records the deed on February 4. However, the friend has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the sister, so the friend’s interest is subordinate to the sister’s interest under the notice statute.
4. **February 5**: The friend conveys
