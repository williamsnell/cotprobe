Options:

A: Behavior is controlled by instinctual drives, learned skills, and random environmental events.

D: Behavior is controlled by external stimuli, by their consequences or by internal (symbolic) processes.
E: Behavior is controlled by financial status, educational background, and media consumption.
F: Behavior is controlled by subconscious desires, astrological influences, and peer pressure.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Bandura's behavior control systems. Hmm, I remember that Albert Bandura is a well-known psychologist, especially for his work on social learning theory. I think his theories are about how people learn behaviors by observing others and then imitating them. But wait, the question here is specifically about the three behavior control systems he promulgated in 1969.

Wait, Bandura... I think he proposed something about reciprocal determinism. Oh right, reciprocal determinism is his model where behavior, personal factors, and environmental factors all interact. But the question is about three systems controlling behavior.

Let me think. Oh, Bandura talked about three systems: external, internal, and something else. Oh wait, maybe it's external stimuli, consequences, and internal processes? Or perhaps it's more about control mechanisms.

Wait, another angle. I remember Bandura discussing self-regulation and observational learning. But the three systems... Maybe he categorized them into external, internal (like cognitive processes), and maybe some other factor.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: external stimuli, their consequences, or internal (symbolic) processes. That sounds familiar. External would be like environmental stimuli, consequences would be reinforcement or punishment, and internal would be things like thoughts and beliefs. That makes sense because Bandura's model includes both observable factors (external) and cognitive factors (internal).

Option A: Instinctual drives, learned skills, random events. Doesn't seem right. Bandura's more about learning and environment, not instincts.

Option B: Historical context, societal expectations, individual mood. Maybe related to other theories, not sure about Bandura.

Option C: Sensory perceptions, memory, future predictions. That feels more like cognitive processes but not the three systems.

Option E: Financial status, education, media. These are more sociodemographic factors, not the control systems.

Option F: Subconscious desires, astrology, peer pressure. No, astrology isn't part of Bandura.

Option G: Genetic, environment, personal experiences. That's more of a nature vs nurture approach.

Option H: Spiritual beliefs, physical needs, external rewards. Doesn't fit.

Option I: Personal beliefs, social norms, culture. Maybe related, but I think the correct one is D.

So I'm leaning towards option D as the correct answer.

The question asks about the three behavior control systems proposed by Bandura in 1969. Bandura's work emphasizes the interaction between behavior, personal factors, and environmental factors, and he specifically identified three systems: external stimuli, their consequences, and internal (symbolic) processes. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** aligns with Bandura's theory, as it mentions external stimuli (environmental factors), consequences (reinforcement or punishment), and internal processes (cognitive factors like thoughts and beliefs). 
- Other options either focus on unrelated factors (e.g., instincts, astrology, financial status) or do not accurately represent Bandura's systems.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D: Behavior is controlled by external stimuli, by their consequences or by internal (symbolic) processes.

Answer: D
