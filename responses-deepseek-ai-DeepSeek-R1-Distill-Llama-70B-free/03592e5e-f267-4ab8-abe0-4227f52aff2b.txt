Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the total charge of a certain number of electrons. Hmm, let's see. The question says: What's the total charge in coulombs of 75.0 kg of electrons? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Alright, I remember that each electron has a charge, and I think it's a negative charge. Oh right, the elementary charge is about -1.6 times 10^-19 coulombs. So I need to find out how many electrons are in 75 kg and then multiply by that charge.

Wait, but how do I find the number of electrons? Oh right, I should use the mass of an electron. I think the mass of a single electron is approximately 9.11 x 10^-31 kilograms. So I can use these two values to calculate the total charge.

Let me outline the steps. First, calculate the number of electrons in 75 kg. Then multiply by the charge per electron.

So number of electrons N = total mass / mass per electron. That would be N = 75.0 kg / (9.11e-31 kg/electron). Once I have N, multiply by the charge per electron, which is -1.6e-19 C per electron.

Wait, but let's make sure I get the exponents right. Let me compute that step by step.

Calculating N first: 75 divided by 9.11e-31. Let's see, 75 / 9.11 is about... 75/9 is roughly 8.333, so 75/9.11 is a bit less than that, maybe around 8.25. So 8.25e31? Because dividing by 1e-31 is the same as multiplying by 1e31. So N is approximately 8.25e31 electrons.

Wait, let me do that more accurately. 9.11 times 8 is 72.88, which is less than 75. The difference is about 2.12. So 2.12 /9.11 is approximately 0.23. So N is approximately 8.23e31 electrons. Close enough for now.

Then the total charge Q is N multiplied by charge per electron, which is -1.6e-19 C. So Q = 8.23e31 * (-1.6e-19) C.

Let me compute that. 8 times 1.6 is 12.8, and 0.23 times 1.6 is about 0.368. So total is 12.8 + 0.368 = 13.168. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 8.23e31 * 1.6e-19 = (8.23 *1.6) * (1e31 * 1e-19) )= 13.168 * 1e12. Oh wait, because 1e31 *1e-19 is 1e12.

So 13.168e12 coulombs. But since the charge is negative, that's -1.3168e13 C, right?

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute 8.23e31 * 1.6e-19 exactly. 8.23 *1.6 = let's compute that. 8 *1.6 is 12.8, 0.23 *1.6 is 0.368. So 12.8 + 0.368 = 13.168. So 13.168e12 C, which is 1.3168e13 C. But since electrons are negative, the charge is -1.3168e13 C.

Looking at the options, option B is -1.32e13 C. Hmm, that's very close. So probably, the correct answer is B.

Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should do it more precisely.

The mass of an electron is 9.10938356 ×10^-31 kg. So 75 kg divided by that.

75 / 9.10938356e-31 = let's compute that.

75 / 9.10938356 ≈ let's approximate 9.109 as 9.11. So 75 /9.11 ≈ 8.235. So 8.235e31 electrons.

Charge per electron: 1.602176634e-19 C. So more precisely, 1.602e-19 instead of 1.6.

So let's compute N * charge:

8.235e31 * 1.602e-19 = (8.235 * 1.602) * 1e12.

Calculating 8.235 * 1.602.

8 * 1.602 = 12.816.

0.235 *1.602: Let's compute that. 0.2 *1.602 = 0.3204, 0.035 *1.602=0.05607. So total 0.3204 +0.05607=0.37647.

So total is 12.816 +0.37647 =13.19247.

So 13.19247e12 C = 1.319247e13 C.

Rounding to three significant figures, since the given mass (75.0 kg) has three significant figures. So 1.32e13 C. But the charge is negative, so -1.32e13 C.

Looking at the options, option B is -1.32e13 C. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option B is written as -1.32 10^13 C. So yeah, correct.

So I think the correct answer is B.

To calculate the total charge of 75.0 kg of electrons, we start by determining the number of electrons in that mass. The mass of a single electron is approximately \( 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \), so the number of electrons \( N \) is given by:

\[
N = \frac{\text{total mass}}{\text{mass per electron}} = \frac{75.0 \, \mathrm{kg}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg/electron}} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{31} \, \mathrm{electrons}.
\]

Next, the charge per electron is \( -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \). The total charge \( Q \) is then:

\[
Q = N \times \text{charge per electron} = (8.23 \times 10^{31}) \times (-1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
Q = -1.32 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

This matches option B, which is \( -1.32 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{C} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B**
