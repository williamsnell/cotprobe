Okay, so I have this problem about partitioning a set of 6 distinct letters into 3 non-empty groups, and each group must have at least 2 letters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but let's try to think this through.

First, I remember that when you're partitioning a set into groups, the order of the groups matters or not, depending on whether the groups are distinguishable. In this case, I think the groups are indistinct because the problem doesn't mention any specific labeling or order for them. So it's more like an unordered partition.

Each group must have at least 2 letters, and there are 6 letters total. Let's see, the possible ways to split 6 into 3 groups each with at least 2. So the possible group sizes are 2,2,2, right? Because 2+2+2=6. If I tried other combinations like 3,2,1, but wait, that's not allowed because each group must have at least 2 letters. So the only possible way is three groups of 2 each.

Wait, so the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to split 6 distinct letters into three groups of two, where the order of the groups doesn't matter.

I think the formula for this is something like (6!)/( (2! * 2! * 2!) ) divided by 3! because the groups are indistinct. Let me break it down.

So first, the number of ways to choose the first group of 2 letters is C(6,2) = 15. Then, from the remaining 4 letters, choose 2 for the second group: C(4,2)=6. The last two form the third group: C(2,2)=1. So the total would be 15*6*1=90. But wait, since the order of the groups doesn't matter, we have to divide by the number of ways to arrange the groups, which is 3! =6. So 90 /6 =15. So the answer would be 15, which is option D.

Wait a second, but wait. Alternatively, another approach is to use multinomial coefficients. The multinomial coefficient for dividing n items into groups of sizes k1, k2, ..., km is n!/(k1!k2!...km!). So here, it's 6!/(2!2!2!)= 720/(8) =90. But since the groups are indistinct, we divide by 3! because the order doesn't matter. So 90/6=15. Yep, same as before.

So the answer should be 15, which is option D.

To determine the number of ways to partition a set of 6 distinct letters into 3 non-empty groups, where each group contains at least 2 letters, we first note that the only possible group sizes are 2, 2, and 2 (since 2+2+2=6 and smaller groups are not allowed).

The problem involves dividing 6 distinct items into three indistinct groups of equal size (2 each). The formula for this is:

\[
\frac{\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2}}{3!}
\]

Here:
- \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\) ways to choose the first group of 2 letters.
- \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) ways to choose the second group of 2 letters from the remaining 4.
- \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to form the third group from the last 2 letters.
- The division by \(3!\) accounts for the fact that the groups are indistinct, so we must divide by the number of ways to arrange the groups.

Calculating:

\[
\frac{15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1}{6} = 15
\]

Thus, the number of ways to partition the set is **15**, which corresponds to option **D**.
