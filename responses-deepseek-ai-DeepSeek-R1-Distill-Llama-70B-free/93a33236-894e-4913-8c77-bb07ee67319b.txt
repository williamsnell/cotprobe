Okay, so I've got this problem about laminar film condensation on a vertical surface. Hmm, I remember that when a vapor condenses on a surface, it forms a liquid film, right? And this process is laminar, so it's a smooth, continuous flow without turbulence.

The question gives me some specific values. The steam is at 1.43 psi, which I think is the pressure. Wait, what's the saturation temperature here? Oh right, it's given as 114°F. So that makes sense because at a certain pressure, the steam will condense at a specific temperature.

The wall temperature is 105°F. Wait, but the saturation temperature is higher than the wall temp. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, if the steam is at 1.43 psi, its saturation temperature is 114°F. But the wall is at 105°F, which is lower. So the steam will condense on the wall because the wall is cooler than the steam's saturation temperature.

The question is about finding the coefficient of heat transfer (h) at a point 3 inches from the top. Oh, right, in film condensation, the heat transfer coefficient varies along the surface. So the position matters.

I remember that for laminar film condensation on a vertical surface, there's a correlation formula. I think it's something like h = (k * (rho * g * (T_sat - T_wall) * (h_fg)) / (mu * (T_sat - T_wall) * L)) )^(1/4), wait maybe I'm mixing the terms. Alternatively, the formula might involve some constants and the Grashof number. Alternatively, perhaps the Nusselt number comes into play.

Wait, the Nusselt number (Nu) for film condensation on a vertical plate is given by Nu = ( (4 * Gr * Pr) )^(1/4) ) / ( (1 + (3 Pr)/(4 Gr^(1/4)) )) ), but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, I think the simpler formula is Nu = ( (h_fg * rho * g * (T_sat - T_wall) ) / (k * mu * (T_sat - T_wall)) )^(1/4) * something... Maybe I should think again.

Wait another approach. I remember that for vertical surfaces, the average Nusselt number is given by Nu = ( (4 Gz ) / ( (1 + 8 Gz )^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/2) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Nusselt number is given by Nu = ( (Gr Pr )^(1/4) ) * (some factor), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the local heat transfer coefficient in laminar film condensation on a vertical surface. I think it's h = ( (k^3 rho^2 g (T_sat - T_wall) h_fg) / (mu^2 (T_sat - T_wall) x) ) )^(1/4) * (4/3) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the general formula.

The formula I remember is h = ( (k^3 rho^2 g (T_sat - T_w) h_fg) / (mu^2 T_w x) )^(1/4) * something. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the variables wrong.

Alternatively, I think the local Nusselt number for a vertical surface is Nu = ( (4 Gr Pr )^(1/4) ), but I'm not fully confident. Oh wait, Grashof number Gr is (rho g (T_sat - T_w) x^3 ) / mu^2. Prandtl number is Pr = (mu cp)/k.

Wait, wait. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, I need the properties of the steam at the saturation temperature. The saturation temperature is 114°F, which is at 1.43 psi. I think I need to look up the saturated steam tables for these properties. But wait, I don't have the tables, so maybe I have to remember approximate values or use some standard data.

Wait, but wait, since the steam is super-saturated, does that affect anything? Hmm, super-saturated steam is actually dry steam, but I think in this context, since it's condensing, it's probably just referring to the steam being at the saturation condition. Maybe it's a typo or perhaps it's just steam at saturation.

But moving on, the wall is at 105°F. So delta T is 114 - 105 = 9°F. Wait, but in calculations, we need to convert temperatures to absolute, right? So 114°F is (114 - 32) *5/9 = 82.222°C. Wait, 9/5 is 1.8, so 114 F is 46°C (wait 32+46=78? No wait, 100°C is 212°F, so 114 F is 114-32 =82 F. 82 *5/9 ≈45.555°C. So about 45.56°C.

Similarly, the wall is 105°F, which is 40.555°C (105-32=73, 73*5/9≈40.555°C). So delta T is 45.56 - 40.555 ≈5°C. Wait, no, 114°F is 45.56°C, 105°F is 40.56°C, so the difference is 5°C, which is 9°F as given.

Wait, no. Wait, 114 F is 45.56°C, and 105 F is 40.56°C. So the delta T is 45.56 -40.56 =5°C. So 5°C is 9°F. So I think using delta T in Kelvin would be the same as °C, so 5 K.

Hmm, but the formula for h would require the use of absolute temperatures or in °C? I think in the formulas, the temperature difference is in absolute terms, but perhaps the way the formula uses it, it's okay.

So, the point is 3 inches from the top. But since the surface is vertical, the distance x is measured from the top, so it's 3 inches. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, no, in film condensation, the liquid flows downward, so the point 3 inches from the top would have a certain film thickness. Alternatively, the position could be given as x, which is the vertical distance from the top, but I'm not sure. Wait, the formula uses x as the distance from the top, but sometimes it's from the leading edge.

Wait, no, in vertical surfaces, the film starts at the top, so x is the distance from the top. So here, x is 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet.

Wait, no, 3 inches is 0.25 feet, right? Because 1 foot is 12 inches, so 3/12 = 0.25 ft.

So, x = 0.25 ft.

Now, I need to find the heat transfer coefficient h at this position.

I think the formula for the local heat transfer coefficient for laminar film condensation on a vertical plate is:

h = ( (k^3 * rho^2 * g * (T_sat - T_wall) * h_fg ) / (mu^2 * x) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula might be:

h = ( (k^3 * (rho (rho - rho_vap) g) * (T_sat - T_wall) * h_fg ) ) / (mu^2 * x) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but maybe rho_vap is negligible, so it's approximated as rho^2 g.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the Nusselt number for a vertical plate is:

Nu = ( (4 * Gr * Pr ) )^(1/4 )

Where Gr is the Grashof number, and Pr is the Prandtl number.

The Grashof number Gr = (rho^2 g (T_sat - T_wall) x^3 ) / mu^2.

Prandtl number Pr = mu * cp / k.

But wait, in this case, the properties are for the liquid, because it's the liquid film that's conducting the heat.

So, the properties I need are for saturated liquid at 114°F. Let's see, what are those properties approximately?

Wait, I might have to approximate these values. Let's see:

At 1 atm (14.7 psi), water boils at 212°F. At lower pressures, the boiling point is lower. At 1.43 psi, the saturation temp is 114°F. So, the properties of water at around 100°F to 120°F would be relevant.

Looking for approximate values:

- Density of liquid water (rho) around 100°F: say about 55 lbm/ft^3. Wait, at 60°F, it's about 61.2 lbm/ft^3; at 100°F, around 57.7 lbm/ft^3. Maybe let's take 57 lbm/ft^3.

Wait, but maybe more accurately, the density of water at 104°F is about 57.3 lbm/ft³, but I'm not certain. Let's say 57 lbm/ft³.

- Viscosity (mu) of water at around 100°F is about 0.000028 lbm/(ft·s) or 28 centiPoise. Wait, 1 Poise is 0.1 Pa·s, but in lbm/(ft·s), water at 100°F is about 0.000028 lbm/(ft·s).

Wait, better to convert to consistent units. Let me think: 1 lbm/(ft·hr) is (1/3600) lbm/(ft·s). Oh wait, no, 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, for example, 1 lbm/(ft·s) = 3600 lbm/(ft·hr).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to work in SI units, but the question asks for the answer in Btu/hr-ft²-°F, so maybe I should stick with IP units.

But perhaps I should look up the exact properties. Since I can't, I'll proceed with approximate values.

So, let me list the needed properties:

- rho (liquid density) = approx 57 lbm/ft³

- mu (dynamic viscosity) = approx 0.000028 lbm/(ft·s)

- k (thermal conductivity) = approx 0.038 Btu/(hr·ft·°F) (since at 100°F, it's around 0.038)

- h_fg (latent heat of vaporization) = approximately 1037 Btu/lbm? Wait, at 1 atm, it's about 970 Btu/lbm. At lower pressures, it's higher. Since 1.43 psi is lower than atmospheric pressure, so maybe higher than 970. Let me think, perhaps around 1050 Btu/lbm. Let's say 1050.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the latent heat is around 1000 Btu/lbm.

But perhaps I should proceed with the values I have.

So, let's plug into the formula:

h = [ (k^3 * rho^2 * g * (T_sat - T_wall) * h_fg ) / (mu^2 * x) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

h = [ (k^3 * (rho^2 - rho_vapor^2) * g * (T_sat - T_wall) * h_fg ) / (mu^2 * x) ]^(1/4 )

But since rho_vapor is much smaller than rho_liquid, we can approximate rho^2 as rho_liquid^2.

So, proceed.

First, let's compute each term.

k = 0.038 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)

rho = 57 lbm/ft³

g = 32.2 ft/s² (approximate)

T_sat - T_wall = 114 - 105 = 9°F. But wait, in the formula, should it be in Kelvin? Because when you're dealing with equations involving latent heat and such, sometimes absolute temperature is needed, but in this case, the temperature difference might just be in the same units as long as it's consistent.

Wait, but in the formula, the (T_sat - T_wall) term is a temperature difference, so it can be in either °F or °C as a difference, because both are intervals, not absolute. So 9°F is equivalent to 5°C, but as a difference, it's the same as 5 K. Wait, no, 9°F is not exactly 5 K. Wait, 1°F is 5/9 K. So 9°F difference is 5 K. So perhaps I should use 5 K for calculations, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula might require the temperature difference in absolute units, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is dimensionally consistent regardless, but I might be overcomplicating. Let's proceed with the temperature difference in °F for now.

h_fg = 1050 Btu/lbm

mu = 0.000028 lbm/(ft·s)

x = 0.25 ft

So, let's compute the numerator and denominator.

First, compute k^3: (0.038)^3 = 0.038 * 0.038 = 0.001444, then * 0.038 = approx 0.000054872 Btu³/(hr³·ft³·°F³)

Wait, but wait, the units might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each part step by step.

Numerator inside the square root:

k^3 = (0.038)^3 = 0.00005487 (Btu/(hr·ft·°F))^3

rho^2 = (57)^2 = 3249 lbm²/ft^6

g = 32.2 ft/s²

(T_sat - T_wall) =9°F (but I'm not sure about the units here; perhaps it's better to convert to Rankine, but maybe the formula uses it as a difference, so it's okay.)

h_fg = 1050 Btu/lbm

So, the numerator terms multiplied together:

k^3 * rho^2 * g * (T_sat - T_wall) * h_fg

= 0.00005487 * 3249 * 32.2 * 9 * 1050

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.00005487 * 3249 = 0.00005487 * 3249 ≈ 0.1783.

Then, multiply by 32.2: 0.1783 *32.2 ≈5.737.

Multiply by 9: 5.737 *9 ≈51.633.

Multiply by 1050: 51.633 *1050 ≈54214.65.

Denominator: mu^2 * x

mu^2: (0.000028)^2 = 7.84e-10 lbm²/(ft²·s²)

x = 0.25 ft

So denominator =7.84e-10 * 0.25 =1.96e-10.

Now, the entire fraction inside the 1/4 root is 54214.65 / 1.96e-10.

Wait, 54214.65 / 1.96e-10 = 54214.65 / 1.96e-10 ≈ 2.764e+15.

Now, take the 1/4 root of 2.764e+15.

Wait, what is the fourth root of 2.764e+15?

Well, let's think in terms of exponents. 1e15 is (1e3.75)^4, because 3.75*4=15. So 1e15^(1/4)=1e3.75= approx 5.623e3.

But 2.764e15 is approx 2.764 *1e15, so the fourth root is (2.764)^(1/4) * (1e15)^(1/4).

(2.764)^(1/4) is approximately 1.24, since 1.24^4 ≈ (1.24²)^2 = (1.5376)^2 ≈2.366, which is close to 2.764. Hmm, perhaps a bit higher. Let me compute 1.3^4: 1.3^2=1.69, then 1.69²≈2.856. That's higher than 2.764. So maybe around 1.28.

But perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps better to compute the natural logarithm.

ln(2.764e15) = ln(2.764) + 15 ln(10) ≈1.017 + 15*2.3026≈1.017 +34.539≈35.556.

Then, divide by 4: 35.556/4≈8.889.

Exponentiate: e^8.889≈7333.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was around 5.6e3. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Wait, 2.764e15 is 2.764 x10^15.

The fourth root is (2.764)^(0.25) * (10^15)^(0.25) = (approx 1.24) * (10^(3.75)).

10^3.75 is 10^(3 + 0.75) = 10^3 * 10^0.75 ≈1000 *5.623 ≈5623.

So, 1.24 *5623 ≈7000.

Wait, but earlier, when I used logarithms, I got 7333, which is close.

So, the fourth root is approximately 7000.

Thus, h≈7000 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but that seems really high compared to the options given.

Looking at the options, the highest is option A: 1,486 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Hmm, so 7000 is way higher than any option. That suggests I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Another approach: the Nusselt number for a vertical plate in laminar film condensation is given by:

Nu = ( (4 Gr Pr ) )^(1/4 )

Where Gr is Grashof number, and
