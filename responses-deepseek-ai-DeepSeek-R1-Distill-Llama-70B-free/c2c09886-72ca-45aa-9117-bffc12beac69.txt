Okay, so I've got this problem here about markup percentages. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that a tape deck sells for $200, and the dollar markup is $80. I need to find the percent markup based on the selling price. Hmm, okay, I remember that markup can be calculated in a couple of ways, but the question specifies it's based on the selling price, so I need to make sure I'm using the right formula.

First, let me recall what markup means. Markup is the amount added to the cost price to get the selling price. So the markup can be expressed in dollars (which is given here as $80) or as a percentage. The percentage is usually calculated based on either the cost or the selling price, and I think that's where I need to pay attention.

The formula for percent markup based on selling price is: (Markup / Selling Price) * 100. Wait, or is it based on cost? Oh right, sometimes it's based on cost. Let me double-check that.

Wait, no, I think when it's based on cost, the formula is (Markup / Cost) * 100. But in this problem, they want the markup based on the selling price, so the formula should be (Markup / Selling Price) * 100. 

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The markup is the difference between selling price and cost. So if the selling price is $200 and the markup is $80, that means the cost price must be $200 - $80 = $120. So cost is $120, markup is $80, selling price is $200.

If I want the percent markup based on cost, it would be ($80 / $120) * 100, which is about 66.67%. But the question isn't asking that; it's asking for the markup based on the selling price. So the formula should be (Markup / Selling Price) * 100. 

So plugging in the numbers: $80 / $200 = 0.4, which is 40%. So the percent markup based on selling price is 40%.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Another way to think about it is: if the selling price is $200 and the markup is $80, then the cost is $120. The markup as a percentage of the cost is (80/120)*100=66.67%, but again, the question is about the markup relative to the selling price.

So yes, 80 divided by 200 is 0.4, so 40% markup on the selling price. Looking at the options, option A is 40%, so that should be the correct answer.

To determine the percent markup based on the selling price, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percent Markup} = \left( \frac{\text{Markup}}{\text{Selling Price}} \right) \times 100
\]

Given:
- Selling Price = $200
- Markup = $80

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percent Markup} = \left( \frac{80}{200} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
\]

Thus, the percent markup based on the selling price is 40%.
