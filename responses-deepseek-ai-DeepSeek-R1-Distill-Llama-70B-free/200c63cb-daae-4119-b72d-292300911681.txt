Alright, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the future of houses. The question is asking about a house where you can operate almost everything from a central terminal, and it mentions that such houses are already in production and have a specific name. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to break down the question. The key points are that the house allows operating virtually everything from a central terminal and it's already being produced. The term we're looking for is the name of such a house.

I remember hearing terms like "smart house" and "intelligent house" in the context of technology-integrated homes. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Remotehouse. Hmm, that sounds like it's controlled remotely, maybe via a phone or something, but I'm not sure if that's the exact term used.

Option B: E-House. E could stand for electronic or energy-efficient, but I don't recall E-House being the standard term for this concept.

Option C: Digitalhouse. That makes sense because it's digital, but I'm not sure if that's the widely recognized term.

Option D: Compuhouse. Compu- relates to computers, which fits, but I don't think I've heard this term used commonly.

Option E: Autohouse. Auto usually refers to automatic, so maybe an automated house, but again, not sure if that's the specific term.

Option F: Smarthouse. Yes, I've definitely heard "smart house" before. It refers to homes with integrated technology systems that can be controlled centrally, like using a smartphone or a central terminal. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option G: IntelliHouse. That sounds like intelligent house, which is another term I've heard, but I'm not sure if it's the exact name used in production.

Option H: Technohouse. That's more about technology in general, but not specific to the integrated home system concept.

Option I: Cyberhouse. Cyber relates to internet or computing, but again, not the term I'm familiar with for this context.

Option J: Futurehouse. That's a bit generic, more about being futuristic rather than the specific technology integration.

So, between F (Smarthouse) and G (IntelliHouse), I'm leaning towards F because "smart house" is a more commonly used term. I think Smarthouse is the correct answer here. IntelliHouse might be a brand or specific product, but the more widely recognized term is Smarthouse.

The correct answer is F: Smarthouse. This term is widely recognized and refers to homes with integrated technology systems that can be controlled centrally. 

Answer: F
