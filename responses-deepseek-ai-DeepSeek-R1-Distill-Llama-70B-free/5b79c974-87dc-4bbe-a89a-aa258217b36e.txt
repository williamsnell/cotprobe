Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the molar entropy of neon at a higher temperature. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that neon is at a constant volume, and I need to find its molar entropy at 500 K. They give the entropy at 298 K as 146.22 J/(K·mol). So, I think I need to find the change in entropy when the temperature increases from 298 K to 500 K under constant volume.

Wait, right, for a constant volume process, the change in entropy can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1). Since we're dealing with molar values, n would be 1 mole, so the formula simplifies to ΔS = Cv ln(T2/T1).

But wait, what's the molar heat capacity at constant volume for neon? I remember that for monoatomic gases, the molar specific heat at constant volume (Cv) is (3/2)R. R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So (3/2)*8.314 would be... let me calculate that. 8.314 multiplied by 1.5 is about 12.471 J/(mol·K).

So Cv is approximately 12.471 J/(mol·K). Now, the temperatures are T1 = 298 K and T2 = 500 K. So the ratio T2/T1 is 500/298, which is roughly 1.6779.

Now, taking the natural logarithm of 1.6779. I think ln(1.6779) is approximately 0.517. Let me double-check that. Hmm, ln(1.6) is about 0.47, ln(1.7) is around 0.53. So 1.678 is closer to 1.68, so 0.52 approx? Maybe 0.517 is a good estimate.

So ΔS = 12.471 J/(mol·K) * 0.517 ≈ 6.457 J/(mol·K). So the entropy increases by about 6.457 J/(mol·K). 

Wait, because when temperature increases, entropy increases for a constant volume process, right? So the initial entropy S1 is 146.22, so S2 would be S1 + ΔS. So 146.22 + 6.457 equals approximately 152.68 J/(mol·K). 

Looking at the options, let's see. Option H is 152.67, which is very close to my calculation. So the answer should be H.

But wait, did I make any mistakes in the steps? Let me recap. I assumed that for a constant volume process, ΔS is calculated using Cv. Neon is monoatomic, so Cv is (3/2)R. I think that's correct. Then, I calculated Cv as 12.471. Then, ln(500/298) is about 0.517. Multiply those to get ΔS as approximately 6.457. Adding that to the initial entropy gives around 152.68, which matches option H.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate more accurately. Let me compute ln(500/298) more precisely. 500 divided by 298 is approximately 1.67785. Let me compute ln(1.67785). Using a calculator, ln(1.6778) is about 0.51715. So with more precise calculation, ΔS would be 12.471 * 0.51715 ≈ let's see.

12.471 * 0.5 is 6.2355, and 12.471 * 0.01715 is about 12.471 * 0.017 is approx 0.212, so total is about 6.447. So 6.447 added to 146.22 gives 152.667, which is 152.67, so option H again.

I think I did everything correctly. So yes, the answer should be H.

To calculate the molar entropy of neon at 500 K, we start with the given molar entropy at 298 K, which is \( S_1 = 146.22 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}} \). Since the process occurs at constant volume, the change in entropy is given by:

\[
\Delta S = C_v \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)
\]

For monoatomic gases like neon, the molar heat capacity at constant volume is \( C_v = \frac{3}{2}R \), where \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}} \). Thus:

\[
C_v = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 8.314 = 12.471 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}
\]

The temperatures are \( T_1 = 298 \, \mathrm{K} \) and \( T_2 = 500 \, \mathrm{K} \), so:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{500}{298} \approx 1.6779
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) = \ln(1.6779) \approx 0.517
\]

Now, calculate \( \Delta S \):

\[
\Delta S = C_v \cdot \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) = 12.471 \cdot 0.517 \approx 6.457 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}
\]

The molar entropy at 500 K is:

\[
S_2 = S_1 + \Delta S = 146.22 + 6.457 \approx 152.68 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**H: 152.67 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H**
