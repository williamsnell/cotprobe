Okay, so I have this question here about US presidents, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is asking who was the first US president to resign from office. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the US has had several presidents, and some have served full terms while others haven't. I know that resigning is not very common, but I do recall one president who did so. Let me think about the presidents I know.

I think Richard Nixon resigned. Was he the first? I'm pretty sure he was, but I'm not 100% certain. So, I should probably go through the options one by one to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Looking at the options:

A: Andrew Jackson. He was a tough president, known for the Indian Removal Act and the Trail of Tears. But I don't think he resigned. He served two terms, I believe, so he probably didn't resign.

B: George Washington. He was the first president and set the precedent by stepping down after two terms. But he didn't resign; he chose not to run for a third term.

C: Abraham Lincoln. He was assassinated during his second term, so he didn't resign. He's famous for leading the country through the Civil War.

D: Franklin D. Roosevelt. He served four terms, which was before the 22nd Amendment was ratified. He died in office, so he didn't resign either.

E: George W. Bush. He served two terms and left office without resigning. I don't think he resigned, so not him.

F: Thomas Jefferson. He served two terms and retired. Again, didn't resign.

G: Martin Van Buren. I'm not too familiar with him, but I don't think he resigned. He was president during the economic panic, but he served one term and lost re-election.

H: Richard Nixon. Yes, I remember now. He resigned because of the Watergate scandal. He was facing impeachment and likely removal from office, so he resigned in 1974. That makes him the first to resign.

I: John F. Kennedy. He was assassinated, so he didn't resign.

J: Andrew Johnson. He was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate, so he didn't resign. He served out his term.

So putting it all together, the first US president to resign was Richard Nixon. Looking back at the options, H is Richard Nixon. Therefore, the correct answer should be H.
