Okay, so I need to figure out what astrological sign someone would be if they were born on Halloween, which is October 31st. Hmm, I remember that astrological signs are based on the dates when the sun is in a particular zodiac constellation. Each sign has a specific date range.

Let me try to list the zodiac signs and their date ranges as I remember them. Starting from Aries, which is around March 21 to April 19. Taurus is next, from April 20 to May 20. Then comes Gemini, which I think is May 21 to June 21. Cancer is after that, so June 22 to July 22. Leo follows, July 23 to August 22. Virgo is August 23 to September 22. Then Libra, September 23 to October 22. Oh wait, so Libra ends on October 22. That means the next sign starts on October 23. 

What's after Libra? Oh right, Scorpio starts on October 23 and goes through November 21. So if someone was born on October 31st, that would fall under Scorpio because October 31 is after the 23rd. 

Let me double-check the dates. Libra is up to October 22, so the next day, October 23, is when Scorpio begins. So October 31 is definitely within Scorpio's range, which ends on November 21. 

Wait, are there any exceptions or cusp periods? I think the cusp is usually a few days before and after the start or end of a sign. But Halloween is the 31st, which is well into Scorpio's period. So yes, the sign would be Scorpio.

Looking back at the options, option B is Scorpio. So the correct answer should be B.

The astrological sign for someone born on October 31st is Scorpio because this date falls within the Scorpio zodiac period, which runs from October 23 to November 21.
