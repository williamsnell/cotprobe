Okay, I have this Python question to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking about the output of "abc"[-1] in Python 3. Hmm, I remember that in Python, strings can be accessed like arrays, right? So each character has an index.

Wait, indexes in Python are zero-based, so for "abc", index 0 is 'a', 1 is 'b', and 2 is 'c'. But wait, what about negative indexes? Oh right, negative indexes count from the end. So -1 refers to the last character, -2 the second last, and so on.

So if I have "abc", and I take the index -1, that should be 'c'. Let me think about the options given. The options are A to J. The correct answer should be 'c', which is option J.

Wait, let me double-check. If I write a small Python script: s = "abc", then print(s[-1]), the output would be 'c', right? Yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be J.

The output of "abc"[-1] in Python 3 is 'c' because negative indexing starts from the end of the string. Therefore, -1 refers to the last character.

Answer: J
