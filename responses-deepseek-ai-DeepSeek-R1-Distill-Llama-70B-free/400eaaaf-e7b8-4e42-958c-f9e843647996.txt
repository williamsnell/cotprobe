Okay, so I have this question about calculating the standard free energy for the oxidation of glucose. Hmm, I remember that the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for a reaction can be found using the standard free energies of formation of the products and reactants. Oh right, the formula is ΔG° = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants). 

The reaction given is C6H12O6(s) + 6O2(g) → 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l). So glucose is reacting with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. 

The values provided are:
- ΔGf° for glucose (C6H12O6) is -218 kcal/mol.
- ΔGf° for CO2 is -94.0 kcal/mol.
- ΔGf° for H2O(l) is -57.0 kcal/mol.
Oxygen (O2) is an element in its standard form, so its ΔGf° is 0.

Wait, so I need to calculate the sum for the products and subtract the sum for the reactants. 

Let's break it down. The products are 6 moles of CO2 and 6 moles of H2O. So for CO2, each mole contributes -94.0, so 6 * (-94) would be... let's see, 6*90 is 540, and 6*4 is 24, so 540 +24=564. But wait, 6*(-94) is -564. Similarly, H2O is 6 moles * (-57.0) each. 6*50 is 300, 6*7 is 42, so 342. So 6*(-57) is -342.

Adding those together, the products' total is -564 + (-342) = -906. 

Now the reactants: Glucose is 1 mole, so -218, and O2 is 6 moles but each is 0, so total reactants is -218 + 0 = -218.

So ΔG° = (sum products) - (sum reactants) = (-906) - (-218) = -906 + 218 = -688 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option B is -688. So the answer should be B.

To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the oxidation of glucose, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \Sigma \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \Sigma \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]

The reaction is:

\[
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6(s) + 6\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 6\text{CO}_2(g) + 6\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
\]

Given data:
- ΔGf° for C₆H₁₂O₆(s) = -218 kcal/mol
- ΔGf° for CO₂(g) = -94.0 kcal/mol
- ΔGf° for H₂O(l) = -57.0 kcal/mol
- ΔGf° for O₂(g) = 0 (element in standard form)

### Step 1: Calculate the total ΔGf° for products
- For CO₂: \( 6 \times (-94.0) = -564 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)
- For H₂O: \( 6 \times (-57.0) = -342 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)
- Total for products: \( -564 + (-342) = -906 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the total ΔGf° for reactants
- For C₆H₁₂O₆: \( -218 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)
- For O₂: \( 6 \times 0 = 0 \)
- Total for reactants: \( -218 + 0 = -218 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)

### Step 3: Calculate ΔG°
\[
\Delta G^\circ = (-906) - (-218) = -906 + 218 = -688 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The standard free energy for the oxidation of glucose is **-688 kcal/mol**, which corresponds to option **B**.
