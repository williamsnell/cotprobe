Okay, so I've got this question about codon substitutions, right? It's a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step. I think I remember that codons are sequences of three nucleotides that correspond to specific amino acids. So the question is asking what's the minimum number of base substitutions needed to change certain amino acids into others. 

The question has five parts: a) glutamic acid to lysine, b) leucine to alanine, c) phenylalanine to glycine, d) tryptophan to serine, and e) valine to glutamic acid. I need to figure out each one, and then match them to the given options.

First, I think I should probably look up the codon tables for each of these amino acids. I remember that some amino acids are encoded by multiple codons, so maybe there's a way to find the shortest path by changing the fewest bases.

Starting with part a) glutamic acid to lysine. Glutamic acid is Glu, and lysine is Lys. From what I recall, Glu is coded by GAA and GAG. Lys is AAA and AAG. So looking at these codons: GAA vs AAA. The first two bases are GA vs AA. So to change GAA to AAA, we'd need to change the second base from A to A? Wait, no, GAA is G-A-A, changing the first G to A would make it AAA. That's one substitution. Alternatively, GAG to AAG would require changing the first G to A, that's also one substitution. So a) can be done with one substitution.

Moving on to part b) leucine to alanine. Leucine is Leu, which has several codons: UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG. Alanine is Ala, with codons GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG. So I need to find the closest codon between Leu and Ala. Let's see. For instance, if I take a Leu codon like CUU. Change the first C to G, making GUU, but wait, GUU is Val, not Ala. Hmm. Maybe another approach. Looking for any Leu codon that can become Ala with minimal changes. Let's see: Leu has CUA, CUG... Let me think of the third base. Oh, wait, maybe UUA. If I change the first base from U to G, it becomes GUA, which is Val still. Alternatively, changing the second base: UUA to UCA would be Ser. Not helpful. Maybe CUG to GCG? CUG is Leu. Change C to G, GUG, which is Val. Hmm. Alternatively, let's think of the third base. Wait, another idea: Leu's CUA could change the first base from C to G, making GUA (Val). No. Or maybe the second base. CUA changing the second U to C, making CCA, which is Pro. No. Maybe I'm not looking right. Let me think of the Ala codons: GCT, GCC, etc. So if I can find a Leu codon that's one base away. Let's see: Leu has CUG. If I change the first C to G, GUG is Val. Alternatively, change the second U to C, making CGG, which is Arg. Not helpful. Wait, what about UUA. If I change the third A to G, it becomes UUG, which is another Leu. No. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe a Leu codon like CUU. If I change the C to A, making AUU which is Ile. No. Alternatively, change the U in the middle: CUU to CAU is His. Not right. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the minimum substitutions are two. Because maybe you have to change two bases. For example, CUU to GCU: change C to G and U to C? Wait, that's two substitutions. Or maybe another pair. Alternatively, Leu's CUG to Ala's GCG: the first C to G, and the second U to C. So that's two substitutions. So b) might require two changes.

Wait, but wait. Are there any Leu codons that are just one base away from an Ala codon? Let me check again. For example, Leu's CUA. If I change the third A to a G, it becomes CUG, which is still Leu. No. Or change the second U to C: CCA is Pro. Not. Maybe UUA: change the third A to C, making UUC, which is Phe. No. Alternatively, change the first U to G, making GUA, which is Val. Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck here. Wait, another thought: Some sources say that some codons are only one substitution away. Let me think of the third base. Maybe the third base is wobble. Wait, but for substitutions, I think we're talking about the actual DNA changes, not just the RNA wobble. So perhaps Leu to Ala needs two substitutions.

Now part c) phenylalanine to glycine. Phe is codons UUU and UUC. Gly is GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG. So looking for the minimal changes. Let's take UUU. To turn it into any Gly codon. GGU is different in all three positions except maybe the third. UUU to GGU: change U to G in first position, U to G in second, and U to U in third. Wait, that's two substitutions. Alternatively, UUU to GGU requires first and second bases to change. So that's two substitutions. Or UUC to GGU: same thing. Wait, but what if I change UUU to GUU? That's Val, not Gly. Alternatively, changing UUU to AGU? No, that's Ser. Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let's see Gly's codons: GGA is G-G-A. So, Phe's UUU: change first U to G, second U to G, third U to A. That's three changes. Hmm. Alternatively, is there a Phe codon that can be changed with just one substitution to a Gly codon? Like, perhaps UUA is Leu, but that's not helpful. Wait, no. So perhaps the minimal substitutions are three? Or maybe two? Wait, another thought: Gly's codons are GGN. So for UUU to become GGU, you need to change the first two Us to Gs. That's two substitutions. So c) would require two substitutions.

Wait, but wait. Are there any Gly codons that can be reached by a single substitution from Phe's codons? Let's see: UUU. If I change the first U to G, it becomes GUU, which is Val. Second substitution would change the second U to G, making GGU (Gly). So that's two substitutions. So yes, two substitutions are needed for c).

Wait, but hang on. Another possibility: Suppose the codon is UUC. If I change the third C to G, it becomes UUG, which is Leu. No. Alternatively, change the first U to G, making GUC, which is Val. No. So I think it's two substitutions.

Okay, moving on to part d) tryptophan to serine. Trp is UGG. Ser is UCA, UCU, AGU, AGC, etc. So UGG to any Ser codon. Let's see, the closest would be AGC. Let's compare: UGG vs AGC. So first base: U vs A (change needed). Second base: G vs G (same). Third base: G vs C (change needed). So that's two substitutions. Alternatively, UGG to UCA: first base same (U), second G to C (change), third G to A (change). So two substitutions again. Or UGG to AGU: first U to A (change), second G to G (same), third G to U (change). So two substitutions as well. So d) requires two substitutions.

Wait, but wait. Are there any Ser codons that can be reached with just one substitution from UGG? Let's think. UGG changing third G to C would make UGC, which is Cys. No. Changing second G to C would make UCG, which is Ser? Wait, UCG is Ser! Oh wait, yes! UCG is a Ser codon. So UGG to UCG: change the second G to C. So that's just one substitution. So d) can be done with one substitution. Oh, I see. I didn't think of that earlier. So that's a key point.

Finally, part e) valine to glutamic acid. Val is VAL, codons GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG. Glu is GAA, GAG. So, looking for the minimal substitutions. Let's take a Val codon like GUU. To make it into GAA or GAG. Let's see: GUU to GAA. Compare each base:

G U U
G A A

So first G is same. Second U to A: substitution. Third U to A: substitution. So two substitutions. Alternatively, GUU to GAG: second U to A, third U to G. That's two substitutions as well. 

Is there a Val codon that can reach Glu with only one substitution? Let's see: GUA. If I change the third A to G, it becomes GUG, which is Val still. No. Or GUC: change the third C to A, GUA (Val again). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe another Val codon. Let's take GUG. To make it GAG: change third G to A? No, GAG is Glu. Wait, GUG is Val, and GAG is Glu. So GUG to GAG: change the third G to A. That's one substitution. Oh wait, but wait: GUG is a Val codon. Changing the third base from G to A would make it GAG, which is Glu. So that's only one substitution. So part e) can be done with one substitution.

Wait, but wait. So if the Val codon is GUG, changing the third G to A makes it GAG (Glu). So that's one substitution. But what if the codon is GUU? Then it would take two. But the question is about the minimum number of substitutions, so if any codon for Val can be changed to any codon for Glu with one substitution, then the answer for e) is one.

So putting it all together:

a) Glu to Lys: 1 substitution.

b) Leu to Ala: 2 substitutions.

c) Phe to Gly: 2 substitutions.

d) Trp to Ser: 1 substitution.

e) Val to Glu: 1 substitution.

Now let's look at the options. The options are from A to J, each giving substitution counts for each part a to e.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: 1 for phenylalanine to glycine, 2 for the rest. So a is 1, b is 2, c is 1, others 2. Doesn't match our findings because a) is 1, b) 2, c) 2, d)1, e)1. So A is incorrect.

Option B: 2 for a, 3 for b, 1 for c, 1 for d, 3 for e. So a=2, b=3. Doesn't match.

Option C: 1 for all. But our a is 1, but others vary. So no.

Option D: 1 for b, 2 for a, c, e; 3 for d. Doesn't fit.

Option E: 2 for all. No, because a is 1, d is 1, e is 1.

Option F: a=2, b=1, c=1, d=2, e=2. No, we have a=1, b=2, etc.

Option G: 3 for b, 1 for others. No, because b is 2, c is 2.

Option H: 1 for a and d, 3 for others. No.

Option I: a=1, b=2, c=2, d=1, e=1. Let's see: the options are a is 1, b is 2, c is 2, d is 1, e is 1. Does any option match this? Let's look at each option.

Looking at option I: It says 1 for a, 2 for b, 2 for c, 1 for d, 1 for e. So that's exactly what we have. So option I is a:1, b:2, c:2, d:1, e:1.

But wait, looking back, let me confirm the options. Wait, the options are a bit unclear. The question asks for a) to e), and each option gives numbers for each part. So option I says: 1 for a, 2 for b, 2 for c, 1 for d, 1 for e. Which matches our findings.

Wait, but let me look again at option I.

Option I: 1 for glutamic acid to lysine, 2 for leucine to alanine, 2 for phenylalanine to glycine, 1 for tryptophan to serine, 1 for valine to glutamic acid.

Yes, that matches exactly.

So the correct answer would be option I.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes. Let's double-check each part.

a) Glu (GAA/GAG) to Lys (AAA/AAG). Change first G to A: GAA→AAA (1 substitution). Correct.

b) Leu (various) to Ala (GCT etc.). The minimal is two substitutions. For example, CUG→GCG (change C to G and U to C), which is two changes. Correct.

c) Phe (UUU/UUC) to Gly (GGN). Need two substitutions (UUU→GGU: first two Us to Gs). Correct.

d) Trp (UGG) to Ser (UCG): change second G to C. One substitution. Correct.

e) Val (GUG) to Glu (GAG): change third G to A. One substitution. Correct.

So all parts match option I. So the answer should be I.
