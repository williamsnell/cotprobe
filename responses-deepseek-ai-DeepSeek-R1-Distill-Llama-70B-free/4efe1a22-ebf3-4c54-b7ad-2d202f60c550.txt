Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating horsepower. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these formulas, but I think I can work through it.

The question says that a load requires a torque of 60 lb-ft and needs to be driven at 1750 revolutions per minute (r/min). I need to find out what horsepower is required. The options are A to J, with various horsepower values.

Hmm, I remember that horsepower is a unit of power, and power is related to torque and rotational speed. Oh right, the formula for horsepower when you have torque in lb-ft and speed in r/min is something like horsepower equals torque multiplied by speed, then divided by some constant. But wait, what's the exact formula again?

I think the formula is HP = (Torque × RPM) / 5252. Yeah, that sounds right. So let me write that down:

HP = (Torque × RPM) / 5252

Wait, why 5252? Oh right, that's because 1 horsepower is equal to 33,000 lb-ft per minute. So when you multiply torque (lb-ft) by RPM (per minute), you get lb-ft per minute. Dividing by 33,000 gives you horsepower. Wait, but 33,000 divided by 1000 is 33, so 33,000 is 33 times 1000, and 5252 is close to 5.252 times 1000. Oh wait, 5252 is actually 2π times 33,000 divided by 60, or something? Maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me just stick to the formula I remember: HP = (Torque × RPM) / 5252.

So plugging in the numbers here, torque is 60 lb-ft, and RPM is 1750. Let me calculate that.

First, multiply 60 by 1750. Hmm, 60 times 1000 is 60,000, and 60 times 750 is 45,000. So 60,000 + 45,000 is 105,000. So the numerator is 105,000.

Now, divide that by 5252. Let me see, 5252 times 20 is 105,040. Oh wait, that's just a bit over 105,000. So 5252 × 20 = 105,040. But our numerator is 105,000, which is 40 less than 105,040. So 20 times 5252 is 105,040, so 20 minus (40/5252) would give us approximately 19.99, which is almost 20.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check the calculation again. Maybe I should do it more accurately.

60 lb-ft × 1750 r/min = 60 * 1750 = 105,000 (as before).

Now, 105,000 divided by 5252. Let me compute that.

5252 × 20 = 105,040. So 20 gives us 105,040, which is 40 more than 105,000. So 105,000 is 20 minus (40/5252). 40 divided by 5252 is approximately 0.007623. So 20 - 0.007623 ≈ 19.9924. So about 19.9924 HP.

Looking at the options, B is 20 hp. That's the closest value. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I have the formula right. Another way to think about it is that 1 HP is 33,000 lb-ft per minute. So if I have torque in lb-ft and RPM, then the power is (Torque × RPM) / 33,000. Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, which is correct?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The formula for horsepower when torque is in inch-pounds is HP = (Torque × RPM) / 63,025. But wait, this might be where I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, for torque in lb-ft, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, let me think again. The general formula for power is P = (Torque × Angular Velocity). But when using imperial units, torque is in lb-ft, and angular velocity is in r/min, so you have to convert to consistent units.

Alternatively, the formula I found earlier is HP = (Torque × RPM) / 5252. Because 5252 is approximately 2π × 33,000 / 60. Wait, let me compute 2π × 33,000 / 60. 

Wait, 33,000 ft-lb per minute is 1 HP. So to get HP from torque (lb-ft) and RPM, we have:

HP = (Torque × RPM) / 33,000 × (1 min / 1 min) × (1 HP / 33,000 ft-lb/min)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is HP = (Torque in lb-ft × RPM) / 5252. Because 5252 is 33,000 divided by 6.2832 (which is approximately 2π), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the units. Torque is in lb-ft, RPM is per minute. So Torque × RPM gives lb-ft per minute. And 1 HP is 33,000 lb-ft per minute. So HP = (Torque × RPM) / 33,000.

Wait, that seems correct. Because if you have 33,000 lb-ft per minute, that's 1 HP. So for example, if Torque is 1 lb-ft and RPM is 33,000, then HP would be (1 * 33,000) / 33,000 = 1 HP. That makes sense.

So then why did I think it was 5252 earlier? Oh, maybe that's for when the torque is in inch-pounds. Because 1 lb-ft is 12 inch-pounds. So perhaps the formula using 5252 is when torque is in inch-pounds. Let me check that.

Yes, I think that's the case. If torque is in inch-pounds, then HP = (Torque × RPM) / 63,025 because 63,025 is 12 × 5252 (approximately), but wait, 12 × 5252 is 63,024. So that makes sense.

So in this problem, torque is given in lb-ft, so applying the correct formula, HP = (Torque × RPM) / 33,000.

Wait! So in this case, Torque is 60 lb-ft, RPM is 1750.

So 60 × 1750 = 105,000.

Divide that by 33,000: 105,000 / 33,000 = 105/33 = 3.1818... So about 3.18 HP. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options are 5,10,15,20, etc. So that can't be right.

Wait, this is confusing. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm thinking of is when the torque is in inch-pounds. Because 1 HP is 33,000 lb-ft per minute, but 1 lb-ft is 12 inch-pounds. So for inch-pounds, 1 HP is 33,000 × 12 = 396,000 inch-pounds per minute.

So the formula with inch-pounds would be HP = (Torque × RPM) / 396,000. But wait, 396,000 is 63,025 × 6.2832, no, that's not right. Hmm.

Alternatively, the formula when using inch-pounds is HP = (Torque × RPM) / 63,025. Because 63,025 is roughly 2π × 10,000, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I need to clarify once and for all. Let's look up the correct formula.

[Imagining I'm checking a reference or formula sheet.]

Ah, yes, correct formula when torque is in lb-ft and RPM is in revolutions per minute is:

HP = (Torque × RPM) / 5252

Because 5252 is approximately (2π × 33,000) / 60. Let me compute 2π × 33,000: 2 × 3.1416 × 33,000 ≈ 207,345. Then divide by 60: 207,345 /60 ≈ 3455.75. Wait, that's not 5252.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is HP = (Torque in lb-ft × RPM) / 5252.

Yes, that's what I originally thought. So for this problem, 60 lb-ft × 1750 r/min = 105,000. Then 105,000 / 5252 ≈ 20 HP.

So that aligns with option B:20 hp.

But earlier, when I thought using 33,000, I was getting 3.18 HP, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I was confusing the formula for when torque is in inch-pounds.

So the correct approach here is to use the formula HP = (Torque × RPM) / 5252 when torque is in lb-ft and RPM is in r/min.

So 60*1750=105,000. Divided by 5252 is approximately 20 HP.

Therefore, the correct answer is B:20 hp.
</think>

To determine the horsepower required to drive the load, we use the formula for horsepower when torque is given in lb-ft and rotational speed is in revolutions per minute (r/min):

\[
\text{HP} = \frac{\text{Torque} \times \text{RPM}}{5252}
\]

### Given:
- Torque = 60 lb-ft
- RPM = 1750 r/min

### Calculation:
1. Multiply the torque and RPM:
   \[
   60 \times 1750 = 105,000
   \]

2. Divide the result by 5252:
   \[
   \frac{105,000}{5252} \approx 20
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated horsepower is approximately 20 HP, which matches option **B**.
