Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron's speed and kinetic energy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's see. The question says the electron's kinetic energy is 1% larger than the value calculated without considering relativistic effects. Oh right, so normally, without relativity, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but when speeds get close to the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play, so we have to use the relativistic formulas.

Wait, the problem is giving me two things to find: the speed of the electron and the value of the kinetic energy. But wait, the way the question is phrased might be a bit tricky. It says the kinetic energy is 1% larger than the non-relativistic calculation. So the actual kinetic energy is KE_actual = 1.01 * KE_non-relativistic.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So the non-relativistic KE is (1/2)m v². The actual relativistic KE is (gamma - 1)m c². So the problem states that (gamma -1)m c² = 1.01 * (1/2 m v²).

Wait, so I can set up that equation. Let me write that down.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So the equation becomes:

(gamma - 1) m c² = 1.01 * (1/2 m v²)

I can cancel out the m on both sides, so that simplifies to:

(gamma -1) c² = 1.01 * (1/2) v²

Hmm, let me compute 1.01 * 0.5. 1.01 * 0.5 is 0.505, right? So,

(gamma - 1) c² = 0.505 v²

But wait, gamma is a function of v, so I need to find v such that this equation holds.

Let me rearrange this equation.

gamma = 1 + (0.505 v²) / c²

But gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (0.505 v²)/(c²)

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me let x = v²/c². Then v² = x c², and v = sqrt(x) c.

Then, substituting into the equation,

1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + 0.505 x

So,

1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + 0.505 x

Hmm, I need to solve for x here. Let me write this equation as:

1 = (1 + 0.505 x) * sqrt(1 - x)

Wait, maybe square both sides to eliminate the square roots. Let's try that.

Starting from:

1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + 0.505 x

Square both sides:

1/(1 - x) = (1 + 0.505 x)^2

Expanding the right-hand side:

(1 + 0.505 x)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.505 x) + (0.505 x)^2

Which is 1 + 1.01 x + 0.255025 x²

So now, the equation is:

1/(1 - x) = 1 + 1.01 x + 0.255025 x²

Let me multiply both sides by (1 - x) to eliminate the denominator:

1 = (1 + 1.01 x + 0.255025 x²) (1 - x)

Expanding the right-hand side:

Multiply each term in the first parenthesis by each in the second.

1*(1 - x) = 1 - x

1.01x*(1 -x) = 1.01x - 1.01 x²

0.255025 x² * (1 -x) = 0.255025 x² - 0.255025 x^3

So adding all these terms together:

1 - x + 1.01x -1.01 x² + 0.255025 x² - 0.255025 x^3

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 1

x terms: (-x + 1.01x) = 0.01 x

x² terms: (-1.01 x² + 0.255025 x²) = (-0.755975) x²

x^3 term: (-0.255025 x^3)

So the right-hand side becomes:

1 + 0.01 x - 0.755975 x² - 0.255025 x^3

So now the equation is:

1 = 1 + 0.01 x - 0.755975 x² - 0.255025 x^3

Subtract 1 from both sides:

0 = 0.01 x - 0.755975 x² - 0.255025 x^3

Let me rearrange this:

0.255025 x^3 + 0.755975 x² - 0.01 x = 0

Factor out x:

x (0.255025 x^2 + 0.755975 x - 0.01) = 0

So, solutions are x=0, which would imply v=0 (but that's not possible, since KE wouldn't be 1% higher), and the solutions to the quadratic equation:

0.255025 x^2 + 0.755975 x - 0.01 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Where a = 0.255025, b=0.755975, c=-0.01

Calculate discriminant D = b² -4ac

b^2 = (0.755975)^2 ≈ let's compute that. 0.7^2 is 0.49, 0.75^2 is 0.5625. Let me compute 0.755975^2 more accurately.

Wait, 0.755975 is approximately 0.756.

0.756 * 0.756 = let's compute:

0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49.

0.7 * 0.056 = 0.0392.

0.056 * 0.7 = same as above.

0.056 * 0.056 = approx 0.003136.

Wait, perhaps better to compute (a + b)^2 where a=0.75, b=0.006.

(0.75 + 0.006)^2 = 0.75^2 + 2*0.75*0.006 + 0.006^2

= 0.5625 + 0.009 + 0.000036 = 0.571536.

So D = 0.571536 - 4 * 0.255025 * (-0.01)

Wait, 4ac is 4 * a * c.

a=0.255025, c=-0.01.

4ac = 4 * 0.255025 * (-0.01) = 4 * (-0.00255025) )= -0.01020099.

So D = 0.571536 - (4ac) → since 4ac is negative, it's 0.571536 + 0.01020099 ≈ 0.581737.

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.581737) ≈ 0.7625.

Now, compute x = [ -b ± sqrt(D) ] / (2a )

So, since b is positive (0.755975), -b is negative. So the two roots are:

x1 = [ -0.755975 + 0.7625 ] / (2 * 0.255025 )

x2 = [ -0.755975 - 0.7625 ] / ( same denominator )

Compute x1 numerator: (-0.755975 + 0.7625 ) ≈ 0.006525

Denominator: 2 * 0.255025 ≈ 0.51005

So x1 ≈ 0.006525 / 0.51005 ≈ approx 0.01278.

x2 numerator: (-0.755975 - 0.7625 ) = -1.518475 → x2 ≈ (-1.518475)/0.51005 ≈ -2.976.

But x represents (v^2/c^2), which can't be negative, so x must be positive. So x ≈ 0.01278.

So v^2/c^2 ≈ 0.01278 → v ≈ sqrt(0.01278) * c.

Compute sqrt(0.01278). Let me think: sqrt(0.01) is 0.1, sqrt(0.04)=0.2. 0.01278 is between 0.01 and 0.04. Let's compute:

0.01278 → let me compute square root numerically.

Let me try 0.113 squared: 0.113^2=0.012769 → which is almost 0.012769, very close to 0.01278. So v ≈ 0.113 c.

Wait, that's 11.3% of c. So v is approximately 0.113c.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option G is 0.1155c, which is about 0.1155 → 11.55%.

Option J is 0.125c (12.5%).

Option E is 0.1c (10%).

Hmm, but our calculation gives approximately 0.113c. So perhaps the closest option is G: 0.1155c. Or maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes when approximating, small errors can creep in.

Wait, when I set up the equation, I had:

(gamma -1) m c² = 1.01 ( (1/2) m v² )

Which simplifies to (gamma -1) c² = 0.505 v².

Wait, 1.01 times (1/2 mv²) is 0.505 mv². Correct.

But when I rearranged, I wrote:

gamma = 1 + (0.505 v²)/(c² )

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, (gamma -1) c² = 0.505 v² → gamma = 1 + (0.505 v²)/(c² )

Yes, that's correct.

Then, substituting gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), yes.

Then, the substitution x = v²/c².

So the equation becomes 1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + 0.505 x.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the substitution. Because earlier, when I set x = v^2/c^2, then v^2 = x c^2. So in 0.505 v^2, that becomes 0.505 x c^2. So (gamma -1) c^2 = 0.505 x c^2 → (gamma -1) = 0.505 x → gamma = 1 + 0.505 x.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - x) → So equation: 1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + 0.505 x.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier because the equation should be 1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + 0.505 x × (c^2 / c^2)? No, I think I did it right. Because 0.505 v² / c² is 0.505 x. So the substitution is correct.

So the equation is 1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + 0.505 x.

Then, when I squared both sides, I had 1/(1 - x) = (1 + 0.505 x)^2.

Which expands to 1/(1 -x) = 1 + 1.01 x + 0.255025 x².

Wait, (0.505 x)^2 is 0.255025 x², correct.

Multiplying both sides by (1 -x):

1 = (1 + 1.01x + 0.255025 x²) (1 -x )

Which expanded gives 1 = 1 +0.01x -0.755975 x² -0.255025 x³.

Then, subtract 1, getting 0.01 x - 0.755975 x² -0.255025 x³ =0.

Factor out x → x (0.01 - 0.755975 x - 0.255025 x² )=0.

Wait, earlier I wrote it as 0.255025 x^3 + 0.755975 x^2 -0.01 x =0, which may have the coefficients in the wrong order. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I subtracted 1 from both sides and set the equation to zero, it was:

0 = 0.01 x - 0.755975 x² -0.255025 x³.

Which can be written as:

-0.255025 x³ -0.755975 x² + 0.01 x =0.

Alternatively, x ( -0.255025 x² -0.755975 x + 0.01 ) = 0.

But I think I might have made a mistake in the sign when I factored. Because when I multiplied out (1 + a x + b x²)(1 -x), perhaps I messed up the signs.

Let me recompute the expansion.

Wait, (1 + 1.01x + 0.255025 x²) multiplied by (1 -x) equals:

1*(1 -x) = 1 -x.

1.01x * (1 -x) = 1.01x - 1.01 x².

0.255025 x² * (1 -x )= 0.255025 x² - 0.255025 x^3.

Now, adding all together:

1 -x + 1.01x - 1.01 x² + 0.255025 x² -0.255025 x^3.

Combine like terms:

1 (constant term)

x terms: (-x + 1.01x )= 0.01x.

x² terms: (-1.01 x² + 0.255025 x² )= (-0.755975) x².

x³ term: (-0.255025 x^3 )

So the equation becomes 1 + 0.01 x -0.755975 x² -0.255025 x^3 = 1.

Subtracting 1 from both sides: 0.01x -0.755975 x² -0.255025 x^3 =0.

So the equation is correct. So when I factored, it's x (0.01 -0.755975 x -0.255025 x² ) =0.

Wait, no. Because when I factor x, the equation is x (0.01 -0.755975 x -0.255025 x² ) = 0.

But the quadratic equation inside the parentheses would be: 0.01 -0.755975 x -0.255025 x² =0.

So to write it in standard form: -0.255025 x² -0.755975 x + 0.01 =0.

Multiplying both sides by -1: 0.255025 x² + 0.755975 x -0.01 =0.

Which is what I had earlier. So the quadratic equation is correct.

So the solution using quadratic formula gives x ≈0.01278, leading to v≈0.113c.

Looking at the options, the closest speed is option G: 0.1155c, which is 11.55% of c. But let me check if 0.1155c gives a KE that's 1% higher than non-relativistic.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact v and see whether any of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use approximation formulas when v is much smaller than c, but given that v is about 0.1c, this might not be a very small speed, so relativistic effects are not negligible, but perhaps a first-order approximation could be used.

Wait, another approach: the non-relativistic KE is K_nr = (1/2) m v^2.

The relativistic KE is K_rel = (gamma -1) m c^2.

The problem states K_rel = 1.01 * K_nr.

So,

(gamma -1) m c^2 = 1.01 * (1/2 m v^2 )

Divide both sides by m:

(gamma -1) c^2 = 1.01 * (1/2 v^2 )

So,

gamma -1 = (1.01 * v^2 )/( 2 c^2 )

gamma = 1 + (1.01 v^2 )/( 2 c^2 )

But gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (1.01 v² )/( 2 c² )

Let me let x = v²/c², so v^2 = x c^2.

Substituting into the equation:

1/sqrt(1 -x ) = 1 + (1.01 x c^2 )/( 2 c^2 )

Simplifies to:

1/sqrt(1 -x ) = 1 + (1.01 x )/( 2 )

Which is:

1/sqrt(1 -x ) = 1 + 0.505 x

Which is exactly what I had before.

So proceeding as before, solving for x gives x≈0.01278, so v≈sqrt(0.01278) c ≈ 0.113c.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option E: 0.1c (which is 0.1c, 3000 eV)

Option G: 0.1155c, 3442 eV.

Wait, but how do I compute the kinetic energy? Because the non-relativistic KE is (1/2)mv², but the actual KE is (gamma -1)mc². Since the problem says the actual KE is 1% higher than the non-relativistic value, I need to compute both KE_nr and KE_rel.

Wait, let's compute the non-relativistic KE first.

The rest mass of an electron is m = 9.10938356e-31 kg.

The speed v is approximately 0.113c, where c is
