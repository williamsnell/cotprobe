Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking me to translate the English sentence "Some students work hard" into predicate logic, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. "Some students work hard" means that there exists at least one student who works hard. So it's talking about existence, not about all students. That makes me think that the correct translation will use an existential quantifier, which is the exists symbol, usually written as ∃.

Now, I should break down the sentence into its components. "Students" can be represented by a predicate, let's say S(x), where S(x) means "x is a student." "Work hard" would be another predicate, maybe W(x), meaning "x works hard." So the sentence is saying that there's some x that is both a student and works hard.

In predicate logic, "some" translates to ∃, and when we're saying that some x has both properties, we use a conjunction. So the structure would be ∃x (S(x) ∧ W(x)). Wait, but looking at the options, I see some use a dot (·) which I think is also a symbol for conjunction, same as ∧. So the formula would be something like ∃x (Sx · Wx).

Now, looking at the options provided:

Option A: (∃x)(Sx ⊃ Wx) – This reads as "There exists an x such that if x is a student, then x works hard." That's a conditional statement, not a conjunction. So this would mean all students work hard if they exist, which isn't what the original sentence says. So A is not correct.

Option B: (∃x)(Wx ⊃ Sx) – Similar issue as A, but the conditional is reversed. It would mean if x works hard, then x is a student. Not what we need.

Option C: (∀x)(Sx · Wx) – This uses a universal quantifier, which would mean all students work hard. But the original sentence says some, so this is incorrect.

Option D: (∃x)(Sx · Wx) – This matches what I was thinking. There exists an x such that x is a student and x works hard. So D looks correct.

Option E: (∀x)(Sx ∨ Wx) – Universal again, and it's saying for all x, x is a student or x works hard. That doesn't make sense because it's not about all things, just some students.

Option F: (∀x)(Wx · Sx) – Same as C but swapped; again, it's a universal statement about all students working hard, which is too strong.

Option G: (∃x)(Sx ∨ Wx) – Existential, but with a disjunction. So it would mean there exists an x that is either a student or works hard. But the original sentence is about students who work hard, so this isn't capturing the conjunction of both properties in the same x.

Option H: (∃x)(Wx · Sx) – Wait, this looks the same as D, just the order swapped. Conjunction is commutative, so Wx · Sx is the same as Sx · Wx. So H would also be correct, right? Hmm, but I need to check the options again.

Wait, let me look back. Option D is (∃x)(Sx · Wx), and H is (∃x)(Wx · Sx). They are logically equivalent because ∧ is commutative. So both D and H would express the same thing. But looking at the options, I need to see which one is present.

Wait, the options are from A to J, so let me check again. Oh, I see, D and H are both similar. But wait, looking at the options, I think I may have misread them. Let me check each option carefully.

Wait, looking back, option H is written as (∃x)(Wx • Sx). So same as D, but the order is different. Since conjunction doesn't care about order, both D and H would be correct, but perhaps only one is in the options. Wait no, looking at the options again:

Wait, the options are:

A: (∃x)(Sx ⊃ Wx)

B: (∃x)(Wx ⊃ Sx)

C: (∀x)(Sx • Wx)

D: (∃x)(Sx • Wx)

E: (∀x)(Sx ∨ Wx)

F: (∀x)(Wx • Sx)

G: (∃x)(Sx ∨ Wx)

H: (∃x)(Wx • Sx)

I: (∀x)(Sx ⊃ Wx)

J: (∃x)(Wx ∨ Sx)

So D is (∃x)(Sx • Wx) and H is (∃x)(Wx • Sx). Since ∧ is commutative, both D and H are equivalent. But the question is to select the best translation. So perhaps both D and H are correct, but maybe only one is among the choices.

Wait, but the answer options are A to J, and each is unique. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, no, the original sentence is "Some students work hard." So the correct way is to say there exists an x that is a student and works hard. So both D and H would express that. But looking at the options, both D and H are present. So why would two options be correct? That can't be right; the answer must be unique.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-express the sentence.

"Some students work hard" can be represented as ∃x (S(x) ∧ W(x)). So in the options, that's either D or H.

Wait, but in the options provided, both D and H are similar. So perhaps I should look again at the options provided.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the letters. Let me check again the options:

Option D: (∃x)(Sx • Wx)

Option H: (∃x)(Wx • Sx)

Since • is the same as ∧, both are equivalent. So perhaps the answer is both D and H, but that's impossible because the options are single letters.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the letters. Let me make sure.

The options are:

A: (∃x)(Sx → Wx)

B: (∃x)(Wx → Sx)

C: (∀x)(Sx ∧ Wx)

D: (∃x)(Sx ∧ Wx)

E: (∀x)(Sx ∨ Wx)

F: (∀x)(Wx ∧ Sx)

G: (∃x)(Sx ∨ Wx)

H: (∃x)(Wx ∧ Sx)

I: (∀x)(Sx → Wx)

J: (∃x)(Wx ∨ Sx)

So D and H are both ∃x with a conjunction of Sx and Wx, just swapped. So they are equivalent. But in the options, both D and H are present, so the question must have intended that only one is correct, perhaps due to the order. But logically, they are the same.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer should be either D or H. But looking at the options provided, perhaps the intended answer is D. Because "Some students work hard" is ∃x (Sx ∧ Wx), which is D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because H is also the same. But perhaps the answer options have the same meaning, but the intended correct option is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment. Maybe the correct answer is D, and H is a trick option, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the intended answer is D, as it directly follows the structure of the sentence: Some students (Sx) work hard (Wx), so ∃x (Sx ∧ Wx).

So the correct answer should be D.

The sentence "Some students work hard" can be translated into predicate logic as "There exists an x such that x is a student and x works hard." This requires an existential quantifier (∃) and a conjunction (∧) to combine the two predicates S(x) (x is a student) and W(x) (x works hard). The correct logical structure is therefore ∃x (Sx ∧ Wx).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: (∃x)(Sx ⊃ Wx) – This is a conditional statement, not a conjunction, and does not capture the meaning of the sentence.
- **Option B**: (∃x)(Wx ⊃ Sx) – Similar to A, this is a conditional statement in the reverse direction, which is also incorrect.
- **Option C**: (∀x)(Sx • Wx) – This uses a universal quantifier, which would mean "All students work hard," not "Some students work hard."
- **Option D**: (∃x)(Sx • Wx) – This matches the required structure: "There exists an x such that x is a student and x works hard."
- **Option E**: (∀x)(Sx ∨ Wx) – This uses a universal quantifier with a disjunction, which is incorrect.
- **Option F**: (∀x)(Wx • Sx) – Similar to C, this uses a universal quantifier and is incorrect.
- **Option G**: (∃x)(Sx ∨ Wx) – This uses an existential quantifier with a disjunction, which means "There exists an x that is either a student or works hard," not "There exists an x that is both a student and works hard."
- **Option H**: (∃x)(Wx • Sx) – This is logically equivalent to D because conjunction (∧) is commutative. However, only one answer can be correct, and D directly follows the structure of the sentence.
- **Option I**: (∀x)(Sx ⊃ Wx) – This is a universal conditional statement, which is incorrect.
- **Option J**: (∃x)(Wx ∨ Sx) – Similar to G, this uses a disjunction and is incorrect.

The best translation is **Option D**: (∃x)(Sx • Wx).
