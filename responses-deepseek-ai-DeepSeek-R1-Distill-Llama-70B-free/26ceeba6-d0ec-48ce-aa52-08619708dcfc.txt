Okay, so I've got this problem here about bonds and a sinking fund. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the ABC Corporation has issued 200 bonds, each with a $1,000 face value. So that's 200 times 1,000, which equals $200,000 total. These bonds are redeemable at par after 15 years. So, the company has to pay back $200,000 in 15 years.

But wait, they're setting up a fund to accumulate the money needed for redemption. They make annual deposits into this fund, which earns 4% interest each year. The question is asking for the principal in the fund at the end of 12 years. Oh, wait, so they started the fund 3 years before the redemption time? Because 15 years total, and we're looking at the end of 12 years. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The bonds are 15 years, so the company has 15 years to accumulate the funds. But the question is about what's in the fund after 12 years. So they've been depositing for 12 years, and have 3 years left until redemption. But actually, the problem says the fund is established to accumulate the funds, so probably they make annual deposits each year until year 15. But the question only asks up to year 12.

So the problem is about a sinking fund where the company sets aside money each year for 15 years, earning 4% interest. But we're only looking at the first 12 years of contributions and interest. Or wait, maybe the deposits are made annually for 15 years, but we're looking at the balance after 12 years.

Wait, actually, the way the question is phrased: "the principal in the fund at the end of 12 years." So that would mean they've been making annual deposits for 12 years, and the fund has grown with interest for those 12 years. So the future value after 12 years is needed.

So what's the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity? Because each deposit is made at the end of each year, right? So the formula is:

FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r

Where PMT is the annual deposit, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of years.

But wait, do we know the PMT? The problem doesn't directly give it. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, the total amount needed at the end of 15 years is $200,000. So perhaps the annual payments are determined such that the future value at 15 years is $200,000.

So first, we need to find the annual deposit (PMT) that will accumulate to $200,000 in 15 years at 4% interest. Then, once we have PMT, we can find the future value after 12 years.

So first step: calculate PMT.

The future value of the annuity at 15 years is $200,000. The formula for that is:

200,000 = PMT * [(1 + 0.04)^15 - 1]/0.04

I can solve for PMT here.

Let me compute the denominator first. 0.04 is the rate. So 1.04^15 is the factor. Let me compute that.

Wait, I can approximate 1.04^15. Alternatively, I can remember the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it step by step.

1.04^1 = 1.04

1.04^2 = 1.0816

1.04^3 ≈ 1.124864

1.04^4 ≈ 1.16985856

Hmm, this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or a calculator approach. Wait, I think for 15 years at 4%, the factor (1.04)^15 is approximately 1.04^15. Let me compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the present value factor. Wait, no, because it's a future value calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula and plug in the numbers.

FV = PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n -1 ) / r ]

We have FV = 200,000 at n=15, r=0.04. So:

200,000 = PMT * [ (1.04^15 - 1 ) / 0.04 ]

I need to compute 1.04^15.

Let me calculate it step by step:

Year 1: 1.04

Year 2: 1.0816

Year 3: 1.124864

Year 4: approx 1.16985856

Year 5: approx 1.2166529024

Year 6: 1.2166529 *1.04 ≈ 1.265319

Year7: ~1.2653 *1.04≈1.3159317

Year8: ~1.31593 *1.04≈1.369724

Year9: ~1.3697 *1.04≈1.425764

Year10: ~1.425764 *1.04≈1.48450562

Year11: ~1.4845 *1.04≈1.545947

Year12: ~1.545947 *1.04≈1.609757

Year13: ~1.609757 *1.04≈1.676219

Year14: ~1.676219 *1.04≈1.745847

Year15: ~1.745847 *1.04≈1.8166967

So after 15 years, 1.04^15 ≈ 1.8166967.

So the term [ (1.04^15 -1 ) / 0.04 ] is (1.8166967 - 1)/0.04 = 0.8166967 / 0.04 ≈ 20.424242.

So, 200,000 = PMT * 20.424242

So PMT = 200,000 / 20.424242 ≈ approximately 200,000 / 20.424242.

Let me compute that:

20.424242 × 9,788. ≈ 200,000, because 20 × 10,000 is 200,000, so 9,788 is approximate.

Wait, 20.424242 * 9,788 = ?

Wait, 20.424242 * 9,788: Let me compute 20 * 9,788 = 195,760. Then 0.424242 * 9,788 ≈ approx 4,153. So total ≈ 195,760 + 4,153 ≈ 199,913. Close to 200,000. So PMT is approximately 9,788.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately:

PMT = 200,000 / 20.424242 ≈ let's compute 200,000 ÷ 20.424242.

Calculate 200,000 ÷ 20.424242:

20.424242 × 9,788 = ?

Wait, 20.424242 * 9,788.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 200,000 ÷ 20.424242.

Compute 200,000 ÷20.424242.

Let me compute 20.424242 × 9,788. So 9,788 ×20 is 195,760. 9,788 × 0.424242 ≈ 9,788 * 0.4 is 3,915.2; 9,788 *0.024242≈ approx 237. So total approx 3,915.2 +237=4,152.2. So total 195,760 +4,152.2=199,912.2. So PMT is about 9,788 per year.

But perhaps a more precise calculation is better. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps 20.424242 × 9,788. So 9,788 ×20.424242.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 200,000 /20.424242.

So 20.424242 ×9,788= 200,000 approx. So PMT is approximately 9,788 per annum.

But perhaps we can compute it more accurately. Let's see: 20.424242 * x =200,000. So x=200,000/20.424242.

Using a calculator approach:

200,000 ÷20.424242 = ?

Well, 20.424242 × 9,788 = 200,000 approximately.

So PMT≈9,788.

But perhaps I should use a more accurate method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that PMT is about $9,788 per year.

But wait, the options given don't include a PMT value. The question is about the principal after 12 years, which is the future value of 12 annual payments, each of PMT, at 4% interest.

So once we have PMT, we can compute the future value after 12 years.

So, FV_12 = PMT × [ (1.04^12 -1 ) / 0.04 ]

We can compute 1.04^12.

Again, computing 1.04^12:

We can use the same method as before.

Alternatively, knowing that 1.04^12 is approximately 1.04^10 *1.04^2.

Wait, 1.04^10 is known to be approximately 1.480244. Then 1.04^2 is 1.0816. So 1.480244 *1.0816 ≈ 1.480244 * 1.08 = 1.5987, and 1.480244 *0.0016= approx 0.00237, so total approx 1.60106.

Alternatively, perhaps more accurately:

1.04^12:

Let me compute step by step.

1.04^1 =1.04

2: 1.0816

3: 1.124864

4: 1.16985856

5: 1.2166529024

6: 1.265319019 (approx)

7: 1.31593177

8: 1.36972418

9: 1.42576345

10: 1.48450562

11: 1.48450562 *1.04= 1.54594749

12: 1.54594749 *1.04= approx 1.60975743

So 1.04^12 ≈1.609757.

So [ (1.04^12 -1 ) /0.04 ] = (1.609757 -1 ) /0.04 = 0.609757 /0.04 ≈15.243925.

So FV_12 = PMT ×15.243925.

But PMT≈9,788.

So FV_12≈9,788 ×15.243925.

Wait, 9,788 ×15 is 146,820.

9,788 ×0.243925: Let's compute that.

0.243925 is approximately 0.24 +0.003925.

So 9,788 ×0.24= 2,349.12.

9,788 ×0.003925=approx 9,788 *0.004=39.152, but since it's 0.003925, subtract 5% of that: 39.152 *0.05=1.9576. So 39.152-1.9576≈37.1944.

So total 2,349.12 +37.1944≈2,386.3144.

So FV_12≈146,820 +2,386.3144≈149,206.31.

Wait, but wait, that's approximate. Let me try another approach. 9,788 ×15.243925.

Alternatively, 9,788 ×15=146,820.

9,788 ×0.243925= ?

Compute 9,788 ×0.2=1,957.6.

9,788 ×0.04=391.52.

9,788 ×0.003925=approx 38.43.

Wait, 9,788 ×0.003=29.364.

9,788 ×0.000925= approx 9,788 ×0.001=9.788, but 0.000925 is 925e-6. So 9.788 *0.925≈9.06.

So 29.364 +9.06≈38.424.

So adding all: 1,957.6 (0.2) +391.52 (0.04) +38.424 (0.003925) = 1,957.6 +391.52=2,349.12 +38.424=2,387.544.

So 146,820 +2,387.544=149,207.544.

So approx $149,207.54.

But wait, looking at the options, the closest is option J: $150,080.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating PMT. Because maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to directly compute the future value of 12 years of payments, where each payment is the annual deposit needed to reach 200,000 in 15 years.

Wait, perhaps another approach is, instead of finding PMT first, to realize that the fund's value after 12 years is the present value of the remaining 3 years' deposits, which would accumulate to 200,000 at year 15.

Wait, no, that's perhaps more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as the future value of the first 12 deposits.

Wait, but another way: The total needed at year 15 is 200,000. The fund is accumulating with 4% interest. So, at year 12, the fund has some amount, and then in the next 3 years, it will earn interest and have 3 more deposits added.

But the question is only about the principal at the end of 12 years, before the next 3 deposits. Or wait, no, the problem says the corporation makes annual deposits; so after 12 years, they've made 12 deposits, each at the end of year 1 to 12. The next 3 years (years 13-15) they will make 3 more deposits, but those aren't part of the 12-year fund. So the fund at year 12 is the future value of 12 annual deposits, which is what we're calculating.

So in any case, the earlier calculation of around $149,207 would be the fund's value at year 12.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: $150,080.

Wait, but let me check my earlier PMT calculation again. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

So the equation is 200,000 = PMT × [ (1.04^15 -1 ) / 0.04 ]

We calculated 1.04^15 as approximately 1.8166967, so (1.8166967-1)/0.04=0.8166967/0.04=20.424242.

So, PMT=200,000 /20.424242= approximately 9,788.71.

Wait, I think I can calculate this division more accurately.

200,000 ÷20.424242 = ?

Let me do this division:

20.424242 × 9,788= 200,000 approx, but perhaps the exact value is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps 20.424242 ×9,788. Let me compute 20.424242 ×9,788.

But maybe a better approach is to compute 200,000 ÷20.424242.

Let me try:

20.424242 ×9,788= ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 200,000 ÷20.424242.

20.424242 ×9,788= 200,000.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 200,000 ÷20.424242 = x.

Let me do the division:

20.424242 ) 200,000.000000

We can compute how many times 20.424242 fits into 200,000.

200,000 ÷20.424242 ≈9,788. So PMT is approximately 9,788.71.

So, with PMT≈9,788.71.

Then, the FV after 12 years is:

FV = 9,788.71 × [ (1.04^12 -1 ) /0.04 ]

We found that 1.04^12≈1.609757, so (1.609757-1 )/0.04 =0.609757/0.04≈15.243925.

So FV ≈9,788.71 ×15.243925.

Let me compute this:

9,788.71 ×15 = 146,830.65.

9,788.71 ×0.243925≈ ?

Compute 9,788.71 ×0.2 =1,957.74.

9,788.71 ×0.04=391.5484.

9,788.71 ×0.003925= approx 38.44.

So 1,957.74 + 391.55=2,349.29 +38.44≈2,387.73.

So total FV≈146,830.65 +2,387.73≈149,218.38.

So approximately $149,218.38.

Looking at the options, the closest is J: $150,080. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the PMT calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.04^15 more accurately.

Let me use a calculator approach for 1.04^15.

Calculating 1.04^15 precisely:

Year 1: 1.04

Year 2: 1.0816

Year 3: 1.124864

Year 4: 1.124864 *1.04=1.16985856

Year 5: 1.16985856 *1.04=1.2166529024

Year 6: 1.2166529024 *1.04=1.265319019 (approx)

Year 7: 1.265319019 *1.04=1.315931772

Year 8: 1.315931772 *1.04≈1.36972418

Year 9: 1.36972418 *1.04≈1.42576345

Year 10: 1.42576345 *1.04≈1.48450562

Year 11: 1.48450562 *1.04≈1.54594749

Year 12: 1.54594749 *1
