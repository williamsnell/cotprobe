Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with what's admissible in court. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a wrongful death case where the husband and his passenger were killed in a car accident. The wife is suing to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. On direct examination, she testified about their close and happy marriage of over 15 years. Then, on cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asks if she knew about her husband's affair with the passenger. Her attorney objects, and the question is whether the judge should sustain or overrule the objection.

The options are A through G, each giving a different reason why the question is or isn't objectionable. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I remember that in a wrongful death case, the plaintiff can recover for things like loss of companionship, emotional distress, and the value of the relationship. The wife's testimony about their close relationship is relevant to establish the extent of her loss.

Now, the defendant's question on cross-examination is about whether the wife knew about an affair her husband was having with the passenger. My initial thought is about relevance and potential prejudice. If the question is about the affair, it might be trying to suggest that the relationship wasn't as strong as she claimed, which could reduce the damages she's claiming.

So, is evidence of the husband's affair admissible here? I think about the rules of evidence. Generally, evidence must be relevant to a matter at issue. If the plaintiff's loss is based on the strength of the marital relationship, then any evidence that contradicts that could be relevant. So, if the husband was having an affair, that might indicate problems in the marriage, which could affect the damages.

But wait, is the affair's existence or the wife's knowledge of it relevant? The affair itself might be relevant if it shows the relationship was troubled, but does the wife's knowledge matter? If she didn't know, maybe it didn't affect their relationship. But if she did know, perhaps it shows the marriage was strained, impacting her loss.

Another angle: the question is about her awareness. If she knew, maybe it suggests she's not as distraught as she claims, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, it could be an attempt to impeach her credibility by showing she's lying about their happy marriage.

However, I also recall that in some cases, evidence of a spouse's infidelity is inadmissible because it's considered too prejudicial and not necessarily probative. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's objectionable because irrelevant. I'm not sure if it's irrelevant because it goes to the nature of their relationship, which is a key part of her damages claim.

Option B says it's objectionable because it tarnishes the deceased's reputation. While that might be a concern, I think the bigger issue is relevance and possible prejudice rather than just reputation.

Option C says it's objectionable because it's highly prejudicial. Prejudice is a factor, but if the evidence is relevant, the judge might allow it despite some prejudice. So maybe not.

Option D says it's unobjectionable because her knowledge is probative of the loss's value. That makes sense because if she knew about the affair, it might mean their relationship wasn't as strong. But wait, if the affair was happening without her knowledge, maybe it doesn't affect her loss. Hmm, but the affair's existence, whether she knew or not, could still be relevant.

Wait, but the question is whether she knew. Her knowledge might not directly affect the value of her loss, because even if she didn't know, the affair could still have affected the marriage. Alternatively, her knowledge could lead to her being less affected by his death, but that seems speculative.

Option E says it's beyond the scope of direct. On cross, the scope is limited to the topics covered on direct. She testified about their close relationship, so the cross could delve into that. So E doesn't seem correct.

Option F says it's objectionable because it invades the deceased's privacy. Privacy rights of the deceased are limited, especially in cases where the personal behavior is relevant. So F might not be the strongest reason.

Option G suggests the question is unobjectionable because it provides a motive. I'm not sure how the affair gives a motive for the accident. Unless the defendant is suggesting the husband was distracted because of the affair, but that seems a stretch.

Wait, going back. The primary issue is whether the question is relevant. The wife is claiming loss of companionship, so the strength and nature of the marriage are relevant. If the husband was having an affair, that could indicate that the marriage wasn't as happy as she claims, thus potentially reducing damages. But does the wife's knowledge of the affair matter? If she didn't know, maybe the affair didn't affect their relationship. If she did know, perhaps it did. So her knowledge could be probative.

So the defendant's attorney might argue that the wife's knowledge is relevant because it speaks to the actual state of their relationship. If she knew about the affair but still claims a close relationship, maybe she's not credible.

Alternatively, the question might be trying to introduce evidence that's more prejudicial than probative. Affairs can be highly prejudicial to the jury, making them sympathetic to the defendant or less so to the plaintiff.

So, is the question about her knowledge of the affair relevant enough to allow, or is it too prejudicial?

I think the key here is whether the affair is relevant to the damages she's claiming. If the affair goes to the heart of the relationship's quality, then it's relevant. But if the question is just about embarrassing her or the deceased, it's not.

The question is about her knowledge, which might be a way to get at whether she's being truthful about their relationship. So, the defendant's attorney might be trying to suggest that she's lying about their happy marriage if she knew about the affair.

But wait, the affair's existence, whether she knew or not, might still be relevant. The fact that she didn't know could actually support her claim, as it shows the affair didn't affect their relationship. But the question is phrased as whether she was aware, so it's about her knowledge.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the question is objectionable because it's irrelevant or more prejudicial than probative. Or maybe it's relevant because it goes to the value of the loss.

Wait, another thought: under the rules of evidence, specific instances of conduct can be used to attack the character of a witness if they're relevant. But here, the husband isn't a witness, so maybe that's not the point.

Alternatively, it's about the wife's credibility. If she claims a close relationship, but she knew about the affair, maybe she's not credible. But I'm not sure if that's a strong enough reason to allow the question.

I think the correct answer is D: unobjectionable because plaintiff's knowledge is probative of the value of her loss. Because if she knew, perhaps their relationship was strained, reducing the loss. But wait, if she didn't know, then the affair didn't affect their relationship. So her knowledge is probative of whether the affair impacted their relationship, which in turn affects her loss.

Alternatively, the question might be trying to get at whether she's lying about their relationship, so it's relevant to her credibility as a witness.

But another angle: in some jurisdictions, the "eggshell plaintiff" concept doesn't apply here. Wait, no, that's about the plaintiff's pre-existing conditions affecting damages. Not applicable here.

So, perhaps the correct ruling is that the question is unobjectionable because it's relevant to the value of the loss. So D would be correct.

But wait, I'm a bit torn because the question seems like it's trying to smear the husband's reputation. But the husband's character isn't at issue here; the wife's loss is. So maybe the affair is relevant to the quality of the marriage, which is directly tied to her damages.

Yes, I think D is the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the defendant's counsel can ask the wife if she knew about her husband's alleged affair with the passenger, given that she is suing for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified about their close and happy marriage, and the defendant's question seeks to challenge the strength of the marital relationship, which is directly relevant to the damages she is claiming.

The key issue is whether the question is admissible under the rules of evidence. Evidence must be relevant to a matter at issue, and in this case, the quality of the marital relationship is central to the wife's claim. If the husband was having an affair, it could indicate that the marriage was not as strong as the wife claims, potentially reducing the damages. The wife's knowledge of the affair is probative because it speaks to whether the affair affected their relationship. If she knew about it, it could suggest the marriage was strained, impacting her loss. Conversely, if she did not know, it might support her claim that the affair did not affect their relationship.

While the question could be seen as prejudicial or an attempt to tarnish the deceased's reputation, the primary focus is on its relevance to the value of the loss. The wife's knowledge of the affair is directly tied to the quality of the relationship, which is a critical factor in determining damages. Therefore, the question is unobjectionable because it is relevant to the value of the loss she is claiming.
