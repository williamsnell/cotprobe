This question refers to the following information.
"MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:â€”
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal."
Mohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921

Okay, so I've got this question about Mahatma Gandhi and the boycott he mentioned. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The question is asking which historical development most helped the success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph of Gandhi's message. The fifth paragraph talks about boycotting foreign cloth and taking up spinning or weaving, which I remember is part of the Swadeshi movement. Swadeshi was all about self-reliance and using Indian-made goods instead of foreign ones, especially British goods.

So, I need to think about what events or developments would have supported this boycott. The options are from A to J, each representing different historical events. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: The Indian National Congress gaining political influence. That makes sense because if the Congress was stronger, more people might support the boycott. But I'm not sure if that's the main factor here.

Option B: Spread of industrialization in India. Wait, if India was industrializing, wouldn't that mean more factories producing goods, possibly competing with foreign ones? But the Swadeshi movement was more about encouraging home industries, like spinning khadi. Industrialization might have helped, but I'm not certain it's the best fit.

Option C: Spread of communism in Asia. I don't see a direct link here. Communism was more about class struggle, and while it influenced some movements, I don't think it directly impacted the success of the Swadeshi boycott.

Option D: World War II. Hmm, WWII happened much later, in the 1940s. The message is from 1921, so the effects of WWII wouldn't have been felt yet. Plus, I'm not sure how WWII directly ties into the success of the boycott in the 1920s.

Option E: Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. That's even later than WWII. The boycott was happening in 1921, so this is way after. Probably not relevant here.

Option F: Aftermath of World War I. Oh, right! After WWI, there were economic hardships in Britain. The British economy was struggling, which might have weakened their colonial grip. Also, the war had exposed the vulnerabilities of colonial powers, leading to increased nationalism in colonies. Plus, the British might have been less able to enforce their policies as strictly, giving more room for movements like the boycott to gain traction.

Option G: Rise of the civil rights movement in the US. That was more in the 1950s-60s, so it's too late to affect the 1921 boycott. Also, it's a different region, so maybe not directly connected.

Option H: Decolonization in Africa. I think African decolonization happened after WWII, so again, later than our period. Not relevant for 1921.

Option I: The Great Depression starting in 1929. That's after 1921, so it's too late. The Depression did affect economies globally, but for the boycott in 1921, it wouldn't have been a factor yet.

Option J: Pressure from the Soviet Union on colonial powers. The Soviet Union was new after WWI, but I'm not sure how much they pressured Britain regarding India specifically. It might have had some indirect effects, but I don't think it's the main reason the boycott succeeded.

So, thinking through, the most relevant event is F: The aftermath of World War I. Because after WWI, Britain was economically weak and perhaps less able to suppress the Indian independence movements effectively. Also, the war had led to a rise in nationalist sentiments globally, and people were more aware of self-determination. This would have made the boycott more effective as part of the non-cooperation movement.

Additionally, the economic factors after WWI might have made British goods more expensive or less available, making the boycott easier to sustain. People might have been more inclined to support Swadeshi as imported goods became scarce or more costly.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is F.

The question asks which historical development most assisted the success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph of Mahatma Gandhi's 1921 message. The boycott, part of the Swadeshi movement, aimed to promote self-reliance by rejecting foreign goods, particularly British textiles, in favor of Indian-made products. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed:

- **A**: The Indian National Congress gaining political influence could have helped, but it is not the primary factor.
- **B**: The spread of industrialization in India might have competed with foreign goods but does not directly align with the Swadeshi movement's focus on home industries.
- **C**: The spread of communism in Asia is unrelated to the Swadeshi movement.
- **D**: World War II occurred much later (1940s) and is irrelevant to the 1921 boycott.
- **E**: The partition of India and Pakistan (1947) is also too late to impact the 1921 boycott.
- **F**: The aftermath of World War I is highly relevant. Post-WWI economic hardships weakened Britain's colonial grip, and the war's exposure of colonial vulnerabilities fueled nationalist sentiments, aiding the boycott's success.
- **G**: The civil rights movement in the U.S. occurred later (1950s-60s) and is unrelated.
- **H**: Decolonization in Africa happened post-WWII and is too late.
- **I**: The Great Depression (1929) is also too late to affect the 1921 boycott.
- **J**: Soviet pressure on colonial powers is not a significant factor in this context.

The most relevant development is **F: The aftermath of World War I**, as it created economic and political conditions that strengthened the boycott's effectiveness. 

Answer: F
