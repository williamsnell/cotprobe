Okay, so I've got this problem about figuring out the monthly payment for a car. Hmm, seems a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Alright, the goal is to find the monthly payment needed to pay off the car in two years. The car has several costs associated with it, and I need to calculate the total amount first before determining the monthly payments with financing.

Let me list out all the given costs:

- Price of the car: $5,779.00
- Transportation charge: $73.00
- Factory-installed equipment:
  - Radio: $95.50
  - Metallic paint: $59.90
  - Racing stripes: $39.50
  - Power steering: $98.00
  - Wide radial tires: $198.10
  - Air conditioning: $429.00
- Dealer-installed equipment:
  - Mirror: $8.50
  - Mats: $10.75
  - Undercoat: $35.00
- Insurance for two years:
  - Collision ($100 deductible): $505.75
  - Comprehensive: $231.50
- Sales tax: 5%
- Cash deposit: $500.00
- Financing cost: 9.5% per year for two years
- Used car allowance: $370.00

Wait, I think I need to calculate the total cost of the car including all these items, then subtract the deposit and used car allowance, then apply the sales tax, then add the financing cost, and then figure out the monthly payments over two years.

Wait, no, perhaps the order is different. Let me think. Typically, the process is:

1. Calculate the total cost of the vehicle including all options and fees.
2. Subtract any allowances (like the used car allowance) and the cash deposit, because these reduce the amount you need to finance.
3. Apply sales tax on the adjusted price.
4. Then, calculate the financing costs over two years. Or wait, maybe the financing cost is the interest on the loan.

Wait, but the cost of financing is given as 9.5% per year for two years. So that's an annual interest rate. So the total interest would be the principal times the rate times the time, but perhaps it's better to treat it as a simple interest calculation unless stated otherwise.

Wait, but in car loans, it's usually an installment loan with amortized payments, so maybe I should calculate the total amount including interest and then find the monthly payment that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost of financing is the total interest over two years. So 9.5% per year on the principal, so over two years, that's 19% of the principal. So the total amount to pay would be principal plus 19% interest.

But wait, some might calculate it as compound interest. But since it's for two years, 9.5% each year, simple interest would be 19%, but compound would be (1.095)^2 -1 = about 19.9025%, which is a bit higher. I'm not sure which method to use here. The question says "cost of financing: 9(1/2)% per year for two years." So it's probably simple interest, so total interest would be 2 * 9.5% = 19% of the principal.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost of financing is already calculated as a flat rate, so 9.5% per annum on the principal, so over two years, it's 19% of the principal.

So first, I need to calculate the total cost of the car, including all the added features, then subtract the deposit and the used car allowance, then calculate sales tax on that amount, then add the financing cost, and then determine the monthly payments over 24 months.

Wait, but sometimes sales tax is applied before subtracting the deposit and allowance. Hmm, I think the usual process is:

- Determine the total vehicle cost including all options.
- Subtract the trade-in allowance and cash deposit to get the amount financed.
- Then calculate sales tax on the amount after subtracting the deposit and allowance.
- Then calculate the interest on the financed amount.
But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes sales tax is applied to the total cost before any deductions. I'll have to think about the standard practice.

Wait, let's outline the steps as per standard car purchase calculations:

1. Calculate the total cost of the vehicle, including all factory and dealer installed options.
2. Subtract any trade-in allowance (used car allowance) and cash deposit to find the amount that needs to be financed.
3. Apply sales tax on the amount after subtracting the deposit and trade-in.
4. Then, calculate the financing cost (interest) on the financed amount.
5. The total amount to pay is the financed amount plus interest, divided into monthly payments.

Wait, but sometimes sales tax is applied before any deductions. So I'm a bit confused. Let me try to proceed carefully.

First, let's calculate the total vehicle cost. I'll add up all the costs:

Price of the car: $5,779.00
Transportation charge: $73.00
Factory-installed equipment:
- Radio: $95.50
- Metallic paint: $59.90
- Racing stripes: $39.50
- Power steering: $98.00
- Wide radial tires: $198.10
- Air conditioning: $429.00
So sum these up: 95.50 +59.90=155.4; 155.4+39.5=194.9; 194.9+98=292.9; 292.9+198.1=491; 491+429=920. So factory-installed is $920.00

Dealer-installed:
Mirror: $8.50
Mats: $10.75
Undercoat: $35.00
Sum: 8.5 +10.75=19.25 +35=54.25

Insurance: two years total.
Collision: $505.75
Comprehensive: $231.50
Total insurance: 505.75 +231.5=737.25

So adding all these:

Price: 5,779.00
Transportation: 73.00
Factory: 920.00
Dealer:54.25
Insurance:737.25

So total is 5,779 +73 =5,852; +920=6,772; +54.25=6,826.25; +737.25=7,563.50

Wait, let me do the math step by step:

5,779.00 (price)
+73.00 (transport) = 5,852.00
+920.00 (factory) = 6,772.00
+54.25 (dealer) = 6,826.25
+737.25 (insurance) = 7,563.50

So total cost before any deductions is $7,563.50.

Now, subtract the used car allowance and cash deposit.

Used car allowance: $370.00
Cash deposit: $500.00
Total deductions: 370 +500=870.00

So, 7,563.50 - 870.00 = 6,693.50

Now, apply sales tax of 5% on this amount.

Sales tax: 5% of 6,693.50 = 0.05 * 6,693.50 = 334.675, which is approximately $334.68

So total after tax: 6,693.50 + 334.68 = 7,028.18

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, sometimes sales tax is applied before subtracting the deposit and allowance. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think: when you buy a car, the sales tax is usually applied to the purchase price after any trade-in is deducted. So, I think the correct approach is:

Total vehicle price including all options = $7,563.50

Subtract used car allowance ($370) and cash deposit ($500): 7,563.50 - 870 = 6,693.50

Then, apply sales tax on 6,693.50: 5% of 6,693.50 is 334.675, about $334.68. So total becomes 6,693.50 + 334.68 = 7,028.18

Now, the cost of financing is 9.5% per year for two years. So that's 19% of the principal. The principal here is the amount after tax, which is 7,028.18.

So the total interest would be 7,028.18 * 0.19 = let's calculate that.

7,028.18 * 0.19:

Calculate 7,000 *0.19=1,330.00
28.18 *0.19≈5.3542
So total ≈1,335.35

So total amount to pay is 7,028.18 + 1,335.35 = 8,363.53

Wait, but wait, is the financing cost applied to the pre-tax amount or the post-tax? Hmm, I think the financing is on the amount after tax, because that's the amount you're borrowing. So yes, the 7,028.18 is the amount financed, so 19% of that is the interest.

So total amount to pay back is 7,028.18 + 1,335.35 = 8,363.53

Wait, but another approach could be that the financing cost is calculated as 9.5% per annum on the principal, so for two years, it's 9.5% *2 =19% simple interest.

Alternatively, if it's compound interest, it would be (1.095)^2 -1 = 0.199025, so 19.9025%, which would be a bit more, but the question says 9.5% per year, so perhaps it's simple interest.

So moving on, total amount is $8,363.53.

Now, this amount is to be paid over 24 months (two years). So the monthly payment would be 8,363.53 /24 = let's see.

8,363.53 divided by 24:

24 * 349 = 8,376, which is a bit higher than 8,363.53. So 349 would give 24*349=8,376, which is $12.47 more than needed.

So perhaps approximately $349 per month.

Wait, but let me do the division properly.

8,363.53 ÷24.

24 × 348 = 24×300=7,200; 24×48=1,152 → 7,200 +1,152=8,352. So 24×348=8,352.00

Subtract from 8,363.53: 8,363.53 -8,352=11.53

So 348 with a remainder of 11.53. So the monthly payment would be $348 + (11.53/24) ≈348 + 0.48≈$348.48 per month.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option J is $349, which is close. Option D is 344.42, which is lower.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the total amount. Let me go back and check each step.

Let me recap:

Total vehicle cost (including all options and insurance): $7,563.50

Subtract used car allowance and deposit: 7,563.50 - 370 -500 = 7,563.50 -870=6,693.50

Sales tax: 5% of 6,693.50= 334.675 → total after tax: 6,693.50 +334.675=7,028.175, approximately $7,028.18

Financing cost: 9.5% per year for two years → 19% of 7,028.18.

7,028.18 ×0.19:

Let me calculate this more accurately.

7,028.18 ×0.19:

7,000 ×0.19=1,330.00

28.18 ×0.19: 28 ×0.19=5.32, 0.18×0.19≈0.0342 → total ≈5.3542

So total interest is 1,330 +5.3542≈1,335.35

Total amount to pay: 7,028.18 +1,335.35=8,363.53

Divide by 24 months: 8,363.53 /24 ≈348.89, which is approximately $348.89 per month.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: $349.

Wait, but let me check if I applied the sales tax correctly. Because sometimes, the sales tax is applied before deducting the deposit and trade-in.

Wait, let me think again: in some states, sales tax is applied to the total purchase price before any trade-in or deposit. So if that's the case, the steps would be:

1. Total vehicle cost: $7,563.50

2. Apply sales tax on this amount: 5% of 7,563.50 = 378.175 → $378.18

3. Total after tax: 7,563.50 +378.18=7,941.68

4. Subtract deposit and trade-in: 7,941.68 -500 -370=7,941.68 -870=7,071.68

5. Then, calculate financing cost on 7,071.68 at 9.5% per year for two years → 19% of 7,071.68= 1,343.62

6. Total amount: 7,071.68 +1,343.62=8,415.30

7. Monthly payment: 8,415.30 /24≈350.66 → around $350.66, which isn't one of the options exactly, but option J is $349, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the sales tax is applied after subtracting the deposit and trade-in. So let me recalculate that possibility.

Option 1: Sales tax after deductions.

Total cost after deductions: 6,693.50

Sales tax: 5% → 334.68

Amount after tax: 7,028.18

Financing: 19% → 1,335.35

Total: 8,363.53

Monthly: 8,363.53/24≈348.89 → $349 (option J)

Option 2: Sales tax before deductions.

Total cost: 7,563.50

Sales tax: 378.18 → total 7,941.68

Subtract deposit and trade-in: 7,941.68-870=7,071.68

Financing: 19% →1,343.62

Total: 8,415.30 → monthly ≈350.66

But none of the options exactly match this, so perhaps the first approach is correct, leading to approximately $349, which is option J.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option J is $349, and option D is $344.42, which is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in including the insurance in the total cost. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, the problem includes insurance as part of the costs. It says "Insurance: Collision... for two years Comprehensive... for two years." So I added those to the total cost. But is that correct?

Wait, perhaps the insurance is paid separately and not included in the financed amount. Because when you buy a car, the insurance is usually paid upfront or through a separate payment, not financed as part of the loan. So maybe I should not include the insurance in the total cost that's being financed.

Oh, that's a good point. Because the problem says "find the amount to be paid each month in order to pay off the car described below in two years." So perhaps the insurance is a separate expense, not part of the loan.

So I think I made a mistake by including the insurance in the total cost. Let me recalculate without including the insurance.

So, the total vehicle cost without insurance would be:

Price:5,779.00
Transport:73.00
Factory:920.00
Dealer:54.25
Insurance:0 (since it's excluded)
Total:5,779+73=5,852 +920=6,772 +54.25=6,826.25

Then, subtract used car allowance and deposit: 6,826.25 -370 -500=6,826.25 -870=5,956.25

Apply sales tax: 5% of 5,956.25= 298.8125 → $298.81

Total after tax:5,956.25 +298.81=6,255.06

Financing cost:9.5% per year for two years →19% of 6,255.06=1,188.46

Total amount:6,255.06 +1,188.46=7,443.52

Monthly payment:7,443.52 /24=310.22, which is option E.

Wait, that's a big difference. So perhaps I should not have included the insurance in the total cost. Because the insurance is a separate expense, not part of the vehicle purchase.

But the problem states all the costs, including insurance. So I'm confused. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "Find the amount to be paid each month in order to pay off car described below in two years."

The car is described with several components, including insurance. So perhaps the insurance is part of the total cost that's being financed.

But that doesn't make much sense because usually, insurance isn't financed; it's paid separately. However, the problem might be including it as part of the total cost. So perhaps I should include it.

But let's proceed with both scenarios.

Scenario 1: Including insurance.

As before, total after insurance:7,563.50

Subtract deposit and allowance:6,693.50

Sales tax: 5% →334.68 →7,028.18

Financing:19% →1,335.35 →8,363.53

Monthly: ≈348.89 → option J ($349)

Scenario 2: Excluding insurance.

Total without insurance:6,826.25

Subtract deposit and allowance:5,956.25

Sales tax: 5% →298.81 →6,255.06

Financing:19% →1,188.46 →7,443.52

Monthly:7,443.52/24=310.22 → option E.

So which approach is correct? That's the key question.

I think in reality, insurance isn't included in the financed amount, so the correct approach would be to exclude it. Therefore, the monthly payment would be approximately $310.22, which is option E.

Wait, but the problem includes insurance as part of the costs, so perhaps we have to include it
