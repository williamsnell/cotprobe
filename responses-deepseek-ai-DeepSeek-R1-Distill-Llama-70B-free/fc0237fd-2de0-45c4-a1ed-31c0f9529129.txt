Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a uniform rigid bar in equilibrium, and I need to find its equation of motion using Lagrange's equations. Hmm. Alright, let's break this down.

So, the setup is a bar of weight W and length l. It's maintained in a horizontal position by a vertical spring at one end. The other end is pinned to the wall. When it's depressed slightly and released, I need to find the equation of motion.

Wait, the bar is initially horizontal. When it's displaced slightly (so, made to rotate a bit), it will oscillate. Since it's a rotational system, I think I should model the motion using rotational coordinates. The bar is pivoted at one end, so the angle θ will be the variable here.

First, I need to find the Lagrangian, which is the kinetic energy (T) minus the potential energy (V). But wait, the potential here is from both gravity and the spring, right? Or is the spring already in equilibrium?

Wait, when the bar is in equilibrium, the spring is stretched due to the weight. So when the bar is displaced, the spring will either stretch more or less, depending on the direction. Hmm.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of small angles, so that sinθ ≈ θ and cosθ ≈ 1. That should simplify things.

Let me consider the system. The bar is uniform, so its center of mass is at the midpoint. When it's displaced by a small angle θ, the other end (with the spring) moves, stretching or compressing the spring.

Wait, when the bar rotates, the end with the spring moves vertically. Let me find the vertical displacement of that end because that's what affects the spring's potential energy.

The length of the bar is l, so when it rotates by θ, the vertical displacement of the spring end is approximately lθ, assuming small angles so that θ in radians is small.

Wait, actually, the vertical displacement would be the arc length. For small angles, the vertical change is l*(1 - cosθ) ≈ l*(θ²/2). Hmm, but maybe that's not the right approach here. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the potential energy correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the potential energy from both the spring and gravity. So, when the bar is rotated by θ, the spring is stretched by an amount that depends on θ.

Wait no, the spring is vertical, right? So when the bar is displaced, the spring end moves down (or up, depending on direction). Let me think: in the equilibrium position, the spring is stretched by an amount due to the bar's weight. When the bar is rotated, the spring's stretch changes.

Wait, maybe I should model the system's potential energy as a combination of gravitational potential and elastic potential.

So, gravitational potential: when the bar is rotated by θ, the center of mass is lowered by a certain amount. For small θ, that would be (l/2)(1 - cosθ). So the change in height is approximately (l/2)(θ²/2) for small angles. But wait, because when θ is small, cosθ ≈ 1 - θ²/2. So the center of mass goes down by (l/2)(θ²/2) = l θ² /4. So the gravitational potential energy change is W * (l θ² /4), because potential energy is weight times height.

Wait, but actually, since the bar is being rotated, the potential energy due to gravity would be W times the vertical displacement of the center of mass. So yes, that's (l/2)(1 - cosθ) times W. But since θ is small, 1 - cosθ ≈ θ²/2, so V_gravity ≈ W*(l/2)*(θ²/2) )= W l θ² /4.

Now, the potential energy from the spring. The spring is at the end, so when the bar is rotated, the spring compresses or extends. The amount it's stretched is the vertical displacement of that end. The end of the bar moves vertically by (l θ) when θ is small, right? Because for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so the vertical displacement is approximately l θ. But wait, thinking again: the spring is in the vertical direction. When the bar is rotated, the end moves down by an amount equal to the arc length? Or is it the vertical component?

Hmm, when the bar is horizontal, the spring is stretched by the full weight. When the bar is rotated by θ, the end point moves up or down. Wait, no. Let me think about it. When the bar is displaced, the end with the spring moves in a circular path. The vertical position of that end is l sinθ (assuming θ is the angle from the horizontal). Wait, no: if the bar is in the horizontal position when θ=0, then when it's rotated, the end goes down, so perhaps the vertical displacement is h = l (1 - cosθ). Because when θ=0, cosθ=1, h=0; when θ increases, h increases.

Wait, that makes sense. So the spring's stretch would be delta = l (1 - cosθ). So the potential energy stored in the spring is (1/2)k (delta)^2. So V_spring = (1/2)k [l (1 - cosθ)]².

But wait, in the equilibrium position, the spring is already stretched by the bar's weight. So perhaps I should model the potential energy relative to that equilibrium point. Because when we do Lagrangian mechanics, we can set the equilibrium position as the zero of potential energy, but I think it's easier to include it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to expand the potential energies in terms of θ and keep only the quadratic terms, since higher-order terms can be neglected for small oscillations.

So let's proceed.

First, the kinetic energy T: since it's a rigid bar rotating about one end (a pivot), T is (1/2) I ω², where I is the moment of inertia.

The moment of inertia for a uniform bar about one end is (1/3) m l². But since the weight is W, and weight W = m g, so m = W/g. So I = (1/3)(W/g) l².

The angular velocity ω is the time derivative of θ, so ω = dθ/dt = θ'. So kinetic energy T = (1/2) I (θ')² = (1/2)(W l²/(3 g)) (θ')².

Now the potential energy V has two parts: gravitational and spring.

Gravitational potential: as the bar rotates, the center of mass (at l/2) is raised or lowered. The change in height is h = (l/2)(1 - cosθ). So V_gravity = W h ≈ W (l/2)(θ²/2) )= W l θ² /4.

Wait, because for small θ, 1 - cosθ ≈ θ²/2. So yes, that becomes W l θ² /4.

Spring potential: the spring is stretched by an amount delta = l (1 - cosθ). So V_spring = (1/2) k (delta)^2 = (1/2) k [l (1 - cosθ)]^2. Expanding that, (1 - cosθ)^2 ≈ (θ²/2)^2 = θ^4 /4, but wait, that would be higher order. Wait, no: [l (1 - cosθ)]^2 = l² (1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ). Hmm, but for small θ, cosθ ≈ 1 - θ²/2, so 1 - cosθ ≈ θ²/2, and cos²θ ≈ (1 - θ²/2)^2 ≈ 1 - θ². So,

(1 - cosθ)^2 ≈ (θ²/2)^2 = θ^4 /4. Hmm, but that's fourth order in θ. But for small θ, perhaps I can approximate [1 - cosθ]^2 as (θ²/2)^2, but maybe it's better to keep terms up to θ².

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me expand [l(1 - cosθ)]^2 = l² (1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ) = l² [2(1 - cosθ)] because 1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ = 2(1 - cosθ) when cosθ is near 1. Wait, no:

Wait, 1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ = (1 - cosθ)^2. Oh, right. So [l(1 - cosθ)]^2 = l² (1 - cosθ)^2. For small θ, (1 - cosθ) ≈ θ²/2, so (1 - cosθ)^2 ≈ θ^4 /4. But this is a quartic term, which for small oscillations may be negligible compared to the quadratic terms. Wait, but in the Lagrangian, the potential energy for the spring would contribute a term proportional to θ^4, which for small θ would be negligible. So perhaps, in the harmonic approximation, we can ignore the θ^4 term and consider only up to θ².

Wait, but wait another thought. If the bar is slightly depressed, the displacement is small, so θ is small. So in the expansion of V_spring, the leading term would be quadratic in θ. Let me see: [l (1 - cosθ)]^2 is l² (θ^4 /4), which is quartic. Hmm, but that seems problematic because then the spring's potential would be quartic, not quadratic. But that can't be right, because for oscillations, we expect a quadratic potential leading to simple harmonic motion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the displacement. Let me think again. The spring is at the end of the bar, which is pivoted. So when the bar is rotated by θ, the spring's end moves in a circle of radius l. The vertical displacement of that point is l(1 - cosθ) as I thought earlier. So the spring's stretch is delta = l (1 - cosθ). So the potential energy is (1/2)k (delta)^2 = (1/2)k l² (1 - cosθ)^2.

But expanding (1 - cosθ)^2 gives 1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ. For small θ, cosθ ≈ 1 - θ²/2, so 1 - cosθ ≈ θ²/2. Then, (1 - cosθ)^2 ≈ θ^4/4, which is quartic. So the spring's potential energy would be (1/2)k l² (θ^4/4) = (k l² θ^4)/8, which is a quartic term. That suggests that the potential energy isn't quadratic, which is confusing because I thought the system would undergo simple harmonic motion, implying a quadratic potential.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the vertical displacement isn't l(1 - cosθ), but something else. Let me consider the bar's end point. The vertical position when the bar is rotated by θ is y = l sinθ? No, wait, when θ is measured from the horizontal, the vertical displacement from the equilibrium (horizontal) position would be y = l (1 - cosθ). Because at θ=0, y=0; at θ=π/2, y=l(1 - 0)=l.

Wait, but in the equilibrium position, the bar is horizontal, so θ=0. So when the bar is rotated downward, the end moves down, stretching the spring further. So the vertical displacement of the spring end is Δy = l (1 - cosθ). So the spring's extension is Δy, so the potential energy is (1/2)k (Δy)^2 = (1/2)k [l (1 - cosθ)]^2.

But because (1 - cosθ) ≈ θ²/2 for small θ, [l (1 - cosθ)]^2 ≈ l² θ^4 /4. So V_spring ≈ (1/2)k (l² θ^4 /4) )= (k l² θ^4)/8.

Hmm, but that's a quartic term, which would make the potential energy not quadratic in θ. But that can't be right because we expect the equation of motion to be a simple harmonic oscillator equation (i.e., quadratic potential leading to θ'' + ω² θ =0).

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the coordinate. Maybe the correct approach is to model the displacement in terms of θ, but perhaps the potential energy from the spring is actually linear in θ^2, and the gravitational potential is also quadratic in θ, so their sum gives a quadratic potential.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let's expand V_spring and V_gravity up to θ^2 terms.

V_gravity = W * (l/2)(1 - cosθ) ≈ W*(l/2)(θ²/2) )= (W l θ²)/4.

V_spring = (1/2)k [l (1 - cosθ)]^2 = (1/2)k l² (1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ).

Expanding each term:

1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ = 1 - 2(1 - θ²/2) + (1 - θ²/2)^2.

Wait, let's compute it step by step.

cosθ ≈ 1 - θ²/2 + θ^4/24... So 1 - cosθ ≈ θ²/2 - θ^4/24.

(1 - cosθ)^2 ≈ (θ²/2)^2 = θ^4/4.

But perhaps we can approach it by expanding 1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ as follows:

= 1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ
= (1 - cosθ)^2
≈ (θ²/2)^2 = θ^4/4.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So V_spring would be (1/2) k l² (θ^4/4) )= (k l² θ^4)/8.

Wait, that's a problem because when θ is small, the potential energy from the spring is quartic, which would lead to anharmonic terms. But the question says the bar is "depressed slightly", so perhaps the system is undergoing small oscillations, and the quartic term can be neglected? But that doesn't seem right because for a spring, the potential is quadratic. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the expression for the spring's displacement. Let me think again. The spring is vertical and attached to the end of the bar. When the bar is in the horizontal position, the spring is stretched by some amount due to the bar's weight. But when the bar is rotated, the spring's displacement changes. So perhaps the displacement from the equilibrium position is what's important, not the absolute displacement.

Wait, let me model it correctly. Let me denote x as the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. So in equilibrium, the spring is stretched by x0 = (W)/k, because the spring force k x0 balances the bar's weight W.

When the bar is rotated by θ, the end of the bar moves downward by an amount y = l (1 - cosθ). So the spring's displacement becomes x = x0 + y. But since y = l (1 - cosθ), the new displacement is x = x0 + l (1 - cosθ). The potential energy of the spring is then (1/2)k x^2.

But wait, the potential energy in the spring is (1/2)k (x)^2. However, in the Lagrangian, we usually take the potential energy relative to the equilibrium position, so perhaps we can expand it in terms of small y.

Wait, because when θ is small, y = l (1 - cosθ) ≈ l (θ²/2). So x = x0 + y, but since x0 is the equilibrium displacement, the change in x from equilibrium is y. So the potential energy relative to equilibrium is (1/2)k (y)^2 = (1/2)k (l (1 - cosθ))^2.

But again, that leads to a quartic term when expanded. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is setup in a way that the spring's displacement is actually proportional to θ, not θ squared. Let me think about the geometry again.

Wait, the bar is pivoted at one end, and the spring is attached to the other end. When the bar is rotated by θ, the vertical displacement of the spring's end is l (1 - cosθ). But perhaps the horizontal displacement is l sinθ. But the spring is vertical, so only the vertical displacement affects the spring's stretch.

Wait, but in reality, the spring's stretch depends on the vertical component of the displacement. So when the bar rotates by θ, the vertical displacement is l (1 - cosθ), so the spring's stretch from equilibrium is delta = l (1 - cosθ). But in equilibrium, the spring is already stretched by x0 = W/k, because at equilibrium, the spring force k x0 balances the weight W.

So when the bar is rotated, the spring is stretched further by l (1 - cosθ). So the total stretch is x0 + l (1 - cosθ). So the potential energy is (1/2)k (x0 + l (1 - cosθ))².

But x0 = W/k, so substituting:

V_spring = (1/2)k (W/k + l (1 - cosθ))².

Expanding this:

= (1/2)k [ (W/k)^2 + 2 (W/k)(l (1 - cosθ)) + l² (1 - cosθ)^2 ) ]

But when θ is small, 1 - cosθ ≈ θ²/2, so:

= (1/2)k [ (W²/k²) + 2 (W/k)(l θ²/2) + l² (θ^4/4) ) ]

Simplify each term:

= (1/2)k [ W²/k² + (W l θ²)/k + (l² θ^4)/(4) ) ]

= (1/2) [ W²/k + W l θ² + (k l² θ^4)/4 ) ]

Now, the term W²/k is a constant and doesn't affect the equations of motion. The term with θ² is (1/2) W l θ², and the term with θ^4 is (1/2)(k l² θ^4)/4 = (k l² θ^4)/8.

But when considering small oscillations, the θ^4 term is negligible compared to the θ² term. So perhaps the potential energy from the spring is approximately (1/2) W l θ². Wait, but that can't
