Okay, so I have this problem here about converters operating in both rectified and inverted modes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is in two parts. Part (1) is about a single-phase converter operating as a rectifier, and part (2) is the same converter operating inverted, as an inverter. I need to find various voltages and currents for each part.

Starting with part (1): A 1.5-kW single-phase converter operating at full load from a 230-volt AC source. They assume a power factor of unity and neglect losses. So I need to find the DC voltage and current, and the AC input current.

Alright, for a rectifier, the DC output power is equal to the AC input power since there are no losses. The power factor is 1, so that simplifies things. 

So, for part (1a), the DC voltage and current. I remember that for a single-phase full-wave rectifier, the DC voltage (V_dc) is approximately equal to the RMS value of the AC voltage if we're assuming no drop in the rectifier. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the maximum DC voltage for a full-wave rectifier is the peak AC voltage multiplied by the rectification ratio. Wait, no, the DC voltage is the average value of the rectified AC waveform.

Wait, no, wait. For a single-phase full-wave rectifier, the average DC voltage V_avg is (2 * V_peak * π)/ (2π) )? No, wait, I think I'm mixing things. Let me think again.

The RMS value of the AC voltage is V_rms = 230 V. For a full-wave rectifier, the average DC voltage V_dc is approximately equal to the RMS value times the square root of 2 divided by π? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recall the formula.

Wait, for a full-wave rectifier, the average DC voltage V_avg is (2 * V_m)/π, where V_m is the peak (max) AC voltage. Since V_rms is 230 V, V_m is V_rms * sqrt(2) ≈ 230 * 1.414 ≈ 325.22 V. Then V_avg = (2 * 325.22) / π ≈ 650.44 / 3.1416 ≈ around 207 V. Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the DC voltage is the same as the AC RMS value. Or is it using a different approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a half-wave rectifier? No, because a single-phase converter as a rectifier is usually full-wave.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says it's a single-phase converter operating at full load, assuming a power factor of unity. So the AC input is 230 V, and power factor is 1, so the AC current is I = P / V. But wait, the power is 1.5 kW, which is 1500 W.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in part (1), when it's acting as a rectifier, the AC is the input, and DC is the output. So the AC power is equal to DC power because no losses. So, P = V_ac * I_ac (since power factor is 1, so P = V * I). So I_ac = P / V_ac. So I_ac = 1500 W / 230 V ≈ 6.5217 A. But looking at the options, part 1(b) in option B is 6.6 A, but others are close too.

Wait, but part (1a) is DC voltage and current. So, for a single-phase full-wave rectifier, the DC voltage V_dc is (V_peak * 2)/π. Wait, V_peak is V_rms * sqrt(2). So V_peak = 230 * 1.414 ≈ 325 V. Then V_dc = (2 * 325) / π ≈ 650 / 3.1416 ≈ 207 V. Wait, but that's lower than the AC RMS of 230. But wait, in the options, the DC voltages are higher. So I'm getting something wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe the converter is a half-wave rectifier. But no, that would give V_dc = V_peak / π ≈ 325 / 3.14 ≈ 103.5 V. Which is even lower, but that's not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the formulas. Another approach: for a single-phase converter (rectifier) operating at unity power factor, the DC voltage can sometimes be considered as the same as the AC voltage if it's a certain type of converter, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, maybe the DC voltage is the same as the AC voltage because it's a single-phase converter. So if the AC is 230 V, then DC is also 230 V. But that would be the case in an ideal scenario without any voltage drop. But when I calculate, the average DC is around 207 V, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the DC voltage is equal to the RMS AC voltage, so V_dc = 230 V. Then the DC current I_dc would be P / V_dc = 1500 W / 230 V ≈ 6.521 A. Wait, that's similar to the AC current. But looking at the options, none of them have the DC voltage as 230. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the DC voltage is higher than AC? Oh, wait, no, in a rectifier, DC is derived from AC, so the DC voltage (average) is less than the peak AC voltage. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible DC voltage, which would be the peak of the AC. But that's not the average. So if I take V_dc_max = V_peak = 325 V. Then I_dc = 1500 / 325 ≈ 4.615 A. Hmm, looking at the options, option B for part (1a) is 340 V and 4.41 A. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the DC voltage is the same as the AC voltage because the converter is a rectifier, but perhaps it's a half-controlled or something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the assumption that the DC voltage is the same as the AC voltage for simplicity. So V_dc = 230 V. Then I_dc = 1500/230 ≈ 6.52 A. So AC input current I_ac would be the same as I_dc, but that's not correct because in a rectifier, the AC current is higher than DC.

Wait, no, in a rectifier, AC power equals DC power, so V_ac * I_ac = V_dc * I_dc. So if V_ac is 230, and assuming V_dc is 230, then I_ac would be same as I_dc, 6.52 A. But none of the options have that for part (1a). So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the DC voltage is higher. Wait, maybe it's a step-up converter, but that's not usual for a rectifier. Rectifiers usually step down.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again. For part (1a), option B has V_dc = 340 V, I_dc = 4.41 A. Let me compute P = 340 * 4.41 ≈ 1500 W, which matches. So 340 * 4.41 is indeed about 1500, so that makes sense.

But how do I get 340 V from the AC input of 230 V? That would require a step-up transformer, but the problem doesn't mention a transformer. Wait, the problem says "operates from a 230-volt AC source". So perhaps the converter is connected directly without a transformer. So the V_dc can't be higher than the AC source's peak.

Wait, the peak of 230 V AC is about 325 V. So the maximum DC voltage possible from a full-wave rectifier without any transformer would be (2 * V_peak)/π ≈ 207 V, as I calculated earlier. So how is option B having 340 V?

Hmm, maybe there's a step-up transformer in the converter. So perhaps V2 is higher than V1. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention a transformer. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the converter is operating in some other configuration. Maybe it's a different type, like a thyristor-based converter that can adjust the output voltage, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to part (2), maybe that will give me some insight.

Part (2): A 2.5-kW single-phase converter operating inverted, meaning it's an inverter. DC input voltage is 230 V. So now, the inverter converts DC to AC. So, the AC output power is 2.5 kW. Again, assuming no losses.

So part (2a) is the AC voltage. Well, when a converter operates as an inverter, the AC voltage depends on the circuit configuration. For a single-phase inverter, if it's a half-wave type, the AC voltage would be less, but I'm assuming it's a full-wave, perhaps square-wave.

But I'm a bit confused. Wait, as an inverter, the AC output voltage is typically the same as the DC input voltage if it's a square wave, but that's the peak value. The RMS would be different.

Wait, let's think. If the inverter produces a square wave, the RMS value of the AC voltage is V_rms = V_dc * (1/√2) ≈ 0.707 * V_dc. So for V_dc = 230 V, V_rms ≈ 230 * 0.707 ≈ 162.5 V.

Alternatively, if the inverter outputs a sine wave, then the peak value would be V_peak = V_dc = 230 V. So V_rms would be 230 / sqrt(2) ≈ 162.5 V.

So part (2a) AC voltage would be 162.5 V RMS. Now looking at the options, option G has 2(a) a-c voltage = 162.5 V. So that's possible.

Now part (2b): the AC current and DC current at full load. The power output is 2.5 kW, so AC current I_ac = P / V_ac. So 2500 W / 162.5 V ≈ 15.38 A. So AC current is about 15.4 A.

The DC current would be I_dc = P / V_dc = 2500 / 230 ≈ 10.87 A. So DC current is around 10.9 A.

Looking at the options, option G for part 2(b) has alternating current = 15.4 A and direct current = 10.9 A. So that matches.

So for part (2), option G seems correct.

Now going back to part (1), if option G is correct for part (2), then what about part (1)?

In part (1), the converter operates as a rectifier, 1.5 kW, 230 V AC.

Assuming the same setup as the inverter in part (2), perhaps the rectifier is using a certain configuration.

Wait, in part (1), the DC power is 1.5 kW, so V_dc * I_dc = 1500 W.

In option G, for part (1a), V_dc is 325 V, I_dc is 4.62 A. 325 *4.62 ≈ 1500 W, which fits.

But earlier I thought the DC voltage from a full-wave rectifier would be around 207 V, but option G has V_dc = 325 V, which is higher than the AC's peak of 325 V? Wait, no, because AC's peak is 325 V, so DC voltage can't be higher than that in a rectifier without a step-up transformer.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. If the AC is 230 V RMS, then peak is about 325 V. So in a full-wave rectifier, the average DC is (2 V_peak)/π ≈ 207 V. But option G says V_dc is 325 V, which is the same as V_peak. That would mean the DC voltage is equal to the peak AC voltage, which isn't possible because the average is lower.

Unless the rectifier is somehow producing a DC voltage equal to the peak, which isn't the case. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the converter is a different type, like a controlled rectifier where the voltage can be varied. But without more information, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me re-calculate.

In part (1a), V_dc = 230 V * sqrt(2) ? Because that would be about 325 V. But why would the DC voltage be higher than the AC RMS? That doesn't make sense unless there's a step-up transformer.

Wait, the problem says it's a single-phase converter operating from a 230 V AC source. So perhaps it's using a step-up transformer internally, but the problem doesn't mention it. So I'm not sure.

But looking at the options, option G in part (1a) has V_dc = 325 V. So let's see: if V_dc is 325 V, then I_dc = 1500 / 325 ≈ 4.615 A. Option G says 4.62 A, which matches.

Then the AC input current I_ac would be P / V_ac = 1500 / 230 ≈ 6.5217 A. Option G for part (1b) says 6.25 A, which is a bit lower. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formulas wrong. Since it's a rectifier, the AC current is related to the DC current by some factor. I think for a full-wave rectifier, the RMS AC current is equal to the DC current multiplied by the form factor.

Wait, the form factor for full-wave is 1.11. So I_rms (AC) = I_dc * 1.11.

So in option G, I_dc is 4.62 A, so I_rms would be 4.62 * 1.11 ≈ 5.13 A, which is much lower than 6.25 A in option G's part (1b). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between AC and DC currents.

Wait, when you have a rectifier, the power input on AC side equals the power output on DC side. So P = V_ac * I_ac = V_dc * I_dc.

So I_ac = (V_dc * I_dc) / V_ac = (325 * 4.62) / 230 ≈ (1500) / 230 ≈ 6.52 A. But option G's part (1b) is 6.25 A. So that doesn't match.

This suggests that option G isn't correct for part (1). Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in assuming option G is correct for part (2). Let me double-check.

In part (2), the inverter has DC input 230 V. The AC output would be a square wave, so V_rms = V_dc / sqrt(2) ≈ 162.5 V. So that part is correct.

Then, AC current I_ac = 2500 / 162.5 ≈ 15.38 A, which is around 15.4 A. DC current I_dc = 2500 / 230 ≈ 10.87 A, which is around 10.9 A. So that fits option G's part (2b).

So for part (2), option G seems correct.

But then for part (1), using the same option, the numbers don't add up. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the converter in part (1) is a half-wave rectifier. Then, the average DC voltage would be V_peak / π ≈ 325 / 3.14 ≈ 103.5 V. Then I_dc = 1500 / 103.5 ≈ 14.5 A. That's even worse. None of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the DC voltage is the RMS value of the AC, which is 230 V. Then I_dc = 1500 / 230 ≈ 6.52 A. Then I_ac would be the same as I_dc, but that's only if power factor is 1 and the voltage is the same. So I_ac = 6.52 A. Looking at the options, option A has I_ac =6 A, option B 6.6 A, option G 6.25 A.

But none of the options for part (1a) have V_dc =230 V. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for an option where part (2) matches, and see if part (1) also makes sense.

Looking at option B: part (2a) a-c voltage is 190 V. Which would be higher than what I calculated. If V_ac is 190 V, then I_ac =2500 /190 ≈13.16 A, which matches option B's part (2b) of 13.16 A. DC current would be 2500 /230 ≈10.87 A, but option B has 8.77 A for DC current. That doesn't match, so option B is not correct for part (2).

Option D: part (2a) a-c voltage is 200 V. Then I_ac =2500 /200=12.5 A. That matches option D's part (2b) of 12.5 A AC. DC current would be 2500/230≈10.87 A. Option D's part (2b) has DC current 8.3 A, which doesn't match. So D is out.

Option J: part (2a) a-c voltage 220 V. I_ac=2500/220≈11.36 A, which matches option J's 11.36 A. DC current 2500/230≈10.87 A, but option J has 7.58 A, which doesn't fit.

So only option G fits part (2) correctly. So I think option G is correct for part (2). But then part (1) in option G has V_dc=325V, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the converter is a step-down in part (1) and step-up in part (2). But without a transformer, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the inverter's AC voltage is 162.5 V. Maybe it's using a different waveform, like a modified sine wave, but that's unlikely for a single-phase inverter.

Wait, perhaps the inverter is producing a square
