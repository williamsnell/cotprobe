Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about which state's negligence law applies in a federal diversity case. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question involves a truck driver from State A and a bus driver from State B who collided in State B. The truck driver sued in federal court in State B under diversity jurisdiction, seeking $100,000 in damages. The issue is which state's negligence law the federal court should apply.

I remember that when a federal court hears a case based on diversity jurisdiction, it has to apply the substantive laws of the state in which it's sitting. But wait, does that mean the court just uses the law of the state where the court is located, or is there more to it?

I think it's more about conflict of laws. So the federal court will apply the choice of law rules of the state where the federal court is situated. In this case, the court is in State B, so it would use State B's conflict of laws principles to determine which state's law applies.

Wait, but what's the default rule for tort cases in diversity? I recall something about the "most significant relationship" test from the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. But whether the state follows that or something else like the "lex loci delicti" (law of the place where the tort occurred) rule is important.

In this scenario, the accident happened in State B. So if State B's conflict of laws rules point to its own law, then the federal court would apply State B's negligence law. Alternatively, if State B uses a different approach, like considering which state has the most significant relationship, that might be different.

But I think most states, when dealing with torts, apply the law of the place where the injury occurred. So since the accident was in State B, the court would likely apply State B's negligence law.

Looking at the options, option F says the court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that. That sounds right because the federal court uses the same conflict of laws rules as the state where it's situated.

Option G suggests using State A's law because that's the truck driver's state, but that doesn't make sense because the accident wasn't in State A. The other options don't seem to fit either. Option A is about federal common law, but I don't think that applies here since negligence is a state law issue. Option B is considering both states' laws, but the court doesn't pick which it thinks is better; it uses the forum state's conflict rules. Option C is about population, which I don't think is relevant. Option D is international, which isn't applicable here. Option E is about company headquarters, which doesn't seem to matter in this context.

So the correct answer should be F. The federal court applies the same negligence law as the State B court would, based on State B's conflict of laws rules.

The correct answer is based on the principle that in federal diversity jurisdiction, the court applies the substantive law of the state in which it is sitting. This includes using the state's conflict of laws rules to determine which jurisdiction's law applies. Here, the accident occurred in State B, and the federal court in State B would apply State B's negligence law as determined by its conflict of laws principles. 

Option F correctly reflects this by stating that the court should determine which state's negligence law a State B court would apply and apply that law. Other options either misapply the law or introduce irrelevant factors.

Answer: F
