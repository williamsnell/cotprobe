Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about electric machine windings. Hmm, the question has two parts, (a) and (b), each dealing with different types of windings. Let me start by understanding what each part is asking.

Part (a) says: A 4-pole machine has lap winding with 36 winding elements. What are the back and front pitches of this winding, expressed in commutator bars?

Wait, I remember that in lap windings, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles. So for a 4-pole machine, that's 4 parallel paths. The total number of winding elements (which I think are the coils or commutator segments) is 36. So each path should have 36/4 = 9 coils. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, in a lap winding, each parallel path has the same number of coils. So for P poles and Z commutator bars, the number of coils per path is Z/P. Wait, but wait—lap windings have the number of coils equal to the number of commutator bars, right? Or is it different?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The number of winding elements (commutator bars) is equal to the number of coils in wave and lap windings. For a lap winding, the number of coils per parallel path is Z/P. So if there are 36 commutator bars (which means 36 coils), and 4 poles, then each parallel path has 36/4 = 9 coils. So each path has 9 coils. 

Now, what's the pitch? The front pitch and back pitch. I think the front pitch is the number of commutator bars a coil spans when going from one commutator segment to the next in the same path. Similarly, the back pitch would be the same but maybe in the opposite direction. Or wait, maybe the front pitch is the number of segments between the start and finish of a coil in the front part, and the back pitch is the same but in the back. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, I recall that in a lap winding, the pitch is calculated as the number of segments between the start and end of a coil. For a lap winding, the front pitch Y is usually equal to the number of segments per pole, and the back pitch is Y+1 or Y-1, depending on the direction. Or wait, maybe I should think about the formula.

I think the formula for the pitch in a lap winding is given by Y = (Z/P) ± 1. Wait, no, perhaps it's Y = (Z/A) ± 1, where A is the number of parallel paths. Since in lap winding, A = P. So for this case, A=4, Z=36. So Y = 36/4 =9. Then the front pitch would be 9 +1=10? Or maybe 9-1=8? Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps for lap windings, the front pitch is (Z/A) +1, and the back pitch is (Z/A) -1? Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, I think the general formula for the pitch in a lap winding is Y = (Z/P) ± 1. Let me check my notes. Oh wait, in a lap winding, the coil pitch is usually such that the back pitch is one more or one less than the front pitch. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, the formula I remember is that for a lap winding, the number of commutator bars Z is equal to the number of coils, and the pitch is calculated as (Z ± 1)/A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the front pitch is (Z - 1)/P, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the number of coils per path. Since each path has 9 coils, the front pitch would be the number of segments each coil spans. So in a 4-pole machine with 36 bars, each path has 9 coils. So the front pitch is 9, and the back pitch is 9 as well? No, that can't be right because in a lap winding, the front and back pitches are usually different by one segment.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the formula for the lap winding pitch. I think the formula for the front pitch is (Z - A)/A, and the back pitch is (Z + A)/A. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

Another approach: The number of commutator bars Z is equal to the number of coils. In a lap winding, each coil spans a certain number of bars, which is the pitch. The front pitch is the number of bars a coil spans in the front, and the back pitch is the same but in the opposite direction.

Wait, perhaps the front pitch Y is given by Y = (Z - 1)/P + 1. Or maybe Y = (Z/A) ± 1. Let me try plugging in the numbers. Z is 36, A is 4 (since lap winding A=P=4). So Z/A is 9. So front pitch is 9 +1=10? Or 9-1=8? Hmm.

Wait, I think the formula is that for a lap winding, the front pitch is (Z/A) + 1, and the back pitch is (Z/A) -1. So in this case, 9 +1=10 and 9 -1=8. So front pitch is 10, back pitch is 8. Alternatively, maybe the other way around, with front being 9-1=8 and back 9+1=10. But I'm not sure which is which.

Wait, looking for a rule of thumb. For lap windings, the front pitch is usually (Z/A) +1, and the back pitch is (Z/A) -1. So for 36/4=9, front is 10, back is 8. So the front pitch is 10 and back is 8. But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe sometimes the back pitch is (Z/A) +1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the front pitch is (Z + A)/A. So (36+4)/4=40/4=10. And the back pitch is (Z - A)/A=(36-4)/4=32/4=8. So that gives front=10, back=8. So for part (a), the front pitch is 10 and back is 8? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing front and back.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the direction in which the coils are connected. The front pitch is the number of segments a coil spans in the forward direction, and the back pitch is the same but in the reverse. So for a lap winding, the front pitch would be (Z/A) +1, and the back would be (Z/A) -1, but I'm not entirely sure about the addition and subtraction.

Wait, maybe another approach. The total number of segments is 36. The number of poles is 4, so in a lap winding, there are 4 parallel paths. Each path has 36/4=9 segments. So each path has 9 segments, meaning each coil in a path spans 9 segments. Wait, but the pitch is the number of segments between the start and end of a coil. So if a coil is in a path that has 9 segments, then the pitch would be 9? But that can't be right because front and back pitches are different.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me think again. The number of commutator bars Z is 36, and the number of poles P is 4, so the number of parallel paths A is 4. So each parallel path has Z/A = 36/4 =9 coils. So each path has 9 coils. Now, for a lap winding, the front pitch Y is calculated as (Z/A) + 1. So Y=9+1=10. And the back pitch is Y-2=8. Wait, why Y-2? Because if the front pitch is 10, then the back pitch would be 8, since the total in a loop would be Z. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the front and back pitches are (Z/A) and (Z/A)+1. No, that doesn't add up. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on to part (b) and see if that gives me any clues.

Part (b) says: A 4-pole machine has wave winding with 37 winding elements. What are the three pitches of this winding expressed in commutator bars?

Okay, wave winding. So in wave windings, the number of parallel paths A is 2, regardless of the number of poles. So for a 4-pole machine, A=2. The number of winding elements (commutator bars) is 37. So each parallel path has 37/2=18.5 coils. Wait, that's not possible because you can't have half a coil. Hmm, that must mean that the number of commutator bars is even in wave windings. Because for wave windings, Z must be even, right? Because A=2, so Z must be even. But here, Z is 37, which is odd. That's a problem. Wait, maybe that's a typo, but perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, maybe the question is correct, and I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the number of commutator bars in wave windings can be odd. Let me think. In wave windings, the number of coils is equal to the number of commutator bars. So if Z is 37, which is odd, then each parallel path would have (37+1)/2=19 coils. Because in wave windings, the formula for the number of coils per path is (Z ± 1)/A, where A=2. So (37 +1)/2=19. So each path has 19 coils.

Now, for wave windings, the pitch is determined by the number of segments each coil spans. The front pitch Y is given by Y = (Z ± 1)/P. Wait, that might not be right. Another formula I remember is that in a wave winding, the front pitch is (Z - 1)/P, and the back pitch is (Z + 1)/P. Alternatively, maybe it's Y = (Z + 1)/P for the front and Y = (Z - 1)/P for the back. 

Wait, let's try plugging in the numbers. Z=37, P=4. So (37+1)/4=38/4=9.5. Hmm, that can't be right because pitches are whole numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's (Z -1)/P. So (37-1)/4=36/4=9. That works. But then what's the other pitch? So front pitch is 9, and the other? Or is it that in wave windings, there are three pitches: the front, back, and another.

Wait, another approach. In a wave winding, each coil has a front pitch and a back pitch, and sometimes an additional pitch. Wait, no, in wave windings, I think each coil has a front pitch and a back pitch, and the third pitch is perhaps the commutator pitch, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the three pitches refer to the front, back, and the number of coils per path.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the formula for the pitch in wave windings. I think the front pitch Y is given by Y = (Z + 1)/P, but I'm not certain. Let me check with an example. For instance, if Z=37, P=4, then (37 + 1)/4 = 38/4 = 9.5. That's not possible, so maybe it's (Z-1)/P. (37-1)/4=36/4=9. So front pitch is 9. Then the back pitch would be 9 as well? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the back pitch is different.

Wait, another way: the front pitch and back pitch are related by Y + Y_back = Z. Or perhaps Y_front + Y_back = 2Y. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, in wave windings, the front pitch is Y, and the back pitch is Y + 2. Because each time you go around, the pitch increases by two segments. So if Y_front is 9, then Y_back is 11. But wait, that might not add up with Z=37.

Alternatively, maybe the front pitch is (Z + 1)/P = (37 +1)/4=9.5. That's not possible, so perhaps the formula is (Z -1)/P = 9. Then the back pitch would be 9 + 2=11, because each full loop around would add two to the pitch. So front is 9, back is 11. And maybe the third pitch is 10? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps in wave windings, the front and back pitches are Y and Y+2, and sometimes another pitch Y-2 is used, but I'm not certain. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to think of it differently. The number of coils per path is 19. So each path has 19 coils. Now, the pitch in a wave winding is such that each coil spans Y segments, and since the machine is 4-pole, the pitch Y must satisfy Y*2 = Z ± something. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the front pitch is (Z - 1)/P. So (37-1)/4=9. So front pitch is 9. Then the back pitch would be (Z +1)/P=38/4=9.5. That's not an integer, so maybe it's (Z + 1 - 2)/P = (35)/4=8.75. No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on part (b). Let me go back to part (a) and see if I can figure that out again, maybe the options will give me a clue.

Looking at the options, for part (a), the lap winding with 36 elements:

Option A: Back pitch 12, front 13.

Option B: Back 9, front 10.

Option C: Back 8, front 9.

Option D: Back 8, front 9 or 10.

Option E: Back 9, front 11 or 12.

Option F: Back 11, front 9.

Option G: Back 7, front 6.

Option H: Back 10, front 8.

Option I: Back 10, front 11.

Option J: Back 9, front 8.

Wait, from my earlier calculation, I thought for lap winding, the front pitch is 10 and back is 8. Let me look for an option that has front=10 and back=8. Looking through the options, none of them exactly match that. Wait, option B has front=10 and back=9. Option J has front=8 and back=9. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got the front and back pitches reversed. If the front pitch is 8 and back is 9, which would be option J. Or perhaps I had the formula wrong, and the front is 9 and back is 10. No, that doesn't make sense because 9+10=19, which is more than 18 (since each path has 9 coils, 9+9=18). Hmm, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the total number of segments. For a lap winding, the sum of the front and back pitches should equal the number of segments per path multiplied by 2 minus 1. Because each time you go front and back, you cover all the segments in the path. So for 9 segments, front Y and back (Y +1) would sum to 2Y +1 = 9*2 -1=17? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe Y + (Y +1) = 2Y +1 = 9. So 2Y=8 → Y=4. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the front and back pitches add up to the number of segments per path plus one. So Y_front + Y_back = 9 +1=10. So possible combinations are 4 and 6, 5 and5, etc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The number of commutator bars is 36, poles=4, so A=4. Each path has 9 bars. The front pitch is the number of bars each coil spans in the front, and the back pitch in the back.

I think the correct formula for lap windings is that the front pitch is (Z/A) - 1 and the back pitch is (Z/A) + 1. So for Z=36, A=4: 36/4=9. So front=8, back=10. So part (a) would have front=8 and back=10. But looking at the options, none of the options have front=8 and back=10. Wait, option D says back=8, front=9 or10. Option J has back=9, front=8.

Wait, perhaps I've got it reversed. Maybe front pitch is (Z/A)+1 and back is (Z/A)-1. So that would be front=10, back=8. Looking at the options, is there an option where front=10 and back=8? Let me check. Option B: front=10, back=9. No. Option H: front=8, back=10. Yes, option H says back=10, front=8. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, the correct formula I think is that for lap windings, the front pitch is (Z/A) + 1 and the back pitch is (Z/A) -1. So front=10, back=8. Looking at the options, the only option with front=10 is option B, which says back=9 and front=10. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think of an example. Suppose Z=12, P=4. Then A=4, Z/A=3. So front pitch=4, back=2. So the front pitch is 4, back is 2. So the formula would be front=(Z/A)+1=3+1=4, back=(Z/A)-1=2. So that makes sense. So applying that to our problem, Z=36, A=4, so front=10, back=8. So looking for an option where part (a) has front=10 and back=8. But none of
