Okay, so I have this insurance problem here, and I need to figure out the premium for a 15-day policy. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The furniture is valued at $1,500, and the annual premium rate is $1.25 per $100. Hmm, so I think the first step is to calculate what the annual premium would be for $1,500, and then figure out what 15 days of that would cost.

Wait, right. So per $100 of value, the annual premium is $1.25. That means for every $100, you pay $1.25 each year. So for $1,500, I need to find out how many $100 units are in that. Let me do the math: 1500 divided by 100 is 15. So that's 15 units of $100 each.

So the annual premium would be 15 times $1.25. Let me calculate that: 15 * 1.25. Well, 10 times 1.25 is 12.5, and 5 times 1.25 is 6.25. So 12.5 + 6.25 is 18.75. So the annual premium is $18.75.

But wait, the policy is only for 15 days. So I need to find out what fraction of a year 15 days is. A year has 365 days, right? So 15 divided by 365. Let me compute that: 15/365. Hmm, I think that's approximately 0.0411 (since 365 divided by 15 is around 24.33, so 1/24.33 is about 0.0411).

So the premium for 15 days would be the annual premium multiplied by (15/365). So that's 18.75 * (15/365). Let me calculate that.

First, let me compute 15/365. Let me simplify it: 15 divided by 365. Well, 15 divided by 365 is the same as 3 divided by 73, which is approximately 0.0411.

So 18.75 multiplied by 0.0411. Let me do that step by step. 18 * 0.0411 is about 0.7418, and 0.75 * 0.0411 is about 0.030825. Adding those together gives approximately 0.7418 + 0.030825 = 0.7726. So the total would be around $0.7726.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option close to $0.77. Let me check my calculations again because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe it's better to compute the daily rate first. The annual premium is $1.25 per $100. So per day, that would be 1.25 divided by 365. So 1.25 / 365. Let me calculate that: 1.25 / 365 is approximately 0.00342 per $100 per day.

Now, the furniture is $1,500, which is 15 times $100. So the daily premium would be 15 * 0.00342. Let me compute that: 15 * 0.00342 is 0.0513 per day.

Then, for 15 days, multiply by 15: 0.0513 * 15 = approximately 0.7695, so around $0.77.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the options again.

The options are: A: 3.75, B:1.25, C:15, D:18.75, E:2.44, F:6.25, G:0.31, H:5, I:12.50, J:22.50.

Wait, none of these are around $0.77. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait a second, perhaps the time period is being calculated differently. Maybe the 15 days is considered as a fraction of the year in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the rate is monthly instead of daily? No, the question says annual premium, so it's per year.

Wait, perhaps the 15 days is being treated as 15/365 of the annual rate. Let me double-check that.

Wait, the annual premium is $18.75 for the $1,500. So 15 days would be (15/365) * 18.75. Let me compute that accurately.

15/365 equals approximately 0.041096. So 0.041096 multiplied by 18.75.

Let me compute 18.75 * 0.041096.

First, 18 * 0.041096 = 0.7397, and 0.75 * 0.041096 = 0.030822. Adding them gives 0.7397 + 0.030822 = 0.77052, which is approximately $0.77.

Wait, but the options don't have $0.77. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the annual premium.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe the rate is $1.25 per $100 per year. So for $1,500, which is 15 * $100, the annual premium is 15 * 1.25 = $18.75, as I had before.

But the policy is for 15 days. So 15 days is 15/365 of a year. So the premium is 18.75 * (15/365) = approx $0.77.

But none of the options are close to that. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the 15-day policy is for 15 days, but the way the rate is applied is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 15-day rate, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, looking back at the options, option G is $0.31, which is way lower. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as (1.25 / 100) * 1500 * (15/365). Let me compute that.

Wait, 1.25 per $100 annually. So per day, it's 1.25 / 365 per $100. So for $1500, which is 15 * $100, the daily rate is 15 * (1.25 / 365) = (15 * 1.25) / 365 = 18.75 / 365 ≈ 0.0513 per day.

Then, 15 days would be 0.0513 * 15 ≈ 0.7695, so about $0.77.

Hmm, so I'm getting $0.77, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the question uses a different time frame. 15 days could be considered as 1/24 of a year, because 365/15 is about 24. So 1.25 * (1500/100) * (15/365).

Wait, 15/365 is 3/73, which is approximately 0.0411.

So 15 * 1.25 is 18.75, as before. 18.75 * 0.0411 is 0.77.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 18.75 * 15 = 281.25, then divide by 365. 281.25 / 365. Let me compute that.

365 goes into 281.25 how many times? 365 * 0.7 is 255.5, 0.77 * 365 is 281.05. So 0.77 times 365 is 281.05, which is very close to 281.25. So 281.25 /365 is 0.77 exactly? Wait, 281.25 divided by 365 is 0.77?

Wait 365 * 0.77 = 365*(0.7 + 0.07) = 255.5 + 25.55 = 281.05. So 281.25 is 0.20 more than 281.05, so that's 0.77 + (0.20 /365) ≈ 0.77 + 0.000547 ≈ 0.7705.

So about $0.77.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe it's a simple proportion. If the annual rate is $1.25 per $100, then the daily rate is 1.25 / 365 per $100.

So for $1,500, which is 15 * $100, the daily premium is 15 * (1.25 / 365) = 18.75 / 365 ≈ 0.0513 per day.

So for 15 days, 0.0513 *15 = 0.7695, which is approximately $0.77.

Again, same result, but no option matches.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Oh wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check Option E: $2.44. That's higher than $0.77. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the time period. Let me think differently. Maybe the 15-day period is being considered as a month, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the rate is applied differently.

Wait, perhaps the annual premium is $1.25 per $100, but the policy is for 15 days, which is 15/365 of a year. So the total premium is (1.25 / 100) * 1500 * (15/365).

Wait, let me compute that. So 1.25 / 100 = 0.0125 per dollar annually. Then, 1500 * 0.0125 = 18.75 per year, which matches what I had before. Then, 18.75 * (15/365) = 0.77.

Hmm, same result again. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the premium is calculated monthly, not daily. Let me think.

Wait, 15 days is approximately half a month. So if the annual rate is $1.25 per $100, then the monthly rate would be 1.25 / 12 ≈ 0.1042 per $100 per month. So for 15 days, which is half a month, it would be 0.1042 / 2 ≈ 0.0521 per $100.

Then for $1,500 (15 * $100), it would be 15 * 0.0521 ≈ 0.7815, so around $0.78. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different way to calculate. Maybe it's 15 days as 1/24 of a year, but that's similar to what I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for 15 days as a fraction of a 360-day year, which is sometimes used in finance. Let me try that.

15/360 = 1/24 ≈ 0.0416667. So 18.75 * (1/24) = 18.75 /24 = 0.78125, which is approximately $0.78. Still not matching any options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option G is $0.31, which is about 0.31. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question is asking for 15 days' premium, but the rate is given per $100 annually. So the premium is (1.25/100) * 1500 * (15/365).

Let me compute that exactly:

1.25/100 = 0.0125.

1500 * 0.0125 = 18.75.

18.75 * (15/365) = (18.75 * 15) / 365.

18.75 *15 = 281.25.

281.25 / 365 = let me compute that division.

365 × 0.7 = 255.5.

281.25 - 255.5 = 25.75.

365 × 0.07 = 25.55.

So 0.7 + 0.07 = 0.77, and 25.75 -25.55 = 0.20 left.

0.20 / 365 ≈ 0.000547.

So total is approximately 0.7705, which is about $0.77.

So I'm getting $0.77, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for 15 days as 15/360 of a year, using a 360-day year. Let's try that.

15/360 = 1/24 ≈ 0.0416667.

18.75 * (1/24) = 0.78125, so $0.78.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me double-check the initial steps.

The annual premium rate is $1.25 per $100. So for $1,500, the annual premium is 15 * $1.25 = $18.75.

The policy is for 15 days, which is 15/365 of a year. So the premium is 18.75 * (15/365) = ?

Let me compute 18.75 *15 = 281.25.

281.25 divided by 365. Let me compute that more accurately.

365 × 0.7 = 255.5.

281.25 - 255.5 = 25.75.

365 × 0.07 = 25.55.

So 0.7 + 0.07 = 0.77, and 25.75 -25.55 = 0.20.

0.20 / 365 is about 0.000547, so total is approximately 0.770547, which is $0.7705.

So approximately $0.77.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option G: $0.31, but that's way lower. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the rate is per $100, so maybe it's 1.25 per $100 annually, so for 15 days, the rate per day is 1.25 / 365 per $100.

So for $1,500, which is 15 * $100, the daily premium would be 15 * (1.25 /365) = 18.75 / 365 ≈ 0.0513 per day.

15 days would be 0.0513 *15 = 0.7695, which is $0.77.

Hmm, same result. I'm confused because the options don't include this. Did I misread the question?

Wait, the question says the furniture is valued at $1,500. So the calculation is correct. But maybe the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 15-day policy is considered as a 15-day term, but the premium is calculated as a flat rate regardless of the time period. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the premium per day, but that's not what's being asked here.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I overlooked an option. Let me list them again:

A: $3.75

B: $1.25

C: $15.00

D: $18.75

E: $2.44

F: $6.25

G: $0.31

H: $5.00

I: $12.50

J: $22.50

Wait, none of these are close to $0.77. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe I should compute it as 1.25 per $100 annually, so per day it's 1.25 / 365 per $100. So for $1,500, which is 15 times $100, the daily rate is 15 * (1.25 /365) = 18.75 / 365 ≈ 0.0513 per day.

So 15 days would be 15 * 0.0513 ≈ 0.7695, which is $0.77.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the premium per $100, but no, it's for $1,500. So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different method, like a 30-day month assumption. So 15 days would be 0.5 months. Then, the annual rate is $1.25 per $100, so the monthly rate is 1.25 / 12 ≈ 0.1041667 per $100.

So for 15 days, which is half a month, it would be 0.1041667 / 2 ≈ 0.052083 per $100.

Then, for $1,500 (15 * $100), it's 15 * 0.052083 ≈ 0.78125, which is about $0.78.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider that 15 days is 1/24 of a year, as in 365/15 ≈ 24. So the premium would be 18.75 / 24 ≈ 0.78125, again $0.78.

Hmm, maybe the intended answer is different. Let me try to see if any of the options can be achieved through a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the 15-day period is considered as a fraction of 360 days (as sometimes done in finance). So 15/360 = 1/24. So same as before, 18.75 /24 ≈ 0.78125.

Still same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the rate is $1.25 per $100 for a 15-day policy, but that doesn't make sense because the rate is given annually.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question expects me to compute it as 15 days being 1/24 of a year, and 1.25 per $100 annually. So for $1,500, it's 15 * 1.25 = 18.75 annually. Then, 18.75 /24 = 0.78125. So again $0.78.

But no option matches. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for 15 days as 15/365, but perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me compute 18.75 *15 = 281.25. 281.25 /365 = ?

Let me compute 365 × 0.7 = 255.5, as before. 281.25 - 255.5 = 25.75.

25.75 /365 = 0.070547.

So total is 0.7 +0.070547 ≈
