Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about prime factorization and exponents. Hmm, I remember that when you have a number expressed as a product of primes raised to some powers, and you raise it to another exponent, you multiply the exponents. 

Wait, the problem says that a number x factors as 107 multiplied by 109 to the fifth power. So x is 107^1 * 109^5. Right, because 107 and 109 are primes. So the prime factors of x are 107 and 109, with exponents 1 and 5 respectively.

Now the question is asking for the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of x raised to the 11th power. So x^11.

Alright, let's break it down. When you raise a product to a power, each factor gets raised to that power. So x^11 would be (107^1 * 109^5)^11. 

I think the rule here is that when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So for each part, 107^1 to the 11th power would be 107^(1*11) = 107^11. Similarly, 109^5 to the 11th power would be 109^(5*11) = 109^55. 

So in x^11, the exponent of 109 is 55. Let me check the options. Option A is 55. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me think about what the question is asking again. It's specifically about the exponent of 109 in x^11. Oh, right, because 107 is a different prime, so we only care about 109's exponent. So yes, 5 times 11 is 55. So the answer is A.

To determine the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of \( x^{11} \), start by noting that \( x \) is given as \( 107 \cdot 109^5 \). When \( x \) is raised to the 11th power, the expression becomes:

\[
x^{11} = (107 \cdot 109^5)^{11}.
\]

Using the property of exponents \((a \cdot b)^n = a^n \cdot b^n\), this can be rewritten as:

\[
x^{11} = 107^{11} \cdot (109^5)^{11}.
\]

Next, apply the power of a power property \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\) to simplify \((109^5)^{11}\):

\[
(109^5)^{11} = 109^{5 \cdot 11} = 109^{55}.
\]

Thus, in the prime factorization of \( x^{11} \), the exponent of 109 is 55. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**A: 55**
