Okay, so I've got this question here about how much water passes through a human being over 60 years, based on daily losses. Hmm, let's see. I need to calculate the total water loss per day first and then scale it up to 60 years, right?

The data given per day is: urine is 1.0 liter, sweat 0.6, fecal matter 0.1, and expired air 0.4 liters. Oh wait, so I should add all these up. Let me do that. 1.0 plus 0.6 is 1.6, plus 0.1 makes 1.7, and then plus 0.4 brings it to 2.1 liters per day. So that's 2.1 liters each day.

Now, I need to find out how much that is over 60 years. But wait, I remember that units are important here. The question asks for gallons, and the data is in liters. So I need to convert liters to gallons. How many liters are in a gallon? Oh right, 1 US gallon is about 3.78541 liters. So to convert liters to gallons, I guess I divide by that number.

So first, calculate the daily loss in gallons. 2.1 liters/day divided by 3.78541 liters/gallon. Let me compute that. 2.1 / 3.78541 is approximately 0.555 gallons per day. Hmm, about 0.555 gallons each day.

Next, I need to find out the total over 60 years. So how many days are in 60 years? Well, assuming it's not a leap year consideration, 60 years times 365 days per year. 60 * 365 is 21,900 days. Oh, but wait, that's a nice number. So 60 years = 21,900 days.

Now multiply the daily water loss in gallons by the number of days. So 0.555 gallons/day * 21,900 days. Let me do that multiplication. 0.555 * 21,900... Let's see, 0.5 * 21,900 is 10,950. And 0.055 * 21,900 is 1,204.5. Adding those together gives 10,950 + 1,204.5 = 12,154.5 gallons. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.555 * 21,900. Let me compute it step by step. 21,900 * 0.5 is 10,950. 21,900 * 0.05 is 1,095. 21,900 * 0.005 is 109.5. So adding those: 10,950 + 1,095 is 12,045, plus 109.5 makes 12,154.5 gallons. So approximately 12,154.5 gallons.

Looking at the options, option B is 12,045 gallons. Hmm, but wait, my calculation is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the conversion factor?

Wait, let me double-check the liters to gallons conversion. 1 gallon is about 3.78541 liters, so 1 liter is 1/3.78541 gallons, which is approximately 0.264172 gallons per liter. So 2.1 liters/day * 0.264172 gallons/liter = let's compute that. 2 * 0.264172 is 0.528344. 0.1 * 0.264172 is 0.0264172. Adding them gives 0.5547612 gallons per day. So about 0.55476 gallons per day.

Multiply that by 21,900 days: 0.55476 * 21,900. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.55476 * 20,000 is 11,095.2. 0.55476 * 1,900 is... Let's compute 0.55476 * 2000 = 1,109.52, so 1,900 is 1,109.52 * (1.9/2) = wait no, perhaps better to do 1,900 * 0.55476.

Wait, 1,900 * 0.5 is 950. 1,900 * 0.05 is 95. 1,900 * 0.00476 is approximately 1,900 * 0.004 = 7.6, and 1,900 * 0.00076= approx 1.444. So 7.6 +1.444 is about 9.044. Adding all parts: 950 +95 is 1045, plus 9.044 is 1054.044. So total is 11,095.2 + 1,054.044 = 12,149.244 gallons. That's around 12,149 gallons.

But looking at the options, the closest one is B:12,045. Hmm, but why the discrepancy? Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, maybe I should compute 2.1 liters per day to gallons more accurately. 2.1 liters * (1 gallon / 3.78541 liters) = 2.1 / 3.78541. Let me compute that exactly. 3.78541 * 0.555 is about 2.1 (since 3.78541 * 0.5 is 1.8927, 3.78541*0.05=0.18927, 3.78541*0.005=0.018927; adding 1.8927 +0.18927=2.08197 +0.018927=2.100897). So 0.555 gallons is exactly 2.1 liters. So per day, 0.555 gallons.

So 0.555 * 21,900 = let's compute 21,900 * 0.5 is 10,950, 21,900 * 0.05 is 1,095, 21,900 * 0.005 is 109.5. So 10,950 + 1,095 = 12,045 +109.5 =12,154.5 gallons. So approximately 12,154.5 gallons. But the option B is exactly 12,045. So why the difference?

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would give 12,154.5, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, the question says, how many gallons of water pass through a human, assuming these data hold for 60 years. Oh wait, but the data is per day. So the total loss is 2.1 liters per day, which is 0.555 gallons per day.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total liters first, then convert to gallons. So 2.1 liters/day * 21,900 days = 2.1 *21,900 = 45,  45, let me compute that. 2 * 21,900 is 43,800. 0.1 * 21,900 is 2,190. So 43,800 + 2,190 = 45,990 liters.

Now, convert 45,990 liters to gallons. 1 gallon is 3.78541 liters, so 45,990 liters / 3.78541 liters/gallon = ?

Let me compute that. Let's see, 3.78541 is approximately 3.7854. So 45,990 / 3.7854 = ?

Let me compute 45,990 divided by 3.7854.

I can approximate this. Let's see: 3.7854 * 12,000 = 45,424.8. Because 3.7854 * 10,000 = 37,854. 3.7854 * 2,000=7,570.8. So 37,854 +7,570.8=45,424.8.

So 3.7854 *12,000=45,424.8 liters. But we have 45,990 liters, which is 45,990 -45,424.8=565.2 liters more.

So 565.2 liters is how many gallons? 565.2 /3.7854 ≈ 149.3 gallons. So total is 12,000 + 149.3 =12,149.3 gallons. So approximately 12,149 gallons.

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options exactly. The closest option is B:12,045. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the number of days. Let me double-check. 60 years times 365 days per year is 60*365=21,900 days. That's correct.

So per day, 2.1 liters is 2.1/3.78541=0.55476 gallons. Multiply by 21,900 days: 0.55476 *21,900. Let me compute this accurately.

21,900 *0.5=10,950.

21,900 *0.05=1,095.

21,900 *0.00476= let me compute 21,900 *0.004 is 87.6, 21,900 *0.00076 is approx 16.644. So 87.6+16.644=104.244.

So adding all together:10,950 +1,095=12,045 +104.244≈12,149.244 gallons.

So the total is approximately 12,149.24 gallons. But the options don't have this exact number. The closest is option B:12,045, but that's 104 less. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the question assumes 60 years but with a different number of days? Like, perhaps it's 365.25 to account for leap years. Let's see. 60 years would have 60/4=15 leap days. So 60*365=21,900 +15=21,915 days.

Let me recalculate with 21,915 days. 0.55476 *21,915.

0.5 *21,915=10,957.5.

0.05 *21,915=1,095.75.

0.00476 *21,915≈21,915 *0.004=87.66, 0.00076 *21,915=16.676. So 87.66+16.676=104.336.

So total is 10,957.5 +1,095.75 =12,053.25 +104.336≈12,157.586. So about 12,157.59 gallons. Still not matching any of the options.

Wait, let me check the given options again. The options are:

A:2.10 gal

B:12,045 gal

C:5.48e4

D:21,900

E:4.60e4

F:8.25e3

G:1.089e4

H:6.12e3

I:9.67e4

J:3.65e5

Hmm, so option B is 12,045, which is close to my 12,149 but a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps the initial sum was wrong.

Wait, the daily total was 2.1 liters? Let me recheck: 1.0 (urine) +0.6 (sweat) =1.6, +0.1 (fecal)=1.7, +0.4 (expired air)=2.1. Yes, correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is asking for total water passed through, which includes not just loss but also intake? Wait, no, the question says per day, the average loss, so it's the amount lost. So the total is based on those losses.

Alternatively, perhaps the conversion factor is taken as exactly 3.785 liters per gallon. Let me try with 3.785 instead of 3.78541.

So 2.1 liters/day * 21,900 days =45,990 liters. Then 45,990 /3.785 = ?

3.785 *12,000=45,420. So 45,990-45,420=570 liters left.

570 /3.785≈150.5 gallons.

So total is 12,000 +150.5=12,150.5. So same as before, around 12,150 gallons.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach is to compute 2.1 liters/day *365*60 days, then convert to gallons.

Wait, let's try that.

2.1 *21,900 =45,990 liters.

Now, 45,990 liters in gallons: 45,990 /3.78541 ≈12,154.5 gallons.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. So perhaps the intended answer is B:12,045, but why?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only 365 days per year, but without considering leap years, which is acceptable as an approximation. Wait, that would be 365 *60=21,900 days, which is what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation was intended to be 2.1 * (365 *60) =2.1 *21,900=45,990 liters. Then, 45,990 / 3.785 ≈12,154 gallons, which isn't an option. Hmm, but the closest option is B:12,045, which is 109.5 less than 12,154.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial daily calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 0.55476 *21,900. Let me do it more accurately.

0.55476 *21,900.

Let me break 21,900 into 20,000 +1,900.

20,000 *0.55476=11,095.2.

1,900 *0.55476 = Let me compute 1,900 *0.5=950; 1,900 *0.05=95; 1,900 *0.00476= 9.044.

So 950 +95=1,045 +9.044=1,054.044.

So total is 11,095.2 + 1,054.044=12,149.244 gallons.

So approximately 12,149.24 gallons. But again, none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I need to reevaluate the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to approximate the calculation. For example, 2.1 liters/day is roughly 2 liters. 2 liters/day is 2/3.785 ≈0.528 gallons. 0.528 *21,900= 0.528 *20,000=10,560 +0.528*1,900=1,003.2, which totals 11,563.2. But that's still not matching any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to sum the daily loss in liters, multiply by 60 years in days, then convert to gallons. Let's try that approach.

Wait, 2.1 liters/day * 60 years * 365 days/year = 2.1 *60*365 = 2.1 *21,900 =45,990 liters.

Then, 45,990 liters to gallons: 45,990 /3.78541≈12,154 gallons. So none of the options match exactly, but perhaps the intended answer is option B:12,045, but that's 109 less than the calculated value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different conversion factor, like 1 gallon =4 liters. Wait, no, that's not correct. 1 gallon is about 3.785 liters.

Wait, perhaps the question uses 1 gallon= 3.8 liters for simplicity. Let's try that.

45,990 liters /3.8 liters/gallon = 12,100.526 gallons. Still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the options again. Option B is 12,045, which is exactly 21,900 days multiplied by 0.555 gallons/day would give 12,154.5, but perhaps the initial sum was 2.1 * 21,900 =45,990 liters. 45,990 divided by 3.78541 is approximately 12,154.5, but perhaps the intended calculation was 2.1 * (60 *365) =45,990 liters. Then, 45,990 /3.785= approx 12,154. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial daily water loss. Wait, the given data is 1.0 (urine), 0.6 (sweat), 0.1 (feces), 0.4 (expired air). So sum is 2.1 liters per day. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the amount of water, not the total volume. Wait, no, the question says how many gallons of water pass through, so it's the total loss, which would be the same as the amount passing through.

I'm a bit stuck here because my calculation doesn't exactly match any option. But the closest is option B:12,045. Alternatively, perhaps the intended approach was to compute 2.1 liters/day * 60 years *365 days/year, but in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the sum to be 2.1 liters/day, and then the total is 2.1 *60*365=45,990 liters. Then, converting to gallons, 45,990 /3.78541≈12,154.5. But again, none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is 12,045. Let me see if 45,990 liters divided by exactly 3.841 gives 12,045. Let me check: 3.841 *12,045= ?

3.841 *12,000=46,092. 3.841 *45=172.845. So 46,092 +172.845=46,264.845 liters. But we have 45,990 liters, so no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is using a different approximation for liters to gallons.

Wait, maybe the question uses 1 gallon=3.8 liters exactly. So 45,990 liters /3.8 liters/gallon= 12,100.526 gallons. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that 2.1 liters/day is approximately 0.55 gallons/day. So 0.55 *21,900=12,045 gallons. Oh! Wait, that would be option B.

Wait, 0.55 *21,900=0.55 *21,900= (0.5 *21,900)+(0.05 *21,900) = 10
