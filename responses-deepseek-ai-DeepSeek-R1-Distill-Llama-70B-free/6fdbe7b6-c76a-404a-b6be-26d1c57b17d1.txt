Question:

One evening, a defendant set fire to a homeowner's occupied house. As a result of the blaze, the homeowner's daughter was killed. The defendant was charged with felony murder on the first count and arson on the second count of the two-count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count, but returned a not guilty verdict on the second. The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the defendant's right to a fair trial was violated by the inconsistent verdicts.
B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned.
C: denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.
D: denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.
E: granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.
F: granted, because the verdicts contradict each other, raising reasonable doubt.
G: granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.
H: denied, because the jury found sufficient evidence to convict on the first count, regardless of the second count outcome.
I: granted, because the defendant was not directly responsible for the death.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with felony murder and arson charges. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a defendant who set fire to an occupied house, and as a result, the homeowner's daughter died. The defendant is charged with two counts: felony murder (first count) and arson (second count). The jury found him guilty on the first count but not guilty on the second. Now, his attorney is moving to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge.

I remember that felony murder is a doctrine that holds that if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, the person committing the felony can be held liable for murder, even if the killing wasn't intentional. So in this case, the underlying felony would be arson. But here, the jury acquitted the defendant on the arson charge. That seems contradictory because if there's no arson, can there be felony murder based on it?

Wait, but I think the key point is whether the jury's verdicts can be inconsistent. I've heard that in some cases, juries can return verdicts that seem inconsistent, but courts generally don't overturn them unless there's a specific reason. Like, if the two counts are not mutually exclusive or if one isn't a lesser included offense of the other.

So if the defendant was found not guilty of arson, does that mean the felony murder charge can't stand? Because the underlying felony is arson. If he's acquitted of arson, he can't be guilty of felony murder based on that. But wait, maybe there's another underlying felony? No, in this case, the only other charge is arson, so that's the basis.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, felony murder can be based on different underlying felonies. But here, the two counts are specifically felony murder and arson. So if he's acquitted of arson, then the basis for felony murder is gone. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the jury can convict on felony murder without convicting on the underlying felony.

I think in some cases, the jury might find a defendant guilty of felony murder without specifically convicting them of the underlying felony in a separate count, especially if the underlying felony is not charged. But in this case, the underlying felony (arson) was a separate count, and the defendant was acquitted of that. So that's a problem.

Wait, but some sources say that if the underlying felony is acquitted, the felony murder conviction can't stand. Because you can't have felony murder without the underlying felony. So in that case, the guilty verdict on the first count would have to be set aside.

But then I'm also remembering something about the jury's verdicts being inconsistent, but courts generally don't disturb them. Like, the idea that if a jury could have found the defendant guilty of one charge but not another, even if it seems inconsistent, the court doesn't second-guess the jury's decision unless there's a legal reason to do so.

Wait, let me think. In the case where a defendant is charged with both robbery and felony murder based on that robbery, if the jury acquits on robbery but convicts on felony murder, that's inconsistent. Because if there was no robbery, there can't be felony murder based on robbery. So in that situation, the felony murder conviction would likely be overturned.

But I'm not sure about the specifics here. The question is about whether the attorney's motion to set aside the verdict would be granted. The options suggest different reasons.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Granted because inconsistent verdicts violated fair trial. I'm not sure about the fair trial part. Inconsistent verdicts don't necessarily violate due process, but they might lead to the conviction being overturned if it's based on an impossible legal scenario.

Option B: Denied because jury's decision is final. I don't think that's right because if there's a legal impossibility, the court can overturn it.

Option C: Denied, proper remedy is appellate review for non-constitutional error. So maybe the trial court won't set it aside, but the appellate court might. But I'm not sure if this is a non-constitutional error or a fundamental one.

Option D: Denied, verdicts don't amount to reversible error. Maybe, but if the felony murder can't stand without the underlying felony, then it's a reversible error.

Option E: Granted because plain error affecting constitutional rights. Plain error usually applies when the error is so obvious that it affects substantial rights, but I'm not sure if this is a constitutional issue.

Option F: Granted because verdicts contradict, raising reasonable doubt. I'm not sure about this one. It's more about the legal inconsistency than raising doubt.

Option G: Granted because verdicts are legally inconsistent, leading to acquittal on both. Hmm, but the first count was guilty, so maybe only the first is overturned.

Option H: Denied because sufficient evidence on first count regardless of second. But if the first count relies on the second being true, then this might not hold.

Option I: Granted because defendant not responsible for death. That doesn't seem right because felony murder doesn't require intent to kill, just the commission of the felony leading to death.

So, I'm trying to piece this together. If the defendant was found not guilty of arson, then the underlying felony for the felony murder charge is gone. So the felony murder conviction can't stand because it's based on a non-existent felony. Therefore, the verdict on the first count should be set aside.

But wait, another angle: in some jurisdictions, a defendant can be convicted of felony murder even if the underlying felony is not charged or is acquitted. But I think that's when the underlying felony is not part of the charges. For example, if the defendant is charged with murder, and the underlying felony is burglary, but burglary isn't charged. Then, the jury could convict on felony murder without the burglary charge. But in this case, the underlying felony is charged as a separate count, and the defendant was acquitted of it. So that's different.

In that case, the felony murder conviction would be invalid because the necessary element (commission of the underlying felony) wasn't proven beyond a reasonable doubt. So the guilty verdict on the first count would be set aside.

So looking back at the options, which one fits this reasoning. Option G says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal on both charges. But wait, if the defendant is acquitted on the second, but convicted on the first, but the first can't stand without the second, then the first must be overturned. So option G might not be correct because it's not about both charges, but only the first being invalid.

Alternatively, option A says the verdicts are inconsistent, violating the right to a fair trial. But I'm not sure if that's the correct legal basis. The more accurate reason is that the felony murder conviction cannot stand without the underlying felony being proven.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the verdicts are inconsistent, but the court can't overturn them unless there's a legal reason. However, in this scenario, the legal reason is that the felony murder requires the underlying felony.

So the motion to set aside would be granted because the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge can't stand without the defendant being convicted of the underlying felony of arson.

Looking at the options again, maybe option E or option G.

Option E: granted because it's plain error affecting constitutional rights. But I'm not sure if it's a constitutional issue or a statutory one.

Option G: granted because verdicts are legally inconsistent, leading to acquittal on both charges.

Wait, but the question is about the first count being set aside. So the correct reasoning is that the guilty verdict on the first count cannot stand because the underlying felony wasn't proven. So the verdicts are legally inconsistent in a way that undermines the conviction.

Alternatively, some courts have held that a conviction for felony murder cannot stand when the defendant is acquitted of the underlying felony. So that would make the guilty verdict invalid, and the motion would be granted.

So looking at the options, which one aligns with this.

Option G says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to acquittal on both charges. So that's possible, but the question is about the first count only.

Wait, the question states that the defendant was found guilty on the first count (felony murder) and not guilty on the second (arson). The motion is to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count. So if the court grants the motion, the first count's guilty verdict is set aside.

So in that case, the answer would be that the motion is granted because the two counts are inconsistent in a way that the first can't stand without the second.

Looking again, option G says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to acquittal on both charges. But that's not necessary; the first count should be set aside, but the second is already acquitted.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is about inconsistent verdicts violating fair trial. But I think the more precise reason is that the felony murder can't stand without the underlying felony.

Wait, but in the case of State v. Jones, or similar cases, courts have held that if a defendant is acquitted of the underlying felony, the felony murder conviction must be reversed. So that would mean the motion would be granted.

Looking at the options, the closest would be option G, but it says both counts are acquitted, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, option E says it's plain error affecting constitutional rights. But I'm not sure about the constitutional aspect here.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G. Because the two verdicts are legally inconsistent. If the defendant didn't commit arson, he couldn't have committed felony murder based on arson. So the guilty verdict on the first count is invalid.

So option G says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal on both charges. But wait, the second count is already an acquittal. So perhaps the first count must also be acquitted because the underlying felony wasn't proven.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the court will set aside the guilty verdict in this situation.

I think the correct answer is option G: granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.

Wait, but the second count is already not guilty. So the first count must be set aside because it can't stand without the second. So the motion would be granted, and the first count's guilty verdict would be set aside.

So looking at the options, option G is about both charges, but perhaps the correct reasoning is that the guilty verdict on the first count is invalid, so the motion is granted.

Alternatively, option E might be about plain error, but I think the better fit is option G because it's about legal inconsistency.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Some sources say that inconsistent verdicts are generally allowed, but when the inconsistency is a legal one, the court can act. So perhaps the motion is granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent, making option G correct.

Alternatively, the answer could be option H, which says the court found sufficient evidence on the first count regardless of the second. But if the first count requires proof of the second, then that's not possible.

So I'm leaning towards option G being the correct answer.

The question revolves around a defendant charged with felony murder (first count) and arson (second count). The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count but not guilty on the second. The issue is whether the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge can stand, given the acquittal on the underlying felony of arson.

Felony murder is a doctrine that holds a defendant liable for murder if a death occurs during the commission of a felony. In this case, the underlying felony is arson. If the defendant is acquitted of arson, the basis for the felony murder conviction is undermined because the underlying felony is no longer valid. Courts generally hold that a felony murder conviction cannot stand if the defendant is acquitted of the underlying felony, as the two charges are inextricably linked.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While the verdicts appear inconsistent, inconsistent verdicts do not necessarily violate the right to a fair trial unless there is a legal or constitutional basis to overturn them.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The jury's decision is not final if it results in a legally invalid outcome, such as convicting on felony murder without proving the underlying felony.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This is not a matter of appellate review for non-constitutional error; the issue is a fundamental legal inconsistency that can be addressed at the trial level.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The verdicts do amount to reversible error because the felony murder conviction cannot stand without the underlying felony being proven.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While the error may be plain, it is not necessarily a constitutional issue but rather a statutory or legal one.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The issue is not about raising reasonable doubt but about legal inconsistency.
- **Option G**: Correct. The verdicts are legally inconsistent because felony murder requires the underlying felony to be proven. Without a conviction for arson, the felony murder conviction cannot stand, and the guilty verdict on the first count must be set aside.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. There cannot be sufficient evidence to convict on the first count if the underlying felony is not proven.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The defendant's responsibility for the death is not the issue; the issue is the legal basis for the felony murder charge.

The correct reasoning is that the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge cannot stand without the defendant being convicted of the underlying felony of arson. The verdicts are legally inconsistent, and the motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count will most likely be granted.
