Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here that I need to simplify. The expression is (k-3)/2 + 3k + 1 + (3k + 1)/2. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I should probably look for like terms to combine. The expression has a couple of fractions and some whole terms. Let me write it out again to visualize better: (k-3)/2 + 3k + 1 + (3k +1)/2.

Wait, I notice that the fractions have the same denominator, which is 2. That should make things easier. Maybe I can combine those first. So the first term is (k-3)/2 and the last term is (3k+1)/2. If I add those together, since they have the same denominator, I can just add the numerators. Let me do that:

(k-3) + (3k +1) all over 2. Let's compute the numerator: k-3 +3k +1. Combining like terms, k + 3k is 4k, and -3 +1 is -2. So the combined fraction is (4k - 2)/2. Hmm, can I simplify that further? Yeah, I can split it into 4k/2 and -2/2, which is 2k -1. Okay, so the two fractions together simplify to 2k -1.

Now, let's look at the rest of the expression. The middle terms are 3k +1. So putting it all together, the expression now is 2k -1 + 3k +1. Let me combine like terms here. 2k +3k is 5k, and -1 +1 is 0. So those cancel each other out.

Wait, so after combining everything, the entire expression simplifies to 5k. Oh, but wait, let me double-check. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with (k-3)/2 + (3k+1)/2: adding those gives [(k-3)+(3k+1)]/2 = (4k -2)/2 = 2k -1. Then adding the remaining 3k +1: 2k -1 +3k +1. 2k +3k is 5k, and -1 +1 is 0. So yes, it's 5k.

Looking back at the options, option E is 5k. So that's the answer. But wait, let me check the options again to be sure. Option E is 5k, yes.

I think that's correct. No mistakes noticed this time. So the simplified form is 5k.

To simplify the expression \(\frac{k-3}{2} + 3k + 1 + \frac{3k+1}{2}\), we start by combining the fractions with the same denominator:

\[
\frac{k-3}{2} + \frac{3k+1}{2} = \frac{(k-3) + (3k+1)}{2} = \frac{4k - 2}{2} = 2k - 1.
\]

Next, we add the remaining terms \(3k + 1\):

\[
2k - 1 + 3k + 1 = (2k + 3k) + (-1 + 1) = 5k + 0 = 5k.
\]

Thus, the simplified expression is \(5k\).

The correct answer is **E: 5k**.
