Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the interest rate for an installment plan. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the desk is valued at $125. The installment plan requires a down payment of $16.25 and then 16 monthly payments of $7.50 each. I need to find the interest rate involved.

Wait, I remember that when calculating interest rates for installment plans, it's often related to the concept of the time value of money. Oh right, this seems like an annuity problem where the present value of the payments equals the cash price.

So, the initial down payment is $16.25. Then, there are 16 monthly payments of $7.50 each. I think the total amount paid in installments is the down payment plus all the monthly payments. Let me calculate that.

Total payments = down payment + (number of payments * monthly payment)
= 16.25 + (16 * 7.50)
16 times 7.50 is... let's see, 7.5 times 16. 7 times 16 is 112, 0.5 times 16 is 8, so total is 120. So total payments are 16.25 + 120 = 136.25.

But the cash price is $125, so the extra $11.25 must be the interest. But wait, interest rate calculation isn't just about dividing by the principal. It's more about the rate that makes the present value of all payments equal to the principal.

Oh right, I think the formula involves the present value of an ordinary annuity. The present value (PV) would be the amount financed, which is the cash price minus the down payment. So the amount financed is 125 - 16.25 = 108.75.

So the present value of the annuity is 108.75, and each payment (PMT) is 7.50, for n=16 periods, and we're solving for the interest rate i.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + i)^-n] / i

Plugging in the numbers:

108.75 = 7.50 * [1 - (1 + i)^-16] / i

Hmm, solving for i here. This isn't a straightforward algebraic solution because i is in the denominator and also in an exponent. I think I'll have to use trial and error or an iterative method to find i.

Let me rearrange the equation a bit:

[1 - (1 + i)^-16] / i = 108.75 / 7.50
108.75 /7.50 = 14.5

So,

[1 - (1 + i)^-16] / i = 14.5

This equation is a bit tricky. I might try plugging in the answer choices to see which one comes close to 14.5.

Let me consider each option. Let me start with option I: 18.5%. Let's compute the left side:

i = 0.185 (18.5% per year, but since payments are monthly, I think the rate per period is 0.185 /12 ≈ 0.0154167.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the payments are monthly, the rate we're finding is the monthly rate, right? Or is it the annual rate? Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. The problem says to calculate the interest rate involved. Typically, installment loans quote an annual rate, but the payments are monthly. So perhaps I need to find the effective annual rate or the nominal annual rate.

Wait, but the formula uses the periodic interest rate. So if the payments are monthly, the rate would be per month. So perhaps the options are giving the annual rate, so I would have to convert it to a monthly rate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The present value of the annuity formula uses the periodic interest rate. Since the payments are monthly, the rate would be a monthly rate. So if I'm trying to find the annual rate, I'll have to calculate the effective rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are the effective annual rates. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the annual percentage rate (APR), which is the nominal rate. Or maybe the effective annual rate.

I think in installment loans, the APR is based on the periodic rates. So let's proceed.

So, for each option, I'll convert the annual rate to a monthly rate (i = annual rate /12), and then compute [1 - (1 + i)^-16] / i and see if it equals approximately 14.5.

Let me start with option I: 18.5% annual rate.

i = 0.185 /12 ≈ 0.0154167

Compute 1/(1+i)^16: (1.0154167)^16.

Wait, let's compute (1.0154167)^16:

I can compute this step by step.

1.0154167^1 = 1.0154167

^2 ≈ 1.030881

^4: Let's square that: approx (1.030881)^2 ≈ 1.0621

^8: square again: approx (1.0621)^2 ≈ 1.1277

^16: square again: approx (1.1277)^2 ≈ 1.2718

So 1/(1.0154167)^16 ≈ 1/1.2718 ≈ 0.7865

So 1 - 0.7865 = 0.2135

Then, 0.2135 / i (which is 0.0154167) = 0.2135 / 0.0154167 ≈ 13.85

We're looking for 14.5, so 13.85 is a bit lower. So this suggests that 18.5% might be a bit high. Because when i is higher, the denominator is bigger, so the value of [1 - (1+i)^-n]/i would be lower.

Wait, because when i is higher, the present value factor is smaller, right? So for a higher i, the term [1 - (1+i)^-n]/i would be smaller than for a lower i. So since our target is 14.5, and at 18.5% the value is 13.85, which is lower than 14.5, perhaps we need a lower i.

Wait, no, wait: If i is lower, then [1 - (1+i)^-16]/i would be higher, because the denominator is smaller and the numerator is bigger. Wait, let me think.

Wait, when i is smaller, (1+i)^-16 is larger. So 1 - (1+i)^-16 is smaller. Wait, no, wait: (1+i)^16 is larger when i is larger. So (1+i)^-16 is smaller when i is larger. So 1 - (1+i)^-16 would be larger when i is larger. Hmm, perhaps I should make a table.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try another option.

Let me try option C: 19.9% annual rate.

i=0.199/12 ≈ 0.0165833.

Calculate (1.0165833)^16.

Let me compute:

1.0165833^2 ≈ 1.0333.

^4: (1.0333)^2 ≈ 1.0673.

^8: (1.0673)^2 ≈ 1.1385.

^16: (1.1385)^2 ≈ 1.2965.

So 1/(1.0165833)^16 ≈ 1/1.2965 ≈ 0.7718.

1 - 0.7718 = 0.2282.

0.2282 / 0.0165833 ≈ 13.77.

Still lower than 14.5. Hmm. So the value is getting lower as the rate increases. So perhaps I need a lower rate.

Wait, but earlier at 18.5%, it was 13.85. At 19.9%, it's 13.77. So lower rates would give higher values.

Wait, let's try a lower rate. Let's try option G: 15.2% annual.

i=0.152/12 ≈ 0.0126667.

Compute (1.0126667)^16.

Calculating step by step:

1.0126667^2 ≈ 1.0255.

^4: (1.0255)^2 ≈ 1.0515.

^8: (1.0515)^2 ≈ 1.1062.

^16: (1.1062)^2 ≈ 1.2225.

So 1/(1.0126667)^16 ≈ 1/1.2225 ≈ 0.8182.

Then 1 - 0.8182 = 0.1818.

Divide by i: 0.1818 / 0.0126667 ≈ 14.36.

That's getting closer to 14.5. Hmm, 14.36 is pretty close. Let's see what the exact value is.

Wait, maybe for more precision, I should compute (1.0126667)^16 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps compute it using logarithms or a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps use another method. Alternatively, maybe try another option.

Let me try option I: 18.5% was giving us around 13.85, which is lower than 14.5.

Option G: 15.2% is giving 14.36.

Hmm, so maybe a rate a little lower than 15.2% would give us 14.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are given, so perhaps option G is the closest, but wait, perhaps another option is better.

Wait, let's check option A: 16.3% annual.

i=0.163/12 ≈ 0.0135833.

Compute (1.0135833)^16.

Approximating:

1.0135833^2 ≈ 1.0273.

^4: (1.0273)^2 ≈ 1.0555.

^8: (1.0555)^2 ≈ 1.1137.

^16: (1.1137)^2 ≈ 1.2395.

So 1/(1.0135833)^16 ≈ 1/1.2395 ≈ 0.8068.

1 - 0.8068 = 0.1932.

Divide by i: 0.1932 / 0.0135833 ≈ 14.23.

Hmm, that's 14.23, which is still a bit below 14.5.

Wait, what about option B: 17.8% annual.

i=0.178/12 ≈ 0.0148333.

Compute (1.0148333)^16.

Calculate:

1.0148333^2 ≈ 1.0299.

^4: (1.0299)^2 ≈ 1.0608.

^8: (1.0608)^2 ≈ 1.1250.

^16: (1.125)^2 = 1.2656.

So 1/(1.0148333)^16 ≈ 1/1.2656 ≈ 0.7906.

1 - 0.7906 = 0.2094.

Divide by i: 0.2094 / 0.0148333 ≈ 14.11.

Still lower than 14.5.

Wait, maybe I need a lower rate than 15.2%? But the closest option is G at 15.2% giving 14.36, which is just below 14.5.

Wait, let's try option E: 11.7% annual.

i=0.117/12 ≈ 0.00975.

Compute (1.00975)^16.

Hmm, let's compute:

1.00975^2 ≈ 1.0196.

^4: 1.0196^2 ≈ 1.0395.

^8: 1.0395^2 ≈ 1.0808.

^16: 1.0808^2 ≈ 1.1683.

So 1/(1.00975)^16 ≈ 0.847.

1 - 0.847 = 0.153.

Divide by i: 0.153 / 0.00975 ≈ 15.69.

That's higher than 14.5, so perhaps the correct rate is between 11.7% and 15.2%. Wait, but wait, the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the interest is calculated differently. Wait, perhaps this is a simple interest calculation?

Wait, let me think again. The total amount paid is 16.25 + (16 *7.50) = 16.25 + 120 = 136.25. The cash price is 125, so the total interest is 136.25-125=11.25.

But that's the total interest over the period. Now, to find the interest rate, perhaps using simple interest: Interest = P * r * t.

Here, P is 125, perhaps. Wait, but that may not be correct because with installments, each payment reduces the principal. So maybe it's not simple interest.

Wait, perhaps using the average outstanding balance. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the rate can be calculated using the formula for flat interest rate.

Wait, the formula for total interest when payments are made is:

Interest = (Total Payments) - (Cash Price)

Which is 11.25, as above.

But to find the interest rate, perhaps using the average balance method.

The average balance is (initial principal + final principal)/2. But since all the payments are made, the final principal is zero. So average balance is (125 + 0)/2 = 62.5.

Then, Interest = 11.25.

Total time is 16 months. So the rate would be (11.25)/(62.5 * (16/12)).

Wait, let me compute that.

11.25 / (62.5 * (16/12)).

First, 16/12 is 1.3333.

62.5 * 1.3333 ≈ 83.333.

So 11.25 / 83.333 ≈ 0.135, or 13.5%.

Looking at the options, F is 13.5%. But wait, this approach might not be the correct method because it's an approximation.

Wait, but I'm getting 13.5% with this method. The previous method using present value gave me a number close to 15%, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rule of 78 or another method, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the present value of the annuity formula, which is what I did earlier. So from that, the closest option was G (15.2%), but let me try another option.

Wait, let me try option J: 12.4% annual.

i=0.124/12 ≈ 0.010333.

Compute (1.010333)^16.

1.010333^2 ≈ 1.0208.

^4: 1.0208^2 ≈ 1.0423.

^8: 1.0423^2 ≈ 1.0863.

^16: 1.0863^2 ≈ 1.1793.

So 1/(1.010333)^16 ≈ 0.843.

1 - 0.843 = 0.157.

Divide by i: 0.157 / 0.010333 ≈ 15.19.

Hmm, that's higher than our target of 14.5.

Wait, so when i is 12.4%, the factor is 15.19, which is higher than 14.5.

Wait, but earlier, with i=15.2% (option G), the factor was 14.36, which is lower than 14.5.

So, the correct rate would be between 12.4% and 15.2%, but looking at the options, perhaps the closest is option G:15.2% giving 14.36.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculations. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the iterative method to find a more precise rate.

Let me set up the equation again:

108.75 = 7.50 * [1 - (1 + i)^-16 ] / i

Divide both sides by 7.50:

14.5 = [1 - (1 + i)^-16 ] / i

I need to find i such that [1 - (1+i)^-16 ] / i =14.5.

Let me try i=0.012 (1.2% monthly, which is 14.4% annually).

Compute (1.012)^-16.

1.012^16: Let me compute step by step.

1.012^2=1.024144.

^4=(1.024144)^2≈1.0486.

^8=(1.0486)^2≈1.0998.

^16=(1.0998)^2≈1.2096.

So (1.012)^-16≈1/1.2096≈0.827.

So 1 - 0.827=0.173.

0.173 /0.012 ≈14.4167.

Hmm, that's very close to 14.5. So, with a monthly rate of 1.2%, the factor is approximately 14.4167, which is very close to 14.5.

So the effective monthly rate is around 1.2%. So the annual rate would be 1.2% *12=14.4%.

But looking at the options, option D is 14.6%, which is very close.

Wait, but wait, the calculation at i=0.012 gives 14.4167, which is about 14.4% annual. So the closest option is D:14.6%.

But let me check with i=0.0125 (1.25% monthly, 15% annual).

(1.0125)^16: Let's compute.

1.0125^2=1.025156.

^4=(1.025156)^2≈1.0509.

^8=(1.0509)^2≈1.1049.

^16=(1.1049)^2≈1.2204.

So (1.0125)^-16≈0.8165.

1 - 0.8165=0.1835.

0.1835 /0.0125=14.68.

That's higher than 14.5. So at 1.25% monthly (15% annual), the factor is 14.68.

Wait, but we're seeking 14.5, which is between
