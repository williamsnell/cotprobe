Okay, so I've got this biology question here about meiosis and chromatids. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. The question is about an animal with an adiploid number of 8. Wait, I think adiploid might be a typo. Oh right, it's diploid, meaning two sets of chromosomes. So the diploid number is 8. That means the animal has 2n = 8, so n is 4.

The question has three parts: a, b, and c. Each part asks about the number of chromatids during different stages of meiosis.

Let me start by recalling what happens in each stage of meiosis. Meiosis has two main divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II, each with their own phases.

Part a) is about the tetrad stage. The tetrad stage is in prophase I of meiosis. During prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up, forming a tetrad. Each homologous pair consists of two chromosomes, each with two sister chromatids. So each tetrad has four chromatids. But wait, how many tetrads are there? Since the diploid number is 8, that's 4 pairs, so 4 tetrads. Each tetrad has 4 chromatids. So the total number of chromatids in the tetrad stage would be 4 tetrads * 4 chromatids each? Wait, no, wait. No, each tetrad has two pairs of sister chromatids. Wait, no, each chromosome has two sister chromatids. So each homologous pair (a tetrad) has 4 chromatids in total. So with 4 tetrads, the total number would be 4 tetrads * 4 chromatids each = 16 chromatids. Because each tetrad is four chromatids (two pairs). So part a) is 16.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another approach: each of the 8 chromosomes is duplicated, so each has two chromatids. So total chromatids in the cell at prophase I would be 8 * 2 = 16. Yes, that makes sense. So a) is 16.

Part b) is about late telophase of the first meiotic division. Telophase I happens after anaphase I. In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are separated, so each daughter cell gets one from each pair. So after division, each cell has n chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So in telophase I, the nuclear envelope reforms, and the chromosomes uncoil. Wait, but wait: during telophase, the chromosomes (which are still made of two chromatids each) come together. So each cell has n=4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 8 chromatids per cell? Wait, but the question is about the number in the cell at this stage.

Wait, actually, during telophase I, each cell has n=4 chromosomes, each with two sister chromatids. So total chromatids would be 4 * 2 = 8. So part b) is 8 chromatids.

Wait, but wait another thing. The first meiotic division splits the cell into two. So each new cell has n chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So yes, 4 chromosomes, 8 chromatids in total.

Part c) is metaphase II. Metaphase II is part of the second meiotic division. In metaphase II, the chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate again. Now, each chromosome still has two chromatids because the sister chromatids haven't been separated yet. So in metaphase II, each cell has n=4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So 4 * 2 = 8 chromatids. Wait, but wait. Wait, in meiosis II, each cell is a haploid cell, but each chromosome has two chromatids. So during metaphase II, the number of chromatids per cell is 8. So part c) is 8.

Wait, but let me think again. After meiosis I, each cell has n chromosomes (4 in this case), each with two chromatids. In meiosis II, during prophase II, each chromosome still has two chromatids. So when it's in metaphase II, each cell has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 8 chromatids in total. So that's correct.

Now, looking at the options. Let me recap:

a) 16

b) 8

c) 8

Looking at the options:

Option F: a) 16, b)8, c)8 â†’ that's what I have.

Option F is:

a) 16 chromatids,

b) 8 chromatids,

c) 8 chromatids.

So the correct answer should be option F.

Wait, checking the options, option F is: a)16, b)8, c)8.

Yes, that's what I concluded. So the answer is F.

The question involves determining the number of chromatids during specific stages of meiosis for an organism with a diploid number of 8 (2n = 8, n = 4). Here's the analysis:

1. **Part a: Tetrad stage (Prophase I)**  
   During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair up, forming tetrads. Each homologous pair consists of two chromosomes, and each chromosome has two sister chromatids. Thus, each tetrad contains 4 chromatids. Since there are 4 homologous pairs (n = 4), the total number of chromatids is:  
   \[
   4 \, \text{tetrads} \times 4 \, \text{chromatids per tetrad} = 16 \, \text{chromatids}.
   \]

2. **Part b: Late Telophase I**  
   By late telophase I, homologous chromosomes have been separated, and each daughter cell has n = 4 chromosomes. Each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids. Therefore, the total number of chromatids per cell is:  
   \[
   4 \, \text{chromosomes} \times 2 \, \text{chromatids per chromosome} = 8 \, \text{chromatids}.
   \]

3. **Part c: Metaphase II**  
   In metaphase II, the chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate. Each chromosome still has two sister chromatids, as the chromatids are not separated until anaphase II. Since each cell has n = 4 chromosomes, the total number of chromatids is:  
   \[
   4 \, \text{chromosomes} \times 2 \, \text{chromatids per chromosome} = 8 \, \text{chromatids}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
- a) 16 chromatids  
- b) 8 chromatids  
- c) 8 chromatids  

The correct option is **F**.

F
