Okay, so I have this math problem here: 2,396 minus 1,709. Hmm, I need to subtract these two numbers. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when subtracting larger numbers, it's helpful to break them down digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place. 

Alright, let's write them down one above the other to make it easier. So, 2,396 is on top, and 1,709 is below. Let's align them properly:

```
  2396
- 1709
------
```

Starting from the right, the ones place. 6 minus 9. Wait, 6 is smaller than 9, so I can't subtract 9 from 6 directly. I think I need to borrow from the tens place. The 9 in the tens place of the top number (which is actually 90) will lend 1 to the ones place, making it 16. So now, 16 minus 9 is 7. Got it, the ones place of the answer is 7.

Now moving to the tens place. Originally, the top number's tens digit was 9, but I borrowed 1 for the ones place, so now it's 8. So 8 minus 0 (from 1709's tens place) is 8. So the tens place is 8.

Next is the hundreds place. The top number has 3, and the bottom has 7. Oh wait, 3 is smaller than 7, so I need to borrow from the thousands place. The 2 in the thousands place will become 1, and the 3 becomes 13. So 13 minus 7 is 6. So the hundreds place is 6.

Finally, the thousands place. The top was 2, but I borrowed 1 earlier, so it's now 1. The bottom has 1, so 1 minus 1 is 0. But wait, do I write that 0? I think I can just leave it out since leading zeros aren't written. So the thousands place is 0, but we don't include it in the final answer.

Putting it all together, the result is 687. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Wait, another way to check is by adding 1,709 and the result to see if it equals 2,396. Let's add 1,709 + 687. 

1,709 plus 600 is 2,309. Then add 80: 2,389. Then add 7: 2,396. Yep, that matches the original number. So I think I did it right.

Looking at the options, option C is 687, so that should be the correct answer.

The correct answer is C: 687.
