Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is about the smallest change in a measured variable that an instrument will respond to. The options are from A to J, each representing different terms related to instrumentation.

Hmm, let me think about each term and what it means. I remember that in measurement instruments, there are several key characteristics like accuracy, precision, sensitivity, resolution, etc. Each has a specific meaning.

The question is asking specifically about the smallest change that the instrument can detect. So, I'm trying to recall which term refers to that ability.

Option A: Calibration. I think calibration is the process of adjusting an instrument so that its measurements align with a standard. So it's more about setting the instrument correctly, not about detecting small changes.

Option B: Sensitivity. Sensitivity, if I remember right, refers to how much the output of the instrument changes in response to a change in the input. It's about the responsiveness. But wait, is it about the smallest detectable change or just the ratio of output to input change?

Option C: Resolution. Oh right, resolution is often the term used for the smallest measurement that can be distinguished. Like, a scale might have markings every millimeter, so the resolution is 1mm. That sounds like it's the smallest change the instrument can measure.

Option D: Repeatability. That's about getting the same result when measuring the same thing multiple times under the same conditions. It's more about consistency, not the minimum detectable change.

Option E: Linearity. Linearity refers to how closely the instrument's output follows a straight-line relationship with the input. So it's about the accuracy across a range, not the smallest change.

Option F: Precision. Precision is similar to repeatability; it's how consistent the measurements are. High precision means small scatter in the data, but not necessarily about the smallest detectable change.

Option G: Accuracy. Accuracy is how close the measurement is to the true value. It's about correctness, not sensitivity to changes.

Option H: Scale. The scale refers to the range of measurements the instrument can handle. Like, a thermometer might have a scale from 0 to 100 degrees. Not about the smallest change.

Option I: Range. That's the span of values the instrument can measure, from minimum to maximum. Again, not the smallest increment.

Option J: Reliability. That's about consistency over time, that the instrument gives the same measurements reliably. Not about the smallest detectable change.

Wait, so going back. The question is the smallest change the instrument responds to. So I'm thinking between sensitivity and resolution.

Sensitivity is the ability to detect small changes. But sometimes sensitivity is expressed as the ratio of output change to input change. So, for example, an instrument might have a sensitivity of 10 mV per degree Celsius. So a 1-degree change leads to a 10 mV change. But that's not exactly the minimum detectable change.

Resolution, on the other hand, is the smallest distinguishable change. Like a ruler with mm markings can't measure fractions of a mm. So the resolution is 1 mm.

Wait, but sometimes sensitivity is also used to mean the minimum detectable change. Like, the instrument's sensitivity is the smallest change it can sense. So maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe sensitivity refers to the ability to respond to changes, and resolution is the smallest increment it can display or measure.

Wait, let me think about definitions. 

- Resolution: The smallest difference between two measurements that can be detected. For example, a digital multimeter with a resolution of 0.1 V can measure to the nearest 0.1 V.

- Sensitivity: The ratio of the change in the output to the change in the input. It's a measure of how much the output changes per unit change of input. It's about how responsive the instrument is.

So the question is about the smallest change the instrument can respond to. That sounds more like resolution, because it's the minimum step it can detect. Sensitivity is more about how much the output changes per input change, but not the minimum detectable input.

Wait, but in some contexts, the term sensitivity is used to denote the minimum detectable signal. Like, in analytical chemistry, sensitivity can refer to the minimum concentration that can be detected. So maybe there's some overlap in terminology.

Alternatively, I'm trying to remember if the correct term for the smallest detectable change is 'sensitivity' or 'resolution'.

Wait, another way: think about a balance scale. The sensitivity might be how much the needle moves per gram added. But the resolution would be the smallest weight it can measure, like 0.1 grams. So in that case, the smallest change it can respond to is the resolution.

So putting it together, the correct answer is C: resolution.

The smallest change in a measured variable to which an instrument will respond is referred to as its **resolution**. Resolution is defined as the smallest distinguishable difference between two measurements that the instrument can detect. For example, if a ruler has markings every millimeter, its resolution is 1 mm, meaning it cannot measure fractions of a millimeter. 

Other terms like sensitivity, while related, typically refer to the ratio of output change to input change or the ability to detect changes, but not specifically the smallest detectable change. Repeatability, precision, accuracy, and other terms pertain to consistency, correctness, or reliability but do not directly address the minimum detectable change. Therefore, the correct term for the smallest change an instrument can respond to is **resolution**.
