Okay, so I've got this problem here about camera objectives and f-numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the camera's objective has a 50 mm focal length and is set at an aperture stop of f/4. Then, it's focused on an object 20 cm away. The question is asking for the effective f-number. Wait, effective f-number? I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I think it's related to how the aperture changes when focusing.

Wait, I remember something about the f-number being the ratio of the focal length to the aperture diameter. So normally, f/4 would mean the aperture diameter is focal_length divided by 4. Oh right, so for 50 mm, the aperture diameter would be 50/4=12.5 mm. That's the diameter when the lens is focused at infinity, I think. Because when you focus on closer objects, the lens moves, which might change the effective aperture.

Oh wait, wait. I think when the lens is focused on a nearby object, the effective aperture changes. Something about the magnification affecting the f-number. Oh right! The effective f-number (sometimes called the effective aperture) increases when focusing on closer objects because the lens enlarges, but the aperture's physical size doesn't change. Wait, or does it? Or perhaps it's about the image formation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The f-number is typically defined as the focal length divided by the diameter of the aperture stop. But when the lens forms an image, especially when it's not at infinity, the effective aperture could be different due to the cone of light converging. Oh, right, because the lens moves further from the image plane when focusing on a nearby object, which affects the beam's divergence.

So I think the formula for effective f-number when focused at a finite distance is given by something involving the magnification. The magnification m is the ratio of the image distance (v) to the object distance (u). But wait, the lens formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So here, u is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters, but wait wait, no, focal length is 50 mm, which is 0.05 meters or 5 cm. Oh wait, wait u is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters, no, wait 50 mm is 5 cm, 5 cm focal length. So u is 20 cm, which is larger than f, so it's a finite distance.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up with units. Let me write down what I know:

Focal length f = 50 mm = 5 cm = 0.05 meters.

Aperture stop f-number is 4, so the aperture diameter is f/4 = 50 mm /4 = 12.5 mm.

Now, when the camera is focused at an object distance u = 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, in the metric system, focal length is usually in meters. So 50 mm is 0.05 meters. So u is 0.2 meters.

Using the lens equation: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So 1/v = 1/f - 1/u. Let me compute that.

1/f = 1/0.05 = 20 m^-1.

1/u = 1/0.2 = 5 m^-1.

So 1/v = 20 -5 =15 m^-1. So v = 1/15 ≈ 0.0667 m, which is 6.67 cm. So the image distance is about 6.67 cm.

Now, the magnification m is v/u. Wait, no, I think it's m = v/u. Wait, let me think. Object distance u, image distance v. The magnification m is given by m = v/u. Wait, but wait, sometimes it's negative depending on real or virtual images, but in this case, both are real, so m would be positive because u is positive (object is real) and v is positive (image is real). So m = v/u = (approx 0.0667 m) / 0.2 m = 0.3335. So about 1/3.

Wait, but wait, when I focus on a close object, the lens moves further away from the sensor, so the image distance increases or decreases? Hmm, when the object is closer, the image distance is shorter than when focused at infinity. Wait, no, when focused at infinity, the image distance is equal to the focal length. Because 1/u is zero when u is infinity, so 1/v = 1/f, so v = f. So when u is 20 cm, which is 0.2 m, which is larger than f (0.05 m), so v is 0.0667 m, which is about 6.67 cm, which is longer than f. Wait no, 6.67 cm is 0.0667 m, which is larger than f=0.05 m. So the image is formed further away than f. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you focus on a closer object, the lens moves away from the sensor, so the image distance is longer than f.

Wait, no, wait when u approaches f, v approaches infinity. So if u is larger than f, which it is (0.2 m > 0.05 m), then v is positive and less than f, right? Wait, no, according to the calculation, v is 0.0667 m, which is 6.67 cm, longer than f (5 cm), so that's correct. So when the object is beyond f, the image is closer than f. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused again.

Wait, let me think again. If u approaches infinity, then v approaches f. So when u is larger than f (like 20 cm, which is 0.2 m, much larger than f=0.05 m), then v is a bit larger than f, maybe. Wait, wait in our calculation, 1/v = 20 -5 =15, so v = 1/15 ≈ 0.0667 m, which is 6.67 cm. So that's longer than 5 cm, which is the focal length. So the image is formed 6.67 cm from the lens, which is beyond the focal length. So the lens would have to move a bit further out to focus on the object at 20 cm.

But okay, now the magnification m is v/u. So v is 0.0667 m, u is 0.2 m. So 0.0667 / 0.2 ≈ 0.333. So m is 1/3. So the image is a third the height of the object.

Now, going back to the effective f-number. I think the effective f-number (f_eff) is given by f/(1 + m). Or wait, maybe it's f*(1 + m) because the effective aperture changes with magnification. Let me think. I remember that when the magnification is m, the effective aperture is (f-number) times (1 + m). No, wait, I think it's the effective f-number increases by a factor of (1 + m), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the effective aperture diameter. The physical aperture diameter is D = f / N, where N is the f-number. So D = 50 mm /4 = 12.5 mm. But when the lens forms an image with magnification m, the effective aperture as seen from the image plane might change.

Wait, another approach. The effective f-number can be calculated using the formula: effective f-number = f-number * (1 + m). Because when the image is formed, the light converges, so the beam's divergence changes, effectively changing the f-number. So if m is positive (as it is here, since it's a real image), then the effective f-number increases.

So m is 0.333, so 1 + m = 1.333. So effective f-number would be 4 * 1.333 ≈ 5.333. So that would be around 5.33.

Looking at the options, option E is 5.33.

Wait, but wait another moment. The formula I'm recalling is that the effective f-number when focused at a finite distance is f/(1 + m), but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. Maybe it's the other way around. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective f-number is given by N_eff = N * (1 + m), where m is the magnification. So N is 4, m is 0.333, so 4 * 1.333 is 5.333, which is option E.

But I also remember that sometimes effective f-number is calculated as N * (1 + |m|), but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's N / (1 + m), but that would give a smaller effective f-number, which doesn't make sense, because when you focus closer, the effective aperture should get smaller (so f-number increases), meaning N_eff increases.

Wait, let's think about it. When you focus on a closer object, the lens elements move apart, making the effective aperture larger? Or no, wait, maybe the beam coming into the aperture becomes more convergent. So the physical aperture size is the same, but the effective f-number, which is based on the beam's angle, would change.

Alternatively, another approach. The f-number is defined as the focal length divided by the aperture diameter. But when the image is formed at v, the effective aperture as seen from the image plane would have to account for the angle.

Wait, perhaps the effective f-number is given by (f * (1 + m)) / D, where D is the physical aperture diameter. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, think about the relationship between the f-number and the magnification. When the object is at u, the magnification is m = v/u. The effective f-number is then f/(D_effective), where D_effective is the diameter of the beam as it enters the lens from the object side. Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps another formula. The effective f-number can be calculated as N * (1 + m), where m is the magnification. So for m = 1/3, N_eff = 4 * (4/3) = 16/3 ≈5.333, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N_eff = N / (1 + m). Wait, that would give 4 / (1.333) ≈3, but that's not one of the options here.

Wait, perhaps I should check a reference. Oh wait, I can't, but I'll try to think. Let me consider when the object is at infinity. Then u is infinite, so m approaches zero (since m = v/u, and v approaches f). So N_eff approaches N * (1 + 0) = N, which is correct. So that makes sense. Now, when the object is closer, m is positive, so N_eff increases by (1 + m). So in this case, m is 1/3, so N_eff is 4*(4/3)=5.333.

So the effective f-number would be 5.33, which is option E.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm not entirely sure if the magnification is defined as v/u or u/v. Because sometimes magnification is defined as image height over object height, which would be m = v/u. But wait, when u is larger than f, v is positive but smaller than u, so m is less than 1, which matches our earlier result of m ≈0.333. So yes, m is 1/3.

So N_eff = 4*(1 + 1/3) = 4*(4/3) = 16/3 ≈5.333, which is option E.

So the answer should be E:5.33.

To determine the effective f-number when a camera objective with a 50 mm focal length (set at an aperture stop of f/4) is focused on an object 20 cm away, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Focal Length and Aperture Diameter**:  
   The focal length \( f \) is 50 mm, and the aperture stop is set to f/4. The physical aperture diameter is calculated as:  
   \[
   D = \frac{f}{N} = \frac{50 \, \text{mm}}{4} = 12.5 \, \text{mm}.
   \]  
   This is the aperture diameter when the lens is focused at infinity.

2. **Object and Image Distances**:  
   Using the lens formula:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v},
   \]  
   where \( u = 20 \, \text{cm} = 0.2 \, \text{m} \) (object distance) and \( f = 50 \, \text{mm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \). Substituting:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{0.05} - \frac{1}{0.2} = 20 - 5 = 15 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
   \]  
   Thus, the image distance is:  
   \[
   v = \frac{1}{15} \approx 0.0667 \, \text{m} = 6.67 \, \text{cm}.
   \]

3. **Magnification**:  
   The magnification \( m \) is given by:  
   \[
   m = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{0.0667}{0.2} \approx 0.333.
   \]  
   This means the image height is one-third of the object height.

4. **Effective f-number**:  
   The effective f-number accounts for the change in the apparent aperture size due to the magnification. The formula for the effective f-number is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{eff}} = N \cdot (1 + m),
   \]  
   where \( N \) is the nominal f-number (4 in this case) and \( m \) is the magnification. Substituting \( N = 4 \) and \( m = 0.333 \):  
   \[
   N_{\text{eff}} = 4 \cdot (1 + 0.333) = 4 \cdot 1.333 = 5.333.
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:  
   The effective f-number is approximately \( 5.33 \), which corresponds to option **E**.
