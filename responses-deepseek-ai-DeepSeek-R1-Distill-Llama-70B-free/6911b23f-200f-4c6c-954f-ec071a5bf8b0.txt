Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here where a wholesaler sold some merchandise for $1,288 and that was at an 8% loss from his original cost. I need to find the original cost. Hmm, right, so he sold it for less than he bought it, which means he lost 8% of the original cost.

Wait, so the selling price is equal to the original cost minus 8% of the original cost. So selling price is 92% of the original cost because 100% minus 8% is 92%. Oh right, because if he lost 8%, he's only getting 92% back when he sells it.

So the formula should be something like: Selling Price = Original Cost × (1 - Loss Percentage). Since the loss is 8%, that's 0.08, so 1 - 0.08 is 0.92.

So $1,288 equals the original cost times 0.92. To find the original cost, I'll need to divide both sides by 0.92.

Let me write that out. Original Cost = $1,288 / 0.92. Let me calculate that. Hmm, let's see. 1288 divided by 0.92.

Wait, maybe doing it step by step would help. 0.92 goes into 1288 how many times? Let me calculate:

First, 0.92 times 1000 is 920, which is less than 1288. 0.92 × 1400 would be 1288, because 0.92 × 1000 is 920, 0.92 × 400 is 368, so 920 +368 is 1288. Oh, wait, that seems right. So 1000 + 400 is 1400. So the original cost is $1,400.

Let me double-check. 8% of 1400 is how much? 0.08 × 1400 = 112. So the loss is $112. So the selling price would be 1400 - 112 = 1288, which matches the given amount. So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option C is $1,400.00. So the answer should be C.

The wholesaler sold the merchandise for $1,288, which represents 92% of the original cost after an 8% loss. To find the original cost, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Original Cost} = \frac{\text{Selling Price}}{1 - \text{Loss Percentage}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Original Cost} = \frac{1,288}{0.92} = 1,400
\]

Thus, the original cost of the merchandise is $1,400.00, which corresponds to option C.
