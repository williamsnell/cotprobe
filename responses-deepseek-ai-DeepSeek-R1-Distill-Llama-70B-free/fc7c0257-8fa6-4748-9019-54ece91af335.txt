Question:

A young lawyer worked late at her office one night. When she finally decided to go home, she headed to the elevator, got in, and pushed the button for the ground floor. The elevator went all the way to the ground floor, but then just stopped there. The doors did not open. The lawyer tried pushing each of the buttons in the elevator and tried to use the intercom in the elevator to call for help, but nothing on the elevator's control panel seemed to be functioning. The lawyer was afraid that she would be stuck in the elevator all night. She began pounding on the doors and yelling. She started to feel panicked, hyperventilated, lost consciousness, and fell to the floor of the elevator. As she fell, she struck her head on the elevator wall, causing a large bump and bruise on her head. She was unconscious in the elevator for about 30 minutes before a security guard tried to use the elevator and realized it wasn't working. The guard managed to force the doors open and found the lawyer. At that moment, the lawyer regained consciousness. An investigation revealed that the elevator stopped working because it had not been properly maintained. The owner of the building had canceled all service and maintenance work on the elevator in order to save money. If the lawyer sues the building owner for false imprisonment, she will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because she was confined in the elevator for an unreasonably long period of time.
B: prevail, because she was injured during her confinement in the elevator.
C: not prevail, because the building owner did not intentionally cause the lawyer to be confined.
D: not prevail, because the lawyer was unconscious and unaware of what was happening for most of the confinement period.

Okay, so I've got this question about false imprisonment, and I'm a bit new to tort law, so I'll need to think this through step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is about a young lawyer who gets stuck in an elevator. She was working late, went to the elevator, pressed the ground floor button. The elevator goes down but stops, and the doors don't open. She tries the buttons and the intercom, but nothing works. She panics, hyperventilates, loses consciousness, and falls, hitting her head. She's unconscious for about 30 minutes until a security guard finds her and gets her out. The elevator stopped because of lack of maintenance; the owner had canceled service to save money. Now, she's suing for false imprisonment.

The question is whether she will prevail. The options are A to D.

First, I need to remember what false imprisonment entails. From what I recall, false imprisonment is a tort that involves the unlawful confinement of someone against their will. The key elements are that the confinement must be intentional, and the person must be aware of the confinement or suffer harm as a result.

Wait, but I've also heard that sometimes, if the confinement results in harm, even if the person isn't aware (like if they're unconscious), that might still count because of the physical injury.

So looking at the facts here: The elevator stopped because of poor maintenance. The owner didn't maintain it to save money, which sounds like negligence. But the question is about false imprisonment, which is an intentional tort.

So, for false imprisonment, the defendant must have intended to confine the plaintiff. But here, the confinement was due to the elevator malfunctioning because of lack of maintenance. The owner didn't intend for the elevator to stop; they were just negligent in maintaining it.

Wait, but does false imprisonment require specific intent, like the intent to confine, or is it enough that the actions were intentional and the confinement was a foreseeable result?

I'm a bit fuzzy here. Let me think. I remember that false imprisonment requires intent to confine another person, but it doesn't have to be hostile; just the intent to confine. So if someone intentionally does an act that they know will confine someone, that's enough.

But in this case, the owner didn't intend to cause the elevator to stop. They were just being negligent by not maintaining it. So the confinement was a result of negligence, not an intentional act.

So if the confinement was due to negligence, then it's not false imprisonment because that's an intentional tort. Instead, it might be negligence, but the question is about false imprisonment.

So considering the elements, if the owner didn't act with the intent to confine, then the lawyer can't win on false imprisonment. So the answer would hinge on whether the owner's action (or inaction) was intentional enough to constitute false imprisonment.

Wait, but the owner's action was canceling maintenance. That's an intentional decision, but the resulting confinement was not intentional. So the confinement was a result of their intentional choice to stop maintenance, but the act of confinement itself wasn't intentional.

Wait, but false imprisonment doesn't require that the confinement itself was intended, just that the defendant's actions were intentional and caused the confinement. Or does it?

I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. False imprisonment occurs when the defendant's intentional act causes the confinement. So if the defendant intended to perform an act that directly causes the confinement, even if they didn't intend for the person to be confined, but the confinement was a natural result.

Wait, no, that might not be accurate. I think the intent has to be to confine the person. For example, if someone locks you in a room intending to keep you there, that's false imprisonment. But if someone negligently causes a situation where you're confined, that's not false imprisonment because the intent to confine isn't present.

So in this case, the building owner was negligent in maintaining the elevator, which caused it to stop. But there's no intent to confine the lawyer. Therefore, it's not false imprisonment. So the lawyer wouldn't prevail on that claim.

Looking at the options:

Option C says she won't prevail because the owner didn't intentionally cause confinement. That seems to align with this reasoning.

Option B says she would prevail because she was injured. But injury alone doesn't make it false imprisonment; the intent is key.

Option A says because she was confined for an unreasonable time. But again, without intent, that's not enough.

Option D says because she was unconscious. But I think even if she was unconscious, if the confinement was intentional, it would still count. But in this case, the issue is the lack of intent, not her awareness.

So the correct answer should be C: not prevail because the owner didn't intentionally cause the confinement.

To determine whether the lawyer will prevail in a claim of false imprisonment against the building owner, it is essential to analyze the elements of false imprisonment. False imprisonment is an intentional tort that requires the defendant to act with the intent to confine the plaintiff, and the confinement must be without the plaintiff's consent. The confinement can be physical or through psychological coercion, but the key element is the defendant's intent to confine.

In this scenario, the lawyer was trapped in the elevator due to a malfunction caused by the building owner's failure to maintain the elevator properly. However, the owner's decision to cancel maintenance was driven by a desire to save money, which constitutes negligence rather than an intentional act to confine the lawyer. The confinement was an unintended consequence of the owner's negligent actions, not a deliberate attempt to restrict the lawyer's movement.

False imprisonment requires more than negligence; it requires intent to confine. Since the building owner did not intentionally cause the lawyer's confinement, the elements of false imprisonment are not satisfied. While the lawyer suffered harm during the confinement, the absence of intent to confine means that the claim for false imprisonment will not succeed. Therefore, the lawyer will not prevail on this claim.

The correct answer is:

**C: not prevail, because the building owner did not intentionally cause the lawyer to be confined.**
