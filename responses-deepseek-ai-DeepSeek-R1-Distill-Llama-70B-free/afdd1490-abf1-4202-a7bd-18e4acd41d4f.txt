Question:

A firm's inventory turnover (IT) is 5 times on a cost of goods sold (COGS) of $800,000. If the IT is improved to 8 times while the COGS remains the same, a substantial amount of funds is released from or additionally invested in inventory. In fact,

F: $200,000 is additionally invested.
G: $60,000 is additionally invested.
H: $60,000 is released.
I: $160,000 is additionally invested.

Okay, so I've got this question about inventory turnover and how it affects the funds tied up in inventory. Hmm, I remember that inventory turnover ratio is a measure of how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory in a given period. The formula, I think, is IT = COGS / Average Inventory. So COGS is the cost of goods sold, and average inventory is the average value of inventory during that period.

The question says that initially, the IT is 5 times, and COGS is $800,000. Then IT improves to 8 times, while COGS remains the same. We need to find out how much funds are released or invested because of this change.

Wait, so when IT increases, that means the company is selling its inventory more times over the period. That should mean they don't need to hold as much inventory on average. So if IT goes up, average inventory goes down. That would free up funds because they're not tying up as much money in inventory.

So the formula rearranged to find average inventory is Average Inventory = COGS / IT.

Initially, IT is 5. So initial average inventory is 800,000 / 5 = $160,000.

After the improvement, IT is 8. So new average inventory is 800,000 / 8 = $100,000.

So the change in average inventory is the initial minus the new, which is 160,000 - 100,000 = $60,000. So the company has $60,000 less tied up in inventory, which means $60,000 is released.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because if IT increases, the company needs less inventory, so they must have more cash available. So funds are released.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option H is $60,000 released. Option E is $140,000 released. Hmm, but I calculated $60,000. Wait, wait, no, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, initial average inventory is 800k /5=160k. After improvement, it's 800k/8=100k. So the decrease is 60k. So the company can free up 60k. So the funds released are $60,000.

Looking at the options, option H says $60,000 is released. So that should be the correct answer.

The inventory turnover (IT) ratio is calculated using the formula:

\[
IT = \frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
\]

Rearranging to solve for average inventory:

\[
\text{Average Inventory} = \frac{\text{COGS}}{IT}
\]

Initially, with \( IT = 5 \) and \( \text{COGS} = \$800,000 \):

\[
\text{Average Inventory (Initial)} = \frac{800,000}{5} = \$160,000
\]

After the improvement, with \( IT = 8 \):

\[
\text{Average Inventory (New)} = \frac{800,000}{8} = \$100,000
\]

The change in average inventory is:

\[
\text{Change} = \$160,000 - \$100,000 = \$60,000
\]

This means \$60,000 is released from inventory as the company no longer needs to hold this amount. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: $60,000 is released.**
