Okay, so I've got this question about finding 1's and 2's complements of some binary numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

First, I remember that the 1's complement is just flipping each bit. So for any binary number, changing every 0 to 1 and every 1 to 0. That part seems straightforward.

The 2's complement is a bit trickier. I think it's the 1's complement plus 1, but wait, only for numbers that aren't zero. Or wait, actually, the 2's complement is used to represent negative numbers in binary, right? So for a given binary number, to find its 2's complement, you invert the bits and add 1.

Wait, but in this question, are we dealing with the 2's complement of the number, or is it the 2's complement used to find the negative value? I think for this question, it's just asking for the 2's complement of the binary number itself, not necessarily making it a negative number.

So let's take each part one by one. The question has five parts: a) to e), each with a binary number. For each, I need to compute the 1's and 2's complements.

Let's start with part a) 1010101.

For 1's complement, I'll flip each bit:
1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1, etc. So 1010101 becomes 0101010.

Then, the 2's complement is the 1's complement plus 1. So 0101010 + 1 is 0101011. Wait, no, wait—no, wait. Wait, 2's complement is the 1's complement plus 1. So if the original number is 1010101, the 1's complement is 0101010, then add 1: 0101010 + 1 = 0101011. So 2's complement is 0101011.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. Suppose the number is positive and we're finding its 2's complement. Wait, no, 2's complement is typically used to represent the negative of a number. So for a binary number, its 2's complement would be the negative version of it. But the question is phrased as "the 2's complement of the following binary numbers", so it's just the value obtained by flipping the bits and adding one, regardless of sign.

So for a) 1010101:

1's complement: 0101010.

2's complement: 0101010 + 1 = 0101011.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see which one matches this. Let's look at the options.

Option A for part a) 1's is 1010100, which doesn't match what I got. So option A is wrong. Option B for a) 1's is 0101011, which is what I got for 2's complement. So maybe not.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check each option. Let me go through each part and compute then see which option matches.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all parts first.

Part a) 1010101.

1's complement: 0101010.

2's complement: 0101010 +1 = 0101011.

So for part a), 1's is 0101010 and 2's is 0101011.

Looking at the options:

Option B has for a) 1's: 0101011, which doesn't match. Option C: 1's 0101010, 2's 0101001. No, 2's is +1, so 0101011.

Wait, none of the options might have this. Let me check all.

Wait maybe I made a mistake. Let me recompute:

Original number a) 1010101.

1's complement: invert each bit.

1→0, 0→1, 1→0, 0→1, 1→0, 0→1, 1→0.

So 1010101 → 0101010.

2's complement: 0101010 + 1.

Adding 1: 0101010 + 0000001 = 0101011.

So a's correct 1's is 0101010 and 2's is 0101011.

Looking through options:

Option B's a) 1's is 0101011, which is higher than what I have. So no. Option C's a) 1's is 0101010, but 2's is 0101001. That's not correct. Option F's a) 1's is 0101010, 2's is 1010101. Wait, no, that's the original number. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps in some cases, the 2's complement requires leading 1s to be considered. But I'm not sure.

Let me move to part b) 0111000.

1's complement: invert each bit → 1000111.

2's complement: 1000111 +1 = 1001000.

Wait, 1000111 + 1: the last bit is 1, adding 1 would carry over. So 1000111 → 1001000.

So 1's is 1000111, 2's is 1001000.

Looking at the options:

Option B, part b) 1's is 1000110, which doesn't match. Option F, part b) 1's is 1000111, 2's is 0111000. Wait, 0111000 is the original number. So no. Option H, part b) 1's is 1000111, 2's is 0111000. Wait, 2's would be 1001000, but option H says 0111000 which is the original. That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed to compute all parts to find which option matches.

Part c) 0000001.

1's complement: 1111110.

2's complement: 1111110 +1 = 1111111.

So for c), 1's is 1111110, 2's is 1111111.

Looking at options:

Option C for c) 1's is 1111101, 2's is 1111110. No. Option F for c) 1's is 1111110, 2's is 0000001. Wait, 0000001 is original. So no. Option H for c) 1's is 1111111, 2's is 0000000. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, 0000001's 1's complement is 1111110, and 2's is 1111111. So which option has that?

Looking at option H for part c: 1's is 1111111, 2's is 0000000. So that's not matching. Option B for part c: 1's is 1111111, 2's is 0000000. Also not correct. Option E for c: 1's is 0000010, 2's is 0000001. No.

Wait, perhaps I should check all parts.

Part d) 10000.

1's complement: 01111.

2's complement: 01111 +1 = 10000.

Wait, that's interesting. Because 01111 +1 = 10000. So for d), 1's is 01111 and 2's is 10000.

Wait, but 10000 is the original number. So the 2's complement is same as the original. That can't be right. Wait, 2's complement is the 1's complement plus 1. So 10000 is 5 bits. So 1's is 01111, which is 15 in 4 bits? Wait, wait, 4 bits would be 10000 as a 5-bit number. Wait, 10000 is 16 in 5 bits.

Wait, 10000 in 5 bits is 16. Its 1's complement is 01111 (which is 15 in 5 bits). Adding 1 gives 10000, which is 16. Hmm, but the 2's complement is 10000, same as original. That's correct because 2's complement of 10000 (which is 16) would be -16 in 5 bits, but wait, in 5 bits, the maximum positive number is 15 (01111), so 10000 would be -16, and its 2's complement would be itself, because flipping and adding 1 gives the same.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question treats all numbers as unsigned. So for any binary number, the 2's complement is 1's complement +1.

So for d) 10000: 1's is 01111, 2's is 01111+1=10000. So correct.

Now, part e) 0000.

1's complement: 1111.

2's complement: 1111 +1 = 10000, but wait, 0000 is 4 bits. Adding 1 to 1111 gives 10000, which is 5 bits. Hmm, but perhaps the system uses the same number of bits. So in 4 bits, 1111 +1 would overflow and wrap around to 0000. So 2's complement of 0000 would be 0000.

Wait, that makes sense. Because 0's 2's complement is 0.

So for part e), 1's is 1111, 2's is 0000.

Now, let's compile all the correct answers:

a) 1's:0101010; 2's:0101011.

b) 1's:1000111; 2's:1001000.

c) 1's:1111110; 2's:1111111.

d) 1's:01111; 2's:10000.

e) 1's:1111; 2's:0000.

Now, let me look through the options to find which one matches all these.

Option A: a)1's:1010100. No. Doesn't match.

Option B: a)1's:0101011. No, because a's 1's is 0101010.

Option C: a)1's:0101010; 2's:0101001. No, 2's should be 0101011.

Option D: a)1's:1010101 (nope, that's the original), so D is wrong.

Option E: a)1's:1010101 (nope).

Option F: a)1's:0101010 (correct), 2's:1010101 (no, should be 0101011). So F's a is wrong.

Option G: a)1's:0101001. No.

Option H: a)1's:1111111, no.

Option I: a)1's:0101011, which is wrong.

Option J: a)1's:0101010 (correct). 2's:0101011 (correct). So J's a is correct.

Now, let's check part b for option J.

Option J, part b: 1's is 1000111, which matches our calculation. 2's is 1001000. Correct.

Part c: J's c)1's:1111110 (correct), 2's:1111111 (correct).

Part d: J's d)1's:01111 (correct), 2's:10000 (correct).

Part e: J's e)1's:1111 (correct), 2's:10000. Wait, wait, no. Our calculation for e) 2's is 0000. But option J's e) 2's is 10000. That's a problem.

Wait, did I make a mistake in part e? Let me recheck.

e) 0000.

1's complement: 1111.

2's complement: 1's complement plus 1. So 1111 + 1 = 10000.

Ah, but wait, if the original number is 0000 (4 bits), then adding 1 to 1111 (4 bits) would result in 10000, which is 5 bits. But in 4 bits, 1111 +1 overflows to 0000. So the 2's complement would be 0000.

Hmm, so depends on whether the system is using 4 bits or 5. The original number is 0000, which is 4 bits. So perhaps the 2's complement remains within 4 bits, making it 0000.

So in that case, option J's e) 2's complement is 10000, which is 5 bits, but e) is 4 bits. So perhaps the correct 2's complement is 0000.

Looking back at the options:

Which option has e) 2's complement as 0000? Let me check each option.

Option A: e)1's:0001 (no, e's 1's should be 1111 in 4 bits, which is 4 1's). So option A's e) is wrong.

Option B: e)1's:0001 (no, should be 1111). So B is wrong.

Option C: e)1's:1110. No.

Option D: e)1's:0000. 2's:1111. No.

Option E: e)1's:1111, 2's:1110. No.

Option F: e)1's:1111, 2's:0000. Yes! F's e) 2's is 0000.

Wait, but I thought J's e) was wrong. Let me check option F.

Option F:

a)1's:0101010, 2's:1010101. Wait, earlier for a), 2's should be 0101011, not 1010101. So F's a is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list all correct answers again:

a) 1's:0101010, 2's:0101011.

b)1's:1000111, 2's:1001000.

c)1's:1111110, 2's:1111111.

d)1's:01111, 2's:10000.

e)1's:1111, 2's:0000.

Looking for an option that matches all.

Looking at option F:

a)1's:0101010 (correct), 2's:1010101 (wrong, should be 0101011).

So F's a is wrong.

Option J:

a) correct.

b) correct.

c) correct.

d) correct.

e) 2's is 10000 (wrong, should be 0000).

So J's e is wrong.

Wait, maybe none of the options are correct. But that's impossible. Maybe I made a mistake in part e.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question treats e) as 4 bits, so 0000. Its 1's complement is 1111, 2's complement is 0000.

So let's see which option has e) 1's:1111, 2's:0000.

Looking through options:

Option F: e)1's:1111, 2's:0000. Yes.

Option J: e)1's:1111, 2's:10000. So F's e is correct.

But let's check other parts for option F:

a) F has a)1's:0101010, 2's:1010101. Wait, 1010101 is same as original number. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in a). Let me recompute a).

a)1010101.

1's complement: 0101010.

2's complement: 0101010 +1 = 0101011.

So F's a) 2's is 1010101. Wait, 1010101 is 1010101, which is the original. That doesn't make sense. So F's a is wrong.

Hmm. So let's check option J again.

Option J's e) 2's is 10000. But if the original is 0000 in 4 bits, the 2's complement is 0000. So J's e is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in e). Let me think again. For the binary number 0000, 1's complement is 1111, adding 1 gives 10000. But if we're considering 4 bits, adding 1 would cause an overflow, so it becomes 0000. So 2's complement is 0000. So the correct 2's complement for e) is 0000.

Looking for an option where e) 2's is 0000. So option F has e) 2's:0000, but a) is wrong.

Looking again, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question treats all numbers as having leading zeros to make them the same length. For example, part a is 7 bits, part b is 7 bits, part c is 7, d is 5, e is 4.

Wait, the original numbers:

a)1010101 →7 bits.

b)0111000 →7 bits.

c)0000001 →7 bits.

d)10000 →5 bits.

e)0000 →4 bits.

So when calculating 2's complement, perhaps each part is treated with its own bit length.

So for e)0000 (4 bits):

1's complement is 1111.

Adding 1: 1111 +1 = 10000, which is 5 bits. But in 4 bits, it's 0000.

So 2's complement is 0000.

So correct 2's complement for e) is 0000.

Only option F and option J have e)1's:1111. F has e)2's:0000, J has e)2's:10000.

So F's e is correct, but a is wrong.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option where all parts are correct except e, but then no option fits.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part a.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option where a's 1's is 0101010 and 2's is 0101011.

Looking for that.

Looking at the options:

Option J for a) has 1's:0101010, 2's:0101011. Wait, no. Option J's a) 2's is 010101
