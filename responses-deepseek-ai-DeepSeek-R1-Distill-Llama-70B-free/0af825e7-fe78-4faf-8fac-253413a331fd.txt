Question:

An Aston Martin V8 Vantage sports car has a lateral acceleration of $0.96g = (0.96)(9.8 m / s^2) = 9.4 m / s^2$. This is the maximum centripetal acceleration the car can sustain without skidding out of a curved path. If the car is traveling at a constant 40m/s on level ground, what is the radius R of the tightest unbanked curve it can negotiate? (Unit: m))

Options:

A: 190
B: 150
C: 220
D: 200
E: 160
F: 180
G: 230
H: 170
I: 210
J: 140

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about an Aston Martin V8 Vantage sports car. It says the car has a lateral acceleration of 0.96g, which is given as 9.4 m/s². That's the maximum centripetal acceleration it can have without skidding. The car is moving at a constant speed of 40 m/s on level ground, and we need to find the radius R of the tightest unbanked curve it can take. The options are A to J, each with different numbers.

Hmm, right. So centripetal acceleration is what keeps the car moving in a circular path. I remember that the formula for centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r, where v is velocity and r is radius. Oh wait, because a is provided, and we have to find r.

So the plan is to rearrange the formula to solve for r. Let me write this down:

a = v² / r  →  r = v² / a

Wait, I think that's right. So plugging in the numbers, v is 40 m/s and a is 9.4 m/s².

Let me compute v squared first. 40 squared is 1600. Then divide by 9.4. Let's see, 1600 divided by 9.4. Hmm, doing this in my head might be tricky. Maybe I can approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's see:

1600 / 9.4 = ?

Well, 9.4 times 170 is 1598. Because 170 *9 is 1530, and 170*0.4 is 68, so 1530+68=1598. Oh wait, that's very close to 1600. So 9.4 * 170 = 1598. So 1600 is 2 more than 1598, which would mean 170 plus 2/9.4. 2/9.4 is approximately 0.213. So about 170.213 meters.

Wait, but the options don't have 170.213. Let's look at the options again. The options are A:190, B:150, C:220, D:200, E:160, F:180, G:230, H:170, I:210, J:140.

Oh, option H is 170, which is very close to our calculation. But let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 40 squared is 1600, right? And 9.4 is the acceleration. So 1600 divided by 9.4 is indeed about 170.21. So the closest option is H:170.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. The formula is correct, right? Centripetal acceleration a is v squared over r. So solving for r gives v squared over a.

Yes, that's correct. So plugging in the numbers gives us around 170.2 meters. So the answer should be option H:170.

Wait a moment, but why isn't there an option for 170.2? Well, the options are all whole numbers, so 170 is the closest one. So the correct answer is H.

To determine the radius \( R \) of the tightest unbanked curve the Aston Martin V8 Vantage can negotiate, we use the formula for centripetal acceleration:

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{R}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{v^2}{a}
\]

Given:
- \( v = 40 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( a = 9.4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

First, calculate \( v^2 \):

\[
v^2 = 40^2 = 1600
\]

Now divide by \( a \):

\[
R = \frac{1600}{9.4} \approx 170.21 \, \text{m}
\]

The closest option to \( 170.21 \, \text{m} \) is \( 170 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
