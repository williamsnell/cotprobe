Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem where a homeowner wants to maintain an average of $40 a month for fuel oil over a 6-month heating season. He's already made some purchases, and I need to find out how much he needs to spend in the last month to keep that average. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the average is $40 per month for 6 months. So the total amount he should spend over the six months is 6 times 40, right? Let me calculate that. 6 times 40 is 240. So the total expenditure for six months needs to be $240.

Now, let's look at how much he's spent so far. The amounts given are $37.50, $42.60, $39.80, $40.75, and $44.10. Wait, that's five months of payments. So I need to add these up and see what's left for the sixth month.

Let me add them one by one. Starting with 37.50. Adding 42.60 to that gives me... 37.50 + 42.60 is 80.10. Then add 39.80: 80.10 + 39.80 equals 119.90. Next is 40.75: adding that brings the total to 160.65. Finally, adding 44.10 gives 204.75. So the total spent so far is $204.75.

Wait, let me check that addition again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 37.50 plus 42.60 is indeed 80.10. Then, 80.10 plus 39.80: 80 + 39 is 119, and 0.10 + 0.80 is 0.90, so 119.90. Then 119.90 +40.75: 119 +40 is 159, 0.90 +0.75 is 1.65, so 160.65. Then 160.65 +44.10: 160 +44 is 204, 0.65 +0.10 is 0.75, so 204.75. Yes, that's correct.

So the total so far is $204.75. Since the total needs to be $240, the amount he needs to spend in the last month is 240 minus 204.75. Let me calculate that. 240 - 204 is 36, and then subtract 0.75 more. So 36 - 0.75 equals 35.25. So he needs to spend $35.25 in the last month.

Looking at the options, option A is $35.25. So the answer should be A.

To determine how much the homeowner needs to spend in the last month to maintain an average of $40 per month over 6 months, we first calculate the total required expenditure: 

\[
6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars}.
\]

Next, we sum the amounts already spent: 

\[
37.50 + 42.60 + 39.80 + 40.75 + 44.10 = 204.75 \text{ dollars}.
\]

The amount needed in the last month is the difference between the total required and the amount already spent: 

\[
240 - 204.75 = 35.25 \text{ dollars}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **A: $35.25**.
