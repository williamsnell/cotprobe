The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What do thecodonsAUG, UAG, UAA, and UGA code for?

Options:

A: AUG codes for aspartic acid, while UAG codes for tryptophan, UAA for cysteine, and UGA for arginine.
B: AUG codes for serine and is a regular codon in the middle of the mRNA sequence. UAG, UAA, and UGA code for the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, respectively.
C: AUG codes for methionine and signals the end of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are terminator codons, they code for various amino acids.
D: AUG codes for tyrosine, UAG, UAA, and UGA are initiator codons.
E: AUG codes for methionine and signals the start of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are terminator codons, they code for no amino acids and signal the end of a polypeptide chain.
F: AUG codes for glycine and is an elongation codon, while UAG, UAA, and UGA code for the start of protein synthesis.
G: AUG is a terminator codon that signals the end of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are non-standard codons that incorporate unusual amino acids.
H: AUG codes for alanine and signals the continuation of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are codons that code for branching amino acids.
I: AUG codes for valine, while UAG, UAA, and UGA code for essential amino acids.
J: AUG codes for leucine and signals the start of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are initiator codons, they code for no amino acids and signal the start of a polypeptide chain.

Okay, so I have this question about codons and what they code for. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that codons are sequences of three nucleotides in mRNA that correspond to specific amino acids or stop signals. The question is about four specific codons: AUG, UAG, UAA, and UGA.

Wait, let me think. I recall that most codons code for amino acids, but there are some that don't. Oh right, there are start and stop codons. The start codon is AUG, which I think codes for methionine, and that's where translation begins. So when the ribosome sees AUG, it starts building the protein, and methionine is the first amino acid.

Then there are the stop codons. I think there are three of them. UAG, UAA, and UGA. These don't code for any amino acids. Instead, when the ribosome encounters them, it stops adding amino acids and releases the polypeptide chain. So these are termination signals.

Let me look at the options. Option A says AUG codes for aspartic acid. No, that's not right because AUG is methionine. So A is wrong.

Option B: AUG as serine? No, that's wrong. Also, it says UAG, UAA, UGA code for leucine, etc. No, those are stop codons. So B is incorrect.

Option C: AUG codes for methionine and signals end. Wait, no. AUG is the start, not the end. So C is wrong.

Option D: AUG as tyrosine? No, that's wrong. And the others as initiator codons? No, because initiator is AUG. So D is wrong.

Option E: AUG codes for methionine and is start. Then UAG, UAA, UGA are terminator, no amino acids. That sounds right. So E might be the correct answer.

Option F: AUG as glycine? No, that's wrong. So F is incorrect.

Option G: AUG as terminator? No, it's a start codon. So G is wrong.

Option H: AUG as alanine? No, that's not right. So H is wrong.

Option I: AUG as valine? No, that's wrong. So I is incorrect.

Option J: AUG as leucine and start. No, start is methionine. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option E. It correctly identifies AUG as the start codon for methionine and the others as stop codons that don't code for amino acids.

The correct answer is option E. AUG is the start codon, coding for methionine and signaling the beginning of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are stop codons that do not code for any amino acids and signal the end of the polypeptide chain.

Answer: E
