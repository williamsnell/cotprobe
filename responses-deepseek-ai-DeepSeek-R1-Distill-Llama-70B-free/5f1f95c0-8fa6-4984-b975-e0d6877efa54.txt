Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Ed Williams buying a new truck for his business. I need to figure out the amount he has to finance and then determine the monthly payment to pay it off in a year with a 5% finance charge. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's list out all the given information to make sure I don't miss anything. The price of the truck is $3,000, and there's additional equipment costing $240. Sales tax is 5%, and then there's insurance for $60. He made a cash deposit of $500, and there's a used car allowance of $732. The finance charge is 5%, and the term is one year, so 12 months.

I think the first thing I need to calculate is the total cost before any deductions. So that would be the price of the truck plus the additional equipment. Let me add those together: $3,000 plus $240 is $3,240. 

Next, I have to account for the sales tax. Sales tax is 5%, so I need to calculate 5% of $3,240. To compute that, I can multiply 3,240 by 0.05. Let me do that: 3,240 * 0.05 equals $162. So the total cost including tax is $3,240 + $162, which is $3,402.

Wait, but then there's insurance for $60. I'm assuming that's part of the total cost because it's probably required. So adding that in, the total becomes $3,402 + $60 = $3,462.

Now, I need to subtract the cash deposit and the used car allowance. The cash deposit is $500, and the used car allowance is $732. So total deductions are 500 + 732 = $1,232. Subtracting that from the total cost gives me $3,462 - $1,232. Let me calculate that: 3,462 minus 1,232 is $2,230. So the amount to be financed is $2,230.

Wait, but some of the options don't include this number. Let me check my calculations again. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in adding up the initial costs. Let me go through that again.

Price of truck: $3,000
Additional equipment: $240
Total before tax: 3,000 + 240 = 3,240.

Sales tax is 5% of that, which is 0.05 * 3,240 = 162. So 3,240 + 162 = 3,402.

Then add insurance: 3,402 + 60 = 3,462.

Subtract the deposit and allowance: 3,462 - (500 + 732) = 3,462 - 1,232 = 2,230.

Hmm, so that's the amount to be financed. Now, looking at the options, let me see. Option E is $2,068, and option G is $2,341.50. Neither matches 2,230. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Oh, maybe the insurance is included in the sales tax calculation? Or perhaps the insurance is not part of the taxable amount. Let me think about how sales tax is applied.

Sales tax is usually applied to the price of the item, which would include the truck and any additional equipment, but maybe not the insurance. Let me re-calculate the sales tax without the insurance. So, if the insurance is separate, perhaps it's added after the sales tax.

So, truck and equipment: $3,240. Sales tax is 5% of that, which is $162. So the total after tax is 3,240 + 162 = $3,402. Then add the insurance of $60, making it $3,462. Then subtract the deposit ($500) and allowance ($732), totaling $3,462 - $1,232 = $2,230.

Hmm, same result. So perhaps the options are considering something else. Let me look at the options again. The options for the amount to be financed are B ($2,800), E ($2,068), F ($2,500), G ($2,341.50), I ($2,145). None of these are 2,230. So maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to include the finance charge in the amount to be financed. Oh, right! The finance charge is 5%, so that's an additional cost added to the amount to be financed.

Wait, no, the finance charge is typically calculated on the amount being financed. So the steps would be: calculate the total amount owed before financing, subtract the down payment, then calculate the finance charge on the remaining balance.

Wait, perhaps I approached it incorrectly. Let me try this again.

Total cost including tax and insurance is $3,462. Subtract the cash deposit and used car allowance: $3,462 - $500 - $732 = $3,462 - $1,232 = $2,230. This is the amount that needs to be financed. Now, the finance charge is 5% per annum on this amount. So the finance charge would be 5% of $2,230, which is 0.05 * 2,230 = $111.50. So the total amount to be paid back is $2,230 + $111.50 = $2,341.50.

Ah, so the amount to be financed is $2,230, but with the finance charge, the total becomes $2,341.50. Looking at the options, option G is $2,341.50, which would be the total amount financed including the charge. But wait, the question asks first for the amount to be financed, and then the monthly payment. So the amount to be financed is $2,230, but when calculating the monthly payment, we need to include the finance charge.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The finance charge is added to the principal, so the total amount owed is principal plus finance charge. So the total to be financed is $2,230, but the total amount to be paid over the year is $2,230 + $111.50 = $2,341.50. Then, this total is divided into 12 monthly payments.

So the monthly payment would be $2,341.50 divided by 12. Let me calculate that: 2,341.50 / 12. 12*195 is 2,340, so approximately $195.08 per month. But looking at the options, I see D ($195) and J ($220.75), among others.

Wait, maybe I should do the exact calculation. 2,341.50 divided by 12. Let's do this: 2,341.50 ÷ 12. 12 × 195 = 2,340. So 2,341.50 - 2,340 = $1.50 left. So that's $195 per month for the first 11 months, and $195 + $1.50 = $196.50 in the last month. But that's not one of the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the finance charge is calculated differently.

Alternatively, maybe the finance charge is added to the amount financed, and then the total is divided by 12. So the total to pay back is $2,341.50, so each month is 2,341.50 / 12. Let me compute that: 2,341.5 ÷ 12 = approximately 195.125, so about $195.13 per month. The closest option is D: $195, but let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is $185.42, and option J is $220.75. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in calculating the finance charge. Let me think again.

Wait, the finance charge is 5%, but perhaps it's 5% of the amount being financed, which is $2,230. So 5% of $2,230 is indeed $111.50, making the total $2,341.50.

Alternatively, maybe the finance charge is calculated using simple interest, so the total amount to be paid back is $2,230 + 111.50 = $2,341.50, divided by 12 months.

Another approach: the monthly payment can be calculated using the simple interest formula. The formula is:

Monthly payment = (Principal + (Principal × rate × time)) / number of payments.

Here, principal is $2,230, rate is 5% per year, time is 1 year. So the interest is 2,230 × 0.05 × 1 = 111.50. So total is 2,230 + 111.50 = 2,341.50. Then, divided by 12, it's 2,341.50 / 12 ≈ 195.125, which is approximately $195.13 per month. So the closest option is D: $195.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is $2,068, which is the amount to be financed before adding the finance charge? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the insurance is not included in the amount financed. Let me think: sometimes, insurance might be paid separately, but in the problem statement, it's listed under "pertinent information," so I think it's included as part of the cost.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the used car allowance is subtracted before calculating sales tax. No, that doesn't make sense because the allowance is like a trade-in, so it would reduce the total cost after tax and other costs.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sales tax. Let me recalculate that. The price is $3,000 plus $240 is $3,240. Sales tax is 5%, which is 0.05 × 3,240 = $162. So total before insurance is $3,402. Adding insurance brings it to $3,462. Then subtract deposit and allowance: 500 + 732 = 1,232. 3,462 - 1,232 = 2,230. So that's correct.

So the amount to be financed is $2,230. Then, the finance charge is 5% on that, which is $111.50. So total to pay is $2,341.50. Divided by 12 months, that's approximately $195.13 per month. So the closest option is D: $195.

Looking back at the options, option E is $2,068, which doesn't match anything I calculated. Option G is $2,341.50, which is the total amount including the finance charge. So perhaps the first part of the question is asking for the amount to be financed before the finance charge, which is $2,230, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the finance charge as part of the amount to be financed.

Wait, the question says "find the amount to be financed, and determine the amount to be paid each month." So perhaps the amount to be financed is $2,230, and then with the finance charge, the monthly payment is calculated on the total, which is $2,341.50. So the payment is $195.13, which is option D.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way to calculate the monthly payment. Sometimes, the finance charge is calculated monthly, but in this case, it's a 5% annual charge. So the interest per month would be 5% divided by 12, but that's more complicated. However, the problem states a 5% finance charge, so I think it's a simple interest calculation on the principal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the finance charge as part of the amount financed, so the amount to be financed is the total cost minus down payment, including tax and insurance, and then the finance charge is added on top. So in that case, the amount to be financed is $2,230, and the finance charge is $111.50, making the total $2,341.50, which is option G, but that's for the total amount.

Wait, but in the options, G is $2,341.50, which would be the total amount to be paid, including the finance charge. So the monthly payment would be $2,341.50 / 12 = approx $195.12, which is option D.

So the amount to be financed is $2,230, and the monthly payment is approximately $195.12, so option D: $195.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 2,341.50 divided by 12 exactly. 2,341.50 divided by 12 is:

12 × 195 = 2,340, as I thought earlier. So 2,341.50 - 2,340 = 1.50. So the first 11 payments would be $195 each, totaling 2,340, and the last payment would be $1.50, but that's not a standard monthly payment. So perhaps the monthly payment is rounded to the nearest cent, making each payment $195.13. But the options don't have that exact amount.

Looking back at the options, the choices for the monthly payment are A: $196.50, C: $185.42, D: $195, H: $210.50, J: $220.75.

So D is $195, which is the closest to our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different method, such as the add-on method where the interest is added first, making the total $2,341.50, and then the monthly payment is $195.12, but since the options don't have that, D is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the amount financed without the finance charge, but that wouldn't make sense because the finance charge is part of the total to be paid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in including the insurance. Let me check that again. The problem says "insurance $60." Is that part of the cost or an annual expense? Hmm, I think it's part of the total cost because it's listed under the pertinent information. So yes, it should be included.

Wait another thought: perhaps the sales tax is calculated only on the truck and additional equipment, and then insurance is added without tax. So the total would be:

Truck: $3,000
Equipment: $240 → subtotal $3,240
Sales tax: 5% of 3,240 = $162 → total so far $3,402
Insurance: $60 → total $3,462
Then subtract deposit ($500) and allowance ($732) → $3,462 - $1,232 = $2,230.

So that's correct. Now, adding the finance charge: 5% of $2,230 is $111.50, making the total $2,341.50. Divided by 12, that's approximately $195.13 per month. So the answer should be D: $195.

But wait, let me check if any of the options include $2,230. The options for the first part (amount to be financed) are B: $2,800, E: $2,068, F: $2,500, G: $2,341.50, I: $2,145. So none of these match. So perhaps the question is asking for the total amount to be paid (including finance charge), which would be $2,341.50, option G. But the question specifies first the amount to be financed, then the monthly payment. So the first part is $2,230, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is structured differently. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach:

Total cost before any deductions: price + equipment + tax + insurance.

Wait, maybe the tax is applied after adding equipment, but before insurance. So:

Truck: $3,000
Equipment: $240 → $3,240
Tax: 5% of 3,240 = $162 → $3,402
Insurance: $60 → $3,462
Deposit: $500
Allowance: $732

So total deductions: 500 + 732 = 1,232. So 3,462 - 1,232 = 2,230.

Finance charge: 5% of 2,230 = 111.50 → total amount 2,341.50.

So the amount to be financed is 2,230, and the total to pay is 2,341.50. So the monthly payment is 2,341.50 /12 ≈ 195.13.

But the options don't have 2,230, but option G is 2,341.50, which is the total including finance charge. So perhaps the question is asking for the total amount to be financed, including the finance charge, which would be option G. But the question says "amount to be financed," which typically refers to the principal, not including the interest. So I'm confused because none of the options match 2,230.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the finance charge as part of the amount to be financed. So the amount to be financed would be 2,230 + 111.50 = 2,341.50, which is option G. Then the monthly payment would be 2,341.50 divided by 12, which is approximately 195.13, so option D: $195.

But the question first asks for the amount to be financed, then the monthly payment. So the first part would be 2,230, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is considering the total amount to be financed as including the finance charge, making it 2,341.50, option G. Then the monthly payment would be 2,341.50 /12 ≈ 195.13, so option D.

Wait, but in the options, both G and D are present. So perhaps the correct answers are G for the amount to be financed and D for the monthly payment. But looking at the options, the question is structured as a single choice, so perhaps the question is asking for the monthly payment. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "Assume a 5% finance charge, find the amount to be financed, and determine the amount to be paid each month to pay off the truck in one year." So it's asking for both, but in the options, each option is a single value. So perhaps the question expects two answers, but since it's a multiple-choice with single selection, perhaps the question is only asking for the monthly payment, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the options are for the monthly payment. Let me look again. The options are labeled A-J, each a single amount. So perhaps the question is asking for the monthly payment, which would be approximately $195.13, option D: $195.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier steps. Let me try calculating the total amount to be financed again, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, the total amount financed is calculated as:

Amount financed = (Total cost including tax and insurance) - cash deposit + used car allowance.
