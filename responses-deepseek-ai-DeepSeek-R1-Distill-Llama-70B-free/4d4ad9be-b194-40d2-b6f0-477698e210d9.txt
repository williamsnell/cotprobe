Question:

Explain how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered.

Options:

A: The codon AUG, which also signals the start of protein synthesis, codes for phenylalanine
B: The triplet GGA was identified as the codon for phenylalanine through early genetic experiments
C: The codon CCC corresponds to phenylalanine
D: The codon UUU is the sequence of bases which causes phenylalanine to be placed in the polypeptide chain
E: Phenylalanine is coded by the codon GGG
F: The codon UUA was incorrectly thought to code for phenylalanine before further research clarified the correct codon
G: The codon AAG signals for the addition of phenylalanine to the polypeptide chain
H: The codon AGU was found to code for serine, but was initially believed to code for phenylalanine
I: The codon UUC was the first discovered sequence to code for phenylalanine
J: The codon AAA codes for phenylalanine

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered. Hmm, I remember that codons are sequences of three nucleotides that correspond to specific amino acids or stop signals. There are 64 possible codons because there are four nucleotides and three positions, so 4^3 is 64.

I think the discovery of codons came from experiments where scientists tried to determine which triplet codes for which amino acid. One of the key experiments I remember is something called the Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment. Oh right, they used synthetic RNA to see which codons bound to specific tRNA molecules, which are charged with amino acids.

In that experiment, they made different RNA sequences and observed which amino acids were incorporated into proteins. For example, when they used polyuracil (a string of U's), they found that phenylalanine was the amino acid added. So the codon must be UUU because it's a triplet. Wait, but wait. Another thought: I also remember that there are six codons for phenylalanine, but the main one is UUU and UUC. Oh, but the first codon discovered was UUU.

Looking at the options:

Option A: AUG codes for phenylalanine. Wait, no, I think AUG is the start codon, which codes for methionine. So A is incorrect.

Option B: GGA for phenylalanine. I don't think so. GGA is actually glycine, I believe. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think. GGA would be Glycine (since GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG are all glycine), so B is wrong.

Option C: CCC is phenylalanine. Wait, no. CCC is Proline, I think. Because CCN codons are proline. So C is incorrect.

Option D: UUU is phenylalanine. From what I remember, yes. So D could be correct.

Option E: GGG for phenylalanine. No, GGG is glycine. So E is wrong.

Option F: UUA incorrectly thought to code for phenylalanine. Wait, UUA is a stop codon? Or is it a Leucine? No, wait. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA. So UUA is a Leucine codon. So F is incorrect.

Option G: AAG for phenylalanine. No, AAG is Lysine. So G is wrong.

Option H: AGU for serine. AGU is Serine, correct. But this option says it was initially thought to be phenylalanine, which I don't think is right. So H is incorrect.

Option I: UUC as the first discovered. Wait, in the Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment, I think UUU was the first. UUC is also a Phe codon, but was it the first found? I'm not sure. The initial experiment with poly-U would have given UUU as the codon, so I think UUU was the first, making D correct. So I is about UUC being the first, which I don't think is right.

Option J: AAA for Phe. No, AAA is lysine. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer is D: UUU is the codon for phenylalanine, discovered through early experiments where poly-U RNA directed the incorporation of phenylalanine.

The codon for phenylalanine was discovered through early experiments where scientists used synthetic RNA to determine which triplet sequences corresponded to specific amino acids. In the Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment, polyuracil (a string of U's) was used, and it was found that the amino acid phenylalanine was incorporated into the polypeptide chain. This led to the identification of the codon UUU as the sequence that codes for phenylalanine. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because AUG is the start codon, coding for methionine, not phenylalanine.
- **B** is incorrect because GGA codes for glycine, not phenylalanine.
- **C** is incorrect because CCC codes for proline, not phenylalanine.
- **D** is correct because UUU was identified as the codon for phenylalanine through early experiments.
- **E** is incorrect because GGG codes for glycine, not phenylalanine.
- **F** is incorrect because UUA codes for leucine, not phenylalanine.
- **G** is incorrect because AAG codes for lysine, not phenylalanine.
- **H** is incorrect because AGU codes for serine, not phenylalanine.
- **I** is incorrect because UUC, while also a codon for phenylalanine, was not the first discovered; UUU was.
- **J** is incorrect because AAA codes for lysine, not phenylalanine.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**, as UUU was the first codon identified for phenylalanine.
