Question:

What is the potential impact on the money supply of an open market sale by the FED of $3,000,000 in government bonds, assuming all commercial banks are fully "loaned up" (i.e., their excess reserves are zero), and the re-quired reserve ratio is 25%?

Options:

A: $6,000,000 reduction
B: $12,000,000 reduction
C: $20,000,000 reduction
D: $3,000,000 increase
E: $8,000,000 reduction
F: $15,000,000 reduction
G: No impact on the money supply
H: $3,000,000 reduction
I: $24,000,000 reduction
J: $9,000,000 reduction

Okay, so I have this question about the impact of an open market sale by the Fed on the money supply. Hmm, I remember that open market operations are one of the tools the Fed uses to control the money supply. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the Fed sells $3,000,000 in government bonds. When the Fed sells bonds, they're taking them from the banks, right? So the banks' reserves decrease because they're giving up bonds and the Fed is taking money out of the economy. The initial effect is a reduction in the banks' reserves by $3 million.

Now, the important part is understanding how this affects the money supply. I remember something about the money multiplier effect. The money multiplier depends on the reserve requirement. The question states that the required reserve ratio is 25%, which is 0.25 as a decimal.

Wait, but it also says that all commercial banks are fully "loaned up", meaning their excess reserves are zero. So they have no extra reserves beyond what's required. That probably means that they can't make any new loans when their reserves are reduced because they don't have any buffer.

So when the Fed sells $3 million in bonds, the banks lose $3 million in reserves. Because the reserve ratio is 25%, the banks must maintain that ratio. If their reserves drop by $3 million, they can't lend out any more money. But wait, how does this affect the money supply?

The money supply is affected because when banks have fewer reserves, they can't create as much money through loans. Let me think about the multiplier effect. The formula for the money supply change is the initial change in reserves multiplied by 1 divided by the reserve ratio.

Wait, no, wait. The money multiplier is (1 / reserve ratio). So in this case, 1 / 0.25 is 4. So if the Fed sells $3 million in bonds, the reserves decrease by $3 million. But because the banks were fully loaned up, the total money supply reduction should be the change in reserves times the multiplier.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me clarify. When the Fed sells bonds, the first impact is on the banks' reserves. If the Fed sells $3 million, the banks' reserves go down by $3 million. Since the required reserve ratio is 25%, the banks have to reduce their loans by whatever amount that would bring their reserves back to compliance.

Wait, another way to look at it: The money supply is checking deposits plus currency. When the Fed sells bonds, it's absorbing money from the banks. The banks' reserves decrease, which means they have to reduce their lending. Each loan they make is a deposit, so reducing loans reduces the money supply.

But how much does it reduce? Because of the reserve requirement, each dollar of reserves can support more loans. Wait, no, selling bonds reduces reserves, which leads to a contraction in loans. The amount by which the money supply decreases is the initial change in reserves times the money multiplier.

Wait, but in this case, the banks are fully loaned up, so their excess reserves are zero. That means when their reserves decrease by $3 million, they can't make any new loans. But I'm trying to find the impact on the total money supply.

Wait, the process is: The Fed sells bonds, so banks give the Fed $3 million, reducing their reserves by $3 million. Because the reserve ratio is 25%, the banks must ensure that their reserves are 25% of their deposits. If their reserves are down by $3 million, they have to reduce their loans, which are assets on their balance sheet.

So the initial decrease is $3 million in reserves. But the money supply (which is mainly deposits) will decrease by a multiple of that. The money multiplier is 1 / 0.25 = 4. So the total change in the money supply is 3 million * 4 = $12 million reduction.

But wait, the options include $12 million as option B. Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the multiplier effect here. When the Fed sells bonds, it's a reverse of when they buy bonds. When they buy, they increase reserves, leading to more loans and money supply. Selling does the opposite.

So an open market sale reduces the money supply. The impact is calculated as the change in reserves (delta R) times the money multiplier (1 / rr). So delta R is -$3 million, and multiplier is 4, so total change is -3 *4= -12 million.

So looking at the options, option B is $12 million reduction. But wait, let me double-check the setup. The banks are fully loaned up, so excess reserves are zero. That means any change in required reserves will directly affect the lending. So, the initial sale reduces the reserves by $3M, which forces a reduction in deposits (money supply) by 4 times that, so $12M decrease.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be B: $12,000,000 reduction.

When the Fed conducts an open market sale of $3,000,000 in government bonds, it reduces the reserves of commercial banks by $3,000,000. Since the banks are fully "loaned up" (excess reserves are zero), they must reduce their loans to maintain the required reserve ratio of 25%. 

The money multiplier effect comes into play, where the money supply changes by the initial change in reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. The money multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{\text{reserve ratio}} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \). Therefore, the total reduction in the money supply is:

\[
\Delta \text{Money Supply} = \Delta \text{Reserves} \times \text{Money Multiplier} = -\$3,000,000 \times 4 = -\$12,000,000
\]

Thus, the potential impact of the open market sale is a **$12,000,000 reduction** in the money supply.
