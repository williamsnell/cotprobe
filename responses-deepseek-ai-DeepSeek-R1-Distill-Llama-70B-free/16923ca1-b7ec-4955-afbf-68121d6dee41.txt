The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Because of a sudden and unanticipated severe shortage of heating fuel, the President has ordered all offices of federal executive agencies to be open only four days per week. The President's order allows an exception to the extent that emergency circumstances require different hours of operation (as in the case of federal hospitals). When Congress enacted the appropriations statute for operating all federal executive agencies, its members assumed that the offices of those agencies would be open five days per week, but Congress did not include such a requirement in its appropriations statute or in any other statute. Is the President's order constitutional?

Options:

A: No, because the heads of the various executive agencies have final responsibility for the operation of those agencies' offices.
B: No, because when they passed the statute appropriating monies for the operation of executive agencies, members of Congress assumed that those agencies' offices would be open five days per week.
C: Yes, because the Constitution vests the President with plenary authority to direct the administration of all federal agencies in any manner the President deems expedient.
D: Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.

Okay, so I've got this question about the President's order to reduce the operating hours of federal executive agencies due to a heating fuel shortage. The President is allowing an exception for emergencies like federal hospitals. The issue is whether this order is constitutional.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the Constitution gives the President the role of ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed. So, the President is in charge of the executive branch. But what about when Congress appropriates funds? Does that give Congress control over how agencies operate day-to-day?

In this case, Congress appropriated money assuming agencies would operate five days a week, but they didn't include that requirement in any statute. So, the question is whether the President can change the operating hours without violating any laws or overstepping his authority.

I think the key here is about the President's authority to manage the executive branch. The Constitution doesn't explicitly say the President can set the hours, but under the Take Care Clause, the President has the duty to execute the laws. Managing the day-to-day operations, like hours of operation, would fall under that duty.

Also, the Appropriations Clause gives Congress the power to decide how funds are spent, but it doesn't necessarily tie the President's hands on operational decisions unless there's a specific statute. Since there's no statute requiring five days, the President might have the authority to adjust operations as needed.

Looking at the options, option D says yes because it relates to the management of the executive branch and isn't prohibited by any statute. That makes sense because the President's order doesn't violate any existing law; it's more about internal management.

Option C suggests plenary authority, which I'm not sure about. Plenary means complete and absolute, but I think the President's authority is broad but not without limits. So maybe D is better because it's more about the absence of a prohibition.

Option B says no because Congress assumed five days, but without a statutory requirement, that assumption doesn't bind the President. So B might not be correct.

Option A suggests agency heads have final responsibility, but the President is the head of the executive branch, so I think he can direct the agencies under his authority.

The President's order to reduce the operating hours of federal executive agencies is constitutional. The Constitution vests the President with the authority to manage the executive branch under the Take Care Clause, which requires faithfully executing the laws. While Congress has the power of appropriation, it did not include a specific statutory requirement for agencies to operate five days a week. The President's order does not violate any statute and falls within the scope of managing the executive branch. Therefore, the order is permissible as it relates to internal management and is not prohibited by law.
