Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an airplane propeller's motion. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about finding the steady state motion when there are driving and frictional torques acting on it. Alright, I've studied torque and rotational motion before, so I'll try to remember the relevant equations.

The problem gives me the driving torque N as N0 times (1 + alpha cos omega0 t). And the frictional torque Nf is -b theta dot, right? So the net torque is the sum of these two. Wait, no, the equation of motion is torque equals I times angular acceleration. So the equation should be I d²theta/dt² = N - Nf. Wait, no, because torque is the sum, so I think it's I d²theta/dt² = N - Nf. But Nf is given as -b theta dot. So putting it all together:

I * (d²θ/dt²) = N0(1 + alpha cos omega0 t) - b (dθ/dt).

So the differential equation is I θ''(t) + b θ'(t) = N0 (1 + alpha cos(omega0 t)).

I remember that this is a second-order linear differential equation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. But the question specifically asks for the steady-state motion, which I think refers to the particular solution, the long-term behavior after transients have died out.

So I need to find the steady-state solution theta_p(t). Let's break down the right-hand side into two parts: the constant term N0 and the oscillatory term N0 alpha cos(omega0 t).

For the constant term, the equation becomes I θ'' + b θ' = N0. Since the right-hand side is a constant, the solution for this part is a linear function in time. Let's say theta_1(t) = C t + D. Then theta_1' = C, theta_1'' = 0. Plugging into the equation: 0 + b C = N0 → C = N0 / b. So the steady-state from the constant term is (N0/b) t + D, where D is a constant.

Now for the oscillatory part: N0 alpha cos(omega0 t). The equation is I θ'' + b θ' = N0 alpha cos(omega0 t). To solve this, I'll use the method of undetermined coefficients. Assume a particular solution of the form theta_2(t) = A cos(omega0 t) + B sin(omega0 t).

Compute theta_2': -A omega0 sin(omega0 t) + B omega0 cos(omega0 t).
Compute theta_2'': -A omega0² cos(omega0 t) - B omega0² sin(omega0 t).

Substitute into the equation:

I (-A omega0² cos - B omega0² sin) + b (-A omega0 sin + B omega0 cos) = N0 alpha cos(omega0 t).

Let me collect terms for cos and sin:

For cos(omega0 t):
(-I A omega0²) + (b B omega0) ) = N0 alpha.

For sin(omega0 t):
(-I B omega0²) + (-b A omega0) ) = 0.

So I have two equations:

1. (-I A omega0²) + (b B omega0) = N0 alpha.
2. (-I B omega0²) - (b A omega0) = 0.

Let me solve equation 2 for B in terms of A.

From equation 2:
- I B omega0² = b A omega0 → B = - (b A omega0) / (I omega0²) ) → B = - (b A)/(I omega0).

Now plug B into equation 1:

- I A omega0² + b [ (-b A)/(I omega0) ) ] * omega0 = N0 alpha.

Simplify each term:

First term: - I A omega0².

Second term: b * (-b A / (I omega0 )) * omega0 → - b² A / I.

So equation becomes:

- I A omega0² - (b² A)/I = N0 alpha.

Factor out A:

A [ - I omega0² - (b² / I) ] = N0 alpha.

Combine terms:

A [ - (I² omega0² + b² ) / I ] = N0 alpha.

Multiply both sides by I:

A ( - (I² omega0² + b² ) ) = N0 alpha I.

So A = [ - N0 alpha I ] / (I² omega0² + b²).

Wait, let me double-check that. Let me re-express the equation:

- I A omega0² - (b² A)/I = N0 alpha.

Multiply both sides by I to eliminate denominators:

- I² A omega0² - b² A = I N0 alpha.

A ( - I² omega0² - b² ) = I N0 alpha.

So A = (I N0 alpha) / ( - (I² omega0² + b²) ) → A = - (I N0 alpha) / (I² omega0² + b²).

Wait, no, because the denominator is negative. So,

A = - [ I N0 alpha ] / (I² omega0² + b²).

Wait, let me make sure.

After multiplying by I:

- I^2 A omega0² - b² A = I N0 alpha,

Factor A:

A ( - I^2 omega0² - b² ) = I N0 alpha → A = [ I N0 alpha ] / ( - (I^2 omega0² + b^2) ) → A = - [ I N0 alpha ] / (I^2 omega0² + b²).

Okay, now B is from earlier, B = - (b A)/(I omega0).

Substituting A:

B = - [ b * (- I N0 alpha ) / (I^2 omega0² + b²) ) ] / (I omega0 )

Simplify numerator:

b * I N0 alpha → denominator: (I^2 omega0² + b^2) * I omega0.

So B = [ b I N0 alpha ] / [ (I^2 omega0² + b^2) * I omega0 ) ]

Simplify:

The I in the numerator cancels with the I in the denominator:

→ B = (b N0 alpha ) / [ (I^2 omega0² + b^2 ) * omega0 ) ].

So B = [ b N0 alpha ] / [ omega0 (I^2 omega0² + b^2) ) ].

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as [ (b N0 alpha ) ] / [ I² omega0^3 + b² omega0 ) ].

Wait, because I^2 omega0^2 * omega0 is I^2 omega0^3, and b^2 * omega0 is b^2 omega0, so yeah, denominator is I² omega0^3 + b² omega0.

But for B, that's correct.

So now theta_2(t) = A cos(omega0 t) + B sin(omega0 t).

Substituting A and B:

theta_2(t) = [ - I N0 alpha / (I² omega0² + b²) ) ] cos(omega0 t) + [ b N0 alpha / (I² omega0^3 + b² omega0) ) ] sin(omega0 t).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out some terms. Let me factor N0 alpha / (I^2 omega0^3 + b^2 omega0) )

Wait, let's see. I^2 omega0^3 + b^2 omega0 = omega0 (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2).

So the denominator for B is omega0 (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2).

So B can be written as (b N0 alpha) / [ omega0 (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2) ) ].

Similarly, A is [ - I N0 alpha ] / (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2).

So I can factor out [ N0 alpha / (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2) ) ].

So theta_2(t) = [ N0 alpha / (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2) ) ] [ - I cos(omega0 t) + (b / omega0 ) sin(omega0 t) ].

Wait, let me check that. Because A is [ - I N0 alpha ] / (denom), and B is [ b N0 alpha ] / (omega0 denom ). So when factor out N0 alpha / denom, where denom is I^2 omega0^2 + b^2:

theta_2(t) = (N0 alpha / denom) [ -I cos(omega0 t) + (b / omega0 ) sin(omega0 t) ].

Alternatively, factor out 1/omega0:

= (N0 alpha / denom) [ -I cos + (b/omega0) sin ].

So putting it all together, the steady-state solution is the sum of theta_1 and theta_2:

theta_ss = (N0 / b) t + D + [ terms from theta_2 ].

Wait, but D is a constant, and in steady-state, the transient terms have decayed, so the homogeneous solution (which would involve exponentials) isn't present. So D would just be the constant phase, which can be absorbed into the initial condition theta_0. So the full steady-state solution is:

theta(t) = theta_0 + (N0 / b) t + [alpha N0 / (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2)] [ -I cos(omega0 t) + (b / omega0 ) sin(omega0 t) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, the expressions are a bit different. Let me see.

Looking at option B: (N0 /b ) t, and the amplitude terms. Let me see.

Option B: (alpha N0 ) / (I² omega0^3 + b^2 omega0 ) [ I omega0 cos(omega0 t) - b sin(omega0 t) ].

Wait, let's compute the denominator I² omega0^3 + b^2 omega0. That factors as omega0 (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2 ), same as what I have in the earlier expression.

So for the amplitude, the term in the square brackets in option B is [ I omega0 cos - b sin ].

In my expression, the term is [ -I cos + (b/omega0) sin ].

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs or factors.

Wait, let's go back to the solution for theta_2(t). I have:

theta_2 = A cos(omega0 t) + B sin(omega0 t),

where A = - I N0 alpha / (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2),

and B = [b N0 alpha ] / [omega0 (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2)].

So theta_2 can be written as:

theta_2 = [ -I N0 alpha / (denom) ] cos + [ (b N0 alpha) / (omega0 denom) ] sin,

where denom = I^2 omega0^2 + b^2.

So I can factor out N0 alpha / denom:

theta_2 = (N0 alpha / denom) [ -I cos + (b / omega0 ) sin ].

Alternatively, factor out 1/omega0:

theta_2 = (N0 alpha / denom) [ (-I omega0 cos ) + b sin ] / omega0.

Wait, because (b / omega0 ) sin = (b sin ) / omega0.

So,

theta_2 = (N0 alpha ) / (omega0 denom) [ -I omega0 cos(omega0 t) + b sin(omega0 t) ].

Because denom is I^2 omega0^2 + b^2, which equals omega0^2 (I^2) + b^2. So,

omega0 denom = omega0 (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2 ) = I^2 omega0^3 + b^2 omega0.

So,

theta_2 = (N0 alpha ) [ -I omega0 cos + b sin ] / (omega0 (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2 )) )

= (alpha N0 ) [ -I omega0 cos + b sin ] / (I^2 omega0^3 + b^2 omega0 )

Which can be written as:

(alpha N0 ) [ b sin - I omega0 cos ] / (I^2 omega0^3 + b^2 omega0 )

Looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option B: [alpha N0 / (I² omega0^3 + b^2 omega0 ) ] [I omega0 cos - b sin ]

Hmm, the numerator in option B is I omega0 cos - b sin, which is the negative of what I have in theta_2. So my theta_2 has [ b sin - I omega0 cos ] which is the negative of option B's bracket.

Wait, but let me think about the torque equation. Did I get the signs right?

The net torque equation is I theta'' + b theta' = N0 (1 + alpha cos(omega0 t)).

So when I set up the particular solution, I used that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, in the equation after substituting theta_2 into the equation, I got:

For cos terms: (-I A omega0^2) + (b B omega0) = N0 alpha.

For sin terms: (-I B omega0^2) - (b A omega0) = 0.

In solving equation 2, I found B = - (b A) / (I omega0 ).

If I substitute B into equation 1, perhaps I should check that again.

Equation 1: (-I A omega0^2 ) + (b B omega0 ) = N0 alpha.

Substituting B:

= -I A omega0^2 + b [ (-b A)/(I omega0) ) ] omega0.

= -I A omega0^2 - (b^2 A)/I.

So,

A ( -I omega0^2 - b^2 / I ) = N0 alpha.

Which, when multiplied by I:

A (- I^2 omega0^2 - b^2 ) = I N0 alpha.

So,

A = (I N0 alpha ) / ( - (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2 ) )

So A is negative.

So theta_2(t) is A cos + B sin.

Which gives terms with -I cos and (b / omega0 ) sin, which I later expressed as [ b sin - I omega0 cos ].

So the coefficient for cos is negative, and sin is positive.

In option B, the coefficient is [ I omega0 cos - b sin ], which is opposite in sign. So perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, maybe I should have considered the torque equation correctly. Let me double-check the torque equation.

The net torque is sum of driving and frictional: N_net = N - N_f.

But N_f is given as -b theta_dot, so N_net = N0(1 + alpha cos) - (-b theta_dot )? Wait, no: N_net is N - N_f, and N_f is -b theta_dot. So,

N_net = N0(1 + alpha cos) - ( -b theta_dot ) → N0(1 + alpha cos) + b theta_dot.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because torque is the sum of all torques, which would be N (driving) minus N_f (frictional). So N_net = N - N_f. Since N_f is given as -b theta_dot, then N_net = N - (-b theta_dot ) → N + b theta_dot.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, frictional torque opposes the motion, so N_f = -b theta_dot. So when you add the torques: N_net = N_driving + N_f → N0(1 + alpha cos) + (-b theta_dot ), because N_f is negative when theta_dot is positive.

Wait, that's correct. So the equation is I theta'' = N0(1 + alpha cos) - b theta_dot.

So the equation is I theta'' + b theta' = N0 (1 + alpha cos).

Hmm, that's correct.

So when I set up the equation for theta_2, I think the signs are handled properly.

But going back, perhaps when solving for A and B, I should have written the equation correctly. Let me recheck.

After substituting theta_2 into the equation, I get:

I (-A omega0^2 cos - B omega0^2 sin ) + b (-A omega0 sin + B omega0 cos ) = N0 alpha cos.

So, grouping terms:

cos terms: (-I A omega0^2 ) + (b B omega0 )

sin terms: (-I B omega0^2 ) + (-b A omega0 )

So the equations are:

1. (-I A omega0^2 ) + (b B omega0 ) = N0 alpha.

2. (-I B omega0^2 ) - (b A omega0 ) = 0.

From equation 2, solving for B:

- I B omega0^2 = b A omega0 → B = - (b A) / (I omega0 ).

Substituting into equation 1:

- I A omega0^2 + b ( (-b A) / (I omega0 ) ) * omega0 = N0 alpha.

Simplify:

- I A omega0^2 - (b^2 A ) / I = N0 alpha.

Multiply by I:

- I^2 A omega0^2 - b^2 A = I N0 alpha.

Factor:

A (-I^2 omega0^2 - b^2 ) = I N0 alpha.

So A = [ I N0 alpha ] / ( - (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2 ) )

So A = - [ I N0 alpha ] / (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2 )

Then B = - (b A ) / (I omega0 ) → substituting A:

B = - [ b * (- I N0 alpha ) ] / [ I omega0 (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2 ) ]

Simplify:

B = ( b I N0 alpha ) / [ I omega0 (I^2 omega0^2 + b^2 ) ) ]

Cancel I:

B = ( b N0 alpha ) / [ omega0 (
