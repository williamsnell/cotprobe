Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the initial value and slope of the function f(t) = e^(-2t) u(t). They want me to do this two ways: first by letting t approach 0 from the positive side, and then using the initial-value theorem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the function is given as f(t) = e^(-2t) multiplied by the unit step function u(t). I remember that the unit step u(t) is 0 for t < 0 and 1 for t ≥ 0. So for t > 0, f(t) is just e^(-2t), but at t=0, it's e^0 which is 1. Wait, but what happens exactly at t=0? Oh right, the function is right-continuous, so f(0) should be 1. But wait, when finding the initial value, sometimes it's about the limit as t approaches from the right, which would be the same as f(0) here.

Wait no, initial value is usually the value of the function just after t=0, so that's t approaching 0 from the positive side. So for f(t), as t approaches 0+, e^(-2t) approaches e^0 which is 1, and since u(t) is 1 there, f(t) approaches 1. So the initial value is 1. Got that part.

Now, the slope. The slope is the derivative of f(t) evaluated at t=0+. Let's compute the derivative of f(t). The derivative of e^(-2t) is -2e^(-2t), right? So f'(t) = -2e^(-2t) u(t) + e^(-2t) * δ(t), because when you take the derivative of u(t), you get the Dirac delta function δ(t). Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, the derivative of u(t) is δ(t), but when you have a product, the product rule applies. So f(t) = e^(-2t) u(t), so f'(t) = derivative of e^(-2t) * u(t) + e^(-2t) * derivative of u(t). The derivative of e^(-2t) is -2e^(-2t), so that's -2e^(-2t) u(t) plus e^(-2t) δ(t).

But wait, when evaluating at t=0 from the right, u(t) is 1, and δ(t) is zero except at t=0. But when t approaches 0 from the right, δ(t) would be considered as acting on functions, but maybe for the initial slope, we're just taking the value of f'(t) as t approaches 0 from the right, which would be dominated by the term without the delta function.

So f'(0+) would be lim t→0+ of [-2e^(-2t) * 1 + e^(-2t) δ(t)]. Wait, but as t approaches 0, the delta function is a distribution, maybe it's better to think in terms of limits without involving delta. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of f(t) as e^(-2t) for t≥0, so the derivative for t>0 is just -2e^(-2t). So at t=0, f'(0) is -2e^(0) which is -2. So the slope is -2.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because another approach is to compute the initial value using the initial-value theorem from Laplace transforms. The initial-value theorem states that the initial value of f(t) is lim_{s→∞} s F(s), where F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t).

So let's compute F(s) first. The Laplace transform of e^(-2t) u(t) is 1/(s + 2). So F(s) = 1/(s + 2). Then, the initial value is lim_{s→∞} s * [1/(s + 2)] = lim s→∞ (s)/(s + 2) = 1. That matches what I found earlier. So initial value is 1.

Now, for the slope, which is f'(0+). There's another theorem, the derivative theorem, which says that the Laplace transform of f'(t) is s F(s) - f(0). But to find f'(0), maybe I can use the inverse Laplace transform approach or another theorem. Wait, there's also the initial-value theorem for the first derivative, which states that lim_{t→0+} f'(t) = lim_{s→∞} s^2 F(s) - s f(0).

Wait, let me think again. The initial-value theorem for the nth derivative says that lim_{t→0+} f^{(n)}(t) = lim_{s→∞} s^n F(s) - ... (terms involving lower derivatives). For n=1, it's lim_{s→∞} s^2 F(s) - s f(0) - f'(0). Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the initial value of the first derivative is lim_{s→∞} s F(s) - f(0). Wait, I'm confusing. Let me be precise.

The initial-value theorem for the first derivative: the limit as t approaches 0 from the right of f'(t) equals the limit as s approaches infinity of s^2 F(s) minus s f(0) minus f'(0). Wait, maybe I'm not remembering this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the initial value of the derivative is given by lim_{s→∞} s F(s) - f(0). Wait, that can't be right, because from the initial-value theorem, lim_{s→∞} s F(s) is f(0+), which is 1. So 1 - f(0)=0, which would be 1 -1=0. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The Laplace transform of f'(t) is s F(s) - f(0). So if I'm looking for the initial value of f'(t), which is f'(0+), then perhaps it's the limit as t approaches 0 from the right of f'(t) equals the limit as s approaches infinity of s [s F(s) - f(0)].

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe using the inverse Laplace transform of s F(s) - f(0) to find f'(t). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead compute the derivative directly. As t approaches 0 from the right, f'(t) approaches -2e^0 = -2, so the slope is -2.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up the initial value and the initial slope. The initial value is f(0+) = 1. The slope is f'(0+) which is -2.

So looking at the options, I need an option where initial value is 1 and slope is -2. Let me check the options:

Looking back:

Option A: Initial 2, slope -4 → No.

Option B: Initial -1, slope 2 → No.

Option C: Initial 1, slope 2 → No, slope should be -2.

Option D: Initial 0, slope undefined → No.

Option E: Initial 0, slope 2 → No.

Option F: Initial -1, slope -2 → No, initial is wrong.

Option G: Initial 0, slope -2 → No.

Option H: Initial 1, slope undefined → No, slope is -2.

Option I: Initial 0.5, slope -1 → No.

Option J: Initial 1, slope -2 → Yes! That's what I got.

So the correct answer should be option J.

To determine the initial value and slope of the function \( f(t) = e^{-2t} u(t) \), we analyze it as follows:

1. **Initial Value**:  
   The initial value is the value of the function as \( t \to 0^+ \). Since \( u(t) \) is the unit step function, \( u(t) = 1 \) for \( t \geq 0 \). Thus, \( f(t) = e^{-2t} \) for \( t \geq 0 \), and as \( t \to 0^+ \), \( e^{-2t} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, the initial value is \( 1 \).

2. **Slope**:  
   The slope is the derivative of \( f(t) \) evaluated at \( t = 0^+ \). Differentiating \( f(t) = e^{-2t} u(t) \), we use the product rule:  
   \[
   f'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( e^{-2t} \right) u(t) + e^{-2t} \frac{d}{dt} \left( u(t) \right).
   \]  
   For \( t > 0 \), \( \frac{d}{dt} \left( e^{-2t} \right) = -2e^{-2t} \) and \( \frac{d}{dt} \left( u(t) \right) = 0 \). Thus, \( f'(t) = -2e^{-2t} \). At \( t = 0^+ \), \( f'(0^+) = -2e^0 = -2 \). Therefore, the slope is \( -2 \).

3. **Verification Using the Initial-Value Theorem**:  
   The initial-value theorem states that the initial value of \( f(t) \) is \( \lim_{s \to \infty} s F(s) \), where \( F(s) \) is the Laplace transform of \( f(t) \). The Laplace transform of \( e^{-2t} u(t) \) is \( F(s) = \frac{1}{s + 2} \).  
   \[
   \lim_{s \to \infty} s F(s) = \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{s}{s + 2} = 1.
   \]  
   This confirms the initial value is \( 1 \).  

   For the slope, the initial-value theorem for the first derivative states that \( \lim_{t \to 0^+} f'(t) = \lim_{s \to \infty} s^2 F(s) - s f(0) \). Substituting \( F(s) = \frac{1}{s + 2} \) and \( f(0) = 1 \):  
   \[
   \lim_{s \to \infty} s^2 \frac{1}{s + 2} - s \cdot 1 = \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{s^2}{s + 2} - s = \lim_{s \to \infty} s - 2 - s = -2.
   \]  
   This confirms the slope is \( -2 \).

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   From the analysis, the initial value is \( 1 \) and the slope is \( -2 \). The correct option is **J**.
