Question:

What role does factor analysis play in the description of intelligence ?

Options:

A: Factor analysis is used solely for educational placement decisions.
B: Factor analysis categorizes intelligence into fixed levels of ability.
C: Factor analysis is irrelevant in the study of intelligence.
D: Factor analysis is used to determine the genetic basis of intelligence.
E: Factor analysis is used to measure IQ directly.
F: Factor analysis is a tool for creating intelligence enhancement programs.
G: Factor analysis is used to identify underlying intellectual traits and establish descriptive categories in intelligence.
H: Factor analysis is used to establish the exact number of intelligence types.
I: Factor analysis is applied to predict academic performance from intelligence scores.
J: Factor analysis is employed to assess the influence of environment on intelligence development.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about factor analysis and its role in describing intelligence. Hmm, I remember that factor analysis is a statistical method used in psychology, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

So, the question is asking what role factor analysis plays. The options are A to J. I think I should start by recalling what factor analysis does. From what I remember, factor analysis is used to identify underlying factors that explain correlations between different variables. So like, if you have a bunch of test scores that are all correlated with each other, factor analysis might find that they all relate to an underlying factor like "intelligence."

Wait, I think it's been used in the study of intelligence to find these underlying traits. Like, maybe it's used to group different abilities into categories or factors. Oh right, I think Charles Spearman used it for his theory of general intelligence, g factor. He found that various mental tasks were correlated, and factor analysis helped him identify this common factor.

So looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it's used solely for educational placement. That doesn't sound right. I don't think factor analysis is only for that; it's more about identifying underlying factors, not direct application like placement.

Option B: Categorizes intelligence into fixed levels. Hmm, fixed levels might not be accurate. Factor analysis identifies factors, but whether they are fixed or not depends on the theory. Maybe not the best fit.

Option C: Irrelevant. No, definitely not. Factor analysis has been central in intelligence research.

Option D: Genetic basis. I don't think factor analysis determines genetics. It's more about structure, not causes like genetics.

Option E: Measure IQ directly. No, IQ is measured through tests, not factor analysis itself. Factor analysis is used on the test results.

Option F: Creating enhancement programs. Doesn't ring a bell. Maybe other methods are used for that.

Option G: Identify underlying traits and establish categories. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. It helps find the underlying factors and categorize them.

Option H: Exact number of intelligence types. Wait, I remember debates about how many intelligences there are, like Gardner's multiple intelligences. But factor analysis might not establish the exact number; it's more about finding common factors among tests.

Option I: Predict academic performance. That's more about using the intelligence scores, perhaps, but not directly what factor analysis does.

Option J: Assess environmental influence. That's more about studies on heritability and environment, not the primary use of factor analysis.

So the best fit seems to be option G. Factor analysis is used to identify underlying intellectual traits and establish descriptive categories in intelligence.

Factor analysis is a statistical method used to identify underlying factors that explain correlations among variables. In the context of intelligence, it has been instrumental in identifying common factors, such as Spearman's general intelligence factor (g), which underpins correlations across various mental tasks. This technique helps in categorizing intelligence into descriptive categories rather than determining fixed levels, genetic bases, or direct measurements like IQ. It is not primarily used for educational placement, predicting academic performance, or assessing environmental influences. Instead, its key role is in uncovering latent intellectual traits and organizing them into meaningful categories.

The correct answer is **G: Factor analysis is used to identify underlying intellectual traits and establish descriptive categories in intelligence.**

Answer: G
