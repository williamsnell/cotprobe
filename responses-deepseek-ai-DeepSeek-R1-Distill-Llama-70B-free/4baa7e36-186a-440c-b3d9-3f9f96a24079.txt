Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find a recursion equation for y[n], which is the sum of the squares of all integers from 0 to n. Hmm, recursion equations relate y[n] to previous terms, right? So I should think about how y[n] is built up from smaller values.

Let me start by understanding what y[n] actually is. The sum of squares from 0 to n would be 0² + 1² + 2² + ... + n². I remember there's a formula for this sum, which is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Oh wait, option B is exactly that. But the question is about a recursion equation, not the direct formula. So maybe B is the closed-form solution, and the question is asking for a recursive relation.

So recursion usually involves expressing y[n] in terms of y[n-1] or something like that. Let's think about how y[n] relates to y[n-1]. Well, y[n] is the sum up to n, which is the sum up to n-1 plus n squared. So y[n] = y[n-1] + n². Wait, but that's the forward relation. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options, I see that option F says y[n-1] = y[n] - n². That makes sense because if y[n] = y[n-1] + n², rearranging gives y[n-1] = y[n] - n². So F seems correct.

Wait, but let me check. For example, when n is 1, y[1] is 0² +1²=1. y[0] is 0²=0. So y[1-1] = y[1] -1² → y[0] = 1 -1 → 0=0, which is correct.

Another option is E. It says y[n+1] = 2y[n] + (n+1)^2. Hmm, that seems more complicated. Let me test that. Suppose n=0, y[0]=0. Then y[1] = 2*0 +1² =1, which is correct. For n=1, y[2] =2*1 +2²=2+4=6. Let's compute y[2] directly: 0+1+4=5. Wait, that's not 6. So E can't be correct because y[2] would be 5, but E gives 6. So E is wrong.

Option G says y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n -1. Wait, that's the recursion for the sum of the first n integers, not squares. Because sum 1 to n is n(n+1)/2, and the recursion would add 2n-1 each time. So G is for a different problem.

Option A has y[n-1] = y[n] +n². That would imply y[n] = y[n-1] -n², which is the opposite of what I want. So A is incorrect.

Option C: y[n-1] = y[n] *n². That seems off because multiplication doesn't fit here. The relation is additive, not multiplicative. So C is wrong.

Option D: y[n-1] = y[n]/n². Also doesn't make sense dimensionally. The sum should be larger when n increases, so dividing by n² would make y[n-1] possibly larger than y[n], which isn't the case. Unless n is 0, but y[0] is 0, and for n=1, y[1]=1, so y[0] would be 1/1=1, but that's not correct because y[0] is 0. So D is wrong.

Option H: y[n+1] = y[n] - (n+1)^2. That would mean each term is smaller than the previous, which can't be right because adding squares increases the sum. So H is incorrect.

So the only correct option is F: y[n-1] = y[n] -n², with y[0]=0. That makes sense because each step back subtracts the square of the current n.

To determine the correct recursion equation for \( y[n] \), where \( y[n] \) is the sum of the squares of all integers from 0 to \( n \), we start by noting that \( y[n] = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + n^2 \). The recursion relation must express \( y[n] \) in terms of \( y[n-1] \) or similar terms.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: \( y[n-1] = y[n] + n^2 \)**  
   This implies \( y[n] = y[n-1] - n^2 \), which is incorrect because \( y[n] \) should be larger than \( y[n-1] \) as \( n \) increases.

2. **Option B: \( y[n] = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \)**  
   This is the closed-form formula for the sum of squares, not a recursion equation. It does not relate \( y[n] \) to previous terms, so it is not a valid recursion relation.

3. **Option C: \( y[n-1] = y[n] \cdot n^2 \)**  
   This suggests a multiplicative relationship, which is incorrect because the sum of squares follows an additive relationship.

4. **Option D: \( y[n-1] = \frac{y[n]}{n^2} \)**  
   Dividing by \( n^2 \) does not align with the additive nature of the sum of squares. This option is incorrect.

5. **Option E: \( y[n+1] = 2y[n] + (n+1)^2 \)**  
   Testing this with small values (e.g., \( n = 0 \)) shows inconsistencies with the actual sum of squares. For example, \( y[2] \) should be 5, but this equation gives 6. Thus, it is incorrect.

6. **Option F: \( y[n-1] = y[n] - n^2 \)**  
   This is consistent with the definition of \( y[n] \), as \( y[n] = y[n-1] + n^2 \). Rearranging gives \( y[n-1] = y[n] - n^2 \), which matches the recursion. Testing with small values confirms its validity.

7. **Option G: \( y[n] = y[n-1] + 2n - 1 \)**  
   This recursion corresponds to the sum of the first \( n \) integers, not the sum of squares. It is incorrect for this problem.

8. **Option H: \( y[n+1] = y[n] - (n+1)^2 \)**  
   This implies that \( y[n+1] \) is smaller than \( y[n] \), which contradicts the fact that the sum of squares increases with \( n \). Thus, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct recursion equation is given by **Option F: \( y[n-1] = y[n] - n^2 \)**, with \( y[0] = 0 \). This aligns with the definition of \( y[n] \) as the sum of squares and passes tests with small values.
