Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the cost of linoleum for a kitchen floor. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the kitchen's new dimensions are 7'6" by 11'8". Wait, I remember that when dealing with feet and inches, I should convert everything to the same unit to make calculations easier. Let me convert those mixed numbers into just feet or inches. 

Wait, the problem says that the linoleum is sold in 6-foot width. So maybe I should think in terms of area. Oh right, because the cost is per running foot, which I think means per linear foot, but the width is fixed at 6 feet. So the area covered per foot would be 6 feet wide by 1 foot long, which is 6 square feet per running foot. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the selling unit is per running foot of 6-foot width. So each running foot is 6 ft by 1 ft, which is 6 square feet. So the cost is $1.79 per square foot? No, wait, no. Wait, the price is $1.79 per running foot. So each linear foot you buy is 6 feet wide. So for each foot you buy, you get 6 ft² of linoleum.

So first, I need to find the area of the kitchen floor. The floor is 7'6" by 11'8". Let me convert those to inches to make it easier. 7 feet is 84 inches, so 7'6" is 84 +6 =90 inches. 11 feet is 132 inches, so 11'8" is 132 +8=140 inches. Now, area is length × width, so 90 inches ×140 inches. Let me calculate that: 90 *140 = 12,600 square inches. But wait, since 1 square foot is 144 square inches, I need to convert that to square feet. So 12,600 /144 = let's see, 12,600 ÷144. Let me do the division: 144 * 87 is 12,528 (because 144*80=11,520; 144*7=1,008 → 11,520+1,008=12,528). 12,600-12,528 is 72. So that's 87 + (72/144) = 87.5 square feet. So the area is 87.5 square feet.

Now, the linoleum is sold in 6-foot width rolls, and you buy it by the running foot. So each running foot gives you 6 square feet (since 6ft wide ×1ft long is 6ft²). Wait, no, wait: 6ft ×1ft is 6 square feet, yes. So the number of running feet needed is the total area divided by 6. So 87.5 /6 = approximately 14.5833 running feet. But you can't buy a fraction of a foot, so you'd need to round up to 15 feet. Wait, wait, but wait, the way the problem states, each running foot is 6ft wide. So the total area is 87.5ft², and each running foot gives you 6ft². So 87.5 /6 =14.583..., so 15 running feet. So the cost would be 15 * $1.79. Let me calculate that: 15 *1.79. 10 *1.79 is 17.9, 5*1.79 is 8.95 → total 26.85. So $26.85. Looking at the options, B is $26.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait a second, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. Let me recalculate the kitchen area. 7'6" is 7.5 feet, and 11'8" is 11.666... feet. So 7.5 *11.6666667. Let me compute that. 7 *11 is 77, 7 *0.6666667 is about 4.6666667, 0.5 *11 is 5.5, 0.5 *0.6666667 is 0.3333333. Adding those up: 77 +4.6666667 =81.6666667 +5.5=87.1666667 +0.3333333=87.5 square feet. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about how the linoleum is applied. The kitchen is 7.5 ft by 11.666667 ft. The linoleum is 6 ft wide. So the length needed would depend on how it's laid. Let me think: if the linoleum is 6 ft wide, then how many strips do I need? The width of the kitchen is 7.5 ft. So each strip is 6 ft wide, so the first strip covers 6 ft of the 7.5 ft width, leaving 1.5 ft. So you need a second strip to cover the remaining 1.5 ft. So you would need two runs: one 6 ft wide and one 1.5 ft wide. But wait, the linoleum is sold in 6 ft width, so you can't buy a narrower strip. So perhaps you have to buy two full 6 ft wide rolls, but that would give more material than needed. Wait, but wait, perhaps each running foot is 6 ft wide, meaning that the total area per running foot is 6 ft², as I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the way to calculate is to find how many linear feet of 6 ft wide material you need to cover the area. So area is 87.5 ft². Each running foot gives 6 ft², so you need 87.5 /6 =14.5833 ft. So you have to buy 15 ft. So 15 *1.79=26.85, which is option B.

Another way to approach: think about the dimensions. The kitchen is 7.5 ft by 11.666667 ft. The linoleum is 6 ft wide, so if you lay it along the 11.666667 ft length, each strip would cover 6 ft of the 7.5 ft width. So you need two strips: one 6 ft wide, and another 1.5 ft wide. But you can't buy 1.5 ft wide, so you have to buy another 6 ft wide strip, but only use part of it. So each strip is as long as the length of the kitchen, which is 11.666667 ft. So the first strip would be 6 ft wide ×11.666667 ft long, area is 6*11.666667≈70 ft². The second strip would cover 1.5 ft ×11.666667 ft, area≈17.5 ft². But you can't buy a 1.5 ft wide strip, so you have to buy a 6 ft wide strip for the second part as well. So the total material needed is 6 ft ×11.666667 ft (two of them). So total length needed is 2 ×11.666667≈23.333334 ft. So each running foot is 6 ft wide, so you need 23.333334 ft of it. So cost is 23.333334 ×1.79 ≈ let's calculate that. 23 *1.79=41.37, 0.333334 *1.79≈0.596, total ≈41.966. So about $41.97. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, that's conflicting with the previous approach. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in this second approach. Because in this case, the first method was to calculate the total area and then find how much material you need, whereas the second approach is considering the layout. But perhaps the second approach is wrong because you don't need to buy two full rolls. Let me think again.

Wait, when you buy the linoleum, you can buy it by the running foot. So each running foot is 6 ft wide. So if you have to cover 7.5 ft in width, you can buy two strips: the first is 6 ft wide × length L, and the second is 1.5 ft wide × length L. But since the store sells it in 6 ft wide rolls, you can't buy 1.5 ft wide. So you have to buy another 6 ft wide strip, but you'll only use 1.5 ft of its width. So the total length of each strip is the length of the kitchen, which is 11.666667 ft.

So for the first strip, you need 11.666667 ft of 6 ft wide. The second strip, you need 11.666667 ft of 6 ft wide, but you'll only use 1.5 ft of the 6 ft width. So the total material needed is 2 ×11.666667 ft =23.333334 ft. So each running foot is 6 ft wide, so you need 23.333334 running feet. So cost is 23.333334 ×1.79 = approx 23.333334 ×1.79. Let's compute that.

23 ×1.79=41.37.

0.333334 ×1.79≈0.596.

So total is 41.37 +0.596≈41.966, which is about $41.97. But looking at the options, D is $42.56, which is close but not exact. Hmm, but this approach gives a higher cost than the first method. So which is correct?

Wait, maybe the first approach is correct because the total area is 87.5 ft², and each running foot gives 6 ft², so 87.5/6≈14.5833, so 15 ft needed, costing 26.85. That seems lower. So why is there a discrepancy between the two methods?

Ah, I think I'm confusing the way the material is sold. The first approach treats it as buying material by area, but the second approach considers the actual layout and how much you need to buy, which may require more material because you can't buy partial widths. So which approach is correct in this context?

Wait, the problem states that the linoleum sells for $1.79 per running foot in 6' width. So when you buy a running foot, you get 6 ft wide ×1 ft long. So the area per running foot is 6 ft². So the total area needed is 87.5 ft², so 87.5 /6 =14.5833 running feet. Since you can't buy a fraction, you round up to 15. So cost is 15 ×1.79=26.85, which is option B.

But wait, in reality, when you lay the material, you might have to buy more because of the way it's applied. But perhaps the question assumes that you can perfectly fit the material without waste, so the area method is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to calculate based on the actual dimensions. Let me think again: the kitchen is 7.5 ft by 11.666667 ft.

If the linoleum is 6 ft wide, then the number of strips needed is the ceiling of (7.5 /6) = 2 strips. Each strip is as long as the length of the kitchen, 11.666667 ft. So total running feet needed is 2 ×11.666667≈23.3333 ft. So cost is 23.3333 ×1.79≈41.966, which is about $42, but the options don't have that except for D:42.56. Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

23.3333333 ×1.79. Let me compute 23 ×1.79 =41.37. 0.3333333 ×1.79= (1/3)*1.79≈0.5966667. So total is 41.37 +0.5966667≈41.9666667, which is approximately $41.97. The closest option is D: $42.56, which is higher. Hmm. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the exact value. Let me compute 23.3333333 ×1.79 exactly.

23.3333333 ×1.79:

Let me break it down: 1.79 =1 +0.7 +0.09.

23.3333333 ×1 =23.3333333.

23.3333333 ×0.7 =16.33333331.

23.3333333 ×0.09=2.1.

Adding them up: 23.3333333 +16.33333331=39.6666666 +2.1=41.7666666. So more accurately, it's approximately $41.77.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is the area method, giving $26.85, option B.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating because the running foot is per linear foot of 6 ft width, so when you buy N running feet, you get N ×6 ft². So the area needed is 87.5 ft², so N=87.5 /6≈14.5833 ft. So you need 15 ft, costing 15×1.79=26.85, option B.

But then why in the layout approach, it's giving a higher cost? Because in that case, you're accounting for the fact that you have to buy full widths, which might mean more material, but the question might be assuming that you can perfectly fit without waste, so the area method is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the area method, so the answer is B:26.85.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the floor is 7.5 ft by 11.666667 ft.

If you lay the linoleum along the 11.666667 ft length, each strip is 6 ft wide. So the number of strips needed is 7.5 /6=1.25 strips. But since you can't buy a quarter strip, you need 2 strips. Each strip is 11.666667 ft long, so total running feet is 2 ×11.666667≈23.333333 ft. So cost is 23.333333 ×1.79≈41.77, which isn't an option. The closest is D:42.56, but that's not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 23.333333 ×1.79 more precisely. Let's do it step by step.

23 ×1.79 = 23×1 +23×0.7 +23×0.09 =23 +16.1 +2.07=41.17.

0.3333333 ×1.79 ≈0.5966666.

So total is 41.17 +0.5966666≈41.7666666, which is $41.77. But none of the options match this exactly. So perhaps the correct approach is the area method, leading to option B, $26.85.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: "the linoleum sells for $1.79 per running foot in 6' width." So that means each linear foot purchased is 6 ft wide. So the area per running foot is 6 ft². So the total area needed is 87.5 ft², so you need 87.5 /6 =14.5833 running feet. So you have to buy 15 running feet. So 15 ×1.79=26.85, which is option B.

So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the cost of covering the kitchen floor with linoleum, we start by calculating the area of the floor. The dimensions are given as 7'6" × 11'8". Converting these to feet:

- **7'6"** = 7 + 6/12 = 7.5 feet  
- **11'8"** = 11 + 8/12 ≈ 11.6667 feet  

The area of the floor is:  
\[
\text{Area} = 7.5 \, \text{ft} \times 11.6667 \, \text{ft} = 87.5 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

The linoleum is sold at $1.79 per running foot, with a fixed width of 6 feet. This means that each running foot of linoleum covers:  
\[
6 \, \text{ft} \times 1 \, \text{ft} = 6 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

To cover the entire floor, the total number of running feet needed is:  
\[
\frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Area per Running Foot}} = \frac{87.5 \, \text{ft}^2}{6 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{foot}} \approx 14.5833 \, \text{feet}
\]

Since you cannot purchase a fraction of a foot, you must round up to the next whole number, which is **15 running feet**. The total cost is then:  
\[
\text{Cost} = 15 \, \text{feet} \times \$1.79/\text{foot} = \$26.85
\]

This calculation assumes that the linoleum can be perfectly fitted without waste, which aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the best way to cover the floor is to purchase 15 running feet of linoleum, and the total cost is **$26.85**.

The correct answer is **B**.  

**Answer: B**
