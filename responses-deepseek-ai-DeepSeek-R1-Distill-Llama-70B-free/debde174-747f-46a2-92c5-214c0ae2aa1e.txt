Okay, so I've got this question about Pluto and its satellites. Hmm, I remember that Pluto has some moons, but I'm not exactly sure how many or their sizes. Let me think.

I've heard that Pluto has a pretty well-known moon called Charon. I think Charon is the largest one. Then there are others, but I'm not certain about their sizes. Wait, aren't there like four or five moons in total? Or maybe it's just a few.

So the options are from A to J. The question is asking about the current best observations. I remember that as of recent data, Pluto has a certain number of satellites. Let me try to recall.

Charon is definitely the biggest. Then there's Nix and Hydra, I think. Oh, and maybe Kerberos and Styx as well. So that's five moons in total? Wait, but I'm not sure about how they classify their sizes.

Wait, the options don't go up to five. Let me look at the options again. Option E says one large and two small. Option I says one large and three small. Option A has two large, which I don't think is correct because Charon is the only large one. The others are much smaller.

So if Pluto has Charon (large), and then four others—Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, Styx. But wait, I'm not sure about their sizes. Are they all considered small? I think so because Charon is much bigger.

So that would be one large (Charon) and four small. But I don't see an option for that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: Option I is one large and three small. Option E is one large and two small. Hmm, maybe I'm misremembering the number of moons. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I might have confused Pluto's moons with another dwarf planet. Let me try to list them: Charon is the biggest, then Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. So that's five moons. But if the question is about the current best observations, maybe the count is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering only the more prominent ones. But I'm not sure. Wait, I think I've heard that Pluto has five known moons as of now. But looking at the options, none have five. So maybe the question is simplifying.

Alternatively, perhaps the count is different. Maybe it's that Pluto has one large and a few smaller ones. So from the options, E is one large and two small, I is one large and three. Wait, but I thought there are four small ones besides Charon.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. I think the correct answer is that Pluto has one large satellite (Charon) and four smaller ones. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is E: one large and two small. Or maybe I'm forgetting something.

Wait, another angle: the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So I need to pick the correct option based on what I know.

I think the correct number as of recent data is that Pluto has five moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. So that's one large and four small. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is outdated, or the options are simplified.

Wait, looking back at the options, option E is one large and two small. Option I is one large and three small. None match five. But perhaps the correct answer is E or I. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about the count.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's one large and four small, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is E: one large and two small, considering maybe only the two more prominent small moons. Or perhaps I'm wrong about the number.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the question refers to moons that are confirmed and well-known. For a long time, Pluto was known to have Charon and then in 2005, two more were discovered: Nix and Hydra. Then later, Kerberos and Styx. So perhaps the current count is five, but the options don't reflect that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A: two large and one small. No, only Charon is large.

B: one medium and two small. Not sure.

C: one large and one small. No, there are more.

D: no satellites. No.

E: one large and two small. Maybe if considering only the initial two after Charon.

F: four small. No, because there's Charon.

G: three medium. No.

H: two medium. No.

I: one large and three small. That would be Charon plus three others.

J: one large. No, because there are more.

So if there are four small besides Charon, but the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is E or I.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: one large and two small. But I thought there are more. Alternatively, maybe the answer is I: one large and three small.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall: as of 2023, Pluto has five known moons. So if the options are from a time when only three were known, maybe the answer was different.

But the question says "current best observations," so it should be up to date. So perhaps the answer is that Pluto has one large and four small, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is E: one large and two small, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: one large and two small, considering that Kerberos and Styx are very small and perhaps not counted in the options.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the best answer is E: one large and two small. Or maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, another approach: I'll try to remember from what I've studied. Pluto's moons are Charon (large), Nix, Hydra (discovered in 2005), Kerberos (2011), and Styx (2012). So that's five moons. So one large and four small. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question is outdated.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering only the ones that are more significant. But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: one large and two small. Because maybe the other two are considered too small to count, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: one large and three small. Because maybe the count is four total, including Charon.

Wait, no, Charon is one, plus four small makes five. So if the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The most well-known moons are Charon, Nix, and Hydra. So that's one large and two small. So the answer would be E.

Alternatively, if the question includes all five, but the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is E.

I think I'll go with E: one large and two small satellites.

The question asks about the current best observations of Pluto's satellites. Pluto is known to have five moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. Charon is the largest moon, while the others are smaller. However, the options provided do not include the possibility of one large and four small satellites. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Two large and one small — Incorrect, as only Charon is large.
- **B**: One medium and two small — Incorrect, as there is no medium-sized satellite.
- **C**: One large and one small — Incorrect, as there are more than two moons.
- **D**: No satellites — Incorrect, as Pluto has multiple moons.
- **E**: One large and two small — Plausible, as it could refer to Charon and the two most prominent smaller moons, Nix and Hydra.
- **F**: Four small — Incorrect, as it excludes Charon.
- **G**: Three medium-sized — Incorrect, as there are no medium-sized moons.
- **H**: Two medium-sized — Incorrect, for the same reason as G.
- **I**: One large and three small — Could also be plausible, as it might include Charon and three smaller moons.
- **J**: One large — Incorrect, as Pluto has more than one moon.

Given the options, the most reasonable answers are **E** or **I**, depending on whether the question considers all four smaller moons or only the most prominent ones. Since the question asks for the "current best observations," which include all five moons, but the options do not account for four small moons, the best choice is **E**: one large and two small satellites, assuming the question simplifies the count.

Answer: E
