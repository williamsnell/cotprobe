Okay, so I've got this question about Nixon and his resignation. The question is asking how many people believed he should be removed from office before he resigned. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

Hmm, I remember that Nixon resigned because of the Watergate scandal. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. I think his approval ratings were really low towards the end. But the question is specifically about the percentage who thought he should be removed, not just his approval rating.

Wait, I think there were polls taken back then. I recall that by the summer of 1974, support for Nixon was plummeting. The Watergate scandal had been dragging on for a while, and the tapes came out that showed he was involved, right? So when the Supreme Court made him turn over the tapes, that was the final straw for a lot of people.

I remember something about a significant percentage wanting him impeached or removed. I think it was around 60% or so. Let me think about the options. Option C is 62%, which sounds familiar. Option I is 70%, which might be a bit high. Then there's option G at 79%, which seems too high. I don't think it was that high.

Wait, another angle: I think the percentage might have reached as high as 57% in some polls. Option A is 57%. But wait, was that before or after the tapes were released? Because the support dropped even more after that.

I think by July 1974, a poll showed that a majority, like 57%, favored impeachment. But then after the "smoking gun" tape came out in early August, support for impeachment went up even higher. So maybe before his resignation, it was around 57% or higher.

Wait, another thought. I think the final polls before he resigned showed that about 57% of the public wanted him to be removed. So maybe the correct answer is A:57%. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the support for impeachment was about 62% around that time.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall any specific numbers. I think in July 1974, a Gallup poll showed that 54% of Americans thought Nixon should be impeached and removed. But by August, after the tapes, it might have been higher. But wait, the question is before he resigned, which was August 9, 1974. So if in August it was higher, maybe 62%?

Alternatively, perhaps the number went up to around 70% towards the end. But I'm not sure. I'm trying to remember any specific figures. I think the correct answer is either 57% or 62%. Between options A and C.

Wait, another approach: sometimes in history, the figure cited is that a majority, around 57%, favored his removal. So maybe option A is correct. But I'm not 100% certain. I might be mixing up different polls or different times.

Alternatively, I've heard that by the time he resigned, about 70% of the public believed he should be removed. So that would be option I:70%. But that might be after the final evidence came out.

Wait, the question is about before he resigned. So if the tapes came out in early August, and he resigned on August 9, the polls conducted just before his resignation would probably show a high number. Maybe up to 70%.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of what I've read before. I recall that in July 1974, a Gallup poll found 44% favored impeachment, but that was before the critical tapes were released. Once the "smoking gun" tape was released on August 5, support for impeachment skyrocketed.

So by August 5, after the tape, I think the percentage jumped to around 57% or higher. Maybe 62% by the time he resigned a few days later.

Alternatively, maybe it's 70%. I'm not sure. I think I've heard 57% in some contexts. So I'm going to go with option A:57%.

The question asks how many people believed Nixon should be removed from office before his resignation. Nixon resigned due to the Watergate scandal, and public opinion shifted significantly as evidence against him mounted. By July 1974, polls indicated around 54% favored impeachment, but after the release of the "smoking gun" tape in early August, support for removal increased sharply. The exact percentage varies, but a commonly cited figure is 57%, which aligns with option A. While some sources suggest higher numbers like 62% or 70%, the most consistent figure before his resignation appears to be 57%.

Answer: A
