Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the discount rate for this portable color television. Let's see, the listed price is $280, and the net price after discount is $196. I need to find out what percentage discount was applied.

Hmm, I remember that discount rate is calculated by comparing the amount of discount to the original price. So first, I should find out how much the discount was in dollars. That's the difference between the list price and the net price.

So the discount amount would be $280 minus $196. Let me do that subtraction: 280 minus 196. Let's see, 280-200 is 80, but since I subtracted 4 more than needed (200-196=4), I should add those 4 back. So 80 +4 is 84. So the discount is $84.

Now, to find the discount rate, I take the discount amount divided by the original price and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So that's 84 divided by 280. Let me compute that.

Wait, what's 84 divided by 280? Let me think. 280 goes into 84 zero times, so let me add a decimal. Maybe it's easier to simplify the fraction. Both numbers are divisible by 28, I think. 84 divided by 28 is 3, and 280 divided by 28 is 10. So 3/10 is 0.3. So 0.3 times 100 is 30%. 

Wait, does that make sense? Because 30% of 280 should be $84. Let me check: 10% of 280 is 28, so 30% is 28*3 = 84. Yep, that checks out. So the discount rate is 30%.

Looking at the options, B is 30%, so the answer should be B.

The discount rate is calculated by dividing the discount amount ($84) by the original price ($280), resulting in 30%.
