C: 12 million automobiles
D: 10.8 million automobiles
E: 15 million automobiles
F: 1.2 million automobiles
G: 13.8 million automobiles

Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the expected demand for automobiles in an economy. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says that the economy currently has 60 million automobiles, and each one needs to be replaced every 5 years. Also, the population is 240 million people growing at 2% per year. I need to find the expected demand for automobiles this year, keeping other factors constant.

Wait, so the demand would be based on two things probably: the need to replace existing cars and the new demand from population growth. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

First, the replacement part. There are 60 million cars, each lasting 5 years. So every year, 1/5 of them (since 5 years) need to be replaced. So 60 million divided by 5 would give the annual replacement demand. Let me calculate that: 60,000,000 /5 = 12 million cars per year. So that's 12 million replacements needed each year.

But wait, is that all? What about the population growth? The population is growing, which would mean more people, so more potential car buyers. So I think I need to calculate the new demand due to population growth this year.

The population is currently 240 million and grows at 2% per year. So the increase in population this year would be 240 million * 2% = 4.8 million people. Now, I'm assuming each new person might need a car, but how many cars per person? Or is it per capita ownership?

Wait, the current number of cars is 60 million for 240 million people. So that's 60/240 = 0.25 cars per person. So each person has a quarter of a car on average. So if the population increases by 4.8 million, the new demand would be 4.8 million * 0.25 = 1.2 million cars.

So adding that to the replacement demand: 12 million (replacements) + 1.2 million (new from population growth) = 13.2 million cars. Hmm, but let me check the options. Option H is 13.2 million. So that's a possibility.

Wait, am I missing anything here? Let me go through again. Replacement is 60 million /5 =12 million. Population grows by 4.8 million, each contributes 0.25 cars, so 1.2 million. Total is 13.2 million. That makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering replacement and not the population growth. But the question says "expected demand for this year," which I think includes both replacement and new demand from growth.

Wait, another approach: maybe the demand is calculated based on the current population's car ownership rate, and then considering the growth. So current cars per capita is 0.25. If the population grows by 2%, the new population this year is 240 *1.02=244.8 million. So the total number of cars needed would be 244.8 million * 0.25 = 61.2 million cars. But wait, that's the total number needed now. Since they already have 60 million, the additional demand is 1.2 million. But that doesn't account for replacements. Or maybe that's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing two different methods. Let's clarify. The first method I used was to calculate replacement demand and new demand from population growth. The second method is calculating total cars needed for the new population and subtracting existing cars. But this second method might not account for the fact that some of the existing cars are being replaced.

Wait, but the problem states that each automobile must be replaced every 5 years. So the replacement is a steady demand each year. So the first method seems correct: replacement is 12 million, new from growth is 1.2 million, totaling 13.2 million. So the answer would be option H.

Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering the replacement and not the population growth. But that would give 12 million, which is option C. But the question states that the population is growing, so I think we're supposed to include that in the demand.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the population growth doesn't directly translate to new car demand because the cars are being replaced. Or maybe the 60 million cars are at the current population, so the demand for this year would include both replacement and the new population's needs.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total number of cars needed this year, considering both replacement and new demand.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to compute the number of cars needed for the current population and then add the growth. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another angle.

The total number of cars needed each year is the number of replacements plus the new cars needed due to population growth. So:

Replacement demand: 60 million /5 = 12 million per year.

Population growth: 240 million *2% = 4.8 million people. Assuming each person adds 0.25 cars (since 60/240=0.25), new cars needed: 4.8 *0.25=1.2 million.

Total demand: 12 +1.2=13.2 million. So option H.

Yes, that makes sense. So the expected demand would be 13.2 million.

To calculate the expected demand for automobiles, we consider two factors: replacement demand and new demand due to population growth.

1. **Replacement Demand**:  
   The economy currently has 60 million automobiles, each requiring replacement every 5 years. This means that \( \frac{60 \text{ million}}{5} = 12 \text{ million} \) automobiles need to be replaced annually.

2. **New Demand from Population Growth**:  
   The population grows at 2% per year. For a current population of 240 million, the increase in population this year is:  
   \[
   240 \text{ million} \times 2\% = 4.8 \text{ million people}.
   \]  
   Assuming the current car ownership rate remains constant at \( \frac{60 \text{ million cars}}{240 \text{ million people}} = 0.25 \text{ cars per person} \), the new demand for automobiles is:  
   \[
   4.8 \text{ million people} \times 0.25 \text{ cars per person} = 1.2 \text{ million cars}.
   \]

3. **Total Demand**:  
   Adding the replacement demand and the new demand gives the total expected demand for automobiles this year:  
   \[
   12 \text{ million (replacement)} + 1.2 \text{ million (new demand)} = 13.2 \text{ million automobiles}.
   \]

Thus, the expected demand for automobiles this year is **13.2 million**, corresponding to option **H**.
