Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electromagnetic radiation traveling down a rectangular guide. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the width 'a' of a rectangular guide such that the energy of the electromagnetic radiation travels at a certain percentage of the speed of light. Specifically, part (a) is 95% and part (b) is 50%.

Hmm, I remember that when electromagnetic waves travel through a waveguide, their speed isn't the same as in free space. The speed in the guide depends on the dimensions of the guide and the wavelength of the radiation. I think the formula for the phase velocity in a waveguide is v = c / sqrt(1 - (λc/λ)^2), but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, no, the cutoff wavelength plays a role here.

Wait, the cutoff wavelength is the maximum wavelength that can propagate in the guide. The cutoff occurs when the frequency is such that the wavelength is at its longest possible for the guide. For a rectangular waveguide, the cutoff wavelength λc is related to the guide's dimensions. For the dominant mode, which is the TE10 mode, the cutoff wavelength is λc = 2a, where 'a' is the longer dimension of the guide (like the width in a rectangular guide).

So, the phase velocity v is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - (λ/λc)^2). Oh wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is v = c / sqrt(1 - (fc/f)^2), where fc is the cutoff frequency. But since frequency and wavelength are inversely related, I might need to express this in terms of wavelength.

Alternatively, I remember that the phase velocity v can also be expressed as v = c * sqrt(1 - (λc/λ)^2). So when the operating wavelength λ is longer than the cutoff λc, the wave can propagate, but when it's shorter, it can't. Wait, no. Wait, the cutoff occurs when λ equals λc. So for propagation, the wavelength must be shorter than λc. Because if λ is longer than λc, that would mean the frequency is lower than the cutoff frequency, so it doesn't propagate. So the operating wavelength λ must be less than λc.

Wait, maybe I should get the formula right. Let me think. The cutoff wavelength λc is when the frequency is at its minimum (cutoff frequency) for the mode. So the phase velocity v is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - (λc/λ)^2 ). Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the cutoff. The cutoff frequency fc is when the wavelength is λc = c/fc. So when fc = c/(λc), then the phase velocity formula would involve comparing the actual frequency to the cutoff.

Alternatively, the general formula is v = c * sqrt(1 - (fc/f)^2 ). Since f = c/λ, this becomes v = c * sqrt(1 - (λ/(λc))^2 ), because fc = c/λc, so fc/f = λ/λc.

Wait, that makes sense. So v = c * sqrt(1 - (λ/λc)^2 ). So if I have v in terms of c, like 0.95c or 0.5c, I can solve for λ in terms of λc, and then find 'a' because λc = 2a. Because for the dominant mode, TE10, the cutoff wavelength is λc = 2a.

So let's start with part (a): v = 0.95c.

Set up the equation: v = c * sqrt(1 - (λ/λc)^2 )

So 0.95c = c * sqrt(1 - (λ/λc)^2 )

Divide both sides by c: 0.95 = sqrt(1 - (λ/λc)^2 )

Square both sides: (0.95)^2 = 1 - (λ/λc)^2 → 0.9025 = 1 - (λ/λc)^2 → (λ/λc)^2 = 1 - 0.9025 → 0.0975 → λ/λc = sqrt(0.0975) → approx 0.312.

So λ = 0.312 * λc.

Wait, but the given in the problem is the free-space wavelength λ, which is 3.0 cm. So λ = 3 cm.

So 3 cm = 0.312 * λc → λc = 3 / 0.312 → Let's calculate that.

3 / 0.312 is approximately 9.615 cm.

Wait, but λc is 2a, so a = λc / 2 = 9.615 / 2 ≈ 4.8075 cm. Hmm, that's about 4.8 cm.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. 0.95 squared is 0.9025.

1 - 0.9025 = 0.0975.

sqrt(0.0975) is approximately 0.31225.

So λ = 0.31225 * λc.

But λ is given as 3 cm, so 3 cm = 0.31225 * λc → λc = 3 / 0.31225 ≈ 9.615 cm.

So a = 9.615 / 2 = 4.8075 cm, approximately 4.8 cm.

Looking at the options, let's check for part (a) when v is 0.95c. The options are:

Option B: a=4.0 cm for part (a), which is lower than 4.8. Option F: a=4.8 for part (a). Option G: a=4.2. Option H: a=6.0. Option I: a=5.0. Option J: a=5.2.

Wait, looking at the options, option F says a=4.8 cm for part (a). So that's matching our calculation. So part (a) would be 4.8 cm.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, wait. I think I might have mixed up λ and λc in the formula.

Wait, the phase velocity equation is v = c * sqrt(1 - (λc/λ)^2 ), not (λ/λc). Because when λ is much larger than λc, the term (λc/λ) becomes small, and v approaches c, which makes sense. So I think I might have had the ratio inverted earlier.

Wait, no, let's correct that. So the correct formula is v = c * sqrt(1 - (λc/λ)^2 ). So when λ is much larger than λc, (λc/λ) is small, so sqrt approaches 1, so v approaches c. That makes sense because longer wavelengths (lower frequencies) would have higher phase velocities. Wait, but I thought that for a waveguide, the phase velocity increases as the frequency increases beyond cutoff.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The cutoff wavelength λc is the maximum wavelength that can propagate. So when the wavelength λ is smaller than λc, the wave can propagate. So for λ < λc, the term (λc/λ) would be greater than 1, which would make the argument of the sqrt negative, which isn't possible. So maybe I had the formula wrong.

Ah, I see, perhaps the correct formula is v = c / sqrt(1 - (λc/λ)^2 ). Wait, but that would mean when λ approaches λc from above, v goes to infinity, which makes sense because the phase velocity increases as you get closer to the cutoff wavelength from above.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me look up the correct formula.

Wait, I can't look it up, but I'll try to think. The phase velocity v_p is given by v_p = c / sqrt(1 - (f_c/f)^2 ), where f_c is the cutoff frequency. Since f = c/λ, this becomes v_p = c / sqrt(1 - ( (c/λ_c) / (c/λ) )^2 ) → simplifies to c / sqrt(1 - (λ/λ_c)^2 ). So v_p = c / sqrt(1 - (λ/λ_c)^2 ). 

Wait, but if λ is the free-space wavelength, and λ_c is the cutoff wavelength, then when λ approaches λ_c from below, v_p goes to infinity. That makes sense because as you approach the cutoff wavelength (from below), the phase velocity increases.

So the correct formula is v = c / sqrt(1 - (λ/λ_c)^2 )

So for part (a), v = 0.95c.

So 0.95c = c / sqrt(1 - (λ/λ_c)^2 )

Divide both sides by c: 0.95 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (λ/λ_c)^2 )

Take reciprocal: 1/0.95 = sqrt(1 - (λ/λ_c)^2 )

(1/0.95)^2 = 1 - (λ/λ_c)^2 → (approx 1.108) → 1.108 ≈ 1 - (λ/λ_c)^2 → (λ/λ_c)^2 ≈ 1 - 1.108 → which is negative.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula again.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the formula correctly. Let me think again.

The phase velocity v_p is given by v_p = c / sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

Because when λ is much larger than λ_c, the term (λ_c/λ) is small, so 1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 is close to 1, so v_p approaches c. Which makes sense because for longer wavelengths, the phase velocity approaches the speed of light in vacuum.

Wait, but when λ approaches λ_c from above, (λ_c/λ) approaches 1, so the denominator approaches zero, making v_p approach infinity. That's correct.

So the correct formula is v_p = c / sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

So let's apply this to part (a), where v_p = 0.95c.

So 0.95c = c / sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

Divide both sides by c: 0.95 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

Take reciprocal: 1/0.95 = sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

Square both sides: (1/0.95)^2 = 1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 → (approx 1.108) = 1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 → (λ_c/λ)^2 = 1 - 1.108 → which is negative again. That can't be right. So I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I should use the correct formula again. Let me think.

Another approach: For a waveguide, the cutoff wavelength λc is the maximum wavelength that can propagate. The guide supports waves with λ ≤ λc.

The phase velocity v_p is given by v_p = c / sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

Wait, but when λ is smaller than λc (so λ < λc), then λ_c/λ is greater than 1, making the denominator sqrt(1 - (something >1)^2 ), which becomes sqrt of a negative number. That's impossible. So perhaps the correct formula uses (λ/λc) instead.

Let me think again. Maybe the formula is v_p = c * sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

Wait, let's try that.

So v_p = c * sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

Now, for part (a), v_p = 0.95c.

So 0.95c = c * sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

Divide both sides by c: 0.95 = sqrt(1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 )

Square both sides: 0.9025 = 1 - (λ_c/λ)^2 → (λ_c/λ)^2 = 1 - 0.9025 → 0.0975 → λ_c/λ = sqrt(0.0975) ≈ 0.312.

So λ_c = 0.312 * λ.

But λ is given as 3.0 cm. So λ_c = 0.312 * 3 cm = 0.936 cm.

But wait, the cutoff wavelength λc is given by λc = 2a for the TE10 mode. So a = λc / 2 = 0.936 cm / 2 = 0.468 cm, which is way too small. That can't be right because the options are in the cm range, like 2,3,4 cm.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong again. Let me try to think from another angle.

Wait, I think I might have confused the cutoff wavelength with the operating wavelength. Let me clarify.

The cutoff wavelength is the maximum wavelength that can propagate in the guide. So when the frequency is at the cutoff, the wavelength is λc. So for frequencies higher than fc (cutoff frequency), the wavelength λ is shorter than λc.

So the phase velocity v_p is given by v_p = c * sqrt(1 - (λc/λ)^2 )

Wait, let's plug in the numbers again.

v_p = 0.95c = c * sqrt(1 - (λc/λ)^2 )

Divide both sides by c: 0.95 = sqrt(1 - (λc/3 cm)^2 )

Square both sides: 0.9025 = 1 - (λc/(3 cm))^2 → (λc/(3 cm))^2 = 1 - 0.9025 → 0.0975 → λc/(3 cm) = sqrt(0.0975) ≈ 0.312 → λc ≈ 0.312 * 3 cm = 0.936 cm.

But λc = 2a → a = 0.936 / 2 = 0.468 cm, which is way smaller than any option given. So that can't be right. I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is v_p = c * sqrt(1 - (λ/λc)^2 )

Let me try that.

So v_p = 0.95c = c * sqrt(1 - (3 cm / λc)^2 )

Divide by c: 0.95 = sqrt(1 - (3/λc)^2 )

Square: 0.9025 = 1 - (9)/(λc)^2 → (9)/(λc)^2 = 1 - 0.9025 → 0.0975 → (λc)^2 = 9 / 0.0975 → approx 92.307 → λc ≈ sqrt(92.307) ≈ 9.61 cm.

Ah, that makes more sense because then a = λc / 2 ≈ 4.805 cm, which is about 4.8 cm.

So for part (a), a is approximately 4.8 cm.

Now, looking at the options, option F says a=4.8 cm for part (a) and a=1.7 cm for part (b). So let's check part (b) with this.

Part (b) is v_p = 0.5c.

Using the same formula: 0.5c = c * sqrt(1 - (3 cm / λc)^2 )

Divide by c: 0.5 = sqrt(1 - (3/λc)^2 )

Square: 0.25 = 1 - (9)/(λc)^2 → (9)/(λc)^2 = 1 - 0.25 → 0.75 → (λc)^2 = 9 / 0.75 → 12 → λc = sqrt(12) ≈ 3.464 cm.

So a = λc / 2 ≈ 3.464 / 2 ≈ 1.732 cm, which is approximately 1.7 cm.

So part (a) is 4.8 cm and part (b) is 1.7 cm. Looking back at the options, option F matches this: a=4.8 for part (a), a=1.7 for part (b).

Wait, but let me verify once more. For part (b), v_p is 0.5c.

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - (λ/λc)^2 )

0.5c = c * sqrt(1 - (3/λc)^2 )

Divide both sides by c: 0.5 = sqrt(1 - (3/λc)^2 )

Square both sides: 0.25 = 1 - (9)/(λc)^2 → (9)/(λc)^2 = 0.75 → (λc)^2 = 12 → λc ≈ 3.464 cm → a = 3.464 / 2 ≈ 1.732 cm, so 1.7 cm.

Yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option F has a=4.8 cm for part (a) and a=1.7 cm for part (b). So the answer should be option F.

To determine the width \( a \) of a rectangular guide such that electromagnetic radiation with a free-space wavelength of \( \lambda = 3.0 \, \text{cm} \) travels at 95% and 50% of the speed of light, we use the formula for the phase velocity in a waveguide:

\[
v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\lambda_c}{\lambda}\right)^2},
\]

where \( \lambda_c \) is the cutoff wavelength, related to the guide width \( a \) by \( \lambda_c = 2a \). Rearranging the formula, we solve for \( \lambda_c \) and subsequently \( a \).

---

### Part (a): \( v_p = 0.95c \)

1. Substitute \( v_p = 0.95c \) into the formula:
   \[
   0.95c = c \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\lambda_c}{\lambda}\right)^2}.
   \]

2. Divide through by \( c \):
   \[
   0.95 = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\lambda_c}{\lambda}\right)^2}.
   \]

3. Square both sides:
   \[
   0.95^2 = 1 - \left(\frac{\lambda_c}{\lambda}\right)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0.9025 = 1
