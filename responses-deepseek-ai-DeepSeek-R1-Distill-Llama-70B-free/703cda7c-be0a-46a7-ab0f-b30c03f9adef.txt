Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the catharsis theory and its stance on frustration leading to aggression. I'm a bit rusty on psychology theories, but I'll try to think through this.

The question is asking what the catharsis theory states regarding the issue that frustration always leads to aggression or that aggression is always caused by frustration. And importantly, the theory's claim isn't supported by research.

First, I need to remember what catharsis theory is about. From what I recall, catharsis theory suggests that expressing or acting out aggressive feelings can reduce aggression. So, like, if you're angry, punching a pillow might make you feel better and less likely to act aggressively later. But wait, the question is about frustration leading to aggression.

Wait, I think there's another theory related to frustration and aggression. Oh right, the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis. That theory says that frustration (when you're blocked from achieving a goal) leads to aggression. So that hypothesis is about the cause of aggression being frustration.

But the question is about catharsis theory. So, what does catharsis theory say? Catharsis is more about the idea that releasing pent-up emotions, like anger, reduces the likelihood of further aggression. So, if you act out your aggression in a safe way, you'll be less aggressive afterward.

Wait, the question says, "Frustration always leads to aggression/aggression always predicated by frustration." So it's talking about the necessity of frustration for aggression. That sounds more like the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis, not catharsis. But the question is about what catharsis theory states on the matter.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's think again. The question says: What does the catharsis theory state in this issue, but is unsupported by research?

So, catharsis theory's stance on this issue. The issue being whether frustration leads to aggression or aggression requires frustration.

Wait, maybe the question is saying, according to the catharsis theory, what does it say about frustration and aggression, even though research doesn't support it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to parse it again.

The first part says: "Frustration always leads to aggression/aggression always predicated by frustration." So it's the idea that frustration is a necessary condition for aggression.

Now, the question is about what the catharsis theory says on this issue. So, does catharsis theory support that idea, or does it say something else?

Wait, I think catharsis theory is more about the idea that expressing aggression (like in a controlled way) reduces future aggression. So, it doesn't directly address whether frustration is a prerequisite for aggression. That's more the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis.

Wait, but the question is stating that the theory in question (catharsis) makes a claim about frustration and aggression which is unsupported.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Aggressive acts can only be predicted by physical characteristics. I don't think catharsis says that. It's more about emotional release.

Option B: Feelings of anonymity lead to more uncharacteristic violence. That's maybe deindividuation, not catharsis.

Option C: Aggressive acts increase the likelihood of further aggression. Wait, this might relate to the idea that acting aggressively can escalate more aggression, which I think research suggests happens, contradicting catharsis which would say aggression reduces future aggression.

Option D: Frustration is a prerequisite for any aggressive act. Oh, so this is saying that you can't have aggression without frustration. That's the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis, but the question is about catharsis theory. So maybe the question is incorrect, but perhaps the point is that catharsis theory doesn't say that, but the question says, what does catharsis theory state.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. The question says that the statement in question (frustration always leads to aggression or is required for it) is what the catharsis theory states, but it's unsupported.

Wait, no. The question says, "What does the CATHARSIS THEORY state in this issue, but is unsupported by research?" So the catharsis theory's stance on the issue is that frustration leads to aggression or that aggression is always due to frustration. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no. I think that the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis is the one that states that frustration is a cause of aggression, while catharsis theory is about the effects of expressing aggression.

Wait, perhaps the catharsis theory doesn't directly address whether frustration is a prerequisite for aggression. So maybe the question is a bit off, but looking at the options.

Option G: Aggressive act reduces inclination to engage in other aggressive acts. That's exactly what catharsis theory would say. But the question is about the catharsis theory's stance on the frustration-aggression link.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the catharsis theory's stance on whether frustration always leads to aggression. So the options would be what the theory says on this point.

Wait, but catharsis theory might not make a statement about whether frustration is necessary for aggression. It's more about the consequences of aggressive behavior.

So maybe the correct answer is D: Frustration is a prerequisite for any aggressive act. Wait, but that's the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis, not catharsis.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps catharsis theory does suggest that when you're frustrated, acting out aggressively (catharsis) reduces future aggression. But that doesn't make frustration a prerequisite.

Wait, the question says that the statement (frustration always leads to aggression or is always the cause) is made by catharsis theory, but research doesn't support it.

Alternatively, perhaps the catharsis theory doesn't say that frustration is the cause, but the question is implying that it does, which is incorrect, but the correct answer is the one that states that frustration is a prerequisite.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The options are about what the theory states. So the question is: the catharsis theory states X, but X is not supported by research.

So which option reflects what catharsis theory says about the frustration-aggression link.

Wait, perhaps catharsis theory doesn't say that frustration must lead to aggression. Instead, it's about the release of built-up aggression. So maybe the theory doesn't take a stance on whether frustration is the cause, but the question is saying that it does. So perhaps the correct answer is D: Frustration is a prerequisite for any aggressive act.

But wait, D says that, which is more the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis. So perhaps the question is incorrect in attributing that to catharsis theory.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the two theories.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G: Aggressive act reduces inclination to engage in other aggressive acts. That's catharsis theory, but the question is about the frustration-aggression link.

Wait, the question is about what the catharsis theory states regarding the issue of frustration leading to aggression. So maybe the theory doesn't address that, but the options might not have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: Aggressive acts increase the likelihood of further aggression. Because research shows that acting aggressively can escalate more aggression, which would contradict catharsis theory's claim that it reduces aggression.

But the question is about the catharsis theory's stance on the frustration-aggression link, not on whether acting aggressively reduces future aggression.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for the option that states that aggressive acts reduce further aggression, which is what catharsis theory claims.

Looking at the options, option G says: aggressive act reduces inclination to engage in other aggressive acts. So that's catharsis theory, which is the opposite of option C, which says aggressive acts increase further aggression.

But the question is about what catharsis theory states regarding the frustration leading to aggression. So perhaps the correct answer is D: frustration is a prerequisite for any aggressive act.

Wait, no. That's the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis's claim, not catharsis. So perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, the question is about catharsis theory's stance on the issue of whether frustration leads to aggression. So perhaps the theory doesn't say that frustration is necessary, but the question is implying that it does.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is D, because the question is suggesting that catharsis theory says frustration is a prerequisite for aggression, but research doesn't support that.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G because that's what catharsis theory says, but the question is about the frustration leading to aggression.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G. Because the question is about catharsis theory's stance on the issue, which is that aggressive acts reduce further aggression, which is unsupported by research.

So the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to rephrase it:

The statement is "Frustration always leads to aggression/aggression always predicated by frustration." The question is asking what the catharsis theory states regarding this issue, but which is unsupported by research.

So, does catharsis theory say that frustration leads to aggression, or that aggression is always due to frustration? Or does it say something else?

I think catharsis theory is more about the consequences of aggression, not the cause. So perhaps the correct answer is G: aggressive acts reduce inclination to engage in other aggressive acts. Because that's the theory's claim, but research shows that acting aggressively can increase further aggression, so the theory is unsupported.

Wait, that makes sense. So the answer would be G.

But wait, the question is about the theory's stance on the frustration-aggression link. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option that aligns with catharsis theory's claim about reducing aggression. So option G is that.

So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The question asks about the catharsis theory's stance on the issue of frustration leading to aggression or aggression always being caused by frustration, and which of the options reflects what the theory states, even though it is unsupported by research.

Catharsis theory is primarily about the idea that expressing or acting out aggressive feelings can reduce aggression. It suggests that engaging in aggressive acts can cathartically release pent-up emotions, thereby reducing the likelihood of further aggression. This is reflected in **Option G: "Aggressive acts reduce inclination to engage in other aggressive acts."**

While the Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis posits that frustration is a prerequisite for aggression (as stated in **Option D**), this is not a claim of catharsis theory. Catharsis theory focuses on the consequences of aggressive behavior rather than its causes. Research has shown that acting aggressively can sometimes increase further aggression, which contradicts the catharsis theory's claim. Therefore, the correct answer is **Option G**, as it aligns with what catharsis theory states about the reduction of aggression through aggressive acts, even though this is unsupported by research.

Answer: G
