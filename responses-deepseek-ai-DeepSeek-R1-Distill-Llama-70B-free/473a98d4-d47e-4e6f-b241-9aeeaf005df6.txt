Okay, I need to find the price of a European put option using the Black-Scholes model. Let me recall the formula for the put option. I think the formula for a European put is similar to the call option but adjusted. Wait, the call option price is S0*N(d1) - K*exp(-rT)*N(d2). So for a put, it's K*exp(-rT)*N(-d2) - S0*N(-d1). Or wait, another way: put = call + (PV of strike - current stock price). Hmm, maybe it's better to use the put formula directly.

The given parameters are:
- Stock price (S0) = $100
- Strike price (K) = $98
- Time to expiration (T) = 6 months = 0.5 years
- Risk-free rate (r) = 5.5% or 0.055
- Dividend yield (δ) = 1% or 0.01
- Volatility (σ) = 50% or 0.5

Wait, in the Black-Scholes model for a European option, if the underlying pays dividends, we adjust the stock price. Oh right, the formula uses S0 * exp(-δT) when calculating d1 and d2, or do we adjust the stock price in another way?

Alternatively, I think the formula for d1 and d2 when there's a dividend is:

d1 = [ln(S0/K) + (r - δ + σ²/2)T] / (σ√T)
d2 = d1 - σ√T

And the put option price is: P = K exp(-rT) N(-d2) - S0 exp(-δT) N(-d1)

Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Let me double-check. The standard Black-Scholes formula for a call is C = S0 N(d1) - K exp(-rT) N(d2). For a put, it's P = K exp(-rT) N(-d2) - S0 N(-d1). But wait, does the dividend yield affect S0 in the put formula as well? Or is that handled through the d1 and d2?

Alternatively, another approach: the put option can be calculated using the call option via put-call parity. Wait, put-call parity for European options is: C - P = S0 - K exp(-rT). So if I can calculate the call price, then P = C - S0 + K exp(-rT). But perhaps it's easier to use the direct formula.

Wait, let me think again. The correct formula for a put option in Black-Scholes, considering dividends, is:

P = K e^(-rT) N(-d2) - S0 e^(-δT) N(-d1)

Yes, that sounds right. Because the underlying could have dividends, which affects the stock price. So S0 is discounted by the dividend yield's effect over time.

So I need to compute d1 and d2 first. Let's calculate d1:

d1 = [ln(S0/K) + (r - δ + (σ²)/2) * T ] / (σ * sqrt(T))

Let me plug in the numbers.

S0 = 100, K=98, r=0.055, δ=0.01, σ=0.5, T=0.5.

Compute ln(100/98) first. 100/98 is approximately 1.020408. ln(1.020408) is about 0.0202.

Next, in the numerator:

(r - δ) = 0.055 - 0.01 = 0.045

σ²/2 = (0.5)^2 / 2 = 0.25 /2 = 0.125

So (r - δ + σ²/2) = 0.045 + 0.125 = 0.17

Multiply by T=0.5: 0.17 * 0.5 = 0.085

So the numerator is 0.0202 + 0.085 = 0.1052.

Denominator is σ * sqrt(T) = 0.5 * sqrt(0.5). sqrt(0.5) is about 0.7071. So 0.5 * 0.7071 ≈ 0.35355.

So d1 = 0.1052 / 0.35355 ≈ 0.2973.

Wait let me compute that division more accurately. 0.1052 ÷ 0.35355.

0.35355 * 0.297 is approx 0.1051. So yes, d1 is approximately 0.2973.

Now, d2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T) = 0.2973 - 0.5 * 0.7071 ≈ 0.2973 - 0.35355 ≈ -0.05625.

Wait, that's negative. So now I need to compute N(-d2) and N(-d1). Because in the put formula, it's N(-d2) and N(-d1). Alternatively, N(-d2) is 1 - N(d2) if d2 is positive, but in this case, d2 is negative, so N(-d2)=N(0.05625).

Wait, let's clarify. The cumulative distribution function N(x) gives the probability that a standard normal variable is less than x. So N(-d2) is N(0.05625) because d2 is -0.05625, so -d2 is 0.05625.

Similarly, N(-d1) is N(-0.2973) = 1 - N(0.2973).

So let's compute N(0.05625) and N(0.2973).

From standard normal tables:

N(0.05) is about 0.5199, N(0.06) is about 0.5236. Let's interpolate. 0.05625 is 0.05625 -0.05 = 0.00625 above 0.05. The difference between N(0.05) and N(0.06) is about 0.5236 -0.5199 = 0.0037 over 0.01 in x. So 0.00625 is 62.5% of the way from 0.05 to 0.06.

So 0.5199 + 0.0037 * (0.00625 /0.01) = 0.5199 + 0.0037 * 0.625 = 0.5199 + 0.0023125 = 0.5222.

So N(0.05625) ≈ 0.5222.

Now N(0.2973). Let's see: N(0.29) is about 0.6141, N(0.30) is 0.6179.

0.2973 is 0.29 + 0.0073. So the difference from 0.29 to 0.30 is 0.01 in x, contributing 0.6179-0.6141=0.0038 in probability.

0.0073 is 73% of 0.01. So 0.6141 + 0.0073/0.01 * 0.0038.

Wait, wait, more accurately, the change per 0.01 is 0.0038. So for 0.0073, the increase is 0.0038 * (0.0073/0.01) = 0.0038 * 0.73 ≈ 0.00277.

So N(0.2973) = 0.6141 + 0.00277 ≈ 0.6169.

Therefore, N(-d1) = N(-0.2973) = 1 - 0.6169 = 0.3831.

Now, putting it all together.

The put price P is:

P = K * exp(-rT) * N(-d2) - S0 * exp(-δT) * N(-d1)

Compute each term.

First, compute K * exp(-rT).

K=98, r=0.055, T=0.5. So rT=0.0275. exp(-0.0275) ≈ ?

Let me compute that. The natural exponent of -0.0275. I'll use the approximation exp(-x) ≈ 1 -x + x²/2 for small x.

x=0.0275, x²=0.00075625. So:

exp(-0.0275) ≈ 1 -0.0275 + (0.00075625)/2 ≈ 1 -0.0275 + 0.000378 ≈ 0.972878.

Alternatively, perhaps better to use a calculator-like approach:

We know that ln(0.9728) is approximately -0.0277, so exp(-0.0275) is approx 0.9728.

So 98 * 0.9728 ≈ 98 * 0.9728.

Compute 100 * 0.9728 =97.28, minus 2*0.9728=1.9456. So 97.28 -1.9456=95.3344.

So K exp(-rT) = 95.3344.

Multiply by N(-d2)=0.5222: 95.3344 * 0.5222.

Let me compute that:

95.3344 * 0.5 =47.6672

95.3344 * 0.0222 ≈ 95.3344 *0.02=1.9067; 95.3344 *0.0022≈0.2095. So total ≈1.9067+0.2095=2.1162.

So total for this term is approx 47.6672 + 2.1162=49.7834.

Next term: S0 * exp(-δT) * N(-d1)

S0=100, δ=0.01, T=0.5. δ*T=0.005. exp(-0.005)≈1 -0.005 + (0.005^2)/2 ≈0.9950125.

So 100 * 0.9950125 =99.50125.

Multiply by N(-d1)=0.3831: 99.50125 * 0.3831.

Compute this:

100 *0.3831=38.31. Subtract 0.49875 *0.3831≈0.49875 is 1 -0.50125? Wait, perhaps better to compute 99.50125 *0.3831 as:

Approx 100 *0.3831=38.31, but subtract 0.49875 *0.3831.

Wait, 99.50125 = 100 - 0.49875.

So 99.50125 *0.3831 =100*0.3831 - 0.49875*0.3831.

Compute 0.49875 *0.3831 ≈ 0.49875 *0.38 = approx 0.1896.

So 38.31 -0.1896 ≈38.1204.

So the second term is approximately 38.1204.

Now, putting it all together:

P = 49.7834 -38.1204 =11.663.

Hmm, but let me check the exact calculations because it's close to some options.

Looking at the options, option C is 11.9, option I is 12.3, E is 13.1, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation error somewhere. Let me double-check the computations.

Let me recompute d1 and d2.

d1 = [ln(S/K) + (r - δ + σ²/2) * T ] / (σ sqrt(T))

ln(100/98) = ln(1.02040816) ≈ 0.02020.

(r - δ) =0.055-0.01=0.045.

σ²/2=0.25/2=0.125.

So (r-δ + σ²/2) =0.045 +0.125=0.17.

Multiply by T=0.5: 0.17 *0.5=0.085.

So numerator is 0.0202 +0.085=0.1052.

Denominator: σ * sqrt(T)=0.5 * sqrt(0.5)=0.5 *0.70710678≈0.353553.

So d1=0.1052 /0.353553≈0.2973.

d2= d1 - σ sqrt(T) =0.2973 -0.353553≈-0.05625.

So N(-d2)=N(0.05625)=0.5222, as before.

N(-d1)=1 - N(0.2973)=1-0.6169=0.3831.

Compute K exp(-rT) =98 * exp(-0.055*0.5)=98 * exp(-0.0275)=98 *0.9728.

Let me compute 98 *0.9728:

Compute 100 *0.9728=97.28.

Subtract 2 *0.9728=1.9456.

So 97.28 -1.9456=95.3344.

Multiply by N(-d2)=0.5222: 95.3344 *0.5222.

Compute:

95.3344 *0.5 =47.6672.

95.3344 *0.0222: Let's compute 95.3344 *0.02=1.9067, 95.3344 *0.0022=0.2095.

So 1.9067+0.2095=2.1162.

Total term:47.6672 +2.1162=49.7834.

Now, S0 exp(-δ T) =100 * exp(-0.01*0.5)=100 * exp(-0.005)=100 *0.9950125=99.50125.

Multiply by N(-d1)=0.3831:99.50125 *0.3831.

Compute 100 *0.3831=38.31.

Subtract 0.49875 *0.3831.

0.49875 is 1 -0.50125? Wait, 100 -99.50125=0.49875.

So 0.49875 *0.3831≈0.49875 *0.38=0.1896; 0.49875 *0.0031≈0.001546.

Total ≈0.1896 +0.001546≈0.1911.

So 38.31 -0.1911=38.1189.

So P=49.7834 -38.1189=11.6645.

So approximately 11.66, which is close to option C:11.9, but a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps my approximations for the normal distribution functions are a bit off. Let me check more accurate values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise N calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me verify the put option formula.

Wait, another thought: the put option formula is P = K e^{-rT} N(-d2) - S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1), where q is the dividend yield. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use more accurate values for N(d1) and N(d2). Let me use a calculator for N(0.05625) and N(0.2973).

Using a standard normal table or calculator:

N(0.05) = 0.5199
N(0.06) = 0.5236
So for 0.05625, which is 0.05625-0.05=0.00625 above 0.05.

The difference in N between 0.05 and 0.06 is 0.5236-0.5199=0.0037 over 0.01 in x. So per 0.001 increase in x, the increase is 0.0037/0.01=0.37 per 0.001.

So 0.00625 increase: 0.00625 *0.37=0.0023125.

So N(0.05625)=N(0.05)+0.00625*(0.37) =0.5199+0.0023125=0.5222125.

Similarly, for N(0.2973):

Looking up N(0.29)=0.61407, N(0.30)=0.61791.

The difference is 0.61791-0.61407=0.00384 over 0.01 in x.

0.2973 is 0.29 +0.0073.

So the increase is 0.0073/0.01=0.73 of the interval.

So N(0.2973)=0.61407 +0.73*0.00384=0.61407 +0.00280=0.61687.

So N(0.2973)=0.61687, so N(-0.2973)=1-0.61687=0.38313.

So the numbers are accurate.

So P= 98 * e^{-0.0275} *0.5222125 -100 * e^{-0.005} *0.38313.

Compute each term more accurately.

Compute 98 * e^{-0.0275}:

e^{-0.0275}=?

Using Taylor series: e^{-x}=1 -x +x²/2 -x^3/6.

x=0.0275:

x²=0.00075625, x^3=0.0207969.

So e^{-0.0275}=1 -0.0275 +0.00075625/2 -0.0207969/6.

Compute each term:

1 =1.

-0.0275 =-0.0275.

0.00075625/2=0.000378125.

-0.0207969/6≈-0.00346615.

Adding these: 1 -0.0275=0.9725.

+0.000378125=0.972878.

-0.00346615=0.972878 -0.00346615=0.96941185.

But let me compute this with more accurate steps.

Wait, let me compute e^{-0.0275} using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

e^{-0.0275} ≈ 1/(e^{0.0275}).
