Okay, so I've got this triangle problem here, and I need to figure out the length of side XZ. Let me read the question again and try to visualize the problem.

So, triangle RST. Points X, Y, Z are on the sides RS, RT, and ST respectively. XY and XZ are midsegments of the triangle. Hmm, midsegments... I remember that a midsegment in a triangle is a segment that connects the midpoints of two sides. And the key thing about midsegments is that they're parallel to the third side and half its length. Right?

The given information: XY is 7 units long. RT is 13 units. The measure of angle YXZ is 124 degrees. And we need to find the length of XZ.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the setup. So, X is on RS, Y on RT, and Z on ST. XY and XZ are midsegments. That means XY connects midpoints of RS and RT, because XY is a midsegment. Similarly, XZ connects midpoints of RS and ST because it's a midsegment.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If XY is a midsegment, then X and Y must be midpoints of two sides. Similarly for XZ. So X must be the midpoint of RS, Y the midpoint of RT, and Z the midpoint of ST. Because XY connects X on RS and Y on RT, and XZ connects X on RS and Z on ST. So XY and XZ are midsegments, meaning each is half the length of the side they're parallel to.

Wait, but in triangle RST, if XY is a midsegment, it should be parallel to ST, right? Because midsegments connect midpoints of two sides and are parallel to the third. So XY being a midsegment would be parallel to ST, and half its length. Similarly, XZ should be parallel to RT and half its length.

Wait, but the problem says RT is 13. So if XZ is a midsegment, then XZ is half of RT, so XZ = 13/2 = 6.5. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. XY is a midsegment. So it connects midpoints of RS and RT. So XY is parallel to ST and has length half of ST. So ST would be 14, because XY is 7. But wait, the problem says RT is 13. Wait, so if XZ is a midsegment, it connects midpoints of RS and ST, so it's parallel to RT. So the length of XZ is half of RT. So RT is 13, so XZ is 6.5. That would make option B the correct answer.

But wait, the angle YXZ is 124 degrees. How does that fit in? Because if XY and XZ are midsegments, then triangle XYZ would be similar to triangle RST, but scaled down by a factor of 0.5. So the angles should be the same, right? But angle YXZ is 124 degrees. Wait, but if XY is parallel to ST, then angle YXZ would correspond to angle at R in triangle RST, perhaps. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up points here.

Wait, maybe I need to draw a diagram. So triangle RST with points X, Y, Z as midpoints. So X is midpoint of RS, Y midpoint of RT, Z midpoint of ST. Then XY is midsegment parallel to ST, and XZ is midsegment parallel to RT.

So in triangle RST, XY is parallel to ST, so angle at Y in triangle XY would correspond to angle at T in RST. Similarly, XZ is parallel to RT, so the angle at Z would correspond to angle at T... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps triangle XYZ is similar to triangle RST, but scaled down by 1/2. So all corresponding angles are equal.

But wait, the problem gives angle YXZ as 124 degrees. If triangle XYZ is similar to RST, then angle YXZ would correspond to angle RST or something else? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about triangle XYZ itself, not RST. Because the angle YXZ is in triangle XYZ.

Wait, triangle XYZ has sides XY=7, XZ=?, and angle YXZ=124 degrees. Wait, but earlier I thought XZ is 6.5, but maybe that's not correct because of the angle. Or perhaps the angle doesn't affect the length because we can use the Law of Cosines.

Wait, but if triangle XYZ is similar to RST, then their angles would match. So angle YXZ in XYZ would correspond to angle RST in RST. But I don't know what angle RST is. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the points to model the problem.

Let me place point X at (0,0) for simplicity. Since X is the midpoint of RS, let's say R is at (-a, b) and S is at (a, -b), making X at (0,0) the midpoint. Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the properties of midsegments and the Law of Cosines.

Wait, if XY is a midsegment, then it's parallel to ST and half its length. So ST = 2 * XY = 14. Similarly, XZ is a midsegment, so it's parallel to RT and half its length. RT is 13, so XZ is 13/2 = 6.5. So that would make answer B:6.5.

But then why is the angle given as 124 degrees? Because if that's the case, then in triangle XYZ, we can use the Law of Cosines to find XZ.

Wait, triangle XYZ has sides XY=7, XZ=6.5, and angle YXZ=124 degrees. Wait, but if I compute YZ using Law of Cosines, it should equal half of RT, because YZ would be a midsegment. Wait, no, YZ is not mentioned as a midsegment. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming XZ is 6.5. Because if the angle is 124 degrees, that might affect things. But wait, the midsegments' lengths are determined purely by the sides they're parallel to, regardless of angles. So angle YXZ being 124 degrees doesn't change the length of XZ, which is determined by RT being 13, so XZ is 6.5.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose in triangle XYZ, I know two sides and the included angle. Then I can find the third side using the Law of Cosines. But wait, in this case, I know XY =7, XZ=6.5, and angle YXZ=124 degrees. But that would mean I can check if these values make sense.

Wait, but if I use the Law of Cosines in triangle XYZ, with sides XY=7, XZ=6.5, and angle 124 degrees between them, the third side YZ would be:

YZ² = XY² + XZ² - 2*XY*XZ*cos(angle)
= 7² + 6.5² - 2*7*6.5*cos(124°)
= 49 + 42.25 - 91 * cos(124°)

Cos(124) is negative because 124 is in the second quadrant. Let me compute it numerically.

Cos(124°) ≈ cos(180-56) = -cos(56°) ≈ -0.5592.

So YZ² = 49 + 42.25 - 91*(-0.5592)
= 91.25 + 91*0.5592
Compute 91 * 0.5592 ≈ 91 * 0.56 ≈ 51. (Wait, 0.56 *90=50.4, 0.56*1≈0.56 → total ≈50.96)
So YZ² ≈91.25 +50.96 ≈142.21 → YZ≈√142.21 ≈11.92.

But wait, YZ is supposed to be half of RT, because Y and Z are midpoints. RT is 13, so YZ should be 13/2=6.5. But according to this calculation, YZ is about 11.92, which is way larger than 6.5. That's impossible. So there's a contradiction here.

Hmm, that suggests that my initial assumption that XZ is 6.5 might be wrong. Because if XZ is 6.5, then YZ comes out to be 11.92, which doesn't match the expected 6.5. So there's a problem.

Wait, that means perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I shouldn't assume that XZ is a midsegment? Or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Let me read the problem again. It says that in triangle RST, X is on RS, Y on RT, Z on ST. XY and XZ are midsegments. So XY is a midsegment, so it connects midpoints of two sides. So if X is on RS and Y is on RT, then X and Y must be midpoints of RS and RT, respectively. Similarly, XZ is a midsegment, so X is on RS and Z is on ST, so X and Z must be midpoints of RS and ST, respectively.

Wait, but if X is the midpoint of RS, and XY connects X (midpoint of RS) to Y (midpoint of RT), then XY is a midsegment parallel to ST, as per the midsegment theorem. Similarly, XZ connects X (midpoint RS) to Z (midpoint ST), so XZ is a midsegment parallel to RT.

So in triangle RST, midsegments XY and XZ are drawn, making XYZ a medial triangle or something similar. Wait, but the medial triangle connects all midpoints, so perhaps triangle XYZ is part of that.

Wait, in that case, the sides XY, YZ, and XZ would be midsegments. So XY is parallel to ST, XZ parallel to RT, and YZ parallel to RS. So YZ would be half of RS.

But in the problem, only XY and XZ are stated to be midsegments. So perhaps YZ is not necessarily a midsegment. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, but if X, Y, Z are midpoints, then all three midsegments would form the medial triangle. So perhaps all three are midsegments. But the problem only states that XY and XZ are midsegments, so maybe that's not necessarily the case. Or perhaps it is, because if X is the midpoint of RS, and Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST, then all three would be midsegments.

Wait, but if that's the case, then triangle XYZ would be the medial triangle, and all its sides would be half the length of the corresponding sides of RST.

So XY is half of ST, XZ is half of RT, YZ is half of RS.

So from the problem, XY =7, which means ST=14. RT=13, so XZ=13/2=6.5, which is option B. YZ would be half of RS, but RS isn't given.

But earlier, I calculated YZ as about 11.92, which would mean RS would be 23.84, which seems possible, but why is there an angle given?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since XY and XZ are midsegments, their lengths are determined by the sides they're parallel to. So regardless of the angle, their lengths are fixed. So XZ must be 6.5.

But then why the angle is given? Maybe the problem is a trick, giving extra information, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider triangle XYZ, where I know two sides and the included angle, and find the third side, but that doesn't make sense because in the midsegments, the lengths are determined.

Wait, but the problem gives angle YXZ as 124 degrees. So in triangle XYZ, angle at X is 124 degrees, with sides XY=7, XZ=6.5, and YZ=?

But earlier calculation gave YZ≈11.92, which would mean the original side RS would be 23.84, which is possible, but the problem doesn't mention RS. So perhaps the angle is a red herring, and the answer is 6.5, which is option B.

But why would the problem give the angle then? Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the midsegments are not both from the same triangle. Maybe I'm confusing the midsegments. Let me think again.

Wait, if XY is a midsegment, it connects midpoints of RS and RT. So XY is parallel to ST and half its length. So ST=14.

Similarly, if XZ is a midsegment, it connects midpoints of RS and ST, so XZ is parallel to RT and half its length. RT is given as 13, so XZ is 6.5.

So the length of XZ is 6.5, which is option B.

I think the angle is a distraction because once you know it's a midsegment, the length is determined regardless of the angle. So the answer is B:6.5.
</think>

In triangle RST, points X, Y, and Z are located on sides RS, RT, and ST, respectively, with XY and XZ being midsegments. A midsegment in a triangle connects the midpoints of two sides and is parallel to the third side, with a length equal to half of that third side.

1. **Properties of Midsegments**:
   - Since XY is a midsegment, it connects the midpoints of RS and RT, making XY parallel to ST and half its length. Given that XY = 7, it follows that ST = 2 * XY = 14.
   - Similarly, since XZ is a midsegment, it connects the midpoints of RS and ST, making XZ parallel to RT and half its length. Given that RT = 13, it follows that XZ = 2 * RT = 13 / 2 = 6.5.

2. **Relevance of the Angle**:
   - The problem also provides the measure of angle YXZ as 124°. However, the length of XZ is determined solely by the midsegment property and the length of RT. The angle does not affect the length of XZ, as midsegments are defined by their parallelism and proportional length relative to the third side.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the midsegment theorem, the length of XZ is 6.5, regardless of the given angle. The angle YXZ appears to be extraneous information in this context.

Thus, the length of side XZ is **6.5**.
