Okay, so I'm trying to find the area bounded by the curves y = cos(x) and y = cos²(x) between x=0 and x=π. Hmm, I remember that to find the area between two curves, I need to integrate the top function minus the bottom function over the interval where they intersect.

First, I should probably figure out where these two curves intersect between 0 and π. So, set cos(x) equal to cos²(x):

cos(x) = cos²(x)
Let me rearrange this: cos²(x) - cos(x) = 0
Factor out cos(x): cos(x)(cos(x) - 1) = 0

So, cos(x) = 0 or cos(x) = 1. 

In the interval from 0 to π, cos(x) is 1 at x=0 and 0 at x=π/2. So the points of intersection are x=0 and x=π/2. Wait, wait, wait. Because cos(0) is 1, but cos(π/2) is 0. So the curves intersect at x=0 and x=π/2.

So now I know that between 0 and π/2, one function is on top and the other is below. And between π/2 and π, it's a different situation. Wait, but wait, at x=π, cos(x) is -1, and cos²(x) is 1. So at x=π, y=cos(x) is -1, and y=cos²(x) is 1. Hmm, that's interesting. So in the interval from π/2 to π, cos(x) is negative, but cos²(x) is positive. So in that region, cos²(x) is always above cos(x) because cos(x) is negative there.

So the area will have two parts: from 0 to π/2, and from π/2 to π.

Wait, wait, but when I set up the integral, maybe I can do it in two parts or see if I can find a way to express it without splitting into two intervals. Let's think.

Wait, from 0 to π/2, cos(x) is positive. So which function is on top here? Let's pick a test point between 0 and π/2, say x=π/4. cos(π/4) is √2/2 ≈ 0.707. cos²(π/4) is (√2/2)^2 = 0.5. So cos(x) is larger than cos²(x) in this interval. So from 0 to π/2, the upper function is cos(x), lower is cos²(x).

From π/2 to π, cos(x) is negative, so the upper function is cos²(x) (which is positive), and the lower is cos(x) (negative). So the area between them would be the integral from 0 to π/2 of [cos(x) - cos²(x)] dx plus the integral from π/2 to π of [cos²(x) - cos(x)] dx.

Wait, but calculating both integrals might be a bit involved. Alternatively, since the area is the same whether you take the upper minus lower or absolute value, maybe I can find a smarter way.

Another approach: Maybe notice that in the entire interval from 0 to π, the area can be found by integrating the absolute difference between the two functions. But since the functions cross at x=π/2, it's easier to split the integral into two parts.

So let's set up the integrals.

First integral: from 0 to π/2, [cos x - cos² x] dx.

Second integral: from π/2 to π, [cos² x - cos x] dx.

Then, sum both areas.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral, A1 = ∫ (cos x - cos² x) dx from 0 to π/2.

Second, A2 = ∫ (cos² x - cos x) dx from π/2 to π.

Then, the total area is A1 + A2.

Alternatively, since the functions cross at π/2, and the area is symmetric in a way, but perhaps that's not helpful. Let's proceed.

Compute A1:

A1 = ∫ (cos x - cos² x) dx from 0 to π/2.

We can split this into two integrals: ∫ cos x dx - ∫ cos² x dx from 0 to π/2.

Compute ∫ cos x dx = sin x. Evaluated from 0 to π/2 gives sin(π/2) - sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1.

Now, ∫ cos² x dx. Hmm, I remember that the integral of cos² x can be found using the power-reduction formula: cos² x = (1 + cos 2x)/2.

So ∫ cos² x dx = ∫ (1 + cos 2x)/2 dx = (1/2) ∫ 1 dx + (1/2) ∫ cos 2x dx.

Compute each part:

(1/2) ∫ 1 dx from 0 to π/2 is (1/2)(x) evaluated from 0 to π/2: (1/2)(π/2 - 0) = π/4.

(1/2) ∫ cos 2x dx = (1/2)( (1/2) sin 2x ) evaluated from 0 to π/2.

Wait, let's compute it:

Integral of cos 2x is (1/2) sin 2x. So putting it all together:

(1/2) * [ (1/2) sin 2x ] from 0 to π/2.

At π/2: sin(2*(π/2)) = sin(π) = 0.

At 0: sin(0) = 0. So this part evaluates to 0.

So the integral of cos² x from 0 to π/2 is π/4 + 0 = π/4.

So A1 = [1] - [π/4] = (1 - π/4).

Wait, but wait: 1 is from the first integral, and π/4 is subtracted, so A1 = 1 - (π/4) ≈ 1 - 0.785 ≈ 0.215.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit small. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the integral of cos x from 0 to π/2 is indeed 1, correct. The integral of cos² x is (1/2)x + (1/4) sin 2x evaluated from 0 to π/2.

At π/2, (1/2)(π/2) + (1/4) sin(π) = π/4 + 0.

At 0, it's 0 + 0. So the integral is π/4.

So A1 = 1 - (π/4) ≈ 1 - 0.7854 ≈ 0.2146.

Now, compute A2, the second integral.

A2 = ∫ (cos² x - cos x) dx from π/2 to π.

Again, split it into ∫ cos² x dx - ∫ cos x dx.

Compute ∫ cos x dx from π/2 to π is sin x evaluated from π/2 to π.

sin(π) = 0, sin(π/2)=1. So the integral is 0 - 1 = -1.

So ∫ cos x dx from π/2 to π is -1.

Now, ∫ cos² x dx from π/2 to π. Again, using the same identity.

The integral of cos² x is (1/2)x + (1/4) sin 2x.

Evaluated from π/2 to π.

At π: (1/2)(π) + (1/4) sin(2π) = (π/2) + 0.

At π/2: (1/2)(π/2) + (1/4) sin(π) = (π/4) + 0.

So the integral from π/2 to π is (π/2) - (π/4) = π/4.

So ∫ cos² x dx from π/2 to π is π/4.

Putting it together, A2 = (π/4) - (-1) = π/4 + 1.

Wait, no: A2 is ∫ (cos²x - cosx) dx = ∫ cos²x dx - ∫ cosx dx.

So that's [π/4] - [ -1 ] = π/4 + 1.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the area can't be negative. Oh wait, no: the integral of cos x from π/2 to π is -1, so subtracting that integral is adding 1.

So A2 = (π/4) - (-1) => π/4 + 1.

Wait, but that would make A2 = 1 + π/4 ≈ 1 + 0.785 ≈ 1.785.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again.

Wait, A2 = ∫ (cos²x - cosx) dx from π/2 to π.

Which is [ ∫ cos²x dx ] - [ ∫ cosx dx ].

∫ cos²x from π/2 to π is π/4, correct.

∫ cosx dx from π/2 to π is sin(π) - sin(π/2) = 0 - 1 = -1.

So A2 = (π/4) - (-1) = π/4 + 1.

So yes, that's correct.

So total area is A1 + A2 = (1 - π/4) + (1 + π/4) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, because the π/4 terms cancel out.

Because (1 - π/4) + (1 + π/4) = 1 +1 + (-π/4 + π/4) = 2 + 0 = 2.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the total area is 2.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.

To find the area bounded by the curves \( y = \cos x \) and \( y = \cos^2 x \) between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pi \), we first determine the points of intersection by solving:

\[
\cos x = \cos^2 x
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
\cos^2 x - \cos x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos x (\cos x - 1) = 0
\]

Thus, \( \cos x = 0 \) or \( \cos x = 1 \). In the interval \( [0, \pi] \), the solutions are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pi/2 \). This divides the region into two parts:

1. From \( x = 0 \) to \( x = \pi/2 \), \( \cos x \) is above \( \cos^2 x \).
2. From \( x = \pi/2 \) to \( x = \pi \), \( \cos^2 x \) is above \( \cos x \).

The total area is the sum of the areas of these two regions:

\[
\text{Total Area} = \int_0^{\pi/2} \left( \cos x - \cos^2 x \right) dx + \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \left( \cos^2 x - \cos x \right) dx
\]

### First Integral: \( \int_0^{\pi/2} \left( \cos x - \cos^2 x \right) dx \)

1. Split the integral:
   \[
   \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos x \, dx - \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^2 x \, dx
   \]

2. Compute \( \int \cos x \, dx \):
   \[
   \int \cos x \, dx = \sin x
   \]
   Evaluate from \( 0 \) to \( \pi/2 \):
   \[
   \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) - \sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1
   \]

3. Compute \( \int \cos^2 x \, dx \) using the power-reduction formula:
   \[
   \cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \int \cos^2 x \, dx = \int \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int 1 \, dx + \frac{1}{2} \int \cos 2x \, dx
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sin 2x}{4}
   \]
   Evaluate from \( 0 \) to \( \pi/2 \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{\pi}{4} + 0 \right) - \left( 0 + 0 \right) = \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]

4. Combine results:
   \[
   \int_0^{\pi/2} \left( \cos x - \cos^2 x \right) dx = 1 - \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]

### Second Integral: \( \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \left( \cos^2 x - \cos x \right) dx \)

1. Split the integral:
   \[
   \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \cos^2 x \, dx - \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \cos x \, dx
   \]

2. Compute \( \int \cos x \, dx \):
   \[
   \int \cos x \, dx = \sin x
   \]
   Evaluate from \( \pi/2 \) to \( \pi \):
   \[
   \sin(\pi) - \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0 - 1 = -1
   \]

3. Compute \( \int \cos^2 x \, dx \) using the power-reduction formula:
   \[
   \int \cos^2 x \, dx = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sin 2x}{4}
   \]
   Evaluate from \( \pi/2 \) to \( \pi \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{\pi}{2} + 0 \right) - \left( \frac{\pi}{4} + 0 \right) = \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]

4. Combine results:
   \[
   \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \left( \cos^2 x - \cos x \right) dx = \frac{\pi}{4} - (-1) = \frac{\pi}{4} + 1
   \]

### Total Area

\[
\text{Total Area} = \left( 1 - \frac{\pi}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{\pi}{4} + 1 \right) = 1 + 1 = 2
\]

Thus, the total area is \( 2 \).
