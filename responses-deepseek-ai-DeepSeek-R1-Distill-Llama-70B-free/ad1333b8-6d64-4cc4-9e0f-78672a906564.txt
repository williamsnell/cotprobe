Okay, so I have this problem here about David and the paint he needs to cover a cube. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on math, but let me try to think this through step by step.

So the question says that the amount of paint needed is directly proportional to the surface area of the cube. Directly proportional means if one goes up, the other goes up by the same factor, right? So like, if the surface area doubles, the paint needed also doubles.

The problem gives me that a cube with a side length of 2 feet requires exactly 16 quarts of paint. And now I need to find out what size cube (edge length) David can cover with 169 quarts of paint.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I remember that the surface area of a cube is calculated by 6 times the side length squared. Because a cube has six faces, each face being a square with area side^2.

So for the first cube with side length 2 feet, the surface area would be 6*(2^2) = 6*4 = 24 square feet.

And this requires 16 quarts of paint. So the paint needed is directly proportional to surface area. That means Paint = k * Surface Area, where k is the constant of proportionality.

So, for the first cube, 16 quarts = k * 24. I can solve for k here. Let's do that: k = 16 /24 = 2/3. So k is 2/3 quarts per square foot.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if Paint is proportional to surface area, then Paint = k * Surface Area. So for the first cube, 16 = k * 24. So solving for k gives k = 16/24 = 2/3 quarts per square foot. So that's the constant.

Now, the second part is when David has 169 quarts. I need to find the surface area that can be covered with that amount of paint. So using Paint = k * Surface Area again, but now Paint is 169 quarts, and k is 2/3.

So 169 = (2/3) * Surface Area. To find Surface Area, divide both sides by (2/3), which is the same as multiplying by 3/2.

Surface Area = 169 * (3/2) = (169 * 3)/2 = 507/2 = 253.5 square feet.

Wait, but 169 times 3 is 507, right? So Surface Area is 507 divided by 2, which is 253.5. Hmm, okay.

Now, the surface area of a cube is 6 * (side length)^2. So I can set up the equation 6*(s^2) = 253.5.

So solving for s:

sÂ² = 253.5 /6.

Let me compute that. 253.5 divided by 6. Let me see, 6 times 42 is 252, so 42 with a remainder of 1.5. So 42.25, because 1.5/6 is 0.25. So 42.25. So s squared is 42.25.

Wait, wait, let me do it step by step. 253.5 divided by 6: 6 goes into 25 three times (3*6=18), remainder 7. Bring down 3: 73. 6 into 73 is 12 times (72), remainder 1. Bring down 5: 15. 6 into 15 is 2, remainder 3. Bring down 0 (since it's 253.5, maybe I should treat it as 253.50). So 6 into 30 is 5. So 42.25. So s squared is 42.25.

So s is the square root of 42.25. Hmm, I think 6.5 squared is 42.25 because 6^2 is 36, 7^2 is 49, and 6.5 squared is (6 + 0.5)^2 = 6^2 + 2*6*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 36 +6 +0.25=42.25. Yes, so s is 6.5 feet.

Wait, 6.5 is 13/2. Let me check the options. The options are A through J. Option B is 13/2, which is 6.5. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me recap to make sure I didn't make any errors. The first cube's surface area is 24, requiring 16 quarts, so k is 2/3. For 169 quarts, surface area is 169*(3/2)=253.5. Then surface area is 6s^2, so s^2=42.25, s=6.5, which is 13/2. So the answer should be B.

The amount of paint needed to cover a cube is directly proportional to its surface area. For a cube with a side length of 2 feet, the surface area is calculated as:

\[
\text{Surface Area} = 6 \times (\text{side length})^2 = 6 \times 2^2 = 6 \times 4 = 24 \, \text{square feet}.
\]

Since 16 quarts of paint are required to cover this surface area, the constant of proportionality \( k \) can be determined as:

\[
\text{Paint} = k \times \text{Surface Area} \implies 16 = k \times 24 \implies k = \frac{16}{24} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{quarts per square foot}.
\]

Now, for 169 quarts of paint, the surface area that can be covered is:

\[
\text{Surface Area} = \frac{\text{Paint}}{k} = \frac{169}{\frac{2}{3}} = 169 \times \frac{3}{2} = 253.5 \, \text{square feet}.
\]

The surface area of a cube is also given by \( 6 \times (\text{side length})^2 \). Setting this equal to 253.5:

\[
6 \times (\text{side length})^2 = 253.5 \implies (\text{side length})^2 = \frac{253.5}{6} = 42.25 \implies \text{side length} = \sqrt{42.25} = 6.5 \, \text{feet}.
\]

Thus, the edge length of the cube that can be covered with 169 quarts of paint is \( 6.5 \, \text{feet} \), which is equivalent to \( \frac{13}{2} \).

The correct answer is:

**B: \(\frac{13}{2}\)**
