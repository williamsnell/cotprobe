Okay, so I've got this problem about a shunt motor and calculating its counter emf, copper losses, and efficiency. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that it's a shunt motor, so both the armature and field windings are connected in parallel. The armature resistance is 0.055 ohms, and the field resistance is 32 ohms. They're using a rope brake to test mechanical efficiency, which makes sense because it applies a load to measure the torque.

The motor is running at 1400 rpm. The pulley has a diameter of 6 inches, so the radius would be half of that, 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet because 1 foot is 12 inches. Wait, yeah, 3 inches divided by 12 is 0.25 ft. The longitudinal pull is 57 lbs. So the torque can be calculated using the rope's tension and the radius of the pulley. Torque (T) is force times radius, so T = 57 lbs * 0.25 ft. Let me compute that. 57 times 0.25 is 14.25 lb-ft. But wait, to convert that into more standard units, maybe? Or maybe it's okay because power calculations in the system might be in imperial units. Hmm, we'll see.

The line voltage is 105 volts, and the current is 35 amps. So first things first, let's tackle part (a), the counter emf.

In a DC motor, the counter electromotive force (cemf) is given by E = V - Ia * Ra. Where V is the supply voltage, Ia is the armature current, and Ra is the armature resistance. Wait, but wait—the current given is the line current, which in a shunt motor is the sum of the armature current and the field current. Oh right, because in a shunt motor, the field is across the same supply, so If = V / Rf.

So first, let's find the field current. Rf is 32 ohms, and V is 105 volts, so If = 105 /32. Let me compute that: 32 times 3 is 96, so 3.28125 A approximately. So If is about 3.281 A. Then the armature current Ia would be the total current minus If. So Ia = 35 A - 3.281 A = 31.719 A. Let me note that as approximately 31.72 A.

Now, the armature resistance Ra is 0.055 ohms. So the voltage drop across the armature is Ia * Ra = 31.719 * 0.055. Let me calculate that. 30 * 0.055 is 1.65, 1.719 * 0.055 is about 0.0945. So total around 1.65 + 0.0945 = 1.7445 volts. So the counter emf E is V - Ia*Ra = 105 - 1.7445 ≈ 103.2555 volts. Let's say approximately 103.26 volts. So looking at the options, option F has 103.26 volts for counter emf. Option E is 104, which is a bit off.

Moving on to part (b), the copper losses. Copper losses in a motor are the sum of the armature copper losses and the field copper losses. So P_copper = Ia² * Ra + If² * Rf.

We have Ia as about 31.72 A, so Ia squared is (31.72)^2. Let me compute that: 30^2 is 900, 1.72^2 is about 2.958, and the cross term 2*30*1.72=103.2. So 900 + 103.2 + 2.958 = 1006.158 A². Multiply by Ra (0.055): 1006.158 * 0.055 ≈ 55.339 volts? Wait, no, that's watts because it's I² R. So 55.339 watts for the armature.

Then for the field: If is 3.281 A, so If squared is (3.281)^2 ≈ 10.769 A². Multiply by Rf (32 ohms): 10.769 *32 ≈ 344.608 watts. So total copper losses are 55.339 + 344.608 ≈ 399.95 watts, roughly 400 watts. So looking at the options, let's see which ones have around 400 watts. Option D is 400, F is 404. Hmm, our calculation is 399.95, which is almost 400. So why is option F at 404? Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating Ia. Let me redo that. If is 105/32 = 3.28125 A. So Ia is 35 -3.28125 = 31.71875 A. Squared, that's (31.71875)^2. Let me compute 31.71875^2. 31^2 is 961. 0.71875^2 is approximately 0.5166. The cross term 2*31*0.71875 = 44.8125. So total is 961 + 44.8125 + 0.5166 ≈ 1006.329. Multiply by 0.055: 1006.329 * 0.055. Let's compute 1000 *0.055=55, 6.329 *0.055=0.348. So total 55.348 watts. Armature loss.

Field loss: If is 3.28125 A. Squared is 3.28125^2 = 10.766. Multiply by 32 gives 344.608 watts. So total copper loss is 55.348 + 344.608 = 399.956, which is about 400 watts. So option D says 400, but F says 404. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the line current is the same as the armature current, but no, in a shunt motor, the line current is Ia + If.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's compute Ia more precisely. If = 105 /32 = 3.28125 A. So Ia = 35 - 3.28125 = 31.71875 A. Ia squared is (31.71875)^2.

Let me compute 31.71875 *31.71875:

31 *31 = 961.
31 *0.71875 = 22.296875.
0.71875 *31 = same as above.
0.71875 *0.71875 ≈0.5166.

So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=31, b=0.71875.

So 31^2 = 961.
2ab = 2*31*0.71875 = 44.8125.
b^2 ≈0.5166.

So total is 961 +44.8125 = 1005.8125 + 0.5166 ≈1006.329.

Multiply by Ra (0.055): 1006.329 *0.055 = let's compute 1000 *0.055=55, 6.329 *0.055=0.348, so total 55.348 W.

Field loss: (3.28125)^2 *32. 3.28125 squared is 10.766, multiplied by 32 is 344.608 W.

Total copper loss: 55.348 + 344.608 = 399.956 W, which rounds to 400 W. So option D says 400 W, others like F have 404. Hmm, but the counter emf in option F is 103.26 which matches our calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the copper loss part.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the copper loss is Ia^2 Ra plus I_line^2 R_arm? No, no. The copper losses are the sum of the armature copper loss (Ia² Ra) and the field copper loss (If² Rf). So I think my calculation is correct. So 400 W is option D and F has 404. So perhaps I should double-check the counter emf calculation.

Counter emf E = V - Ia Ra.

V is 105 V. Ia is 31.71875 A. Ra is 0.055.

31.71875 *0.055 = let's compute that exactly. 31 *0.055=1.705. 0.71875 *0.055=0.03953125. So total is 1.705 + 0.03953125 = 1.74453125 V.

So E = 105 - 1.74453125 = 103.25546875 V, which is approximately 103.255, so 103.26 V as I had before. So that's matching option F.

Wait, but then the copper loss in option F is 404 W, but my calculation says 400 W. Hmm, where is the discrepancy? Let me recalculate the copper loss more accurately.

Ia = 31.71875 A.

Ia squared = (31.71875)^2 = let's compute it using a calculator approach.

31.71875 *31.71875:

31 *31 = 961.

31 *0.71875 = 22.296875.

0.71875 *31 = 22.296875.

0.71875 *0.71875 = approx 0.5166.

So 961 + (22.296875 *2) + 0.5166 = 961 + 44.59375 + 0.5166 = 1006.11035.

Multiply by 0.055:

1006.11035 * 0.055 = (1000 *0.055) + (6.11035 *0.055) = 55 + 0.3361 ≈55.336 W.

Field loss: (105/32)^2 *32 = (3.28125)^2 *32.

3.28125^2 = 10.7666015625.

Multiply by 32: 10.7666015625 *32 = 344.6015625 W.

So total copper loss: 55.336 + 344.6015625 = 399.93756 W, which is ~399.94 W, approximately 400 W. So that's 400 W, but option F says 404 W. So that's a 4 W difference. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps I should calculate Ia more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should not neglect the exact value of If. Let's compute If exactly. 105 V divided by 32 ohms is 3.28125 A. So Ia is 35 -3.28125 = 31.71875 A. So Ia squared is (31.71875)^2 = 31.71875 *31.71875. Let me compute this more precisely.

31.71875 *31.71875:

Let me write 31.71875 as 31 + 0.71875.

Compute (31 + 0.71875) * (31 + 0.71875) = 31² + 2*31*0.71875 + (0.71875)^2.

31² = 961.

2*31*0.71875 = 62 *0.71875 = 62 * (0.7 + 0.01875) = 62*0.7=43.4, 62*0.01875=1.1625. So 43.4+1.1625=44.5625.

(0.71875)^2 = 0.5166.

So sum: 961 +44.5625= 1005.5625 +0.5166=1006.0791.

So Ia²=1006.0791 A².

Multiply by Ra (0.055): 1006.0791 *0.055 = let's compute this:

1006.0791 *0.05 =50.303955.

1006.0791 *0.005 =5.0303955.

Adding them: 50.303955 +5.0303955=55.33435 W.

Field loss: If² Rf = (3.28125)^2 *32. 3.28125^2=10.7666015625. Multiply by 32: 10.7666015625 *32=344.6015625 W.

So copper loss is 55.33435 +344.60156 = 399.9359 W, which is approximately 399.94 W, so 400 W.

So why does option F have 404 W? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the line current as Ia, which would be incorrect. Let me check that. If someone incorrectly took Ia as 35 A, then copper loss would be 35^2 *0.055 + (105/32)^2 *32. Let's compute that scenario.

35^2=1225. 1225 *0.055=67.375 W.

If is 105/32=3.28125, squared is 10.7666, multiplied by32=344.608 W. So total loss 67.375+344.608=411.983 W. So about 412 W, which doesn't match any options exactly. So perhaps that's why some options have higher values.

But according to correct calculations, it's 400 W.

Now, moving to part (c), efficiency. Efficiency is (output power) / (input power) *100%.

Output power is the mechanical power developed by the motor. But wait, in motors, the output is usually the mechanical power at the shaft. But in this case, using a rope brake, the power is calculated from the torque and speed.

So first, let's compute the mechanical power output. Torque T is 14.25 lb-ft, and speed is 1400 rpm.

Power in horsepower can be calculated using the formula:

Power (HP) = (T * N) / 5252, where T is in lb-ft, N in rpm.

So plugging in:

(14.25 lb-ft *1400 rpm) /5252 ≈ (20000)/5252 ≈ approximately 3.81 HP.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately: 14.25 *1400 = 19950.

19950 / 5252 ≈ 3.799 HP, which is about 3.8 HP.

But wait, let me think again: 1 HP is 746 watts. So 3.8 HP is about 3.8 *746 ≈ 2830.8 watts.

Alternatively, another approach: use the formula P = T * ω, where ω is in radians per second.

Torque T is 14.25 lb-ft. Let me convert that to N·m because the standard unit for torque in the SI system is N·m. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute in imperial units and then convert to watts.

Alternatively, the power can be calculated in imperial units as:

Power (watts) = (Torque in lb-ft) * (speed in rpm) * (2π/60) ) * conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute in imperial terms and then convert to watts.

Wait, 1 HP is 550 ft-lbf per second.

So, 1 W is approximately 0.737562 ft-lbf per second.

So, the power can be calculated as:

Power (W) = (Torque in lb-ft) * (angular speed in rad/s) )

Angular speed ω = 1400 rpm = (1400 * 2π) radians per minute. To get per second, divide by 60: 1400 *2π /60 = (1400/60)*2π ≈ 23.333 * π ≈ 73.3 rad/s.

So, P = T * ω = 14.25 lb-ft *73.3 rad/s.

But wait, I'm mixing units here. Let me make sure.

Wait, lb-ft is a unit of torque, which is force times distance. So 1 lb-ft is 1.3558179483314004 N·m.

So, T =14.25 lb-ft =14.25 *1.35581794833 ≈19.233 N·m.

Speed is 1400 rpm = 1400*(2π/60) rad/s = (1400/60)*2π ≈ 73.333 rad/s.

So power P = T * ω =19.233 N·m *73.333 rad/s ≈19.233 *73.333 ≈ 1411.3 watts.

Wait, that seems higher than the HP calculation earlier. Let me check.

Alternatively, using HP: 14.25 lb-ft *1400 rpm = 19950 lb-ft·rpm per minute. Since 1 HP is 550 lb-ft per second, so 19950 per minute is 19950 /60 = 332.5 lb-ft per second. Then, 332.5 /550 ≈ 0.6045 HP. That's about 0.6 HP, which is 447.4 watts. Hmm, that conflicts with the other calculation. So which is correct?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the correct formula for power when using torque and speed.

The correct formula is P = (T * N) / 5252, which gives horsepower. So:

T =14.25 lb-ft, N=1400 rpm.

P = (14.25 *1400) /5252 = 19950 /5252 ≈3.799 HP.

Convert that to watts: 3.799 *746 ≈ 2833.8 W.

Wait, that's different from the other calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Let me try again.

In the formula P = (T * N) / 5252, T is in lb-ft, N in rpm, and P is in HP.

Alternatively, P in watts can be calculated as:

P = (T * 2π * N) / 60, with T in N·m and P in watts.

So let's compute T in N·m, N in rpm.

T =14.25 lb-ft =14.25 *1.35581794833 ≈19.233 N·m.

N=1400 rpm.

So P = 19.233 * 2π *1400 /60.

Compute that:

2π *1400 = 8000π ≈25132.7412.

Divide by 60: 25132.7412 /60 ≈419.212.

Multiply by T: 19.233 *419.212 ≈8068
