Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. and Mrs. Miller buying a house and land, and they want to insure the house. Hmm, I need to figure out how much insurance they should purchase. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the total cost they paid for both the house and the land is $32,700. But they think the land is worth $5,500. So I guess the first thing I need to find out is the value of just the house. Because the insurance is only for the house, not the land, right?

So if the total is $32,700 and the land is $5,500, then the house must be the remaining amount. Let me subtract that. 32,700 minus 5,500 equals... let me calculate that. 32,700 minus 5,000 is 27,700, and then subtract another 500, so 27,200. So the house is worth $27,200.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 32,700 minus 5,500. Let me do that again. 32,700 minus 5,000 is 27,700. Then minus 500 more, so 27,200. Yeah, that's correct. So the house is valued at $27,200.

Now, they want to insure the house at 80% of its estimated value. So I need to find 80% of $27,200. How do I calculate that? Well, 80% is the same as 0.8 in decimal form. So I multiply 27,200 by 0.8.

Let me compute that. 27,200 times 0.8. Hmm, 27,200 times 0.8 is like 27,200 * 8/10. 27,200 divided by 10 is 2,720. Then multiply by 8 gives 21,760. So 80% of 27,200 is $21,760.

So the insurance they should purchase is $21,760. Let me check the options to see which one matches. Looking back at the options, option B is $21,760. So the answer must be B.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total cost was 32,700, land is 5,500, so house is 27,200. 80% of 27,200 is 21,760. Yep, that seems right.

The Millers paid $32,700 for their house and land, with the land valued at $5,500. Subtracting the land's value from the total gives the house's value: $32,700 - $5,500 = $27,200. To insure the house at 80% of its value, calculate 80% of $27,200: 0.8 Ã— $27,200 = $21,760. 

From the options provided, the correct answer is B: $21,760.
