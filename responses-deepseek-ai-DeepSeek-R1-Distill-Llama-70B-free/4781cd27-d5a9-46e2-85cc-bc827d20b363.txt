Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. Hmm, so we have two Boolean random variables, A and B. The given probabilities are P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/3, and P(A | ¬B) = 1/4. We need to find P(A | B).

Wait, right, conditional probability. I remember that conditional probability formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But wait, how do I find P(A ∩ B) from the given information?

Let me think. We know that P(A) is the probability of A happening regardless of B. So, P(A) can be broken down into two parts: the probability of A happening when B happens, and when B doesn't happen. So, P(A) = P(A | B) * P(B) + P(A | ¬B) * P(¬B).

Oh right, because A can happen in two mutually exclusive cases: B is true or B is false. So that equation should hold.

Let me plug in the known values. P(A) is 1/2, P(B) is 1/3, so P(¬B) must be 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. And P(A | ¬B) is given as 1/4.

So substituting into the equation:
1/2 = P(A | B) * (1/3) + (1/4) * (2/3)

Let me compute the right-hand side. Let me calculate each part:

(1/4) * (2/3) = (2/12) = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.

So the equation becomes:
1/2 = P(A|B)*(1/3) + 1/6

I can subtract 1/6 from both sides to isolate the term with P(A|B):
1/2 - 1/6 = P(A|B)*(1/3)

What's 1/2 minus 1/6? Let's see, common denominator is 6. 3/6 - 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.

So now we have:
1/3 = P(A|B) * (1/3)

Wait, that's interesting. To solve for P(A|B), I can multiply both sides by 3.

1/3 * 3 = P(A|B) * (1/3) *3 → So 1 = P(A|B).

Wait, that's P(A|B) equals 1? So the probability of A given B is 1? That would mean that whenever B occurs, A must occur. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but mathematically it's what comes out.

Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. P(A) = P(A|B) P(B) + P(A|¬B) P(¬B)
2. Substituted the known values:
   1/2 = P(A|B)*(1/3) + (1/4)*(2/3)
3. Calculated (1/4)*(2/3) = 1/6
4. So equation becomes 1/2 = (P(A|B)/3) + 1/6
5. Subtracting 1/6 from 1/2 gives 1/3 on the left.
6. So 1/3 = P(A|B)/3 → Multiply both sides by 3 → P(A|B) = 1.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 1, which is option D.

To solve the problem, we start with the law of total probability for Boolean variables:

\[
P(A) = P(A | B) \cdot P(B) + P(A | \neg B) \cdot P(\neg B)
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( P(B) = \frac{1}{3} \), so \( P(\neg B) = 1 - P(B) = \frac{2}{3} \)
- \( P(A | \neg B) = \frac{1}{4} \)

The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = P(A | B) \cdot \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3}
\]

Simplify the second term on the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

Substituting back:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = P(A | B) \cdot \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6}
\]

Subtract \(\frac{1}{6}\) from both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = P(A | B) \cdot \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now solve for \( P(A | B) \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} = P(A | B) \cdot \frac{1}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
P(A | B) = 1
\]

Thus, the probability \( P(A | B) \) is 1, which corresponds to option **D**.
