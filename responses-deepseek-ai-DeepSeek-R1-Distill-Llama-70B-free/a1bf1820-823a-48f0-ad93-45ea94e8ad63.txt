B: a[i] == max
C: TRUE
D: FALSE

Okay, so I've got this boolean expression to simplify, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The expression is a[i] == max || !(max != a[i]). Hmm, let me break it down.

First, I remember that in boolean logic, || stands for OR, and ! is NOT. So the expression has two parts connected by OR. The first part is a[i] == max, which means a[i] is equal to max. The second part is the negation of (max != a[i]).

Wait a minute, max != a[i] is the same as a[i] != max. So the second part is !(a[i] != max). What's the opposite of a[i] not equal to max? Oh right, that would be a[i] equals max. So the second part simplifies to a[i] == max.

So now the expression becomes a[i] == max || a[i] == max. Because both parts are the same. So when you have something OR itself, what does that evaluate to? Well, if either is true, the whole thing is true. But since both are the same condition, it's just that condition. So this whole expression simplifies to a[i] == max.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: let's think about the original expression. a[i] == max OR (not (max is not equal to a[i])). The not of (max != a[i]) would be max == a[i], which is the same as a[i] == max. So yes, both parts are the same, so the whole expression is just a[i] == max.

Looking at the options, option B is a[i] == max. So that's the one. But wait, let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option F is a[i] == max || a[i] != max. Wait, that's different because that would be true in all cases. Because if a[i] is equal to max, the first part is true. If it's not, the second is true. So that's always true. But that's not our expression.

Wait wait, no. Our expression is (a == max) OR (not (max != a)). Which is the same as (a == max) OR (a == max), which simplifies to a == max.

Wait, am I confusing something? Let me think again. The second part: !(max != a[i]). Let me write it in another way. max != a[i] is the same as a[i] != max, right? So the negation is a[i] == max. So the second part is the same as the first part. So the expression is a[i]==max OR a[i]==max. Which is just a[i]==max.

So the simplified form is a[i] == max, which is option B.

But wait, why is option F a choice? Let me see. Option F is a[i]==max || a[i]!=max. That's always true because any value is either equal or not equal. So F would be TRUE always. But our original expression isn't always true. It's only true when a[i] equals max.

So the correct answer should be B.

The boolean expression `a[i] == max || !(max != a[i])` can be simplified by analyzing each part. The first part, `a[i] == max`, checks if `a[i]` is equal to `max`. The second part, `!(max != a[i])`, is the negation of `max != a[i]`, which simplifies to `a[i] == max`. Thus, the entire expression becomes `a[i] == max || a[i] == max`, which further simplifies to `a[i] == max`.

Among the options provided, the correct simplification is `a[i] == max`, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
