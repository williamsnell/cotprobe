Okay, so I've got this question about impedance in a circuit. Hmm, I remember impedance is related to voltage and current, kinda like resistance but for AC circuits. Oh right, Ohm's Law applies here too. So the formula should be Z = V / I.

The voltage given is 100 at 0 degrees. Oh wait, that's a phasor, right? So in rectangular form, that's 100 + j0 volts.

The current is 7.07 + j7.07 A. Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, wait, isn't 7.07 approximately 5 times the square root of 2? Because 5√2 is about 7.07. So maybe this current is 5√2 at 45 degrees because the real and imaginary parts are equal. So the phase angle is 45 degrees.

So plugging into Z = V / I. So V is 100∠0°, and I is 7.07 + j7.07 A. Let me write that in polar form to make division easier.

Wait, maybe it's easier to do this in rectangular form. Let me think: Z is V divided by I. So the voltage is 100 + j0, and the current is 7.07 + j7.07.

So calculating Z: (100 + j0) / (7.07 + j7.07). Hmm, complex division. I remember that to divide complex numbers, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.

The denominator's conjugate is 7.07 - j7.07. So let's compute this.

Multiply numerator: (100 + j0) * (7.07 - j7.07) = 100 *7.07 + 100*(-j7.07) + 0*(7.07) + 0*(-j7.07). So that's 707 - j707.

Denominator: (7.07 + j7.07)(7.07 - j7.07) = (7.07)^2 + (7.07)^2 because (a+b)(a-b) = a² - b², but wait for complex numbers, it's (a + jb)(a - jb) = a² + b².

So 7.07 squared is about (7.07)^2 = 50, right? Because 7^2 is 49, so 7.07 squared is approximately 50. So denominator is 50 + 50 = 100.

So putting it together, the numerator is 707 - j707 and denominator is 100. So Z is approximately (707/100) - j(707/100) = 7.07 - j7.07 Ohms.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 7.07 -j7.07 Ω. So that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, the voltage is 100 and the current's magnitude is sqrt(7.07² +7.07²) = 7.07 * sqrt(2) = about 10 A. So the magnitude of impedance is 100 / (7.07*sqrt(2)) = 100/(10) =10 Ohms. Wait, that's the magnitude. But wait, that would suggest that the impedance is 10 Ohms at some angle.

But wait, in my earlier calculation, the magnitude came out to sqrt( (7.07)^2 + (7.07)^2 ) = 7.07 * sqrt(2) ≈10, which matches.

Wait, so wait a minute. Oh wait, no, because when I did the division, I got (707 -j707)/100 =7.07 -j7.07. So the magnitude is sqrt(7.07² +7.07²) =7.07 * sqrt(2) ≈10 Ohms, which matches. So that's correct.

So the impedance is 7.07 -j7.07 Ohms, which is option H.

Alternatively, let me think in polar form. The voltage is 100∠0°, current is 10∠45°, since 7.07 is about 5√2, so 5√2 * (1 +j1) which is 10 at 45 degrees. Oh wait, no, 5√2 is about 7.07, but 7.07 is 5√2. So 5√2 (cos45 + j sin45) is 5√2 * e^{j45} = (5√2) ∠45. So the magnitude is 5√2, but wait, 5√2 is about 7.07, right. So current is 7.07 ∠45.

So impedance Z= V/I = (100 ∠0) / (7.07 ∠45) )= (100/7.07) ∠(-45). 100 divided by 7.07 is about 14.14? Wait, because 7.07 *14 is about 98.98, so 100/7.07 is approx 14.14. Wait, but that would be about 14.14 ∠-45°, which in rectangular is 14.14 * cos(-45) + j sin(-45). Cos is about 0.707, so 14.14 *0.707 is approx 10. So 10 -j10. So that would give Z as 10 -j10 Ohms. But that's not one of the options. Wait, options don't have 10 -j10.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the polar approach? Because earlier in the rectangular calculation, I had 7.07 -j7.07 Ohms as the answer.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the current's magnitude. Let me recalculate. The current is 7.07 +j7.07. So the magnitude is sqrt(7.07² + 7.07²) =7.07 * sqrt(2) ≈10. So that's correct.

So V is 100, I is 10 ∠45°, so Z is 100 /10 ∠-45, which is 10 ∠-45, which is 7.07 -j7.07. Oh wait, because 10 * cos(-45) is about 7.07, and the imaginary part is -7.07. So that matches the earlier result.

So that would be option H. So that's correct.

Wait, but earlier when I thought magnitude of Z is 10, but in the rectangular calculation, Z is 7.07 -j7.07, magnitude is 10. So that's consistent.

So the correct answer should be H:7.07 -j7.07 Ω.

Looking at the options, option H is indeed that. So yeah, the answer is H.

To determine the impedance \( Z \) of the circuit, we use Ohm's Law for AC circuits: 

\[
Z = \frac{V}{I}
\]

The voltage is given as \( 100 \angle 0^\circ \), which in rectangular form is \( 100 + j0 \, \text{V} \). The current is \( 7.07 + j7.07 \, \text{A} \). To simplify the calculation, the current can also be expressed in polar form. Since the real and imaginary parts are equal, the magnitude of the current is:

\[
I = \sqrt{(7.07)^2 + (7.07)^2} = 7.07 \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 10 \, \text{A}
\]

and the phase angle is \( 45^\circ \). Thus, the current can be written as \( 10 \angle 45^\circ \).

### Step 1: Rectangular Division
Using the rectangular forms of \( V \) and \( I \), we calculate \( Z \) as:

\[
Z = \frac{100 + j0}{7.07 + j7.07}
\]

To divide these complex numbers, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

\[
Z = \frac{(100 + j0)(7.07 - j7.07)}{(7.07 + j7.07)(7.07 - j7.07)}
\]

The numerator becomes:

\[
(100)(7.07) + (100)(-j7.07) + (j0)(7.07) + (j0)(-j7.07) = 707 - j707
\]

The denominator is:

\[
(7.07)^2 + (7.07)^2 = 50 + 50 = 100
\]

Thus:

\[
Z = \frac{707 - j707}{100} = 7.07 - j7.07 \, \Omega
\]

### Step 2: Polar Form Verification
In polar form, \( V = 100 \angle 0^\circ \) and \( I = 10 \angle 45^\circ \). The impedance is:

\[
Z = \frac{100 \angle 0^\circ}{10 \angle 45^\circ} = 10 \angle -45^\circ
\]

Converting back to rectangular form:

\[
Z = 10 \cdot \cos(-45^\circ) + j \cdot 10 \cdot \sin(-45^\circ)
\]

Since \( \cos(-45^\circ) = \cos(45^\circ) \approx 0.707 \) and \( \sin(-45^\circ) = -\sin(45^\circ) \approx -0.707 \):

\[
Z = 7.07 - j7.07 \, \Omega
\]

### Final Answer
The impedance of the circuit is \( 7.07 - j7.07 \, \Omega \), which corresponds to option **H**.
