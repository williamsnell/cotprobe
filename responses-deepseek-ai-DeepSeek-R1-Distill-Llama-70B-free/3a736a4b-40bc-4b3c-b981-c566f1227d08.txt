Okay, so I'm trying to solve this finance problem about sight drafts and discounting. Hmm, I remember that a sight draft is like a bill of exchange that's payable on demand, right? So when it's presented, the acceptor has to pay it immediately. But wait, this one is a 60-day sight draft, which is a bit confusing because usually sight drafts are due on presentation. Oh wait, maybe it's a usance bill with a 60-day term, but it's called a sight draft because it's drawn on a bank or something. I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but let's keep going.

The draft is dated May 5, and it's for $255. Jane Morrow gave it to Jason Bros. Inc., and they accepted it on June 1. So the acceptance date is June 1. The draft is then discounted on July 1 at a 5% discount rate. I need to find the proceeds from discounting.

Wait, discounting a bill means the holder sells it to a bank or another party before maturity, right? So the bank gives them the present value, and on the due date, they get the face value. The difference is the interest, which is the discount.

But first, I need to determine when the draft is due. Since it's a 60-day sight draft, the term starts from the date of acceptance, which is June 1. So adding 60 days to June 1 would give the due date.

Wait, how do I calculate that? Let's think. June has 30 days. So from June 1 to June 30 is 30 days. Then, 60 days minus 30 is 30 days into July. So July 30. So the due date is July 30.

Now, the draft is discounted on July 1. So the time between July 1 and July 30 is the period for which the discount is calculated. How many days is that? From July 1 to July 30 is 29 days. Hmm, wait, because July 1 is day 0, so July 2 is day 1, so from July 1 to July 30 is 29 days? Or is it 30 days? Wait, no: July 1 to July 30 inclusive is 30 days, but if you're calculating days between July 1 and July 30 as the period, it's 29 days. Because from day 1 (July 1) to day 30 (July 30) is 29 days in between. Or maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, more accurately: the number of days from July 1 to July 30 is 29 days because July 1 is the starting point, and each subsequent day adds one. So July 1 is day 0, July 2 is day 1, ..., July 30 is day 29. So it's 29 days.

Wait, but wait another approach: the formula for calculating days between two dates is end date minus start date. But when calculating interest, if the discount is from July 1 until July 30, that's 29 days. Because July 1 is day 0, and July 30 is day 29. So the time period is 29 days.

So the discount is based on 29 days.

But wait, the discount rate is 5% per annum. So I need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the face value to get the proceeds.

The formula for discounting is:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value × Rate × Time)

Alternatively, it's Face Value × (1 - Rate × Time), but only if the time is in years.

Wait, no, the formula for the discount is Face * Rate * Time, so proceeds are Face minus that.

But I need to ensure that time is in years. Since the rate is 5% per annum, I have to convert 29 days into a fraction of a year.

Assuming a 360-day year for calculations, which is common in some financial contexts, especially in bills of exchange.

So 29 days is 29/360 of a year.

So the discount amount is 255 * 5% * (29/360).

Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 5% is 0.05. 29 divided by 360 is approximately 0.080555...

So the discount is 255 * 0.05 * (29/360).

Wait, let's compute 29/360 first. 29 ÷ 360 = 0.0805555...

Then 0.05 * 0.0805555 = 0.004027777...

So 255 * 0.004027777 ≈ ?

Calculating 255 * 0.004027777:

Let me think, 255 * 0.004 is 1.02. Then 255 * 0.00027777 is approximately 255 * 0.00027777 ≈ 0.0708. So total is about 1.02 + 0.0708 ≈ 1.0908.

So the discount is approximately $1.09. Therefore, the proceeds would be 255 minus 1.09, which is about 253.91.

Wait, but wait, let me recalculate more accurately.

Compute (29/360) = 29 ÷ 360 = let's see, 29 ÷ 360.

29 ÷ 360 = (29 ÷ 30) ÷ 12 ≈ 0.966666... ÷ 12 ≈ 0.080555...

So 0.05 * 0.0805555 = 0.0040277777...

Now, 255 * 0.0040277777 = ?

255 * 0.004 is 1.02.

255 * 0.0000277777 is 255 * 0.0000277777.

0.0000277777 is approximately 2.77777e-5.

255 * 2.77777e-5 = approximately 0.0070833.

So total is 1.02 + 0.0070833 ≈ 1.0270833.

So the discount is approximately $1.02708. So the proceeds are 255 - 1.02708 ≈ 253.9729, which is approximately $253.97.

Looking at the options:

Option E is $254.94, which is higher. Option J is $253.94, which is close to my calculation. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the time period. Let's double-check the days between July 1 and July 30.

July 1 is the date of discounting. The due date is July 30. So from July 1 to July 30, inclusive? Or exclusive?

Wait, when you discount a bill, the discount period is from the date of discounting to the due date. So the number of days is 30 - 1 = 29 days? Or 30 days?

Wait, another approach: if the bill is due on July 30, and you're discounting it on July 1, the number of days remaining is July 30 minus July 1. So that's 29 days because July 1 is day 0, July 2 is day 1, ..., July 30 is day 29.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So 29 days.

But what if the calculation uses 365 days instead of 360? That would change the result.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but in some cases, especially for bank discounting, 360 days is standard. But maybe in other contexts, 365 is used. Hmm.

If I recalculate using 365 days:

29/365 = approximately 0.07945.

0.05 * 0.07945 ≈ 0.0039725.

255 * 0.0039725 ≈ 255 * 0.004 = 1.02, so 0.0039725 is a bit less. Let's compute 255 * 0.0039725.

255 * 0.003 = 0.765

255 * 0.0009725 = approx 0.2482.

So total is 0.765 + 0.2482 = 1.0132.

So discount is about $1.0132.

Proceeds would be 255 - 1.0132 = 253.9868, which is approximately $253.99.

Still, looking at the options, J is $253.94, which is a bit less than that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, perhaps I should count the days from July 1 to July 30 as 30 days, not 29.

Because when you have a term from July 1 to July 30, it's 30 days including both start and end? Or is it 29?

Wait, the exact count: from July 1 to July 30 is 30 days if you include both days. Because July 1 is day 1, July 2 is day 2, up to July 30 as day 30.

Wait, no, no. Because when you're counting days between two dates, the number of days elapsed is end date minus start date.

For example, from July 1 to July 2 is 1 day. So from July 1 to July 30 is 29 days.

Wait, let me double-check. Let's take a small example: July 1 (day 0), July 2 is 1 day later. So July 1 to July 30 is 29 days later.

So the period is 29 days.

Wait, is there another approach? Maybe using the maturity value formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact days between June 1 (acceptance) and July 1 (discounting), but no, the discounting is on July 1 and the due date is July 30.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the days between discounting and due date, but from the date of the draft until discounting. Wait, no, the discount is applied on the date of discounting, so the period is from discounting date to due date.

Wait, another thought: maybe the term is 60 days from the date of the draft, which is May 5. So due date would be May 5 plus 60 days.

Wait, no, because the problem says it's a 60-day sight draft, which is accepted on June 1. So the term is 60 days from the date of acceptance, not the draft date.

Sight drafts are usually due on presentation, but since it's a 60-day sight draft, it's like a usance bill with a 60-day term starting from acceptance.

So, the due date is 60 days after June 1.

Calculating that:

June has 30 days, so June 1 plus 30 days is July 1. Then, 60 days total, so another 30 days would make it July 31. Wait, wait, no: wait, 60 days from June 1.

Wait, let me count: June has 30 days, so 30 days from June 1 is July 1. Then, add another 30 days (total 60), which brings us to July 31. Because June 1 + 30 days is July 1, plus another 30 days is July 31.

Wait, but wait, does June 1 count as day 0 or day 1? Hmm. If June 1 is the acceptance date, then the term starts on June 1. So day 1 would be June 2, and so on.

Wait, but in business terms, when you have a 60-day term, it's usually calculated as 60 days after the acceptance date, including the starting date. Or is it excluding?

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

If the bill is accepted on June 1, and it's a 60-day sight draft, the due date is 60 days after June 1. So, how to calculate that.

June 1 is day 0.

Then:

June 2 is day 1,

June 30 is day 29 (because 30-1=29).

Then, adding 30 more days in July: July 31 is day 60.

Wait, so 60 days after June 1 is July 31.

Wait, wait, 30 days in June after June 1: June 1 + 30 days is July 1. Then, adding 30 more days (total 60 days) brings us to July 31.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So the due date is July 31, not July 30 as I previously thought. Oh! So I made a mistake earlier in calculating the due date. That changes things.

So the discount is from July 1 to July 31. So the time period is July 1 to July 31: how many days is that?

July 1 is the discount date, and the due date is July 31.

So from July 1 to July 31, how many days? It's 30 days because July has 31 days. July 1 to July 31 is exactly 30 days.

So the time period is 30 days.

Wait, but again, when counting days in financial terms, the number of days between July 1 and July 31 is 30 days, right? Because July 1 is day 0, July 2 is day 1, up to July 31 as day 30.

So time = 30 days.

Now, calculating the discount:

Discount = Face Value × Rate × (Time / 360)

Face Value is $255.

Rate is 5%, so 0.05.

Time is 30 days.

So discount = 255 * 0.05 * (30/360)

Simplify:

30/360 = 1/12 ≈ 0.083333.

So 255 * 0.05 = 12.75.

Then 12.75 * (1/12) = 12.75 / 12 = 1.0625.

So discount is $1.0625.

Proceeds = Face Value - Discount = 255 - 1.0625 = 253.9375.

Which is approximately $253.94.

Looking at the options, option J is $253.94.

So the correct answer is J.
</think>

To determine the proceeds from discounting the 60-day sight draft, we first need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the face value of the draft. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Due Date Calculation**:  
   The draft is a 60-day sight draft accepted on June 1. The term begins on June 1, and the due date is 60 days later. Adding 60 days to June 1 results in a due date of July 31.

2. **Time Period for Discounting**:  
   The draft is discounted on July 1, so the time period from July 1 to July 31 is 30 days.

3. **Discount Calculation**:  
   The discount is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Rate} \times \left(\frac{\text{Time}}{360}\right)
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   - Face Value = $255  
   - Rate = 5\% = 0.05  
   - Time = 30 days  
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 255 \times 0.05 \times \left(\frac{30}{360}\right)
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 255 \times 0.05 \times 0.083333 \approx 1.0625
   \]

4. **Proceeds Calculation**:  
   The proceeds are the face value minus the discount:  
   \[
   \text{Proceeds} = 255 - 1.0625 = 253.9375
   \]  
   Rounding to two decimal places, the proceeds are approximately $253.94.

5. **Matching the Options**:  
   Among the given options, the closest match to $253.94 is **Option J**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: $253.94**

Answer: J
