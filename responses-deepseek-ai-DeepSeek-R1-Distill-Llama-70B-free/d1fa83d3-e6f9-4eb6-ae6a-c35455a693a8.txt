Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear binding energy or something like that. Let me try to think this through. The question is asking how much energy is required to break up a Carbon-12 nucleus into three alpha particles. Hmm, I remember that alpha particles are helium nuclei, right? Each alpha particle has a mass of 4 atomic mass units (AMU) because helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

Wait, Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if it breaks into three alpha particles, that's 3 times 4, which is 12 nucleons total. That makes sense because Carbon-12 is mass 12 AMU. So the total mass after breakup would be 3 * 4 AMU = 12 AMU. But wait, that's the same as the original Carbon-12. So does that mean no energy is needed? That doesn't sound right because I remember something about binding energy and mass defect.

Oh right! When nuclei are formed, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of its individual nucleons. This mass defect is converted into binding energy via E=mc². So when you split a nucleus into smaller parts, you're breaking the bonds, which requires energy input, but if the resulting particles have more mass than the original, that would mean energy is released. Wait, but in this case, the mass is the same. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Let me correct myself. When a heavy nucleus splits into lighter ones, like in fission, energy is released because the binding energy per nucleon is higher in the products. But here, breaking Carbon-12 into alphas—each alpha is a very tightly bound nucleus. So the binding energy per nucleon in Carbon-12 might be lower than in the alpha particles. So when you split, you might actually require energy because you're moving to a more stable state, but wait, that's not how it works. If the products are more stable (higher binding energy), then energy is released when forming them. So if breaking Carbon-12 into alphas releases energy, that would mean the process is exothermic, not requiring energy input.

Wait, but the question is about breaking up the nucleus, which would require energy. So the binding energy of Carbon-12 is what holds it together. To break it apart, you need to put in energy equal to the binding energy. But wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step.

The mass of Carbon-12 is 12 AMU. The mass of three alpha particles is 3 * 4 AMU = 12 AMU. So the total mass is the same. But wait, that can't be right because the binding energy comes into play. Oh wait, no. The actual mass of the Carbon-12 nucleus is less than the sum of 6 protons and 6 neutrons because some mass is converted into binding energy. Similarly, each alpha particle's mass is less than 2 protons + 2 neutrons because of their binding energy.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify. The mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of its nucleons. So when you have a Carbon-12 nucleus, its mass is 12 AMU, but the sum of 6 protons and 6 neutrons would be more than 12 AMU. Because each proton is about 1.007276 AMU and each neutron is about 1.008665 AMU. So 6*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 6*(2.015941) = 12.095646 AMU. So the mass defect is 12.095646 - 12.000000 = 0.095646 AMU. This mass defect is the binding energy divided by c².

Wait, but the binding energy is the energy that would be required to break the nucleus into its constituent nucleons. But in this problem, we're breaking it into alpha particles, not individual nucleons. So the approach might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the mass of the Carbon-12 nucleus and the total mass of three alpha particles. Wait, but each alpha is itself a bound system. So the mass of three alphas is 3*(mass of an alpha). But wait, each alpha's actual mass is less than 4 AMU because of binding energy. So the actual mass of three alphas would be 3 times the mass of an alpha, which is less than 12 AMU.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The mass of a single alpha particle (He-4) is approximately 4.002603 AMU. So three alphas would have a total mass of 3 * 4.002603 = 12.007809 AMU. But the mass of Carbon-12 is exactly 12 AMU. So the mass of the products (three alphas) is 12.007809 AMU, which is more than the mass of Carbon-12 (12 AMU). So the mass increases, which according to E=mc² would mean that energy is released when the Carbon breaks into alphas. But wait, the question is about energy required to break up the Carbon into alphas. So if the products are more massive, that implies that the process is exothermic, releasing energy. But that can't be right because breaking bonds usually requires energy.

Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. If the mass of the products is higher than the reactants, then the system is less stable, so energy would need to be added for the reaction to occur. Because in fission, when a heavy nucleus splits into lighter ones, the products have lower mass, so energy is released.

Wait, but in this case, Carbon-12 is being split into three alphas. The total mass of the alphas is higher than that of Carbon-12. So the reaction would require energy input. So the energy required would be the difference in mass multiplied by c².

Wait, but the mass of the alphas is higher than the Carbon-12. So the mass difference is 12.007809 - 12.000000 = 0.007809 AMU. So the energy required would be 0.007809 AMU * c². Using the conversion factor of 931.481 MeV/u (AMU), this would be 0.007809 * 931.481 ≈ around 7.27 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 7.274 MeV. So that's probably the answer. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the binding energy of Carbon-12 and the binding energy of the alphas.

Wait, the binding energy (BE) is the energy required to break a nucleus into its nucleons. For Carbon-12, the BE is calculated as (Z*m_proton + N*m_neutron - M_nucleus)*c². So Z=6, N=6.

m_proton = 1.007276 AMU, m_neutron = 1.008665 AMU.

So sum = 6*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 6*(2.015941) = 12.095546 AMU.

M_nucleus (Carbon-12) is 12.000000 AMU.

Mass defect = 12.095546 - 12.000000 = 0.095546 AMU.

BE = 0.095546 * 931.481 ≈ 89 MeV? Wait, wait. 0.095546 * 931.481 MeV/AMU = approx 0.095546 * 931.481. Let me calculate that.

0.09 * 931 is about 83.79, 0.005546 * 931 ≈ 5.16. So total around 88.95 MeV. But the options don't have that. Option A is 92.15 MeV, which is close. Hmm, but wait, the question isn't about breaking into nucleons but into alphas. So perhaps we need to compare the BE of Carbon-12 with the total BE of the three alphas.

Each alpha has a BE. Let me check that. The BE of He-4 is about 4*0.03075 MeV? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the mass of a He nucleus is 4.002603 AMU. The sum of 2 protons and 2 neutrons is 2*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 2*(2.015941) = 4.031882 AMU. So mass defect is 4.031882 - 4.002603 = 0.029279 AMU. So BE per alpha is 0.029279 * 931.481 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.029279 * 931.481 ≈ 27.28 MeV. So each alpha's BE is about 27.28 MeV. So three alphas would have a total BE of 3 * 27.28 ≈ 81.84 MeV.

The BE of Carbon-12 was about 89 MeV (as I calculated earlier). So the difference would be 89 - 81.84 ≈ 7.16 MeV. Wait, but that's the energy required to break Carbon-12 into alphas. Because Carbon-12 has higher BE than the sum of the alphas' BE, right? Wait, no, wait. Because when you split Carbon-12 into alphas, you're going from a system with BE of 89 MeV to three systems each with 27.28 MeV, totaling 81.84. So the system becomes less bound, so energy must be input to break it up. So the energy required would be the difference, 89-81.84 ≈7.16 MeV. But wait, I think I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, when a nucleus splits into more stable nuclei (higher BE per nucleon), energy is released. But in this case, Carbon-12's BE per nucleon is lower than that of the alpha particles. Let me check that.

BE per nucleon for Carbon-12: 89 MeV /12 ≈ 7.42 MeV per nucleon.

For He-4: BE is 27.28 MeV, so per nucleon is 27.28/4=6.82 MeV. Oh, wait, wait, that can't be right because I thought alphas are more stable. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the BE of He-4.

Wait, mass of He-4 nucleus is 4.002603 AMU.

Sum of 2 protons and 2 neutrons: 2*(1.007276) + 2*(1.008665) = 2.014552 + 2.01733 = 4.031882 AMU.

Mass defect Δm = 4.031882 - 4.002603 = 0.029279 AMU.

BE = Δm * 931.481 MeV/AMU = 0.029279 * 931.481 ≈ 27.28 MeV. So BE per nucleon for He-4 is 27.28 /4 = 6.82 MeV/nucleon.

But for Carbon-12, I had BE of 89 MeV, so 89/12≈7.42 MeV/nucleon.

Oh wait, so Carbon-12's BE per nucleon is higher than that of He-4. So that suggests that Carbon-12 is more stable per nucleon than He-4. So when you split Carbon-12 into alphas, you're moving to less stable nuclei, which would require energy input.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought alpha particles are very stable. Maybe I made a mistake in the numbers. Let me check the BE per nucleon for Carbon-12 and He-4 again.

Alternatively, I remember that the BE per nucleon peaks around iron, with helium being lower. So Carbon-12's BE per nucleon is around 7.5 MeV, and He-4's is about 7.1 MeV. So Carbon-12 is more tightly bound per nucleon than He-4. So when you break up Carbon-12 into alphas, you're moving to a less tightly bound state, which requires energy input.

So the energy required would be the difference in binding energy between Carbon-12 and the three alphas. Let me compute that.

Carbon-12 BE: 89 MeV.

Three alphas' BE: 3 * 27.28 MeV = 81.84 MeV.

So the energy needed is 89 - 81.84 = 7.16 MeV. But wait, that's the energy that would be released if Carbon-12 were more bound than the alphas. But wait, no, because if the products have lower total BE, then the reaction would require energy.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The mass of the products (three alphas) is more than the mass of Carbon-12. So to go from Carbon-12 to three alphas, the mass increases, which means energy must be added. So the energy required is the mass difference times c².

Earlier, I calculated that the mass of three alphas is 12.007809 AMU, while Carbon-12 is 12.000000 AMU. So the difference is 0.007809 AMU. Multiply by 931.481 MeV/AMU gives 0.007809 * 931.481 ≈ 7.28 MeV. So the energy required is approximately 7.28 MeV. Looking at the options, option J is 7.274 MeV. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but another thought: when you split a nucleus into smaller nuclei, the energy required is the binding energy of the original nucleus minus the sum of the binding energies of the products. Because the original binding energy is the energy that holds it together, and the products have their own binding energies. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.

Alternatively, the energy required to split the nucleus is the energy needed to break the bonds, which is the binding energy of the original nucleus. But that doesn't account for the binding energy of the products. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, the initial approach where the mass of the products is higher than the original nucleus suggests that energy must be input, and the amount is the mass difference times c². That gave me 7.28 MeV, which matches option J. So I think that's the correct approach.
</think>

To determine the energy required to break up a Carbon-12 nucleus into three alpha particles, we analyze the mass difference between the reactants and products. Carbon-12 has a mass of 12.000000 AMU, while the total mass of three alpha particles (each with a mass of 4.002603 AMU) is:

\[
3 \times 4.002603 = 12.007809 \, \text{AMU}.
\]

The mass difference is:

\[
\Delta m = 12.007809 - 12.000000 = 0.007809 \, \text{AMU}.
\]

Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{AMU} = 931.481 \, \text{MeV} \), the energy required to break up the Carbon-12 nucleus is:

\[
E = \Delta m \times 931.481 = 0.007809 \times 931.481 \approx 7.274 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

This calculation shows that 7.274 MeV of energy is required to break the Carbon-12 nucleus into three alpha particles. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 7.274 MeV**
