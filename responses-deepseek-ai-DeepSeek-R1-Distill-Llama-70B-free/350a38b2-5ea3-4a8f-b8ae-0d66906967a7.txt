Question:

What is the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention?

Options:

A: Theories of Westphalian sovereignty argue that humanitarian intervention is an essential tool for maintaining global security, and hence should be supported by all states.
B: State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.
C: The Westphalian model of sovereignty promotes the idea of shared responsibility, arguing that states have a duty to intervene in a humanitarian crisis, regardless of the sovereignty of the affected state.
D: In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.
E: Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.
F: Westphalian sovereignty supports the idea of humanitarian intervention only when it is requested by the state in question.
G: The Westphalian concept of sovereignty emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and hence supports the idea of humanitarian intervention under the supervision of international bodies.
H: The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.
I: Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention are not related, as the former is a political concept and the latter is a social one.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

First, I remember that the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) is foundational for the concept of state sovereignty. It basically established that states have supreme authority within their own territories and that other states shouldn't interfere. So, the idea is non-interference and state autonomy, right?

Now, humanitarian intervention is when a state or group of states intervenes in another state's affairs, usually to stop severe human rights violations or mass atrocities. So, this seems to go against the non-interference principle because you're intervening in another country's internal affairs.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly describes the relationship between the two.

Option A says Westphalian sovereignty supports humanitarian intervention as a tool for global security. Wait, that doesn't seem right because Westphalian sovereignty is more about non-interference. So probably not A.

Option B states that state sovereignty can be disregarded if there's consensus that human life is at risk due to the state's actions. This sounds more like an exception to sovereignty, which aligns with the idea of humanitarian intervention. So B could be a contender.

Option C talks about shared responsibility and a duty to intervene. I think that's more related to the "Responsibility to Protect" (R2P) concept, not Westphalian sovereignty. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D mentions the Treaty of Westphalia itself defining sovereignty as subjective to the ruling elite's behavior. I don't think the original treaty said anything about that; it was more about ending the Thirty Years' War and establishing state sovereignty. So D seems off.

Option E claims that Westphalian theories make non-intervention paramount, and the UN condemns humanitarian intervention. But I know the UN sometimes does authorize interventions, like peacekeeping missions. So E might not be accurate.

Option F says Westphalia supports intervention only if the state requests it. That makes sense because it's still respecting sovereignty unless the state asks for help. So F is possible.

Option G suggests that Westphalian sovereignty emphasizes international cooperation and supports intervention under supervision. I'm not sure if that's accurate because the original concept was more about state independence. G might be mixing up different ideas.

Option H says that international norms of Westphalian sovereignty advocate non-intervention, as per the UN Charter, which allows force only in self-defense or with UN authorization. That sounds correct because the UN does respect state sovereignty but allows intervention under certain conditions, like Security Council approval.

Option I says they are unrelated, which I don't think is true since both deal with state sovereignty and intervention.

So, putting it together, the question is about the relationship. Westphalian sovereignty is about non-interference, but humanitarian intervention can sometimes override that. So which option reflects that?

Option B says sovereignty can be disregarded with international consensus when the state itself is the risk. Option H says the norms are about non-intervention, as per UN, which bans force except in self-defense or UN authorization.

Wait, the UN Charter does indeed reflect Westphalian principles by banning unauthorized intervention. So H is talking about the norms enshrined in the UN, which is a more modern take but built on Westphalian ideas.

So the correct answer seems to be H because it correctly states that the norms of non-intervention are part of Westphalian sovereignty, as seen in the UN Charter, which allows exceptions only under specific circumstances like Security Council authorization.

Alternatively, B suggests that sovereignty can be set aside if there's a consensus about human life being at risk. But the UN process requires more than just consensus; it needs Security Council authorization, which might not always happen even with consensus. So B might not be entirely accurate because it doesn't mention the UN's role.

So I'm leaning towards H being the correct answer.

The Treaty of Westphalia established the principle of state sovereignty, emphasizing non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. Humanitarian intervention, which involves intervening in another state's affairs to prevent human rights violations, challenges this principle. The correct answer must reflect the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention, considering how international norms and institutions like the United Nations (UN) address this tension.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Westphalian sovereignty is about non-interference, not supporting humanitarian intervention as a tool for global security.
- **Option B**: Partially correct but incomplete. While it suggests sovereignty can be disregarded with consensus, it doesn't account for the UN's role in authorizing intervention.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The idea of shared responsibility aligns more with the "Responsibility to Protect" (R2P), not Westphalian sovereignty.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The Treaty of Westphalia did not define sovereignty as subjective to the ruling elite's behavior.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The UN does not universally condemn humanitarian intervention; it allows it under specific conditions.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Westphalian sovereignty does not inherently support intervention, even if requested by the state.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Westphalian sovereignty emphasizes state autonomy, not international cooperation for intervention.
- **Option H**: Correct. It accurately reflects that Westphalian norms of non-interference are enshrined in the UN Charter, which allows exceptions like UN-authorized interventions.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The concepts are related, as both involve state sovereignty and intervention.

The best answer is **H**, as it accurately captures the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention, emphasizing the UN's role in upholding non-interference while allowing exceptions under specific conditions.

Answer: H
