Okay, so I've got a math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again: "Which ratio CANNOT form a proportion with 8 over 18?" The options are A to D, each with different fractions.

Alright, so the main thing I remember is that two ratios form a proportion if they are equivalent. That means if I simplify both fractions, they should be the same. So the task is to check which of these options doesn't simplify to the same value as 8/18.

First, let me simplify 8/18. To do that, I'll find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 18. The factors of 8 are 1,2,4,8, and for 18 it's 1,2,3,6,9,18. The highest common factor is 2. So dividing numerator and denominator by 2, I get 4/9. So 8/18 simplifies to 4/9.

Now I need to check each option to see if they simplify to 4/9. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: 60/135. Let's see. What's the GCD of 60 and 135? Factors of 60: 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60. For 135: 1,3,5,9,15,27,45,135. The common factors are 1,3,5,15. The highest is 15. So divide numerator and denominator by 15. 60 ÷15 is 4, 135 ÷15 is 9. So 60/135 simplifies to 4/9. That's the same as 8/18, so A can form a proportion. So A is not the correct answer.

Option B: 46/108. Hmm. Let's find the GCD of 46 and 108. 46 factors: 1,2,23,46. 108 factors: 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,27,36,54,108. The common factors are 1 and 2. So GCD is 2. Dividing both by 2: 46 ÷2 is 23, 108 ÷2 is 54. So simplified, it's 23/54. Wait, does 23/54 equal 4/9? Let me check by cross-multiplying. 23 *9=207 and 4*54=216. 207 ≠216, so 23/54 is not equal to 4/9. So this means option B does not form a proportion with 8/18. But wait, I should check the other options too to make sure.

Option C: 12/27. Let's simplify. GCD of 12 and 27. Factors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12. 27:1,3,9,27. So GCD is 3. Divide both by 3: 12 ÷3=4, 27 ÷3=9. So 12/27 is 4/9, same as 8/18. So C is okay, not the answer.

Option D:4/9. Well, that's already the simplified form of 8/18. So that's the same. So D is fine.

Wait, so the only one that doesn't simplify to 4/9 is option B. So the answer must be option B.

To determine which ratio cannot form a proportion with \( \frac{8}{18} \), we first simplify \( \frac{8}{18} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 18 is 2. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2, we get:

\[
\frac{8}{18} = \frac{4}{9}.
\]

Now, we simplify each option and compare it to \( \frac{4}{9} \):

- **Option A: \( \frac{60}{135} \)**  
  The GCD of 60 and 135 is 15. Dividing both by 15:  
  \[
  \frac{60}{135} = \frac{4}{9}.
  \]  
  This matches \( \frac{4}{9} \), so it can form a proportion.

- **Option B: \( \frac{46}{108} \)**  
  The GCD of 46 and 108 is 2. Dividing both by 2:  
  \[
  \frac{46}{108} = \frac{23}{54}.
  \]  
  Comparing \( \frac{23}{54} \) to \( \frac{4}{9} \), they are not equal (cross-multiplication confirms this). Therefore, this ratio cannot form a proportion with \( \frac{8}{18} \).

- **Option C: \( \frac{12}{27} \)**  
  The GCD of 12 and 27 is 3. Dividing both by 3:  
  \[
  \frac{12}{27} = \frac{4}{9}.
  \]  
  This matches \( \frac{4}{9} \), so it can form a proportion.

- **Option D: \( \frac{4}{9} \)**  
  This is already in its simplest form and matches \( \frac{4}{9} \), so it can form a proportion.

The only ratio that does not simplify to \( \frac{4}{9} \) is **Option B**.
