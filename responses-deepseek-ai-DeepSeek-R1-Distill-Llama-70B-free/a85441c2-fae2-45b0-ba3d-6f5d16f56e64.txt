Okay, so I've got this question about compound interest, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says Bill deposits $1,000 for 4 years at 5% interest, compounded annually. I need to find the accumulated value. Hmm, right, compound interest... I remember the formula from somewhere. Let me think.

Oh right, the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money.
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this problem:
- P is $1,000.
- r is 5%, so that's 0.05.
- Since it's compounded annually, n is 1.
- t is 4 years.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. Compounded annually means once each year, so n=1. Yeah.

So plugging the values into the formula: A = 1000*(1 + 0.05/1)^(1*4).

Let me compute that step by step. First, 0.05 divided by 1 is 0.05. Then, 1 + 0.05 is 1.05. Now, I need to raise 1.05 to the power of 4 because 1*4 is 4. 

Calculating 1.05^4. Hmm, I might need to compute that. Let's do it year by year. 

First year: 1.05. Second year: 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025. Third year: 1.1025 * 1.05. Let me calculate that. 1.1025 * 1.05. Well, 1.1 times 1.05 is 1.155, and 0.0025 *1.05 is 0.002625. So adding those gives 1.155 + 0.002625 = 1.157625.

Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that 1.05^2 is 1.1025. Then 1.05^3 is 1.1025 * 1.05. Let's compute that. 1.1025 * 1.05:

1.1025 * 1 is 1.1025.
1.1025 * 0.05 is 0.055125.
Adding them together gives 1.157625. 

Then, 1.05^4 is 1.157625 * 1.05. So let's compute that. 1.157625 * 1.05.

1.157625 * 1 is 1.157625.
1.157625 * 0.05 is 0.05788125.
Adding them gives 1.157625 + 0.05788125 = 1.21550625.

So 1.05^4 is approximately 1.21550625.

Now, multiply that by the principal, which is $1,000. So 1000 * 1.21550625 equals 1215.50625.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C is $1,215.51. Option E is $1,215.50. Hmm, wait, my calculation is 1215.50625, which is approximately 1215.51 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the exponents. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, I can compute each year's amount manually.

Year 1: 1000 * 1.05 = 1050.
Year 2: 1050 * 1.05 = 1102.50.
Year 3: 1102.50 * 1.05. Let's calculate that. 1102.50 * 1.05.

1102.50 * 1 = 1102.50.
1102.50 * 0.05 = 55.125.
Total after year 3: 1102.50 + 55.125 = 1157.625.

Year 4: 1157.625 * 1.05. Let's compute that.

1157.625 * 1 = 1157.625.
1157.625 * 0.05 = 57.88125.
Adding them together: 1157.625 + 57.88125 = 1215.50625.

Same result as before. So the accumulated value is $1,215.51, which matches option C.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is 1,215.51, and E is 1,215.50. Hmm, maybe I should check if I have a rounding difference. Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Wait, when I did 1.05^4, I think I did it correctly. Let me just verify 1.05^4.

Alternatively, I can compute it using logarithms or a calculator, but since I don't have one, let me see: 

1.05^1 = 1.05
1.05^2 = 1.1025
1.05^3 = 1.157625
1.05^4 = 1.21550625

Yes, that's correct. So 1000 * 1.21550625 is 1215.50625, which is $1,215.51 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the correct answer should be option C: $1,215.51.

Looking at the options again:

A: $1,000 (that's the principal, so not it)
B: $1,102.50 (that's after 2 years)
C: $1,215.51 (which is what we got)
D: $1,200 (doesn't match)
E: $1,215.50 (close, but one cent less)
F: $1,220 (nope)
G: $1,104.08 (that's 5% annually for 2 years maybe? Or perhaps 4%?)
H: $1,250 (higher)
I: $1,331.00 (that would be 5% over more years, maybe 5 years)
J: $1,300 (nope)

Wait, why is option E at $1,215.50? That's just a penny less than option C. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the math again.

Wait, when I computed 1.05^4, I got 1.21550625, so 1000 times that is 1215.50625. Rounding to the nearest cent would give 1215.51, as the third decimal is a 6, which rounds up.

So option C is correct. Therefore, the answer should be option C.

To calculate the accumulated value of Bill's deposit, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 1000 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 1 \) (compounded annually),
- \( t = 4 \) (years).

Substituting the values:

\[
A = 1000 \left(1 + \frac{0.05}{1}\right)^{1 \cdot 4} = 1000 \left(1.05\right)^4
\]

First, calculate \( 1.05^4 \):
\[
1.05^2 = 1.1025, \quad 1.05^3 = 1.157625, \quad 1.05^4 = 1.21550625
\]

Now, multiply by the principal:

\[
A = 1000 \cdot 1.21550625 = 1215.50625
\]

Rounding to two decimal places gives \( A = 1215.51 \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A: $1,000** — Incorrect, this is the principal amount.
- **B: $1,102.50** — Incorrect, this is the amount after 2 years.
- **C: $1,215.51** — Correct, matches the calculated amount.
- **D: $1,200** — Incorrect, does not match the calculation.
- **E: $1,215.50** — Close, but one cent less than the correct amount.
- **F: $1,220** — Incorrect, higher than the calculated amount.
- **G: $1,104.08** — Incorrect, does not match the calculation.
- **H: $1,250** — Incorrect, higher than the calculated amount.
- **I: $1,331.00** — Incorrect, corresponds to a longer time period.
- **J: $1,300** — Incorrect, does not match the calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: $1,215.51**.
