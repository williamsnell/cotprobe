Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is related to fluid dynamics, specifically velocity profiles in a pipe. The equation given is u equals u_max times (1 minus r over R) raised to the 1/7th power. I remember that u_max is the maximum velocity, which occurs at the center of the pipe where r is zero.

The problem has two parts: part (a) asks for the ratio between the mean velocity and the maximum velocity. Part (b) asks for the radius at which the actual velocity equals the mean velocity.

Let me start with part (a). I think the mean velocity in a pipe flow is the average of the velocity profile across the radius. Since the velocity varies with r, I need to integrate the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area and then divide by the area to get the mean velocity.

So the velocity profile is given as u(r) = u_max [1 - (r/R)]^(1/7). The cross-sectional area of the pipe is a circle with radius R, so the area is πR².

The mean velocity, ū, is the integral of u(r) over the area divided by the area. In polar coordinates, the area element is 2πr dr, because each thin ring at radius r has circumference 2πr and thickness dr.

So, setting up the integral for the mean velocity:

ū = (1/(πR²)) * ∫(from 0 to R) u(r) * 2πr dr

Substituting u(r):

ū = (2π/(πR²)) ∫(0 to R) u_max [1 - (r/R)]^(1/7) r dr

Simplify the constants:

The π cancels out, so 2/(R²) times the integral of u_max [1 - (r/R)]^(1/7) r dr from 0 to R.

Let me factor out u_max:

ū = (2 u_max)/(R²) ∫(0 to R) [1 - (r/R)]^(1/7) r dr

Hmm, I think I can make a substitution here. Let me set x = r/R. Then r = xR, and dr = R dx. When r=0, x=0; when r=R, x=1.

Substituting into the integral:

∫(0 to 1) [1 - x]^(1/7) * (xR) * R dx

Wait, wait. Let's see. The integral becomes:

∫(0 to 1) [1 - x]^(1/7) * xR * R dx

Because r = xR, so dr = R dx, and the original r is xR. So the integral becomes R² times ∫(0 to1) x(1-x)^(1/7) dx.

So putting it all together:

ū = (2 u_max)/(R²) * [ R² ∫(0 to1) x (1 - x)^(1/7) dx ]

The R² cancels out, so:

ū = 2 u_max ∫(0 to1) x (1 - x)^(1/7) dx

Now, this integral looks like a Beta function. The Beta function B(m,n) is ∫(0 to1) x^(m-1) (1-x)^(n-1) dx, which equals Γ(m)Γ(n)/Γ(m+n). 

In this case, our integral is ∫x (1-x)^(1/7) dx from 0 to1. So m-1=1 → m=2, and n-1=1/7 → n=8/7.

So the integral is B(2,8/7) = Γ(2)Γ(8/7)/Γ(2 + 8/7).

I remember that Γ(n) = (n-1)! for integers, and Γ(1) = 1. Γ(8/7) is a more complicated function, but maybe I can express it in terms of factorials or simpler terms.

Alternatively, I can compute the integral numerically. Let me think about the Beta function.

Wait, alternatively, the integral ∫x (1-x)^a dx from 0 to1 is equal to B(2, a+1) = Γ(2)Γ(a+1)/Γ(2+a+1) ) = (1!)(a! )/( (a+3)! )?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Beta function is B(m,n)= ∫0^1 t^{m-1} (1-t)^{n-1} dt.

In our case, x is t, m-1=1 → m=2, n-1=1/7 → n=8/7.

So B(2,8/7) = Γ(2)Γ(8/7) / Γ(2 + 8/7) = Γ(2)Γ(8/7)/Γ(22/7).

But Γ(22/7) is Γ(3 + 1/7) because 22/7 is 3 and 1/7. Using the property that Γ(z+1) = z Γ(z).

So Γ(22/7) = (22/7 -1) Γ(22/7 -1) = (15/7) Γ(15/7).

Similarly, Γ(2) is 1! = 1.

So putting it together:

B(2,8/7) = [1 * Γ(8/7)] / [ (15/7) Γ(15/7) ) ]

But Γ(15/7) = (15/7 -1) Γ(15/7 -1 ) = (8/7) Γ(8/7).

So substituting:

B(2,8/7) = [ Γ(8/7) ] / [ (15/7) * (8/7) Γ(8/7) ) ].

The Γ(8/7) cancels out:

= 1 / [ (15/7)(8/7) ) ] = 1 / (120/49) ) = 49/120.

So the integral is 49/120.

Wait, let me double-check that step. Because 15/7 * 8/7 is (15*8)/(7*7) )= 120/49.

So 1/(120/49) is 49/120.

So the integral is 49/120.

So going back to ū:

ū = 2 u_max * (49/120) = (98/120) u_max.

Simplify 98/120. Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 49/60.

So ū/u_max = 49/60.

Wait, that's 49/60. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, each option has (a) as some fraction over 60.

Looking at the options, option J has (a) 49/60, which matches. Option I has 48/60, which is close. Option H is 44/60, etc.

So part (a)'s answer would be 49/60.

Now, moving on to part (b): the radius at which the actual velocity equals the mean velocity.

We have u(r) = ū.

So u(r) = u_max [1 - (r/R)]^(1/7) = ū.

But ū is 49/60 u_max, so:

[1 - (r/R)]^(1/7) = (49/60).

Let me write that as:

[1 - (r/R)] = (49/60)^7.

Wait, no. Because it's raised to the 1/7th power. So to get rid of that, I need to raise both sides to the 7th power.

So:

1 - (r/R) = (49/60).

Wait no, wait. Let me correct that. Let me denote x = r/R.

So:

u(r) = u_max (1 - x)^(1/7) = ū = (49/60) u_max.

Divide both sides by u_max:

(1 - x)^(1/7) = 49/60.

Raise both sides to the 7th power:

1 - x = (49/60)^7.

So x = 1 - (49/60)^7.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, I think I messed up the steps. Let's think again.

Wait, (1 - x) = (49/60)^7.

Wait, no, because [ (1 - x) ]^(1/7) = 49/60 → 1 - x = (49/60)^7 → x = 1 - (49/60)^7.

Wait, that seems correct.

But wait, 49/60 is less than 1. So (49/60)^7 is a very small number. Let me compute that.

Wait, 49/60 is approximately 0.8167.

0.8167^7. Let me compute that.

0.8167^2 ≈ 0.8167 * 0.8167 ≈ 0.6667.

0.6667^2 ≈ 0.4444.

Then 0.4444 * 0.8167 ≈ 0.3636.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.

Compute 0.8167^2 = (approx) 0.8167 * 0.8167.

Let me compute 0.8 *0.8 = 0.64, 0.8*0.0167=0.01336, 0.0167*0.8=0.01336, 0.0167^2≈0.00028.

So sum:

0.64 + 0.01336 +0.01336 +0.00028 ≈ 0.666.

So (0.8167)^2 ≈ 0.666≈ 2/3.

Then (0.8167)^3 = (0.8167)^2 * 0.8167 ≈ (2/3) * 0.8167 ≈ 0.5444.

(0.8167)^4 ≈ 0.5444 * 0.8167 ≈ 0.5444*0.8=0.4355, 0.5444*0.0167≈0.0091 → total≈ 0.4446.

(0.8167)^5 ≈ 0.4446 *0.8167 ≈ 0.3636.

(0.8167)^6 ≈ 0.3636 *0.8167 ≈ 0.2968.

(0.8167)^7 ≈ 0.2968 *0.8167 ≈ 0.242.

So (49/60)^7 ≈ 0.242.

So 1 - x ≈ 0.242 → x ≈ 1 - 0.242 = 0.758.

So x= r/R ≈ 0.758 → r≈0.758 R.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J has (b) 0.758 R, which matches this. So for part (b), the radius is approximately 0.758 R.

So putting it all together, (a) is 49/60, (b) is 0.758 R. Looking at the options, option J is (a) 49/60, (b) 0.758R.

So the correct answer is J.

To solve the problem, we start with the given velocity profile:

\[
u(r) = u_{\text{max}} \left(1 - \frac{r}{R}\right)^{1/7},
\]

where \(u_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum velocity at the center of the pipe (\(r = 0\)).

---

### Part (a): Ratio of mean velocity to maximum velocity

The mean velocity, \(\bar{u}\), is calculated by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the pipe and dividing by the area. The area element in polar coordinates is \(2\pi r \, dr\), and the total area of the pipe is \(\pi R^2\). Thus:

\[
\bar{u} = \frac{1}{\pi R^2} \int_0^R u(r) \cdot 2\pi r \, dr.
\]

Substituting \(u(r)\):

\[
\bar{u} = \frac{2}{R^2} \int_0^R u_{\text{max}} \left(1 - \frac{r}{R}\right)^{1/7} r \, dr.
\]

Factoring out \(u_{\text{max}}\) and making the substitution \(x = \frac{r}{R}\) (\(r = xR\), \(dr = R \, dx\)):

\[
\bar{u} = \frac{2 u_{\text{max}}}{R^2} \int_0^1 \left(1 - x\right)^{1/7} \cdot xR^2 \, dx.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\bar{u} = 2 u_{\text{max}} \int_0^1 x \left(1 - x\right)^{1/7} \, dx.
\]

This integral is a Beta function, \(B(m, n)\), where \(m = 2\) and \(n = \frac{8}{7}\). Using the property of the Beta function:

\[
B(m, n) = \frac{\Gamma(m)\Gamma(n)}{\Gamma(m+n)},
\]

we compute:

\[
B\left(2, \frac{8}{7}\right) = \frac{\Gamma(2)\Gamma\left(\frac{8}{7}\right)}{\Gamma\left(2 + \frac{8}{7}\right)}.
\]

Using \(\Gamma(2) = 1\), \(\Gamma\left(\frac{8}{7}\right)\), and \(\Gamma\left(\frac{22}{7}\right) = \frac{15}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \cdot \Gamma\left(\frac{8}{7}\right)\), the result simplifies to:

\[
B\left(2, \frac{8}{7}\right) = \frac{49}{120}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\bar{u} = 2 u_{\text{max}} \cdot \frac{49}{120} = \frac{49}{60} u_{\text{max}}.
\]

The ratio of the mean velocity to the maximum velocity is:

\[
\frac{\bar{u}}{u_{\text{max}}} = \frac{49}{60}.
\]

---

### Part (b): Radius where the actual velocity equals the mean velocity

To find the radius \(r\) where \(u(r) = \bar{u}\), we set:

\[
u_{\text{max}} \left(1 - \frac{r}{R}\right)^{1/7} = \frac{49}{60} u_{\text{max}}.
\]

Dividing through by \(u_{\text{max}}\):

\[
\left(1 - \frac{r}{R}\right)^{1/7} = \frac{49}{60}.
\]

Raising both sides to the 7th power:

\[
1 - \frac{r}{R} = \left(\frac{49}{60}\right)^7.
\]

Approximating \(\left(\frac{49}{60}\right)^7 \approx 0.242\):

\[
1 - \frac{r}{R} \approx 0.242 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{r}{R} \approx 1 - 0.242 = 0.758.
\]

Thus, the radius is approximately:

\[
r \approx 0.758 R.
\]

---

### Final Answer

- (a) The ratio of the mean velocity to the maximum velocity is \(\frac{49}{60}\).
- (b) The radius at which the actual velocity equals the mean velocity is \(0.758 R\).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**J: (a) \(\frac{49}{60}\), (b) \(0.758R\).**
