Okay, so I've got this problem here about water flowing through a galvanized iron pipe. The question is asking me to determine the size of the pipe. Hmm, not entirely sure what "size" refers to here, but I'm guessing it's the diameter because that's a common parameter when talking about pipes and fluid flow.

The given data is: the flow rate is 3 cubic feet per second. So, Q = 3 ft³/s. The pressure loss is 5 feet per 1000 feet of flow. Wait, pressure loss per unit length, right? So, the head loss (h_f) is 5 ft for every 1000 ft of pipe length. So, h_f per 1000 ft is 5 ft. 

I remember that head loss in pipes is calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation or the Hazen-Williams equation. Since it's a galvanized iron pipe, which is a type of metal pipe, Hazen-Williams might be applicable here. But wait, I'm a bit confused about when to use which formula. Darcy-Weisbach is more general and uses the friction factor, while Hazen-Williams is an empirical equation often used for water in pipes.

The Hazen-Williams equation is: h_f = (10.67 * L * Q^1.852) / (C^1.852 * d^4.87), where h_f is the head loss, L is the length of pipe, Q is the flow rate, C is the Hazen-Williams coefficient, and d is the diameter.

Wait, but I think I might have that mixed up. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula is sometimes written as h_f = (P L Q^2) / (d^5), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the formula might be h_f = ( (Q^2 * L) * f ) / (d^5 * g), but that's the Darcy-Weisbach approach, where f is the friction factor and g is acceleration due to gravity.

Wait, the problem gives me the head loss per length. So, h_f per 1000 ft is 5 ft. So, h_f/L = 5/1000 = 0.005 ft of head loss per foot of pipe length.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for flow in a pipe, which relates flow velocity to the head loss. Since the flow rate Q is volume per time, and Q = A * v, where A is the cross-sectional area and v is the velocity.

So, if I can find the velocity, I can find the diameter because A = πd²/4.

But first, let's think about the head loss equation. Let me get the right formula.

Hazen-Williams equation is often written as:

v = 1.31 * C * (d)^0.63 * (h_f/L)^0.54

Wait, wait, no, that's another form. Alternatively, the equation can be expressed as:

h_f = (10.67 * L * Q^1.852) / (C^1.852 * d^4.87)

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall the correct form.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

Q = (0.432 * C * A * sqrt(d)) ) / ( L )^(0.5)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should look up the correct form, but since I can't right now, I'll have to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps using the Darcy-Weisbach equation would be better since I know the head loss and can relate it to velocity.

Darcy-Weisbach equation: h_f = (f * L * v^2) / (2g d)

But I don't know the friction factor f, so that might complicate things. Alternatively, since the pipe is galvanized iron, I can look up the Hazen-Williams C value. I think galvanized iron has a C of around 120, but I'm not totally sure. Maybe it's 100 or 110. Wait, I think it's about 120, but sometimes sources vary.

Alternatively, if I use the Hazen-Williams formula, which is:

h_f = ( (10.67 * L * Q^1.852) ) / ( (C)^1.852 * d^4.87 )

So, rearranging for d, because I need to find the diameter.

Given that h_f is 5 ft per 1000 ft, so h_f/L = 5/1000 = 0.005 ft per ft.

Wait, but maybe I should plug the numbers into the formula.

So, h_f = 5 ft, L = 1000 ft.

So, 5 = (10.67 * 1000 * Q^1.852) / ( C^1.852 * d^4.87 )

But Q is given as 3 ft³/s. Wait, no, wait, no, wait. Wait, Q is 3 ft³/s. So, yes, plug that in.

Wait, but let me write the equation correctly.

h_f = (10.67 * L * Q^1.852) / ( C^1.852 * d^4.87 )

So, rearranging for d:

d^4.87 = (10.67 * L * Q^1.852) / ( C^1.852 * h_f )

Then,

d = [ (10.67 * L * Q^1.852) / ( C^1.852 * h_f ) ]^(1/4.87)

But plugging in the numbers:

L = 1000 ft,

Q = 3 ft³/s,

h_f = 5 ft,

C = 120 (I'll go with 120 for galvanized iron).

So,

d^4.87 = (10.67 * 1000 * (3)^1.852) / (120^1.852 * 5 )

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 3^1.852. Let me approximate that.

3^1 =3, 3^2=9. 1.852 is between 1 and 2, closer to 2.

Using logarithm: ln(3) ≈1.0986, so 1.852 * ln(3) = 1.852 *1.0986≈ 2.033, so e^2.033≈7.62. So 3^1.852≈7.62.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a better way.

Alternatively, 3^1.852 is approximately 3^(1+0.852) = 3 * 3^0.852.

3^0.852: since 3^0.85 is about 3^(17/20). Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach, but I'm just approximating here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that 3^1.852 is approximately 7.62.

So, 10.67 * 1000 = 10670.

Multiply by 7.62: 10670 *7.62.

Let me compute 10,000*7.62=76,200, and 670*7.62≈5,105.4, so total is 76,200 +5,105.4=81,305.4.

So numerator so far is 81,305.4.

Denominator: 120^1.852 *5.

Compute 120^1.852.

Again, using logarithm:

ln(120)=4.7875, so 1.852 *4.7875≈8.876.

e^8.876≈7180 (since e^8≈2980, e^9≈8103; 8.876 is close to 9, maybe around 7180? Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

But maybe a better approach is to compute 120^1.852.

Alternatively, 120^1.852 = e^(1.852 * ln(120)).

ln(120)=4.7875, so 1.852 *4.7875≈8.876.

e^8.876 ≈7180? Let me check: e^8 is approximately 2980. e^0.876 is about 2.407 (since ln(2)=0.693, ln(2.4)=0.8755). So e^8.876≈2980 *2.407≈7180.

So 120^1.852≈7180.

Then denominator is 7180 *5 =35,900.

So, d^4.87 = 81,305.4 / 35,900 ≈2.265.

So, d^4.87=2.265.

Now, take both sides to the power of 1/4.87.

So, d = (2.265)^(1/4.87).

Hmm, what's 2.265 to the power of approximately 1/4.87.

Since 4.87 is about 5, so 1/5 is 0.2.

So, 2.265^0.2.

What is 2^0.2? 2^(1/5) is the fifth root of 2, which is approximately 1.1487.

Similarly, 2.265 is a bit larger than 2, so fifth root would be a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute ln(2.265) ≈0.817.

So, 0.817 * (1/4.87)≈0.817/4.87≈0.1676.

e^0.1676≈1.182.

So, d≈1.182 feet.

Wait, but that's about 1.18 ft, which is 14.16 inches. Hmm, but looking at the options, option E is 0.926 ft, which is about 11.11 inches. Option B is 0.965 ft (about 11.58 inches). Option G is 0.75 ft (9 inches). Option E is 0.926, which is close to 11 inches.

Wait, but my calculation gave me about 1.18 ft, which isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me go through it again.

So, the formula is h_f = (10.67 * L * Q^1.852) / ( C^1.852 * d^4.87 )

We have h_f =5 ft, L=1000 ft, Q=3 ft³/s, C=120.

Rearranged to solve for d:

d^4.87 = (10.67 * L * Q^1.852) / ( C^1.852 * h_f )

So, numerator is 10.67 *1000 *3^1.852.

Denominator is 120^1.852 *5.

So, 10.67 *1000 =10,670.

3^1.852≈7.62, so 10,670 *7.62≈81,305.4.

Denominator: 120^1.852. As before, that's about 7180, multiplied by 5 is 35,900.

So, d^4.87 =81,305.4 /35,900 ≈2.265.

Then, d = (2.265)^(1/4.87).

Wait, 4.87 is approximately 4.87, so 1/4.87≈0.205.

So, 2.265^0.205.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

The natural logarithm of 2.265 is about 0.817.

So, 0.817 *0.205≈0.1675.

e^0.1675≈1.182.

So, d≈1.182 ft, which is about 14.16 inches.

But looking at the options, the closest is option B: 0.965 ft, which is about 11.58 inches. But that's significantly smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong value for C in the Hazen-Williams equation. Maybe galvanized iron has a different C value. Let me think: I thought C=120, but maybe it's 100 or 110.

Wait, I should double-check. From what I remember, Hazen-Williams C values: for new, clean galvanized iron, C is around 120. But maybe in this problem, it's taken as 100. Or perhaps I confused it with another pipe material.

If I try C=100, let's see what happens.

So, denominator becomes 100^1.852 *5.

100^1.852 =100^1 *100^0.852=100 * (10^0.852).

Wait, 10^0.852≈7.12, so 100^0.852≈712.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 100^0.852 is (10^2)^0.852 =10^(1.704)= about 50.3.

Wait, wait, no, 100^0.852 is e^(0.852 * ln(100)).

ln(100)=4.605, so 0.852 *4.605≈3.92.

e^3.92≈50.3.

So, 100^1.852 =100^1 * 100^0.852=100 *50.3=5030.

So denominator is 5030 *5=25,150.

So, d^4.87 =81,305.4 /25,150≈3.233.

Then, d =3.233^(1/4.87).

Compute 3.233^(1/4.87).

Again, 1/4.87≈0.205.

ln(3.233)=1.174.

1.174 *0.205≈0.2407.

e^0.2407≈1.272.

So, d≈1.272 ft, which is even larger than before. So that's not matching any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Darcy-Weisbach equation instead, but I don't know the friction factor. Alternatively, maybe I can use the Chezy formula, but that also requires knowing something about roughness.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives the pressure loss as 5 ft per 1000 ft. So, the head loss per foot of pipe is 5/1000 = 0.005 ft/ft.

Alternatively, the head loss gradient is h_f/L = 0.005.

In the Darcy equation, h_f/L = (f v^2)/(2g d).

So, h_f/L = (f v²)/(2g d).

We can solve for f, but without more info, that's tricky. Alternatively, if we can express v in terms of Q and d.

Because Q = A v, and A = π d²/4.

So, v=Q/(π d²/4) = (4 Q)/(π d²).

Substituting into the equation:

h_f/L = (f ( (4 Q)/(π d²) )² )/(2 g d )

Simplify:

h_f/L = f (16 Q²) / (π² d^4 * 2 g d ) )

Wait, that's f*(16 Q²) / (2 g π² d^5 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(16 / 2 )=8, so 8 f Q² / (g π² d^5 )

So, h_f/L = (8 f Q²) / (g π² d^5 )

We can rearrange this to solve for d:

d^5 = (8 f Q²) / (g π² (h_f/L) )

Thus,

d = [ (8 f Q² ) / (g π² (h_f/L) ) ]^(1/5)

Now, plugging in the known values:

h_f/L = 0.005 ft/ft,

Q =3 ft³/s,

g=32.2 ft/s².

But we don't know f, the friction factor. Hmm. So, perhaps I need to relate f to the pipe's roughness.

Wait, for galvanized iron pipes, the roughness coefficient (epsilon) is about 0.0005 ft. Then, using the Colebrook equation or Moody diagram to find f.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the Manning equation, but that's for open channels, not pipes under pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for head loss in terms of velocity and diameter, with an assumption about the friction factor.

Wait, but maybe I should try to find velocity first.

Wait, another thought: since the problem gives the flow rate, maybe I can find the diameter using the formula Q = A v, and then relate velocity to head loss.

But without knowing velocity, that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using the formula for flow velocity in a pipe with a given head loss.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the hydraulic gradient (head loss per unit length), which is S = h_f/L = (f v²)/(2g d).

But again, without knowing f, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps in this problem, it's intended to use the Hazen-Williams equation with a certain C value, and maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Let me try the calculation again with C=120.

So,

d^4.87 = (10.67 * L * Q^1.852) / (C^1.852 * h_f )

Plugging in:

L=1000 ft,

Q=3 ft³/s,

h_f=5 ft,

C=120.

So,

10.67*1000=10670.

3^1.852≈7.62 (as before).

So, 10670 *7.62≈81,305.4.

Denominator: 120^1.852≈ (120^1)*(120^0.852).

120^1=120.

120^0.852: Let me compute that.

ln(120)=4.7875.

0.852 *4.7875≈4.083.

e^4.083≈59.9.

So, 120^0.852≈59.9.

Thus, 120^1.852=120 *59.9≈7188.

Multiply by h_f=5: 7188*5=35,940.

So, d^4.87 =81,305.4 /35,940≈2.263.

Then, d= (2.263)^(1/4.87).

Compute 1/4.87≈0.205.

So,
