Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the change in Gibbs energy for ethanol when the pressure is increased. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that Gibbs energy change for a process at constant temperature is given by the equation ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, no, wait. Oh right, that's when the process is at constant T and it's a reversible process. But wait, ethanol is a liquid, right? So maybe it's a solid or liquid. Oh wait, solids and liquids have negligible volume changes, so maybe their Gibbs energy change when pressure changes is calculated differently. 

Wait, another approach: for a solid or liquid, the molar Gibbs energy change when pressure increases is ΔG = V * (P2 - P1), where V is the molar volume. Because for solids and liquids, the volume doesn't change much with pressure, so the approximation is used. So maybe I should use that formula instead of the ideal gas one.

Okay, so the steps I need to follow are:

1. Find the number of moles of ethanol.
2. Calculate the molar volume of ethanol.
3. Use ΔG = n * V * (P2 - P1).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. The formula for Gibbs free energy change when pressure changes for a solid or liquid is ΔG = nVΔP. Because for solids and liquids, dG = V dP at constant T, so integrating that gives ΔG = VΔP * n. But wait, in which units? Because pressure is in atm, but I need to convert it to Pascals maybe, since standard units are SI.

Wait, ethanol's molar volume is needed. The density is given as 0.789 g/cm³. So density is mass over volume. Molar mass of ethanol is C2H5OH, which is (2*12) + (6*1) + 16 + 1 = 24 +6 +16 +1 = 47 g/mol.

So moles of ethanol is mass divided by molar mass. The given mass is 35 g. So 35g /47 g/mol ≈ 0.745 moles.

Wait, wait, let me calculate more accurately: 35 /47. Let's do exact division. 47*0.7 is 32.9. 35-32.9=2.1. So 0.7 + (2.1/47). 2.1/47 is about 0.0447. So total n = 0.7447 mol, approximately 0.745 moles.

Next, molar volume. Density is 0.789 g/cm³. Molar volume Vm = molar mass / density. But wait, units: density is g/cm³, so Vm would be in cm³/mol.

So Vm = 47 g/mol / 0.789 g/cm³. Let me compute that. 47 / 0.789 ≈ let's see, 47 *1.27 is about 60. So maybe around 59.6 cm³/mol. Wait, exact calculation: 47 / 0.789.

Let me compute 0.789 * 60 = 47.34, which is just over 47. So 47 /0.789 is approximately 59.57 cm³/mol. So about 59.57 cm³/mol.

But wait, I need it in m³ to use in SI units. Because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So Vm = 59.57e-6 m³/mol.

Now, the pressure change ΔP is 3000 atm - 1 atm = 2999 atm. But I need to convert this to Pascals because in SI units, pressure is in Pa.

1 atm = 101325 Pa. So 2999 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = let's compute that. Hmm, 3000 atm is 3e3 * 101325 = 3,038,775,000 Pa? Wait, no, wait. 1e3 * 101325 is 101,325,000. So 3e3 would be 303,975,000 Pa. But since it's 2999 atm, subtract 1 atm in Pa.

Wait, 2999 atm = (3000 -1) atm. So 3000 atm is 3e3 * 101325 = 3,038,775,000 Pa? Wait, wait, 101325 * 3 = 303,975; so 101325 *3000 = 303,975,000 Pa. Then subtract 101325 Pa (1 atm) to get 2999 atm in Pa.

So 303,975,000 - 101,325 = 303,975,000 - 100,000 is 303,875,000; subtract another 1325 → 303,875,000 -1,325 = 303,873,675 Pa. So ΔP ≈ 303,873,675 Pa.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should just approximate it as 3000 atm * 101325 ≈ 3e3 * 1e5 = 3e8 Pa, but perhaps exact calculation isn't necessary. Let me proceed with the exact figure for now.

Now, putting it all together:

ΔG = n * Vm * ΔP

n is approximately 0.7447 mol.

Vm is 59.57e-6 m³/mol.

ΔP is approximately 303,873,675 Pa.

So:

ΔG = 0.7447 * 59.57e-6 m³/mol * 303,873,675 Pa.

Let me compute each part.

First, compute 59.57e-6 * 303,873,675.

59.57e-6 is 5.957e-5.

So 5.957e-5 * 3.03873675e8 → let's see, 5.957e-5 * 3.0387e8 = 

Multiply 5.957 *3.0387 ≈ let's compute that: 5 *3 is 15, 5 *0.0387 is ~0.1935, 0.957 *3 is ~2.871, 0.957 *0.0387 is ~0.037. So adding all together: 15 +0.1935=15.1935; 2.871 + 0.037=2.908. Total 15.1935 + 2.908=18.1015. So approximately 18.1015.

But since it's 5.957e-5 *3.0387e8 = (5.957 *3.0387e3) *1e-5 *1e8 → wait, no, 1e-5 *1e8 is 1e3. So 5.957 *3.0387 ≈ 18.1, then multiply by 1e3 → 18.1 *1e3 = 18,100.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 3.0387e8 *5.957e-5.

3.0387e8 = 3.0387 *1e8.

5.957e-5 = 5.957 *1e-5.

Multiply them: (3.0387 *5.957) * (1e8 *1e-5) → (3.0387 *5.957) *1e3.

Compute 3.0387 *5.957:

3 *5.957 is 17.871.

0.0387 *5.957 ≈ 0.0387 *6 = 0.2322, but a bit less. Let's say approximately 0.2305.

So total 17.871 + 0.2305 = 18.1015.

Multiply by 1e3 → 18,101.5 J/mol.

Wait, but that's per mole. So now multiply by n=0.7447.

So ΔG = 0.7447 * 18,101.5 J.

Let me calculate that:

0.7 *18,101 = 12,670.7

0.0447 *18,101 ≈ let's compute 0.04 *18,101 = 724.04; 0.0047 *18,101 ≈ 85.47. So total 724.04 +85.47 = 809.51.

So 12,670.7 +809.51 = 13,480.21 J.

Approximately 13,480 J, which is about 13.48 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the options are 5,8,10,12, etc. The closest option is H:12 kJ. But my calculation is about 13.48, which would round to 13, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculations again. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, Vm is 59.57e-6 m³/mol. That's correct because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³.

ΔP is 2999 atm. So 2999 *101325 = let's compute exactly.

101325 * 2999 = compute 101325 * 3000 = 303,975,000. Then subtract 101325 from that, so 303,975,000 -101,325 = 303,873,675 Pa. So that's correct.

So Vm * ΔP = 59.57e-6 m³/mol * 303,873,675 Pa.

Let me compute 59.57e-6 *303,873,675.

59.57e-6 = 0.00005957.

0.00005957 * 303,873,675 = ?

Compute 303,873,675 * 0.00005957.

Compute 303,873,675 * 5.957e-5.

Hmm, alternatively, 303,873,675 *5.957e-5 = ?

Well, 303,873,675 *5.957e-5 = (303,873,675 *5.957) * 1e-5.

Let me compute 303,873,675 *5.957 first.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me see:

Approximately, 300,000,000 *6 = 1,800,000,000. But let's compute accurately.

303,873,675 *5 = 1,519,368,375.

303,873,675 *0.957 = ?

Compute 303,873,675 *0.9 = 273,486,207.5

303,873,675 *0.05 = 15,193,683.75

303,873,675 *0.007 = 2,127,115.725

Add them together: 273,486,207.5 +15,193,683.75 = 288,679,891.25 +2,127,115.725 = 290,807,006.975.

So total 5.957 is 5 +0.957, so 1,519,368,375 +290,807,006.975 = 1,810,175,381.975.

Now multiply by 1e-5: 1,810,175,381.975 *1e-5 = 181,017.538... J/mol.

So Vm * ΔP = 181,017.538 J/mol.

Wait, wait, because Vm is per mole, and ΔP is in Pa (which is N/m²), so Vm (m³/mol) * ΔP (N/m²) → m³ * N/m² = N*m = J. So yes, per mole, VΔP is 181,017 J/mol.

So now, multiply by n=0.7447 mol.

ΔG = 0.7447 * 181,017 J.

Compute 0.7 *181,017 = 126,711.9 J.

0.0447 *181,017 ≈ let's compute 0.04 *181,017 =7,240.68, and 0.0047 *181,017≈851.58.

So 7,240.68 +851.58 ≈8,092.26 J.

So total ΔG ≈126,711.9 +8,092.26 ≈134,804 J.

Which is approximately 134.8 kJ.

Wait, that's a big number, but the options don't have that. Wait, that can't be right. Because earlier I thought the calculation was around 13 kJ, but now it's 134 kJ. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait a minute. Oh no, wait, the formula I used was ΔG = n V ΔP. But wait, no, that would be the case for a solid or liquid, but another thing: Gibbs energy for a process where pressure increases is ΔG = V (P2 - P1). But wait, for a solid or liquid, it's assumed that V is constant, so yes. But wait, maybe I used the wrong formula.

Wait, another thought: for a solid or liquid, the Gibbs energy change when pressure increases is given by ΔG = n V (P2 - P1), where V is the molar volume. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, when I computed n V ΔP as 0.7447 *59.57e-6 * 303,873,675, I got 134,804 J, which is 134.8 kJ. None of the options are near 135 kJ. The highest option is G:30 kJ.

So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me retrace. Maybe the formula isn't ΔG = n V ΔP, but perhaps ΔG = V ΔP? Because for a given amount, say n moles, the total volume is nV. So the work done would be PΔV, but when pressure increases, for a solid or liquid, ΔV is negligible, so dG = V dP. So for a finite change, ΔG = V (P2 - P1). But that's per mole, perhaps.

Wait, no, for n moles, the total volume is nV, so the ΔG would be nV (P2 - P1).

Wait, but another approach: the Gibbs free energy change when pressure changes is given by ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) for an ideal gas. But ethanol is a liquid, so that formula doesn't apply. Instead, for liquids, the change is approximately ΔG = V (P2 - P1), where V is the molar volume.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should have used V in terms of m³ and ΔP in Pa.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, n is 0.7447 mol.

Vm is 59.57 cm³/mol =59.57e-6 m³/mol.

ΔP is (3000 -1) atm = 2999 atm.

But wait, perhaps I should compute ΔG as n * Vm * (P2 - P1), but P2 and P1 are in the same units as used in the equation. Wait, but in the formula ΔG = n V (P2 - P1), the pressure units must be in Pascals because V is in m³ and Pa is N/m², so V * ΔP gives J.

So I think I did it right. But why am I getting 135 kJ, which isn't an option?

Hmm, looking at the options, the highest is G:30 kJ. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the molar volume calculation. Let me check that.

Molar mass of ethanol is 47 g/mol. Density is 0.789 g/cm³.

Vm = molar mass / density = 47 g/mol / 0.789 g/cm³ = 47 /0.789 cm³/mol.

47 divided by 0.789 = let's calculate accurately.

0.789 * 59 = 46.491 → which is just under 47.

0.789 *59.5 = 59 *0.789 =46.491, 0.5 *0.789=0.3945 → total 46.8855.

Still under 47. 0.789 *59.57 → 59*0.789 =46.491, 0.57 *0.789≈0.449, total ≈46.94. So 59.57 cm³/mol is correct.

So that's correct. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the formula isn't ΔG = n V ΔP, but instead, for solids and liquids, the Gibbs energy change is ΔG = V T (ΔP), but I don't think so. Wait, no, it's ΔG = V ΔP at constant T.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing enthalpy and Gibbs energy. For Gibbs energy at constant T, yes, dG = V dP. So integrating gives ΔG = V (P2 - P1).

Hmm, but if that's correct, then why am I getting 135 kJ, which isn't an option.

Wait, let me consider if ethanol is a gas under these conditions. Because if the pressure is 3000 atm, maybe ethanol becomes a gas. But no, ethanol at 298 K and 3000 atm is still a liquid because its critical point is much lower than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the ideal gas law, but ethanol isn't a gas here.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of Vm. Let me compute Vm again.

Density ρ = 0.789 g/cm³.

Molar mass M = 47 g/mol.

Vm = M / ρ = 47 / 0.789 cm³/mol.

47 /0.789 ≈ 59.57 cm³/mol. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units when calculating Vm * ΔP.

Wait, 59.57e-6 m³/mol * 303,873,675 Pa.

Compute 59.57e-6 * 303,873,675.

So 59.57e-6 = 5.957e-5.

5.957e-5 * 3.03873675e8 = 5.957 *3.03873675e( -5 +8 )=5.957 *3.03873675e3.

5.957 *3.03873675 = let me compute that accurately.

5 *3.0387 =15.1935.

0.957 *3.0387 ≈ approx 2.908.

So total 15.1935 +2.908 =18.1015. So 18.1015 *1e3 =18,101.5 J/mol.

So yes, that's correct. So n V ΔP =
