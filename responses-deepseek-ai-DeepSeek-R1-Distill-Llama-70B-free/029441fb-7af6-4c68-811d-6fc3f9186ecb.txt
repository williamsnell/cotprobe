Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Burgess's concentric zone model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the concentric zone model was developed by E.W. Burgess in 1925. It's one of the earlier models trying to explain the structure of cities. The model divides the city into five concentric zones, starting from the central business district and moving outward.

Let me list the zones as I recall them. The first zone is the Central Business District (CBD). That's where all the main businesses, offices, and shops are. Then, moving outward, the next zone is the Transitional zone. I think this is where a lot of the industrial activities happen, maybe some older housing that's run down. But wait, isn't that where the lower-income housing is too? Like, maybe some slums or ethnic ghettos?

Wait, no, I might be mixing it up. Let me think again. After the CBD comes the Transitional area, which is Zone II. Then comes the Working-class residential zone, which is Zone III. Then there's the Middle-class residential (Zone IV), and finally the commuter zone (Zone V), which is the outermost part with more affluent suburbs.

But the question is about low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration. So where would that be? The Transitional zone, which is Zone II, is near the CBD. I think that's where industries are, and perhaps where the poorer people live because they can't afford better housing. So Zone II would have slums and ethnic areas because it's close to where they might work, like in factories or low-paying jobs.

Wait, but I also remember something about Zone I being the CBD and Zone II being the transitional. So the transitional zone is right next to the CBD. That makes sense because as you move away from the center, the land uses change. So the area just outside the CBD is where the poorer residents might live because land is cheaper there but still close to their jobs.

So the question is asking which zone contains these low-income areas. The options are A: Outermost, which would be Zone V. B: Third, which is Zone III. C: First, which is the CBD. D: Transitional, which is Zone II. E: Fifth, which is Zone V. F: Middle, I'm not sure. G: Fourth, which is Zone IV. H: Second, which is Zone II. I: Sixth... but I don't think there is a sixth zone in the model.

Wait, looking at the options, the choices are labeled as A to I, but the zones are numbered. So the zones are:

Zone I: CBD
Zone II: Transitional
Zone III: Working-class
Zone IV: Middle-class
Zone V: Commuter

So the question is which zone has the low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, etc. That's the Transitional zone, which is Zone II. So looking at the options, D is "Transitional" and H is "Second". Since Zone II is the second zone, the answer would be H: Second.

Wait, no, let me check the options again. The options are:

A: Outermost
B: Third
C: First
D: Transitional
E: Fifth
F: Middle
G: Fourth
H: Second
I: Sixth

So the Transitional zone is option D, which is Zone II. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the zones are referred to by their number. So the second zone is the Transitional, so option H is Second, which is correct.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "which zone contains...", and the options include both the name (like "Transitional") and the number (like "Second"). So D is Transitional, which is correct, but H is Second, which is also correct. But wait, in the model, the zones are numbered I to V, so the second zone is Transitional.

Wait, the options don't have I as in Roman numeral I, but as the first choice. So the correct answer would be D: Transitional, which is Zone II. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the model is presented with the zones as first, second, etc. So the second zone is the Transitional area.

Wait, but the question is asking for the zone. So the options include both the name and the number. So the answer could be D or H. But I think the correct way is that the Transitional zone is the second zone, so H: Second.

Alternatively, the options might have "Transitional" as an option, which is D. So I'm a bit torn. Let me think again.

In the concentric zone model, the zones are:

1. Central Business District (CBD) â€“ Zone I
2. Transitional (Zone II)
3. Working-class residential (Zone III)
4. Middle-class residential (Zone IV)
5. Commuter zone (Zone V)

So the Transitional zone is Zone II, which is the second zone. Therefore, the answer is H: Second.

Wait, but the options have D as "Transitional". So if the question is asking which zone, and the options include the name, then D would be correct. Alternatively, if the options are about the position (like first, second), then H is correct.

Wait, looking back at the question: "Which zone contains...". The options are A to J, and the possible answers are listed as options. So in the options, D is labeled "Transitional". So the correct answer would be D.

But wait, some sources might refer to the zones by their number, so Zone II is the second, which is H. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the way the question is phrased, it's asking which zone, and the options are a mix of both names and positions. So "Transitional" is the correct name of the zone, so the answer is D. But I'm not 100% sure because sometimes the second zone is called the Transitional, so H would be correct.

Wait, let me think of the structure again. CBD is Zone I, Transitional is Zone II, so Zone II is the second zone. So in the options, H is "Second", which refers to Zone II, the Transitional zone.

So the answer should be H: Second.

Wait, but in the options, D is "Transitional", which is Zone II. So if the question is asking for the name, D is correct. But the question is asking which zone, and the options include both names and numbers. So which is more accurate?

I think the model refers to them by their zones as I, II, III, etc., so the second zone is the Transitional. Therefore, the answer is H: Second.

Wait, but the options also have "Transitional" as option D. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall: in the model, the zones are numbered, and each has a specific characteristic. The second zone is the Transitional area, which includes the slums and ethnic ghettos. So the correct answer would be the second zone, which is option H.

Alternatively, the Transitional is the name, so D is correct.

Wait, perhaps in the options, the correct answer is H: Second. Because the question is about the zone number, but the options include both. Or perhaps the options are labeled as the zone's position, like first, second, etc.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: Second. Because the second zone is the Transitional.

Alternatively, looking for online resources, the second zone in Burgess's model is the zone of transition, which includes the slums and ethnic areas. Therefore, the correct answer is the second zone, which is option H.

The concentric zone model, developed by E.W. Burgess in 1925, divides a city into five zones, each with distinct characteristics. The question asks which zone contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration. 

1. **Zone I**: Central Business District (CBD) - This is the economic and commercial heart of the city, not associated with slums or ghettos.  
2. **Zone II**: Transitional Zone - Located just outside the CBD, this zone is characterized by industrial activities, older housing, and areas of deterioration, including low-income slums and ethnic ghettos.  
3. **Zone III**: Working-class Residential Zone - This zone is primarily for working-class housing and does not match the description in the question.  
4. **Zone IV**: Middle-class Residential Zone - This zone is for middle-class housing and is more affluent.  
5. **Zone V**: Commuter Zone - The outermost zone, characterized by suburban areas and commuter communities, which is unrelated to the question.  

The Transitional Zone (Zone II) is the correct answer because it is the area where low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration are found. The options include both the name of the zone ("Transitional") and its position ("Second"). Since the question asks for the zone, and "Second" corresponds to Zone II, the correct answer is **H: Second**.

Answer: H
