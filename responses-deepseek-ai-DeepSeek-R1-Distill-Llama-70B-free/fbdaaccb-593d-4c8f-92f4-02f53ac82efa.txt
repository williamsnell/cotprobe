Question:

Prior to the late 20th century the role of women in war had been neglected as an area of concern in security studies, for what reason?

Options:

A: Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security.
B: The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.
C: The role of women was given appropriate consideration; women have fulfilled many vital roles in the support of the dominant security system.
D: Women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to engage in anti-war or opposition movements, rendering their contribution to the study of warfare as marginal.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about why the role of women in war was neglected in security studies before the late 20th century. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the reason behind the neglect. The options are A through D, each giving a different reason. I need to figure out which one is correct based on my knowledge.

First, I remember that traditional security studies have been pretty male-dominated. They often focus on state-level issues, military actions, and maybe not so much on the social aspects or gender roles. So women's roles might have been overlooked because they weren't seen as active participants in combat or high-level decision-making.

Looking at the options:

Option A says women didn't engage in warfare as combatants, so gender wasn't important. I think this might be part of it. If the focus was on combatants and women weren't seen as such, then their roles wouldn't be studied. But wait, women have always played roles in wars, like nurses, spies, or supporting roles, even if not as frontline soldiers. So maybe this is too narrow.

Option B suggests that women's roles were framed in terms of their effect on the state rather than as individuals. That sounds familiar. I've heard that security studies often prioritize state security over human security. So if women's roles were only considered in how they affected the state (like maintaining morale or being victims), their individual experiences or contributions as women might have been ignored. This seems plausible because it's a more structural reason rather than just absence.

Option C claims women's roles were appropriately considered, which I don't think is right. The question states that the role was neglected, so C is probably incorrect.

Option D says women are unsupportive of warfare and thus their contributions were marginal. I don't think that's accurate. Women have participated in various ways, including in anti-war movements, but that doesn't explain why their roles in war were neglected in studies. It might be a factor, but I'm not sure if it's the main reason.

So now I'm considering between A and B. Option A is about not being combatants, but maybe the neglect was more about how their roles were conceptualized in the framework of security studies. If the field focused on state-centric views, then women's roles as individuals or their gendered experiences weren't considered important. So Option B points out that the focus was on the effect on the state, not on women themselves.

I think Option B is the correct answer because it's about the framework of analysis rather than just the absence of women in combat. The reasoning aligns with feminist critiques in security studies, which argue that traditional approaches ignore gendered experiences and focus on state-level issues.

The correct answer is:

B: The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.

Answer: B
