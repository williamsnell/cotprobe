Okay, so I need to find the inverse of the function f(x) = 4 - 5x. Hmm, I remember that to find an inverse function, you basically switch the roles of x and y and then solve for y again. Let me try to recall the exact steps.

So, first, I should write the function as y = 4 - 5x. Then, to find the inverse, I'll swap x and y, making it x = 4 - 5y. Now, I need to solve this equation for y.

Let me do that step by step. Starting with x = 4 - 5y. I need to isolate y. So, subtract 4 from both sides: x - 4 = -5y. Then, divide both sides by -5 to get y by itself. That gives y = (x - 4)/(-5), which simplifies to y = (4 - x)/5. Wait, because (x-4)/-5 is the same as (4 - x)/5. Oh right, because the negative can flip the numerator.

Wait, let me double-check that algebra. If I have x = 4 - 5y, then subtract 4: x -4 = -5y. Divide both sides by -5: y = (x-4)/(-5). Which can also be written as y = (4 - x)/5 because when you factor out a negative from the denominator, it flips the sign in the numerator.

So the inverse function f⁻¹(x) is (4 - x)/5. Let me look at the options given.

Option A is (x-4)/5. That's different from mine. Option D is the same as A. Option F is -(x-4)/5, which would be (-x +4)/5, same as (4 - x)/5. Oh wait, because (x-4) is negative times (4 - x). So option F is (4 - x)/5. So that's the same as what I got.

Wait another option: Option J is (4 - x)/-5. Wait, that's (4 - x)/-5, which is the same as (x -4)/5. So that's not the same as my solution. Because my solution was (4 -x)/5, which is the same as option F.

Wait, let me recheck the options:

Option F: - (x -4)/5 → which is (-x +4)/5 → (4 - x)/5.

Yes, that matches what I found.

So the inverse function is (4 - x)/5, which is option F.

To find the inverse of the function \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \), we start by writing the function as \( y = 4 - 5x \). To find the inverse, we swap \( x \) and \( y \), resulting in \( x = 4 - 5y \). Solving for \( y \):

1. Subtract 4 from both sides:  
   \[
   x - 4 = -5y
   \]

2. Divide both sides by \(-5\):  
   \[
   y = \frac{x - 4}{-5} = \frac{4 - x}{5}
   \]

Thus, the inverse function is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{4 - x}{5} \).

Examining the options, this matches **Option F**, which is written as \( -\frac{x - 4}{5} \). Simplifying, \( -\frac{x - 4}{5} = \frac{4 - x}{5} \), confirming that the correct answer is:

**F**

Answer: F
