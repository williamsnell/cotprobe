Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. Alright, the problem says that air is approximately 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen on a mole basis. Then, we're adding 4.0 grams of hydrogen to a 22.4-liter flask. The flask is at 0 degrees Celsius and initially filled with air at 1 atm pressure. The question is asking for the molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture.

Hmm, molecular weight of the mixture. I think that refers to the average molar mass of all the gases present. Right, because each gas contributes to the total moles, and the average would be the total mass divided by the total moles.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I should probably find out how many moles of each component are in the flask initially and then after adding hydrogen.

Wait, the flask is initially filled with air at 1 atm. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. At 0°C, which is 273 K, and volume is 22.4 liters. So pressure is 1 atm.

So for the initial air, n_air = (P V)/(R T). Let me calculate that. Oh wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), right? Let me plug in the numbers: (1 atm * 22.4 L) / (0.0821 * 273). Let me compute that.

Wait, 22.4 divided by (0.0821 * 273). Let me calculate the denominator first: 0.0821 * 273 is approximately 22.4. Oh wait, 0.0821 * 273 = around 22.4 (since 0.0821 * 273 = 22.4). So 22.4 / 22.4 is 1. So n_air is 1 mole. Oh, right, because 22.4 liters at 0°C and 1 atm is exactly 1 mole. That's a common value to remember.

So the initial air is 1 mole, and it's 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen. So moles of N2 = 0.8 * 1 = 0.8 moles, and O2 is 0.2 moles.

Then, we add 4.0 grams of hydrogen. Hydrogen's molar mass is about 2 g/mol. So 4.0 g / 2 g/mol = 2 moles of H2 added.

So now, the total moles in the flask will be initial moles plus the added H2. So 1 (air) + 2 (H2) = 3 moles total.

Wait, but wait a second. When you add H2 to the flask, does the pressure change? Because the flask's volume and temperature are constant, adding more gas would increase the pressure. But the question is about the average molecular weight of the mixture. Hmm. Wait, but perhaps I don't need to worry about the pressure because the problem is only about the molar masses and the total moles. Because the average molecular weight is (total mass) / (total moles).

So perhaps I should compute the total mass of all gases in the flask after adding H2.

Right, because average molar mass (M_avg) is equal to (mass of air + mass of H2) / (moles of air + moles of H2).

Let me compute each part.

First, the mass of air. Air is 1 mole total, 0.8 moles N2 and 0.2 moles O2.

Molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol (14*2), O2 is 32 g/mol (16*2).

So mass of air = (0.8 *28) + (0.2 *32) = let's calculate that.

0.8 *28 = 22.4, 0.2 *32 = 6.4. So total is 22.4 + 6.4 = 28.8 grams.

Mass of H2 added is 4.0 grams.

So total mass is 28.8 +4.0 = 32.8 grams.

Total moles is 1 (air) + 2 (H2) = 3 moles.

So M_avg = 32.8 g / 3 moles = approximately 10.933... g/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 10.9. So that's close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of H2. Let me recalculate.

Hydrogen is H2, so each molecule is 2 H atoms. The molar mass is 2 g/mol. So 4 grams is 4 /2 = 2 moles of H2. That's correct.

Total moles: 1 (air) + 2 (H2) =3. Correct.

Mass of air: 0.8 *28 =22.4, 0.2 *32 =6.4. Sum 28.8. Correct.

Total mass: 28.8 +4=32.8 grams. Correct.

So 32.8 /3 = 10.933, which is approximately 10.9. So option J is 10.9, which would be the answer.

Wait, but another thought: when you add hydrogen to the flask, if it's at constant volume and temperature, the pressure increases. But does that affect the moles? Or is the initial pressure 1 atm, and adding gas would change the pressure, but the moles would just be additive?

Wait, the problem says the flask is 'maintained' at 0°C. So temperature is fixed. The initial pressure is 1 atm. When we add H2, the pressure would increase because the volume is fixed and temperature is fixed, so pressure is proportional to moles (from PV =nRT). But since the question is about the average molecular weight, which is based on the total mass and total moles, perhaps the pressure change doesn't affect the calculation. Because the average molar mass is just (mass of all gases) / (moles of all gases), regardless of pressure.

So my approach seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be J:10.9.

To determine the molecular weight (average molar mass) of the hydrogen-air mixture, we calculate the total mass and total moles of all gases in the flask.

1. **Initial moles of air**:  
   The flask is initially filled with air at 1 atm, 0°C (273 K), and 22.4 L. Using the ideal gas law, \( n_{\text{air}} = \frac{PV}{RT} \), where \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{air}} = \frac{(1 \, \text{atm})(22.4 \, \text{L})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(273 \, \text{K})} = 1 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   Air is 80% nitrogen (\( \text{N}_2 \)) and 20% oxygen (\( \text{O}_2 \)), so:  
   \[
   n_{\text{N}_2} = 0.8 \, \text{mol}, \quad n_{\text{O}_2} = 0.2 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Mass of air**:  
   The molar masses of \( \text{N}_2 \) and \( \text{O}_2 \) are 28 g/mol and 32 g/mol, respectively. The total mass of air is:  
   \[
   m_{\text{air}} = (0.8 \, \text{mol})(28 \, \text{g/mol}) + (0.2 \, \text{mol})(32 \, \text{g/mol}) = 22.4 \, \text{g} + 6.4 \, \text{g} = 28.8 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Moles of hydrogen added**:  
   The mass of hydrogen added is 4.0 g, and its molar mass is 2 g/mol. Thus:  
   \[
   n_{\text{H}_2} = \frac{4.0 \, \text{g}}{2 \, \text{g/mol}} = 2 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Total moles and total mass**:  
   The total moles in the flask are:  
   \[
   n_{\text{total}} = n_{\text{air}} + n_{\text{H}_2} = 1 \, \text{mol} + 2 \, \text{mol} = 3 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   The total mass is:  
   \[
   m_{\text{total}} = m_{\text{air}} + m_{\text{H}_2} = 28.8 \, \text{g} + 4.0 \, \text{g} = 32.8 \, \text{g}.
   \]

5. **Average molecular weight**:  
   The average molecular weight is the total mass divided by the total moles:  
   \[
   M_{\text{avg}} = \frac{m_{\text{total}}}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{32.8 \, \text{g}}{3 \, \text{mol}} \approx 10.9 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

Thus, the molecular weight of the hydrogen-air mixture is approximately **10.9 g/mol**, corresponding to option **J**.
