Okay, so I have this question about the European Court of Human Rights and the 'living instrument principle.' I'm a bit rusty on my human rights law, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which case best illustrates this principle. The options are A through D. I remember that the living instrument principle means that the European Court interprets the European Convention on Human Rights in a way that evolves with society, considering current conditions and changing values over time. So the case should show the court updating its interpretation of a right to fit modern circumstances.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Golder v UK (1978). I think this case was about the right to access a court. I'm not sure if it's about evolving interpretation, but maybe. Golder was about a prisoner being denied access to a solicitor, and the court held that the right to access the court is part of Article 6. Not sure if that's a living instrument example.

Option B: A v UK (2009). Hmm, I don't recall the specifics of this case. Maybe it's about something recent? But I'm not certain how it ties to the living instrument.

Option C: Goodwin v UK (2002). Oh, right, this was about transsexuals and their right to marry. The court had previously ruled in Rees v UK (1986) that the Convention didn't require states to recognize gender changes, but in Goodwin, they changed their stance, citing the living instrument principle. They said society's understanding of trans issues had evolved, so the Convention should too. That sounds exactly like applying the living instrument.

Option D: Osman v UK (1998). I remember this was about the failure of the police to protect someone from a teacher who was stalking him, leading to a killing. The court held that there was a violation, but I think the case was more about the duty of the state to protect life and the scope of Article 2, not necessarily about evolving interpretations.

So putting it together, the living instrument principle is about dynamic interpretation. Goodwin v UK is the case where the court explicitly used this principle to overturn previous decisions, recognizing changes in societal attitudes towards transgender rights. So the correct answer should be C.

The 'living instrument principle' refers to the European Court of Human Rights' practice of interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights in a way that evolves with societal changes and contemporary values. Among the given options, the case of **Goodwin v UK (2002)** best illustrates this principle. In this case, the court reconsidered its earlier decision in **Rees v UK (1986)** and recognized the right of transgender individuals to legally change their gender, reflecting the evolution of societal attitudes and understanding of gender identity. This decision explicitly invoked the living instrument principle to update the Convention's interpretation in line with modern norms.

The other cases do not exemplify this principle as clearly. **Golder v UK (1978)** focused on access to courts under Article 6, **A v UK (2009)** dealt with counter-terrorism measures, and **Osman v UK (1998)** addressed state responsibility under Article 2. None of these cases involved the dynamic reinterpretation of rights in response to societal changes.

Answer: C
