Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. So, part (a) asks about the acceleration of gravity on the moon's surface compared to Earth's, given that the moon's diameter is one-quarter of Earth's and its density is two-thirds of Earth's. Then part (b) is about an astronaut's jump height on the moon compared to Earth. 

Hmm, I remember that the acceleration due to gravity on a planet's surface depends on its mass and radius. The formula is g = G*(M)/(R²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is its radius. But wait, since the problem gives me the diameter, which is one-quarter, that means the radius is also one-quarter of Earth's, right? Because diameter is twice the radius, so if diameter is 1/4, radius is 1/4 times Earth's radius.

And the density is given as two-thirds of Earth's. Density is mass per unit volume, so density ρ = M/( (4/3)π R³ ). So mass M is ρ * (4/3 π R³). 

So let me think. For Earth, g_e = G*M_e/(R_e)^2. For the moon, g_m = G*M_m/(R_m)^2. I need to find the ratio g_m/g_e.

M_m is the moon's mass, which I can express in terms of density. Let's write M_m = ρ_m * (4/3 π R_m³). Similarly, M_e = ρ_e * (4/3 π R_e³). 

So substituting into g_m/g_e:

g_m/g_e = [ (G * M_m / R_m² ) ] / [ (G * M_e / R_e² ) ) ] 
= (M_m / M_e) * (R_e² / R_m² )

But M_m/M_e = (ρ_m/ρ_e) * (R_m³ / R_e³ )

So putting it together:

g_m/g_e = (ρ_m/ρ_e) * (R_m³ / R_e³) * (R_e² / R_m² ) )

Simplifying the R terms: R_m³ / R_e³ * R_e² / R_m² = (R_m^(3-2) ) / R_e^(3-2) ) = R_m / R_e.

Wait, let me do the exponents again. R_m^3 times R_e^2 in the numerator, and R_e^3 times R_m^2 in the denominator. So R^ terms: (R_m^3 * R_e^2 ) ) / ( R_e^3 * R_m^2 ) ) = (R_m^(3-2) ) * (R_e^(2-3) )) = R_m^(1) * R_e^(-1) )= R_m / R_e.

So the ratio becomes (ρ_m/ρ_e) * (R_m/R_e )

Given that ρ_m is (2/3) ρ_e and R_m is (1/4) R_e.

Substituting:

g_m/g_e = ( (2/3) ) * ( (1/4) )

Because (2/3) * (1/4) = 2/(12) = 1/6.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, R_m is 1/4 of R_e. So R_m/R_e = 1/4.

So (2/3) * (1/4 )= 1/6. So g_m is (1/6) g_e.

Wait but looking at the options, option A says g_m is (1/6)g_e. So part (a)'s answer would be A, but wait, let me not jump yet.

Wait, let me go back. Did I make a mistake in the exponents when simplifying?

Wait, M_m/M_e is (ρ_m / ρ_e) * (R_m^3 / R_e^3 )

Then, the ratio (M_m/M_e) * (R_e^2 / R_m^2 ) 

So that's (ρ_m/ρ_e) * (R_m^3/R_e^3) * (R_e²/R_m² )

Which becomes (ρ_m/ρ_e) * (R_m^(3-2) ) * ( R_e^(2-3) ) )

Which is (ρ_m/ρ_e) * R_m^(1) * R_e^(-1) )

So that's (ρ_m/ρ_e) * (R_m / R_e )

Yes, so with ρ_m=2/3 ρ_e and R_m=1/4 R_e.

So (2/3) * (1/4 )= 2/12=1/6.

So part (a) says g_m is (1/6) g_e.

Now part (b): An astronaut can jump 2 ft vertically on Earth. How high on the Moon?

I remember that jump height is related to the gravitational acceleration. When you jump, you exert force to propel yourself upward, and your velocity at takeoff determines how high you go. The formula for maximum height is h = (v²)/(2g), where v is the takeoff velocity.

Assuming the astronaut uses the same effort, so same takeoff velocity v. So on Earth, h_e = v²/(2g_e) = 2 ft.

On the Moon, h_m = v²/(2g_m).

Since g_m is (1/6) g_e, h_m = (v²)/(2*(g_e/6)) )=6*(v²)/(2 g_e )=6 h_e.

Wait, because h_e is (v²)/(2g_e) =2 ft. So h_m =6 * h_e =6 *2 ft=12 ft.

So the jump height on the moon would be 12 ft.

Looking at the options, option A says gm is (1/6) ge and jump height 12 ft. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me go through part (b) again.

Jump height h is proportional to v²/(2g). So h is inversely proportional to g if v is the same.

So h_m = h_e * (g_e/g_m )

Because h ∝ 1/g.

Given that g_m is (1/6)g_e. So h_m =2 ft * (g_e/(g_e/6)) )=2 *6=12 ft.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option A: g_m is 1/6 ge, and 12 ft jump.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant physics principles.

### Part (a): Acceleration of Gravity on the Moon's Surface
The acceleration due to gravity on a planet's surface is given by:

\[
g = \frac{G M}{R^2}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the planet, and \( R \) is its radius. For Earth and the Moon, the ratio of their gravitational accelerations is:

\[
\frac{g_m}{g_e} = \frac{\frac{G M_m}{R_m^2}}{\frac{G M_e}{R_e^2}} = \frac{M_m}{M_e} \cdot \frac{R_e^2}{R_m^2}
\]

The mass \( M \) of a planet can be expressed in terms of its density \( \rho \) and radius \( R \):

\[
M = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3
\]

Thus, the mass ratio is:

\[
\frac{M_m}{M_e} = \frac{\rho_m}{\rho_e} \cdot \frac{R_m^3}{R_e^3}
\]

Substituting this into the gravity ratio:

\[
\frac{g_m}{g_e} = \frac{\rho_m}{\rho_e} \cdot \frac{R_m^3}{R_e^3} \cdot \frac{R_e^2}{R_m^2} = \frac{\rho_m}{\rho_e} \cdot \frac{R_m}{R_e}
\]

From the problem, the Moon's density is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of Earth's density (\( \rho_m = \frac{2}{3} \rho_e \)), and the Moon's radius is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of Earth's radius (\( R_m = \frac{1}{4} R_e \)). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{g_m}{g_e} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

Thus, \( g_m = \frac{1}{6} g_e \).

### Part (b): Jump Height on the Moon
The jump height \( h \) is related to the takeoff velocity \( v \) and the gravitational acceleration \( g \) by:

\[
h = \frac{v^2}{2g}
\]

Since the astronaut exerts the same effort on both Earth and the Moon, the takeoff velocity \( v \) is the same. Therefore, the jump height is inversely proportional to \( g \):

\[
\frac{h_m}{h_e} = \frac{g_e}{g_m}
\]

On Earth, the jump height is \( h_e = 2 \, \text{ft} \). Substituting \( g_m = \frac{1}{6} g_e \):

\[
h_m = h_e \cdot \frac{g_e}{g_m} = 2 \cdot \frac{g_e}{\frac{1}{6} g_e} = 2 \cdot 6 = 12 \, \text{ft}
\]

### Final Answer
From the analysis, the Moon's gravitational acceleration is \( \frac{1}{6} g_e \), and the astronaut can jump \( 12 \, \text{ft} \) on the Moon. The correct option is:

**A: \( g_m = \frac{1}{6} g_e \), 12 ft**
