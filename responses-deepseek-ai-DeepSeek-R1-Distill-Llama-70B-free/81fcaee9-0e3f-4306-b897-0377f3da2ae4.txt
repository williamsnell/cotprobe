Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a soccer team buying balls. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The team has $90.00 to spend, and each soccer ball costs $15.60. The question is asking for the greatest number of balls they can buy without exceeding their budget. 

Hmm, I think I should start by seeing how many times 15.60 fits into 90.00. That sounds like division. So I'll divide 90 by 15.6. Wait, let me make sure I do this correctly. 

Let me write it down: 90 รท 15.6. Maybe I can simplify this by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal. That would make it 900 รท 156. Does that help? I'm not sure, but let's try. 

Wait, another approach: maybe I can see how much 15.6 times 5 is. 15 times 5 is 75, and 0.6 times 5 is 3, so 75+3=78. So 5 balls would cost $78. That leaves 90-78=12 dollars. Not enough for another ball because each is 15.60. So maybe 5 is possible. But wait, let me check higher numbers.

What about 6 balls? 6 times 15 is 90, and 0.6 times 6 is 3.6, so 90 + 3.6 is 93.6. Oh wait, that's more than 90. So 6 would be too expensive. So 5 is the maximum. 

Wait, but wait, I might have made a mistake there. Let me try a different way. Let me calculate 90 divided by 15.6 accurately. So 15.6 times 5 is 78, as I said. Subtracting that from 90 gives 12, which isn't enough for another ball. So 5 is the maximum, right?

But wait, let me try dividing 90 by 15.6. Let's see, 15.6 goes into 90 how many times. 15.6 * 5 =78, 15.6 *6=93.6 which is over. So the integer part is 5. So the team can buy 5 balls. 

Looking at the options, option G is 5. So the answer should be G.

To determine the greatest number of soccer balls the team can buy, we divide the total budget ($90.00) by the cost of one soccer ball ($15.60). 

1. **Calculate**:  
   \[
   \frac{90.00}{15.60} \approx 5.77
   \]  
   Since the team cannot purchase a fraction of a ball, we take the integer part of the result, which is **5**.

2. **Verify**:  
   - 5 balls cost: \(5 \times 15.60 = 78.00\), leaving \(90.00 - 78.00 = 12.00\), which is insufficient for another ball.  
   - 6 balls would cost \(6 \times 15.60 = 93.60\), exceeding the budget.

Thus, the team can buy a maximum of **5 soccer balls**. The correct answer is **G: 5**.
