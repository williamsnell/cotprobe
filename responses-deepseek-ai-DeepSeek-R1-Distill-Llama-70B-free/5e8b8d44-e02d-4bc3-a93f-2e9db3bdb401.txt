Okay, so I've got this question about the strength of a 13C 90-degree pulse, and I need to figure it out. Hmm. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on my NMR concepts, but I'll try to think through this.

Alright, the question is asking for the strength B1 of a 13C nucleus when a 90-degree pulse is applied, and the pulse duration is 1 microsecond. The options are given from A to J, so I need to calculate B1 and see which option matches.

Wait, I remember that the strength of the B1 field is related to the pulse duration and the angle of the pulse. Oh right, the formula for the pulse duration (t_p) is connected to the gyromagnetic ratio (gamma), the angle (theta), and B1. The formula is t_p = theta / (gamma * B1). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Oh, right, the relationship is B1 = (theta) / (gamma * t_p). Or wait, maybe B1 is (gamma * t_p * theta) / something. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write down the formula correctly.

I think the correct formula is B1 = (theta) / (gamma * t_p). Because the pulse duration (t_p) equals theta divided by (gamma * B1), so rearranging, B1 = theta / (gamma * t_p). That makes sense because if you have a higher B1 field, the same angle can be achieved in a shorter time.

But wait, theta is in radians. Oh yes, because the equations in physics typically use radians. So a 90-degree pulse is π/2 radians.

So theta = 90 degrees = π/2 radians. Got it.

Now, the gyromagnetic ratio (gamma) for 13C. I remember that for protons (1H), gamma is about 267.5 x 10^6 rad·s^-1·T^-1. But for 13C, it's lower. Let me think. Carbon-13 has a lower gyromagnetic ratio than proton. Oh right, approximately, 13C's gamma is around 67.26 x 10^6 rad·s^-1·T^-1. I think that's correct.

So gamma for 13C = 67.26e6 rad·s^-1·T^-1.

Pulse duration t_p is 1 microsecond. Oh, wait, that's 1e-6 seconds.

Putting it all into the formula: B1 = theta / (gamma * t_p) = (π/2) / (67.26e6 * 1e-6)

Let me compute that. Wait, calculating the denominator first: 67.26e6 * 1e-6 = 67.26. So 67.26 rad s T^-1 divided by 1e-6 is 67.26e6, but wait no—t_p is 1e-6 s, so gamma multiplied by t_p would be 67.26e6 rad/(s T) * 1e-6 s = 67.26 rad/T.

Wait, no, let me compute gamma * t_p. Gamma is 67.26e6 rad/(s·T), t_p is 1e-6 s. So multiplying gives 67.26e6 * 1e-6 = 67.26 rad·s^-1·T^-1 * s → rad/T. So denominator is 67.26 rad/T.

Theta is π/2 ≈ 1.5708 radians.

So B1 = 1.5708 / 67.26 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 1.5708 divided by 67.26.

67.26 is about 67, so 1.57 /67 is approximately 0.0234. Let me do exact division.

67.26 * 0.0234 = approx 1.573, which is close to 1.5708. So B1 ≈ 0.0234 T.

But wait, the options are in mT. Oh right, because 1 T is 1000 mT. So 0.0234 T is 23.4 mT.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D is 23.3 mT. Option I is 20.2, and J is 17.0. So the closest would be D:23.3 mT.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is expressed as B1 = (4 * theta) / (gamma * t_p), but no, that doesn't sound right. Because the standard formula is t_p = theta / (gamma * B1), so B1 = theta/(gamma * t_p). So I think I did it right.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the formula is B1 = (theta) / (gamma * t_p * pi/2), but that doesn't make sense. No, the initial approach was correct.

Wait another thing: let me recheck the gyromagnetic ratio for 13C. Maybe I got it wrong. Because if I thought 1H is ~267e6, then 13C is about a quarter of that? Because 13C is spin 1/2, but lower gamma.

Wait, let me confirm. The gyromagnetic ratio for 13C is approximately 67.26 x 10^6 rad/s/T. Yes, that's correct. Because I recall that 13C NMR uses lower fields compared to 1H.

So plugging the numbers again: theta = pi/2 ≈ 1.5708 rad.

gamma = 67.26e6 rad/(s T)

t_p = 1e-6 s.

So B1 = 1.5708 / (67.26e6 * 1e-6) → 1.5708 / (67.26) → approx 0.02336 T, which is 23.36 mT.

Looking at the options, option D is 23.3 mT, which matches.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the strength \( B_1 \) of a \( ^{13}C \) 90° pulse with a duration of 1 μs, we use the formula:

\[
B_1 = \frac{\theta}{\gamma \cdot t_p}
\]

Where:
- \( \theta \) is the pulse angle in radians (\( 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5708 \, \text{rad} \)),
- \( \gamma \) is the gyromagnetic ratio for \( ^{13}C \), approximately \( 67.26 \times 10^6 \, \text{rad·s}^{-1}\text{T}^{-1} \),
- \( t_p \) is the pulse duration in seconds (\( 1 \, \mu\text{s} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \)).

Substituting the values:
\[
B_1 = \frac{1.5708}{67.26 \times 10^6 \cdot 1 \times 10^{-6}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:
\[
67.26 \times 10^6 \cdot 1 \times 10^{-6} = 67.26 \, \text{rad·T}^{-1}.
\]

Now, divide:
\[
B_1 = \frac{1.5708}{67.26} \approx 0.02336 \, \text{T}.
\]

Convert to millitesla (\( 1 \, \text{T} = 1000 \, \text{mT} \)):
\[
B_1 \approx 23.36 \, \text{mT}.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **23.3 mT**, which corresponds to option **D**.
