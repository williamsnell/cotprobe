Question:

Thomas and Chess’s (1977) “goodness-of-fit” model predicts that maladjustment in children is due to:

Options:

A: a mismatch between the child's academic abilities and his/her parents' expectations.
B: inconsistencies in the child's perception of self-worth and the feedback received from teachers.
C: inconsistencies in the child's communication skills and the feedback received from peers.
D: inconsistencies in the parenting styles of the child’s caregivers.
E: a mismatch between the child's physical activity levels and his/her parents' encouragement of physical activity.
F: a mismatch between the child's emotional needs and his/her parents' emotional availability.
G: inconsistencies in the child's peer group and their influence on the child's behavior.
H: inconsistencies in the child’s sense of self and the feedback the child receives from caregivers about his/her behavior.
I: a mismatch between the child’s basic temperament and his/her parents’ childrearing practices.
J: a mismatch between the child’s attachment behaviors and his/her parents’ response to those behaviors.

Okay, so I've got this question about Thomas and Chess’s “goodness-of-fit” model. I'm a bit rusty on developmental psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what their model predicts as the cause of maladjustment in children. The options are A through J, so I need to figure out which one aligns with the goodness-of-fit concept.

From what I remember, the goodness-of-fit model is about how well the child's characteristics match up with their environment. Specifically, it's about the child's temperament and how the parents or caregivers respond to that. If there's a mismatch, that's when problems might arise.

So, looking at the options, I should find the one that talks about a mismatch between the child's temperament and the parents' childrearing practices. Let me scan the options.

Option A talks about academic abilities and parents' expectations. That's more about school stuff, not necessarily temperament. Option B is about self-worth and teacher feedback, which seems more related to the child's self-esteem perhaps, but not the fit between child and parents.

Option C mentions communication skills and peer feedback. Again, peers are involved, not parents. Option D is about inconsistent parenting styles among caregivers. That's more about the parents' behavior rather than the child's traits matching with the environment.

Option E is about physical activity levels and parents' encouragement. That's a specific aspect, but I'm not sure if it's the broad temperament match. Option F is emotional needs and parents' emotional availability. That sounds closer because emotional needs are part of temperament, but I'm not certain if that's the exact model.

Option G is about peer groups influencing behavior, which I don't think is part of the goodness-of-fit model. Option H talks about a child's sense of self and feedback from caregivers. That's about self-concept, maybe, but again, not directly the temperament-environment fit.

Option I says a mismatch between the child’s basic temperament and parents’ childrearing practices. That rings a bell. Thomas and Chess were all about temperament, so this must be the one.

Option J is about attachment behaviors and parents' responses. Attachment is more from Bowlby or Ainsworth, I think, not Thomas and Chess. So J is about a different theory.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be I.

The question asks about Thomas and Chess’s (1977) “goodness-of-fit” model and its prediction regarding maladjustment in children. The model focuses on the match between a child's temperament and their environment, particularly the parents' childrearing practices. A mismatch in this fit is seen as a potential cause of maladjustment.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H**: These options discuss various mismatches but do not specifically address the core concept of temperament and parenting practices.
- **I**: This option directly refers to a mismatch between the child's temperament and the parents' childrearing practices, aligning with the goodness-of-fit model.
- **J**: This option pertains to attachment behaviors, which is a different theory (Bowlby/Ainsworth), not Thomas and Chess.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**, as it accurately reflects the goodness-of-fit model's emphasis on temperament-environment fit.

Answer: I
