Question:

A male bacterium conjugates with a female bacterium. After conjugation , the female becomes a male. Account for this "sex-change".

Options:

A: The female bacterium becomes a male by incorporating male genetic material into its own genome.
B: The female bacterium becomes a male by dividing and producing a male offspring.
C: The female bacterium becomes a male by undergoing a mutation in its own DNA.
D: The female bacterium becomes a male by receiving one copy of the F factor.
E: The female bacterium becomes a male by exposure to a particular environmental condition.
F: The female bacterium becomes a male by exchanging plasmids with the male bacterium.
G: The female bacterium becomes a male by receiving a sex chromosome.
H: The female bacterium becomes a male by receiving a male chromosome.
I: The female bacterium becomes a male by conjugating with a male bacterium.
J: The female bacterium becomes a male by receiving multiple copies of the F factor.

Okay, so I have this biology question about bacterial conjugation and a sex change in bacteria. Hmm, I remember that bacteria have this process called conjugation where they transfer genetic material. I think it's related to the F factor, which stands for fertility. 

So the question says a male bacterium conjugates with a female. After that, the female becomes a male. I need to explain why that happens. Let me think about what I learned about bacterial conjugation.

Wait, right. In bacteria, the male is called the F+ because it has the F plasmid, which is a circular piece of DNA separate from the chromosome. The female is F-; they don't have this plasmid. During conjugation, the male transfers the F plasmid to the female through a pilus. So after conjugation, the female receives the F factor.

Oh, right! So the female was F- before, and after receiving the F plasmid, it becomes F+. So it can now act as a male because it has the F factor. So the sex change is because the female received the F factor from the male.

Looking at the options, the correct answer should relate to the female receiving the F factor. Let me go through the options.

Option A: Incorporating male genetic material into genome. Wait, the F factor is a plasmid, not part of the genome. So maybe not A.

Option B: Dividing and producing male offspring. That's about reproduction, but the question is about the same bacterium changing sex. So B doesn't fit.

Option C: Mutation in DNA. No, the change is due to receiving genetic material, not mutation. So C is out.

Option D: Receiving one copy of F factor. That sounds right because the female becomes F+ by getting the plasmid.

Option E: Environmental condition. No, the change is immediate after conjugation, so probably not E.

Option F: Exchanging plasmids. Well, the male gives the F factor to the female, so it's a transfer, not an exchange. F might not be correct.

Option G: Receiving sex chromosome. Bacteria don't have sex chromosomes; they have plasmids. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Receiving a male chromosome. Again, bacteria don't have separate sex chromosomes, so H is wrong.

Option I: Conjugating with a male. Well, conjugation is the process, but that's the cause, not the mechanism of the sex change. So I describes the event but not the reason.

Option J: Multiple copies of F factor. I think each cell usually has one F plasmid, so maybe J is not correct.

So the correct answer should be D: The female becomes male by receiving one copy of the F factor.

The question involves explaining why a female bacterium becomes male after conjugation with a male bacterium. In bacterial conjugation, the male bacterium (F+) transfers the F factor, a plasmid, to the female bacterium (F-). This transfer allows the female to acquire the F factor, enabling it to function as a male bacterium. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The F factor is a plasmid, not genetic material incorporated into the genome.  
- **B**: Incorrect. The sex change occurs in the same bacterium, not through producing offspring.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The change is due to receiving the F factor, not a mutation.  
- **D**: Correct. The female becomes male by receiving one copy of the F factor.  
- **E**: Incorrect. The change is not due to environmental conditions.  
- **F**: Incorrect. The process involves transfer, not exchange, of plasmids.  
- **G**: Incorrect. Bacteria do not have sex chromosomes.  
- **H**: Incorrect. Bacteria do not have separate male chromosomes.  
- **I**: Incorrect. While conjugation occurs, it does not explain the mechanism of the sex change.  
- **J**: Incorrect. Typically, only one copy of the F factor is transferred.  

The correct answer is **D**, as the female bacterium becomes male by receiving one copy of the F factor.

Answer: D
