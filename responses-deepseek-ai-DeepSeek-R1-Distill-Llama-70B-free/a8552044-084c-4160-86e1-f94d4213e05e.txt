Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the formal sources of international law and their relationships. I remember from my studies that international law has a few main sources, right? Let me think.

I think the main sources are treaties, custom, and general principles of law. Also, judicial decisions and the teachings of publicists are considered, but I believe they're subsidiary or secondary sources. The question is about the formal sources, so maybe those are the primary ones like treaties, custom, and general principles.

Now, the question is asking about the relationship between these formal sources. The options are suggesting different hierarchies or equal standings. So, I need to recall if there's a hierarchy or if they're considered equal.

I remember that in international law, unlike some domestic legal systems, the sources don't have a strict hierarchy. So, for example, in the US, the Constitution is the highest law, then statutes, then regulations, etc. But in international law, it's more about which source is applicable and appropriate for the situation.

Wait, but there's something about Article 38 of the ICJ Statute. Let me try to recall that. Article 38 lists the sources of international law that the court should apply. It mentions international conventions (treaties) as the first source, then international custom, followed by general principles of law recognized by civilized nations. Then, as subsidiary means, judicial decisions and teachings of publicists.

So the order in Article 38 might suggest a priority, but I also remember that it's not a strict hierarchy. The ICJ can apply these sources as appropriate. So, it's more about the relevance and applicability in each case rather than one always taking precedence over the others.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Treaties supersede custom. I don't think that's necessarily true because sometimes custom can be more fundamental, like peremptory norms (jus cogens) which can't be changed by treaties.

Option B: Treaties and General Principles are equal, both above custom. Doesn't seem right because custom is a primary source, and general principles might be more about filling gaps.

Option C: General Principles supersede both. That doesn't fit with what I know.

Option D: Judicial decisions and teachings are the only sources. No, they're secondary.

Option E: Judicial decisions and teachings supersede others. Definitely not.

Option F: Custom and General Principles equal, above treaties. Doesn't fit because treaties are primary in many cases.

Option G: Hierarchy varies case to case. That sounds plausible because it's more about what's applicable rather than a strict order.

Option H: Custom over treaties. No, because a treaty can create specific obligations that take precedence in that context.

Option I: Treaties and custom equal, but General Principles above. I don't think so because General Principles are more of a last resort.

Option J: No hierarchy. That's possible too. The sources are considered in a way that the court decides which to apply based on the situation.

Wait, so does international law have a hierarchy among its formal sources? I think the answer is that there's no strict hierarchy. They are considered as formal sources without a predetermined rank. So in each case, the court assesses which source applies best.

So looking back, option J says there's no hierarchy between the formal sources. That would mean each can be used as applicable without one being higher.

But I'm a bit confused because Article 38 lists them in an order, which might imply priority. But from what I understand, that's not a hierarchy. It's more about the order of preference when possible, but not a strict rule.

So the correct answer is probably J: There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.

The question concerns the relationship between the formal sources of international law, which include treaties, custom, and general principles of law. According to Article 38 of the ICJ Statute, these sources are listed in an order that might suggest a priority, but this does not establish a strict hierarchy. Instead, the application of these sources depends on their relevance and applicability in each specific case. Treaties, custom, and general principles are considered equally as formal sources, and the ICJ determines which is most appropriate to apply based on the circumstances. Judicial decisions and the teachings of publicists are subsidiary sources, not part of the formal hierarchy.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, F, H, I**: These options suggest a strict hierarchy, which does not align with the flexible nature of international law.
- **D, E**: These incorrectly elevate judicial decisions and teachings of publicists to a superior status.
- **G**: While it suggests variability, it implies a case-by-case hierarchy, which is not accurate.
- **J**: Correctly reflects that there is no strict hierarchy among the formal sources of international law.

Thus, the correct answer is that there is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.
