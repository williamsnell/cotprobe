Okay, so I've got this problem with two parts, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's tackle each part one by one.

First, part (i): How much energy is used by a 1,500-watt heater in 8 hours. Hmm, I remember that power is measured in watts, and energy is usually in watt-hours or kilowatt-hours. Oh right, because a watt is a unit of power, which is energy per time. So when you multiply power by time, you get energy.

So the heater is 1,500 watts. Watts are joules per second, but for energy, I can just use the formula: Energy (in Wh) = Power (W) × Time (h). But wait, I need to make sure the units are correct. Since the time is in hours, and the power is in watts, the result will be in watt-hours. But the options seem to use kWh, which is kilowatt-hours.

So 1,500 W is 1.5 kW because 1 kW is 1,000 W. So 1.5 kW multiplied by 8 hours. Let me calculate that: 1.5 * 8 = 12. So that's 12 kilowatt-hours (kWh). So the first part's answer is 12kWhr.

Now, moving on to part (ii). It says a 12-kW load is supplied from a line that has a resistance of 0.1 ohm in each conductor. I think each conductor means each wire, so there are two wires, right? Like live and neutral. So the total resistance would be 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 ohms.

Wait, but the problem is about line loss. Line loss is the power lost in the wires, right? Power loss is calculated using I² R, where I is the current and R is the resistance. But I think since there are two wires, we might need to consider the total resistance correctly.

But wait, each wire is 0.1 ohms, so total for the circuit is 0.2 ohms. So for part (a), the load is supplied at 120 volts, and part (b) at 240 volts.

But first, I think I need to find the current for each case, then calculate the power loss.

Wait, the load is 12 kW. So for each voltage, the current can be found using P = V * I. So I = P / V.

But wait, power is 12 kW, which is 12,000 watts. So for part (a), V is 120 volts.

So I = 12,000 W / 120 V = 100 A. That's the current in the circuit.

Then, the line loss is I² multiplied by the total resistance. So I² R = (100)^2 * 0.2 = 10,000 * 0.2 = 2,000 watts. So for part (a), the line loss is 2000 watts.

Now part (b), when the voltage is 240 volts. Let me calculate the current again. I = P / V = 12,000 / 240 = 50 A.

Then, line loss is I² R = (50)^2 * 0.2 = 2500 * 0.2 = 500 watts. Wait, that's 500? Wait, 50 squared is 2500. 2500 * 0.2 is 500. So for part (b), the line loss is 500 watts.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. The first part is 12kWhr, then for (ii) (a) 2000 and (b) 500.

Looking at the options, option E is (i) 12kWhr, (ii a) 2000, (ii b)500. So looking at the options:

Option E says (i) 12kWhr, (ii a) 2000, (ii b)500. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. For part (i), 1500W for 8 hours is 1500 *8 =12,000 Wh, which is 12 kWh. Correct.

For part (ii a), V=120, P=12,000 W. I=12,000/120=100 A. Line resistance is 0.2 ohms. So I² R is 100^2 *0.2=10,000 *0.2=2000 W. That's correct.

Part (ii b), V=240. I=12,000/240=50 A. So I² R=50^2 *0.2=2500 *0.2=500 W. Correct.

So the answers for (ii) (a) and (b) are 2000 and 500, which matches option E.

Looking at the options, option E is (i) 12kWhr, (a) 2000, (b)500. So the correct answer should be E.

(i) To determine the energy used by a 1,500-watt heater in 8 hours, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Energy} = \text{Power} \times \text{Time}
\]

The heater's power is 1,500 W, which is equivalent to 1.5 kW. Over 8 hours, the energy consumed is:

\[
\text{Energy} = 1.5 \, \text{kW} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 12 \, \text{kWhr}
\]

Thus, the energy used is **12 kWhr**.

---

(ii) A 12-kW load is supplied through a line with a resistance of 0.1 ohm in each conductor. Since there are two conductors (live and neutral), the total resistance is:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = 0.1 \, \Omega + 0.1 \, \Omega = 0.2 \, \Omega
\]

The line loss is calculated using the formula:

\[
P_{\text{loss}} = I^2 R
\]

where \(I\) is the current through the line. The current is determined using:

\[
I = \frac{P}{V}
\]

Here, \(P = 12 \, \text{kW} = 12,000 \, \text{W}\).

---

(a) When the load is supplied at 120 volts:

\[
I = \frac{12,000 \, \text{W}}{120 \, \text{V}} = 100 \, \text{A}
\]

The line loss is:

\[
P_{\text{loss}} = (100 \, \text{A})^2 \times 0.2 \, \Omega = 10,000 \times 0.2 = 2,000 \, \text{W}
\]

Thus, the line loss at 120 volts is **2,000 watts**.

---

(b) When the load is supplied at 240 volts:

\[
I = \frac{12,000 \, \text{W}}{240 \, \text{V}} = 50 \, \text{A}
\]

The line loss is:

\[
P_{\text{loss}} = (50 \, \text{A})^2 \times 0.2 \, \Omega = 2,500 \times 0.2 = 500 \, \text{W}
\]

Thus, the line loss at 240 volts is **500 watts**.

---

From the calculations:

(i) The energy used is **12 kWhr**.

(ii) The line losses are **2,000 watts** at 120 volts and **500 watts** at 240 volts.

The correct answer is **E**.
