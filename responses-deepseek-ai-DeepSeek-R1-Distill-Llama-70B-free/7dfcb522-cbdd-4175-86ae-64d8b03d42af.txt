Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the width of a silent chain. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me a bunch of details, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, the chain has a pitch of 1 inch. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me read it again. The question says, "Calculate the width of a silent chain of 1 in. pitch..." Wait, no, actually, looking again: the question starts by saying the pitch is 1 in., but then the options are given as different chain pitches and their allowable tensions. Oh wait, no, the first part is the question, and then the table is part of the problem. Let me re-read.

The problem states that the chain delivers 25 hp. The driving sprocket has 25 teeth and rotates at 400 rpm. Then there's a table of chain pitches in inches and their allowable tensions in lb/in²? Or maybe lb per inch? Wait, the table's heading is "Allowable Tension lb/in." So maybe it's pounds per inch of width. Hmm.

So I think the approach here is to determine the required tension in the chain, then find the minimum width needed based on the allowable tension for the given pitch.

First, I need to find the power transmitted by the chain. The formula for power in a chain drive is P = (T1 - T2) * v, where T1 and T2 are the tensions on the tight and slack sides, and v is the chain's velocity. But wait, I don't have T1 and T2. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the torque first.

Wait, another approach: the power transmitted by a chain can also be calculated using P = (F * v) / 333, where F is the force in pounds and v is the velocity in feet per minute. But I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Alternatively, since the sprocket has a certain number of teeth and rotates at a certain rpm, I can find the chain speed.

Let me think. The chain speed can be calculated as the number of teeth on the sprocket multiplied by the pitch and the rpm, divided by some conversion factor. Wait, the number of teeth times the pitch gives the circumference in inches, and then multiplying by rpm gives inches per minute, right?

So the sprocket has 25 teeth, pitch 1 inch. So the circumference is 25 * 1 inch = 25 inches. RPM is 400, so the speed is 25 inches/rev * 400 rev/min = 10,000 inches per minute. But wait, that's 10,000 inches per minute. Converting to feet per minute, divide by 12: 10,000 /12 ≈ 833.33 feet per minute.

But wait, let me double-check. No, the 25 teeth times pitch 1 inch gives 25 inches per revolution. So in one minute, 400 revs: 25 * 400 = 10,000 inches per minute. Yes. So 10,000 inches per minute is equal to 833.333 feet per minute because 10,000 /12 ≈ 833.333.

Now, the power transmitted is 25 hp. So using the formula P = (T * v) / 550, where T is the tension in pounds and v is in feet per minute. Wait, because 1 hp is 550 ft-lbf per second. So rearranging, T = (P * 550) / v.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this applies directly because this formula is for belt drives where T is the belt tension. For chains, maybe it's similar. Let's try it.

So P is 25 hp, v is 833.333 ft/min. Let me convert v to ft/sec to match the units: 833.333 ft/min * (1 min/60 sec) ≈ 13.8889 ft/sec.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the formula I should use is T = (P * 550) / v, where v is in ft/min. Let me check the units. 550 ft-lbf/sec is for 1 hp.

Wait, no, the correct formula is P = (F * v) / 550, where F is in pounds-force, v in feet per minute, and P in horsepower.

So rearranged, F = (P * 550) / v.

So plugging in the numbers: P =25 hp, v=833.333 ft/min.

F = (25 * 550) / 833.333 ≈ (13750) / 833.333 ≈ 16.5 pounds-force. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the allowable tensions are way higher than that.

Wait, I think I must be making a mistake here. Because 25 hp seems like a lot, so maybe the tension should be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the torque first. Torque T is P/(2πN), where N is in revolutions per second. But let me think.

Power P is 25 hp. Convert to ft-lbf per second: 25 * 550 = 13,750 ft-lbf/s.

The torque T is P/(2πN), where N is in revolutions per second. The sprocket is rotating at 400 rpm, so N = 400 /60 ≈ 6.6667 rev/sec.

So T = 13,750 / (2 * π * 6.6667) ≈ 13,750 / (41.8879) ≈ 328 ft-lbf.

Now, torque is also equal to F * r, where r is the radius of the sprocket. The sprocket has 25 teeth, pitch 1 inch, so the pitch diameter D is 25 * 1 inch / (2 * π) * 2 = wait no, wait. The pitch diameter for a sprocket is (number of teeth) * pitch / (π). So D = (25 * 1) / π ≈ 7.96 inches. So radius r is D/2 ≈ 3.98 inches.

So torque T = F * r => F = T / r = 328 / 3.98 ≈ 82.4 pounds.

Hmm, that's better because the allowable tensions are in the range of 75 to 600 lb/in.

Wait, but wait, this F is the difference in tension between the tight and slack side, right? Because in a chain drive, the tension on the tight side is T1, on the slack side T2, and the effective tension is T1 - T2. Because the torque is due to the difference in tension.

So F in the torque equation is T1 - T2.

But chains usually have an allowable tension, which is the maximum tension that the chain can handle. So T1 would be the maximum allowed, and T2 can be zero, but perhaps in reality, T2 is some lower value, but for initial calculation, maybe we can assume T2 is negligible. Or perhaps, for power transmission, T1 is the maximum allowable because that's what the chain can handle.

Wait, but the table in the problem gives "Allowable Tension lb/in." So perhaps the allowable tension is per inch of chain width. So for a given pitch, the maximum allowable tension is given, and the width is determined by how much tension is needed.

Wait, perhaps the allowable tension is the maximum tension per inch of width. So for example, a pitch of 3/8 in. has 75 lb/in. allowable tension. So if the chain is, say, 1 inch wide, the maximum allowable tension would be 75 lb. But if the chain is 0.5 inches wide, then the maximum allowable tension would be 75 lb/in * 0.5 in = 37.5 lb. Hmm, that seems possible.

Wait, but no, perhaps the "allowable tension" is the maximum tension (in lb) that the chain can handle per inch of width. So for a 1-inch wide chain, the allowable tension is 75 lb, as per the first row. Wait, the first row is 3/8 in. pitch, 75 lb/in. So perhaps it's that for each inch of width, the chain can handle 75 lb.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look at the table again. It's labeled "Chain Pitch, in. Allowable Tension lb/in." So for a 3/8 inch pitch, the allowable tension is 75 lb/in. So perhaps the allowable tension is 75 pounds per inch of width. So if the chain is, say, 2 inches wide, the total allowable tension would be 75 lb/in * 2 in = 150 lb. Hmm, that seems plausible.

So the idea is that for each inch of chain width, you can have up to a certain allowable tension. So the total allowable tension is the product of the allowable tension per inch and the number of inches in width.

So in our problem, the required tension is 82.4 lb (from earlier torque calculation). So we need to find a chain width such that the allowable tension (as per the table) multiplied by the width is at least 82.4 lb.

Wait, but let me double-check. The torque equation gave me F = 82.4 lb, which is the difference between T1 and T2 (T1 - T2 = 82.4 lb). But the maximum allowable tension in the chain is T1, so T1 must be at least 82.4 lb. Because T2 could be zero, but in reality, chains usually have some slack, so T2 isn't zero, but for the worst case, maybe T2 is negligible. Therefore, T1 needs to be at least 82.4 lb.

But according to the table, the allowable tension varies with the pitch. Wait, but the problem states that the chain has a pitch of 1 inch. So looking at the table, for a 1 inch pitch, the allowable tension is 205 lb/in. Wait, the fourth row in the table is 3/4 in., 150 lb/in; the fifth row is 1 in. pitch, 205 lb/in. So for 1-inch pitch, allowable tension is 205 lb per inch of width.

So the allowable tension per inch of width is 205 lb. So the required T1 is 82.4 lb. Therefore, the minimum width required is T1 divided by the allowable tension per inch.

So width w = T1 / (allowable tension per in) = 82.4 lb / 205 lb/in ≈ 0.402 inches. That seems really small, which can't be right because the options are all in the 2.5 to 7 inch range.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the horsepower and calculate the required chain tension based on that. Another approach is to use the formula for horsepower capacity of a chain, which is based on the tension and velocity.

Horsepower is given by (T * v) / 550, where T is the tension in pounds and v is the velocity in feet per minute.

Wait, let's try that. So v is 833.333 ft/min, as calculated earlier.

So 25 hp = (T * 833.333) / 550 → T = (25 * 550) / 833.333 ≈ 13750 / 833.333 ≈ 16.5 pounds. Hmm, that's a small tension, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but if T is 16.5 pounds, and the allowable tension per inch is 205 lb/in for 1-inch pitch, then the required width would be 16.5 / 205 ≈ 0.08 inches. That's way too small, so I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps because the chain's tension isn't just T, but the difference between the tight and slack sides, T1 and T2. So the power formula would be based on (T1 - T2) * v / 550 = P.

But without knowing T2, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the torque method and find T1 as the allowable tension, which would then determine the width.

Wait, another thought: maybe the table provides the maximum allowable tension for the chain based on its width and pitch. So for a 1-inch pitch chain, each inch of width can handle 205 lb of tension.

Wait, but in that case, the maximum tension the chain can handle is 205 lb per inch of width. So if the total tension in the chain (T1) is 82.4 lb, then the required width would be T1 divided by 205 lb/in. So 82.4 /205 ≈ 0.402 inches, which is way smaller than any of the options, so something's wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the allowable tension is per inch of pitch? No, the table says "Chain Pitch, in. Allowable Tension lb/in." So for each pitch, the allowable tension is given as lb per in. So perhaps for a 1-inch pitch, the maximum allowable tension is 205 lb per inch of width. So if the chain is, say, 0.5 inches wide, the maximum allowable tension is 205 * 0.5 = 102.5 lb.

Wait, but in our case, we need the tension to be at least 82.4 lb. So the width would be 82.4 /205 ≈ 0.402 inches. But that's not in the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the table is giving the maximum allowable tension for each pitch, regardless of width. Let me re-examine the table. It's labeled as "Load handling capacities of silent chains". So perhaps for each pitch, the maximum allowable tension is the value given. For example, a 3/8-inch pitch chain can handle 75 lb/in. Wait, but the units are lb/in, which is pounds per inch, perhaps per inch of width.

Wait, but the problem is about the width of the chain. So for a given pitch, the allowable tension is given per inch of width. So for a 1-inch pitch, the allowable tension is 205 lb per inch of width. So a chain that's 1 inch wide would have 205 lb maximum tension. So if we need T1 to be 82.4 lb, then the width would be 82.4 /205 ≈ 0.402 inches. But this is less than any option provided, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the required tension. Let me go back to the torque calculation.

The sprocket has 25 teeth, pitch 1 inch, so the pitch diameter is (25 * 1) / π ≈ 7.96 inches. Radius is about 3.98 inches. Torque T is 328 ft-lbf. So F (the force) is T / r. But wait, torque is in ft-lbf, so I should convert the radius to feet.

Wait, 3.98 inches is 3.98/12 ≈ 0.3317 feet. So F = 328 ft-lbf / 0.3317 ft ≈ 988.7 pounds. Oh wait, that's a big difference! I think I messed up the units earlier. So that's probably where I went wrong.

So torque is 328 ft-lbf. Radius r is 3.98 inches, which is 0.3317 feet. So F = T / r = 328 / 0.3317 ≈ 988.7 lb. That makes more sense because the allowable tensions are in the hundreds.

So F here is T1 - T2, the difference in tension. So (T1 - T2) = 988.7 lb.

But the maximum allowable tension in the chain is T1_max, which per the table for 1-inch pitch is 205 lb per inch of width. So T1_max = 205 * w, where w is the width in inches.

Assuming that T2 is zero (which might not be the case, but perhaps for maximum power, we take T2 as zero), then T1 = 988.7 lb.

So 205 * w ≥ 988.7 → w ≥ 988.7 /205 ≈ 4.821 inches. So approximately 4.82 inches.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.83 inches, which is very close. Hmm, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 988.7 divided by 205 equals approximately 4.821, which would be about 4.82 inches. The option I is 4.83, which is very close, so that must be the answer. But wait, let's make sure that the units are correct.

Wait, let me recheck the torque calculation. The sprocket has 25 teeth, 1-inch pitch. So the pitch diameter is (25 * 1)/π ≈ 7.96 inches. The radius is about 3.98 inches, which is 0.3317 feet. Torque is 328 ft-lbf.

So F = T / r = 328 / 0.3317 ≈ 988.7 lb. Yes, that's correct.

So the required T1 is 988.7 lb, and the allowable T1 is 205 * w. So w = 988.7 /205 ≈ 4.82 inches.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.83 inches, which matches. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but another thought: the problem says the chain delivers 25 hp. So perhaps I should calculate using the horsepower formula and see if I get the same result.

Using P = (T * v) / 550, where P is 25 hp, v is 833.333 ft/min.

So T = (25 * 550) / 833.333 ≈ 13750 /833.333 ≈ 16.5 lb.

Wait, that's way lower than the 988 lb from the torque method. So which one is correct?

I think I must have made a mistake in the torque calculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, power P is 25 hp, which is 25 * 550 = 13,750 ft-lbf/s.

The torque T is P / (2πN), where N is the rotational speed in rev/sec. N = 400 rpm = 400/60 ≈ 6.6667 rev/sec.

So T = 13750 / (2π *6.6667) ≈ 13750 / (41.8879) ≈ 328 ft-lbf.

Yes, that's correct. So then F = T / r = 328 / 0.3317 ≈ 988.7 lb.

But according to the other method, using P = (T * v)/550, T is about 16.5 lb, which is way lower. There's a discrepancy here.

Ah, I think I know where I messed up. The formula P = (T * v)/550 is for belt drives and assumes that the tension is the same on both sides, but in reality, for a chain, the effective tension is T1 - T2. So perhaps the
