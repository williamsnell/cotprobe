Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about couple therapy in the context of a client with Alcohol Dependence. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about Dr. Delbert Dinwoody treating a 35-year-old client diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence. With the client's permission, the doctor invites the client's wife to participate in couple therapy. The question is whether this action is acceptable and under what circumstances.

First, I need to recall the ethical guidelines related to couple therapy, especially concerning informed consent and confidentiality. I remember that in therapy, especially individual therapy, the client's confidentiality is paramount. But when involving a spouse or partner, it's important to ensure that both parties are comfortable and agree to the setup.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Acceptable as long as the client and wife are not separated or in the process of divorce. Well, I'm not sure if being separated is the main issue here. The key is probably more about consent rather than their marital status.

Option B: Acceptable as long as the wife isn't receiving services from another professional. That doesn't seem right. The wife can see another therapist; it's about her consent and understanding the role in couple therapy.

Option C: Unacceptable because the wife is vulnerable to undue influence. Hmm. I think that when a therapist invites a family member, they should ensure that the family member isn't being coerced. But if the client has given permission, and presumably the wife is willing, maybe it's okay. I'm not certain about this.

Option D: Only if the wife has Alcohol Dependence. That doesn't make sense. Couple therapy can address the client's issues even if the spouse doesn't have the same diagnosis.

Option E: Acceptable if Dr. D believes it benefits the client. This sounds reasonable because the primary client is the one with Alcohol Dependence. The therapist's judgment that involving the spouse would help seems valid, as long as everyone consents.

Option F: Unacceptable because the wife should seek her own help. That's not necessarily true. Couple therapy can be a form of support without replacing individual therapy for the wife.

Option G: Unacceptable due to conflict of interest. I don't see an immediate conflict unless the therapist has a dual relationship with both, but here it's initiated with the client's consent.

Option H: Only if the wife gives written consent. Written consent might not always be required, but informed consent is necessary. So maybe this is too strict.

Option I: Unacceptable because of bias. I don't think involving the spouse would inherently create bias if the therapist is competent.

Option J: Infringes on individual therapy. Couple therapy can complement individual therapy, so this doesn't seem right.

Now, thinking about ethical standards. The primary client is the individual, so the therapist's responsibility is to them. Inviting the spouse with the client's permission is a common practice to support the client's recovery. The key would be ensuring that the spouse is willing and that her role is clear.

Option E says it's acceptable if the therapist believes it will benefit the client. That makes sense because the therapist's professional judgment is a factor here, as long as consent is obtained.

Wait, but what about the wife's consent? She needs to agree to participate. So the question states that the invitation is with the client's permission, but does it mention the wife's consent? The question says "with the client's permission," but perhaps the wife's consent is also necessary. However, the question is about the acceptability in general, not the specifics of consent.

Looking back at the options, E seems to focus on the therapist's belief in the benefit, which is a valid consideration. Other options are either too restrictive or incorrect.

So I think the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around the ethical acceptability of Dr. Delbert Dinwoody inviting the wife of a client with Alcohol Dependence to participate in couple therapy, with the client's permission. The key considerations involve informed consent, confidentiality, and the therapist's professional judgment.

- **Option A** suggests acceptability based on the client and wife's marital status, but this is irrelevant as long as consent is obtained.
- **Option B** incorrectly implies that the wife's involvement hinges on her not seeing another therapist, which is unnecessary.
- **Option C** raises concerns about undue influence, but with the client's permission and the wife's willingness, this is not inherently problematic.
- **Option D** mistakenly limits couple therapy to cases where the wife also has Alcohol Dependence, which is not required.
- **Option E** aligns with ethical standards, as the therapist's judgment that couple therapy will benefit the client, combined with consent, makes it acceptable.
- **Option F** incorrectly assumes the wife must seek her own therapy, which is not a prerequisite for participating in couple therapy.
- **Option G** incorrectly suggests a conflict of interest, which is not present here.
- **Option H** overly restricts the situation by requiring written consent, though informed consent is necessary.
- **Option I** incorrectly assumes bias, which is not inherent to involving the spouse.
- **Option J** incorrectly claims that couple therapy infringes on individual therapy, as they can complement each other.

The most appropriate answer is **Option E**, as it reflects the therapist's professional judgment and the client's consent, which are key ethical considerations.

Answer: E
