Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about GDP, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is asking which event doesn't affect GDP. The options are A through D.

First, I need to remember what GDP measures. GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, right? It's the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific time period. So, it includes everything that's produced domestically, whether by citizens or foreigners, but excludes things produced in other countries.

Now, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: A college buys computers. So, the college is buying computers. I'm thinking, are these computers new? If the college is purchasing new computers, that's a purchase of a good. Since it's a final product (assuming they're not for resale), it would count as part of GDP. So this would affect GDP because it's a new good being bought within the country.

Option B: The Department of Transportation repaves a road. That's a government expenditure. Government spending is a component of GDP. So when the government spends on infrastructure like repaving roads, that contributes to GDP. So this affects GDP.

Option C: A city spends money to refurbish a public park. Again, this is government spending on public services or infrastructure. So this is included in GDP as part of government consumption expenditures. Therefore, this affects GDP.

Option D: You buy a 1957 Chevy from a friend. Hmm. This is a bit trickier. Buying a used car from a friend. Wait, GDP measures the value of new goods and services. So if the car was produced in a previous year, then buying it now doesn't add to the current year's GDP because it's a second-hand sale. The GDP would have already counted the value when the car was first sold as a new vehicle. So this transaction doesn't contribute to current GDP because it's not a new good or service. Also, since it's a private sale between individuals, it doesn't get recorded in the same way as a business sale might. But wait, sometimes used goods are sold through businesses, like used car dealerships. In that case, the dealer's profit would count. But if you're buying directly from a friend, it's not part of the formal market transaction, so it's not counted in GDP.

So the event that has no effect on GDP is option D because it's a used item, so the economic activity already happened when the car was new.

The event that has no effect on GDP is option D. GDP measures the value of new goods and services produced within a country during a specific period. Transactions involving used goods, such as buying a 1957 Chevy from a friend, do not contribute to GDP because the value of the car was already counted when it was first produced and sold as a new vehicle. The other options involve purchases of new goods or government expenditures, which are included in GDP.

Answer: D
