Okay, so I've got this problem here about estimating the amount of tin in a closed tin can. The can has a diameter of 8 cm and a height of 12 cm. The tin is 0.04 cm thick. I'm supposed to use differentials to estimate this. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on differentials, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that when using differentials for approximation, we're looking at a small change in a function. The idea is that if the change is small, we can approximate the differential instead of calculating the exact change, which might be more complicated.

So the problem is about the volume of tin used. Since the can is made of tin, the tin forms a sort of 'skin' around the inside (or maybe the outside, but I think it's the inner volume that's hollow, so the tin is the outer part). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the can's dimensions are given as diameter 8 cm, so radius 4 cm, and height 12 cm. But the tin is 0.04 cm thick. So the tin is the material, so the can's internal dimensions would be slightly smaller than the given dimensions because the tin takes up some space.

Wait, but if the tin is on the outside, then the actual volume inside the can would be less by twice the thickness (since the radius is reduced by 0.04 cm on both sides). But wait, the question is about the volume of tin used, which would be the volume of the can (as a cylinder) minus the volume of the inner hollow part. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to model the tin as a sort of cylindrical shell, including the top and bottom.

Wait, but perhaps using differentials, we can approximate the change in volume caused by the tin layer.

So the formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = π r² h. But in this case, the tin is adding a small thickness, so we can consider that the radius increases by dr, and the height increases by dh. Wait, but since the tin is on both the sides and the top and bottom, I'm not sure if the height would increase, or if it's just the radius. Alternatively, maybe the can's dimensions include the tin, so the internal dimensions are smaller. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The can's diameter is 8 cm, so radius 4 cm. The height is 12 cm. But the tin has a thickness of 0.04 cm. So the internal dimensions would be smaller. So the internal radius would be 4 cm minus 0.04 cm, right? Because the tin is on the sides, so each side (inside and outside) would have a layer of tin. Wait, no, wait. If the can is made of tin, the tin's thickness is 0.04 cm, so on each side of the cylinder wall, the radius would be reduced by 0.04 cm. So the internal radius is 4 cm - 0.04 cm = 3.96 cm. Similarly, the internal height would be 12 cm minus twice the thickness, so 12 - 0.08 cm = 11.92 cm. Because the tin is on the top and bottom, each reducing the height by 0.04 cm.

But wait, no. Wait, the can is closed, so the top and bottom are part of the tin. So the tin's thickness is 0.04 cm, so the internal height would be 12 cm minus 2 times 0.04 cm (since the top and bottom each have a layer of tin). Similarly, the internal radius is 4 cm minus 0.04 cm (since the side has a layer of tin on the inside). Wait, but is the tin on the outside or the inside? Hmm, that's a point I'm not sure about. Typically, the can is made of tin, so the inside of the can would have a radius of 4 cm, and the tin adds to the outside. But wait, in that case, the internal volume would be based on radius 4 cm, and the external would be 4.04 cm. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the tin's thickness is the difference between the external and internal dimensions. So if the external radius is 4 cm, then the internal radius would be 4 cm minus 0.04 cm, because the tin is on the inside. Similarly, the external height is 12 cm, so the internal height would be 12 cm minus 0.08 cm (0.04 cm on top and bottom). But I'm not entirely certain about this. Maybe I should proceed with the approximation.

Wait, but using differentials, perhaps we can approximate the change in volume when the radius and height change by small amounts. So the tin's thickness is a small change in radius and height, so the change in volume (which would be the volume of tin) can be approximated using the differential of the volume.

The volume of a cylinder is V = π r² h. So the differential dV would be the approximate change in volume when r changes by dr and h changes by dh. The formula for dV is:

dV = (dV/dr) * dr + (dV/dh) * dh

Where dV/dr is the partial derivative of V with respect to r, which is 2πrh, and dV/dh is πr².

So dV = 2πrh dr + πr² dh.

In this case, the dr is the change in radius due to the tin. If the tin is on the outside, then the radius increases by 0.04 cm, so dr is +0.04 cm. Similarly, the height increases by dh, which would be +0.08 cm because the tin adds 0.04 cm to both the top and bottom. Alternatively, if the tin is on the inside, then dr would be -0.04 cm, and dh would be -0.08 cm.

Wait, but the problem says the can has diameter 8 cm and height 12 cm, and the tin is 0.04 cm thick. So I think the given dimensions are the external ones, so the tin is on the outside, thus the internal dimensions are smaller. So the internal radius is 4 cm - 0.04 cm = 3.96 cm, and internal height is 12 cm - 0.08 cm = 11.92 cm.

But wait, no. Wait, the tin is part of the can, so perhaps the given dimensions are the internal ones? Or maybe it's the external ones. Hmm, the problem isn't entirely clear, but perhaps it's better to assume that the given dimensions are for the internal volume, and the tin adds to the outside, so the external dimensions are larger by twice the thickness.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The tin forms a layer around the can, so the can's internal volume would be smaller by the tin's thickness. So the volume of tin would be the difference between the external volume and the internal volume.

So the external volume is V_external = π R² H, where R is the external radius and H the external height. Similarly, the internal volume is V_internal = π (R - 2dr)² (H - 2dh), assuming that the tin's thickness is dr on the radius and dh on the height. But since the can is closed, the top and bottom each have a thickness of 0.04 cm, so the internal height is H - 2*0.04 cm. Similarly, the internal radius is R - 0.04 cm, because the tin is on the side, adding 0.04 cm to the radius.

Wait, but the problem says the tin is 0.04 cm thick. So perhaps the change in radius is dr = 0.04 cm, and the change in height is dh = 0.04 cm (for each end, so total change in height is 0.08 cm).

Wait, but in that case, the external radius would be r + dr, and the external height would be h + dh. But then the volume of tin would be V_external - V_internal. But since the tin is thin, we can approximate this difference using differentials.

So let me model this: the can's internal dimensions are r = 4 cm, h = 12 cm. The tin adds a thickness dr = 0.04 cm to the radius and dh = 0.04 cm to the height (so total height change is +0.08 cm, because both top and bottom have tin). So the external radius is 4 + 0.04 = 4.04 cm, and external height is 12 + 0.08 = 12.08 cm.

The volume of the tin would be the external volume minus the internal volume. So V_tin = V_external - V_internal = π(4.04)^2 * 12.08 - π(4)^2 * 12.

But calculating that exactly might be a bit tedious, so instead, using differentials, we can approximate this change.

The differential dV is given by:

dV = (2πrh) dr + (πr²) dh.

So plugging in r = 4 cm, h = 12 cm, dr = 0.04 cm, and dh = 0.08 cm.

Wait, but wait a second: if the tin adds 0.04 cm to the radius, then dr is +0.04 cm. Similarly, the height increases by 0.08 cm (because 0.04 cm on top and 0.04 cm on bottom), so dh is +0.08 cm.

So plugging these into the differential:

dV = 2π * 4 * 12 * 0.04 + π * (4)^2 * 0.08.

Let me compute each term.

First term: 2 * π * 4 * 12 * 0.04.

2 * 4 = 8, 8 * 12 = 96, 96 * 0.04 = 3.84. So first term is 3.84 π.

Second term: π * 16 * 0.08.

16 * 0.08 = 1.28, so second term is 1.28 π.

Adding both terms: 3.84 π + 1.28 π = 5.12 π.

Now, 5.12 π is approximately 5.12 * 3.1416 ≈ let's see, 5 * 3.1416 is 15.708, 0.12 * 3.1416 is about 0.37699. So total ≈ 16.085 cm³.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option I: 16 cm³. So the answer might be I.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the signs. Because if the tin is on the outside, then the volume is increasing, so the differential dV would be positive, which would represent the volume of tin. Alternatively, if the given dimensions are the external ones, and the tin is part of that, then perhaps the internal volume is smaller, and the tin's volume is the difference. But in that case, the differential would be the change when the radius decreases by 0.04 and the height decreases by 0.08, so dr is -0.04, dh is -0.08.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify: the problem says the can has diameter 8 cm and height 12 cm, and the tin is 0.04 cm thick. So, are these external or internal dimensions?

If the given dimensions are external, then the internal volume would be smaller. So the tin's volume is external volume minus internal volume. So in this case, the changes would be dr = -0.04 cm (because internal radius is less than external), and dh = -0.08 cm (since internal height is less). So then, the differential dV would be negative, but since we're looking for the volume of tin, perhaps we take the absolute value.

So let's recalculate with dr = -0.04, dh = -0.08.

dV = 2πrh dr + πr² dh.

r is 4 cm, h is 12 cm.

So first term: 2π*4*12*(-0.04) = 2π*4*12*(-0.04) = 2π* (4*12) * (-0.04).

4*12=48, 48*(-0.04)=-1.92. So first term is 2π*(-1.92) = -3.84 π.

Second term: π*(4)^2*(-0.08) = π*16*(-0.08) = -1.28 π.

So dV = (-3.84 -1.28) π = -5.12 π ≈ -16.08 cm³.

But since dV is negative, that would mean the volume is decreasing, so the tin's volume is the absolute value, 16.08 cm³, which aligns with option I: 16 cm³.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed the given dimensions were internal, I got the same value. So either way, the approximation gives about 16 cm³.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: the volume of tin can be considered as the surface area of the can multiplied by the thickness. Because the tin forms a thin layer around the can.

The surface area of a closed cylinder (can) is 2πr(r + h). So that's the lateral surface area plus the top and bottom.

So the surface area SA = 2πr h + 2πr².

Wait, no: the surface area of a closed cylinder is 2πr h (the side) plus 2πr² (the top and bottom). So SA = 2πr h + 2πr².

Then, if the tin's thickness is dr, the volume of tin would be approximately SA * dr. Because each point on the surface is extended outward by dr, so the volume added is the surface area times the small thickness.

But wait, in this case, the tin is 0.04 cm thick, so dr is 0.04 cm. So V_tin ≈ SA * dr.

Let me compute that. SA = 2π*4*12 + 2π*(4)^2.

Compute each part:

2π*4*12 = 96 π.

2π*16 = 32 π.

So SA = 96 π + 32 π = 128 π cm².

Then, V_tin ≈ 128 π * 0.04 = 5.12 π cm³ ≈ 16.08 cm³.

Which is again approximately 16 cm³, so option I.

Hmm, that's a different method but arrives at the same answer. So that seems consistent.

So both methods give me approximately 16 cm³, which is option I.

To estimate the amount of tin in the closed tin can using differentials, we start by noting the given dimensions: diameter = 8 cm (radius \( r = 4 \, \mathrm{cm} \)), height \( h = 12 \, \mathrm{cm} \), and tin thickness \( dr = 0.04 \, \mathrm{cm} \). The height changes by \( dh = 0.08 \, \mathrm{cm} \) (0.04 cm on the top and 0.04 cm on the bottom).

The volume of a cylinder is given by \( V = \pi r^2 h \). The differential \( dV \), which approximates the change in volume due to small changes in \( r \) and \( h \), is:

\[
dV = \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} dr + \frac{\partial V}{\partial h} dh
\]

Here, \( \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} = 2\pi r h \) and \( \frac{\partial V}{\partial h} = \pi r^2 \). Substituting \( r = 4 \, \mathrm{cm} \), \( h = 12 \, \mathrm{cm} \), \( dr = 0.04 \, \mathrm{cm} \), and \( dh = 0.08 \, \mathrm{cm} \):

\[
dV = (2\pi (4)(12))(0.04) + (\pi (4)^2)(0.08)
\]

First term:
\[
2\pi (4)(12)(0.04) = 2\pi (48)(0.04) = 2\pi (1.92) = 3.84\pi
\]

Second term:
\[
\pi (4)^2 (0.08) = \pi (16)(0.08) = 1.28\pi
\]

Adding these terms:
\[
dV = 3.84\pi + 1.28\pi = 5.12\pi
\]

Approximating \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
\[
dV \approx 5.12 (3.1416) \approx 16.08 \, \mathrm{cm}^3
\]

Thus, the estimated volume of tin is approximately \( 16 \, \mathrm{cm}^3 \).

This result is consistent with an alternative approach where the volume of tin is approximated as the surface area of the can multiplied by the thickness of the tin. The surface area of the closed cylinder is:

\[
SA = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2 = 2\pi (4)(12) + 2\pi (4)^2 = 96\pi + 32\pi = 128\pi \, \mathrm{cm}^2
\]

The volume of tin is then:
\[
V_{\text{tin}} \approx SA \cdot dr = 128\pi (0.04) = 5.12\pi \approx 16.08 \, \mathrm{cm}^3
\]

Both methods confirm that the volume of tin is approximately \( 16 \, \mathrm{cm}^3 \).
