Question:

Owner has a property in fee simple absolute. He executes a deed to Friend with the words "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." Under common law principles the conveyance to the heirs is not effective. Thus, the deed would result in a life estate to Friend with a reversion back to Owner. That result is due to what common law doctrine?

Options:

A: The doctrine of eminent domain
B: The rule of survivorship
C: The rule of destructibility of contingent remainders
D: The rule in Shelly's case
E: The doctrine of escheat
F: The doctrine of concurrent ownership
G: The doctrine of worthier title
H: The rule of lapse
I: The rule against perpetuities
J: The doctrine of adverse possession

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with common law doctrines related to estates and future interests. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the owner has a property in fee simple absolute, which I remember means they have complete ownership with no time limits. The owner executes a deed to Friend with the words, "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." So, Friend gets a life estate, and then it's supposed to go to the Owner's heirs. But the question states that under common law, this conveyance to the heirs isn't effective. So, the result is that Friend has a life estate, and the property reverts back to the Owner. I need to figure out which doctrine causes this outcome.

I recall that when a grantor creates a life estate and then tries to convey the remainder to someone else, there are certain rules about what's allowed. One of the key concepts here is the idea of reversion versus remainder. A reversion is the interest that the grantor keeps after conveying a life estate, while a remainder is the interest given to someone else to take effect after the life estate ends.

In this case, the owner is trying to give the remainder to "the heirs of Owner." Wait, but the Owner is still alive, right? Because the Owner is the one executing the deed. So the Owner's heirs would be determined at the time of the Owner's death, not at the time of the conveyance. That makes the remainder contingent because it's subject to the condition that those heirs exist when the Owner dies.

But I'm trying to remember which doctrine makes such a conveyance ineffective. I think it's called the doctrine of worthier title. The worthier title doctrine says that a person cannot give a future interest to their own heirs because it's deemed that the heirs are more "worthy" and the grantor's attempt to create such a remainder is void, causing the interest to revert back to the grantor.

Wait, but another thought: there's also the rule against destructibility of contingent remainders. No, that's when a contingent remainder is destroyed if the condition isn't met by the time the prior estate ends. But in this case, the problem is more about who the remainder is given to, not about the conditions.

Alternatively, I'm thinking about the doctrine of Shelly's case, but I think that applies when there's a life estate followed by a remainder to the grantor's heirs, which in that case, the grantor is deemed to have a fee simple absolute, not a reversion. But wait, no, Shelly's case usually applies when the remainder is in a class that includes the grantor, like a grant to A for life then to the grantor's heirs. In that situation, under Shelly's case, the grantor is treated as having a fee simple, and the life estate is merged, but that's not exactly what's happening here.

Wait, in this question, the grant is to Friend for life, then to the Owner's heirs. So the grantor is the Owner, giving a remainder to their own heirs. That's different from Shelly's case where the grant is to A for life then to the grantor's heirs, but the grantor is the same person, so it's more about the worthier title.

Oh right! The worthier title doctrine prohibits a grantor from giving a future interest to their own heirs because it's seen as an attempt to create an interest that might interfere with the natural descent of property. So when the grantor tries to give a remainder to their own heirs, the common law treats it as ineffective, and the remainder reverts back to the grantor.

So in this case, the conveyance to Friend is a life estate, and the attempted conveyance to the Owner's heirs is invalid. Therefore, after Friend's life estate ends, the property reverts back to the Owner, meaning the Owner has a reversion.

The options are:

A: Eminent domain - No, that's about the government taking property.

B: Survivorship - That's about joint tenancy, not applicable here.

C: Destructibility of contingent remainders - That deals with conditions not being met, not about the grantee being heirs.

D: Rule in Shelly's case - That's when the grant is to someone for life then to the grantor's heirs, but in that case, the grantor's remainder is struck, and the grantor gets the fee. Hmm, wait, but in this question, the grant is to Friend for life, then to Owner's heirs, so maybe Shelly's case doesn't apply directly because Shelly's case is more when the grantor is trying to retain a remainder in themselves indirectly.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the two doctrines. Let me think again. Shelly's case applies when a grant is made to A for life, then to the grantor's heirs. In that case, the grantor is deemed to have a reversion, but under Shelly's case, it's converted into a fee simple, and the life estate is merged. So A gets a life estate, and the grantor has a fee simple. But wait, in that scenario, the remainder to the grantor's heirs is invalid because of Shelly's case.

Wait no, Shelly's case typically applies when the grant is to A for life, then to the grantor's heirs, which under common law, the grantor is deemed to have a fee simple, so the life estate and the remainder merge, giving the grantor the fee. But in this question, the grant is to Friend for life, then to the grantor's (Owner's) heirs, which would mean that the grantor is trying to create a remainder in their own heirs. So that's where the worthier title doctrine comes in, making that remainder invalid, so the reversion remains in the grantor.

So the correct doctrine is the doctrine of worthier title, which is option G.

I think I mixed up Shelly's case and worthier title before. Shelly's case is more about when the same grantor's heirs are named as the remaindermen after a life estate, but that's for when the grantor is trying to retain a future interest, not when they're giving it to someone else. Wait, no, Shelly's case actually applies when the grant is to a life tenant followed by the grantor's heirs. In that situation, under Shelly's case, the grantor is deemed to have a fee simple, and the remainder is stricken because the grantor and their heirs are the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the correct answer is the worthier title doctrine, which says that a grantor cannot create a future interest in their own heirs because it's considered a worthier title for the property to go through natural descent rather than by the grantor's conveyance.

So in the scenario, the grant is to Friend for life, then to the Owner's heirs. Since the Owner is alive, the heirs are uncertain, but the doctrine of worthier title says that the grantor can't give the remainder to their own heirs; it's void. So the remainder is ineffective, and the property reverts back to the grantor after the life estate.

Therefore, the correct answer is G: The doctrine of worthier title.

The question involves a property law scenario where the owner conveys a life estate to Friend with the words, "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." Under common law, this conveyance to the heirs is ineffective, resulting in a life estate for Friend and a reversion to the Owner. The task is to identify the doctrine responsible for this outcome.

The key issue lies in the attempted conveyance of a remainder to the Owner's heirs. At the time of the conveyance, the Owner is still alive, and their heirs are uncertain. Common law prohibits a grantor from creating a future interest in their own heirs due to the doctrine of worthier title. This doctrine deems such a conveyance void because it interferes with the natural descent of property. As a result, the remainder to the heirs is struck, and the property reverts to the Owner after Friend's life estate ends.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: The doctrine of eminent domain** – Incorrect. This doctrine involves government taking of property, not applicable here.
- **B: The rule of survivorship** – Incorrect. This pertains to joint tenancy, not relevant to the scenario.
- **C: The rule of destructibility of contingent remainders** – Incorrect. This deals with conditions not being met, not the issue of heirs as remaindermen.
- **D: The rule in Shelly's case** – Incorrect. While Shelly's case involves life estates and remainders to the grantor's heirs, it applies when the grantor retains an interest, which is not the case here.
- **E: The doctrine of escheat** – Incorrect. This involves property reverting to the state, not applicable here.
- **F: The doctrine of concurrent ownership** – Incorrect. This pertains to shared ownership, not relevant to the scenario.
- **G: The doctrine of worthier title** – Correct. This doctrine prohibits a grantor from creating a future interest in their own heirs, making the conveyance to the heirs ineffective.
- **H: The rule of lapse** – Incorrect. This involves the forfeiture of an interest due to disqualification, not relevant here.
- **I: The rule against perpetuities** – Incorrect. This pertains to interests that may vest too remotely in the future, not applicable here.
- **J: The doctrine of adverse possession** – Incorrect. This involves gaining title through unauthorized possession, not relevant to the scenario.

The correct answer is **G: The doctrine of worthier title**, as it explains why the conveyance to the Owner's heirs is ineffective, resulting in a reversion to the Owner.
