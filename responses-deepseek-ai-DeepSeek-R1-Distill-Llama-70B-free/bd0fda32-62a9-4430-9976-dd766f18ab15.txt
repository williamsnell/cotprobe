Question:

A planning engineer for a new alum plant must present some estimates to his company regarding the capacity of a silo designed to contain bauxite ore until it is processed into alum. The ore resembles pink talcum powder and is poured from a conveyor at the top of the silo. The silo is a cylinder $100 \mathrm{ft}$ high with a radius of $200 \mathrm{ft}$. The conveyor carries ore at a rate of $60,000 \pi \mathrm{~ft}^3 / \mathrm{h}$ and the ore maintains a conical shape whose radius is 1.5 times its height. If, at a certain time $t$, the pile is $60 \mathrm{ft}$ high, how long will it take for the pile to reach the top of the silo?

Options:

A: 10.5 $\mathrm{h}$
B: 15.7 $\mathrm{h}$
C: 16.4 $\mathrm{h}$
D:  9.8 $\mathrm{h}$
E: 13.3 $\mathrm{h}$
F: 14.0 $\mathrm{h}$
G: 8.5 $\mathrm{h}$
H: 11.2 $\mathrm{h}$
I: 12.6 $\mathrm{h}$
J: 7.2 $\mathrm{h}$

Okay, so I've got this problem about a silo being filled with bauxite ore, and I need to figure out how long it'll take for the pile to reach the top. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me get the details straight. The silo is a cylinder, right? It's 100 ft high and has a radius of 200 ft. So the volume of the silo would be πr²h. Plugging in the numbers, that's π*(200)^2*100. Let me calculate that. 200 squared is 40,000, times 100 is 4,000,000. So the silo's volume is 4,000,000π cubic feet.

But wait, the ore forms a conical shape inside the silo. The problem says the radius of the cone is 1.5 times its height. So for any height h, the radius r is 1.5h. The volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h. Substituting r with 1.5h, the volume becomes (1/3)π*(1.5h)^2*h.

Let me compute that. (1.5)^2 is 2.25, so 2.25h². Then multiply by h: 2.25h³. So the volume is (1/3)π*2.25h³. Let me calculate that. 2.25 divided by 3 is 0.75, so the volume is 0.75πh³. So V = (3/4)πh³? Wait, 0.75 is 3/4, right. So yes, V = (3/4)πh³.

Now, the conveyor is adding ore at a rate of 60,000π ft³ per hour. So the rate of change of volume with respect to time is dV/dt = 60,000π.

I think I need to relate the rate of change of volume to the rate of change of height, then integrate to find the time it takes to go from the current height to 100 ft.

So, let's take the derivative of the volume with respect to time. We have V = (3/4)πh³. So dV/dt = (3/4)π * 3h² dh/dt. Simplifying, that's (9/4)π h² (dh/dt).

But wait, we know dV/dt is 60,000π. So:

(9/4)π h² (dh/dt) = 60,000π

I can cancel π from both sides:

(9/4) h² (dh/dt) = 60,000

Then, solve for dh/dt:

dh/dt = (60,000 *4) / (9 h²) = (240,000) / (9 h²) = 80,000 / (3 h²)

Wait, let me compute 60,000 * 4 = 240,000, divided by 9 is 240,000/9. Let me compute that: 240,000 /9 is approximately 26,666.666... So dh/dt = 26,666.6667 / h².

Wait, but maybe I should keep it as a fraction. 240,000/9 simplifies to 80,000/3 because 240,000 divided by 3 is 80,000, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. So yes, 80,000/(3 h²).

So, dh/dt = 80,000/(3 h²).

But to find the time when the height goes from 60 ft to 100 ft, I need to integrate dh/dt with respect to time. Alternatively, I can express time as a function of h and integrate.

Let me rearrange the equation to get dh/dt = 80,000/(3 h²). So, dt = (3 h²)/80,000 dh.

I need to integrate this from h=60 to h=100. So the time t is the integral from 60 to 100 of (3 h²)/(80,000) dh.

Let me set up the integral:

t = ∫ (3 h²)/(80,000) dh from 60 to 100.

I can factor out the constants:

t = (3)/(80,000) ∫ h² dh from 60 to 100.

The integral of h² is (1/3) h³. So:

t = (3)/(80,000) * [ (1/3)(100)^3 - (1/3)(60)^3 ) ]

Simplify this:

t = (3)/(80,000) * (1/3) [100³ - 60³ ]

The 3 in numerator and denominator cancel out, so:

t = (1)/(80,000) [1,000,000 - 216,000 ]

Compute 1,000,000 - 216,000 = 784,000.

So,

t = 784,000 / 80,000.

Simplify this division: 784,000 ÷ 80,000 = 9.8 hours.

Wait, but that's only 9.8 hours? Let me check my steps again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in computing the integral. Let me review.

Wait, the integral was from h=60 to h=100. So I had t = (3)/(80,000) * (1/3)(h³ evaluated from 60 to 100).

So 3/80,000 * 1/3 is 1/80,000. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, when I calculated 100^3, it's 1,000,000. 60^3 is 216,000. Subtracting gives 784,000. So 784,000 divided by 80,000 is 9.8.

Hmm, 9.8 hours is option D.

Wait, but the options list includes E:13.3, F:14, and others. So why am I getting 9.8? Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me check the setup again.

The volume of the cone is V = (1/3)πr²h. The radius is 1.5h, so r = 1.5h. So r squared is (2.25 h²). So V = (1/3)π * 2.25 h^3 = (2.25/3) π h^3 = 0.75 π h^3. So that part is correct.

Then dV/dt = 60,000π. So differentiating V = 0.75 π h³:

dV/dt = 0.75 π * 3 h² (dh/dt) = 2.25 π h² (dh/dt).

Wait! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the differentiation step earlier. Let me redo that.

V = 0.75 π h³.

So dV/dt = 0.75 * π * 3 h² * dh/dt.

Which is 2.25 π h² (dh/dt).

Ah, earlier I wrote 9/4 π h², but 0.75 is 3/4. 3/4 * 3 is 9/4? Wait, 3/4 *3 is 9/4? No, wait, 3/4 *3 is 9/4? Let me compute 3/4 *3: 9/4. Oh, but 3/4 *3 is 9/4, which is 2.25. So that part is correct.

Wait, so earlier, when I wrote dV/dt = (9/4) π h² (dh/dt), that's correct. So 9/4 is 2.25.

So, 9/4 π h² (dh/dt) = 60,000 π.

Cancel π: (9/4) h² (dh/dt) = 60,000.

So dh/dt = (60,000 *4)/(9 h²) = 240,000/(9 h²) = 26,666.6667/h².

Wait, 240,000 ÷9 is 26,666.666..., which is 80,000/3. So dh/dt = (80,000/3) / h².

So when I take the reciprocal to integrate for time, dt = (3 h²)/(80,000) dh.

So integrating from 60 to 100:

t = ∫ (3 h²)/(80,000) dh from 60 to 100.

Which is (3/(80,000)) * [ h^3 /3 ] from 60 to 100.

The 3s cancel, so [ h^3 ] from 60 to 100 divided by 80,000.

So (100^3 -60^3) /80,000.

100^3 is 1e6, 60^3 is 216,000.

1e6 - 216,000 = 784,000.

784,000 /80,000 = 9.8 hours. So that's 9.8 hours, which is option D.

Wait, but the options include D as 9.8. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait, earlier I thought the silo's height is 100 ft, but the radius is 200 ft. So when the pile reaches 100 ft in height, the radius would be 1.5 *100=150 ft. But the silo's radius is 200 ft, so that's fine, there's space.

So the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be D:9.8 hr.

To determine how long it will take for the pile of bauxite ore to reach the top of the silo, we start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Silo Dimensions**: The silo is a cylinder with a height of \(100 \, \text{ft}\) and a radius of \(200 \, \text{ft}\). The volume of the silo is calculated as:
   \[
   V_{\text{silo}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (200)^2 (100) = 4,000,000 \pi \, \text{ft}^3.
   \]

2. **Ore Shape and Volume**: The bauxite ore forms a cone inside the silo, where the radius of the cone is \(1.5\) times its height (\(r = 1.5h\)). The volume of a cone is given by:
   \[
   V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h.
   \]
   Substituting \(r = 1.5h\), the volume becomes:
   \[
   V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (1.5h)^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi (2.25h^2) h = 0.75 \pi h^3.
   \]

3. **Rate of Volume Change**: The conveyor fills the silo at a rate of \(60,000 \pi \, \text{ft}^3/\text{h}\), so:
   \[
   \frac{dV}{dt} = 60,000 \pi.
   \]
   Differentiating the volume of the cone with respect to time:
   \[
   \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left(0.75 \pi h^3\right) = 2.25 \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}.
   \]
   Equating this to the given rate:
   \[
   2.25 \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt} = 60,000 \pi.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{60,000}{2.25 h^2} = \frac{26,666.67}{h^2}.
   \]

4. **Time to Reach the Top**: To find the time it takes for the height of the pile to increase from \(60 \, \text{ft}\) to \(100 \, \text{ft}\), we integrate:
   \[
   t = \int_{60}^{100} \frac{1}{\frac{dh}{dt}} \, dh = \int_{60}^{100} \frac{h^2}{26,666.67} \, dh.
   \]
   Factoring out constants:
   \[
   t = \frac{1}{26,666.67} \int_{60}^{100} h^2 \, dh.
   \]
   The integral of \(h^2\) is \(\frac{h^3}{3}\), so:
   \[
   t = \frac{1}{26,666.67} \left[\frac{h^3}{3}\right]_{60}^{100}.
   \]
   Substituting the limits:
   \[
   t = \frac{1}{26,666.67} \left[\frac{100^3}{3} - \frac{60^3}{3}\right] = \frac{1}{26,666.67} \left[\frac{1,000,000}{3} - \frac{216,000}{3}\right].
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   t = \frac{1}{26,666.67} \cdot \frac{784,000}{3}.
   \]
   Compute:
   \[
   t = \frac{784,000}{80,000} = 9.8 \, \text{hours}.
   \]

Thus, the time it will take for the pile to reach the top of the silo is **9.8 hours**.
