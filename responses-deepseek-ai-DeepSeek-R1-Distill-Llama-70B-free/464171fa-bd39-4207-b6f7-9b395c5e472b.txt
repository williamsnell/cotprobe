Okay, so I've got this question here: "How long is a single term in the US Senate?" The options are A through J, with various years listed. I need to figure out the correct answer.

Hmm, I remember that the US government has three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative branch is Congress, which is split into two parts: the House of Representatives and the Senate. I think the Senate is the upper house.

Wait, I'm trying to recall how long the terms are for each. The House of Representatives has members who serve shorter terms, while the Senate has longer. I think Representatives serve two years, right? Because I remember something about all House seats being up for election every two years. So that would mean Senators have longer terms.

What's the term length for Senators? I'm pretty sure it's six years. Let me think why. Maybe because the Founding Fathers wanted the Senate to be more stable, less subject to the whims of public opinion, so they gave them longer terms. Also, the Senate has staggered terms, so not all Senators are elected at the same time. That way, there's continuity.

So the options given are: A is five years, B is three, C ten, D two, E six, F seven, G twelve, H eight, I four, J one. So the correct one should be E: six years.

Wait, to double-check, I think the 17th Amendment deals with the election of Senators, but that's more about how they're elected by popular vote now, not the term length. The original Constitution set the term at six years. So yes, each Senator serves a six-year term.
