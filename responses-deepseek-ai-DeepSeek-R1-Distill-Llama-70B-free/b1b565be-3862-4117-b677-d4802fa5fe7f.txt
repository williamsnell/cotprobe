Okay, so I have this problem here about selling a plot of land and calculating the gross selling price and then the net after a commission. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the land is 100 feet by 40 feet. Wait, but when they talk about selling price per front foot, I think that refers to the frontage. So the front foot would be the length along the road, right? So the frontage here is 100 feet because that's the longer side. So the plot is 100 feet wide (front) and 40 feet deep.

The selling price is $75 per front foot. So to find the gross selling price, I guess I need to multiply the frontage by the price per front foot. So that's 100 feet * $75 per foot. Let me calculate that. 100 times 75 is 7500, so $7,500. So the gross selling price is $7,500. Let me check the options, option D is $7,500. So that's part one done.

Now, the next part is about the broker's commission. The commission is 7 and a half percent. So 7.5% commission on the gross selling price. I need to calculate 7.5% of $7,500 and then subtract that from the gross to get the net selling price.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the net selling price is what's left after the commission is paid. So first, calculate the commission amount, then subtract it from $7,500.

So 7.5% as a decimal is 0.075. So 7,500 multiplied by 0.075. Let me do that. 

Calculating 7,500 * 0.075. Hmm, 7,500 times 0.07 is 525, and 7,500 times 0.005 is 37.5. Adding those together, 525 + 37.5 equals 562.5. So the commission is $562.50.

Now, subtract that from $7,500 to get the net. So 7,500 minus 562.50 equals... let's see, 7,500 minus 500 is 7,000, minus another 62.50 is 6,437.50. Wait, that doesn't seem to match any of the options. Wait a minute, did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the commission. Let me try another way. 10% of 7,500 is 750. 7.5% is three-quarters of 10%, so 750 * 0.75. 750 times 0.75 is 562.50. So that's correct.

But looking at the options, I don't see $6,437.50. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

Wait, the question says "Compute the gross selling price. The broker receives a 7(1/2)% commission. Find the net selling price."

So the options are for the net selling price. Let me look at the choices again.

The options are A through J. Looking through them, I see option C is $2,625, which is much lower. Option D is $7,500, which is the gross. Option E is $2,850, F is $2,775, G is $3,000, H is $2,925, I is $3,150, J is $225.

Wait, none of these match $6,437.50. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding what's being asked. Let me think again.

Wait, the land is 100 by 40. Maybe the front foot is 40 feet? But that seems unlikely, because typically frontage is the longer side. But perhaps in some cases, it's the shorter side if that's the front.

Wait, perhaps the front is 40 feet. So the front foot is 40, so 40 times $75. That would be 40*75= $3,000. So the gross would be $3,000, which is option G.

Then the commission would be 7.5% of 3,000, which is 225. So net is 3,000-225=2,775. Which is option F.

Wait, but why would the front foot be 40? Because the plot is 100x40, perhaps the front is 40 feet. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

I think the confusion comes from whether the front foot is the length or the width. Typically, front foot refers to the street frontage, which is the longer side, so 100 feet. But perhaps in this problem, the front is 40 feet. So the initial calculation might have been wrong.

So let's recalculate both possibilities.

First possibility: front is 100 feet.

Gross = 100 *75 = $7,500.

Commission: 7.5% of 7,500 is 562.50.

Net = 7,500 -562.50 = 6,937.50.

But none of the options match that.

Second possibility: front is 40 feet.

Gross =40 *75= $3,000.

Commission=7.5% of 3,000= 225.

Net = 3,000-225=2,775, which is option F.

Looking at the options, F is $2,775. So perhaps the correct approach is front foot is 40.

But I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the question again.

The plot is 100 feet by 40 feet. It's sold for $75 a front foot. So front foot is the frontage, which is the side along the street. So if the plot is 100 by 40, the front could be either 100 or 40, depending on how it's oriented.

Wait, perhaps the front is the 100 feet side, but that gives a net of 6,437.50, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that I'm calculating the net incorrectly. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the commission is calculated on the selling price, so the net is the selling price minus commission. But perhaps the question is asking for the net, which is (gross) minus (commission). So in the first approach, front is 100, gross is 7,500, commission 562.50, net is 6,937.50, but that isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the front foot is 40, so gross is 3,000, commission is 225, net 2,775, which is option F.

But wait, the options don't have the first part as 7,500. So perhaps the initial step is correct, but then why the options don't have the net as 6,937.50.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the commission amount, but no, the question is to find the net selling price.

Wait, perhaps the commission is a percentage of the net, but that's not standard. Usually, commission is on the gross.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the area is 100x40=4,000 sq ft. But the selling is per front foot, so area isn't directly relevant.

Let me check the options again. The given options for net are in the 2,000s and 3,000s.

If I take the front as 40, then the net is 2,775, which is option F.

But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the first part of the question is to compute the gross selling price, which would be 100*75=7,500 (option D). But the second part is the net, which is 7,500 minus 562.50=6,937.50, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the front is 40. So gross is 3,000 (option G), commission 225, net 2,775 (option F). So the answer would be F.

But why would the front be 40? Maybe the problem considers the front as the shorter side.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the front is 100 feet, and the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the commission.

Wait, let me re-calculate 7.5% of 7,500. 7.5% is 0.075. 7,500 *0.075 = 562.50. So 7,500 - 562.50 = 6,937.50.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the front is 40, making the net 2,775, which is option F.

Therefore, the correct answer would be F: $2,775.00.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the gross selling price and then determine the net selling price after deducting the broker's commission.

1. **Gross Selling Price**:  
   The plot of land is 100 feet by 40 feet, and the selling price is $75 per front foot. The front foot refers to the frontage, which is typically the longer side of the plot. Therefore, the frontage is 100 feet.  
   \[
   \text{Gross Selling Price} = 100 \, \text{feet} \times \$75/\text{foot} = \$7,500
   \]  
   This matches option D.

2. **Broker's Commission**:  
   The broker receives a commission of \(7\frac{1}{2}\%\), which is equivalent to \(7.5\%\) or \(0.075\) in decimal form. The commission is calculated on the gross selling price:  
   \[
   \text{Commission} = \$7,500 \times 0.075 = \$562.50
   \]

3. **Net Selling Price**:  
   The net selling price is the gross selling price minus the commission:  
   \[
   \text{Net Selling Price} = \$7,500 - \$562.50 = \$6,937.50
   \]  
   However, \$6,937.50 is not one of the provided options.

Given this discrepancy, we reconsider the interpretation of the frontage. If the frontage is assumed to be the shorter side (40 feet) instead of the longer side (100 feet), the calculations change as follows:  
   \[
   \text{Gross Selling Price} = 40 \, \text{feet} \times \$75/\text{foot} = \$3,000
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Commission} = \$3,000 \times 0.075 = \$225
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Net Selling Price} = \$3,000 - \$225 = \$2,775
   \]  
   This matches option F.

Thus, assuming the frontage is 40 feet, the correct answer is **F: \$2,775.00**.
