Okay, so I have this question about Marxist feminists and patriarchy. I'm a bit rusty on my feminist theories, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about Marxist feminism.

Marxist feminism, as the name suggests, combines the ideas of Marxism with feminist theory. Marxism is all about class struggle and the exploitation of the working class by the capitalist class. So, Marxist feminists probably look at how capitalism contributes to women's oppression.

The question is asking how Marxist feminists explain patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a system where men hold power and control over women, but I think Marxist feminists would link this to economic structures rather than just social or cultural norms.

Looking at the options:

A: The capitalist system being inherently biased against women. Hmm, that sounds possible. It suggests that capitalism itself has biases against women, which could tie into how women are exploited.

B: The exploitation of women's emotional labour by the capitalist system. Emotional labour refers to the unpaid work women often do, like managing emotions and household tasks. Marxist feminists do talk about how this labour isn't valued in a capitalist economy, which could be a form of exploitation.

C: Societal norms and traditions that favour men. That's a more general explanation of patriarchy, maybe from a different feminist perspective, like liberal or radical feminism, which focus on culture and society rather than economics.

D: Inherent biological differences. I don't think Marxist feminists would agree with this because they focus on social and economic structures, not biology. Biological differences are more of a essentialist view, which might be critiqued by feminists.

E: Lack of equal rights and opportunities. That's more of a liberal feminist approach, emphasizing legal and political equality rather than economic structures.

F: Women's domestic labour being exploited by the capitalist economy. This rings a bell. I remember that Marxist feminists argue that women's unpaid domestic work is essential for the capitalist system because it allows for the reproduction of the workforce (like raising children, taking care of the home) without costing the capitalist anything. So the exploitation here is about not recognizing the value of this labor and not compensating it, which perpetuates women's oppression within capitalism.

Wait, so options A, B, F are all related to capitalism. Let me clarify. Option A says the system is biased against women, which is a bit broad. Option B is about emotional labor, which is part of the domestic labor. Option F specifically mentions domestic labor being exploited. So which is it?

I think the key here is that Marxist feminists focus on the economic base and how capitalism exploits women's labor in the home. So F seems to be the correct answer because it directly ties into the idea that domestic labor is part of the capitalist exploitation, supporting the system by providing free labor that reproduces the workforce.

Alternatively, option B is about emotional labor, which is a subset of domestic labor. But I think F is a broader and more accurate answer because it's about the labor itself being exploited, not just the emotional aspect.

So putting it all together, the answer should be F.

Marxist feminists explain patriarchy in terms of the exploitation of women's domestic labour by the capitalist economy. This perspective highlights how unpaid domestic work, essential for the reproduction of the workforce, is not valued or compensated under capitalism, thereby perpetuating women's oppression.

Answer: F
