Okay, so I have this question about which natural disaster caused the most deaths in the 20th century. The options are from A to J, each being a different type of disaster. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer.

First, I should probably recall what I know about natural disasters and their impact. I remember that floods are pretty common and can affect a lot of people. Like, river floods, flash floods, etc. They can cause widespread damage and loss of life, especially in densely populated areas.

Then there are earthquakes. They can be really deadly, especially if they hit urban areas. Earthquakes can cause buildings to collapse, leading to a lot of casualties. But I'm not sure if they top the list for the entire century.

Hurricanes are another big one. They bring strong winds and storm surges which can inundate coastal areas. I remember Hurricane Katrina in 2005 causing a lot of deaths, but that's in the 21st century. In the 20th, maybe the 1900 Galveston Hurricane was one of the deadliest. It killed like 6,000 to 12,000 people, which is a lot, but was that the highest?

Droughts can lead to famines, which over time can kill millions. For example, the Chinese Great Leap Forward in the late 50s led to a famine where millions died, but that's more of a man-made disaster combined with natural factors. I'm not sure if droughts alone count or if they're considered separate from the resulting famines.

Volcanic activity can cause direct deaths from eruptions, but also indirect through things like ash in the atmosphere causing climate changes. But I don't think volcanic eruptions have caused as many deaths as other disasters in the 20th century.

Tsunamis, like the 2004 Indian Ocean one, caused massive deaths, but that was in 2004, so maybe the 20th century saw others. Still, I don't think tsunamis were the top cause.

Landslides and avalanches are more localized. They can be deadly, but probably not on the same scale as floods or earthquakes.

Heatwaves can kill a lot of people, especially the vulnerable. The 1936 heatwave in the US or the 2003 European heatwave, but again, I'm not sure if they sum up to the highest in the 20th century.

Putting this together, I think floods might be the answer. They happen frequently and affect large populations. For example, the 1931 China floods were one of the deadliest natural disasters ever, with estimates of around 4 million deaths. That alone would make floods a major contributor. Even without that single event, the cumulative effect of floods across the century probably makes them the top cause.

So, the answer should be G: Floods.

The natural disaster responsible for the most deaths in the 20th century was floods. Events like the 1931 China floods, which caused an estimated 4 million deaths, highlight the devastating impact of floods. Their frequency and effect on large populations make them the leading cause of fatalities among the listed options.

G: Floods

Answer: G
