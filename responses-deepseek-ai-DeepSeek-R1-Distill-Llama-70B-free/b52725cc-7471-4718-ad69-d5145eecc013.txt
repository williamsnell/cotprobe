Question:

What is the major difference between naturalism and positivism?

Options:

A: On the one hand, naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand, positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires
B: While naturalism serves only the theory human rights law, positivism has a wider and more general scope
C: Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such
D: Naturalism is a school of thought advocated outside of Europe, while positivism is Euro-centric theory

Okay, so I have this question about the differences between naturalism and positivism. I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but I remember they're related to legal and political philosophy. Let me think this through.

Naturalism, from what I recall, has to do with natural law. That's the idea that there are certain universal principles or rights that come from nature or morality, not from human-made laws. So natural law is like a higher law that exists regardless of what states or governments say. For example, human rights are often seen as part of natural law—inalienable and universal.

Positivism, on the other hand, is more about positive law, which is law that's created by humans. This could be statutes, regulations, or court decisions. Positivists focus on the actual laws as they are written and enforced, rather than on any higher moral principles. So, for positivists, the legality of something is based on whether it follows the man-made laws, not on whether it's morally right according to some natural standard.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly captures this difference. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Says naturalism is based on universal and objective rules, while positivism is based on a structured legal system created by states. That sounds close. Naturalism is about universal rules, positivism about state-made laws. So this seems correct, but let me check the others.

Option B: Says naturalism is only for human rights law, positivism is broader. I don't think that's right. Naturalism isn't limited to human rights law specifically; it's a broader legal philosophy. Positivism is a general approach, so B might not be accurate.

Option C: States that naturalism concerns the underlying values of international society, while positivism focuses on the rules themselves. Hmm, that makes sense. Naturalism is about the values (like justice, rights), positivism about the actual rules. So C could be correct.

Option D: Talks about geography, naturalism outside Europe and positivism Euro-centric. I don't remember anything about their origins being tied to regions like that. So D is probably wrong.

Wait, so the main difference is between universal moral principles (naturalism) and man-made laws (positivism). Which option reflects that?

Option A says naturalism has universal rules, positivism is created by states. Option C says naturalism is about underlying values, positivism about the rules. Both seem related but A might be more about the source of law, while C is about values vs. rules.

The question is about the major difference. Naturalism is about higher, universal principles, while positivism is about the actual legal rules created by humans. So in terms of the source of law's authority, A is about that. C is more about the content—values vs. rules.

Wait, the question is phrased as the major difference. I think the key is that naturalism posits that law is based on natural principles, while positivism says law is based on human-made (state) rules. So option A is correct because it's about the basis of the rules—naturalism being universal and objective, positivism being state-created.

Alternatively, option C is about the focus—values vs. rules. I'm a bit torn. But I think the primary distinction is the source. So A is the better answer.

Wait, no. Another approach: Naturalism is concerned with what the law should be based on morality, while positivism is about what the law is, regardless of morality. So the major difference is between law based on moral principles (naturalism) and law based on human enactment (positivism). Which matches option A.

But wait, option C says naturalism is about the underlying values, positivism about the rules. That also seems to align. So I'm a bit confused between A and C.

Let me think again. Naturalism is about the moral underpinnings, the values that law should reflect. Positivism is about the actual rules as they exist, made by states. So option C says naturalism concerns the underpinning values, positivism the rules. That seems accurate.

Wait, but the question is about the major difference. So perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, the initial thought was that A is about the basis of the law, which is a key difference. But I think the more precise answer is C because it's about the focus—values vs. rules.

Alternatively, naturalism is concerned with the moral principles that should underpin the law, while positivism focuses on the actual rules as created. So C is correct.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is C.

The major difference between naturalism and positivism lies in their focus and underlying principles. Naturalism is concerned with the moral and ethical values that should underpin the law, emphasizing universal principles and higher moral standards. Positivism, on the other hand, focuses on the actual rules and laws as they are created and enforced by states, without necessarily considering their moral underpinnings. This distinction highlights that naturalism is about the values that law should reflect, while positivism is about the rules as they exist. 

Given the options, the correct answer is:

C: Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such.
