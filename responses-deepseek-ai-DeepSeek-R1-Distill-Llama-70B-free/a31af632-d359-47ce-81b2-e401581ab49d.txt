Question:

Kirk and Martin are partners and have agreed that, after interest at 6% is allowed on average investment, Kirk will receive one third and Martin two thirds of the remaining profits. On Jan. 1, Kirk's net worth was $72,000 and Martin's was $63,000. Kirk withdrew $3,000 on July 1 and made an additional investment of $1,200 on Nov, 1. On Aug. 1 Martin withdrew $1,800. If profits for the year amounted to $37,080, what was each partner's share?

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about partners Kirk and Martin. Hmm, I remember that partnership profits are usually divided based on their agreements, but there's also interest on their investments. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out each partner's average investment during the year because the interest is calculated on that. The interest rate is 6%, and after that, Kirk gets one-third of the remaining profits and Martin gets two-thirds. The total profit is $37,080, but I can't just split that directly because of the interest part.

Let's start by calculating Kirk's investment. On Jan 1, his net worth was $72,000. But he made some withdrawals and additional investments. He withdrew $3,000 on July 1 and added $1,200 on Nov 1. So how do these affect his average investment?

I think the way to calculate average capital is to consider the amount invested each period and weight them by the time they were in the business during the year. So for Kirk:

From Jan 1 to June 30 (that's 6 months), he had $72,000. Then on July 1, he withdrew $3,000, so his capital becomes $72,000 - $3,000 = $69,000. But wait, actually, when a partner withdraws cash, does that reduce their capital? I think so. So from July 1 to Oct 31, he has $69,000. Then on Nov 1, he adds $1,200, making it $70,200. That's from Nov 1 to Dec 31, which is 2 months.

Wait, the time periods would be:

- Jan 1 to June 30: 6 months (72,000)
- July 1 to Oct 31: 4 months (69,000)
- Nov 1 to Dec 31: 2 months (70,200)

So each period multiplied by the number of months, summed, then divided by 12 for the average.

Calculating Kirk's average investment:

6 months * 72,000 = 432,000
4 months * 69,000 = 276,000
2 months * 70,200 = 140,400
Total = 432,000 + 276,000 + 140,400 = 848,400
Average = 848,400 / 12 = 70,700

Wait, let me check that again. 6+4+2=12 months total, so yes, dividing by 12. So Kirk's average investment is $70,700.

Now for Martin. His starting net worth was $63,000. He withdrew $1,800 on Aug 1. So how does that affect his average capital?

From Jan 1 to July 31: 7 months (assuming the withdrawal is on Aug 1, so up to July 31 is 7 months). Wait, wait, Aug 1 is the date of withdrawal, so the period before is Jan 1 to July 31, which is 7 months. After that, his capital is $63,000 - $1,800 = $61,200 from Aug 1 to Dec 31, which is 5 months.

So Martin's average investment:

7 months * 63,000 = 441,000
5 months * 61,200 = 306,000
Total = 441,000 + 306,000 = 747,000
Average = 747,000 / 12 = 62,250

Wait, 7+5=12 months, so dividing by 12, correct.

Now, we calculate the interest on each partner's average investment at 6%. So for Kirk:

Interest = 70,700 * 6% = 0.06 * 70,700 = 4,242

Martin's interest:

62,250 * 6% = 3,735

Total interest allowed is 4,242 + 3,735 = 7,977

Now, the total profit is $37,080. Before splitting the remaining profit, we subtract the interest because that's considered a return on investment, not part of the profit sharing. So the remaining profit is 37,080 - 7,977 = 29,103.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. Oh, no, wait—the interest is allowed on their average investment, so it's an expense charged against the profits. So the total profit is first reduced by the total interest, and then the remaining is split according to their agreement.

So, total interest is $7,977. So remaining profit is 37,080 - 7,977 = 29,103.

Now, according to their agreement, Kirk gets 1/3 and Martin 2/3 of this remaining profit.

Kirk's share: 29,103 * (1/3) = 9,701
Martin's share: 29,103 * (2/3) = 19,402

Wait, but wait—I'm not sure if this is correct. Because the interest is allowed on each partner's investment, perhaps each partner's interest is treated as their entitlement, and only the remaining profit is split. So perhaps Kirk would get his interest plus 1/3 of the remaining, and same for Martin.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is:

Total profits are $37,080.

First, each partner is allowed interest on their average investment, so we calculate each partner's interest and then subtract the sum from the total profits. Then the remaining is split as per the profit-sharing ratio.

So yes, that's what I did. Total interest is 7,977. So 37,080 - 7,977 = 29,103.

Split 29,103 as 1/3 to Kirk and 2/3 to Martin.

So Kirk gets 9,701, Martin 19,402.

Wait, but then adding their interest, because the interest is part of their total share.

Wait no, no. The interest is allowed on their investment, so each partner's total share would be their interest plus their share of the remaining profit. Because the interest is considered as their minimum return before splitting the remaining profit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:

- The total profit is $37,080.

- Each partner is entitled to interest on their average investment. So Kirk gets 6% of 70,700 = 4,242. Martin gets 6% of 62,250 = 3,735.

- The total interest is 4,242 + 3,735 = 7,977.

- The remaining profit after allowing interest is 37,080 - 7,977 = 29,103.

- This remaining amount is split per the ratio: Kirk 1/3, Martin 2/3.

So Kirk gets 1/3 of 29,103 = 9,701, and Martin gets 2/3 = 19,402.

But wait, each partner's total share is interest plus their part of the remaining profit.

So Kirk's total share is 4,242 (interest) + 9,701 (profit share) = 13,943.

Martin's total share is 3,735 (interest) + 19,402 (profit share) = 23,137.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check. Option J says Kirk's share is $13,943 and Martin's is $23,137. That matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the average investments. Let me recheck.

Kirk's average investment:

Jan 1 to June 30: 6 months at 72,000.

July 1 to Oct 31: 4 months at 69,000.

Nov 1 to Dec 31: 2 months at 70,200.

So (6*72000 + 4*69000 + 2*70200) / 12.

Calculate each term:

6*72,000 = 432,000

4*69,000 = 276,000

2*70,200 = 140,400

Total: 432,000 + 276,000 = 708,000; 708,000 + 140,400 = 848,400.

848,400 /12 = 70,700. Correct.

Martin's average investment:

Jan 1 to July 31: 7 months at 63,000.

Aug 1 to Dec 31: 5 months at 61,200.

So (7*63,000 +5*61,200)/12.

7*63,000=441,000; 5*61,200=306,000.

Total 747,000. 747,000 /12 = 62,250. Correct.

So interest calculations are correct.

Thus, the total profit is split as:

Kirk: 4,242 + 9,701 = 13,943

Martin:3,735 +19,402= 23,137.

Looking at the options, option J matches these values.
</think>

To determine Kirk and Martin's shares of the profits, we first calculate their average investments during the year, as interest at 6% is allowed on these amounts. The total profit for the year is $37,080, and after deducting the total interest, the remaining profit is split according to their agreement: Kirk receives one-third, and Martin receives two-thirds.

### Step 1: Calculate Average Investments
- **Kirk's Average Investment**:
  - Jan 1 to June 30: $72,000 for 6 months.
  - July 1 to Oct 31: $69,000 for 4 months (after withdrawing $3,000).
  - Nov 1 to Dec 31: $70,200 for 2 months (after adding $1,200).
  - Total: \((6 \times 72,000) + (4 \times 69,000) + (2 \times 70,200) = 848,400\).
  - Average: \(848,400 / 12 = 70,700\).

- **Martin's Average Investment**:
  - Jan 1 to July 31: $63,000 for 7 months.
  - Aug 1 to Dec 31: $61,200 for 5 months (after withdrawing $1,800).
  - Total: \((7 \times 63,000) + (5 \times 61,200) = 747,000\).
  - Average: \(747,000 / 12 = 62,250\).

### Step 2: Calculate Interest on Average Investments
- **Kirk's Interest**: \(70,700 \times 6\% = 4,242\).
- **Martin's Interest**: \(62,250 \times 6\% = 3,735\).
- **Total Interest**: \(4,242 + 3,735 = 7,977\).

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Profit After Interest
- **Total Profit**: $37,080.
- **Remaining Profit**: \(37,080 - 7,977 = 29,103\).

### Step 4: Split the Remaining Profit
- **Kirk's Share**: \(29,103 \times \frac{1}{3} = 9,701\).
- **Martin's Share**: \(29,103 \times \frac{2}{3} = 19,402\).

### Step 5: Calculate Total Shares (Interest + Profit Share)
- **Kirk's Total Share**: \(4,242 + 9,701 = 13,943\).
- **Martin's Total Share**: \(3,735 + 19,402 = 23,137\).

### Final Answer
Kirk's share of the total profits is **$13,943**, and Martin's share is **$23,137**.

**Correct Option: J**
