Okay, so I've got this integral to compute over a surface, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The integral is ∬_Σ (x³ dy dz + y³ dz dx + z³ dx dy), where Σ is the outward ellipsoid defined by x² + y² + (z²)/4 = 1. Hmm, wait, I should double-check the equation. Oh right, it's x² + y² + z²/4 =1. So it's an ellipsoid stretched along the z-axis.

First, I remember that integrals of this form can sometimes be evaluated using the divergence theorem, which relates a surface integral to a volume integral. The divergence theorem says that ∬_Σ F·dS = ∭_V (div F) dV, where F is a vector field and V is the volume enclosed by Σ. But wait, the integral given here isn't directly a dot product; it's in terms of differentials dy dz, etc. Let me think.

Oh wait, the given integral is a surface integral of a second-type, also known as a flux integral. The general form for such an integral is ∬ F·n dS, where n is the unit normal vector. Alternatively, when using the parametrization in terms of coordinates, it's expressed as x³ dy dz + y³ dz dx + z³ dx dy. So each term corresponds to a component of the flux through the surface.

But computing this directly for an ellipsoid might be complicated. Maybe using the divergence theorem would be easier. Let me recall how that works. The divergence theorem converts the flux integral into a volume integral of the divergence of the vector field.

So first, I need to identify the vector field F from the given integral. The integral is x³ dy dz + y³ dz dx + z³ dx dy. I think this corresponds to F = (x³, y³, z³), because in the surface integral, each component of F is dotted with the respective face of the surface element.

Wait, let me clarify. The terms are x³ dy dz, which would correspond to the x-component of F multiplied by dy dz, which is the area element for the y-z plane. Similarly, y³ dz dx is the y-component multiplied by dz dx (x-z plane), and z³ dx dy is the z-component times dx dy (x-y plane). So yes, the vector field F is (x³, y³, z³).

Now, the divergence of F, div F, is the sum of the partial derivatives of each component with respect to their respective variables. So:

div F = d(x³)/dx + d(y³)/dy + d(z³)/dz
= 3x² + 3y² + 3z²
= 3(x² + y² + z²)

Wait, but our ellipsoid is x² + y² + (z²)/4 =1. So the equation can be rewritten as x² + y² + z² = 4(1 - x² - y²). Wait no, that's not right. Let me express z² in terms of x² and y². From the ellipsoid equation:

x² + y² + (z²)/4 =1 → z² = 4(1 - x² - y²).

So, any point (x,y,z) on the ellipsoid satisfies this. But inside the volume V enclosed by Σ, the points satisfy x² + y² + z²/4 ≤1.

Wait, but for the divergence, we have x² + y² + z². Hmm, perhaps I should express the divergence in terms of the ellipsoid's equation. Let me see.

Wait, the divergence is 3(x² + y² + z²). But from the ellipsoid equation, x² + y² + z²/4 =1, so z² =4(1 -x² -y²). If I substitute that into the divergence, I get 3(x² + y² +4(1 -x² -y²)) = 3(x² + y² +4 -4x² -4y²) = 3(-3x² -3y² +4) = 3*(-3(x² + y²) +4).

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the volume integral of 3(x² + y² + z²) over the ellipsoid.

So using the divergence theorem, the integral becomes:

∭_V 3(x² + y² + z²) dV

Now, to compute this triple integral, I can switch to a coordinate system that matches the ellipsoid. Since the ellipsoid is symmetric, maybe using spherical coordinates would be helpful, but scaled appropriately.

In spherical coordinates, we have:

x = r sinθ cosφ
y = r sinθ sinφ
z = r cosθ

But wait, the ellipsoid isn't a sphere. So maybe I can stretch the coordinates to turn the ellipsoid into a sphere. Let's define a transformation to "sphereify" the ellipsoid.

Let me consider a substitution where I scale the z-coordinate by a factor of 2, because in the ellipsoid equation, z² is divided by 4, so scaling z as 2z' would make it (2z')² /4 = z'^2. Similarly, x and y can remain the same. So let me define:

x' = x
y' = y
z' = z/2

Then the ellipsoid equation becomes:

x'^2 + y'^2 + (2 z')^2 /4 = x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2 =1

So in terms of the new coordinates (x', y', z'), the region V becomes the unit sphere x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2 ≤1.

Now, the volume element dV in the original coordinates is dx dy dz. How does this transform under the substitution?

The Jacobian determinant for the substitution is the determinant of the matrix of partial derivatives. The substitution is linear, scaling z by 1/2. So the Jacobian matrix is diagonal with entries 1,1,2. So the determinant is 1*1*2=2. Therefore, dV = dx dy dz = 2 dx' dy' dz'.

Wait, no: if z' = z/2, then dz = 2 dz'. So when changing variables, the volume element becomes dx' dy' dz' * |J|, where |J| is the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant. Since the Jacobian here is 2 (as dz is scaled by 2), the volume element becomes 2 dx' dy' dz'.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The substitution is:

x = x'
y = y'
z = 2 z'

So the transformation matrix is diagonal with 1,1,2. So the Jacobian determinant is 1*1*2=2. Therefore, dV = dx dy dz = |J| dx' dy' dz' = 2 dx' dy' dz'.

So the triple integral becomes:

3 ∭_{V'} (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) dV = 3 ∭_{V'} (x'^2 + y'^2 + (2 z')^2) * 2 dx' dy' dz'

Wait, because in terms of the new variables, x = x', y = y', z=2 z', so substituting into x² + y² + z² gives (x')² + (y')² + (2 z')² = x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2.

So the integral becomes:

3 * 2 ∭_{V'} (x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) dx' dy' dz'

But V' is the unit sphere in (x', y', z') space, so the integral is over the unit sphere.

Hmm, but integrating (x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) over the unit sphere. Let's compute this integral.

Since the region is symmetric, we can exploit spherical symmetry. Let me switch to spherical coordinates for (x', y', z').

In spherical coordinates, x' = r sinθ cosφ, y' = r sinθ sinφ, z' = r cosθ. The volume element is r² sinθ dr dθ dφ, and the limits are r from 0 to 1, θ from 0 to π, φ from 0 to 2π.

So substituting into the integral:

3 * 2 ∫ (from r=0 to1) ∫ (θ=0 to π) ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) [ (r² sin²θ cos²φ) + (r² sin²θ sin²φ) +4 (r² cos²θ) ] * r² sinθ dφ dθ dr

Wait, let me clarify. The integrand is (x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) = r² sin²θ cos²φ + r² sin²θ sin²φ +4 r² cos²θ.

Let me factor out r²:

= r² [ sin²θ (cos²φ + sin²φ) +4 cos²θ ]

Since cos²φ + sin²φ =1, this simplifies to:

r² [ sin²θ +4 cos²θ ]

So the integral becomes:

3 * 2 ∫₀^1 r² [ ∫₀^π ∫₀^{2π} (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) sinθ dφ dθ ] dr

Wait, no. Because the integrand is (x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) which is r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ), as we just found. So the integral is:

3 * 2 ∫₀^1 ∫₀^π ∫₀^{2π} r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) * r² sinθ dφ dθ dr

Because the volume element is r² sinθ dr dθ dφ, and the integrand from (x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) is r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ).

Wait, no, wait: The integrand is (x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) which is r² (sin²θ [cos²φ + sin²φ] +4 cos²θ) = r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ). So the entire integrand is r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) times the volume element, which is r² sinθ dr dθ dφ.

So the integral becomes:

3 * 2 ∫₀^1 r² dr ∫₀^π (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) sinθ dθ ∫₀^{2π} dφ

We can compute each integral separately.

First, compute the φ integral:

∫₀^{2π} dφ = 2π.

Next, the θ integral:

I_θ = ∫₀^π (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) sinθ dθ.

Let me compute this. Let's split it into two terms:

I_θ = ∫ sin^3θ dθ +4 ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ.

Compute each part.

First integral: ∫ sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π.

We can write sin^3θ = sinθ (1 - cos²θ).

So ∫ sin^3θ dθ = ∫ sinθ (1 - cos²θ) dθ.

Let u = cosθ, then du = -sinθ dθ. So when θ=0, u=1; θ=π, u=-1.

So the integral becomes:

∫ from u=1 to u=-1 of (1 - u²)(-du) = ∫ from -1 to1 (1 - u²) du

= [u - (u^3)/3] from -1 to 1

At 1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3

At -1: (-1) - (-1/3) = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3

So subtracting: 2/3 - (-2/3) = 4/3.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. The substitution:

∫_0^π sin^3θ dθ = ∫_{u=1}^{u=-1} (1 - u²)(-du) = ∫_{-1}^1 (1 - u²) du

Which is [u - u^3/3] from -1 to 1.

At 1: 1 - (1)/3 = 2/3.

At -1: (-1) - (-1)^3/3 = -1 - (-1/3) = -1 +1/3 = -2/3.

So the integral is (2/3) - (-2/3) = 4/3.

Second integral: 4 ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ.

Let u = cosθ, so du = -sinθ dθ. Limits when θ=0 → u=1; θ=π → u=-1.

So the integral becomes 4 ∫_{u=1}^{u=-1} u² (-du) = 4 ∫_{-1}^1 u² du.

Which is 4 [ (u^3)/3 ] from -1 to1.

At 1: 1/3.

At -1: (-1)^3/3 = -1/3.

So the integral is 4*(1/3 - (-1/3)) = 4*(2/3) = 8/3.

So putting it together, I_θ = 4/3 +8/3 = 12/3 =4.

Now, the r integral is:

∫₀^1 r^2 dr * [from above] → Wait, no. Wait, the integrand in r is r^2 times the other terms. Wait, let me reorganize.

The entire integral is 3 * 2 * ( ∫₀^1 r^2 * r^2 dr ) * I_θ * ∫ dφ.

Wait, no, let me re-express the entire integral correctly. Let me go back.

The integral is:

3 * 2 ∫₀^1 [r^2 * r^2] dr ∫₀^π [ (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) sinθ ] dθ ∫₀^{2π} dφ

Wait, no, the volume element is r^2 sinθ dr dθ dφ, and the integrand is r^2 (sin²θ +4 cos²θ), so when you multiply, you get r^2 * r^2 sinθ dr dθ dφ = r^4 sinθ dr dθ dφ.

Wait, yes. Because:

Volume element: r^2 sinθ dr dθ dφ

Integrand: r^2 (sin²θ +4 cos²θ)

So overall: r^4 sinθ (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) dr dθ dφ.

Wait, no. Wait, the integrand from the divergence is 3(x² + y² + z²) which in the transformed coordinates is 3*(x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2) =3*(r^2 sin²θ + r^2 sin²θ [because x'^2 + y'^2 = r^2 sin²θ (cos²φ + sin²φ) = r^2 sin²θ] plus 4 z'^2, wait no. Wait, maybe I got confused earlier.

Wait, no. Earlier, I think I made a mistake in substitution. Let me go back.

The divergence is 3(x² + y² + z²). But under the coordinate transformation, x =x', y=y', z=2 z'. So x² + y² + z² = x'^2 + y'^2 + (2 z')^2 = x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2.

So the integrand is 3(x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) and the volume element is dx dy dz = 2 dx' dy' dz'.

So the integral becomes 3 * 2 ∫∫∫ (x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) dx' dy' dz' over the unit sphere.

Which in spherical coordinates is 6 ∫ (r=0 to1) ∫ (θ=0 to π) ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) (r² sin²θ + r² sin²θ +4 r² cos²θ) r² sinθ dr dθ dφ.

Wait, no. Wait, x'^2 + y'^2 = r² sin²θ (cos²φ + sin²φ) = r² sin²θ. So x'^2 + y'^2 = r² sin²θ, and z'^2 = r² cos²θ. So the integrand (x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) is r² sin²θ + 4 r² cos²θ = r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ).

So the integral becomes:

6 ∫ (r=0 to1) r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) * r² sinθ dr dθ dφ.

Because the volume element is r² sinθ dr dθ dφ, and we have to multiply by the integrand r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ), giving r^4 sinθ (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) dr dθ dφ.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because the integrand is (x'^2 + y'^2 +4 z'^2) = r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ), and the volume element is r² sinθ dr dθ dφ. So the entire integrand becomes r² (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) * r² sinθ = r^4 sinθ (sin²θ +4 cos²θ).

Wait, that's correct.

So the integral is 6 ∫₀^1 r^4 dr ∫₀^π (sinθ (sin²θ +4 cos²θ)) dθ ∫₀^{2π} dφ.

So let's compute each part.

First, the φ integral: ∫₀^{2π} dφ =2π.

Second, the θ integral: ∫₀^π sinθ (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) dθ.

Let me compute this.

Expand the integrand:

sinθ (sin²θ +4 cos²θ) = sin^3θ +4 sinθ cos²θ.

So the integral becomes I_θ = ∫ (sin^3θ +4 sinθ cos²θ) dθ from 0
