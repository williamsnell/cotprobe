Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about diluting battery acid and neutralizing it with a base. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my normality and dilution calculations, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: 10 cc of battery acid (density 1.21) is diluted to 100 cc. Then, 30 cc of this dilute solution is neutralized by 45 cc of 0.5 N base. I need to find three things: the normality of the diluted acid, its strength in grams per liter, and the strength of the undiluted acid in g/l.

First, I think I should tackle the normality of the diluted acid. Let's see. Neutralization reactions involve acid and base. The key equation here is probably the one relating normality, volume, and the reaction equivalence.

So, when an acid reacts with a base, the product of their normalities and volumes should be equal, right? Like N1V1 = N2V2. But wait, that's for when they're of the same valence. Oh wait, but since it's a neutralization, assuming they're monobasic and monoacidic, maybe that's okay.

Wait, the base is 0.5 N. So, the diluted acid's normality (let's call it N) times 30 cc should equal 0.5 N times 45 cc. Let me write that down:

N * 30 = 0.5 * 45

So N = (0.5 *45)/30 = (22.5)/30 = 0.75 N? Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because 0.5 N is the base's normality. So that's correct. So the diluted acid has a normality of 0.75 N. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A has 0.75 N, but let's not get ahead of ourselves yet. Because the problem also involves dilution, maybe I missed a step.

Wait, no, because the 30 cc is from the diluted solution. So the N here is the normality after dilution. So that part is correct. So the diluted acid is 0.75 N.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the initial 10 cc is battery acid, which is then diluted to 100 cc. So the diluted solution is 100 cc, and when 30 cc of that is taken, it's neutralized by 45 cc of 0.5 N base. So using N1V1 = N2V2 applies here, yes. So N1 is the normality of the diluted acid, which I just calculated as 0.75 N. So that's the first part.

Now, the second part is the strength in grams per liter for the diluted acid. Hmm. Wait, so the diluted acid is 0.75 N. But what's the equivalent weight of the acid? Since normality (N) is equal to molarity (M) multiplied by the number of equivalents per mole (which for H+ in a monoprotic acid is 1, so N = M for H2SO4 if it's diprotic, but wait, what's the acid here? The problem says "battery acid," which is typically sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Oh right, because car batteries use sulfuric acid.

Wait, that's important. So, sulfuric acid is diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate 2 H+ ions. So for H2SO4, the normality is 2 times the molarity. So, if the diluted solution is 0.75 N, then its molarity is 0.75 / 2 = 0.375 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if N = n × M, where n is the number of equivalents per mole. For H2SO4, n is 2 because it's diprotic, so 2 H+ per molecule. So N = 2M → M = N/2. So for N=0.75, M is 0.375 mol/L.

Now, to find the strength in grams per liter, I need to find the molarity and multiply by the molar mass. The molar mass of H2SO4 is... let's see. H is 1, S is 32, O is 16. So 2(1) + 32 + 4(16) = 2 +32 +64=98 g/mol.

So grams per liter would be Molarity × Molar Mass = 0.375 mol/L ×98 g/mol = 36.75 g/L. Wait, that's 36.75, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. Wait, the diluted acid is 0.75 N. So, for H2SO4, the molarity is 0.75 / 2 = 0.375 M. Then, 0.375 ×98 = 36.75 g/L, which is 36.75 g/L, which isn't matching any of the options. Hmm. So maybe I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I got the acid wrong. Maybe the battery acid is HCl? No, no, battery acid is definitely sulfuric acid. So back to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the normality calculation was wrong. Let me double-check. The neutralization: 30 cc of diluted acid (N) reacts with 45 cc of 0.5 N base. So N ×30 =0.5 ×45. So N= (22.5)/30=0.75 N. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the base is NaOH, which is monobasic. So each mole gives one OH-. So the equivalent for the base is correct. So the acid's normality is 0.75 N. So that part is correct.

Wait, then why the grams per liter is 36.75, which isn't in any of the options. Hmm, the options for the first part (normality) don't have 0.75 except option A. But let's see, option A's second part is 121 g/L, which is way higher than 36.75. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the molarity. Wait, no, wait, maybe the acid is H2SO4, and in the diluted solution, the normality is 0.75 N, so molarity is 0.375, but maybe the question is asking for the strength before dilution, and I've mixed up the steps.

Wait no, the first part is asking for the normality of the diluted acid, which is 0.75 N, and the second part is its strength in grams per liter, so that's 36.75, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the dilution first. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, the 10 cc of battery acid is diluted to 100 cc. So the initial volume is 10, final 100. So the dilution factor is 10. So the initial concentration would be higher.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the concentration of the diluted solution. Wait, perhaps I should use dilution equations. So N1V1 = N2V2, but wait, N1 is the initial normality, N2 is the diluted normality.

Wait, but I don't know N1 yet. Because the problem gives me the data to find N2 (the diluted solution's normality) via the neutralization. So I think the first approach was correct.

Wait, but maybe the initial approach was wrong. Maybe I should first find the normality of the diluted solution using the neutralization data, then find the normality of the original solution, then compute the grams per liter for both diluted and original.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me structure this step by step.

Step 1: Find the normality of the diluted acid.

We have 30 cc of diluted acid reacting with 45 cc of 0.5 N base.

Using the neutralization equation: N_acid * V_acid = N_base * V_base.

So, N_acid * 30 = 0.5 *45 → N_acid = (22.5)/30 = 0.75 N.

So the diluted acid is 0.75 N.

Step 2: Find the strength of the diluted acid in grams per liter.

As before, H2SO4 has a normality of 0.75 N, which is 0.75 equivalents per liter. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole provides 2 equivalents. So the molarity is 0.75 / 2 = 0.375 M.

Molar mass of H2SO4 is 98.079 g/mol, approximately 98 g/mol.

So, grams per liter = 0.375 mol/L × 98 g/mol = 36.75 g/L.

But looking at the options, none of them have 36.75 g/L. The options' second values are all around 115-125. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the acid isn't H2SO4. Wait, wait, the problem says "battery acid," which is definitely sulfuric acid. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing normality with molarity in the wrong way. Let me think again.

Wait, the normality is 0.75 N. For H2SO4, each mole is 2 equivalents, so normality = 2 × molarity. So molarity = normality / 2 = 0.75 / 2 = 0.375 M. So that's correct.

So 0.375 M ×98 g/mol =36.75 g/L. So that's correct. But none of the options have that. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says 0.75 N, 121 g/l, etc. So maybe I'm calculating the wrong thing.

Wait, perhaps the strength is in terms of H+ concentration. No, strength in grams per liter would just be the concentration in g/L.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the diluted solution's normality is 0.75 N, and then I need to find the grams per liter for that solution. So that's 0.75 N, which is 0.75 equivalents per liter.

But for H2SO4, each mole gives 2 equivalents. So the molarity is 0.75/2 = 0.375 M, and 0.375 ×98 =36.75 g/L. That's correct.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should calculate the undiluted acid's strength first, then back-calculate.

Wait, no, the problem asks for the diluted acid's strength, then the undiluted's strength. So the diluted is 36.75 g/L, but the options have 121 g/L for option A, which is 36.75 ×3.333, which is 10 times higher than 36.75? Wait, no, 36.75 ×3.333 is about 122.5, but that's not relevant.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Perhaps the acid is monoprotic. But no, battery acid is H2SO4, which is diprotic.

Wait, maybe the base is diprotic? No, the base is 0.5 N, and if it's NaOH, it's monobasic. So the neutralization equation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the dilution first. The initial 10 cc is diluted to 100 cc, so the concentration is 1/10th of the original. So if the diluted solution is 0.75 N, the original would be 7.5 N. But that's for normality, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.

Wait, the problem asks for the strength of the undiluted acid, which is the original 10 cc. So after finding the diluted's normality, I can find the original's normality, then compute its grams per liter.

But wait, I'm stuck because according to my calculations, the diluted solution's strength is 36.75 g/L, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the volumes. Let me check again.

The 30 cc of diluted solution is neutralized by 45 cc of 0.5 N base.

So N_acid ×30 = 0.5 ×45 → N_acid = 22.5 /30 = 0.75 N.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the molarity differently. Let's think about the equivalent weight.

Wait, the equivalent weight is molar mass divided by valence. For H2SO4, since it's diprotic, the equivalent weight is 98 /2 =49 g/equivalent.

So, if the normality is 0.75 N, that means 0.75 equivalents per liter. So grams per liter would be 0.75 ×49 =36.75 g/L.

Same result. So that's correct, but not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the strength in terms of H2SO4, and perhaps I should have considered the diluted solution's density, but I don't think so because the density of the diluted solution isn't given. The density given is for the undiluted acid, which is 1.21 g/mL.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the undiluted acid's normality first.

Wait, the 10 cc of undiluted acid is diluted to 100 cc. So the dilution factor is 10 times. So the normality after dilution is N_diluted = N_undiluted /10.

Wait, but we found N_diluted to be 0.75 N. So N_undiluted = 0.75 ×10 =7.5 N.

Now, the undiluted acid has a density of 1.21 g/mL. So 1 mL is 1.21 grams, so 1 L is 1210 grams.

So, the undiluted acid's concentration in grams per liter is 1210 g/L.

Wait, that's one of the options, option A's third value is 1210 g/L. So that's correct for the undiluted acid.

Now, the strength of the undiluted acid in g/L is 1210 g/L, which matches option A.

But then the diluted acid's strength would be 1210 g/L divided by 10 (since it's diluted 10 times), giving 121 g/L. Which is option A's second value. But wait, earlier I calculated 36.75 g/L for the diluted solution, which is way lower than 121. So I'm really confused now.

Wait, this suggests that perhaps my initial approach was wrong. So perhaps I should approach this problem using the mass balance instead of normality.

Alternative approach:

The 10 cc of undiluted acid has a density of 1.21 g/mL, so mass is 10 mL ×1.21 g/mL =12.1 grams.

This is diluted to 100 mL, so the diluted solution's mass is still 12.1 grams, but now in 100 mL → 0.1 L. So the concentration in g/L is 12.1 g /0.1 L =121 g/L. So that's the diluted solution's concentration. Which matches option A's second value, 121 g/L.

Hmm, that's different from my earlier calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in using normality and molarity. But why is this different?

Wait, wait, because the initial approach using normality gave me 36.75 g/L for the diluted solution, but this mass approach gives me 121 g/L. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the normality calculation gives the concentration in terms of H+ equivalents, whereas the mass approach gives the actual mass of H2SO4 per liter, regardless of its dissociation.

Wait, that makes sense. So, when the problem asks for the strength in grams per liter, it refers to the mass concentration, not the equivalent concentration. So, the diluted solution's strength is 121 g/L, which comes from the mass of the undiluted acid divided by the diluted volume.

But then, what about the normality? Let's reconcile this.

The diluted solution is 121 g/L of H2SO4. The molar mass is 98 g/mol. So the molarity is 121 /98 ≈1.235 M. But wait, that can't be right because earlier I calculated the normality to be 0.75 N.

Wait, no, wait. If the diluted solution is 121 g/L, then molarity is 121 /98 ≈1.235 mol/L. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, normality is 2 × molarity → 2 ×1.235≈2.47 N. But that contradicts the earlier calculation where N was 0.75 N.

So, now I'm really confused. There's a discrepancy here. So perhaps I made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, perhaps the initial normality calculation was wrong because I didn't consider the correct dilution.

Wait, let's try to approach this using both dilution and neutralization.

Let me let the normality of the undiluted acid be N. When 10 cc of it is diluted to 100 cc, the normality becomes N/10. Because dilution formula: N1V1 = N2V2 → N2 = N1 × V1 / V2 = N ×10/100 = N/10.

So, the diluted solution's normality is N/10.

Now, 30 cc of this diluted solution (N/10) reacts with 45 cc of 0.5 N base.

So, N_acid × V_acid = N_base × V_base → (N/10) ×30 =0.5 ×45.

So, (N ×30)/10 =22.5 → 3N =22.5 → N=7.5 N.

So, the undiluted acid has a normality of7.5 N.

Now, the strength of the undiluted acid in grams per liter: since its density is1.21 g/mL → 1210 g/L.

So, the mass is 1210 g/L. Now, to find the molarity, we can compute:

Molarity = mass / molar mass =1210 g/L /98 g/mol ≈12.3469 M.

But since H2SO4 is diprotic, normality is 2 × molarity → 24.6938 N, which doesn't make sense because we had N as7.5 N earlier. So that's
