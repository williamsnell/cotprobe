The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The President appointed a delegation to enter into negotiations with representatives of a foreign government to study the problem of preventing the extinction of certain species of rabbits. The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. Assume that after the treaty goes into effect, a state legislature enacts a statute that provides that "any licensed rabbit-hunter in the state and its surrounding environs may increase his monthly catch of rabbits from 10 to 15 in each of the specified months of the authorized rabbit-hunting season from the first day of October until the last day of February. " If challenged, the enactment of the aforementioned statute would most likely be declared

Options:

A: constitutional, because the enactment falls within the Tenth Amendment's reservedpowers.
B: unconstitutional, because all treaties are the supreme law of the land.
C: unconstitutional, because it conflicts with federal law.
D: constitutional, because the treaty does not specifically prohibit the increase in hunting.
E: constitutional, because the treaty only applies to the federal government.
F: constitutional, because the regulation of hunting is within the area of state action.
G: constitutional, because the state has the right to regulate its own natural resources.
H: unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause.
I: unconstitutional, because it interferes with international relations.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically focusing on the relationship between state statutes and federal treaties. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

The question begins by talking about the President appointing a delegation to negotiate with a foreign government about preventing the extinction of certain rabbit species. Their goal was to study the problem and draft regulations for a bilateral agreement, which would protect these endangered rabbits and set up a permanent commission to monitor enforcement. So, the President and the foreign leader then entered into a treaty forming this commission with enforcement powers.

Now, after the treaty is in effect, a state legislature passes a statute that allows licensed rabbit hunters to increase their monthly catch from 10 to 15 during specific hunting months. The question is whether this state statute would be declared constitutional or not if challenged.

I remember from my studies that the U.S. Constitution has the Supremacy Clause, which says that federal law is the supreme law of the land. Treaties, along with federal statutes and the Constitution, are part of federal law. So, under Article VI, Clause 2, any state law that conflicts with a federal law is invalid.

In this scenario, the treaty created a commission to monitor enforcement of regulations aimed at protecting the rabbits. I think the state statute here is allowing more hunting, which would probably conflict with the treaty's purpose. Because the treaty is federal law, if the state law contradicts it, the state law should be unconstitutional.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's constitutional under the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to the states. But the Tenth Amendment doesn't apply here because the treaty is a federal power, and states can't override federal law in areas where the federal government has authority, like foreign treaties.

Option B states it's unconstitutional because all treaties are supreme law. That's partially correct, but the reasoning might need to be more specific. It's not just that treaties are supreme, but that this particular state law conflicts with the treaty.

Option C says unconstitutional because it conflicts with federal law. That makes sense because the treaty is federal law, and the state statute is conflicting.

Option D suggests it's constitutional because the treaty doesn't specifically prohibit the increase. But the treaty likely has regulations that the state law is undermining, so specific prohibition might not be necessary for a conflict.

Option E claims the treaty only applies to the federal government. No, treaties can impose obligations on states if they relate to matters within federal authority.

Option F says it's constitutional because states regulate hunting. But if federal law (the treaty) occupies that field or directly conflicts, the state law must yield.

Option G argues states have the right to regulate natural resources. Again, the Supremacy Clause would override that if there's a conflict with federal law.

Options H and I bring up the commerce clause and international relations. The commerce clause might not be directly relevant here, and while international relations are involved, the main issue is the treaty's supremacy over state law.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be that the state statute is unconstitutional because it conflicts with federal law, which is the treaty. So the answer is C.
</think>

The correct answer is:

**C: unconstitutional, because it conflicts with federal law.**

The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution establishes that federal law, including treaties, is the supreme law of the land, preempting conflicting state laws. The state statute increasing the rabbit catch directly undermines the treaty's purpose of protecting endangered species, making it unconstitutional.

Answer: C
