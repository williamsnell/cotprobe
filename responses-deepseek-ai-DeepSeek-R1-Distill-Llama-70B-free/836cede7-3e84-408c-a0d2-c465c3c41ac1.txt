Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a hydraulic press and the oil inside it. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I remember that when a liquid is under pressure, its volume changes a bit. The question is about finding the decrease in volume when the pressure increases. 

The given data: The oil's volume is 0.25 m³, which is 250 liters. The pressure increase Δp is 1.6e7 Pascals. Oh wait, the bulk modulus B is 5.0e9 Pa. Oh wait, and the compressibility k is 1/B, so 20e-6 atm⁻¹. I think the unit for the answer is in 1e-4 m³, so like 10^-4 m³.

Wait, so the formula I need here is probably the one relating pressure change to volume change. I think it's something like ΔV = -V₀ * (Δp) / B, where V₀ is the original volume. Or was it using the compressibility k? Let me think. Compressibility is defined as k = - (1/V₀) * (ΔV/Δp). So rearranging that, ΔV = -k * V₀ * Δp.

Wait, but the problem gives both B and k. Since B is the bulk modulus, and B = 1/k. Wait no, because k is given as 1/B, so in this case, B is 5e9 Pa, so k would be 1/(5e9) Pa⁻¹. But wait, the problem says k is 20e-6 atm⁻¹. Hmm, maybe I should check the units to see which to use.

Wait, the pressure change is given in Pascals, 1.6e7 Pa. If I use B in Pascals, the units would be consistent. Alternatively, if I use k, I need to make sure the pressure is in atm.

Let me think about the formula again. The formula for the change in volume when pressure is applied is ΔV = -V₀ * (Δp) / B. Because B is defined as V₀ Δp / (-ΔV), so rearranged, ΔV = -V₀ Δp / B.

So using that formula, I can plug in the numbers. Let me do that.

V₀ is 0.25 m³. Δp is 1.6e7 Pa. B is 5e9 Pa.

So ΔV = - (0.25 m³) * (1.6e7 Pa) / (5e9 Pa).

Let me compute that. The pressures in Pa will cancel out. So 1.6e7 divided by 5e9 is 1.6/(5*1e2) )= 1.6/(500) = 0.0032. So 0.25 * 0.0032 = 0.0008 m³. So ΔV would be -0.0008 m³, which is -8e-4 m³.

Wait, but the question asks for the answer in units of 1e-4 m³. So -8e-4 m³ is -0.8 * 1e-4 m³. So the answer would be -0.8 units, which I think is option F.

Wait, let me double-check with the other approach using k. k is given as 20e-6 atm⁻¹. So if I use k, I need to convert Δp into atm.

So Δp is 1.6e7 Pa. I remember that 1 atm is about 1.01325e5 Pa. Let me compute how many atm that is.

1.6e7 Pa / 1.01325e5 Pa/atm = approximately 1.6e7 / 1e5 = 160 atm. Oh wait, the question says it's about 160 atm, so that's correct.

So then, using k = 20e-6 atm⁻¹.

ΔV = -k V₀ Δp. So ΔV = - (20e-6 atm⁻¹) * 0.25 m³ * 160 atm.

Compute that: 20e-6 * 160 = 3.2e-3. Multiply by 0.25: 0.8e-3. So ΔV is -0.0008 m³, same as before. So yeah, that's -0.8e-4 (since 0.0008 is 8e-4, which is 0.8 * 1e-4 m³). So again, option F: -0.8.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

Wait, 1.6e7 Pa divided by 1.013e5 Pa/atm is 1.6e7 / 1e5 = 160, yeah that's right. So 160 atm.

So using k = 20e-6 atm⁻¹:

20e-6 * 160 = (20 * 160) * 1e-6 = 3200e-6 = 0.0032.

Multiply by V₀=0.25:

0.25 * 0.0032 = 0.0008 m³ decrease. So ΔV is -0.0008 m³, which is -8e-4 m³. The question asks for the answer in units of 1e-4 m³, so that's -0.8 times 1e-4. So the answer is -0.8 which is option F.

So yeah, the correct answer should be F.

To determine the decrease in the volume of the oil when subjected to a pressure increase, we use the relationship:

\[
\Delta V = -\frac{V_0 \cdot \Delta p}{B}
\]

where:
- \( V_0 = 0.25 \, \text{m}^3 \) (initial volume of the oil),
- \( \Delta p = 1.6 \times 10^7 \, \text{Pa} \) (pressure increase),
- \( B = 5.0 \times 10^9 \, \text{Pa} \) (bulk modulus of the oil).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta V = -\frac{0.25 \cdot 1.6 \times 10^7}{5.0 \times 10^9}
\]

First, calculate the ratio of pressures:

\[
\frac{1.6 \times 10^7}{5.0 \times 10^9} = \frac{1.6}{500} = 0.0032
\]

Now multiply by \( V_0 \):

\[
\Delta V = -0.25 \cdot 0.0032 = -0.0008 \, \text{m}^3
\]

The decrease in volume is \( -0.0008 \, \text{m}^3 \), which is equivalent to \( -0.8 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3 \) in the specified units.

To confirm, we can also use the compressibility \( k = 20 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{atm}^{-1} \). First, convert \( \Delta p \) to atm:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.6 \times 10^7}{1.01325 \times 10^5} \approx 160 \, \text{atm}
\]

Then, calculate \( \Delta V \) using \( \Delta V = -k \cdot V_0 \cdot \Delta p \):

\[
\Delta V = -(20 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 0.25 \cdot 160
\]

\[
\Delta V = -0.0008 \, \text{m}^3
\]

This matches the previous result. The decrease in volume is \( -0.8 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3 \), corresponding to option **F**.
