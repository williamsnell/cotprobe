Okay, so I've got this question about the yield curve, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about yield curves.

From what I remember, the yield curve shows the relationship between the interest rate (or cost of borrowing) and the time to maturity of the debt for a given borrower in a given credit quality. Typically, it's observed in the market for government bonds of different maturities.

There are three main types of yield curves: upward sloping, downward sloping, and flat. Sometimes, people also talk about a humped or inverted curve, but I think those are variations.

An upward sloping curve means that as the time to maturity increases, the interest rate also increases. So, long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term ones. This is the most common scenario and usually reflects expectations of future inflation or economic growth. People expect that in the future, they might need higher returns, so they demand more for longer-term investments.

A downward sloping curve is the opposite. Here, longer-term bonds have lower yields than short-term ones. This is less common and can signal that the market expects interest rates to fall in the future. It might happen if the economy is expected to slow down or if there's an expectation of lower inflation.

A flat yield curve occurs when the yields are approximately the same across all maturities. This can happen when the market expects short-term interest rates to remain stable or when there's uncertainty about future economic conditions.

Now, looking at the question: a five-year bond has a yield of 6%, and a ten-year bond has a yield of 5%. So, the shorter-term bond (5-year) has a higher yield than the longer-term (10-year) bond. That suggests that as the maturity increases, the yield decreases. So the curve is sloping downward.

Wait, let me make sure. Because if the 5-year is 6% and the 10-year is 5%, that means the longer-term bond yields less. So the line connecting these two points would slope downward from left to right. That's a downward sloping curve.

So the question is asking what the yield curve is likely to be in this scenario. The options are A to J.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: fluctuating
B: 6% at -10
C: upward sloping at 4%
D: 4% at −10
E: flat
F: 7% at -5
G: 3% at −5
H: downward sloping
I: upward sloping
J: 5% at -5

I need to match the scenario to the correct option. The key here is that the five-year bond has a higher yield than the ten-year, so the curve slopes downward.

Option H is "downward sloping", which matches this situation. Option I is upward sloping, which would be if the 10-year had a higher yield than the 5-year, like 6% and 7%, for example.

So the correct answer should be H.

The yield curve is downward sloping because the five-year bond has a higher yield (6%) than the ten-year bond (5%). This indicates that as the time to maturity increases, the yield decreases, which is characteristic of a downward sloping curve.

Answer: H
