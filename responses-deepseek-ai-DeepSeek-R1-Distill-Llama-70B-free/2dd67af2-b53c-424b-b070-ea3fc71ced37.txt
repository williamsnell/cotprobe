Question:

A bank was robbed by a person wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Three weeks after the robbery, a defendant was arrested and charged with the crime. At trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the proffered evidence should be

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it is hearsay evidence.
B: admissible as circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime as charged.
C: inadmissible, because it constitutes double jeopardy.
D: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the case.
E: admissible, to show the identity of the defendant.
F: admissible, to show the defendant's propensity for committing similar crimes.
G: admissible, to show the defendant's modus operandi.
H: admissible, to show the defendant's motive.
I: inadmissible, because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
J: inadmissible, because it constitutes improper character evidence.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of prior crimes in a trial. I'm a bit rusty on my evidence rules, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

The question is about a bank robbery where the robber wore specific clothing: a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Three weeks later, the defendant is arrested and charged. At trial, the prosecution wants to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery wearing the exact same outfit. The defense objects, and I need to determine if this evidence is admissible or not.

First, I remember that prior convictions or prior bad acts are generally not admissible to prove that a person is guilty of the current charge. This is because of the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404(b), which prohibits using prior crimes or bad acts to show that the person has a propensity to commit such crimes. So the prosecution can't just say, "Hey, he did it before, so he must have done it this time."

But wait, there are exceptions to this rule. Exceptions include using prior acts to show motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. So if the prior crimes can be connected under one of these exceptions, they might be admissible.

In this case, the key detail is the unique outfit. The robber in both cases wore the same distinctive clothing—yellow ski mask, goggles, and fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. That's a very specific and unusual combination. So the prosecution might argue that this shows a modus operandi (MO) or a specific method that the defendant uses, which could help in identifying him as the perpetrator.

I think modus operandi is a valid exception under Rule 404(b). If the prior crimes are so similar in methodology that it's like a signature, then it's admissible to show that the same person likely committed both crimes. So the evidence of the prior robbery with the same outfit would be relevant to show the defendant's modus operandi, thus linking him to the current crime.

Looking at the options:

Option G says it's admissible to show modus operandi. That fits with what I'm thinking. But wait, I should make sure that modus operandi is a recognized exception. From what I recall, modus operandi is indeed one of the exceptions listed under Rule 404(b)(2), so it should be admissible.

Other options: Option E is about identity, which could also apply because the unique outfit could help identify the defendant. But modus operandi is more specific here. Option B is about circumstantial evidence, which is a broader category. The evidence is circumstantial, but the key issue is whether it's admissible under 404(b).

Option J says it's inadmissible because it's improper character evidence. That would be the case if they were just trying to show propensity, but since it's about MO, it's an exception.

So the correct answer should be G. Admissible to show modus operandi.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence regarding a defendant's prior robbery, where the defendant wore the same distinctive outfit—a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit—as in the current case. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), prior crimes or bad acts are generally inadmissible to prove propensity but may be admitted under specific exceptions, such as modus operandi (MO).

The prosecution seeks to introduce this evidence to demonstrate that the defendant's use of the same distinctive outfit in both robberies suggests a consistent method of operation, which is admissible under Rule 404(b)(2). This evidence is relevant to show modus operandi, as the unique clothing constitutes a "signature" that links the defendant to both crimes. Other options, such as propensity or identity, are less precise or do not align with the specific exception applicable here.
