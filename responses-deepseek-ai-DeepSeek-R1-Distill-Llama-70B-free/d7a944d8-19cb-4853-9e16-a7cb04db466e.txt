Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. There are three different liquids, each at different temperatures: 15°C, 20°C, and 25°C. When equal masses of the first two are mixed, the final temp is 18°C. And when equal masses of the last two are mixed, it's 24°C. Now, I need to find the temp when equal masses of the first and last are mixed.

Hmm. I remember that when you mix two substances, the heat lost by the hotter one equals the heat gained by the cooler one, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings. The formula is usually something like m1*c1*(T1 - Tf) = m2*c2*(Tf - T2), but since the masses are equal, maybe some terms cancel out.

Wait, in this problem, the masses of the liquids being mixed are equal each time. So in the first mix, equal masses of the first (15°C) and second (20°C) give 18°C. Similarly, equal masses of the second (20°C) and third (25°C) give 24°C. So maybe I can find the specific heat capacities of the second and third in terms of the first.

Let me denote the specific heat capacities as c1, c2, c3 for the three liquids. But since the masses are equal, when masses are same, the equation becomes:

For the first mix:
mass * c1 * (15 - 18) = mass * c2 * (18 - 20)
The masses cancel out, so:
c1 * (-3) = c2 * ( -2 )
Which simplifies to 3 c1 = 2 c2 → c2 = (3/2)c1.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The equation is:

mass1 * c1 * (T1 - Tf) = mass2 * c2 * (Tf - T2)
But mass1 equals mass2, so they cancel. So:

c1 (15 - 18) = c2 (18 - 20)
15-18 is -3, and 18-20 is -2. So:
c1*(-3) = c2*(-2)
Divide both sides by -1: 3 c1 = 2 c2 → c2 = (3/2) c1.

Yes, that's right.

Now for the second mix: equal masses of the second (20°C) and third (25°C) give 24°C. So:

c2*(20 -24) = c3*(24 -25)
Wait, no. Wait, the hotter liquid loses heat, so the second liquid here is 20, which is cooler than the third, which is 25. So when mixed, the third liquid cools down, and the second warms up.

Wait, wait. Let me set it up correctly. The second mix is between 20°C and 25°C, with equal masses. The final temp is 24°C.

So the heat lost by the third (25°C) equals the heat gained by the second (20°C).

So:

c3*(25 - 24) = c2*(24 - 20)
Because the third is hotter, it's losing heat (25-24), and the second is gaining (24-20).

So:

c3*(1) = c2*(4) → c3 = 4 c2.

But we already have c2 in terms of c1. Since c2 is (3/2)c1, substituting:

c3 = 4*(3/2 c1) = 6 c1.

So now we have c2 = 1.5 c1 and c3 = 6 c1.

Now, the problem asks what happens when we mix equal masses of the first (15°C) and third (25°C) liquid. Let's denote the final temperature as Tf.

So the heat lost by the third equals the heat gained by the first.

So:

m * c3 * (25 - Tf) = m * c1 * (Tf -15)
Again, masses are equal and cancel out, so:

c3 (25 - Tf) = c1 (Tf -15)

We know c3 is 6 c1, so substitute:

6 c1 (25 - Tf) = c1 (Tf -15)

The c1 cancels out:

6(25 - Tf) = (Tf -15)

Expand left side: 150 - 6 Tf = Tf -15

Bring all terms to one side:

150 +15 = Tf +6 Tf → 165 =7 Tf → Tf =165/7.

Let me calculate that. 7*23 is 161, 165-161=4 → 23 and 4/7, which is about 23.57°C.

Looking back at the options, option C is 23 (4/7), which matches.

So the answer should be C: 23 (4/7) °C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the heat transfer between the liquids when mixed. The key principle is that the heat lost by the hotter liquid equals the heat gained by the cooler one, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings. The equation for heat transfer is:

\[
m_1 c_1 (T_1 - T_f) = m_2 c_2 (T_2 - T_f)
\]

Since the masses of the liquids being mixed are equal, the masses cancel out, simplifying the equation. Let the specific heat capacities of the three liquids be \(c_1\), \(c_2\), and \(c_3\).

### Step 1: Mixing the first two liquids (15°C and 20°C)
The final temperature is 18°C. Using the heat transfer equation:

\[
c_1 (15 - 18) = c_2 (18 - 20)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
c_1 (-3) = c_2 (-2) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3c_1 = 2c_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c_2 = \frac{3}{2}c_1
\]

### Step 2: Mixing the last two liquids (20°C and 25°C)
The final temperature is 24°C. Using the heat transfer equation:

\[
c_2 (20 - 24) = c_3 (24 - 25)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
c_2 (-4) = c_3 (-1) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4c_2 = c_3
\]

Substituting \(c_2 = \frac{3}{2}c_1\):

\[
c_3 = 4 \cdot \frac{3}{2}c_1 = 6c_1
\]

### Step 3: Mixing the first and last liquids (15°C and 25°C)
Let the final temperature be \(T_f\). Using the heat transfer equation:

\[
c_3 (25 - T_f) = c_1 (T_f - 15)
\]

Substituting \(c_3 = 6c_1\):

\[
6c_1 (25 - T_f) = c_1 (T_f - 15)
\]

Canceling \(c_1\):

\[
6(25 - T_f) = T_f - 15
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
150 - 6T_f = T_f - 15 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 165 = 7T_f \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_f = \frac{165}{7} = 23 \frac{4}{7} \, °\text{C}
\]

### Final Answer:
The temperature achieved by mixing equal masses of the first and last liquid is **23 (4/7) °C**.
