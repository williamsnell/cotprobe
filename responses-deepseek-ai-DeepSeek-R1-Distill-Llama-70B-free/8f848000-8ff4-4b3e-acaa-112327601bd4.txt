Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about fluid dynamics, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let me try to think it through. The question says that a liquid is flowing through a pipe with varying diameters, and it's moving at a constant flow rate. At one point, the diameter is 2 cm and the speed is 18 m/s. I need to find the speed at another point where the diameter is 3 cm.

Hmm, I remember something about the equation of continuity from my high school physics. Oh right, it's about the flow rate remaining constant when the pipe's diameter changes. The equation is A1*v1 = A2*v2, where A is the cross-sectional area and v is the flow speed.

Wait, but the area of a circle is πr², right? So the area is proportional to the square of the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the area would be proportional to diameter squared as well. Oh yeah, because radius is diameter divided by two, so when you square it, the 2s cancel out in the proportionality.

So for two different points in the pipe, the product of the area and velocity remains the same. That is, A1 * v1 = A2 * v2. Since area is π*(d/2)^2, but since we're dealing with ratios, the π and the 1/4 cancel out when we take A1/A2. So A1 = π*(d1/2)^2, A2 = π*(d2/2)^2. So when we take the ratio A1/A2, it's (d1²)/(d2²). 

So the equation becomes d1² * v1 = d2² * v2. Because when I rearrange A1 v1 = A2 v2, and substitute A as (π d²/4), it becomes (d1² v1) = (d2² v2). So solving for v2 would give v2 = (d1² / d2²) * v1.

Let me plug in the numbers. d1 is 2 cm, d2 is 3 cm. But wait, units! Speed is in meters per second, but diameters are in centimeters. Oh, but since we're taking the ratio, the units will cancel out. So 2 cm is 0.02 meters, but since it's squared, it's (0.02)^2. But wait, maybe I should just keep it in cm because the units will cancel. Let me think.

Alternatively, since the ratio of diameters is 2/3, the area ratio is (2/3)^2, which is 4/9. So the speed should be higher where the area is smaller because the same flow rate means if area decreases, speed increases. But wait, in this case, the area at d=2 cm is smaller than at d=3 cm. So when the pipe widens (larger diameter), the speed should decrease. Because if the area is bigger, the liquid can flow slower.

So in this problem, the first point has a smaller diameter (2 cm) and higher speed (18 m/s). The second point has a larger diameter (3 cm), so the speed should be lower.

So using the formula: v2 = v1 * (d1/d2)^2. Wait no, wait, because A1 v1 = A2 v2 → v2 = v1 * (A1/A2) = v1 * (d1²/d2²).

Wait, wait, because A is proportional to d², so when d increases, A increases. So if A1 is smaller than A2, then v2 must be smaller than v1.

So plugging in the numbers: d1 is 2 cm, d2 is 3 cm.

v2 = 18 m/s * (2/3)^2.

Calculating (2/3)^2 is 4/9. So 18 * (4/9) = ?

Let me compute that. 18 divided by 9 is 2, multiplied by 4 is 8. So 8 m/s?

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 8 m/s. But wait, I thought when the diameter increases, the speed decreases, which is consistent here since 8 is less than 18.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the cross-sectional area goes from π*(2)^2 to π*(3)^2, so from 4π to 9π. The area increases by a factor of (9/4). So the speed must decrease by the same factor since A*v is constant. So v2 = v1 * (4/9) = 18 * 4/9 = 8 m/s.

So the correct answer should be D: 8 m/s.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose the pipe narrows, like if the diameter decreased, then the speed would increase. If it widens, speed decreases. So yes, in this case, the diameter is increasing from 2 to 3 cm, so the speed should drop. Thus, 8 makes sense.

So looking at the options, D is 8 m/s. So I think that's the correct choice.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of continuity in fluid dynamics, which states that the flow rate remains constant throughout the pipe. The equation of continuity is:

\[
A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2
\]

where \(A\) is the cross-sectional area and \(v\) is the flow speed. The cross-sectional area of a pipe with circular cross-section is proportional to the square of its diameter (\(A \propto d^2\)). Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:

\[
d_1^2 v_1 = d_2^2 v_2
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(v_2\), we get:

\[
v_2 = v_1 \cdot \frac{d_1^2}{d_2^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(d_1 = 2 \, \text{cm}\),
- \(d_2 = 3 \, \text{cm}\),
- \(v_1 = 18 \, \text{m/s}\),

we calculate:

\[
v_2 = 18 \cdot \frac{2^2}{3^2} = 18 \cdot \frac{4}{9} = 8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Since the diameter increases from 2 cm to 3 cm, the cross-sectional area increases, and the flow speed decreases accordingly. The calculated flow speed at the wider section of the pipe is \(8 \, \text{m/s}\).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: 8 m/s**
