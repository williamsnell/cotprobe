Okay, so I've got this IPv4 question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in an IPv4 datagram, the total-length field is (00 A0 10) in hexadecimal, and the header length (HLEN) is (5) 1 in hex. I need to find out how many bytes of payload are being carried. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember that in IPv4, the total length field represents the total number of bytes in the entire datagram, including both the header and the payload. So if I subtract the header length from the total length, that should give me the payload size, right?

Wait, but the total-length is given in hex. Oh right, I need to convert that to decimal to understand its actual value. Let me think about how to convert (00 A0 10) from hex to decimal.

Hex is base 16, so each digit represents four bits. The bytes are usually grouped into two hex digits. So 00 A0 10 is three bytes, which makes sense because the total length is a 16-bit field, but wait, no, wait. Wait, IPv4 total length is 16 bits, which can represent up to 65535 bytes. So the value here is 00 A0 10 in hex, but that's three bytes. Oh wait, maybe I need to consider it as a two-byte value. Because 16 bits is two bytes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The total-length field in the IPv4 header is 16 bits, so it's two bytes. So the value given is 00 A0 10? Wait, that's three bytes. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo, and it's actually 00 A0 10 as a three-byte value, but that's 24 bits, which would be more than 16. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is written as (00 A0 10) in hex, but that's three bytes, which is 24 bits. But the total length is a 16-bit field, so maybe the value is 0x00A0 << 8 | 0x10? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 16-bit value written as 00 A0, and the 10 is part of something else. Wait, maybe the question has a typo, and the total-length is 0x00A0, which is two bytes, and 10 is part of something else. Or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the way it's written is that the value is (00 A0 10) in hex, meaning three bytes. But that would be 24 bits, which is incorrect for IPv4. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Wait, maybe the value is 0xA00? Or perhaps the correct way is to split it as two bytes: 0x00A0 and 0x10? But that doesn't fit either because 0x00A0 is 16 bits, and 0x10 is 8 bits. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to treat the entire three-byte sequence as the total length. But that can't be right because IPv4's total length is 16 bits, so it's two bytes. So perhaps the correct value is 0x00A010, but that's three bytes, which would be 24 bits. Hmm, but the total length is 16 bits, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the way to read it is that the total-length field is 0x00A0 in hex, which is two bytes, and the 10 is part of the header length. No, the header length is given separately as 0x51, which is 5 in hex. Wait, 0x51 is 81 in decimal. No, that can't be right because the header length in IPv4 is 4-bit field, so possible values are from 0 to 15. Wait, 0x51 would be 81 in decimal, which is way too big. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says the HLEN is (5) 1 in hex. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo. Because HLEN is 4 bits, so it's a single hex digit. So maybe it's 5 times 4 bytes? Or wait, no. Wait, HLEN is the number of 32-bit words in the header. So for example, if HLEN is 5, that's 5*4=20 bytes.

But wait, the question says HLEN is (5) 1 in hex. Wait, that's confusing. Oh, perhaps it's written as 0x51, which is 81 in decimal. But that can't be, as HLEN is 4 bits, so it can only be 0 to 15. So 0x51 is 81, which is way beyond that. So that must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps HLEN is 5 in hexadecimal, which is 5 in decimal. Because 5 in hex is 5 in dec. So HLEN is 5, meaning 5*4=20 bytes for the header.

Wait, that makes sense. So the header length is 5, which is 20 bytes. Because each HLEN unit is 4 bytes. So HLEN is 5, so 5*4=20.

Now, the total length is given as (00 A0 10) in hex. Wait, but that's three bytes, which is 24 bits. But the total length field is 16 bits, so perhaps I'm miscounting. Maybe it's two bytes: 0x00A0 and 0x10? But that would be 0xA0 << 8 | 0x10, which is 0xA010. Let's compute that.

Wait, 0xA010 in hex is equal to 4096 + 16*256 + 16? Wait, no. Wait, 0xA010 is (A * 16^3) + (0 * 16^2) + (1 * 16^1) + 0. Wait, no, wait: in hex, each digit is 4 bits, so 0xA010 is a 16-bit value? Wait, 0xA010 is a 20-bit number, because 4 digits * 4 bits = 16 bits. Wait, no, 4 hex digits make 16 bits. Because each hex digit is 4 bits, so 4 digits = 16 bits.

So 0xA010 is 16 bits. Let me compute that in decimal. 0xA is 10, 0 is 0, 1 is 1, 0 is 0. So breaking it down:

The first digit (A) is the highest place, which is 10 * 16^3 = 10 * 4096 = 40960.

The second digit (0) is 0 * 16^2 = 0.

Third digit (1) is 1 * 16^1 = 16.

Fourth digit (0) is 0 * 16^0 = 0.

So adding them up: 40960 + 0 + 16 + 0 = 40976 bytes. But wait, that can't be right because the maximum total length in IPv4 is 65535 bytes, so 40976 is possible.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because 0xA010 is 40976 in decimal, but I thought the total length is the sum of header and payload. The header is 20 bytes, so the payload would be 40976 - 20 = 40956 bytes. But that's not one of the options provided. The options are like 120, 140, etc. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait a second, maybe the total-length is 0x00A0, which is two bytes, not three. Because 0x00A0 is 16 bits. Let me compute that. 0x00A0 is equal to (0x00 << 8) | 0xA0. So 0x00 is 0, 0xA0 is 160. So 0x00A0 is 160 in decimal. So total length is 160 bytes.

Then, the header length is HLEN=5 in hex, which is 5 in decimal, so 5 *4 = 20 bytes.

So payload size would be total length minus header length: 160 - 20 = 140 bytes.

Looking at the options, option F is 140. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but earlier I thought the total-length was three bytes, but that led to a number not in the options. So perhaps I was misinterpreting the first value. The question says (00 A0 10) in hex, but I think maybe that's a typo, and it's actually 00 A0, which is two bytes, making 0x00A0=160.

Alternatively, perhaps the value is 0x00A0, and the 10 is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question meant the total-length is 0xA010, but that's 40976, which is way higher than the options given.

But wait, the options are all under 300. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat the total-length as 0xA0 in hex, which is 160, and the header length as 5 (so 20 bytes), giving 140 bytes of payload.

So the answer would be F:140.

To determine the number of bytes of payload in the IPv4 datagram, we analyze the given values:

1. **Total-Length Field**: The total-length field is given as `(00 A0 10)_{16}`. However, the total-length field in IPv4 is a 16-bit field, meaning it represents two bytes. Therefore, the relevant value is `(00 A0)_{16}`, which is equivalent to `0x00A0` in hexadecimal. Converting this to decimal:
   \[
   0x00A0 = (0 \times 16^3) + (0 \times 16^2) + (10 \times 16^1) + (0 \times 16^0) = 160 \, \text{bytes}.
   \]

2. **Header Length (HLEN)**: The header length is given as `(5)_{16}`, which is 5 in decimal. In IPv4, the header length is specified in 32-bit words, so the actual header size in bytes is:
   \[
   5 \, \text{words} \times 4 \, \text{bytes/word} = 20 \, \text{bytes}.
   \]

3. **Payload Size**: The payload size is calculated by subtracting the header length from the total length:
   \[
   \text{Payload Size} = \text{Total-Length} - \text{Header Length} = 160 - 20 = 140 \, \text{bytes}.
   \]

Thus, the datagram carries **140 bytes of payload**.
