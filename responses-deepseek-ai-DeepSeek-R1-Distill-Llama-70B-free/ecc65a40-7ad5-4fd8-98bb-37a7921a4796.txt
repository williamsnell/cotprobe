Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem says that a shower of protons deposits equal charges +q on Earth and the Moon. Then, the electrostatic repulsion exactly counterbalances the gravitational attraction between them. I need to find how large q is, choosing from the given options.

Hmm. So, the scenario is that the gravitational force between Earth and Moon is balanced by the electrostatic force. Wait, but in reality, the Moon and Earth are attracted by gravity, and if they have charges, depending on the sign, the electrostatic force could either attract or repel. But here, the charges are both +q, so same sign, so they repel each other. So the electrostatic force is repulsion, balancing the gravitational attraction.

So the setup is that the gravitational force (which is an attractive force) is exactly balanced by the electrostatic repulsive force. That means the two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so they cancel each other out.

I think the first step is to write down the expressions for both forces.

Gravitational force between two masses is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation: F_grav = G * (M_e * M_m) / R², where G is the gravitational constant, M_e is Earth's mass, M_m is Moon's mass, and R is the distance between their centers.

Electrostatic force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law: F_elec = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q) / r². Since both charges are +q, the force is repulsive. Here, r is the distance between the charges, which in this case is the same R as in the gravitational case.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the charges are deposited on Earth and Moon. So the charges are on each body. So each has charge +q, so the Coulomb force is between the two charges, which are separated by R. So yes, r is R.

So setting F_grav equal to F_elec because they balance each other.

So:

G * (M_e * M_m) / R² = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q²) / R²

Wait, because both forces are using the same separation distance R. So R² appears in both denominators.

Looking at the equation, R² cancels out on both sides. So that's helpful.

So simplifying:

G M_e M_m = (1/(4πε₀)) q²

We can solve for q.

Multiply both sides by 4πε₀:

4πε₀ G M_e M_m = q²

Take square roots of both sides:

q = sqrt(4πε₀ G M_e M_m )

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see this exact expression. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: R^2
B: GM_eM_i
C: 2GM_eM_i
D: q^2 / R^2
E: (GM_eM_i)^2
F: q / (4πε₀R^2)
G: (G^2M_eM_i) / R
H: qR^2
I: (GM_eM_i)/R
J: sqrt(GM_eM_i)

Wait, my variable names: I used M_m for Moon's mass, but the options have M_i, which perhaps is a typo, or maybe it's M_moon. Let's proceed with the variables as given.

So my expression is q = sqrt(4πε₀ G M_e M_m )

But none of the options seem to match that. Wait, maybe the options are written differently.

Looking at option J: sqrt(GM_eM_i). Hmm, but that's without the 4πε₀ factor. So that's different. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the expression for Coulomb's law in a different form. Oh wait! Coulomb's law can also be written as F = k * (q^2)/R², where k is 1/(4πε₀), approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

So substituting that in:

G (M_e M_m) / R² = k (q²) / R²

Again, R² cancels, so:

G M_e M_m = k q²

So solving for q gives q² = (G M_e M_m) / k

Then q = sqrt( (G M_e M_m) / k )

But since k = 1/(4πε₀), this becomes q = sqrt(4πε₀ G M_e M_m )

Hmm. Still, the options don't have this expression. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a simplification. The option J is sqrt(G M_e M_i), which is close but lacks the 4πε₀ factor.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again. Let's see the options given:

A: R² → No, units don't match.

B: GM_eM_i → That would be without the square root and 4πε₀.

C: 2 GM_e M_i → No.

D: q^2/R² → No, that's part of Coulomb's law.

E: (GM_eM_i)^2 → No, squared.

F: q/(4πε₀ R²) → No, that's electric field perhaps.

G: (G² M_e M_i)/R → Hmm, but the units would be different.

H: q R² → No.

I: (G M_e M_i)/R → No, but that's force maybe.

J: sqrt(G M_e M_i) → Close, but lacking the 4πε₀ factor.

Wait, but maybe the variables are different. Did I misread the problem? The problem says q is on Earth and Moon. So maybe M_i is the mass of the Moon, which I considered as M_m. So the expression I got is sqrt(4 π ε₀ G M_e M_m). So in terms of the options, it's not present. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the gravitational force and the electrostatic force again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the charges on the Earth and Moon as point charges, so the forces act along the line connecting their centers, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the product of the charges as q^2. So in the Coulomb's law, F = (1/(4πε₀)) * q^2 / R².

Set F_grav equal to F_elec:

G M_e M_m / R² = (1/(4πε₀)) q² / R²

Cancel R²:

G M_e M_m = q² / (4 πε₀)

So,

q² = 4 π ε₀ G M_e M_m

Then,

q = sqrt(4 π ε₀ G M_e M_m )

But looking for this expression in the options, I don't see it. So perhaps I need to think about it differently.

Wait, let me consider the units. Let's see what each option's unit would be. The charge q has units of Coulombs (C).

Let me compute the units of each part.

G has units of N m²/kg², which is m³/(kg s²).

M_e and M_m are in kg.

So G M_e M_m has units (m³/(kg s²)) * kg * kg = m³ kg / s².

What about 4 π ε₀? ε₀ has units of C² s²/(N m²) → C² s²/(kg m/s² * m²) )= C² s²/(kg m³) → C² s²/(kg m³).

So 4 π ε₀ has same units as ε₀.

So 4 π ε₀ G M_e M_m has units:

(C² s²/(kg m³)) * (m³ kg / s²)) = C².

So sqrt(4 π ε₀ G M_e M_m) would have units of C, which is correct for charge.

So, the expression I derived is correct, but it's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again, option J is sqrt(G M_e M_i). But in my expression, it's sqrt(4 π ε₀ G M_e M_m ). So unless 4 π ε₀ is being considered as part of G, which it's not, perhaps the options are using a different form.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using Gaussian units or another unit system where 4 π ε₀ is absorbed into the equations. Wait, in Gaussian units, Coulomb's law is F = (q1 q2) / r², without the 4 π ε₀ factor. So if the problem is using that approach, then the equation would be:

G M_e M_m = q²

So q = sqrt(G M_e M_m )

Which would match option J.

Ah, that's probably it. The problem might be assuming Gaussian units where Coulomb's law is written without the 4 π ε₀ term, so F = q² / R² in appropriate units.

So in that case, the correct expression for q would be sqrt(G M_e M_m ). So option J.

Wait, but the options have M_i, perhaps M_i is the Moon's mass. If so, then yes.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer would be J.

To solve the problem, we need to balance the gravitational force and the electrostatic force between the Earth and the Moon. The gravitational force is given by:

\[
F_{\text{grav}} = \frac{G M_e M_m}{R^2}
\]

where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M_e\) is the Earth's mass, \(M_m\) is the Moon's mass, and \(R\) is the distance between their centers.

The electrostatic force between two charges \(+q\) is given by Coulomb's law:

\[
F_{\text{elec}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q^2}{R^2}
\]

Since the forces balance each other, we set \(F_{\text{grav}} = F_{\text{elec}}\):

\[
\frac{G M_e M_m}{R^2} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q^2}{R^2}
\]

The \(R^2\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
G M_e M_m = \frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}
\]

Rearranging for \(q^2\):

\[
q^2 = 4 \pi \epsilon_0 G M_e M_m
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
q = \sqrt{4 \pi \epsilon_0 G M_e M_m}
\]

However, the problem appears to assume Gaussian units, where Coulomb's law is written without the \(4 \pi \epsilon_0\) factor. In this case, the expression simplifies to:

\[
q = \sqrt{G M_e M_m}
\]

This matches option \(J\), assuming \(M_i\) in the options corresponds to the Moon's mass (\(M_m\)).

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: \(R^2\)**: Incorrect, as \(R^2\) does not have the correct units for charge.
- **B: \(GM_eM_i\)**: Incorrect, as this does not include the square root or the \(4 \pi \epsilon_0\) factor.
- **C: \(2GM_eM_i\)**: Incorrect, as it introduces an extra factor of 2.
- **D: \(q^2 / R^2\)**: Incorrect, as this represents part of Coulomb's law, not the charge \(q\).
- **E: \((GM_eM_i)^2\)**: Incorrect, as this squares the product, which is not consistent with the derived expression.
- **F: \(q / (4 \pi \epsilon_0 R^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this represents the electric field, not the charge.
- **G: \((G^2 M_e M_i) / R\)**: Incorrect, as it introduces an extra factor of \(G\) and divides by \(R\).
- **H: \(qR^2\)**: Incorrect, as this does not match the derived expression.
- **I: \((GM_eM_i) / R\)**: Incorrect, as it introduces a division by \(R\).
- **J: \(\sqrt{GM_eM_i}\)**: Correct, assuming Gaussian units where \(4 \pi \epsilon_0\) is absorbed.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J**
