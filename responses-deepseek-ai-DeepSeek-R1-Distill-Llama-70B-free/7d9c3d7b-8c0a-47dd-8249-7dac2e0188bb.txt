Okay, so I have this problem about an axial-flow fan in a wind tunnel, and I need to figure out what motor speed and power are required to increase the air velocity. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that currently, the fan produces an air velocity of 65 fps (feet per second) at the test section. It's driven by a 3-hp motor running at 1200 rpm. Now, they want to increase the velocity to 100 fps. I need to find the new motor speed and power required.

I remember that for fans, there's a relationship between the pressure, flow rate, speed, and power. Oh right, the fan laws! I think there are a set of rules called the fan laws that relate these variables. Let me try to recall them.

Fan Law 1: Volume flow rate (CFM) is directly proportional to the rotational speed (rpm). So CFM1/Cfm2 = rpm1/rpm2.

Fan Law 2: Pressure (like the static pressure or the head) is proportional to the square of the speed ratio. So Pressure1/Pressure2 = (rpm1/rpm2)^2.

Fan Law 3: Power (hp) is proportional to the cube of the speed ratio. Power1/Power2 = (rpm1/rpm2)^3.

Wait, but in this problem, I don't have the pressure, but I have the velocity. Hmm, velocity relates to the volume flow rate, right? Because volume flow rate is area times velocity. Assuming the area doesn't change, then velocity is directly proportional to CFM. So maybe I can use that.

So if the velocity is increasing from 65 fps to 100 fps, that's a ratio of 100/65. Let me calculate that: 100 divided by 65 is approximately 1.5385. So the velocity is increasing by a factor of about 1.5385.

Since velocity is proportional to CFM (assuming the area is constant), this means the CFM is also increasing by the same factor. And from Fan Law 1, CFM is proportional to rpm. So the new rpm would be 1200 * (100/65) = 1200 * 1.5385.

Let me compute that. 1200 * 1.5 is 1800, 1200 * 0.0385 is about 46.2, so total is 1846.2 rpm. So the new speed should be approximately 1846 rpm. Looking at the options, option D is 1846 rpm and 10.9 hp. Option F is 1800. So that's close, but 1846 is exact.

Now for the power. Fan Law 3 says power is proportional to the cube of the speed ratio. So the power ratio is (100/65)^3.

Let me compute that. (100/65)=1.5385. 1.5385^3 is approximately equal to... Let me calculate step by step. 1.5^3 is 3.375. But since it's 1.5385, let me be more precise.

First, 1.5385 squared is about (1.5)^2 = 2.25, but more accurately: 1.5385 * 1.5385. Let's compute that.

1.5385 * 1.5385: 1.5 *1.5 is 2.25. The extra 0.0385 on both terms. So (1.5 + 0.0385)^2 = 1.5² + 2*(1.5)(0.0385) + (0.0385)^2.

Which is 2.25 + 0.1155 + 0.00148. So approximately 2.25 + 0.117 = 2.367.

Now, multiply that by 1.5385 again for the cube: 2.367 * 1.5385.

Let me compute that. 2 * 1.5385 is 3.077. 0.367 *1.5385: 0.3 *1.5 is 0.45, 0.067*1.5 is 0.1005, so adding up, 0.45+0.1005=0.5505. Then, 0.007 *1.5385 is about 0.01076. So 0.367 *1.5385 is approximately 0.5505 + 0.01076 = 0.56126. So total is 3.077 + 0.56126 = 3.638.

So the power ratio is approximately 3.638. The original power is 3 hp, so new power is 3 * 3.638 ≈ 10.914 hp. So approximately 10.9 hp.

Looking back at the options, option D says 1846 rpm and 10.9 hp, which matches my calculations.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes fan laws can depend on whether it's the same fan or similar. Oh wait, the problem says it's the same fan, right? So the fan is the same, just the speed is changing. So the same impeller, same dimensions, so the fan laws should apply directly.

I think that's correct. So option D is the right answer.

To determine the new motor speed and power required to increase the air velocity from 65 fps to 100 fps, we use the fan laws. The fan laws state:

1. **Volume flow rate (CFM)** is directly proportional to the rotational speed (rpm):  
   \[
   \frac{\text{CFM}_1}{\text{CFM}_2} = \frac{\text{rpm}_1}{\text{rpm}_2}
   \]

2. **Pressure** is proportional to the square of the speed ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{\text{Pressure}_1}{\text{Pressure}_2} = \left(\frac{\text{rpm}_1}{\text{rpm}_2}\right)^2
   \]

3. **Power** is proportional to the cube of the speed ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{\text{Power}_1}{\text{Power}_2} = \left(\frac{\text{rpm}_1}{\text{rpm}_2}\right)^3
   \]

### Step 1: Calculate the speed ratio
The velocity increases from 65 fps to 100 fps, so the speed ratio is:  
\[
\text{Speed Ratio} = \frac{100}{65} \approx 1.5385
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the new motor speed
Using Fan Law 1, the new motor speed is:  
\[
\text{New Speed} = 1200 \times 1.5385 \approx 1846 \, \text{rpm}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the new power
Using Fan Law 3, the power ratio is:  
\[
\text{Power Ratio} = \left(1.5385\right)^3 \approx 3.638
\]

The original power is 3 hp, so the new power is:  
\[
\text{New Power} = 3 \times 3.638 \approx 10.914 \, \text{hp}
\]

### Step 4: Match the results to the options
The closest match is **Option D: 1846 rpm and 10.9 hp**.
