Question:

A purchasing agent for a women's clothing store negotiated a contract with dressmaking company to purchase a specified quantity of khaki garments at a price of $75,000. One week later, the purchasing agent received a telephone call from the vice president of the dressmaking company, who informed her that the dressmaking company's sales representative had made an error in calculating the contract price. As a result, the vice president said that unless the women's clothing store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments would not be delivered. If the purchasing agent should have known that the dressmaking company's original price term of $75,000 was in error, but agreed to the contract anyway, which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the purchasing agent acted in good faith.
B: There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.
C: There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.
D: There was no valid contract formed, because the price was not agreed upon by both parties.
E: There was a valid contract formed, because the dressmaking company was responsible for their own error.
F: The contract is invalid, because the purchasing agent took advantage of the dressmaking company's error.
G: There was an enforceable contract at the revised price term, because the error was corrected before delivery.
H: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.
I: There was a voidable contract, because the dressmaking company made an error.
J: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a purchasing agent for a women's clothing store who negotiated a contract with a dressmaking company. The agreed price was $75,000 for a certain quantity of khaki garments. But a week later, the dressmaking company's vice president calls and says there was a mistake in the price calculation. They're asking for an additional $15,000, otherwise they won't deliver. 

The question states that the purchasing agent should have known that the original price was in error but agreed to the contract anyway. So, the key points here are mistake in the contract and whether the contract is enforceable.

I remember that contract law deals with situations where a mistake affects the validity of the agreement. There's a difference between unilateral and mutual mistakes. A unilateral mistake is when one party makes a mistake, while both parties are mistaken in a mutual mistake.

In this case, the dressmaking company made a mistake in calculating the price. The purchasing agent, on the other hand, should have known about the error but went ahead and agreed to the contract. So, this seems like a unilateral mistake because only the dressmaking company was mistaken about the price.

Now, the question is about the enforceability of the contract. If a party makes a mistake regarding a fundamental aspect of the contract, like the price, but the other party either knows or should know about the mistake, the contract might not be enforceable. 

I think about the rule that if a mistake is so obvious that a reasonable person would recognize it, the contract can be avoided. So, if the purchasing agent should have known about the error, then the contract might be voidable. 

Wait, but what's the difference between voidable and unenforceable? Voidable means that the contract is valid unless one party chooses to avoid it. So, in this scenario, since the purchasing agent should have known, perhaps the contract is voidable at the option of the dressmaking company. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, another thought: if the mistake was about a basic term like price, and the other party knew or should have known, then there's no meeting of the minds (mutuality of assent). Without mutual assent, there's no valid contract. So, maybe the contract isn't formed at all because of the lack of mutual agreement on the price.

Wait, but the purchasing agent agreed to the contract despite knowing the error. So, perhaps she tried to take advantage of the situation. If the company made a mistake and the other party knew but accepted the offer, is the contract enforceable?

I remember something about a party not being allowed to snap up an offer that they know is based on a mistake. So, if the purchasing agent realized the price was too low and the company made a mistake, then by agreeing, she might be taking unfair advantage. In such cases, the contract could be unenforceable because it's unfair.

So, the dressmaking company might be able to rescind the contract because the purchasing agent should have known about the error. That would make the contract voidable. But wait, the options include B, which says it's voidable because the purchasing agent should have known. So that might be the case.

Alternatively, some might argue that since the purchasing agent agreed knowing the error, there's no mutual assent. If she knew the price was wrong and the company didn't, then maybe there was no real agreement. So, no contract was formed because of the mistake. That would align with option C, which says there's no contract because no mutuality of assent.

But wait, the purchasing agent did agree to the $75,000. So, the company offered, and she accepted. So, there was an acceptance, but perhaps it's based on a mistake. So, is the contract voidable or not formed at all?

I think the key here is whether the mistake was so material that it affects the basis of the agreement. If the purchasing agent should have known, then the contract is voidable. So, the dressmaking company can choose to avoid the contract because of the mistake, making it voidable.

Looking at the options, option B says it's voidable because the purchasing agent should have known of the error. Option C says no contract due to no mutuality.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused. So, in contract law, mutual assent is necessary. If one party makes a mistake that the other party knows about, does that negate mutual assent? Or does it just make the contract voidable?

Wait, another angle: in cases of unilateral mistake, if the non-mistaken party knows or has reason to know of the mistake, the contract can be avoided. So, the contract is voidable, not void. So, option B would be correct.

Alternatively, if the mistake is so fundamental that there's no meeting of the minds, then there's no contract. But the purchasing agent did agree to the terms, so perhaps there was a contract, just that it's voidable.

So, the options:

A: Enforceable because good faith. But the agent acted in bad faith if she knew about the mistake.

B: Voidable because agent should have known. This seems plausible.

C: No contract because no mutuality. Maybe, but I think it's more about the contract being voidable.

D: No contract because price not agreed. But the agent did agree, so D might not be right.

E: Valid because company is responsible. But the agent's knowledge affects this.

F: Invalid because agent took advantage. That's similar to B.

Wait, option F says the contract is invalid because the agent took advantage. So, is the contract void or voidable? I think when a party takes advantage, the contract is voidable, not automatically invalid.

So, the correct reasoning is that the contract is voidable because the purchasing agent should have known about the error. So, the answer would be B.

Alternatively, another thought: if the contract was based on a mutual mistake, it's different. But here, it's a unilateral mistake. So, if the non-mistaken party knew of the mistake, the contract is voidable. So, yes, B.

The question revolves around contract law, specifically addressing the enforceability of a contract where one party (the dressmaking company) made a unilateral mistake in calculating the price, and the other party (the purchasing agent) should have known about the error but agreed to the contract anyway. The key issue is whether the contract is enforceable, voidable, or invalid due to the mistake.

Under contract law, a unilateral mistake occurs when one party makes an error, and the other party either knows or should know about it. In such cases, the contract may be voidable if the non-mistaken party takes advantage of the mistake. Here, the purchasing agent should have known that the original price of $75,000 was in error but agreed to the contract regardless. This suggests that the purchasing agent took advantage of the dressmaking company's mistake, making the contract voidable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The contract is not enforceable simply because the purchasing agent acted in good faith. The agent should have known about the error, which undermines the validity of the contract.
- **Option B**: Correct. The contract is voidable because the purchasing agent should have known about the error, and the dressmaking company can choose to avoid the contract due to the unilateral mistake.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While there was a mistake, the purchasing agent did agree to the contract, so there was some form of mutual assent, even if it was based on an error.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The price was agreed upon, but the issue lies in the mistake and the purchasing agent's knowledge of it, not in the absence of agreement on the price.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The dressmaking company is not solely responsible for the error, as the purchasing agent should have known about it and acted in good faith.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The contract is not automatically invalid; it is voidable, giving the dressmaking company the option to avoid it.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The contract is not enforceable at the revised price term because the original contract was based on a mistake.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The contract is not enforceable at the original price term because the purchasing agent should have known about the mistake.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While the dressmaking company made a mistake, the key factor is that the purchasing agent should have known about it, making the contract voidable, not merely because of the mistake itself.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The nature of the mistake (error in computation) does not make the contract enforceable if the purchasing agent should have known about it.

The most accurate statement is that the contract is voidable because the purchasing agent should have known about the error.
