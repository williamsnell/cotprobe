Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the smallest prime number whose digits add up to 19. The options are A through J, each with a different number. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I need to check each option to see if it's prime and if the sum of its digits is 19.

Wait, but the question is about the smallest such prime. So maybe I should start by looking for the smallest numbers among the options and work my way up. But wait, the options might not be in order, so I need to check each one.

Let me list out the options and their digit sums:

Option A: 1991 → digits are 1,9,9,1. Sum is 1+9+9+1 = 20. Oh, that's more than 19. So it's not this one.

Option B: 199 → digits 1,9,9. Sum is 1+9+9=19. Oh, this fits the sum. But I need to check if it's prime. I think 199 is a prime number. Let me think: 199 is not even, doesn't end with 5. Let's see, square root of 199 is around 14. So I'll check divisibility up to 13. Divided by 3: 1+9+9=19, 19 mod 3 is 1, so not divisible by 3. Divided by 7: 199/7 is about 28.42, not an integer. 11: 199 ÷11 is around 18.09, no. 13: 199 ÷13 is around 15.3, no. So yes, 199 is prime. But wait, is there a smaller prime in the options that also sums to 19?

Option C: 289 → digits 2,8,9. Sum is 2+8+9=19. Hmm, so this also fits. But is 289 a prime? Wait, 289 is 17 squared, because 17x17=289. So it's not prime. So C is out.

Option D: 17 → digits 1 and 7. Sum is 8. So no, doesn't meet the sum.

Option E: 109 → digits 1,0,9. Sum is 1+0+9=10. Not 19. So E is out.

Option F: 29 → digits 2 and 9. Sum is 11. Not 19. So F is out.

Option G: 991 → digits 9,9,1. Sum is 9+9+1=19. So this fits the sum. Is 991 prime? Let me check. It's not even. Doesn't end with 5. Let's see the square root of 991 is about 31.5, so I'll check primes up to 31.

Divide by 3: 9+9+1=19 → 19 mod 3 is 1, so not divisible by 3.

Divide by 5: Doesn't end with 0 or 5, so no.

7: 991 ÷7 is around 141.57, not integer.

11: 991 ÷11 is 90.09, nope.

13: 991 ÷13 is about 76.23, no.

17: 17x58=986, 986+17=1003, so no. 17x58 is 986, so 991-986=5, not divisible.

19: 19x52=988, 988+19=1007, so 991-988=3, not divisible.

23: 23x43=989, 989+23=1012, so 991-989=2, not divisible.

29: 29x34=986, 986+29=1015, 991-986=5, not divisible.

31: 31x31=961, 31x32=992, which is just above 991. So 991 isn't divisible by 31 either. So 991 is prime.

Now, comparing the options that fit: B is 199, G is 991. 199 is smaller than 991, so 199 is a candidate. But wait, are there any other options with a sum of 19 and a smaller number than 199?

Let me check the other options.

Option H: 11 → digits 1 and 1. Sum is 2. No.

Option I: 919 → digits 9,1,9. Sum is 19. So this also meets the sum. Is 919 prime? Let's see. Square root is about 30.3, so check primes up to 29.

Divide by 2: No, it's odd.

3: 9+1+9=19 → 19 mod 3 is 1, so not divisible.

5: Doesn't end with 0 or5.

7: 919 ÷7 is around 131.28. Not integer.

11: 919 ÷11 is about 83.54. No.

13: 13x70=910, 910+13=923, which is above, so 919-910=9, not divisible.

17: 17x54=918, 918+17=935. So 919-918=1, not divisible.

19: 19x48=912, 912+19=931. 919-912=7, not divisible.

23: 23x39=897, 897+23=920. 919-897=22, which is 23x0.95, not divisible.

29: 29x31=899, 899+29=928. 919-899=20, not divisible.

So 919 is also a prime. Now, comparing B (199), G (991), and I (919). So 199 is the smallest among them.

Wait, but let me check all options again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Option J: 5 → sum is 5. Not 19.

So the candidates are B:199, I:919, G:991. Now, the smallest is 199, which is option B. Wait, but wait another moment: is 199 the smallest prime in the options? Let me check the other numbers. Are there any primes smaller than 199 in the options that have digits summing to 19?

Looking at the options again:

Option D is 17, but sum is 8. E is 109, sum 10. F is 29, sum 11. H is 11, sum 2. So no, the next possible is 199, which is 199, and indeed a prime.

Wait, but wait another thing: Are there any numbers smaller than 199 in the options that sum to 19? Because the question is about the smallest prime with digits summing to 19, and the options might include a smaller one.

Looking again: the options are A:1991, B:199, C:289, D:17, E:109, F:29, G:991, H:11, I:919, J:5.

So the numbers in the options, in order from smallest to largest:

H:11, J:5, D:17, F:29, E:109, B:199, C:289, I:919, G:991, A:1991.

Wait, I think I messed the order. Let me list them numerically:

5 (J), 11(H),17(D),29(F),109(E),199(B),289(C),919(I),991(G),1991(A).

So the numbers go from 5 up. Now, among these, we're looking for primes where digits sum to 19.

We've identified that B (199), I (919), and G (991) meet the sum. Now, 199 is the smallest among them, so it should be the answer.

Wait, but wait: 199 is the third number after 5, 11,17, etc., but none of those smaller numbers meet the sum. So yeah, the answer must be B:199.

Wait, but let me think again about 199. Is it the smallest possible prime with digit sum 19? Or is there a prime smaller than 199 with digit sum 19 that's not in the options? Because the question is not necessarily restricted to the options, but the options are the choices. Wait no, the question says "selecting from the answer A through to J." So the answer must be one of these options.

So in the options given, 199 is the smallest with sum 19 and is prime. So the answer is B.

To determine the smallest prime number whose digits sum to 19, we analyze the given options:

- **Option A: 1991**  
  Digits: 1, 9, 9, 1. Sum: \(1 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 20\).  
  The sum is greater than 19, so this option is invalid.

- **Option B: 199**  
  Digits: 1, 9, 9. Sum: \(1 + 9 + 9 = 19\).  
  199 is a prime number (not divisible by any prime number up to its square root, approximately 14). This option is valid.

- **Option C: 289**  
  Digits: 2, 8, 9. Sum: \(2 + 8 + 9 = 19\).  
  289 is not a prime number (it is \(17^2\)). This option is invalid.

- **Option D: 17**  
  Digits: 1, 7. Sum: \(1 + 7 = 8\).  
  The sum is not 19, so this option is invalid.

- **Option E: 109**  
  Digits: 1, 0, 9. Sum: \(1 + 0 + 9 = 10\).  
  The sum is not 19, so this option is invalid.

- **Option F: 29**  
  Digits: 2, 9. Sum: \(2 + 9 = 11\).  
  The sum is not 19, so this option is invalid.

- **Option G: 991**  
  Digits: 9, 9, 1. Sum: \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\).  
  991 is a prime number (not divisible by any prime number up to its square root, approximately 31.5). This option is valid.

- **Option H: 11**  
  Digits: 1, 1. Sum: \(1 + 1 = 2\).  
  The sum is not 19, so this option is invalid.

- **Option I: 919**  
  Digits: 9, 1, 9. Sum: \(9 + 1 + 9 = 19\).  
  919 is a prime number (not divisible by any prime number up to its square root, approximately 30.3). This option is valid.

- **Option J: 5**  
  Digits: 5. Sum: \(5\).  
  The sum is not 19, so this option is invalid.

From the valid options (B: 199, G: 991, I: 919), the smallest prime number is **199**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: 199**
