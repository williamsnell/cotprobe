Okay, so I have this calculus problem here, and I'm trying to find the length of the curve y = ln x between the points where y is 1/2 and y is 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

I remember that the formula for the arc length of a curve from x=a to x=b is the integral from a to b of sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx. Right, so I need to set up this integral for the given function.

First, let's find the derivative of y with respect to x. Since y = ln x, dy/dx is 1/x. So (dy/dx)^2 would be (1/x)^2, which is 1/x².

Now, the integrand becomes sqrt(1 + 1/x²). So the arc length L is the integral from x=a to x=b of sqrt(1 + 1/x²) dx.

Wait, but what are the limits of integration here? The problem gives me y values, so I need to find the corresponding x values. When y = 1/2, ln x = 1/2, which means x = e^(1/2), right? And when y=1, ln x=1, so x=e^1, which is e. So the limits are from x=e^(1/2) to x=e.

So the integral becomes the integral from e^(1/2) to e of sqrt(1 + 1/x²) dx.

Hmm, integrating sqrt(1 + 1/x²) dx. Let me see. Let me make a substitution to simplify this. Maybe a substitution where u is something that can handle the 1/x term.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that 1 + 1/x² is (x² + 1)/x². So sqrt of that would be sqrt(x² + 1)/x. So sqrt(1 + 1/x²) = sqrt(x² +1)/x.

So the integral becomes ∫ (sqrt(x² + 1)/x) dx from e^(1/2) to e.

Hmm, that might be a bit tricky. Maybe another substitution. Let me set u = x^2 + 1. Then du/dx = 2x, so dx = du/(2x). But I have an x in the denominator, so substituting might not directly help. Maybe another substitution.

Wait, perhaps a hyperbolic substitution? Like x = sinh θ, because 1 + sinh²θ = cosh²θ. Let me try that.

Let me set x = sinh θ. Then dx = cosh θ dθ. Then sqrt(x² + 1) would be sqrt(sinh²θ +1) = cosh θ. So the integrand becomes (cosh θ)/(sinh θ) ) * cosh θ dθ.

Wait, let me write that again. The integrand is sqrt(x² +1)/x dx. Substituting x = sinh θ, it becomes [cosh θ / sinh θ] * cosh θ dθ, which simplifies to (cosh² θ)/(sinh θ) dθ.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better substitution. Alternatively, perhaps using substitution t = x² +1, but I'm not sure.

Wait another thought. Let me try integrating sqrt(x² +1)/x dx. Let me make substitution u = sqrt(x² +1). Then, du/dx = x / sqrt(x² +1). Hmm, not directly helpful.

Wait, maybe I can split the integrand. Let me write sqrt(x² +1)/x as sqrt( (x² +1)/x² ) = sqrt(1 + 1/x²). Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe another substitution: Let me set t = x + sqrt(x² +1). But I don't know, that might complicate it further.

Wait, maybe integration by parts. Let me set u = sqrt(x² +1), dv = (1/x) dx. Then du would be (x / sqrt(x² +1)) dx, and v = ln x. Hmm, that gives me u v - ∫ v du. Let's see: sqrt(x² +1) * ln x - ∫ ln x * (x / sqrt(x² +1)) dx. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps let me try a substitution where I set u = 1/x. Then, du = -1/x² dx. Hmm, but I'm not seeing it immediately.

Wait, another approach. Let me change variables to t = x, so I'm not changing much. Alternatively, perhaps use substitution u = x^2 + 1. Then, du = 2x dx. Hmm, but I have a 1/x term, which complicates that.

Wait, perhaps I can write sqrt(x² +1)/x as (sqrt(x² +1))/x. Let me let u = sqrt(x² +1). Then, du = x dx / sqrt(x² +1). So x dx = sqrt(x² +1) du. Hmm, but I don't have an x dx term here, I have a 1/x term. Maybe not helpful.

Wait, maybe a substitution where t = 1/x. Then, dt = -1/x² dx. Let's try that. So, if t = 1/x, then x = 1/t, and dx = -1/t² dt. The integrand becomes sqrt( (1/t)^2 + 1 ) / (1/t) ) * (-1/t²) dt.

Wait, let's compute that. sqrt( (1/t^2) + 1 ) = sqrt( (1 + t^2)/t^2 ) = sqrt(1 + t^2)/|t|. Since t = 1/x and x is positive (because ln x is defined for x>0), so t is positive. So sqrt(1 + t^2)/t. Then the integrand becomes [sqrt(1 + t^2)/t ] * (1/(1/t)) ) * (-1/t²) dt. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me recast the substitution. The integrand is sqrt(x² +1)/x dx. Substituting x=1/t, dx= -1/t² dt. So:

sqrt( (1/t)^2 +1 ) / (1/t) ) * (-1/t²) dt.

Compute each part:

sqrt(1/t² +1) = sqrt( (1 + t^2)/t^2 ) = sqrt(1 + t^2)/|t|. Since t is positive, this is sqrt(1 + t^2)/t.

Divided by (1/t) is multiplying by t, so (sqrt(1 + t^2)/t) * t = sqrt(1 + t^2).

Then, multiplied by (-1/t²) dt, so overall:

sqrt(1 + t^2) * (-1/t^2) dt.

Wait, but the substitution changes the limits. When x = e^(1/2), t = 1/(e^(1/2)) = e^(-1/2). When x = e, t = 1/e.

So the integral becomes from t = e^(-1/2) to t=1/e of sqrt(1 + t^2) * (-1/t^2) dt. But since we have a negative sign, we can reverse the limits and remove the negative, making it the integral from t=1/e to t=e^(-1/2) of sqrt(1 + t^2)/t^2 dt.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe integrating sqrt(1 + t^2)/t^2 dt. Let me try integrating by parts. Let me set u = sqrt(1 + t^2), dv = (1/t²) dt. Then du = (t)/sqrt(1 + t^2) dt, and v = -1/t.

So integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du:

= (-sqrt(1 + t^2)/t ) - ∫ [ (-1/t) * (t / sqrt(1 + t^2)) ) ] dt.

Simplify each term:

First term: (-sqrt(1 + t^2)/t )

Second term: The integral becomes ∫ [ (1/t) * (t / sqrt(1 + t^2)) ) ] dt = ∫ 1/sqrt(1 + t^2) dt.

The integral of 1/sqrt(1 + t^2) dt is sinh^{-1}(t) or ln(t + sqrt(t^2 +1)).

So putting it together:

Integral = (-sqrt(1 + t^2)/t ) + ln(t + sqrt(t^2 +1)) ) + C.

Wait, but we have to evaluate this from t=1/e to t=e^{-1/2}.

So the definite integral is [ (-sqrt(1 + t^2)/t ) + ln(t + sqrt(t^2 +1)) ) ] evaluated from 1/e to e^{-1/2}.

Let me compute each part.

First, let me compute at t = e^{-1/2}:

Term1 = (-sqrt(1 + e^{-1}) ) / e^{-1/2}.

Simplify sqrt(1 + e^{-1}) = sqrt( (e +1)/e ) = sqrt(e +1)/sqrt(e).

So Term1 = - [ sqrt(e +1)/sqrt(e) ) ] / e^{-1/2} = - sqrt(e +1)/sqrt(e) * e^{1/2} = - sqrt(e +1) * e^{1/2} / e^{1/2} ) = - sqrt(e +1).

Term2: ln( e^{-1/2} + sqrt( e^{-1} + 1 ) )

sqrt( e^{-1} +1 ) = sqrt( (1 + e)/e ) = sqrt(1 + e)/sqrt(e).

So e^{-1/2} + sqrt(1 + e)/sqrt(e) = e^{-1/2} + sqrt(1 + e) e^{-1/2} = e^{-1/2} (1 + sqrt(1 + e)).

So Term2 is ln( e^{-1/2} (1 + sqrt(1 + e)) ) = ln(e^{-1/2}) + ln(1 + sqrt(1 + e)) ) = (-1/2) + ln(1 + sqrt(1 + e)).

So the total for t = e^{-1/2} is Term1 + Term2:

= (-sqrt(e +1)) + [ (-1/2) + ln(1 + sqrt(1 + e)) ) ]

Now, for t = 1/e:

Term1: (-sqrt(1 + (1/e)^2 )) / (1/e) = (-sqrt(1 + 1/e²)) * e.

sqrt(1 + 1/e²) is sqrt( (e² +1)/e² ) = sqrt(e² +1)/e. So Term1 becomes (-sqrt(e² +1)/e) * e = -sqrt(e^2 +1).

Term2: ln( (1/e) + sqrt( (1/e)^2 + 1 ) )

sqrt(1 + 1/e^2 ) = sqrt( (e² +1)/e^2 ) = sqrt(e² +1)/e. So:

(1/e) + sqrt(e² +1)/e = (1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)) / e.

So ln( (1 + sqrt(e^2 +1))/e ) = ln(1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)) - ln e = ln(1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)) - 1.

Putting it together for t=1/e: Term1 + Term2 is [ -sqrt(e² +1) ] + [ ln(1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)) -1 ].

So now, the definite integral is [value at upper limit] - [value at lower limit].

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the integral after substitution is from t=1/e to t=e^{-1/2}, so the integral is [F(t=e^{-1/2})] - [F(t=1/e)].

So let me compute F(e^{-1/2}) and F(1/e):

F(e^{-1/2}) = (-sqrt(e +1)) + (-1/2 + ln(1 + sqrt(1 + e)) )

F(1/e) = (-sqrt(e^2 +1)) + (ln(1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)) -1 )

So the integral is [ (-sqrt(e +1) -1/2 + ln(1 + sqrt(1 + e)) ) ] - [ (-sqrt(e^2 +1) + ln(1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)) -1 ) ].

Simplify this expression:

= (-sqrt(e +1) -1/2 + ln(1 + sqrt(1 + e)) ) + sqrt(e^2 +1) - ln(1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)) + 1.

Combine like terms:

= [sqrt(e^2 +1) - sqrt(e +1)] + [ (-1/2 +1) ] + [ ln(1 + sqrt(1 + e)) - ln(1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)) ) ]

Simplify each part:

sqrt(e^2 +1) is as is, sqrt(e +1) is as is.

-1/2 +1 = 1/2.

The logarithmic terms: ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b). So:

ln( [1 + sqrt(1 + e)] / [1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)] )

Hmm, not sure if that simplifies further.

So putting it all together, the integral is:

sqrt(e^2 +1) - sqrt(e +1) + 1/2 + ln( [1 + sqrt(1 + e)] / [1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)] )

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should compute the numerical values.

Let me compute each term numerically.

First, compute sqrt(e^2 +1):

e is approximately 2.71828, so e^2 is about 7.38906. Adding 1 gives 8.38906. sqrt(8.38906) is approx 2.897.

sqrt(e +1): e is 2.71828, so e+1=3.71828. sqrt(3.71828) is approx 1.928.

So sqrt(e^2 +1) - sqrt(e +1) is approx 2.897 - 1.928 = 0.969.

Then, 1/2 is 0.5.

So so far, 0.969 + 0.5 = 1.469.

Now, the logarithmic term: ln( [1 + sqrt(1 + e)] / [1 + sqrt(e^2 +1)] )

Compute numerator inside the log:

1 + sqrt(1 + e) = 1 + sqrt(3.71828) = 1 + approx 1.928 = 2.928.

Denominator: 1 + sqrt(e^2 +1) = 1 + 2.897 = 3.897.

So the ratio is 2.928 / 3.897 ≈ 0.7516.

Then, ln(0.7516) is approximately -0.284.

So adding that to 1.469: 1.469 - 0.284 ≈ 1.185.

Hmm, so the total integral is approximately 1.185, which is about 1.19. Looking at the options, option F is 1.18, which is close. But wait, maybe my approximations are a bit off. Let me check the calculations more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution steps. Let me go back and see.

Wait, in the substitution for the integral, after substitution t=1/x, the integrand became sqrt(1 + t^2)/t^2, and the integral was from 1/e to e^{-1/2}.

Wait, but when I did the integration by parts, I think I might have messed up the substitution steps. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the integral numerically without substitution.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The integral ∫ sqrt(1 + (1/x)^2) dx from x = e^{1/2} to x = e.

Let me try computing this integral numerically.

Let me denote f(x) = sqrt(1 + (1/x)^2).

We can compute this integral numerically using some method, perhaps the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, but since it's a small interval, maybe I can approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution u = x. Wait, maybe it's better to compute the integral numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps using Wolfram Alpha to compute the exact value, but since this is a thought process, I'll proceed with what I can.

Wait, another approach: let me make substitution t = x, then dt = dx. No, that doesn't help. Maybe hyperbolic substitution.

Wait, let me try substituting x = sinh θ, as I thought before. So, x = sinh θ, then dx = cosh θ dθ. Then sqrt(1 + (1/x)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1/sinh²θ) = sqrt( (sinh²θ +1)/sinh²θ ) = sqrt(cosh²θ)/|sinhθ| = coshθ / sinhθ.

So the integrand becomes (coshθ / sinhθ) * coshθ dθ = (cosh²θ / sinhθ) dθ.

Hmm, that's the same as before. Maybe another substitution: let u = coshθ, then du = sinhθ dθ.

Wait, but the integrand is cosh²θ / sinhθ dθ. Let me write this as (cosh²θ / sinhθ) dθ.

Let me make substitution: Let u = sinhθ, then du = coshθ dθ.

But I have cosh²θ in the numerator. Let me express cosh²θ in terms of u.

cosh²θ = 1 + sinh²θ = 1 + u².

So the integrand becomes (1 + u²) / u * (du / coshθ).

Wait, but coshθ = sqrt(1 + u²). So:

(1 + u²)/u * (du / sqrt(1 + u^2)) ) = (1 + u²)^(1/2) / u du.

Wait, that gives sqrt(1 + u^2)/u du, which brings us back to where we started. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, perhaps another substitution: let v = sqrt(1 + u^2). Then dv = u / sqrt(1 + u^2) du.

Hmm, perhaps not useful
