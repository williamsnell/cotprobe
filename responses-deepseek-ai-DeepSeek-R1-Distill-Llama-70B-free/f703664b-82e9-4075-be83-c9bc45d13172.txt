Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about symbolizing a sentence using propositional logic (PL). The sentence is: "Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds."

And then there are options from A to J, each with a different formula.

Alright, first, I need to break down the sentence into its components and figure out how each part translates into logical symbols.

Let's start by identifying the propositions involved. I'll assign each simple statement a letter:

- Let E stand for "England imports beef."
- Let F stand for "France subsidizes agriculture."
- Let C stand for "China promotes human rights."
- Let S stand for "South Africa supplies diamonds."

So, the first part of the sentence is: "England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." In logic terms, a sufficient condition means that if E happens, then F happens. So this translates to E → F, or in symbols, E ⊃ F.

The second part is a bit trickier: "China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds." The phrase "when and only when" indicates a biconditional, which is an "if and only if" statement. So this is saying that China not promoting human rights (~C) happens exactly when South Africa supplies diamonds (S). So that's ~C ≡ S. Alternatively, this can be written as S ≡ ~C.

Now, the entire sentence is an 'or' statement connecting these two parts. So the structure is (E ⊃ F) ∨ (¬C ≡ S). But I need to check the options to see which one matches this structure.

Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the second part correctly. The original wording is "China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds." So "when and only when" means that ~C is equivalent to S. So yes, that's ~C ≡ S, which is the same as S ≡ ~C.

Alternatively, the biconditional can be written as (S → ~C) ∧ (~C → S). But in propositional logic, ≡ is the biconditional operator, so I can represent it directly with ≡.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: (E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(S ≡ C)
Hmm, this is E⊃F OR not (S biconditional C). That doesn't seem right because our second part was ~C biconditional S, not S biconditional C.

Option B: (E⊃F) ∨ (S⊃C)
This is E→F OR S→C. That doesn't match because our second part was a biconditional, not a simple implication.

Option C: (E⊃F) ∨ (~C⊃S)
This is E→F OR ~C→S. Well, the biconditional ~C≡S is equivalent to (~C→S) ∧ (S→~C). So this option only captures half of it. So it's not exactly the same as the biconditional; it's only one direction.

Option D: (E⊃F) ∨ (~S≡C)
This is E→F OR ~S≡C. That's not our second part, which was ~C≡S, which would be equivalent to S≡~C, not ~S≡C. So D is different.

Option E: (E⊃F) ∨ ~(C≡~S)
This is E→F OR NOT (C biconditional ~S). Let's see: C≡~S is the same as ~S≡C. The negation of that would be ~(C≡~S). But our second part is ~C≡S, which is different. So E doesn't match.

Option F: (E⊃F) ∨ (C⊃~S)
This is E→F OR C→~S. Again, this is a single implication, not the biconditional we need.

Option G: (F⊃E) ∨ (C≡S)
This starts with F→E, which is the converse of our first part. So G is not correct.

Option H: (F⊃E) ∨ (S⊃~C)
Again, F→E is the wrong direction, so H is out.

Option I: (E⊃F) ∨ (~C≡S)
Ah, this looks promising. The first part is E⊃F, which matches, and the second part is ~C≡S, which is exactly what we have for the second part of the sentence. So I is a possible correct answer.

Option J: ~(E⊃F) ∨ (C≡S)
This is NOT (E→F) OR (C≡S). That's not matching our structure, which requires E→F OR something else.

Wait, but let me double-check Option I. The second part in the sentence is "China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds." So that's ~C when and only when S, which is ~C ≡ S, which is exactly what Option I has after the OR.

So the correct formula should be (E⊃F) ∨ (~C≡S), which is Option I.

The question involves symbolizing the sentence: "Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds." 

### Step 1: Assign Propositions
- Let **E** represent "England imports beef."
- Let **F** represent "France subsidizes agriculture."
- Let **C** represent "China promotes human rights."
- Let **S** represent "South Africa supplies diamonds."

### Step 2: Analyze the Sentence
1. **First Part**: "England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture."  
   - This translates to **E → F** or **E ⊃ F**.

2. **Second Part**: "China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds."  
   - The phrase "when and only when" indicates a biconditional relationship.  
   - This translates to **~C ≡ S** (China not promoting human rights if and only if South Africa supplies diamonds).

### Step 3: Combine the Parts
The sentence is structured as an "or" statement connecting the two parts:  
**E ⊃ F** or **~C ≡ S**.  

### Step 4: Evaluate the Options
- **Option A**: **(E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(S ≡ C)**  
  - This represents **E ⊃ F** or **not (S ≡ C)**, which does not match the required **~C ≡ S**.

- **Option B**: **(E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ C)**  
  - This represents **E ⊃ F** or **S → C**, which does not match the biconditional **~C ≡ S**.

- **Option C**: **(E ⊃ F) ∨ (~C ⊃ S)**  
  - This represents **E ⊃ F** or **~C → S**, which captures only one direction of the biconditional.

- **Option D**: **(E ⊃ F) ∨ (~S ≡ C)**  
  - This represents **E ⊃ F** or **~S ≡ C**, which is not equivalent to **~C ≡ S**.

- **Option E**: **(E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(C ≡ ~S)**  
  - This represents **E ⊃ F** or **not (C ≡ ~S)**, which is not equivalent to **~C ≡ S**.

- **Option F**: **(E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ ~S)**  
  - This represents **E ⊃ F** or **C → ~S**, which does not match the biconditional.

- **Option G**: **(F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ S)**  
  - This represents **F → E** or **C ≡ S**, which does not match the structure.

- **Option H**: **(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ ~C)**  
  - This represents **F → E** or **S → ~C**, which does not match the biconditional.

- **Option I**: **(E ⊃ F) ∨ (~C ≡ S)**  
  - This represents **E ⊃ F** or **~C ≡ S**, which matches the sentence exactly.

- **Option J**: **~(E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ≡ S)**  
  - This represents **not (E ⊃ F)** or **C ≡ S**, which does not match the structure.

### Conclusion
The correct formula is **(E ⊃ F) ∨ (~C ≡ S)**, which corresponds to **Option I**.

**Answer: I**
