Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer in a pipe, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about forced convection cooling in a pipe. Air flows through a pipe, and heat is transferred from the pipe to the air. I need to calculate the heat transferred. The options are given, so I need to find the correct one.

Let me first list out all the given data:

- Air speed: 100 ft/sec. That's the velocity of the air through the pipe.
- Inlet temperature: 68°F. I think that's the temperature of the air entering the pipe.
- Pressure at entry: 14.2 psi. Hmm, I might need to convert this to something else, maybe atmospheres or Pascals, but I'm not sure yet.
- Pipe length (L): 3 ft.
- Diameter (d): 0.8 inches. Wait, that's the diameter, so radius would be half, but I might need to convert this to feet because the velocity is in ft/s. So 0.8 inches is 0.8/12 = 0.0667 ft.
- Wall surface temperature (Tw): 200°F. That's hotter than the incoming air, so heat will flow from the pipe to the air.
- Pressure drop: 3.2 inches of water. I remember that pressure drop can be converted into Pascals or other units using specific formulas.

The goal is to find the heat transferred, Q, in Btu/hr.

I think the formula for heat transfer in forced convection is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

But first, I need to find h. For that, I'll probably use the Dittus-Boelter equation for turbulent flow, which is Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33. Since the velocity is 100 ft/s and the pipe diameter is small, I suspect the flow is turbulent.

So steps I need to take:

1. Find the Reynolds number (Re) to confirm if the flow is turbulent.
2. Calculate the Prandtl number (Pr) for air at the given conditions.
3. Use Dittus-Boelter to find the Nusselt number (Nu), then find h from Nu.
4. Calculate the pipe's surface area (A).
5. Calculate the temperature difference, ΔT, which is Tw - T_inlet.
6. Plug into Q = h*A*ΔT.
7. Convert any units as necessary, especially since the answer is in Btu/hr.

Let me start with calculating Reynolds number. Re = (v * d * rho) / μ. But I need air properties at the given conditions.

Wait, I need to find the density (rho) and dynamic viscosity (mu) for air at 68°F and 14.2 psi. Oh wait, 14.2 psi is atmospheric pressure, right? Because standard atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, so 14.2 is a bit lower. But maybe I can assume standard conditions for air properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law to find density. Let's think about that.

First, convert temperature to absolute units. 68°F is (68 + 459.67) = 527.67 °R (Rankine). Pressure is 14.2 psi; to convert to psf (pounds per square foot), multiply by 144 (since 1 psi = 144 psf). So 14.2 * 144 = let's see, 14 * 144 is 2016, 0.2 *144 is 28.8, so total 2044.8 psf.

The ideal gas law: PV = nRT. But density rho is mass per volume. So, for air, which is diatomic, the specific gas constant R can be used. Alternatively, since I'm dealing with units in the English system, maybe I can use the specific gas constant for air.

Wait, the specific gas constant R for air is approximately 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R). But wait, that's per mole, but maybe it's better to use the value per unit mass. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look up the density of air at 68°F and 14.2 psi.

Alternatively, I can use the formula: rho = (P * M) / (R * T), where M is the molar mass, R is the universal gas constant, and P is pressure in absolute units.

Wait, in the English system, R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R). M for air is about 28.97 lbmol.

So, let's compute rho.

P = 14.2 psi.

T = 527.67 °R.

Compute rho = (P * M) / (R*T) = (14.2 * 28.97) / (10.7316 * 527.67)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 14.2 * 28.97 ≈ 14.2 *29 ≈ 411.8, but exact: 14.2 *28.97 = let's calculate:

28.97 *10 = 289.7
28.97 *4.2 = let's compute 28.97 *4=115.88, 28.97 *0.2=5.794, so total 115.88 +5.794=121.674 → total 289.7 +121.674 = 411.374.

Denominator: 10.7316 *527.67 ≈ Let's approximate 10 *527=5270, 0.7316 *527.67≈385. So total denominator ≈5270 +385=5655.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately:

527.67 *10.7316 = Let me compute 527.67 *10 =5276.7, 527.67 *0.7316 ≈ Let's compute 527.67 *0.7 = 369.37, 527.67 *0.0316≈16.68. So total 369.37 +16.68=386.05. So total denominator 5276.7 +386.05=5662.75.

So rho ≈411.374 /5662.75 ≈ roughly 0.0727 lbm/ft³.

Wait, that seems a bit low. I thought air density at 70°F and 1 atm is around 0.0749 lbm/ft³, so 0.0727 is close, considering the pressure is a bit lower than 1 atm (14.7 psi). So that's acceptable.

So rho ≈ 0.0727 lbm/ft³.

Now, find dynamic viscosity mu. For air, at around 68°F (20°C), mu is approximately 1.2e-5 lbm/(ft·s). Wait, I think that's right. Let me confirm: at 20°C, mu for air is about 1.20 x 10^-5 Pa·s. But wait, in lb units, 1 Pa·s = 0.0001450377 lb/ft·s. So 1.2e-5 Pa·s * 0.0001450377 ≈ 1.74e-9 lb/ft·s. Wait, that can't be right because I remember that the viscosity of air in slug/ft·s units is about 3.8e-7. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up with units.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the dynamic viscosity of air at 68°F. Let me think: at 60°F (15°C), mu is about 1.22e-5 lbm/(ft·s) and at 70°F, about 1.25e-5. So maybe 1.23e-5 lbm/(ft·s) for 68°F.

But to be precise, perhaps I can use the approximation. Let's take mu = 1.23e-5 lbm/(ft·s).

Now, compute Reynolds number Re = (v * d * rho) / mu.

v = 100 ft/s.

d = 0.8 inches = 0.8/12 ft = 0.06667 ft.

So Re = (100 * 0.06667 * 0.0727) / (1.23e-5)

Let me compute numerator:

100 *0.06667 =6.667 → 6.667 *0.0727 ≈ 0.484.

Denominator: 1.23e-5.

So Re = 0.484 / 1.23e-5 ≈ 0.484 / 0.0000123 ≈ let's see, 0.484 /0.0000123 → 0.484 /1.23e-5 → 39393.8 approximately.

So Re ≈ 39,394. Since 10,000 is the usual threshold for turbulent flow, this is well into the turbulent regime. So the Dittus-Boelter equation applies.

So the Dittus-Boelter equation is Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33.

Now, I need the Prandtl number (Pr) for air at this temperature. At around 68°F, I think Pr for air is about 0.7. Let me confirm: yes, for air at 60°F, Pr is approximately 0.70, so 0.7 is a good approximation.

So Pr = 0.7.

Now, plug into Dittus-Boelter:

Nu = 0.023 * (39394)^0.8 * (0.7)^0.33.

Let me compute each part:

First, Re^0.8: 39394^0.8.

I know that 39394 is about 3.94e4. Let me compute log(39394) ≈ 4.595.

So 0.8 * log(39394) ≈ 0.8 *4.595=3.676. So antilog is 10^3.676 ≈ 4730. But wait, that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using a calculator approach.

Wait, 39394^0.8 = e^(0.8 * ln(39394)).

Compute ln(39394): ln(39394) ≈ ln(4e4) is about 10.5966. Let me get more precise:

ln(39394) = ?

Well, e^10 is 22026, e^10.6 is e^10 * e^0.6 → 22026 * 1.82211 ≈ 40200. So ln(40200)=10.6.

39394 is a bit less than 40200, so ln(39394) ≈ 10.59.

So 0.8 * ln(39394)= 0.8 *10.59=8.472.

e^8.472 ≈ let's see. e^8 is 2980. e^0.472 is about e^0.4=1.4918, e^0.072=1.0747, so 1.4918 *1.0747≈1.603. So e^8.472≈2980 *1.603≈4778.94.

So Re^0.8 ≈ 4779.

Now, Pr^0.33: 0.7^0.33.

Compute ln(0.7)= -0.35667. Multiply by 0.33 → -0.1178.

e^-0.1178≈0.889.

So Pr^0.33≈0.889.

Now, Nu=0.023 *4779 *0.889.

Compute 0.023 *4779 = 0.023 *4779 ≈ 109.817.

Then multiply by 0.889: 109.817 *0.889 ≈ let's see, 100 *0.889=88.9, 9.817 *0.889≈8.72. So total ≈88.9 +8.72≈97.62.

So Nu≈97.62.

Now, Nusselt number Nu = h * d / k ⇒ h = Nu *k /d.

k is the thermal conductivity of air at this temperature. At 68°F, k for air is approximately 0.015 BTU·hr⁻¹·ft⁻¹·°F⁻¹. Wait, let me confirm: yes, around 0.015.

So h = 97.62 *0.015 / 0.06667 ft.

Compute numerator: 97.62 *0.015=1.4643.

Divide by 0.06667: 1.4643 /0.06667 ≈21.94 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

So h≈21.94.

Wait, that seems a bit low, but I'll proceed.

Now, compute the surface area A of the pipe. The pipe is 3 ft long, diameter 0.8 in. So the circumference is π*d, and the area is π*d*L.

In feet, d=0.8/12 =0.06667 ft.

So A=π * 0.06667 *3 ≈3.1416 *0.06667 *3.

Compute 0.06667 *3 =0.2. So 3.1416 *0.2≈0.6283 ft².

So A≈0.6283 ft².

Now, the temperature difference ΔT is Tw - T_inlet.

Tw=200°F, T_inlet=68°F. So ΔT=200-68=132°F.

So the heat transfer Q = h*A*ΔT =21.94 *0.6283 *132.

Let me compute:

First, 21.94 *0.6283 ≈ let's calculate 20 *0.6283=12.566, 1.94 *0.6283≈1.218. So total ≈12.566 +1.218≈13.784.

Then, 13.784 *132 ≈ let me compute 13 *132=1716, 0.784 *132≈103.5. So total ≈1716+103.5=1819.5 Btu/hr.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. The closest option is A:1750, E:1600, but it's 1819.5, which isn't an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

First, Re was calculated as 39394. But wait, I'm using rho=0.0727 lbm/ft³, mu=1.23e-5 lbm/(ft·s), v=100 ft/s, d=0.06667 ft.

Re = (v*d*rho)/mu = (100 *0.06667 *0.0727) / (1.23e-5).

Compute numerator: 100 *0.06667=6.667. 6.667 *0.0727=0.484. So 0.484 / 1.23e-5 ≈ 39393.8, correct.

In Dittus-Boelter, Re^0.8: I approximated it as 4779, but perhaps that's an issue. Let me try a more accurate approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms more accurately. Let me compute Re^0.8.

Re=39393.8.

ln(39393.8)= ln(39393.8)= let's compute, since e^10=22026, e^10.6= as before≈40,000. So ln(39393.8)=approx 10.58.

0.8 * ln(Re)=0.8*10.58=8.464.

e^8.464= let's compute e^8=2980. e^0.464= approx 1.59 (since e^0.4=1.4918, e^0.064=1.066, so 1.4918*1.066≈1.59). So e^8.464≈2980 *1.59≈4737.

So Re^0.8≈4737.

Pr^0.33: Pr=0.7, so 0.7^0.33= e^(0.33 * ln(0.7)).

ln(0.7)=-0.35667. 0.33*(-0.35667)= -0.1177.

e^-0.1177≈0.8893.

So Nu=0.023 *4737 *0.8893.

Compute 0.023 *4737= let's see, 4737*0.02=94.74, 4737*0.003=14.211. So 94.74 +14.211=108.951.

Then, 108.951 *0.8893≈108.951*0.8=87.16, 108.951*0.0893≈9.74. So total≈96.9.

So Nu≈96.9.

Now, h=Nu*k/d =96.9 *0.015 /0.06667.

Compute numerator:96.9 *0.015=1.4535.

Divide by 0.06667: 1.4535 /0.06667≈21.8 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

So h≈21.8.

Now, A=π*d*L=3.1416 *0.06667 *3=0.6283 ft².

ΔT=200-68=132°F.

So Q=21.8 *0.6283 *132.

Let me compute step by step:

21.8 *0.6283= let's compute 20*0.6283=12.566, 1.8*0.6283≈1.1309. So total≈13.6969.

13.6969 *132= let's compute 13 *132=1716, 0.6969 *132≈91.95. So total≈1716+91.95=1807.95 Btu/hr.

Still around 1808, but the options don't have this. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of h. Let me check the thermal conductivity (k) value.

Wait, is k for air at 68°F really 0.015? Or did I get the units wrong? Because I recall that air's thermal conductivity is around 0.015 BTU·hr⁻¹·ft⁻¹·°F⁻¹ at around 60°F. Let me confirm this. Yes, that's correct. So
