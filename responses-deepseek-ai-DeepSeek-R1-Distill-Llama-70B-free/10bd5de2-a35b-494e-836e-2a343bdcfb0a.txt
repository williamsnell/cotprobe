Okay, so I've got this question about homeowners insurance, and I need to figure out how much Mr. Smith would collect from each company after a fire causes $2,900 in damage. Let's break this down step by step.

First, Mr. Smith has two insurance policies: one with Company A for $10,000 and another with Company B for $3,000. The total damage is $2,900, which is less than the total coverage he has, so I don't think we have to worry about the total coverage exceeding the damage or anything like that.

Wait, but how do multiple insurance policies usually work in cases like this? I remember that typically, if you have two policies covering the same property, they might be considered as primary and secondary. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the insurance companies would split the loss based on their policy limits.

So, the total coverage Mr. Smith has is $10,000 + $3,000 = $13,000. The damage is $2,900, which is part of this total. So perhaps each company would cover a proportion of the loss based on their share of the total coverage.

Let me think about this. The proportion for Company A would be $10,000 / $13,000, and Company B's share would be $3,000 / $13,000. Then, multiply each proportion by the total damage of $2,900.

Calculating Company A's share: (10,000 / 13,000) * 2,900. Let me compute that. 10,000 divided by 13,000 is approximately 0.76923. Multiplying that by 2,900 gives 0.76923 * 2,900 ≈ $2,230.67. 

Company B's share would then be the remaining. So, 2,900 - 2,230.67 ≈ $669.23. Alternatively, I can calculate it directly: (3,000 / 13,000) * 2,900 = 0.23077 * 2,900 ≈ $669.23.

Looking at the options, option J says Company A pays $2,230.7 and Company B pays $669.23. That matches my calculations. But wait, I should make sure this is the correct approach.

Another possibility is whether one policy is primary and the other is secondary. For example, if Company A is the primary insurer, they would pay up to their policy limit first, and then Company B would cover the remaining. But in this case, the damage is $2,900, which is less than Company A's $10,000 limit. So if Company A is primary, they would pay the entire $2,900, and Company B wouldn't pay anything. That would correspond to option B.

But wait, the question doesn't specify which company is primary. Typically, the primary policy is the one with the higher coverage or the one that's considered the main policy. But without that information, I'm not sure. However, in many cases, especially with two policies on the same property, they might both contribute proportionally rather than one being primary.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. If Mr. Smith has two separate policies, perhaps each would cover their proportionate share. So the total coverage is $13,000. The loss is $2,900. Each company's contribution would be (their policy limit / total coverage) multiplied by the loss.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, if you have multiple policies, you can't collect more than the actual loss. So the total collected from both can't exceed $2,900. So in this case, each company's payment would be a fraction based on their policy limits.

So going back to the calculation: (10,000 / 13,000) * 2900 ≈ 2230.77, and (3,000 /13,000)*2900≈669.23. So option J.

Alternatively, if one company is primary, the other would be excess. But without knowing which is primary, I think the default assumption is that they split proportionally.

So I think the correct answer is option J.

To determine how much Mr. Smith would collect from each insurance company after a fire causes $2,900 in damage, we need to analyze the situation based on the given policies. Mr. Smith has two homeowners insurance policies: one with Company A for $10,000 and another with Company B for $3,000. The total coverage is $13,000, and the damage is $2,900, which is less than the total coverage.

In the absence of specific information about which policy is primary or secondary, the most reasonable assumption is that the loss will be split proportionally between the two companies based on their policy limits. This approach ensures that the total payout does not exceed the actual damage of $2,900.

1. **Company A's Share**:  
   Company A's policy limit is $10,000, which represents approximately 76.923% of the total coverage ($10,000 / $13,000). Multiplying this proportion by the total damage gives:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{10,000}{13,000}\right) \times 2,900 \approx 2,230.77
   \]

2. **Company B's Share**:  
   Company B's policy limit is $3,000, which represents approximately 23.077% of the total coverage ($3,000 / $13,000). Multiplying this proportion by the total damage gives:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{3,000}{13,000}\right) \times 2,900 \approx 669.23
   \]

Thus, Company A would pay approximately $2,230.77, and Company B would pay approximately $669.23. This matches the values provided in option J. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: Company A: $2,230.7, Company B: $669.23**
