Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about pumping up a car tire using a bicycle pump. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. 

Alright, the question says: How many full strokes of a bicycle pump would I need to make to pump up an automobile tire from zero to 24 psi gauge pressure. The pump has a chamber diameter of 4.0 cm and is 40.0 cm long. The temperature is constant at 25°C, and atmospheric pressure is one atmosphere. The tire's volume is about 25 liters. 

Wait, I remember that gauge pressure is the pressure above atmospheric pressure. So when the gauge says 24 psi, the absolute pressure is atmospheric plus 24 psi. Since atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, the absolute pressure would be 14.7 + 24 = 38.7 psi. But I'm not sure if I should work in psi or convert to other units like Pascals. Maybe it's easier to stick with psi since the problem provides data in those units.

The problem is about the ideal gas law probably, because it mentions temperature is constant. So PV = nRT, but since temperature is constant and I don't know the number of moles, maybe I can consider the change in pressure and volume. Oh wait, the pump is moving air into the tire, so each stroke adds a certain volume of air at atmospheric pressure, and then it's compressed into the tire's volume. Or wait, no, each stroke might be the pump's displacement volume. 

Wait, I need to think about how a bicycle pump works. Each full stroke draws in air and then expels it into the tire. So each stroke, the pump's chamber fills with air at atmospheric pressure, then is pushed into the tire. So the volume pumped per stroke is the volume of the pump's chamber. 

So first, I should calculate the volume of the pump. The pump is a cylinder, so volume is πr²h. The diameter is 4.0 cm, so radius is 2.0 cm or 0.02 meters. The length (or height) is 40.0 cm, which is 0.4 meters. 

So volume V_pump = π * (0.02 m)^2 * 0.4 m. Let's calculate that. 

Wait, let's compute it step by step. Radius squared is (0.02)^2 = 0.0004 m². Multiply by π: π * 0.0004 ≈ 0.00125664 m³. Then multiply by 0.4 m: 0.00125664 * 0.4 = 0.000502656 m³. Which is 502.656 liters? Wait, wait, no. Because 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters, so 0.000502656 m³ is 0.502656 liters. Oh, wait, no, wait 0.000502656 m³ is 502.656 liters? No, 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 0.0005 m³ is 0.5 liters. So 0.000502656 m³ is about 0.5027 liters per stroke? Hmm, yeah, that makes sense. So each stroke, the pump moves about 0.5027 liters of air. But wait, maybe I confused cm and meters. Let me recheck. 

Wait, diameter is 4.0 cm, so radius is 2.0 cm, which is 0.02 meters. The length is 40 cm, which is 0.4 meters. So yes, the calculation is correct: π*(0.02)^2 * 0.4 = π*0.0004 *0.4 = π*0.00016 = 0.00050265 m³. Which is 0.50265 liters. So about 0.503 liters per stroke. 

So the pump displaces approximately 0.503 liters per stroke. Now, the tire's volume is 25 liters. But wait, the question is about how much air needs to be pumped into the tire to reach a certain pressure. 

Wait, no. The tire's volume is fixed at 25 liters. So when you pump it up, you're increasing the pressure by adding air. So initially, the tire is at 0 psi gauge, which is atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi). Then you pump until it's 24 psi gauge, so 38.7 psi absolute. 

So, using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Since temperature is constant, we can say P1 V1 = P2 V2, but wait, no. Because the number of moles is increasing as we add air. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the amount of air pumped into the tire when it's at atmospheric pressure, and then compressed into the tire's volume at higher pressure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the process as each pump stroke adds a certain volume of air (at atmospheric pressure) into the tire, which then compresses into the tire's volume. So each stroke adds (pump volume) * atmospheric pressure, but in terms of the tire's conditions. 

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the total number of moles needed in the tire at 24 psi gauge, and then see how many pump strokes (each delivering n moles at atmospheric pressure) are needed to reach that. 

Wait, but using the ideal gas law. Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Find the initial and final pressures in absolute terms.

2. The tire's volume is fixed at 25 liters. 

3. The initial state is atmospheric pressure (1 atm), final is 1 atm + 24 psi. 

Wait, but wait, 24 psi is the gauge pressure, so absolute pressure is 14.7 psi +24 psi = 38.7 psi. 

But I need to convert these pressures into the same units as the ideal gas law requires. Since R is commonly used with Pascals, perhaps I should convert everything into Pascals.

So, 1 atmosphere is about 101325 Pascals. 14.7 psi is atmospheric. Let me convert 38.7 psi to Pascals. 

I remember that 1 psi is approximately 6894.76 Pascals. So 38.7 psi * 6894.76 Pa/psi = let's calculate that. 

38.7 * 6894.76 ≈ let's compute:

38 * 6894.76 = 261,980.88
0.7 * 6894.76 ≈ 4,826.33
So total is approx 261,980.88 + 4,826.33 = 266,807.21 Pa.

So P_initial = 101325 Pa, P_final = 266807 Pa.

The volume of the tire is 25 liters, which is 0.025 m³.

Wait, but wait, when you pump, each stroke introduces air at atmospheric pressure into the tire, which then gets compressed to the tire's pressure. So the amount of air (moles) added per stroke is determined by the pump's volume at 1 atm.

So for each stroke, the pump moves V_pump = 0.000503 m³ at P_atm = 101325 Pa. So the number of moles per stroke is (P_atm * V_pump) / (RT). 

Once that air is pushed into the tire, it's now under pressure P_tire. So the total moles in the tire when the pressure is P_tire is (P_tire * V_tire) / (RT).

So the total moles needed is (P_final * V_tire) / (RT) - (P_initial * V_tire)/(RT) = (P_final - P_initial) * V_tire / (RT).

But each pump stroke adds (P_atm * V_pump) / (RT) moles. So the number of strokes N is [(P_final - P_initial)* V_tire / (RT)] / [ (P_atm * V_pump) / (RT) ) ].

Wait, the RT terms cancel out. So N = (P_final - P_initial) * V_tire / (P_atm * V_pump )

Because (P_final - P_initial) is the change in pressure, 24 psi converted to Pascals, which is 24 * 6894.76 = 165,574.24 Pa. Wait wait, no, because P_final is absolute, and P_initial is absolute. So P_final - P_initial is 266,807 Pa - 101,325 Pa = 165,482 Pa.

Wait, earlier calculation: 38.7 psi is 266,807 Pa, and initial is 101,325 Pa. So the difference is 165,482 Pa.

So N = (165,482 Pa) * (0.025 m³) / (101,325 Pa * 0.000503 m³ )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 165482 * 0.025 = ?

165482 * 0.025 = (165482 / 40) = approx 4137.05, because 165482 / 4 = 41370.5, then divided by 10 gives 4137.05.

Denominator: 101325 * 0.000503 = ?

Let me compute 101325 * 0.0005 = 50.6625, and 101325 * 0.000003 is 0.303975. So total is 50.6625 + 0.303975 = 50.966475.

So N = 4137.05 / 50.966475 ≈ let's compute that.

4137.05 ÷ 50.966 ≈ let's see. 50.966 * 80 = 4077.28. 4137.05 - 4077.28 = 59.77. 59.77 /50.966 ≈ ~1.17. So total N≈81.17. So approximately 82 strokes? But wait, wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, 50.966475 * 81 = ?

50 *81=4050, 0.966475 *81≈78.33. So total 4128.33. Which is less than 4137.05.

The difference is 4137.05 - 4128.33=8.72.

So 8.72 /50.966475 ≈ 0.1709. So total N≈81.17. So approximately 82 strokes. But looking at the options, option D is 81, option E is 90. So perhaps 81 is the answer. 

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me compute N again more accurately.

Compute numerator: 165,482 Pa * 0.025 m³.

165482 * 0.025 = 165482 * (1/40) = 4137.05 Pa·m³.

Denominator: 101325 Pa * 0.000503 m³.

101325 * 0.000503 = let's calculate it.

0.000503 = 5.03e-4.

101325 * 5.03e-4 = ?

101325 * 5e-4 = 50.6625

101325 * 0.03e-4 = 101325 *3e-6 = 0.303975.

Wait, 5.03e-4 is 0.000503, so 5e-4 + 0.03e-4 = 0.000503. So 101325 *0.000503 = 50.6625 + 0.0303975 = 50.6928975.

So denominator is approximately 50.6929.

So N = 4137.05 /50.6929 ≈ let me compute.

4137.05 ÷ 50.6929 ≈ let's see:

50.6929 * 81 = 50.6929 *80 = 4055.432; 50.6929 *1=50.6929 → total 4106.125.

But 50.6929 *81 = 4106.1249.

But numerator is 4137.05, which is 4137.05 -4106.125 = 30.925 higher.

So 30.925 /50.6929 ≈ 0.610.

So total N ≈81.610, so about 82 strokes. But the options don't have 82. The closest is option D:81, option I:95, H:100, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pump volume calculation. Let me double-check that.

Pump's diameter is 4 cm, so radius 2 cm. Length is 40 cm.

So the volume is πr²h. r is 0.02 m, h is 0.4 m.

So V_pump = π*(0.02)^2 *0.4 = π *0.0004 *0.4 = π * 0.00016 = 0.00050265 m³, which is 0.50265 liters. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps each stroke only pumps half the volume, because the piston goes up and down? No, no, a full stroke would fill the chamber and push it out. So, per full stroke, the pump displaces its entire volume. So 0.50265 liters per stroke.

Hmm, then the calculation for N is approximately 81.6, which would round to 82. But the options don't include 82. The closest is D: 81.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in pressure difference. Let me check that.

Wait, P_final is 38.7 psi absolute. P_initial is 14.7 psi absolute. So the difference is 24 psi. But wait, when using the formula N = (ΔP * V_tire) / (P_atm * V_pump), but wait, no, that's part of the formula.

Wait, let me re-derive the correct formula.

The number of moles in the tire at the end is (P_final * V_tire) / (RT).

The initial moles is (P_initial * V_tire) / (RT).

So the additional moles needed is (P_final - P_initial) * V_tire / (RT).

Each pump stroke adds (P_atm * V_pump) / (RT) moles.

So the number of strokes N is [ (P_final - P_initial) * V_tire / RT ] / [ P_atm * V_pump / RT ].

The RT cancels, so N = (P_final - P_initial) * V_tire / (P_atm * V_pump).

But wait, wait, P_final is in absolute pressure, and P_initial is absolute. So P_final - P_initial is 24 psi, which is 165,574.4 Pa. Wait no, 24 psi is 24 * 6894.76 ≈ 165,574.4 Pa.

Wait, but in the previous calculation, I considered P_final as 38.7 psi absolute, so P_final - P_initial is 24 psi, which is 165,574.4 Pa. But in my initial calculation, I used P_final - P_initial as 165,482 Pa. Wait, perhaps I should just use 24 psi converted to Pa, because that's the actual pressure difference, regardless of absolute.

Wait, no: in the formula, it's (P_final_abs - P_initial_abs) that matters. Because P_final_abs = P_initial_abs + 24 psi. So the difference is 24 psi. So perhaps I should compute (P_final_abs - P_initial_abs) as 24 psi in Pascals.

Wait, 24 psi is 24 * 6894.76 Pa = 165574.24 Pa.

So perhaps I should use 165574.24 Pa as ΔP.

So let me recalculate N with ΔP = 165574.24 Pa.

N = (165574.24 Pa) * (0.025 m³) / (101325 Pa * 0.000503 m³ )

Compute numerator: 165574.24 * 0.025 = 4139.356 liters·Pa.

Denominator:101325 * 0.000503 = 50.966 Pa·m³.

So N = 4139.356 /50.966 ≈ let's compute.

50.966 * 81 = 50.966 *80=4077.28, 50.966 *1=50.966 → total 4128.246.

4139.356 - 4128.246 =11.11.

11.11 /50.966 ≈ 0.218.

So N≈81.218. So about 81.22 strokes. So approximately 81 full strokes. Which matches option D:81.

So the answer should be D.

To determine how many full strokes of a bicycle pump are needed to pump up an automobile tire from 0 psi (gauge) to 24 psi (gauge), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Pump specifications**:
   - Diameter: 4.0 cm → Radius = 2.0 cm = 0.02 m
   - Length: 40.0 cm = 0.4 m
   - Volume of the pump chamber:  
     \[
     V_{\text{pump}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (0.02)^2 (0.4) = 0.00050265 \, \text{m}^3 = 0.50265 \, \text{liters}
     \]

2. **Tire specifications**:
   - Volume: \( V_{\text{tire}} = 25 \, \text{liters} = 0.025 \, \text{m}^3 \)
   - Initial pressure (absolute): \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \)
   - Final pressure (absolute): \( P_{\text{final}} = 1 \, \text{atm} + 24 \, \text{psi} = 38.7 \, \text{psi} \)
     - Convert \( 38.7 \, \text{psi} \) to Pascals:  
       \[
       P_{\text{final}} = 38.7 \times 6894.76 = 266807 \, \text{Pa}
       \]
   - Pressure difference:  
     \[
     \Delta P = P_{\text{final}} - P_{\text{initial}} = 266807 - 101325 = 165482 \, \text{Pa}
     \]

3. **Atmospheric pressure**: \( P_{\text{atm}} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \)
