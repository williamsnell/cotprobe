Question:

This jurisdiction has the following bribery statute in effect:"Any person who offers or gives a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty of bribery. "A real estate developer owned a large parcel of land in the suburbs. Although the developer wanted to build an office building on the property, the land was zoned residential. Due to the residential zoning, the developer could not pursue his planned development unless he received a variance from the building commission. The developer held a meeting with a member of the building commission to solicit his approval in securing a zoning variance. To do so, the developer gave the commission member $10,000 in exchange for his support in approving the zoning variance. Thereupon, the commission member voted to approve the variance, thus making it possible for the developer to commence construction of the office building. The developer was subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. During the course of the trial, the commission member testified that he faked the agreement with the developer and would have approved the zoning variance regardless of whether the developer gave him any money. Furthermore, in his defense, the developer presented evidence that the other six members of the building commission voted affirmatively to approve the variance. If the jury believed that the commission member would have approved the variance even had he not received the $10,000, the developer should be found

Options:

A: guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.
B: guilty, because he gave the commission member the $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.
C: not guilty, because the commission member did not receive a thing of value, since he would have approved the variance regardless of receiving any payment from the developer.
D: not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this bribery conspiracy question. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a real estate developer who wanted to build an office building, but the land was zoned residential. He needed a variance from the building commission. He met with a commission member and gave him $10,000 in exchange for his support. The commission member ended up voting to approve the variance, which allowed the developer to proceed.

Now, the developer is prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. At trial, the commission member testified that he faked the agreement and would have approved the variance anyway, regardless of the money. Also, the developer presented evidence that the other six members voted yes, so the variance was approved even without this particular member's vote.

The question is, if the jury believes the commission member's testimony, should the developer be found guilty or not guilty?

Looking at the bribery statute: "Any person who offers or gives a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty of bribery." So, the key elements are offering or giving something of value in exchange for official action.

But this is a conspiracy charge. Conspiracy usually requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, with the intent to achieve that goal. So, for conspiracy to commit bribery, the developer and the commission member must have agreed to commit bribery.

Wait, but in this case, the commission member says he was just faking it and would have approved the variance regardless. So, was there a real agreement? If the member wasn't actually going to perform the official action in exchange for the money, does that affect the conspiracy?

I think that for conspiracy, the parties must have a meeting of the minds to commit the crime. If the commission member didn't intend to actually do anything in exchange, maybe there's no real agreement. But wait, the developer offered the money intending to bribe, and the member accepted it. But if the member had no intention to influence his vote, then maybe there's no true conspiracy.

Alternatively, some might argue that the mere offer and acceptance is enough for a conspiracy, regardless of the member's actual intent. But I think the law requires a mutual intent to commit the crime. If one party isn't on board, there's no conspiracy.

Looking at the options:

Option A says guilty because the agreement to accept the money was enough. But if the member didn't really agree to perform the action, maybe that's not sufficient.

Option B says guilty because he gave the money in exchange for approval. But the issue is whether the exchange was for official action. If the member was going to approve anyway, perhaps it wasn't really in exchange, but the developer thought it was.

Option C says not guilty because the member didn't receive a thing of value since he would have approved regardless. But that doesn't make sense because the developer gave the money, which is a thing of value. The member did receive it, regardless of whether he needed it.

Option D says not guilty because there was no true agreement. That seems plausible if the member didn't agree to anything, just took the money without intending to influence his vote.

So, the key is whether a conspiracy requires both parties to have the intent to commit the crime. If the member didn't intend to be bribed, just took the money without planning to change his action, then there's no meeting of the minds. Therefore, no conspiracy.

So, the developer offered the bribe, but if the member didn't agree to accept it in exchange for action, then the conspiracy didn't happen.

Therefore, the answer should be D: not guilty because there was no true agreement.

The question revolves around whether the developer can be convicted of conspiracy to commit bribery under the given statute. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two parties to commit a crime, with mutual intent. Here, the developer offered $10,000 to a commission member in exchange for approving a zoning variance. However, the commission member testified that he would have approved the variance regardless of the payment, indicating he did not intend to exchange his vote for the money. 

For conspiracy, a "meeting of the minds" is essential. If the commission member did not agree to perform official action in exchange for the money, there was no true agreement to commit bribery. While the developer offered the money with the intent to bribe, the lack of mutual intent from the commission member means the conspiracy did not exist. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because the commission member's acceptance of money without intent to influence his vote does not satisfy the requirement for a conspiratorial agreement.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the exchange must be for official action, which the commission member testified he would have taken regardless of the payment.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because the commission member did receive a thing of value; the issue is the lack of agreement, not the receipt of value.
- **Option D**: Correct because the absence of mutual intent means there was no true agreement, a necessary element of conspiracy.

Thus, the developer should be found not guilty due to the lack of a true agreement. 

Answer: D
