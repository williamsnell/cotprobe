Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what it's about. 

Alright, the question is about two people on a frictionless pond. One is heavier, 100 kg, and the other is 50 kg. They're facing each other, and the heavier one pushes the lighter one with a force F. Then there are several options about the forces and accelerations each experiences.

Hmm, I remember from Newton's laws that when two objects interact, they apply forces to one another. Newton's third law, right? So if one pushes the other, the other pushes back with equal and opposite force. So the force the heavier person exerts on the lighter is F, which means the lighter exerts a force of -F (opposite direction) on the heavier.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see which one matches that. Option A says the heavier feels 2F, which doesn't sound right because it should just be F in the opposite direction. Option E says the force felt is -2F, but that also doesn't seem right. Option I says the heavier feels (-1/2)F, which doesn't fit either. So perhaps the correct force on each is just F and -F respectively.

Wait, but the options don't seem to have that. Let me check again. Oh wait, the options might be referring to which person feels which force. Option A is about the heavier person feeling 2F. That's probably wrong because the force is just F. Option E says the person feels -2F, but the direction depends on who's pushing whom. Maybe the options are phrased a bit differently.

Wait, the question says the heavier pushes the lighter with force F. So the heavier applies a force F on the lighter. By Newton's third law, the lighter applies a force of -F on the heavier. So the heavier person feels a force of -F. Hmm, looking for an option that says the heavier feels -F. Let's see.

Looking at the options: 

Option E says the force felt by the person is -2F. No, because it's just -F. Option I says the heavier feels (-1/2)F. No. So perhaps none of the options directly state that the force is -F for the heavier. Wait, let me check all the options again.

Options A through J: 

A: the force felt by the heavier person is 2F. No, because it's F but opposite direction.

B: the heavier's acceleration is half of the lighter's. Hmm, that's about acceleration, not force.

C: the lighter feels -2F. Not right, because it's -F.

D: lighter's acceleration is half of heavier's. That would relate to their masses.

E: the force felt by the person is -2F. Wait, "the person" here is the heavier? Or the lighter? The question says "if the heavier person pushes on the lighter one with force F, then which is correct." So the question is about the forces each feels. 

Wait, when the heavier pushes the lighter with force F, the lighter feels F (assuming F is the push direction), and the heavier feels -F. So the options about forces: which one fits.

Looking at the options:

Option E: the force felt by the person is -2F. Hmm, that's not correct because it's -F. So maybe none of the force options are correct except perhaps something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read each carefully.

Option A: Heavier feels 2F. No.

Option B: acceleration of heavier is half that of lighter.

Wait, acceleration is F/m. So the heavier person has a mass of 100 kg, so acceleration a1 = F /100. The lighter is 50 kg, so a2 = F /50. So a2 is twice a1. So the lighter accelerates twice as much as the heavier.

Looking at the options, option H says the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier. So H would be correct in that aspect.

Wait the options given:

B: heavier's acceleration is half of lighter's. So that would be a1 = 0.5 a2. Which is correct because a2 is twice as big. So B is correct.

Wait, what about the options for the forces? Looking again.

Option E: the force felt by the person is -2F. Hmm, no, because it's -F. So not correct.

Option H is about acceleration, which I think is correct. Let me see what the options are again.

Option B says the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier is half the lighter's. Yes. Because a1 = F/100, a2 = F/50. a2 = 2a1, so a1 = 0.5 a2. So B is correct.

Now looking at the options, which one is correct? The question is asking which statement is correct.

So the possible correct options are B and H, perhaps. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the question is which of the options is correct. Let me re-examine each option:

Option B: the heavier's acceleration is half of the lighter's. Correct, because a_heavy = F/100, a_light = F/50. So a_heavy = (1/2)a_light.

Option H: the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's, which is the same as B. So both B and H are correct? Wait, no, B says "half" and H says "twice", so if B is correct, then H is also correct. But that can't be, because in the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, no, the options are separate. Let me see: if the heavier's acceleration is (F/100), and the lighter's is (F/50), then (F/50) is twice (F/100). So the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's. So H says that, so H is correct.

Wait, but then B is also correct because the heavier's acceleration is half of the lighter's. So both B and H are correct? That can't be the case because each option is a separate choice, and only one can be correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as A to J, each a separate statement. So either B or H would be correct, but in this case, both B and H are correct, which can't be. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, the situation is: 

Heavier (100kg) pushes lighter (50kg) with F. So according to Newton's third law, the lighter exerts -F on the heavier. 

The acceleration of the heavier is a1 = (-F)/100, because F is the force applied by the lighter on the heavier. 

The acceleration of the lighter is a2 = F/50.

So a1 = (-F)/100, a2 = F/50.

The magnitude of a1 is F/100, a2 is F/50. So |a2| = 2 * |a1|. So the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's. So option H says this, which is correct.

Option B says heavier's acceleration is half of lighter's. That's also correct because |a1|= (1/2)|a2|.

Wait, but how can both B and H be correct? Because they're different options. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Option B: the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person.

Option H: the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person.

So both B and H are correct statements, but that can't be. Because each option is a separate choice, but in reality, they are equivalent statements.

Wait, but perhaps the question is only providing one correct option. So perhaps either B or H is correct, but not both. Or perhaps I made a mistake in which one.

Wait, let me recheck the accelerations.

Heavier: mass 100 kg. Force on him is -F (since the lighter pushes back). So a_heavy = F_net/m = (-F)/100 = -F/100. Magnitude is F/100.

Lighter: mass 50 kg. Force is F (pushed by heavier). So a_light = F/50. Magnitude is F/50.

So a_light is (F/50) and a_heavy is (F/100). So a_light is 2 * a_heavy. So H is correct. B is also correct because a_heavy is half a_light.

Wait, but in the options, both B and H cannot be correct because each is a separate option. So perhaps I need to look again at the options to see which one is present.

Looking back, the options are:

A: heavier feels 2F → no
B: heavier's acceleration is half → yes
C: lighter feels -2F → no
D: lighter's acceleration is half → no
E: someone feels -2F → no
F: heavier's acceleration is twice → no
G: lighter feels (-1/2)F → no
H: lighter's acceleration is twice → yes
I: heavier feels (-1/2)F → no

So both B and H are correct. But that can't be, since each option is separate.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read the question again.

The question states: the heavier pushes the lighter with a force F. So the force experienced by the lighter is F. Then, by Newton's third law, the heavier feels a force of -F.

So the force on the lighter is F, the force on the heavier is -F.

Looking at options about forces:

Option C: lighter feels -2F → no
Option E: someone feels -2F → no
Option G: lighter feels (-1/2)F → no
So none of the force options seem correct except perhaps none, because the correct forces are F and -F.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is about accelerations, not forces. So between B and H, which is correct.

B and H are both correct in what they state. But that can't be, because in the options only one can be correct. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or H, but I need to see which one is presented as an option.

Wait, looking at the options, both B and H are present. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. Since the heavier applies a force F on the lighter, the lighter feels F, and the heavier feels -F. So their forces are F and -F. 

But when considering the accelerations, the lighter person (50 kg) will have a higher acceleration. So a_light = F/50, a_heavy = F/100. So a_light = 2 a_heavy. So option H is correct.

So the correct option is H.

Wait, but option B says the heavier's acceleration is half of the lighter's. Which is the same as H. So both are correct statements, but in the options, each is a separate choice. So perhaps the intended answer is H.

But looking at the options, maybe only one is correct.

Wait, the question asks which of the options is correct. So either B or H would be correct. But in the options, both B and H are presented, so perhaps the correct answer is both, but in multiple-choice tests, only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the thinking. Let me re-calculate.

Heavier's acceleration: a1 = F_heavy / m_heavy. F_heavy is the force on him, which is -F. So a1 = (-F)/100.

Lighter's acceleration: a2 = F_lighter / m_lighter. F_lighter is F. So a2 = F/50.

So |a1| = F/100, |a2| = F/50. So |a2| = 2 |a1|.

So H says the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's. So H is correct.

Option B says the heavier's acceleration is half of the lighter's. Which is also correct because |a1|=0.5 |a2|.

So in the options, both B and H are correct. But that's impossible because only one answer is correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the options are presented.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the options are for different aspects. Let me re-examine the options:

Option B: the acceleration of the heavier is half of the lighter's. Correct.

Option H: the acceleration of the lighter is twice the heavier's. Also correct.

So perhaps both B and H are correct. But in the options, each is a separate choice. So the answer must include both, but that's not possible in a single-select question.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the magnitude, so perhaps both are correct, but in the options, only one is presented. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question asks which of the options is correct. So if both B and H are correct, but the options only list one of them, but in reality, both are correct. But perhaps in this case, only one is correct, or perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that only one option is correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options given:

Option B: heavier's acceleration is half of lighter's.

Option H: lighter's acceleration is twice heavier's.

So both are correct, but as per the options, both can't be selected. Therefore, perhaps the intended correct answer is either B or H.

But the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the forces. Let me think again.

The heavier pushes the lighter with a force F → the lighter feels F, heavier feels -F.

Then, the accelerations are a_heavy = (-F)/100, a_light = F/50.

So a_heavy = -F/100, a_light = F/50 → a_light = -2 a_heavy.

So the magnitude of a_light is twice that of a_heavy. So the correct statement is H.

So the correct answer is H.

So looking at the options, the correct answer is H.

The problem involves two people on a frictionless pond: one with a mass of 100 kg (heavier) and the other with a mass of 50 kg (lighter). The heavier person pushes the lighter one with a force \( F \). According to Newton's third law, the lighter person exerts an equal and opposite force \( -F \) on the heavier person. The accelerations of the two individuals can be calculated using \( a = F/m \).

1. **Forces**:  
   - The lighter person experiences a force \( F \) from the heavier person.  
   - The heavier person experiences a force \( -F \) from the lighter person.  

   None of the force-related options (A, C, E, G, I) correctly describe the forces, as they either incorrectly magnitude or direction.

2. **Accelerations**:  
   - The acceleration of the heavier person is \( a_{\text{heavy}} = -F/100 \).  
   - The acceleration of the lighter person is \( a_{\text{light}} = F/50 \).  

   The magnitudes of the accelerations are related as \( |a_{\text{light}}| = 2|a_{\text{heavy}}| \). This means the lighter person's acceleration is twice the heavier person's acceleration.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option B**: "The magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person."  
     This is correct because \( |a_{\text{heavy}}| = \frac{1}{2}|a_{\text{light}}| \).  

   - **Option H**: "The magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person."  
     This is also correct because \( |a_{\text{light}}| = 2|a_{\text{heavy}}| \).  

   While both B and H are correct statements, they are equivalent in meaning. Since only one answer can be selected, the correct choice is **H**, as it directly describes the relationship between the accelerations.

**Answer: H**
