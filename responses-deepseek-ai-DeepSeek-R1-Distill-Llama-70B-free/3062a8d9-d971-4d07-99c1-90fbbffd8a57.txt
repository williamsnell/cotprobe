Question:

According to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde, in what ways does the Copenhagen School's approach to Security Studies differ from that of Critical Security Studies?

Options:

A: The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.
B: Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.
C: Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.
D: Neither Critical Security Studies nor the Copenhagen School account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the differences between the Copenhagen School and Critical Security Studies according to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

I remember that both schools are part of Security Studies but have different approaches. The Copenhagen School, I think, is associated with the concept of securitization. They talk about how issues become security issues through speech acts. So they're more about how security is constructed socially. That sounds like a constructivist approach, maybe even a bit post-structuralist because they're looking at how language and discourse shape security.

On the other hand, Critical Security Studies (CSS) is more on the critical theory side. I think CSS is influenced by post-structuralism, maybe people like Foucault. They question the traditional notions of security, often focusing on whose security is being prioritized and the power dynamics involved. They might argue that security is socially constructed and that traditional approaches are too state-centric.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is asking how they differ. So the Copenhagen School is often seen as a middle ground between traditional and critical approaches. They use a broad security agenda, considering sectors like economic, environmental, etc., but they might still have a more structured framework.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that the theories are fundamentally at odds. Critical is post-structuralist and constructivist, while Copenhagen is objectivist. Hmm, I thought Copenhagen was constructivist because they focus on how security is constructed through language. So maybe A is incorrect because it's the opposite.

Option B: Critical sees security as a social construction, while Copenhagen studies it objectively from a positivist approach. Wait, that can't be right. I thought Copenhagen also sees security as a social construct. So B might be wrong.

Option C: Critical views security as empirically definable and positivist, while Copenhagen sees it as socially constructed. That doesn't sound right because I think Critical is more about social construction, not positivist. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Neither accounts for changing society. No, both do, I think. They just approach it differently. So D is wrong.

Wait, maybe I got the options mixed up. Let me rethink. The Copenhagen School is sometimes called a 'constructivist' approach because they look at how security is constructed through discourse. Critical Security Studies, being more critical, might take a post-structuralist view, which is a type of constructivism but perhaps more focused on power and discourse.

So the main difference is in their epistemology. The Copenhagen School might be more of a constructivist but still within a more traditional framework, possibly with a positivist approach in terms of methodology. Or maybe not. Wait, no. Constructivists are usually opposed to positivism.

Wait, positivism is about objectivity and empiricism, right? So if the Copenhagen School is using a more objective approach, maybe they align with positivism, while Critical is more post-structuralist and thus against positivism.

But I thought the Copenhagen School is constructivist, which is not positivist. Hmm. Let me think again.

The question is about their approaches according to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde. I remember that Buzan and Waever are associated with the Copenhagen School. They might have discussed the differences in their works.

In their book "Security: A New Framework for Analysis," Buzan and Waever outline their approach, which is about sectors of security and how they are securitized. They might have positioned their approach as a bridge between traditional and critical perspectives.

So the Copenhagen School's approach is more about broadening the security agenda beyond the state and military, considering economic, environmental, etc., sectors. They use a constructivist framework, seeing security as a social construct.

Critical Security Studies, on the other hand, is more about deconstructing security, questioning the dominant discourses, and often focusing on emancipation. They might be more critical of the traditional state-centric views and look at security from the perspective of marginalized groups.

So in terms of epistemology, the Copenhagen School might be constructivist, while Critical is post-structuralist. Wait, but constructivist is a broader term. So perhaps the difference is that Critical is more post-structuralist, which is a subset of constructivism.

Looking back at the options, option A says that the theories are at odds. Critical is post-structuralist and constructivist, while Copenhagen is objectivist. Wait, that would mean Copenhagen is positivist. But I thought they were constructivists. So option A would be incorrect.

Option B says Critical sees security as a social construction, while Copenhagen is positivist. If that's the case, then B would be correct. But I'm not sure. Maybe the Copenhagen School is more positivist in their methods.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The Copenhagen School's approach is considered 'thin constructivist,' meaning they still use a more empirical approach, while Critical is 'thick constructivist' or post-structuralist. So perhaps the Copenhagen School is more positivist in their epistemology, while Critical is more relativist.

If that's the case, then option B would be correct. Because Critical sees security as a social construction, while Copenhagen takes a positivist approach, studying it objectively.

Wait, but I thought the Copenhagen School is constructivist, which is different from positivism. So maybe option A is correct? Option A says Critical is post-structuralist and constructivist, while Copenhagen is objectivist (positivist). That would align with what I thought earlier.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to clarify.

Positivism is an epistemological position that believes in objective observation and the scientific method. Constructivism, on the other hand, argues that knowledge is constructed through social practices.

So if the Copenhagen School is constructivist, they don't take a positivist approach. So option B, which says Copenhagen is positivist, would be wrong.

Wait, but option A says that the theories are at odds, with Critical being post-structuralist and constructivist, while Copenhagen is objectivist. If the Copenhagen School is objectivist, that would be positivist. But I thought they were constructivists.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to their ontological and epistemological differences. Maybe the Copenhagen School is more positivist in their approach, while Critical is more post-structuralist.

I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct answer is A or B.

Wait, another approach: The Copenhagen School's securitization theory is about how security is constructed through speech acts, so they're social constructivists. Critical Security Studies, influenced by post-structuralism, would also see security as a social construct but perhaps focus more on the power dynamics and deconstruction of dominant discourses.

So both see security as a social construct. So options B and C can't be correct because they say one sees it as social and the other doesn't. Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the theories are at odds. Critical is post-structuralist and constructivist, while Copenhagen is objectivist. So that would mean that Critical is more about social construction, while Copenhagen is positivist, which is the opposite.

But if both agree that security is a social construct, then perhaps the difference is in their epistemology. The Copenhagen School might take a more positivist approach, trying to observe and measure securitization, while Critical takes a more relativist approach, questioning the very notion of security.

So in that case, option B would be correct: Critical sees security as a social construction (so they are constructivists), while Copenhagen disregards that and takes a positivist approach. But wait, that can't be right because the Copenhagen School does see security as a social construct.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the options. Option B says Critical regards security as a social construction, while Copenhagen disregards it and takes a positivist approach. But if both regard security as a construct, then that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the correct answer.

The correct answer is A: The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.

Wait, but if both are constructivists, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the Copenhagen School is more of a rationalist approach, while Critical is reflectivist.

Wait, maybe I should recall that the Copenhagen School is considered part of the constructivist or social constructivist approach, which is a middle ground between rationalism and reflectivism. Critical Security Studies is more on the reflectivist side, with post-structuralism being a branch of reflectivism.

So the difference is that Critical is more post-structuralist and reflectivist, while the Copenhagen School is constructivist but perhaps more positivist in their methods. Or maybe the Copenhagen School is more positivist.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should just make an educated guess.

I think the correct answer is A: The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, option B might be correct if the Copenhagen School is positivist. But I think the Copenhagen School is constructivist, so option A is incorrect because both are constructivists.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A is wrong, and the correct answer is option B. Because Critical is constructivist, seeing security as a social construct, while Copenhagen is positivist, seeing it as objective.

No, that can't be right because the Copenhagen School's securitization theory is about social construction.

I'm really stuck, but I think the correct answer is option A is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: Critical Security Studies often critiques the Copenhagen School for not going far enough in problematizing security and for retaining a state-centric focus. So perhaps the difference is in their epistemological and theoretical foundations. The Copenhagen School is more constructivist, while Critical is post-structuralist.

Wait, but option A says that Critical is post-structuralist and constructivist, while Copenhagen is objectivist. That can't be, because constructivism is different from objectivism.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Objectivist epistemology is about believing in an objective reality that can be studied, which aligns with positivism. So if the Copenhagen School is objectivist, they are positivists, while Critical is constructivist/post-structuralist.

So option A says that Critical is post-structuralist and constructivist, while Copenhagen is objectivist. That would make sense as the two being at odds.

So the correct answer would be A.

The question asks about the differences between the Copenhagen School and Critical Security Studies (CSS) according to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde. To answer this, it is important to analyze the epistemological and theoretical underpinnings of each approach.

The Copenhagen School, associated with scholars like Buzan and Waever, is known for its constructivist approach to security studies. It focuses on how security is socially constructed through discourse and practices, particularly through the concept of securitization. This approach broadens the security agenda beyond traditional state-centric and military concerns to include sectors like economic, environmental, and societal security. While the Copenhagen School incorporates constructivist ideas, it is often criticized for retaining elements of objectivism and positivism in its methodology, which sets it apart from more critical approaches.

Critical Security Studies, on the other hand, is deeply influenced by post-structuralist and critical theory. It emphasizes the power dynamics and social constructions that shape security discourses, often questioning whose security is prioritized and challenging dominant narratives. CSS is more radical in its critique of traditional security frameworks and aligns with reflectivist or post-structuralist epistemologies.

Given these distinctions, the key difference lies in their epistemological foundations. The Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology, which aligns with positivist approaches to studying security as an observable and measurable phenomenon. In contrast, Critical Security Studies adopts a post-structuralist and constructivist perspective, viewing security as a socially constructed concept shaped by power and discourse.

Option A correctly captures this fundamental difference, stating that the theories and knowledge underpinning each approach are at odds. While Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.
