Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically the Sales Article and the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the UCC covers commercial transactions, and the Sales Article (Article 2) deals with the sale of goods. Implied warranties are important here because they're automatically part of the contract unless excluded or modified.

There are a few key implied warranties. I think the main ones are the warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Merchantability is about the goods being fit for their ordinary purpose. But the question is about fitness for a particular purpose, so I should focus on that.

From what I recall, the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises when the seller has reason to know the buyer's particular purpose and that the buyer is relying on the seller's judgment or expertise. So it's more specific than just merchantability.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this condition. Let's go through each option:

Option A: The seller knows the purpose and is a professional. Hmm, being a professional might relate to merchant status. The UCC often refers to a merchant as someone who deals in such goods. So maybe this is about the seller being a merchant and knowing the purpose.

Option B: Seller knows purpose, but buyer isn't relying on seller's skill. That doesn't fit because reliance is key. Without reliance, the warranty doesn't arise.

Option C: Buyer relies on seller's reputation. Reputation might tie into merchant status, but the main point is whether the seller knows the purpose and the buyer's reliance on the seller's judgment. Not sure if this is the best fit.

Option D: Buyer's particular purpose and seller is a merchant. This includes being a merchant, which is relevant, but does it mention the seller knowing the purpose or the reliance?

Option E: Buyer's particular purpose and relying on seller's skill or judgment. This seems close. It mentions reliance on the seller's skill, which I think is a key element. But does it require the seller to know the purpose?

Option F: Seller knows purpose and buyer is relying. This combines both elements: seller knows the purpose and buyer relies on seller's skill. This seems to fit perfectly.

Option G: Seller knows purpose and is a merchant. So this includes merchant status but doesn't mention the buyer's reliance on the seller's judgment. So maybe not the best fit.

Option H: Seller doesn't know purpose but is a merchant. That can't be right because if the seller doesn't know, the warranty doesn't apply.

Option I: Buyer's general purpose and seller is a merchant. That's about merchantability, not particular purpose.

Option J: Buyer's particular purpose but seller isn't a merchant. The warranty can still apply even if the seller isn't a merchant, as long as they know the purpose and the buyer relies on their judgment. But the option doesn't mention the seller knowing or the reliance.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the exact conditions. Under UCC § 2-315, the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is implied when:

1. The seller has reason to know the particular purpose for which the goods are required.
2. The seller knows (or should know) that the buyer is relying on the seller's judgment to select suitable goods.

So both conditions must be met. The seller must know the purpose, and the buyer must be relying on the seller's expertise.

Looking back at the options, option F says: "The seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and knows the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to select suitable goods." That exactly matches both conditions.

But wait, another thought. The UCC doesn't necessarily require the seller to be a merchant for this warranty. It's more about the seller's knowledge and the buyer's reliance. So maybe option E is a contender. Option E says the buyer is relying on the seller's skill, but it doesn't say the seller knows the purpose. So without the seller knowing the purpose, the warranty doesn't arise.

Therefore, the correct answer must include both elements: seller's knowledge of the purpose and buyer's reliance. So that's option F.

Under the Sales Article of the UCC, the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises when two conditions are met:

1. The seller has reason to know the particular purpose for which the goods are required.
2. The seller knows (or should know) that the buyer is relying on the seller's judgment to select suitable goods.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Mentions the seller's professional status but does not address the buyer's reliance on the seller's judgment.
- **Option B**: States the seller knows the purpose but explicitly excludes reliance, which is a critical element.
- **Option C**: Focuses on the buyer's reliance on the seller's reputation, which is not the same as relying on the seller's skill or judgment.
- **Option D**: Includes the seller being a merchant but does not specify the seller's knowledge of the purpose or the buyer's reliance.
- **Option E**: Highlights the buyer's reliance on the seller's skill or judgment but does not mention the seller's knowledge of the purpose.
- **Option F**: Combines both required elements: the seller knows the purpose and is aware of the buyer's reliance on their skill or judgment. This matches the UCC's criteria perfectly.
- **Option G**: Includes the seller's knowledge of the purpose and merchant status but omits the buyer's reliance.
- **Option H**: States the seller is unaware of the purpose, which disqualifies it.
- **Option I**: Refers to a general purpose, which pertains to the warranty of merchantability, not fitness for a particular purpose.
- **Option J**: Mentions the buyer's particular purpose but does not address the seller's knowledge or the buyer's reliance.

The correct answer is **Option F**, as it satisfies both conditions under UCC § 2-315.

Answer: F
