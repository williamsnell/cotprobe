Okay, so I have this problem where I need to solve three equations using Cramer's rule. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The equations are:

1. 2x + 3y + z = 8
2. 4x + 4y + 4z = 12
3. x + y + 8z = 10

Wait, wait. Cramer's rule is for systems of linear equations, right? It uses determinants. I remember that for three equations with three variables, I'll need to compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix and then determinants for each variable by replacing the respective column with the constants.

Let me write down the coefficient matrix first. The variables are x, y, z.

So the coefficients are:

Equation 1: 2, 3, 1
Equation 2: 4, 4, 4
Equation 3: 1, 1, 8

So the coefficient matrix D is:

|2   3   1|
|4   4   4|
|1   1   8|

I need to compute the determinant of D. Let me calculate that.

The determinant D is calculated as:

2*(4*8 - 4*1) - 3*(4*8 - 4*1) + 1*(4*1 - 4*1)

Wait, maybe I should expand it properly.

Alternatively, using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let me do cofactor expansion along the first row.

So:

2 * determinant of the minor for 2 (which is the submatrix excluding row 1, col 1):

|4 4|
|1 8| → (4*8 - 4*1) = 32 -4 =28. So 2*28 =56

Then, -3 * determinant for 3's minor:

The minor is:

|4 4|
|1 8| → same as above, 28. So -3 *28 = -84

Then, +1 * determinant for the minor of 1 at (1,3):

Minor:

|4 4|
|1 1| → determinant is (4*1 -4*1) =4-4=0. So 1*0=0.

So D = 56 -84 +0 = -28.

Hmm, the determinant D is -28. Okay.

Now, for each variable, I need to replace the respective column with the constants vector, which is [8,12,10], and compute the determinants Dx, Dy, Dz.

Let's compute Dx first. Dx is replacing the first column (x's column) with [8,12,10].

So Dx matrix:

|8   3   1|
|12  4   4|
|10  1   8|

Compute determinant Dx.

Again, expanding along the first row:

8 * determinant of minor:
|4 4|
|1 8| → 4*8 -4*1 =32-4=28 → 8*28=224

Then, -3 * determinant of:
|12 4|
|10 8| → 12*8 -4*10=96-40=56 → -3*56= -168

Then, +1 * determinant of:
|12 4|
|10 1| → 12*1 -4*10=12-40= -28 → 1*(-28)= -28

So Dx = 224 -168 -28 = 28. Wait, 224-168=56; 56-28=28. So Dx=28.

Then x = Dx/D = 28 / (-28) = -1.

Wait, that's x. Hmm, that's different from the options, but let's continue.

Next, Dy: replace the y column with the constants.

Dy matrix:

|2   8   1|
|4  12   4|
|1  10   8|

Compute determinant Dy.

Expanding along the first row:

2 * determinant of minor:
|12 4|
|10 8| → 12*8 -4*10=96-40=56 → 2*56=112

Then, -8 * determinant of:
|4  4|
|1  8| → 4*8 -4*1=32-4=28 → -8*28= -224

Then, +1 * determinant of:
|4 12|
|1 10| →4*10 -12*1=40-12=28 →1*28=28

So Dy = 112 -224 +28 = (112+28)=140 →140-224= -84.

So Dy = -84.

Then y = Dy/D = (-84)/(-28) =3.

Next, Dz: replace the third column with the constants.

Dz matrix:

|2  3  8|
|4 4 12|
|1 1 10|

Compute determinant Dz.

Expanding along first row:

2 * determinant of:
|4 12|
|1 10| → 4*10 -12*1=40-12=28 → 2*28=56

-3 * determinant of:
|4 12|
|1 10| → same as above, 28. So -3*28= -84.

+8 * determinant of:
|4 4|
|1 1| →4*1 -4*1=0 →8*0=0

So Dz =56 -84 +0= -28.

z = Dz/D = (-28)/(-28) =1.

Wait, so x=-1, y=3, z=1.

Looking at the options, the options are presented as [x,y,z].

Looking at the options:

Option D: [-1,3,1]

Yes, that's our solution. So the answer should be D.

To solve the system of equations using Cramer's rule, we start by writing the coefficient matrix \( D \) and the constants vector:

\[
\text{Equations:}
\begin{cases}
2x + 3y + z = 8 \\
4x + 4y + 4z = 12 \\
x + y + 8z = 10
\end{cases}
\]

Coefficient matrix:
\[
D = \begin{vmatrix}
2 & 3 & 1 \\
4 & 4 & 4 \\
1 & 1 & 8
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Compute \( \det(D) \):
\[
\det(D) = 2(4 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 1) - 3(4 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 1) + 1(4 \cdot 1 - 4 \cdot 1)
\]
\[
\det(D) = 2(32 - 4) - 3(32 - 4) + 1(4 - 4) = 2(28) - 3(28) + 1(0) = 56 - 84 + 0 = -28
\]

Next, compute \( D_x \), \( D_y \), and \( D_z \) by replacing the respective columns of \( D \) with the constants vector \([8, 12, 10]\):

1. \( D_x \):
\[
D_x = \begin{vmatrix}
8 & 3 & 1 \\
12 & 4 & 4 \\
10 & 1 & 8
\end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
\det(D_x) = 8(4 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 1) - 3(12 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 10) + 1(12 \cdot 1 - 4 \cdot 10)
\]
\[
\det(D_x) = 8(32 - 4) - 3(96 - 40) + 1(12 - 40) = 8(28) - 3(56) + 1(-28) = 224 - 168 - 28 = 28
\]

2. \( D_y \):
\[
D_y = \begin{vmatrix}
2 & 8 & 1 \\
4 & 12 & 4 \\
1 & 10 & 8
\end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
\det(D_y) = 2(12 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 10) - 8(4 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 1) + 1(4 \cdot 10 - 12 \cdot 1)
\]
\[
\det(D_y) = 2(96 - 40) - 8(32 - 4) + 1(40 - 12) = 2(56) - 8(28) + 1(28) = 112 - 224 + 28 = -84
\]

3. \( D_z \):
\[
D_z = \begin{vmatrix}
2 & 3 & 8 \\
4 & 4 & 12 \\
1 & 1 & 10
\end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
\det(D_z) = 2(4 \cdot 10 - 12 \cdot 1) - 3(4 \cdot 10 - 12 \cdot 1) + 8(4 \cdot 1 - 4 \cdot 1)
\]
\[
\det(D_z) = 2(40 - 12) - 3(40 - 12) + 8(4 - 4) = 2(28) - 3(28) + 8(0) = 56 - 84 + 0 = -28
\]

Finally, solve for \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \):
\[
x = \frac{\det(D_x)}{\det(D)} = \frac{28}{-28} = -1, \quad
y = \frac{\det(D_y)}{\det(D)} = \frac{-84}{-28} = 3, \quad
z = \frac{\det(D_z)}{\det(D)} = \frac{-28}{-28} = 1
\]

The solution is \( [x, y, z] = [-1, 3, 1] \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: [-1, 3, 1]**
