Question:

When air is let out of an automobile tire, the air feels cold to the touch. Explain why you feel this cooling sensation.

Options:

A: The air feels cold because it mixes with colder atmospheric air
B: The air feels cold due to a chemical reaction within the tire
C: The air temperature falls because it is doing work and expending energy
D: The cooling sensation is a result of the air's rapid expansion
E: The cooling sensation is due to the air's humidity
F: The cooling is caused by the evaporation of water on the skin
G: The cooling sensation is due to the air's decreased velocity upon exiting the tire
H: The air feels cold because it is under high pressure
I: The air feels cold because of the tire's insulation properties
J: The air feels cold due to the tire's heat absorption

Okay, so I need to figure out why the air feels cold when it's let out of a car tire. Let me think about this. I remember from science classes that when gases expand, they can get cold. Oh wait, there's something about pressure and volume here.

So, when you let the air out, the tire's air is under high pressure. When that air exits, it goes into the atmosphere where the pressure is much lower. So the air expands rapidly. I think when a gas expands, it does work on the surroundings, right? And doing work requires energy, so the gas itself must lose energy. Since energy is lost, the temperature of the gas should drop. That's why it feels cold.

Wait, but why not other options? Let me look at the choices again. Option A says mixing with colder air, but the air from the tire is what's cooling, not the outside. Option B is a chemical reaction; I don't think any reactions are happening here. Option C mentions doing work and expending energy, which aligns with what I was thinking. Because when the gas expands, it's doing work, so its internal energy decreases, making it cooler.

Option D is about rapid expansion causing cooling. That sounds right too. Oh wait, I think both C and D are related. Because when the gas expands rapidly, it can't exchange heat quickly, so it's an adiabatic process. The work done by the gas (expanding) leads to a drop in temperature.

So which one is correct? The question is about why the cooling sensation occurs. The rapid expansion (D) is the cause, and the work done (C) is the reason for the temperature drop. So maybe either could be correct, but I think the primary reason is the rapid expansion which causes the cooling. So the correct answer should be D.

Another angle: When gas expands, the molecules move apart quickly. They don't have time to gain heat from the surroundings, so their kinetic energy decreases, which means lower temperature. So the cooling is due to the expansion. That makes sense.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between options C and D. Option C says the air temperature falls because it's doing work and expending energy. That's the principle of the first law of thermodynamics, where doing work without heat transfer leads to internal energy change. So if the gas does work (expands), its internal energy (temperature) decreases. So both C and D are correct, but which is the better fit?

Hmm, the question is about why you feel the cooling sensation. The direct cause is the rapid expansion. So the answer is D. Because when the air rapidly expands, its temperature drops, making it feel cool.

The cooling sensation when air is let out of a tire can be explained by the rapid expansion of the air. When the high-pressure air inside the tire exits into the lower-pressure atmosphere, it expands quickly. This rapid expansion causes the gas molecules to move apart without sufficient time to exchange heat with the surroundings, resulting in a drop in temperature. This process aligns with the principle of adiabatic expansion, where the gas does work on the surroundings, leading to a loss of internal energy and a subsequent decrease in temperature.

Among the options provided, while both C (doing work and expending energy) and D (rapid expansion) are related, the more direct explanation for the cooling sensation is the rapid expansion of the air. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: The cooling sensation is a result of the air's rapid expansion.

Answer: D
