Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about balloons leaking gas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is there are two balloons. Both are at the same temperature, same volume, and same porosity. Each is filled to 4 atmospheres. One has 16 kg of oxygen, the other has 1 kg of hydrogen. The oxygen balloon leaks down to half an atmosphere in one hour. I need to find how long it takes for the hydrogen balloon to reach half an atmosphere.

Wait, okay, so both balloons have the same volume and temperature, and same initial pressure. But different masses of gases. But I think the key here is the molar masses and how that affects the rate of leakage.

Wait, Graham's law comes into play here, right? Because Graham's law of effusion deals with the rate at which gases escape through a porous material. The law states that the rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So lighter gases escape faster.

But wait, in this case, both balloons are leaking, but the question is about the time it takes for each to reach a certain pressure. Since porosity is the same, the leakage rate depends on the gas's molar mass.

So first, let's figure out the molar masses. Oxygen is O2, so molar mass is 32 g/mol. Hydrogen is H2, so molar mass is 2 g/mol. So oxygen is 16 times heavier than hydrogen on a molar basis.

Wait, but wait. The initial masses are 16 kg of O2 and 1 kg of H2. Let me think about moles. Moles of O2 would be 16 kg / 0.032 kg/mol (since molar mass is 32 g/mol). Wait, 16 kg is 16000 grams. 16000 /32 = 500 moles of O2. Hydrogen is 1 kg, which is 1000 grams. Molar mass 2 g/mol, so 1000/2 = 500 moles of H2. Oh, interesting! So both have the same number of moles initially. So n is the same for both.

So since the balloons are identical in volume and temperature, the initial pressure is the same because PV = nRT, and n, V, T are same for both, so P is same. So both start at 4 atm.

Now, the oxygen balloon leaks to 0.5 atm in 1 hour. So I need to find how long for hydrogen to reach 0.5 atm.

Wait, but how does the leakage time differ? Because hydrogen is lighter, it should leak faster. So the time taken for hydrogen to drop to 0.5 atm should be less than the time for oxygen. Wait, but wait, the oxygen took 1 hour to go from 4 atm to 0.5 atm. So what's the relationship here.

Wait, perhaps the leakage rate can be modeled using Graham's law. The rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. So the rate for H2 is sqrt(32/2) times faster than O2. Wait, because Graham's law says rate1/rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So since M1 is 32 (O2) and M2 is 2 (H2), rate1 is sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) =4. So the rate for H2 is 4 times the rate of O2.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, the formula is rate1/rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So if M1 is larger, rate1 is smaller. So for O2 (M=32) and H2 (M=2), rate_O2 = rate_H2 * sqrt(2/32) = rate_H2 * sqrt(1/16) = rate_H2 /4. So the rate of O2 leaking is 1/4th that of H2. So H2 leaks four times faster.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the oxygen balloon takes one hour to reach 0.5 atm. So the time for H2 would be less. But how much less?

Wait, but perhaps the time is inversely proportional to the rate. Because if H2 leaks four times faster, then the time taken to reach a certain pressure would be one fourth of the time for O2. So since O2 takes 1 hour, H2 would take 1/4 hour, which is 15 minutes. So the answer would be G:15 min.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of partial pressures and how they change over time. Let me think again.

The rate of gas escaping depends on the pressure and the molar mass. Since both balloons start with the same volume, temperature, and pressure, but different gases, the way their pressures drop over time would depend on their leakage rates.

So the oxygen balloon's pressure drops from 4 atm to 0.5 atm in 1 hour. So that's a pressure ratio of 0.5/4 = 1/8. So it's losing 7/8 of its pressure.

Wait, but pressure isn't directly the quantity that's leaking; it's the number of moles. Because PV = nRT, so n is proportional to P when V and T are constant. So the number of moles decreases as pressure decreases.

So the initial moles are n0. After time t, the moles are n(t) = n0 * (P(t)/P0). Since P0 is 4 atm, and P(t) is 0.5 atm for O2 after 1 hour.

So for O2, n(t) = 500 moles * (0.5/4) = 500 * 1/8 = 62.5 moles remain.

Wait, but the rate of change is given by the effusion rate. The rate of effusion is (dn/dt) proportional to P / sqrt(M). Because from Graham's law, the effusion rate is proportional to pressure and inversely proportional to sqrt(M).

So dn/dt = -k * P / sqrt(M), where k is a constant.

Wait, but since P = nRT/V, and V is constant, dn/dt = -k (n) / sqrt(M). Because P = (n/V) RT, so P is proportional to n.

So dn/dt = - (k / sqrt(M)) * n.

This is a first-order differential equation. The solution is n(t) = n0 * e^(-kt / sqrt(M)).

Wait, but let's verify that. The differential equation is dn/dt = - (k / sqrt(M)) * n. The solution is indeed n(t) = n0 e^{- (k / sqrt(M)) t}.

So for O2, which has M=32, the time t_O2 is 1 hour. At that time, n_O2(t) = 62.5 = 500 e^(-k / sqrt(32) * 1).

Similarly, for H2, we can write n_H2(t) = 500 e^(-k / sqrt(2) * t).

We need to find the time t_H2 when n_H2(t) = 62.5, same as O2's n at 1 hour.

So for O2: 62.5 = 500 e^(-k / sqrt(32) * 1).

Divide both sides by 500: 0.125 = e^(-k / (sqrt(32)) )

Take natural log: ln(0.125) = -k/(sqrt(32)).

So k = - sqrt(32) * ln(0.125).

Compute ln(0.125): 0.125 is 1/8, ln(1/8) = -ln(8) ≈ -2.079.

So k ≈ sqrt(32) * 2.079.

Wait, sqrt(32) is 4 * sqrt(2) ≈5.6568.

So k ≈5.6568 * 2.079 ≈11.78.

Wait, but let's keep it symbolic. Let me write:

k = sqrt(32) * |ln(0.125)|.

Since ln(0.125) is negative, the absolute value makes it positive.

Now for H2, we have n_H2(t) = 62.5 = 500 e^(-k / sqrt(2) * t).

Divide both sides by 500: 0.125 = e^(-k / sqrt(2) * t).

Take ln: ln(0.125) = -k t / sqrt(2).

So, -k t / sqrt(2) = ln(0.125).

Multiply both sides by -1: (k t)/sqrt(2) = -ln(0.125) = ln(8).

So t = (sqrt(2) * ln(8)) / k.

But we already have k from O2's case. Let's substitute k.

k = sqrt(32) * ln(8). Because earlier, ln(0.125) is -ln(8), so |ln(0.125)| is ln(8).

So k = sqrt(32) * ln(8).

So substitute into t:

t = [sqrt(2) * ln(8)] / [sqrt(32) * ln(8)] ) = sqrt(2) / sqrt(32) ) = sqrt(2/(32)) ) = sqrt(1/16) )=1/4.

So t = 1/4 hours, which is 15 minutes.

Wait, that's the same conclusion as before. So the time is 15 minutes, which is option G.

So the answer should be G:15 min.

To solve the problem, we analyze the leakage of gases from two balloons using Graham's law of effusion, which states that the rate of gas leakage is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. The two balloons have the same volume, temperature, and initial pressure (4 atm), but they are filled with different gases: oxygen (O₂) and hydrogen (H₂). The molar masses are 32 g/mol for O₂ and 2 g/mol for H₂, meaning hydrogen leaks 4 times faster than oxygen.

The oxygen balloon leaks from 4 atm to 0.5 atm in 1 hour. Since the pressure is proportional to the number of moles (from the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \)), the pressure ratio \( P/P_0 = 0.5/4 = 1/8 \) corresponds to \( n/n_0 = 1/8 \). This indicates that 1/8 of the gas remains after 1 hour for oxygen.

For hydrogen, which leaks 4 times faster, the time required to reach the same pressure ratio (\( P/P_0 = 1/8 \)) will be inversely proportional to the leakage rate. Since hydrogen leaks 4 times faster, the time will be \( 1/4 \) of the time it takes for oxygen. Thus, the hydrogen balloon will reach 0.5 atm in \( 1/4 \) hour, which is 15 minutes.

The correct answer is **G: 15 min**.
