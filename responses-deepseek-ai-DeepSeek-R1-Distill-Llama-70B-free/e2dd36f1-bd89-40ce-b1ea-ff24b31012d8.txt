Okay, so I have this question here about brain scans and which one would help disprove the statement that most people only use 10% of their brains. Hmm, I remember hearing that this 10% thing is a myth, right? So the question is about finding the right imaging technique to show that people actually use more than 10% of their brain.

First, I need to think about what each of these scans does. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: CAT scan. I think CAT stands for computed axial tomography. It uses X-rays to create detailed images of the inside of the body. But I'm not sure if it's good for showing brain activity. Maybe more for structure than function.

Option B: X-ray. X-rays are good for looking at bones, detecting fractures, or lung issues. But brain tissue is soft, so X-rays aren't really used for detailed brain imaging. They can't show activity either.

Option C: EEG. Electroencephalogram measures electrical activity in the brain. It's often used to detect seizures or monitor activity levels. But does it show which parts of the brain are active? I think it gives a general idea but doesn't provide detailed images of specific areas being used.

Option D: PET scan. Positron Emission Tomography. I remember PET scans use a radioactive tracer to show areas of the brain that are active. So when a part of the brain is using glucose, the PET scan can highlight that area. This sounds useful because it could show multiple areas being active, which would disprove the 10% idea.

Option E: MRI. Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It creates detailed structural images of the brain. It's great for seeing tumors, injuries, or structural abnormalities. But standard MRI is more about structure, not function. There's also functional MRI (fMRI), which I think is a different option here.

Option F: SPECT. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography. It's similar to PET but uses different tracers. It's used to visualize functional processes, like blood flow in the brain. So it can show activity levels in different brain regions. Useful for similar reasons as PET.

Option G: MRA. Magnetic Resonance Angiography. It's a type of MRI focused on the blood vessels and their structure. So it's about the vascular system, not brain activity. Not helpful for this question.

Option H: Ultrasound. Uses sound waves to create images. It's often used on organs like the liver or during pregnancy. For the brain, it's typically used in infants before the bones of the skull harden. Not useful for showing brain activity in adults.

Option I: DTI. Diffusion Tensor Imaging. It's an MRI technique that shows the movement of water molecules in the brain, mapping out nerve tracts and white matter. It's more about structure and connectivity rather than activity.

Option J: fMRI. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It measures changes in blood flow to map brain activity. When an area is active, it uses more oxygen, and fMRI detects the increase in blood flow. So it can show which parts of the brain are active during different tasks.

So the question is which scan would be best to show that most people use more than 10% of their brain. The idea is to show that multiple areas are active, even when someone is doing everyday tasks. So the scans that show functional activity across the brain would be the ones to go for.

EEG measures electrical activity but isn't as detailed in mapping specific areas. PET and SPECT show where blood flow or glucose uptake is happening, indicating activity. fMRI is similar but uses a different method.

Between PET and fMRI: which is more commonly used and provides better evidence? I think fMRI is widely used in research to show brain activity in real-time. It doesn't require radioactive tracers, which might make it more accessible for such studies.

So the best options are probably PET (D), fMRI (J), SPECT (F). Which one would be most effective in disproving the statement?

The statement claims that only 10% is used, implying that 90% is inactive. If a scan shows that various regions are active even when performing simple tasks, that would disprove it.

I think fMRI is the go-to method in modern research for mapping brain activity. It's detailed and can show multiple areas lighting up during different tasks. So using fMRI, you can demonstrate that more than 10% is active.

Alternatively, PET scans have been used historically for similar purposes. But fMRI is more advanced in showing detailed functional areas.

So, the answer is probably J: fMRI.

To determine which brain scan would be most useful in disproving the statement "Most people only use 10 percent of their brains," it is important to evaluate the capabilities of each imaging technique:

- **A: CAT scan** and **B: X-ray** are not suitable for showing brain activity, as they are better for structural imaging or detecting issues like fractures.
- **C: EEG** measures electrical activity but lacks the spatial resolution to map specific brain regions effectively.
- **D: PET scan** uses a radioactive tracer to show active brain areas based on glucose uptake, making it useful for functional imaging.
- **E: MRI** provides detailed structural images but does not directly show brain activity unless paired with functional techniques like fMRI.
- **F: SPECT** is similar to PET, visualizing blood flow to show activity, but it is less commonly used in modern research.
- **G: MRA** focuses on blood vessels and is unrelated to brain activity.
- **H: Ultrasound** is not typically used for adult brain activity imaging.
- **I: DTI** maps white matter tracts and is more about structural connectivity than activity.
- **J: fMRI** measures blood flow changes to map brain activity in real-time, providing detailed and accessible evidence of functional brain regions.

Given that the goal is to show that more than 10% of the brain is active, **fMRI** is the most effective choice due to its ability to provide detailed, real-time functional imaging without the need for radioactive tracers. It is widely used in research to demonstrate that multiple brain regions are active during various tasks, effectively disproving the 10% myth.
