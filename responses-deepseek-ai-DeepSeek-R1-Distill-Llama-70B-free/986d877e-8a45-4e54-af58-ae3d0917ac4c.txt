Question:

Question 13. A buyer sent a signed letter to a seller that stated: "Ship 100 boxes of nails at $3 per box, the price quoted in your circular." The seller mailed the buyer a signed form acknowledgment that agreed to the buyer's terms and stated on the reverse side: "Disputes regarding quality shall be arbitrated." The buyer did not reply to the seller's acknowledgment, and the seller shipped the nails. When the buyer received the nails, it found their quality to be unsatisfactory and sued the seller for breach of warranty. The seller has asked an attorney whether the parties' contract requires arbitration of the buyer's claim. What is the best advice the attorney can provide?

Options:

A: A contract was formed when the buyer received the nails, but the arbitration term is not valid as it was not explicitly agreed upon by the buyer.
B: A contract was formed pursuant to conduct when the buyer received the nails, and a court would exclude the arbitration provision from the contract.
C: A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term must be accepted by the buyer because it was included in the acknowledgment.
D: No contract exists, because the arbitration term in the seller's acknowledgment was a new term that was not in the original agreement.
E: No contract exists, because the arbitration term in the seller's acknowledgment created a counteroffer that the buyer never accepted.
F: A contract was formed when the buyer sent the letter, and the arbitration term is not valid because the buyer didn't agree to it.
G: A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.
H: A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term automatically became part of the contract because the buyer didn't object.
I: A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract. arbitration term became part of the contract.
J: No contract exists, because the buyer didn't respond to the seller's acknowledgment.

Okay, so I have this contracts question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about whether an arbitration clause in a contract is valid when the buyer didn't explicitly agree to it. The scenario involves a buyer sending a signed letter to a seller with specific terms, and the seller responding with an acknowledgment that includes additional terms.

First, I remember that contract formation generally requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. So I need to determine when the contract was formed and whether the arbitration term was part of it.

The buyer sent a letter stating "Ship 100 boxes of nails at $3 per box, the price quoted in your circular." That sounds like an offer because it's a specific proposal. The seller then mailed a signed acknowledgment agreeing to the terms but added on the reverse side a clause about arbitrating disputes over quality.

Wait, so when the seller sends an acknowledgment, is that an acceptance or a counteroffer? In contract law, the general rule is that when an offer is made, the offeree can accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. Here, the seller's acknowledgment agreed to the buyer's terms but added a new term. So, under UCC rules (since this is a sale of goods), the additional terms are treated differently than under common law.

Under UCC ยง 2-207, which deals with merchants and additional terms, if both parties are merchants, additional terms become part of the contract unless they materially alter it, and the offeror doesn't object within a reasonable time. But wait, is the buyer a merchant? The question doesn't specify, but I think for the purpose of this question, we can assume both are merchants since they're dealing with boxes of nails, which seems commercial.

So the buyer's initial letter was the offer. The seller's acknowledgment is the acceptance, but it includes an additional term about arbitration. Since the buyer didn't object, under 2-207(2), the additional term becomes part of the contract unless it's a material alteration. An arbitration clause is generally considered a procedural term and not a material alteration of the contract's substance, so it likely becomes part of the contract.

Now, the contract would have been formed when the seller mailed the acknowledgment, because that's when the acceptance was sent. The buyer didn't respond, but under 2-207, silence can be acceptance of the additional terms if the offeror (buyer) is a merchant. So the contract is formed upon the seller mailing the acknowledgment.

So looking at the options:

Option H says the contract was formed when the seller mailed the acknowledgment and the arbitration term automatically became part because the buyer didn't object. That sounds correct under UCC 2-207.

Option G says a court must decide whether the arbitration term is a material alteration. But I think the arbitration clause isn't material, so it's included, making H the better choice.

Options A and F suggest the arbitration term isn't valid because the buyer didn't agree, but under UCC 2-207, the buyer's silence can mean acceptance if they're a merchant.

Option E says it's a counteroffer, but the seller's response was an acceptance with an additional term, not a counteroffer. So E is incorrect.

So the best answer is H.

The question revolves around contract formation and the validity of an arbitration clause when the buyer did not explicitly agree to it. The buyer sent a signed letter to the seller with specific terms, which constitutes an offer. The seller responded with a signed acknowledgment agreeing to the terms but added an arbitration clause on the reverse side. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) ยง 2-207, when both parties are merchants, additional terms in an acceptance become part of the contract unless they materially alter it, provided the offeror does not object within a reasonable time.

The arbitration clause is a procedural term and not a material alteration of the contract. Since the buyer did not object, silence constitutes acceptance under UCC ยง 2-207. Therefore, the contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract.

Option H correctly reflects this analysis, as it states that the contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment and that the arbitration term automatically became part of the contract because the buyer did not object.
