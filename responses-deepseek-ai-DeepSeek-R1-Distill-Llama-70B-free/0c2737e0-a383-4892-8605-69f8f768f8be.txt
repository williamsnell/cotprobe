Okay, so I've got this question about human rights articles and which ones are not qualified rights. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in human rights law, some rights are absolute and others are qualified. Absolute rights can't be limited under any circumstances, while qualified rights can be restricted if certain conditions are met. So the question is asking which of these articles are not qualified, meaning they are absolute.

Looking at the options: A is Article 19, which I think is about freedom of expression. I recall that this is a qualified right because there are exceptions, like for public safety or preventing crime. So Article 19 is a qualified right, so it's not the answer.

Option B is Article 11, which deals with freedom of assembly and association. I think this is also a qualified right because the state can impose restrictions in the interest of national security or public order. So Article 11 is qualified.

Option C is Article 12, concerning the right to marry and found a family. I believe this one might have some restrictions too, like age requirements or other legal provisions, making it a qualified right.

Option D is Article 9, which is freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. Wait, I think this might be an absolute right. Because the freedom to hold a belief can't really be taken away, though the manifestation of it (like practices) can be limited. Oh wait, no, maybe even Article 9 is qualified because the manifestation can be restricted for public safety, order, etc. So it's a qualified right.

Option E is Article 3, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. I'm pretty sure this is an absolute right. No exceptions, no justifications. So Article 3 is an absolute right, meaning it's not qualified. That could be the answer.

Option F is Article 17, which I think is about the right to property. Yeah, I remember that being a qualified right because the state can interfere for public interest, like eminent domain, under certain conditions.

So the question is which are not qualified, meaning which are absolute. From what I remember, Article 3 (E) is absolute. Are there others?

Wait, checking again: Article 3 is absolute, so it's not qualified. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is which are not qualified. So E is the correct answer because it's an absolute right.

The question asks which of the listed articles are not qualified rights, meaning they are absolute rights. Here's the analysis:

- **Article 19 (A)**: Freedom of expression is a qualified right, as it can be restricted for reasons like public safety or preventing crime.
- **Article 11 (B)**: Freedom of assembly and association is a qualified right, subject to restrictions for national security or public order.
- **Article 12 (C)**: The right to marry and found a family is a qualified right, as it can be subject to legal restrictions like age requirements.
- **Article 9 (D)**: Freedom of thought, conscience, and religion is generally considered a qualified right, as the manifestation of these rights can be limited under certain conditions.
- **Article 3 (E)**: The prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment is an absolute right, with no exceptions or justifications.
- **Article 17 (F)**: The right to property is a qualified right, as it can be interfered with for public interest under specific conditions.

The only article listed that is not a qualified right is **Article 3**, as it is an absolute right. 

Answer: E
