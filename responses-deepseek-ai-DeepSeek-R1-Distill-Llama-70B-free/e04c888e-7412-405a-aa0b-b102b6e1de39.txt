Question:

The geneticist Mary Lyon hypothesized the existence of structures visible just under the nuclear membrane in mammals, which were later named Barr bodies. Which of the following statement is NOT correct about Barr bodies?

Options:

A: In the early female embryo, one copy of the X chromosome becomes inactivated in every body cell.
B: The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated.
C: A male with the XXY genotype will have one Barr body.
D: Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA.

Okay, so I've got this question about Barr bodies and Mary Lyon's hypothesis. Hmm, I remember that Barr bodies are related to X chromosome inactivation. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which statement is NOT correct about Barr bodies. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says, "In the early female embryo, one copy of the X chromosome becomes inactivated in every body cell." Wait, I think Mary Lyon's hypothesis was about X inactivation. Females have two X chromosomes, so in early development, one X in each cell gets inactivated. So this should be correct because that's part of the Lyonization process. So A is a correct statement, meaning it's not the wrong one we're looking for.

Option B states, "The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated." Oh wait, no. I remember that in females, each cell randomly inactivates one of the two X chromosomes. So in some cells, the maternal X is inactive, and in others, the paternal. So it's not the same in every cell. So option B is incorrect. That might be the answer.

Option C says, "A male with the XXY genotype will have one Barr body." Males typically have XY. XXY, like in Klinefelter's syndrome, would have two X's. So each cell would inactivate one X (since males have one X usually), so they should have one Barr body. So C is correct, not the wrong statement.

Option D: "Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA." I recall that methylation is involved in X inactivation. The inactive X is heavily methylated, which leads to the formation of Barr bodies. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is option B because the same chromosome isn't inactivated in every cell; it's random. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The question asks which statement is NOT correct about Barr bodies. Here's an analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: This is correct because, in early female embryos, one X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell, a process known as Lyonization.
- **Option B**: This is incorrect because X inactivation in females is random; different cells inactivate either the maternal or paternal X chromosome, not the same one in every cell.
- **Option C**: This is correct. Males with an XXY genotype (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome) have two X chromosomes, so one Barr body forms due to X inactivation.
- **Option D**: This is correct because Barr bodies are composed of highly methylated DNA, which is part of the inactivation process.

The incorrect statement is **Option B**, as the same chromosome is not inactivated in every cell of a normal female. 

Answer: B
