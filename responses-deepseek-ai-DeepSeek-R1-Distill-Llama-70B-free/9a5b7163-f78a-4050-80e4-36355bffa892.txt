Okay, so I've got this math problem here that asks me to find the value of the infinite series sum from n equals 0 to infinity of (-1)^n divided by (3n + 1). And then I need to round the answer to the thousandths decimal place. The options are given from A to J, each with a specific number. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that series involving (-1)^n are alternating series. The general form is the sum of (-1)^n times a term. In this case, the term is 1/(3n+1). So the series is ∑[(-1)^n / (3n+1)] from n=0 to infinity.

I think about whether this series converges. Since the terms decrease in absolute value and approach zero, the Alternating Series Test tells me that it should converge. But I need the actual value, not just whether it converges.

I'm trying to recall if this series relates to any known functions. Oh, right! I remember that the Taylor series expansion for some functions involve similar terms. Wait, the arctangent function? No, arctan's series is ∑[(-1)^n x^(2n+1)]/(2n+1), which isn't exactly the same. Or maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: the integral of x^(3n) from 0 to 1 is 1/(3n+1). So each term 1/(3n+1) can be written as the integral from 0 to1 of x^{3n} dx. So the series becomes the sum from n=0 to infinity of (-1)^n times the integral of x^{3n} dx. Maybe I can interchange the sum and the integral.

So let me write S = sum_{n=0}^\infty [ (-1)^n / (3n+1) ] = sum_{n=0}^\infty [ (-1)^n ∫_0^1 x^{3n} dx ].

If I can interchange the sum and the integral, then S becomes ∫_0^1 sum_{n=0}^\infty [ (-x^3)^n ] dx. Because x^{3n} is (x^3)^n, so each term is (x^3)^n multiplied by (-1)^n, which is (-x^3)^n.

Now, the sum inside the integral is a geometric series. The sum of r^n from n=0 to infinity is 1/(1 - r) when |r| < 1. Here, r is (-x^3), so as long as |x^3| < 1, which it is for x in [0,1), the sum converges. So the sum becomes 1/(1 - (-x^3)) = 1/(1 + x^3).

Wait, but at x=1, x^3=1, so 1 + x^3=2, so the sum would be 1/2 there, but the integral is over x from 0 to 1, including 1, so the integrand is 1/(1 + x^3) for x in [0,1].

So now S is the integral from 0 to1 of 1/(1 + x^3) dx. Hmm, okay, that's a better way to compute it. Now I need to compute this integral.

The integral of 1/(1 + x^3) dx. Let me think about how to integrate this. 1 + x^3 can be factored as (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1). So partial fractions would work here.

So I can write 1/(1 + x^3) = A/(x + 1) + (Bx + C)/(x^2 - x + 1). Let me find A, B, and C.

Multiplying both sides by (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1), I get:

1 = A(x^2 -x +1) + (Bx + C)(x + 1).

Let me expand the right side:

A x^2 - A x + A + Bx(x) + Bx(1) + C x + C(1)
= A x^2 - A x + A + B x^2 + Bx + Cx + C.

Combine like terms:

(A + B) x^2 + (-A + B + C) x + (A + C).

Set equal to 1, which is 0 x^2 + 0 x + 1. So we have the system:

A + B = 0,
-A + B + C = 0,
A + C = 1.

Let me solve this. From the first equation, B = -A. Substitute into the second equation: -A + (-A) + C = 0 => -2A + C = 0 => C = 2A.

From the third equation, A + C = 1. Substitute C=2A: A + 2A = 1 => 3A=1 => A=1/3.

So then B = -1/3, and C = 2*(1/3) = 2/3.

Therefore, the partial fractions decomposition is:

1/(1 + x^3) = (1/3)/(x + 1) + [ (-1/3 x + 2/3 ) ]/(x^2 - x + 1).

Simplify the numerator in the second term: (-x + 2)/3.

So now the integral becomes:

∫ [ (1/3)/(x + 1) + ( (-x + 2)/3 )/(x^2 - x + 1) ] dx from 0 to 1.

Let me split this into two integrals:

(1/3) ∫ [1/(x + 1)] dx + (1/3) ∫ [ (-x + 2)/(x^2 - x + 1) ] dx.

First integral is straightforward. The integral of 1/(x+1) dx is ln|x+1|. Evaluated from 0 to 1 gives (1/3)[ln(2) - ln(1)] = (1/3) ln 2.

The second integral is more involved. Let me write it as (1/3) ∫ [ (-x + 2) / (x^2 - x +1) ] dx.

Let me split the numerator into two terms: (-x)/(x^2 -x +1) and 2/(x^2 -x +1). So the integral becomes:

(1/3) [ ∫ (-x)/(x^2 -x +1) dx + 2 ∫ 1/(x^2 - x +1) dx ].

Let me handle each part separately. First part: ∫ (-x)/(x^2 -x +1) dx.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = x^2 - x +1. Then du/dx = 2x -1. Hmm, but the numerator is -x dx. Let me see if I can write -x dx in terms of du.

Wait, let me see. Since du = (2x -1) dx, maybe I can manipulate this. Let me try to express -x as a combination of (2x -1) and a constant.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me complete the derivative of the denominator.

The denominator is x^2 - x +1. Its derivative is 2x -1. Let me see if I can write the numerator in terms of this derivative.

The numerator is -x. Let me write it as A*(2x -1) + B.

So, -x = A*(2x -1) + B.

Expanding: 2A x - A + B.

Comparing coefficients:

2A = -1 → A = -1/2.

Then, for the constants: -A + B = 0 → (1/2) + B = 0 → B = -1/2.

So, -x = (-1/2)(2x -1) - 1/2.

Therefore, ∫ (-x)/(x^2 -x +1) dx = ∫ [ (-1/2)(2x -1) - 1/2 ] / (x^2 -x +1) dx.

Split into two integrals:

= (-1/2) ∫ (2x -1)/(x^2 -x +1) dx - (1/2) ∫ 1/(x^2 -x +1) dx.

The first integral is (-1/2) ∫ du/u, where u = x^2 -x +1, so that's (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

The second integral is -(1/2) times ∫1/(x^2 -x +1) dx.

Now, ∫1/(x^2 -x +1) dx can be computed by completing the square. The denominator is x^2 -x +1 = (x - 1/2)^2 + (3/4). So the integral becomes ∫1/[(x - 1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] dx, which is (2/sqrt(3)) arctan( (x - 1/2)/(sqrt(3)/2) ) ) + C.

So putting it all together:

∫ (-x)/(x^2 -x +1) dx = (-1/2) ln|x^2 -x +1| - (1/2) * [ (2/sqrt(3)) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) ) ] + C.

Simplify:

= (-1/(2)) ln(x^2 -x +1) - (1/sqrt(3)) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) + C.

Now, going back to the second integral:

The second term in the second integral is 2 ∫ 1/(x^2 -x +1) dx, which from above is 2*(2/sqrt(3)) arctan(...) + C, but wait let me make sure.

Wait, no, the second integral in the second part is just ∫1/(x^2 -x +1) dx, which is (2/sqrt(3)) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) + C. So when multiplied by 2, it's (4/sqrt(3)) arctan(...).

Wait, let me clarify. The second integral in the second part is 2 ∫1/(x^2 -x +1) dx. So that would be 2*(2/sqrt(3)) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) + C. So 4/sqrt(3) times arctan(...).

Putting it all together, the integral of [ (-x + 2)/(x^2 -x +1) ] dx is:

[ (-1/2) ln(x^2 -x +1) - (1/sqrt(3)) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) ] + [ 4/sqrt(3) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) ] + C.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me retrace.

Wait, the second integral after substitution is:

(1/3) [ ∫ (-x)/(x^2 -x +1) dx + 2 ∫ 1/(x^2 -x +1) dx ].

We found that ∫ (-x)/(x^2 -x +1) dx is (-1/2) ln(x^2 -x +1) - (1/sqrt(3)) arctan(...) + C.

So when we plug that in, we have:

(1/3) [ (-1/2) ln(x^2 -x +1) - (1/sqrt(3)) arctan(...)  + 2*(2/sqrt(3)) arctan(...) ] evaluated from 0 to1.

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

Let me compute the two parts:

First part: ∫ (-x)/(x^2 -x +1) dx = (-1/2) ln(x^2 -x +1) - (1/sqrt(3)) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) + C.

Second part: 2 ∫1/(x^2 -x +1) dx = 2*(2/sqrt(3)) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) + C = (4/sqrt(3)) arctan(...) + C.

So combining these two, the entire expression is:

[ (-1/2) ln(x^2 -x +1) - (1/sqrt(3)) arctan(...) + (4/sqrt(3)) arctan(...) ].

Simplify the arctan terms: (-1 +4)/sqrt(3) arctan(...) = 3/sqrt(3) arctan(...) = sqrt(3) arctan(...).

Wait, wait:

- (1/sqrt(3)) arctan(...) + 4/sqrt(3) arctan(...) = (3/sqrt(3)) arctan(...) = sqrt(3) arctan(...).

So the integral becomes:

(-1/2) ln(x^2 -x +1) + sqrt(3) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) + C.

Now, putting everything back into the main integral S:

S = (1/3) [ ∫1/(x+1) dx ] from 0 to1 + (1/3) [ ∫ (-x +2)/(x^2 -x +1) dx ] from 0 to1.

Which is:

(1/3) [ ln(x+1) ] from 0 to1 + (1/3) [ (-1/2) ln(x^2 -x +1) + sqrt(3) arctan( (2x -1)/sqrt(3) ) ] from 0 to1.

Compute each part separately.

First part: (1/3)( ln(2) - ln(1) ) = (1/3) ln 2.

Second part: (1/3) evaluated from 0 to1:

At x=1:

- (1/2) ln(1^2 -1 +1) = - (1/2) ln(1) = 0.

sqrt(3) arctan( (2*1 -1)/sqrt(3) ) = sqrt(3) arctan(1/sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3) * (pi/6) because arctan(1/sqrt(3)) is pi/6 radians.

At x=0:

- (1/2) ln(0^2 -0 +1) = - (1/2) ln(1) = 0.

sqrt(3) arctan( (2*0 -1)/sqrt(3) ) = sqrt(3) arctan( -1/sqrt(3) ) = sqrt(3) * (-pi/6), since arctan is odd.

So the second part evaluates to:

(1/3) [ (0 + sqrt(3) * (pi/6)) - (0 + sqrt(3) * (-pi/6)) ) ]

= (1/3) [ sqrt(3) pi/6 + sqrt(3) pi/6 ]

= (1/3)( 2 sqrt(3) pi /6 )

= (1/3)( sqrt(3) pi /3 )

= sqrt(3) pi /9.

So putting it all together, S is:

(1/3) ln 2 + sqrt(3) pi /9.

Wait, but let me double-check the signs because when x=0, the arctan term is negative.

Wait, the expression is [sqrt(3) arctan( (2*1 -1)/sqrt(3) ) ] - [sqrt(3) arctan( (2*0 -1)/sqrt(3) ) ]

Which is sqrt(3) * (pi/6) - sqrt(3) * (-pi/6 ) = sqrt(3) (pi/6 + pi/6 ) = sqrt(3) (pi/3 ) = sqrt(3) pi /3.

But then we multiply by (1/3), so (1/3) * sqrt(3) pi /3 = sqrt(3) pi /9, which matches what I had before.

So the total sum S is (ln 2)/3 + (sqrt(3) pi)/9.

Wait, let me compute this numerically.

Compute each term:

ln 2 is approximately 0.69314718056.

So (ln 2)/3 ≈ 0.69314718056 /3 ≈ 0.23104906.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205080757.

pi is approximately 3.141592653589793.

So (sqrt(3) pi)/9 = (1.73205080757 * 3.141592653589793) /9.

First compute numerator: 1.73205 * 3.14159 ≈ 5.4414.

Wait, more accurately:

1.73205080757 *3.141592653589793:

1.73205080757 *3 =5.19615242271,

1.73205080757 *0.141592653589793 ≈ 0.245025.

So total approx 5.19615242271 + 0.245025 ≈5.441177.

So 5.441177 divided by 9 is approximately 0.604575.

So adding the two terms:

0.23104906 + 0.604575 ≈ 0.835624.

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, 0.23104906 + 0.604575 is 0.835624.

But looking at the options, option F is 0.8356488482647211, which is very close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made an approximation error.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute each term with higher precision.

Compute (ln2)/3:

ln(2) ≈0.6931471805599453.

0.6931471805599453 /3 =0.23104906018664843.

Next, (sqrt(3)*pi)/9:

sqrt(3) ≈1.7320508075688772.

pi≈3.141592653589793.

Multiply: 1.7320508075688772 *3.141592653589793 = ?

Let me compute this:

1.7320508075688772 *3 =5.196152422706632,

1.7320508075688772
