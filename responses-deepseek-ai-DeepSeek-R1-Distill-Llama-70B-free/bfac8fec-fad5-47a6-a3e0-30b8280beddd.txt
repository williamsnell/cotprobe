Okay, so I have this question about whether (C[0,1], ||·||₁) is a Banach space. Hmm, I remember that a Banach space is a complete normed vector space. So I need to check if this space is complete under the given norm.

First, let's recall what C[0,1] is. It's the space of all continuous functions on the interval [0,1]. That makes sense. The norm is given by ||f||₁ = integral from 0 to 1 of |f(t)| dt. So this is the L¹ norm, right? Or wait, no, in L¹ spaces, we usually consider measurable functions, not just continuous. But here, it's the space of continuous functions with this L¹-type norm.

Wait, so a Banach space needs every Cauchy sequence to converge within the space. So the question is: is this space complete under this norm?

I think I remember something about different norms on function spaces. For example, C[0,1] with the sup norm is a Banach space because it's complete. But does that hold with this L¹ norm?

Wait, no. The L¹ norm is different. I think that in the space of continuous functions, the L¹ norm might not make it complete. Because if you take a Cauchy sequence in (C[0,1], ||·||₁), does it necessarily converge to a continuous function?

Let me think about that. Suppose I have a sequence of continuous functions {f_n} that is Cauchy in the L¹ norm. That means for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for all m,n > N, the integral of |f_m(t) - f_n(t)| dt < ε.

But does that imply that {f_n} converges uniformly? Because uniform convergence would guarantee that the limit is continuous. But L¹ convergence doesn't necessarily imply pointwise convergence, or uniform convergence.

Wait, another approach: maybe to find a Cauchy sequence in C[0,1] under ||·||₁ that doesn't converge in C[0,1]. Because if such a sequence exists, then the space isn't complete.

I think I recall an example where functions approximate a Dirac delta or something similar. Like, considering a sequence of functions that become very peaked, but their integrals (like L¹ norm) stay bounded. But wait, in C[0,1], functions are continuous, so they can't have a Dirac delta, but you can have functions that spike more and more, with the area under the curve staying constant.

Wait, but if the functions are continuous, maybe you can construct a sequence where each f_n is continuous, has integral 1 (so ||f_n||₁ =1), but as n increases, the "spike" becomes sharper, approaching a delta function. But wait, the delta function isn't in C[0,1], because it's not continuous.

So if the sequence {f_n} is Cauchy in L¹, but the limit isn't in C[0,1], then the space isn't complete. Therefore, (C[0,1], ||·||₁) isn't a Banach space.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think of a specific example. Let's define f_n(t) as a function that's 0 except near t=0, where it rises linearly to n at t=1/(2n), and then drops back down to 0 at t=1/n. The integral of this function would be the area of the triangle, which is (base * height)/2. Base is 1/n, height is n, so area is (1/n * n)/2 = 1/2. So each f_n has ||f_n||₁ = 1/2.

Now, as n increases, the spike becomes taller and narrower. The pointwise limit of f_n(t) is zero for t > 0, and undefined at t=0 (since it's a spike there). But the pointwise limit isn't continuous. So the sequence {f_n} is in C[0,1], but does it converge in ||·||₁?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check: is this sequence Cauchy? What's the integral of |f_m(t) - f_n(t)| dt for m ≠ n?

Hmm, for large m and n, the supports of f_m and f_n are disjoint except maybe near zero. So the integral of their difference would be the sum of their individual areas, since they don't overlap. Each has area 1/2, so the integral would be 1. So the difference between f_m and f_n is 1 in the L¹ norm. That means the sequence isn't Cauchy, so it doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I should pick a different kind of sequence. Let's think of functions that approximate the same function in L¹, but perhaps their limit isn't continuous.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the L¹ norm is not strong enough to ensure uniform convergence, which is needed for the limit to be continuous.

Wait, but in C[0,1], convergence in the sup norm implies convergence in L¹, but the reverse isn't true. So if a sequence converges in L¹, it doesn't necessarily converge in the sup norm, so the limit might not be continuous.

Wait, but the completeness would require that any Cauchy sequence in the L¹ norm converges to a function in C[0,1]. So if such a sequence converges in L¹ to a function that is not continuous, then the space isn't complete.

So, to make (C[0,1], ||·||₁) a Banach space, it must be that all Cauchy sequences in this norm converge to a function in C[0,1]. If that's not the case, then it's not a Banach space.

I think that in this case, the space is not complete. Because you can have a Cauchy sequence in the L¹ norm on continuous functions that converges to a function that's not continuous. For example, functions that approximate a discontinuity.

Wait, but the limit in L¹ is defined as being equal almost everywhere to some measurable function. But in C[0,1], the functions are continuous, so if the limit function isn't continuous, it's not in C[0,1]. So if a Cauchy sequence in C[0,1] under L¹ norm approaches a discontinuous function, then the limit isn't in C[0,1], meaning the space isn't complete.

So, (C[0,1], ||·||₁) isn't a Banach space.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up different function spaces. Let me think about the definitions again.

The space C[0,1] under the sup norm is a Banach space because it's complete. But under the L¹ norm, which is different, it's not necessarily complete.

Wait, but L¹[0,1] is a Banach space because it's complete. However, C[0,1] with the L¹ norm is a subspace of L¹[0,1]. But not every subspace is complete. For example, if the subspace isn't closed, then it's not complete. Because in a complete space, closed subspaces are complete.

Wait, but C[0,1] is dense in L¹[0,1], right? So the closure of C[0,1] in L¹ is L¹ itself. Therefore, C[0,1] with the L¹ norm isn't a closed subspace. So it's not complete because you can have Cauchy sequences in C[0,1] that converge to functions not in C[0,1].

So that would mean that (C[0,1], ||·||₁) is not a Banach space.

Thus, the answer should be 0, which is option E.

To determine whether \((C[0,1], \|\cdot\|_1)\) is a Banach space, we need to check if it is complete. A Banach space is a complete normed vector space, meaning every Cauchy sequence must converge within the space.

Here, \(C[0,1]\) is the space of continuous functions on the interval \([0,1]\), and the norm is given by \(\|f\|_1 = \int_0^1 |f(t)| dt\). This norm is the \(L^1\)-norm, typically associated with the space \(L^1[0,1]\), which is complete. However, \(C[0,1]\) with the \(L^1\)-norm is a subspace of \(L^1[0,1]\), and not all subspaces are complete. For a subspace to be complete, it must be closed.

The key issue is whether every Cauchy sequence in \((C[0,1], \|\cdot\|_1)\) converges to a function in \(C[0,1]\). If a Cauchy sequence converges in the \(L^1\)-norm to a function that is not continuous, then the limit is not in \(C[0,1]\), and the space is not complete. For example, consider a sequence of continuous functions that approximate a discontinuity or a Dirac delta-like spike. Such sequences can be Cauchy in the \(L^1\)-norm but converge to a function that is not continuous, and thus not in \(C[0,1]\).

Additionally, \(C[0,1]\) is dense in \(L^1[0,1]\), meaning the closure of \(C[0,1]\) in the \(L^1\)-norm is \(L^1[0,1]\). Therefore, \(C[0,1]\) is not a closed subspace of \(L^1[0,1]\), and hence it is not complete under the \(L^1\)-norm.

In conclusion, \((C[0,1], \|\cdot\|_1)\) is not a Banach space because it is not complete. The answer is **0**.
