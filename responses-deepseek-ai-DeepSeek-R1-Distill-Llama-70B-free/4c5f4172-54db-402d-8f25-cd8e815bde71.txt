Okay, so I need to figure out how planetary rings are made. I remember that rings are those beautiful structures we see around planets like Saturn. But wait, how do they form in the first place?

I think back to what I learned in astronomy. Planetary rings are made of small particles, right? Like ice and rock particles. They orbit around the planet. But where do these particles come from?

Option A says they form from accretion within the solar nebula when the planets formed. That makes me think about the early solar system. The solar nebula was this cloud of gas and dust that formed the Sun and the planets. Accretion is when particles stick together to form larger bodies. But wait, if the rings formed at the same time as the planets, wouldn't the material have either accreted into the planet or into moons? Maybe the rings we see now aren't that old. I think Saturn's rings are thought to be relatively young, so maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B suggests fragments from planets ejected by impacts. Like when a moon or another planetoid collides, it breaks apart and the pieces become rings. That sounds possible. For example, the Moon was formed from debris after a collision with Earth. But do planetary rings come from such events? I'm not so sure. I recall that some moons are thought to have formed from such debris, but rings might have different origins.

Option C is dust from passing comets. Comets do shed dust as they approach the Sun. If a comet passes close to a planet, maybe some of that dust gets trapped by the planet's gravity. That could contribute to rings, but is that the main way they form? I'm not certain. It feels like a minor contributor rather than the primary source.

Option D is remnants of a planet's atmosphere. That doesn't sound right. Planetary rings are in orbit, so if the atmosphere was lost, it would either escape into space or maybe form an ring if the planet's gravity held it, but I don't think atmospheres directly form rings. Plus, atmospheric particles are usually gas, not the icy particles we see in rings.

Option E is gravitational pull from nearby planets. Like, if another planet's gravity affects the particles. But I don't think that's how rings form. Gravity from other planets can influence orbits, but the rings are more about the planet's own gravity holding onto the material. So E might not be the right choice.

Option F is dismantling of small moons by impacts. Oh, this rings a bell. I remember reading that Saturn's rings might be the result of a moon being destroyed or broken apart. If a moon gets too close to the planet, the tidal forces can rip it apart. Also, meteoroid impacts could break a moon into pieces that then orbit as rings. That makes sense. The material would be confined within the planet's Roche limit, where the tidal forces prevent it from accreting into a new moon. So F seems plausible.

Option G is fusion of space dust and meteorites. Fusion implies melting and combining, but the particles in rings are usually small and separate. They don't fuse together because the ring system is in a vacuum, and without enough gravity to pull them together. So G doesn't seem right.

Putting it all together, the most likely answer is F: From the dismantling of small moons by impacts. Because when a moon is torn apart, the debris ends up orbiting the planet, forming rings. This explains the composition and the way the rings stay in orbit without clumping together into a new moon.

Planetary rings are composed of small particles like ice and rock that orbit a planet. Their origin is tied to the destruction of moons or other objects within the planet's gravitational influence. When a moon is destroyed by impacts or torn apart by tidal forces, the resulting debris becomes trapped in orbit, forming the rings. This process explains why the particles remain suspended without accreting into a new moon, as they are held within the planet's Roche limit. 

The dismantling of small moons by impacts is the most plausible explanation for the formation of planetary rings.
