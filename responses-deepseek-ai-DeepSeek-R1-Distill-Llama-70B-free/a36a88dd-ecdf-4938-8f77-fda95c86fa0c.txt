Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy change (ΔH°) for three different reactions using the heats of formation provided in a table. Hmm, I remember that ΔH° for a reaction can be found using the formula: ΔH° = Σ ΔH°(products) - Σ ΔH°(reactants). Right, because you subtract the reactants' formation energies from the products'.

Let me look at each reaction one by one. 

Starting with reaction a: 3Fe₂O₃(s) + CO(g) → 2Fe₃O₄(s) + CO₂(g). 

Wait, wait. Fe₂O₃ is one of the reactants, and Fe₃O₄ is a product. So I need to calculate the sum of the heats of formation for the products and subtract the sum of the reactants.

The products are 2 moles of Fe₃O₄ and 1 mole of CO₂. The reactants are 3 moles of Fe₂O₃ and 1 mole of CO.

Looking at the table:
- Fe₂O₃ has ΔH° of 197 kcal/mol.
- Fe₃O₄ is 267 kcal/mol.
- CO is 26.4 kcal/mol.
- CO₂ is 94.1 kcal/mol.

So for reaction a:
Products total = 2*(267) + 1*(94.1) = 534 + 94.1 = 628.1 kcal.
Reactants total = 3*(197) + 1*(26.4) = 591 + 26.4 = 617.4 kcal.
ΔH° = 628.1 - 617.4 = 10.7 kcal. Wait, but the options have that for part a as about 10.7, 10.8, etc. Let me double-check my math.

Wait, 2*267 is 534, right. 534 +94.1 is indeed 628.1. Reactants: 3*197 is 591, plus 26.4 is 617.4. So 628.1 - 617.4 = 10.7. So reaction a gives 10.7 kcal.

Moving to reaction b: Fe₃O₄(s) + CO(g) → 3FeO(s) + CO₂(g).

Products are 3 FeO and 1 CO₂. Reactants are 1 Fe₃O₄ and 1 CO.

Products' total = 3*(63.7) + 94.1 = 191.1 +94.1 = 285.2.
Reactants' total = 267 +26.4 = 293.4.
ΔH° = 285.2 - 293.4 = -8.2 kcal. Wait, but the options are all positive. Oh wait, no, some might be negative. Let me see the options. Looking at the options, option J for part b is 8.2, but as a negative number here. Hmm, wait no. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the formula is products minus reactants. So 285.2 - 293.4 = -8.2. So that would be an exothermic reaction, ΔH° is negative. But looking at the options, for part b, all the options are positive. For example, option J has b) as 8.2. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Oh no, wait, the formula is correct. Products minus reactants. So the ΔH is negative here. So perhaps the way the reactions are written, their ΔH is negative, but in the options, the values are positive. That's odd. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers. 

FeO is 63.7 per mole. So 3 moles is 191.1. CO₂ is 94.1, so sum is 285.2.

Reactants: Fe₃O₄ is 267, CO is 26.4, sum 293.4.

285.2 - 293.4 = -8.2. So that's correct. But looking at the options, for part b, it's 8.2 Kcal. So perhaps in the options, the value is a positive 8.2, but the actual ΔH is -8.2. But the question might be asking for the magnitude, or perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Oh no, no. Because the products are formed from the reactants. So products are on the right. So the formula is [sum of products' ΔH] - [sum of reactants' ΔH]. So if the products have a lower total than the reactants, the ΔH is negative.

But in the options, part b is 8.2 Kcal, which is positive. Hmm, maybe I should consider absolute values, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait another approach: Let me write the formation equations. The standard enthalpy of formation is for each compound from elements in their standard states. So for reaction a, Fe₂O₃ is a reactant, which is being consumed, so its ΔH would be subtracted.

Wait, maybe I should think about each reaction's ΔH as the sum of the products' formation enthalpies minus the sum of the reactants'. Yes, that's correct.

So for reaction b, the products are 3 FeO and CO₂. So their sum is 3*(63.7) +94.1 = 285.2. Reactants are Fe₃O₄ (267) and CO (26.4), sum 293.4. So 285.2 - 293.4 = -8.2.

So the ΔH is -8.2 Kcal. But looking at the options, option J is b) 8.2, which is positive. So perhaps the value is 8.2, but negative, but the options don't have negative signs. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options, all the answers are positive. So maybe I made a mistake, perhaps the reaction is reversed?

Wait, no, the reaction is written as Fe3O4 + CO → 3FeO + CO2. So the products are FeO and CO2. Wait, but is Fe3O4 being broken down into FeO and something else? Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that Fe3O4 is FeO.Fe2O3 or something like that, but no, because the problem gives the formation enthalpy for Fe3O4 as 267, so we have to use that.

Wait, maybe I should proceed to calculate part c and see if that helps.

Reaction c: FeO(s) + CO(g) → Fe(s) + CO₂(g).

Products are Fe and CO₂. Reactants are FeO and CO.

Fe is an element in its standard state, so its ΔH°f is 0. CO₂ is 94.1.

Products sum: 0 +94.1 =94.1.

Reactants sum: 63.7 (FeO) +26.4 (CO) =90.1.

ΔH = 94.1 -90.1 =4.0 Kcal.

So reaction c has ΔH of 4.0 Kcal.

Now, back to reaction b. So ΔH is -8.2 Kcal. But in the options, part b is 8.2 Kcal in option J, but positive. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculations again.

For reaction b:

Products: 3 FeO = 3*63.7 =191.1. CO2 is 94.1. Sum 191.1 +94.1 =285.2.

Reactants: 1 Fe3O4 =267. CO=26.4. Sum 267 +26.4=293.4.

285.2 -293.4 = -8.2.

Hmm, that's correct. So the ΔH is negative. But the options list positive values for part b. So maybe I should think of the absolute value, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the stoichiometry.

Wait, the reaction is Fe3O4 → 3 FeO + something? Wait, no: Fe3O4 + CO → 3FeO + CO2.

Wait, Fe3O4 is FeO·Fe2O3, so maybe it's decomposing. Hmm, but the ΔH calculation is correct as per the given data. So perhaps the ΔH is -8.2, but the options present it as positive 8.2. That's confusing.

But looking at the options, option J is a)10.7, b)8.2, c)4. So our calculations: a)10.7, b)-8.2, c)4.0. So only option J has a)10.7, but b)8.2, which is positive, while our calculation is negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, no, the formula is products minus reactants. For reaction a, it was positive, so correct. Reaction b, negative. But let's see the options.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the sign convention where exothermic reactions are positive. Wait, no, traditionally ΔH is negative for exothermic. So if a reaction releases heat, ΔH is negative.

But the options are all positive. So perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is ΔH° = sum(products) - sum(reactants). So if the products have higher enthalpy than the reactants, the reaction is endothermic, ΔH positive. If lower, exothermic, ΔH negative.

In reaction a: products' sum is higher than reactants', so ΔH positive (10.7 Kcal). That makes sense.

Reaction b: products' sum is lower, so ΔH is negative (-8.2). But the options give positive 8.2 for part b. So that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for reaction b.

Wait, products are 3 FeO and 1 CO2. So their ΔH of formation is 3*(63.7) =191.1, plus 94.1 gives 285.2.

Reactants are 1 Fe3O4 (267) + CO (26.4) → sum 293.4.

285.2 -293.4 = -8.2. So that's correct. So the ΔH is -8.2 Kcal. But the options don't have negative values. So perhaps the problem expects the magnitude, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in how I applied the formula.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is about the reverse reactions. Let me see. For reaction b, if the products are 3 FeO and CO2, and the reactants are Fe3O4 and CO, then the ΔH is -8.2. But perhaps in the options, it's the absolute value, so 8.2 Kcal. That would make option J's part b as 8.2.

So, putting it all together:

a)10.7 Kcal.

b) -8.2 Kcal, but options have 8.2, so perhaps the answer takes the magnitude.

c)4.0 Kcal.

Looking at the options, option J is a)10.7, b)8.2, c)4.0. Which matches our results except for the sign in part b. So perhaps the question is expecting the magnitude, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reverse reaction for part b, which would have ΔH of +8.2. But the reaction given is Fe3O4 + CO → products. So that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I should double-check if I used Fe3O4's ΔH correctly. Yes, 267 for Fe3O4. CO is 26.4. So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the ΔH of Fe3O4 is given as 267, which is correct, but maybe the reaction is considering the decomposition of Fe3O4 into FeO and Fe2O3? Wait, but that's not part of the given data. The given reaction is Fe3O4 + CO → 3 FeO + CO2.

Wait, perhaps I should think of Fe3O4 as a combination of FeO and Fe2O3. Let me see: Fe3O4 = FeO + Fe2O3. But I don't think that's necessary here because we're given the ΔH for Fe3O4 directly.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is correct, and the options have a typo, but I have to choose the best fit. So from our calculations, the values are a)10.7, b)-8.2, c)4.0.

Looking at the options, option J has a)10.7, b)8.2, c)4.0. So except for the sign in b, which in the options is positive. But our calculation says negative. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the magnitude. Let me recheck the question statement. It says, "determine ΔH° for the reactions". So it should include the sign. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should redo reaction b.

Reaction b: Fe3O4 + CO → 3 FeO + CO2.

ΔH = [3*(63.7) +94.1] - [267 +26.4] = [191.1 +94.1] - [293.4] = 285.2 -293.4 = -8.2.

Yes, that's correct. So if the options don't have negative signs, perhaps the intended answer is 8.2, but the correct ΔH is -8.2. Since the options don't have negative values, perhaps the closest is option J, which has 10.7, 8.2, 4.0.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, for reaction a: 3 Fe2O3 (197 each) = 591, CO=26.4 → total 617.4.

Products: 2 Fe3O4 (267 each) =534, CO2=94.1 → total 628.1.

628.1 -617.4=10.7 → correct.

So the only discrepancy is reaction b having a negative value. But the options don't have negative signs. So perhaps the question intended to take the absolute values, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is the other way around, but that would be wrong. Let me think, no, the formula is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to report the magnitude, so the answers would be 10.7, 8.2, 4.0, which is option J. That must be the intended answer.

To determine the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the given reactions, the formula ΔH° = Σ ΔH°(products) - Σ ΔH°(reactants) is applied. The heats of formation provided in the table are used for the calculations.

### Reaction (a):  
**3Fe₂O₃(s) + CO(g) → 2Fe₃O₄(s) + CO₂(g)**  
- **Products:** 2 moles of Fe₃O₄ (2 × 267 = 534 kcal) and 1 mole of CO₂ (94.1 kcal). Total = 534 + 94.1 = 628.1 kcal.  
- **Reactants:** 3 moles of Fe₂O₃ (3 × 197 = 591 kcal) and 1 mole of CO (26.4 kcal). Total = 591 + 26.4 = 617.4 kcal.  
- **ΔH° = 628.1 - 617.4 = 10.7 kcal.**

### Reaction (b):  
**Fe₃O₄(s) + CO(g) → 3FeO(s) + CO₂(g)**  
- **Products:** 3 moles of FeO (3 × 63.7 = 191.1 kcal) and 1 mole of CO₂ (94.1 kcal). Total = 191.1 + 94.1 = 285.2 kcal.  
- **Reactants:** 1 mole of Fe₃O₄ (267 kcal) and 1 mole of CO (26.4 kcal). Total = 267 + 26.4 = 293.4 kcal.  
- **ΔH° = 285.2 - 293.4 = -8.2 kcal.**  
  Although the calculation gives a negative value (-8.2 kcal), the options list a positive value (8.2 kcal). This discrepancy suggests the problem may be asking for the magnitude of ΔH°.

### Reaction (c):  
**FeO(s) + CO(g) → Fe(s) + CO₂(g)**  
- **Products:** 1 mole of Fe (0 kcal, as it is an element in its standard state) and 1 mole of CO₂ (94.1 kcal). Total = 0 + 94.1 = 94.1 kcal.  
- **Reactants:** 1 mole of FeO (63.7 kcal) and 1 mole of CO (26.4 kcal). Total = 63.7 + 26.4 = 90.1 kcal.  
- **ΔH° = 94.1 - 90.1 = 4.0 kcal.**

### Final Results:  
- Reaction (a): ΔH° = 10.7 kcal.  
- Reaction (b): ΔH° = -8.2 kcal (magnitude = 8.2 kcal).  
- Reaction (c): ΔH° = 4.0 kcal.  

The closest match to these results is **Option J: 10.7 kcal, 8.2 kcal, 4.0 kcal.**  

**Answer: J**
