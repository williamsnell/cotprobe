Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry problems can get tricky, but I'll try to take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that 1 ton of TNT produces 4.6 × 10^9 Joules of energy. A chemist wants to get the same amount of energy using acetylene (C₂H₂) and oxygen (O₂). The ΔH° for the reaction is -2510 kJ, which I think is the enthalpy change per mole of reaction. I need to find out how much C₂H₂ and O₂ are needed, and choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I think I need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of acetylene. Acetylene is a hydrocarbon, so it should burn in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. Let's write that out.

The reactants are C₂H₂ and O₂. The products are CO₂ and H₂O. So the unbalanced equation is:

C₂H₂ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

Now, let's balance this. Starting with carbon: there are 2 C on the left, so we need 2 CO₂ on the right. That gives us:

C₂H₂ + O₂ → 2 CO₂ + H₂O

Next, hydrogen: there are 2 H in C₂H₂ and 2 in H₂O, so that's balanced. Now, oxygen. On the right, we have (2 * 2) =4 O from CO₂ and 1 O from H₂O, making 5 O atoms. So on the left, we need (5/2) O₂ molecules. Let me write that:

C₂H₂ + (5/2) O₂ → 2 CO₂ + H₂O

So the balanced equation is 1 C₂H₂ + 2.5 O₂ → 2 CO₂ + H₂O.

Now, the ΔH° is given as -2510 kJ, but I'm not sure per what. Typically, ΔH° is given per mole of reaction as written. So per mole of C₂H₂ reacted, the enthalpy change is -2510 kJ. Since the reaction is exothermic, that's the energy released per mole of acetylene burned.

The total energy needed is 4.6 × 10^9 J. I'll convert that to kJ because the ΔH is in kJ. 1 kJ is 10^3 J, so 4.6e9 J is 4.6e6 kJ (since 4.6e9 /1e3 = 4,600,000 kJ).

Each mole of C₂H₂ releases 2510 kJ. So the number of moles needed is total energy required divided by energy per mole.

Wait, but wait. Oh, right, the reaction releases energy, so the magnitude is 2510 kJ per mole. So n = total_energy / energy_per_mole.

n = 4,600,000 kJ / 2510 kJ/mol ≈ let's calculate that.

Let me compute 4,600,000 / 2510.

Well, 2510 * 1800 = let's see:

2510 * 1000 = 2,510,000.

2510 * 2000 = 5,020,000, which is more than 4.6e6. So 1800 is somewhere in between.

Let me compute 4,600,000 ÷ 2510.

2510 × 1830 = 2510*(1800 +30) = 4,518,000 + 75,300 = 4,593,300.

That's close to 4,600,000. The difference is 4,600,000 -4,593,300 = 6,700.

So 6,700 / 2510 ≈ approx 2.67. So total around 1832.67 moles.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

Compute 4,600,000 ÷ 2510.

Well, 2510 × 1832 = ?

Let me calculate 2510 * 1832.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to divide 4,600,000 by 2510.

Let me write it out:

4,600,000 ÷ 2510 = ?

Well, 2510 × 1000 = 2,510,000.

Subtract that from 4,600,000: we have 2,090,000 left.

2510 × 800 = 2,008,000.

So 1000 + 800 = 1800, and 2,510,000 + 2,008,000 = 4,518,000.

Difference now is 4,600,000 -4,518,000 = 82,000.

Now, 82,000 ÷ 2510 ≈ let's see, 2510 × 32 = 80,320. So 32 more, bringing total to 1832.

Wait, wait, 2510 ×32 = 80,320, which is less than 82,000. The difference is 1,680.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just compute 82000 ÷ 2510 ≈ 32.68.

So total is 1832.68 moles.

So approximately 1832.68 moles of C₂H₂ are needed.

Now, the molar mass of C₂H₂ is (2*12.01) + (2*1.008) = 24.02 + 2.016 = 26.036 g/mol.

So mass of C₂H₂ needed is 1832.68 mol * 26.036 g/mol = let's compute that.

1832.68 * 26.036.

Hmm, let's approximate. 1832 * 26 is about 47,632 grams.

Wait, 1832.68 * 26.036.

Alternatively, 1800 *26.036 = 46,864.8 grams.

32.68 *26.036 = approx 32 *26 = 832, plus 0.68*26≈17.68, so 849.68 grams.

So total is approx 46,864.8 + 849.68 = 47,714.48 grams.

That's 47.714 kg. Convert to tons: 1 ton is 1000 kg, so 0.047714 tons.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that math because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, 1832.68 moles * 26.036 g/mol:

Let me calculate 1832.68 * 26.036.

I'll compute 1832.68 * 26 = ?

1832.68 * 20 = 36,653.6

1832.68 *6 = 10, 996.08

Adding, 36,653.6 +10,996.08 = 47,649.68 g.

Now, 1832.68 * 0.036 = ?

0.036 * 1832.68 = approx 66. (Because 1800*0.036=64.8, 32.68*.036≈1.176, total 65.976.)

So total is 47,649.68 +65.976 ≈ 47,715.656 grams.

So 47,715.656 grams is 47.7157 kg, which is 0.0477157 tons. So approximately 0.0477 tons of C₂H₂.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.0477 tons. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.5044 C₂H₂ and 1.046 O₂.

Option B: 0.2544 C₂H₂ and 0.796 O₂.

Option C: 0.3044 C₂H₂ and 0.846 O₂.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait a second. The ΔH is given as -2510 kJ per mole of reaction. But in the balanced equation, 1 mole of C₂H₂ produces that ΔH. So the calculation I did for moles of C₂H₂ is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass? Let me recalculate.

C₂H₂: Carbon is 12.01, so 2 *12.01 =24.02.

Hydrogen is 1.008, so 2 *1.008=2.016.

Total molar mass is 24.02 + 2.016 =26.036 g/mol. So that's correct.

Then, 1832.68 moles *26.036 g/mol = 47,715.656 grams, which is 47.7157 kg or 0.0477157 tons.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 0.0544 tons, which is a bit higher, or option B:0.2544.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles. Let me recheck that.

Total energy needed: 4.6e9 J =4,600,000 kJ.

ΔH is -2510 kJ per mole of C₂H₂.

So moles = 4,600,000 / 2510.

Let me compute this more accurately.

4,600,000 ÷ 2510.

Compute 2510 * 1830 =?

2510 * 1800 = (2500 *1800) + (10*1800) =4,500,000 +18,000=4,518,000.

Then, 2510 *30 =75,300. So 1830 is 4,518,000 +75,300=4,593,300.

4,600,000 -4,593,300 =6,700.

So 6,700 ÷2510 = approximately 2.669.

So total moles is 1830 +2.669=1832.669.

So that's correct.

So the mass is 1832.669 *26.036 = as computed before, around 47,715.7 grams, which is 0.0477 tons.

But looking at the options, none of the options for C₂H₂ is 0.0477. The closest is option H: 0.1044 tons, which is about twice as much.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the stoichiometry. Let me check the balanced equation again.

Wait, the balanced equation is C₂H₂ + (5/2) O₂ → 2 CO₂ + H₂O. So for every mole of C₂H₂, 2.5 moles of O₂ are required.

Wait, but the question is asking for the mass of each reactant. So I calculated the mass of C₂H₂ correctly, but I also need to compute the mass of O₂.

So, let's compute O₂.

Moles of O₂ needed = 2.5 * moles of C₂H₂.

Which is 2.5 *1832.669 ≈ 4583.17 moles.

Molar mass of O₂ is 32.00 g/mol (since O is 16.00, so 2*16=32).

So mass of O₂ is 4583.17 moles *32 g/mol = let's compute that.

4583 *32 = (4000*32) + (583*32) =128,000 +18,656=146,656 grams.

Wait, 4583.17 *32:

Compute 4583 *32:

4000 *32 =128,000

500*32=16,000 → wait, no, 583 is 500+83.

Wait, wait, 4583.17 *32:

= (4000 *32) + (500*32) + (83.17 *32)

= 128,000 + 16,000 + (83 *32 + 0.17*32)

83 *32: 80*32=2560, 3*32=96 → 2560+96=2656. 0.17*32=5.44.

So 2656 +5.44=2661.44.

So total is 128,000 +16,000=144,000 +2661.44=146,661.44 grams.

So 146,661.44 grams is 146.66144 kg, which is 0.14666 tons.

Wait, but none of the options have O₂ around 0.146 tons. Looking back at the options:

Option A: O₂ 1.046 tons.

Option B: 0.796 tons.

Option C:0.846 tons.

Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar ratio. Because in the balanced equation, 1 mole of C₂H₂ reacts with 2.5 moles of O₂. So the moles of O₂ are 2.5 times that of C₂H₂.

Wait, but the calculation I did for O₂ gives 0.1466 tons, but the options are higher. For instance, option B has O₂ at 0.796 tons, which is about 5 times higher than my calculation.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me go back.

Wait, wait, the ΔH° given is -2510 kJ per mole of reaction. So per mole of C₂H₂, the reaction releases 2510 kJ. So for 4.6e9 J, which is 4,600,000 kJ, the moles of C₂H₂ needed is 4,600,000 /2510 ≈ 1832.67 moles.

Then, the moles of O₂ would be 2.5 *1832.67 ≈4583.17 moles.

Mass of O₂ is 4583.17 *32 g/mol.

Wait, 4583.17 *32 = let me compute it step by step.

4583.17 *30 = 137,495.1

4583.17 *2 =9,166.34

Adding them: 137,495.1 +9,166.34 =146,661.44 grams.

146,661.44 grams is 146.66144 kg → 0.14666144 tons.

Hmm, but this is not matching any of the options provided. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles. Let me recheck.

Wait, the energy required is 4.6e9 J. Since 1 ton TNT is 4.6e9 J, so the energy needed is 4.6e9 J, which is 4,600,000 kJ (since 1 kJ =1e3 J).

So the moles of C₂H₂ is 4,600,000 kJ / 2510 kJ/mol ≈ 1832.67 moles.

But wait, 1832.67 moles of C₂H₂. Let's compute the mass again.

Molar mass of C₂H₂ is 26.036 g/mol.

So mass = 1832.67 *26.036 = let's compute accurately.

1832.67 *26 = ?

1800 *26 =46,800.

32.67 *26: 30*26=780, 2.67*26≈69.42 → 780+69.42=849.42.

So 46,800 +849.42=47,649.42 grams.

Then 1832.67 *0.036 = ?

0.036 *1832.67 ≈ 66. (Exactly, 0.036 *1832.67 = 1832.67 *36e-3 = 66.)

So total mass is 47,649.42 +66 ≈47,715.42 grams → 47.715 kg → 0.047715 tons.

So C₂H₂ needed is approx 0.0477 tons.

O₂ is 0.1466 tons.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 0.0544 tons C₂H₂ and 0.596 tons O₂. Or perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy conversion. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says 1 ton of TNT is 4.6 ×10^9 J. So the chemist needs 4.6e9 J from the reaction.

ΔH is -2510 kJ per mole of C₂H₂, so per mole, the reaction releases 2510 kJ.

So the number of moles needed is 4.6e9 J / (2510 kJ/mol) → but wait, I have to convert J to kJ.

Wait, 4.6e9 J is 4,600,000 kJ. So yes, moles = 4,600,000 /2510 ≈1832.67.

Hmm, but none of the options match 0.0477 tons for C₂H₂. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the ΔH is per mole of reaction as written, but perhaps the stoichiometry uses more moles. Let me think: the balanced equation is 1 C₂H₂ + 2.5 O₂ → products. So the ΔH is for that equation, which is 1 mole of C₂H₂.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ΔH is per mole of O₂? No, that doesn't make sense. Typically, ΔH is per mole of fuel, which is C₂H₂ here.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the molar mass of O₂ correctly. O₂ is 32 g/mol. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the number of moles of O₂. Let me recompute.

Molar ratio is 2.5 moles O₂ per 1 mole C₂H₂.

So moles O₂ = 2.5 * 1832.67 ≈4583.17.

Mass O₂ = 4583.17 *32 = 146,661.44 grams → 146.66144 kg → 0.14666 tons.

Which is approximately 0.1467 tons.

Looking at the options, option B has O₂ at 0.796 tons, which is about 5 times higher. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ΔH is in kJ per mole of O₂? That would change things, but that's unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written with different stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the balanced equation is different. Let me check:

C₂H₂ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
