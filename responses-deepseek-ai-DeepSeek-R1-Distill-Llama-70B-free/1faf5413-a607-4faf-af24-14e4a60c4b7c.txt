Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about retired people's activities. The question asks which option is NOT one of the more frequently named activities by retirees. The options are A through J, each listing a different activity.

Okay, let's start by thinking about what retired people typically do. I remember reading that retirees often have more free time, so they engage in various hobbies and activities they didn't have time for when working. Common activities might include traveling, volunteering, taking up new hobbies, or even part-time work.

Looking at the options:

A: Starting a new business. Hmm, I think some retirees do this, maybe as a way to stay active or pursue a passion they didn't have time for before.

B: Working part-time. That makes sense because some retirees might not be ready to stop working completely and choose to work part-time for income or to stay engaged.

C: Mountain climbing. That seems more like an extreme sport. While some retirees might be into it, I'm not sure how common it is compared to other activities.

D: Household chores. Well, retired people have more time, so they might do more around the house, but is this considered an activity they 'name' as something they do? Or is it just part of daily life?

E: Travel. Definitely a common one. Travel is a popular choice for retirees who want to explore new places.

F: Writing a book. Some might take up writing as a hobby, but I'm not sure how frequent this is compared to others.

G: Redoing the home. Home improvement projects could be a thing, as people have more time to work on their homes.

H: DJing at local clubs. That seems pretty specific and maybe not as common. I mean, it's a fun activity, but I don't think many retirees would pick it up compared to others.

I: Attending educational courses. Yes, many retirees take classes for personal interest or to stay mentally active.

J: Volunteering. Volunteering is quite common among retirees as a way to give back and stay involved in the community.

Now, the question is which is NOT frequently named. So I need to pick the least likely one.

Option C is mountain climbing. It's a physically demanding activity and may not be as common as others. While some retirees are fit and active, it's probably not a top activity. Similarly, H is DJing, which is more of a niche activity.

Comparing C and H, which is less likely. Maybe DJing is more unusual, but I'm not sure. Let me think: Mountain climbing is a specific sport, but maybe some retirees do take it up. DJing at clubs might be more of a younger person's activity, so perhaps less common among retirees.

Wait, but the question is about which is NOT frequently named. So which of these is least likely. Let me consider each option.

Starting a business (A) is plausible. Part-time work (B) is common. Travel (E) is very common. Volunteering (J) is frequent. Educational courses (I) are popular too. Household chores (D) might be a necessary part of life but perhaps not something people highlight as an activity they're engaged in post-retirement.

Wait, the question is about activities they 'name' as things they do. So maybe household chores are just part of daily routine and not something they list as an activity they're involved in. So D: Household chores might be the answer because it's more of a necessity than a chosen activity.

But wait, the options are about what they do, so perhaps D is an activity but not one they highlight as something they're doing in retirement. Alternatively, mountain climbing (C) is less common.

Alternatively, maybe DJing (H) is the least common. I'm a bit torn between C, D, and H.

Let me think again. The question is about the more frequently named activities. So which one is less likely to be mentioned.

I think mountain climbing and DJing are both less common, but which is even less. Maybe DJing is more of a specific, less common activity.

Alternatively, household chores might be something they do, but perhaps it's not something they list as an activity they're engaged in. So D could be the answer.

Wait, the options are: which is NOT one of the more frequently named. So which one is least likely.

Another approach: think about common retirement activities. Travel, part-time work, volunteering, taking classes, starting a business, writing, home projects. Mountain climbing and DJing are less likely. So between C and H.

I think DJing is probably less common. So H might be the correct answer.

Alternatively, if I consider that mountain climbing is a hobby that some retirees take up, perhaps more than DJing. So H is the answer.

Wait, but the options include 'DJing at local clubs' which might be more of a younger person's activity, so perhaps retirees are less likely to do that.

So the answer would be H: DJing at local clubs.

The question asks which activity is NOT one of the more frequently named activities by retirees. To determine this, it's important to consider what retirees commonly do with their free time. Retirees often engage in activities like traveling, volunteering, part-time work, or hobbies such as writing or home improvement. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Starting a new business** is plausible, as some retirees pursue passions or stay active.
- **B: Working part-time** is common for those who want to remain engaged or supplement income.
- **C: Mountain climbing** is a specific, physically demanding activity that may not be as common.
- **D: Household chores** are part of daily life but may not be highlighted as a chosen activity.
- **E: Travel** is a popular choice for retirees.
- **F: Writing a book** is a possible hobby, though less frequent.
- **G: Redoing the home** is a common project for retirees.
- **H: DJing at local clubs** is a niche activity, likely less common among retirees.
- **I: Attending educational courses** is popular for mental engagement.
- **J: Volunteering** is a frequent activity for giving back.

Between **C: Mountain climbing** and **H: DJing at local clubs**, both are less common, but DJing is particularly niche and more associated with younger individuals. Therefore, **H: DJing at local clubs** is the least likely activity to be frequently named by retirees.

Answer: H
