Okay, so I need to figure out how much interest Paul would pay on a $720 loan from April 25 to June 15 with a 5% annual interest rate. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that interest calculations can be a bit tricky, especially when it's not for a full year. The formula I think I should use is the simple interest formula: I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the annual interest rate, and T is the time in years the money is borrowed for.

So the principal here is $720, and the rate is 5%, which I can write as 0.05 in decimal. Now, the key part is figuring out the time period, T. The loan starts on April 25 and ends on June 15. I need to calculate the exact number of days between these two dates.

Let me count the days. April has 30 days, so from April 25 to April 30 is 5 days left in April (including the 25th? Wait, wait. If it's from April 25 to April 30, how many days is that? Let's see: 25th is day 1, 26th day 2, 27th day 3, 28th day4, 29th day5, 30th day6. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. Sometimes when calculating periods, the start and end dates are counted. So from April 25 to April 30: 30 minus 25 is 5, but including both days, so 6 days? Or wait, perhaps it's the number of days the money is borrowed. So if you borrow on the 25th, that day counts as day 1, and the 30th would be day 6. Then May has 31 days, and then from June 1 to June 15 is 15 days. So total days would be 6 (April) + 31 (May) + 15 (June) = 52 days. Wait, but wait, let me recount that.

Wait, April 25 to April 30: that's 6 days (including both the 25th and 30th). Then May has 31 days, and then up to June 15 is 15 days. So 6 + 31 +15 = 52 days total.

Wait, but sometimes in interest calculations, you might use 360 days a year (like in some business contexts) or 365. But I'm not sure which one to use here. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's using the actual number of days, 365, for the calculation.

So T is 52 days divided by 365 days per year. Let me compute that as a decimal. 52 / 365 equals approximately 0.14247 years.

Now, applying the simple interest formula: I = 720 * 0.05 * (52/365). Let me compute this step by step.

First, 720 multiplied by 0.05 is 36. Because 720 * 0.05 is the same as 720 * 5% which is 36.

Then, multiply that by (52/365). So 36 * (52/365). Let me compute 52 divided by 365 first. 52 ÷ 365 is roughly 0.14247.

So 36 * 0.14247. Let me do that multiplication. 36 * 0.14 is 5.04, and 36 * 0.00247 is approximately 0.089. So adding them together, 5.04 + 0.089 = 5.129. So approximately $5.13.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. 52 divided by 365 is exactly (52/365) = 0.142473... So 36 * 0.142473.

Let me compute 36 * 0.1 = 3.6, 36 * 0.04 = 1.44, 36 * 0.002473= approx 0.089.

Adding those: 3.6 +1.44 =5.04, plus 0.089 gives 5.129, so about $5.13.

Looking at the options, E is $5.03, which is close. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the exact days. Let me double-check the days between April 25 and June 15.

April 25 to April 30: that's 6 days (since 30-25=5, but including both the start and end, so 5+1=6 days).

May has 31 days.

June 1 to June 15 is 15 days.

So total days: 6 +31 +15 =52 days.

Wait, another way to think: April 25 to May 25 is 31 days (since May has 31 days). Then from May 25 to June 15 is 21 days (because 25th to end of May is 6 days, but wait no, from May 25 to May 31 is 7 days (including the 25th), and then 15 days in June, so 7+15=22 days. Wait, wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to count each month separately.

April: From the 25th to the end of April: April has 30 days. 30 -25 +1 =6 days? Because including the 25th: 25,26,27,28,29,30: 6 days.

May: 31 days.

June: up to the 15th: 15 days.

So 6 +31 +15 =52 days.

So 52 days is correct.

Another way: Use a date calculator. From April 25 to June 15.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact number of days. Let me think in terms of months.

April: 25th to 30th: 6 days.

May: 1-31: 31 days.

June: 1-15:15 days.

Total:6+31+15=52 days.

So yes, 52 days. So T=52/365.

So the interest is 720 *0.05 * (52/365).

Let me compute that again more precisely.

720 *0.05 is 36.

36 *52 = 1872.

Then 1872 divided by 365. Let me compute that.

365 ×5 is 1825. 1872 -1825=47.

So 5 + (47/365) ≈5.129.

So 5.129 dollars. So approximately $5.13 in interest.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: $5.03, but that's a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, wait another thought: Maybe the end date is June 15, which is the day the loan is paid back, so perhaps the interest is calculated up to but not including that day. So maybe the time period is June 15 minus April 25.

Alternatively, perhaps the days are being counted as 51 instead of 52. Let me recount.

April 25 to April 30: 6 days.

May 1 to May 31:31 days.

June 1 to June 14:14 days.

Wait, that would be 6+31+14=51 days.

Wait, but the loan is taken from April 25 to June 15, so including June 15 as the last day. So perhaps it's 52 days.

Wait, but sometimes in interest calculations, the end date is not counted. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about it.

If I borrow money on April 25, that's day 1. Then each subsequent day adds one. So from April 25 (day 1) to April 30 is 6 days (25,26,27,28,29,30). Then May is 31 days (days 7 to 37). Then June 1 to 15 is 15 days (days 38 to 52). So total 52 days.

So I think 52 is correct.

Wait, but let me try calculating the interest with 52 days.

So 52 days is 52/365 = approx 0.14247.

720 *0.05 =36.

36 *0.14247=5.12852, which is about 5.13 dollars.

Looking at the options, E is $5.03. Hmm, that's 5 dollars and 3 cents. But my calculation gives around 5.13, which is about $5.13. The options don't have 5.13. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the time period is days, but using a 360-day year. Let me try that.

So 52 days /360 days per year = 52/360 ≈ 0.14444.

Then 720 *0.05=36.

36 *0.14444 ≈5.20.

Still, none of the options match that exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is being calculated as (720 * 5%) for the exact number of days, but let me check if I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's not simple interest. Maybe it's compound interest, but the question says 'exact interest' which probably refers to simple interest.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is using months. Let's see: from April 25 to June 15 is a bit less than two months. Let me see how many months that is.

April 25 to May 25 is one month.

May 25 to June 15 is about 21 days, which is 21/30 ≈0.7 months.

So total of 1.7 months. 1.7/12 = 0.1417 years.

So 720 *0.05 *1.7/12 = let's compute that.

720 *0.05=36.

36*(1.7/12)= 36*0.141666...=5.10.

So approximately $5.10.

But still, the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the interest is calculated at a daily rate, using 365 days, but perhaps using exact days.

Wait, another approach: compute the exact number of days between April 25 and June 15.

April 25 to April 30:6 days.

May:31 days.

June:15 days.

Total:6+31+15=52 days.

So 52 days.

So the daily interest rate would be 5% per annum divided by 365 days.

So daily rate is 0.05/365 ≈0.000136986 per day.

Total interest:720 * 0.000136986 *52.

Let me compute that.

First, 0.000136986 *52 ≈0.0071221.

Then 720 *0.0071221 ≈5.1295.

So again, about $5.13.

But the options don't have $5.13. The closest is E: $5.03. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, perhaps I'm including the end date, June 15, which shouldn't be included. So the loan period is from April 25 (inclusive) to June 15 (exclusive). So that would be 51 days.

Let me try that. 51 days.

So T=51/365.

So 720 *0.05=36.

36*(51/365)=?

51/365 is approximately 0.13986.

36 *0.13986=5.035.

So approximately $5.04.

Wait, that's close to $5.03, which is option E. So maybe the correct answer is E: $5.03.

But why the discrepancy in days? Because sometimes in interest calculations, the end date is not counted. For example, if you have a loan from day 1 to day N, you pay interest for N-1 days.

So if the loan is from April 25 to June 15, perhaps it's 51 days.

So 51 days would give us 720 *0.05 * (51/365) = 5.035, which is about $5.04, but the option is $5.03.

Alternatively, perhaps using precise calculation.

Let me compute 51 days.

51/365 = 0.13986 approx.

36 * 0.13986 = 5.035.

So it's approximately $5.04, but the option is $5.03. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is done without approximating the decimals.

Let me compute 51*720*0.05 /365.

Compute 720*0.05=36.

36*51=1836.

1836 /365 = ?

Let me compute that division.

365 ×5=1825.

1836-1825=11.

So 5 + 11/365 =5.030136986...

So approximately $5.03. Ah, that's it! So the exact calculation gives $5.03, which is option E.

So the correct answer must be E: $5.03.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 52 days, but considering that the end date is not counted, it's 51 days, leading to $5.03.

So the answer is E.
</think>

To calculate the exact interest Paul would pay on a $720 loan with an annual interest rate of 5% from April 25 to June 15, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( P = 720 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 0.05 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T \) is the time in years.

### Step 1: Calculate the time period (T)
The loan period is from April 25 to June 15. Breaking it down:
- April 25 to April 30: 6 days,
- May: 31 days,
- June 1 to June 15: 15 days.

Total days = \( 6 + 31 + 15 = 52 \) days.

However, in interest calculations, the end date is often not included. Thus, the loan period is adjusted to 51 days.

### Step 2: Convert days to years
\[
T = \frac{51}{365} \approx 0.13986 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the interest
\[
I = 720 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.13986.
\]

First, calculate \( 720 \cdot 0.05 \):
\[
720 \cdot 0.05 = 36.
\]

Then, multiply by \( 0.13986 \):
\[
36 \cdot 0.13986 \approx 5.035.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the interest is approximately $5.04. However, the exact calculation gives:

\[
\frac{51 \cdot 720 \cdot 0.05}{365} = \frac{1836}{365} \approx 5.030136986.
\]

Thus, the interest is approximately $5.03.

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The closest option to $5.03 is **E: $5.03**.
