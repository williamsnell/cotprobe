Okay, so I have this physics problem here. It's about the sun producing energy by converting hydrogen into helium, and I need to find out how much hydrogen is converted per second. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with nuclear reactions and energy production. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me the masses of _1H^1 (which is a proton, I think) and _2He^4 (which is helium-4). The masses are 1.00813 amu and 4.00386 amu respectively. Wait, but when they fuse, I think four hydrogen nuclei combine to make one helium nucleus. So, the mass of four hydrogens would be 4 * 1.00813 amu, and the helium is 4.00386 amu. So the difference between these must be the mass defect, which is converted into energy via E=mc².

Right, so first I need to calculate the mass defect. Let me do that. 4 * 1.00813 is 4.03252 amu. Subtract the helium mass: 4.00386 amu. So the defect is 4.03252 - 4.00386 = 0.02866 amu. That's the mass lost per helium nucleus formed.

But wait, each helium nucleus comes from four hydrogen nuclei, so the mass converted per helium is that 0.02866 amu. Now, I need to find out how much energy is released per second. Oh, but the problem gives the solar constant, which is the power per unit area at Earth's distance.

Wait, the solar constant is given as 1.35 kW/m². The Earth is 1.5e8 km away, which is 1.5e11 meters. The Sun's energy output is spread out over the surface area of a sphere with radius equal to Earth's orbital radius. So the total power (luminosity) of the Sun would be the solar constant multiplied by the area of that sphere. 

Calculating the area: 4πr². Let me plug in the numbers. r is 1.5e11 m. So r squared is (1.5e11)^2 = 2.25e22 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 * 2.25e22 ≈ 2.827e23 m². Then multiply by the solar constant, which is 1.35e3 W/m² (since 1 kW is 1e3 W). So 2.827e23 * 1.35e3 = let's see... 2.827 * 1.35 is about 3.816. So 3.816e26 Watts, or Joules per second. So that's the Sun's power output.

Now, I need to find out how much mass is converted per second to produce that energy. The energy from each helium nucleus comes from the mass defect. So I'll need to compute the energy per helium nucleus, then find out how many are produced per second.

But wait, the mass defect per reaction is 0.02866 amu. One amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So 0.02866 * 1.66e-27 kg gives the mass per reaction. Then, using E=mc², the energy per reaction would be that mass times c squared. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s, so c² is 9e16 m²/s².

Let me compute that: 0.02866 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu = 4.76e-29 kg. Then, E = 4.76e-29 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 4.284e-12 J per reaction.

Wait, but each reaction produces one helium nucleus, which means the energy per helium is 4.284e-12 J. Now, the Sun's total power is 3.816e26 J/s. So the number of reactions per second is total power divided by energy per reaction.

So number of reactions per second is 3.816e26 / 4.284e-12 ≈ let's see. 3.816e26 / 4.284e-12 = (3.816 / 4.284) * 1e38 ≈ 0.89 * 1e38 ≈ 8.9e37 reactions per second.

Each reaction produces one helium nucleus but consumes four hydrogen nuclei. So the number of hydrogen nuclei consumed per second is 4 * 8.9e37 = 3.56e38 nuclei/s.

But wait, I need to find the mass of hydrogen converted, not the number. So each hydrogen nucleus is 1.00813 amu. Let me convert that to kg. 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so each H is 1.00813 * 1.66e-27 = approx 1.673e-27 kg.

So mass per second is number of H nuclei consumed per second multiplied by the mass per nucleus.

3.56e38 nuclei/s * 1.673e-27 kg/nucleus = 3.56e38 * 1.673e-27 = Let's compute 3.56 * 1.673 first. 3*1.673 is 5.019, 0.56*1.673 is around 0.937, total about 5.956. So 5.956e11 kg/s.

Wait, that's about 5.96e11 kg/s. Looking at the options, option I is 5.89e11, option C is 5.99e11, and F is 5.01e11. Hmm, my approximation might be a bit off. Let me be more precise.

Let me redo the calculation step by step.

1. Calculate the mass defect per helium nucleus:

4 * 1.00813 amu = 4.03252 amu.

Helium mass is 4.00386 amu.

Mass defect = 4.03252 - 4.00386 = 0.02866 amu.

2. Convert 0.02866 amu to kg:

0.02866 amu * (1.66053906660e-27 kg/amu) = 0.02866 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 4.76e-29 kg.

3. Energy per reaction (E) is mc²:

E = 4.76e-29 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 4.76e-29 * 9e16 = 4.284e-12 J.

4. Sun's luminosity (P) is solar constant * area of sphere.

Solar constant S = 1.35e3 W/m².

Area A = 4πr², r =1.5e11 m.

A = 4 * π * (1.5e11)^2 = 4 * 3.1416 * 2.25e22 = 2.8274e23 m².

P = S * A = 1.35e3 * 2.8274e23 = 3.816e26 J/s.

5. Number of reactions per second (N) = P / E per reaction.

N = 3.816e26 / 4.284e-12 = approx 8.9e37 reactions/s.

Each reaction consumes 4 H nuclei, so number of H nuclei = 4 * 8.9e37 = 3.56e38 nuclei/s.

6. Mass of H consumed per second is number of nuclei * mass per H nucleus.

Mass per H = 1.00813 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.673e-27 kg.

So total mass per second = 3.56e38 * 1.673e-27 = (3.56 * 1.673) * 1e11 kg.

3.56 * 1.673: Let's calculate it.

3 * 1.673 = 5.019.

0.56 * 1.673 = 0.937 (since 0.5 *1.673=0.8365, 0.06*1.673≈0.1004, total 0.8365+0.1004=0.9369).

So 5.019 + 0.9369 ≈ 5.9559.

So 5.9559e11 kg/s. Hmm, so about 5.96e11 kg/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.99e11, which is close. But wait, perhaps my approximations are introducing some error. Let me check the exact calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let's recalculate.

Let me redo the mass defect exactly.

Helium mass: 4.00386 amu.

4 H masses: 4 * 1.00813 = 4.03252 amu.

Mass defect: 4.03252 - 4.00386 = 0.02866 amu.

That part seems correct.

0.02866 amu in kg: 0.02866 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Calculate 0.02866 * 1.660539e-27.

0.02866 * 1.660539 = ?

Let me compute 0.02866 * 1.6605.

0.02 * 1.6605 = 0.03321

0.00866 * 1.6605: Let me compute 0.008 * 1.6605 = 0.013284, 0.00066 * 1.6605≈0.00109683. So 0.013284 + 0.00109683 ≈ 0.0143808.

So total is 0.03321 + 0.0143808 ≈ 0.04759, so 0.04759e-27 kg → 4.759e-29 kg.

Then energy per reaction: 4.759e-29 kg * c².

c is 299792458 m/s, but approximate as 3e8 m/s for simplicity.

So c² = 9e16 m²/s².

E = 4.759e-29 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 4.2831e-12 J.

Sun's power P is 1.35e3 W/m² * 4π*(1.5e11 m)^2.

Compute that area: 4 * π * (1.5e11)^2.

1.5e11 squared is 2.25e22. 4 pi is about 12.566. So 12.566 * 2.25e22 = 28.274e22 = 2.8274e23 m².

P = 1.35e3 * 2.8274e23 = 3.816e26 J/s.

Number of reactions per second N = 3.816e26 / 4.2831e-12.

So 3.816e26 / 4.2831e-12 = (3.816 / 4.2831) * 1e38.

3.816 / 4.2831 ≈ 0.8909.

So N ≈ 0.8909e38 = 8.909e37 reactions per second.

Hydrogen nuclei used: 4 * 8.909e37 = 3.5636e38 nuclei/s.

Each H nucleus mass: 1.00813 amu * 1.660539e-27 kg/amu.

Calculate 1.00813 * 1.660539e-27.

1.00813 * 1.660539 ≈ 1.6735, so 1.6735e-27 kg per H nucleus.

Mass per second: 3.5636e38 * 1.6735e-27 kg.

Multiply 3.5636e38 * 1.6735e-27.

3.5636 * 1.6735 ≈ let's compute this:

3 * 1.6735 = 5.0205

0.5636 * 1.6735 ≈ 0.5636 * 1.6 is about 0.9018, and 0.5636 * 0.0735≈ ~0.0414. So total ≈ 0.9018 + 0.0414 = 0.9432.

Adding to 5.0205 gives 5.9637.

So 5.9637e11 kg/s.

So approximately 5.96e11 kg/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 5.99e11 kg, but wait, option I is 5.89e11, which is a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should carry out more precise calculations, especially in the multiplication steps.

Let me compute 3.5636e38 * 1.6735e-27.

3.5636e38 * 1.6735e-27 = (3.5636 * 1.6735) * 1e(38-27) ) = (5.96) * 1e11 kg/s.

Hmm, that's 5.96e11 kg/s. So the closest option is C:5.99e11, but wait, option C is 5.99e11, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of reactions.

Wait, let me double-check the Sun's luminosity calculation.

Solar constant S = 1.35 kW/m² = 1350 W/m².

Area A = 4 * pi * (1.5e11 m)^2.

1.5e11 squared is 2.25e22 m².

4 * pi is about 12.566.

12.566 * 2.25e22 = 28.274e22 m² = 2.8274e23 m².

So P = 1350 W/m² * 2.8274e23 m² = 1350 * 2.8274e23.

Wait, 1350 is 1.35e3, so 1.35e3 * 2.8274e23 = 3.816e26 J/s. That seems right.

Then, energy per reaction is 4.2831e-12 J.

So N = 3.816e26 / 4.2831e-12 = 3.816 / 4.2831 = approx 0.8909 → 8.909e37 reactions/s.

Each reaction uses 4 H, so 3.5636e38 H per second.

Each H is 1.00813 * 1.660539e-27 = let me compute that exactly.

1.00813 * 1.660539e-27.

1.00813 * 1.660539 = ?

Let me compute:

1.00813 * 1.660539.

Break it down:

1 * 1.660539 = 1.660539

0.00813 * 1.660539 ≈ 0.01351.

So total is approximately 1.660539 + 0.01351 = 1.67405.

So each H is 1.67405e-27 kg.

So total mass per second is 3.5636e38 * 1.67405e-27 = ?

3.5636e38 * 1.67405e-27 = (3.5636 * 1.67405) * 1e11.

Compute 3.5636 * 1.67405.

3 * 1.67405 = 5.02215

0.5636 * 1.67405 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *1.67405=0.837025, 0.0636 *1.67405≈0.10647. So 0.837025 + 0.10647≈0.9435.

So total is 5.02215 + 0.9435 = 5.96565.

So about 5.96565e11 kg/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.99e11, which is a bit higher, and option I is 5.89e11, which is lower. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial mass difference calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise numbers for the mass of hydrogen and helium.

The exact mass of _1H^1 is 1.007825 amu, but in the problem it's given as 1.00813. So that's correct.

The mass of _2He^4 is 4.002603 amu, but the problem gives 4.00386. Hmm, that's a bit different. Wait, perhaps I should use the exact numbers given.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the energy per reaction.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the number of reactions. Let me think again. Each reaction converts 4 hydrogens to 1 helium, releasing energy E. So each reaction's energy is E = mc², where m is the mass defect.

So the energy per reaction is (4m_H - m_He) * c².

Wait, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the number of reactions per second more accurately.

N = P / E_reaction.

P = 3.816e26 J/s.

E_reaction = 4.2831e-12 J.

So N = 3.816e26 / 4.2831e-12 = 3.816 /4.2831 = 0.8909e38 = 8.909e37 reactions/s.

Each reaction uses 4 H, so 3.5636e38 H/s.

Each H has a mass of 1.00813 amu = 1.00813 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Which is 1.00813 *1.660539e-27 = 1.6735e-27 kg.

So mass per second is 3.5636e38 * 1.6735e-27 = 5.96e11 kg/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.99e11, which is very close. But perhaps due to more precise calculations, the exact value is 5.96e11, which isn't an option. Let me see the options again.

Options are:

A:4.5e11

B:6.75e11

C:5.99e11

D:5.55e11

E:7.25e11

F:5.01e11

G:7e11

H:6.22e11

I:5.89e11

J:6.5e
