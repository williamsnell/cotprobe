Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the enthalpy change of vaporization (ΔH_vap) for liquid oxygen. Hmm, I remember that when a liquid turns into a gas, it absorbs heat, so ΔH_vap should be positive. 

The problem gives me that oxygen boils at 90.15 K, and at 100 K, the vapor pressure is 2.5 atm. Wait, wait, I think I might be mixing up Clausius-Clapeyron equation here. Oh right, the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). Oh wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Because when P increases, T increases, so if P2 is higher than P1, and assuming we're going from T1 to T2, then T2 is higher than T1.

But wait, in this case, the boiling point is at 90.15 K. So at that temperature, the vapor pressure is 1 atm, right? Because boiling occurs when the vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. So P1 is 1 atm at T1 = 90.15 K. P2 is 2.5 atm at T2 = 100 K. 

So the equation would be ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2). Wait, no, I think I got the order wrong. It should be (1/T1 - 1/T2) multiplied by ΔH_vap/R. So rearranging, ΔH_vap = (ln(P2/P1) * R) / (1/T1 - 1/T2). Or wait, perhaps it's (1/T2 - 1/T1) in the denominator. Let me double-check the equation.

The correct form is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2), so solving for ΔH_vap gives ΔH_vap = [ln(P2/P1) * R] / (1/T1 - 1/T2). 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I see it written as (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2) = ln(P2/P1). So yes, that's correct.

Now plugging in the numbers: P2 is 2.5 atm, P1 is 1 atm. T1 is 90.15 K, T2 is 100 K.

So ln(2.5/1) = ln(2.5) ≈ 0.9163.

R is the gas constant. Wait, which units? Because the answer options are in cal/g-mol. So R is usually 8.314 J/mol·K, but since we're dealing with calories, I need to convert. 1 cal is approximately 4.184 J, so R in cal/(mol·K) is 8.314 / 4.184 ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K). Let me just confirm that: yes, R ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So the denominator is (1/T1 - 1/T2). Let's compute that: 1/90.15 ≈ 0.0111 K^-1, and 1/100 = 0.01 K^-1. So 0.0111 - 0.01 = 0.0011 K^-1.

So now putting it all together:

ΔH_vap = (0.9163 * 1.987) / 0.0011.

Let me calculate the numerator first: 0.9163 * 1.987 ≈ let's see, 0.9 * 2 is 1.8, and 0.0163*2 is ~0.0326, so approximately 1.8326. Wait more accurately: 0.9163 * 1.987.

Let me compute 0.9163 * 1.987:

0.9 * 1.987 = 1.7883
0.0163 * 1.987 ≈ 0.0324
Total ≈ 1.7883 + 0.0324 = 1.8207.

So numerator is approximately 1.8207.

Now divide by 0.0011: 1.8207 / 0.0011 ≈ let's see, 1.8207 / 0.0011 is the same as 1.8207 * (1000/1.1) ) ≈ 1.8207 * 909.09 ≈ Approximately 1658 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have missed a decimal point. Let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.8207 divided by 0.0011: 0.0011 is 1.1e-3.

So 1.8207 / 0.0011 = 1.8207 / (11e-4) ) = (1.8207 * 1e4 ) / 11 = 18207 / 11 ≈ 1656.09 cal/mol.

Hmm, that's approximately 1656 cal/mol, which is close to option G: 1658 cal/g-mol.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check if I used the correct formula. Because sometimes the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is written as ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH_vap/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1), which is the same as what I used, because (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative of (1/T2 -1/T1).

So yes, the calculation is correct.

Wait, but the units: the given options are cal per gram-mole, which matches because R was used in cal/(mol·K), and ΔH_vap is per mole.

So the answer should be approximately 1658, which is option G.

To calculate the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) for liquid oxygen, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

Rearranging for ΔH_vap:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) \cdot R}{\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}}
\]

### Given Data:
- **P₁ = 1 atm**, **T₁ = 90.15 K** (boiling point at 1 atm)
- **P₂ = 2.5 atm**, **T₂ = 100 K**
- **R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K)** (gas constant in cal units)

### Step 1: Calculate \(\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)\)
\[
\ln\left(\frac{2.5}{1}\right) = \ln(2.5) \approx 0.9163
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\)
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{90.15} \approx 0.0111, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.0111 - 0.01 = 0.0011
\]

### Step 3: Calculate ΔH_vap
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{0.9163 \cdot 1.987}{0.0011}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
0.9163 \cdot 1.987 \approx 1.8207
\]

Now divide by 0.0011:
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{1.8207}{0.0011} \approx 1656 \, \text{cal/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated value of ΔH_vap is approximately **1658 cal/g-mol**, which matches option **G**.
