Okay, so I’ve got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Part (a) asks how much heat energy is produced by a 5-kg rock that falls a vertical distance of 10 meters. The rock starts from rest, so I guess I need to calculate the energy it has when it hits the ground and assume all of that goes into heat. Right.

I remember that when an object falls, its potential energy converts into kinetic energy. Oh wait, right, the potential energy at the top is mgh, and when it hits the ground, that potential energy has turned into kinetic energy, which then gets converted into heat (assuming no energy loss elsewhere, which the problem probably implies).

So the formula for potential energy is PE = m * g * h. Where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height. I think g is usually around 9.8 m/s², but sometimes approximated as 10 for simplicity. Let me see what the options use. Wait, the options have various values, so maybe I should use exact numbers.

So m is 5 kg, h is 10 m. So PE is 5 * 9.8 * 10. Let me calculate that. 5 times 9.8 is 49, and times 10 is 490. So the heat energy should be 490 J. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 4.9e2 J directly. Hmm, let me check the options again. Oh, option I is 4.9e2 J, 1.2e-1 K. But wait, part (a) is about heat, which I think is 490 J, so 4.9e2. But some options don't have 4.9e2, so maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses g=10? Let me try that. 5 *10*10 is 500 J. Oh, then that's 5e2. Looking at the options, option A is 5e2, and option I is 4.9e2. So maybe the question expects us to use g=10 instead of 9.8.

Wait, the question doesn't specify g, but in many problems, 10 is used for simplicity. Let me proceed with that. So if g is 10, then PE is 5 *10 *10=500 J. So part (a) is 500 J.

Wait, but wait. When the rock hits the ground, not all the energy might go into heat. Some might be sound or other forms, but the question says to assume that the heat is produced, so I think we just take all the PE as heat.

So part (a) is 500 J, which is 5.0e2 J. But looking at the options, option A is 5.0e2 for (a), and option I is 4.9e2. Wait, maybe I should use the exact value, 9.8. Then it would be 490 J, which is 4.9e2. So let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 5.0e2, 1.2e-1

I: 4.9e2, 1.2e-1.

So if I use 9.8, then (a) is 490 J, which is option I's first part. But then part (b) would use that value.

Now, part (b) says, how much would the temperature of 1 kg of water be raised by that heat energy. The info given is that 4.19e3 J raises 1 kg by 1 K. So the specific heat capacity is 4190 J/kg·K.

The formula is Q = mcΔT, so ΔT = Q/(mc). Here, m is 1 kg, c is 4190 J/kgK.

So for part (b), using the Q from part (a):

If part (a) is 490 J, then ΔT = 490 / 4190 ≈ let's calculate that.

490 divided by 4190. Let me compute that.

4190 is about 4.19e3. So 490 / 4190 = 49 / 419 ≈ 0.117, approximately 0.117 K.

So that's about 1.17e-1 K. Let me see the options. Looking at part (b), the second value in each option.

Option A: 1.2e-1

Option I: 1.2e-1.

Wait, both A and I have 1.2e-1 for (b). But (a) in option A is 5e2, and I is 4.9e2.

So if my (a) is 490 J, then the correct option would be I for (a), and (b) would be 0.117, which is approximately 1.2e-1. So the pair would be (4.9e2, 1.2e-1), which is option I.

But wait, let me check the calculation again. 490 divided by 4190.

Let me compute 490 ÷ 4190.

Well, 4190 is 419 *10. So 490 / (419 *10) = (490/419)/10. 490 divided by 419 is approximately 1.169. So 1.169 /10 is about 0.1169, which is 1.169e-1, approximately 1.2e-1. So that matches.

So if part (a)'s answer is 4.9e2, then option I is the correct choice.

But wait, let me double-check using g=9.8.

PE = mgh = 5 * 9.8 *10 = 490 J.

Yes, that's correct. So the heat is 490 J.

Then, for part (b), 490 J into 1 kg of water: 490 /4190 ≈ 0.1169 K, which is 1.17e-1, so 1.2e-1 when rounded to two significant figures.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.9e2 J and 1.2e-1 K. So that's the correct one.

But wait, looking at the options again, option I is stated as:

I: 4.9 × 10^2J, 1.2 × 10^-1 °K.

Yes, that matches.

So the correct answer is option I.

To solve the problem, we calculate the heat energy produced by the falling rock and the resulting temperature change in water.

### Part (a): Heat Energy Produced
The rock falls a vertical distance of 10 m, converting its potential energy into kinetic energy, which is then dissipated as heat. The potential energy is given by:

\[
PE = mgh
\]

Where:
- \( m = 5 \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the rock),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( h = 10 \, \text{m} \) (height).

Substituting the values:

\[
PE = 5 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 10 = 490 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the heat energy produced is \( 4.9 \times 10^2 \, \text{J} \).

### Part (b): Temperature Change in Water
The heat energy is used to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water. The relationship between heat energy, mass, specific heat capacity, and temperature change is:

\[
Q = mc\Delta T \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta T = \frac{Q}{mc}
\]

Where:
- \( Q = 490 \, \text{J} \) (heat energy from part (a)),
- \( m = 1 \, \text{kg} \) (mass of water),
- \( c = 4.19 \times 10^3 \, \text{J/kg·K} \) (specific heat capacity of water).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{490}{1 \cdot 4.19 \times 10^3} = \frac{490}{4190} \approx 0.117 \, \text{K}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures, the temperature change is approximately \( 1.2 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{K} \).

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- Part (a): \( 4.9 \times 10^2 \, \text{J} \),
- Part (b): \( 1.2 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{K} \).

The correct option is:

**I: \( 4.9 \times 10^2 \, \text{J}, 1.2 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{K} \).**
