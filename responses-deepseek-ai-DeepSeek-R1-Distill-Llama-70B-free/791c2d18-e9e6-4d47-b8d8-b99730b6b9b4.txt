Okay, so I've got this pump problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is asking.

Part (a) says: It's desired to deliver 1,600 gpm at a head of 900 ft with a single-stage pump. What's the minimum speed that could be used?

Hmm, right. I remember that pumps and their performance relate to something called the specific speed. Oh wait, specific speed, that's a dimensionless parameter that helps in selecting the right pump for a given application. I think the formula for specific speed (N_s) is something like N_s = (Q^(1/2)) * (N) / (H^(3/4)), but wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Alternatively, I've heard that specific speed can also be calculated using units where it's N_s = (flow rate in gpm)^(1/2) multiplied by the pump speed in rpm, divided by (head in feet)^(3/4). So N_s = (Q^0.5 * N) / (H^0.75). But wait, I might have the formula reversed. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps it's N_s = (Q^(1/2) * N) / (H^(3/4)), but I might have the equation structure wrong. Alternatively, I think there's a different formula, maybe N_s = (Q * N) / (H)^(something)? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think specific speed is defined as N_s = Q^(1/2) * N / H^(3/4). So the formula is N_s = sqrt(Q) * N / (H)^(3/4). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct formula. Let me double-check. Oh, right, in US units, the specific speed (sometimes called the suction specific speed when considering NPSH) is given by N_s = (Q in gpm)^(0.5) * (N in rpm) / (H in feet)^(0.75). So that's the formula.

Now, for a single-stage pump, I think there's a maximum efficiency point or an optimal specific speed range. I remember that for centrifugal pumps, the specific speed helps determine the type of impeller. For example, lower specific speeds might correspond to radial flow impellers, while higher ones might be mixed or axial flow. But the key here is that each type of pump has an optimal specific speed range for maximum efficiency.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum speed to achieve that head and flow. So perhaps we're looking for the maximum specific speed that a single-stage pump can handle. Because if you go beyond that, you might need a multistage pump, or the efficiency would drop, or maybe it's not possible.

Wait, no, actually, the maximum specific speed for a single-stage pump is around 4000 or so, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Oh, right, typical specific speed ranges for different pump types: for example, radial flow might be up to around N_s = 2000-3000. Beyond that, you might need a mixed flow or axial flow impeller. But for a single-stage pump, maybe the maximum N_s is around 4000. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard maximum specific speed for a single-stage pump. I think in some references, the maximum specific speed for a single-stage centrifugal pump is about 3500 or 4000, beyond which you'd need multiple stages or a different design.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum speed, so I think we're looking for the maximum specific speed possible for a single-stage pump. Because if we can go as high as possible, then the required speed would be as low as possible. So the maximum specific speed (N_s) allowed for a single-stage pump would determine the minimum N needed.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. The specific speed is a function of flow, head, and speed. So rearranging the formula to solve for N: N = (N_s * H^(3/4)) / sqrt(Q). So, if we know the maximum N_s allowed for a single-stage pump, we can plug in the values to find the minimum N.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, for part (a), we need to find the minimum speed to achieve 1600 gpm and 900 ft head with a single-stage pump. So, probably the maximum specific speed for a single-stage pump would be a certain value, and using that, we can compute the minimum N.

I think the maximum specific speed for a single-stage pump is around 3500. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 3000. Let me think. I've heard that for maximum efficiency, a specific speed of around 2500-3000 is typical for single-stage pumps, but perhaps the maximum is higher. Let me try to look up the typical specific speed ranges.

Wait, I'm supposed to be thinking this through without external resources, so I'll have to go from memory. So, from what I remember, for a single-stage centrifugal pump, the maximum specific speed is about 4000. So N_s_max = 4000.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe it's 3500. Alternatively, perhaps the N_s for a single-stage pump can't exceed 3500. So to proceed, let's assume that the maximum specific speed for a single-stage pump is 3500.

So, given that, we can plug into the formula:

N_s = sqrt(Q) * N / H^(3/4)

We can rearrange this to solve for N:

N = (N_s * H^(3/4)) / sqrt(Q)

We want to find the minimum N, which would correspond to the maximum possible N_s. Let's take N_s as 3500.

So plugging in:

Q = 1600 gpm
H = 900 ft

So:

sqrt(Q) = sqrt(1600) = 40 gpm^0.5

H^(3/4) = (900)^(3/4). Hmm, calculating that. Let's see, 900 is 30^2, so 30^2 = 900. So 900^(1/4) is sqrt(sqrt(900)) = sqrt(30) ≈ 5.477. So 900^(3/4) = (900^(1/4))^3 ≈ (5.477)^3 ≈ 5.477 * 5.477 = ~30, then 30 *5.477 ≈ 164.3. Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 5.477^3 = 5.477 * 5.477 = let's compute 5*5=25, 5*.477=2.385, .477*5=2.385, .477*.477≈0.2275. So 25 + 2.385 + 2.385 + 0.2275 ≈ 30. So 5.477^3 is about 163. So H^(3/4) ≈ 163.

So then N = (3500 * 163) / 40

Let's compute that: 3500 * 163 = 3500 * 160 = 560,000, plus 3500*3=10,500 → total 570,500.

Then, 570,500 / 40 = 14,262.5 rpm.

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options. But the options for part (a) are in the 1000-3200 rpm range. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula backward. Because specific speed is higher when the speed is higher, but maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the formula N = (N_s * H^(3/4)) ) / sqrt(Q). But if that gives 14k rpm, which isn't an option, I must have done something wrong.

Wait a minute, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The specific speed formula is N_s = (Q^(1/2) * N) / (H^(3/4)). So solving for N gives N = (N_s * H^(3/4)) / Q^(1/2). So that's correct. But if the result is too high, perhaps I'm using the wrong maximum N_s.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum N_s for a single-stage pump is lower, like 2500.

Let me try N_s = 2500.

So N = (2500 * 163) / 40 = (2500 * 163) = let's compute 2500*160=400,000, plus 2500*3=7,500 → 407,500. Then 407,500 /40 = 10,187.5 rpm. Still way too high.

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of H^(3/4). Let me re-calculate that.

H is 900 ft. So H^(3/4) is e^( (3/4) * ln(900) ). Let me compute ln(900). 900 is 9.4868 in natural log. So (3/4)*9.4868 ≈ 7.115. Then e^7.115 ≈ e^7 is about 1096, e^0.115 is about 1.122, so 1096 * 1.122 ≈ 1230. So H^(3/4) ≈ 1230? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought H^(3/4)=163. No, wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me compute 900^(3/4) correctly.

Wait, 900^(1/4) is the fourth root of 900. Let's compute that. 900 = 30^2, so 30^2 = 900, so 30^(2/4) = 30^(1/2) = sqrt(30) ≈5.477. So 900^(1/4)=~5.477. Then 900^(3/4) is (900^(1/4))^3 ≈5.477^3.

Wait 5.477 * 5.477 = let's compute: 5*5=25, 5*0.477=2.385, 0.477*5=2.385, 0.477^2≈0.2275. So adding up: 25 + 2.385 + 2.385 + 0.2275 = 25 + 4.77 + 0.2275 ≈ 30. So 5.477^2 ≈30. Then 5.477^3 = 5.477 * 30 ≈ 164.31. So H^(3/4)≈164.3.

Wait, that's what I had before. So earlier calculation stands. So N= (2500 * 164.3)/40 = ?

2500 *164.3 = 2500*(160+4.3)=2500*160=400,000 + 2500*4.3=10,750 → total 410,750. Then 410,750 /40 = 10,268.75 rpm. Still way higher than the options. So perhaps the maximum N_s for a single-stage pump is lower, like 1500?

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Perhaps the question is using a different specific speed formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N_s = (N * Q^0.5) / H^0.75, which is the same as what I have. So I'm not sure why I'm getting such a high RPM.

Wait, looking at the options for part (a), the highest RPM is 3200 (option F: 3200 rpm and 1 stage). But according to my calculation, even with N_s=2500, I get around 10,000 rpm, which is way beyond any option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the specific speed formula is N_s = (Q * N) / (H)^(something else). Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses different units. Wait, the formula I'm using is for when Q is in gpm, H in feet, and N in rpm. So that should be correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the specific speed is per stage. So if it's a single-stage pump, then the specific speed applies to that single stage, but if it's a multistage, each stage contributes to the total head. But in this case, part (a) is a single-stage pump, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should look up the specific speed ranges again. From what I recall, for single-stage centrifugal pumps, the specific speed ranges from about 500 to 3500. So perhaps the maximum N_s is 3500. Let me try that.

So N_s=3500.

N = (3500 * 164.3) / 40 = (3500 * 164.3) = let's compute 3500*160=560,000 and 3500*4.3=14,550 → 574,550. Then 574,550 /40 = 14,363.75 rpm. Still way too high. None of the options go that high. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the minimum speed, so perhaps we need the minimum N that would allow the pump to achieve the head, which would correspond to the maximum N_s possible for that application. So perhaps the maximum N_s for a single-stage pump is 3000, but again, that still leads to high RPM.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach: perhaps the formula is N = (H * 33.67) / (Q^0.5) ) * number of stages. Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think. Oh, perhaps it's the formula for the minimum speed using the affinity laws, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula that relates the required speed to the head and flow rate, considering the maximum efficiency or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like using the pump equations.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe using the affinity laws. The affinity laws relate the performance of a pump when its speed changes. They state that Q is proportional to N, H is proportional to N², and power is proportional to N³. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with desired performance, so perhaps the question is about the minimum speed based on the maximum specific speed. Maybe I should look for the minimum N where N_s is at its maximum allowed value for a single stage.

But since my earlier approach isn't working, perhaps I should try to compute N for each option and see which one meets the head and flow with a single stage.

Looking at the options for part (a), the only option with 1 stage is F: 3200 rpm and 1 stage. So if I can compute whether 3200 rpm can achieve 1600 gpm and 900 ft head in a single stage, that might be the answer.

So using the specific speed formula again: N_s = sqrt(Q) * N / H^(3/4).

Plugging in Q=1600, N=3200, H=900.

sqrt(1600)=40.

H^(3/4)= as before, 164.3.

So N_s = (40 * 3200) / 164.3 ≈ (128,000) / 164.3 ≈ 778. So N_s≈778.

Is that within the acceptable range for a single-stage pump? If the maximum N_s for single-stage is around 3500, then 778 is way below that, meaning that a single stage can easily handle it, but we're looking for the minimum N. So perhaps 3200 rpm is higher than necessary.

Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum speed. So the minimum N would correspond to the maximum N_s allowed. So if a higher N_s is allowed, then the N can be lower.

Wait, perhaps I should find the maximum N_s, then compute the N, and see which option matches.

But given that, let's try with N_s=3500.

N = (3500 * 164.3) /40 ≈ 14,363 rpm. But none of the options have such a high RPM, so perhaps the maximum N_s is lower.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look at part (b) as well. Part (b) says, for the same conditions, how many stages must the pump have if a rotational speed of 600 rpm is used.

So for part (b), N=600 rpm, Q=1600 gpm, H=900 ft.

If the pump has multiple stages, each stage contributes to the head. So the total head is the sum of the heads of each stage. So each stage would have a head of H_stage = 900 / number_of_stages.

And each stage's specific speed would be N_s_stage = sqrt(Q) * N / (H_stage)^(3/4).

But if the specific speed per stage is within the allowable range (e.g., up to 3500), then it's possible. So perhaps we can compute the number of stages needed so that each stage's N_s is below the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to approach part (b) is to compute the specific speed per stage when N=600 rpm, and see how many stages are needed to keep each stage's N_s below the maximum allowed.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total specific speed. Let me see.

Wait, the specific speed for the entire pump would be N_s_total = sqrt(Q) * N / (H_total)^(3/4). So for part (b), if N=600, Q=1600, H=900, then N_s_total = sqrt(1600)*600 / (900)^(3/4) = 40*600 /164.3 ≈ 24,000 / 164.3 ≈ 146. So N_s_total is 146, which is way below the maximum for a single stage. But since the pump is multistage, each stage's specific speed can be higher.

Wait, perhaps each stage contributes to the total head, so each stage's head is H_stage = H_total / number_of_stages.

So for a multistage pump with 'k' stages, each stage has H_stage = 900/k.

The specific speed per stage would then be N_s_stage = sqrt(Q) * N / (H_stage)^(3/4) = 40 * 600 / (
