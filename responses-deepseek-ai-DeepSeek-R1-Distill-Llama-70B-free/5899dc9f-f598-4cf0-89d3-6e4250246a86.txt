Okay, so I have this problem about a monochromator and I need to find the coherence time and coherence length of the light it produces. Hmm, I remember that a monochromator is used to get monochromatic light from a white source, which means it filters the light to a narrow wavelength range. The question gives me some parameters: linear dispersion, exit slit width, and the mean wavelength. I need to figure out the coherence time and length from these.

Wait, let me jot down what I know. The linear dispersion is 1 mm per 20 Angstroms. Oh right, linear dispersion (D) is the change in wavelength per change in position at the exit slit. So D = Δλ / Δx. Here, Δx is the exit slit width. The exit slit is 0.2 mm, which I think is the determining factor for the resolving power or the bandwidth of the light.

The mean wavelength (λ) is 5000 Angstroms. I remember that the coherence time and length are related to the bandwidth of the light source. The narrower the bandwidth, the longer the coherence time and length.

So the first step is to find the bandwidth, Δλ. Since D = Δλ / Δx, rearranging gives Δλ = D * Δx. Wait, but the units have to match. The dispersion is 1 mm per 20 A, so that's (1e-3 m) per (20e-10 m). But wait, wait, the slit is 0.2 mm, which is 0.2e-3 m. Let me compute that.

Calculating Δλ:
D is 1 mm / 20 A → which is (1e-3 m) / (20e-10 m) → 5e7 m⁻¹. Wait no, wait: Wait no, D is in units of mm per Angstrom, so it's 1 mm corresponds to 20 A. To get Δλ, we multiply D by the slit width in mm. So Δx is 0.2 mm. So Δλ = 0.2 mm * (20 A per mm) → 4 A? Because 1mm gives 20A, so 0.2 mm gives 4 A. Oh wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, linear dispersion D is defined as the change in wavelength per unit change in position. So D = dλ/dx. So for a slit width of Δx, the wavelength spread Δλ is D * Δx. So D is (1 mm)/(20 A) → which is 0.05 A per mm? Wait no, wait. 1 mm corresponds to 20 A. So per mm, the wavelength changes by 20 A. So Δλ = D * Δx. So D is 20 A/mm (since 1 mm gives 20 A spread). So Δx is 0.2 mm. So Δλ = 20 A/mm * 0.2 mm = 4 A. So the bandwidth is 4 Angstroms.

Now, the mean wavelength is 5000 A, which is 500 nm. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. 

The coherence time τ is related to the bandwidth Δν (in frequency terms) by τ ≈ 1/(2πΔν), but wait, sometimes it's approximated as τ ≈ λ²/(c Δλ). Alternatively, I think the formula for coherence time is τ = λ²/(c Δλ), where Δλ is the bandwidth in wavelength. Similarly, the coherence length L is c * τ, which would be L = λ²/(Δλ). Alternatively, since L = c τ, and τ is λ²/(c Δλ), then L = (λ^2)/(Δλ).

Wait, yes, I think that's right. So let's compute the coherence time first. 

τ = λ²/(c Δλ). Plugging in the numbers:

λ is 5000 Angstroms → 5000e-10 m = 5e-7 m.

Δλ is 4 Angstroms → 4e-10 m.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So τ = (5e-7)^2 / (3e8 * 4e-10).

Let me calculate numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: (5e-7)^2 = 25e-14 = 2.5e-13 m².

Denominator: 3e8 *4e-10 = 12e-2 = 0.12 m/s? Wait no: 3e8 m/s *4e-10 m → 3e8 *4e-10 = 12e-2 → 1.2e-1, but the units are m²/s? Let me think again. Wait, no, Δλ is in meters, so denominator is (m/s) * m = m²/s.

So denominator is 3e8 * 4e-10 → 3e8 is 3*1e8, 4e-10 is 4*1e-10 → 3*4=12; 1e8 *1e-10=1e-2. So 12e-2 → 0.12.

So denominator is 0.12 m²/s.

So τ = 2.5e-13 / 0.12 = approx 2.083e-12 seconds. Let me calculate that more precisely. 2.5e-13 / 0.12 = (2.5 /0.12) * 1e-13 → 2.5/0.12 is approx 20.833... So 20.833e-13 → 2.083e-12 seconds. So about 2.08e-12 seconds.

Wait wait, no. Wait, 2.5e-13 divided by 0.12: 0.12 goes into 2.5e-13 how many times? Let me compute 2.5e-13 / 0.12.

2.5 / 0.12 is approximately 20.833333. So 20.833333e-13 = 2.083333e-12 seconds. So τ is approximately 2.08e-12 seconds.

Now coherence length L = c * τ. So c is 3e8 m/s → 3e8 * 2.08e-12 s = 6.24e-4 m. So about 6.24e-4 meters, which is 0.624 mm.

Wait, but wait, I thought the formula was L = λ²/(Δλ). Let me check that. So λ is 5e-7 m, so λ squared is (5e-7)^2 = 2.5e-13 m². Δλ is 4e-10 m. So L = 2.5e-13 / 4e-10 = 6.25e-4 m, which is 0.625e-3 m? Wait, no, 6.25e-4 m is 0.625 mm, same as before. So yes, 6.25e-4 m.

Wait, but let me think about the calculation again. Let me compute 2.5e-13 divided by 4e-10:

2.5e-13 / 4e-10 = (2.5 /4) * 1e-3 → 0.625 * 1e-3 → 6.25e-4 m. So yes, same as before.

So τ is approximately 2.08e-12 seconds, and L is 6.25e-4 meters, which is 0.625e-3 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option J says Coherence time: 2.1 × 10^-12 sec, Coherence length: 6.3 × 10^-4 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives 2.08e-12 s and 6.25e-4 m. So option J's τ is 2.1e-12 and L is 6.3e-4, which is very close. So J is the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check the formulas because sometimes I might confuse the exact expressions. Another approach is to relate the bandwidth in terms of frequency. The coherence time is inversely proportional to the bandwidth in frequency.

Δλ is 4 A, λ is 5000 A.

The relative bandwidth is Δλ/λ = 4/5000 = 0.0008.

The coherence length L is approximately λ^2 / Δλ. Wait, that's what I used.

Alternatively, using frequency: the bandwidth in frequency is Δν = c (Δλ / λ²). Because ν = c/λ → Δν = |dν/dλ| Δλ = (c / λ²) Δλ.

Wait, so Δν = (c / λ²) * Δλ.

So then the coherence time τ is about 1/(Δν) → τ ≈ λ²/(c Δλ), which is the same formula I used. So that's correct.

Another way, in terms of wavelength, the coherence length L is c * τ = (c λ²)/(c Δλ) ) → L = λ² / Δλ. So yes, same result.

So I think my calculation is correct. The answer should be option J.

To determine the coherence time and coherence length of the light from the monochromator, we start by calculating the wavelength bandwidth, Δλ. The linear dispersion is given as 1 mm per 20 Å, and the exit slit width is 0.2 mm. Using the relationship:

\[
\Delta \lambda = D \cdot \Delta x
\]

where \( D = 20 \, \text{Å/mm} \) and \( \Delta x = 0.2 \, \text{mm} \), we find:

\[
\Delta \lambda = 20 \, \text{Å/mm} \cdot 0.2 \, \text{mm} = 4 \, \text{Å}.
\]

The mean wavelength is \( \lambda = 5000 \, \text{Å} = 5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). The coherence time \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\lambda^2}{c \cdot \Delta \lambda},
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\tau = \frac{(5 \times 10^{-7})^2}{(3 \times 10^8) \cdot (4 \times 10^{-10})}.
\]

The numerator is:

\[
(5 \times 10^{-7})^2 = 25 \times 10^{-14} = 2.5 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m}^2,
\]

and the denominator is:

\[
(3 \times 10^8) \cdot (4 \times 10^{-10}) = 12 \times 10^{-2} = 0.12 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\tau = \frac{2.5 \times 10^{-13}}{0.12} \approx 2.08 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{s}.
\]

The coherence length \( L \) is related to the coherence time by:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau.
\]

Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau = 2.08 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.08 \times 10^{-12}) \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}.
\]

Comparing these results with the options provided, the closest match is:

- Coherence time: \( 2.1 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{s} \)
- Coherence length: \( 6.3 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m} \)

This corresponds to **Option J**.
