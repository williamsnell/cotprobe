Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the lifetime of a neutron as observed from different frames of reference. Hmm, I remember something about special relativity and time dilation. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem says an observer on Earth measures the lifetime of a neutron as 6.42 × 10² seconds. Then, there's another observer in a spacecraft moving past the lab at a speed of 2 × 10⁸ m/s. The question is asking what the lifetime would be according to this moving observer.

Wait, time dilation... right. Time moves slower for the moving object from the perspective of the stationary observer. Or wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. From the perspective of the stationary observer, the moving clock runs slower. But wait, in this case, the Earth observer is measuring the neutron's lifetime as 6.42e2 seconds. The spacecraft is moving relative to the Earth, so the neutron's lifetime as seen from the spacecraft would be... longer? Or shorter?

Wait, no. Time dilation says that the moving clock is slower. So if the Earth sees the neutron's lifetime as a certain duration, the moving observer (on the spacecraft) would see that duration as longer, because their own time is moving slower. Or wait, no, the moving observer would see the Earth's time as dilated, but the Earth is also moving relative to the spacecraft. Oh wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me clarify. In special relativity, each observer sees the other's clock as running slower. But in this scenario, the neutron is at rest relative to the Earth observer. So for the Earth observer, the neutron's lifetime is proper time, which is the shortest possible measurement. The moving observer (spacecraft) would see this proper time as being longer. So the moving observer measures a longer lifetime.

Wait, no. Wait, proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. So the Earth observer measures the neutron's lifetime as proper time (τ) because the neutron is at rest there. The moving observer measures a dilated time (t), which is longer than τ. So the formula is t = γ * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the speed given here is 2e8 m/s. Let me calculate γ. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v = 2e8 m/s. Then, v/c is 2/3. So β is 2/3.

The Lorentz factor γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Let me compute β squared: (2/3)^2 is 4/9. So 1 - 4/9 is 5/9. The square root of 5/9 is sqrt(5)/3, which is approximately 2.236 / 3 ≈ 0.745. So γ is 1 / 0.745 ≈ 1.3416.

So the time measured by the moving observer would be γ multiplied by the proper time. So 6.42e2 s * 1.3416 ≈ let me compute that.

6.42 * 1.3416: Let me calculate 6 * 1.34 is 8.04, and 0.42 * 1.34 is about 0.563, so total around 8.603. So 8.603e2 s, which is approximately 8.6e2 seconds.

Looking at the options, option A is 8.62 ×10² s, which is close to my calculation. Option H is 1.34 times 6.42 ×10² s, which is the same as 6.42 *1.34. Wait, 1.34 is approximately the gamma factor I used. So 6.42 *1.34 = ?

Wait, 6 *1.34 is 8.04, 0.42 *1.34 is 0.5628. So 8.04 + 0.5628 = 8.6028, which is 8.60e2, close to option A (8.62e2). But wait, option H says 1.34 ×6.42 ×10² s, which would be 8.60e2 s, same as option A. Wait, no: option A is 8.62e2, but 6.42 *1.34 is 8.60, which is 8.60e2. So why the slight difference? Let me double-check the exact gamma calculation.

Wait, I approximated gamma as 1.3416. Let's compute it more accurately. Beta is 2/3, so beta squared is 4/9. 1 - beta squared is 5/9. Square root of 5/9 is sqrt(5)/3. Sqrt(5) is about 2.23607. So sqrt(5)/3 is approximately 0.745355. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.745355. Let's compute 1 / 0.745355.

0.745355 is approximately equal to 0.745. Let's compute 1 / 0.745. 0.745 × 1.3416 = 1. So 1/0.745 ≈ 1.3416. Let me verify with more precise division: 1 / 0.745355.

1/0.745355 ≈ 1.34164. So 6.42e2 * 1.34164 is 6.42 * 1.34164 = ?

Compute 6 * 1.34164 = 8.04984. 0.42 *1.34164 = let's compute 0.4 *1.34164 = 0.536656, 0.02*1.34164=0.0268328. Sum those: 0.536656 + 0.0268328 = 0.5634888. So total is 8.04984 + 0.5634888 ≈ 8.6133. So 8.6133e2 s, which is approximately 8.61e2. Looking at the options, option A is 8.62e2, which is very close. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but another thought: the problem states that the spacecraft is moving past the laboratory at that speed. So the relative velocity is v = 2e8 m/s. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if I had it the other way around, but in this case, the proper time is on Earth. So the moving observer measures a longer time, so option A is correct.

Looking at the options, option A is 8.62e2, which matches the calculation. So the answer should be A.

To determine the lifetime of a neutron as measured by an observer in a spacecraft moving past the laboratory at a speed of \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we use the concept of time dilation from special relativity. The Earth observer measures the neutron's lifetime as \( \tau = 6.42 \times 10^2 \, \text{s} \), which is the proper time since the neutron is at rest in the Earth's frame. The moving observer in the spacecraft will measure a dilated time \( t \), given by:

\[
t = \gamma \tau
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}, \quad \beta = \frac{v}{c}
\]

Here, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, so:

\[
\beta = \frac{2 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{4}{9}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{5}{9}}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \):

\[
\gamma \approx \frac{3}{2.236} \approx 1.3416
\]

Now, calculate the dilated time:

\[
t = \gamma \tau = 1.3416 \times 6.42 \times 10^2
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
1.3416 \times 6.42 = 8.6133
\]

So:

\[
t \approx 8.6133 \times 10^2 \, \text{s}
\]

This value is closest to option A, \( 8.62 \times 10^2 \, \text{s} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: \( 8.62 \times 10^2 \, \text{s} \)**
