Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about triangular or recursive systems, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me start by recalling what I know about such systems.

From what I remember, a triangular system is a set of equations where each equation has its own dependent variable, and the independent variables in each equation are either exogenous or lagged endogenous variables. Oh wait, no, wait—triangular systems can have some endogenous variables as well, but arranged in such a way that they form a recursive structure. Recursive systems, I think, are a type of simultaneous equations model where there's no feedback between equations. So each equation can be estimated without dealing with all the equations at once, perhaps?

Now the question is about which statements are true regarding such systems. The statements are i through iv, and I need to evaluate each.

Let me go through each statement one by one.

Statement i: "The parameters can be validly estimated using separate applications of OLS to each equation." Hmm. In a triangular system, I think each equation might not have any endogenous variables on the right-hand side. Or wait, maybe each equation has some exogenous variables and perhaps some endogenous variables, but arranged in a way that they don't create simultaneity. So if that's the case, then OLS should work because there's no simultaneity bias. Because in a recursive system, the dependent variables of one equation don't appear as explanatory variables in another equation that comes earlier in the order. So applying OLS separately should be fine. So statement i would be true.

Statement ii: "The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in other equations." Wait, in a triangular system, I think the error terms are uncorrelated across equations. Because each equation's errors are independent. Or maybe not? Wait, no, if the system is recursive, the errors could be correlated across equations. For example, if one equation's error term is part of the error structure of another equation. Or maybe not. I'm a bit fuzzy here. Let me think again. In a recursive system, the errors are assumed to be uncorrelated across equations, right? Because the system is set up so that each equation's disturbance doesn't affect the others beyond what's captured by the recursive structure. So if that's the case, then statement ii is false because the independent variables wouldn't be correlated with other equations' errors. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: if the system is triangular, then each equation's explanatory variables are either exogenous or predetermined. So in each equation, the independent variables are uncorrelated with the error term of that equation. But what about errors from other equations? Oh, wait, the error terms could be correlated across equations. For instance, in a two-equation system, the error from the first equation might affect the second. But in a recursive setup, perhaps the errors are orthogonal. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at the other statements to get more clues.

Statement iii: "An application of 2SLS would lead to unbiased but inefficient parameter estimates." Okay, 2SLS is a method used when there's endogeneity. But in a triangular system, if OLS is already unbiased, then using 2SLS would still be unbiased but perhaps inefficient because 2SLS has a higher variance. So statement iii is true. Because 2SLS is a consistent estimator, but when the system is recursive and OLS is sufficient, 2SLS would work but not be as efficient. So statement iii is correct.

Statement iv: "The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables." Wait, in a triangular system, each equation's independent variables are assumed to be exogenous or predetermined. So they should be uncorrelated with the error term of their own equation. If that's the case, then statement iv is false. Because in each equation, the X's are uncorrelated with the error, so they can't be correlated with their own equation's errors. So statement iv is false.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because I might be mixing up concepts. Let me recap:

In a triangular system, each equation is such that the explanatory variables are either exogenous or lagged endogenous, but arranged in a way that avoids simultaneity. So each equation's X's are uncorrelated with the error of that equation. But between equations, the X's might be correlated with errors from other equations. Wait, no, no, because the errors are orthogonal across equations in a recursive system. Or is that not necessarily the case?

Wait, perhaps in a recursive system, the errors are uncorrelated across equations. So then, statement ii says that independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in other equations. If the errors are uncorrelated across equations, then the independent variables (which are exogenous or predetermined) wouldn't be correlated with other equations' errors. So statement ii would be false. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe in a recursive system, each equation's error is uncorrelated with the errors of the equations that come after it in the ordering, but possibly correlated with the ones before. Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps in a triangular system, each equation's error is uncorrelated with all other errors, making the system's errors orthogonal. If that's the case, then statement ii would be false because the X's in one equation are uncorrelated with the errors of other equations.

Wait, but the X's in one equation could include lagged values of endogenous variables from other equations. So, for example, in a two-equation system, equation 1 might have Y1 and X1, and equation 2 might have Y2, Y1, and X2. Wait, no, that's simultaneity. But in a recursive system, equation 1's Y1 is an explanatory variable in equation 2, but equation 2's Y2 doesn't appear in equation 1. So if equation 1's X's include variables that are correlated with equation 2's error, then statement ii would hold. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck on statement ii. Let me think about the properties again. In a recursive system, it's assumed that there's no feedback, so each equation can be estimated with OLS. The error terms are uncorrelated across equations. So the X's in equation 1 are uncorrelated with the error of equation 2, because the errors are uncorrelated. So statement ii would be false. Because the independent variables in equation 1 are not correlated with the error terms in equation 2, and so on.

So, let me summarize my evaluation:

i: True. Because OLS can be applied separately to each equation.

ii: False. Because in recursive systems, the errors are uncorrelated, so X's in one equation are not correlated with errors from other equations.

iii: True. Applying 2SLS would give unbiased estimates, but since OLS is already unbiased, 2SLS is just another unbiased method, but less efficient.

iv: False. Because in each equation, X's are uncorrelated with that equation's errors.

Wait, but wait—what if the system isn't fully recursive? Or perhaps the statements are more general. Let me check the options given.

Looking at the options, option E is (i), (iii), and (iv) only. But I thought iv was false. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check statement iv. It says, "The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables." So, in their own equation, the X's are correlated with the error? But in a well-specified model, the X's are exogenous, so they should be uncorrelated with the error. So statement iv would be false. So if that's the case, then statements i and iii are true, and ii and iv are false.

Looking at the options, option D is (i) and (iii) only. So which is option D: (i) and (iii) only.

Wait, but earlier I thought statement ii was false, and iv was false. So which statements are true?

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, in a triangular system, each equation's X's are uncorrelated with that equation's error. So statement iv, which says they may be correlated, is false. So iv is false.

Statement ii says that the X's may be correlated with the errors in other equations. If the system is recursive, the errors are orthogonal across equations, so the X's in equation 1 are uncorrelated with the errors in equation 2. So statement ii is false.

So among the statements, i and iii are true. So which option is that? Let me look at the options again.

Option D: (i) and (iii) only.

Option E: (i), (iii), (iv) only.

Wait, but if iv is false, then option D is correct. But wait, wait. Another possibility: perhaps the independent variables in one equation are correlated with the errors in another equation. So statement ii could be true.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about statement ii. Let's think again. In a triangular system, each equation's X's are uncorrelated with their own equation's error, but could be correlated with other equations' errors. For example, if equation 1 has X1, and equation 2 has X2 and Y1. If X1 is correlated with the error in equation 2, then statement ii would be true. But in a recursive system, that shouldn't happen because X1 is exogenous, so it's uncorrelated with all errors, including equation 2's. So statement ii is false.

So, only statements i and iii are true. So the correct option is D: (i) and (iii) only. Looking at the options, option D is (i) and (iii) only.

Wait, but the options include other combinations too. Let me double-check.

Wait, another thought: perhaps statement iv is about the same equation. So if the independent variables are correlated with their own equation's error, that's endogeneity. But in a recursive system, that's not the case because the X's are exogenous or predetermined. So statement iv is false. So only i and iii are true.

So the correct answer should be option D: (i) and (iii) only.

In a triangular or recursive system, the key properties are that there is no simultaneity bias, and the errors are uncorrelated across equations. Based on this, let us evaluate the statements:

1. **Statement (i):** "The parameters can be validly estimated using separate applications of OLS to each equation."  
   This is true because, in a triangular system, there is no simultaneity, and the explanatory variables in each equation are exogenous or predetermined. Thus, OLS can be applied separately to each equation without bias.

2. **Statement (ii):** "The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in other equations."  
   This is false. In a recursive system, the errors are uncorrelated across equations, and the explanatory variables are exogenous or predetermined. Therefore, the independent variables in one equation are not correlated with the error terms of other equations.

3. **Statement (iii):** "An application of 2SLS would lead to unbiased but inefficient parameter estimates."  
   This is true. While OLS is sufficient and unbiased in a triangular system, 2SLS would also provide unbiased estimates. However, 2SLS is less efficient than OLS in this context.

4. **Statement (iv):** "The independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables."  
   This is false. In a well-specified triangular system, the explanatory variables are exogenous or predetermined, meaning they are uncorrelated with the error terms in their own equation.

From this analysis, only statements (i) and (iii) are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: (i) and (iii) only.**
