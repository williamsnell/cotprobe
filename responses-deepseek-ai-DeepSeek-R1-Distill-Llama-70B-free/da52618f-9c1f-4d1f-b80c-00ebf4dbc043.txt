Question:

An employee worked for a hardware company in a city under an at-will-employment arrangement that paid the employee a monthly salary of $2,000. After two years, the owner of the hardware store told the employee it was time for them to enter into a more formalized employment agreement. The owner and the employee then both signed a written agreement drafted by the owner, whereby the employee agreed to work for a salary of $3,000 per month. The agreement further specified that either party had a right to terminate the contract by giving 60- days' notice to the other. Moreover, the agreement stipulated that if the employee's employment at the hardware store should be terminated, he would not be able to engage in any aspect of the hardware business for a period of two years within a 50-mile radius of the city. Finally, the agreement stated that should the employee violate this agreement, he would be liable to the hardware company for $1,500. The written agreement between the owner and the employee would most likely be held

Options:

A: enforceable only with respect to the salary and termination provisions.
B: enforceable only with respect to the salary provision.
C: enforceable only with respect to the $1,500 penalty clause.
D: enforceable only with respect to the termination provision.
E: enforceable in all respects, except with regard to the $1,500 penalty clause.
F: enforceable only with respect to the non-competition clause.
G: enforceable in all respects, except with regard to the non-competition clause.
H: unenforceable in all respects.
I: enforceable in all respects, except with regard to the salary provision.
J: enforceable in all respects.

Okay, so I've got this question about employment law, specifically dealing with contracts and at-will employment. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

Alright, the scenario is that an employee worked for a hardware company under an at-will arrangement, meaning either party could terminate the employment at any time without cause. After two years, the owner wanted a more formal agreement. So they drafted a written contract which both signed. Let's look at the key points in the contract.

First, the salary increased from $2,000 to $3,000 a month. That seems straightforward. Then there's a termination clause requiring 60 days' notice from either party. So this moves them from at-will to a contract with specific terms regarding termination. 

Next, there's a non-competition clause. If the employee is terminated, they can't work in the hardware business for two years within a 50-mile radius. That's a pretty common type of restrictive covenant. I remember that non-compete agreements are generally enforceable if they're reasonable in terms of time and geography, and if they protect a legitimate business interest. Two years and 50 miles might be considered reasonable, but I'm not sure. It can vary by jurisdiction, but the question doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's within acceptable limits.

Then there's a penalty clause: if the employee violates the agreement, like by competing, they have to pay the company $1,500. Hmm, I think some states allow for liquidated damages clauses, but others might view this as a penalty. Liquidated damages are meant to estimate actual damages, while penalties are meant to punish and might not be enforceable. But again, it depends on the jurisdiction. If $1,500 is seen as reasonable and not punitive, it might hold up. Otherwise, it could be struck down.

So the question is about the enforceability of the written agreement. The options are about which parts are enforceable. Let's review the possible issues.

1. Salary: That's a basic term, so it's enforceable. Both parties agreed to it, so no problem there.

2. Termination: The at-will arrangement was changed to require 60 days' notice. Contracts can modify at-will employment, so this should be enforceable as long as the terms are clear and both parties agreed.

3. Non-competition: As I thought earlier, generally enforceable if reasonable. So assuming the time and area are reasonable, this part is okay.

4. Penalty clause: This is tricky. If the clause is seen as a legitimate liquidated damages provision, it's enforceable. But if it's just a penalty to punish the employee, it might not be. Some courts don't like penalties because they can deter employees from leaving, which could be against public policy. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Wait, another point: in some jurisdictions, non-compete agreements with penalties might be viewed more strictly. Also, the amount $1,500 might be too low or too high. But without details, I'll have to make an educated guess.

So, the options are looking at which parts are enforceable. The question is whether the entire contract is enforceable or if some parts are not.

Option J says the entire agreement is enforceable. But I'm thinking the penalty might be an issue. Alternatively, the non-compete could be the issue, but I don't think so. So, is the penalty clause enforceable?

Another angle: At-will employment can be modified by a contract, so the termination clause is fine. The non-compete is probably okay. The salary is definitely okay. The only possible problem is the $1,500 penalty.

Wait, but I remember that in some cases, liquidated damages in employment contracts are allowed if they're reasonable. If the employer can't easily calculate actual damages, a liquidated damages clause is acceptable. If $1,500 is reasonable as an estimate, then it's okay. But if it's seen as a penalty, it might be unenforceable.

So the question becomes, is the $1,500 penalty enforceable or not? If it's not, then the answer would be that the agreement is enforceable except for that part. Looking at the options, option E says enforceable in all respects except the $1,500 penalty. Option G says except the non-compete, which I don't think is the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the non-compete is overbroad. But the time frame is two years, which is common, and 50 miles is also a typical radius. So I don't think the non-compete is unenforceable here.

So the problem must be the penalty. If the penalty is a liquidated damages clause, it's okay. If it's a penalty, it's not. But the question doesn't specify the jurisdiction. So I have to make an assumption based on general principles.

In many US jurisdictions, a liquidated damages clause is enforceable if it's a reasonable estimate of damages. If it's too high, it's a penalty. $1,500 might be reasonable, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, some courts might view such a clause as an unenforceable penalty because it's a flat fee regardless of actual damages.

So if the penalty is struck down, then the agreement is enforceable except for the $1,500 clause. So the correct option would be E: enforceable in all respects except the $1,500 penalty clause.

Wait, but another thought: in some states, non-compete agreements are only enforceable if they have a reasonable restraint and if they don't unduly burden the employee. But I think the non-compete here is okay.

So putting it all together, the contract should be enforceable except possibly for the penalty. So the answer should be E.

The written employment agreement between the owner and the employee is analyzed based on its key provisions: salary, termination, non-competition, and a penalty clause. 

1. **Salary Provision**: The increase from $2,000 to $3,000 per month is a basic contractual term and is enforceable as both parties agreed to it.

2. **Termination Provision**: The 60-day notice requirement modifies the at-will employment arrangement. Such modifications are generally enforceable when clearly agreed upon in a contract.

3. **Non-Competition Clause**: The clause restricting the employee from engaging in the hardware business for two years within a 50-mile radius is likely enforceable. Non-competition agreements are typically upheld if they are reasonable in terms of time and geography, and they protect a legitimate business interest. Here, the terms appear reasonable.

4. **Penalty Clause**: The $1,500 penalty for violating the agreement is problematic. Courts often distinguish between liquidated damages, which are enforceable if they represent a reasonable estimate of actual damages, and penalties, which are intended to punish and may be unenforceable. The $1,500 amount could be viewed as punitive rather than compensatory, depending on the jurisdiction. This clause is the most likely to be struck down.

Given these considerations, the agreement is enforceable in all respects except for the $1,500 penalty clause.
