The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion."
â€”John C. Calhoun, "South Carolina Exposition and Protest," 1828
The language of "protest" that Calhoun used in his "Exposition and Protest" was similar to the language of which of the following political positions?

Options:

A: The response of the Democratic-Republicans to the Alien and Sedition Acts.
B: The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812.
C: The response of the American colonists to the British Stamp Act of 1765.
D: The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the "Barbary pirates."
E: The response of the South to the Missouri Compromise of 1820.
F: The response of the Confederacy to the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860.
G: The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.
H: The response of the Whigs to the annexation of Texas.
I: The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s.

Okay, so I've got this question about John C. Calhoun's "South Carolina Exposition and Protest" from 1828. The question is asking which political position's language is similar to Calhoun's protest. The options are from A to J, each referring to different historical events and responses.

First, I need to understand what Calhoun was arguing in his Exposition and Protest. From the passage, it looks like he's talking about states' rights and sovereignty. He mentions that the powers are divided between the General (Federal) Government and the State Governments, and that the States have the right to decide on infractions of their powers. He's against the idea that the Federal Government should have exclusive judgment over the division of powers, as that would consolidate power and undermine state sovereignty.

So Calhoun is advocating for state sovereignty and the right of states to nullify federal actions they deem unconstitutional. This was part of the nullification crisis, particularly regarding tariffs that South Carolina opposed.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find a political position that also emphasized state sovereignty, nullification, or similar states' rights arguments.

Option A: Democratic-Republicans responded to the Alien and Sedition Acts. Those Acts were part of the Federalist policies, and Democratic-Republicans, like Jefferson and Madison, opposed them, arguing for states' rights. Madison wrote the Virginia Resolutions, which proposed that states could nullify federal laws. This seems similar to Calhoun's stance.

Option B: New England Federalists during the War of 1812. They were more about state sovereignty but in opposition to the war, leading to the Hartford Convention. They considered nullification but more in the context of New England's specific grievances. Not sure if it's as similar to Calhoun's broader states' rights argument.

Option C: Colonists responded to the Stamp Act with "no taxation without representation." That's more about resistance to a specific tax, not the broader argument about state sovereignty and nullification.

Option D: Jefferson's response to the Barbary pirates was more about foreign policy and naval actions, not states' rights.

Option E: The South's response to the Missouri Compromise. The Missouri Compromise was about slavery in new states, but the South generally supported it as a compromise. Not sure about the protest language here.

Option F: Confederacy's response to Lincoln's election. That's about secession, which is a step beyond nullification. But the language might be similar in terms of states' rights.

Option G: North's response to Fugitive Slave Act. The North opposed it, but as part of the abolitionist movement, not necessarily using state sovereignty arguments.

Option H: Whigs on Texas annexation. I think the Whigs opposed annexation, but I'm not sure how that ties to state sovereignty language.

Option I: Shays' Rebellion was about debt relief and state economic policies. It's a protest but more about economic grievances than state sovereignty over federal laws.

Option J: Supporters of Jackson and the "corrupt bargain." That's about the 1824 election, where Jackson's supporters felt he was cheated. The "corrupt bargain" refers to the deal that made John Quincy Adams president. Their response was more about electoral fairness, not states' rights.

So, looking back, the key is that Calhoun's argument is about state sovereignty and the right to nullify federal laws. The Democratic-Republicans, particularly Madison and Jefferson, used similar arguments against the Alien and Sedition Acts. They wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which asserted that states could nullify federal laws they deemed unconstitutional. Similarly, Calhoun's Exposition and Protest was a state's rights document arguing for nullification of the tariffs.

So the answer should be A: The response of the Democratic-Republicans to the Alien and Sedition Acts.

The language of protest used by John C. Calhoun in his "South Carolina Exposition and Protest" (1828) emphasizes state sovereignty and the right of states to nullify federal actions deemed unconstitutional. This aligns with the political position of the Democratic-Republicans, who opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts. Leaders like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, arguing that states could nullify federal laws they considered unconstitutional. This stance mirrors Calhoun's argument for state sovereignty and nullification.

Answer: A
