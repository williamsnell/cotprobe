Okay, so I've got this question here about voltage, current, and resistance. Hmm, I remember from my classes that these are related through Ohm's Law. Ohm's Law is V=IR, right? So voltage equals current multiplied by resistance.

The question says, what voltage will send a current of 2 amperes through a bell circuit if the resistance is 3 ohms. Oh, wait, so I need to find the voltage. Let me see, I have I and R, so I can plug those into the formula.

So V = I * R. The current I is 2 A and resistance R is 3 ohms. Multiplying them together: 2 * 3 equals 6. So the voltage should be 6 volts.

Looking at the options, option D is 6 volts. So the answer should be D. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Ohm's Law is definitely V=IR, so yes, 2 times 3 is 6. Yep, I'm confident with that.

To determine the voltage needed to send a current of 2 amperes through a circuit with a resistance of 3 ohms, we use Ohm's Law: 

\[ V = I \times R \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ V = 2 \, \text{A} \times 3 \, \Omega = 6 \, \text{V} \]

Thus, the required voltage is 6 volts. From the options provided, the correct answer is:

D: 6 volts

Answer: D
