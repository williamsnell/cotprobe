Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the density of carbon dioxide under certain conditions. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me the temperature as 100°C and the pressure as 720 mm Hg or 720 torr. I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but I remember that density can be found using the ideal gas law. 

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Right. But how do I get density from that? Oh, right, density is mass per volume. So I think I can rearrange the ideal gas law to find the density.

Density (d) is mass (m) divided by volume (V), so d = m/V. But how does that tie into the ideal gas law? Oh, right, because n is moles, which is mass divided by molar mass. So maybe I can express n as m/M, where M is molar mass.

Rewriting the ideal gas equation: PV = (m/M) RT. So, solving for m/V: m/V = (P M) / (R T). That makes sense because m/V is density, so d = (P M) / (R T).

Alright, so now I need to plug in the values. Let me make sure I'm using the correct units. Pressure is given in mm Hg. Oh wait, I remember that 1 atm is 760 mm Hg. So 720 mm Hg is less than atmospheric pressure. I think I need to convert it to atmospheres because R is commonly 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So, 720 mmHg divided by 760 mmHg/atm equals approximately 0.947 atm. Let me calculate that: 720/760 is 0.947, yeah.

Temperature is 100°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin. Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So 100 + 273.15 equals 373.15 K.

The molar mass of CO2 is the atomic weight of carbon plus twice that of oxygen. Carbon is about 12 g/mol, oxygen is 16 each, so 12 + 2*16 = 44 g/mol.

Now, plug into the formula: d = (P * M) / (R T). R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So P is 0.947 atm, M is 44 g/mol. R is 0.0821, T is 373.15 K.

Calculating the numerator: 0.947 * 44 = let's see. 0.9 *44 is 39.6, 0.047*44 is about 2.068. So together, 41.668 approximately.

Denominator: 0.0821 * 373.15. Let's compute that. 0.08 * 373 is about 29.84, 0.0021 *373 ≈ 0.783. So total is roughly 30.623.

So density is 41.668 / 30.623 ≈ 1.36 g/L. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 1.32, which is close. But wait, maybe I approximated too much. Let me do more precise calculations.

Let me recalculate more accurately.

P = 720 /760 = 0.947368 atm.

M = 44 g/mol.

R = 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K).

T = 373.15 K.

So numerator: 0.947368 *44 = let's compute it as 0.947368 *44.

0.947368 *40 is 37.89472. 0.947368 *4 is 3.789472. Total: 37.89472 +3.789472 = 41.684192.

Denominator: 0.082057 *373.15.

Calculate 0.08 *373.15 = 29.852. 0.002057 *373.15 ≈ let's see. 0.002 *373.15 is 0.7463, 0.000057*373.15≈0.02126. So total denominator is approximately 29.852 + 0.7463 + 0.02126 ≈ 30.61956.

So density is 41.684192 / 30.61956 ≈ let's compute that. 30.61956 ×1.36 is approx 41.64 (since 30 *1.36 is 40.8, 0.61956 *1.36≈0.843). So 41.684 /30.61956 ≈ 1.36. So about 1.36 g/L.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.32. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exact numbers. Alternatively, maybe the ideal gas assumption isn't perfect for CO2 at these conditions. Wait, CO2 has a higher molar mass and at higher pressure or lower temperature, it might not behave ideally, but here the pressure is lower than 1 atm, so maybe it's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations without approximating. Let me try.

Compute denominator: 0.082057 *373.15 = ?

0.082057 *373.15:

373.15 * 0.08 = 29.852.

373.15 *0.002057 = let's compute:

373.15 ×0.002 = 0.7463.

373.15 ×0.000057 = approx 0.02126.

So 0.7463 +0.02126= 0.76756.

So total denominator is 29.852 + 0.76756 = 30.61956.

Numerator: 0.947368 *44 = let's calculate exactly.

44 ×0.947368 = ?

Well, 44 × 0.947368. Let me compute 44 ×0.9 =39.6, 44×0.04=1.76, 44×0.007368=0.324192. So 39.6 +1.76=41.36 +0.324192=41.684192.

So d =41.684192 /30.61956 ≈1.3608 g/L.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:1.32, but that's 0.04 lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Wait, CO2 is 12.01 + 2×16.00=44.01 g/mol. Oh, so M is 44.01, not 44. So numerator is 0.947368 ×44.01.

Compute that: 44 ×0.947368 is 41.684192, and 0.01 ×0.947368 is 0.00947368. So total is 41.693665.

So denominator is still 30.61956.

So 41.693665 /30.61956 ≈1.361 g/L.

Now, looking at the options, the closest is option C is 1.96, which is higher, A is 1.32. Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check if I used the correct value for R. Oh, wait! Did I remember R correctly? Because sometimes R is 0.0821, but sometimes I might confuse it with 0.08314 or other values.

Wait, R is 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K), so that should be correct.

Hmm, but wait, the ideal gas law might not be perfectly accurate for CO2 at this temperature and pressure. But I don't have any other data, so I proceed.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the molar mass correctly. Wait, 12.01 for C, 16.00 for O. So 12.01 + 2×16.00=44.01 g/mol. So M=44.01.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the pressure unit. Let me double-check. The pressure is 720 torr, which is 720/760 atm=0.947368 atm. Correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the use of 22.4 L/mol at STP (0°C and 1 atm), but that's for 0°C. Here the temperature is 100°C, so that approach wouldn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use d = (PM)/(RT), with all units matching.

Wait, another approach: the density of a gas can be compared to the density of another gas under known conditions, like air. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can think about the molar volume.

At 0°C and 1 atm, 1 mole is 22.4 L. But at higher temperatures, the volume per mole increases. So at 100°C (373 K), and 0.947 atm, the molar volume would be V = (RT)/P.

Wait, V per mole is RT/P. So for CO2, the molar volume would be (0.0821 *373.15)/0.947368. Let me compute that.

0.0821 *373.15 = approx 30.62 L·atm/mol.

So V =30.62 /0.947368 ≈32.32 L/mol.

So the density is molar mass divided by molar volume. M is 44.01 g/mol, so density is 44.01 /32.32 ≈1.361 g/L. Same as before.

So, the calculated density is approximately 1.36 g/L. Looking at the options, the closest one is A:1.32. But wait, perhaps the calculation is a bit off, maybe due to rounding. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:1.32

B:1.15

C:1.96

D:2.5

E:2.0

F:1.5

G:1.8

H:0.56

I:0.75

J:1.0

Hmm, 1.36 isn't exactly an option, but the closest is A:1.32. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, wait a second—did I correctly compute the pressure in atmospheres? Let's double-check.

720 mmHg ÷760 mmHg/atm = 720/760 = 0.947368 atm. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use R as 0.0821, which I did.

Wait, let me try using more exact numbers for R. R is 0.082057 L·atm/mol·K.

So, plugging in:

d = (P * M) / (R*T)

P=720/760 = 0.947368

M=44.01 g/mol

R=0.082057

T=373.15

So numerator: 0.947368 *44.01 = let's compute this precisely.

0.947368 *44 =41.684192

0.947368 *0.01=0.00947368

So total numerator=41.684192 +0.00947368 =41.6936658 g·atm/mol.

Denominator: 0.082057 *373.15 = let's compute.

0.082057 *373 = ?

0.08 *373 =29.84

0.002057 *373 = approx 0.002 *373=0.746, 0.000057*373≈0.021261. So 0.746 +0.021261=0.767261.

So total denominator=29.84 +0.767261 =30.607261 L·atm/K.

So d=41.6936658 /30.607261 ≈1.361 g/L.

So that's about 1.36 g/L.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:1.32. But wait, perhaps the actual calculation gives 1.32? Let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach or consider something else.

Wait, another thought: if the temperature is 100°C, which is higher than 25°C. The ideal gas law should still hold, but perhaps the given options are approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using different units. Wait, let me try the same calculation using different R value. Wait, sometimes R is expressed as 62.36 L·mmHg/mol·K. Let me try that approach.

Because the pressure is given in mmHg, so perhaps using R=62.36 would be better to avoid unit conversion errors.

So, R as 62.36 L·mmHg/mol·K.

So, the ideal gas equation is PV =nRT.

So, solving for density, d = (PM)/(RT).

Here, P is 720 mmHg, M is 44.01 g/mol, R is62.36, T is 373.15 K.

So, d = (720 *44.01) / (62.36 *373.15)

Compute numerator:720 *44.01= let's compute 700*44.01=30,807, 20*44.01=880.2 → total 31,687.2.

Denominator:62.36 *373.15. Let's compute 60*373.15=22,389, 2.36*373.15≈880.3 → total ≈23,269.3.

So, d=31,687.2 /23,269.3 ≈1.361 g/L.

Same result as before. So, 1.36 g/L.

But the options don't have 1.36. The closest is A:1.32. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, let me check R again. When using R =62.36 L·mmHg/(mol·K), then yes, P is in mmHg, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use grams per liter, which is the same as density in g/L, which I have.

Wait, perhaps I should check the molar mass again. CO2 is 12.01 + 16*2= 44.01 g/mol. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses 22.4 L/mol at STP. Let me think—STP is 0°C (273 K) and 1 atm. At STP, CO2's density would be (44.01 g/mol) / (22.4 L/mol) )=1.96 g/L. But that's at 0°C. At higher temperatures, the density decreases because the gas expands.

At 100°C, the temperature is higher, so the density should be lower than at STP. The STP density is 1.96 g/L, which is option C. But wait, our calculation at 100°C and 720 mmHg gave us around 1.36 g/L, which is less than 1.96. So the correct answer should be lower than 1.96, which it is.

Looking again at the options, the closest is A:1.32. But wait, perhaps I should consider that 720 mmHg is 720/760 = 0.947 atm. So the pressure is less than 1 atm, which would make the density lower. Wait, but in our calculation, at 1 atm, the density would be higher. Let me compute what the density would be at 1 atm and 373 K.

At 1 atm, d= (1 atm *44.01) / (0.082057 *373.15 ) ≈ (44.01) /(30.62)≈1.436 g/L.

Wait, so at 1 atm, the density is about 1.436 g/L. But in our problem, the pressure is less than 1 atm (0.947 atm), so the density should be less than that. So, 0.947/1 times 1.436 → approx 1.36, which matches our earlier calculation. So that makes sense.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.36. So perhaps the intended answer is A:1.32. But why the discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using the van der Waals equation because CO2 is a real gas, especially at higher pressures. But 720 mmHg is less than 1 atm, so maybe the ideal gas assumption is okay.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach. Let's calculate the molar volume at 720 mmHg and 373 K.

Molar volume V = (RT)/P.

R=0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

P=720/760 =0.947 atm.

So, V = (0.0821 *373.15) /0.947.

Calculate numerator:0.0821 *373.15 = 30.62 L·atm/mol.

So V=30.62 /0.947≈32.32 L/mol.

So density=44.01 g/mol /32.32 L/mol ≈1.361 g/L.

Same result again.

Looking at the options, I don't see 1.36. So perhaps the intended answer is A:1.32 g/L.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to use a different R value. Let me try R=0.08206.

Wait, let's compute it again with precise numbers.

P=720/760 = 0.947368421 atm.

M=44.01 g/mol.

R=0.082057 L·atm/mol·K.

T=373.15 K.

So,

d = (0.947368421 *44.01) / (0.082057 *373.15 )

Compute numerator:

0.947368421 ×44.01 = ?

Compute 0.947368421 ×44 =41.68419292.

0.947368421 ×0.01=0.009473684.

Total numerator=41.68419292 +0.009473684=41.6936666 g·atm/mol.

Denominator:0.082057 ×373.15.

Compute 0.082057 ×373 = ?

Calculate 373 ×0.08=29.84.

373 ×0.002057=0.767561.

So, 29.84 +0.767561=30.607561 L·atm/K.

So, d=41.6936666 /30.607561 ≈1.361 g/L.

So, 1.361 is the correct calculation, but the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct answer intended is A:1.32, but I'm getting 1.36. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait—could the pressure be in mmHg but I treated it as atm? Oh no, I did convert 720 mmHg to atm correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the density in different units, but no, the options are all in g
