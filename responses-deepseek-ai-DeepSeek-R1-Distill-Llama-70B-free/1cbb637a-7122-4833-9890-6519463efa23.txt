Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the time-domain response of a network using Fourier transform methods. The system function is given as (j2ω)/(1 + 2jω), and the input is V(t) = cos(t). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, I remember that when dealing with Fourier transforms, the output of a system is the product of the system function and the Fourier transform of the input. So, first, I need to find the Fourier transform of the input, which is cos(t). Oh wait, the question already provides that. It says that for a sinusoidal input cos(t), the Fourier transform is π[δ(ω +1) + δ(ω -1)]. That should make things easier.

So the Fourier transform of V(t) is V(ω) = π[δ(ω+1) + δ(ω-1)]. Now, the system function H(ω) is (j2ω)/(1 + 2jω). The output Fourier transform Y(ω) should be H(ω) multiplied by V(ω). 

Let me write that out: Y(ω) = H(ω) * V(ω) = [j2ω/(1 + 2jω)] * π[δ(ω+1) + δ(ω-1)]. 

Hmm, I need to compute this product. Since V(ω) is a sum of delta functions, I can split Y(ω) into two terms: one for δ(ω+1) and another for δ(ω-1).

So Y(ω) = π [ j2ω/(1 + 2jω) δ(ω+1) + j2ω/(1 + 2jω) δ(ω-1) ].

Wait, but delta functions have the property that δ(ω - a) f(ω) = f(a) δ(ω - a). So I can evaluate H(ω) at ω = -1 and ω = 1.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: when ω = -1.
H(-1) = j2*(-1) / [1 + 2j*(-1)] = (-j2)/(1 - 2j).
Hmm, I might need to simplify this. Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it.

Denominator's conjugate is (1 + 2j). So:

H(-1) = (-j2)(1 + 2j) / [ (1 - 2j)(1 + 2j) ].

The denominator becomes 1^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5.

Numerator: (-j2)(1) + (-j2)(2j) = -j2 -4j². Since j² is -1, this becomes -j2 -4(-1) = -j2 +4. So 4 - j2.

So H(-1) = (4 - j2)/5.

Similarly, the second term is at ω=1.

H(1) = j2*(1) / [1 + 2j(1)] = 2j/(1 + 2j).

Again, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - 2j):

H(1) = (2j)(1-2j) / [ (1 + 2j)(1 - 2j) ] = (2j -4j²)/5.

j² is -1, so 2j -4(-1) = 2j +4 =4 +2j.

Thus, H(1) = (4 + 2j)/5.

Wait, but in the Y(ω) expression, each term is H(ω) multiplied by the delta function. So putting it all together:

Y(ω) = π [ H(-1) δ(ω+1) + H(1) δ(ω-1) ].

Substituting H(-1) and H(1):

Y(ω) = π [ ( (4 - j2)/5 ) δ(ω+1) + ( (4 + 2j)/5 ) δ(ω-1) ) ].

But wait, delta functions are even, right? δ(ω+1) is the same as δ(ω-(-1)), so perhaps we can rewrite this in terms of magnitude and phase.

Alternatively, let me think about the inverse Fourier transform. Since Y(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω), and Y(ω) is a sum of delta functions, each at ω = -1 and 1, each scaled by their respective H(ω) values.

The inverse Fourier transform of a sum is the sum of the inverse transforms. So for each delta function, the inverse transform would be e^{jωt} multiplied by the coefficient.

But wait, in this case, the Fourier transform pairs are:

δ(ω - ω0) ↔ e^{jω0 t} * 2π. But in our case, the Fourier transform is π times the sum of deltas. So perhaps the scaling factors are a bit different.

Let me recall: The Fourier transform of cos(t) is π [ δ(ω+1)+δ(ω-1) ]. So the inverse would be (1/2π) times the integral of Y(ω) e^{jωt} dω.

Wait, but for Y(ω) being the product, perhaps I should compute the inverse transform directly.

Alternatively, since Y(ω) is a combination of delta functions at ω = ±1, each with their coefficients, the inverse Fourier transform should be a combination of complex exponentials.

So Y(t) would be the sum over each delta function's contribution. Let's compute each term.

First term: coefficient is (4 - j2)/5 multiplied by π, and δ(ω +1) → e^{-j(1)t} * (1/(2π)) when taking the inverse. Wait no, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the inverse Fourier transform is (1/(2π)) ∫ Y(ω) e^{jωt} dω.

So substituting Y(ω):

= (1/(2π)) * π [ H(-1) e^{j(-1)t} + H(1) e^{j(1)t} ]

The π cancels with 1/(2π), leaving 1/2.

So:

Y(t) = (1/2) [ H(-1) e^{-j t} + H(1) e^{j t} ]

Substituting H(-1) and H(1):

H(-1) = (4 - j2)/5, H(1) = (4 + j2)/5.

So:

Y(t) = (1/2) [ (4 - j2)/5 e^{-j t} + (4 + j2)/5 e^{j t} ]

Factor out 1/5:

= (1/10) [ (4 - j2) e^{-j t} + (4 + j2) e^{j t} ]

Now, let me expand each term using Euler's formula: e^{j t} = cos t + j sin t, and e^{-j t} = cos t - j sin t.

So compute each product:

(4 - j2)(cos t - j sin t) = 4 cos t -4j sin t -j2 cos t + j^2 2 sin t.

j^2 is -1, so that becomes 4 cos t -4j sin t -j2 cos t -2 sin t.

Similarly, (4 + j2)(cos t + j sin t) = 4 cos t +4j sin t + j2 cos t + j^2 2 sin t.

Which is 4 cos t +4j sin t +j2 cos t -2 sin t.

Now, add these two results together:

Term1: (4 cos t -4j sin t -j2 cos t -2 sin t) + (4 cos t +4j sin t +j2 cos t -2 sin t)

Let's combine like terms.

4 cos t +4 cos t = 8 cos t.

-4j sin t +4j sin t = 0.

-j2 cos t + j2 cos t =0.

-2 sin t -2 sin t = -4 sin t.

So the sum is 8 cos t -4 sin t.

Now, Y(t) is (1/10) multiplied by this sum:

Y(t) = (1/10)(8 cos t -4 sin t) = (8/10) cos t - (4/10) sin t.

Simplify the fractions:

8/10 = 4/5, 4/10 = 2/5.

So Y(t) = (4/5) cos t - (2/5) sin t.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (4/5) cos t - (2/5) sin t. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, wait, did I make a mistake in the inverse Fourier transform steps? Let me double-check.

When taking the inverse, I have Y(ω) = π [ H(-1) δ(ω+1) + H(1) δ(ω-1) ]

The inverse transform is (1/2π) ∫ Y(ω) e^{jωt} dω.

Which becomes (1/2) [ H(-1) e^{-j t} + H(1) e^{j t} ].

Then, substituting H(-1) and H(1), and expanding, yes, that led to 8 cos t -4 sin t over 10, which is 4/5 cos t - 2/5 sin t.

Looking at the options, option A is exactly that. So the correct answer should be A.

To find the time-domain response of the network, we use Fourier transform methods. The system function is given as \( H(\omega) = \frac{j2\omega}{1 + 2j\omega} \), and the input is \( V(t) = \cos(t) \), whose Fourier transform is \( V(\omega) = \pi[\delta(\omega + 1) + \delta(\omega - 1)] \).

The output Fourier transform \( Y(\omega) \) is the product of \( H(\omega) \) and \( V(\omega) \):

\[
Y(\omega) = H(\omega) \cdot V(\omega) = \frac{j2\omega}{1 + 2j\omega} \cdot \pi[\delta(\omega + 1) + \delta(\omega - 1)].
\]

Using the sifting property of delta functions, \( \delta(\omega - a)f(\omega) = f(a)\delta(\omega - a) \), we evaluate \( H(\omega) \) at \( \omega = -1 \) and \( \omega = 1 \):

1. At \( \omega = -1 \):
   \[
   H(-1) = \frac{j2(-1)}{1 + 2j(-1)} = \frac{-j2}{1 - 2j}.
   \]
   Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate \( 1 + 2j \):
   \[
   H(-1) = \frac{(-j2)(1 + 2j)}{(1 - 2j)(1 + 2j)} = \frac{-j2 - 4j^2}{1 + 4} = \frac{-j2 + 4}{5} = \frac{4 - j2}{5}.
   \]

2. At \( \omega = 1 \):
   \[
   H(1) = \frac{j2(1)}{1 + 2j(1)} = \frac{2j}{1 + 2j}.
   \]
   Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate \( 1 - 2j \):
   \[
   H(1) = \frac{(2j)(1 - 2j)}{(1 + 2j)(1 - 2j)} = \frac{2j - 4j^2}{1 + 4} = \frac{2j + 4}{5} = \frac{4 + 2j}{5}.
   \]

Substituting these results into \( Y(\omega) \):
\[
Y(\omega) = \pi \left[ \frac{4 - j2}{5} \delta(\omega + 1) + \frac{4 + 2j}{5} \delta(\omega - 1) \right].
\]

To find the time-domain response \( Y(t) \), we compute the inverse Fourier transform of \( Y(\omega) \). Using the inverse Fourier transform formula and the fact that \( \delta(\omega \pm 1) \) corresponds to \( e^{\pm j t} \), we get:
\[
Y(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ H(-1)e^{-jt} + H(1)e^{jt} \right].
\]

Substituting \( H(-1) = \frac{4 - j2}{5} \) and \( H(1) = \frac{4 + 2j}{5} \):
\[
Y(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{4 - j2}{5} e^{-jt} + \frac{4 + 2j}{5} e^{jt} \right].
\]

Expanding \( e^{-jt} \) and \( e^{jt} \) using Euler's formula \( e^{\pm jt} = \cos(t) \mp j\sin(t) \):
\[
Y(t) = \frac{1}{10} \left[ (4 - j2)(\cos(t) - j\sin(t)) + (4 + 2j)(\cos(t) + j\sin(t)) \right].
\]

Simplifying the terms:
\[
(4 - j2)(\cos(t) - j\sin(t)) = 4\cos(t) - 4j\sin(t) - j2\cos(t) + 2\sin(t),
\]
\[
(4 + 2j)(\cos(t) + j\sin(t)) = 4\cos(t) + 4j\sin(t) + j2\cos(t) - 2\sin(t).
\]

Adding these results:
\[
8\cos(t) - 4\sin(t).
\]

Thus:
\[
Y(t) = \frac{1}{10}(8\cos(t) - 4\sin(t)) = \frac{4}{5}\cos(t) - \frac{2}{5}\sin(t).
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is **A: \( \frac{4}{5}\cos(t) - \frac{2}{5}\sin(t) \)**.
