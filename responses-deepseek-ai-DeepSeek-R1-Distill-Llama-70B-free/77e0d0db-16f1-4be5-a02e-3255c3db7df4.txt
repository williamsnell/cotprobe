Okay, so I have this question about bond pricing, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the price of a five-year bond with a face value of $100 that pays no coupons, and its yield is 4%. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that bonds have face value, coupon payments, and yield. Since this bond pays no coupons, it's probably a zero-coupon bond. Right, zero-coupon bonds don't make periodic interest payments; instead, they're sold at a discount and mature at face value.

So, the key here is to calculate the present value of the bond. Since there are no coupon payments, the only cash flow is the face value at maturity. The formula for the price of a zero-coupon bond is present value, which is Face Value divided by (1 + yield)^time.

Let me write that down. The formula is: Price = FV / (1 + r)^n.

Where FV is the face value, r is the yield, and n is the number of years. 

Given in the question: FV is $100, r is 4% or 0.04, and n is 5 years.

Plugging in the numbers: Price = 100 / (1 + 0.04)^5.

I need to calculate (1.04)^5. I might have to compute this step by step because I don't remember the exact value off the top of my head.

Let me calculate 1.04 to the power of 5.

First, 1.04 squared is 1.0816.

Then, 1.0816 multiplied by 1.04 again (for the third power): 1.0816 * 1.04.

Let me compute that. 1.0816 * 1.04. 

1 * 1.04 is 1.04, 0.0816 * 1.04 is approximately 0.084864. Adding them together gives 1.04 + 0.084864 = 1.124864. So that's 1.04^3 ≈ 1.124864.

Now for the fourth power: multiply this by 1.04 again.

1.124864 * 1.04. Let's break it down. 1 * 1.04 is 1.04, 0.124864 * 1.04 is approximately 0.12 * 1.04 = 0.1248, and 0.004864 * 1.04 is about 0.00506. So adding those: 0.1248 + 0.00506 ≈ 0.12986. So total is 1.04 + 0.12986 = 1.16986. So 1.04^4 ≈ 1.16986.

Now the fifth power: multiply by 1.04 once more.

1.16986 * 1.04. Let's compute:

1 * 1.04 = 1.04.

0.16986 * 1.04. Let's see, 0.1 *1.04=0.104, 0.06*1.04=0.0624, 0.00986*1.04≈0.01026. Adding them: 0.104+0.0624=0.1664 + 0.01026≈0.17666.

So total is 1.04 + 0.17666 = 1.21666. So approximately, 1.04^5 is about 1.2166529 (I think I've seen that exact number before, so maybe around 1.21665).

Wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator approach, but since I don't have one, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, I remember that (1.04)^5 is approximately 1.2166529.

So, using that, the denominator is 1.2166529.

So the price is 100 divided by 1.2166529.

Let me compute that. 100 / 1.2166529.

Well, 1.21665 is roughly 1.21665. Let me see, 1/1.21665 is approximately 0.8219. Because 1.21665 times 0.8219 is about 1.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me do 1.21665 * 0.82.

1.21665 * 0.8 = 0.97332.

1.21665 * 0.02 = 0.024333.

So 0.97332 + 0.024333 = 0.99765. So 0.82 gives us 0.99765, which is very close to 1. So 0.82 is approximately 1/1.21665.

So 100 / 1.21665 ≈ 82. So the price is approximately $82.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another approach: I know that 1/(1.04)^5 is the present value factor. Let me think of it as the present value interest factor of a perpetuity at 4% for 5 years.

Alternatively, I can use logarithms or another approximation, but maybe I can just calculate 100 / 1.2166529 more accurately.

Let me do a division: 100 ÷ 1.2166529.

Let me set it up as 100 / 1.2166529.

Well, 1.2166529 × 82 = ?

Calculate 1.2166529 × 80 = 97.3323.

1.2166529 × 2 = 2.4333058.

So 97.3323 + 2.4333058 = 99.7656058.

So 82 × 1.2166529 = ~99.7656, which is less than 100. The difference is 100 - 99.7656 = 0.2344.

So how much more than 82 do we need to get to 100? Let me find x such that 1.2166529 × (82 + x) = 100.

We have x = (100 - 99.7656)/1.2166529 = 0.2344 / 1.2166529 ≈ 0.1926.

So 82 + 0.1926 is approximately 82.1926. So the price is approximately $82.19.

So the bond should be priced around $82.19.

Looking at the options, option E is $82, which is the closest to our calculation.

To determine the price of a five-year, zero-coupon bond with a face value of $100 and a yield of 4%, we use the formula for the price of a zero-coupon bond:

\[
\text{Price} = \frac{\text{Face Value}}{(1 + \text{Yield})^{\text{Time}}}
\]

Here, the face value (\(FV\)) is $100, the yield (\(r\)) is 4% or 0.04, and the time (\(n\)) is 5 years. Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Price} = \frac{100}{(1 + 0.04)^5}
\]

First, calculate \((1 + 0.04)^5\). Using approximations:

\[
(1.04)^2 = 1.0816, \quad (1.04)^3 \approx 1.124864, \quad (1.04)^4 \approx 1.16986, \quad (1.04)^5 \approx 1.2166529
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Price} = \frac{100}{1.2166529} \approx 82.19
\]

The closest option to this calculated price is $82, which corresponds to option E.
