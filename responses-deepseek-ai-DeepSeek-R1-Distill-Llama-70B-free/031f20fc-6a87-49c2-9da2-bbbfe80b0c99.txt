The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Over the years, a coin collector had amassed a large and valuable collection. On May 1, the collector sent the following letter to a retailer who had long coveted the collector's coin collection:"I've decided to part with my coin collection. Since you've always been interested in purchasing my collection for your store, I'll sell you my entire collection for $50,000. You have until May 15 to make up your mind. "The retailer received this letter on May 3. On May 10, without notif'ing the retailer, the collector sold her coin collection to a novice collector, for $60,000. The next day, the collector sent a letter to the retailer, regretfully informing him that she had sold the coin collection. This letter was received by the retailer on May 13. However, on May 12, the retailer read an article on the internet, published by a reputable site that reports coin collecting news, concerning the collector's sale of her coin collection to the novice collector. After reading the article, the retailer immediately sent an e-mail to the collector accepting her offer to buy the coin collection. This e-mail was read by the collector that same afternoon, May 12. In all likelihood was the retailer's e-mail to the collector on May 12 effective as an acceptance?

Options:

A: No, because the retailer should have responded to the initial letter before the collection was sold to the novice collector.
B: No, because the collector had already sold the collection before the retailer's acceptance, making it invalid.
C: No, because the retailer's acceptance was not valid as the collection had already been sold.
D: Yes, because the retailer's knowledge of the sale to the novice collector was not confirmed until after he sent his acceptance e-mail.
E: Yes, because the retailer's acceptance was made within the specified timeframe.
F: No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.
G: Yes, because consideration is not necessary under the UCC for the creation of a sale of goods contract.
H: Yes, because the collector's May 11 letter did not effectuate a revocation, since it was not received by the retailer until May 13.
I: Yes, because the retailer's e-mail was sent before receiving the collector's May 11 letter.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contracts question about offer and acceptance. Let me start by going through the facts step by step to understand what's happening.

So, the collector sent a letter to the retailer on May 1 offering to sell the coin collection for $50,000. The letter says the retailer has until May 15 to decide. The retailer got the letter on May 3. Then, without telling the retailer, the collector sold the collection to a novice collector for $60,000 on May 10. The next day, May 11, the collector sent a letter to the retailer informing him that she sold it, which the retailer received on May 13. However, on May 12, the retailer read an article online about the sale to the novice collector. After reading that, the retailer immediately sent an email accepting the offer. The collector read this email on the same day, May 12.

The question is whether the retailer's email on May 12 was an effective acceptance.

Hmm, I remember that for a contract, you need an offer, acceptance, and consideration. The key issues here are about when the offer was revoked and whether the acceptance was timely.

The offer was open until May 15, so it's a firm offer in a way. But the collector tried to revoke it by selling the collection to someone else before that date. Wait, but when does revocation happen? I think the offeror can revoke an offer before acceptance, but if the offer was made with a fixed time, the revocation might not be effective if done after the offeree has relied on it or if it's an option.

Wait, the offer here wasn't an option because the collector didn't receive any consideration to keep the offer open. So, it's a revocable offer. The general rule is that offers can be revoked any time before acceptance, even if the offer says it's open until a certain date, unless it's an option.

But wait, under the UCC, which applies here because it's a sale of goods, there's something about firm offers. UCC ยง2-205 says that an offer by a merchant is firm if it's in writing and includes some specific assurances, like that it's firm or that it's made with the intent not to revoke. If the offer meets those criteria, then it can't be revoked for the stated period.

In this case, the collector sent a letter offering to sell to the retailer, who is also a merchant because they run a store. So, the offer was in writing. The letter says, "I've decided to part with my collection. Since you've always been interested, I'll sell you my entire collection for $50,000. You have until May 15 to make up your mind." So, it's a written offer by a merchant (assuming the collector is a merchant? Wait, no, the collector is a collector, not necessarily in the business of selling coins. Wait, the offeror is the collector, and the offeree is the retailer. So, the offeror's status matters. If the collector is not a merchant, then the firm offer rules under UCC may not apply. Because UCC ยง2-205 applies to offers made by merchants. So if the collector is not a merchant, then the offer isn't firm, and she can revoke it before May 15.

Wait, but the offer was made to a merchant (the retailer). But the firm offer applies when the offeror is a merchant. So if the collector isn't a merchant, then her offer isn't firm, and she can revoke it before May 15.

So, in this case, the collector tried to revoke the offer by selling the collection to someone else on May 10. But the question is whether the offer was revoked before the retailer accepted.

Wait, but the offer was revoked when the collector sold it to the novice on May 10, but the problem is whether the revocation was effective before the retailer accepted.

Alternatively, the issue might be about the method of revocation. The collector didn't directly communicate the revocation to the retailer; instead, she sent a letter on May 11, which the retailer got on May 13. But the retailer found out about the sale through the article on May 12.

So, the revocation can be effective when the offeree (retailer) learns about it, but in this case, the retailer didn't know from the collector directly until May 13. However, the retailer learned through the article on May 12, which caused him to send the acceptance email that same day.

Wait, but if the offer was revoked on May 10 when the collector sold it, then any acceptance after that would be too late. Because once the offer is revoked, the offeree can't accept it anymore.

But the revocation isn't effective until it's communicated to the offeree, right? Because the general rule is that revocation is effective upon communication. So, if the collector sent a revocation letter on May 11, which the retailer received on May 13, then the revocation would be effective when the retailer got it on May 13. But if the retailer accepted before that, then the acceptance would still be valid.

Wait, but the collector didn't just send a revocation; she sold the goods to another party on May 10. So, under the doctrine of "prior sale," does that revoke the offer? Or does the revocation occur when the offeree learns about it?

I think that when an offeror sells the goods to another, that's a revocation of the offer. But the revocation is only effective when it's communicated to the offeree. So, in this case, the collector's sale to the novice on May 10 revokes the offer, but the revocation isn't effective until the retailer knows or has reason to know about it.

The retailer found out about the sale through the article on May 12, which is before the collector's letter arrived. So, the question is whether the retailer's knowledge from the article constitutes effective revocation.

Alternatively, under the UCC, when goods are sold, the offer is revoked when the offeree learns of the sale. So, when the retailer read the article on May 12, he learned that the collection was sold, which would mean the offer was revoked at that point.

But wait, the article was on the internet, and the collector didn't send a revocation directly. So, does the retailer's knowledge from a third-party source count as revocation?

I think that yes, because under the rule, if the offeree learns about the revocation through a reliable source, even if it's not directly from the offeror, the revocation is effective. So, when the retailer read the article on May 12, he knew the offer was revoked, so his acceptance by email on the same day would be too late.

Wait, but the email was sent on May 12, after reading the article. So, if the revocation was effective when the retailer learned about it, then the acceptance after that would not be effective because the offer was already revoked.

But wait, in the scenario, the collector sent the revocation letter on May 11, which arrived on May 13. However, the retailer found out earlier through the article. So, the key point is whether the offer was revoked when the collector sold the goods, making any subsequent acceptance invalid, regardless of the retailer's knowledge.

Alternatively, the offer could be revoked when the collector sold the goods, but the revocation isn't effective until communicated. So, if the retailer accepted before receiving the revocation, then the acceptance is valid.

Wait, but in the case where the offeror sells the goods, that's a revocation, and the revocation is effective when the offeree learns about it. So, when the retailer read the article on May 12, the offer was revoked as of that moment, so his email sent on May 12 after reading the article would be after revocation, making the acceptance ineffective.

But wait, the email was sent on May 12, same day as reading the article. So, the timing is crucial. If the retailer read the article in the morning and then sent the email in the afternoon, then the revocation had already occurred when he read the article, so the acceptance would be too late.

Alternatively, if the acceptance was sent before the revocation was effective, it would still be valid. But in this case, the acceptance was sent after the retailer knew about the revocation.

Wait, but the offer was revoked when the collector sold the collection on May 10. So, any acceptance after that would be ineffective because the offer was no longer open. But again, revocation is effective upon communication. So, until the retailer knew or had reason to know, the offer was still open.

So, the issue is whether the retailer's knowledge from the article counts as the revocation being communicated.

I think that yes, because the article is a reliable source, so when the retailer learned about the sale, the offer was revoked as far as he was concerned. Therefore, when he sent the acceptance email after learning about it, the offer was already revoked, making the acceptance ineffective.

Wait, but another angle: the collector sent a revocation letter on May 11, which arrived on May 13. So, the question is whether the revocation was effective on May 11 when the letter was sent, or when it was received.

Under the mail box rule, revocation is effective upon receipt, not upon sending. So, the revocation in the letter would take effect on May 13 when the retailer received it. However, the retailer learned about the revocation earlier through the article, which would make the offer revoked earlier.

So, when the retailer read the article on May 12, he knew about the revocation, so his acceptance email sent that same day would be after the revocation. Therefore, the acceptance was too late, making it ineffective.

So, looking at the options:

Option F says: No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.

Yes, that seems to fit, because upon learning about the sale, the offer was revoked, so the power to accept was terminated.

Option B says: No, because the collector had already sold the collection before the retailer's acceptance, making it invalid.

That's also a possible answer, but the reasoning might be slightly different. It's about the offer being revoked when the sale happened, regardless of the retailer's knowledge.

But I think the more precise reason is that the retailer learned of the revocation (through the article) before sending the acceptance, which terminated his power to accept.

So, option F would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option H says: Yes, because the collector's May 11 letter did not effectuate a revocation, since it was not received by the retailer until May 13.

That would support the idea that revocation is effective upon receipt, so the acceptance on May 12 would still be valid because the revocation via letter arrived later. But that ignores the fact that the retailer learned about the revocation through another source earlier.

So, which takes precedence: the actual receipt of the revocation letter, or the knowledge through another means?

I think that under the UCC, the offeror's conduct (like selling the goods) can revoke the offer even without direct communication, if the offeree learns about it from another source. So, in this case, the offer was revoked when the retailer found out through the article, regardless of when the letter arrived.

Therefore, the correct answer would be F: No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.

Alternatively, another option could be B: No, because the collector had already sold the collection before the retailer's acceptance, making it invalid. But B focuses on the sale happening before the acceptance, which is true, but the reasoning could be that the offer was revoked upon the sale, making the acceptance ineffective regardless of the retailer's knowledge.

Wait, but the timing here is that the sale was on May 10, the acceptance was on May 12. So, the sale happened before the acceptance. But the issue is whether the offer was still open at the time of acceptance. If the offer was revoked when the collector sold the goods, then the acceptance is invalid.

But under common law, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, even if the offer states it's open until a certain date. So, the collector revoked the offer by selling the goods on May 10, making the offer no longer open. Therefore, when the retailer tried to accept on May 12, the offer was already revoked, so the acceptance was invalid.

So, this would also support option B as correct.

Wait, but the UCC has specific rules about firm offers. If the offer wasn't a firm offer, then the collector could revoke it anytime before acceptance, even before May 15. So, in that case, the sale on May 10 would revoke the offer, making the acceptance on May 12 ineffective.

But earlier I thought that under UCC, the offer was not firm because the offeror (collector) may not be a merchant. So, the offer could be revoked at any time before acceptance, regardless of the May 15 deadline. So, the sale on May 10 would effectively revoke the offer, making any subsequent acceptance invalid.

In that case, option B would be correct because the collector sold it before the acceptance, making the acceptance invalid.

But wait, the timing of the revocation's effectiveness is important. If the offer was revoked when the collector sold it on May 10, then any acceptance after that is too late, regardless of the retailer's knowledge. Because the offer was no longer open.

Wait, but that's only if the revocation was effective at the time of the sale. But I thought revocation is effective when communicated. So, if the offeror sells the goods, that's a revocation, but it's not effective until the offeree knows or has reason to know.

So, if the collector sold the goods on May 10, but the retailer didn't know until May 12 via the article, then the revocation is effective on May 12. So, the acceptance on May 12 after reading the article would be after revocation, making it invalid.

But if the revocation is effective when the sale happens, regardless of the offeree's knowledge, then any acceptance after May 10 would be invalid, even if the offeree didn't know yet.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.

Under the common law, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance. The revocation is effective when it's communicated to the offeree. If the offeror does an act that constitutes revocation (like selling the goods to another), that's a revocation, but it's effective only when the offeree learns about it.

So, in this case, the collector's sale to the novice on May 10 revoked the offer. But the revocation is only effective when the retailer finds out. So, the retailer found out on May 12 via the article. Therefore, the revocation became effective on May 12, and the acceptance sent on May 12 after that would be too late.

Alternatively, if the revocation is effective when the act is done (sale on May 10), then the acceptance on May 12 is after the revocation, making it invalid regardless of the retailer's knowledge.

I think the correct approach is that the revocation is effective when the offeree learns about it. So, the offer was revoked when the retailer found out on May 12, making the acceptance sent that same day too late.

Wait, but the email was sent on May 12, same day as the retailer read the article. So, if the retailer read the article and then sent the email, that would be after the revocation. Therefore, the acceptance is too late.

So, the answer would be that the acceptance was not effective because the offer was revoked when the retailer learned about the sale, which was on May 12.

Looking back at the options, option F says: No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.

Yes, that fits because the power to accept ended when the retailer learned of the revocation.

Another option is B: No, because the collector had already sold the collection before the retailer's acceptance, making it invalid.

But B doesn't mention the timing of the retailer's knowledge, which is crucial here. The key is when the revocation became effective, which is when the retailer knew about it. So, F seems more accurate.

Wait, but another point: the collector sent a revocation letter on May 11, which was received on May 13. So, the revocation via letter would take effect on May 13, but the retailer learned earlier via the article on May 12. So, which one counts?

I think that once the retailer learned about the revocation through the article, the offer was revoked as far as he was concerned. So, the acceptance sent after that would be invalid, regardless of when the letter arrived.

So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but what's the rule under UCC? Let me think. UCC ยง2-206(1) says that an offer can be accepted by any reasonable means, but the time of acceptance is when the offeree sends it or when it's received, depending on the circumstances.

But for revocation, UCC ยง2-206 also says that revocation is effective when received. However, when the offeror does something inconsistent, like selling the goods, that's a revocation, and the offeree's knowledge of that act would terminate the power to accept.

So, when the retailer learned about the sale through the article, that's when the revocation became effective. So, the acceptance sent after that is too late.

Therefore, the answer is F.
</think>

The collector sent a letter to the retailer on May 1 offering to sell her coin collection for $50,000, giving the retailer until May 15 to respond. The retailer received the letter on May 3. On May 10, the collector sold the collection to a novice collector for $60,000 without notifying the retailer. The next day, May 11, the collector sent a letter informing the retailer of the sale, which the retailer received on May 13. However, on May 12, the retailer read an article on the internet about the sale to the novice collector and immediately sent an email accepting the collector's offer. The collector read the email that same day, May 12.

The key issue is whether the retailer's email acceptance on May 12 was effective. For an acceptance to be valid, the offer must still be open at the time of acceptance. The collector's sale of the collection to the novice collector on May 10 constituted a revocation of the offer. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), an offer can be revoked by the offeror's conduct inconsistent with the offer, such as selling the goods to another party. However, revocation is generally effective only when the offeree learns of it or has reason to know about it.

In this case, the retailer learned about the revocation through the article on May 12. This knowledge terminated the retailer's power to accept the offer. The acceptance email sent by the retailer on May 12, after reading the article, was therefore too late, as the offer had already been revoked.

Option F correctly states that the retailer's reading of the article on May
