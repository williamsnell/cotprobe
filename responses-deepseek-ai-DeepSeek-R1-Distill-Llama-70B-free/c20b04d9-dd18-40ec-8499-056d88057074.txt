Okay, so I've got this question about stopping times and whether certain operations on them result in stopping times. I'm a bit rusty on my stochastic calculus, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about three cases: whether the sum T1 + T2 is a stopping time, whether the maximum of T1 and T2 is, and whether the minimum is. Each case needs to be answered with 1 for yes and 0 for no.

First, I need to remember what a stopping time is. A stopping time T with respect to a filtration F is a random time such that for every t ≥ 0, the event {T ≤ t} belongs to F_t. In simpler terms, at any time t, we can determine whether T has occurred based on the information available up to time t.

Now, let's tackle each case one by one.

1. **Sum of T1 and T2**: So, T1 + T2. Wait, but T1 and T2 are stopping times. Does adding them together preserve the stopping time property? Hmm. I'm not too sure, but I think this might not necessarily be a stopping time. Because suppose T1 and T2 are both stopping times, but their sum could potentially be larger than either. The problem is that the event {T1 + T2 ≤ t} might not be in F_t. Because to know whether T1 + T2 has occurred by time t, you might need to know more than what's available at time t. Like, if T1 is t and T2 is something else, adding them might take you beyond t. Or wait, maybe it's about whether the sum exceeds t. I'm getting a bit confused. I think the sum isn't necessarily a stopping time. So maybe the answer is no, so 0.

Wait, but another angle: Suppose T1 and T2 are both bounded, or at least, for each t, the event T1 + T2 ≤ t is in F_t. But in reality, the sum could be tricky because you might need information beyond t to know if the sum has occurred. For example, if T1 is a stopping time and T2 is another, then T1 + T2 could be greater than t even if T1 is known by t. But since T2 could be anything, including beyond t, the sum might not be a stopping time. So I think the sum is not a stopping time. So the first answer is 0.

2. **Maximum of T1 and T2**: max(T1, T2). I think this is a stopping time. Because the event {max(T1, T2) ≤ t} is the same as {T1 ≤ t and T2 ≤ t}. Since both T1 and T2 are stopping times, their joint occurrence (both being ≤ t) would be in the intersection of F_t, which is still in F_t. So the maximum should be a stopping time. So the second answer is 1.

3. **Minimum of T1 and T2**: min(T1, T2). Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. Let's think: the event {min(T1, T2) ≤ t} is equivalent to {T1 ≤ t or T2 ≤ t}. Since T1 and T2 are stopping times, each individual event {T1 ≤ t} and {T2 ≤ t} are in F_t. The union of these two events would be in F_t as well because F_t is a sigma-algebra. So yes, the minimum should also be a stopping time. So the third answer is 1.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the minimum. If min(T1, T2) ≤ t, that means at least one of T1 or T2 is ≤ t. Since each of these are stopping times, their occurrence is known by time t. So the union is in F_t. So yes, min is a stopping time.

So putting it all together: The sum is not, so 0; max is yes, 1; min is yes, 1. So the list would be [0,1,1].

Looking at the options, option E is [0,1,1].

To determine whether the sum, maximum, and minimum of two stopping times \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are also stopping times, we analyze each case:

1. **Sum (\( T_1 + T_2 \))**: The event \(\{T_1 + T_2 \leq t\}\) depends on the joint behavior of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \). Since \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are stopping times, knowing whether \( T_1 + T_2 \leq t \) may require information beyond \( F_t \). Thus, \( T_1 + T_2 \) is not necessarily a stopping time. The answer is 0.

2. **Maximum (\( \max(T_1, T_2) \))**: The event \(\{\max(T_1, T_2) \leq t\}\) is equivalent to \(\{T_1 \leq t \text{ and } T_2 \leq t\}\). Since \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are stopping times, their intersection is in \( F_t \). Therefore, \( \max(T_1, T_2) \) is a stopping time. The answer is 1.

3. **Minimum (\( \min(T_1, T_2) \))**: The event \(\{\min(T_1, T_2) \leq t\}\) is equivalent to \(\{T_1 \leq t \text{ or } T_2 \leq t\}\). Since \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are stopping times, their union is in \( F_t \). Thus, \( \min(T_1, T_2) \) is a stopping time. The answer is 1.

Combining these results, the answers are \([0, 1, 1]\).

The correct option is **E**.
