Okay, so I've got this problem here about three researchers determining the gas constant R. Hmm, I remember that R is a key constant in the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Right, so each researcher is working with 1 mole of gas at 273 K, but they're measuring different things. I need to figure out what each one's value for R would be.

Let me break it down. The first researcher found that at 1 atm pressure, the volume is 22.4 liters. Wait, isn't that the molar volume at STP? Because STP is 1 atm and 273 K, and one mole is 22.4 L. So using PV = nRT, since n is 1 mole, T is 273, P is 1 atm, V is 22.4 L.

So plugging in the values: R = (P V) / (n T). Oh wait, no, wait. Rearranged, R = PV/(nT). So 1 atm * 22.4 L divided by 1 mole * 273 K. Let me compute that. 22.4 divided by 273. Let's see, 22.4/273 is approximately 0.082. Oh wait, that's 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K), right? So the first researcher's R is 0.0821, which is option A's first part.

The second researcher also used 22.4 L but at 760 torr. Wait, 760 torr is equal to 1 atm, right? Because standard pressure is 1 atm = 760 mmHg or torr. So in this case, P is 760 torr. But wait, if I use R = PV/(nT), but the units here are in torr instead of atm. Oh, but wait, in that case, the units would change.

Wait, no, wait. The second researcher's pressure is 760 torr. So if he's using PV = nRT, but his P is in torr, then to find R in terms of (l·torr)/(mol·K). But the question is about the value of R each got. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, let me think. The first researcher's R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). The second researcher has the same volume (22.4 L) but pressure in torr. So what's the R here? Because if you use P in torr, then R would be in L·torr/(mol·K). But 1 atm is 760 torr, so 1 atm = 760 torr. So if P is 760 torr, then R would be (760 torr * 22.4 L) / (1 * 273 K) = let's compute that: 760 *22.4 = 17,024. Then divide by 273. 17,024 /273 is approximately 62.36 L·torr/(mol·K). Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question is asking what value each researcher determined. So each is calculating R based on their own measurements. So the second researcher's pressure is 760 torr. So for him, P = 760 torr, V=22.4 L. So R = (760 * 22.4) / (1 *273). Let me compute that: 760 *22.4 is 17,024. 17,024 divided by 273 is approximately 62.36 L·torr/(mol·K). But that's not one of the options given. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options for each researcher are in terms of (l·atm)/(K·mol) and cal/(mol·K). So perhaps the second researcher, when using torr, is getting the same R in different units. Alternatively, perhaps the second researcher converted the pressure to atm?

Wait, the second researcher's pressure is 760 torr, which is 1 atm. Oh wait, that's the same as the first researcher. So if pressure in atm is 1, then why is the second researcher's R different? Wait maybe I'm misreading.

Wait, no, the first researcher found a pressure of 1 atm, V=22.4 L. So R is (1 atm *22.4 L)/ (1*273) = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). The second researcher found the same volume but at 760 torr. But 760 torr is 1 atm, so same as the first researcher. So why would the second researcher's R be different? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps in the second case, the researcher measured the pressure in torr but didn't convert it to atm. So they used P in torr, and V in liters, but didn't convert P to atm. So their R would be in (L·torr)/(K·mol). But the options are in terms of L·atm/(K·mol) and cal/(mol·K). Hmm.

Wait, but the problem statement says each researcher is determining R. So the first one uses P=1 atm, V=22.4 L, T=273 K. So R is 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol). The second researcher uses P=760 torr, V=22.4 L, T=273 K. So R would be (760 torr *22.4 L) / (273 K * 1 mole) = (16904) / 273 = approx 61.96 L·torr/(K·mol). But since 1 atm = 760 torr, 1 L·atm is 760 L·torr. So to convert R from L·torr to L·atm, you divide by 760. So 61.96 / 760 is approximately 0.0816, which is close to 0.0821. So perhaps the second researcher's R in L·atm/(K·mol) is the same as the first, 0.0821. But that can't be right because the options suggest the second researcher's R is 1.99.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the units. Let me think about another approach. Maybe the second researcher didn't convert torr to atm, so their calculation of R would have different units. But the options are in terms of L·atm and cal. So perhaps the second researcher's R is 1.99 L·atm/(K·mol). Wait, how?

Wait, 1 atm = 760 torr. So 760 torr is 1 atm. So if the second researcher's pressure is 760 torr, that's 1 atm. So their calculation would give R as (1 atm * 22.4 L) / (273 K) = 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol). So both first and second researchers would have the same R. But looking at the options, some have the same for first and second, others don't.

Wait the third researcher reported the product of pressure and volume as 542 cal. So PV = 542 cal. Since n is 1 mole and T is 273 K, R would be PV/(nT) = 542 cal / (273 K). Because n is 1, so R = 542 / 273 cal/(mol·K). Let's calculate that: 542 ÷ 273. 273 * 2 is 546, so 542 is about 2 less. So 542/273 ≈ 1.985, which is approximately 1.99 cal/(mol·K).

So third researcher's R is 1.99 cal/(mol·K). Now, the options are looking for what each researcher got.

First researcher: R = 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol).

Second researcher: Wait, wait, earlier confusion arises. Because the second researcher's P is 760 torr. If he uses that without converting to atm, then his R would be in different units. But the options have the second researcher's R as 1.99 in some cases. Alternatively, perhaps the second researcher's R is also 0.0821, because 760 torr is 1 atm, so same as first.

Wait, but the second researcher's pressure is 760 torr. So if he uses that, and volume is 22.4 L, then R = (760 torr *22.4 L) / (273 K *1 mole) = (16904 torr·L) / (273 K·mol). But 1 atm = 760 torr, so 760 torr·L = 1 atm·L. So (760 *22.4) torr·L = (1 atm * 22.4 L). So in terms of units, 760 torr *22.4 L = 22.4 L·atm. So R would be 22.4 /273 = 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol). So same as first researcher.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options suggest that the second researcher's R is different. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the second researcher didn't convert the pressure to atm, so he kept it in torr, and thus his R is in different units.

Wait, but the question is about each researcher's determined value for R. So the first uses atm, so R is 0.0821. The second uses torr, so R is 62.36 L·torr/(mol·K). But the options don't mention torr. Only in terms of l·atm and cal.

Wait, perhaps the second researcher converted torr to atm but made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the second researcher found pressure in torr but used the ideal gas law without converting units, leading to a different value for R.

Alternatively, another approach. Since the third researcher's R is 1.99 cal/(mol·K), that's because they used the product PV in cal. So how does that relate to the other R values?

Wait, I know that 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 joules, and 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules. So 1 L·atm ≈ 24.217 cal. So R in cal units would be 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol) multiplied by 24.217 cal/(L·atm) to get cal/(mol·K). 0.0821 *24.217 is approximately 2.0 cal/(mol·K), which matches the third researcher's R=1.99.

So the third researcher's R is 1.99 cal/(mol·K), which is about 2. So that's correct.

So the first and second researcher, if they used pressure in atm, their R is 0.0821. But the second researcher's pressure is in torr, which is 760 torr = 1 atm. So their calculated R should be same as first's, 0.0821. But looking at the options, some options have the second researcher as 1.99, which can't be right. Unless I'm misunderstanding the second researcher's approach.

Wait, the second researcher's pressure is 760 torr. So if he uses that pressure without converting to atm, then his R would be in terms of torr. But none of the options have that. So perhaps the second researcher's R is the same as the first, 0.0821.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have the second researcher as 1.99. That can't be unless they made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculations more carefully.

First researcher:

P = 1 atm, V=22.4 L, T=273 K, n=1.

R = (1 atm *22.4 L) / (273 K *1 mol) = 22.4 /273 = 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K). So approximately 0.0821.

Second researcher:

P=760 torr, V=22.4 L, T=273 K, n=1.

If he uses R = PV/(nT) without converting torr to atm:

R = (760 torr *22.4 L) / (273 K *1 mol) = (760 *22.4) /273.

760 *22.4 = let's compute that. 700 *22.4 = 15680, 60*22.4=1344. So 15680 +1344= 17024. Then 17024 /273 = approximately 62.36 L·torr/(mol·K).

But since 1 atm =760 torr, 1 L·atm =760 L·torr. So to convert L·torr/(mol·K) to L·atm/(mol·K), divide by 760.

So 62.36 /760 ≈ 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K). So same as first researcher.

So if the second researcher did the conversion correctly, his R would be same as first, 0.0821. But if he didn't convert and just used torr as the unit, then his R would be 62.36, but that's not any of the options.

Hmm, maybe the options have the second researcher as 1.99, which is the same as the third researcher. But that doesn't make sense because the second is using volume and pressure in different units.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the second researcher didn't account for the conversion between torr and atm, leading him to calculate R as 1.99. Let me see: if he thought 760 torr is 760 atm? No, that's impossible. Because 760 torr is 1 atm. So if he mistakenly used 760 as atm, then P would be 760 atm, which is way too high.

Wait, no, that would give R as (760 atm *22.4 L)/(273 K) = (16904 atm·L)/(273 K·mol) ≈ 61.8 atm·L/(K·mol). But that's way higher than 1.99.

Alternatively, perhaps the second researcher measured pressure in mmHg (which is torr) but used the wrong conversion factor. Wait, if he thought 1 torr = 1 atm, then he would have R as (760 *22.4)/273 = same as before, 62.3, which is higher than 1.99.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The options are:

Option A: 0.0821, 1.99, 0.0821

Option D: 0.0821, 1.99, 1.99

Option E: 0.0821, 0.0821, 1.99

So for each researcher, the first is 0.0821, the second could be 1.99 or 0.0821, the third is 1.99.

Wait, but in my analysis, the first and second should have the same R, 0.0821, and the third is 1.99. So looking at the options, option E has first: 0.0821, second: 0.0821, third: 1.99. So option E.

But wait, in the problem statement, the second researcher's pressure is 760 torr, but in the same setup, so his calculation should give the same R as the first, provided he correctly converts units.

But perhaps the second researcher didn't convert torr to atm, so he calculated R in torr·L/(mol·K). But in the options, the second researcher's R is given in (l·atm)/(K·mol). So that can't be. So perhaps the second researcher's R is 0.0821, same as the first. Thus, the correct option would be E, which has first and second as 0.0821, third as 1.99.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the third researcher's product PV is 542 cal. So R is 542 cal/(273 K) ≈ 1.985, which is 1.99 cal/(mol·K). So the third's R is 1.99 cal/(mol·K).

So the first and second researchers determined R as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), and the third as 1.99 cal/(mol·K). So looking at the options, option E matches this: first and second as 0.0821, third as 1.99.

So the correct answer should be option E.

To determine the value of the gas constant \( R \) for each researcher, we analyze their data using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \). The gas constant \( R \) can be calculated as:

\[
R = \frac{PV}{nT}
\]

### First Researcher:
- **Given:** \( P = 1 \, \text{atm}, V = 22.4 \, \text{L}, n = 1 \, \text{mol}, T = 273 \, \text{K} \)
- Substituting into the formula:
  \[
  R = \frac{(1 \, \text{atm})(22.4 \, \text{L})}{(1 \, \text{mol})(273 \, \text{K})} = \frac{22.4}{273} \approx 0.0821 \, \frac{\text{L·atm}}{\text{K·mol}}
  \]
- Thus, the first researcher's \( R \) is \( 0.0821 \, \frac{\text{L·atm}}{\text{K·mol}} \).

### Second Researcher:
- **Given:** \( P = 760 \, \text{torr}, V = 22.4 \, \text{L}, n = 1 \, \text{mol}, T = 273 \, \text{K} \)
- Since \( 760 \, \text{torr} = 1 \, \text{atm} \), the pressure in atm is \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \). Using the same calculation as the first researcher:
  \[
  R = \frac{(1 \, \text{atm})(22.4 \, \text{L})}{(1 \, \text{mol})(273 \, \text{K})} = \frac{22.4}{273} \approx 0.0821 \, \frac{\text{L·atm}}{\text{K·mol}}
  \]
- Thus, the second researcher's \( R \) is also \( 0.0821 \, \frac{\text
