Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"After all the slaves had been brought together and severally marked with the letter G, the emperor's fifths and then Cortés' were deducted before we were aware of it; and, besides this, on the night preceding, the finest of the Indian females had been secretly set apart, so that when it came to a division among us soldiers, we found none left but old and ugly women&….Another soldier asked Cortés if the division he had made of the gold in Mexico was not a sufficient imposition, for, at first, he had merely spoken of 300,000 pesos, but when we were obliged to retreat from the city, it was estimated at 700,000 pesos. And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&…
[Later], when Cortés learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cortés managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&…"

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question based on the provided text from Bernal Diaz del Castillo's memoirs. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about the consequences of Cortés's actions after his expedition returned. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I'll read the passage again to understand what's happening. From what I gather, after capturing slaves, they were marked and then some were taken by the emperor and Cortés. The soldiers were left with old and ugly women, which upset them. There's also mention of gold distribution. Initially, Cortés said 300,000 pesos, but it was later estimated at 700,000. The soldiers were unhappy because they felt Cortés was taking more than his share, leaving them with little. Additionally, Cortés later demanded that the soldiers give back a third of the gold they had, threatening punishment if they refused. Many refused, but he still managed to take a lot by calling it a loan.

So, what consequences would arise from these actions? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Decrease in the value of gold. Hmm, I don't think so. The value of gold is more about economic factors, and this passage doesn't indicate that the value decreased because of Cortés's actions. It's more about redistribution and control.

Option B: Enhanced diplomatic relations. That doesn't seem right. The passage talks about internal conflict among the Spanish and the treatment of the indigenous people, not about improving relations with other states. If anything, taking slaves and resources would likely harm relations, but the option is about enhancing them, which doesn't fit.

Option C: Less tolerance for Jews and Muslims. This seems unrelated. The passage is about the treatment of indigenous people and the distribution of spoils among soldiers, not about religious groups in Spain or elsewhere.

Option D: Rise in cultural and racial tensions. This could be possible. The Spanish were taking indigenous people as slaves, marking them, and there was conflict over the distribution of spoils. This might lead to increased tensions between the Spanish and the indigenous populations, as well as among the Spanish themselves.

Option E: Decentralized political state. I don't see evidence of this. The text shows Cortés exerting control, taking gold, and making demands, which suggests a more centralized authority rather than a decentralized one.

Option F: Increased rate of inflation. Inflation is related to the money supply. If a lot of gold is taken and perhaps used in the economy, it could lead to inflation. But in this context, the gold is being concentrated among Cortés and the emperor, so maybe it's not entering the broader economy in a way that would cause inflation. Or perhaps the soldiers had their gold taken, which might reduce the amount in circulation. Not sure yet.

Option G: Decrease in population size. The passage mentions taking slaves and separating the finest women, but it doesn't directly state a significant decrease in population. Unless the hardships and treatment led to deaths, but the question is about the consequence of Cortés's actions upon return, not during the expedition.

Option H: Boost in military power and influence. Cortés was able to take a lot of gold and resources, which could be used to fund military activities. So this might be a possibility, as controlling resources can enhance military strength.

Option I: Increase in trade and commerce. If gold is being hoarded by Cortés, it might not be used to stimulate trade. Unless the wealth from the expedition leads to more trade, but the passage doesn't indicate that. The soldiers were unhappy about not getting their share, which might reduce their participation in trade.

Option J: Strengthened agricultural sector. There's no mention of agriculture in the passage. The focus is on gold and slaves, so this doesn't seem relevant.

Now, considering the options again. The key points are the unfair distribution of spoils, taking gold from soldiers, and the treatment of indigenous people. These actions likely caused dissatisfaction among the soldiers and increased tensions with the local population.

So, looking at option D: A rise in cultural and racial tensions. That makes sense because the Spanish were exploiting the indigenous people, taking their resources, and there was conflict over distribution, which could lead to increased tensions.

Option H: A boost in military power. While taking gold could fund the military, the passage shows that Cortés faced resistance from his own men because of the unfair distribution. This might actually weaken his position rather than strengthen it. So perhaps H is not the best answer.

Option F: Inflation. I'm still considering this. If Cortés is taking a lot of gold, he might be using it to pay for things, which could increase the money supply. But the text doesn't explicitly mention economic effects like inflation. It's more about the social dynamics.

Therefore, the most likely answer is D: A rise in cultural and racial tensions.

The correct answer is D: A rise in cultural and racial tensions.

The passage describes Cortés's actions, including the exploitation of indigenous people, unfair distribution of spoils, and conflict with his soldiers. These actions likely led to increased tensions between the Spanish and the indigenous population, as well as among the Spanish themselves. This aligns with option D, which reflects the social and racial conflicts arising from these events.

Answer: D
