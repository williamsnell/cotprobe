Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about social influence responses. Hmm, I need to figure out which option correctly distinguishes the three kinds of responses based on reward/punishment, need to know, or something else. Let me think.

The question mentions three kinds of responses to social influence. I remember from psychology that there are different types of social influence, like compliance, identification, and internalization. Oh wait, I think these are from the persuasion or influence theories.

So, breaking it down: the first type is when someone does something because of a reward or punishment. That makes me think of compliance. Because compliance is about going along with a request to gain a reward or avoid punishment. It's more of an external motivation.

Then the second type is based on a need to know, maybe a deeper acceptance. Identification might fit here. Identification is when a person internalizes the values or beliefs because they identify with the group or person influencing them. It's a bit deeper than compliance because it's about wanting to be like them.

The third type is probably internalization, where the person fully accepts the belief as their own, integrating it into their own values and beliefs. This goes beyond external rewards or just identifying with a group; it's a genuine belief adoption.

Looking at the options, option C says Compliance, identification, and internalization. That matches what I was thinking. Let me double-check the other options to make sure none fit better.

Option A: Conformity, association, adaptation. I know conformity is a broader term, but the breakdown here doesn't seem to match the three specific types I'm thinking of.

Option B: Agreement, alliance, absorption. Not sure about these terms. Alliance sounds like a group formation, not a response type.

Option D: Submission, emulation, inculcation. Submission is like giving in, emulation is copying, and inculcation is teaching. Hmm, but I'm not sure if these exactly fit the reward/punishment, need to know basis.

Option E: Adherence, affiliation, incorporation. Adherence is like following, affiliation is joining, and incorporation is including. Not exactly matching the three-step model.

Option F: Cooperation, imitation, assimilation. Cooperation is working together, imitation is copying, and assimilation is integrating. Close, but I think compliance, identification, internalization are more precise here.

Option G: Obedience, integration, acculturation. Obedience is following orders, integration is combining, acculturation is cultural change. Doesn't align perfectly with the initial breakdown.

Option H: Respect, imitation, socialization. Respect is an emotion, socialization is a broad process. Not the specific responses.

Option I: Acquiescence, imitation, enculturation. Acquiescence is passive acceptance, enculturation is cultural absorption. Not the exact terms used in the three types.

Option J: Coordination, assimilation, conformation. Conformation is similar to conformity, but again not the right terms.

So, option C seems to be the correct answer. Compliance for reward/punishment, identification for the need to know or identify with the group, and internalization for fully accepting the beliefs as one's own.

The question asks to distinguish three kinds of responses to social influence based on reward/punishment, need to know, or a deeper acceptance. From psychological theories, the responses are:

1. **Compliance**: Motivated by external rewards or punishments.  
2. **Identification**: Driven by a desire to align with a group or figure, internalizing their values.  
3. **Internalization**: Complete acceptance of beliefs as one's own, integrating them into personal values.  

Option C (Compliance, identification, internalization) aligns perfectly with these concepts. Other options either use broader terms or do not match the specific breakdown.  

Answer: C
