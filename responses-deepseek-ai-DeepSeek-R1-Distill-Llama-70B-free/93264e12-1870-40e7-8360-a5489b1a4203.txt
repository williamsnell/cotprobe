Question:

Geologists on a plane are attempting to locate the exact position of the iron reserves in a region by measuring the variation of g in the area, since a large mass of iron will exert an appreciable additional gravitational attraction on a body in the vicinity. They hover above selected spots and observe the movement of a mass suspended from a light spring. If the system has a natural period of 2 s, and the smallest movement of the mass which can be detected is 10^-6 m, what is the minimum change in g which they can observe?

Options:

A: 9.87 ×10^-6 m/s^2
B: 6.28 ×10^-6 m/s^2
C: 7.54 ×10^-6 m/s^2
D: 11.00 ×10^-6 m/s^2
E: 2.50 ×10^-6 m/s^2
F: 8.88 ×10^-6 m/s^2
G: 4.93 ×10^-6 m/s^2
H: 3.14 ×10^-6 m/s^2
I: 5.00 ×10^-6 m/s^2

Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are geologists on a plane trying to find iron reserves by measuring variations in g. They're using a mass suspended from a light spring. The system has a natural period of 2 seconds, and the smallest movement they can detect is 10^-6 meters. I need to find the minimum change in g they can observe.

Hmm, I remember that when a mass is suspended from a spring, it's a simple harmonic oscillator. The period of such a system depends on the spring constant and the mass. The formula for the period T is T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant.

Wait, but in this problem, they're talking about variations in g. So how does g factor into this? Oh right, because the restoring force in the spring is F = -kx, and near the Earth's surface, the gravitational force is mg. But wait, when you hang a mass from a spring, the spring is stretched until the spring force balances the gravitational force. So mg = kx_0, where x_0 is the equilibrium extension.

But in this case, they're looking at small movements around that equilibrium. So when g changes slightly, the equilibrium position shifts by a tiny amount. The change in g would cause a small displacement which they can measure.

So the minimum detectable change in displacement is 10^-6 m. Let's denote this as Δx = 1e-6 m.

I need to find the corresponding change in g, Δg, that would cause this displacement.

From the equilibrium condition, mg = kx_0. So k = mg / x_0. But wait, that's the initial equilibrium. When g changes by Δg, the new equilibrium would be x_0 + Δx, so the new force balance is m(g + Δg) = k(x_0 + Δx).

But wait, since the system is in equilibrium, the initial condition is mg = kx_0. So when g changes, the change in force is mΔg = kΔx.

So, Δg = (k/m) Δx.

But I don't know k or m. However, I have the period T = 2s. Let's think about the period formula again. T = 2π√(m/k). Let me solve for k/m. 

From T = 2π√(m/k), square both sides: T² = 4π² (m/k). So m/k = T²/(4π²). Therefore, k/m = 4π² / T².

So, Δg = (k/m) * Δx = (4π² / T²) * Δx.

Plugging in the numbers: T is 2 seconds, Δx is 1e-6 m.

Calculating that:

4π² = 4 * (π)^2. Let me compute that. π is approximately 3.1416, so π² ≈ 9.8696. 4 * 9.8696 ≈ 39.4784.

T squared is (2)^2 = 4.

So 4π² / T² = 39.4784 / 4 = 9.8696.

Multiply by Δx, which is 1e-6 m: 9.8696e-6 m/s².

Wait, let me double-check the units. Since k is in N/m, which is kg/s². m is kg. So k/m is 1/s². Δx is in meters, so when multiplied, (1/s²)*m gives m/s², which is correct for g (acceleration due to gravity).

So the minimum Δg is approximately 9.87e-6 m/s².

Looking at the options, option A is 9.87e-6 m/s². So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recompute 4π².

π squared is about 9.8696. Multiply by 4: 4 * 9.8696 = 39.4784.

Divide by T squared, which is 4, so 39.4784 /4 = 9.8696.

Yes, that's correct. Multiply by 1e-6, gives 9.8696e-6, which rounds to 9.87e-6.

So the answer is A.

To determine the minimum change in \( g \) that can be observed, we analyze the system as a simple harmonic oscillator. The period \( T \) of a mass-spring system is given by:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
\]

From this, we can solve for the ratio \( \frac{k}{m} \):

\[
\frac{k}{m} = \frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}
\]

The minimum detectable change in displacement is \( \Delta x = 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). The corresponding change in gravitational acceleration \( \Delta g \) is related to \( \Delta x \) by:

\[
\Delta g = \frac{k}{m} \Delta x
\]

Substituting \( \frac{k}{m} = \frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} \) into the equation for \( \Delta g \):

\[
\Delta g = \frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} \Delta x
\]

Given \( T = 2 \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta x = 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
4\pi^2 = 4 \times (3.1416)^2 \approx 39.4784
\]

\[
\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} = \frac{39.4784}{4} \approx 9.8696
\]

\[
\Delta g = 9.8696 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

This rounds to \( 9.87 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which matches option A.
