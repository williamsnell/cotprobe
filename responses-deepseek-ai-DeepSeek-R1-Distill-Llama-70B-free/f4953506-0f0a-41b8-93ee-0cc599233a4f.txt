Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the standard absolute entropy of uranium metal at 20 K. Hmm, I remember that entropy has something to do with heat capacity, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through step by step.

The question gives me the heat capacity, which is 0.727 cal/(deg·mol) at 20 K. Wait, but wait, heat capacity at constant pressure or volume? Oh, right, for solids, especially at low temperatures, I think it's often the constant volume heat capacity that's used. But wait, when dealing with entropy, I'm pretty sure the formula uses the heat capacity divided by temperature. But maybe I'm mixing up some concepts here.

I recall that the entropy S can be calculated using the formula S = nCv ln(T) + ... wait, no, that's when you're integrating from 0 Kelvin. Or wait, the entropy change when you heat a substance from 0 K to some temperature T is the integral of (C/T) dT. Oh right, that's it. So the standard absolute entropy is the entropy from 0 K to the temperature in question, which is 20 K here.

But wait, the formula. The entropy S is the integral from 0 to T of (Cv / T) dT. But wait, Cv is the molar heat capacity at constant volume. So if I have Cv, I can integrate that from 0 to T to get the entropy.

But wait, the problem gives Cv at 20 K. However, I remember that at very low temperatures, the heat capacity of solids is proportional to T cubed, as per the Debye model. But if the question gives me the value of Cv at 20 K, maybe I'm supposed to use that as an average or assume it's constant?

Hmm, but that might complicate things. Let me think. The question says the heat capacity is 0.727 cal deg^-1 mole^-1 at 20 K. So perhaps we can assume that this is the value of Cv, and maybe it's constant with temperature? But that doesn't make sense because, as temperature increases, Cv for solids increases. Oh wait, but at 20 K, it's a low temperature, so maybe the heat capacity is already in the Debye region where it's proportional to T^3. But if I don't have information on how Cv varies with T, I might have to make an assumption. But the question seems to indicate that I can calculate the entropy using just this value.

Wait another thought: the standard absolute entropy is calculated by integrating from 0 to T the (Cv/T) dT. But if Cv is given at T=20 K, perhaps I'm to assume that Cv is constant over the temperature range from 0 to 20 K, which isn't accurate, but maybe it's an approximation the question expects.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the heat capacity is given as Cv, and the entropy is simply Cv multiplied by ln(T) or something like that, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for entropy when heat capacity is constant is S = Cv * ln(T) + S0, but at absolute zero, S0 is zero according to the third law of thermodynamics. So if Cv is constant, S would be Cv * ln(T). But wait, that's only if Cv is constant over the temperature range. But in reality, Cv varies with temperature, especially at low temps. However, the question gives me a single value of Cv at 20 K, so perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that Cv is constant.

Wait, but wait another moment. The entropy S at temperature T is given by the integral from 0 to T of (Cv / T) dT. If Cv is constant, then S = Cv * ln(T). But the units here are cal/(deg·mol) and K is the unit of temperature, so 20 K would be 20 degrees in this context.

So plugging in, S = 0.727 cal/(mol·K) * ln(20 K). Wait, but what's the value of ln(20)? Let's compute that.

ln(20) is about 2.9957. So 0.727 * 2.9957 ≈ let's see. 0.7 * 3 is 2.1, and 0.027 *3 is about 0.081, so total around 2.181. But wait, let me calculate more accurately.

0.727 * 2.9957:

Well, 0.7 * 3 = 2.1, 0.7 * 0.9957 is about 0.697, so 2.1 +0.697= 2.797? Wait no, wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, 0.727 * 3 is 2.181, so 0.727 *2.9957 would be a bit less than that. Let me compute it more accurately.

2.9957 * 0.727:

Compute 2 * 0.727 = 1.454

0.9957 * 0.727: Let's compute 0.9957 * 0.7 is 0.69699, and 0.9957 *0.027 is approximately 0.02688. So sum is 0.69699 + 0.02688 = 0.72387.

So total is 1.454 + 0.72387 = 2.17787.

So approximately 2.178 cal/(mol·K). Hmm, but looking at the options, option H is 2.175 cal/(mol·K), which is very close. But wait, option H is 2.175, which is close to my calculation. But wait, the given options don't have this as an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 0.908

B: 0.4846

C: 0.727

D: 0.12115

E: 1.454

F: 0.14538

G: 0.3635

H: 2.175

I: 0.2423

J: 0.060575

So option H is 2.175, which matches my calculation. But wait, wait a second. The question says the heat capacity is given at 20 K, but if I'm using Cv * ln(T), I'm assuming Cv is constant over all temperatures from 0 to 20 K, which isn't correct. Because, in reality, at lower temperatures, Cv would be lower, so using the value at 20 K would overestimate the entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering using the heat capacity at the specific temperature to calculate the entropy. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The formula for entropy when you have a constant heat capacity is S = Cv * ln(T2/T1). But if T1 is 0, then T2 is 20 K, and S = Cv * ln(20). But as I computed, that gives about 2.175, which is option H.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is using the heat capacity at 20 K and calculating the entropy using S = C * ln(20). But then again, that's what I just did.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the entropy is just the product of heat capacity and temperature, but that doesn't make sense because entropy isn't C*T. Or wait, maybe it's considering that the heat capacity is C = T*(dS/dT). So if C is constant, then dS = C*(dT/T). Integrating from 0 to 20 K gives S = C * ln(20). Which again brings me to the same result.

But I'm a bit concerned because the standard entropy of a substance at 20 K is going to be lower than its entropy at higher temperatures, but I'm getting a value of about 2.175, which seems high. For example, I remember that the standard entropy of lead at 298 K is about 44 J/(mol·K), which is about 10.5 cal/(mol·K), but that's at room temperature. So at 20 K, it should be much lower. So 2.175 cal/(mol·K) seems plausible, but wait, 2 cal/(mol·K) times 20 K gives 40 cal/mol, which is about 170 J/mol, which seems reasonable.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the entropy is calculated as C times log base something else. Wait, no, the formula uses natural logarithm, not base 10. So that part seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the heat capacity is per mole per Kelvin, so the entropy would be in cal/(mol·K). So, if the heat capacity is 0.727 cal/(mol·K), then at 20 K, the entropy would be C * ln(20).

But wait, that's the same calculation as before, giving 2.175, which is option H. But looking back at the options, H is 2.175, which matches.

Wait, but wait another angle: maybe the question is asking for the entropy change from 0 K to 20 K, which is correct. So using the integral from 0 to 20 of (Cv / T) dT, and if Cv is taken as 0.727, then S = 0.727 * ln(20).

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to consider that the entropy is just C times temperature, but that would be S = 0.727 * 20 = 14.54 cal/(mol·K), which is 14.54, but that's not one of the options. Wait, option E is 1.454, which is about a tenth of that. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula for the entropy when the heat capacity is constant. The entropy change when heating a substance from T1 to T2 is ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1). If T1 approaches 0, then T2 is our temperature, so ΔS = Cv ln(T2). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but I think I might have missed a factor. Because at very low temperatures, the heat capacity of a solid is Cv = a T^3, where a is a constant. So if Cv varies with T, you can't just take the value at 20 K and multiply by ln(20). Instead, you have to integrate from 0 to 20 K using the correct form of Cv(T).

But the problem here gives Cv at 20 K, so perhaps we're to assume that the heat capacity is constant and equal to that value for all temperatures up to 20 K. That would make the calculation straightforward, resulting in option H. But I'm a bit unsure because in reality, using the actual temperature-dependent Cv would give a different value. However, the question seems to present it as a simple calculation, so perhaps the intended approach is to proceed with the given Cv and calculate S = Cv * ln(T).

Wait, but let me think again. Let's compute ln(20) more accurately. Using a calculator, ln(20) is approximately 2.9957. So 0.727 * 2.9957 = let's compute:

0.727 * 3 = 2.181, but since it's 2.9957, which is 3 - 0.0043. So 0.727 * 0.0043 = approx 0.00313. So 2.181 - 0.00313 = 2.17787, which is approximately 2.178 cal/(mol·K). Looking at the options, option H is 2.175, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is H.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the standard entropy of a metal at 20 K shouldn't be that high. Let me think about another approach. Maybe the question is asking for the standard molar entropy, but perhaps I'm supposed to use the formula S = C * ln(T) only when C is in J, not cal. Wait, no, the units here are in cal, so the calculation should be in cal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted the temperature from Kelvin to another unit, but no, entropy equations use absolute temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is using the wrong formula. Perhaps instead of integrating from 0 to T, it's just using S = C*T. But that would give 0.727 *20 =14.54, which isn't an option except for option E (1.454) which is 1/10th of that. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the formula used is S = C * ln(T) / T, which would be S = 0.727 * ln(20)/20. Let me see what that would be.

ln(20)=2.9957. So 2.9957/20 =0.1498. Multiply by 0.727: 0.727 *0.1498 ≈ 0.1088 cal/(mol·K). That's about 0.1088, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest is option D: 0.12115 or option I:0.2423. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula S = C * (T/(T)) which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's using the high-temperature approximation, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the given heat capacity is per gram, but the question states it's per mole. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the molar gas constant R somewhere. Let me think: R is about 1.987 cal/(mol·K). But I don't see how that factors in here.

Wait, another angle: the entropy of a solid can also be approximated using the Debye model, which says that at low temperatures, the heat capacity Cv is proportional to T^3. The formula is Cv = ( (π^4 * N_A * k_B^3 * T^3 ) / (5 * h^3 * D) ) ), but without knowing D (the Debye temperature), it's hard to use this. However, the question gives Cv at 20 K, so maybe we just proceed with the given value.

Wait, but perhaps the question is testing the understanding that the entropy is calculated using S = C_v * ln(T). So the calculation I did earlier leading to 2.175 cal/(mol·K) seems correct, and the option H is present. So I'm leaning toward option H being the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back, the question says "calculate the standard absolute entropy of this substance in cal·K^-1·mol^-1 at 20 K." So the unit is cal/(K·mol), which matches my calculation.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because in reality, the entropy of a solid at 20 K shouldn't be that high. For example, the standard molar entropy of carbon (graphite) at 298 K is about 5.74 cal/(mol·K), but at 20 K, it's much lower. So 2.175 cal/(mol·K) at 20 K seems high. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the natural logarithm of (T) in Kelvin. Wait, yes, I did. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is looking for the entropy in terms of the heat capacity given as C = 0.727 cal/(mol·K) at 20 K, so the entropy would be C multiplied by the natural log of (20 K) as I did, leading to 2.175, which is option H. That seems to be the correct approach given the question's wording.

So I think the correct answer is option H, 2.175 cal/(mol·K).

To calculate the standard absolute entropy of uranium metal at 20 K, we use the formula for entropy:

\[
S = \int_0^T \frac{C_v}{T} \, dT
\]

Here, \( C_v \) is the molar heat capacity at constant volume, and the integral is evaluated from 0 K to 20 K. The problem provides \( C_v = 0.727 \, \text{cal} \, \text{deg}^{-1} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \) at 20 K. Assuming \( C_v \) is constant over the temperature range (as the question does not provide additional data on the temperature dependence of \( C_v \)), the entropy can be calculated as:

\[
S = C_v \ln(T)
\]

Substituting \( T = 20 \, \text{K} \) and \( C_v = 0.727 \, \text{cal} \, \text{deg}^{-1} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \):

\[
S = 0.727 \cdot \ln(20)
\]

The natural logarithm of 20 is approximately \( \ln(20) \approx 2.9957 \). Thus:

\[
S = 0.727 \cdot 2.9957 \approx 2.178 \, \text{cal} \, \text{K}^{-1} \, \text{mol}^{-1}
\]

This value closely matches option H, which is \( 2.175 \, \text{cal} \, \text{K}^{-1} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \). While there is some concern about whether \( C_v \) is constant over the range from 0 K to 20 K, the question explicitly provides \( C_v \) at 20 K and implies that it should be used directly for the calculation. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is to assume \( C_v \) is constant, leading to the final answer:

**H: 2.175 cal mol\(^{-1}\)K\(^{-1}\)**

Answer: H
