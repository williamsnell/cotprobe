Okay, so I've got this question about the overjustification hypothesis and its implications on self-concept. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking what happens according to the overjustification hypothesis. I remember that this hypothesis is related to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Oh right, it's about how external rewards can affect someone's interest in an activity they already enjoy.

Wait, the overjustification hypothesis suggests that when people are rewarded for doing something they inherently enjoy, they might start to lose interest in that activity. Because they might think they're only doing it for the reward, not because they like it. So their intrinsic motivation decreases because of the extrinsic reward.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B says not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. No, wait, that doesn't sound right. Because not rewarding them wouldn't take away their interest. In fact, the hypothesis is about adding rewards, not removing them.

Option H says rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. Yeah, that fits. Because when you start giving rewards for something they already like, they might start to think they're only doing it for the reward, which reduces their intrinsic motivation.

Let me check the other options to be sure. Option E says rewarding for an unenjoyable activity can enhance interest. That doesn't seem right. I think the hypothesis is specifically about activities people already enjoy.

Options A and F are about emotion and arousal, which is the Schachter-Singer theory, I think. So those aren't related here.

Options C and E are about unenjoyable activities, which I don't think the hypothesis addresses. It's more about enjoyable ones.

Options D, G, I are about inferring emotions from behavior and context, which relates to self-perception theory, not overjustification.

So the correct answer should be H.

The overjustification hypothesis explains that when individuals are rewarded for engaging in an activity they already enjoy, their intrinsic motivation for that activity may decrease. This happens because they begin to attribute their participation to the external reward rather than their genuine interest. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option H** correctly states that rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest, aligning with the hypothesis.
- Other options either address unrelated concepts (e.g., emotion and arousal in A and F) or misrepresent the hypothesis (e.g., B, C, E, I).

Thus, the correct answer is **H**.
