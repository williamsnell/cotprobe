Okay, so I have this problem about depreciation, and I need to figure it out using the straight-line method. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

Mr. Haines bought a tractor for $2,895.00, and it's estimated that after 10 years, the salvage value will be $495.00. The question is asking for the depreciation after the first five years. So, I need to calculate how much the tractor has depreciated in those five years.

I remember that straight-line depreciation is a method where the cost of the asset is spread evenly over its useful life. The formula for annual depreciation is (Cost - Salvage Value) divided by the useful life. 

Let me write that down. So, the Cost is $2,895, and the Salvage Value is $495. The useful life is 10 years. So the annual depreciation would be (2895 - 495) / 10. Let me compute that.

First, subtract the salvage value from the cost: 2895 minus 495. Let's see, 2895 - 400 is 2495, then subtract another 95, which brings it to 2400. So, 2400 divided by 10 equals 240. So each year, the tractor depreciates by $240. 

Wait, but the question is asking for the depreciation after five years. Oh right, because depreciation accumulates each year. So each year, it's $240, so after five years, that's 5 times 240. Let me calculate that. 240 times 5 is 1200. So the total depreciation after five years would be $1,200.

Looking at the options, option G is $1,200. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The cost minus salvage is 2895 - 495. 2895 minus 500 is 2395, but since it's only 495, I add back 5, making 2400. Divide by 10 gives 240 per year. Five years would be 240 *5 = 1200. Yes, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any errors here. So the answer should be G.

To determine the depreciation after the first five years using the straight-line method, we start by calculating the annual depreciation. The formula for annual depreciation is:

\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}
\]

Given:
- Cost = $2,895.00
- Salvage Value = $495.00
- Useful Life = 10 years

First, calculate the depreciable amount:

\[
\text{Depreciable Amount} = 2,895 - 495 = 2,400
\]

Next, divide by the useful life to find the annual depreciation:

\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{2,400}{10} = 240
\]

Since the question asks for the depreciation after the first five years, multiply the annual depreciation by 5:

\[
\text{Depreciation after 5 Years} = 240 \times 5 = 1,200
\]

Thus, the total depreciation after the first five years is $1,200. The correct answer is:

G: $1,200

Answer: G
