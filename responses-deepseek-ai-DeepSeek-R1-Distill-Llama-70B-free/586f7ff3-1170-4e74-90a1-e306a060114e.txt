Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that we mix 1 mole of HCl and 1 mole of NaC₂H₃O₂ in enough water to make one liter of solution. We need to find the concentrations of the species in the final equilibrium. The given K_diss is 1.8 × 10^-5 for NaC₂H₃O₂. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to understand what's happening in this solution. When NaC₂H₃O₂ dissolves in water, it dissociates into Na+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ ions. But then, when HCl is added, which is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely into H+ and Cl⁻ ions.

Wait, so the H+ ions from HCl will react with the C₂H₃O₂⁻ ions. Because C₂H₃O₂⁻ is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), it will react with H+ to form HC₂H₃O₂. So the H+ from HCl will neutralize some of the C₂H₃O₂⁻.

Let me outline the reactions:

1. NaC₂H₃O₂ dissociates:
NaC₂H₃O₂ → Na+ + C₂H₃O₂⁻
Since Na+ is a spectator ion, we can ignore it for the acid-base reactions.

2. HCl dissociates completely:
HCl → H+ + Cl⁻
Again, Cl⁻ is a spectator ion.

3. The H+ from HCl reacts with C₂H₃O₂⁻:
H+ + C₂H₃O₂⁻ → HC₂H₃O₂

So initially, before any reaction, we have 1 mole of C₂H₃O₂⁻ and 1 mole of H+ in the solution. They will react in a 1:1 ratio, so they'll neutralize each other to form HC₂H₃O₂.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Wait, when you mix 1 mole of NaC₂H₃O₂ and 1 mole of HCl in 1 liter, the initial moles are 1 mole of C₂H₃O₂⁻ and 1 mole of H+.

So when they react, they form HC₂H₃O₂. So all the H+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ will combine to form HC₂H₃O₂. But wait, NaC₂H₃O₂ is a salt of a weak acid, so it's already in solution. HCl is a strong acid, so adding it will shift the equilibrium.

Wait, but let me think in terms of stoichiometry. Let's see:

The reaction is H+ + C₂H₃O₂⁻ ↔ HC₂H₃O₂.

Initially, the moles of H+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ are both 1 mol in 1 L, so 1 M each.

When they react, each mole of H+ will convert a mole of C₂H₃O₂⁻ into HC₂H₃O₂. So after reaction, all the H+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ will be consumed, and we'll have 1 M HC₂H₃O₂. But wait, that's assuming they react completely, but maybe it's not that straightforward because HCl is a strong acid, which means it will donate H+ ions, which will react with the C₂H₃O₂⁻.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the reaction goes to completion because HCl is a strong acid, so the H+ is in excess. But wait, the moles are equal—1 mole each. So they would completely neutralize each other, leaving 1 mole of HC₂H₃O₂. But wait, that can't be, because HC₂H₃O₂ is a weak acid and will dissociate. So the solution is now a solution of HC₂H₃O₂.

Wait, but in that case, the solution is 1 M HC₂H₃O₂. But HC₂H₃O₂ is a weak acid, so it will dissociate:

HC₂H₃O₂ ↔ H+ + C₂H₃O₂⁻

The Ka for acetic acid is given by Kw / Kb. Wait, wait, but wait—NaC₂H₃O₂ is the sodium salt of acetic acid. So Kb for NaC₂H₃O₂ would be Kw / Ka of acetic acid.

Wait, wait, but the problem gives us K_diss, which I think is the dissociation constant for NaC₂H₃O₂. Wait, no, K_diss usually refers to the dissociation of a salt into ions. So for NaC₂H₃O₂, it's dissociating into Na+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻. So K_diss here would be the same as Kb for C₂H₃O₂⁻ acting as a base.

Wait, no, K_diss for NaC₂H₃O₂ is the same as Kb for the acetate ion. Because NaC₂H₃O₂ dissociates into Na+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻, and the C₂H₃O₂⁻ can hydrolyze in water: C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H2O ↔ HC₂H₃O₂ + OH⁻. The Kb for this reaction is given as 1.8e-5.

But in this problem, after mixing HCl and NaC₂H₃O₂, the H+ from HCl will react with C₂H₃O₂⁻ to form HC₂H₃O₂. So all the C₂H₃O₂⁻ would be converted to HC₂H₃O₂, but since we started with 1 mole each of HCl and NaC₂H₃O₂, they would neutralize each other, leaving 1 mole of HC₂H₃O₂ in solution.

Wait, but that would make the solution 1 M in HC₂H₃O₂. But HC₂H₃O₂ is a weak acid and will dissociate. So the equilibrium concentrations can be found using the Ka of HC₂H₃O₂.

Wait, wait, what's the Ka of acetic acid? I remember that the Ka of acetic acid is about 1.8e-5. But wait, in this problem, the K_diss given is 1.8e-5. Let me make sure.

The problem states that K_diss for NaC₂H₃O₂ is 1.8e-5. So that's the Kb for the acetate ion. Because K_diss for the salt NaC₂H₃O₂ would be the Kb of C₂H₃O₂⁻. So Kb = 1.8e-5.

Then, the Ka of HC₂H₃O₂ would be Kw / Kb = (1e-14) / (1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10. Wait, that seems really small. Wait, but that's not right because the Ka of acetic acid is about 1.8e-5. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the K_diss given here is the Ka of HC₂H₃O₂, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, wait—NaC₂H₃O₂ is the sodium salt of acetic acid. So when it dissociates, the C₂H₃O₂⁻ ion can act as a base, reacting with water:

C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H2O ↔ HC₂H₃O₂ + OH⁻. The Kb for this is given as 1.8e-5.

So, Kb = 1.8e-5.

Then, the Ka of HC₂H₃O₂ is Kw / Kb = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

Wait, but that would make HC₂H₃O₂ a very weak acid, which doesn't make sense because I know acetic acid's Ka is about 1.8e-5. So perhaps I have this backwards.

Wait, maybe K_diss here refers to the Ka of HC₂H₃O₂. Hmm, perhaps the question is using K_diss as the dissociation of the acid. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the K_diss of the salt, which is the same as the Kb of the conjugate base. So for NaC₂H₃O₂ dissociating, the K_diss is Kb = 1.8e-5.

So, when you have 1 mole of NaC₂H₃O₂ and 1 mole of HCl in 1 L, the H+ from HCl will react with C₂H₃O₂⁻ to form HC₂H₃O₂. So moles of H+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ are equal, so they'll completely neutralize each other, leaving 1 M HC₂H₃O₂.

But wait, HC₂H₃O₂ is a weak acid, so it will dissociate:

HC₂H₃O₂ ↔ H+ + C₂H₃O₂⁻.

The Ka for this is Kw / Kb = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10. So it's a weak acid with a very small Ka.

Wait, but that can't be right because I know the Ka of acetic acid is ~1.8e-5. So perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, maybe K_diss is the Ka of HC₂H₃O₂, not the Kb of the salt. Because if that were the case, then Kb would be Kw / K_diss = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10. That would make sense.

Wait, but the problem says K_diss for NaC₂H₃O₂ is 1.8e-5. So for the salt's dissociation, which is C₂H₃O₂⁻ acting as a base.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that after mixing, the solution is 1 M HC₂H₃O₂, and then it will dissociate with a small Ka.

So, let me model the situation. The initial concentration of HC₂H₃O₂ is 1 M. Let x be the amount that dissociates.

So:

HC₂H₃O₂ ↔ H+ + C₂H₃O₂⁻

Initial:
[HC₂H₃O₂] = 1 M
[H+] = 0
[C₂H₃O₂⁻] = 0

Change:
[HC₂H₃O₂] decreases by x
[H+] increases by x
[C₂H₃O₂⁻] increases by x

At equilibrium:
[HC₂H₃O₂] = 1 - x
[H+] = x
[C₂H₃O₂⁻] = x

The Ka expression is:

Ka = [H+][C₂H₃O₂⁻] / [HC₂H₃O₂] = (x)(x) / (1 - x) = x² / (1 - x)

But wait, we thought earlier that Ka is 5.56e-10, but that would be if K_diss is 1.8e-5 as Kb. Alternatively, if K_diss is the Ka, then that's different.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct Ka for HC₂H₃O₂. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Since we have 1 mole of HCl and 1 mole of NaC₂H₃O₂ in 1 L, the H+ from HCl will react with C₂H₃O₂⁻ from the sodium salt.

The reaction is:

H+ + C₂H₃O₂⁻ → HC₂H₃O₂

This reaction goes to completion because HCl is a strong acid, so it will convert all the C₂H₃O₂⁻ to HC₂H₃O₂. But wait, since the moles of H+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ are equal, they will completely neutralize each other, leaving 1 mole of HC₂H₃O₂ in 1 L, so 1 M concentration.

Wait, but that can't be right because HC₂H₃O₂ is a weak acid and will dissociate. So let me model this.

The solution is 1 M HC₂H₃O₂. Let’s find the concentrations of H+, C₂H₃O₂⁻, and HC₂H₃O₂ at equilibrium.

The Ka for HC₂H₃O₂ is known, but wait, I need to find it. From the problem, K_diss is given as 1.8e-5 for NaC₂H₃O₂. So that's the Kb for the acetate ion.

Kb = 1.8e-5.

So, the Ka of HC₂H₃O₂ is Kw / Kb = (1e-14) / (1.8e-5) ≈ 5.5556e-10. That's a very small Ka, meaning HC₂H₃O₂ is a very weak acid.

Wait, that seems contradictory because I know that acetic acid's Ka is about 1.8e-5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the K_diss value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the K_diss of HC₂H₃O₂, but that's not the usual term.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses K_diss as the dissociation of the acid, which would be the Ka. If that's the case, then K_diss (Ka) is 1.8e-5. Then, for the acetate ion, Kb would be Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

But in this problem, after mixing, the solution is 1 M HC₂H₃O₂, which will dissociate with its own Ka.

So let me proceed with the correct approach.

After mixing, all the C₂H₃O₂⁻ and H+ from HCl form HC₂H₃O₂, so the solution is 1 M HC₂H₃O₂. Now, this will dissociate as follows:

HC₂H₃O₂ ↔ H+ + C₂H₃O₂⁻.

Let’s set up the ICE table.

Initial concentrations:
[HC₂H₃O₂] = 1 M
[H+] = 0
[C₂H₃O₂⁻] = 0

Change:
[HC₂H₃O₂] decreases by x
[H+] increases by x
[C₂H₃O₂⁻] increases by x

Equilibrium concentrations:
[HC₂H₃O₂] = 1 - x
[H+] = x
[C₂H₃O₂⁻] = x

The Ka expression is:

Ka = (x)(x) / (1 - x) = x² / (1 - x)

We know that the Ka of HC₂H₃O₂ is 1.8e-5, but wait, earlier I thought that K_diss is given as 1.8e-5, which is the Kb of the acetate ion. So if K_diss is the Kb, then the Ka of HC₂H₃O₂ would be 5.56e-10.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

- For the salt NaC₂H₃O₂, the dissociation in water is:

C₂H₃O₂⁻ + H2O ↔ HC₂H₃O₂ + OH⁻

The K for this reaction is Kb = [HC₂H₃O₂][OH⁻] / [C₂H₃O₂⁻] 

Given that Kb (K_diss) is 1.8e-5.

The Ka for HC₂H₃O₂ is Kw / Kb = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

So, when the solution is 1 M HC₂H₃O₂, it will dissociate with Ka = 5.56e-10.

But 5.56e-10 is a very small Ka, so x will be very small.

Let’s approximate (1 - x) ≈ 1, since x is small.

So, Ka ≈ x² / 1 → x² ≈ 5.56e-10 → x ≈ sqrt(5.56e-10) ≈ 7.45e-5 M.

So [H+] ≈ 7.45e-5 M, [C₂H₃O₂⁻] ≈ 7.45e-5 M, and [HC₂H₃O₂] ≈ 1 - 7.45e-5 ≈ 0.99992955 M.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option E: [H+] = .008 M, [C₂H₃O₂⁻] = .992 M, [HC₂H₃O₂] = .008 M. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Option I: [H+] = .004 M, [C₂H₃O₂⁻] = .004 M, [HC₂H₃O₂] = .996 M. No, because 0.004 is larger than our x.

Option J: [H+] = .002 M, [C₂H₃O₂⁻] = .998 M, [HC₂H₃O₂] = .002 M. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the initial concentrations. Maybe when HCl and NaC₂H₃O₂ are mixed, not all of the C₂H₃O₂⁻ is converted to HC₂H₃O₂. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will donate H+ which will react with C₂H₃O₂⁻ to form HC₂H₃O₂. But since both are 1 mole in 1 L, they will completely neutralize each other, leading to 1 M HC₂H₃O₂.

Wait, but then HC₂H₃O₂ will dissociate as a weak acid with Ka ≈ 5.56e-10, leading to very low [H+].

Looking at the options again, none of the options exactly match 0.0000745 M for [H+], but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the K_diss and Ka. Let me re-express this.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that after mixing, the solution is 1 M HC₂H₃O₂. Now, HC₂H₃O₂ is a weak acid with Ka = 1.8e-5. Wait, but that's the usual Ka for ac
