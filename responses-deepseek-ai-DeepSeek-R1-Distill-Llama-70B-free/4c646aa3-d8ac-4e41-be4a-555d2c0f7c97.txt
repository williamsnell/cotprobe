E: An implied condition of the photographer's duty of performance was that the mother reasonably cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.

Okay, so I have this contract law question to tackle. Let me read through it carefully. Alright, the scenario is about a mother hiring a photographer. The contract says the photographer must produce a minimum of six acceptable photographs by August 15th and will be paid $200. The question is asking which statement is least accurate regarding the photographer's obligations.

So the options are from A to I. I need to figure out each one and see which is incorrect.

First, I remember that in contract law, both parties have certain duties. The photographer is supposed to perform, but the other party (the mother) also has duties, even if they aren't explicitly stated. Like, implied duties such as cooperation and good faith.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the photographer assumed the risk that the mother wouldn't cooperate. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because usually, if one party doesn't cooperate, it's a breach. So the photographer shouldn't have to bear the risk if the mother doesn't hold up her end. So A might be the inaccurate statement.

Option B states the mother has an implied duty to act in good faith and cooperate. That makes sense because without cooperation, the photographer can't do their job. So B is accurate.

Option C claims the mother must ensure the child is cooperative. Hmm, but a two-year-old might not behave. Is the mother legally obligated to make sure the child behaves? I'm not sure. Maybe it's an undue burden. So C could be inaccurate, but I'm not certain yet.

Option D says failure to cooperate results in a full refund. That seems off. Because if the mother breaches by not cooperating, the photographer might not have to refund. Or maybe they can keep the money since the mother didn't fulfill her part. So D is possibly inaccurate.

Option E mentions an implied condition that the mother cooperates. That aligns with what I know, so E is accurate.

Option F says the mother's refusal would excuse the photographer and allow him to sue. That sounds correct because the mother's failure would be a breach, letting the photographer off the hook and possibly allowing him to claim damages. So F is accurate.

Option G states the photographer must ensure professional quality. That makes sense because photographers are expected to deliver work matching their professional standards. So G is accurate.

Option H says the photographer can cancel if the mother isn't cooperating. That seems right since the mother's cooperation is a condition. So H is accurate.

Option I claims the photographer must take more than six if the mother isn't satisfied. Wait, the contract says a minimum of six acceptable photos. So if the mother isn't satisfied with six, does the photographer have to take more? No, because the contract specifies at least six, not that the mother can demand more. So I might be inaccurate.

Now, let me reevaluate each option.

The question is which is the least accurate, meaning incorrect.

Option C: Is the mother legally obligated to ensure the child cooperates? It's possible that she doesn't have such an obligation because she can't control the child's behavior. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D: If the mother fails to cooperate, can she demand a full refund? I think if the photographer was ready but the mother didn't cooperate, he might not have to refund. So D is inaccurate.

Option I: The contract requires six acceptable photos. If the mother isn't satisfied, the photographer isn't obligated to take more. So I is incorrect.

So, which one is least accurate. Let's think again.

Option C: The mother had a legal obligation to ensure the two-year-old was cooperative. I don't think that's the case. It's an implied duty to cooperate, but ensuring a toddler behaves might not be enforceable. So C is inaccurate.

Option D: Failure to cooperate leads to a full refund. That seems wrong because if the mother breached, the photographer might keep the money. So D is incorrect.

Option I: Photographer must take more than six if not satisfied. The contract says at least six, so if the mother isn't happy with six, the photographer isn't required to take more. So I is incorrect.

So the question is which is the least accurate statement. Let's look at each.

The least accurate is the one that's clearly wrong. Let's see.

Which of these is not accurate.

Option C: The mother's legal obligation to ensure the child's cooperation. I think that's unlikely. So C is incorrect.

Option D: A full refund. If the mother didn't cooperate, the photographer might not have to refund. So D is incorrect.

Option I: Obligation to take more. The contract says minimum, so if the initial six are acceptable, he doesn't have to take more. So I is incorrect.

Now, the question is which is the least accurate.

Wait, the question is about the photographer's taking of the photographs. So which statement is least accurate regarding the photographer's obligations.

Looking at option I: The photographer was under an obligation to take more than six if the mother wasn't satisfied. The contract says "a minimum of six acceptable photographs." So if the mother is not satisfied with the six, the photographer doesn't have to take more. So I is incorrect. So I is the inaccurate statement.

Wait, but maybe the mother's satisfaction is part of the contract. But the contract says "acceptable," which might be objective. So if the photos are acceptable, even if the mother isn't satisfied, the photographer has fulfilled their duty. So I is incorrect.

So among the options, which is least accurate.

The question is which is the least accurate statement about the photographer's taking of the photographs.

Looking back, the options are about the photographer's obligations and the mother's duties.

Option I is about the photographer having to take more if the mother isn't satisfied. The contract only requires six acceptable, so I is an incorrect statement. So I is the least accurate.

Alternatively, option D: If the mother doesn't cooperate, she gets a full refund. But if she breaches, the photographer might be entitled to keep the $200, so D is incorrect.

So which is more incorrect.

Option D says the mother's failure to cooperate would result in a full refund. That's wrong because the photographer might not have to refund. So D is incorrect.

Option I says the photographer must take more than six if the mother isn't satisfied. But the contract requires a minimum of six, so he doesn't have to take more. So I is also incorrect.

But the question is about the photographer's least accurate statement regarding his taking of the photos.

So which is more wrong.

Option I suggests an obligation beyond the contract, which is not present. So I is wrong.

Option D is wrong because it's about the refund, which is a remedy.

So the question is about the photographer's obligations in taking the photos. So I is about his duty to take more, which isn't required.

So I is the least accurate statement.

Wait, but the answer options could have multiple, but the question asks for the least accurate.

Wait, the question is phrased as: which is the least accurate statement with regard to the photographer's taking of the photographs.

So each option relates to the photographer's actions.

Looking again:

Option I: The photographer was under an obligation to take more than six if the mother wasn't satisfied.

But the contract says a minimum of six. So if he provides six that are acceptable, he doesn't have to take more, regardless of the mother's satisfaction. So I is inaccurate.

Option C: The mother had a legal obligation to ensure the two-year-old was cooperative during the session. That's about the mother's duty, not directly the photographer's action. But the question is about the photographer's taking, so perhaps this isn't the focus.

Wait, the question is about the photographer's taking, so perhaps the incorrect statement relates to the photographer's duty.

So, the least accurate statement about the photographer's taking is option I, because it imposes an obligation beyond the contract.

Alternatively, option D is about the refund, which is a remedy, not directly about the photographer's performance.

So I would go with option I as the least accurate.

To determine the least accurate statement regarding the photographer's taking of the photographs, we analyze each option in light of the contract and general contract law principles:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The photographer does not assume the risk of the mother's failure to cooperate. If the mother breaches her duty to cooperate, the photographer may not be obligated to fulfill the contract.

- **Option B**: Correct. The mother has an implied duty to act in good faith and cooperate with the photographer to enable performance.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. The mother is not legally obligated to ensure the two-year-old is cooperative, as controlling a child's behavior is not a reasonable expectation.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. If the mother fails to cooperate, the photographer may not be required to provide a full refund, as this would constitute a breach by the mother.

- **Option E**: Correct. The mother's reasonable cooperation is an implied condition of the photographer's duty to perform.

- **Option F**: Correct. The mother's refusal to cooperate would excuse the photographer from further obligation and allow them to sue for breach of contract.

- **Option G**: Correct. The photographer has an implied duty to ensure the photographs are of professional quality.

- **Option H**: Correct. The photographer can cancel the contract if the mother fails to cooperate, as her cooperation is a condition of performance.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. The contract specifies a minimum of six acceptable photographs. If the photographer meets this requirement, they are not obligated to take additional photographs, even if the mother is not satisfied.

The least accurate statement is **Option I**, as it imposes an obligation on the photographer beyond what is specified in the contract. The photographer is only required to produce six acceptable photographs, and there is no duty to take more if the mother is dissatisfied.

**Answer: I**
