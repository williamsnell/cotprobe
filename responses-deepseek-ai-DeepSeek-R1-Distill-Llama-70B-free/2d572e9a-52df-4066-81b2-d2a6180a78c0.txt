To solve the problem of writing 8 and 2 over 4 as an improper fraction in simplest form, follow these steps:

1. **Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction**:  
   The mixed number is 8 and 2/4. To convert this to an improper fraction:  
   \[
   8 \times 4 = 32
   \]  
   Add the numerator of the fractional part:  
   \[
   32 + 2 = 34
   \]  
   So, the improper fraction is \( \frac{34}{4} \).

2. **Simplify the fraction**:  
   Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:  
   \[
   \frac{34 \div 2}{4 \div 2} = \frac{17}{2}
   \]

3. **Match the simplified fraction to the options**:  
   The simplified improper fraction is \( \frac{17}{2} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
