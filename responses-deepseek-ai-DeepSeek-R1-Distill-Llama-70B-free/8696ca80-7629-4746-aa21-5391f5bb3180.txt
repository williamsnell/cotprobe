Okay, I have this problem with three parts: a, b, and c. Let me try to work through each one step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Starting with part (a): The question says that q = -10^-7 e-(10^5 t) C, and I need to find the average current from t = -5 μs to t = +5 μs. Oh right, current is the derivative of charge with respect to time. So I think I need to find dq/dt.

Wait, the charge is given as q(t) = -1e-7 * e^(-1e5 * t). So the derivative of q with respect to t will give me i(t). Let me compute that.

The derivative of e^(kt) is k*e^(kt). So, dq/dt = -1e-7 * (-1e5) * e^(-1e5 t). The negatives cancel out, so i(t) = 1e-2 * e^(-1e5 t) A. Wait, 1e-2 is 0.01 A, which is 10 mA. Hmm, but wait, that's only part of the story because I think I might have missed a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, the given i is in part (a), but in the question, part (a) is about finding the average current from a given q(t). Oh wait, no, the question says part (a) uses q = ..., but then part (b) and (c) use i = 12 cos(...). So for part (a), the current is derived from q(t).

So i(t) is dq/dt. So q(t) = -1e-7 * e^(-1e5 t). The derivative is dq/dt = -1e-7 * (-1e5) e^(-1e5 t) = 1e-2 e^(-1e5 t). So i(t) = 0.01 e^(-1e5 t) A.

Wait, but that's the expression for the current. Now I need to find the average current over the time interval from t=-5 μs to t=5 μs. The average current is (1/(t2 - t1)) * integral from t1 to t2 of i(t) dt.

Let me convert the time units to seconds because the charge is in coulombs and time in seconds. Oh wait, t is in the exponent as 1e5 t, so if t is in seconds, that works. So 5 μs is 5e-6 seconds.

So the average current I_avg = (1/(5e-6 - (-5e-6))) * integral from -5e-6 to 5e-6 of 0.01 e^(-1e5 t) dt.

The denominator becomes 10e-6 seconds. The integral of e^(-at) dt is (-1/a) e^(-at). So let's compute the integral:

Integral = [ (-1/(1e5)) e^(-1e5 t) ) ] from -5e-6 to 5e-6.

Calculating at upper limit (5e-6): (-1/1e5) e^(-1e5 *5e-6) = (-1e-5) e^(-0.5) ≈ (-1e-5)(0.6065) ≈ -6.065e-6.

At lower limit (-5e-6): (-1e-5) e^(-1e5*(-5e-6)) = (-1e-5) e^(0.5) ≈ (-1e-5)(1.6487) ≈ -1.6487e-5.

Subtracting lower from upper: (-6.065e-6) - (-1.6487e-5) = (-6.065e-6 + 1.6487e-5) = 1.6487e-5 - 6.065e-6 = approx 9.827e-6.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. Wait, the integral from a to b is F(b) - F(a), so it's [F(5e-6) - F(-5e-6)] = [ (-1e-5 e^{-0.5}) ] - [ (-1e-5 e^{0.5}) ) ].

So this is (-1e-5 e^{-0.5}) + 1e-5 e^{0.5}.

Factor out 1e-5: 1e-5 ( e^{0.5} - e^{-0.5} ) = 1e-5 * (e^{0.5} - e^{-0.5}).

e^{0.5} is about 1.6487, e^{-0.5} is about 0.6065. So 1.6487 - 0.6065 ≈ 1.0422. So 1e-5 * 1.0422 ≈ 1.0422e-5.

So the integral is approximately 1.0422e-5. Then the average current is (1/(1e-5)) * 1.0422e-5 = 1.0422e0 = approx 1.0422 A. Wait, that can't be right because when I look at the options, the answers for part (a) are in mA. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, let me check units again. The denominator is 1e-5 seconds. So the integral is 1.0422e-5 coulombs? Because integral of current (A) over time (s) gives charge (C). So yes, the integral is 1.0422e-5 C.

Wait, no, the average current is (integral of i dt) / (t2 - t1). The integral of i(t) dt is the charge, which would be in coulombs. So I_avg = (1.0422e-5 C) / (1e-5 s) ) = approx 1.0422 A. But that's in Amperes. But looking at the options, part (a) is in mA. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the integral. Let me recalculate. The integral of i(t) dt from -5e-6 to 5e-6 is:

Integral = (0.01 / (-1e5)) [e^(-1e5 *5e-6) - e^(-1e5*(-5e-6)) ]

Wait, no, the integral of e^kt is (1/k)e^kt. So the integral of 0.01 e^{-1e5 t} dt is 0.01 * [ (-1/(1e5)) e^{-1e5 t} ) ] + C.

So the integral from a to b is:

0.01 * (-1e-5) [e^{-1e5 * b} - e^{-1e5 * a} ].

So with a = -5e-6, b=5e-6.

Plugging in:

0.01 * (-1e-5) [ e^{-1e5 *5e-6} - e^{-1e5*(-5e-6)} ]

= 0.01 * (-1e-5) [ e^{-0.5} - e^{0.5} ]

= 0.01 * (-1e-5) [ (0.6065) - (1.6487) ]

= 0.01 * (-1e-5) [ -1.0422 ]

= 0.01 * (-1e-5) * (-1.0422) 

= 0.01 * 1.0422e-5 

= 1.0422e-7 C.

Wait, wait, that's 1.0422e-7 C. Then the average current is this divided by the time interval, which is 1e-5 s.

So I_avg = (1.0422e-7 C) / (1e-5 s) = 0.010422 A, which is 10.422 mA. So approximately 10.42 mA. Looking at the options, option C says 10.42 mA for part (a), but let me check the other options. Option J is 10.32 mA, which is close, but my calculation gives 10.42 mA. Hmm, let me check if I made any miscalculations.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the integral calculation. Let me recompute the integral:

The integral is ∫i(t) dt from t=-5e-6 to 5e-6.

i(t) = 0.01 e^{-1e5 t}.

So ∫i(t) dt = 0.01 ∫e^{-1e5 t} dt 

The integral is (0.01) * [ (-1/(1e5)) e^{-1e5 t} ) ] from -5e-6 to 5e-6.

So that's:

0.01 * (-1e-5) [e^{-1e5*(5e-6)} - e^{-1e5*(-5e-6)} ]

= 0.01 * (-1e-5) [ e^{-0.5} - e^{0.5} ]

= 0.01 * (-1e-5) [ (0.6065) - (1.6487) ]

= 0.01 * (-1e-5) [ (-1.0422) ]

= 0.01 * (1e-5 * 1.0422 )

= 0.01 * 1.0422e-5 

= 1.0422e-7 C.

So the average current is 1.0422e-7 / (1e-5) = 0.010422 A = 10.422 mA. So that's approximately 10.42 mA, which matches option C for part (a). So (a) is 10.42 mA.

Moving on to part (b): Find the average current during 0 < t < π/3 ms. The current is given as i = 12 cos[1000t + (π/6)] A.

Wait, average current for a periodic function over a certain interval is (1/T) ∫i dt over that interval, but since it's not necessarily a full period, I can't assume it's zero unless it's symmetric. So I need to compute the integral of i(t) from t=0 to t=π/3 ms, then divide by the time interval.

Wait, but the time is in milliseconds. So π/3 ms is π/3e-3 seconds.

The integral of i(t) dt is ∫12 cos(1000t + π/6) dt from 0 to π/(3e3). Wait, 1000 is in radian per second? Because the argument of cosine is in radians. So yes, the angular frequency ω is 1000 rad/s.

So the integral of cos(a t + b) dt is (1/a) sin(a t + b) + C.

So ∫12 cos(1000t + π/6) dt = 12 * [ (1/1000) sin(1000t + π/6) ) ] evaluated from 0 to T=π/(3e3).

So the integral is (12/1000) [ sin(1000*(π/(3e3)) + π/6) - sin(0 + π/6) ) ].

Simplify the arguments. 1000*(π/(3e3)) = (1000 * π) / (3000) )= π/3. So the first term is sin(π/3 + π/6) = sin(π/2) = 1.

The second term is sin(π/6) = 0.5.

So the integral is (12/1000) [1 - 0.5] = (12/1000)(0.5) = 6/1000 = 0.006 C.

Average current I_avg = 0.006 C / (π/(3e3) s ) = 0.006 * 3e3 / π ≈ (18) / π ≈ 5.73 A.

Looking at the options, option C has 5.73 A for part (b), so that fits. So part (b) is 5.73 A.

Now part (c): Determine the total charge transferred between t=0 and t=2π/3 ms. Charge is the integral of current over time. So ∫i(t) dt from 0 to 2π/(3e3) s.

Wait, the current is 12 cos(1000t + π/6). So the integral is the same as in part (b), but the upper limit is 2π/(3e3).

So the integral is (12/1000)[ sin(1000*(2π/(3e3)) + π/6) - sin(π/6) ) ].

Compute 1000*(2π/(3e3)) = (2000 π)/(3000) )= 2π/3.

So the argument becomes sin(2π/3 + π/6) = sin(5π/6) = 0.5.

So the integral is (12/1000)[0.5 - 0.5] = 0. So the charge is zero? But that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, let me check.

Wait, (12/1000)[ sin(2π/3 + π/6) - sin(π/6) ) ].

Wait, 2π/3 + π/6 = (4π/6 + π/6) = 5π/6. Sin(5π/6) is 0.5.

So sin(5π/6) is 0.5, and sin(π/6) is 0.5.

So (0.5 - 0.5) = 0. So the integral is zero. So the total charge is zero Coulombs.

Looking at the options, option C says 0 C for part (c), which matches. So the total charge is 0 C.

Wait, but wait, the option C says part (c) is 0 C. So the total charge between 0 and 2π/3 ms is zero. That makes sense because the current is symmetric; the positive and negative areas cancel out over that interval.

So putting it all together, part (a) is approx 10.42 mA, part (b) 5.73 A, part (c) 0 C. Looking at the options, option C has these values: (a)10.42 mA, (b)5.73 A, (c)0 C.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is:

C: 10.42 mA, 5.73 A, 0 C.

Yes, that's the one. So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we address each part systematically:

### Part (a)
The charge is given as \( q(t) = -10^{-7} e^{-(10^5)t} \, \text{C} \). The current is the derivative of charge with respect to time:
\[
i(t) = \frac{dq}{dt} = -10^{-7} \cdot (-10^5) e^{-(10^5)t} = 10^{-2} e^{-(10^5)t} \, \text{A}.
\]
To find the average current over the interval \( t = -5 \, \mu\text{s} \) to \( t = 5 \, \mu\text{s} \), we compute:
\[
I_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{t_2 - t_1} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} i(t) \, dt.
\]
The integral of \( i(t) \) is:
\[
\int i(t) \, dt = \int 10^{-2} e^{-(10^5)t} \, dt = 10^{-2} \cdot \frac{-1}{10^5} e^{-(10^5)t} + C.
\]
Evaluating from \( t = -5 \, \mu\text{s} \) to \( t = 5 \, \mu\text{s} \):
\[
\int_{-5 \, \mu\text{s}}^{5 \, \mu\text{s}} i(t) \, dt = 10^{-2} \cdot \frac{-1}{10^5} \left[ e^{-(10^5)(5 \, \mu\text{s})} - e^{-(10^5)(-5 \, \mu\text{s})} \right].
\]
Substituting \( t = 5 \, \mu\text{s} = 5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \), we compute:
\[
e^{-(10^5)(5 \times 10^{-6})} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065, \quad e^{-(10^5)(-5 \times 10^{-6})} = e^{0.5} \approx 1.6487.
\]
Thus:
\[
\int_{-5 \, \mu\text{s}}^{5 \, \mu\text{s}} i(t) \, dt = 10^{-2} \cdot \frac{-1}{10^5} \left[ 0.6065 - 1.6487 \right] = 10^{-2} \cdot \frac{-1}{10^5} \cdot (-1.0422) = 1.0422 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C}.
\]
The average current is:
\[
I_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1.0422 \times 10^{-7}}{10^{-5}} = 0.010422 \, \text{A} = 10.42 \, \text{mA}.
\]

### Part (b)
The current is given as \( i(t) = 12 \cos[1000t + \pi/6] \, \text{A} \). To find the average current over \( 0 < t < \pi/3 \, \text{ms} \), we compute:
\[
I_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{t_2 - t_1} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} i(t) \, dt.
\]
The integral of \( i(t) \) is:
\[
\int i(t) \, dt = \int
