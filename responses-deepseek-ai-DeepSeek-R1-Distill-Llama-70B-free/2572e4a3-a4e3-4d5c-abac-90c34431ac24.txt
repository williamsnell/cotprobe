Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically about abelian groups. Hmm, I remember that in group theory, an abelian group is one where the group operation is commutative. That means for any two elements g and h in the group G, g * h equals h * g. Right, that's the definition.

The question is asking which of the options A through I must be true for an abelian group G. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g, h in G. Wait, what does this mean? So, squaring the product of g and h is the same as the product of their squares. Let me think about this. In a group, (gh)^2 is ghgh. Since the group is abelian, gh = hg, so this becomes hgg h, which is g^2 h^2. Oh, right! So in an abelian group, this holds because you can swap the g and h in the middle. So A seems correct because the group is abelian, so the elements commute, making the rearrangement possible.

Option B: g = h for every g, h in G. That would mean all elements are equal, so the group has only one element, which is the identity. But that's only true if the group is trivial. But the question just says G is abelian, not necessarily trivial. So B is not necessarily true.

Option C: g = g^-1 for every g in G. That would mean every element is its own inverse. So g squared would be the identity. But is this always true for abelian groups? No, because in an abelian group, you can have elements of any order. For example, in the integers modulo 5 under addition, which is abelian, the inverse of 2 is 3 because 2+3=5â‰¡0 mod5. So 2 is not equal to its inverse. So C isn't necessarily true.

Option D: G has a prime number of elements. Well, abelian groups can have any order, not just primes. For example, the Klein four-group has order 4, which is not prime. So D is not necessarily true.

Option E: g = g^2 for every g in G. That would mean every element squared is itself. Which would imply that every element has order 2. But that's only true for an elementary abelian 2-group. But again, not all abelian groups are like that. For example, in the integers mod 3 under addition, 1+1=2, which is not 1, so 1 is not equal to its square. So E is not true.

Option F: G has exactly one element. That's the trivial group. But the question doesn't state that G is trivial, only that it's abelian. So F isn't necessarily true.

Option G: g = e for every g in G, where e is the identity. That's the same as saying the group is trivial, which again isn't necessarily the case. So G isn't correct.

Option H: G is of finite order. Abelian groups can be finite or infinite. For example, the integers under addition are an infinite abelian group. So H isn't necessarily true.

Option I: G is of infinite order. Similarly, this isn't necessarily true because abelian groups can be finite, like the cyclic group of order 5. So I isn't correct either.

So going back, the only option that must be true is option A. Because in an abelian group, the operation is commutative, which allows (gh)^2 to become g^2 h^2.

In an abelian group \( G \), the group operation is commutative, meaning \( g \cdot h = h \cdot g \) for all \( g, h \in G \). This property allows us to analyze each option:

- **Option A**: \((g \cdot h)^2 = g^2 \cdot h^2\) for every \( g, h \in G \). This holds because \( (g \cdot h)^2 = g \cdot h \cdot g \cdot h \), and since \( G \) is abelian, we can rearrange to \( g \cdot g \cdot h \cdot h = g^2 \cdot h^2 \). Thus, A is true.

- **Option B**: \( g = h \) for every \( g, h \in G \). This would imply all elements are equal, making \( G \) trivial (only the identity element). However, \( G \) is not necessarily trivial, so B is false.

- **Option C**: \( g = g^{-1} \) for every \( g \in G \). This would mean every element is its own inverse, but this is not true for all abelian groups. For example, in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) under addition, the inverse of 2 is 3, not 2 itself. Thus, C is false.

- **Option D**: \( G \) has a prime number of elements. Abelian groups can have any order, not just prime. For example, the Klein four-group has order 4, which is not prime. Thus, D is false.

- **Option E**: \( g = g^2 \) for every \( g \in G \). This would imply every element has order 2, which is only true for elementary abelian 2-groups. For example, in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) under addition, 1 is not equal to \( 1 + 1 = 2 \). Thus, E is false.

- **Option F**: \( G \) has exactly one element. This is only true for the trivial group, but \( G \) is not necessarily trivial. Thus, F is false.

- **Option G**: \( g = e \) for every \( g \in G \), where \( e \) is the identity element. This is equivalent to \( G \) being trivial, which is not necessarily the case. Thus, G is false.

- **Option H**: \( G \) is of finite order. Abelian groups can be finite or infinite. For example, the integers under addition are an infinite abelian group. Thus, H is false.

- **Option I**: \( G \) is of infinite order. While some abelian groups are infinite, others are finite (e.g., cyclic groups of finite order). Thus, I is false.

The only option that must be true for an abelian group \( G \) is **A**.
