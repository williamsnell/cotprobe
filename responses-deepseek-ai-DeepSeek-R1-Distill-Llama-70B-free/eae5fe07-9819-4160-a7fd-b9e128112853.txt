Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by purging or other compensatory behaviors. It's a serious mental health condition with both psychological and physical aspects.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one and see what I know.

Option A: It is not useful to discuss weight with patients. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I think in eating disorders, sometimes weight can be a sensitive topic, but maybe it's addressed in treatment. I'll come back to this.

Option B: Treatment should focus solely on physical symptoms. No, that doesn't sound right. Bulimia is a mental health issue, so treatment should address psychological aspects as well. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Therapies should primarily focus on food avoidance tactics. Wait, avoidance might not be the best approach. I think therapy usually deals with why the person is avoiding food or bingeing, not just avoiding it. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Use of antipsychotic medication is first-line treatment. Antipsychotics aren't typically first-line for Bulimia. I think antidepressants, like SSRIs, are more commonly used. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: The first approach is to discuss body image. Body image issues are a big part of eating disorders. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Bulimia often addresses distorted body image. So E might be correct, but I'm not certain yet.

Option F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit. Fluoxetine is an SSRI, and I remember that it's approved for treating Bulimia. So F sounds correct.

Option G: Treatment should prioritize on patients' social relationships. While social support is important, I don't think it's the primary focus of treatment. So G might not be the best answer.

Option H: Treatments should target exclusively on purging practices. No, because purging is just one symptom. Treatment needs to address the underlying issues too. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The main treatment approach is diet control. Diet control might be part of it, but it's not the main approach. Treatment usually involves therapy and possibly medication. So I is probably wrong.

Option J: Treatment should ignore the psychological aspects of the disorder. That's definitely not right. Psychological aspects are central to treatment. So J is incorrect.

Now, going back to the options. The question asks which statement is correct. So which options are correct?

From what I remember, the first-line treatment for Bulimia Nervosa is CBT, which would include addressing body image (E) and possibly using medication like Fluoxetine (F). So both E and F could be correct, but looking at the options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, the options are A to J, each a separate option. So the correct answer could be E or F. Let me think more.

Fluoxetine is indeed used. I recall that it's an SSRI and is effective for Bulimia. So F would be correct. E, discussing body image, is part of the therapy, especially in CBT, which is a first-line approach. So both E and F are correct statements.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So which of the options is correct.

Looking back at the options, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps E and F are both correct, but in the options, they're separate.

Wait, no. Each option is a possible correct statement. So the question is which single option is correct.

Wait, the options are all separate, so we have to choose one.

Wait, the question is "It is correct to state that for the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa:"

So which of these options is a correct statement.

Let me think again. Fluoxetine (F) is correct because it's an SSRI used in treatment. So F is correct.

E is discussing body image as the first approach. I think that's part of CBT, but is it the first approach? Or is it more about the behaviors first?

Alternatively, some treatments might start by stabilizing eating habits. Or maybe body image is a key aspect addressed early on.

Another point: The NICE guidelines for Bulimia Nervosa recommend CBT as the first-line treatment. CBT for BN would include addressing cognitive distortions, including body image concerns. So E could be correct.

Wait, but what's the first approach? I'm not sure if discussing body image is the very first step. Maybe the initial steps involve establishing a regular eating pattern to reduce bingeing and purging. But I'm not certain.

However, I know that Fluoxetine is definitely considered beneficial, so F is correct.

Wait, looking at the options, let me make sure. The options are:

E: The first approach is to discuss body image.

F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit.

So both could be correct, but the question is which option is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps both E and F are correct, but the options don't allow selecting multiple. So the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question is which statement is correct. So I need to pick the correct statement among the options.

So F is definitely correct because Fluoxetine is used. What about E?

In CBT for BN, the therapy often starts with education about the disorder, then moves to self-monitoring, then addressing cognitive distortions, including body image. So perhaps discussing body image isn't the first approach but comes later. So maybe E is not the correct statement as the first approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the first approach in treatment is not to discuss body image but to address the eating habits. So if E says it's the first approach, that might be incorrect.

So the correct answer would be F: Fluoxetine is considered of benefit.

Wait, but another thought: The first-line treatment is CBT, which does include addressing body image. So E could still be correct, but maybe E isn't the first approach.

Alternatively, maybe the first approach is to assess the patient's physical condition and ensure they're not in immediate medical danger. But that's not one of the options.

So, considering all this, F seems correct.

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa (BN):

- **Option A**: "It is not useful to discuss weight with patients." This is incorrect because weight can be a relevant topic in treatment, though it must be handled sensitively.

- **Option B**: "Treatment should focus solely on physical symptoms." This is incorrect because BN is a mental health disorder requiring psychological intervention alongside physical care.

- **Option C**: "Therapies should primarily focus on food avoidance tactics." This is incorrect because avoidance tactics do not address the root causes of BN.

- **Option D**: "Use of antipsychotic medication is first-line treatment." This is incorrect because antipsychotics are not first-line; antidepressants like SSRIs are more commonly used.

- **Option E**: "The first approach is to discuss body image." While body image is an important aspect of treatment, it may not necessarily be the first approach. Treatment often begins with stabilizing eating habits or addressing behaviors.

- **Option F**: "Fluoxetine is considered of benefit." This is correct. Fluoxetine, an SSRI, is approved and widely used as an effective treatment for BN.

- **Option G**: "Treatment should prioritize on patients' social relationships." While social support is important, it is not the primary focus of treatment.

- **Option H**: "Treatments should target exclusively on purging practices." This is incorrect because treatment must address the underlying psychological issues, not just symptoms like purging.

- **Option I**: "The main treatment approach is diet control." This is incorrect because treatment involves more than just diet control, including therapy and medication.

- **Option J**: "Treatment should ignore the psychological aspects of the disorder." This is incorrect because psychological aspects are central to treatment.

The most accurate statement is **Option F**, as Fluoxetine is a well-established treatment for BN. While discussing body image (Option E) is part of therapy, it may not be the first approach. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F**
