The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

On the basis of scientific studies showing a causal relationship between the consumption of "red meat" (principally beef) and certain forms of cancer, a federal statute prohibits all commercial advertising of red meat products. The statute does not, however, restrict the sale of red meat products. Producers of red meat have challenged the statute as a violation of their free speech rights protected by the First Amendment. Is the court likely to find the statute constitutional?

Options:

A: Yes, because it is directly related to the government's interest in preventing health risks.
B: No, because it unfairly targets a specific industry.
C: Yes, because it only restricts commercial advertising, not personal speech.
D: No, because it is more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest in preventing certain cancers.
E: Yes, because it restricts potentially harmful information from reaching the public.
F: No, because it does not provide an alternative method for meat producers to advertise their products.
G: No, because it does not serve a substantial government interest.
H: Yes, because it serves a legitimate government interest in protecting public health.
I: Yes, because it does not affect speech protected by the First Amendment.
J: No, because it violates the producers' right to commercial speech.

Okay, so I've got this question about First Amendment rights and a federal statute. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that there's a federal statute prohibiting all commercial advertising of red meat products because studies show a causal link between red meat consumption and certain cancers. The producers are challenging this as a violation of their free speech. The question is whether the court would find the statute constitutional.

Hmm, I remember that commercial speech has some First Amendment protection but not as much as, say, political speech. The Supreme Court has established a test for regulating commercial speech, I think it's called the Central Hudson test. Let me recall what that involves.

The Central Hudson test has four parts: 
1. Is the speech true commercial speech? Like, does it propose a transaction. Here, yes, because it's advertising red meat.
2. Is the speech misleading? The question doesn't say the ads are deceptive, so probably not.
3. Does the government have a substantial interest? The government here says it's preventing health risks, which seems substantial.
4. Is the regulation directly advancing that interest, and is it not more extensive than necessary?

Wait, the statute prohibits all commercial advertising. So even truthful ads about red meat are banned. I'm trying to remember cases where the government restricted commercial speech entirely. 

In Central Hudson itself, the court struck down a ban on advertising by public utilities to promote electricity use because the ban wasn't narrowly tailored. The court said the government could regulate but not completely ban unless it's necessary. 

So in this case, the government's interest is public health, which is definitely substantial. But the question is whether a complete ban is more extensive than necessary. Are there less restrictive means to achieve the same goal? For example, maybe requiring warning labels on ads, or restricting certain types of claims, instead of a total ban.

If the statute is a total prohibition, that might not pass the fourth prong because it's too broad. The government could have alternatives that burden speech less. So the court might find the statute unconstitutional because it's more extensive than necessary.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says No, because it's more extensive than necessary. That aligns with my thought. 

Option A says Yes because it's directly related to preventing health risks. But even if it's related, if it's not narrowly tailored, it's a problem.

Option C says Yes because it's only commercial speech. But commercial speech does have protection; a total ban might still be unconstitutional.

Option H says Yes because it serves a legitimate interest. Again, the issue is not the legitimacy but whether the means are too broad.

Option J says No because it violates commercial speech rights. But the reasoning would hinge more on the necessity and narrow tailoring.

So the correct answer is probably D or J. Wait, but in my analysis, the main issue is that the statute is too broad, so D would be the correct choice.

The court would likely find the statute unconstitutional because it fails the Central Hudson test. Specifically, while the government has a substantial interest in public health, the complete ban on commercial advertising is more extensive than necessary. There are less restrictive alternatives, such as requiring warning labels or restricting certain claims, that could achieve the government's interest without a total prohibition. Therefore, the statute is not narrowly tailored, violating the First Amendment protection for commercial speech.

Answer: D
