Okay, so I've got this question about food and gamma radiation. Hmm, I remember learning a bit about radiation in my science class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The question is asking what happens when food is exposed to gamma radiation. The options are A through J. I need to figure out the correct answer.

Gamma radiation is a type of ionizing radiation, right? I think it's used for things like sterilizing medical instruments and sometimes food. Oh wait, food irradiation! I remember that now. So when food is irradiated, it's done to kill bacteria and extend shelf life. But does it make the food radioactive?

Wait, I think I read that when food is exposed to gamma rays, it doesn't become radioactive itself. Because gamma rays don't induce radioactivity in the food. The process is called something like "cold pasteurization" because it doesn't heat the food. So the food remains safe and doesn't glow or anything.

Looking at the options, option B says the food becomes slightly radioactive. No, I think that's incorrect. Option G says the food doesn't become radioactive. That sounds right. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option E says it will glow in the dark. No, because if it's not radioactive, it won't glow. Option C suggests it becomes carcinogenic, but irradiation is meant to kill harmful things, not create them. So C is wrong. Option D says inedible, which isn't true because irradiated food is still edible. Option F says it spoils faster, but irradiation usually makes it last longer by killing microbes. So F is incorrect.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is G.

When food is exposed to gamma radiation, it undergoes a process often referred to as "cold pasteurization." This method is used to eliminate harmful bacteria and extend the shelf life of food without significantly altering its temperature or nutritional content. Importantly, gamma radiation does not make the food radioactive. The food remains safe, edible, and does not glow or become toxic. Among the options provided, the correct answer is that the food does not become radioactive.

Answer: G
