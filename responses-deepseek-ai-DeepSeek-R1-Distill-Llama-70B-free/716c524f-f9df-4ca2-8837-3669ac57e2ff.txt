Okay, so I have this physics problem here about radiant intensity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: What is the radiant intensity of a Lambertian emitter which projects 50mW into a hemisphere? And there are a bunch of options from A to J.

Wait, I remember that Lambertian emitters have something to do with how light is distributed in all directions. Oh right, a Lambertian surface emits light with an intensity that follows Lambert's cosine law. So the intensity depends on the cosine of the angle from the normal.

But wait, what's the formula for radiant intensity in this case? I think the total power emitted is related to the intensity and the solid angle. The formula for the total power P is the integral of the intensity I over the solid angle Ω, multiplied by the area or something? Or wait, no, for a Lambertian emitter, there's a simpler approach.

Oh right, the radiant intensity I for a Lambertian surface is given by I = P_total / (π * A), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the total power P emitted into a hemisphere is equal to I * Ω, where Ω is the solid angle of a hemisphere.

Wait, no. Wait, the solid angle of a hemisphere is 2π steradians. Because a full sphere is 4π, so a hemisphere is half that, which is 2π.

So if the total power P is 50mW, that's 0.05 Watts. Then, the radiant intensity I is P divided by the solid angle Ω. So I = P / Ω.

But wait, let me make sure. For a Lambertian emitter, the intensity is constant across the hemisphere, right? So the total power P is the intensity I multiplied by the solid angle Ω. So P = I * Ω → I = P / Ω.

Yeah, that makes sense because if I is in W/sr, then multiplying by sr gives W, which is power.

So Ω is 2π sr for a hemisphere. So I = 0.05 W / (2π sr). Let me compute that.

0.05 divided by 2 is 0.025. Then 0.025 divided by π. Pi is approximately 3.1416. So 0.025 / 3.1416 is about 0.00795 W/sr.

Looking at the options:

Option H is 0.00795 (W/sr). That must be the correct answer.

Wait a second, did I get the solid angle right? Oh yes, a hemisphere is 2π steradians. So the calculation should be correct.

To determine the radiant intensity of a Lambertian emitter that projects 50 mW into a hemisphere, we use the relationship between total power, radiant intensity, and solid angle. The total power \( P \) is related to the radiant intensity \( I \) and the solid angle \( \Omega \) by:

\[
P = I \cdot \Omega
\]

Rearranging for \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{P}{\Omega}
\]

The total power \( P \) is given as 50 mW, which is \( 0.05 \, \text{W} \). The solid angle of a hemisphere is \( \Omega = 2\pi \, \text{sr} \). Substituting these values:

\[
I = \frac{0.05}{2\pi}
\]

First, \( 0.05 \div 2 = 0.025 \). Then, \( 0.025 \div \pi \approx 0.00795 \, \text{W/sr} \).

Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: 0.00795 (W/sr)**.
