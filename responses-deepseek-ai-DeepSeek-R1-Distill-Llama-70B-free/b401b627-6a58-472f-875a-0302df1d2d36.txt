Question:

On February 1, a man conveys his orchard to a gardener, and the gardener duly records the conveyance. The following day, the gardener conveys the property to a landscaper; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the gardener executes an identical conveyance of the orchard to a friend. The friend gives the gardener a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper. The landscaper, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to an investor, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the investor purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the landscaper and duly records the deed. Suppose that the jurisdiction in which the property is located has a pure race statute as their deed recordation law. Under these circumstances, which of the aforementioned parties would ultimately prevail?

Options:

A: The gardener.
B: The investor.
C: The friend.
D: The landscaper and the friend jointly.
E: None of the parties, the original man reclaims the property.
F: The friend and the investor jointly.
G: The landscaper.
H: The investor's agent.
I: The jurisdiction in which the property is located.
J: The gardener's friend.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. It's about recording deeds and who ends up with the property. Let's break it down step by step.

So, the scenario starts on February 1. A man conveys his orchard to a gardener, and the gardener records the conveyance. So, the man transfers ownership to the gardener, and the gardener properly records it. That means as of February 1, the gardener owns the orchard, and it's recorded.

The next day, February 2, the gardener conveys the property to a landscaper. But she doesn't record her deed. So now, the gardener transferred it to the landscaper, but the record still shows the gardener as the owner because the landscaper hasn't recorded. But wait, the question says it's a pure race jurisdiction. I remember that in a pure race statute, the first person to record their deed prevails, regardless of notice. But I might be mixing it up with notice or race-notice statutes. Let me think.

On February 4, the gardener executes an identical conveyance to a friend. The friend gives a $100,000 check and records the conveyance. But here's the catch: the friend has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper. So the friend knew about the landscaper's deed before recording. But the landscaper hasn't recorded yet as of February 4, because she records on February 6. So the friend records on February 4, before the landscaper does.

Then, the friend conveys his interest to an investor on February 5. The investor pays $115,000 to the friend and records the deed on February 5, without notice of the conveyance to the landscaper. But wait, the friend's conveyance to the investor is on February 5, and the investor records that same day. However, the landscaper records her deed on February 6.

The question is, who ends up with the property? The options are various parties, but I think it's between the landscaper and the investor.

Let me map out the timeline:

- Feb 1: Man → Gardener (recorded Feb 1)
- Feb 2: Gardener → Landscaper (not recorded yet)
- Feb 4: Gardener → Friend (recorded Feb 4). Friend knows about the Feb 2 conveyance.
- Feb 5: Friend → Investor (recorded Feb 5). Investor has no notice of Feb 2 conveyance.
- Feb 6: Landscaper records her deed.

In a pure race jurisdiction, the rule is that the first to record their deed without notice of earlier conveyances wins. But wait, pure race is about the race to record, not about notice. So the first to record, even if they had notice, as long as they didn't have notice at the time of their purchase.

Wait, no. Let me clarify the types of recording statutes:

- Race: the first to record prevails, regardless of notice.
- Notice: a subsequent purchaser who records first and without notice of prior conveyance prevails over a prior unrecorded conveyance.
- Race-notice: a subsequent purchaser who records first and without notice of prior conveyance prevails.

In this case, it's a pure race statute. So it's just about who records first.

So let's see the chain:

Gardener owns it after Feb 1.

On Feb 2, Gardener conveys to Landscaper, but doesn't record.

On Feb 4, Gardener conveys to Friend, who records on Feb 4. At that point, Friend's deed is recorded.

But wait, Friend had actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to Landscaper. In a race statute, does that matter? Because in pure race, it's only about who records first. Notice doesn't come into play. So even if Friend knew about the prior conveyance, as long as he records before the prior conveyance is recorded, he wins.

But Landscaper records on Feb 6. So Friend recorded on Feb 4, before Landscaper's recording on Feb 6. So Friend's recording is earlier.

Wait, but in pure race, the subsequent purchaser (Friend) records before the prior purchaser (Landscaper) records. So Friend's deed, being recorded first, would take priority. So the Friend would have a better claim than the Landscaper.

But wait, the Friend then conveys to the Investor on Feb 5, and records on Feb 5. Wait, no, the Friend records on Feb 4, and then on Feb 5, conveys to Investor, who records on Feb 5. So Investor's deed is recorded on the same day as the conveyance from Friend to Investor.

But the Landscaper records on Feb 6, after the Friend and after the Investor's recording. So the Friend and Investor have earlier recordings than the Landscaper.

But here's another point: the Friend had actual knowledge of the prior conveyance when he took the deed from the Gardener. So in a pure race statute, does that affect anything? Because in a race statute, it's purely about the recording, not about notice. So even though Friend knew, he still can gain priority by recording first.

So Friend records on Feb 4, which is before Landscaper's recording on Feb 6. So Friend's deed takes priority. Then Friend sells to Investor, who records on Feb 5. So the Investor would take from the Friend, who had a valid title because he recorded first.

Wait, but when the Friend sells to the Investor, the Investor must have a clear title. But if the Friend's title is already under attack because the Landscaper's conveyance was prior but recorded later, would that affect the Investor?

Wait, the Landscaper's conveyance was on Feb 2, but recorded on Feb 6. The Friend's conveyance was on Feb 4, recorded on Feb 4. So under pure race, Friend's recording (Feb 4) is before Landscaper's (Feb 6), so Friend's deed is valid against the Landscaper. So the Friend gets the property, free of the Landscaper's claim.

Then, the Friend conveys to the Investor on Feb 5, and the Investor records on Feb 5. So the Investor's title is valid because the Friend had good title when he conveyed it.

Wait, but what about the timing? The Friend records on Feb 4, the Investor records on Feb 5. So Investor's recording is after the Friend's, but the Friend's is valid because it was recorded before the Landscaper's. So the Investor would take the property from the Friend, and since the Friend's title is valid, the Investor's title is also valid.

But wait, the Landscaper recorded on Feb 6, which is after the Friend and the Investor. So the Landscaper's recording comes too late. Therefore, the Investor, who recorded on Feb 5, would have a better claim than the Landscaper.

So the chain is:

Man → Gardener (recorded Feb 1)

Gardener → Landscaper (Feb 2, not recorded until Feb 6)

Gardener → Friend (Feb 4, recorded Feb 4)

Friend → Investor (Feb 5, recorded Feb 5)

Landscaper records on Feb 6.

In a pure race state, the first to record without regard to notice. So Friend beats Landscaper because Feb 4 < Feb 6.

Then, Friend sells to Investor, who records on Feb 5. So Investor's recording is after Friend's but before Landscaper's. So the Investor's title is derived from Friend, who had already perfected title by recording first. So the Investor's title is valid, even though the Landscaper later records.

Wait, but when the Investor records on Feb 5, the Friend's deed was already recorded on Feb 4. So as between the Friend and the Landscaper, Friend's recording is earlier, so Friend has better title. So when Friend conveys to Investor, the Investor gets that better title, and records it on Feb 5.

So the Investor's deed would be valid, because the Friend had good title when he conveyed it.

So the Investor would prevail over the Landscaper because the Friend's recording was earlier, and the Investor's recording is also earlier than the Landscaper's.

So the ultimate owner would be the Investor.

But wait, let's think again. The Friend had actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the Landscaper when he took his deed. Does that affect anything in a pure race jurisdiction?

In pure race, the rule is that the first to record a conveyance will prevail over any prior unrecorded conveyance, regardless of notice. So even if the Friend had knowledge, he can still take priority by recording first.

So the Friend, by recording on Feb 4, takes priority over the Landscaper, who records later on Feb 6. So the Friend's title is good, and when he sells to the Investor, the Investor's title is also good.

Therefore, the Investor, having recorded on Feb 5, would have a valid claim against the Landscaper.

So the parties are:

- Landscaper: recorded on Feb 6, which is after Friend's recording on Feb 4.

- Investor: recorded on Feb 5, which is after Friend's but before Landscaper's.

So the Investor's title comes from the Friend, who had a better title because he recorded first.

Thus, the Investor would prevail against the Landscaper.

Wait, but the question is about who ultimately prevails. So the Investor's claim is better because his title comes from the Friend, who had a better title than the Landscaper. Therefore, the Investor would win.

Looking at the options:

B: The investor.

G: The landscaper.

So the correct answer should be B.

But wait, another angle: when the Investor buys from the Friend on Feb 5, does he have any notice of the prior conveyance to the Landscaper? The question says the Investor had no notice of the conveyance to the landscaper. But in a pure race statute, notice doesn't matter because it's only about the recording race. So the Investor's lack of notice is irrelevant. But the Friend had notice, but that also doesn't matter in pure race because the Friend just needs to record first.

So the hierarchy is:

1. Gardener records on Feb 1.

2. Landscaper gets it on Feb 2 but doesn't record until Feb 6.

3. Friend gets it on Feb 4, records Feb 4. So Friend's interest is recorded before Landscaper's.

4. Friend sells to Investor on Feb 5, who records on Feb 5. So Investor's recording is after Friend's but before Landscaper's.

So when the Landscaper records on Feb 6, her recording is after both Friend and Investor. Therefore, the Investor's title is valid.

So the Investor would prevail.

Thus, the answer is B: The investor.
</think>

In this scenario, the jurisdiction follows a pure race statute, meaning the first party to record a deed prevails, regardless of notice. The key events and their implications are as follows:

1. **February 1**: The man conveys the orchard to the gardener, and the gardener records the conveyance. At this point, the gardener owns the property, and the record reflects this.

2. **February 2**: The gardener conveys the property to the landscaper, but the landscaper does not record the deed at this time.

3. **February 4**: The gardener conveys the property to the friend, and the friend records the deed on the same day. Although the friend has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper, this does not matter under a pure race statute, as notice is irrelevant. The friend's recording on February 4 takes priority over the landscaper's unrecorded deed.

4. **February 5**: The friend conveys the property to the investor, who records the deed on the same day. The investor has no notice of the prior conveyance to the landscaper, but this is irrelevant under a pure race statute. The investor's title is derived from the friend, who had already perfected their title by recording first.

5. **February 6**: The landscaper finally records her deed, but this is too late. Under the pure race statute, the friend's recording on February 4 and the investor's recording on February 5 both precede the landscaper's recording on February 6. Therefore, the investor's title prevails over the landscaper's claim.

In summary, the investor ultimately prevails because their title is derived from the friend, who recorded first, giving the friend and subsequently the investor priority over the landscaper under the pure race statute.

**Answer: B**
