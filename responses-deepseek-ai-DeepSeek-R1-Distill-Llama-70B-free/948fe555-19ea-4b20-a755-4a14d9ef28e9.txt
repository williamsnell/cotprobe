Okay, so I've got this problem here about Scotch whiskey aging and maximizing the present discounted value (PDV). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my calculus, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The problem says that the value of one dollar of Scotch at time t is given by V(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t). And the interest rate is 5 percent. I need to find after how many years a person should sell to maximize the PDV.

Wait, PDV is the Present Discounted Value, right? So the formula for PDV would be V(t) divided by (1 + r)^t, where r is the interest rate. Oh wait, because you're discounting the future value back to present value. So PDV(t) = V(t) / (1 + r)^t.

But V(t) is given as exp(2√t - 0.15t). So putting it together, PDV(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t) / (1.05)^t. Wait, because the interest rate is 5%, so r = 0.05.

Alternatively, since exp(a) / exp(b) is exp(a - b), maybe I can combine the exponents. Let's see, 1.05^t is the same as e^(t ln(1.05)). So PDV(t) = exp(2√t -0.15t - (ln(1.05)) t). Because dividing by exp(something) is the same as subtracting that something in the exponent.

Let me compute ln(1.05) first. I remember ln(1) is 0, ln(e)=1, and ln(1.05) is approximately 0.04879. So maybe about 0.0488.

So PDV(t) = exp[2√t - 0.15t - 0.0488 t]. Combine the t terms: -0.15t - 0.0488t = -0.1988t. So PDV(t) = exp( 2√t - 0.1988 t ).

To find the maximum PDV, I need to find the time t where the derivative of PDV(t) with respect to t is zero. Because the maximum occurs where the slope is zero.

So let's compute the derivative of PDV(t). Since PDV(t) is exp(f(t)), where f(t) = 2√t - 0.1988 t, the derivative of exp(f(t)) is exp(f(t)) multiplied by f'(t).

So PDV’(t) = exp(2√t -0.1988 t) * [ derivative of (2√t -0.1988 t) ].

Let me find f’(t): the derivative of 2√t is 2*(1/(2√t)) )= 1/√t. The derivative of -0.1988 t is -0.1988. So f’(t) = (1/√t) - 0.1988.

Set PDV’(t) to zero. Since exp(...) is always positive, the only way for the derivative to be zero is when f’(t) = 0. So:

1/√t - 0.1988 = 0.

Solving for t:

1/√t = 0.1988

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

1/t = (0.1988)^2.

Calculate (0.1988)^2: 0.1988 * 0.1988. Let's approximate. 0.2^2 is 0.04, so this should be a bit less. Let me compute 0.1988*0.1988:

0.1988 * 0.1988 ≈ 0.03952. So 1/t ≈ 0.03952.

So t ≈ 1 / 0.03952 ≈ 25.32 years.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 25, option B is 30. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculation.

Wait, let me compute (0.1988)^2 more accurately. 0.1988 * 0.1988:

Let's compute 0.1988 squared.

Calculate 0.1988 * 0.1988:

1988 * 1988 = ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 0.1988 * 0.2 would be 0.03976, but since 0.1988 is less than 0.2 by 0.0012, maybe I can adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (0.2 - 0.0012)^2 = 0.2² - 2*(0.2)*(0.0012) + (0.0012)^2 = 0.04 - 0.00048 + 0.00000144 ≈ 0.03952144.

So 0.1988² ≈ 0.039521.

So 1/t ≈ 0.039521 → t ≈ 1 / 0.039521 ≈ 25.32 years.

So t is approximately 25.32 years. Looking at the options, option A is 25, option E is 22, H is 20, etc. So the closest is 25 years.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check because sometimes when we take derivatives, especially with square roots, it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the derivative. f(t) = 2√t - 0.1988 t.

f’(t) = (2)*(1/(2√t)) ) - 0.1988 → which simplifies to (1/√t) - 0.1988. So yes, correct.

Setting that to zero gives 1/√t = 0.1988 → √t = 1/0.1988 → √t ≈ 5.033.

Wait, because 1 divided by 0.1988 is approximately 5.033. So t = (5.033)^2 ≈ 25.33 years.

So the maximum occurs at about 25.33 years. So the closest option is A:25.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, the PDV is V(t) discounted by the interest rate. So yes, PDV(t) = V(t) * e^(-rt), or wait, no. Wait, the interest rate is 5%, so the discount factor is (1 + r)^t, so PDV is V(t) / (1.05)^t. But wait, V(t) is given as exp(2√t - 0.15t), which is e^{2√t - 0.15t}.

So PDV(t) = e^{2√t -0.15t} / e^{rt} → e^{2√t -0.15t - rt}.

r is 0.05, so rt = 0.05t. So the exponent is 2√t -0.15t -0.05t = 2√t - 0.20t.

Wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake earlier? Because I thought that the discounting would involve r = 0.05. Oh wait no, because 1.05^t is e^{t ln 1.05}, which is approximately e^{0.04879 t}, not e^{0.05 t}.

Wait, it's better to compute the exact value. So ln(1.05) is approximately 0.04879. So the exponent in PDV(t) is 2√t -0.15t - 0.04879 t = 2√t - (0.15 + 0.04879) t → 2√t - 0.19879 t.

So that's where the 0.1988 comes from. So the derivative is 1/√t - 0.19879.

Wait, so when I set 1/√t = 0.19879 → √t = 1/0.19879 ≈ 5.033 → t≈ (5.033)^2=25.33.

So the correct time is about 25.33 years, so the closest option is A:25.

Looking at the options, option A is 25, which is the closest. So the answer should be A.

To determine the optimal time to sell the Scotch whiskey and maximize the Present Discounted Value (PDV), we start with the given value function:

\[
V(t) = \exp\left(2\sqrt{t} - 0.15t\right)
\]

The PDV is calculated by discounting the future value back to the present using the interest rate \( r = 0.05 \). The formula for PDV is:

\[
\text{PDV}(t) = \frac{V(t)}{(1 + r)^t} = \exp\left(2\sqrt{t} - 0.15t - rt\right)
\]

Since \( r = 0.05 \), the exponent becomes:

\[
\text{PDV}(t) = \exp\left(2\sqrt{t} - 0.1988t\right)
\]

To maximize the PDV, we take the derivative of the exponent \( f(t) = 2\sqrt{t} - 0.1988t \) with respect to \( t \):

\[
f'(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} - 0.1988
\]

Setting \( f'(t) = 0 \) to find the critical point:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} - 0.1988 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} = 0.1988
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{t} = (0.1988)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{1}{(0.1988)^2}
\]

Calculating \( (0.1988)^2 \approx 0.03952 \), we find:

\[
t \approx \frac{1}{0.03952} \approx 25.32 \, \text{years}
\]

Thus, the optimal time to sell is approximately 25.32 years. Among the given options, the closest value is **25 years**.
