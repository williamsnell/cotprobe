Question:

Dan read a list of 30 vocabulary words only once. If he is typical and shows the serial position effect, we would expect that the words he remembers two days later are

Options:

A: at the end of the list
B: words that were repeated in the list
C: the longest words in the list
D: words related to a specific topic
E: the last ten words he read
F: the shortest words in the list
G: at the beginning of the list
H: in the middle of the list
I: distributed throughout the list

Okay, so I have this question about the serial position effect. I remember that the serial position effect is about how people remember items from a list based on their position. I think it's like when you try to recall a list of things, you tend to remember the ones at the beginning and the end better than the ones in the middle. Is that right?

So the question is about Dan who read 30 vocabulary words once. Two days later, which words would he remember if he's typical and shows the serial position effect. The options are A to J, each giving different possibilities.

Wait, the serial position effect specifically refers to the tendency to remember the first and last items better. But wait, I also remember something about the primacy effect (beginning) and the recency effect (end). So people remember the first few items because they're processed more deeply, maybe, and the last few because they're still fresh in memory.

But wait, if Dan is tested two days later, which effect would dominate? Because the recency effect might fade over time. So the first items (primacy) might be remembered better after a delay, while the most recent items might be forgotten more quickly.

So the options are: the beginning or the end. Looking at the options, option G is "at the beginning of the list" and option E is "the last ten he read". Option A is "at the end", so maybe that's a subset of the last ten.

Wait, but the serial position effect when tested after a delay would lead to better recall of the first items because the last items' memory would have faded. So Dan would remember the words at the beginning better than the end two days later.

So the correct answer would be G: at the beginning of the list. Because after some time, the recency effect diminishes, and the primacy effect remains stronger.

Alternatively, I should make sure I'm not mixing up the concepts. Some sources say that immediate recall shows a strong recency effect, but after a delay, the primacy effect is more pronounced because the first items are more likely to be stored in long-term memory. So in this case, since it's two days later, the beginning of the list would be remembered more.

Therefore, the answer should be G.

The serial position effect refers to the tendency to remember items at the beginning (primacy effect) and end (recency effect) of a list better than those in the middle. When tested after a delay, the recency effect fades, leaving the primacy effect more prominent. Since Dan is tested two days later, he would likely remember the words at the beginning of the list better. 

Answer: G
