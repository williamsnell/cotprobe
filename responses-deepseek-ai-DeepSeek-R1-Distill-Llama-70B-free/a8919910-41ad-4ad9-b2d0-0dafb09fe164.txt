Okay, so I've got this FM receiver problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because FM modulation and receiver design aren't my strongest topics. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem states that two FM receivers have the same output signal-to-noise ratio (S_o/N_o). The formula for S_o/N_o is given as [3k²·m²(t)·A²] divided by [4π²·f_m²·2n_m·f_m]. Wait, that denominator looks a bit off. Let me parse it correctly. Oh wait, perhaps it's 4π² f_m squared multiplied by 2n_m f_m? So that would make it 4π² f_m² * 2n_m f_m, which is 8 π² n_m f_m³. Hmm, but maybe I should double-check that later.

The question is about finding the ratio of the IF bandwidths needed to pass 98% of the signal energy for two different FM signals. The two signals are:

1) k_m(t) = β ω_m cos(ω_m t)
2) k_m(t) is a Gaussian signal with power spectral density n_m/2 for |f| ≤ f_m, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Looking again, the first signal is a sinusoidal modulating signal, and the second is a Gaussian one. But what's the actual parameter we're comparing? Oh, right, the IF bandwidth required to pass 98% of the signal energy.

I remember that for FM signals, the bandwidth is related to the modulation index and the modulating frequency. But wait, the IF bandwidth here refers to the intermediate frequency bandwidth in the receiver, which is typically set to capture most of the signal's energy to minimize noise.

For an FM signal, the bandwidth is usually given by the Carson bandwidth formula: B = 2(Δf + f_m), where Δf is the frequency deviation, and f_m is the highest modulating frequency. But wait, this is for the transmitted signal's bandwidth. In the receiver, the IF bandwidth would be set to at least this to capture the signal properly.

But wait, the question is about passing 98% of the signal energy. So perhaps for each modulating signal, we need to determine the required bandwidth such that 98% of the signal's power is within that bandwidth. Then, the ratio would be the bandwidth of the first signal divided by the second, or vice versa.

Wait, the question says "ratio of the IF bandwidths of these two receivers". So I'll need to find B1/B2 or B2/B1.

Let me think about each signal.

First signal: k_m(t) is a sinusoidal function. So the modulating signal is a cosine wave. For a sinusoidal FM signal, the power is spread over a range of frequencies. The Carson's rule gives the bandwidth, but I think for a sinusoidal modulating signal, the FM signal has an infinite number of sidebands. However, the power in those sidebands decreases as you go further out. So in practice, most of the power is within a certain bandwidth.

Wait, but for a single tone modulating signal, the FM signal has sidebands spaced at intervals of the modulating frequency. The amplitude of each sideband depends on the Bessel functions, but most of the power is concentrated around the carrier and a few sidebands.

I remember that the power in the sidebands for a sinusoidal FM signal can be determined using Bessel functions. The total signal power is the sum of the squares of the Bessel function coefficients.

But in this problem, how does that relate to the required IF bandwidth? Because the IF bandwidth needs to capture 98% of the signal power. So perhaps we need to find the bandwidth where 98% of the power is contained for each case.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the second signal is a Gaussian. Let me think about that.

The second signal is a Gaussian process with a power spectral density (PSD) given as n_m/2 for |f| ≤ f_m, and zero elsewhere. So this is like a band-limited Gaussian noise. The autocorrelation function would be triangular, I think, since the Fourier transform of a rectangular PSD is a sinc function, but wait, no, the inverse Fourier transform of a rectangle is a sinc. Wait, no, the power spectral density being a rectangle implies that the autocorrelation is a sinc. But in the case of a Gaussian, perhaps it's a different shape.

Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. For a Gaussian signal with a given PSD, the bandwidth is determined by the support of the PSD. Since the PSD is flat from -f_m to f_m, the signal's autocorrelation function would be a sinc function scaled by f_m. Wait, no, the Fourier transform of a rectangular function is a sinc, so the autocorrelation would be a sinc function. But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, I think the key here is that the first signal (sinusoidal) has a different bandwidth requirement than the second (Gaussian) when it comes to capturing 98% of the signal energy.

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact approach, so let me think about Carson's bandwidth and how it applies here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the necessary bandwidth for each type of signal such that 98% of the power is within that bandwidth.

For the sinusoidal case, the FM signal has an infinite number of sidebands, but the power in them decreases. However, in practice, the Carson bandwidth B = 2(Δf + f_m) is often used as the approximate bandwidth required. But this might not directly give the 98% point.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a sinusoidal FM signal, about 98% of the power lies within the Carson bandwidth. So perhaps B_carson is the bandwidth needed to capture 98% of the power.

Wait, then let's confirm. For a sinusoidal modulating signal, the Carson bandwidth is B_c = 2(Δf + f_m). And this is supposed to contain about 98% of the signal power, I think. So the IF bandwidth should be set to B_c.

But for the Gaussian signal, the situation might be different. Since it's a random signal with a flat PSD up to f_m, the power is spread more evenly. The autocorrelation function would be a sinc-like function, but perhaps the bandwidth to capture 98% is related to f_m in some way.

Wait, for a Gaussian signal with PSD S(f) = (n_m/2) for |f| ≤ f_m and zero elsewhere, the total power is the integral of S(f) df from -f_m to f_m, which would be n_m * f_m.

But to find the bandwidth required to capture 98% of the signal's energy, we need to find the smallest bandwidth B such that the integral from -B/2 to B/2 of S(f) df equals 0.98 times the total power.

Wait, but since S(f) is flat, the integral from -B/2 to B/2 would be n_m/2 * B. So 0.98 * (n_m f_m) ) = (n_m/2) * B. Solving for B gives B = (2 * 0.98 f_m) ) = 1.96 f_m. So approximately 1.96 f_m, which would capture 98% of the power.

Wait, but that's assuming that B is centered at the carrier frequency, and the signal extends from -f_m to +f_m. Or wait, no, in this case, the signal's PSD is from -f_m to +f_m, so the total bandwidth is 2f_m. So if you set your receiver's bandwidth to B, you're integrating from -B/2 to +B/2. Wait, no, that's only if the signal is centered at zero. But in FM, the signal is centered around the carrier frequency, which is f_c. So the IF bandwidth would be the range around f_c that you need to capture.

Wait, perhaps for the Gaussian case, the required IF bandwidth to capture 98% would be B_gaussian = 2f_m * something. But earlier, I thought that the integral would require B_gaussian ≈ 1.96 f_m * 2? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the total power is P_total = integral_{-f_m}^{f_m} (n_m/2) df = n_m * f_m.

To get 98% of P_total, the integral from -B/2 to B/2 should be 0.98 * P_total.

So 0.98 * n_m f_m = integral_{-B/2}^{B/2} (n_m/2) df = (n_m/2) * B.

So 0.98 n_m f_m = (n_m/2) B → B = (2 * 0.98 f_m) ) = 1.96 f_m.

But wait, since the signal's bandwidth is from -f_m to +f_m, which is a total of 2f_m. So if the receiver's IF bandwidth is B, it needs to cover the region where the signal's power is concentrated. So perhaps the receiver's IF bandwidth for the Gaussian case would be B_gaussian = 1.96 f_m.

Wait, but the original signal's bandwidth is 2f_m (from -f_m to f_m), so 1.96 f_m would be less than 2f_m, but that can't be right because capturing 98% should require a bandwidth wider than a certain point.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The PSD is flat from -f_m to +f_m. So the total signal power is (n_m/2) * 2f_m = n_m f_m.

If the receiver's IF bandwidth is B, then the power captured is (n_m/2) * B, assuming B is less than 2f_m. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the receiver's bandwidth is centered at the carrier, which is at 0 in this case. So the captured power is the integral from -B/2 to B/2 of (n_m/2) df. That would be (n_m/2) * B.

So to have 0.98 * n_m f_m = (n_m/2) * B → B = 2 * 0.98 f_m = 1.96 f_m.

Wait, but the signal's PSD is up to f_m, so the maximum B can be is 2f_m (from -f_m to f_m). So B_gaussian would be 1.96 f_m, which is just slightly less than 2f_m. So the IF bandwidth required for the Gaussian signal to capture 98% is 1.96 f_m.

Now for the sinusoidal case, we need to find the required bandwidth to capture 98% of the signal power. As per earlier, the Carson bandwidth is B_c = 2 (Δf + f_m), which is supposed to contain about 98% of the signal power. So B_sin = B_c = 2 (Δf + f_m).

Wait, but wait. The modulating signal is k_m(t) = β ω_m cos(ω_m t). Wait, β is the modulation index, which is Δf / f_m, perhaps? Or is it the peak frequency deviation Δf divided by the modulating frequency f_m?

Wait, the modulation index for FM is usually defined as β = Δf / f_m, where Δf is the peak frequency deviation, and f_m is the modulating frequency. So in this case, the modulation index β is given, and k_m(t) would involve β times something.

Wait, the given k_m(t) is β ω_m cos(ω_m t). Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Wait, ω_m is 2π f_m, so k_m(t) would be β (2 π f_m) cos(2 π f_m t). But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's β multiplied by the derivative of the modulating signal. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the message signal and the modulating index.

Alternatively, perhaps the sinusoidal modulating signal is m(t) = cos(2π f_mt), and the frequency deviation is β times this, so the instantaneous frequency is f_c + β f_m cos(2π f_m t), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula given for S_o/N_o. The formula is (S_o / N_o) = [3k² ·m²(t) · A² ] / [4π² f_m² 2n_m f_m ].

Wait, but that denominator seems off. Let me parse the denominator again. It's written as 4π² f_m² times 2n_m f_m. So 4π² f_m squared times 2n_m f_m is 8 π² n_m f_m cubed.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the formula for S_o/N_o. I remember that for FM, the output SNR is given by (S/N) = (3 (β²) (m_rms²) ) / (2 (f_m / B) ), where B is the IF bandwidth. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up different formulas.

Alternatively, I think the output SNR for FM is given by:

(S_o / N_o) = (3 β² (m_rms)²) / (2 (n_m / (2B)) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind: the SNR at the output of an FM receiver is given by SNR = (β²) * (B_n / 2B), where B_n is the noise bandwidth. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, I recall that the output SNR after FM detection is given by:

SNR_o = (3 β² P_m) / (4 π² f_m² N_b )

Where P_m is the average power of the message signal, and N_b is the noise power in the IF bandwidth.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, let's think about the given formula:

(S_o/N_o) = [3k² m²(t) A² ] / [4π² f_m² 2n_m f_m ]

Wait, but perhaps the denominator is 4π² f_m² multiplied by 2n_m f_m, making it 8 π² n_m f_m³.

So the formula simplifies to:

(3 k² m(t)^2 A^2) / (8 π² n_m f_m^3 )

But I'm not entirely sure about the variables here. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, since both receivers have the same S_o/N_o, the ratio of their IF bandwidths will depend on the necessary bandwidths to capture 98% of the signal energy.

Wait, but for each case, the IF bandwidth depends on the signal type. So I'll need to find B1 and B2 for the two cases, then compute B1/B2 or B2/B1.

From earlier thoughts:

For the Gaussian signal, the required IF bandwidth to capture 98% is approximately 1.96 f_m.

For the sinusoidal signal, the required IF bandwidth is the Carson bandwidth, which is 2 (Δf + f_m ). And since Δf = β f_m, because the modulation index β = Δf / f_m, so Δf = β f_m.

So substituting, B_sin = 2 (β f_m + f_m ) = 2 f_m (β + 1).

Wait, but wait. I'm not sure if the Carson bandwidth contains 98% of the power. Let me double-check. I think that Carson's rule estimates that about 98% of the power is within the bandwidth B_c = 2(Δf + f_m). So that's correct.

So, B_sin = 2 (Δf + f_m) = 2 (β f_m + f_m ) = 2 f_m (β + 1).

Now, the ratio of the IF bandwidths depends on which receiver has which signal. Let's assume that the first receiver is for the sinusoidal signal (B_sin) and the second for the Gaussian (B_gaussian = 1.96 f_m).

So the ratio would be B_sin / B_gaussian = [2 f_m (β + 1)] / [1.96 f_m ] = [2 (β + 1)] / 1.96.

Simplify that: 2 / 1.96 is approximately 1.0204, so [2 (β + 1)] / 1.96 ≈ (β + 1) * 1.0204.

Wait, but we don't know the value of β. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless the given S_o/N_o formula can help us find β in terms of other parameters, which might cancel out.

Wait, the problem says that the output SNR is identical for both receivers. So the given S_o/N_o expression must hold for both cases, so perhaps the variables in the formula are functions of each case's parameters.

But the given formula for S_o/N_o is [3k² m²(t) A² ] / [4π² f_m² 2n_m f_m ].

Wait, but I think in this formula, m(t) would vary depending on the modulating signal. For the sinusoidal case, m(t) is a cosine, so its RMS value would be β ω_m / sqrt(2). Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum and RMS values.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be used to find a relation between β and other variables, but since the SNR is the same for both, perhaps the variables like k, A, and n_m are same for both receivers, leading us to relate β to something else.

Wait, but perhaps since both receivers have the same S_o/N_o, and the formula depends on m(t), which is different for each case, perhaps the ratio of the IF bandwidths will end up being determined without needing β.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express B_sin and B_gaussian in terms of variables that can be related through the given SNR expression.

Wait, but I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that the SNR is the same for both, so the formula [3k² m²(t) A² ] / [4π² f_m² 2n_m f_m ] is the same for both cases.

But for the Gaussian case, the m(t) would have a certain RMS value, and for the sinusoidal case, a different RMS. Alternatively, perhaps the m(t) terms would relate to the respective bandwidths.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the message signal m(t) in each case.

For the first case, m(t) = cos(ω_m t). So the maximum value is 1, and the RMS value is sqrt(1/2
