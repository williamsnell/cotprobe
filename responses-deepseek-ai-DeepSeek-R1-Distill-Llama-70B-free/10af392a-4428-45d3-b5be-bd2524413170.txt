Okay, so I have this question about Motivational Interviewing (MI), and I need to figure out which principle isn't used in MI. Let's see, I remember that MI is a technique used to help people resolve ambivalence and move towards making positive changes, especially in behaviors related to health issues like substance abuse.

The question gives four options: A, B, C, D. I need to find out which one is NOT a principle used in MI. Let's break down each option.

Option A says, "Does not support self-efficacy for change." Wait, MI is all about empowering the person. I think one of the key principles is to enhance self-efficacy, which is the person's belief in their ability to change. So if MI supports self-efficacy, then this option is the oppositeâ€”so this might be the correct answer, the one not used.

Option B is "Empathy through reflective listening." Reflective listening is a core component of MI. The idea is to show empathy by reflecting back what the patient is saying, which helps them feel understood and encourages them to explore their thoughts. So B is definitely a principle used in MI, meaning it's not the answer.

Option C is "Roll with resistance." I remember that MI suggests not confronting resistance head-on. Instead, you roll with it by acknowledging the patient's perspective without pushing against it. This helps to avoid strengthening the resistance. So C is a used principle, not the answer.

Option D is "Avoid direct confrontation." Yeah, MI emphasizes a non-confrontational approach. Direct confrontation can create more resistance, so MI avoids that. So D is a principle used, making it not the correct answer.

Putting it all together, the question asks which principle is NOT used. Since all options except A are principles used in MI, the answer must be A. MI does support self-efficacy, so the statement in A is incorrect as a principle of MI.

The correct answer is **A**. Motivational Interviewing (MI) supports self-efficacy, empathy through reflective listening, rolling with resistance, and avoids direct confrontation. The principle that is NOT used is "Does not support self-efficacy for change."
