Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cross-validation in the context of multiple correlation coefficients. Hmm, I remember that cross-validation is a technique used to assess the predictive performance of a model. When you have an encouraging multiple correlation coefficient initially, but it shrinks a lot upon cross-validation, something's not right. 

The question is asking what's most likely the reason for this shrinkage. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A says the criterion variable was unreliable. Wait, the criterion variable is the dependent variable. If it's unreliable, maybe the correlations would be lower because of measurement errors. But I'm not sure if that directly causes shrinkage when cross-validating. I'll keep this in mind but move on.

Option B: criterion variable was overvalued. Not sure what that means. Maybe it's like giving it too much importance? Not clear, so perhaps not the right choice.

Option C: selection of weights capitalized on chance. Oh, right! I've heard about capitalization on chance in the context of multiple regression. It refers to when the weights (coefficients) are selected based on the sample data, which might capture random noise rather than true relationships. So when you cross-validate, the model doesn't hold up because those weights were overfitted to the initial data. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option D: too few independent variables. Wait, more variables usually lead to overfitting. But if there are too few, maybe the model is underfitted. Not sure how that would cause shrinkage upon cross-validation. Maybe not the main issue here.

Option E: model not properly validated. Well, cross-validation is a form of validation. If the model wasn't validated, you wouldn't see shrinkage because you didn't test it on other data. So this might be more about the process, but the question is about why shrinkage happens when using cross-validation. So maybe E isn't the right fit.

Option F: predictors not independent. If predictors are correlated, you get multicollinearity, which can cause unstable coefficients. But does that lead to shrinkage in cross-validation? Maybe, but I'm not sure if this is the primary reason for the initial high correlation shrinking.

Option G: predictors too diverse. Diverse predictors might capture more variance, but I don't see how that would cause shrinkage. Maybe the opposite, if they are too diverse, the model might not generalize well. Not certain though.

Option H: none of the predictors were reliable. If the predictors are unreliable, their correlations with the criterion would be lower. But again, not sure if this directly causes the shrinkage when cross-validating.

Option I: selection of weights was biased. Biased in what way? Like, if there's a systematic error in selection, maybe. But I'm not sure if this leads to the shrinkage effect described.

So, going back, the main point is that in the initial study, the multiple correlation was high, but when cross-validated, it dropsâ€”this suggests overfitting. Overfitting happens when the model is too closely fit to the training data, capturing noise instead of the underlying pattern.

Capitalization on chance, as in option C, is when the selection of predictors or their weights takes advantage of random fluctuations in the data. So when you apply the model to a new dataset (cross-validation), it doesn't perform as well because those random fluctuations aren't present. That makes a lot of sense.

So the correct answer should be C.

When cross-validation results in significant shrinkage of an initially high multiple correlation coefficient, it suggests that the model's performance is not generalizing well to new data. This is often due to overfitting, where the model's weights are overly optimized to the initial dataset, capturing random noise rather than true patterns. Among the options provided:

- **Option C** directly addresses this issue by highlighting that the selection of weights capitalized on chance, meaning the model's weights were tailored to random fluctuations in the training data, leading to poor performance during cross-validation.
- Other options, such as unreliable criterion variables (A), too few independent variables (D), or multicollinearity (F), do not directly explain the shrinkage observed in cross-validation as effectively as overfitting does.

Thus, the most likely explanation is that the selection of weights capitalized on chance.
