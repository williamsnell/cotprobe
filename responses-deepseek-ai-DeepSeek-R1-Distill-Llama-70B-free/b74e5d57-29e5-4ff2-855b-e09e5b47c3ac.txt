Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the sum of two polynomials in Z_8[x]. Hmm, I've heard about polynomial rings before, so I think I can handle this. Let's see, the polynomials are f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x² - 4x + 2. I need to add them together in Z_8, which means all the coefficients will be modulo 8.

Wait, right, Z_8 is the integers modulo 8. So every time I add coefficients, I have to take the result modulo 8. Oh, and also, since these are polynomials, I should line up the like terms. So let me write down f(x) and g(x) and see what happens when I add them.

f(x) is 4x -5. Let me write that as: 0x² +4x -5. Because f(x) doesn't have an x² term, so the coefficient is zero.

g(x) is 2x² -4x +2. So let's write that down with all the terms, but probably aligned properly.

When adding, I'll add the coefficients of the same degree.

So for the x² term: f(x) has 0, g(x) has 2. So 0 + 2 = 2. But wait, in Z_8, 2 mod 8 is still 2, so that's fine. So the x² term is 2x².

Next, the x term: f(x) has 4x, g(x) has -4x. So 4 + (-4) equals 0. Oh, so the x terms cancel each other out. So the x term is 0x, which means it's not present in the final polynomial.

Now the constant term: f(x) has -5, and g(x) has +2. So adding them: (-5) + 2 = -3. But wait, in Z_8, negative numbers can be a bit tricky. Let me think: -3 mod 8 is the same as 8 -3 =5. So -3 is equivalent to 5 in Z_8.

Wait, no. Wait a second. So in Z_8, the elements are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So when adding, any number is taken mod 8. So negative numbers: -1 is 7, -2 is 6, -3 is 5, because 8-3=5. So yes, -3 mod 8 is 5.

So the constant term is 5.

Putting it all together, the sum of f(x) and g(x) is 2x² + 0x +5. Which simplifies to 2x² +5.

Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this result. Let's go through them.

Option A: x² +1 → No, our x² term is 2x².

Option B: 3x² -2x +1 → Doesn't match.

Option C: 2x² +5 → Oh, wait, that's exactly what I got. So that's a possibility.

Option D: 2x² -5x +2 → No, x term is zero and the constant is 5, not 2.

Option E: 0 → No, because we have a 2x² term.

Option F: 6x² +4x +6 → No.

Option G: 2x² -x +4 → No, because x term is -x, which isn't zero.

Option H: 2x² +4x -3 → No.

Option I: 4x²-4x+7 → No.

Option J: 6x² -x +1 → No.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the signs.

So f(x) is 4x -5. Coefficients: 4, -5.

g(x) is 2x² -4x +2. Coefficients: 2, -4, 2.

Adding term by term:

x²: 0 +2 =2 → correct.

x: 4 + (-4) =0 → correct.

Constants: (-5) +2 =-3 → which is 5 mod8 → correct.

Yes, so 2x² +5 is the sum. So option C is correct.

To find the sum of the polynomials \( f(x) = 4x - 5 \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_8[x] \), we add their coefficients term by term, taking results modulo 8.

1. **Align the polynomials by degree**:
   - \( f(x) = 0x^2 + 4x - 5 \)
   - \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \)

2. **Add the coefficients**:
   - For the \( x^2 \) term: \( 0 + 2 = 2 \), so the \( x^2 \) term is \( 2x^2 \).
   - For the \( x \) term: \( 4 + (-4) = 0 \), so the \( x \) term is \( 0x \) (not present in the final result).
   - For the constant term: \( -5 + 2 = -3 \). In \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \), \( -3 \equiv 5 \) (since \( 8 - 3 = 5 \)).

3. **Combine the results**:
   - The sum is \( 2x^2 + 5 \).

4. **Compare with the options**:
   - Option C matches exactly: \( 2x^2 + 5 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
