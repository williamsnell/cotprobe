Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the powers of Congress, specifically asking about an implied power. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my government class that the Constitution gives Congress certain powers, some explicitly and others implicitly through the Necessary and Proper Clause.

The question is asking which option is an example of an implied power. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Regulation of interstate commerce. Wait, that's actually one of the enumerated powers, right? It's in Article I, Section 8, the Commerce Clause. So that's not implied.

Option B: Power to create federal laws. That seems too broad. Congress does make laws, but I think that's inherent; maybe it's an expressed power.

Option C: Power to impeach the President. That's definitely an explicit power, mentioned in Article I, Sections 2 and 3. The House impeaches, Senate tries.

Option D: Borrowing money on the credit of the US. That's another enumerated power, part of the list in Article I, Section 8. So not implied.

Option E: Declarations of war. Explicit again, same section as above. Congress has the power to declare war.

Option F: Power to impose an income tax. Wait, that's an interesting one. Originally, the Constitution didn't explicitly allow income tax. It was after the 16th Amendment that Congress got the power, but before that, I think they tried using other powers. So maybe before the amendment, it was an implied power? Or was it? Or is it an example now of an expressed power because of the amendment.

Option G: Oversight of executive branch agencies. Oh, right! I remember this. The Constitution doesn't explicitly say Congress can oversee the executive branch, but they do this through things like hearings, investigations, and holding agencies accountable. This is considered an implied power because it's necessary for Congress to carry out its other functions, like lawmaking and appropriations.

Option H: Power to regulate immigration. I think that's based on the Commerce Clause or the Naturalization Clause, which are explicit. So maybe that's an enumerated power.

Option I: Power to approve presidential nominations. That's the advice and consent role, which is explicitly stated in Article II, Section 2.

So considering all of that, the correct answer should be option G, oversight of executive branch agencies. Because that's something Congress does that's not directly written in the Constitution but is inferred as necessary to perform their duties.

The question asks for an example of an implied power of Congress. Implied powers are those not explicitly stated in the Constitution but are inferred as necessary to carry out the powers that are explicitly granted. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, E, H, I**: These are all explicitly granted powers in the Constitution (e.g., regulation of interstate commerce, borrowing money, declaring war, regulating immigration, approving nominations).  
- **B, C**: These are also explicit powers (creating federal laws and impeaching the President).  
- **F**: The power to impose an income tax is now explicitly granted by the 16th Amendment, so it is not an implied power.  
- **G**: Oversight of executive branch agencies is not explicitly stated in the Constitution but is an implied power. Congress conducts oversight to ensure accountability and proper execution of laws, which is necessary for its legislative and appropriations functions.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: oversight of executive branch agencies**.

Answer: G
