Okay, so I've got this question about work design theories, and I'm trying to figure out which one it's pointing to. The question is asking about which theoretical perspective focuses on enhancing job satisfaction and productivity. The options are A through J, each representing a different theory or model.

Let me start by recalling what I know about these theories. I remember that in organizational behavior, there are several theories related to work design, each with different focuses.

Option A is Human Relations theory. I think that's more about how employees are treated and their social needs. It came after Scientific Management, emphasizing that workers are not just cogs but have social and emotional needs. So it's about improving conditions to make workers happier, which can increase productivity. But does it specifically focus on job satisfaction and productivity as key characteristics? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.

Option B is Process improvement. That sounds more like methods to make processes more efficient, like Six Sigma or Lean. It's about reducing waste and improving workflows, not directly about job satisfaction.

Option C is Job enrichment theory. Job enrichment is about adding more challenging tasks or responsibilities to a job to make it more rewarding. This definitely aims to increase job satisfaction because it makes the work more meaningful. It also likely boosts productivity because motivated employees work better.

Option D is Job enlargement theory. Job enlargement is about increasing the number of tasks an employee does, but not necessarily making them more challenging. It's more about expanding the job scope, which might reduce monotony but I'm not sure if it's specifically targeting job satisfaction and productivity as much as enrichment does.

Option E is Time and Motion study. That's part of Scientific Management, focusing on breaking down tasks into smaller parts to optimize efficiency. It's more about productivity through efficiency rather than job satisfaction.

Option F is Techno-structural change model. I'm not too familiar with this one, but it sounds like it's about organizational structure and technology changes. Maybe related to how work is structured but not directly about job satisfaction.

Option G is Scientific management theory. As I thought earlier, this is about breaking tasks into parts, standardizing, and focusing on efficiency. It doesn't really consider the worker's job satisfaction; in fact, it's often criticized for being too rigid and leading to dissatisfaction.

Option H is Socio-technical systems. This approach considers both the technical aspects of work and the social systems. It aims for the joint optimization of both, which can lead to better job satisfaction and productivity. But is this the primary focus here?

Option I is Motivational theory. That's a broad term encompassing theories like Maslow's hierarchy or Herzberg's two-factor theory. These do focus on motivation, which ties into job satisfaction. But the question is about work design, which is more specific than general motivation theories.

Option J is Job characteristics model. I think this model identifies core job characteristics like autonomy, variety, and feedback that lead to higher satisfaction and motivation. So this model is all about designing jobs to enhance both satisfaction and productivity.

Wait, so the question is about which perspective's key characteristics are enhancing job satisfaction and productivity. So I'm trying to decide between Job enrichment, Job characteristics model, and maybe Socio-technical systems.

Job enrichment is a technique to add more meaningful tasks, so it's a method under a broader theory. The Job characteristics model is a theory that outlines specific characteristics that make jobs more satisfying. So the question is about the theoretical perspective, not the technique. So J might be the answer.

But wait, option C is Job enrichment theory. So maybe that's a theory that focuses on enhancing satisfaction and productivity. Alternatively, the Job characteristics model is more about the structure of the job itself.

Hmm. Let me think again. The Job Characteristics Model (JCM) by Hackman and Oldham suggests that certain core job dimensions (variety, identity, significance, autonomy, feedback) influence psychological states which then affect satisfaction and productivity. So JCM is definitely about designing jobs to enhance both outcomes.

Job enrichment theory, on the other hand, is a specific approach where employees are given more challenging tasks, perhaps falling under the broader umbrella of JCM. So the question is which theoretical perspective has these as key characteristics.

So the correct answer would be J: Job characteristics model.
</think>

The question asks which theoretical perspective of work design focuses on enhancing job satisfaction and productivity. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **A: Human Relations theory** focuses on social needs and employee well-being but is not specifically about job satisfaction and productivity as key characteristics.
- **B: Process improvement** aims at efficiency and reducing waste, not directly related to job satisfaction.
- **C: Job enrichment theory** involves adding challenging tasks to make jobs more rewarding, which can enhance satisfaction and productivity.
- **D: Job enlargement theory** expands job scope but does not necessarily target satisfaction or productivity.
- **E: Time and Motion study** focuses on efficiency and task optimization, not satisfaction.
- **F: Techno-structural change model** deals with organizational structure and technology, not directly related to job satisfaction.
- **G: Scientific management theory** emphasizes efficiency through task standardization but neglects job satisfaction.
- **H: Socio-technical systems** considers both technical and social aspects of work but is broader than the specific focus on satisfaction and productivity.
- **I: Motivational theory** is broad and focuses on motivation but is not specific to work design.
- **J: Job characteristics model** identifies core job characteristics (autonomy, variety, feedback) that enhance satisfaction and productivity, making it the most fitting answer.

While **C: Job enrichment theory** is a specific technique aimed at enhancing satisfaction, **J: Job characteristics model** is the broader theoretical perspective that directly addresses the key characteristics of job satisfaction and productivity in work design.
