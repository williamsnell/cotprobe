Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A woman owned land in fee simple absolute. The woman conveyed the land to a friend "for life," and when the friend died the land was to go to the woman's neighbor "and her heirs." The neighbor died and in her duly probated will devised her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?

Options:

A: The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.
B: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.
C: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable and her will transferred her entire estate.
D: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because the quitclaim deed from the daughter transferred any interest she might have had in the land.
E: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a contingent remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
F: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
G: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor.
H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.
I: The friend has a life estate and the local charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will transferred her entire estate.
J: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will devised her entire estate to a local charity.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here about future interests and the Rule Against Perpetuities. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step.

The scenario is: A woman owned land in fee simple absolute. She conveyed it to a friend "for life," and when the friend dies, it goes to the woman's neighbor "and her heirs." Then the neighbor died, and in her will, she left her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. A year after the neighbor died, the daughter executed a quitclaim deed to the woman's friend, transferring any interest she might have.

The question is about who has what interest in the land now. The options are A through J, each with different scenarios.

First, I need to figure out the initial conveyance. The woman conveyed to her friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. So that's a life estate to the friend, with a remainder to the neighbor in fee simple absolute because "and her heirs" typically indicates a fee simple.

Wait, but the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP) comes into play. The RAP says that any contingent future interest must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after the death of a life in being at the time the interest was created. So, in the original conveyance, the friend has a life estate, then the neighbor has a vested remainder because it's a fee simple to her. So the neighbor's interest is a vested remainder because it's a fee, not contingent. So RAP wouldn't apply here because the remainder is vested, not contingent.

Wait, no. Wait, the conveyance is to the friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. So that's a life estate, followed by a vested remainder in fee simple to the neighbor. So RAP doesn't affect this because the remainder is vested, not contingent.

But wait, what if the neighbor dies before the friend? Then the neighbor's interest would pass to her heirs. But in this case, the neighbor died after the conveyance, and the friend is still alive. So the neighbor's vested remainder is valid.

Wait, but the neighbor died, and in her will, she left her entire estate to a charity. So when she died, her vested remainder would have passed according to her will. So the charity now holds the vested remainder in fee simple.

But then the daughter, a year after the neighbor's death, executed a quitclaim deed to the friend. So the daughter is the neighbor's heir, right? Because if the neighbor had died intestate, the daughter would have been her only heir. But the neighbor died testate, leaving everything to charity. So the daughter didn't inherit anything from the neighbor.

So the daughter's interest, if any, would have been a contingent remainder only if the neighbor's interest was a life estate. But no, the neighbor had a vested remainder in fee simple. So the daughter wouldn't have any interest because the neighbor's will gave everything to the charity.

Wait, but let me think again. The original conveyance was to the friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. So when the friend dies, it goes to the neighbor, but if the neighbor dies before the friend, then it would go to the neighbor's heirs. Oh wait, no. Because the neighbor's interest is a vested remainder. So upon the neighbor's death, her vested remainder would pass to her estate, which she willed to the charity. So the charity now has the vested remainder.

But the daughter is trying to convey any interest she might have. Since the neighbor's will left everything to the charity, the daughter didn't inherit any interest in the land. So the daughter's quitclaim deed to the friend wouldn't convey anything because she didn't have any interest to convey.

Therefore, the current interests are: the friend has a life estate, and the charity has a vested remainder in fee simple. So looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this.

Option H says: friend has life estate, charity has vested remainder. Option C says friend has life estate, charity has contingent remainder. Wait, why would it be contingent? Because the vested remainder is in the charity, so it's vested, not contingent.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option H: friend has life estate and charity has vested remainder because neighbor's interest was devisable.

Yes, that makes sense. So the friend's life estate, and upon his death, the charity gets it in fee simple.

So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but looking back, the conveyance was "to the neighbor and her heirs." So that's a fee simple absolute. So the neighbor had a vested remainder in fee. When she died, her vested remainder would pass according to her will, which gave everything to the charity. So the charity now holds the vested remainder.

Therefore, the friend has a life estate, and the charity has a vested remainder. So option H is correct.

The woman conveyed the land to her friend for life, creating a life estate in the friend. The remainder was given to the neighbor "and her heirs," which constitutes a vested remainder in fee simple absolute. The Rule Against Perpetuities does not apply here because the remainder is vested, not contingent.

When the neighbor died, her vested remainder passed according to her will, which devised her entire estate to the local charity. Therefore, the charity now holds the vested remainder in fee simple. The daughter, who would have been the neighbor's heir if the neighbor had died intestate, did not inherit any interest because the neighbor's will left everything to the charity. The daughter's quitclaim deed to the friend a year after the neighbor's death is irrelevant because the daughter had no interest to convey.

Thus, the current interests in the land are as follows: the friend has a life estate, and the charity has a vested remainder in fee simple.

The correct answer is:

H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.

Answer: H
