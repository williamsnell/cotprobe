Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Hicky and a note he received. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on finance calculations, but I'll take it slow.

So, the problem says that on April 17, Mr. Hicky received a three-month note for $800 at 4% interest. Then, on May 17, his bank discounted the note at a 6% interest rate. We need to find his proceeds.

Hmm, I think I remember that when a bank discounts a note, they're essentially buying it from the holder at a discount, which means the holder gets less than the face value immediately. The discount is based on the interest rate. So, the bank is going to take the face value and subtract the interest that would have accrued from the discount date until the maturity date.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the details right. The note is for three months at 4% interest. So, the maturity is three months from April 17. That would be July 17, right? Because April 17 plus three months is July 17.

But the bank is discounting it on May 17. So, the time between May 17 and July 17 is... let's see. May has 31 days, so from May 17 to May 31 is 14 days. Then, June has 30 days, and July up to the 17th is 17 days. So, 14 + 30 + 17 = 61 days? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, because the period from May 17 to July 17 is actually 61 days? Or is that 60 days?

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate it as months. From May 17 to July 17 is two months and 0 days? No, wait, May 17 to June 17 is one month, and then another month to July 17, so that's two months. But that's 61 days (since May has 31 days, so May 17 to May 31 is 15 days? Wait, no: May 17 to May 31 is 14 days because May 17 is day 1, so 31-17=14 days. Then June has 30 days, and then up to July 17 is 17 days. So 14 + 30 +17 = 61 days. Hmm, but sometimes in finance, they might use a 360-day year for calculations, so maybe it's better to convert the days into years as a fraction.

Wait, but in the problem, the note is for three months, which is 90 days. So, the face value is $800, and the interest is 4% per annum, but for 90 days.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The note has a face value of $800, and it's a three-month note bearing interest at 4%. So, the interest due at maturity would be (800 * 4%) for three months. But to calculate that, I need to figure out what 4% per annum is for 90 days.

Wait, 4% annually is 0.04. For three months, that's a quarter of a year, so 0.04 / 4 = 0.01, so 1%. So the interest at maturity would be 800 * 0.01 = $8. So, the total amount due at maturity is 800 + 8 = $808. But that's at the end of three months, i.e., July 17.

But the bank is discounting the note on May 17, which is before maturity. So, the bank is going to pay Mr. Hicky the present value of the note as of May 17, using a discount rate of 6% per annum.

Wait, okay, so the note's maturity value is $808 on July 17. The bank is going to discount this amount back to May 17 at 6% annual interest. So, we can calculate the present value of $808 as of May 17 using the discount rate.

So, the number of days between May 17 and July 17 is... let's see: May has 31 days, so from May 17 to May 31 is 15 days (including the 17th? Wait, no: if it's from May 17 to May 31, that's 15 days because 31-17+1=15. Then June has 30 days, and then from July 1 to July 17 is 17 days. So total is 15 + 30 +17 = 62 days. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 61, but maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, if I count from May 17 to May 31: 31 -17 =14 days, but since May 17 is day 1, it's 15 days. Because 17th is day 1, 18th day 2, ..., 31st day 15. So yes, 15 days in May. Then June is 30 days, and July 1-17 is 17 days. So 15+30+17=62 days. So 62 days until maturity.

Now, to find the discount, I can use the formula for present value: PV = FV / (1 + r*t), where r is the discount rate and t is the time in years.

But wait, the discounting formula for bank discount is a bit different, I think. Because in some cases, especially with simple interest, the discount is calculated as the interest on the face value. Oh wait, in the context of discounting a note, the present value is calculated as the face value minus the discount, where discount is the interest from the discount date to maturity at the given rate.

Alternatively, the present value can be calculated as FV / (1 + (r * t)), where t is in years.

So, the face value here is $808, right? Because that's the amount that would be paid at maturity on July 17. So, the present value on May 17 would be 808 divided by (1 + (0.06 * t)), where t is 62 days in years.

Wait, but how do we convert 62 days into years? If we're using a 360-day year, which is common in some financial calculations, then t = 62/360. Alternatively, using a 365-day year, t = 62/365. I think for bank discounting, 360 days is often used, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's better to check which one makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the exact time period in months, but that might not be the case. Let me proceed with 360 days first.

So, t = 62/360 ≈ 0.172222 years.

So, the present value would be 808 / (1 + 0.06 * 0.172222).

Calculating the denominator: 0.06 * 0.172222 ≈ 0.0103333. So 1 + 0.0103333 ≈ 1.0103333.

So, PV ≈ 808 / 1.0103333 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 808 by 1.0103333: Let me do this step by step.

1.0103333 * 800 = 808.266664. Hmm, that's actually more than 808. So perhaps I should compute it as 808 / 1.0103333.

Wait, alternatively, I can estimate it. Let me see:

1.0103333 * 798 = ?

Let me compute 798 * 1.0103333.

798 * 1 = 798

798 * 0.0103333 ≈ 798 * 0.01 = 7.98, plus 798 * 0.0003333 ≈ 0.266. So total ≈7.98 + 0.266 ≈8.246.

So 798 * 1.0103333 ≈ 798 + 8.246 ≈ 806.246.

Wait, but our FV is 808, so perhaps 798 is a bit low.

Let me try 798.5:

798.5 * 1.0103333 = 798.5 + (798.5 * 0.0103333)

798.5 * 0.0103333 ≈ 8.25 (approx). So total ≈ 798.5 + 8.25 ≈ 806.75. Still lower than 808.

Hmm, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use the formula:

PV = FV / (1 + (rate * time)).

So, PV = 808 / (1 + (0.06 * (62/360))) ).

Compute denominator: 0.06*(62/360) = 0.06 * (0.172222) ≈ 0.0103333.

So denominator is 1.0103333.

So, 808 / 1.0103333 ≈ let me compute this division.

Let me do it step by step.

1.0103333 × 800 = 808.26666, which is more than 808.

So, 800 × 1.0103333 = 808.2666. But we need 808, which is less than 808.2666.

So, 800 would give a PV of 808.2666, which is higher than our FV of 808, so that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: PV is the present value, which is less than FV. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Because when you discount, PV is lower than FV. So, if FV is 808, then PV should be less than 808.

Wait, but I'm getting 808 / 1.0103333, which is approximately 800. Let me compute it accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

Compute 808 / 1.0103333.

Let me write this as 808 ÷ 1.0103333.

Let me approximate:

1.0103333 × 800 = 808.266664.

So, 800 gives 808.266664, which is higher than 808. So, 800 is higher than needed.

So, 808 ÷ 1.0103333 is a bit less than 800.

Let me compute 799 × 1.0103333.

799 × 1 = 799.

799 × 0.0103333 ≈ 8.25.

So, total ≈ 799 +8.25=807.25.

That's less than 808. So, the PV is between 799 and 800.

Wait, 799.5 × 1.0103333.

799.5 × 1.0103333: 799.5 + (799.5 ×0.0103333).

799.5 ×0.0103333 ≈ approx 8.25 (since 800 ×0.01 is 8, so 799.5 is about 8.0).

So, 799.5 +8.0=807.5. Still less than 808.

So, perhaps 799.8:

799.8 ×1.0103333=799.8 + (799.8 ×0.0103333).

799.8 ×0.0103333≈8.25 (approx).

So, 799.8 +8.25≈808.05, which is very close to 808.

So, 799.8 would give about 808.05, which is just a bit over 808. So, perhaps the PV is approximately 799.8, which would be $799.80. Looking at the options, D is $799.92, which is very close.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, let me compute 808 / 1.0103333.

Using the formula for division:

Let me write this as 808 ÷ 1.0103333.

I can compute this by moving decimals:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10,000,000 to make it easier, but that's tedious.

Alternatively, use the approximation method:

We can write it as:

1.0103333 = 1 + 0.0103333.

So, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x +x² -x³ +..., where x is small.

Here, x=0.0103333.

So, 1/1.0103333 ≈ 1 - 0.0103333 + (0.0103333)^2 - ... 

So, approximately:

1 - 0.0103333 = 0.9896667.

(0.0103333)^2 ≈ 0.0001067.

So, 0.9896667 + 0.0001067 ≈ 0.9897734.

So, 1/1.0103333 ≈ 0.9897734.

So, 808 × 0.9897734 ≈ ?

Compute 800 ×0.9897734= 791.81872.

8 ×0.9897734=7.918185.

So total ≈791.81872 +7.918185≈799.7369.

So, approximately $799.74.

Looking at the options, D is $799.92, which is close. But perhaps my approximation is a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the discount differently. Because in some cases, the discount is calculated as (face value * rate * time), and then proceeds = face value - discount.

Wait, the note's face value is $800, but its maturity value is $808, as we calculated earlier. So, when discounting, the bank is looking at the $808 and discounting it back 62 days at 6% to find the present value.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the interest on $808 for 62 days at 6%, which would be the discount, and subtract that from $808 to get the proceeds.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the discount is $808 * 0.06 * (62/360).

Compute that: 808 * 0.06 = 48.48.

48.48 * (62/360) = Let's compute 62/360 first. 62 ÷ 360 ≈ 0.172222.

So, 48.48 * 0.172222 ≈ let me compute:

48 * 0.172222 ≈ 8.266664.

0.48 * 0.172222 ≈ 0.0826666.

So total ≈8.266664 +0.0826666≈8.34933.

So, the discount is approximately $8.35. So, the proceeds would be $808 - $8.35 = $799.65.

Looking at the options, D is $799.92, which is close but not exact. Hmmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the days earlier. Let me recount the days between May 17 and July 17.

From May 17 to May 31: 31 -17 =14 days, but including the 17th, so 15 days.

June: 30 days.

July 1 to July 17:17 days.

So, 15 +30 +17 =62 days. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the interest calculation uses 360 days, so 62/360 is correct.

Wait, but let me compute 808 * 0.06 * (62/360) more accurately.

Compute 62/360 = 0.17222222...

0.06 * 0.17222222 = 0.010333333.

808 * 0.010333333 = let's compute 800 * 0.010333333 =8.26666664.

8 * 0.010333333=0.082666664.

So, total is 8.26666664 +0.082666664=8.3493333.

So, the discount is $8.3493333.

So, proceeds = 808 -8.3493333 = 799.6506667.

So, approximately $799.65, which is not exactly one of the options. The closest option is D: $799.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the interest. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated using 365 days instead of 360.

Let me try that. So, t =62/365 ≈0.16986 years.

So, discount =808 *0.06*0.16986.

Compute 0.06 * 0.16986 ≈0.0101916.

808 *0.0101916 ≈ let's compute:

800 *0.0101916 =8.15328.

8 *0.0101916=0.0815328.

So total ≈8.15328 +0.0815328=8.2348128.

So, discount is $8.2348128.

Proceeds: 808 -8.2348128≈799.7651872.

So, approximately $799.77, which is closer to option D ($799.92) but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the simple interest formula without considering the 360 or 365 days, but just the exact days in the period.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the 3 months as exactly 90 days, so the time from May 17 to July 17 is 60 days, which is 60/360=1/6 of a year.

Wait, wait, wait. If the note is dated April 17, and it's a 3-month note, that would make it due on July 17. But if the bank is discounting it on May 17, that's exactly 1 month later, so 1/3 of the note's term has passed, leaving 2/3 of the term remaining. So, the time remaining is 2 months, which is 60 days.

Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again.

The note is from April 17 to July 17: 3 months, 90 days.

On May 17, which is 30 days later (assuming April has 30 days?), no, wait, April has 30 days, so from April 17 to May 17 is 30 days. So, the remaining time is 60 days until July 17.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed 62 days. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the simplified approach where the time is 60 days remaining. Let me try that.

So, t=60 days.

Using 360-day year: 60/360=1/6≈0.1666667.

So, discount is 808 * 0.06 * (60/360) =808 *0.06*(1/6) =808 *0.01=8.08.

So, discount is $8.08, proceeds=808-8.08=799.92. Which matches option D.

Ah
