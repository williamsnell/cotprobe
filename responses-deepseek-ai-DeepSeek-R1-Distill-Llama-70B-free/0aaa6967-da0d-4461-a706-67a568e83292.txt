Question:

A contractor has found through experience that the low bid for a job (excluding his own bid) is a random variable that is uniformly dis-tributed, over the interval ( 3c / 4 , 2c) where c is the contractor's cost estimate (no profit or loss) of the job. If profit is defined as zero if the contractor does not get the job (his bid is greater than the low bid) and as the difference between his bid and the cost estimate c if he gets the job, what should he bid, in terms of c, in order to maximize his expected profit?

Options:

A: k = (7c / 4)
B: k = (3c / 2)
C: k = (3c / 4)
D: k = (c / 3)
E: k = (4c / 3)
F: k = c
G: k = (2c / 3)
H: k = (5c / 4)
I: k = (5c / 3)
J: k = (c / 2)

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a contractor trying to figure out the best bid to maximize his expected profit. I'm a bit rusty on probability and optimization, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, let's see. The problem says that the low bid (excluding the contractor's own bid) is a random variable uniformly distributed between 3c/4 and 2c. Here, c is the contractor's cost estimate, so if he gets the job, his profit is his bid minus c. If he doesn't get the job (because someone else bid lower), his profit is zero.

The goal is to find the bid (let's call it k) that maximizes the expected profit. So I need to model the expected profit as a function of k and then find its maximum.

First, let me understand the distribution. The low bid, let's call it X, is uniform between 3c/4 and 2c. So the probability density function (pdf) of X is flat between these two points. The pdf f(x) would be 1/(2c - 3c/4) for x in that interval. Let me calculate that denominator: 2c is 8c/4, so 8c/4 - 3c/4 is 5c/4. So f(x) is 4/(5c) for 3c/4 < x < 2c.

Now, the contractor's bid is k. He gets the job if k is less than or equal to the low bid X. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, the low bid is X, which is what the others are bidding. So if the contractor's bid is lower than X, he would get the job. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the way it's phrased: the low bid is a random variable, which is the lowest bid among others. So if the contractor's bid is lower than X, then he's the lowest bidder and gets the job. If his bid is higher than X, someone else gets it, and he gets zero profit.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The low bid is X, which is the lowest of the other bids. So if the contractor's bid is lower than X, then his is lower than the others, so he gets the job. But if the contractor's bid is higher than X, someone else is lower, so he doesn't get it.

So the probability that he gets the job is the probability that his bid k is less than X. Because X is uniformly distributed, the probability that X is greater than k is equal to the length of the interval from k to 2c, divided by the total length of the distribution (which is 5c/4).

Wait, but that's only if k is within the range of X's distribution. Because X is between 3c/4 and 2c. So if the contractor's bid k is less than or equal to 3c/4, then he'll always get the job because X can't be lower than 3c/4. Conversely, if k is higher than 2c, he never gets the job. But for 3c/4 < k < 2c, the probability that X > k is (2c - k)/(5c/4) because the total interval length is 5c/4.

Wait, no, the uniform distribution's probability that X > k is (upper - k)/(upper - lower). So for a given k, the probability P(X > k) is (2c - k)/(2c - 3c/4) ) when k is between 3c/4 and 2c. Let me compute 2c - 3c/4, which is 5c/4. So P = (2c - k) / (5c/4) = (4(2c -k))/(5c).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the pdf is 4/(5c) in that interval. So the probability that X > k is the integral from k to 2c of f(x) dx. So that's (2c - k) * (4/(5c)).

Wait, no. The CDF for a uniform distribution from a to b is (x - a)/(b - a). So the probability that X <= k is (k - a)/(b -a), so the probability that X >k is 1 - (k -a)/(b -a) when k is between a and b. But when k is below a, P(X >k) is 1, and when k is above b, it's 0.

In our case, a is 3c/4, b is 2c. So for k <= 3c/4, P(X>k) = 1. For k >= 2c, P(X>k) = 0. And for 3c/4 <k <2c, P(X>k) = (2c -k)/(2c -3c/4) )= (2c -k)/(5c/4) )= (4(2c -k))/(5c).

Now, the expected profit is the probability of getting the job times the profit when he gets it. The profit when he gets the job is (k - c). So expected profit E = P(X >k) * (k - c).

So, we have to model E in different ranges of k.

But wait, the contractor's bid can be anything, but we need to find the optimal k that maximizes E.

But considering the distribution of X, the relevant k's that make sense would be between 3c/4 and 2c, because if he bids below 3c/4, he always gets the job, but perhaps that's not optimal. Alternatively, maybe the optimal bid is within the range where X is non-zero.

Wait, but let's think about it. If he bids k < 3c/4, he always gets the job because X is at least 3c/4. So his profit would be (k - c) for sure. But if he sets k very low, say below 3c/4, his profit per job is (k - c), which could be negative if k < c. But wait, c is his cost, so if he bids below c, he would make a loss. So he wouldn't want to do that. So perhaps the optimal bid is above c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the contractor's cost is c, so if he bids k and gets the job, his profit is (k - c). So if he bids below c, he would have negative profit, which is bad. So he would probably not bid below c, unless the probability of getting the job is so high that the expected profit is positive overall.

Wait, but the problem states that profit is zero if he doesn't get the job, and (k - c) if he does. So if he bids k < c, then (k - c) is negative, so his profit would be negative when he gets the job, but zero otherwise. Thus, his expected profit would be negative in that case. So it's better not to bid below c, because then his expected profit would be negative. So the optimal k must be >= c, because otherwise his expected profit could be negative.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Suppose he bids k = c. Then his profit when he gets the job is zero. So his expected profit is zero times the probability, which is zero. But perhaps by bidding higher than c, he can have a positive expected profit.

Wait, but if k is higher than c, then when he gets the job, he makes a positive profit. But the probability of getting the job decreases as k increases because P(X >k) decreases.

So, the expected profit E is P(X>k) * (k -c). We need to maximize E with respect to k.

Now, let's consider two cases: when k is less than 3c/4, and when k is between 3c/4 and 2c.

Case 1: k <= 3c/4.

In this case, P(X>k) = 1, because X is always >= 3c/4. So E = 1 * (k - c) = k - c.

But if k is less than c, then E is negative. So the maximum E in this region would be at k =3c/4, giving E= (3c/4 -c) = -c/4, which is worse than zero. So it's better to have k >=c than to be in this region, because in the other region, you can have positive E.

Case 2: 3c/4 <k <2c.

Here, P(X>k) = (2c -k)/(5c/4) = (4(2c -k))/(5c) = (8c -4k)/(5c).

So E = (8c -4k)/(5c) * (k -c).

Let me compute E:

E = [(8c -4k)(k -c)] / (5c).

Simplify numerator:

(8c -4k)(k -c) = 8c(k) -8c^2 -4k^2 +4k c.

= (8ck +4ck) -8c² -4k².

= 12ck -8c² -4k².

So E = (12ck -8c² -4k²) / (5c).

We can factor out a 4 in numerator:

= 4*(3ck -2c² -k²)/(5c)

= (12ck -8c² -4k²)/(5c).

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write E as:

E = [(8c -4k)(k -c)]/(5c) = [ (8c)(k) -8c² -4k² +4kc ] /5c.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in expanding. Let me do it again:

(8c -4k)(k -c) = 8c*(k) +8c*(-c) -4k*(k) +4k*c.

=8ck -8c² -4k² +4ck.

So 8ck +4ck =12ck.

So the product is 12ck -8c² -4k².

So E = (12ck -8c² -4k²)/(5c) = [ -4k² +12ck -8c² ]/(5c).

We can write this as:

E(k) = (-4k² +12c k -8c²)/(5c).

To find the maximum, we can take the derivative of E with respect to k and set it to zero.

Alternatively, since E is a quadratic function in terms of k, it's a downward-opening parabola (because the coefficient of k^2 is negative), so the maximum occurs at the vertex.

The vertex of a quadratic ax² +bx +c is at x=-b/(2a).

But let's write E in terms of k:

E(k) = (-4k² +12c k -8c²)/(5c).

We can factor out 1/(5c):

E(k) = [ -4k² +12c k -8c² ]/(5c).

Let me write the numerator as a quadratic in k:

Numerator = -4k² +12c k -8c².

So a = -4, b=12c, c=-8c².

Wait, no, in standard form, it's f(k) = a k² + b k + c.

So a = -4, b=12c, c=-8c².

The vertex is at k = -b/(2a) = -(12c)/(2*(-4)) )= (12c)/(8) )= (3c/2).

Wait, that can't be right because the maximum k in this case is 2c, and 3c/2 is 1.5c, which is within the interval (3c/4=0.75c, 2c).

Wait, so the maximum occurs at k= 3c/2. But wait, this is within the interval 3c/4 <k <2c. So, we can compute E at this point.

But wait, let me make sure I did the vertex correctly.

Yes, because the quadratic is -4k² +12c k -8c², so a=-4, b=12c.

So k = -b/(2a) = -12c/(2*(-4)) )= (-12c)/(-8) )= 12c/8 = 3c/2.

So the maximum expected profit occurs at k= 3c/2.

Wait, but I should check if this is indeed a maximum. Since a is negative, the parabola opens downward, so this is a maximum point.

But wait, let me confirm by taking the derivative.

E(k) = [ -4k² +12c k -8c² ]/(5c).

dE/dk = [ (-8k +12c) ]/(5c).

Set derivative to zero:

(-8k +12c)/(5c)=0 → -8k +12c=0 → 8k=12c → k=12c/8= 3c/2.

Yes, same result.

So the optimal bid is k=3c/2, which is option B.

Wait but let me check the endpoints to make sure.

At k=3c/4, E would be:

E = [(8c -4*(3c/4))( (3c/4) -c ) ]/(5c).

Compute numerator:

8c - 3c =5c.

(3c/4 -c )= -c/4.

So E= (5c * (-c/4 )) /5c = (-5c²/4)/5c = (-c/4).

At k=2c, E would be zero because P(X>2c)=0.

At k=3c/2, which is 1.5c, let's compute E.

E = [ (8c -4*(3c/2)) * (3c/2 -c) ] /5c.

Wait, let's compute each part.

8c -4*(3c/2) =8c -6c=2c.

3c/2 -c= c/2.

So numerator: (2c)*(c/2)=c².

So E= c²/(5c)=c/5.

So E= c/5 at k=3c/2.

Wait, but when k=3c/2, the expected profit is c/5. Is that the maximum?

Let me check another point, say k= c.

E would be [ (8c -4c) * (c -c) ]/(5c) → (4c *0)/5c=0.

Another point, say k= c.

Wait, but when k is less than 3c/4, E= k -c. So at k=3c/4, E= 3c/4 -c = -c/4. So at k=3c/2, E is positive.

So yes, the maximum seems to be at k=3c/2, which is option B.

The contractor's goal is to determine the optimal bid, \( k \), that maximizes the expected profit. The low bid of competitors, \( X \), is uniformly distributed over the interval \( \left( \frac{3c}{4}, 2c \right) \), where \( c \) is the contractor's cost estimate. The profit is defined as \( k - c \) if the contractor gets the job (i.e., \( k < X \)) and zero otherwise.

### Key Steps:
1. **Probability of Getting the Job**:  
   The probability that the contractor gets the job is \( P(X > k) \). For a uniform distribution, this is given by:  
   \[
   P(X > k) = 
   \begin{cases} 
   1 & \text{if } k \leq \frac{3c}{4}, \\
   \frac{2c - k}{\frac{5c}{4}} = \frac{4(2c - k)}{5c} & \text{if } \frac{3c}{4} < k < 2c, \\
   0 & \text{if } k \geq 2c.
   \end{cases}
   \]

2. **Expected Profit**:  
   The expected profit is the product of the probability of getting the job and the profit when the job is won:  
   \[
   E(k) = P(X > k) \cdot (k - c).
   \]  
   For \( \frac{3c}{4} < k < 2c \), substituting \( P(X > k) \):  
   \[
   E(k) = \frac{4(2c - k)}{5c} \cdot (k - c).
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   E(k) = \frac{-4k^2 + 12ck - 8c^2}{5c}.
   \]

3. **Maximizing Expected Profit**:  
   To find the value of \( k \) that maximizes \( E(k) \), we take the derivative of \( E(k) \) with respect to \( k \) and set it to zero:  
   \[
   \frac{dE}{dk} = \frac{-8k + 12c}{5c}.
   \]  
   Setting \( \frac{dE}{dk} = 0 \):  
   \[
   -8k + 12c = 0 \implies k = \frac{12c}{8} = \frac{3c}{2}.
   \]  
   This is the optimal bid, as it lies within the interval \( \frac{3c}{4} < k < 2c \).

4. **Verification**:  
   At \( k = \frac{3c}{2} \), the expected profit is positive. Checking the endpoints:
   - At \( k = \frac{3c}{4} \), \( E(k) = -\frac{c}{4} \) (negative).
   - At \( k = 2c \), \( E(k) = 0 \).  
   Thus, \( k = \frac{3c}{2} \) is indeed the maximum.

### Conclusion:
The optimal bid to maximize the contractor's expected profit is \( k = \frac{3c}{2} \).
