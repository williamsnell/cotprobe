Okay, so I've got this question about statistics, specifically about how the mean changes when you modify one of the data points. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says: In a group of 10 scores, the largest score is increased by 40 points. What will happen to the mean?

Hmm, I remember that the mean is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many there are. So in this case, there are 10 scores. Let me visualize this. Let's say the original scores are something like, oh, I don't know, maybe [50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 100], just as an example. The largest here is 100.

If I increase the largest score by 40 points, it becomes 140. So what does that do to the total sum? Well, the original sum would be the sum of all those numbers. Let's calculate that quickly. 50+60 is 110, +70 is 180, +80 is 260, +90 is 350, +80 is 430, +70 is 500, +60 is 560, +50 is 610, and +100 is 710. So the original sum is 710.

After increasing the largest score by 40, the new score is 140, so the new sum is 710 - 100 + 140. That equals 710 +40 = 750.

Wait, because I took away the original 100 and added 140, so that's a net gain of 40. So the sum increases by 40.

But wait, the number of data points is still 10. So the original mean was 710 /10 =71. The new mean is 750/10=75. So the mean increased by 4 points.

Wait, 75-71 is 4. So the mean goes up by 4.

Looking at the options, J says it will increase by 4 points. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The total sum increases by 40 because only one score is increased by 40. Since there are 10 scores, each contributing to the mean, the mean increases by 40 divided by 10, which is 4. Yep, that makes sense. So the mean increases by 4 points.

I don't think any other options fit. Let me glance over them again. Option C says increase by 10, which would happen if all 10 scores increased by 10 each, but that's not the case here. Option J is the right one.

The mean is calculated as the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. Initially, there are 10 scores, and the largest score is increased by 40 points. This increases the total sum of the scores by 40 points. Since the number of scores remains the same (10), the mean increases by \( \frac{40}{10} = 4 \) points.

Thus, the mean will increase by 4 points.

Answer: J
