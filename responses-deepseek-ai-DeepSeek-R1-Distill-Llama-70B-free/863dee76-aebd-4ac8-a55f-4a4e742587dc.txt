Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stopping distance. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the distance an automobile can stop given certain conditions. 

The car weighs 3000 pounds and is moving at 30 miles per hour, which converts to 44 feet per second. Oh wait, right, because 30 mph is 44 ft/s. The coefficient of friction is 0.70. I remember that friction plays a big role in stopping distance.

So I think I should use the formula that relates stopping distance to these factors. Oh right, the formula is probably something like distance equals (mass times velocity squared) divided by (friction coefficient times gravitational acceleration). Wait, but wait, I need to be careful with units here since the car's weight is given in pounds and the standard unit is in newtons or something else.

Wait, no, in the imperial system, weight is in pounds, and mass is in slugs. Oh right, mass equals weight divided by gravitational acceleration. Gravitational acceleration is about 32 ft/s². So first, I need to convert the weight of the car into mass.

The car's weight is 3000 lb. So mass m is weight divided by g. So m = 3000 lb / 32 ft/s². Wait, but pounds are units of force, so when we divide by acceleration (ft/s²), we get mass in slugs. Yeah, because in the imperial system, mass is measured in slugs.

So m = 3000 / 32 = let's calculate that. 3000 divided by 32. 32*93 is 2976, so 93.75 slugs? Because 32 * 93 = 2976, 3000-2976=24, 24/32=0.75, so 93.75 slugs.

Next, the formula for stopping distance is d = (v²) / (μg). Wait, that's the formula when force is involved. Because the frictional force is μmg, and from F=ma, the acceleration a is μg. But since it's deceleration, it's negative. So using kinematics, the stopping distance would be v²/(2a), but since a is μg, it's v squared over (2μg). Wait, no, wait. Let me think clearly.

The work-energy principle says that the work done by friction equals the change in kinetic energy. So the frictional force is μmg, and the distance is d, so work done is force times distance: μmg * d. The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: μmg d = 0.5 m v². The mass cancels out, so d = (v²) / (2μg).

Oh wait, so the formula is d = v²/(2μg). Got it.

So plugging in the values: v is 44 ft/s. μ is 0.70. g is 32 ft/s².

So d = (44^2) / (2 * 0.7 * 32 )

Calculate numerator: 44 squared is 1936.

Denominator: 2 * 0.7 is 1.4, multiplied by 32 is 1.4 *32 = 44.8.

So d = 1936 / 44.8.

Let me compute that. 44.8 goes into 1936 how many times?

Well, 44.8 * 43 = let's see. 40 *44.8 is 1792, 3*44.8 is 134.4, so 1792 + 134.4 = 1926.4. That's 43 times.

1936 - 1926.4 is 9.6 left. So 9.6 /44.8 is 0.214... So approximately 43.214 feet.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: 39 ft

B:25

C:43

D:60

E:55

F:75

G:36

H:50

I:47

J:32

So the closest option is C:43. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 44 squared is indeed 1936. 2*0.7*32 = 44.8.

1936 divided by 44.8:

44.8 * 43 = 1926.4, as before. 1936 -1926.4=9.6. 9.6 /44.8= 0.2142857. So total is 43.2142857, which is approximately 43.21 feet. So the closest option is C:43 ft.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: 1936 /44.8.

Let me compute 44.8 * 43 = 1926.4.

1936 - 1926.4 =9.6.

So 9.6 /44.8 = 0.2142857.

So 43.2142857, which is approximately 43.2 feet, so 43 is the answer. So option C.

Wait, but let me think: why isn't the mass considered here? Oh, because when using the work-energy approach, the mass cancels out. So the mass of the car doesn't affect the stopping distance, as long as the coefficient of friction is the same. That makes sense because heavier cars have more kinetic energy but also more friction force. So the stopping distance depends on speed and friction.

So yeah, the answer should be 43 ft, option C.

To determine the stopping distance of a 3000-lb automobile traveling at 30 mi/hr (44 ft/s) with a coefficient of friction of 0.70, we use the work-energy principle. The stopping distance is given by:

\[
d = \frac{v^2}{2\mu g}
\]

Where:
- \(v = 44 \, \text{ft/s}\) (velocity),
- \(\mu = 0.70\) (coefficient of friction),
- \(g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2\) (gravitational acceleration).

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
v^2 = 44^2 = 1936 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
2\mu g = 2(0.70)(32) = 44.8 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

Now, compute the stopping distance:
\[
d = \frac{1936}{44.8} \approx 43.21 \, \text{ft}
\]

The closest option to this value is **43 ft**.
