Question:

A 35-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3-day history of severe right back pain. She has not had any fever, chills, or weight loss. She has no history of major medical illness. Musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. When told that her examination is normal, the patient becomes tearful and demands an MRI of her back because her mother just died from breast cancer metastatic to bone and she fears that she may also have cancer. The patient already contacted her insurance company, who told her that if she has neurologic abnormalities an MRI may be covered by her plan. The patient asks the physician to order the MRI indicating that she has neurologic findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?

Options:

A: Advise the patient to change insurance companies as soon as she is able so that she can receive more comprehensive medical care
B: Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings
C: Immediately inform the patient's insurance company about what the patient has asked the physician to do
D: Order the MRI as the patient requests

Okay, so I've got this medical ethics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down.

The patient is a 35-year-old woman with a 3-day history of severe right back pain. No fever, chills, or weight loss, so infection or something chronic like that seems less likely. Her exams—musculoskeletal and neurological—are normal. But when the doctor tells her everything's normal, she gets tearful and asks for an MRI because her mom died from breast cancer that metastasized to the bone. She's worried she might have cancer too. 

She already called her insurance, and they said an MRI might be covered if there are neurologic abnormalities. Now, she's asking the doctor to order the MRI, even implying that she has neurologic findings when she doesn't.

So the question is, what should the physician do?

The options are A through D. Let me go through each.

Option A: Advise her to change insurance companies. Hmm, that doesn't seem immediately helpful. The issue is about her current situation, not her insurance provider. Plus, changing insurance isn't something a doctor can really advise on the spot. It's more about the MRI request.

Option B: Explain that she doesn't need the MRI and that it's not appropriate to misrepresent findings. That sounds like the doctor is being honest and ethical. The patient's exams are normal, so there's no medical indication for the MRI. Also, the patient is asking to lie about her condition to get the test covered, which is unethical. The doctor shouldn't comply with that.

Option C: Inform the insurance company about her request. I'm not sure about this. The doctor's responsibility is to the patient, not to the insurance. Reporting her might not be necessary unless there's clear fraud, but the primary issue is the patient's request. Plus, this could damage the patient-physician relationship.

Option D: Order the MRI as requested. The patient wants it, but the doctor's exams show no need. Ordering it just because she's upset or wants it might not be medically justified. Plus, it's about the insurance issue—she's asking to misrepresent the findings, which is wrong. So the doctor shouldn't order it based on false pretenses.

So putting it together: The physician should not lie or misrepresent the findings. They should explain the situation honestly to the patient. So option B seems right. The doctor should tell her she doesn't need the MRI and that falsifying information is not appropriate. This respects ethical guidelines and maintains trust.

The physician should address the patient's concerns honestly and ethically. Since the patient's examinations are normal and there's no medical indication for an MRI, the doctor should explain that the test isn't necessary. Additionally, it's inappropriate to misrepresent findings to the insurance company. The most appropriate action is to be truthful with the patient about her condition and the ethical implications of her request.

B: Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings.

Answer: B
