Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about group theory. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J. Let's look at each statement one by one.

Statement 1: If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K|. Hmm, I remember something about the product of two subgroups and their orders. Oh right, there's this formula for the order of the product set HK. I think it's |HK| = (|H| * |K|) divided by the order of their intersection. But wait, is that always true? I think this holds when H and K are subgroups, but only under certain conditions. Oh wait, no, I think it's a general formula. Because the product HK is all the elements hk where h is in H and k is in K, but when you count the distinct elements, you have to account for overlaps which happen when elements are in both H and K. So the size is the product divided by the size of the intersection. So this should be true. Wait, but wait! I remember that this formula applies when HK is a subgroup, but not just any product set. Oh right, because if H and K are subgroups, HK is a subgroup only if HK = KH, right? So if H and K are not normal or something, maybe the product isn't a subgroup. But the statement here is about |HK|, regardless of whether it's a subgroup. Wait, no, no, the formula for |HK| is |H||K| / |H ∩ K| regardless of whether HK is a subgroup. Because every element in HK is uniquely expressed as hk where h is in H and k is in K, but the number of distinct elements is |H||K| divided by the intersection size. So I think Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: A group of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. Let me think. So the order is 2p, and p is an odd prime. I remember that groups of order 2p are either cyclic or dihedral. Because for a group of order 2p, p being prime, the possible groups are the cyclic group Z_{2p} and the dihedral group D_p. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. D_p usually refers to the dihedral group of order 2p, which makes sense because for a regular p-gon, there are p rotations and p reflections, totaling 2p elements. So a group of order 2p is either cyclic (i.e., isomorphic to Z_{2p}) or isomorphic to D_p. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure about Statement 1 again. Does the formula |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| hold for any subgroups H and K? I think it does, because even if HK isn't a subgroup, the size of the set HK is still given by that formula. Because when you form the product HK, each element hk is unique up to the overlap in H and K. So the formula counts how many distinct elements are in HK, which is the product of their sizes divided by the size of their intersection. So yes, Statement 1 is correct.

So both statements are true. Looking at the options, option B is True, True. So the answer should be B.

Statement 1: If \( H \) and \( K \) are subgroups of a group \( G \), then \( |HK| = \frac{|H||K|}{|H \cap K|} \). This is a well-known result in group theory. The formula calculates the number of distinct elements in the product set \( HK \), accounting for overlaps in \( H \) and \( K \). The formula holds regardless of whether \( HK \) is a subgroup, as it purely concerns the cardinality of the set \( HK \). Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: A group of order \( 2p \), where \( p \) is an odd prime, is cyclic or isomorphic to \( D_p \). For a group of order \( 2p \), the possible groups are the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_{2p} \) and the dihedral group \( D_p \), which represents the symmetries of a regular \( p \)-gon. These are the only two groups of order \( 2p \) up to isomorphism. Hence, Statement 2 is also true.

Since both statements are true, the correct option is:

**Answer: B**
