Okay, so I've got this problem here about a dress that's being sold for $50, and it says there's a 40% markup based on the selling price. The question is asking for the markup in dollars. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Alright, let's break it down.

First, I remember that markup can be calculated in a couple of ways. One way is based on the cost price, and another is based on the selling price. Since the problem states it's a 40% markup based on the selling price, I think that means the markup is 40% of the selling price. Wait, no, wait a second. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, markup is usually the amount added to the cost price to get to the selling price. So the formula for markup is usually selling price minus cost price. But the percentage can be based on either the cost or the selling price. Oh, right, the problem says it's based on the selling price, so the markup percentage is calculated as a percentage of the selling price, not the cost.

So, the formula for markup percentage based on selling price is: (Markup / Selling Price) * 100 = Markup Percentage. So in this case, the markup percentage is 40%, and the selling price is $50. So I can set up the equation.

Let me write that out. Markup is what we're looking for. Let me call it M. So M divided by the selling price ($50) equals 40% (or 0.4). So M / 50 = 0.4. To find M, I multiply both sides by 50, so M = 0.4 * 50.

Calculating that, 0.4 times 50 is 20. So the markup in dollars is $20. Let me check the options. Option G is $20.00. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another thought: sometimes people get confused between markup and margin. Markup is on cost, whereas margin is on selling price. Oh wait, no, in this case, the problem explicitly says it's a 40% markup based on the selling price. So that aligns with what I did earlier. So yes, the markup is $20.

To determine the markup in dollars for the dress, we start by noting that the selling price is $50 and the markup percentage is 40% based on the selling price. The formula for markup based on selling price is:

\[
\text{Markup} = \text{Markup Percentage} \times \text{Selling Price}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Markup} = 0.4 \times 50 = 20
\]

Thus, the markup in dollars is $20. Among the provided options, the correct answer is:

G: $20.00

Answer: G
