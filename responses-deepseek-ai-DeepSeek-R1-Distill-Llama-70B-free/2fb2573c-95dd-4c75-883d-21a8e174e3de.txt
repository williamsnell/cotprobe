Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a record player's turntable. Hmm, I remember that turntables spin at certain speeds, like 33 or 45 rpm. The question says it's accelerated from rest to 33.3 rpm in 2 seconds, and I need to find the angular acceleration. Right, angular acceleration is the change in angular velocity over time.

Wait, let's think about the units. Angular velocity is typically measured in radians per second, right? So rpm is revolutions per minute, but I need to convert that to radians per second. Oh yeah, because 1 revolution is 2π radians.

So first, let's convert 33.3 rpm to radians per second. How do I do that? Well, 33.3 revolutions per minute. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I can find how many revolutions per second that is. Oh wait, 33.3 rpm is actually a common speed, I think it's close to 0.555 revolutions per second because 33.3 divided by 60 is approximately 0.555.

Then, to get radians per second, I multiply by 2π. So 0.555 rev/s * 2π rad/rev. Let me calculate that. 0.555 times 6.283 (since 2π is about 6.283). Let's see, 0.555 * 6 is 3.333, and 0.555 * 0.283 is about 0.157. So adding them together, that's around 3.49 rad/s. Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let's do 33.3 * 2π radians per minute. Then divide by 60 to get per second.

So 33.3 * 2π = 66.6π radians per minute. Divided by 60, that's 66.6π /60. Let me compute that. 66.6 divided by 60 is 1.11, so 1.11 * π. Since π is about 3.1416, 1.11 * 3.1416 is approximately 3.48 rad/s. So the final angular velocity is about 3.48 rad/s.

Wait, but the turntable starts from rest, so the initial angular velocity is zero. So the change in angular velocity is just 3.48 rad/s. The time taken is 2 seconds. Angular acceleration alpha is delta omega over delta time, so alpha = (3.48 - 0)/2 = 1.74 rad/s².

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 1.74, which would be the answer. But wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me check again.

33.3 rpm to rad/s: 33.3 rev/min = 33.3 * (2π rad) / 60 s. So 33.3 * π / 30. 33.3 divided by 30 is 1.11, so 1.11π. 1.11 * 3.1416 is approximately 3.48 rad/s. Yes, that's correct.

Then, angular acceleration is 3.48 / 2 = 1.74 rad/s². So the correct option should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach: sometimes in these problems, people might mix up radians and revolutions. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the unit conversion.

Another way: 33.3 rpm is 33.3/60 = 0.555 rev per second. Each revolution is 2π radians, so 0.555 * 2π = 3.48 rad/s. Yes, same as before. So yes, angular acceleration is 3.48/2=1.74, option A.

To determine the angular acceleration of the record player's turntable, we start by converting the final angular velocity from revolutions per minute (rpm) to radians per second (rad/s). The turntable accelerates from rest to 33.3 rpm in 2 seconds. 

1. **Convert 33.3 rpm to rad/s**:  
   - 1 revolution = \( 2\pi \) radians, and 1 minute = 60 seconds.  
   - \( 33.3 \, \text{rpm} = \frac{33.3}{60} \, \text{rev/s} = 0.555 \, \text{rev/s} \).  
   - Multiply by \( 2\pi \) to convert to rad/s:  
     \[
     0.555 \, \text{rev/s} \times 2\pi \, \text{rad/rev} = 3.48 \, \text{rad/s}.
     \]  

2. **Calculate angular acceleration**:  
   - Angular acceleration (\( \alpha \)) is given by:  
     \[
     \alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t},
     \]  
     where \( \Delta \omega = \omega_f - \omega_i \). Since the turntable starts from rest, \( \omega_i = 0 \).  
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     \alpha = \frac{3.48 \, \text{rad/s} - 0}{2 \, \text{s}} = 1.74 \, \text{rad/s}^2.
     \]  

3. **Match with the options**:  
   - The calculated angular acceleration is \( 1.74 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Thus, the angular acceleration of the turntable is **1.74 rad/s²**.
