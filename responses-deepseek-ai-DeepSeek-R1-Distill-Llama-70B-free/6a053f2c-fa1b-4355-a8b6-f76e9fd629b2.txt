Question:

A landlord rented an apartment to a tenant for $250 per month in accordance with a month-to-month agreement. On September 3, the landlord mailed the following letter to the tenant:"September 2 In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby give you an option for 20 days from the above date to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month, provided you pay two months' rent in advance. "The tenant received the letter on September 4, but did not read it until September 5. On September 23, the tenant telephoned the landlord and said, "I want to give you the $450 and sign the two-year lease as soon as possible. " The landlord replied, "I've change my mind. I do not want to sign a lease with you. Moreover, I want you to vacate the apartment immediately. " At no time after receiving the landlord's letter on September 4 did the tenant pay him the one-dollar consideration. Did the landlord's letter constitute an effective offer for a two-year lease?

Options:

A: No, because the landlord can retract the offer at any time before the tenant accepts.
B: No, unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration.
C: Yes, because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain that could be concluded by the tenant's assent.
D: No, because the tenant did not immediately respond to the letter.
E: Yes, because the landlord cannot change their mind once an offer is made.
F: Yes, because consideration for the option can be infeffed from the previous month-to-month lease.
G: No, because the tenant did not pay the two months' rent in advance.
H: Yes, because the tenant expressed the intent to sign the lease within the specified timeframe.
I: No, because it contained a condition precedent to execution of the proposed lease.
J: Yes, because the tenant has the right to accept the offer within the 20 days, regardless of the landlord's change of mind.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with offers and options. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a landlord and a tenant. They have a month-to-month agreement where the tenant pays $250 per month. The landlord sends a letter on September 3rd, which the tenant receives on September 4th but doesn't read until September 5th. The letter says that for $1 (which the tenant acknowledges receiving), the tenant has a 20-day option to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month, but the tenant has to pay two months' rent in advance. 

On September 23rd, the tenant calls the landlord wanting to pay $450 (which is two months' rent) and sign the lease. But the landlord refuses, saying he's changed his mind and wants the tenant to leave. The question is whether the landlord's letter was an effective offer for the two-year lease.

I remember that for a contract, you need an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, an option is a promise to keep an offer open for a certain period, usually supported by consideration.

In this case, the landlord's letter is offering a two-year lease under certain conditions. The letter mentions consideration of one dollar, but the tenant never paid it. So, is the offer still valid without the tenant paying that dollar?

Wait, but the option is given in exchange for consideration. Normally, without consideration, an offer can be revoked any time, but with an option (which is supported by consideration), the offeror can't revoke during the option period. Here, the consideration is the one dollar. But the tenant didn't pay it. So does that matter?

So if the landlord's letter is an option, it needs consideration to be binding. Since the tenant didn't pay the dollar, maybe the offer isn't binding, and the landlord can revoke it. But wait, the letter says "in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged." So the landlord is acknowledging that the tenant has already received the dollar, but the tenant hasn't actually paid it. Hmm, maybe that's a problem because the consideration wasn't actually given.

Alternatively, maybe the consideration for the option is the tenant's promise to sign the lease and pay the two months' rent. But I'm a bit confused here.

Looking at the options:

Option B says no unless the tenant paid or tendered the dollar. That makes sense because without consideration, the offer could be revoked. But the landlord's letter states that the consideration is acknowledged, which might be a problem because the tenant didn't actually pay it. So without that consideration, the offer isn't binding, and the landlord can revoke it.

Option C says yes because it shows a willingness to enter a bargain. But if the landlord can revoke because the consideration wasn't met, then this might not be correct.

Option F says yes because consideration can be inferred from the month-to-month lease. I'm not sure about that. The option contract requires separate consideration, so past consideration (like the existing lease) isn't enough. So F might not be right.

Option J says yes because the tenant can accept within 20 days regardless of landlord's change of mind. But if the option isn't properly formed (because no consideration), then the landlord can revoke, so J might not be correct.

So back to the question: was the landlord's letter an effective offer? If the option requires consideration, and the tenant didn't pay the dollar, then the offer wasn't binding. The landlord could revoke it before acceptance. Therefore, the answer would be B.

Wait, but let me think again. The landlord's letter says "in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged." So the landlord is acknowledging that the tenant received the dollar. But the tenant didn't actually pay it. So the consideration wasn't given. Therefore, the option isn't supported by consideration, making the offer revocable. So the landlord can change his mind, meaning the offer wasn't effective. So the answer would be B: No, unless the tenant paid or tendered the dollar.

Another angle: maybe the offer is still an offer, but without consideration, the landlord can revoke it. So the offer wasn't effective because the option wasn't properly formed. So the landlord could retract, making option A correct. Option A says no because landlord can retract before acceptance.

Wait, option A says no because the landlord can retract at any time before acceptance. But if the offer was an option with consideration, then the landlord can't retract. Since the consideration wasn't given, the option isn't valid, so the landlord can retract. So the offer wasn't effective as an option, so the landlord can revoke. Therefore, the answer would be B because it hinges on whether the consideration was provided.

Wait, maybe I'm conflating offer and option. The landlord's letter is an offer that includes an option. The option needs consideration. Without that consideration, the offer isn't irrevocable. So even if it's an offer, the landlord can revoke it unless there's consideration for the option.

In this case, the tenant didn't pay the dollar, so the option isn't supported by consideration. So the landlord's offer can be revoked. Therefore, the landlord's letter wasn't an effective offer because the option wasn't properly formed. So the answer would be B.

Alternatively, option C says yes because it's a willingness to enter a specific bargain. But without consideration, the offer can be revoked. So C might not be correct.

Wait, but the letter was an offer for a lease, with an option period. So without consideration for the option, the offer can be revoked any time. So the landlord's offer wasn't effective as an option because no consideration was given, so the offer wasn't binding, and the landlord could retract. Therefore, the effective offer wasn't made, so the answer would be B.

The question revolves around whether the landlord's letter constituted an effective offer for a two-year lease. To determine this, it is essential to analyze the elements of contract formation, particularly the requirements for an offer and an option.

The landlord's letter provided the tenant with a 20-day option to sign a two-year lease at a reduced rent, conditioned on the tenant paying two months' rent in advance. The letter also stated that the option was given "in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged." However, the tenant never paid the one dollar, which raises the issue of whether the option was properly supported by consideration.

Under contract law, an option requires consideration to be binding. Without consideration, the offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance. In this case, the landlord acknowledged receipt of the one dollar, but the tenant did not actually pay it. Since the consideration was not provided, the option was not properly formed, and the landlord retained the right to revoke the offer before the tenant attempted to accept it.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While it is true that the landlord can retract the offer before acceptance, this is only because the option was not supported by consideration, making the offer revocable.
- **Option B**: Correct. The landlord's letter did not constitute an effective offer because the tenant did not pay or tender the one-dollar consideration required for the option to be binding.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While the letter manifested a willingness to enter into a bargain, the lack of consideration means the offer was not binding and could be revoked.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The consideration for the option cannot be inferred from the existing month-to-month lease, as past consideration is insufficient to support a new option contract.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The landlord's ability to revoke the offer before acceptance demonstrates that the tenant did not have a binding right to accept within the 20-day period.

The key issue is the absence of consideration for the option, which means the landlord's letter was not an effective offer. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: No, unless the tenant paid or tendered the one-dollar consideration.**

Answer: B
