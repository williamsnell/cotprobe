Okay, so I've got this question about the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and what it means when it changes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the CPI goes from 120 to 150. I remember that CPI is a measure of the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services. So if CPI increases, that means prices have gone up, right? Because a higher CPI indicates inflation.

Wait, how do I calculate the percentage change? I think it's something like (New CPI - Old CPI)/Old CPI * 100. So plugging in the numbers: (150 - 120)/120 = 30/120 = 0.25, which is 25%. So that would mean a 25% increase in prices.

Wait, let me double-check that formula. Yeah, percentage change is (new - old)/old. So yes, 30 divided by 120 is 0.25, so 25% rise. So the correct answer should be that prices have risen 25 percent.

Looking at the options, option J is "risen 25 percent." So I should choose J. I don't think any of the other options make sense here. The other options talk about falling or different percentages, but my calculation shows a 25% increase.

The CPI increasing from 120 to 150 indicates a rise in prices. The percentage change is calculated as ((150 - 120)/120) * 100 = 25%. Thus, prices have risen by 25 percent.

Answer: J
