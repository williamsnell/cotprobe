Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically regarding offers and their enforceability. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which offer isn't enforceable if the seller changes their mind before the buyer accepts. The options are from A to I, each with different scenarios. I need to figure out which one the seller can revoke even after making the offer, making it unenforceable.

From what I remember, under common law, offers are revocable unless certain exceptions apply. The main exceptions I can think of are:

1. **Option Contracts**: If the offeror (the seller) agrees to keep the offer open for a certain period in exchange for consideration (something of value), then the offer becomes irrevocable during that time. So if the buyer pays for the option, the seller can't revoke it.

2. **Merchant's Firm Offer**: Under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), if the offer is from a merchant (someone who deals in goods), and they sign a written offer to keep it open for a certain time, it's irrevocable without consideration, but the time can't exceed three months. This is often referred to as a firm offer.

3. **Promissory Estoppel**: If the offeror makes a promise that the offeree relies on to their detriment, the offer might be enforced even if revoked, but this is more about fairness in specific situations and might not apply here.

Now, looking at each option:

- **Option A**: A merchant emails an offer to sell for $35k, promising to keep it open for ten days. Since it's a merchant and they're keeping it open in writing, under UCC, this should be a firm offer. So it's enforceable; the seller can't revoke it. So this isn't the answer.

- **Option B**: Merchant sends a written offer without a time frame. Without a specified time, I think the offer might be revocable. Wait, but under common law, offers can be revoked any time before acceptance unless it's an option or a firm offer. But since this is a merchant, if it's a written offer without a time frame, maybe it's not a firm offer. Wait, the firm offer under UCC requires that the offer state a time period. So if no time is specified, it's revocable. So maybe B is an option.

- **Option C**: Telegraph offer with a ten-day hold. Telegraph is a written form, so similar to A. Merchant, written, ten daysâ€”firm offer under UCC. So enforceable, not the answer.

- **Option D**: Written offer stating irrevocable for ten days. This sounds like a firm offer. So enforceable, not the answer.

- **Option E**: Verbal offer. Common law says offers are revocable unless it's an option with consideration. Since it's verbal, and no mention of consideration, the seller can revoke. So E could be the answer.

- **Option F**: Fax offer with ten-day hold. Fax is written, so under UCC, it's a firm offer. Enforceable, not the answer.

- **Option G**: Written offer, irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $2. But the buyer didn't pay. So without consideration, the offer can be revoked. So G is revocable, making it unenforceable. So G is a possible answer.

- **Option H**: Written offer, irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $1, and buyer paid. So there's consideration. This is an option contract. So it's enforceable, not the answer.

- **Option I**: Written offer without any mention of irrevocability. So under common law, it's revocable. So I is another possible answer.

Wait, the question is asking which is NOT enforceable if the seller revokes before acceptance. So which offer can the seller revoke, making the offer not enforceable.

Looking back, let's categorize each option:

- **A, C, D, F**: All are firm offers under UCC because they're merchants, written, and specify a time. So enforceable.

- **E**: Verbal, no consideration, so revocable. So not enforceable.

- **B**: Written, merchant, but no time frame. So under UCC, the firm offer requires a stated time. Without that, it's revocable. So B is revocable.

- **G**: Offer to be irrevocable if buyer pays $2, but buyer didn't. So no consideration, so revocable.

- **H**: Buyer paid, so it's an option contract, enforceable.

- **I**: Written offer, but no mention of being held open. So revocable under common law.

So the options where the offer is not enforceable (because the seller can revoke) are B, E, G, I.

Wait, the question asks which is not enforceable. So which one of the options is revocable.

Looking again, the question is phrased as: which offer is not enforceable if the seller changes mind before acceptance.

So which of these offers can the seller revoke, thus making the offer unenforceable.

Let me think about each option:

Option E is a verbal offer. Unless it's for goods and within the Statute of Frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in writing, but for the sale of widgets (goods), if it's over a certain amount, like $500, it might need to be in writing. Wait, but the question is about revocability, not about whether a contract is enforceable once accepted. Hmm, but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, but that's when the contract is actually formed. Here, the issue is whether the offer can be revoked.

So, for option E, a verbal offer. Under common law, offers are revocable unless it's an option with consideration. So E is revocable, so not enforceable if seller revokes.

Option B: Written offer, no time frame. Since it's a merchant, but without a time, under UCC, the firm offer requires a time. So without a time, it's revocable. So B is revocable.

Option G: The offer says it's irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $2, but buyer didn't. So no consideration, so offer is revocable.

Option I: Written offer but doesn't state it's held open. So revocable.

Wait, but under common law, unless it's an option, offers can be revoked. So which options are not firm offers or option contracts.

So the question is, which one is revocable, thus not enforceable.

Now, looking back, the question is about which offer is not enforceable. So the correct answer is the one that can be revoked.

Looking through the options, the answer would be either E, B, G, or I.

But let's think about UCC vs common law.

The UCC applies to the sale of goods. So all these options are about widgets, so goods, thus UCC applies unless the situation falls under common law (like for real estate, services, etc.).

So, in UCC, a firm offer (merchant, written, signed, with a time) is irrevocable. Without a time, it's revocable.

So, options that don't meet the firm offer criteria can be revoked.

So, option B: written offer, no time. So under UCC, without a time, it's revocable. So the offer can be revoked, making it unenforceable if seller changes mind.

Option E: verbal, so under common law, revocable. So also unenforceable.

Option G: written, but condition on payment which didn't happen, so no consideration, so revocable.

Option I: written but no time, so under UCC, revocable.

So, which of these are the options in the choices.

Looking at the options, which ones are revocable.

The question is a bit tricky. The possible answers are B, E, G, I.

Wait, but the question is phrased as, which offer is "not enforceable if the seller changes his mind prior to acceptance".

So the correct answer is the offer that the seller can revoke, making the offer unenforceable.

Now, looking at each option, the one that is definitely revocable is option E, because it's a verbal offer, and under common law, it can be revoked unless it's an option with consideration.

But wait, under UCC, are verbal offers for goods revocable? Yes, unless it's an option.

So, in E, it's a verbal offer, so revocable, not enforceable.

But let's check the other options.

Option B: merchant sends written offer without time. Since no time specified, under UCC, it's revocable. So not enforceable.

But which one is the answer? Because the question is multiple-choice and expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the rules again.

Under UCC, a firm offer requires:

- Written and signed by the offeror.

- Contains some assurance that it's firm (like "we agree to hold this offer open").

- Gives a time period or if no time, it's irrevocable for a reasonable time, but I think without a time, it's not a firm offer.

Wait, UCC 2-205 says that a merchant's firm offer must be in writing and signed, and must state that it is firm. It can be firm for a specified time, but if no time is stated, it's firm for a reasonable time, not exceeding three months.

Wait, no. Let me recall: UCC 2-205(1) says that an offer by a merchant contained in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance to the offeree that it is firm will be irrevocable, notwithstanding lack of consideration, for the time stated in the offer. If the offer states a time, that's the duration, but if it doesn't, it's for a reasonable time, not exceeding three months.

Wait, so in option B, the written offer doesn't specify a time frame. So under UCC 2-205, it would still be a firm offer, but the time would be a reasonable time, which the court would determine. So the offer would be irrevocable for a reasonable time, not exceeding three months.

Wait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. So if the merchant's written offer doesn't specify a time, it's still a firm offer for a reasonable time. So option B's offer would be irrevocable for a reasonable period. Thus, the seller can't revoke, making option B enforceable, so not the answer.

Wait, this changes things. So option B is a firm offer because it's written, by a merchant, and presumably gives assurance (since it's a written offer without a time, but under UCC, the lack of time doesn't negate the firmness, just limits the duration to a reasonable time).

So, in that case, option B is a firm offer, thus enforceable. So the seller can't revoke, so it's not the answer.

So which options are revocable?

Options E, G, I, and possibly others.

Option E: verbal offer. Under UCC, unless it's an option, it's revocable. So seller can revoke.

Option G: written offer, but the condition for irrevocability wasn't met (buyer didn't pay $2). So without consideration, it's revocable.

Option I: written offer, but doesn't state it's held open, so under common law, revocable. But under UCC, if it's a merchant's offer, and it's written, but doesn't state it's firm or a time, I'm a bit confused. Wait, UCC requires that the offer give some assurance that it's firm. So if the offer doesn't state that it's firm, then it's not a firm offer under UCC 2-205.

So in option I, the merchant writes offering to sell for $35k but doesn't say anything about the offer being held open. So it's a standard offer, which under common law is revocable. So, the seller can revoke, making it not enforceable.

Wait, but under UCC 2-205, the offer must give some assurance that it's firm. So if the offer doesn't say anything about being firm or held open, then it's not a firm offer, and thus revocable.

So, the revocable offers are E, G, I, and possibly others.

Now, the question is which of the options is not enforceable because the seller can revoke.

Looking again:

Option E: verbal offer. Under common law, revocable, so not enforceable.

Option G: written offer with condition, but condition not met. Revocable.

Option I: written offer that doesn't state it's firm. Revocable.

So, which of these is an option in the choices.

The question is to choose one answer. So, looking at the options, the correct answer is the one that is revocable.

Now, I think the answer might be option E, because it's a verbal offer, which under common law is revocable, so not enforceable.

Alternatively, option G could be the answer because the condition wasn't met. So without consideration, the offer can be revoked.

Wait, but which one is not enforceable. The question is asking which offer is not enforceable if the seller revokes before acceptance.

So, for an offer to be enforceable, it must be irrevocable. If the seller can revoke it, then the offer is not enforceable.

So, the correct answer would be the offer that the seller can revoke.

Now, looking back, option E is a verbal offer. So yes, the seller can revoke it, making it not enforceable.

Option G is a written offer, but the condition for irrevocability wasn't met (buyer didn't pay). So the offer can be revoked.

Option I is a written offer without any firm assurance, so revocable.

So, all of E, G, I are revocable, but the question is which one is an option here.

Wait, the question gives options A to I. So I need to pick which one is not enforceable.

But the original options are A to I, and I have to choose one.

Wait, among the options, which is not a firm offer and not supported by consideration.

Let me go through each option again:

A: Merchant, written, ten days â†’ firm offer, enforceable.

B: Merchant, written, no time â†’ firm offer for reasonable time, enforceable.

C: Merchant, telegraph (written), ten days â†’ firm offer, enforceable.

D: Merchant, written, irrevocable for ten days â†’ firm offer, enforceable.

E: Merchant, verbal â†’ revocable, not enforceable.

F: Merchant, fax (written), ten days â†’ firm offer, enforceable.

G: Merchant, written, irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $2, but buyer didn't pay â†’ without consideration, revocable, so not enforceable.

H: Merchant, written, irrevocable if buyer pays $1, and buyer did â†’ option contract, enforceable.

I: Merchant, written offer, no mention of holding â†’ revocable, not enforceable.

So, options E, G, I are not enforceable because the seller can revoke.

But the question is which one is the answer. So, perhaps the intended answer is E, because it's a verbal offer, which is revocable. But G and I are also revocable.

Wait, but the question is about the sale of widgets, which are goods, so UCC applies. So perhaps option I is a written offer but doesn't state it's firm, so under UCC, it's revocable.

Option E is verbal, which under UCC is revocable unless it's an option. So E is not enforceable.

But the options are about which offer is not enforceable. So, which of the options is revocable.

The answer would be E, G, I. But which of these options is in the choices.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because without consideration, the offer can be revoked.

Wait, but the question is about the seller changing mind before acceptance. So for which offers can the seller revoke, making the offer unenforceable.

So, the correct answer is E, because it's a verbal offer and thus revocable. But I'm getting a bit stuck because there are multiple options that fit.

Wait, another angle: under UCC, a merchant's firm offer must be in writing. So for the offers that are written but don't meet the firm offer criteria, they are revocable.

Option I is a written offer but doesn't state it's firm. So under UCC, it's revocable.

Option G is a written offer but conditioned on payment which wasn't made. So no consideration, thus revocable.

Option E is verbal, so revocable.

So, the options are E, G, I.

But the question is which one is the correct answer. I think the intended answer might be E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because without consideration, the offer isn't irrevocable.

Wait, but the question is about which offer is not enforceable, meaning the offer can be revoked.

So, if the seller can revoke, then the offer is not enforceable.

So, the options that are revocable are E, G, I.

But looking back, the question is, which is not enforceable if the seller changes mind.

In the options, the correct answer is likely E, because it's a verbal offer, which is revocable.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think about each option's enforceability.

Option A: Firm offer, enforceable.

Option B: Firm offer (because under UCC, even without time, it's firm for a reasonable time), so enforceable.

Option C: Firm offer, enforceable.

Option D: Firm offer, enforceable.

Option E: Verbal, revocable â†’ not enforceable.

Option F: Firm offer, enforceable.

Option G: No consideration, revocable â†’ not enforceable.

Option H: Option contract, enforceable.

Option I: Revocable, not enforceable.

So the possible answers are E, G, I.

But the question only allows one correct answer, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because it's a written offer but lacks consideration, making the irrevocability condition fail.

Wait, but option G says "if buyer will pay $2.00. Buyer doesn't pay." So the condition wasn't met, so the offer isn't held open. So the offer is revocable.

But that's an option contract scenario, but without consideration, the offer isn't held. So G is not enforceable.

I think the intended answer is E because it's the only verbal offer, making it clearly revocable
