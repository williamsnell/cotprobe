Consequently, the woman decided to see the fortuneteller in order to have her Tarot cards read. As the fortuneteller was telling the woman her fortune, she suddenly said, "I have a vision. If you give me $25,000 tomorrow, you will live to be 100 years old. " The woman, who was 72 years of age, believed the fortuneteller and gave her the money the next day. The following week, the woman's physician informed her that she had a serious heart disease and he didn't expect her to live for more than a year or two. If the woman asserts a claim against the fortuneteller based on deceit, the plaintiff should

G: not prevail, if she cannot prove the fortuneteller's deceit.

Okay, so I've got this question about a fortune teller and a woman who gave her money based on a prediction. The question is about whether the woman can successfully sue the fortune teller for deceit. I'm a bit rusty on my tort law, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that the fortune teller told the woman that if she gave her $25,000, she'd live to be 100. The woman, who's 72 and worried about her health, believed this and paid the money. Then her doctor told her she has serious heart disease and might not live more than a year or two. So she's suing based on deceit.

Deceit, I think, is about intentional misrepresentation that causes harm. For deceit, the elements are: a false representation of a material fact, knowledge that it's false, intent to induce reliance, actual reliance, and damages as a result.

In this case, the fortune teller made a specific claimâ€”that giving $25k would make her live to 100. But does that count as a false representation? Well, the fortune teller might argue that she was just giving a prediction based on her supposed clairvoyance, not stating it as a fact.

Wait, but the woman believed the fortune teller could see the future because she was advertised as clairvoyant. So maybe the fortune teller was holding herself out as having special knowledge. If she made a statement that she knew wasn't true, that could be deceit.

So, the key is whether the fortune teller honestly believed her own prediction. If she actually thought the woman would live to 100, then maybe she wasn't being deceitful. But if she knew it was false and just said it to get the money, that's deceit.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the woman won't prevail unless the fortune teller warranted the truth as believed. Warranting the truth would mean she guaranteed it, which might not be the case here. She was just making a prediction.

Option B talks about a fiduciary relationship. I don't think that applies here because there's no such relationship between a fortune teller and client, as far as I know.

Option C says she'll prevail if the fortune teller had a history of fraud. I don't think past fraud is necessary; the deceit in this specific instance is what matters.

Option D says she'll prevail if the fortune teller didn't honestly believe the prediction. That makes sense because if the fortune teller knew it was false, that's deceit. If she believed it, maybe not.

Option E suggests it's not deceit because there was no force. But deceit doesn't require force; it's about the false statement leading to reliance.

Option F says it matters if she didn't ask for a refund. I don't think that's a factor in proving deceit. The harm is the loss of money, not whether she asked for it back.

Option G says she won't prevail if she can't prove deceit. That's true, but the question is about what's needed for her to prevail, so this option is about the burden of proof.

Option H says she'll prevail because she relied to her detriment. Reliance is a factor, but the other elements like falsity and intent to deceive are also needed.

Option I says she'll win if the fortune teller can't prove her abilities. I'm not sure about that. The issue is whether the statement was made with knowledge of its falsity.

So, the main point is whether the fortune teller honestly believed her prediction. If she didn't, then it's deceit. So the answer should be D.

To determine whether the woman can prevail in her claim against the fortune teller based on deceit, we must analyze the elements of deceit: a false representation of a material fact, knowledge of its falsity, intent to induce reliance, actual reliance, and resulting damages.

The fortune teller made a specific prediction that if the woman gave her $25,000, she would live to be 100. The woman relied on this prediction, believing the fortune teller's claim of clairvoyance. The critical issue is whether the fortune teller honestly believed her own prediction. If she knew the statement was false and made it with the intent to deceive, this would constitute deceit. However, if she genuinely believed the prediction, the claim of deceit would fail.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The fortune teller does not need to have warranted the truth of the prediction; the focus is on whether she knowingly made a false statement.
- **B**: Incorrect. A fiduciary relationship is not required for a deceit claim.
- **C**: Incorrect. A history of fraudulent activities is not necessary to prove deceit in this specific instance.
- **D**: Correct. If the fortune teller did not honestly believe the prediction, this would satisfy the element of knowledge of falsity, making the claim of deceit valid.
- **E**: Incorrect. The absence of force does not negate the deceit claim; reliance on the false statement is sufficient.
- **F**: Incorrect. Whether the woman asked for a refund is irrelevant to proving deceit.
- **G**: Incorrect. While proving deceit is necessary, this option does not address the specific conditions under which the woman would prevail.
- **H**: Incorrect. While reliance is a factor, the fortune teller's knowledge of the falsity of the statement is also required.
- **I**: Incorrect. The fortune teller's ability to prove her clairvoyant abilities is not the central issue; the focus is on whether she knowingly made a false statement.

The woman will prevail if she can show that the fortune teller did not honestly believe the prediction. This aligns with **Option D**.
