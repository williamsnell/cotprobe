Question:

A man wearing a jacket and jeans walked along a city street at night in a high crime area known for drug trafficking and gun violence. He saw two police officers walking toward him. The officers were checking on a 911 call from a resident who observed a man in jeans and a jacket apparently selling drugs to people on the street. When the police first saw him, he was walking alone, in the area that the woman identified. As they approached, he suddenly crossed the street by jaywalking. They followed, and approaching from behind, asked him to stop. He started walking faster, away from them. The officers saw what appeared to be a heavy object bulging in his pocket as he moved. The officers, with over 10 years of foot patrol experience, stepped up and stopped him. They patted him down and found a concealed, unlicensed handgun in the jacket pocket. They then made a full search and found 50 packets of heroin. He filed a motion to suppress the gun and drug evidence. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?

Options:

A: No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.
B: No, because the man's suspicious behavior and the bulge in his pocket gave the police probable cause to search him.
C: Yes, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the man simply because he crossed the street and walked faster away from them.
D: Yes, because the police didn't have a warrant to search the man.
E: Yes, because the heavy object in the man's pocket could have been anything and didn't necessarily indicate criminal activity.
F: No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.
G: No, because the police had witnessed a crime, jaywalking, which gave them the authority to stop the man.
H: Yes, because they didn't know if this was the same man, they observed nothing illegal except jaywalking, and he had a right to avoid them under the circumstances.
I: Yes, because the police had no evidence that the man was the same one the resident had reported.
J: No, because the man matched the description of the suspected drug dealer and was in a high crime area.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a man being stopped by police and whether the evidence found on him will be suppressed. I'm not super familiar with all the nuances of criminal procedure, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that in the US, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. For the police to stop someone, they need reasonable suspicion, which is less than probable cause but more than a hunch. Reasonable suspicion requires that the officer can point to specific, articulable facts that, taken together, suggest criminal activity.

So the scenario is that a man is walking in a high-crime area known for drug trafficking and gun violence. He's wearing jeans and a jacket. A 911 call came in about a man matching that description selling drugs. The police see him walking alone in the area mentioned. Then he jaywalks across the street. The officers follow and ask him to stop, but he starts walking faster. They notice a bulge in his pocket, which looks like a heavy object, so they stop him, pat him down, find a handgun, and then find drugs.

The man is trying to suppress the evidence, so the question is whether the court will agree.

I think the key issue here is whether the police had reasonable suspicion to stop him. Let's break down the factors:

1. He matches the description from the 911 call. The call was about a man in jeans and a jacket selling drugs. So he fits that description.

2. The area is high crime, which might make the police more vigilant, but just being in a high-crime area isn't enough on its own.

3. He was walking alone, which might be suspicious if the area is deserted, but not sure if that's a big factor.

4. He jaywalked when he saw the police. I remember that evasive actions can contribute to reasonable suspicion. Like, in some cases, avoiding the police or changing behavior upon seeing them can be a factor.

5. When the officers approached, he started walking faster. Again, this could indicate he's trying to evade them, which might support reasonable suspicion.

6. The bulge in his pocket appeared heavy. The officers have a lot of experience, so their assessment that it could be a weapon might count as an articulable fact.

Putting this together, the police had a description matching the suspect, the man acted evasively by jaywalking and then walking away faster, and there was a possible weapon bulge. So these factors together probably gave them reasonable suspicion to stop him.

Now, the stop and frisk. Under Terry v. Ohio, if an officer has reasonable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous, they can conduct a limited pat-down for weapons. Here, the bulge suggested a heavy object, which could be a gun. So the frisk would be justified if the stop was lawful.

So the stop seems justified. Therefore, the evidence found (gun and drugs) wouldn't be suppressed because the stop and search were legal.

Looking at the options:

A says no because the accumulation of factors added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk. That sounds right because each factor adds up.

B says no because of probable cause, but I think it's reasonable suspicion, not probable cause, needed for the stop and frisk.

C says yes because they lacked reasonable suspicion. I don't think that's correct because the factors do add up.

D is about a warrant, which isn't needed for a Terry stop.

E says the bulge could be anything. But the officers' experience would let them think it's a weapon, so that's enough for articulable suspicion.

F talks about probable cause when he walked away, which isn't necessary for the stop.

G says jaywalking gave them authority, but jaywalking alone is minor. It's the combination with other factors.

H says they didn't know if it was the same man and he had a right to avoid. But matching the description and the area, plus evasive actions, likely suffice.

I says no evidence he was the same man. But the description matched, so that's enough.

J says because he matched the description and was in a high-crime area. That's part of it, but the evasive actions also matter.

So the best answer is A.
</think>

The Fourth Amendment requires that police have reasonable suspicion to stop an individual, which is a standard less than probable cause but more than a mere hunch. In this case, the man matched the description from a 911 call about a drug dealer, was in a high-crime area, and exhibited evasive behavior (jaywalking and walking faster upon seeing the police). Additionally, the officers, with their extensive experience, observed a heavy bulge in his pocket, which they reasonably suspected could be a weapon. These factors collectively provided the necessary reasonable suspicion to justify the stop. Under Terry v. Ohio, the officers were also justified in conducting a limited pat-down for weapons due to the suspicion that the man was armed and dangerous. Therefore, the stop and subsequent search were lawful, and the evidence found will not be suppressed.

The correct answer is **A**.
