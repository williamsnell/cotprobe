Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that 10 calories of heat are supplied to 1 gram of water, and we need to find out how much the mass of the water increases. The options are given from A to J, each with different values in grams.

Hmm, I remember that when heat is added to a substance, it can cause a change in temperature and also a change in mass due to the energy-mass equivalence principle, E=mc². Wait, but is that applicable here? I mean, in everyday situations, the mass change due to heat would be really tiny, right? Because the speed of light squared is a huge number, so even a small amount of energy corresponds to a very small mass.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives heat in calories. Oh right, calories and kilocalories are often confused. I think 1 food calorie is actually a kilocalorie in scientific terms. But wait, no, wait. Wait, in physics, 1 calorie (cal) is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. And 1 kilocalorie (kcal) is 1000 cal. So, the problem says 10 calories, so that's 10 cal.

But wait, the question is about mass increase. So the heat supplied is energy, and according to E=mc², that energy corresponds to a mass. So the mass increase should be E/(c²). But wait, what units are we using here?

Let me think. Let's break it down.

First, the heat supplied is Q = 10 cal. But I need to convert that into joules because E=mc² uses joules. So how many joules are in a calorie? I recall that 1 cal is approximately 4.184 joules. So 10 cal would be 10 * 4.184 = 41.84 joules.

Wait, but wait another thing. Actually, sometimes in different contexts, people use different values. Let me make sure. Yeah, 1 calorie (cal) is about 4.184 joules. So 10 cal is 41.84 J.

Now, the energy E is 41.84 J. So according to E=mc², the mass would be E/(c²). Let's compute that.

c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second. So c squared is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So mass m = E / (c²) = 41.84 J / 9e16 m²/s².

Let me compute that. 41.84 divided by 9e16. Let's see: 41.84 / 9 is about 4.648, so 4.648e-16 kg. Wait, because 1 J is kg·m²/s², so dividing by m²/s² gives kg.

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the mass in grams. Oh right, because 1 kg is 1000 grams, so I need to convert kg to grams. So 4.648e-16 kg is 4.648e-13 grams.

Wait, 4.648e-13 grams. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 10 cal = 10 * 4.184 J = 41.84 J.

E = mc² → m = E/(c²) = 41.84 / (9e16) kg.

Yes, that's 41.84 / 9e16 = approximately 4.648e-16 kg.

But wait, 1 kg is 1e3 grams, so 4.648e-16 kg * 1e3 g/kg = 4.648e-13 grams.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one is close to 4.6e-13 g.

Wait, let's look at the options:

A: 5.5e-13 g
B: 2.5e-13
C: 2e-12
D:4.7e-13
E:8.6e-13
F:6.8e-13
G:9.1e-13
H:3.2e-13
I:7.9e-13
J:1.3e-12

So my calculation gives approximately 4.6e-13 g. The closest option is D:4.7e-13. But wait, let me double-check my numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Compute 41.84 J / (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute denominator: (3e8)^2 =9e16.

So 41.84 / 9e16 = (41.84 /9) * 1e-16.

41.84 divided by 9: 9*4=36, 41.84-36=5.84. So 4 + 5.84/9 = approx 4.648.

So yes, 4.648e-16 kg = 4.648e-13 grams. So 4.65e-13 grams.

Looking at the options, D is 4.7e-13, which is very close. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I forget to account for something else? Oh, wait, the water is initially 1 gram. Does that affect anything? Hmm, I don't think so because the mass change is due to the energy added, and it's a separate calculation. The initial mass is just the mass of the water before heating.

So the mass increase is about 4.6e-13 grams, so the correct option is D:4.7e-13 grams.
</think>

To determine the mass increase of 1 g of water when 10 calories of heat are supplied, we use the principle of energy-mass equivalence, \( E = mc^2 \). Here, the energy \( E \) is the heat supplied, and the mass increase \( \Delta m \) is given by:

\[
\Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert heat energy to joules
The problem specifies 10 calories (cal) of heat. Since 1 cal = 4.184 joules (J), the total energy is:

\[
E = 10 \, \text{cal} \times 4.184 \, \text{J/cal} = 41.84 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass increase
The speed of light \( c \) is approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), so \( c^2 = (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\Delta m = \frac{41.84 \, \text{J}}{9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\Delta m = \frac{41.84}{9 \times 10^{16}} \approx 4.648 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 3: Convert to grams
Since \( 1 \, \text{kg} = 10^3 \, \text{g} \), the mass increase in grams is:

\[
\Delta m = 4.648 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{kg} \times 10^3 \, \text{g/kg} = 4.648 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated mass increase is approximately \( 4.65 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{g} \), which is closest to option **D: \( 4.7 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{g} \)**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: 4.7 × 10^-13g**
