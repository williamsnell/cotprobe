Question:

This question refers to the following information.
While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive warâ€¦ most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or "Sea of Precious Virtues," written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.
Robert Irwin, "Islam and the Crusades," 1995
It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.
Ibn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185

Okay, so I have this question about the Crusades and Islamic views during that time. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question provides two passages. The first is from Robert Irwin's "Islam and the Crusades," and the second is from Ibn Jubayr, a Muslim scholar who traveled around 1185. The question is asking which traditional historical assumption the first passage supports.

So, first, I'll read the first passage again. It says that while some theorists in the Middle Ages thought jihad was defensive, most authorities believed the obligation of jihad didn't end until the whole world was under Islam. The Bahr al-Fava'id, written in the 1150s or 60s, insists that a Muslim ruler's first duty is to prosecute jihad and bring victory to Islam. If a ruler makes peace with infidels instead, he's better off dead because he's corrupting the world.

Hmm, so this passage is talking about the majority view among Muslim authorities. They saw jihad as an ongoing obligation until Islam's dominance. The Bahr al-Fava'id is pretty clear that rulers must pursue jihad; making peace is bad. So this suggests that the idea of holy war, jihad, was a serious and active part of their ideology.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Economic gain over religious fervor. The passage doesn't mention economics, so probably not A.

B: Peaceful coexistence. The passage is more about waging war until Islam prevails, so B doesn't fit.

C: Scholarly pursuits over warfare. Again, the passage is about jihad, so maybe not C.

D: More peaceful than Christians. The passage doesn't compare to Christians, so D might not be right.

E: Driven to violence by faith. It mentions jihad as an obligation, but "inherently violent" might be too strong. Jihad can be interpreted in different ways, not just violence.

F: Protecting their territory. The passage says until the whole world is under Islam, which is more offensive than defensive.

G: Elites took holy war seriously. Yes, the passage says most authorities held that view.

H: Dismissed holy war. Opposite of G, so no.

I: Indifferent to holy war. No, the passage says most took it seriously.

J: Converting Christians. The passage doesn't specifically mention conversion, more about bringing under Islam's sway, which could involve conversion but the focus is on the duty to prosecute jihad.

So, the first passage supports that the ideology of holy war (jihad) was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the Crusades era.

Looking back at the options, that's option G.
</think>

The first passage discusses the prevailing view among Muslim authorities during the Crusading era, emphasizing that jihad was seen as an ongoing obligation until Islam's global dominance. It highlights the Bahr al-Fava'id's insistence that Muslim rulers must prosecute jihad and that making peace with infidels was considered corrupt. This indicates that the ideology of holy war was a serious and active part of their ideology, particularly among Muslim elites.

Analyzing the options, the passage aligns with option G: "That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era."

Answer: G
