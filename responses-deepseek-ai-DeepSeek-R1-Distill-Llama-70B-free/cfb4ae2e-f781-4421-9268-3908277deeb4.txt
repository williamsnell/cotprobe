Okay, so I've got this problem here where Charles is going to pay Bernice $800 in five years if she lends him $500 now. I need to find the rate of return on this loan. Hmm, I think this is a present value problem, right? Because it's about how much money now will grow to a certain amount in the future.

Wait, so Bernice is lending $500 today, and in five years, she'll get $800. So the question is asking for the rate that makes the present value of $800 equal to $500. That rate is the return on investment or the interest rate, I guess.

I remember the present value formula is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. Here, PV is $500, FV is $800, n is 5 years. I need to solve for r.

So plugging in the numbers: 500 = 800 / (1 + r)^5. I need to rearrange this to solve for r. Let me write it as (1 + r)^5 = 800 / 500. Oh wait, 800 divided by 500 is 1.6. So (1 + r)^5 = 1.6.

To solve for r, I take the fifth root of both sides. So 1 + r = (1.6)^(1/5). I think I can calculate this using logarithms or maybe remember the rule of 72 or something, but probably better to compute it step by step.

Let me try taking the natural logarithm of both sides. ln(1 + r) = (1/5) * ln(1.6). Calculating ln(1.6) first. I know ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, e is about 2.718. So 1.6 is less than e. Let me approximate ln(1.6). I think ln(1.6) is approximately 0.47, but wait, let me think better. Wait, ln(1.5) is about 0.4055, and ln(1.6) is higher. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, using a calculator approach in my head: ln(1.6) ≈ 0.4700. Let me double-check. Since e^0.47 is about e^0.4 is 1.4918, e^0.47 is about 1.600, yes, because e^0.47 ≈ 1.600. So, ln(1.6) is approximately 0.47.

So (1/5)*0.47 is 0.094. So ln(1 + r) ≈ 0.094. Now, to get 1 + r, I take e^0.094. What's e^0.09? I remember that e^0.1 is about 1.10517. So 0.094 is a bit less than 0.1. Let me approximate e^0.094.

Using the Taylor series: e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2. So x is 0.094. So 1 + 0.094 + (0.094)^2 / 2. (0.094)^2 is about 0.008836, divided by 2 is 0.004418. So adding up: 1 + 0.094 is 1.094, plus 0.004418 is 1.0984. So e^0.094 ≈ 1.0984. So 1 + r ≈ 1.0984, meaning r ≈ 0.0984, which is 9.84%. Wait, but looking at the options, there's a G option which is 9.86%, and an F which is 14.86%. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is a bit off.

Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithms more accurately. Let's see: natural log of 1.6 is approximately 0.470004. So 0.470004 divided by 5 is 0.0940008. Then, exponentiating that: e^0.0940008. Let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the rule of 72. The rule of 72 says that the doubling time is about 72 divided by the interest rate. Wait, but in this case, the amount grows from 500 to 800, which is 1.6 times, so it's less than doubling. Alternatively, the time is 5 years, so maybe the rate is around 14%? Wait, because 500 at 14% for 5 years: let's see, 500*(1.14)^5. Hmm, 1.14^5 is approx 1.14 * 1.14 = 1.2996; 1.2996 * 1.14 ≈ 1.4815; 1.4815 * 1.14 ≈ 1.688; 1.688 * 1.14 ≈ 1.925. So 500*1.925 is about 962.5, which is higher than 800. So 14% is too high.

Wait, perhaps 10%. Let's compute 1.10^5. 1.1^5 is 1.61051. So 500 * 1.61051 is 805.255, which is just a bit above 800. So at 10%, the future value would be about $805, which is a bit more than $800. So the rate should be a little less than 10%. So 9.8% ish? Because at 9.8%, let's see.

Wait, maybe using the exact formula. Let me go back.

We have (1 + r)^5 = 1.6.

I need to compute r.

Another approach: let me take logarithms base 10. log10(1.6) is approximately 0.2041. So (1/5)*0.2041 = 0.04082. So log10(1 + r) = 0.04082. So 1 + r = 10^0.04082.

10^0.04 is about 1.0965, and 10^0.04082 is a bit higher. Let's compute 10^0.04082.

Wait, 10^0.04 = 1.0965. 0.04082 is 0.04 + 0.00082. So the additional 0.00082 in the exponent. Using the approximation that 10^(x) ≈ 1 + x * ln(10) for small x. Wait, no, that's for natural logs. Alternatively, since it's 0.00082 in log10, which is equivalent to 0.00082 * ln(10) in natural logs. So 0.00082 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.001887. So e^0.001887 is approximately 1.00189. So 10^0.04082 ≈ 1.0965 * 1.00189 ≈ 1.0987.

So 1 + r ≈ 1.0987, so r ≈ 0.0987 or 9.87%, which is approximately 9.87%. Looking at the options, option G is 9.86%. So that's very close.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier because when I calculated with natural logs, I got approximately 9.84%, but with this base 10 method, I get 9.87%. Hmm. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps better to use the formula for compound interest. Let me think again.

The formula is 500 = 800 / (1 + r)^5.

So (1 + r)^5 = 800/500 = 1.6.

Taking both sides to the 1/5 power: 1 + r = 1.6^(0.2).

I can compute 1.6^0.2. Let me see. Let's compute ln(1.6) = 0.470004. Multiply by 0.2: 0.0940008.

Exponentiate that: e^0.0940008 ≈ 1.0985. So 1 + r ≈ 1.0985 → r ≈ 0.0985, which is 9.85%. The options are G:9.86% and H:8.86%. So that's very close to 9.85, so the answer should be G:9.86%. But wait, perhaps I miscalculated because exact calculation might give a slightly different value.

Alternatively, maybe I should test the options given. For example, option G is 9.86%, let's compute (1 + 0.0986)^5 and see if it equals 1.6.

Compute 1.0986^5.

Let me compute step by step:

First, 1.0986 squared: approx (1.0986)^2 = 1.0986 * 1.0986. Let's compute:

1.0986 * 1.0986:

1*1 = 1.

1*0.0986 = 0.0986.

0.0986*1 = 0.0986.

0.0986*0.0986 ≈ 0.00972.

So adding up:

1 + 0.0986 + 0.0986 + 0.00972 ≈ 1.2069.

Wait, perhaps a better way. Let me compute 1.0986 * 1.0986:

Let me compute 1.0986 * 1 = 1.0986.

1.0986 * 0.0986:

Compute 1.0986 * 0.09 = 0.098874.

1.0986 * 0.0086 = approximately 0.00944.

So total 0.098874 + 0.00944 ≈ 0.10831.

So 1.0986^2 ≈ 1.0986 + 0.10831 = 1.20691.

Now, compute 1.20691 cubed: 1.20691^3.

First, 1.20691 * 1.20691 = (let me compute that):

1.2 * 1.2 = 1.44.

1.2 * 0.0691 = approx 0.08292.

0.0691 * 1.2 = same as above, 0.08292.

0.0691 * 0.0691 ≈ 0.00477.

So adding:

1.44 + 0.08292 + 0.08292 + 0.00477 ≈ 1.44 + 0.16584 + 0.00477 = 1.61061.

Wait, that's approximate. So 1.20691^2 ≈ 1.4576? Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps better to use a calculator approach for each step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach: compute 1.0986^5 step by step.

Compute 1.0986^1 = 1.0986.

^2: 1.0986 * 1.0986 ≈ 1.2069.

^3: 1.2069 * 1.0986.

Let me compute 1.2069 * 1.0986:

1 * 1.0986 = 1.0986.

0.2069 * 1.0986 ≈ 0.2069 * 1 = 0.2069, 0.2069 * 0.0986 ≈ 0.02038, total ≈ 0.22728.

So total 1.0986 + 0.22728 ≈ 1.3259.

^3 ≈ 1.3259.

^4: 1.3259 * 1.0986.

Compute 1 *1.0986 is 1.0986.

0.3259 *1.0986 ≈ 0.3259 *1 = 0.3259, 0.3259 *0.0986 ≈ 0.03215. Total ≈ 0.35805.

So 1.0986 + 0.35805 ≈ 1.45665.

^4 ≈ 1.45665.

^5: 1.45665 * 1.0986.

Compute 1 *1.0986 = 1.0986.

0.45665 *1.0986 ≈ 0.45665 *1 = 0.45665, 0.45665 *0.0986 ≈ 0.04498. Total ≈ 0.50163.

Adding to 1.0986 gives 1.0986 + 0.50163 ≈ 1.6002.

So 1.0986^5 ≈ 1.6002, which is very close to 1.6. So yes, 9.86% gives us 1.6 when raised to the 5th power. So that's correct.

So the rate is approximately 9.86%, which is option G.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using natural logs, I got about 9.84%, but when I tested 9.86%, it worked out. So the correct answer must be G:9.86%.
</think>

To determine the rate of return on Bernice's $500 loan, we use the present value formula:

\[
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Here:
- \( PV = 500 \) (the initial loan amount),
- \( FV = 800 \) (the amount to be paid in 5 years),
- \( n = 5 \) (the number of years),
- \( r \) is the rate of return.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( r \), we get:

\[
(1 + r)^5 = \frac{FV}{PV} = \frac{800}{500} = 1.6
\]

Taking the fifth root of both sides:

\[
1 + r = 1.6^{1/5}
\]

Using logarithms to approximate \( 1.6^{1/5} \), we find:

\[
\ln(1.6) \approx 0.4700, \quad \frac{\ln(1.6)}{5} \approx 0.094
\]

Exponentiating:

\[
1 + r = e^{0.094} \approx 1.0985 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r \approx 0.0985 \, \text{or} \, 9.85\%.
\]

Testing the closest option, \( r = 9.86\% \), we calculate \( (1 + 0.0986)^5 \) and find it approximates 1.6, confirming that the rate is very close to 9.86%. Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: 9.86%**
