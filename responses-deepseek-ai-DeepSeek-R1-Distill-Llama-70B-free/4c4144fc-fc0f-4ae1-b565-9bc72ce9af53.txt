Question:

A frameshift mutation is created when

Options:

A: a base pair is moved from one location in a gene to another
B: a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one
C: telomeric sequences are removed from DNA
D: a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene
E: a large portion of a chromosome is deleted
F: a gene is duplicated within the DNA sequence
G: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that it no longer codes for any amino acid
H: a base pair is replaced with a different base pair in a gene
I: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that it codes for the same amino acid
J: a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation

Okay, so I have this genetics question here about frameshift mutations. Hmm, I remember from my notes that frameshift mutations are a type of mutation that changes the reading frame of the genetic code. Wait, the reading frame is how the mRNA is read in codons, right? So if that's altered, it can mess up the entire protein sequence from the point of the mutation onward.

The question is asking what causes a frameshift mutation. Let me look at the options. Option A says a base pair is moved from one location to another. That sounds more like a translocation or maybe an inversion, not a frameshift. Because frameshift is about insertions or deletions, I think.

Option B is a codon changing to code for a different amino acid. Oh, that's a missense mutation, right? Like a point mutation where one amino acid is substituted for another. So B isn't the right answer.

Option C talks about telomeric sequences being removed. Telomeres are the ends of chromosomes, and their removal would affect the chromosome structure, maybe leading to problems during replication. But I don't think that's directly a frameshift; it's more about chromosome structure.

Option D says a base pair is inserted or deleted. Oh wait, frameshifts are caused by insertions or deletions that are not in multiples of three. Because each codon is three bases, if you add or remove a number that's not a multiple of three, it shifts the reading frame. So D seems like a possible correct answer.

Option E is a large chromosome deletion. That would be a chromosomal mutation, not a frameshift. Frameshifts are within genes, at the nucleotide level.

Option F is gene duplication. Duplication can lead to extra copies of a gene, but that's a different type of mutation. It's a chromosomal structural change, not a frameshift.

Option G is a codon changing to a stop codon. That's a nonsense mutation. So G would result in a premature termination, but it's a point mutation, not a frameshift.

Option H is a base pair being replaced. That's a substitution, like a point mutation. Depending on where it is, it could be a missense or silent mutation, but not a frameshift.

Option I is a codon changing but still coding for the same amino acid. That's a silent mutation. Again, not a frameshift.

Option J is a codon turning into a stop codon. That's a nonsense mutation, which again is a type of point mutation, not a frameshift.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D. Frameshift happens when there's an insertion or deletion of one or more base pairs, not in multiples of three, which shifts the reading frame.

A frameshift mutation occurs when the reading frame of the genetic code is altered. This happens specifically due to the insertion or deletion of one or more base pairs in a gene, provided the number of base pairs added or removed is not a multiple of three. Such changes disrupt the codon sequence from the mutation site onward, leading to the production of a completely different protein sequence or a premature stop codon. Among the options provided, only option D correctly describes this mechanism.

Answer: D
