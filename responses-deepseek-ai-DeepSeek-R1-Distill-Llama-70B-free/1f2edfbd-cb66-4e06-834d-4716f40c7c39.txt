Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about life insurance policies and their annual costs based on payment frequencies. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question is asking about a 20-payment life policy. The face amount is $4,000, and the person is 25 years old. They want the annual cost for when payments are made annually, semiannually, and quarterly. The options are A through J, each with different numbers. 

Wait, I remember that life insurance policies can have different premium payment modes, and each mode affects the annual cost. The key here is probably calculating the annual premium for each payment frequency. But how?

I think for each payment mode, the total amount paid over the policy's term is the same, but the timing of payments changes. So, if you pay more frequently, the cost per payment might be lower because the insurer gets their money earlier. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the question is about calculating the equivalent annual cost considering the payment frequency. 

Wait, perhaps it's about the present value of all payments being equal to the policy's value. Or maybe it's about the level premiums? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's simply the annual premium being divided by the number of payments per year. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the annual cost would be the same regardless of payment frequency. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps this is about the equivalent annual cost when the payments are made more frequently. For example, if you pay semiannually, each payment is half the annual payment, but since you pay twice a year, the total per year is the same as the annual payment. Wait, no, that would mean the annual cost is the same in each case, which doesn't align with the answer options provided. So that can't be it.

Wait a second, maybe the question is about the total cost over the policy term, which is 20 payments regardless of frequency. So, for an annual payment, it's 20 payments once a year. If it's semiannual, 20 payments would be spread over 10 years (since 20 / 2 =10). Wait, that doesn't add up because 20 payments semiannually would be 20 * 2 =40 years, which doesn't make sense because the policy's term isn't given. Oh wait, the policy is a 20-payment life policy. So the total number of payments is 20, regardless of frequency. So:

- Annual payments: 20 years (since 20 payments, once each year)
- Semiannual: 10 years (20 payments, twice each year)
- Quarterly: 5 years (20 payments, four times each year)

Wait, that makes sense. So the policy is structured so that you make 20 payments in total, but the time period depends on how often you pay. So if you pay annually, the term is 20 years. If you pay semiannually, the term is 10 years. Quarterly, it's 5 years. 

But then, the question is about the annual cost. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing things. Wait, perhaps the annual cost is calculated using some interest rate, assuming that each payment has a present value. But the question doesn't mention interest rates. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the annual cost is the amount you pay each year in premiums, considering the payment frequency. So for annual payments, it's one payment per year. For semiannual, two payments per year. But the total per year would be the same, so the annual cost would be the same. But that can't be right, as the answer options have different values. So perhaps that's not the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about calculating the equivalent annual payment when considering the time value of money. So, for each payment mode, the present value of all payments equals the face amount, but I don't think the face amount is the same as the policy's value. Hmm, maybe the face amount is the death benefit, which is $4,000. So perhaps the policy is a type where the premium payments accumulate to provide the death benefit, but that seems more like a savings plan.

Wait, maybe it's a 20-year payment policy, but with different payment frequencies. So the total premium paid over 20 years (annual), 10 years (semiannual), or 5 years (quarterly) is such that the present value equals the face amount. But without an interest rate, I can't calculate anything. Wait, maybe the question assumes a certain interest rate, but it's not given. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe each payment mode's premium is calculated using the same total premium, so the annual cost varies. For example, if you pay annually, the annual premium is P. If you pay semiannually, each payment is P/2, so over a year, you pay P. Similarly for quarterly, each payment is P/4, times four, so annual is P. So in that case, the annual cost is the same regardless of payment frequency. But the answer options have varying numbers, so this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the premium being calculated using the payment mode's effective rate. Maybe it's about the equivalent annual premium considering the compounding effect. But without an interest rate, I can't compute this.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the fact that more frequent payments reduce the insurer's risk, so the annual cost is lower when paying more frequently. But I don't know the exact way this is calculated.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is about calculating the annual premium for each payment mode, considering that the total number of payments is 20. So:

- Annual: 20 payments, each at the end of the year. So the present value (PV) of 20 annual payments equals $4,000.

Wait, but the face amount is $4,000, perhaps that's the death benefit. So maybe the policy's present value is $4,000, and the premiums are being paid over 20 years in different frequencies.

Wait, but without knowing the interest rate, I can't compute the present value. Hmm, so perhaps the question is about the level annual premium, and the payment frequency affects the calculation. Maybe for each payment frequency, the level premium is calculated based on that frequency.

Wait, perhaps it's about the equivalent annual cost when the payments are made more frequently. So for example, the annual payment is P. The semiannual would be P/2 each payment, but over a year, two payments, so annual cost is P. Similarly quarterly, P/4 four times, so annual cost is still P. But that brings us back to all being the same, which doesn't match the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the options. They all have different numbers for each payment mode. For example, option A has annual:91.80, semi:88.28, quarterly:90.04. So it's not a simple division; perhaps the annual cost is calculated as the sum of the present values of each payment, but without an interest rate, I can't compute it.

Wait, maybe the question is using some standard formula or table, but I'm not recalling it. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the effective interest rate when making more frequent payments, but again, no rate is given.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the policy is a 20-payment life policy, so for annual payments, it's 20 annual payments, for semiannual, it's 20 semiannual payments (so 10 years), and quarterly, 20 quarterly payments (5 years). The annual cost in each case would be the annual premium for that term. But without knowing the interest rate or the cost per period, I can't compute it.

Wait, maybe the question is expecting me to know that, for a given policy, the annual cost decreases as the payment frequency increases because the insurer gets the money sooner. So, for example, paying quarterly would result in a lower annual cost than paying annually. But looking at the options, some have annual higher or lower than others.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the effective annual rate when making more frequent payments. For example, if the annual premium is X, then paying semiannually would be X/2 each period, but the effective annual cost is X. Hmm, but that doesn't change anything.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I don't have enough information. Maybe I should think about each option. For example, let's pick option A: Annual:91.80, Semi:88.28, Quarterly:90.04. So the semi is lower than annual, and quarterly is in between. That might make sense if the semiannual payments have a lower per-period cost, but when converted to annual, it's lower. Alternatively, maybe it's about the present value of the payments.

Another approach: perhaps the annual cost is calculated as the sum of the present value factors for each payment. For example, for annual payments, each payment is P, and the PV is P*(PVIFA(r,20)). For semiannual, each payment is P/2, and the number of periods is 40 (20 payments *2). But without knowing r, I can't compute this.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the concept of equivalent payments. Suppose the annual payment is A, semiannual is S (per period), and quarterly is Q. Then, the present value for each case should be equal to the face value, which is $4,000.

So, for annual payments:

PV = A * (PVIFA(r, 20)) = 4000.

For semiannual payments:

PV = S * (PVIFA(r, 40)) = 4000.

Similarly, for quarterly:

PV = Q * (PVIFA(r, 80)) = 4000.

But without knowing r, I can't find A, S, Q. So perhaps the question expects me to compare the annual cost for each payment mode, but I don't have a way to compute it without r.

Wait, maybe the question is assuming that the total payments made are the same in each mode. So, for annual, 20 payments of A. For semiannual, 20 payments of S, so total is 20A = 20S => A = S. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each payment's amount is the same, but the number of payments varies. But that can't be, because the total payments would differ.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think that the annual cost is the total amount paid each year, regardless of the payment frequency. So for annual, it's just one payment, so annual cost is that payment. For semiannual, two payments a year, so annual cost is 2*semiannual payment. Similarly, quarterly would be 4*quarterly payment.

But if that's the case, then the annual cost would be the same as the annual payment. Wait, no, that's not right. Because if you pay semiannually, each payment is less, but you pay twice, so annual cost is 2*(semi payment). Similarly for quarterly, 4*quarterly payment.

Wait, but if the total sum of all payments is the same, then:

Total payments = 20 * annual payment = 20 * A.

For semiannual, each semi payment is S, 20 * S over 10 years. So 20 S = 20 A => S = A. So annual cost is 2S = 2A.

But that would mean semiannual payments would have a higher annual cost than annual. Which conflicts with the options given.

Alternatively, maybe the total amount paid is the same. So 20A = 20S = 20Q (but that would require A=S=Q, which would make annual cost same as the sum of all payments per year. So annual would be A, semiannual 2S, quarterly 4Q. But if 20A=20S=20Q, then A=S=Q, so annual cost for semi would be 2A, quarterly 4A. So annual: A, semi: 2A, quarterly:4A. But this would mean the annual cost increases with more frequent payments, which I don't think is the case, and the options don't clearly show this.

Alternatively, perhaps each payment mode's total is different. For example, the policy's face is $4000, but the premiums are calculated with different payment frequencies, and each has a different present value.

Wait, perhaps the question is using net present value considerations. So for each payment mode, the present value of all payments equals the policy's face value.

Assuming an interest rate i, the present value of 20 annual payments A is:

PV_annual = A * (1 - (1 + i)^-20 ) / i = 4000.

Similarly, for semiannual payments S, 40 periods:

PV_semi = S * (1 - (1 + i/2)^-40 ) / (i/2) ) = 4000.

And for quarterly Q, 80 periods:

PV_quarter = Q * (1 - (1 + i/4)^-80 ) / (i/4) ) = 4000.

But without knowing i, I can't compute A, S, Q.

Wait, maybe the question is using standard actuarial formulas and expects you to know that more frequent payments result in lower annual premiums. So for example, annual payments have a higher annual cost than semiannual, which in turn are higher than quarterly. Looking at the options:

Option A: Annual higher than semi, which is lower than quarterly? No, in option A annual is 91.80, semi is 88.28, quarterly is 90.04. So semi is the lowest.

Option I: Annual 90.04, semi 91.80, quarterly 88.28. So here, quarterly is the lowest.

Hmm, but without knowing the interest rate, I can't say for sure. Alternatively, perhaps the payments are structured so that the annual cost is lower when paying more frequently because the present value is higher, so you can pay less.

Wait, let's consider that the present value of the payments equals the face value. So for annual, the present value is A * PVIFA(i,20) =4000.

For semiannual, each payment is S, and PVIFA(i/2,40)=4000/S.

Similarly, for quarterly, Q * PVIFA(i/4,80)=4000.

Since PVIFA increases as the number of periods increases (for the same i), more frequent payments (semi, quarterly) would have higher PVIFA, meaning lower S and Q. Wait, no, because PVIFA is in the denominator for calculating the payment.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the annual payment (A) is:

A = 4000 / PVIFA(i,20).

Similarly, S = 4000 / PVIFA(i/2,40).

And Q = 4000 / PVIFA(i/4,80).

Because PVIFA(i,20) < PVIFA(i/2,40) (since more periods and same i/2), the denominator is larger, so S is smaller than A. Similarly, Q is smaller than S, because PVIFA(i/4,80) is larger than PVIFA(i/2,40). So S < A and Q < S.

Wait, no, actually, for a given interest rate, the PVIFA increases as the number of periods increases, but when you halve the interest rate and double the periods, it's not straightforward.

Wait, for a given rate, the PVIFA increases as n increases. So for the same i, a higher n gives a higher PVIFA. But when you make payments more frequently, you're using a lower rate per period (i/2 for semiannual) but more periods (40 instead of 20). So the effect on PVIFA isn't immediately clear.

For example, let's say i=10% annually.

PVIFA(10%,20) = [1 - (1.1)^-20]/0.1 ≈ 8.9826.

PVIFA(5%,40) = [1 - (1.05)^-40]/0.05 ≈ 14.8775.

So for semiannual, the PVIFA is higher, meaning S =4000 /14.8775 ≈ 268.97.

For annual, A=4000 /8.9826 ≈ 445.95.

So in this case, A > S, which means annual payment is higher than semiannual. So the annual cost when paying semiannually is S*2 (since you pay twice a year) = 268.97 *2 ≈ 537.94. Wait, but that's higher than the annual payment of 445.95. That can't be right because paying more frequently should have a lower annual cost.

Wait, wait, no, I think I'm confusing the annual cost with the total present value. Maybe the annual cost in terms of out-of-pocket per year would be higher for more frequent payments. But in terms of the present value, the total is the same (4000).

Alternatively, perhaps the annual cost is the amount you pay each year, so for annual, it's A, for semi, 2S, for quarterly, 4Q.

In the example above, A=445.95, 2S=537.94, 4Q would be even higher. But this contradicts the idea that more frequent payments are cheaper.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Another approach: the equivalent annual payment when you make more frequent payments would be higher because you're paying more times a year. But the present value of those payments is the same.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to recognize that more frequent payments lead to lower annual costs because the insurer has the money for a shorter period. But without the interest rate, I can't compute exact numbers.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a standard table or formula that I'm supposed to know, like the annual cost factors for different payment modes.

Wait, perhaps the annual cost is calculated by taking the level premium for each payment frequency. For example, the annual premium would be higher when payments are made annually, lower when made semiannually, and even lower when quarterly.

Looking at the options, let's see. For instance, option A has annual at 91.80, semi at 88.28, and quarterly at 90.04. So semi is the lowest. Option I has annual at 90.04, semi at 91.80, quarterly at 88.28, which would mean quarterly is the lowest.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just look for the option where the semiannual payment is lower than annual, and quarterly is lower than annual but higher than semiannual.

Wait, in the earlier example with i=10%, the annual payment was A=445.95, semiannual S=268.97, so annual cost for semi would be 2S=537.94, which is higher than A. So that's not matching any of the options where semi is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the formulas wrong. Let me think again: the present value of the payments for each mode should equal the face value.

So for
