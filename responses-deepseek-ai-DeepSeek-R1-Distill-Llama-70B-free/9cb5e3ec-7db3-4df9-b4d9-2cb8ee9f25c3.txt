Okay, so I've got this problem here about Teddy's Auto Parts renting a warehouse. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The lease says Teddy has to pay an annual rent of $2 per square foot, plus taxes and insurance. The taxes are $12,000 a year, insurance is $400, and the warehouse is 62,500 square feet. I need to find the total cost for one year.

Hmm, so I think I should break this down into parts. First, calculate the rent based on the square footage, then add the taxes and insurance.

Let me start with the rent. The warehouse is 62,500 square feet, and the rent is $2 per sq ft. So that would be 62,500 multiplied by 2. Let me do that: 62,500 * 2. Oh, that's 125,000. So the base rent is $125,000 per year.

Next, I need to add the taxes and insurance. Taxes are $12,000 and insurance is $400. So adding those together: 12,000 + 400 = 12,400.

Wait, no, wait. Because the total cost is the sum of the rent, taxes, and insurance. So the total would be 125,000 (rent) + 12,000 (taxes) + 400 (insurance).

Let me add that up. 125,000 plus 12,000 is 137,000. Then add 400, so 137,400. So the total cost is $137,400.

Looking at the options, let me check. The options are labeled A through J. Option I is $137,400, which matches what I got. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 62,500 * 2 is indeed 125,000. Then 12,000 + 400 is 12,400. 125k plus 12.4k is 137.4k. Yep, that's correct. So I'm confident that I is the right answer.

The total annual cost is calculated by adding the base rent, taxes, and insurance. 

- **Base rent**: 62,500 square feet Ã— $2/square foot = $125,000  
- **Taxes**: $12,000  
- **Insurance**: $400  

Adding these together:  
$125,000 + $12,000 + $400 = $137,400  

The correct answer is **I: $137,400**.
