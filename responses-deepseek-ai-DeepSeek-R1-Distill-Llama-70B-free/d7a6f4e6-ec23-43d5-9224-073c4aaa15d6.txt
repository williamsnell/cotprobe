Okay, so I've got this question about when children start using certain memory strategies. The question is asking about the age range when kids begin to deliberately and regularly use rehearsal, elaboration, and organization as memory strategies. The options are from A to J, each with different age ranges.

Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that cognitive development in children includes the development of memory strategies. I think Piaget's theory talked about different stages, but maybe more relevant here is the information processing approach. I recall that children start using these strategies as they get older, around the time they enter school or a bit later.

Wait, rehearsal is like repeating information to remember it, right? I think that's one of the earlier strategies. Elaboration involves making connections or associations to help remember, and organization is about structuring information, like categorizing. 

I think that younger children might not use these strategies because their metacognitive abilities aren't developed yet. Metacognition is the awareness of one's own cognitive processes. So, using strategies on purpose requires that awareness. 

I remember that around early elementary school age, maybe around 7 or 8, children start to use rehearsal. But when do they start using all three—rehearsal, elaboration, and organization—regularly? 

Let me think. Rehearsal starts early, maybe around 5-7. But the question is about using all three strategies deliberately. So perhaps a bit older. I think it's around 10 years old. Wait, maybe when they're a bit older, like 9-10 or 10-12. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think the spontaneous use of these strategies comes in later. Like, children under 8 might not use them unless taught. So the deliberate and regular use probably starts around 10-12 years old. So looking at the options, D is 10-12 and H is 9-10. 

But I also read somewhere that by about 7-8 years, kids can use some strategies, but maybe not all three together. Maybe the average is around 10. So the correct answer would be D:10-12.

Wait, another thought: the age when they can effectively use these strategies without prompting is around early adolescence. So maybe it's 11-12, but that's option F. Or perhaps 13-15, which is option C. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, considering that the question includes all three strategies, maybe it's when they're a bit older, like early teens. Or maybe 9-10? I'm a bit unsure, but I think the commonly accepted age is around 10-12. So I'll go with D.

The question asks when children begin to deliberately and regularly use rehearsal, elaboration, and organization as memory strategies. These strategies involve metacognitive abilities, which develop as children grow older. Rehearsal is an earlier strategy, often starting around 5-7 years, but the deliberate use of all three strategies together likely begins later. 

Research suggests that children typically start using these strategies spontaneously and effectively around 10-12 years of age, as their cognitive and metacognitive abilities mature. This aligns with the developmental progression of memory strategies, where younger children may not use all three strategies consistently without prompting. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

D: 10 to 12

Answer: D
