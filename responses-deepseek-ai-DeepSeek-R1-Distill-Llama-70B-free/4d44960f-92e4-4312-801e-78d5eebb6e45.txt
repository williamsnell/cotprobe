Okay, so I have this problem where I'm supposed to find the forced current in a series RC circuit with a voltage source. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the voltage source is given as 60cos(1000t) volts. The resistor is 2 kΩ, which is 2000 ohms, and the capacitor is 1 microfarad. I remember that in AC circuits, we deal with impedance, which combines resistance and reactance.

So the circuit is a series combination of a resistor and a capacitor. The current in such a circuit can be found using Ohm's law for AC, which is I = V/Z, where Z is the impedance.

Impedance Z for an RC circuit is given by the formula Z = sqrt(R² + (Xc)^2), where Xc is the capacitive reactance. Xc is calculated as 1/(ωC), where ω is the angular frequency.

Let me calculate ω first. The given voltage has a frequency term of 1000t, so ω is 1000 rad/s.

Now, Xc = 1/(ωC) = 1/(1000 * 1e-6). Let me compute that. 1000 times 1e-6 is 0.001, so 1/0.001 is 1000 ohms. So Xc is 1000 ohms.

Next, the impedance Z is sqrt(R² + Xc²). R is 2000, so R squared is 4,000,000. Xc squared is 1,000,000. Adding those gives 5,000,000. The square root of 5 million is approximately 2236 ohms. Wait, let me compute that more accurately. sqrt(5e6) is sqrt(5)*1e3, which is about 2.236e3, which is 2236 ohms.

But wait, maybe I can express it as 2000*sqrt(5/4) or something? Hmm, perhaps not necessary. Anyway, the magnitude of Z is sqrt(2000² + 1000²) = sqrt(4e6 + 1e6) = sqrt(5e6) = 1000*sqrt(5) ohms, which is approximately 2236 ohms.

Now, the current's magnitude I can be found by I = V_max / Z. V_max is 60 volts. So I = 60 / 2236. Let me compute that. 60 divided by 2236 is approximately 0.0268 amperes, which is 26.8 mA. Let me double-check: 2236 * 0.0268 is indeed about 60 V. So the peak current is about 26.8 mA.

But wait, the options are all in terms of cosine and sine terms, implying the current is expressed in terms of its real and imaginary components, perhaps as a phasor.

In a series RC circuit, the current leads the voltage because the capacitor's voltage lags. So the phase angle θ is given by θ = arctan(Xc / R). Since Xc is 1000 and R is 2000, the ratio is 0.5. So θ = arctan(0.5), which is approximately 26.565 degrees. But since the current leads the voltage, the phase angle in the current would be positive relative to the voltage.

Alternatively, in phasor form, the current I can be expressed as I0 cos(1000t + θ) or in terms of cosine and sine components. But since the voltage is given as 60cos(1000t), the current will have components in both cosine and sine terms of the same frequency.

The phasor for V is 60 ∠0°, and the phasor for I is V divided by Z, which has a magnitude of 60/(1000√5) and a phase angle θ relative to V. Wait, actually the impedance Z has a phase angle of arctan(Xc / R). Wait, no, since it's a capacitor, the impedance is R - jXc. So the phase angle φ of Z is arctan(-Xc/R), which is negative. So the impedance angle is -φ, where φ is arctan(Xc/R) = arctan(0.5) ≈ 26.565°. So the impedance has an angle of -26.565°, meaning the current will lead the voltage by that angle.

So the current phasor I is (60/(1000√5)) ∠26.565°.

Alternatively, the current can be written as I = I_magnitude [ cos(1000t) cos(θ) + sin(1000t) sin(θ) ].

Wait, no, in terms of the current, it's I = I_max cos(1000t + θ), but when expanded, that's I_max [cos(1000t) cosθ - sin(1000t) sinθ]. But let me make sure about the signs.

Wait, since the impedance is Z = R - jXc. So the current phasor I = V / Z, which is (60 ∠0) / (R - jXc).

Let me compute this. Let me represent Z as R - j Xc = 2000 - j1000.

The polar form of Z is magnitude sqrt(2000^2 +1000^2) = 2236 Ω, as we found earlier. The angle is arctan(-1000/2000) = arctan(-0.5) = -26.565 degrees.

So I = V / Z = (60 ∠0) / (2236 ∠-26.565) ) = (60/2236) ∠(0 - (-26.565)) ) = (approx 0.0268) ∠26.565 degrees.

So the current I has a magnitude of about 26.8 mA and a phase angle of 26.565 degrees leading the voltage.

Expressed as a cosine function with phase, that's I = 26.8 cos(1000t + 26.565°).

But the question gives options in terms of cosine and sine terms. Let me expand this using the cosine addition formula.

I = I_m [ cos(1000t) cosθ - sin(1000t) sinθ ]

Wait, wait. Because cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. So yes, that's correct.

So I can write I as I_m cosθ cos(1000t) - I_m sinθ sin(1000t).

So the coefficients for cos and sin terms would be I_m cosθ and -I_m sinθ.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute I_m first. I_m is 60 / Z. Since Z is 1000√5, I_m is 60/(1000√5) = 60/(2236) ≈ 0.0268 A, which is 26.8 mA.

So I_m is approximately 26.8 mA.

Now, cosθ is cos(26.565°). What's cos(26.565)? Let me think. Since tanθ = 0.5, which corresponds to a 26.565° angle. So, in a right triangle where the opposite side is 1, adjacent is 2, hypotenuse is sqrt(1 +4) = sqrt(5). So cosθ is adjacent/hypotenuse = 2/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.8944. Similarly, sinθ is 1/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.4472.

So, I_m cosθ = 26.8 mA * 0.8944 ≈ let's compute. 26.8 * 0.8944. 26 * 0.8944 is about 23.25, and 0.8 * 0.8944 ≈ 0.7155. So together, approximately 23.25 + 0.7155 = 23.9655, let's say 24.0 mA.

Similarly, I_m sinθ = 26.8 * 0.4472 ≈ let's calculate this. 26 * 0.4472 is 11.627, and 0.8 * 0.4472 ≈ 0.3578. So total is 11.627 + 0.3578 ≈ 11.9848, approximately 12 mA.

So putting it together, the current is (24.0 cos1000t) - (12 sin1000t) mA.

Wait, because the formula is I_m cosθ cos(1000t) - I_m sinθ sin(1000t). So the coefficients are 24 mA (approx) for cos, and -12 mA for sin.

Looking at the options, option B is i_forced=24cos1000t -12 sin1000tmA. Option I is 26cos… but our approximate calculation gives 24 and 12.

But wait, I used approximations. Let me compute more accurately.

I_m is 60/(1000√5) = (60/1000)/√5 = 0.06 / 2.23607 ≈ 0.0268 A, which is 26.8 mA.

cosθ = 2/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.89443.

So I_m cosθ = 26.8 * 0.89443 = let's compute:

26 * 0.89443 = 23.255, 0.8 * 0.89443 = 0.71554. So 23.255 + 0.71554 ≈ 23.9705 mA, so approximately 24 mA.

Similarly, sinθ = 1/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.44721.

I_m sinθ = 26.8 * 0.44721 ≈ 26 * 0.44721 is 11.6275, 0.8 * 0.44721 is 0.35777. Adding gives 11.6275 + 0.35777 = 11.98527, approximately 12 mA.

So the current becomes (24 cos1000t) - (12 sin1000t) mA, which matches option B.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because I'm worried I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate I_m:

V_max is 60 V, Z is sqrt(2000² + 1000²) = sqrt(4e6 + 1e6) = sqrt(5e6) = 1000√5 ≈ 2236 ohms.

So I_m = 60 / (1000√5) = (60/1000)/√5 = 0.06 / 2.23607 ≈ 0.0268 A = 26.8 mA. That's correct.

Then, cosθ is 2/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.8944, so 26.8 * 0.8944 ≈ let's compute 26.8 * 0.8944.

Compute 26 * 0.8944: 20*0.8944 is 17.888, 6*0.8944 is 5.3664, so total 23.2544.

0.8 * 0.8944 is 0.71552.

So 23.2544 + 0.71552 = 23.96996, which is approximately 24.0 mA.

Similarly, sinθ is 1/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.4472.

26.8 * 0.4472 = 26 *0.4472 = 11.6272, 0.8 *0.4472=0.35776. Sum is 11.98496, about 12.0 mA.

Thus, the current is 24 cos1000t -12 sin1000t mA, which is option B.

But wait, another approach: maybe using phasor notation and current as a function.

The voltage is V = 60 cos(1000t) V.

The impedance Z = R - jXc = 2000 - j1000.

Expressed in polar form, Z has magnitude sqrt(2000^2 +1000^2) = sqrt(5e6) = 1000√5, angle arctan(-1000/2000) = arctan(-0.5) = -26.565 degrees.

So the current phasor I = V / Z = (60 ∠0) / (1000√5 ∠-26.565) ) = (60/(1000√5)) ∠(26.565) degrees.

So in terms of cosine and sine,

I = (60/(1000√5)) [ cos(26.565) cos(1000t) - sin(26.565) sin(1000t) ]

Which again gives the same coefficients.

So I think option B is correct. So the answer should be option B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the series RC circuit with a voltage source \( V = 60\cos(1000t) \, \text{V} \), a resistor \( R = 2000 \, \Omega \), and a capacitor \( C = 1 \, \mu\text{F} \). The goal is to find the forced current \( i_{\text{forced}} \) in the circuit.

### Step 1: Impedance Calculation
The impedance \( Z \) of the circuit is given by:
\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X_c^2}
\]
where \( X_c = \frac{1}{\omega C} \) is the capacitive reactance. The angular frequency \( \omega \) is \( 1000 \, \text{rad/s} \), so:
\[
X_c = \frac{1}{1000 \cdot 1 \times 10^{-6}} = 1000 \, \Omega
\]
Substituting \( R = 2000 \, \Omega \) and \( X_c = 1000 \, \Omega \), the impedance becomes:
\[
Z = \sqrt{2000^2 + 1000^2} = \sqrt{4 \times 10^6 + 1 \times 10^6} = \sqrt{5 \times 10^6} = 1000\sqrt{5} \, \Omega
\]

### Step 2: Current Magnitude
Using Ohm's law for AC circuits, the current magnitude is:
\[
I_m = \frac{V_m}{Z} = \frac{60}{1000\sqrt{5}} = \frac{0.06}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 0.0268 \, \text{A} = 26.8 \, \text{mA}
\]

### Step 3: Phase Angle
The phase angle \( \theta \) between the current and the voltage is given by:
\[
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{X_c}{R}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{1000}{2000}\right) = \arctan(0.5) \approx 26.565^\circ
\]
Since the current leads the voltage in a series RC circuit, the phase angle is positive.

### Step 4: Current Expression
The forced current can be expressed as:
\[
i_{\text{forced}} = I_m \cos(1000t + \theta)
\]
Expanding this using the cosine addition formula:
\[
i_{\text{forced}} = I_m \cos\theta \cos(1000t) - I_m \sin\theta \sin(1000t)
\]
Substituting \( \cos\theta = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \) and \( \sin\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \):
\[
i_{\text{forced}} = (I_m \cos\theta) \cos(1000t) - (I_m \sin\theta) \sin(1000t)
\]
\[
i_{\text{forced}} = (26.8 \cdot 0.8944) \cos(1000t) - (26.8 \cdot 0.4472) \sin(1000t)
\]
\[
i_{\text{forced}} = 24 \cos(1000t) - 12 \sin(1000t) \, \text{mA}
\]

### Step 5: Matching the Options
From the above derivation, the forced current is:
\[
i_{\text{forced}} = 24 \cos(1000t) - 12 \sin(1000t) \, \text{mA}
\]
This matches **Option B**.

### Final Answer:
B
