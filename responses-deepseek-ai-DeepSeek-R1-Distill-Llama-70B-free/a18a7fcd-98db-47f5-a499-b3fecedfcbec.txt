Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the carrying charge for a television set bought on an installment plan. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the problem states the cash price is $525. So that's the price if you pay all at once. But the person is paying in installments, which means there's a down payment and monthly payments. Oh right, the carrying charge is the extra amount you pay when you don't pay cash upfront. It's like the interest or the fee for paying over time.

The down payment is $75. So that's the initial amount paid right away. Then there are twelve monthly payments of $42.75 each. I need to find out the total amount paid under the installment plan and then subtract the cash price to get the carrying charge.

Let me jot down the numbers:

- Cash price = $525
- Down payment = $75
- Monthly payment = $42.75
- Number of months = 12

So first, calculate the total of the monthly payments. That's 12 multiplied by $42.75. Let me do that multiplication. 42.75 times 12... Hmm, 40*12 is 480, and 2.75*12 is 33. So 480 +33=513. So the monthly payments total $513.

Then add the down payment to that. $513 + $75 = $588. So the total amount paid under the installment plan is $588.

Now, the carrying charge would be the total paid minus the cash price. Because the cash price is what you would have paid without the installment plan. So $588 - $525 = $63.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. 12 * 42.75. Let me compute that again. 42.75 * 12. Let's break it down: 42 * 12 is 504, and 0.75 *12 is 9. So 504 +9=513. Yep, that's correct.

Adding the down payment: 513 +75=588. Correct.

So then the carrying charge is 588-525=63. So the answer should be G: $63.

But wait, I should make sure I didn't miss anything. Sometimes carrying charge might be calculated differently, but I think in this context, it's just the difference between the total installment payments (including down) and the cash price. Yeah, that makes sense because the carrying charge is the extra cost for the financing.

To calculate the carrying charge for the television set, we first determine the total amount paid under the installment plan. This includes the down payment and the sum of all monthly payments.

- **Cash price**: $525  
- **Down payment**: $75  
- **Monthly payment**: $42.75  
- **Number of payments**: 12  

The total monthly payments are calculated as:  
\[
12 \times 42.75 = 513
\]  

Adding the down payment:  
\[
513 + 75 = 588
\]  

The carrying charge is the difference between the total amount paid under the installment plan and the cash price:  
\[
588 - 525 = 63
\]  

Thus, the carrying charge is **$63**, corresponding to option **G**.
