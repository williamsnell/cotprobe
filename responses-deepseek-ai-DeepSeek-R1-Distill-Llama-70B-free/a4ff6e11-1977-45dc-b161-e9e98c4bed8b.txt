Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the rest mass of a particle. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, the rest mass is related to the total energy and momentum. The formula I think is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Oh wait, but wait, the units here might be in GeV and GeV/c, so maybe I don't have to worry about the constants too much.

So the energy given is 5.0 GeV, and the momentum is 4.9 GeV/c. I need to find the rest mass m. Let me plug these into the formula.

Wait, the formula is E squared equals (pc)^2 plus (m c squared)^2. But when I plug in the values, I have to make sure the units are consistent. But since the momentum is given in GeV/c, when I multiply by c, the units would be GeV. So the term (pc) would just be 4.9 GeV.

So the equation becomes (5.0)^2 = (4.9)^2 + (m c²)^2. Wait no, because E is 5 GeV, which is the total energy, and the rest mass energy would be m c². So I think E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So solving for m c².

Let me compute the numbers:

E² = 5.0^2 = 25.

(pc)^2 = (4.9)^2 ≈ 24.01.

So m c² squared is E² minus (pc)^2. So that's 25 - 24.01 = 0.99. Taking the square root, m c² is sqrt(0.99) ≈ 0.995 GeV.

Wait, but the options are in GeV/c². Oh right, because m c² has units of GeV, but m is in GeV/c². So m c² is 0.995 GeV, which means m is 0.995 GeV/c². Looking at the options, let's see.

Option C is 0.5 GeV/c², D is 1.0, J is 0.2. Wait, 0.995 is close to 1.0, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's recalculate the squares correctly. 5^2 is 25. 4.9 squared is 24.01. So 25 -24.01 is 0.99. Square root of 0.99 is approximately 0.995, so m c² is about 1 GeV, which would mean m is 1 GeV/c². So that would be option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I forget any factors? Because the formula I used is correct for when E is the total energy. Yeah, I think that's right. So the correct answer should be D: 1.0 GeV/c².

To determine the rest mass of the particle, we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2
\]

Here:
- \(E = 5.0 \, \text{GeV}\) (total energy),
- \(p = 4.9 \, \text{GeV/c}\) (momentum),
- \(m c^2\) is the rest energy of the particle.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(m c^2\):

\[
m c^2 = \sqrt{E^2 - (pc)^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
m c^2 = \sqrt{5.0^2 - 4.9^2} = \sqrt{25 - 24.01} = \sqrt{0.99} \approx 0.995 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Since \(m c^2 \approx 1.0 \, \text{GeV}\), the rest mass \(m\) is approximately:

\[
m \approx 1.0 \, \text{GeV/c}^2
\]

From the options provided, the closest match is **D: 1.0 GeV/c²**.
