Okay, so I have this question about who was the first American in space. I'm a bit rusty on my space history, but let me think through it. The options are A through J, with various astronauts listed.

First, I remember that Yuri Gagarin was the first human in space, but he was Soviet, not American. So option B is out because he's the first overall but not American.

Then, the first American... I think it was someone named Alan Shepard. Wait, but I also recall that some of the early astronauts were part of the Mercury program. Let me try to remember the order. I think Alan Shepard was the first, but then John Glenn might have been the first to orbit Earth.

Wait, so Shepard was the first American in space, but his flight was a suborbital one, meaning he didn't go all the way around the Earth. John Glenn was the first American to orbit the Earth. So the question is about the first in space, not necessarily orbiting.

So looking at the options, J is Alan Shepard. H is John Glenn. So the answer should be J.

But let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. I think Shepard's flight was in 1961, like May 5th. That was the Mercury-Redstone 4 mission, I believe. Then Glenn's was in 1962, the first orbital flight.

So the first American in space was Alan Shepard. So the correct answer is J.

The first American in space was Alan Shepard, who flew aboard the Mercury-Redstone 4 mission on May 5, 1961. This was a suborbital flight, making him the first American to reach space.
