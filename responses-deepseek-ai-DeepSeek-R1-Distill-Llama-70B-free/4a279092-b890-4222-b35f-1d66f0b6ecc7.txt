Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electron diffraction. Hmm, I remember that electrons have wave-like properties, and their wavelength is related to their momentum. Oh right, the de Broglie wavelength! The formula is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the electron.

The question is asking for the speed of an electron when its wavelength is 100 picometers. Wait, 100 pm is really small. I need to convert that into meters because the units in the answer options are in meters per second. So 100 pm is 100e-12 meters, which is 1e-10 m.

I remember the de Broglie equation: λ = h / (m*v), where m is the mass of the electron and v is its velocity. Or wait, sometimes it's written as λ = h / p, and since p is m*v, yeah, same thing.

So I can rearrange the equation to solve for velocity. v = h / (m * λ).

I think Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The mass of an electron is about 9.11e-31 kg. Let me plug these into the formula.

So v = (6.626e-34) / (9.11e-31 kg * 1e-10 m). Let me compute the denominator first. 9.11e-31 times 1e-10 is 9.11e-41 kg·m. Wait, no, wait. Because the denominator is m*λ, which is kg times meters? Oh wait, no, wait: m is mass, λ is in meters. So m*λ would have units kg·m? But in the denominator, it's m*λ, so the units would be kg·m. Hmm, but the numerator is in J·s which is kg·m²/s. So when I divide, I get (kg·m²/s) / (kg·m) ) = m/s, which is velocity. That makes sense.

Calculating the denominator: 9.11e-31 * 1e-10 = 9.11e-41 kg·m. Then numerator is 6.626e-34. So 6.626e-34 divided by 9.11e-41 equals... Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 / 9.11e-41 = (6.626 / 9.11) * 1e7 (since 1e-34 / 1e-41 is 1e7). Let me calculate 6.626 divided by 9.11. Hmm, 6.626 ÷ 9 is about 0.736. But 9.11 is a bit more than 9, so maybe around 0.726 or so.

0.726 times 1e7 is 7.26e6 m/s. Let me double-check that division. 9.11 times 0.726 equals approximately 9.11 * 0.7 is 6.377, 9.11 * 0.026 is about 0.237, so total around 6.614. Which is close to 6.626, so that seems right.

Looking at the options, option F is 7.27e6 m/s, which is close to my calculation. Wait, but wait, I thought my calculation was about 7.26e6. Option F is 7.27e6, which is almost exactly that. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, wait, let me do the exact calculation. 6.626e-34 divided by (9.11e-31 kg * 1e-10 m) = 6.626e-34 / (9.11e-41) kg·m. So 6.626 / 9.11 = let's compute that accurately.

6.626 ÷ 9.11. Let me do this division step by step. 9.11 * 0.726 = let's see:

9.11 * 0.7 = 6.377
9.11 * 0.02 = 0.1822
9.11 * 0.006 = 0.05466
Adding these: 6.377 + 0.1822 = 6.5592 + 0.05466 = 6.61386. 

So 0.726 gives us 6.61386, which is a bit less than 6.626. The difference is about 6.626 - 6.61386 = 0.01214. How much more do I need?

So 0.01214 / 9.11 ≈ 0.00133, so 0.726 + 0.00133 ≈ 0.7273.

So 6.626 / 9.11 ≈ 0.7273. So 0.7273e7 m/s is 7.273e6 m/s. So approximately 7.27e6, which is exactly option F.

So the correct answer is F.

To determine the speed of an electron with a wavelength of \( 100 \, \mathrm{pm} \), we use the de Broglie equation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{m v}
\]

Rearranging for \( v \), the velocity:

\[
v = \frac{h}{m \lambda}
\]

Here:
- \( \lambda = 100 \, \mathrm{pm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \),
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (mass of the electron).

Substituting these values:

\[
v = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 1 \times 10^{-10}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 1 \times 10^{-10} = 9.11 \times 10^{-41}
\]

Now divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
v = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{9.11 \times 10^{-41}} = \frac{6.626}{9.11} \times 10^7
\]

Performing the division \( \frac{6.626}{9.11} \):

\[
\frac{6.626}{9.11} \approx 0.7273
\]

Thus:

\[
v \approx 0.7273 \times 10^7 = 7.27 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m/s}
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is:

**F: \( 7.27 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m/s} \)**.
