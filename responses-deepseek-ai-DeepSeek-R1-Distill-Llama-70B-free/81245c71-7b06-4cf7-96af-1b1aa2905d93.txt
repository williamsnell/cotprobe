Okay, so I've got this question about Mill and utilitarianism. Hmm, I remember that Mill was a big advocate for utilitarianism, but the question is about an objection to it. The question is asking what Mill considered one of the strongest objections drawn from.

The options are A through J. Let's see. I think the objection is related to justice. Because utilitarianism is about the greatest good for the greatest number, but sometimes that can conflict with what's just for individuals. Like, maybe sacrificing one person for the greater good, which doesn't seem fair.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is supererogation, which I think refers to actions that are beyond the call of duty, like heroic acts. But I don't recall Mill focusing much on that as a main objection.

Justice makes more sense because it's a common criticism. Utilitarianism can lead to situations where the rights or just treatment of individuals are overlooked for the majority's benefit. So Mill would address that by discussing justice as a significant issue.

So the answer should be A: justice.

The strongest objection to utilitarianism, as noted by Mill, is drawn from the idea of justice. Utilitarianism's focus on the greatest good for the greatest number can sometimes conflict with individual justice and fairness. Mill acknowledges this criticism, recognizing that justice is a fundamental concern that utilitarianism must address.
