Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the scenario is an explorer who found an abandoned car with 5 liters of gasoline. The question is about how much water he could produce by burning the fuel. The reaction given is C7H16(l) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(g). So, I need to calculate the amount of water produced.

First, I remember that gasoline is composed of C7H16 molecules. The density is given as 0.67 g/cm³. Hmm, I think I'll need to find out how many moles of C7H16 are in 5 liters of gasoline.

Wait, 5 liters is the volume, and density is mass per volume. So mass equals density times volume. Oh right, 5 liters is 5000 cm³ because 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So mass is 0.67 g/cm³ * 5000 cm³. Let me calculate that: 0.67 *5000 = 3350 grams. So the mass of gasoline is 3350 g.

Next, I need to find the molar mass of C7H16 to find out how many moles that is. Carbon is about 12 g/mol, so 7 *12 is 84. Hydrogen is about 1 g/mol, so 16 *1 is 16. So total molar mass is 84 +16 = 100 g/mol. 

So moles of C7H16 = mass / molar mass = 3350 g / 100 g/mol = 33.5 moles.

Now the chemical equation: C7H16 + 11 O2 → 7 CO2 + 8 H2O. Wait, I think the balanced equation... Let me check. C7H16 has 7 C and 16 H. So for CO2, each CO2 takes one C, so 7 CO2. For H2O, each H2O has two H, so 16 H would need 8 H2O. So the balanced equation would be C7H16 + 11 O2 →7 CO2 + 8 H2O. So, for each mole of C7H16, we get 8 moles of H2O.

So moles of H2O would be 8 * 33.5 = 268 moles.

Now I need to find the volume of that water. But wait, water could be in different states. The reaction produces H2O(g), but when the explorer traps it, would it condense into liquid? I think in this context, they might be considering liquid water because you can't trap gas easily. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's just a matter of calculating the amount in any form.

Wait, the problem says "how many liters of water could he produce". So, I think they're asking for the mass because water as a gas would have a much larger volume, but in liquid form, it's more practical. Or perhaps it's a trick question because the product is a gas, but maybe it's about the volume of the gas under certain conditions.

But let me think. The question says "liters of water", so that's volume. But if it's gas, under standard conditions, what's the volume? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, the product is H2O(g), but perhaps the problem expects me to consider it as liquid because that's the usable form. Alternatively, perhaps I'm to calculate the mass of water produced. Because if the options include grams (like options A, B, H, I), then maybe the answer is in grams.

Wait, looking at the options: A is 603 g, B is 3350 g, C is 5000 cc (which is 5 liters), D is 45, F is 5. H is 12,060 g, I is 850g.

Wait, the problem says "liters of water", so that's volume. So perhaps I'm to calculate the volume of water in liquid form. But then I need to find the mass of water first and then convert to volume.

Wait, let's think again. The moles of H2O are 268 moles. Molar mass of H2O is (2*1 + 16) = 18 g/mol. So mass of H2O is 268 *18 = 4824 grams. Hmm, looking at the options, I don't see an option that's 4824 g. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the volume of H2O as a gas, but under standard temperature and pressure. At STP, one mole of gas is 22.4 liters. So 268 moles would be 268 *22.4 L. 268 *22.4 is approximately 6002 liters. But that's way more than any of the options. So D is 45 liters, F is 5, G is 67. So none of these match. So perhaps that's not the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the water is in liquid form. So the mass is 4824 grams, which is 4.824 kg. The density of water is about 1 g/cm³, so 4824 grams would be 4.824 liters. But looking at the options, I don't see that either. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check again. The reaction is C7H16 + 11 O2 →7 CO2 + 8 H2O. So for each mole of C7H16, 8 moles H2O are formed. So 33.5 *8 = 268 moles H2O. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the volume but the mass. So 268 moles *18g/mol=4824g. But looking at the options, option H is 12,060g, which is higher. Option B is 3350g, which is the mass of gasoline. So none of the options match 4824g. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is about the amount of water produced being in gaseous form, but under standard conditions, but perhaps the question is about the theoretical maximum, ignoring the state. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the volume in liters as a gas, but perhaps at a different pressure or something else.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Maybe the problem is expecting just the amount in moles or grams, not liters. Let me look at the options again. Option E is 7 moles, which is much less than 268. Hmm, perhaps I did something wrong earlier.

Wait, wait. Let's go back. The mass of gasoline is 5 liters * 0.67 g/cm³. 5 liters is 5000 cm³. 0.67 *5000 = 3350 grams. Molar mass of C7H16 is 7*(12) +16*(1) = 84+16=100 g/mol. So moles of C7H16 is 3350 /100 =33.5 moles. Then 33.5 *8 = 268 moles of H2O. So that's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check the balanced equation again.

The unbalanced equation is C7H16 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

Balancing carbons: 7 on the left, so 7 CO2 on the right.

Hydrogen: 16 H in C7H16, so 8 H2O (since each H2O has 2 H, 8*2=16).

Oxygen: On the right, CO2 has 7*2=14 O, and H2O has 8*1=8 O. So total O is 22. So the left side needs 11 O2 molecules because each O2 has 2 O atoms. So 11 O2 → 22 O.

So the balanced equation is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem isn't considering all the oxygen needed, but I don't think that's the case. The problem says to assume complete combustion.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the volume of gasoline, but I think that's just the initial condition. No, the question is about the water produced.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the water is a liquid, so its volume is mass divided by density. So 4824 grams of H2O is 4824 cm³, which is 4.824 liters. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 5000 cc, which is 5 liters. But that's exactly the volume of gasoline. So that can't be. Option D is 45 liters, which could be if I miscalculated the moles. Wait, perhaps I should have used a different molar volume. Wait, maybe the reaction produces CO2 and H2O as gases and perhaps the volume is the sum, but the question is only about water.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the amount in grams, not liters. Let me look at the options again. Option B is 3350g, which is the same as the gasoline's mass. Option H is 12060g, which is more than double the gasoline. Option I is 850g. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles of C7H16.

Wait, 5 liters of gasoline is 5000 cm³. Density is 0.67 g/cm³. So mass is 0.67 *5000 = 3350 grams. Molar mass is 100 g/mol. So 3350 /100=33.5 moles. That's correct.

So 33.5 moles *8=268 moles of H2O. 268 *18=4824 grams. Hmm, 4824 grams is 4.824 kg. So 4.824 liters as liquid. The options don't have that. But wait, option B is 3350g. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake of a factor of 100 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the density of gasoline differently, but I think that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the volume of water vapor at the same conditions as the gasoline. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about using the volume in liters as a gas at STP.

Wait, 268 moles *22.4 L/mol at STP would be 268 *22.4 = let's calculate that. 268 *20 is 5360, 268*2.4=643.2, so total 6003.2 liters. But that's not any of the options. So that can't be.

Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the volume of water in liters as a liquid. So 4824 grams divided by 1 g/cm³ (density of water) is 4824 cm³, which is 4.824 liters. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometric ratio. Let me double-check. The balanced equation is C7H16 +11 O2 →7 CO2 +8 H2O. So 1 mole of C7H16 gives 8 moles H2O. So 33.5 *8=268. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the volume of the gasoline, but that's 5 liters. Option F is 5 liters, but that's the fuel, not the water. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the H2O produced from the hydrogen in the gasoline, so without considering combustion of carbon. But that doesn't make sense because the reaction includes both CO2 and H2O.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the volume of gasoline, but that's unrelated. No, the question is about water.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 5 liters, but that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the volume of CO2 produced, but the question is about water.

Wait, maybe I should look for the mass of water. So 4824 grams, which is 4.824 kg. But the options don't have that. The options are A:603g, B:3350g, H:12,060g.

Wait, 3350g is the mass of gasoline. So perhaps the water can't be more than that, but 4824g is more. So perhaps that's not in the options, which suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the gasoline is 5 liters, but the density is 0.67 g/cm³, so the mass is 5 * 0.67 *1000 cm³? No, wait, 5 liters is 5000 cm³, so 5000 *0.67=3350g. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the maximum mass of water. 33.5 moles of C7H16 gives 268 moles H2O, which is 268 *18=4824g. But none of the options have that. So perhaps the question is intended to consider the volume as a gas, but perhaps at a different temperature and pressure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the volume of the fuel, but that's 5 liters.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. Option B is 3350g, which is the mass of the gasoline. So perhaps the question is a trick, but I don't think so. Another thought: perhaps the water is produced as a gas, and the volume is calculated at the same temperature and pressure as the gasoline was burned. But that would require additional information, which isn't given.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for how much water can be produced from the hydrogen in the gasoline, but that's the same as we calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the volume in liters of gasoline. No, that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the volume of H2O in the same state as gasoline. But gasoline is a liquid, and H2O is a gas in the reaction. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the volume of gasoline, but that's 5 liters. So that's option F.

But the question is about water, not gasoline. So I'm confused. Unless perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometric calculation.

Wait, perhaps the balanced equation uses 2 moles of H2O instead of 8. No, that's not right. Let's recount:

C7H16 has 16 H atoms. Each H2O has 2 H, so 16/2=8 H2O per C7H16. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is in grams, but none of the options match 4824g. The closest option is B:3350g, which is the mass of gasoline. So perhaps the question is a trick, but I don't see how.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction equation is incomplete. Let me check the problem statement again. It says C7H16(l) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(g). So it's a complete combustion reaction, so the stoichiometry should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the volume of water produced as a gas, but in that case, under standard conditions, it's over 6000 liters, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass of C7H16. Let me recalculate. 7 carbons: 7 *12.01 = 84.07 g. 16 hydrogens: 16 *1.008=16.128 g. So total molar mass is 84.07 +16.128=100.198 g/mol, approximately 100.2 g/mol. So 3350g /100.2 g/mol ≈33.39 moles. So H2O is 33.39 *8=267.12 moles. So 267.12 *18.015 g/mol ≈4812g. Still, no option matches that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to report the volume of water in liters, but as a liquid. So 4812 grams /1g/cm³ is 4812 cm³=4.812 liters. So about 4.8 liters. But the options don't have that. The closest option is F:5 liters, but that's the gasoline. So perhaps that's a possible intended answer, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the volume of CO2 produced, but the question is about water. So that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo. Let me check the options again. Option C is 5000 cc, which is 5 liters. So perhaps the intended answer is 5 liters, but that doesn't make sense because that's the gasoline.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the volume of water to be the same as the gasoline, but that would ignore the stoichiometry and densities.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that each mole of C7H16 gives 8 moles of H2O, which is 8 *18 =144 grams per mole of C7H16. So 33.5 moles *144g= 33.5 *144. Let's calculate that: 30*144=4320, 3.5*144=504, total 4824g. Same as before.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 3350g, which is option B, but that's the mass of gasoline. That doesn't make sense because the water should be more than the gasoline in mass? Wait, gasoline is 3350g, and water is 4824g, which is more. So perhaps the intended answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial mass calculation. Let me check: 5 liters is 5000 cm³. 0.67g/cm³ *5000=3350g. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is considering only the mass of water produced in grams, but 4824g isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed. But that's not possible in a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other possible approaches. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of C7H16 produces 8 moles of H2O, so in terms of volume, perhaps using molar volume at STP. So 8 *22.4 L per mole of C7H16. So 33.5 * 8 *22.4 L. Wait, that's 33.5 * 179.2 L
