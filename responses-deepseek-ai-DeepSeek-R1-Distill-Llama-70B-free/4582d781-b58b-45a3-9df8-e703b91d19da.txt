Okay, so I've got this problem here about a grocery store selling lemons. Let me read it again. A bag of 5 lemons costs $2.00. I need to find the unit cost per lemon. Hmm, unit cost is just the cost per one item, right?

Alright, so the total cost is $2.00 for 5 lemons. To find the cost per lemon, I should divide the total cost by the number of lemons. That makes sense because if each lemon is the same price, dividing the total by the count gives me the price per unit.

So, let's do the math. $2.00 divided by 5. Hmm, 2 divided by 5. Let me think, 5 times 0.4 is 2 because 5 times 0.4 is 2.0. So 2 divided by 5 equals 0.4. So each lemon would cost $0.40.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes I confuse division with multiplication. Let me double-check. If one lemon is $0.40, then 5 lemons would be 5 times 0.40, which is 5 * 0.4 = 2.00. Yep, that matches the total cost given. So that checks out.

Looking at the options, option G is $0.40. So that must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The question didn't mention any discounts or additional costs, so it's a straightforward division problem.

I think I'm confident that $0.40 per lemon is right. So the answer should be G.

The unit cost per lemon is calculated by dividing the total cost ($2.00) by the number of lemons (5). 

\[
\text{Unit cost} = \frac{\$2.00}{5} = \$0.40
\]

Thus, the correct answer is option G.
