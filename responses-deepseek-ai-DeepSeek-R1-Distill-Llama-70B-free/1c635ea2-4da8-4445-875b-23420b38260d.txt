Question:

Clare manages a piano store. Her utility function is given by Utility = w - 100, where w is the total of all monetary payments to her and 100 represents the monetary equivalent of the disutility of exerting effort to run the store. Her next best alternative to managing the store gives her zero utility. The store's revenue depends on random factors, with an equal chance of being $1,000 or $400. If shareholders offered to share half of the store's revenue with her, what would her expected utility be?

Options:

A: 300
B: 225
C: 100
D: 450
E: 350
F: 250
G: 150
H: 200
I: 500
J: 400

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Clare managing a piano store, and I need to figure out her expected utility if the shareholders offer to share half the revenue with her. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the utility function is given as Utility = w - 100. Here, w is the total monetary payments she receives, and 100 represents the disutility, meaning the hassle or effort she puts into running the store. So, her utility depends directly on how much money she gets minus this fixed cost of effort.

Now, her next best alternative gives her zero utility. That probably means that if she doesn't take this offer, she can do something else that gives her utility of zero. So, she's comparing this offer to that alternative.

The store's revenue is random, with equal chances of being $1,000 or $400. So, there's a 50% chance each. Without any offer, I think her current situation is that she keeps all the revenue, right? Or does she? Wait, the question says shareholders offered to share half the revenue with her. So, maybe she was previously getting a different deal. Wait, the problem doesn't specify her current arrangement, so I think I can assume that before the offer, she was keeping all the revenue. Or maybe she's the manager, so perhaps she's getting a salary or something. Hmm, the question is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.

Wait, the utility function is w minus 100. So, w is all the monetary payments to her. So, if she's the manager, perhaps she's receiving all the revenue as her payment. But the problem says that shareholders are offering to share half the revenue with her. Oh, okay, I think I get it. So right now, she might be getting all the revenue, and the shareholders are offering her a new deal where she gets half, and they take half. So, she needs to evaluate whether this new deal is better in terms of her expected utility compared to her next best alternative, which is zero.

Wait, but no, the next best alternative gives her zero utility. So if she doesn't accept the offer, she would have the option to do something else that gives her zero utility. So, she's deciding between accepting the offer (and getting the utility from that) or rejecting it and getting zero. So, the question is asking what her expected utility would be if she accepts the offer.

So, the question is, under the new offer, what's her expected utility. Let's calculate that.

Under the offer, she'll get half of the revenue each time. The revenue has two possibilities: $1000 and $400, each with 0.5 probability.

So, when revenue is $1000, her w would be 1000 * 0.5 = $500.

When revenue is $400, her w would be 400 * 0.5 = $200.

Then, her utility for each scenario is w - 100. So:

- For the $1000 case: 500 - 100 = 400 utility.
- For the $400 case: 200 - 100 = 100 utility.

Since each outcome is equally likely, the expected utility is the average of these two. So, (400 + 100) / 2 = 500 / 2 = 250.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem says her next best alternative gives her zero utility. So, if she takes the offer, her expected utility is 250, which is better than zero. So, she would accept the offer. But the question is just asking what her expected utility would be, not whether she accepts it or not.

So, the calculation seems straightforward. Let me check the options. Option F is 250. So, the answer should be F.

Wait, wait a minute, another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The utility is w minus 100. So, in each case, she gets half the revenue, subtract 100. So yes, 500-100=400, 200-100=100. Average is 250.

Yes, that seems right. So the expected utility is 250.

To determine Clare's expected utility if she accepts the shareholders' offer, we start with her utility function:

\[
\text{Utility} = w - 100
\]

where \( w \) is the total monetary payments she receives, and 100 represents the disutility of running the store. The store's revenue is equally likely to be $1,000 or $400, and under the new offer, Clare would receive half of the revenue in each case.

### Step 1: Calculate \( w \) under the offer
- If revenue is $1,000:  
  \[
  w = \frac{1,000}{2} = 500
  \]
- If revenue is $400:  
  \[
  w = \frac{400}{2} = 200
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate utility for each scenario
Using the utility function \( \text{Utility} = w - 100 \):
- For $1,000 revenue:  
  \[
  \text{Utility} = 500 - 100 = 400
  \]
- For $400 revenue:  
  \[
  \text{Utility} = 200 - 100 = 100
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate expected utility
Since each revenue outcome is equally likely, the expected utility is the average of the two utilities:
\[
\text{Expected Utility} = \frac{400 + 100}{2} = \frac{500}{2} = 250
\]

### Final Answer
The expected utility if Clare accepts the offer is **250**, which corresponds to option **F**.

F
