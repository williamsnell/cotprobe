Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about a patient taking a drug every day, and I need to figure out how much of the drug is left in their body after the third tablet. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the patient takes 150 mg each day at the same time. But just before each tablet is taken, 5% of the drug remains. Wait, so that means 95% of the drug is eliminated each day, right? Because if 5% is left, then 95% has been metabolized or excreted. So each day, the drug's amount is multiplied by 5% (or 0.05) from the previous day.

Wait, but the question is about after the third tablet. Hmm. Let me think about the timing. So the first dose is taken on day one. Then, before the second dose, 5% remains. Then the second dose is taken, and before the third dose, again 5% remains from that. And then the third dose is taken. But wait, when the question asks for the quantity after the third tablet, it's after the third dose is administered, right?

Wait, no, wait. Because each tablet is taken at the same time every day. So let me try to map this out:

Let's outline each step:

1. First dose: 150 mg taken.
   Before the next dose (which is the second dose), 5% of the first dose remains. So that's 0.05 * 150 = 7.5 mg left. Then the second dose is taken, adding another 150 mg.

2. So after the second dose, the total would be 7.5 + 150 = 157.5 mg.

3. Then, before the third dose, 5% of the amount from the second dose period remains. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because each time, 5% remains from before each tablet. So each day, the body has 5% of the drug left, and then another 150 mg is taken.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as each day contributing a certain amount, with each prior day's amount being 5% of what was there the previous day.

Wait, another approach: each dose adds 150 mg, but each day, the drug's level is multiplied by 0.05 before the next dose. So after each day, the amount from the previous doses decays by 5%.

Wait, maybe it's a geometric series situation. Let's think about each dose and how much remains after each day.

After the first dose:
- Taken: 150 mg
- After 24 hours (before second dose): 150 * 0.05 = 7.5 mg.

Then, second dose is taken: 7.5 + 150 = 157.5 mg.

After another 24 hours (before third dose): 157.5 * 0.05 = 7.875 mg.

Third dose is taken: 7.875 + 150 = 157.875 mg.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "the quantity of the drug is in the body after the third tablet." So does that mean immediately after taking the third tablet? Or is it the amount just before the fourth tablet?

Wait, the question states: "after the third tablet." So the third tablet is taken, so immediately after that, the total would be the 5% from before plus the new 150 mg.

Wait, let me clarify:

Each day, the patient takes a tablet at the same time. So:

- Day 1: takes tablet 1 (150 mg). Before taking it, the body has 0 (assuming first dose). So after taking, it's 150 mg.
- Then, over the next 24 hours, 95% is eliminated, so 5% remains. So before taking tablet 2, the amount is 150 * 0.05 =7.5 mg. Then tablet 2 is taken, so total is 7.5 + 150 = 157.5 mg.

- After another 24 hours, before tablet 3 is taken, the body has 157.5 * 0.05 =7.875 mg. Then tablet 3 is taken, so total is 7.875 + 150 = 157.875 mg.

Wait, but the question is asking what's in the body after the third tablet. So that's after taking the third tablet, but before the next elimination period. So that would be 157.875 mg.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 157.875 mg. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think in terms of each dose contributing its own amount, each decaying over time.

Each dose taken will have its own elimination over the following days.

So when the third tablet is taken, the amounts from all three doses are present, each reduced by 5% each day since they were administered.

Wait, no, because each tablet is taken once every day, so each tablet's effect is only present for a certain number of days.

Wait, let me model it:

After the third tablet is taken, the amount from each tablet is:

- Tablet 1: administered on day 1. Before taking tablet 2 on day 2: 150 mg * (0.05)^1 =7.5 mg. Then, before tablet 3 on day 3: 7.5 mg *0.05 =0.375 mg. Then, after taking tablet 3, it's 0.375 mg.

Wait, but that's not considering the additional doses. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to sum the contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps each tablet's contribution is multiplied by (0.05)^(n-1), where n is the number of days since it was taken.

Wait, after the third tablet is taken, how much remains from each tablet:

- Tablet 1: taken on day 1, so it's been in the body for 2 days before the third dose. So (0.05)^2 *150 = 150*(0.05)^2 =150*(0.0025)=0.375 mg.

- Tablet 2: taken on day 2, so it's been in the body for 1 day before the third dose. So 150*(0.05)^1=7.5 mg.

- Tablet 3: taken on day 3, so it's just been administered, so 150 mg.

Wait, but no, because after the third tablet is taken, the previous amounts from tablet 1 and 2 have already been reduced. So the total after third tablet would be the sum of:

Tablet 1: 150*(0.05)^2 =0.375 mg.

Tablet 2:150*(0.05)^1=7.5 mg.

Tablet 3:150 mg.

So total is 0.375 + 7.5 +150 = 157.875 mg, which matches my earlier result.

So looking back, the options are:

I:157.875 mg.

So the correct answer should be I.

To determine the quantity of the drug in the body after the third tablet, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **First Tablet**:  
   - The patient takes 150 mg.  
   - After 24 hours, 5% of this dose remains:  
     \[
     150 \times 0.05 = 7.5 \, \text{mg}.
     \]  
   - Then, the second tablet is taken, adding another 150 mg.  

2. **Second Tablet**:  
   - After the second tablet, the total drug in the body is:  
     \[
     7.5 + 150 = 157.5 \, \text{mg}.
     \]  
   - After another 24 hours, 5% of this amount remains:  
     \[
     157.5 \times 0.05 = 7.875 \, \text{mg}.
     \]  
   - Then, the third tablet is taken, adding another 150 mg.  

3. **Third Tablet**:  
   - After the third tablet, the total drug in the body is:  
     \[
     7.875 + 150 = 157.875 \, \text{mg}.
     \]  

Thus, the total quantity of the drug in the body immediately after the third tablet is **157.875 mg**.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: 157.875 mg.**
