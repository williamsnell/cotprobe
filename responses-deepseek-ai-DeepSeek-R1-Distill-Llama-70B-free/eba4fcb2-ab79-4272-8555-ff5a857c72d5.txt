Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: A 2.4 kilowatt generator delivers 10 amperes. At what potential difference does the generator operate? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that power in electricity has something to do with volts, amps, and watts. Oh right, the formula for electric power is P = V * I, where P is power, V is voltage (potential difference), and I is current.

Wait, the generator's power is given in kilowatts. I need to make sure the units match. Let me convert that to watts because the current is in amperes. 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts, so 2.4 kilowatts is 2400 watts.

So P = 2400 W, I = 10 A. I need to find V. Rearranging the formula, V = P / I.

Plugging the numbers in: V = 2400 W / 10 A. Let me do the division. 2400 divided by 10 is 240. So V equals 240 volts.

Now I look at the options. Option D is 240 volts. So the answer should be D.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Yes, 2400 divided by 10 is definitely 240. And the formula P=VI is correct for direct current, which I think is what we're dealing with here. So yeah, I'm confident the answer is D.

To determine the potential difference (voltage) of the generator, we use the formula for electric power:

\[
P = V \cdot I
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the power (in watts),
- \( V \) is the potential difference (in volts),
- \( I \) is the current (in amperes).

Given:
- \( P = 2.4 \, \text{kW} = 2400 \, \text{W} \),
- \( I = 10 \, \text{A} \).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{P}{I}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V = \frac{2400}{10} = 240 \, \text{volts}.
\]

Thus, the generator operates at a potential difference of 240 volts. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

D: 240 volts.
