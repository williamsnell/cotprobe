Okay, so I've got this problem about depreciation for a radio station's stereo system. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says that WQLP radio bought a stereo system for $8,400. The system's expected to last 6 years and has a residual value of $1,200. Oh wait, but there's this additional 20% depreciation in the first year because the needles wear out fast. I'm supposed to find the total depreciation in the first year using straight-line basis.

Wait, straight-line depreciation usually means you spread the cost evenly over the life of the asset, right? So normally, without any additional depreciation, it would be (cost - residual) divided by years. But here, there's an extra 20% depreciation in the first year. So I think I need to calculate that in addition to the regular straight-line amount.

Let me start by calculating the regular straight-line depreciation. The formula is (Cost - Residual Value) / Life. The cost is $8,400, residual is $1,200, and life is 6 years. So that's ($8,400 - $1,200) / 6. Let's compute that: $7,200 / 6 is $1,200 per year. So each year, without the extra, it's $1,200 depreciation.

But wait, the first year has an extra 20% depreciation. Does that 20% apply to the cost of the asset or to something else? Hmm, the question says "additional 20% depreciation in the first year." So I think it's an extra 20% of the cost. So the cost is $8,400, so 20% of that is 0.2 * 8,400 = $1,680.

So the total depreciation in the first year would be the regular straight-line amount plus this extra 20%. So $1,200 (regular) + $1,680 (extra) = $2,880. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $2,880. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the additional depreciation. Let me read the question again. It says there's an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. So maybe the 20% is applied to the straight-line amount, not the cost. So 20% of $1,200 is $240. Then adding that to the regular $1,200 would make it $1,440. But that's option C, which is $1,440. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is applied to the asset's value at the beginning of the year, which is the cost minus the residual, but that doesn't make sense because residual is the end value.

Wait another thought. Maybe the additional 20% is on top of the straight-line for the first year. So the straight-line is $1,200 for each year, but then in the first year, you add an additional 20% of the asset's value. Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is calculated on the cost and then you have the straight-line on the reduced value.

Wait, maybe the asset is depreciated using straight-line, but in the first year, there's an extra 20% depreciation. So perhaps the first year's depreciation is 20% of the cost plus the straight-line. Or maybe it's the straight-line applied to the asset after the 20% is already taken.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The straight-line method normally would have an annual depreciation of ($8,400 - $1,200)/6 = $1,200 per year. If in the first year, there's an additional 20% depreciation, maybe that 20% is taken as a one-time expense. So perhaps the first year's depreciation is the regular $1,200 plus 20% of the cost ($8,400), which is $1,680. So total depreciation in the first year would be $1,200 + $1,680 = $2,880. But I don't see that in the options. The closest is option D: $3,360, but that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 20% is on the straight-line amount. So 20% of $1,200 is $240. So total depreciation is $1,200 + $240 = $1,440, which is option C. But that doesn't seem right because 1,440 is one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is computed on the asset's value after the straight-line depreciation. But that's getting complicated.

Wait another approach. Maybe the 20% is in addition to the straight-line, but perhaps the straight-line is for the first year. So perhaps the straight-line is calculated differently. Wait, no, straight-line is just the same every year, except for any adjustments.

Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is applied to the asset's value at the beginning of the year, which is $8,400. So 20% of that is $1,680. Then, the remaining amount after this depreciation would be $8,400 - $1,680 = $6,720. Then, using straight-line, the residual is $1,200, so the remaining depreciable amount is $6,720 - $1,200 = $5,520. That's to be depreciated over 5 years (since the first year already had the 20% taken). So the annual straight-line would be $5,520 /5 = $1,104 per year. But wait, that's complicating things, and the question is only about the first year's depreciation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the additional 20% is part of the first year's depreciation, regardless of the straight-line. So the first year's depreciation is 20% of the cost plus the straight-line. But wait, the straight-line is $1,200 per year. So first year would be $1,200 + (20% of 8,400) = $1,200 + $1,680 = $2,880. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the straight-line is applied after the 20% depreciation. So first, compute 20% of $8,400 = $1,680. Then, the remaining amount is $8,400 - $1,680 = $6,720. Then, the straight-line depreciation would be ($6,720 - $1,200)/6 years. That's $5,520 /6 = $920 per year. But that's the annual depreciation after the first year. So in the first year, the total depreciation is $1,680 (20%) plus $920 (straight-line first year) = $2,600. That's option A: $2,600.

Wait, but the problem says "using the straight-line basis." So perhaps the 20% is an additional depreciation on top of the straight-line, but maybe the straight-line is calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is part of the straight-line calculation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is the entire first year's depreciation, and then the straight-line applies to the remaining years. So total depreciation for the first year is 20% of the cost, which is $1,680. Then, the remaining amount is $8,400 - $1,680 = $6,720, which is depreciated over the remaining 5 years. So the annual straight-line after that would be $6,720 /5 = $1,344 per year. But that's for subsequent years, and the question is about the first year only, which would be $1,680. But $1,680 is option F.

Wait, but the question is asking for the total depreciation in the first year using the straight-line basis. So perhaps the straight-line method is used normally, but with an adjustment for the additional 20% in the first year. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try another approach. Maybe the straight-line basis is modified to include the 20% in the first year. So the depreciable amount is cost minus residual, which is $8,400 - $1,200 = $7,200. Normally, this is spread over 6 years, so $1,200 per year. But in the first year, there's an additional 20% depreciation. So perhaps the first year's depreciation is 20% of $7,200? That would be 0.2 * 7,200 = $1,440. So the total depreciation in the first year would be $1,440, which is option C. But wait, that interpretation would mean that the 20% is applied to the depreciable amount, not the original cost.

Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is taken on top of the straight-line. So first year's depreciation is $1,200 (straight-line) plus 20% of $7,200 (the depreciable amount), which is $1,200 + $1,440 = $2,640. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, what if the additional 20% is applied to the original cost, making the first year's depreciation 20% of $8,400 = $1,680, and then the straight-line depreciation is calculated on the remaining amount. So after first year, the asset's value is $8,400 - $1,680 = $6,720. Then, the straight-line would be ($6,720 - $1,200) /5 = $5,520 /5 = $1,104 per year. But the question is about the first year's total depreciation, which would just be $1,680. But that's option F, which is $1,680.

Wait, but the question says "using the straight-line basis." So perhaps the 20% is an extra depreciation, so the total depreciation is straight-line plus 20% of the cost. So $1,200 + $1,680 = $2,880. But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is the only depreciation in the first year, and then the remaining is depreciated over 5 years. So first year: 20% of $8,400 = $1,680. Then the remaining $6,720 is depreciated over 5 years, so $1,344 each year. But the question is asking for the first year, so $1,680 is the answer, which is option F.

But wait, the problem says "using the straight-line basis." So perhaps the 20% is in addition to the straight-line, but the straight-line is calculated normally. So normally, straight-line is $1,200 per year. First year is $1,200 plus 20% of $8,400, which is $1,680. So total depreciation is $2,880. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, option F is $1,680, which is just the 20%. Option C is $1,440, which is 20% of $7,200 (the depreciable amount). Option A is $2,600, which is if you add 20% of cost ($1,680) to straight-line ($1,200), but that's $2,880. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try to see what the options are:

The options are:

A: $2,600

B: $2,040

C: $1,440

D: $3,360

E: $5,520

F: $1,680

G: $1,020

H: $3,000

I: $1,200

J: $920

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate straight-line depreciation for the first year and then add the additional 20% as a separate depreciation. So straight-line is ($8,400 - $1,200)/6 = $1,200 per year. The additional 20% is 20% of what? Maybe 20% of the straight-line depreciation. So 0.2 * 1,200 = $240. So total first year depreciation is $1,200 + $240 = $1,440, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the additional 20% is applied to the cost, making the first year's depreciation 20% of $8,400 = $1,680, plus the straight-line of $1,200, which totals $2,880, but that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the straight-line depreciation is computed on the cost minus the residual, which is $7,200 over 6 years, so $1,200 per year. But in the first year, due to the additional 20%, the depreciation is 120% of the straight-line amount. So 1.2 * 1,200 = $1,440. That would explain option C.

Yes, that makes sense. So the first year's depreciation is 120% of the straight-line amount because of the additional 20% depreciation. So 1.2 * 1,200 = $1,440. So the correct answer would be option C.
</think>

To determine the total depreciation in the first year for WQLP radio station's stereo system, we start by calculating the straight-line depreciation. The formula for straight-line depreciation is:

\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value}}{\text{Life}}
\]

Given:
- Cost = $8,400
- Residual Value = $1,200
- Life = 6 years

\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{8,400 - 1,200}{6} = \frac{7,200}{6} = 1,200
\]

Thus, the straight-line depreciation per year is $1,200.

The problem also states that there is an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. This additional depreciation is applied to the straight-line depreciation amount. Therefore, we calculate 20% of $1,200:

\[
\text{Additional Depreciation} = 0.2 \times 1,200 = 240
\]

The total depreciation in the first year is the sum of the straight-line depreciation and the additional depreciation:

\[
\text{Total Depreciation in First Year} = 1,200 + 240 = 1,440
\]

Thus, the total depreciation in the first year is $1,440, which corresponds to **Option C**.
