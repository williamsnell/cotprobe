Okay, so I need to find the integral of the function f(x, y) over the region I, which is the square [0,1]x[0,1]. The function f is defined piecewise: it's 1 - x - y when x + y ≤ 1, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, I remember that integrating over a region involves breaking it into parts where the function behaves differently. 

First, I should visualize the region of integration. The square [0,1]x[0,1] is straightforward. Now, the condition x + y ≤ 1 describes a line in this square. The line x + y =1 goes from (0,1) to (1,0), so the region where x + y ≤1 is the area below this line. So the integral will only consider this triangular region, because elsewhere f(x,y) is zero.

So the integral simplifies to the double integral of (1 - x - y) over the triangular area where x and y are both between 0 and 1, and x + y ≤1. 

I think setting up the correct limits for x and y is key here. Let me decide whether to integrate in x first or y first. Maybe integrating x first would be easier. For a given y, x goes from 0 to 1 - y because x + y must be ≤1. And y goes from 0 to 1.

So the integral becomes the integral from y=0 to y=1, and for each y, x from 0 to 1-y of (1 - x - y) dx dy.

Let me compute the inner integral first: integrate (1 - x - y) with respect to x from 0 to 1 - y.

Expanding the integrand: (1 - y) - x.

Integrate term by term. The integral of (1 - y) dx is (1 - y)*x. The integral of x dx is (1/2)x². So putting it together, from 0 to (1 - y):

At upper limit x=1-y:
(1 - y)(1 - y) - (1/2)(1 - y)^2
= (1 - y)^2 - (1/2)(1 - y)^2
= (1/2)(1 - y)^2

At lower limit x=0: 0 - 0 = 0.

So the inner integral is (1/2)(1 - y)^2.

Now, integrate this with respect to y from 0 to 1.

So the outer integral is ∫ from 0 to1 of (1/2)(1 - y)^2 dy.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 1 - y, then du = -dy. When y=0, u=1; y=1, u=0. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ from u=1 to u=0 of u² (-du), which flips the limits to ∫ from 0 to1 of (1/2)u² du.

Integrate u²: (1/2)*(u^3/3) evaluated from 0 to 1.

At u=1: (1/2)*(1/3) = 1/6.

At u=0: 0.

So the integral is 1/6, which is approximately 0.166666...

Looking at the options, option H is 0.16667. So the answer should be H.

To compute the integral of \( f(x, y) \) over the region \( I = [0,1] \times [0,1] \), we note that \( f(x, y) \) is defined piecewise. The function is \( 1 - x - y \) when \( x + y \leq 1 \) and \( 0 \) otherwise. The region \( x + y \leq 1 \) forms a triangular area below the line \( x + y = 1 \) within the square \( [0,1] \times [0,1] \). The integral simplifies to the double integral of \( 1 - x - y \) over this triangular region.

The limits for integration are as follows: for a fixed \( y \), \( x \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 1 - y \), and \( y \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \). Thus, the integral is:

\[
\int_{y=0}^1 \int_{x=0}^{1-y} (1 - x - y) \, dx \, dy.
\]

First, compute the inner integral with respect to \( x \):

\[
\int_{x=0}^{1-y} (1 - x - y) \, dx = \int_{x=0}^{1-y} (1 - y - x) \, dx.
\]

Expanding the integrand:

\[
\int_{x=0}^{1-y} (1 - y) \, dx - \int_{x=0}^{1-y} x \, dx.
\]

The first term evaluates to:

\[
(1 - y) \cdot x \Big|_{x=0}^{1-y} = (1 - y)(1 - y) = (1 - y)^2.
\]

The second term evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} x^2 \Big|_{x=0}^{1-y} = \frac{1}{2} (1 - y)^2.
\]

Thus, the inner integral becomes:

\[
(1 - y)^2 - \frac{1}{2} (1 - y)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (1 - y)^2.
\]

Now, compute the outer integral with respect to \( y \):

\[
\int_{y=0}^1 \frac{1}{2} (1 - y)^2 \, dy.
\]

Substitute \( u = 1 - y \), so \( du = -dy \). When \( y = 0 \), \( u = 1 \); when \( y = 1 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{u=1}^0 u^2 (-du) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{u=0}^1 u^2 \, du.
\]

The integral of \( u^2 \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{u^3}{3} \Big|_{u=0}^1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is \( \frac{1}{6} \), which is approximately \( 0.16667 \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: 0.16667**
