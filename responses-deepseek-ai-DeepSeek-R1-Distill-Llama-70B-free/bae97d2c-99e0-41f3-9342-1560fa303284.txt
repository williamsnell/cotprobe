Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about HF dissociation. Hmm, I remember that HF is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't fully dissociate in water. The problem is asking about dilution affecting the percent dissociation. Oh right, when you dilute a weak electrolyte, the degree of dissociation increases, but the concentration decreases.

The question says we have a 0.5 M HF solution, and the dissociation constant K is 6.71 ×10^-4. I need to find out how much to dilute it to double the percent dissociation.

Wait, the formula for percent dissociation (α) is something like (ions produced)/(initial concentration) × 100%. For a weak acid HA dissociating into H+ and A-: α = [H+]/(HA initial). Since HF is a 1:1 electrolyte, the expression should be similar.

The dissociation constant K is given by α² / (1 - α) * C, but wait, wait. Let me think: for HA, K = [H+][A-]/[HA]. Since α is small, [H+] = [A-] = α√C, but wait, no, wait: the initial concentration is C, and at dissociation α, [H+] is α√C? Or is it α*C?

Wait, maybe I should start with the exact expression. Let me consider the dissociation of HF:

HF ⇌ H+ + F⁻

The initial concentration is C = 0.5 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of H+ and F⁻ is α*C, and the remaining HF is C(1 - α). So the expression for K is:

K = (α C)(α C) / [C (1 - α)] = (α² C) / (1 - α)

Since K is small, I can approximate that α is much less than 1, so 1 - α ≈ 1. Then the equation simplifies to K ≈ α² C. So α ≈ sqrt(K/C).

But wait, the question is about doubling the percent dissociation. Let's say initially, the percent dissociation is α1, and after dilution, it's α2 = 2 α1.

Wait, but when you dilute the solution, the concentration becomes lower. Let me clarify. Let me denote the initial concentration as C1 = 0.5 M, and after dilution, the concentration is C2 = C1 / D, where D is the dilution factor (so if you dilute by factor 2, C2 is 0.25 M, etc.)

The initial percent dissociation α1 is sqrt(K/(C1)), and the new α2 is sqrt(K/(C2)).

We want α2 = 2 α1.

So plug in:

sqrt(K / C2) = 2 sqrt(K / C1)

Square both sides:

K/C2 = 4 K/C1

Divide both sides by K:

1/C2 = 4/C1

So C2 = C1 /4

Wait, but C2 is the concentration after dilution, which is C1 divided by the dilution factor D. So,

C2 = C1 / D → C1/(D) = C1/4 → D=4.

Wait, so the dilution factor is 4. But wait, what's the dilution factor in terms of volume? Dilution factor D is the ratio of the new volume to the old volume. So if you have V1 volume, and add to V2, then D = V2/V1.

But wait, the problem says "how much dilution is necessary". Does D refer to the factor by which the concentration decreases, which would be 4? Because if you go from 0.5 M to 0.125 M, that's a dilution factor of 4.

But wait, the answer options don't have 4 as an option. The options are A:4.13, B:3.21, etc.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that α is small isn't valid, so we can't make the approximation. Hmm, because if we double α, maybe the approximation breaks down.

Let me think again. The exact expression for K is:

K = (α² C) / (1 - α)

We can't neglect α in the denominator. So let's be precise.

Initially, the solution has concentration C1 = 0.5 M. The initial α1 is such that:

K = (α1² C1) / (1 - α1 )

After dilution, concentration is C2 = C1 / D. The new α2 is 2 α1.

So,

K = ( (2 α1)^2 (C1/D) ) / (1 - 2 α1 )

We have two equations:

1) K = ( α1² C1 ) / (1 - α1 )

2) K = (4 α1² (C1/D)) / (1 - 2 α1 )

Set them equal:

( α1² C1 ) / (1 - α1 ) = (4 α1² C1 / D ) / (1 - 2 α1 )

Cancel α1² C1 from both sides:

1/(1 - α1 ) = 4/( D (1 - 2 α1 ) )

Rearrange to solve for D:

D = [4 (1 - α1 ) ] / (1 - 2 α1 )

Hmm, but we don't know α1 yet. So we need to find α1 first.

From equation 1:

K = ( α1² C1 ) / (1 - α1 )

We know K and C1.

K =6.71e-4, C1=0.5.

So,

6.71e-4 = ( α1^2 *0.5 ) / (1 - α1 )

Multiply both sides by (1 - α1 ):

6.71e-4 (1 - α1 ) = 0.5 α1² 

Multiply both sides by 1e4 to make it easier:

6.71 (1 - α1 ) = 500 α1² 

6.71 -6.71 α1 = 500 α1² 

Bring all terms to one side:

500 α1² +6.71 α1 -6.71 =0

This is a quadratic equation in α1.

Use quadratic formula: α1 = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ]/(2a)

Where a=500, b=6.71, c=-6.71.

Discriminant D = b^2 +4ac = (6.71)^2 +4*500*6.71

Calculate:

6.71^2 ≈ 45.02

4 *500 *6.71 = 2000 *6.71 = 13420

So D ≈ 45.02 + 13420 = 13465.02 → sqrt(D) ≈ 116.06

So α1 = [ -6.71 ±116.06 ]/(1000) → take positive root.

(116.06 -6.71 )/1000 → 109.35 /1000 → 0.10935 → approximately 0.1094 or 10.94%.

So α1 ≈ 0.10935.

Then, plug into D equation:

D = [4 (1 - α1 ) ] / (1 - 2 α1 )

Compute numerator: 4*(1 -0.10935 )=4*0.89065≈3.5626

Denominator: 1 - 2*(0.10935)=1 -0.2187=0.7813

So D≈3.5626 / 0.7813 ≈4.5626.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.13, option B is 3.21. Hmm, 4.56 isn't one of the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me recalculate.

Original quadratic equation: 500 α² +6.71 α -6.71=0

So a=500, b=6.71, c= -6.71.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac → because c is negative, so 6.71² +4*500*6.71.

Wait wait, the formula is D = b² -4ac. Since a=500, c=-6.71, so:

D = (6.71)^2 -4 *500*(-6.71) → 6.71^2 + 4*500*6.71

Yes, which is correct as before.

Earlier calculation was 6.71^2≈45.02; 4*500*6.71=13420. So D=45.02+13420=13465.02.

sqrt(13465)≈116.06.

So yes, the numerator is about 116.06 -6.71=109.35; divided by 1000 gives α1≈0.10935.

Then D =4*(1 - 0.10935)/(1 -0.2187 )

1 -0.10935=0.89065 →4*0.89065=3.5626.

Denominator: 0.7813.

3.5626 /0.7813 ≈4.5626.

Hmm, none of the options are 4.56. The closest would be option A:4.13, or perhaps another error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

The initial setup after dilution, we have:

α2 = 2 α1.

Wait, but if the initial solution is 0.5 M, and we're diluting it, perhaps the correct approach is to relate the initial and final concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that α is small isn't valid even after doubling. Because initial α is about 10%, doubling would make it 20%, which isn't negligible. So the simplified formula K ≈ α² C isn't sufficient, so we have to use the exact expression.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me try to model the problem without making the approximation.

Let me denote for the initial solution:

K = (α1² C1)/(1 - α1 )

After dilution, concentration is C2 = C1 / D.

Then, for the diluted solution:

K = ( (2 α1)^2 C2 ) / (1 - 2 α1 )

Substituting C2 = C1/D:

K = (4 α1² C1 / D ) / (1 - 2 α1 )

Set equal to the initial K expression:

(α1² C1 )/(1 - α1 ) = (4 α1² C1 / D )/(1 - 2 α1 )

Cancel α1² C1 from both sides:

1/(1 - α1 ) = 4/( D (1 -2 α1 ) )

Rearranged:

D = 4 (1 - α1 ) / (1 - 2 α1 )

We can compute D once we find α1.

We can find α1 using the initial K expression.

Let me recompute α1 more accurately. Using K =6.71e-4, C1=0.5.

So,

6.71e-4 = (α1² *0.5 )/(1 - α1 )

Multiply both sides by (1 - α1 ):

6.71e-4 (1 - α1 ) =0.5 α1²

Multiply both sides by 1e4 to get rid of the decimals:

6.71 (1 - α1 ) =500 α1²

So,

6.71 -6.71 α1 =500 α1²

Rearranged:

500 α1² +6.71 α1 -6.71=0.

Quadratic equation coefficients:

a=500, b=6.71, c= -6.71.

Discriminant is D = b² -4ac → (6.71)^2 +4*500*6.71.

Compute 6.71^2:

6 *6=36, 6 *0.71=4.26; 0.71 *6=4.26; 0.71^2≈0.5041. So 6.71^2 = let's compute 6.71 *6.71.

6*6=36, 6*0.71=4.26, 0.71*6=4.26, 0.71*0.71≈0.504.

So:

6.71 *6.71 = (6 +0.71)^2 =6² + 2*6*0.71 +0.71² =36 +8.52 +0.5041=45.0241.

Then, 4ac =4*500*(-6.71)=2000*(-6.71)= -13420.

Wait, D = b² -4ac → 45.0241 -4*500*(-6.71) → 45.0241 + 4*500*6.71.

Compute 4*500=2000, 2000 *6.71=13420.

So D=45.0241 +13420=13465.0241.

sqrt(13465.0241)= let's see. 116^2=13456. 116^2= (100+16)^2=10000+3200+256=13456.

Then 13465.0241-13456=9.0241.

So sqrt(13465.0241)=116 + (9.0241)/(2*116) ≈116 + 9.0241/232≈116 +0.0389≈116.0389.

So sqrt(D)=~116.0389.

Then, α1 = [ -b + sqrt(D) ]/(2a) ) → [ -6.71 +116.0389 ]/(2*500 )

Compute numerator: 116.0389-6.71=109.3289.

Divide by 1000 (since 2a=1000):

109.3289 /1000 → 0.1093289 ≈0.1093.

So α1≈0.1093.

Now, compute D.

D=4*(1 - α1 )/(1 -2 α1 )

1 - α1 =0.8907.

1-2 α1=1-0.2186=0.7814.

So D=4 *0.8907 /0.7814.

Compute numerator:4 *0.8907≈3.5628.

Denominator:0.7814.

3.5628 /0.7814 ≈4.562.

Hmm, but the options don't have 4.56. The closest are option A:4.13, and option I:10.52. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers. Let me compute (1 - α1 )=0.89065, 4*(0.89065)=3.5626.

Denominator (1-2α1)=1-0.2186=0.7814.

So 3.5626 /0.7814 → let me compute this division accurately.

0.7814 *4.5 is 0.7814 *4 =3.1256, 0.7814 *0.5=0.3907 → total 3.5163. So 4.5 →3.5163.

The target is 3.5626. The difference is 3.5626 -3.5163=0.0463.

How much more than 4.5? Let's see how much each 0.01 adds.

0.7814 *0.01=0.007814. So for 0.0463, 0.0463 /0.007814 ≈5.925. So 0.05925 more than 0.01? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, 3.5626 -3.5163=0.0463.

Each 0.01 of D would contribute 0.007814 to the product.

So how many steps to reach 0.0463?

0.0463 /0.007814 ≈5.925. So 0.05925.

So D≈4.5 +0.05925=4.55925, which is approximately 4.56.

So D≈4.56, which is about 4.56 times dilution.

Looking at the options: the closest option is A:4.13, but that's not exact. Are any of the options close to 4.56? Let me look: option A is 4.13, option D is 2.06, option C is5.65, F:8.26, I:10.52.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe I should consider that the new α is 2α1, but perhaps the formula for K in the diluted solution is different.

Wait, another approach: Let’s not assume that α is small. Let me write the exact expressions.

For the initial solution:

K = (α1² C1)/(1 - α1 )

For the diluted solution (with concentration C2= C1/D):

K = (α2² C2)/(1 - α2 )

But α2 =2 α1.

So,

( (2 α1)^2 * (C1/D) ) / (1 - 2 α1 ) = (α1² C1 )/(1 - α1 )

Simplify:

(4 α1² C1 / D )/(1 - 2 α1 ) = (α1² C1 )/(1 - α1 )

Cancel α1² and C1 from both sides:

4/(D (1 - 2 α1 )) = 1/(1 - α1 )

Multiply both sides by D (1-2 α1 ) (1 - α1 ):

4 (1 - α1 ) = D (1 - 2 α1 )

So,

D=4(1 - α1 )/(1 -2 α1 )

Which is what I had earlier.

So, my calculation seems correct, leading to D≈4.56. But the options don't have this value. Hmm.

Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the K expression.

Wait another thought: perhaps the initial assumption that α is 10% is correct, but when you double it to 20%, the approximation breaks, so the exact expression must be used. But I did use the exact expression, so perhaps the options are off, but that’s unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I set up the equation wrong. Let me think: when you dilute, the concentration decreases, so perhaps the new concentration is C2 = C1 * (V1/V2). Wait, but the dilution factor D is V2/V1, so C2= C1/D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to
