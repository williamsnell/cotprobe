Okay, so I've got this question about Hamming distances between some codewords. Hmm, I remember that Hamming distance is the number of positions in which the corresponding symbols are different. Right, so for each pair of codewords, I need to compare each bit and count the differences.

The codewords given are 00000, 10101, and 01010. Wait, so there are three codewords, which makes three pairs to compare. Let me list them out:

1. Between 00000 and 10101
2. Between 00000 and 01010
3. Between 10101 and 01010

Let me tackle each pair one by one.

First pair: 00000 and 10101.

Comparing each bit position:

Position 1: 0 vs 1 → different → count 1
Position 2: 0 vs 0 → same → no count
Position 3: 0 vs 1 → different → count 2
Position 4: 0 vs 0 → same → no count
Position 5: 0 vs 1 → different → count 3

So the Hamming distance here is 3.

Second pair: 00000 and 01010.

Again, position by position:

1: 0 vs 0 → same
2: 0 vs 1 → different → count 1
3: 0 vs 0 → same
4: 0 vs 1 → different → count 2
5: 0 vs 0 → same

So the distance is 2 here.

Third pair: 10101 and 01010.

Comparing each position:

1: 1 vs 0 → different → count 1
2: 0 vs 1 → different → count 2
3: 1 vs 0 → different → count 3
4: 0 vs 1 → different → count 4
5: 1 vs 0 → different → count 5

Wow, that's a distance of 5.

Wait, so now I have the three distances: 3, 2, and 5. The question is asking for the minimum Hamming distance among these codewords. So the smallest is 2. Let me check the options provided.

Looking at the options, option F is 1, J is 2. So the minimum is 2, which is option J.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh no, I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the second pair again. The second pair was 00000 and 01010. Positions 2 and 4 are different, so that's 2 differences. So the distance is 2. So the minimum of all pairwise distances is 2.

So the correct answer should be J: 2.

To determine the minimum Hamming distance among the codewords 00000, 10101, and 01010, we calculate the pairwise Hamming distances:

1. **Between 00000 and 10101**:  
   Comparing each bit:  
   - Position 1: 0 vs 1 → different  
   - Position 2: 0 vs 0 → same  
   - Position 3: 0 vs 1 → different  
   - Position 4: 0 vs 0 → same  
   - Position 5: 0 vs 1 → different  
   **Hamming distance = 3**.

2. **Between 00000 and 01010**:  
   Comparing each bit:  
   - Position 1: 0 vs 0 → same  
   - Position 2: 0 vs 1 → different  
   - Position 3: 0 vs 0 → same  
   - Position 4: 0 vs 1 → different  
   - Position 5: 0 vs 0 → same  
   **Hamming distance = 2**.

3. **Between 10101 and 01010**:  
   Comparing each bit:  
   - Position 1: 1 vs 0 → different  
   - Position 2: 0 vs 1 → different  
   - Position 3: 1 vs 0 → different  
   - Position 4: 0 vs 1 → different  
   - Position 5: 1 vs 0 → different  
   **Hamming distance = 5**.

The minimum Hamming distance among the codewords is **2**.  

The correct answer is **J: 2**.
