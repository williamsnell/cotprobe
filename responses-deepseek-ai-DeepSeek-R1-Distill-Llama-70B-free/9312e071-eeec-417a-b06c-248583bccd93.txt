Question:

Marx prided himself on his 'scientific' analysis of capital-ism. Through this analysis, he felt he had proved how the problemsfacing the nineteenth century were intimately re-latedto the capitalist mode of production. Modern radical economistshold the similar view that the problems of modernWestern society are inherent in capitalist production. Give the orthodox rebuttal to this viewpoint.

Options:

A: Elimination of capitalism can resolve all societal problems.
B: Many non-capitalist societies suffer from the same problems as Western, capitalist countries.
C: The capitalist mode of production is the only system that has consistently reduced poverty worldwide.
D: Problems in Western society are solely due to individual moral failures, not the economic system.
E: Capitalism naturally corrects any societal problems through market forces without the need for intervention.
F: Non-Western capitalist societies do not encounter any social or economic problems.
G: Capitalism is the sole cause of problems in modern Western society.
H: The problems of modern Western society are a result of technological advancement, not the capitalist production mode.
I: Only capitalist societies face issues such as exploitation, pollution, and economic inequality.
J: Capitalist societies have the best track record for solving social and economic problems.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Marx and the orthodox rebuttal to radical economists' views. Let me start by breaking down what the question is asking.

Marx argued that the problems of the 19th century were tied to the capitalist mode of production. Modern radical economists make a similar point, saying that today's Western societal issues are inherent to capitalism. The question is asking for the orthodox rebuttal to this viewpoint. So, I need to think about what the opposing argument would be from a more traditional or mainstream economic perspective.

Orthodox economics, as I understand it, tends to support free-market principles and might argue that capitalism isn't the root of all problems. So, the rebuttal would likely counter the idea that capitalism is inherently flawed or the sole cause of societal issues.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Elimination of capitalism can resolve all societal problems. That seems more like a Marxist argument, not a rebuttal. So probably not the answer.

Option B: Many non-capitalist societies suffer from the same problems as Western, capitalist countries. Hmm, this makes sense as a rebuttal. If non-capitalist societies have similar issues, then it's not just capitalism causing them. It suggests that the problems are more universal and not specific to capitalism.

Option C: The capitalist mode of production is the only system that has consistently reduced poverty worldwide. While this is a positive take on capitalism, it's more about the benefits of capitalism rather than directly rebutting the claim that problems are inherent to it. So maybe not the best fit.

Option D: Problems in Western society are solely due to individual moral failures, not the economic system. That's a possible rebuttal, but I'm not sure if that's the orthodox view. It's a bit narrow, focusing only on individual failures without considering structural issues.

Option E: Capitalism naturally corrects any societal problems through market forces without the need for intervention. This is a strong free-market stance, arguing that the market can self-correct. But I'm not sure if that's the direct rebuttal to the radical economists' point about inherent problems.

Option F: Non-Western capitalist societies do not encounter any social or economic problems. That doesn't seem right because no society is without problems, so this is probably incorrect.

Option G: Capitalism is the sole cause of problems in modern Western society. No, that's the opposite of the rebuttal. Radical economists might say that, so this is not the answer.

Option H: The problems of modern Western society are a result of technological advancement, not the capitalist production mode. This shifts the blame to technology, which could be a possible argument, but I'm not sure if that's the main orthodox rebuttal.

Option I: Only capitalist societies face issues such as exploitation, pollution, and economic inequality. Again, this seems incorrect because non-capitalist societies also have these issues, which is more in line with option B.

Option J: Capitalist societies have the best track record for solving social and economic problems. This is a pro-capitalism statement, highlighting its effectiveness, but again, maybe not the direct rebuttal.

So, putting this together, the key point is that if non-capitalist societies have the same problems, then capitalism isn't the sole cause. Therefore, option B seems like the correct rebuttal. It challenges the idea that capitalism is inherently flawed by pointing out that other systems face similar issues.
</think>

The orthodox rebuttal to the viewpoint that the problems of modern Western society are inherent to capitalist production would argue that these issues are not unique to capitalism. Many non-capitalist societies also face similar problems, such as exploitation, pollution, and economic inequality. This suggests that the problems are not solely the result of the capitalist system but are more universal challenges that exist across different economic systems.

Answer: B
