Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about time-series models versus structural models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about the disadvantages of using pure time-series models compared to structural models. The options are A through D. Alright, let's break down each choice.

First, I remember that time-series models focus on patterns and trends within the data over time. They use historical data to forecast future values. Models like ARIMA come to mind. On the other hand, structural models are based on underlying theories or factors that explain the data. They use explanatory variables, like how economic indicators might influence each other.

So the question is about the downside of pure time-series models. Let's look at the options:

Option A: They are not theoretically motivated. I think this might be a point. Structural models are often based on economic theory, so they have a theoretical foundation. Time-series models are more empirical, relying on the data's patterns rather than theory. So this could be a disadvantage because they lack the theoretical backing.

Option B: They cannot produce forecasts easily. Wait, no, time-series models are actually known for being good at forecasting. They're often used for that purpose. So B doesn't seem right because it's more of an advantage.

Option C: They cannot be used for very high frequency data. I'm not sure about this. Some time-series models can handle high-frequency data, like GARCH models for financial data which is often high-frequency. So maybe C isn't correct.

Option D: It is difficult to determine the appropriate explanatory variables. Wait, pure time-series models don't typically use explanatory variables. They rely on the series itself, like lagged values. Structural models, by contrast, do use explanatory variables. So this option seems a bit confusing. If anything, the problem with time-series models is that they don't include external variables, not that it's hard to determine them because they don't use them in the first place. So maybe D isn't the right answer.

Putting it all together, the main disadvantage of pure time-series models is that they aren't based on theory. So the answer should be A. They are not theoretically motivated.

The question asks about the disadvantages of using pure time-series models compared to structural models. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Pure time-series models are not theoretically motivated. This is correct because they rely on empirical patterns in the data rather than being grounded in theoretical frameworks, unlike structural models.
- **Option B**: This is incorrect because time-series models are specifically designed for forecasting and are often effective at it.
- **Option C**: This is incorrect because time-series models can handle high-frequency data, as seen in applications like financial analysis.
- **Option D**: This is incorrect because pure time-series models do not typically use explanatory variables, so the difficulty of determining them is not relevant.

The correct answer is **A**, as the lack of theoretical motivation is a key disadvantage of pure time-series models.

Answer: A
