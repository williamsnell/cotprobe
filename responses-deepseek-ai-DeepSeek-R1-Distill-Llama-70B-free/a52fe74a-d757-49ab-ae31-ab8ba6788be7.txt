Okay, so I've got this problem to solve using the van der Waals equation. The question is about finding the pressure exerted by 1 mole of carbon dioxide at 0°C in two different volumes: 1.00 liter and 0.05 liters. The options are A through J, each with two pressure values. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I remember that the van der Waals equation is different from the ideal gas law because it accounts for the volume of gas particles and intermolecular forces. The equation is:

[P + a(n/V)^2] * (V/n - b) = RT

Where:
- P is pressure
- n is moles
- V is volume
- R is the gas constant
- T is temperature in Kelvin
- a and b are van der Waals constants specific to each gas.

Since the problem gives n=1 mole, I can simplify the equation. Let me plug in n=1, which changes the equation to:

P = [RT/(V - b)] - a/(V^2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The van der Waals equation in terms of P is:

P = [nRT/(V - nb)] - a(n^2/V^2)

But since n=1, it becomes:

P = [RT/(V - b)] - a/(V^2)

Right, that makes sense. So I need the values of a and b for CO2. I think I remember that CO2 has a=3.658 L²·atm/mol² and b=0.04267 L/mol. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, I should probably get the exact values. Alternatively, if I'm doing this from memory, I'll proceed and see if the numbers make sense.

The temperature is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. R is the gas constant. Oh wait, the value of R depends on the units. Since the pressure is in atm, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So R=0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T=273 K, n=1, V is given in liters, and a and b are in L and L²·atm units.

Let me tackle part (a) first: V = 1.00 L.

Plugging the numbers into the equation:

P = [ (0.0821 * 273) / (1.00 - 0.04267) ] - (3.658)/(1.00)^2

Calculate each part step by step.

First, calculate RT: 0.0821 * 273 ≈ 22.41 (since 0.0821 * 270 is 22.167, and 0.0821*3=0.2463, so total ≈ 22.41).

Denominator V - b: 1.00 - 0.04267 = 0.95733 L.

So the first term is 22.41 / 0.95733 ≈ let's see, 22.41 ÷ 0.957 approx 23.4 atm. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

0.95733 is approximately 0.957. Let me compute 22.41 / 0.957.

22.41 / 0.957 = let me see:

0.957 * 23 = 22.00 (because 0.957 * 20=19.14, 0.957*3=2.871; 19.14+2.871=22.011). So 0.957*23=22.011.

22.41 -22.011=0.399 remains.

So 0.399 /0.957 ≈ approx 0.417. So total is 23 + 0.417 ≈23.417 atm.

Wait, but let me compute it more precisely. 22.41 / 0.95733.

Using a calculator approach:

Divide 22.41 by 0.95733.

0.95733 * 23 = 22.011. 22.41 is 0.399 more.

23 + (0.399 /0.95733) ≈ 23 + 0.4168 ≈ 23.4168 atm.

So the first term is approximately 23.417 atm.

Now the second term: a/(V^2) = 3.658 / (1.00)^2 = 3.658 atm.

So P = 23.417 - 3.658 ≈ 19.759 atm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest might be option G: 19.79 atm, 1617 atm. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait, another thought: the units. Oh, wait, in the van der Waals equation, for the pressure, the term a is in L²·atm/mol², so when n=1, a/(V^2) is 3.658/(1^2) =3.658 atm.

So the calculation looks correct: 23.417 -3.658 = approx 19.759 atm.

Looking at the options, option G is 19.79 atm for part (a), and 1617 atm for part (b). So that's a possibility.

Wait, but let me check part (b) to see if that makes sense.

Part (b) is V=0.05 L. Let's plug in the numbers.

P = [ (0.0821 * 273) / (0.05 - 0.04267) ] - (3.658)/(0.05)^2

Calculate each term.

RT is again 22.41.

Denominator V - b: 0.05 - 0.04267 = 0.00733 L.

So first term is 22.41 / 0.00733. Let me compute that.

22.41 / 0.00733 ≈ let's see.

0.00733 * 3000 = 22 (because 0.00733 * 3000 = 21.99 ≈22). So 22.41 / 0.00733 ≈ approx 3057.

Wait wait, 0.00733 is 7.33e-3. So 22.41 / 0.00733 = ?

Let me compute 22.41 / 0.00733.

Divide 22.41 by 0.00733:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to get 22410 /7.33 ≈ 22410 ÷7.33.

Let me compute 7.33 * 3057 = 7.33 * 3000=21990, 7.33*57= approx 418. So 21990+418=22408. That's very close to 22410. So 3057.

So the first term is approximately 3057 atm.

Second term: a/(V^2) = 3.658 / (0.05)^2 =3.658 /0.0025 = 1463.2 atm.

So P = 3057 - 1463.2 = 1593.8 atm.

Hmm, but looking at the options, part (b) in option G is 1617 atm, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, a for CO2 is 3.658? Or maybe I got the values wrong. Let me confirm the van der Waals constants for CO2.

Upon checking (in my memory), CO2 has a=3.658 L²·atm/mol² and b=0.04267 L/mol. Yes, that's correct.

So for part (b):

V =0.05 L.

V - b =0.05 - 0.04267=0.00733 L.

RT=0.0821 *273=22.41.

First term: 22.41 /0.00733 = approx 3057 atm.

Second term: a/(V^2) =3.658/(0.05)^2 =3.658/0.0025 = 1463.2 atm.

So P = 3057 - 1463.2 =1593.8 atm.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match 1593.8.

Looking at the options:

Option G: 19.79 atm (a), 1617 atm (b). Hmm, 1617 is higher than my calculation of 1593.8.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated something. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Let me recalculate the first term for part (b):

RT/(V - b) = (0.0821 *273.15)/(0.05 -0.04267)

Wait, maybe I should use T=273.15 K instead of 273 K for more accuracy.

RT=0.0821 *273.15= let's compute.

0.0821 *273=22.41, 0.0821*0.15=0.012315. So total 22.41 +0.012315≈22.4223.

V -b =0.05 -0.04267=0.00733.

So 22.4223 /0.00733 = Let's compute this more accurately.

22.4223 ÷ 0.00733.

Let me compute 0.00733 * X =22.4223.

X=22.4223 /0.00733.

Compute 22.4223 ÷ 0.00733.

Let me compute 0.00733 * 3057 = ?

0.00733 *3000=21.99.

0.00733 *57=0.41781.

Total 21.99 + 0.41781 =22.40781.

Which is very close to 22.4223. So the difference is 22.4223 -22.40781=0.01443.

So 0.01443 /0.00733= approx 1.97.

So X≈3057 +1.97=3058.97≈3059 atm.

So first term is 3059 atm.

Second term: a/(V^2)=3.658/(0.05)^2=3.658/0.0025=1463.2 atm.

So P=3059 -1463.2=1595.8 atm.

Hmm, so about 1596 atm. None of the options exactly match that. Looking at the options for part (b):

Option G's part (b) is 1617 atm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the a or b value.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should use different units for R. Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. That's correct.

Wait, let me check if the equation uses (n^2 a)/(V^2) or (a n^2)/V^2. Since n=1, it's just a/V^2.

Hmm. Let me make sure I didn't reverse any terms. Oh, wait, no, the equation is correct.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I made a mistake in the a or b value.

Wait, I might have mixed up a and b. Let me think again.

Wait, for CO2, a is in L²·atm/mol², and yes, a=3.658, b=0.04267 L/mol.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the volume used in the equation is in liters, but the van der Waals equation expects it in a different unit? Or perhaps the constants are in different units.

Wait, in the van der Waals equation, the units of V should be consistent with the units of b. Since b is in L/mol, V should be in L.

So no, that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should try another approach. Let's compute part (a) again.

Part (a): V=1.00 L.

RT=0.0821 *273.15=22.411 atm·L/mol.

V - b=1.00 -0.04267=0.95733 L.

So term1=22.411 /0.95733≈?

Let me compute 22.411 /0.95733 more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

0.95733 *23 = ?

23 *0.9 is 20.7.

23 *0.05 is 1.15.

23 *0.00733≈0.1686.

So 20.7+1.15=21.85 +0.1686=22.0186.

So 0.95733 *23=22.0186, which is less than 22.411.

Difference:22.411-22.0186=0.3924.

Now, 0.3924 /0.95733 ≈ 0.4097.

So term1=23.4097 atm.

Term2=3.658 /1=3.658 atm.

Thus P=23.4097 -3.658=19.7517 atm≈19.75 atm.

Looking at the options, option G is 19.79 atm for part (a). That's very close, but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers.

Let me compute RT precisely.

R=0.082057 L·atm/mol·K.

T=273.15 K.

RT=0.082057 *273.15 = let's compute:

0.082057 *273 = ?

0.08 *273=21.84.

0.002057 *273= approx 0.561501.

So 21.84 +0.561501=22.4015.

Then, 0.082057 *0.15=0.01230855.

So total RT=22.4015+0.01230855≈22.4138.

So term1=22.4138 /0.95733.

Compute 22.4138 /0.95733.

Let me use division:

0.95733 *23=22.0186 (as before).

22.4138 -22.0186=0.3952.

0.3952 /0.95733≈0.4127.

So term1=23 +0.4127=23.4127 atm.

Term2=3.658 /1=3.658.

So P=23.4127 -3.658=19.7547 atm, which is approximately 19.75 atm.

The options have G as 19.79 atm, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I should see why this discrepancy exists.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the value of a. Let me double-check the a and b values for CO2.

Upon checking, the van der Waals constants for CO2 are:

a = 3.658 L²·atm/mol²

b = 0.04267 L/mol

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different R value, but I don't think so, since the units are in atm and liters.

Hmm. Maybe I should try the calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written differently. Let me write the van der Waals equation correctly.

The equation is [P + a(n/V)^2](V/n - b) = RT.

Since n=1, it becomes [P + a/V²](V - b) = RT.

Rearranging for P:

P = RT/(V - b) - a/V².

Yes, that's correct.

So for part (a), V=1.00 L.

So term1= RT/(V-b)= 22.4138 / (1 -0.04267)=22.4138/0.95733 ≈23.412 atm.

Term2= a/V²=3.658 /1=3.658 atm.

So P=23.412 -3.658=19.754 atm.

So about 19.75 atm, which is close to option G's 19.79 atm. Hmm. Maybe a rounding difference. Or perhaps a mistake in the a value.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the a value is 3.659 instead of 3.658. So term2 would be 3.659.

So 23.412 -3.659=19.753 atm. Still, option G is 19.79.

Wait, but perhaps I miscalculated term1.

Wait, term1: RT/(V -b)=22.4138 /0.95733.

Let me compute 22.4138 ÷ 0.95733.

I can use long division:

0.95733 ) 22.4138

First, 0.95733 *23=22.01859.

Subtract: 22.4138 -22.01859=0.39521.

Bring down a zero: 3.9521.

0.95733 goes into 3.9521 how many times?

0.95733 *4=3.82932.

Subtract: 3.9521 -3.82932=0.12278.

So so far, it's 23.4 (from 23 + 0.4). Wait, let me think.

Wait, 0.95733 x 23.4 = ?

23 *0.95733=22.01859.

0.4 *0.95733=0.382932.

Total=22.01859 +0.382932=22.401522.

But our term1 is 22.4138. So the difference is 22.4138 -22.401522=0.012278.

So how much more than 23.4?

0.012278 /0.95733≈0.0128.

So term1=23.4 +0.0128≈23.4128 atm.

So term1=23.4128 atm.

So term2=3.658 atm.

P=23.4128 -3.658=19.7548 atm.

So 19.75 atm.

Looking at the options, the closest is G: 19.79 atm, which is 0.035 higher.

Hmm. Maybe the initial a value is slightly different. Alternatively, perhaps there's a calculation mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses R=0.0821 instead of the more precise 0.082057.

If I use R=0.0821:

RT=0.0821 *273.15= 0.0821 *273=22.41 (approx), 0.0821 *0.15=0.012315, so total 22.41 +0.012315=22.4223.

So term1=22.4223 /0.95733≈23.417 atm.

So P=23.417 -3.658=19.759 atm.

Which is 19.76, closer to 19.76.

So perhaps the options rounded to two decimal places, making it 19.76, which would be 19.76 ≈19.79
