Question:

One of the most frequent findings of studies on human beings with “split brains” is that

Options:

A: The right hemisphere is predominantly concerned with verbal information
B: The right hemisphere is predominantly concerned with numeric information
C: aside from the long-known localization of speech functions, the two hemispheres appear to be essentially equivalent as information processors
D: certain kinds of visuospatial tasks are performed beer by the right hemisphere than by the left
E: The two hemispheres appear to have a competitive relationship in information processing
F: the right hemisphere provides backup for the left in some tasks but excels the left in none
G: The left hemisphere is predominantly concerned with handling the body's motor skills
H: The left hemisphere provides backup for the right in some tasks but excels the right in none
I: The left hemisphere predominantly handles emotional processing
J: Both hemispheres are specialized in processing musical information

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about split-brain studies. Hmm, I remember that split-brain studies involve individuals whose corpus callosum has been severed, meaning the two hemispheres of their brain can't communicate. I think this was done to reduce epilepsy seizures or something like that.

The question is asking about one of the most frequent findings from these studies. The options are A through J, each making a different claim about the hemispheres.

I recall that before these studies, it was known that the left hemisphere is usually responsible for language and speech. Like Broca's area and Wernicke's area are on the left. But when the hemispheres are split, each can't communicate, so each processes information independently.

So in the experiments, when they showed images to one hemisphere, the other couldn't know what it was. For example, if an object was shown to the right visual field (processed by the left hemisphere), the person could name it. But if shown to the left visual field (right hemisphere), they couldn't name it verbally. But they might be able to pick it up with their left hand, indicating the right hemisphere knew what it was but couldn't express it in words.

So this suggests that the right hemisphere is better at processing visual and spatial information. I think the right hemisphere is better at tasks like recognizing faces, understanding spatial arrangements, and maybe handling certain types of visual tasks.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Right hemisphere handles verbal info. No, that's the left. So A is incorrect.

B: Right handles numeric info. I don't think numeric is lateralized like that. Maybe the left handles numbers as part of language and math, but I'm not sure. But the question is about a frequent finding, and I think the main point was the right's role in spatial tasks.

C: The hemispheres are equivalent aside from speech. No, because the studies showed clear differences beyond speech, so C is wrong.

D: Certain visuospatial tasks are better done by the right hemisphere. This sounds right. Because when the right hemisphere processed the visual info, the person could perform tasks that needed spatial understanding, even if they couldn't verbalize it.

E: Hemispheres have a competitive relationship. I don't recall this being a main finding. It's more about specialization than competition.

F: Right provides backup but doesn't excel. That doesn't fit with what I remember. The right actually excels in some tasks, so F is incorrect.

G: Left handles motor skills. Well, motor skills are more bilateral, but the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body. But the question is about information processing, not motor skills, so G might not be the best answer.

H: Left provides backup but doesn't excel. No, the left is specialized for certain tasks, so H doesn't fit.

I: Left handles emotional processing. I think the right hemisphere is more involved in emotions, so I is incorrect.

J: Both specialized in music. I'm not sure, but I think music processing is more right-hemisphere dominant, but I don't recall this being a main point of split-brain studies. The key finding was about spatial tasks and language.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be D. The right hemisphere is better at certain visuospatial tasks than the left.

The correct answer is based on the findings from split-brain studies, which demonstrate that the right hemisphere excels in processing visuospatial tasks compared to the left hemisphere. This conclusion aligns with experimental observations where the right hemisphere, despite lacking verbal communication abilities, could effectively handle spatial and visual information independently.

Answer: D
