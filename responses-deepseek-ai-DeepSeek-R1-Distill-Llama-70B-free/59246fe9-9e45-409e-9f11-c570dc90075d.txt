Okay, so I have this problem here about Mrs. Valdez paying property tax and a collection fee. Hmm, let's see. I need to find the assessed valuation of her home. The total charge was $70.62, which includes both the property tax and the collection fee. 

Alright, the property tax rate is 2.432 percent. Wait, that's a bit of an unusual number, but I guess I can work with that. And then there's a collection fee which is 1% of the tax. So the collection fee is calculated based on the tax amount, not the assessed value. Oh right, so first I calculate the tax, then add the fee on top of that.

So the total charge is the sum of the tax and the collection fee. Let me think about how to model this. Let me denote the assessed valuation as AV. 

The property tax would be AV multiplied by 2.432%, which is 0.02432 in decimal. Then, the collection fee is 1% of that tax, so that's 0.01 times the tax amount. So the total charge is tax plus fee, which is tax * (1 + 0.01) = tax * 1.01.

Putting it all together: Total = (AV * 0.02432) * 1.01. And this total is given as $70.62. So I can set up the equation as AV * 0.02432 * 1.01 = 70.62.

I need to solve for AV. So AV = 70.62 / (0.02432 * 1.01). Let's calculate the denominator first.

Calculating 0.02432 * 1.01. Well, 0.02432 times 1 is 0.02432, and 0.02432 times 0.01 is 0.0002432. Adding them together gives 0.02432 + 0.0002432 = 0.0245632. So the denominator is approximately 0.0245632.

Now, AV = 70.62 / 0.0245632. Let me compute that. Hmm, 70.62 divided by 0.0245632. I think I can do this division step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator approach. Let me think: 70.62 divided by 0.0245632. Let's see, 0.0245632 times 2,875 is approximately 70.62? Wait, wait, let me check. Because one of the options is E: $2,875. Let's see if that fits.

Wait, 0.0245632 * 2875 = ?

Let me compute 2875 * 0.0245632.

First, 2875 * 0.02 is 57.5.

2875 * 0.0045632. Let's break that down. 2875 * 0.004 is 11.5. 2875 * 0.0005632 is approximately 2875 * 0.0005 = 1.4375 and 2875 * 0.0000632≈ 0.1816. So total for 0.0045632 is 11.5 +1.4375 +0.1816 ≈ 13.1191.

So adding 57.5 and 13.1191 gives 70.6191, which is approximately 70.62. So that's very close. So AV is $2,875, which is option E.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate the denominator correctly.

Wait, 2.432% tax, which is 0.02432. Then 1% collection fee on tax: fee = 0.01 * (0.02432 AV) = 0.0002432 AV. So total is 0.02432 AV + 0.0002432 AV = (0.02432 + 0.0002432) AV = 0.0245632 AV.

So the equation is 0.0245632 AV =70.62. So AV=70.62 /0.0245632.

Let me compute this division accurately.

70.62 ÷ 0.0245632.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute this as 7062 ÷ 24.5632 (since I'm multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals). Let's see:

24.5632 * 2875 = ?

Wait, I already did that earlier and it came out to approximately 70.62. So 2875 is the AV. So the correct answer is E.

To determine the assessed valuation (AV) of Mrs. Valdez's home, we start by noting that the total charge of $70.62 includes both the property tax and a collection fee. The property tax rate is 2.432%, or 0.02432 in decimal, and the collection fee is 1% of the tax, or 0.01 times the tax amount. 

The total charge can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total} = (\text{AV} \times 0.02432) \times 1.01
\]

Here, \( 1.01 \) accounts for the tax plus the collection fee. Substituting the given total charge:

\[
\text{AV} \times 0.02432 \times 1.01 = 70.62
\]

First, calculate the combined rate:

\[
0.02432 \times 1.01 = 0.0245632
\]

Now, solve for AV:

\[
\text{AV} = \frac{70.62}{0.0245632}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{AV} \approx 2875
\]

To verify, calculate \( 0.0245632 \times 2875 \), which approximates to 70.62, confirming the solution. Thus, the assessed valuation of the home is **$2,875**.
