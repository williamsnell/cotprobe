Okay, so I've got this problem here about hollow and solid shafts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says: A hollow shaft with an outside diameter (OD) of 5 inches is used instead of a solid shaft with a diameter of 3.8 inches. They have the same torsional strength. I need to find the inside diameter of the hollow shaft and the percentage of material saved by weight. The options are from A to J.

Wait, right, torsional strength relates to the polar moment of inertia. I remember that the torsional strength depends on the polar moment of inertia. For a solid shaft, the polar moment J is (π/2) * d^4, where d is the diameter. For a hollow shaft, it's (π/2) * (D^4 - d^4), where D is the outer diameter and d is the inner diameter we're trying to find.

Since both shafts have the same torsional strength, their polar moments should be equal. So I can set the two expressions equal to each other.

So, for the solid shaft: J_solid = (π/2) * (3.8)^4.

For the hollow shaft: J_hollow = (π/2) * (5^4 - d^4), where d is the inside diameter.

Setting them equal: (3.8)^4 = 5^4 - d^4.

Wait, the (π/2) cancels out on both sides, so I can ignore that part.

So, d^4 = 5^4 - (3.8)^4.

Let me calculate the values step by step.

5^4 is 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. So 625.

3.8^4: Let's compute 3.8 squared first. 3.8 *3.8 = let's see, 3*3=9, 3*0.8=2.4, 0.8*3=2.4, 0.8^2=0.64. So 9 + 2.4 + 2.4 + 0.64 = 14.44. So 3.8^2 is 14.44. Then, 14.44 squared is what? Let me compute that.

14^2 is 196. 0.44^2 is 0.1936. The cross term is 2*14*0.44 = 12.32. So (14.44)^2 = (14 + 0.44)^2 = 196 + 12.32 + 0.1936 = 208.5136. So 3.8^4 is 208.5136.

So d^4 = 625 - 208.5136 = 416.4864.

Taking the fourth root of 416.4864. Hmm, let me think about that. Let's see, 4.5^4 is 4.5 *4.5=20.25, 20.25 *4.5=91.125, 91.125 *4.5=410.0625. Oh, that's close to 416.4864.

Wait, 4.5^4 is 410.06, which is less than 416.48. So maybe 4.5 inches is a bit low. Let me try 4.6^4.

4.6^4: 4.6 squared is 21.16. Then 21.16 squared is what? Let's compute that. 20^2 is 400, 1.16^2 is about 1.3456. The cross term is 2*20*1.16=46.4, so (21.16)^2 is approximately 400 +46.4 +1.3456=447.7456. So 4.6^4 is 447.7456, which is larger than 416.4864. So the ID is between 4.5 and 4.6 inches.

Wait, but the options given don't have that. Let me look at the options again. The options for the inside diameter are around 4.0 to 4.7 inches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate the fourth power of 3.8 correctly.

Wait, 3.8^2 is 14.44 as before. Then, 3.8^4 is (3.8^2)^2 = (14.44)^2. Let me compute 14.44 *14.44 again more accurately.

14 *14 =196, 14*.44=6.16, .44*14=6.16, .44*.44=0.1936.

Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly:

14.44 * 14.44:

14 *14 = 196

14 *.44 = 6.16 (so two times that: 2*14*.44=12.32)

.44 * .44 = 0.1936.

So adding all together: 196 + 12.32 + 0.1936 = 208.5136. So that's correct as before.

So 3.8^4 is 208.5136.

So d^4 = 625 - 208.5136 = 416.4864.

So d is the fourth root of ≈416.4864.

Let me see, 4.5^4 is 410.0625, as before. 416.4864-410.0625=6.4239. So it's 6.42 higher than 4.5^4.

Let me compute 4.55^4. Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the fourth root numerically.

Let me compute 4.5^4 = 410.0625.

Let me try 4.5^4 = 410.0625.

We need to find x where x^4 =416.4864, and x is between 4.5 and 4.6.

Let me compute (4.5 + delta)^4 = 416.4864.

Let me expand (4.5 + delta)^4 using binomial expansion.

But perhaps it's easier to compute for x=4.5, x=4.55, etc.

Wait, x=4.5: 410.0625.

x=4.55: 4.55^4.

Hmm, let me compute 4.55^2 first.

4.55^2 = (4 + 0.55)^2 ≈ 16 + 4.4 + 0.3025 = 20.7025.

Wait, 4.55 *4.55: 4*4=16, 4*.55=2.2, .55*4=2.2, .55*.55=0.3025. So 16 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 0.3025=20.7025.

Then, (4.55)^4 is (20.7025)^2. Let me compute that.

20^2 =400, 0.7025^2 ≈0.4938. The cross term is 2*20*0.7025=28.05. So total ≈400 +28.05 +0.4938=428.5438.

So 4.55^4 is ≈428.54, which is higher than 416.4864.

Hmm, so 4.5^4 is 410.06, 4.55^4 is 428.54. We need 416.4864.

The difference between 4.5 and 4.55 is 0.05.

We can find how much delta is needed between 4.5 and 4.55 to reach 416.4864.

The target is at 416.4864 -410.0625=6.4239 above 4.5^4.

The range between 4.5 (410.06) and 4.55 (428.54) is 18.48.

So the fraction is 6.4239 / 18.48 ≈ 0.3477.

So delta is 0.3477 *0.05 ≈0.0174. So x≈4.5+0.0174=4.5174 inches.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.5174 inches. Let me look again.

Looking at the options:

A:4.4 in

B:4.5

C:3.9

D:4.7

E:4.0

F:4.2

G:4.1

H:4.25

I:4.6

J:4.33

So the closest is 4.5 or 4.33. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made an error in my calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of the fourth powers. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it step by step more accurately.

Wait, maybe I can compute d^4=416.4864.

Let me take the square root twice.

First, sqrt(416.4864) is about 20.415.

Then, sqrt(20.415) is about 4.52 inches. Because 4.5^2=20.25, 4.52^2= (4.5 +0.02)^2= 20.25 + 0.2*0.02*2 + 0.02^2=20.25+0.008 +0.0004=20.2584. Hmm, wait, no, that's for 4.52 squared. But I need the square root of 20.415.

Wait, no, the first square root of 416.4864 is approx 20.415.

Then square-rooting that, let's compute sqrt(20.415).

I know that 4.5^2=20.25, 4.52^2=(4.5+0.02)^2=4.5² + 2*(4.5)(0.02) +0.02²=20.25 + 0.18 + 0.0004=20.4304.

Wait, so 4.52^2=20.4304, which is a bit higher than 20.415. So the square root of 20.415 is just a little under 4.52 inches. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me use linear approximation. Let me take f(x)=x², and I know that at x=4.52, f(x)=20.4304. I need to find x where f(x)=20.415. The difference is 20.4304 -20.415=0.0154. The derivative f’(x)=2x. At x=4.52, f’(x)=9.04. So delta_x ≈ (0.0154)/9.04 ≈0.0017. So x≈4.52 -0.0017=4.5183 inches.

So the inside diameter d is approximately 4.5183 inches.

Looking back at the options, the closest option is J:4.33 in, but that's too low. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Because 4.33 is lower than 4.5, which would give a larger polar moment. Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, the only one that's close to 4.5 is option B:4.5 in. But then the percentage saved might not match. But let's proceed.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the polar moments. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the ratio of the polar moments.

Since for the same torsional strength, J_hollow = J_solid.

So,

(π/2)(D^4 - d^4) = (π/2) d_solid^4.

So D^4 - d^4 = (d_solid)^4.

Wait, D is 5 inches, and d_solid is 3.8 inches.

So,

5^4 - d^4 = 3.8^4.

So,

d^4 = 5^4 -3.8^4 =625 - 208.5136=416.4864.

So d= (416.4864)^(1/4).

Let me compute this using logarithms.

ln(416.4864)=?

Well, I can compute ln(400)=5.991, ln(416)= approx 6.025.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Or perhaps use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 4.5^4=410.0625 and 4.6^4=?

Wait, 4.6^4: Let me compute 4.6 squared first: 4.6 *4.6 =21.16.

Then, 21.16 squared is 447.7456.

So 4.6^4=447.7456.

Wait, but our d^4 is 416.4864, which is between 4.5^4 (410.06) and 4.6^4 (447.74).

So the inside diameter is between 4.5 and 4.6 inches.

Wait, but the options don't have anything between 4.5 and 4.6 except perhaps option I:4.6 in, but that would give a lower d^4, which would make J_hollow less than J_solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check.

Wait, for the solid shaft, the polar moment is (π/2)*(d_solid/2)^4 *4, wait no. Wait, the formula for polar moment of inertia for a solid shaft is (π/2)*(d)^4, where d is diameter. For a hollow shaft, it's (π/2)*(D^4 - d^4), where D is the outer diameter, d is inner.

So yes, the setup is correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have 4.5 or 4.51. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, maybe the problem is about weight saving, so perhaps I should compute the cross-sectional area.

Wait, the percentage material saved by weight would be based on the area difference, since weight is proportional to area (assuming same material density).

So, area saved is (Area_solid - Area_hollow)/Area_solid *100%.

Area_solid is π*( (3.8/2)^2 )= π*(1.9)^2= π*3.61.

Area_hollow is π*( (5/2)^2 - (d/2)^2 )= π*(2.5^2 - (d/2)^2 )= π*(6.25 - (d²/4)).

So, the saved area is [3.61π - (6.25 - (d²/4))π ] / (3.61π) *100.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the solid shaft's area is π*(1.9)^2=3.61π.

The hollow shaft's area is π*(2.5^2 - (d/2)^2 )= π*(6.25 - (d²/4)).

So the area saved would be (3.61π - (6.25 - (d²/4))π ) / (3.61π) ) *100.

But wait, that would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, because the hollow shaft's area is larger than the solid's? No, wait, the solid shaft is 3.8" diameter, so area π*(1.9)^2=3.61π. The hollow shaft's area is π*( (2.5)^2 - (d/2)^2 ), which depends on d. For example, if d is 4", then (2")^2=4, so 6.25-4=2.25; area is 2.25π, which is less than 3.61π, so area saved is (3.61 -2.25)/3.61 *100≈37.7%.

Wait, but in this problem, the hollow shaft is replacing the solid shaft. So the hollow shaft needs to have the same strength, which is why we're finding the inside diameter.

So the area of the hollow shaft will be less than the solid shaft's area, hence saving material.

Wait, let me compute the areas.

Once I have the inner diameter, I can compute the area saved.

But perhaps I should proceed in steps.

First, find the inner diameter.

Earlier, I found that d ≈4.518 inches.

Looking at the options, none of them are exactly 4.518. But let me check the options again.

Wait, option J is 4.33 inches.

Wait, that's lower than 4.5, which would make the polar moment larger than needed, right?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a calculation mistake. Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute 4.5^4: 4.5 *4.5=20.25, 20.25*4.5=91.125, 91.125*4.5=410.0625.

Our target is 416.4864.

So 416.4864-410.0625=6.4239.

Each increment of 0.01 in d would increase d^4 by approximately how much? The derivative of d^4 is 4d^3.

At d=4.5, d^3=91.125, so 4*d^3=364.5.

So, delta_d ≈ delta_value / (4d^3) =6.4239 /364.5≈0.0176 inches.

So d≈4.5 +0.0176≈4.5176 inches.

So approximately 4.5176 inches.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option H:4.25, which is way lower, or option I:4.6. But 4.6 is higher than 4.5176. Maybe the correct option is not present, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The problem states that the hollow shaft's OD is 5 inches, and the solid shaft has a diameter of 3.8 inches, same torsional strength.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum shear stress. Torsional strength relates to the maximum shear stress, which is given by T = (r * J)/(I), where I is the polar moment.

Wait, no, the maximum shear stress in a shaft is τ_max = (T * r) / J, where r is the
