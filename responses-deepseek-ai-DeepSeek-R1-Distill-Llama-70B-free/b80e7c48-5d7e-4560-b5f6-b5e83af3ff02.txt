Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Fei Yen’s dog eats 8 ounces of dog food each day. Fei Yen bought a 28-pound bag of dog food. The question is asking how many 8-ounce servings are in a 28-pound bag. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

Hmm, right. So the key here is to convert pounds to ounces because the serving size is in ounces. I remember that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces. So I need to figure out how many ounces are in 28 pounds.

Let me calculate that. If 1 pound is 16 ounces, then 28 pounds would be 28 multiplied by 16. Let me do that multiplication. 28 times 16... Well, 20 times 16 is 320, and 8 times 16 is 128. Adding those together, 320 + 128 equals 448. So 28 pounds is 448 ounces.

Now, the bag has 448 ounces of dog food. Each serving is 8 ounces. So to find out how many servings are in the bag, I need to divide the total ounces by the serving size. That would be 448 divided by 8.

Let me do that division. 448 ÷ 8. Well, 8 times 50 is 400. Subtract 400 from 448, that leaves 48. 8 goes into 48 exactly 6 times. So 50 plus 6 is 56. So 448 divided by 8 is 56.

Wait, but wait a second. The options don't have 56 as the first thought. Let me check the options again. Looking back, option G is 56. So that would be the answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I might mix up pounds and ounces.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion. Let me double-check. Since 1 pound is 16 ounces, 28 pounds would be 28 * 16. Let me calculate 28 * 16 again. 20*16=320, 8*16=128. 320+128=448. That's correct. Then 448 divided by 8 is indeed 56. So option G is 56, which should be the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: the question is asking for how many 8-ounce servings are in a 28-pound bag. So each serving is for one day, but the question is about the number of servings, not the number of days. So actually, the number of servings is the same as the number of days the dog can be fed, but the problem just wants the count of 8-ounce portions, which is the same as the total ounces divided by 8, so 56 is correct. So I think I'm confident that G is the correct answer.

The problem requires converting pounds to ounces and then determining the number of 8-ounce servings. 

1. **Convert pounds to ounces**:  
   Since 1 pound = 16 ounces,  
   28 pounds = 28 × 16 = 448 ounces.  

2. **Calculate the number of servings**:  
   Each serving is 8 ounces, so the number of servings is:  
   448 ÷ 8 = 56.  

Thus, the correct answer is **G: 56**.
