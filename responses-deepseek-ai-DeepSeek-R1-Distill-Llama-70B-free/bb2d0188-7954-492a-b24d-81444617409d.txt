Okay, so I've got this question about Epicurus and his views on wealth. I remember Epicurus was a Greek philosopher, part of the Epicurean school. From what I've read, Epicureanism is often misunderstood as being about indulgence, but actually, it's more about moderation and the absence of physical pain and mental distress.

The question is asking about the wealth required for a good life according to Epicurus. The options are A through J. Let me think about what I know about his philosophy. Epicurus believed that a good life is one where you have your basic needs met, and you're free from fear and bodily pain. He didn't advocate for extreme luxury. Instead, he thought that once your basic needs are satisfied, additional wealth doesn't really contribute to happiness. So, he probably didn't think that you need a lot of money to be happy.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with that. Let's go through them:

A: Easily procured. That makes sense because if basic needs are simple, then the wealth needed isn't hard to get. But I'm not sure if that's the exact point.

B: Available only to the educated. I don't recall Epicurus linking wealth to education specifically. It's more about the state of being than education.

C: Available only to the rich. That seems opposite because the rich might have more than they need, which Epicurus would say isn't necessary.

D: Obtained only through material possessions. No, because Epicurus didn't emphasize materialism beyond basic needs.

E: Achievable only through constant labor and struggle. That doesn't fit because he'd probably say that once you have enough, you don't need to keep struggling.

F: Attainable for everyone, but only through great effort. I'm not sure. He might say it's attainable, but maybe not requiring great effort beyond meeting basic needs.

G: Gained only through inheritance or luck. No, because he's more about self-sufficiency.

H: Not necessary for a good life. Wait, that's an interesting option. If wealth isn't necessary, but perhaps he thinks some level is needed. Or maybe he thinks that true wealth is not material but in other things. But wait, Epicurus did say that some wealth is necessary, but not excessive. So maybe this isn't correct because he does think some level of wealth is needed.

I: Available only to the gods. No, that's not right.

J: Requiring a lifetime of pursuit. No, because he's against excessive accumulation.

So, between A and H. Wait, what's the exact question? The question is about "the wealth required for a good life". So according to Epicurus, you need some wealth, but not a lot. So the idea is that the required wealth is easily obtainable because you don't need much. So option A says "easily procured", which fits.

Wait, but another angle. Epicurus might have said that the necessary wealth is easy to get because it's just basic needs. So A makes sense.

Alternatively, option H says wealth isn't necessary. But I think he did think that some level of wealth is necessary, just not in excess. So H is probably not correct.

So the answer should be A: easily procured.

The answer is A. According to Epicurus, the wealth required for a good life is easily procured because it aligns with his philosophy that basic needs are simple and sufficient for happiness, without requiring excessive accumulation.

Answer: A
