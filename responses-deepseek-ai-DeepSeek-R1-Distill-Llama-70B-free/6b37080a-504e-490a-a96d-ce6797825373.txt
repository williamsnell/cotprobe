Okay, so I need to figure out when the Babylonian captivity, also known as the Exile, began. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my ancient history, but let me think this through.

I remember that the Babylonian captivity was a significant event in Jewish history. It happened when the Babylonians conquered the Kingdom of Judah. From what I recall, the Babylonians were under King Nebuchadnezzar II at that time. He besieged Jerusalem and eventually destroyed the First Temple.

Wait, when did that happen? I think it was around the 6th century BCE. I remember learning that the destruction of the Temple was in 586 BCE. But wait, was that the start of the exile or the end? Because sometimes the exile is considered to have started a bit earlier with the first deportations.

Oh right! The Babylonians took Jews captive in waves. The first deportation might have been around 597 BCE, but the main destruction was in 586. So the exile began in 597, but the final fall was in 586. However, the question is about when the captivity began, so maybe the first deportation.

Looking at the options, I see G is 586 BCE and J is 70 BCE. Wait, 70 BCE is way later, that's more around the time of the Roman period. 586 is during the Babylonian period.

Wait, another angle: the traditional date given for the start of the exile is 586 BCE because that's when the Temple was destroyed. So the captivity began then. But I might be confusing the start with the major event.

Alternatively, some sources say the first exile happened in 597 when Nebuchadnezzar took King Jehoiachin and many others to Babylon. So the captivity began then, but the final exile was in 586.

But the question is about when the Babylonian captivity began. So the initial deportation was 597, but maybe the options donâ€™t have that. Let me check the options again.

The options are: A: 333, B: 1066, C:535, D:515, E:1914, F:1492, G:586, H:722, I:70, J:70 BCE.

Hmm, 722 BCE is when the Assyrians took the Northern Kingdom, Israel, into captivity. So that's a different exile, the Assyrian captivity.

So the Babylonian exile was later. So the options are G:586 and perhaps another. Since 597 isn't an option, but 586 is G. So probably, the answer is G:586 BCE.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the exile is dated from the first deportation in 597, but the major event is 586. So I think the question is referring to when the main exile started, which is 586.

So I'll go with G:586 BCE.

The Babylonian captivity, or Exile, began in 586 BCE when the Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar II, destroyed Jerusalem and the First Temple, leading to the deportation of the Jews to Babylon. This event marked the start of the exile, even though there were earlier deportations, such as in 597 BCE. Among the provided options, 586 BCE corresponds to the traditional date for the beginning of the Babylonian captivity.

G: 586 BCE

Answer: G
