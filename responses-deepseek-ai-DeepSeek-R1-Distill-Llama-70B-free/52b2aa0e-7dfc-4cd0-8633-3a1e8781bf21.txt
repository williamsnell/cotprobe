Question:

List and compare the tissues that support and hold together theother tissues of the body.

Options:

A: Connective tissue is a single group of tissues that encapsulates organs without providing structural support.
B: The only function of connective tissue is to transport nutrients throughout the body.
C: Connective tissue is divided into two groups: bone and cartilage.
D: Connective tissue includes three types: muscle, nerve, and epithelial tissues.
E: Connective tissue is mainly composed of fluids and lacks solid structures like bone or cartilage.
F: Connective tissue functions to support and hold together structures of the body. They are classified into four groups by structure and/or function: bone, cartilage, blood, and fibrous connective tissue.
G: Connective tissue is categorized into five groups: bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous connective tissue, and adipose tissue.
H: Fibrous connective tissue doesn't contribute to the support and holding of other tissues.
I: Connective tissue only supports other tissues, it doesn't hold them together.
J: Connective tissues are not classified; all connective tissues have the same function and structure.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about connective tissues. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through what I remember from my biology class.

The question is asking about the tissues that support and hold together other tissues in the body. I remember that connective tissue is a key player here. Connective tissue does a few things: it supports other tissues, binds them together, and also provides structure. So the question is about identifying which option correctly lists and compares these tissues.

Looking at the options:

Option A says connective tissue encapsulates organs without providing structural support. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought connective tissue does provide support. Like bones are a type of connective tissue, right? So A must be wrong.

Option B claims the only function is to transport nutrients. No, that's not it. Blood is a connective tissue and it does transport, but connective tissue as a whole does more than that. It also includes structures like bone and cartilage which don't transport nutrients. So B is incorrect.

Option C divides connective tissue into bone and cartilage. But I remember there are more types. Like blood and fibrous connective tissue. So C is missing some categories, making it wrong.

Option D says connective tissue includes muscle, nerve, and epithelial. Wait, no. Muscle and nerve are separate tissue types. Epithelial is another primary tissue. So D is definitely wrong.

Option E states it's mainly fluids without solid structures. Hmm, no. Connective tissue includes bone, which is solid. So E is incorrect.

Option F says connective tissue is classified into four groups: bone, cartilage, blood, and fibrous. That rings a bell. I think fibrous connective tissue is like tendons and ligaments. So F seems correct so far.

Option G includes five groups, adding adipose tissue. Oh right, I think adipose (fat tissue) is a type of connective tissue too. So G has five categories: bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous, and adipose. Wait, but the question is about tissues that support and hold together others. Does adipose do that? Well, adipose does provide some cushioning, which is a form of support. So maybe G is correct?

Wait, the question is about listing and comparing the tissues that support and hold together other tissues. So I need to see which option correctly classifies the connective tissues.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Connective tissue is one of the four primary tissues. The others are epithelial, muscle, and nervous. Connective tissue has various types. From what I remember, the main types are:

1. Connective tissue proper (like fibrous, adipose)
2. Bone
3. Cartilage
4. Blood

So that's four types. But some classifications include adipose as a separate category. So in some sources, it's considered a subtype of connective tissue proper, but in others, it's its own category. So option F lists four groups, which includes all except maybe adipose. Option G says five, including adipose.

Wait the question's options: F says four groups, G says five. So which is correct? Let me recall my notes.

In my textbook, connective tissue is divided into:

- Connective tissue proper (which includes loose and dense connective tissue, like areolar, dense regular, etc., and also adipose tissue)
- Bone
- Cartilage
- Blood

So if connective tissue proper includes adipose, then the four main types would be bone, cartilage, blood, and connective tissue proper (which includes fibrous and adipose). So option F says bone, cartilage, blood, and fibrous connective tissue. But fibrous is part of connective tissue proper. So F's classification would miss adipose unless it's included in fibrous. Alternatively, if F lists 'fibrous connective tissue' as a separate group, does that exclude adipose?

Wait, the question is about whether the option correctly lists the types. If F includes fibrous as one group, but doesn't mention adipose, then maybe it's incomplete. Because adipose is a distinct type, right?

Alternatively, maybe the question isn't including adipose in the main four. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think of another approach.

The question is about which option correctly lists and compares the tissues that support and hold together other tissues. So which option is accurate in its classification.

Option F: four groups (bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous CT). Option G: five groups, including adipose.

In the context of the question, which is about supporting and holding, I think adipose (fat) tissue does contribute by providing cushioning and support. So if the classification includes adipose as a separate group, then G would be correct.

Wait, but I remember that sometimes adipose is considered a subset of connective tissue proper. So whether it's a separate group or a subgroup might affect the answer. If the question's options include G as five groups, but the correct classification is four groups with connective tissue proper including adipose, then F might be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's the four main types: bone, cartilage, blood, and fibrous (which includes connective tissue proper, including adipose). But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option F says it's classified into four groups: bone, cartilage, blood, and fibrous connective tissue. So that includes all four types, and fibrous would encompass things like tendons and ligaments, and perhaps adipose as well. Or maybe not, because sometimes fibrous is just the supportive, fibrous parts, and adipose is a separate category.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, which includes all five. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what each option says.

Option F: four groups (bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous). This includes all types except perhaps adipose if it's a separate group.

Option G: five groups, adding adipose. So which is correct?

Wait, I think that connective tissue is typically classified into four types: connective tissue proper (which includes fibrous and adipose), bone, cartilage, and blood. So if the option includes these four, but groups them differently, that would be correct.

Alternatively, option G says five groups, which would include connective tissue proper as one, and adipose as another, but I'm not sure if that's how it's classified.

Wait, another approach: the question is about supporting and holding together other tissues. Let's see what each option says.

Option F: functions to support and hold together structures. They are classified into four groups. So that fits because all four types (bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous) contribute to support and structure.

Option G includes five, adding adipose. So if the question includes adipose as a separate group, then G is correct. But I'm not sure if the standard classification includes it as a separate group or as a subtype.

I think in most classifications, connective tissue is divided into four categories: connective tissue proper (including adipose), bone, cartilage, and blood. So option F doesn't list connective tissue proper as a separate group but lists fibrous. Hmm, perhaps that's a confusion.

Wait, option F says 'fibrous connective tissue' as a separate group. But 'fibrous' is a type of connective tissue proper. So if F includes fibrous as a group, it might not include adipose. So perhaps F is incomplete and G is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it correctly lists the four main types, considering that fibrous includes other supportive tissues.

Wait, another thought: the question asks to list and compare tissues that support and hold together others. So which option correctly lists them.

Option F says four groups: bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous. So that includes all the main supportive tissues. Adipose (fat) is more about storage and cushioning, which is a type of support but perhaps not the primary holding together function.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is F because it's the standard classification into four types. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, looking back, option G says five groups, including bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous, and adipose. So if the correct classification includes all five, then G is correct.

But I'm a bit confused because different sources might group things differently. I think the more accurate classification includes five types when considering adipose as a separate category. So perhaps G is correct.

Wait, but another angle: the options. Option F says "four groups by structure and/or function: bone, cartilage, blood, and fibrous connective tissue." So if fibrous CT includes things like tendons, ligaments, and maybe even adipose, then F would encompass all. But if adipose is a separate group, then F is missing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's the standard four, and G is incorrect.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I think I need to make a decision based on what I know.

I believe that connective tissue is divided into four main types: connective tissue proper (which includes fibrous and adipose), bone, cartilage, and blood. So if an option includes these four, that's correct. But option F includes fibrous as a separate group, which may or may not include adipose.

Wait, option F says 'fibrous connective tissue' as a separate group. If 'fibrous' is a subset of connective tissue proper, then perhaps F is correct in listing four groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it correctly identifies the four main types, and G is incorrect because it adds an extra category (adipose) that's part of connective tissue proper.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: looking at the functions. Option F says the function is to support and hold together, which is correct. Option G also lists five types but doesn't contradict the function.

Wait, the question is about which option correctly lists and compares the tissues. So if the correct classification includes all four main types, then F is correct. If it includes five, then G is correct.

I think I'll go with option F because it correctly lists the four main types, and option G includes an extra category that might not be necessary in the main classification. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and G is correct because it includes all five types.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each option says. Option F includes 'fibrous connective tissue' as a category. Fibrous CT is a type of connective tissue proper, which includes various tissues like tendons and ligaments. Adipose is another type within connective tissue proper. So perhaps option F is missing adipose, making G correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option F includes all connective tissues under 'fibrous', which is not accurate because adipose is distinct.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for other clues in the options.

Looking at option F: it says the function is to support and hold together, which is correct. It classifies into four groups. If those four groups are the main ones, then F is correct.

Alternatively, if the classification includes five, then G is correct.

Wait, I think I remember that connective tissue is divided into four types: connective tissue proper, bone, cartilage, and blood. So that's four. So option F includes fibrous connective tissue, which is part of connective tissue proper. So perhaps F is correct because it lists four groups, including fibrous as a separate group, but that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it correctly lists four groups, including fibrous as a category, and G is incorrect because it adds adipose as a fifth group which is part of connective tissue proper.

I'm going to go with option F as the correct answer because it lists four main groups, which seems to align with the standard classification, even though I'm a bit unsure about the inclusion of adipose.

The question asks about the tissues that support and hold together other tissues in the body, focusing on connective tissue. Connective tissue is one of the four primary tissue types and plays a crucial role in supporting, binding, and providing structure to the body. The key is to identify the option that correctly classifies and describes the types of connective tissue.

- **Option A** is incorrect because connective tissue does provide structural support, such as through bones and cartilage.
- **Option B** is incorrect because connective tissue has multiple functions, including support and structure, not just nutrient transport.
- **Option C** is incorrect because it only includes bone and cartilage, missing other types like blood and fibrous connective tissue.
- **Option D** is incorrect because muscle, nerve, and epithelial tissues are separate categories, not part of connective tissue.
- **Option E** is incorrect because connective tissue includes solid structures like bone.
- **Option F** correctly identifies four main groups of connective tissue: bone, cartilage, blood, and fibrous connective tissue. This aligns with the standard classification, where fibrous connective tissue encompasses supportive structures like tendons and ligaments.
- **Option G** includes five groups, adding adipose tissue as a separate category. While adipose tissue is part of connective tissue, it is often classified as a subtype of connective tissue proper rather than a distinct group in the main classification.
- **Option H** is incorrect because fibrous connective tissue does contribute to support and holding tissues together.
- **Option I** is incorrect because connective tissue both supports and holds tissues together.
- **Option J** is incorrect because connective tissues are classified into distinct types based on structure and function.

The standard classification of connective tissue includes four main types: bone, cartilage, blood, and connective tissue proper (which includes fibrous and adipose tissues). Option F accurately reflects this classification, making it the correct answer.
