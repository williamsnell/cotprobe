Okay, so I've got this question here about statistics and measures of central tendency. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a radio station that's trying to estimate the typical contribution from their supporters during a fund drive. They took a sample of 30 supporters and found out that 22 gave $60, six gave $1,000, and two gave $10,000. Theyâ€™re asking which measure of central tendency would be most useful for the radio station.

Hmm, first, I need to remember what the different measures of central tendency are. There's the mean, median, mode, and sometimes people talk about the range or standard deviation, but those are more measures of spread, not central tendency. Wait, the question specifically says "measures of central tendency," so I can probably focus on mean, median, and mode.

In this case, the data is skewed because most people gave a small amount ($60), but a few gave a lot more. So the mean might be higher than what's typical because of those large contributions. The mode is the most common value, which here is $60 because 22 out of 30 gave that. The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. Let me think about that.

If I line up all 30 contributions, the median would be the average of the 15th and 16th values. Since 22 people gave $60, the first 22 data points are $60. So the 15th and 16th are both $60, making the median $60 as well. Wait, so the median and mode are both $60 here.

But the question is about the most useful measure for the radio station. They want to estimate the 'typical' contribution. The mean would be (22*60 + 6*1000 + 2*10000)/30. Let me calculate that quickly. 22*60 is 1320, 6*1000 is 6000, 2*10000 is 20,000. So total is 1320 + 6000 = 7320 + 20,000 = 27,320. Divided by 30, that's 914 approximately. So the mean is around $914. But the median is $60. 

Wait, that's a huge difference. So the radio station is probably more interested in the typical amount people contribute. If they use the mean, it's higher because of the two $10,000 donations. But most people gave $60, so the median and mode both reflect that. 

But the question is which measure is most useful. The mean would show the average, but in this context, the radio station might care more about what a typical supporter gives. If they're planning their budget based on typical donations, using the mean might give them an overly optimistic estimate because it's skewed by the large donations. The median would better represent the middle point, but in this case, since most are $60, the median is actually the same as the mode. Hmm.

Alternatively, sometimes the median is less affected by outliers than the mean. Since the two $10,000 donations are outliers, the median would give a better sense of central tendency without being skewed. But in this case, both the median and mode are $60. 

Wait, but the mean is $914, which is way higher. So using the mean might make the radio station think they can expect around $900 per supporter, but the reality is that most give $60. So for planning, knowing that the median is $60 is more useful because it's more representative of the typical supporter's contribution.

So the options are, looking back, the question lists the options as A: Range, B: Variance, C: Standard Deviation, D: Median, E: Frequency Distribution, F: Histogram, G: Quartiles, H: Mode, I: ANOVA, J: Mean.

The question is about central tendency, so D, H, and J are the ones. So which is the best measure here. The mode is $60, which is the most common. The median is also $60, and the mean is $914. 

But the radio station wants to estimate the typical contribution. So knowing that most people give $60, the mode tells them that $60 is the most common. But the median, which is also $60, tells them that half the people gave $60 or less, and half gave more. Wait, but in this sample, actually, the first 22 are $60, so the 15th is 60 and the 16th is also 60, so the median is exactly 60. So the median and mode are both 60. But the mean is higher.

So which would be more useful? Well, if the station wants to know what amount is typical, both the median and mode suggest $60. But the mean is higher because of the high values. So the question is which measure would be most useful.

Wait, but the median is a measure of central tendency, and in cases of skewed data, it's often preferred over the mean. So in this case, the median would give a better idea of the central point than the mean. But the mode is also useful because it shows the most common value. 

So the options are D (median) and H (mode). The question is which one is more useful. The radio station might be interested in the average donation (mean), but that's misleading here. Or perhaps the median, which is unaffected by the high values, gives a better sense of the middle.

Alternatively, the mode tells them what the most common donation is, which is $60. So if they're trying to estimate the 'typical' supporter's contribution, maybe the mode is more useful because it shows what most people are giving. But the median also shows the middle value, which in this case is the same as the mode.

Wait, but in this specific sample, the median and mode are the same. So which one would provide the most useful information? Well, the median is a better representation of the data's center when there are outliers. So if the data is skewed, median is better than mean. But the mode is showing the most frequent. So for understanding the 'typical' supporter, the mode might be more intuitive. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the frequency distribution is more useful, but that's not a measure of central tendency. The question specifically asks for a measure of central tendency. So the options are mean, median, or mode. 

In this case, the median is $60, the mode is $60, and the mean is $914. So the radio station would probably find the median more useful than the mean because the mean is skewed by the large donations. But the mode is also $60. 

Wait, but the question is about which measure provides the most useful information. The median is a measure of central tendency that's robust to outliers, so it's better in this case. The mean doesn't represent the typical supporter because it's skewed. The mode tells them the most common, which is also $60. So which is more useful? 

Hmm. Maybe the median is better because it gives a point where half are below and half above. But in this case, since most data points are at $60, the median is also at $60. So both median and mode are $60. 

Wait, but the question is about the "most useful information." If they use the median, they know that half the donors gave $60 or less, and half gave more. But in reality, 22 out of 30 gave exactly $60, so actually, 22 are at $60, then 6 at $1000, 2 at $10k. So the median is 15th and 16th observations, which are both $60. So the median is $60, same as the mode. 

So in this case, both measures are the same. But which one is more useful? I'm a bit stuck. 

Wait, the question gives the sample data, and the radio station wants to estimate the 'typical' supporter's contribution. The mean is skewed, so it's not a good measure. The median and mode both suggest $60. 

But which of these is a better measure? The median is a better measure of central tendency when data is skewed. So the correct answer would be D: Median. 

Wait, but the mode is also a measure of central tendency. So which one is more useful? The mode shows the most common value, which might be more intuitive for understanding what's typical. But the median gives a better central point. 

I think I'm overcomplicating. In cases with highly skewed data, the median is a better measure than the mean. So the radio station should use the median to get a more accurate estimate of the typical contribution. So the answer is D: Median.

The question involves a listener-sponsored radio station that wants to estimate the typical contribution from supporters during a fund drive. The sample data shows that 22 out of 30 supporters gave $60, 6 gave $1,000, and 2 gave $10,000. The task is to determine which measure of central tendency would provide the most useful information.

### Analysis of the Data:
1. **Mean**: The mean is calculated as the total contributions divided by the number of supporters. Here, the mean is approximately $914. However, this value is heavily skewed by the two $10,000 donations, making it less representative of the "typical" contribution.

2. **Median**: The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. With 30 data points, the median is the average of the 15th and 16th values. Since the first 22 values are $60, both the 15th and 16th values are $60, making the median $60. This measure is less affected by outliers and better represents the central tendency in this skewed dataset.

3. **Mode**: The mode is the most frequently occurring value, which is $60 in this case. This measure highlights the most common contribution but does not provide information about the distribution of values around it.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Range (A)** and **Standard Deviation (C)** are measures of spread, not central tendency, and are not relevant to the question.
- **Frequency Distribution (E)** and **Histogram (F)** are tools for displaying data but are not measures of central tendency.
- **Quartiles (G)** provide information about the spread of data but are not measures of central tendency.
- **ANOVA (I)** is a statistical test for comparing means across groups and is irrelevant here.
- **Mean (J)** is a measure of central tendency but is skewed by outliers in this dataset, making it less useful.
- **Median (D)** and **Mode (H)** are both measures of central tendency. The median ($60) is robust to outliers and represents the middle value, while the mode ($60) represents the most common value. However, the median provides a better sense of the data's center and is less affected by skewness.

### Conclusion:
In this context, the median is the most useful measure of central tendency because it is less influenced by the large donations and better represents the typical contribution. While the mode also indicates $60, the median provides a more comprehensive understanding of the data's central tendency.
