Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles, and both piles had an equal number of pins. So, he split them right down the middle, each pile having the same amount. Let me note that down: total pins = 2 × number of pins in one pile.

Then, he gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. Hmm, that's a bit more complex. Let me break it down. So, he takes one pile, divides it into thirds, takes one of those thirds, and then gives half of that third to his brother. Wait, no, maybe I misread that. Let me see.

Wait, it's one-half of one-third of one pile. So, perhaps he takes a third of one pile and then gives half of that third to his brother. Or maybe it's (one-half) multiplied by (one-third of one pile). Let me think. Let me represent it mathematically.

Let me denote the original number of pins as T. Since he split them into two equal piles, each pile has T/2 pins.

He gave his brother (1/2) of (1/3) of one pile. So, the pile is T/2 pins. One-third of that pile would be (1/3) * (T/2) = T/6. Then, he gives half of that, so (1/2) * (T/6) = T/12. So, he gave his brother T/12 pins.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, the problem says he gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. So, perhaps it's (1/2) * (1/3) * pile. So, yes, that's T/12. So, he gave away T/12 pins.

After giving that to his brother, John had 66 pins left. So, let's model the total.

Originally, he had T pins. He split them into two piles, each of T/2. Then, from one pile, he took (1/3) of it, which is T/6, and then gave half of that (T/12) to his brother.

So, the total pins he has left would be T minus the pins he gave away. So, T - (T/12) = (12T/12 - T/12) = 11T/12.

Wait, but wait a second. Because he only took from one pile. Let me think about that again. Because he had two piles, each of T/2 pins. He gave away T/12 from one pile. So, the other pile remains untouched. So, the total pins he has left would be the entire second pile plus the remaining part of the first pile.

So, the first pile after giving away T/12 is (T/2) - (T/12) = (6T/12 - T/12) = 5T/12. The second pile is untouched, so it's T/2 = 6T/12. So, total pins left would be 5T/12 + 6T/12 = 11T/12. So yes, that matches the earlier calculation. So, 11T/12 = 66.

So, to find T, we can set up the equation 11T/12 = 66.

Solving for T: Multiply both sides by 12: 11T = 792.

Then, divide both sides by 11: T = 72.

Wait, but wait, 72 is one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:396, B:72, C:44, D:60, E:108, F:48, G:66, H:36, I:80, J:90.

So, B is 72, which would be the answer according to my calculation. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, wait, another way to think about it: He had T pins, split into two equal piles, so each pile is T/2. He gave his brother (1/2) of (1/3) of one pile.

So, one pile is T/2. One-third of that is (1/3)(T/2) = T/6. Half of that is (1/2)(T/6) = T/12. So, he gave away T/12.

Therefore, total pins left are T - T/12 = 11T/12 = 66.

So, 11T = 66 * 12 → 11T = 792 → T = 72. So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step with numbers. Let's say he had 72 pins.

He splits them into two piles of 36 each.

He gives his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. So, one pile is 36. One-third of that is 12. Half of 12 is 6. So, he gives 6 pins to his brother.

So, he had 72 - 6 = 66 left, which matches the problem statement.

So, the answer should be B:72.

John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, so if the total number of pins is \( T \), each pile has \( \frac{T}{2} \) pins. He then gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. 

To calculate the number of pins given to his brother:
1. One-third of one pile: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{6} \).
2. One-half of that amount: \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{T}{6} = \frac{T}{12} \).

Thus, John gave his brother \( \frac{T}{12} \) pins. After this, the total number of pins John had left is:
\[ T - \frac{T}{12} = \frac{11T}{12}. \]

According to the problem, John had 66 pins left:
\[ \frac{11T}{12} = 66. \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ 11T = 66 \times 12 \]
\[ 11T = 792 \]
\[ T = \frac{792}{11} \]
\[ T = 72. \]

To verify:
- If John originally had 72 pins, each pile would have \( \frac{72}{2} = 36 \) pins.
- One-third of one pile: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \).
- Half of that: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \).
- Pins given to his brother: 6.
- Pins left: \( 72 - 6 = 66 \), which matches the problem statement.

Thus, the correct answer is **B: 72**.
