Okay, so I've got this question here about permutations and cycles. Hmm, I remember that permutations are arrangements of elements in a specific order. Like, if I have a set {1,2,3}, a permutation could be (2,3,1). But wait, what's a cycle in this context?

Oh right, in group theory, a cycle is a type of permutation where each element is mapped to the next one in a sequence, and the last maps back to the first. So a cycle like (1 2 3) would mean 1→2, 2→3, and 3→1. But is every permutation a cycle?

Wait, no. I think a permutation can be broken down into cycles, but not every permutation is a single cycle. For example, a permutation that swaps two elements and leaves the rest fixed is a transposition, which is a cycle of length 2. But if I have a permutation that's a combination of two disjoint cycles, like (1 2)(3 4), that's not a single cycle. So Statement 1 says every permutation is a cycle, which isn't true. So Statement 1 is false.

Now, Statement 2 says every cycle is a permutation. Well, a cycle is a specific kind of permutation, so yes. Every cycle definitely rearranges the elements and is a valid permutation. So Statement 2 is true.

So looking at the options, I need to find where Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is True. Let's check the options:

Option H says False, True. That fits what I concluded.

Statement 1 claims that every permutation is a cycle. However, this is incorrect because permutations can be composed of multiple cycles, not just a single cycle. For example, the permutation (1 2)(3 4) consists of two disjoint cycles. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2 asserts that every cycle is a permutation. This is correct because a cycle is a specific type of permutation where elements are rearranged in a sequential manner. Thus, Statement 2 is true.

The correct option is H: False, True.
