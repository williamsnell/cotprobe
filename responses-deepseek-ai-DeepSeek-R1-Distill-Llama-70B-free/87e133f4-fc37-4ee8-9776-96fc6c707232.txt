Okay, so I've got this finance problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's see. The question is about calculating the present value of three payments of $1000 each, made at the end of each year. But wait, the first payment is made at the end of the fifth year. Oh right, so it's like the payments are in years 5, 6, and 7, each being $1000. The rate of return is 7%. 

I remember that present value calculations involve discounting future cash flows back to the present. The formula for the present value of a single sum is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where r is the discount rate and n is the number of periods. But since these are three payments, maybe I should treat this as an annuity or a series of payments.

Wait, wait. Annuity? Right, an ordinary annuity is a series of equal payments made at the end of each period. So the present value of an ordinary annuity can be calculated with the formula PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r]. But wait, here the payments don't start until year 5. So it's like a deferred annuity. 

Oh right! So for a deferred annuity, I can think of it as an annuity that starts in the future. So the steps would be: first, find the present value of the annuity as if it starts immediately, and then discount that present value back to the present.

Alternatively, I could calculate each payment's present value separately and sum them up. Let me outline both methods and see which is easier.

Method 1: Treat as a deferred annuity.
- The annuity has three payments of $1000 each, starting at year 5. So the first payment is at year 5, the second at 6, and the third at 7. 

First, I'll calculate the present value of the annuity at year 4 (right before the first payment). Then, discount that back to the present (year 0) using the 7% rate.

Wait, no. Actually, I think I should calculate the present value of the three payments as of year 4, then discount that back four more years to get to year 0.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate the present value of the three $1000 payments as of the end of year 4. Since the first payment is at the end of year 5, the time between the end of year 4 and the first payment is one year. So the annuity is for three periods starting at year 5.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV_annuity = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

Plugging in the numbers: PMT=1000, r=7% or 0.07, n=3.

PV_annuity = 1000 * [(1 - (1.07)^-3 ) / 0.07 ]

Let me compute that. 1.07^3 is about 1.225043. So 1/1.225043 is approximately 0.8163265. So 1 minus that is 0.1836735. Divide by 0.07 gives approximately 2.62476. Multiply by 1000 gives 2624.76. Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, using the formula step by step:

(1 - (1.07)^-3) = 1 - (1 / 1.07^3) = 1 - (1 / 1.225043) = 1 - 0.8163265 ≈ 0.1836735.

Then, 0.1836735 / 0.07 ≈ 2.62476.

So PV_annuity at year 4 is 1000 * 2.62476 ≈ 2624.76.

But wait, I'm at year 4, so now I need to discount this amount back to the present (year 0). The period from year 4 to year 0 is 4 years.

So PV_present = 2624.76 / (1.07)^4.

Compute (1.07)^4. Let's see: 1.07^2 is 1.1449. Then squared again, 1.1449^2 = approx 1.3108. So 1.07^4 ≈ 1.3108.

So PV_present ≈ 2624.76 / 1.3108 ≈ Let's compute that. 2624.76 / 1.3108. 

Hmm, 2624.76 divided by 1.3108. Let me compute that.

Well, 1.3108 times 2000 is 2621.6. So 2000 would give me 2621.6, which is very close to 2624.76. The difference is 2624.76 - 2621.6 = 3.16. So 3.16 / 1.3108 ≈ approximately 2.41. So total is approximately 2002.41.

Wait, but I'm getting 2002.41 as the present value. Looking at the options, option G is 2002.0781, which is very close. So the correct answer might be G.

Alternatively, another approach: Calculate each payment's PV and sum.

Each payment is $1000 at the end of year 5, 6, 7.

So PV for year 5: 1000/(1.07)^5.

Year 6: 1000/(1.07)^6.

Year 7: 1000/(1.07)^7.

Sum them up.

Let me compute each:

1.07^5: Let's compute step by step.

1.07^1 = 1.07

1.07^2 = 1.1449

1.07^3 ≈ 1.22504

1.07^4 ≈ 1.31080

1.07^5 ≈ 1.31080 * 1.07 ≈ 1.40255.

So 1000 / 1.40255 ≈ 713.34.

Similarly, 1.07^6 = 1.40255 * 1.07 ≈ 1.50363.

1000 / 1.50363 ≈ 665.07.

1.07^7 ≈ 1.50363 * 1.07 ≈ 1.60603.

1000 / 1.60603 ≈ 622.78.

Summing these: 713.34 + 665.07 = 1378.41 + 622.78 = 2001.19.

Wait, that's about 2001.19. The option G is 2002.0781, which is very close. The slight difference is due to rounding during calculations.

So either method gives approximately 2002. So the correct answer should be G.

To calculate the present value of three $1000 payments made at the end of years 5, 6, and 7, with a 7% discount rate, we can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula and adjust for the deferral period. The payments represent a deferred annuity, where the first payment occurs at the end of year 5.

### Step 1: Calculate the present value of the annuity at the end of year 4
The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

\[
PV_{\text{annuity}} = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

Where:
- \(PMT = 1000\),
- \(r = 0.07\),
- \(n = 3\).

First, calculate \((1 + r)^{-n}\):
\[
(1.07)^{-3} = \frac{1}{(1.07)^3} \approx 0.8163265
\]

Then:
\[
1 - (1.07)^{-3} \approx 1 - 0.8163265 = 0.1836735
\]

Now divide by \(r\):
\[
\frac{0.1836735}{0.07} \approx 2.62476
\]

Finally, multiply by \(PMT\):
\[
PV_{\text{annuity}} = 1000 \times 2.62476 \approx 2624.76
\]

This is the present value of the annuity at the end of year 4.

### Step 2: Discount the present value back to the present (year 0)
The present value at year 0 is calculated by discounting \(PV_{\text{annuity}}\) back 4 years:

\[
PV_{\text{present}} = \frac{PV_{\text{annuity}}}{(1 + r)^4}
\]

First, calculate \((1.07)^4\):
\[
(1.07)^4 \approx 1.3108
\]

Then:
\[
PV_{\text{present}} = \frac{2624.76}{1.3108} \approx 2002.41
\]

### Step 3: Verify by calculating each payment's present value
Each payment occurs at the end of years 5, 6, and 7. The present value of each payment is:

\[
PV = \frac{1000}{(1.07)^5}, \quad PV = \frac{1000}{(1.07)^6}, \quad PV = \frac{1000}{(1.07)^7}
\]

Calculate each:
- For year 5: \((1.07)^5 \approx 1.40255\), so \(PV \approx \frac{1000}{1.40255} \approx 713.34\).
- For year 6: \((1.07)^6 \approx 1.50363\), so \(PV \approx \frac{1000}{1.50363} \approx 665.07\).
- For year 7: \((1.07)^7 \approx 1.60603\), so \(PV \approx \frac{1000}{1.60603} \approx 622.78\).

Summing these:
\[
PV_{\text{total}} = 713.34 + 665.07 + 622.78 \approx 2001.19
\]

This result is consistent with the previous method, with minor differences due to rounding.

### Final Answer
The present value of the payments is approximately **2002.08**, which corresponds to **Option G**.

G: 2002.0781
