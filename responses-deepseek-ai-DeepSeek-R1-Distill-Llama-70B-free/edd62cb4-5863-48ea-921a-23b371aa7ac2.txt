Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about graph problems and their solvability in polynomial time. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my graph theory, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which of the given problems can be solved in polynomial time for an undirected graph G. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Finding the longest path in G. Wait, the longest path problem. I remember that finding the longest path is related to the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete. So I think this one is not solvable in polynomial time. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Finding a longest simple cycle. Simple cycle means a cycle without repeating vertices. Again, this seems similar to the Hamiltonian cycle problem, which is also NP-complete. So B is likely not solvable in poly time.

Option C: Finding all Hamiltonian cycles. Oh right, Hamiltonian cycle is a classic NP-complete problem. Enumerating all such cycles would be even harder, so definitely not polynomial time. So C is out.

Option D: Finding a largest clique. Largest clique problem is about finding the maximum complete subgraph. I remember that finding a maximum clique is NP-hard, so no polynomial time solution exists. So D isn't the answer.

Option E: Finding a minimum vertex cover. Wait, vertex cover. I think there's a theorem here. Oh right, Konig's theorem relates vertex cover and maximum matching in bipartite graphs. But wait, in general graphs, what's the situation? Oh wait, the vertex cover problem is NP-hard in general, but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, wait. I'm a bit confused. Let me think: The decision version of vertex cover is NP-complete. So finding the minimum vertex cover is NP-hard, meaning no polynomial time solution. So E is not the answer.

Wait, but wait! I'm mixing things up. Because for bipartite graphs, Konig's theorem allows maximum matching to be found in polynomial time, which also gives the minimum vertex cover. But the question is about general graphs, not just bipartite ones. So yes, in general graphs, it's NP-hard, so E is not the answer.

Option F: Finding a maximum independent set. Independent set is the complement of a clique. So maximum independent set is also NP-hard. So F is not solvable in poly time.

Option G: Finding a minimum dominating set. Dominating set problem is also NP-hard. So G is not the answer.

Option H: Finding a maximum clique. Wait, same as D, right? Yes. So H is not solvable in polynomial time.

Option I: Finding a shortest cycle. Shortest cycleâ€”so the cycle with the fewest edges. Hmm, how is this done? I think this can be solved using BFS. Because for each edge, you can check if there's a shorter path between the two vertices. Or maybe for each node, perform BFS until you find a back edge, and track the shortest cycle length.

Wait, another approach: For each node u, run BFS and look for the shortest cycle that includes u. The shortest such cycle across all u would be the answer. Since BFS is O(V+E), and you run it V times, it's O(V(V+E)), which is polynomial time.

Alternatively, another method is to look for the girth of the graph, which is the length of the shortest cycle. There's an algorithm that finds the girth in polynomial time. So I is solvable in polynomial time.

Wait, but what about graphs with no cycles? Then the problem is trivially not applicable, but I think the question assumes the graph has at least one cycle.

So the correct answer must be option I.

To determine which problem can be solved in polynomial time for an undirected graph \( G \), let us analyze each option:

- **Option A: Finding the longest path in \( G \)**  
  The longest path problem is NP-hard because it is closely related to the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete. Therefore, it cannot be solved in polynomial time.

- **Option B: Finding a longest simple cycle in \( G \)**  
  This problem is also NP-hard, as it is related to the Hamiltonian cycle problem, which is NP-complete. Thus, it cannot be solved in polynomial time.

- **Option C: Finding all Hamiltonian cycles in \( G \)**  
  Enumerating all Hamiltonian cycles is computationally intractable because the Hamiltonian cycle problem itself is NP-complete. Hence, this problem cannot be solved in polynomial time.

- **Option D: Finding a largest clique in \( G \)**  
  The largest clique problem is NP-hard, as it involves finding the maximum complete subgraph. Therefore, it cannot be solved in polynomial time.

- **Option E: Finding a minimum vertex cover in \( G \)**  
  The minimum vertex cover problem is NP-hard in general graphs, even though it can be solved in polynomial time for bipartite graphs using Konig's theorem. Since the question pertains to general graphs, this problem cannot be solved in polynomial time.

- **Option F: Finding a maximum independent set in \( G \)**  
  The maximum independent set problem is NP-hard, as it is the complement of the maximum clique problem. Thus, it cannot be solved in polynomial time.

- **Option G: Finding a minimum dominating set in \( G \)**  
  The minimum dominating set problem is also NP-hard, so it cannot be solved in polynomial time.

- **Option H: Finding a maximum clique in \( G \)**  
  This is the same as Option D, and since the maximum clique problem is NP-hard, it cannot be solved in polynomial time.

- **Option I: Finding a shortest cycle in \( G \)**  
  The shortest cycle problem, also known as finding the girth of the graph, can be solved in polynomial time. One approach is to use BFS for each node to find the shortest cycle involving that node, resulting in an overall time complexity of \( O(V(V+E)) \), which is polynomial. Therefore, this problem can be solved in polynomial time.

Thus, the only problem among the given options that can be solved in polynomial time is **Option I**.
