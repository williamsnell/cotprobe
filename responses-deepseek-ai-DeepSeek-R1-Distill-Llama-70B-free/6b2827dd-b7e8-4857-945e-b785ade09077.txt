Question:

A man allowed his friend to borrow a debit card to buy a computer. When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, "Give it back!" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?

Options:

A: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of intentional murder.
B: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.
C: Yes, because the evidence showed that the discharge of the gun was accidental.
D: Yes, because the man was acting in self-defense after being attacked by the bystander.
E: Yes, because the evidence showed that the man was provoked by his friend's refusal to return the debit card.
F: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder.
G: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.
H: Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.
I: Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically homicide. Hmm, I need to figure out whether the man's murder conviction should be reversed on appeal. Let me try to break this down.

The facts: The man lent his debit card to a friend to buy a computer. Later, when the friend wouldn't return the card, the man pointed a handgun at him, had his finger on the trigger, and demanded the card back. Then a bystander threw a beer bottle that hit the man's hand, causing the gun to discharge and killing the friend instantly.

The man was convicted of murder under common law. He's appealing, saying the evidence wasn't enough to support the murder verdict. I'm supposed to determine if the conviction should be reversed.

So, the key here is understanding the different types of murder under common law. Common law murder can be broken down into a few categories: intentional murder (express malice), depraved-heart murder (implied malice), felony murder, and possibly others.

Looking at the scenario, the man pointed the gun and held the trigger, but the discharge was due to the bystander's action. So, did he have the intent to kill? Or was it more of a reckless act?

First, I think about intentional murder. For that, the prosecution would need to show that the man had the specific intent to kill. But here, the gun went off because someone else hit his hand. He had his finger on the trigger, but did he pull it? Or was it an accidental discharge because of the bottle?

Wait, but he was pointing the gun at the friend and had the finger on the trigger. So maybe he was in the process of pulling it, but the bottle caused it to fire. Alternatively, maybe the bottle caused an accidental discharge without him intending to pull the trigger. The question says the discharge was caused by the bottle striking his hand, so perhaps it was an accident, and he didn't actually intend to pull the trigger.

If that's the case, then it's not intentional murder because there's no intent to kill. So option A, which says the evidence supports intentional murder, might not be correct.

Next, depraved-heart murder. This is when the defendant acts with a depraved heart, showing a wanton and willful disregard for human life, and an act that's inherently dangerous to others. So, by pointing a loaded gun at someone and having his finger on the trigger, the man was acting recklessly. Even if he didn't intend to kill, his actions could support depraved-heart murder.

So if the evidence shows he acted with such recklessness, then option B would say the conviction should stand because it's depraved-heart murder. That makes sense because pointing a gun and pulling the trigger (or having the finger on it) is a dangerous act, showing depraved heart.

Another angle is felony murder. Felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony. The underlying felony here might be robbery or assault. But wait, the man was trying to get his debit card back. He pointed a gun, which could be considered assault with a deadly weapon. So if during the commission of that felony, the friend was killed, felony murder would apply. But in this case, the discharge was accidental due to a bystander's action. Does that still count as felony murder?

I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think felony murder doesn't require intent to kill; the death just needs to occur during the felony. So even if the shooting was accidental, as long as it happened during the felony, felony murder applies. So option G says the evidence supports felony murder, which would mean the conviction stands. But wait, I'm not sure if the jurisdiction requires the felony to be inherently dangerous or if any felony would do. Also, felony murder at common law might vary.

Wait, the question states that the jurisdiction follows the common law of homicide. Common law felony murder typically requires that the underlying felony be a serious one, often classified as a felony at common law. So if the man was committing an assault with a deadly weapon (which is a felony), then any death during that would be felony murder.

But in this case, the man was trying to retrieve his debit card, which he believed was his. So maybe he was committing robbery? Robbery is a felony. But if he's taking his own property, perhaps that's a defense. Wait, under the claim of right, if someone takes property believing it's theirs, that's a defense to robbery. So maybe the underlying felony isn't valid because of the claim of right. That could affect the felony murder charge.

So if the felony is invalidated because he thought he was taking his own property, then felony murder wouldn't apply. So option G might not be correct.

Another possibility is that the killing was an accident, so maybe manslaughter. But the question is about murder, so I'm focusing on whether the evidence supports any form of murder.

Back to depraved-heart murder. Pointing a gun at someone and having your finger on the trigger is a reckless act with disregard for human life. Even if he didn't intend to kill, the act is so dangerous that it shows depraved heart. So option B would say the evidence supports depraved-heart murder, so the conviction stands.

But wait, the discharge was accidental because of the beer bottle. So the man didn't pull the trigger intentionally. Does that negate the depraved heart? Because he had the gun pointed and finger on the trigger, which is a reckless act. The fact that the gun went off because of an external factor doesn't change the recklessness of pointing the gun and having the finger on the trigger.

Alternatively, could this be considered an accident, leading to a manslaughter conviction instead of murder? But the question is about whether the evidence supports murder, so if depraved heart applies, then murder is possible.

Looking at the options, option C says the discharge was accidental, so the conviction should be reversed. But if the man's action of pointing the gun and having the finger on the trigger constitutes depraved heart, then the accidental discharge due to the bottle might not matter. His act was still reckless, creating a high risk of death.

So I think the evidence supports depraved-heart murder, making option B correct. So the conviction shouldn't be reversed.

Wait, but another angle: the man's intent was to take the debit card, which he believed was his, so perhaps under a claim of right. Option I says that the man's intent wasn't to kill but to take property under a claim of right. So maybe that affects the mens rea for murder.

But for depraved-heart murder, the intent is to act with reckless disregard, not necessarily to kill. So even if his primary intent was to retrieve the card, the way he did it was reckless enough for depraved heart.

So I think option B is the right choice. The evidence supports depraved-heart murder, so the conviction shouldn't be reversed.

The question revolves around whether the evidence was sufficient to support the man's murder conviction under common law homicide. The key facts are that the man pointed a handgun at his friend, had his finger on the trigger, and demanded the return of his debit card. A bystander threw a beer bottle that struck the man's hand, causing the gun to discharge and kill the friend instantly.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A (Intentional Murder):**  
   Intentional murder requires specific intent to kill. Here, the gun discharged due to the bystander's action, and there is no clear evidence that the man intentionally pulled the trigger. Thus, the evidence does not support intentional murder.

2. **Option B (Depraved-Heart Murder):**  
   Depraved-heart murder involves acting with a reckless disregard for human life, demonstrating a "depraved heart." Pointing a loaded gun at someone and having the finger on the trigger constitutes reckless and inherently dangerous behavior. Even though the discharge was accidental, the man's actions show a depraved heart. This makes depraved-heart murder a plausible basis for the conviction.

3. **Option C (Accidental Discharge):**  
   While the discharge was accidental, the man's reckless act of pointing the gun and having his finger on the trigger could still support a murder conviction under the theory of depraved-heart murder. Thus, this option does not necessarily lead to reversal.

4. **Option D (Self-Defense):**  
   There is no evidence that the man was acting in self-defense. The bystander's action of throwing a beer bottle does not justify the man's reckless behavior. This option is not applicable.

5. **Option E (Provocation):**  
   The friend's refusal to return the debit card does not constitute sufficient provocation to reduce the charge or overturn the conviction. This option is not relevant.

6. **Option F (Premeditated Murder):**  
   Premeditated murder requires planning and deliberation. The facts do not indicate any premeditation, so this option is incorrect.

7. **Option G (Felony Murder):**  
   Felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony. While the man could be seen as committing assault with a deadly weapon, the "claim of right" defense (believing the debit card was his) may undermine the underlying felony. Additionally, the accidental nature of the discharge complicates the application of felony murder. This option is less likely.

8. **Option H (No Intent to Pull the Trigger):**  
   The evidence suggests that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger, as the discharge was caused by the bystander. However, his reckless actions could still support depraved-heart murder. This option does not necessarily lead to reversal.

9. **Option I (Claim of Right):**  
   The man's intent to retrieve the debit card under a claim of right does not negate the recklessness of pointing a loaded gun at his friend. This option does not preclude a depraved-heart murder conviction.

### Conclusion:  
The evidence supports a conviction for depraved-heart murder because the man's actions—pointing a loaded gun and having his finger on the trigger—demonstrate a reckless disregard for human life. The accidental discharge does not negate the recklessness required for depraved-heart murder. Therefore, the conviction should not be reversed.
