Question:

This jurisdiction has the following bribery statute in effect:"Any person who offers or gives a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty of bribery. "A real estate developer owned a large parcel of land in the suburbs. Although the developer wanted to build an office building on the property, the land was zoned residential. Due to the residential zoning, the developer could not pursue his planned development unless he received a variance from the building commission. The developer held a meeting with a member of the building commission to solicit his approval in securing a zoning variance. To do so, the developer gave the commission member $10,000 in exchange for his support in approving the zoning variance. Thereupon, the commission member voted to approve the variance, thus making it possible for the developer to commence construction of the office building. The developer was subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. During the course of the trial, the commission member testified that he faked the agreement with the developer and would have approved the zoning variance regardless of whether the developer gave him any money. Furthermore, in his defense, the developer presented evidence that the other six members of the building commission voted affirmatively to approve the variance. If the jury believed that the commission member would have approved the variance even had he not received the $10,000, the developer should be found

Options:

A: guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.
B: guilty, because he gave the commission member the $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.
C: not guilty, because the commission member did not receive a thing of value, since he would have approved the variance regardless of receiving any payment from the developer.
D: not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.

Okay, so I have this bribery conspiracy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully again.

The jurisdiction's bribery statute says that anyone who offers or gives a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty of bribery. So, the key elements here are offering or giving something valuable to a government official in exchange for an official act.

Now, the facts: A real estate developer owns land zoned residential but wants to build an office building. He needs a zoning variance from the building commission. He meets with a commission member and gives him $10,000 in exchange for his support to approve the variance. The commission member then votes to approve it, allowing the developer to build. But during the trial, the commission member says he faked the agreement and would have approved the variance regardless of the money. Also, the developer presents evidence that the other six members voted yes, so even without this particular member's vote, the variance would have passed.

The developer is prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. The question is, if the jury believes the commission member would have approved the variance even without the $10,000, should the developer be found guilty or not guilty?

The options are A through D. Let's think about each element.

Conspiracy typically requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and in some jurisdictions, an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. But for bribery, the offer or giving of a thing of value in exchange for an official act is the key.

In this case, the developer gave $10,000 to the commission member with the understanding that it was in exchange for his vote. However, the commission member claims he wouldn't have needed the moneyâ€”he was going to approve it anyway. So, did a bribe actually occur?

Wait, but the developer offered and gave the money intending it to be a bribe. The commission member accepted it. Now, the issue is whether the developer is guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery even if the official wouldn't have been influenced by the payment.

I remember that for bribery, the government doesn't need to prove that the official's action was actually influenced by the bribe. It's enough that the bribe was offered with the intent to influence official action. So, even if the official was going to act that way regardless, the act of offering the bribe is still a crime.

But wait, this is about conspiracy to commit bribery, not the completed offense. Conspiracy requires an agreement to commit the crime. If the official wasn't actually going to be influenced, did they have a meeting of the minds? Because if the commission member never intended to accept the bribe and was just taking the money without intending to perform the action, then maybe there's no true conspiracy.

Alternatively, maybe the developer believed that the official would be influenced, so he intended to bribe. But if the official didn't intend to be bribed, is there still a conspiracy? Or does it require mutual intent?

Hmm, I think conspiracy requires a mutual agreement. If one party (the developer) offers a bribe intending it to influence the official, but the official doesn't agree to be influenced and only takes the money without intending to do anything in return, then there's no meeting of the minds. So, maybe there's no conspiracy.

Wait, but in this case, the developer gave the money, and the commission member accepted it and then voted yes. The commission member's testimony is that he would have done it anyway. So, perhaps the developer's intent was to bribe, but the official's intent was to take the money without being influenced. So, they didn't have an agreement to exchange the money for the vote because the official wasn't really agreeing to anything conditional.

So, in that case, maybe there's no conspiracy because the official wasn't actually agreeing to perform the official act in exchange for the money. Without that mutual understanding, the conspiracy doesn't exist.

Wait, but the developer offered the money intending it to be a bribe, and the official accepted it. But if the official didn't intend to be bribed, then perhaps the developer is guilty of offering a bribe, but the official isn't guilty of accepting it. But the question is about the developer being prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery.

Conspiracy requires that both parties agree to commit the crime. If the official wasn't agreeing to accept the bribe as part of a deal, then maybe the developer can't be guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, but in the scenario, the developer gave the money, and the official took it and voted yes. But the official claims he would have done it anyway. So, did they have an agreement where the official agreed to accept the money in exchange for the vote? Or was the developer trying to bribe, and the official just took the money but didn't intend to be influenced.

If the official didn't intend to be bribed, then there's no meeting of the minds, so no conspiracy. Because conspiracy requires that both parties intend to commit the crime. If one party (the official) doesn't intend to do anything wrong, then there's no agreement.

So, in this case, the developer intended to bribe, but the official didn't intend to accept a bribe. Therefore, there's no conspiracy because the agreement wasn't mutual.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Guilty because the agreement to accept $10k was enough. But if the official didn't agree to do anything in return, maybe A is wrong.

Option B: Guilty because he gave money in exchange for approval. But if the exchange wasn't actually agreed upon, maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: Not guilty because the official didn't receive a thing of value since he would have approved anyway. Wait, no, the developer did give $10k, so the official did receive it. So C's reasoning might not hold.

Option D: Not guilty because no true agreement. That seems to align with my earlier thought.

So, if the jury believes the official wasn't influenced, then there's no agreement, so the developer isn't guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, but the developer still offered the money intending it to be a bribe. But for conspiracy, both parties must agree to the plan. So if the official didn't agree, then the developer can't conspire alone.

So, the correct answer would be D: Not guilty because there was no true agreement between the parties.

To determine whether the developer should be found guilty or not guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery, we must analyze the elements of conspiracy and bribery under the given statute. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more parties to commit a crime, and both parties must mutually intend to commit the unlawful act. Bribery, as defined by the statute, involves offering or giving a thing of value to a government official in exchange for official action.

In this case, the developer gave $10,000 to the commission member with the intent to influence his vote on the zoning variance. However, the commission member testified that he would have approved the variance regardless of the payment, indicating that he did not intend to be influenced by the money. This lack of mutual intent is critical because conspiracy requires a "meeting of the minds" between the parties. If the commission member did not agree to accept the money in exchange for his vote, there was no true agreement to commit bribery.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests guilt based on the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000. However, if the member did not intend to be influenced, there was no mutual agreement, making this option incorrect.  
- **Option B** argues guilt because the developer gave money in exchange for approval. While the developer intended to bribe, the absence of a mutual agreement with the commission member means this option is also incorrect.  
- **Option C** claims the developer is not guilty because the commission member did not receive a thing of value. This is incorrect because the developer did give $10,000, which constitutes a thing of value under the statute.  
- **Option D** states the developer is not guilty because there was no true agreement between the parties. This aligns with the analysis, as the commission member's lack of intent to be influenced means there was no mutual agreement to commit bribery.

Thus, the developer should be found not guilty because there was no true agreement between the parties.
