Okay, so I've got this question here about shoe styles, and I need to figure out which one isn't a style of shoe. The options are A through H: loafer, pump, moccasin, docksider, oxford, espadrille, brogan, and gingham. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my shoe types, but let me think this through.

Starting with what I know. A loafer is definitely a type of shoe. I've heard of penny loafers before, right? They're those slip-on shoes without laces. So A is a shoe style.

B is pump. Pump makes me think of high heels, like the kind women wear. So yeah, pumps are shoes. So B is a style.

C is moccasin. Moccasins are those soft, usually leather shoes, sometimes with a casual or Native American style look. Definitely a shoe, so C is out.

D is docksider. Docksiders are boat shoes, like the ones with the slip-resistant soles and often worn on boats. They're also a style, so D is a shoe.

E is oxford. Oh, Oxford shoes are the ones with laces and a closed toe, often dress shoes. Like what you might wear with a suit. So E is a style.

F is espadrille. Espadrilles are those canvas or cotton shoes with a braided jute sole. They're popular in summer, right? So F is a shoe style.

G is brogan. Brogans... I'm a bit unsure. I think brogues are a type of shoe with decorative perforations, like the Brogue shoes. So maybe brogan is a variation or another name for that. Either way, it's a shoe style, so G is not the answer.

H is gingham. Wait, gingham is a pattern, not a shoe. Gingham is that checkered pattern, usually in red and white or other colors. It's a fabric pattern, used in clothes like dresses or shirts. So H isn't a shoe style.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I miss any? Let me go through each option again quickly. Loafer, pump, moccasin, docksider, oxford, espadrille, broganâ€”all are shoe types. Gingham is a fabric pattern, so it's not a shoe style. So the answer must be H.
