Okay, so I've got this question about the energy required to ionize helium. Hmm, I remember that ionization energy is the energy needed to remove an electron from an atom. But wait, the question says that the energy to remove both electrons from helium in its ground state is 79.0 eV. I need to find out how much energy is needed to remove just one electron, which would be the ionization energy.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how ionization works for multi-electron atoms. I think for hydrogen-like atoms, the ionization energy depends on the charge of the nucleus. Helium has a nuclear charge of +2, right? And each electron is in the K shell, the first energy level.

I remember the formula for the ionization energy of hydrogen-like atoms. It's something like E = 13.6 eV * Z² / n², where Z is the atomic number and n is the principal quantum number. So for helium, Z is 2, and n is 1 because it's the ground state.

Let me plug in the numbers. E = 13.6 eV * (2)^2 / (1)^2. That would be 13.6 *4 = 54.4 eV. So that's the energy required to remove one electron from helium, right?

Wait a second, but the question says that removing both electrons takes 79.0 eV. If each electron requires 54.4 eV, then two would be 108.8 eV, which is way more than 79. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Did I make a mistake?

Oh wait, maybe the energy to remove the first electron is higher than the second. Because once you remove the first electron, the second one is easier to remove because the nucleus has a lower effective charge. Or wait, no, for helium, both electrons are in the same shell. So the first electron you remove would have a higher ionization energy, and the second would be lower.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Helium has a full K shell, right? So when both electrons are present, each electron is in the 1s orbital with Z=2. So the ionization energy for the first electron should be 13.6 eV * (2)^2 = 54.4 eV. Once you remove one electron, the remaining electron experiences a Z of 2 but with a lower effective charge because... Wait no, the remaining electron is now the only one, so it's a He+ ion, which is hydrogen-like with Z=2, so the ionization energy for the second electron would be the same as the first, 54.4 eV. So total would be 108.8 eV, which is more than the given 79 eV. That can't be right.

Wait, but the question states that the energy to remove both is 79.0 eV. So maybe each requires 79/2 = 39.5 eV on average. But that doesn't align with the hydrogen-like formula. Hmm, maybe the approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe each electron doesn't require the same energy. So the first electron has a higher ionization energy, and the second lower. Because when you remove the first, the second is easier to remove. So total would be sum of the two.

Wait, but in that case, let's think about the ionization energies. The first ionization energy (removing first electron) is higher than the second. For example, I think the first ionization energy of He is around 24.6 eV, and the second is higher. Wait, wait no, that can't be. Because removing the first electron would leave a +1 charge, so the second electron would be more tightly bound.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me look up in my memory: Helium's first ionization energy is actually higher than the second. Because when you ionize He, you go from He (neutral) to He+ (which is like a hydrogen atom with Z=2), which requires 24.6 eV. Then, removing the second electron from He+ requires 54.4 eV. So total energy to remove both would be 24.6 +54.4=79.0 eV, which matches the given data.

Oh! So the question gives the total as 79.0 eV. So the first ionization is 24.6 eV, the second is 54.4 eV. So the energy to ionize helium (i.e., remove one electron) is 24.6 eV.

Looking at the options, option J is 24.6 eV. So the correct answer should be J.

The energy required to ionize helium (i.e., remove one electron) can be determined by analyzing the given data. The total energy to remove both electrons from helium in its ground state is 79.0 eV. This includes the energy to remove the first electron (first ionization energy) and the second electron (second ionization energy).

For helium, the first ionization energy is the energy required to remove the first electron, resulting in a He⁺ ion. The second ionization energy is the energy required to remove the remaining electron from the He⁺ ion, which is hydrogen-like with a nuclear charge \( Z = 2 \). Using the formula for the ionization energy of hydrogen-like atoms:

\[
E = 13.6 \, \text{eV} \cdot Z^2 / n^2
\]

For the second electron (He⁺ ion), \( Z = 2 \) and \( n = 1 \), so:

\[
E = 13.6 \cdot 2^2 / 1^2 = 54.4 \, \text{eV}
\]

Given that the total energy to remove both electrons is 79.0 eV, the energy required to remove the first electron (first ionization energy) is:

\[
79.0 \, \text{eV} - 54.4 \, \text{eV} = 24.6 \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy required to ionize helium (remove one electron) is 24.6 eV. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 24.6 eV**
