Okay, so I've got this question here that asks me to determine which list of numbers is ordered from least to greatest. There are eight options, labeled A through H. I need to go through each option and figure out the correct order.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what "least to greatest" means. It means the numbers should be arranged in ascending order, starting from the smallest and going up to the largest. So for each option, I'll check if each subsequent number is larger than the previous one.

Let's start with option A: 167,213, 161,455, 17,400, 116,633. Wait, I notice that the first number is 167,213. The next is 161,455, which is smaller. So that's already out of order because it's decreasing. So A is not the correct answer.

Option B: 120,209, 120,902, 125,466, 125,464. Let's see. The first two numbers are in order because 120,209 is less than 120,902. Then it goes to 125,466, which is bigger. But the next number is 125,464, which is slightly smaller than 125,466. So the last two are out of order. So B isn't correct.

Option C: 160,233, 171,141, 116,645, 167,703. The first number is 160k, then 171k, which is bigger. But the third number drops to 116k, which is smaller than both previous. So that's not in order. C is out.

Option D: 160,233, 171,141, 11,645, 16,703. Again, first two are in order, but the third is 11k, which is way smaller. So that's not right. D is incorrect.

Option E: 167,213, 161,455, 17,400, 11,633. The first number is 167k, then 161k (smaller), then 17k, and then 11k. So it's descending, not ascending. E is wrong.

Option F: 10,354, 10,600, 104,321, 106,213. Let's check each step. 10,354 to 10,600 is an increase. Next is 104,321, which is bigger than 10k. Then 106,213 is bigger than 104k. So each next number is larger. So F looks like it's in order. Wait, but let me make sure. 10,354 < 10,600? Yes. 10,600 < 104,321? Yes. 104,321 < 106,213? Yes. So F is correctly ordered from least to greatest. Hmm, that's a possible correct answer.

But wait, I should check the other options too just to be sure.

Option G: 12,209, 12,902, 125,466, 125,464. First, 12,209 to 12,902 is an increase. Then 125k is bigger. But the last number is 125,464, which is smaller than 125,466. So the last two are out of order. So G isn't correct.

Option H: 18,209, 18,902, 185,466, 185,464. The first two are in order. Then 185k is bigger than 18k. But the last number is 185,464, which is smaller than 185,466. So last two are swapped. So H isn't correct.

So the only option that's correctly ordered is F. Each number is larger than the previous one.

The correct list ordered from least to greatest is:

F: 10,354, 10,600, 104,321, 106,213

Each subsequent number in this list is larger than the previous one, satisfying the condition of ascending order.

F
