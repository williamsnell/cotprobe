Question:

Mr. Fields is considering selling a property acquired 15 years ago for $65,000; $10,000 was for the land, and $55,000 was for the building. Mr. Fields can now sell the property for $120,000. He can also keep it and continue to collect the annual rent from the building. If Mr. Fields decides to keep the property, he will keep it for another 25 years and will, at that time, sell it for $40,000. The annual rent receipts will be $5,930 for the next twenty-five years. Should Mr. Fields sell the property now or in twenty-five years? Assume that the building, but not the land, has been depreciated using the straight line method at 2%, long term gains are taxable at a rate of 25%, Mr. Fields' income tax rate is 56%, the minimum attractive rate of return after taxes is 2(1/2)%, and taxes will hold for the next 25 years. Make all calculations to the nearest dollar.

Options:

A: Mr. Fields should lease the property to a new tenant for a higher annual rent
B: Mr. Fields should sell the property now for $120,000
C: Mr. Fields should keep the property for 25 more years
D: Mr. Fields should convert the building into a personal residence
E: Mr. Fields should rent the property for another 15 years
F: Mr. Fields should sell the property after 10 years
G: Mr. Fields should renovate the property and then decide whether to sell or keep it
H: Mr. Fields should exchange the property for a similar one to defer taxes
I: Mr. Fields should hold the property indefinitely for future generations
J: Mr. Fields should donate the property to a charitable organization for a tax write-off

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Mr. Fields should sell his property now or keep it for another 25 years. This seems like a financial decision involving tax implications and some calculations about returns. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I know that when you sell a property, you have to consider the capital gains tax. Capital gains are calculated based on the selling price minus the cost basis. The cost basis might include adjustments for depreciation. Since Mr. Fields has been depreciating the building, I need to factor that in.

So the property was bought 15 years ago for $65,000, split into $10k for land and $55k for the building. He's been depreciating the building using straight-line at 2% per year. So each year, the depreciation would be 55,000 * 0.02 = $1,100. Over 15 years, that's 15 * 1,100 = $16,500. So the book value of the building now is 55,000 - 16,500 = $38,500. The land doesn't depreciate, so it's still $10,000. So the total cost basis now is 38,500 + 10,000 = $48,500.

If he sells now for $120,000, the selling price is $120k. The gain is 120,000 - 48,500 = $71,500. But wait, that's not right. Wait, wait. Because the land isn't depreciated. So the cost basis is $48,500, yes. So the gain is 120k - 48.5k = 71.5k.

Now, the tax on that gain. Long-term gains are taxed at 25%. So 71,500 * 0.25 = $17,875. So his after-tax proceeds from selling now would be 120,000 - 17,875 = $102,125.

Alternatively, if he keeps the property for 25 more years, he'll continue to rent it out and then sell it at the end. I need to calculate the after-tax cash flows from renting and the final sale.

First, the annual rent is $5,930. But I think I need to consider the tax implications of that rent. Rental income is taxable, so each year he'll pay income tax on that. His tax rate is 56%, so the after-tax rent would be 5,930 * (1 - 0.56) = 5,930 * 0.44. Let me calculate that: 5,930 * 0.44. Let's see, 5,000 *0.44=2,200, 930*0.44=409.2, so total 2,609.2. So about $2,609 per year after tax.

But wait, he can also take depreciation each year. The building's remaining book value is $38,500. He's using straight-line depreciation at 2%, so each year it's 38,500 *0.02 = $770. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, but it reduces taxable income. So each year, his taxable income from the property would be rental income minus depreciation. So 5,930 - 770 = $5,160. Then, the tax on that would be 5,160 * 0.56. Let me calculate that: 5,000 *0.56=2,800, 160*0.56=89.6, so 2,889.6. So his cash flow from the rent would be the after-tax rent plus depreciation (since depreciation is non-cash). So that's (5,930 - 5,160) + 770 = 770 + 770 = $1,540? Wait, no. Wait, the cash flow calculation. The rental income is $5,930. Then, he pays taxes on the net income. The net income is 5,930 - 770 (depreciation) = 5,160. Taxes are 5,160 * 0.56 = $2,889.6. So after-tax cash flow is 5,930 - 2,889.6 = $3,040.4. Alternatively, another way: (rental income - tax) + depreciation, which is 5,930 - (5,160 *0.56) + 770. Wait, no, I think the first approach is correct. So the after-tax cash flow each year is $3,040.4. Rounded to the nearest dollar, say $3,040.

Now, over 25 years, that's 25 * 3,040 = $76,000. But wait, that's the total cash flow from rents. But we also have the sale at the end.

At the end of 25 years, he sells the property for $40,000. What's the cost basis then? The building's book value after 15 years was $38,500. Now, he's depreciating it for another 25 years. So each year, 2% of the remaining building value. Wait, no, straight-line is based on the original cost, right? Wait, no, straight-line is (cost - salvage value) over useful life. But if he's already depreciated it for 15 years, then the remaining useful life is 50 years (assuming 65 total?), wait no, wait. Wait, straight-line depreciation is calculated as (cost)/(useful life). But he's already been depreciating it for 15 years at 2% per year. 2% of 55,000 each year. So after 15 years, it's 55,000 - (55,000 *0.02 *15) = 55,000 - 16,500 = 38,500, as before. So for the next 25 years, he will continue to depreciate it at 2% per year on the original 55,000. So each year, 55,000 *0.02 = $1,100. So over 25 years, that's 25 * 1,100 = 27,500. So the book value after 25 more years would be 38,500 - 27,500 = $11,000. So when he sells it for $40,000, the cost basis is 11,000 (building) + land. Wait, land is $10,000, but does it appreciate? The question doesn't say anything about land appreciation, so I think land remains at $10,000. So total cost basis is 11,000 +10,000 = $21,000. So selling price is 40,000, so gain is 40,000 -21,000=19,000. Taxed at 25%, so 19,000 *0.25=4,750. So after-tax proceeds from sale are 40,000 -4,750=35,250.

Now, the total after-tax cash flows if he keeps the property are the 25 years of rent ($3,040 each year) plus the after-tax sale proceeds.

So the total cash flows would be: 25 years of $3,040 each, plus $35,250 at the end.

We need to calculate the present value of these cash flows to see if they exceed the present value of selling now.

Alternatively, compare the present value of keeping vs selling now.

But wait, Mr. Fields has a minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) after taxes of 2.5%. So we need to discount the future cash flows at this rate.

First, let's calculate the present worth of the rental income. It's an annuity of $3,040 per year for 25 years. The present worth factor for an annuity is [1 - (1 + i)^-n ] / i. Where i is 2.5% or 0.025, n=25.

So the present worth of the rental income is 3,040 * [1 - (1.025)^-25 ] / 0.025.

I need to calculate (1.025)^-25. Let me see: 1.025^25 is approximately e^(25*0.025) = e^0.625 ≈ 1.868. So 1/1.868 ≈ 0.535. So 1 - 0.535 = 0.465. So 0.465 /0.025 = 18.6. So 3,040 * 18.6 = let's compute that. 3,000 *18.6 =55,800, 40*18.6=744, total 56,544. So approximately $56,544.

Then, the present worth of the sale proceeds: $35,250 received in 25 years. The present worth factor is 1/(1.025)^25 ≈ 0.535 (from earlier). So 35,250 *0.535 ≈ 35,250 *0.5 =17,625, and 35,250 *0.035≈1,233.75, total ≈18,858.75.

So total present worth of keeping is 56,544 + 18,859 ≈75,403.

Now, the present worth of selling now is $102,125 (after-tax proceeds).

Comparing the two: $102,125 now versus approximately $75,403 if he keeps it. Since 102k is more than 75k, it's better to sell now.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I do that correctly? Let me double-check the calculations because it's easy to make a mistake here.

Wait, the present worth of the rent: 3,040 * [1 - (1.025)^-25 ] /0.025. Let me compute (1.025)^25 more accurately. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for present value of an annuity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1.025^25:

Using logarithms: ln(1.025) ≈0.02469. Multiply by 25: 0.61725. e^0.61725≈1.8535. So (1.025)^25≈1.8535. So 1/(1.8535)≈0.5398.

So [1 - 0.5398]/0.025 = (0.4602)/0.025 = 18.408.

So 3,040 * 18.408 = let's compute that.

3,000 *18.408=55,224.

40 *18.408=735.2.

Total=55,224 +735.2=55,959.2 ≈55,959.

Then, the present worth of the sale proceeds: 35,250 * 0.5398≈35,250 *0.5=17,625, 35,250 *0.0398≈1,401. So total≈19,026.

So total present worth when keeping: 55,959 +19,026≈74,985≈$75,000.

Compare to selling now: $102,125.

So $102k is higher than $75k, so selling now is better.

Therefore, Mr. Fields should sell now.

Looking at the options, option B says he should sell now for $120,000. So the correct answer is B.
</think>

To determine whether Mr. Fields should sell the property now or keep it for another 25 years, we analyze the financial implications of both options, considering tax effects and the time value of money.

  - Long-term capital gains: 25%.
  - Income tax: 56%.
- **Minimum Attractive Rate of Return (MARR):** 2.5% after taxes.

---

### **Option 1: Sell Now**
1. **Cost Basis:**
   - Land: $10,000 (non-depreciable).
   - Building: $55,000 - (15 years × $1,100 annual depreciation) = $38,500.
   - Total Cost Basis: $10,000 + $38,500 = $48,500.

2. **Capital Gain:**
   - Selling Price: $120,000.
   - Gain: $120,000 - $48,500 = $71,500.
   - Tax on Gain: $71,500 × 25% = $17,875.
   - After-Tax Proceeds: $120,000 - $17,875 = **$102,125**.

---

### **Option 2: Keep the Property for 25 Years**
1. **Annual Cash Flow:**
   - Rental Income: $5,930.
   - Depreciation: $1,100 per year (2% of $55,000).
   - Taxable Income: $5,930 - $1,100 = $4,830.
   - Taxes: $4,830 × 56% = $2,705.
   - After-Tax Cash Flow: $5,930 - $2,705 = **$3,225**.

2. **Future Sale (in 25 years):**
   - Building Depreciation Over 25 Years: $1,100 × 25 = $27,500.
   - Book Value of Building: $38,500 - $27,500 = $11,000.
   - Total Cost Basis: $11,000 (building) + $10,000 (land) = $21,000.
   - Selling Price: $40,000.
   - Gain: $40,000 - $21,000 = $19,000.
   - Tax on Gain: $19,000 × 25% = $4,750.
   - After-Tax Proceeds: $40,000 - $4,750 = **$35,250**.

3. **Present Worth of Cash Flows:**
   - **Rental Income:** $3,225 annually for 25 years. Using the annuity present worth factor:
     \[
     \text{Present Worth} = 3,225 \times \left[\frac{1 - (1 + 0.025)^{-25}}{0.025}\right] \approx 3,225 \times 18.408 \approx \$59,411.
     \]
   - **Future Sale Proceeds:** $35,250 in 25 years. Using the present worth factor:
     \[
     \text{Present Worth} = 35,250 \times \frac{1}{(1 + 0.025)^{25}} \approx 35,250 \times 0.5398 \approx \$19,026.
     \]
   - **Total Present Worth:** $59,411 + $19,026 = **$78,437**.

---

### **Comparison:**
- **Sell Now:** $102,125 (current after-tax proceeds).
- **Keep the Property:** $78,437 (present worth of future cash flows).

Since **$102,125 > $78,437**, Mr. Fields should sell the property now.
