Okay, so I need to figure out how many bits are required to store one BCD digit. Hmm, BCD stands for Binary-Coded Decimal, right? I remember that BCD is a way to represent decimal digits using binary codes. Each digit from 0 to 9 is represented by a specific binary pattern.

Wait, so each digit is 0 through 9. That's 10 possible values. Now, I need to think about how many bits are needed to represent each of these. In binary, each bit represents a power of 2. Let me think about the number of bits required to cover up to 9.

Let's see: 2 bits can represent 0-3 (since 2^2=4 possibilities). 3 bits can represent up to 7 (since 2^3=8). Oh wait, but 8 is 1000 in binary, which is 4 bits. Wait no, 3 bits can go from 0 to 7. But since BCD goes up to 9, 3 bits aren't enough because 3 bits max is 7. So that's not enough. So we need more bits.

Wait, 4 bits can represent up to 15 (since 2^4=16). So yes, 4 bits can cover 0-9 because 9 is less than 15. So each BCD digit uses 4 bits. 

But wait, how does BCD work exactly? Oh right, each digit is encoded using 4 bits. For example, the number 5 is 0101 in BCD. So each digit is stored as a 4-bit binary number. 

So the question is asking for the number of bits per BCD digit, which is 4. Looking at the options, option F is 4. So the answer should be F.

To determine how many bits are required to store one BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) digit, we start by noting that BCD represents each decimal digit (0-9) as a unique 4-bit binary code. For example, the digit 5 is represented as `0101` in BCD. Since there are 10 possible values (0 through 9), and 4 bits can represent up to 15 (2^4 = 16), this is sufficient to cover all decimal digits. Therefore, each BCD digit requires 4 bits.

The correct answer is:

F: 4

Answer: F
