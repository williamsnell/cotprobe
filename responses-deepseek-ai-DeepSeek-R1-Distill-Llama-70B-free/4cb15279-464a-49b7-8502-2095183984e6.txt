Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a profit-maximizing firm in the short run. Hmm. I remember that in economics, firms make decisions based on costs and revenues. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which statement is true. So, I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: The firm will shut down if marginal revenue equals marginal cost but exceeds average variable cost. Wait, no. If MR=MC, the firm is producing at the profit-maximizing level. The shutdown decision is based on whether total revenue covers variable costs. So if MR=MC but AVC is higher than MR, maybe? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the shutdown condition is when P < AVC. Because if the price is below AVC, the firm can't even cover variable costs, so it'll shut down. So if MR=MC and P is above AVC, the firm should continue. So A says they'll shut down when MR=MC but MR>AVC. That doesn't make sense because if MR=MC and MR>AVC, then P (which is MR in perfect competition) is above AVC, so they shouldn't shut down. So A is false.

Option B: The firm will continue to produce as long as total revenue exceeds total variable cost, even if it incurs loss. That sounds right. Because in the short run, firms continue if TR > TVC, even if TR < TC (which would mean a loss). They only shut down if TR < TVC, because then they can't cover variable costs. So B is true, but I'll check the other options to be sure.

Option C: The firm will shut down if average variable cost is greater than average total cost. Wait, AVC is part of ATC, right? ATC includes AVC and AFC. So if AVC > ATC, that would mean that AFC is negative, which doesn't make sense because costs can't be negative. So this situation can't happen. So C is false.

Option D: The firm will shut down if total revenue equals total variable cost. If TR = TVC, then profit is zero, but the firm is just breaking even on variable costs. Wait, no, because if TR = TVC, then total revenue minus variable cost is zero. So they're not making a profit, but they're covering variable costs. So they won't shut down because they can at least cover variable costs. They'll continue producing. So D is false.

Option E: The firm will shut down to minimize losses if product price falls below average total cost. Hmm. Wait, in the short run, the shutdown decision is based on whether price is below AVC. If the price is below AVC, they shut down. But if price is above AVC but below ATC, they continue but make a loss. So E says they shut down when price < ATC, which isn't correct. So E is false.

Option F: The firm will continue to produce as long as average fixed cost is less than average variable cost. Wait, AFC and AVC are both costs. AFC is fixed, so if AVC is greater than AFC, does that matter? I think the shutdown condition is about price relative to AVC, not AFC. So F doesn't make sense. Because even if AFC is higher, as long as price covers AVC, they'll produce. So F is false.

Option G: The firm will continue to produce as long as average variable cost is less than average fixed cost. That seems off. AVC being less than AFC doesn't directly affect the shutdown decision. The key is price compared to AVC. So G is probably false.

Option H: The firm will shut down if total variable cost exceeds total revenue. Oh, that makes sense. Because if TVC > TR, then the firm can't cover variable costs, so they'll shut down. So H is true. Wait, but I thought B was also true. Let me double-check.

B says "continue as long as TR > TVC, even if loss." H says "shut down if TVC > TR." So they're two sides of the same coin. If TR < TVC, shut down. So both B and H are correct in their respective scenarios. But the question is which is true. So both B and H seem correct, but I need to see the options again.

Wait, the question gives 10 options, and only one can be correct. Hmm. Let me think again. So the correct shutdown condition is when TR < TVC, so the firm shuts down. So H is correct. But what about B?

Option B says the firm continues as long as TR > TVC, which is correct. So both B and H are correct statements. But I don't think that's possible because the question expects only one correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Wait, no. The options are separate. So, let me make sure. So the correct answer could be either B or H, but let me see the options.

Wait, the options are A through J, so only one is correct. Let me think again about each.

H says the firm shuts down if TVC > TR. That's correct. So H is a true statement.

But B says the firm will continue as long as TR > TVC, even if incurring loss. That's also correct because TR could be less than TC (so loss), but as long as TR > TVC, they produce. So both B and H are correct statements. But that can't be because the question expects one answer.

Wait, but looking back, the options are 'which of the following is true', so perhaps both B and H are correct. But I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me re-examine the options.

Option B: ...even if it incurs loss. So when TR > TVC, but TR < TC, the firm incurs a loss but still produces. So B is correct.

Option H: ...shut down if TVC > TR. Which is correct because that's the shutdown point.

So, both B and H are correct? But that can't be right. The options can't have two correct answers.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Let me check the options.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the correct answer is one of them. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me think about each in more detail.

The shutdown rule: In the short run, a firm will shut down if the price is less than the average variable cost. Because if P < AVC, then even if they produce, they can't cover variable costs, and they're better off shutting down. So, equivalently, if TR (which is P * Q) is less than TVC (which is AVC * Q), the firm shuts down.

So, when TR < TVC, shut down (H is correct). When TR >= TVC, continue (B is correct). So both B and H are correct.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about which statement is true. So both B and H are correct statements. But that can't be; perhaps the options are structured so that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing on the specific conditions. Let me read each option again.

Option B says the firm continues as long as TR exceeds TVC, even if it incurs loss. Yes, that's correct. So B is true.

Option H says the firm shuts down if TVC exceeds TR. Yes, that's correct too. So H is also correct.

Wait, but that's a problem because the options are mutually exclusive. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Let me check each option again.

Looking back, the options are:

B: Continue as long as TR > TVC, even if loss.

H: Shut down if TVC > TR.

Yes, these are equivalent statements. So both B and H are correct. But in the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps only one of them is present in the options.

Wait, but the options are A to J, so perhaps the correct answer is H and B are both correct, but in reality, that's not possible because each option is a separate choice.

Wait, but the question is which is true. So if both statements are true, but in the options, both B and H are given, then perhaps the correct answers would be both, but since that's not possible, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about one of them. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because when TR > TVC, the firm continues. So B is correct.

When TR < TVC, the firm shuts down, so H is correct.

So both B and H are correct. But the options only allow one correct answer. Wait, perhaps looking again, the options may have only one correct.

Wait, perhaps in the options, only one is correct. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says "which of the following is true", so perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are structured so that only one is correct. Let me think about the actual correct economic principles.

In the short run, the firm's shutdown condition is when P < AVC. So, when TR = P * Q, and TVC = AVC * Q, so TR < TVC is equivalent to P < AVC.

So, H says the firm shuts down if TVC exceeds TR. That's correct.

B says that the firm continues as long as TR exceeds TVC, even if it incurs a loss (i.e., TR < TC). That's correct as well.

But the options are separate. So perhaps both B and H are correct, but that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps in the options, only H is correct. Or perhaps only B is correct. Let me think about what the options are.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B and H, but since that's not possible, let me check the options in the question again.

Wait, let me read all options again.

Option B: The firm will continue to produce as long as total revenue exceeds total variable cost, even if it incurs loss.

Option H: The firm will shut down if total variable cost exceeds total revenue.

So yes, both are correct. But that can't be, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Wait, in reality, both are correct, but perhaps only one is presented as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is both B and H, but in the given options, only one is correct. But the way the options are written, each is a separate statement, so perhaps both are correct, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option.

So which of the options is correct?

The correct statement is that the firm will produce if TR > TVC (B) and will shut down if TR < TVC (H). So both B and H are correct statements. But that's not possible, so perhaps I'm misreading the options.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps one is correct and the other is not.

Wait, in the options, H says "the firm will shut down if total variable cost exceeds total revenue." So TVC > TR → shut down. That's correct.

B says "the firm will continue to produce as long as TR exceeds TVC, even if it incurs loss." So TR > TVC → continue. Correct.

So both B and H are correct. But that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B. Because the question asks which is true. So perhaps both B and H are correct, but in the given options, only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in considering H. Let me think: if TVC > TR, then the firm cannot cover its variable costs, so it shuts down. So H is correct.

Similarly, B is correct because if TR > TVC, the firm continues, even if TR < TC (i.e., fixed costs are not covered, leading to a loss).

So both B and H are correct. But the options can't have both as correct. So perhaps only one is correct, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is B because it's a more general statement about the condition to continue production, which is the key concept. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other options that might be correct.

Let me check the other options again.

Option E: The firm will shut down to minimize losses if product price falls below average total cost. No, because the shutdown is based on AVC, not ATC. So E is incorrect.

Option I: The firm will continue to produce as long as total cost is less than total revenue. That's not correct. Because the firm continues as long as TR > TVC, not necessarily TR > TC. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The firm will continue to produce if average total cost is less than marginal cost. Not sure. Wait, MC is the same as MR in profit maximization. If ATC < MC, then MC must be higher than ATC, but I'm not sure how that relates to the shutdown decision. I think J is not correct.

So, the correct options are B and H, but since the question expects one answer, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. Because the question is about which is true of a profit-maximizing firm in the short run. So B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps H is correct. Let me think about what the options are.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B and H, but since that's not possible, let me check the options in the question again.

Wait, let me see the options again.

H says the firm shuts down if TVC exceeds TR. So when TVC > TR, the firm shuts down.

B says the firm continues as long as TR exceeds TVC, even if it incurs loss. So that's the opposite.

So, both are correct. But I can only choose one. So perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps only H is correct. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the correct economic concept is. The firm's shutdown condition is when P < AVC. So when TR = P*Q, TVC = AVC*Q. So TR < TVC is equivalent to P < AVC, leading to shutdown.

So, if TVC > TR, the firm shuts down (H is correct). If TR > TVC, the firm continues (B is correct). So both statements are correct.

But the options don't allow for both. Therefore, perhaps the intended correct answer is B and H, but since that's not possible, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the options again.

The correct answer, according to economics, is that the firm continues if TR > TVC (B) and shuts down if TR < TVC (H). So both are correct, but perhaps only one is an option.

Wait, looking at the options, B and H are both present. So perhaps the correct answer is both, but since the options are separate, I can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing whether the student knows that the firm will continue as long as TR > TVC, which is option B. So B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps H is correct. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B because it's a more direct statement about the condition for continuing production, which is the key point. So I'll go with B as the correct answer.

To determine which statement is true of a profit-maximizing firm in the short run, we analyze each option based on economic principles:

### Option A:
"The firm will shut down if marginal revenue equals marginal cost but exceeds average variable cost."  
This is incorrect. If MR = MC, the firm is producing at the profit-maximizing level. The shutdown decision depends on whether the price (P) is above average variable cost (AVC). If MR = MC and MR > AVC, the firm should continue producing. Thus, A is false.

---

### Option B:
"The firm will continue to produce as long as total revenue exceeds total variable cost, even if it incurs loss."  
This is correct. In the short run, a firm continues production as long as TR > TVC, even if TR < TC (resulting in a loss). The firm only shuts down if TR < TVC, as it cannot cover variable costs. Therefore, B is true.

---

### Option C:
"The firm will shut down if average variable cost is greater than average total cost."  
This is incorrect. AVC is a component of ATC (along with AFC). AVC > ATC would imply negative fixed costs, which is not possible. Thus, C is false.

---

### Option D:
"The firm will shut down if total revenue is equal to total variable cost."  
This is incorrect. If TR = TVC, the firm breaks even on variable costs and will not shut down. It will continue producing as long as TR ≥ TVC. Thus, D is false.

---

### Option E:
"The firm will shut down to minimize losses if product price falls below average total cost."  
This is incorrect. The shutdown decision is based on whether the price falls below AVC, not ATC. If P > AVC but P < ATC, the firm continues producing but incurs a loss. Thus, E is false.

---

### Option F:
"The firm will continue to produce as long as average fixed cost is less than average variable cost."  
This is incorrect. The shutdown decision is based on the relationship between price and AVC, not AFC. AFC is irrelevant to the shutdown decision. Thus, F is false.

---

### Option G:
"The firm will continue to produce as long as average variable cost is less than average fixed cost."  
This is incorrect. AVC being less than AFC is irrelevant to the shutdown decision. The firm’s decision depends on whether TR > TVC. Thus, G is false.

---

### Option H:
"The firm will shut down if total variable cost exceeds total revenue."  
This is correct. If TVC > TR, the firm cannot cover its variable costs and will shut down. This is consistent with the shutdown rule. Thus, H is true.

---

### Option I:
"The firm will continue to produce as long as total cost is less than total revenue."  
This is incorrect. The firm continues production as long as TR > TVC, not necessarily TR > TC. If TR > TVC but TR < TC, the firm incurs a loss but still produces. Thus, I is false.

---

### Option J:
"The firm will continue to produce if average total cost is less than marginal cost."  
This is incorrect. The shutdown decision is based on the relationship between price and AVC, not ATC and MC. Thus, J is false.

---

### Conclusion:
Both **B** and **H** are correct statements. However, since the question requires selecting only one answer, **B** is the more direct and comprehensive statement about the condition for continuing production in the short run.

**Answer: B**
