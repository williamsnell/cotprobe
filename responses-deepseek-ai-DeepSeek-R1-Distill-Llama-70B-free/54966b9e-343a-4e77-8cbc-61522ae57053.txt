Okay, so I have this question here about hormones and their functions. The question is asking which hormone acts antagonistically to parathormone. Hmm, I need to think about what parathormone does and then find a hormone that does the opposite.

Parathormone, also known as parathyroid hormone (PTH), I remember is involved in regulating calcium levels in the blood. When calcium levels drop, PTH is released. It works to increase calcium levels by acting on bones, kidneys, and the intestines. For example, it stimulates the bones to release calcium into the bloodstream and the kidneys to reabsorb more calcium.

Now, the question is about an antagonist. So I need a hormone that lowers blood calcium levels, opposing what PTH does. I think there's another hormone related to calcium regulation. Oh right, calcitonin! Calcitonin is produced by the thyroid gland, specifically the parafollicular cells. Its main function is to lower blood calcium levels when they get too high. It does this by inhibiting osteoclast activity in the bones, which reduces bone resorption and thus less calcium is released into the blood. Calcitonin also increases calcium excretion by the kidneys.

So, when PTH is high, it's trying to raise calcium. Calcitonin does the opposite, trying to lower it. They work in a balance to maintain calcium homeostasis. That makes them antagonistic in function.

Looking at the options, option F is Calcitonin. So the answer should be F.

The hormone that acts antagonistically to parathormone (PTH) is calcitonin. PTH increases blood calcium levels by promoting calcium release from bones and reducing excretion, while calcitonin lowers blood calcium by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing excretion. Therefore, calcitonin opposes the effects of PTH.

Answer: F
