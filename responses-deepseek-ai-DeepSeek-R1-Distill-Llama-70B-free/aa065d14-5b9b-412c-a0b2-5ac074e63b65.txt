Okay, so I've got this question here: "How many sides does a rhombus have?" And I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Hmm, let me think about this. I'm a bit fuzzy on my geometry, but I'll try to remember what a rhombus is.

Wait, a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral, right? Quadrilateral means four-sided. So that would mean a rhombus has four sides. But wait, I should make sure I'm not confusing it with other shapes. Like, a square is also a quadrilateral, and a rhombus is kind of like a diamond shape where all sides are equal, but the angles might not be 90 degrees. So yes, it's a four-sided figure.

Let me go through the options again. The options are A to J, each with different numbers. So A is 8, B is 3, C is 6, D is7, E is12, F is9, G is5, H is10, I is2, J is4. So the correct answer should be J:4.

Wait, did I get that right? Another way to think about it is the definition. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. Quadrilaterals have four sides by definition. So that definitely points to four sides.

I don't think I'm mixing it up with any other shapes. A triangle has three sides, which is option B, but that's not a rhombus. A pentagon has five sides, which is option G, but that's not it either. So yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is J:4.

The rhombus is a quadrilateral, meaning it has four sides. All sides of a rhombus are equal, and while it's similar to a square, its angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Among the given options, the correct number of sides is 4.

Answer: J
