Okay, so I have this limit problem to solve: the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin(2x)/x) raised to the power of (1+x). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, first, I remember that when dealing with limits, especially involving trigonometric functions, I should consider known limits and possibly use logarithms to simplify exponentials. Oh right, the limit of sin(ax)/x as x approaches 0 is a. So for sin(2x)/x, as x approaches 0, that should be 2, because a is 2 here. That makes sense.

So the base of the exponent, sin(2x)/x, approaches 2 as x approaches 0. Now, what about the exponent (1+x)? As x approaches 0, 1+x approaches 1. So the exponent is approaching 1. So putting it together, it's like 2^1, which is 2. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I should check if there are any subtleties here.

Wait, another thought: when x approaches 0, both the base and the exponent are approaching their limits. But when the base is approaching a finite number and the exponent is also approaching a finite number, the limit is just the base^exponent. So in this case, 2^1 would be 2. So the answer should be 2, which is option B.

Wait, but maybe I should consider using logarithms to handle the exponent more carefully. Let me try that approach. Taking the natural log of the function: ln[(sin(2x)/x)^(1+x)] = (1+x) * ln(sin(2x)/x). Then, find the limit of this as x approaches 0, and exponentiate the result.

So let's compute the limit of (1+x) * ln(sin(2x)/x) as x→0. As x approaches 0, sin(2x)/x approaches 2, so ln(2) is a constant. So (1+0)*ln(2) = ln(2). Then the exponential of ln(2) is 2. So yes, that confirms the earlier result.

Wait, but wait again: is there any possibility of an indeterminate form here? Let me think. The base sin(2x)/x as x approaches 0 is 2, which is a finite non-zero value. The exponent 1+x approaches 1, so the overall expression is 2^1, which is 2. So I don't see any indeterminate forms here, like 0^0 or infinity^0. So taking the logarithm was a good check, but it's not necessary because the form is straightforward.

So, the limit is 2. Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

To evaluate the limit of \((\sin(2x)/x)^{1+x}\) as \(x\) approaches 0, we analyze the behavior of the base and the exponent separately:

1. **Base**: The limit of \(\sin(2x)/x\) as \(x \to 0\) is a well-known result:  
   \[
   \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(2x)}{x} = 2.
   \]

2. **Exponent**: The limit of \(1+x\) as \(x \to 0\) is straightforward:  
   \[
   \lim_{x \to 0} (1+x) = 1.
   \]

Thus, the expression simplifies to \(2^1 = 2\). To confirm, we can take the natural logarithm of the function and compute the limit:  
\[
\ln\left((\sin(2x)/x)^{1+x}\right) = (1+x) \cdot \ln(\sin(2x)/x).
\]  
As \(x \to 0\), \(\sin(2x)/x \to 2\), so \(\ln(\sin(2x)/x) \to \ln(2)\). Therefore,  
\[
\lim_{x \to 0} (1+x) \cdot \ln(\sin(2x)/x) = \ln(2).
\]  
Exponentiating the result gives \(e^{\ln(2)} = 2\).

Since the base approaches a finite value and the exponent also approaches a finite value, there are no indeterminate forms like \(0^0\) or \(\infty^0\). The limit is simply \(2\).
