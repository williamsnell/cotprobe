Question:

A brick mason was hired by a builder under a written one-year contract, at an annual salary of $45,000, with employment to begin on March 1. Because the builder was unable to secure enough building contracts to keep all its employees busy during the season beginning March 1, it notified the brick mason on February 15 that it could not afford to employ him as a mason. At the same time, however, the builder offered to employ the mason, for the same contract period, as a night guard at an annual salary of $25,000. The mason declined the offer and remained unemployed during the year. No offer and remained unemployed during the year. No employment for brick masons was available in the community during the year, but the mason could have obtained other employment as a day laborer that would have paid up to $25,000 a year. At the end of the year, in an action against the builder for breach of contract, how much, if anything, is the mason entitled to recover?

Options:

A: $20,000 (the difference between the mason's contract price and the salary offered for the night guard position).
B: $45,000 (the contract price).
C: Nothing, because the mason turned down a reasonable alternative employment offer.
D: Nothing, because the mason did not mitigate his damages.
E: $20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment).
F: $45,000 plus damages for emotional distress.
G: Nothing, because the builder did not act in bad faith when it discharged the mason.
H: $25,000 (the amount he could have earned as a day laborer).
I: $45,000 minus any unemployment benefits the mason received during the year.
J: $25,000 (the amount he could have earned as a night guard).

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, there's a brick mason who was hired by a builder under a written one-year contract starting March 1, with a salary of $45,000 a year. But before the employment began, on February 15, the builder told the mason they couldn't afford to employ him as a mason because they didn't have enough contracts. However, they offered him a job as a night guard for the same period at $25,000 a year. The mason turned down this offer and stayed unemployed the whole year. 

Now, there's some important points here. First, no other brick mason jobs were available in the community that year. But the mason could have gotten work as a day laborer earning up to $25,000 a year. At the end of the year, the mason sued the builder for breach of contract. The question is how much, if anything, he can recover.

Hmm, so I need to think about contract law principles here. Specifically, I remember that when an employer breaches a contract, the employee is entitled to damages. But there's also the duty to mitigate damages, which means the employee must make reasonable efforts to find similar employment to minimize losses.

Wait, but in this case, the builder offered alternative employment as a night guard. The mason refused that and also didn't take the day laborer job. So does that affect his ability to recover damages?

I think the key issue is whether the alternative employment was "substantially similar" to the original job. If the new job is in the same field and at the same level, the employee is expected to accept it. But if it's a different kind of work, maybe the employee isn't required to take it.

The original job was as a brick mason, which is a skilled trade. The alternative offered was a night guard, which is a different type of work, probably less skilled and lower-paying. So maybe the mason wasn't obligated to accept that offer because it's not comparable.

But then, the mason also didn't take the day laborer job, which could have paid up to $25k. So does that mean he failed to mitigate damages? Because the day laborer position was available, even though it's not the same as his original job.

Wait, the duty to mitigate doesn't require the employee to take any job, but to take a comparable job. So if the day laborer job is in a different field and perhaps lower-skilled, maybe it's not considered comparable. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, some courts might say that any employment that could reasonably replace the lost income should be considered. So if the mason could have earned $25k as a day laborer, he might be expected to take that, even if it's not the same as his masonry work.

But wait, the builder offered him a night guard position, and he turned it down. Does that count as a failure to mitigate? Or is the builder's offer not a reasonable alternative?

I think the test is whether the alternative employment is of the same type or in the same field. Night guard work is different from masonry, so perhaps the mason wasn't required to accept that. However, the day laborer job might be considered a different situation.

So, if the mason didn't accept the day laborer position, does that mean he failed to mitigate? If so, his damages would be reduced by the amount he could have earned as a day laborer, which is $25k.

Wait, the original contract was for $45k. If he could have earned $25k elsewhere, then the damages would be the difference, which is $20k. But only if he was required to take that job.

Alternatively, if the day laborer job isn't comparable, then he might not have been required to take it, and thus his damages wouldn't be reduced.

I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to break it down.

1. Builder breached the contract by not employing the mason as agreed. So the mason is entitled to damages for that breach.

2. The measure of damages is typically the difference between what he was supposed to earn under the contract and what he actually earned or could have earned through mitigation.

3. The duty to mitigate requires the injured party to take reasonable steps to minimize loss. If the employee can find a similar job, they must take it; otherwise, the earnings from that job are deducted from the damages.

So, in this case, the mason didn't take the builder's offer of a night guard job. But was that a reasonable offer? Night guard is a different job, so maybe it's not a comparable position. So the mason wasn't obligated to accept it.

However, the mason also didn't take the day laborer job, which was available. But that's another type of work. So does the mason have a duty to accept any job, regardless of type, as long as it's available and pays?

No, I think the duty is to accept comparable employment. So if the day laborer job isn't comparable to masonry, he might not have to take it. But I'm not certain. Some courts might say that any employment that could have been taken to mitigate losses should be considered, regardless of the type.

Wait, another angle: the builder offered a job at $25k, which the mason turned down. The mason could have also earned $25k as a day laborer. So regardless of whether he took the builder's offer or another job, he could have earned the same amount.

But if he didn't take either, does that mean he failed to mitigate? Because he could have earned $25k elsewhere, whether through the builder's offer or another job.

So in that case, the mason's damages would be the contract price ($45k) minus the $25k he could have earned, resulting in $20k.

Looking at the options, option E is $20k, which is the contract price minus the $25k he could have earned.

Wait, but another thought: the builder's offer was for the same period as the original contract. So the mason could have worked as a night guard for $25k. If he refused that, perhaps he's not entitled to the full $45k because he didn't accept the alternative employment. But whether that alternative is a comparable position is key.

If the alternative is not comparable, then the employee doesn't have to accept it, and the employer can't reduce damages based on that offer. But the mason could have taken another job as a day laborer for the same $25k. So perhaps the $25k is what he could have earned, regardless of the source.

So the damages would be $45k minus $25k, which is $20k.

So the correct answer might be E.

Wait, but another option is A, which is the difference between $45k and $25k offered by the builder, which is also $20k. So both A and E result in $20k. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A: $20k (difference between contract and night guard offer).

E: $20k (contract price less $25k he could have earned as day laborer).

So which one applies?

In contract law, when an employer offers alternative employment, if the employee refuses, the employer can't deduct the amount of that offer from the damages unless the alternative was a substantially similar position.

In this case, the night guard job is different from masonry, so the mason wasn't required to accept it. Therefore, the builder can't deduct the $25k from the night guard offer.

However, the mason could have taken the day laborer job, which was available. So the question is, does the mason have a duty to mitigate by taking that job, even though it's a different type of work?

I think the duty to mitigate doesn't require the employee to take any job, but only comparable employment. So unless the day laborer job is considered comparable, the mason isn't required to take it. But I'm not sure if courts consider any available employment, regardless of type, as part of the mitigation.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions might allow the employer to deduct any earnings the employee could have made, regardless of the job type. So if the mason could have earned $25k as a day laborer, that amount would be subtracted from the contract price.

In that case, the mason's recovery would be $45k - $25k = $20k, which is option E.

Alternatively, if the alternative employment offer from the builder (night guard) isn't comparable, then the mason isn't required to accept it, but if he could have found other work (day laborer), then he should have taken that. So the $25k from the day laborer would reduce his damages.

So the correct answer would be E: $20k.

Wait, but another point: the mason was unemployed the entire year, and no brick mason jobs were available. So he couldn't find a comparable job in his field. Therefore, he might not be required to take a different type of job. So maybe he isn't required to mitigate by taking the day laborer job, because it's not comparable.

In that case, the mason's damages would be the full contract price, $45k, because he couldn't find comparable employment. But wait, he could have taken a day laborer job, but that's not in his field. So is that considered comparable?

I think the key here is that the duty to mitigate requires the employee to take comparable employment, not just any job. So if the day laborer job isn't comparable, he isn't required to take it, and thus his damages wouldn't be reduced by that amount.

In that case, the mason would be entitled to the full $45k because the builder breached the contract, and the mason couldn't find comparable work. But wait, the builder offered alternative employment, but it was as a night guard, which isn't comparable. So the mason wasn't required to accept that.

So in that scenario, the mason's recovery would be the full $45k minus any amounts he could have earned in comparable employment. But since there were no comparable jobs available, he doesn't have to deduct anything.

Wait, but the mason could have earned $25k as a day laborer. If that's considered comparable, then he has to deduct it. But if not, he doesn't. So the question is whether day laborer is comparable to brick masonry.

Brick masonry is a skilled trade, and day laborer is more general labor, perhaps unskilled. So they might not be considered comparable.

Therefore, the mason's damages wouldn't be reduced by the $25k because it's not comparable. So he would be entitled to the full $45k.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B is $45k. So would that be the case?

Alternatively, another angle: even if the alternative job isn't comparable, the mason has a duty to accept it to mitigate damages. But I'm not sure about that.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall the relevant law. The general rule is that when an employer wrongfully discharges an employee, the employee must make reasonable efforts to seek and accept employment in the same or similar line of work. If the employee can't find such work, the employee is entitled to the full contract amount.

In this case, the mason couldn't find any brick mason work because none was available. So he satisfied the duty to mitigate as to that. The day laborer job is a different line of work, so he wasn't required to take it. Therefore, he can recover the full $45k.

Wait, but that would mean the correct answer is option B: $45k.

But wait, some courts might hold that the employee must take any employment that would reduce the losses, regardless of whether it's in the same field. So if the mason could have earned $25k as a day laborer, he should have done so, and thus his recovery is reduced by that amount.

I'm a bit torn between options B and E.

Looking back at the question, the mason was offered a night guard job. He turned it down. But the day laborer job was another option he didn't take. So under the duty to mitigate, does he have to take any job, regardless of type, to reduce damages?

I think the correct approach is that the employee only needs to seek comparable employment. If that's not available, he doesn't have to take non-comparable work. So in this case, since brick mason jobs weren't available, and the other jobs offered were different, he isn't required to take them. Therefore, his damages are the full $45k.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say that the employee must make reasonable efforts to find any employment, not necessarily in the same field. So if he can earn some income, even in a different field, he must do so to mitigate.

For example, in some cases, courts have held that an employee must accept any kind of employment that a reasonable person would take under the circumstances, even if it's a different type of work. So if the mason could have earned $25k as a day laborer, he might be required to do so, reducing his damages to $20k.

I think that's the more modern approach. So the duty to mitigate isn't limited to the same field. Therefore, the mason's damages would be $45k minus $25k, which is $20k, so option E.

But wait, another point: the builder offered the night guard job, which the mason turned down. If the night guard job was a reasonable offer, then the mason's failure to accept it could be seen as a failure to mitigate, reducing his recovery by the $25k.

But since the night guard job is different from masonry, perhaps it's not a reasonable offer. So the builder can't deduct that amount, but the mason could have taken the day laborer job, which was available elsewhere.

In that case, the mason's damages are reduced by the $25k he could have earned as a day laborer, leading to $20k, option E.

I think that's the right approach. So the answer is E.

The question revolves around a brick mason's entitlement to damages after a builder breached their employment contract. The mason was offered alternative employment as a night guard at a lower salary, which he declined, and he also did not pursue available day laborer work that could have earned him $25,000 annually. The key issue is whether the mason fulfilled his duty to mitigate damages by seeking comparable employment or any reasonable employment.

1. **Breach of Contract**: The builder breached the contract by failing to employ the mason as agreed. This entitles the mason to damages.

2. **Duty to Mitigate**: The mason has a duty to take reasonable steps to minimize losses. This includes seeking comparable employment or, under some interpretations, any reasonable employment that could reduce the loss.

3. **Alternative Employment Offered by the Builder**: The builder offered the mason a night guard position at $25,000 annually. However, this job was not comparable to the skilled trade of brick masonry. Courts generally do not require employees to accept non-comparable employment, so the mason was not obligated to accept this offer.

4. **Day Laborer Employment**: The mason could have earned $25,000 annually as a day laborer. While this job was not in the same field as brick masonry, the duty to mitigate may require the mason to accept any reasonable employment that reduces losses, even if it is not comparable.

5. **Calculation of Damages**: If the mason is required to mitigate by accepting the day laborer position, his damages would be reduced by the $25,000 he could have earned. This results in damages of $45,000 (contract price) minus $25,000 (mitigated earnings), totaling $20,000.

6. **Conclusion**: The mason's failure to accept the day laborer position, which was reasonable and available, constitutes a failure to mitigate. Therefore, his recovery is limited to $20,000.
