Okay, so I need to figure out the federal income tax for Jerry Kohen. Let's see, the question gives me some information and a partial tax table. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, Jerry's annual income is $8,975. He's married and filing a joint tax return with his wife. They have two dependent children, so that probably means they have four exemptions in total—since each person in the household (Jerry, his wife, and two kids) counts as an exemption. Wait, no, wait. The standard deduction mentioned in the table is for four exemptions, so that's probably correct.

The tax table provided is a partial one, showing different income brackets and the corresponding tax amounts based on filing status. The columns are for single individuals and married filing jointly.

So, the question is asking for the federal income tax Jerry would pay. Let me look at the table again. The rows show ranges of adjusted gross income (AGI) and the tax owed based on whether you're single or married filing jointly.

The income given is $8,975. Now, looking at the table, the first column shows ranges starting at $4,950 up to $10,000. Let me see the applicable row for $8,975.

Looking through the rows:

- At least $7,950 but less than $8,000: tax is $628 (single) or $565 (joint).
- Next row: at least $8,950 but less than $9,000: tax is $822 (single) or $739 (joint).
Wait, wait. Wait, $8,975 is between $8,950 and $9,000? No, wait, $8,950 is the start of the next bracket. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, the table seems to be in increments of $1,000. Let me list the rows properly:

Row 1: $4,950 - $5,000 → tax $96 (single), $95 (joint)
Row 2: $5,950 - $6,000 → $255 / $241
Row 3: $6,950 - $7,000 → $438 / $398
Row 4: $7,950 - $8,000 → $628 / $565
Row 5: $8,950 - $9,000 → $822 / $739
Row 6: $9,950 - $10,000 → $1001 / $901

Wait, but Jerry's income is $8,975. That's between $8,950 and $9,000. So according to the table, if the AGI is at least $8,950 but less than $9,000, the tax for married filing jointly would be $739.

But wait, let me double-check. The first column is the "And you are" part. So for married filing jointly, the tax is the second number in each row.

So for the row where AGI is at least $8,950 but less than $9,000, the married filing jointly tax is $739.

So the tax would be $739. Looking at the options, option D is $739.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm reading the table correctly. The columns are:

- Single, not head of household
- Married, filing joint return

Yes, so the second number in each row is for married joint filers.

Therefore, for $8,975, which falls into the $8,950-$9,000 bracket, the tax is $739. So the correct answer is D.

To determine Jerry Kohen's federal income tax, we use the provided tax table. Jerry is married, filing a joint tax return, and his annual income is $8,975. The table categorizes income ranges and lists the corresponding tax amounts based on filing status.

The relevant row for Jerry's income is:

- **At least $8,950 but less than $9,000**: Tax for married filing jointly is **$739**.

Thus, Jerry's federal income tax is **$739**, which corresponds to option D.
