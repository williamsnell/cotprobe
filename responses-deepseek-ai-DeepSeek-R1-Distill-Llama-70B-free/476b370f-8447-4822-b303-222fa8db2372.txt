Okay, so I've got this question here about George betting on the Bulls. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these finance concepts, but let's try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

George is placing an even-money $100,000 bet on the Bulls to win the NBA Finals. His utility function is logarithmic, and his current wealth is $1,000,000. We need to find the minimum probability he believes the Bulls will win.

Wait, even-money bet means that the payout is 1:1, right? So if he bets $100,000 and wins, he gains $100,000, making his total wealth $1,100,000. If he loses, he's down to $900,000.

Logarithmic utility function, u(w) = ln(w). So the expected utility after the bet should be equal to his current utility without the bet, since it's a fair bet in terms of expected value, but he's choosing to take it because of his risk preferences. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, when someone has a logarithmic utility function, they are risk-averse. The idea is that the marginal utility of wealth decreases as wealth increases. So when considering a bet, the expected utility should be at least equal to the utility of their current wealth for them to be indifferent. But wait, since he's taking the bet, maybe he expects higher utility, meaning the expected utility after the bet is equal to or higher than the current utility.

Wait, but in this case, he places the bet, so perhaps we're looking for the probability p where the expected utility of the bet equals his current utility. Because if the expected utility is higher than current, he would prefer the bet, but since the question is about the minimum probability he must believe, maybe that's the point where he's indifferent between betting and not betting.

Wait, I'm a bit mixed up. Let's think. The expected utility with the bet should be equal to the utility of his current wealth. Because if the expected utility is higher, he would prefer the bet, so the minimum probability is when the expected utility equals his current utility, making him indifferent. That makes sense.

So his current utility is u(1,000,000) = ln(1,000,000). 

After the bet, with probability p, his wealth is 1,100,000, and with probability (1-p), it's 900,000. 

So the expected utility is p * ln(1,100,000) + (1-p) * ln(900,000).

Set this equal to ln(1,000,000):

p * ln(1,100,000) + (1-p) * ln(900,000) = ln(1,000,000)

I can write this equation and solve for p.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for logarithms. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute without approximations.

Let me compute each term numerically. Let's compute the natural logs.

First, ln(1,000,000) is ln(10^6) which is 6 * ln(10). Ln(10) is approximately 2.302585, so 6 * 2.302585 ≈ 13.8155.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1,000,000 is 10^6, so ln(10^6) = 6 * ln(10) ≈ 6 * 2.302585 ≈ 13.8155.

Similarly, ln(1,100,000) is ln(1.1e6) = ln(1.1) + ln(1e6) = ln(1.1) + 13.8155. Ln(1.1) is approximately 0.09531, so 0.09531 + 13.8155 ≈ 13.9108.

Similarly, ln(900,000) is ln(9e5) = ln(9) + ln(1e5) = ln(9) + 5 * ln(10). Ln(9) is about 2.1972, and 5 * 2.302585 ≈ 11.5129. So ln(9e5) ≈ 2.1972 + 11.5129 ≈ 13.7101.

So now, plugging into the equation:

p * 13.9108 + (1-p) * 13.7101 = 13.8155

Expanding this:

13.9108 p + 13.7101 - 13.7101 p = 13.8155

Combine like terms:

(13.9108 - 13.7101) p + 13.7101 = 13.8155

13.9108 -13.7101 is 0.2007.

So 0.2007 p + 13.7101 = 13.8155

Subtract 13.7101 from both sides:

0.2007 p = 13.8155 - 13.7101 = 0.1054

So p = 0.1054 / 0.2007 ≈ Let me calculate that.

0.1054 divided by 0.2007. Let's see, 0.2 is 1/5, so 0.1054 is about half of 0.2007. So approximately 0.525.

So p ≈ 0.525.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.525. So the answer should be A.

To determine the minimum probability \( p \) that George believes the Bulls will win, we use his logarithmic utility function \( u(w) = \ln(w) \). George is currently indifferent between his current wealth of $1,000,000 and the expected utility of the $100,000 bet. The expected utility of the bet is calculated as:

\[
E[u] = p \cdot \ln(1,100,000) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(900,000)
\]

We set this equal to the utility of his current wealth:

\[
p \cdot \ln(1,100,000) + (1-p) \cdot \ln(900,000) = \ln(1,000,000)
\]

Using approximations for the natural logarithms:
- \( \ln(1,000,000) = \ln(10^6) = 6 \cdot \ln(10) \approx 13.8155 \)
- \( \ln(1,100,000) = \ln(1.1 \cdot 10^6) = \ln(1.1) + \ln(10^6) \approx 0.09531 + 13.8155 = 13.9108 \)
- \( \ln(900,000) = \ln(0.9 \cdot 10^6) = \ln(0.9) + \ln(10^6) \approx -0.10536 + 13.8155 = 13.7101 \)

Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
p \cdot 13.9108 + (1-p) \cdot 13.7101 = 13.8155
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
13.9108p + 13.7101 - 13.7101p = 13.8155
\]

\[
(13.9108 - 13.7101)p + 13.7101 = 13.8155
\]

\[
0.2007p + 13.7101 = 13.8155
\]

\[
0.2007p = 0.1054
\]

\[
p = \frac{0.1054}{0.2007} \approx 0.525
\]

Thus, the minimum probability George must believe the Bulls will win is approximately **0.525**.
