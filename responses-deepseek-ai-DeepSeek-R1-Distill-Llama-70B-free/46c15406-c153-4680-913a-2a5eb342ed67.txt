Okay, I need to figure out what passive personality jurisdiction is. I remember that jurisdiction refers to which country's courts have the authority to hear a case. There are different types like territorial jurisdiction, active personality, passive personality, and universal jurisdiction.

So, passive personality must relate to some aspect of nationality. I think active personality is when a country claims jurisdiction because its nationals committed the crime. So, the opposite of that would be passive personality, which is probably when the victim is a national of the country, and the country wants to prosecute someone for harming their citizen.

Looking at the options:

Option D says it's based on the nationality of the victims. That fits because passive personality is about the victim's nationality.

Let me double-check. Active personality is the nationality of the offender, so that's option B. Passive is the victim, so D makes sense.

Other options don't fit. A is about where a legal person is registered, which is more like corporate jurisdiction. C is about the relationship between victim and offender, which I don't think is a standard basis. E is severity, which isn't a primary jurisdictional basis. F is where planned, which is more about conspiracy maybe. G is international law, which could be universal jurisdiction. H is residence of offender, like where they live. I is where the offence happened, which is territorial. J is nationality of witness, which I don't think is a thing.

So the answer should be D.

Passive personality jurisdiction refers to a country claiming legal authority to prosecute based on the nationality of the victim. This is distinct from active personality jurisdiction, which focuses on the nationality of the offender. Among the given options, option D correctly identifies that passive personality jurisdiction is based on the nationality of the victims.

Answer: D
