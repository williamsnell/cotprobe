Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation using the sum of the years' digits method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

Alright, Bob bought a car for $10,000. The car's expected to last 10 years and have no residual value. The question is asking how much it depreciates during the seventh year. He uses the sum of the years' digits method. Oh right, I remember that method is a type of accelerated depreciation, right?

Wait, so the sum of the years' digits method works by calculating an annual depreciation rate. The formula for the rate is (remaining years)/sum of years. The sum of the years' digits for 10 years would be 1+2+3+...+10. Let me calculate that. Oh wait, the sum of the first n integers is n(n+1)/2. So for n=10, that's 10*11/2 = 55. Right, so the sum is 55.

Each year, the depreciation rate is (10 - current year + 1) divided by 55. So for the seventh year, the current year is 7, so 10 -7 +1 =4? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps I got that wrong. Another way to think: for year 1, the rate is 10/55, year 2 is 9/55, and so on until year 10, which is 1/55. Oh, right! Because each year, the numerator decreases by 1. So year 1: 10/55, year 2:9/55, ..., year7: (10-7+1)=4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, year 7 would be 10 - 7 +1? No, that would be 4. Wait, no, maybe it's (10 - (year-1)). Hmm, maybe I should think of each year's fraction as (n+1 - year) where n=10. So for year 7, it's 10 -7 +1=4? So 4/55. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

Alternatively, the pattern is that the depreciation each year is a fraction of the asset's cost. The fraction for each year is ( (10 + 1 - year) ) / sum. So for year 7, it's (10+1 -7)=4. So 4/55.

Wait, let me confirm. Year 1: 10/55, Year 2:9/55, Year3:8/55, Year4:7/55, Year5:6/55, Year6:5/55, Year7:4/55, Year8:3/55, Year9:2/55, Year10:1/55. Yes, that adds up correctly because 10+9+8+...+1=55.

So for the seventh year, the depreciation expense is (4/55) of the cost. The cost is $10,000. So 4/55 *10,000 = (40,000)/55. Let me compute that. 40,000 divided by 55. 

Hmm, 55 times 727 is 727*50=36,350 and 727*5=3,635, so 36,350+3,635=39,985. That's under 40,000. The difference is 15. So 727.27 approximately? Because 55 * 727.27 is 40,000. So 727.27 each?

Wait, wait, let me compute 40,000 /55. Let me do it step by step. 55 goes into 400 (the first three zeros) how many times? 55*7=385, which is less than 400, 55*7=385, 55*7=385, so 7*100=700, but wait, perhaps I should do 40,000 divided by 55.

Compute 55 * 727 = 727 * 50 = 36,350; 727 *5=3,635. Total 39,985. Then 40,000 - 39,985 = 15. So 15/55 = 0.2727... So 727.2727... So approximately $727.27.

Wait a second, but looking at the options, option G is $727.27. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. So 10,000 multiplied by 4/55. 10,000 *4=40,000. 40,000 divided by 55.

Let me compute 40,000 /55.

55 * 700 = 38,500. 40,000 -38,500=1,500.

55*27=1,485. So 700+27=727, and 1,500-1,485=15. So 727 with a remainder of 15, so .15/55 is 0.2727..., so yeah, 727.2727... So $727.27.

Looking at the options, that's option G.

Wait, but wait another thing. The sum of the years' digits method. Let me make sure I'm applying it correctly. The method is that each year's depreciation is (remaining life) / (sum of years). Sum is 55. Remaining life at the start of year 7 would be 4 years (since the total is 10, so 10-7+1=4? Wait, no, because the asset is depreciated over 10 years. At the beginning of year 7, the asset has 4 years left (year7,8,9,10). So yes, the rate is 4/55.

So yes, the depreciation in year 7 is 4/55 *10,000= $727.27.

To determine the depreciation during the seventh year using the sum of the years' digits method, we start by calculating the sum of the digits for the 10-year period. The sum of the first 10 integers is:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{10 \cdot (10 + 1)}{2} = 55
\]

Under this method, the depreciation rate for each year is calculated as:

\[
\text{Rate for Year } n = \frac{\text{Remaining life at the start of Year } n}{\text{Sum of years' digits}}
\]

For the seventh year, the remaining life at the start of the year is:

\[
10 - 7 + 1 = 4 \, \text{years}
\]

Thus, the depreciation rate for the seventh year is:

\[
\text{Rate for Year 7} = \frac{4}{55}
\]

The depreciation expense for the seventh year is then calculated as:

\[
\text{Depreciation} = \text{Cost of the asset} \cdot \text{Rate for Year 7}
\]

Given the car's cost is $10,000, the depreciation for the seventh year is:

\[
\text{Depreciation} = 10,000 \cdot \frac{4}{55} = \frac{40,000}{55} \approx 727.27
\]

Thus, the depreciation during the seventh year is approximately $727.27. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: $727.27**
