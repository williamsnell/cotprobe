Okay, I need to figure out what the "crowding-out" effect refers to. I remember that this term has to do with economics, probably related to fiscal policy or monetary policy. Let me think about what I learned in my classes.

So, crowding out, as I recall, is when an increase in government borrowing leads to higher interest rates. This makes it harder for private businesses and individuals to borrow money because the cost of borrowing (interest rates) goes up. So essentially, the government's borrowing is "crowding out" private investment.

Wait, but when does the government borrow? Usually when it's running a budget deficit, right? Like if they're spending more than they're taking in through taxes. So the government issues more bonds to finance that deficit. More bonds on the market mean that the government is competing with private businesses for funds. Because the government is borrowing a lot, interest rates rise. Higher interest rates make it more expensive for businesses to borrow, so they might invest less. That's the crowding-out effect.

Now, looking at the options. Let me go through each one to see which fits.

Option A: Higher interest rates from borrowing to conduct contractionary fiscal policy. Contractionary fiscal policy would mean the government is reducing spending or raising taxes, which might lead to a budget surplus. So they might not need to borrow as much. If anything, contractionary fiscal policy could lead to lower interest rates because the government isn't borrowing as much. So A is probably not right.

Option B: Lower interest rates from borrowing for expansionary monetary policy. Wait, expansionary monetary policy is usually handled by the central bank, like the Fed, cutting interest rates or buying bonds. But this option says the borrowing is for fiscal policy, so maybe not. Also, lower rates don't seem to fit with crowding out, which is about higher rates.

Option C: Lower interest rates due to borrowing for contractionary fiscal policy. Again, contractionary fiscal policy might involve less borrowing, so lower rates could happen, but that's the opposite of crowding out.

Option D: Lower rates from reduced borrowing because of expansionary fiscal policy. Wait, expansionary fiscal policy would mean more spending, so more borrowing. So D says reduced borrowing, which doesn't fit. Plus, lower rates again.

Option E: Lower rates from increased borrowing for expansionary monetary policy. No, expansionary monetary policy is about the central bank's actions, not the government borrowing. Also, lower rates don't match crowding out.

Option F: Higher interest rates from borrowing for expansionary fiscal policy. Oh, this sounds right. Expansionary fiscal policy means the government is increasing spending or cutting taxes, leading to a larger deficit. They borrow more, which increases interest rates. That's the crowding-out effect.

Option G: Higher rates from contractionary monetary policy. Contractionary monetary policy is when the central bank raises interest rates or reduces the money supply. But this option is about borrowing, which relates to fiscal policy, not monetary. So G might not be correct.

Option H and I: Neutral policies, so probably not. Crowding out is more about active expansionary policies.

Option J: Higher rates from reduced borrowing due to contractionary fiscal. If borrowing is reduced, rates would go down, so J is the opposite.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be F. Because expansionary fiscal policy leads to increased government borrowing, which raises interest rates and crowds out private investment.

The "crowding-out" effect occurs when an increase in government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, making it more expensive for private businesses and individuals to borrow money. This typically happens during expansionary fiscal policy, where the government increases spending or cuts taxes, resulting in a larger budget deficit. To finance this deficit, the government issues more bonds, which increases demand for funds in the financial markets. This increased demand drives up interest rates, reducing private investment as borrowing becomes more costly. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, G, H, I, J**: These options either describe contractionary policies, neutral policies, or reduced borrowing, which do not align with the crowding-out effect.
- **B, C, D, E**: These options mention lower interest rates, which contradict the crowding-out effect, as it is characterized by rising interest rates.
- **F**: This correctly describes higher interest rates resulting from borrowing to conduct expansionary fiscal policy, which aligns with the crowding-out effect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: F
