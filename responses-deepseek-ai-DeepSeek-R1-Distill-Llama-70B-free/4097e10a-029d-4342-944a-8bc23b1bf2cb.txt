Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it again carefully.

The question says that a dominant trait has a fitness of 0.6. The frequency of this trait in the population is 1 in 8,000. I need to find the mutation rate. The options are from A to J with various values.

Hmm, I remember that mutation rates often relate to how alleles spread or are maintained in a population. But wait, this is about a dominant trait, which probably means it's under selection. Oh right, selection can influence allele frequencies.

So the key here is probably the relationship between mutation rate, selection, and allele frequency. I think I remember something called the mutation-selection balance. That's when the introduction of a deleterious allele (by mutation) is balanced by its removal due to selection.

The formula I vaguely recall is q = (mutation rate) / (selection coefficient). Or wait, is it q = u / (s), where u is the mutation rate and s is the selection coefficient against the allele?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The fitness given is 0.6 for the dominant trait. So if the trait is dominant, maybe the fitness refers to the genotype. Let's clarify: in genetics, fitness usually refers to the genotype's viability. So a fitness of 0.6 would mean that individuals with that genotype have 60% fitness compared to others.

But wait, the dominant trait's frequency is given. So I'm assuming this is the frequency of the dominant allele. Let me think. Let's denote the dominant allele as A and the recessive as a. The dominant trait would be expressed in AA and Aa genotypes. But for rare alleles, the frequency of the dominant trait is approximately equal to the allele frequency, because Aa is the main contributor when q is small. Wait, but the frequency given is 1 in 8,000, which is 0.000125. That's a very low frequency. So q is 0.000125.

Wait, but the selection coefficient. The fitness given is 0.6, which is lower than 1. That suggests that the trait is selected against, right? Because a fitness of 1 is the highest, and anything lower is less fit. So if an organism has this dominant trait, it's at a disadvantage.

So the selection coefficient s is 1 - fitness. So s = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. So the selection against the allele is 40%.

But wait, the mutation-selection balance equation, I think it's for a recessive allele. Oh wait, no. Wait, for a dominant allele, the selection is stronger because the phenotype is expressed in both heterozygotes and homozygotes. Whereas for a recessive allele, only the homozygotes are selected against.

Wait, but in this question, the trait is dominant, so any allele A will express the trait. So the selection acts on all A carriers, both AA and Aa. So the average fitness for the allele A would be calculated as the sum of the fitnesses of the genotypes weighted by their frequencies.

Wait, maybe I should think of the model where the allele is maintained by mutation in the face of selection against it. So the mutation rate introduces new A alleles, but selection removes them.

The formula I think is q ≈ u / (h s), where h is the dominance coefficient. Wait, no, that's for selection against a recessive allele, perhaps. Or wait, for a dominant allele, the selection is stronger, so maybe q ≈ u / s. Because when the allele is dominant, every copy is expressed, so selection is strong.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

Let me recall: in mutation-selection balance, the equilibrium frequency q of a deleterious allele is given by q = u / (s), where u is the mutation rate (per generation) from the wild type to the deleterious allele, and s is the selection coefficient against the deleterious allele.

But wait, I think that's only for recessive alleles. Because for a dominant allele, selection is much stronger, so the equilibrium frequency would be lower. So maybe q = u / (s), but only for dominant.

Wait, no. Wait, no, in the case of dominant alleles, selection is more efficient, so the equilibrium frequency is lower. So the formula for a dominant allele is q ≈ u / s.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information in my head. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe it's more accurate to start with the standard model.

The standard formula for mutation-selection balance when selection is against a dominant allele is q ≈ u / (s), where s is the selection coefficient.

So in this case, the frequency q is given as 1 in 8,000, which is 0.000125. So 0.000125 = u / s.

We have s as 0.4, since the fitness is 0.6, so s = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.

So solving for u, we get u = q * s.

Plugging in the numbers, u = 0.000125 * 0.4.

Wait, 0.000125 * 0.4 equals 0.00005. Which is 5e-5.

Looking at the options, option E is 5.0e-5. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have gotten the formula wrong. Because some sources say that for dominant alleles, the mutation-selection balance is q ≈ u / (h s), where h is the dominance coefficient. But in this case, the trait is dominant, so h=1. So the formula would simplify to u = q * s, same as before.

So yeah, I think the calculation is correct. So the mutation rate would be 5e-5. So the answer is E.

To solve the problem, we use the concept of mutation-selection balance, which describes the equilibrium frequency of a deleterious allele maintained by mutation in the face of selection. The formula for the equilibrium frequency of a dominant allele is:

\[
q = \frac{u}{s}
\]

Where:
- \( q \) is the frequency of the deleterious allele,
- \( u \) is the mutation rate,
- \( s \) is the selection coefficient.

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- The frequency of the dominant trait (\( q \)) is given as \( \frac{1}{8000} = 0.000125 \).
- The fitness of the dominant trait is \( 0.6 \), so the selection coefficient \( s \) is calculated as:

\[
s = 1 - \text{fitness} = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the mutation rate (\( u \))
Rearranging the formula \( q = \frac{u}{s} \), we solve for \( u \):

\[
u = q \cdot s
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
u = 0.000125 \cdot 0.4 = 0.00005
\]

This is equivalent to \( 5.0 \times 10^{-5} \).

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated mutation rate matches option **E: \( 5.0 \times 10^{-5} \)**.

### Final Answer
E
