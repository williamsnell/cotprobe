Question:

On November 1, Beeson contracted to purchase from Sloan for $250,000 certain property located in the City of La Mirada. In the contract of sale, Beeson and Sloan agreed that the property was to be used for the purpose of building a commercial shopping mall. The contract required Beeson to pay Sloan a deposit of $12,500, with the balance of the purchase price payable at closing a month later on December 1. On November 24, the city council rezoned the property so that it could be used only for single-family residential purposes. As a consequence, Beeson refused to honor the contract. Sloan now brings an action for specific performance arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer. Beeson argues that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because

Options:

A: legal title remained in Sloan.
B: The property's value decreased substantially due to the rezoning.
C: Sloan failed to disclose potential rezoning risks.
D: Beeson had not yet paid the full purchase price.
E: The contract was not legally binding.
F: Sloan assumed the risk.
G: equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.
H: Sloan would be unjustly enriched.
I: The city council's decision was unforeseeable.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about real estate law, specifically dealing with contracts and the doctrine of equitable conversion. Hmm, I remember that equitable conversion has something to do with when the buyer is treated as the owner for certain purposes even before the actual transfer of title. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that Beeson contracted to buy property from Sloan for $250,000. The contract was made on November 1st, with a deposit of $12,500, and the balance due on December 1st. So, closing was supposed to happen a month later. The purpose of the purchase was to build a commercial shopping mall, as both parties agreed in the contract.

Then, on November 24th, the city council rezoned the property. Now it can only be used for single-family residential purposes. Because of this, Beeson backed out of the contract. Now Sloan is suing for specific performance, arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion puts the loss on the buyer, Beeson.

Beeson's defense is that enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive for him. The question is why the judgment would be in favor of Beeson, meaning Sloan's specific performance claim fails.

The options are A through I. Let's go through them.

Option A: Legal title remained in Sloan. Well, yes, because the closing hadn't happened yet. So Sloan still holds legal title. But how does that affect the doctrine of equitable conversion? I think under equitable conversion, once the contract is made, the risk of loss shifts to the buyer. So even if the seller still has legal title, the buyer is treated as the owner and bears the risk. So if something happens to the property, like rezoning, the buyer is responsible. So in that case, Sloan would be entitled to specific performance because Beeson has the risk. But Beeson is arguing that enforcing the contract is harsh. So maybe this isn't the reason the judgment is for Beeson.

Option B: The property's value decreased substantially due to rezoning. That makes sense. If the rezoning made the property less valuable for Beeson's intended use, then the property's value would drop. But how does that affect the enforceability? I think the doctrine of equitable conversion would mean that Beeson bears the risk of any changes in the property's value. So Sloan could still force the sale, but Beeson would have to pay the full price even though the value is lower. But the question is about why the court might side with Beeson. So if the value decreased, maybe the court finds it unfair to make Beeson pay the same price. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option C: Sloan failed to disclose potential rezoning risks. Did Sloan know about the possible rezoning? The question doesn't say anything about Sloan knowing or not. It just says the city council did it on Nov 24. So maybe this is about misrepresentation or failure to disclose. But I don't think the facts mention anything about Sloan hiding information. So this might not be the reason.

Option D: Beeson had not yet paid the full purchase price. Well, he only paid the deposit. But under specific performance, the buyer would have to pay the balance. So I don't think this is the reason the court would rule for Beeson. Because the court can order specific performance, requiring payment.

Option E: The contract was not legally binding. That seems unlikely because the question states that there was a contract. So unless there's some issue with formation, like capacity, consideration, etc., but nothing in the question suggests that. So E is probably not the right answer.

Option F: Sloan assumed the risk. Wait, under equitable conversion, it's the buyer who assumes the risk. So if Sloan assumed the risk, that would mean Beeson isn't liable. But that contradicts the doctrine. So maybe this is the opposite of what's happening. So perhaps F is incorrect.

Option G: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain. I know that courts of equity can sometimes relieve parties from their contracts if it's unfair or against conscience, but I'm trying to remember the specific doctrines. There's the concept of "unjust enrichment," but that's not exactly this. There's also the idea that specific performance is an equitable remedy, so the court can exercise discretion. If enforcing the contract would be harsh, the court might refuse specific performance. So in this case, Beeson is arguing that it's harsh because the rezoning made the property much less valuable for his intended use. So the court might decide that enforcing the contract would be unfair and refuse specific performance. So G could be the reason.

Option H: Sloan would be unjustly enriched. If Sloan kept the deposit and the property, maybe, but if the contract is enforced, Sloan would get the full price. I'm not sure how this applies here. Unjust enrichment usually requires that one party is enriched at the expense of another without just cause. If Sloan keeps the property and gets the full price, but the property's value is lower, maybe that's not unjust enrichment. Not sure if this is the main point.

Option I: The city council's decision was unforeseeable. The rezoning was on November 24, which is after the contract was made. If the rezoning was something that couldn't have been anticipated, maybe that affects the risk allocation. But under equitable conversion, the risk is on the buyer regardless of foreseeability. So I think the foreseeability might affect whether the contract should be rescinded due to impossibility or frustration, but those aren't mentioned here. Alternatively, it might relate to impracticability, but again, the question is about specific performance and equitable conversion. So I'm not sure I is the right answer.

So, putting this together. The issue is whether the court will order specific performance. Sloan argues that under the doctrine of equitable conversion, Beeson bears the loss because he's treated as the owner. Beeson argues that it's harsh to enforce because the property's value is now much lower for his intended use.

In real estate contracts, the doctrine of equitable conversion generally places the risk of loss on the buyer once the contract is signed. So even if the property is destroyed or, in this case, rezoned, the buyer is still expected to perform. But courts can exercise their discretion in equity. If enforcing the contract would be harsh, they might refuse specific performance.

So the reason the judgment would be for Beeson is that the court finds it inequitable to force him to go through with the contract. Option G says, "Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain." That sounds like the court is using its equitable powers to prevent an unfair outcome.

Wait, but another thought: The doctrine of equitable conversion doesn't necessarily mean the buyer must perform if the circumstances have changed. Or does it? I think the doctrine mainly affects who bears the risk, but if the property becomes unsuitable for the intended purpose, the court could find that specific performance isn't appropriate because it's not fair.

So the court might decide that even though Beeson bears the risk, it's too harsh to make him pay the same price for a property that's now not suitable for a shopping mall. Therefore, the judgment would be for Beeson because enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive, which is an equitable consideration.

Looking back at the options, option B says the property's value decreased, which is a fact, but the reason for judgment would be the harshness, not just the decrease in value. Option G is about equity relieving Beeson because of a bad bargain. So G seems to align with the reasoning that the court would use its equitable discretion to relieve Beeson.

Wait, but option B is about the value decreasing. If the value decreased, that makes the contract a bad deal for Beeson. So the court could say that forcing him to pay the same price would be inequitable, thus falling under option G.

So the correct answer would be G.

The question revolves around a real estate contract and the doctrine of equitable conversion. Beeson contracted to buy property from Sloan for $250,000, intending to build a commercial shopping mall. After the contract was signed but before closing, the property was rezoned for single-family residential use, rendering it unsuitable for Beeson's intended purpose. Sloan sued for specific performance, arguing that under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of loss shifted to Beeson. Beeson argued that enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive.

Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the buyer (Beeson) is generally treated as the owner of the property once the contract is signed, and thus bears the risk of any changes to the property, including rezoning. However, courts of equity have discretion to refuse specific performance if enforcing the contract would be unfair or inequitable. Here, the rezoning significantly reduced the property's value for Beeson's intended use, making the contract a "bad bargain" for him. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While legal title remained with Sloan, this does not directly explain why the judgment would favor Beeson. The doctrine of equitable conversion places the risk on the buyer regardless of legal title.
- **B**: The property's value decreasing due to rezoning is a fact, but the reason for judgment would be the harshness of enforcing the contract, not just the value decrease.
- **C**: There is no evidence in the question that Sloan failed to disclose rezoning risks, so this is irrelevant.
- **D**: Beeson not paying the full purchase price is irrelevant because specific performance would require him to pay the balance.
- **E**: The contract was legally binding, as the question does not suggest any issues with its formation.
- **F**: Under equitable conversion, the risk is on the buyer, not the seller, so this is incorrect.
- **G**: This aligns with the reasoning that the court may exercise its equitable discretion to relieve Beeson from a bad bargain due to the harshness of enforcing the contract.
- **H**: Sloan would not be unjustly enriched if the contract is enforced, as she would merely receive the agreed-upon price.
- **I**: The foreseeability of the rezoning is irrelevant to the doctrine of equitable conversion, which places the risk on the buyer regardless.

The most likely reason for judgment in favor of Beeson is that equity will relieve him from a bad bargain, as enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive given the circumstances.
