Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. Let me break it down step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J.

Statement 1 says: Maximizing the likelihood of logistic regression model yields multiple local optimums.

Hmm, I remember that logistic regression uses maximum likelihood estimation for parameter optimization. The likelihood function in logistic regression is convex, right? Wait, convex functions have a single minimum, so if it's convex, there should be only one global optimum. That means the likelihood function doesn't have multiple local optima. So, Statement 1 is false because logistic regression's likelihood maximization doesn't result in multiple local optima. It should converge to the same solution regardless of the starting point, given that the function is convex.

Statement 2 claims: No classifier can do better than a naive Bayes classifier if the distribution of the data is known.

Naive Bayes assumes independence between features, which is often not the case in real data. But if the distribution is known, including all the dependencies, can a classifier do better? Wait, the statement says "if the distribution is known." So, if we know the true distribution, then theoretically, the Bayes classifier (which is optimal) would be the best. But Naive Bayes makes assumptions about independence that might not hold even if the distribution is known. Oh wait, no, because if the distribution is known, you can model it correctly without making the naive assumptions. So, the Bayes classifier would have zero error (if it knows the true distributions and the decision boundary). But Naive Bayes is a specific type, relying on feature independence. So, if the true distribution doesn't factor into independent features, then Naive Bayes wouldn't be optimal. 

Wait, the statement says "no classifier can do better than naive Bayes if the distribution is known." That doesn't sound right. Because if the distribution is known, you can design a classifier that exactly matches the underlying probabilities, which would be the Bayes classifier, not necessarily Naive Bayes. So, the statement is false because knowing the true distribution allows for better classifiers than Naive Bayes if the data isn't independent.

Wait, no, let me think again. The statement says "no classifier can do better than naive Bayes" when the distribution is known. That's not correct because the optimal classifier (Bayes) can do better if the Naive assumptions are not met. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait wait, I'm a bit confused. If the distribution is known, then the Bayes classifier can be used, which is optimal. So Naive Bayes is only optimal when the features are independent. So if the true distribution has dependent features, then using a different classifier (like a Bayes classifier that models the dependencies) would perform better than Naive Bayes. So Statement 2 is incorrect because it's possible for another classifier (the Bayes classifier) to perform better when the distribution is known.

So, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is false. Wait, but let me check again. Statement 1: logistic regression's MLE has multiple local optima? I thought logistic regression is convex, so MLE should have a single global optimum. So Statement 1 is false.

So both statements are false. Looking at the options, option F is False, False. But wait, let me look at the options again.

Options:
A: True, True
B: Both statements are not known
C: Both Statements are partially true
D: Statement 1 is not known and Statement 2 is True
E: Statement 1 is not known and Statement 2 is False
F: False, False
G: Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is not known
H: True, False
I: False, True
J: Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is not known

So if both are false, option F is the choice. But wait, I had thought Statement 2 is false, but maybe I missed something.

Wait, in Statement 2, if the distribution is known, then the Bayes classifier is optimal. But Naive Bayes isn't the Bayes classifier unless the features are independent. So the statement says that no classifier can do better than Naive Bayes when the distribution is known. That's not true because the actual Bayes classifier (without the Naive assumption) would be better if the features are dependent.

So yes, Statement 2 is false. So both statements are false, so F (False, False) is correct.

Statement 1: Maximizing the likelihood of logistic regression model yields multiple local optimums.

Logistic regression uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for parameter optimization. The likelihood function in logistic regression is convex, meaning it has a single global optimum. Therefore, the statement that maximizing the likelihood yields multiple local optima is **False**.

Statement 2: No classifier can do better than a naive Bayes classifier if the distribution of the data is known.

If the true distribution of the data is known, the optimal classifier is the Bayes classifier, which can achieve zero error. Naive Bayes, however, assumes independence between features, which may not hold for real-world data. If the true distribution involves dependent features, a classifier that models these dependencies (e.g., the Bayes classifier) can perform better than Naive Bayes. Thus, the claim that no classifier can outperform Naive Bayes when the distribution is known is **False**.

Both statements are false. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: False, False

Answer: F
