Question:

A defendant was arrested at an airport when the small suitcase he was carrying was found to contain heroin. The defendant, who did not challenge the legality of the airport search, was subsequently prosecuted for possession of heroin. At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf and said that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was accompanying the defendant when he was arrested. The girlfriend died in a skydiving accident two weeks before the defendant's trial. Moreover, the defendant testified that although he was a former heroin addict, he had not used any heroin in the past three years. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant to roll up the sleeves of his shirt and exhibit his arms to see if there were any needle marks. This request is

Options:

A: permissible, because the defendant's past addiction could provide context for the possession charge.
B: permissible, because the defendant's physical condition is a matter of public record.
C: objectionable, because it is an invasion of the defendant's personal privacy.
D: objectionable, because the defendant has a privilege against self-incrimination.
E: objectionable, because the defendant's past addiction is protected health information.
F: objectionable, because the defendant's past addiction is not relevant to the current charges.
G: permissible, because such evidence is relevant to the defendant's credibility.
H: permissible, because the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand.
I: objectionable, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
J: permissible, because the defendant's past addiction could imply a motivation for possession.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me start by breaking down the facts and the issue here.

The defendant was arrested at an airport with heroin in his suitcase. He didn't challenge the legality of the search, so that's probably not the issue here. He's being prosecuted for possession. At trial, he testified that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was with him when he was arrested. But she died two weeks before the trial, so she can't testify. He also said he's a former addict but hasn't used heroin in three years.

On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked him to roll up his sleeves to show his arms for needle marks. The question is whether this request is permissible or objectionable, and why.

First, I need to recall the rules of evidence, especially regarding cross-examination and the admissibility of evidence. So, when a defendant takes the stand, they become a witness and are subject to cross-examination. The prosecutor can ask questions that challenge the defendant's credibility, as well as questions relevant to the case.

The defendant testified about his past addiction, which he claims he's overcome. The prosecutor wants to show that he might still be using, which would make it more plausible that the heroin was his. So, the presence of needle marks could indicate recent drug use, which would challenge his testimony about not using for three years.

But wait, the defendant said he hadn't used in three years. So, if there are no needle marks, that might support his claim. But if there are marks, it could contradict him. However, I'm not sure if the presence of marks would necessarily prove recent use, as scars from past use could still be visible.

So, the issue is about the admissibility of this physical evidence. Is it permissible for the prosecutor to ask him to show his arms?

I remember that when a defendant takes the stand, they can be examined on any matter relevant to the case, including their credibility. But there are limits, like privacy and self-incrimination.

Also, there's the aspect of whether this evidence is relevant. The defendant's past addiction is relevant because it could show a motive for possession. But he's claiming he's been clean for three years. So, evidence that he's still using would undermine his credibility.

Wait, but the question is about the physical examination. I think there's a rule about the admissibility of a defendant's physical condition. The prosecutor might argue that the needle marks are relevant to show he's still an addict, thus making it more likely he possessed the heroin.

But I also recall that courts have held that requiring a defendant to display their body can be an invasion of privacy, but it's sometimes allowed if it's relevant and not unduly prejudicial.

Another angle is the self-incrimination privilege. The Fifth Amendment protects against being compelled to be a witness against oneself. But once the defendant takes the stand, they can be cross-examined, including about relevant matters. However, does being asked to display their body constitute compelled self-incrimination? Or is it more about the right to privacy?

I think in some cases, courts have allowed such physical evidence, especially when it's relevant and not overly intrusive. For example, in People v. Taylor, I think the court allowed the defendant to be required to try on a hat because it was relevant to identification and not too burdensome.

So, in this case, the prosecutor is asking about needle marks to challenge the defendant's credibility regarding his sobriety. The defendant's credibility is a key issue because he's testifying that he didn't possess the heroin, and his past addiction is relevant to that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Permissible because past addiction provides context. That makes sense because his addiction history is relevant to the charge of possession.

Option G: Permissible because it's relevant to credibility. His credibility is at issue, so physical evidence showing drug use could affect his credibility.

Option I: Objectionable because the probative value is outweighed by prejudice. But I'm not sure if the prejudice here is that high. It's directly relevant.

Option H: Permissible because he waived self-incrimination by testifying. But I think the Fifth Amendment issue isn't the main point here; it's more about the method of cross-examination.

Option D: Objectionable because of self-incrimination. But he's already testifying, so I think that's waived for relevant cross.

Option C: Invasion of privacy. But courts often allow such requests if relevant.

So, the key issue is relevance and whether it's an appropriate method. The evidence about his arms is relevant to show he's still using, which would make his possession more likely and his testimony less credible.

So, the prosecutor's request is permissible because it's relevant to credibility and the charges. Therefore, the answer would be either A or G.

But wait, the question is about whether the request is permissible or objectionable. The options are about why.

Option G says it's permissible because it's relevant to credibility. That makes sense because the defendant's credibility is in question, and evidence of recent drug use would bear on that.

Option A says it's permissible because the past addiction provides context. But the request is about current use, not past. So maybe G is better.

Alternatively, Option J says it's permissible because past addiction implies motivation. But again, the request is about current use.

So, I think G is the correct answer. The display is permissible as it relates to credibility.

The question revolves around whether the prosecutor's request for the defendant to display his arms to check for needle marks is permissible or objectionable. The defendant testified that he had not used heroin in three years, and the prosecutor seeks to challenge his credibility by showing potential recent drug use. 

Under evidence law, when a defendant takes the stand, they are subject to cross-examination on matters relevant to the case, including credibility. The presence of needle marks could indicate recent drug use, undermining the defendant's testimony about his sobriety and bearing on his credibility. Courts generally allow such physical evidence if it is relevant and not unduly prejudicial or intrusive.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests the request is permissible because the defendant's past addiction provides context. While the past addiction is relevant, the request specifically targets current use, making this less precise.
- **Option G** argues the request is permissible because it is relevant to credibility. This aligns with the prosecutor's aim to challenge the defendant's testimony about his sobriety, making it the strongest choice.
- **Option I** claims the request is objectionable due to prejudice, but the evidence appears directly relevant, and the prejudice does not outweigh its probative value.
- Other options either misaddress the legal issue (e.g., self-incrimination or privacy) or focus on less relevant aspects (e.g., motivation or health information).

Thus, the request is permissible because it is relevant to the defendant's credibility.
