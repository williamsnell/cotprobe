Okay, so I've got this problem about heat transfer over a flat plate, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that air at one atmosphere and 90°F is moving at 140 ft/sec across a flat plate that's 3 ft long. The surface temperature of the plate is 450°F. We need to determine the heat loss from the entire plate and also break it down into the laminar and turbulent sections of the boundary layer. Then, we have to calculate the heat loss assuming the boundary layer is completely turbulent. Finally, choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when a fluid flows over a plate, the boundary layer starts laminar and then becomes turbulent after a certain point, called the critical length. The critical Reynolds number is typically around 5e5, I think. So the flow will be laminar up to that Reynolds number and turbulent beyond.

First, I need to find where the flow transitions from laminar to turbulent. To find the critical length, I'll calculate the Reynolds number at different points along the plate until it reaches the critical value.

Wait, what's the formula for Reynolds number? Oh right, Re = (u * x) / ν, where u is the velocity, x is the length from the leading edge, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of air at the film temperature.

Wait, film temperature is the average of the surface and the ambient temperature. The air is at 90°F, and the plate surface is 450°F. So the film temperature T_film is (90 + 450)/2 = 270°F. But wait, I need to convert that to absolute temperature for viscosity calculations. Since it's in Fahrenheit, I'll convert to Rankine. T_film = 270 + 459.67 = 729.67 R.

Now, I need the kinematic viscosity of air at this temperature. I don't remember the exact value, but I think it's around 1.7e-4 ft²/s at 70°F, and it increases with temperature. At higher temps, maybe around 2.1e-4 or so? Wait, perhaps I should look up or calculate it, but since I can't, I'll have to proceed with approximate values. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use standard values.

Alternatively, I remember that for air at 100°F, ν is about 0.0000177 ft²/s. Wait, no, wait, maybe it's 0.0000177 m²/s? No, units are in ft. Let me think. Oh wait, 1 ft²/s is a big unit. Wait, actually, I think at 70°F (21°C), ν for air is approximately 0.0000164 ft²/s. So at 270°F, which is higher, the viscosity increases. Wait, no, wait, kinematic viscosity increases with temperature, but not sure by how much. Maybe I should use 0.000020 ft²/s as an approximation. Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects me to use a specific value. Alternatively, maybe the exact value isn't critical because the question is more about the method.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the properties at the film temperature without getting into exact values, or maybe the given options are such that the exact value doesn't matter much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives a chart or table for kinematic viscosity, but since I don't have that, I'll proceed with an approximate value.

Let me proceed with ν ≈ 0.00002 ft²/s at T_film. Now, the critical Reynolds number is 5e5. So the critical length x_c is where Re = 5e5 = (u * x_c)/ν.

So solving for x_c: x_c = (Re * ν) / u.

Plugging in the numbers: Re=5e5, ν=0.00002 ft²/s, u=140 ft/s.

x_c = (5e5 * 0.00002) / 140.

Let me compute that: 5e5 is 500,000. 500,000 * 0.00002 = 10. Then, 10 /140 ≈ 0.0714 ft. So about 0.0714 feet, or roughly 0.857 inches. Wait, that seems really short, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the calculation. 5e5 * 0.00002 = 10. 10 divided by 140 is approximately 0.0714 ft, yes. So the critical length is about 0.0714 ft. Since the plate is 3 ft long, the laminar flow is only up to 0.0714 ft, and the rest is turbulent.

Wait, but wait a second, that seems very short. So the majority of the plate (3 ft) is in turbulent flow. That makes sense because the velocity is 140 ft/s, which is pretty high, so the Reynolds number would quickly exceed the critical value.

Now, for each section, we can calculate the heat transfer coefficient and then the heat loss.

But wait, the total heat loss from the plate is the sum of the heat loss from the laminar part and the turbulent part. Alternatively, for each section, we can calculate the average Nusselt number, then the heat transfer coefficient, and then the heat flux, and so on.

The Nusselt number for laminar flow over a plate is given by Nu_lam = 0.664 * Re^(1/2) * Pr^(1/3), and for turbulent flow, it's Nu_turb = 0.037 * Re^(0.8) * Pr^(1/3).

Wait, but wait, I think for the turbulent part beyond x_c, the calculation is a bit more involved. Because the total Nusselt number up to a point x would be the average over the laminar and turbulent regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the heat transfer for the laminar region up to x_c and then the turbulent region from x_c to L (3 ft). Then sum them.

So, the overall heat loss Q is Q_lam + Q_turb.

But first, I need to compute the Prandtl number. Since we're dealing with air, Pr is around 0.7, but it depends on temperature. At higher temperatures, maybe it's lower, but again, for this problem, let's take Pr ≈ 0.7.

Wait, let me think again. The film temperature is 270°F, which is 810 R when converted to absolute (since 270 + 459.67 = 729.67 R? Wait, 270°F is 810 R? Wait, no, because 32°F is 0°C, which is 273.15 K, so 1°F is 5/9 K. So 270°F is (270-32)*5/9 + 273.15 ≈ (238)*0.5556 + 273.15 ≈ 132.2 + 273.15 ≈ 405.35 K. Wait, but in Rankine, it's 270°F + 459.67 = 729.67 R. Right, because Rankine is absolute like Kelvin, so 1 R = 1°F above absolute zero, which is -459.67°F. So yes, T_film is 729.67 R.

Now, for air at this temperature, the Prandtl number is approximately 0.68 to 0.7. Let's take Pr = 0.7.

So, for the laminar region (x ≤ x_c):

Re_lam = u * x_c / ν = 5e5.

Nu_lam = 0.664 * (5e5)^(1/2) * (0.7)^(1/3).

Let me compute that. The square root of 5e5 is sqrt(5e5) = sqrt(500,000) ≈ 707.1.

So 0.664 * 707.1 ≈ 0.664 * 700 ≈ 464.8, but more accurately, 0.664 * 707.1 ≈ 469.5.

Then multiply by (0.7)^(1/3). Cube root of 0.7 is approximately 0.887.

So 469.5 * 0.887 ≈ 416.8. So Nu_lam ≈ 416.8.

Now, the heat transfer coefficient h_lam is Nu * k / x, where k is the thermal conductivity of air at T_film.

What's the thermal conductivity of air at 270°F (405 K)? I think at 400 K, it's around 0.025 W/m·K, but let me convert that to BTU units because the options are in Btu/hr.

Wait, 1 W/m·K = 0.5778 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So 0.025 W/m·K is 0.025 * 0.5778 ≈ 0.01445 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Hmm, but that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can find the value of k in BTU units.

Wait, another approach: At 100°F, k for air is about 0.0145 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F). At higher temperatures, say 400°F, it's around 0.020 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Since our film temp is 270°F, maybe k is about 0.018 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F). But perhaps I should be more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use k ≈ 0.015 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F) at 270°F. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the value from the chart: at 300°F, k is about 0.0164 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F), so maybe 0.017 at 270°F.

Wait, maybe I can proceed with k = 0.017 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me proceed with the formula.

h_lam = (Nu_lam * k) / x_c.

Wait, x_c is in feet, so I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let's see: Nu is dimensionless, k is in BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F), and x is in feet. So:

h_lam = (416.8 * 0.017 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F)) ) / (0.0714 ft).

Wait, no, because x_c is in feet, but the units for k are in inches. So I need to convert x_c from feet to inches to match the units.

x_c = 0.0714 ft = 0.0714 * 12 inches ≈ 0.8568 inches.

So h_lam = (416.8 * 0.017) / 0.8568.

Calculating numerator: 416.8 * 0.017 ≈ 7.0856.

7.0856 / 0.8568 ≈ 8.27 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, because the units of h are BTU/(hr·ft²·°F), right? Because k is BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F), and dividing by x in inches, so the inches cancel, leaving ft in the denominator.

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula is h = Nu * k / x, where x is in the same units as in k. Since k is in inches, x should be in inches.

So h_lam = (Nu_lam * k) / x_c_in_inches.

So h_lam = (416.8 * 0.017) / 0.8568 ≈ (7.0856) / 0.8568 ≈ 8.27 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, the temperature difference ΔT is 450°F - 90°F = 360°F.

The heat flux q is h * ΔT.

So q_lam = 8.27 * 360 ≈ 2977.2 BTU/(hr·ft²).

The area for the laminar section is the length x_c times the width (1 ft). So A_lam = 0.0714 ft * 1 ft = 0.0714 ft².

So Q_lam = q_lam * A_lam = 2977.2 * 0.0714 ≈ 212.8 BTU/hr.

Hmm, that seems a bit low, but let's proceed.

Now, for the turbulent region from x_c to L (3 ft), the approach is a bit different. The Reynolds number at the end of the plate is Re_L = (u * L)/ν = (140 ft/s * 3 ft) / 0.00002 ft²/s.

Wait, 140 *3 = 420. 420 / 0.00002 = 21,000,000. So Re_L = 21e6, which is well into the turbulent regime.

The Nusselt number for the turbulent section can be calculated using the turbulent formula, but since the flow transitions at x_c, we can compute the average Nusselt number for the entire turbulent section.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the Nusselt number for the entire plate if it were all turbulent and then subtract the laminar part, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, for the turbulent section beyond x_c, the Nusselt number is calculated from x_c to L.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to calculate the average Nusselt number for the entire turbulent section, which is from x_c to L. The formula for the average Nusselt number in turbulent flow is:

Nu_turb = 0.037 * Re_L^(0.8) * Pr^(1/3) - 0.037 * Re_c^(0.8) * Pr^(1/3),

But perhaps another approach is to compute the Nusselt number at L, and then account for the fact that the flow is turbulent from x_c onwards. Alternatively, the average Nusselt number for the entire plate up to L would be:

Nu_avg = (1/L) * [ ∫ (Nu_lam dx from 0 to x_c) + ∫ (Nu_turb dx from x_c to L) ) ]

But integrating might be complicated. Alternatively, I remember that when the flow is partly laminar and partly turbulent, the total heat transfer can be found by adding the contributions from both regions.

So, for the turbulent region beyond x_c, we can compute the Nusselt number as:

Nu_turb_segment = 0.037 * (Re_L^(0.8) - Re_c^(0.8)) ) * Pr^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps that's the way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the average Nusselt number for the turbulent section from x_c to L can be calculated by:

Nu_turb_avg = 0.037 * (Re_L^0.8 - Re_c^0.8) / (L - x_c) ) * Pr^(1/3)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the Nusselt number at x = L and then apply the formula, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the heat transfer for the entire plate as if it were all turbulent, and then subtract the laminar part. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The total Nusselt number up to a point x in turbulent flow is given by:

Nu = 0.037 Re_x^0.8 Pr^(1/3) - 0.037 Re_c^0.8 Pr^(1/3) * (x_c/x)

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the average Nusselt number for the entire plate, considering both laminar and turbulent regions, is given by:

Nu_avg = [ (0.664 Re_c^0.5) + (0.037 (Re_L^0.8 - Re_c^0.8)) ] * Pr^(1/3)

Wait, maybe that's the approach. Because the laminar part contributes up to Re_c, and the turbulent part contributes from Re_c to Re_L.

So Nu_avg = [0.664 Re_c^0.5 + 0.037 (Re_L^0.8 - Re_c^0.8)] * Pr^(1/3)

Let me plug in the numbers.

Re_c =5e5, Re_L=21e6.

Compute each term:

0.664 * (5e5)^0.5 = 0.664 * 707.1 ≈ 469.5.

0.037*( (21e6)^0.8 - (5e5)^0.8 )

Calculate (21e6)^0.8: 21e6 is 2.1e7. Let me compute 2.1e7^0.8.

Wait, 1e7^0.8 = (1e7)^(4/5) = 1e^(7*(4/5))=1e^(5.6)= approx 3.98e5.

But 2.1e7 is 2.1 times that, so approximately 2.1*3.98e5 ≈ 8.358e5.

Similarly, (5e5)^0.8: 5e5 is 5e5, so 5^0.8 is about 3.311, and (1e5)^0.8 is 1e4 (since (1e5)^(0.8)=1e4). So 3.311e4.

So 0.037 * (8.358e5 - 3.311e4) = 0.037 * (8.358e5 - 0.3311e5) = 0.037*(8.0269e5) ≈ 0.037 * 802,690 ≈ 29,700.

So Nu_avg = (469.5 + 29,700) * (0.7)^(1/3).

469.5 + 29,700 ≈ 30,169.5.

Multiply by (0.7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.887.

30,169.5 * 0.887 ≈ 26,787.

So Nu_avg ≈ 26,787.

Now, the heat transfer coefficient h_avg = Nu_avg * k / L.

Wait, L is 3 ft. But wait, k is in what units? Earlier, I used k ≈ 0.017 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F), and L is in feet, so we need to convert L to inches.

L = 3 ft = 36 inches.

So h_avg = (26,787 * 0.017) / 36.

Compute
