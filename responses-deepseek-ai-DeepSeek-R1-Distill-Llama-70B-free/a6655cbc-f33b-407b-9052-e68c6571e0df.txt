Okay, so I've got this economics question here about aggregate demand curves. Hmm, I remember that aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an economy. The question is asking what would cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. Shifting left means a decrease in aggregate demand, right?

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: An increase in government spending. Wait, government spending is part of aggregate demand. If the government spends more, that should increase demand, shifting the curve to the right. So A probably isn't the answer.

Option B: An increase in income taxes. Taxes take money out of people's pockets. If income taxes go up, people have less disposable income, so they'll spend less. That should decrease aggregate demand, shifting the curve left. B looks like a possible correct answer.

Option C: A decrease in income taxes. Lower taxes mean more disposable income for consumers, which would increase spending. So this shifts the curve right, not left. So C isn't the answer.

Option D: Expectations of surpluses of goods in the future. If people expect there to be more goods available later, maybe they'll buy less now? Or wait, I'm a bit confused. If they expect surpluses, perhaps prices might fall. So consumers might delay purchases, thinking things will be cheaper later. That would decrease current demand, so D could shift the curve left. 

Option E: A decrease in government regulations. Less regulation might encourage businesses to produce more, which increases investment. More investment would shift aggregate demand right. So E isn't the answer.

Option F: An increase in consumer confidence. When people feel more confident, they're more likely to spend. That would increase demand, shifting the curve right. So F isn't it.

Option G: Expectations of a decrease in prices in the future. If people think prices will drop, they might wait to buy things, reducing current demand. That would shift the curve left. So G is another possible correct answer.

Option H: An increase in foreign exchange rates. A higher exchange rate makes our exports more expensive for other countries, so exports decrease. Less exports mean lower aggregate demand. So H could be a correct answer.

Option I: An increase in foreign income. If foreigners have more income, they might buy more of our exports. That would increase our aggregate demand, shifting the curve right. So I isn't the answer.

Option J: A decrease in interest rates. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, so investment and consumption increase. That would shift the curve right, so J isn't the answer.

So the possible correct options are B, D, G, H. Wait, the question is which of the following will cause a left shift. So let me think again.

Option B: Increase in income taxes definitely reduces disposable income, so that's a left shift. So B is correct. 

Option D: Expecting surpluses might lead to lower spending now, so D also causes a left shift. 

Option G: Expecting lower prices in the future would make people buy less now, so G is correct.

Option H: Higher exchange rates lower exports, so H is correct.

Wait, but the answer options are A to J, and the question is multiple-choice, so only one correct answer. Hmm. Let me read the question again. The options are multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are labeled A through J, but the question says 'which of the following', implying there's only one correct answer. So I need to pick the best option.

Looking back, the question is about which option will cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left.

Option B: An increase in income taxes. That reduces disposable income, leading to lower consumption. So aggregate demand decreases, so the curve shifts left. So B is correct.

Option D: Expectations of surpluses. If people expect more goods in the future, maybe they think prices will be lower, so they might buy less now. That would decrease AD now, so D is correct.

Option G: Expecting lower prices later. Same as D; people may delay purchases, so G shifts AD left.

Option H: Higher exchange rates (like, the currency appreciates). Makes exports more expensive, so exports fall. That reduces AD, so H is correct.

So which of these options are among the choices in the question? The question gives options from A to J, and the possible correct answers are B, D, G, H.

Wait, but the original question is a multiple-choice question, so the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, the question asks, which of the following will cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. So all options that decrease aggregate demand are correct.

But the options given are A to J, each a separate choice. So perhaps multiple are correct, but the question is which option is correct, so only one is the correct answer.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Increase in govt spending → Right shift.

B: Increase in income taxes → Left shift.

C: Decrease in income taxes → Right shift.

D: Expect surpluses → Left shift.

E: Decrease in govt regulations → Right.

F: Increase in confidence → Right.

G: Expect lower prices → Left.

H: Increase in foreign exchange rates → Left.

I: Increase in foreign income → Right.

J: Decrease in interest rates → Right.

So the options that cause left shifts are B, D, G, H.

But the question is, which of the following will cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left?

So the correct answer is any of B, D, G, H. But since the options A-J are each a separate choice, the question expects the user to pick all that apply, but the way the question is phrased, it's a single choice. So perhaps only one is listed as an option.

Wait, the question provides the options as A to J, each a separate option. So perhaps the correct answer is B, D, G, or H.

Looking at the answer options given in the problem, the options are A to J, but the way the question is phrased, it's a single correct answer. Maybe the question expects me to choose all that apply, but since it's a multiple-choice with single selection, perhaps it's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option B: Increase in income taxes. Yes, that definitely reduces AD.

Option D: Expectations of surpluses. If people expect more goods, they might buy less now, thinking prices will drop. So AD shifts left.

Option G: Expecting lower prices. Same reasoning as D. So AD shifts left.

Option H: Higher exchange rates. Makes exports more expensive, reducing exports, thus AD shifts left.

So all of B, D, G, H are correct, but in the context of the question, perhaps only one is listed as an option. Wait, the question gives the options as A to J, so all are possible. But the question is, which of the following (so each of them is a possible answer, but only one is correct in this context).

Wait, the question is a single-answer multiple-choice, so the correct answer is one of the options. Let me think: which of these is a correct cause.

Wait, the question is from a typical exam, perhaps. So, for example, option B is a standard correct answer because taxes affect disposable income.

So the correct answer is B. But wait, let me make sure.

Option H is an increase in foreign exchange rates. Wait, the exchange rate is the price of foreign currency. If exchange rates increase, it could mean that the domestic currency has appreciated. So, for example, if the USD appreciates, it makes US exports more expensive for foreigners, so exports fall. That reduces AD, so H is correct.

So the correct answer could be B, H, D, or G.

But the question is, which one is the correct option. So perhaps the correct answer is B or H.

Wait, the options are each separate, so the correct answer is all that apply, but since it's a single-select question, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the most direct cause.

For example, option B: increase in income taxes reduces household income, leading to lower consumption. That's a direct cause.

Option H: increase in exchange rates reduces net exports, which is a part of AD but perhaps a smaller effect compared to taxes.

So the most correct answer is B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the components of aggregate demand.

Aggregate demand is composed of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports).

So, factors that affect each component:

- Consumption is affected by income, taxes, wealth, and confidence.
- Investment is affected by interest rates, expectations, and business confidence.
- Government spending is direct.
- Net exports are affected by exchange rates, foreign income, and foreign prices.

So, for each option:

Option B: Increase in income taxes → reduces disposable income → consumption decreases → AD shifts left.

Option D: Expectations of surpluses → if consumers expect more goods in the future, they might buy less now, decreasing consumption.

Option G: Expectations of lower prices → consumers might delay purchases, decreasing current demand.

Option H: Increase in foreign exchange rates → makes exports more expensive → net exports fall → AD decreases.

So all of these are correct.

But since the question is a single-choice, perhaps the intended answer is B, as it's a direct and common reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

The question is asking which will cause the AD curve to shift to the left.

So the correct answer will be an option that decreases AD.

Looking through the options, I have multiple correct ones. But the options are each separate, so I must choose the correct one.

Wait, the original question gives options A-J, each a separate choice. So perhaps the correct answer is B, H, etc.

But in the options, the correct answer is B, D, G, H. But since this is a single-choice question, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Hmm, but in the options given, the correct answers are B, D, G, H, but the question expects me to choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. So, I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with B as the answer.

To determine which option causes the aggregate demand (AD) curve to shift to the left, we analyze each option based on its impact on AD. A left shift of the AD curve indicates a decrease in aggregate demand.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A: An increase in government spending**  
  Government spending is a component of AD. An increase in government spending would increase AD, shifting the curve to the right. **Not correct.**

- **B: An increase in income taxes**  
  Higher income taxes reduce disposable income, leading to lower consumer spending and thus a decrease in AD. This shifts the AD curve to the left. **Correct.**

- **C: A decrease in income taxes**  
  Lower income taxes increase disposable income, boosting consumer spending and increasing AD. This shifts the AD curve to the right. **Not correct.**

- **D: Expectations of surpluses of goods in the future**  
  If consumers expect surpluses of goods in the future, they may delay purchases, reducing current demand and shifting the AD curve to the left. **Correct.**

- **E: A decrease in government regulations**  
  Reduced regulations can encourage business investment and production, increasing AD and shifting the curve to the right. **Not correct.**

- **F: An increase in consumer confidence**  
  Higher consumer confidence leads to increased spending, boosting AD and shifting the curve to the right. **Not correct.**

- **G: Expectations of a decrease in prices in the future**  
  If consumers expect prices to fall, they may delay purchases, reducing current demand and shifting the AD curve to the left. **Correct.**

- **H: An increase in foreign exchange rates**  
  A higher exchange rate makes exports more expensive for foreign buyers, reducing net exports and decreasing AD. This shifts the AD curve to the left. **Correct.**

- **I: An increase in foreign income**  
  Higher foreign income increases demand for domestic exports, boosting AD and shifting the curve to the right. **Not correct.**

- **J: A decrease in interest rates**  
  Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs, increasing investment and consumption, which increases AD and shifts the curve to the right. **Not correct.**

### Conclusion:
The options that cause the AD curve to shift to the left are **B, D, G, and H**. However, since this is a single-choice question, the most direct and common cause is **B: An increase in income taxes**, as it directly reduces disposable income and consumer spending.

**Answer: B**
