Okay, so I've got this initial value problem here. The equation is y' equals (t*y*(4 - y))/3, and the initial condition is y(0) = 0.5. I need to find the time T when y first reaches 3.98. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that solving differential equations often involves finding an integrating factor or using separation of variables. The equation given looks a bit like a logistic equation, but with a t term involved. Wait, the logistic equation is dy/dt = r y (1 - y/K), but here I have t multiplied in there. So this isn't a standard logistic equation because of the t factor. That complicates things a bit.

Let me write down the equation again to see it clearly: dy/dt = (t * y (4 - y))/3. Hmm, so it's a first-order ODE, but not linear because of the y(4-y) term. So maybe I can try to separate variables. Let's see if that's possible.

Separation of variables would involve getting all the y terms on one side and the t terms on the other. So I can rewrite this as dy / [y(4 - y)] = (t/3) dt. Oh wait, but wait, the right-hand side is (t/3) dt, and the left is integrating over y. So integrating both sides should give me a solution in terms of t and y.

Let me proceed to integrate both sides. The left integral is ∫ [1/(y(4 - y))] dy. Hmm, that looks like a candidate for partial fractions. Let's set up partial fractions for 1/(y(4 - y)).

So let me write 1/(y (4 - y)) as A/y + B/(4 - y). Solving for A and B:

1 = A(4 - y) + B y.

Setting y = 0: 1 = A*4 → A = 1/4.

Setting y =4: 1 = B*4 → B = 1/4.

So 1/(y(4 - y)) = (1/4)(1/y + 1/(4 - y)).

So the integral becomes (1/4) [∫ (1/y) dy + ∫ 1/(4 - y) dy ].

Which is (1/4) [ ln|y| - ln|4 - y| ] + C. Because ∫1/(4 - y) dy is -ln|4 - y|.

So the left integral is (1/4) ln | y/(4 - y) | + C. 

Now for the right integral: ∫ (t/3) dt. That's (1/3) * (t²/2) ) + C → (t²)/(6) + C.

So putting it all together, the equation after integration is:

(1/4) ln | y/(4 - y) | = (t²)/6 + C.

Now we can apply the initial condition y(0) = 0.5 to find C. Let's plug t=0, y=0.5 into the equation.

Left side: (1/4) ln (0.5/(4 - 0.5)) = (1/4) ln (0.5 / 3.5) = (1/4) ln (1/7) ≈ (1/4)(-ln7).

Right side: (0)^2 /6 + C = C.

So (1/4) ln(1/7) = C → C = (1/4)(-ln7) = - (ln7)/4.

So the equation becomes:

(1/4) ln(y/(4 - y)) = t²/6 - (ln7)/4.

Hmm, let me multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

ln(y/(4 - y)) = (4 t²)/(6) - ln7.

Simplify 4/6 to 2/3, so:

ln(y/(4 - y)) = (2 t²)/3 - ln7.

I can rewrite this as:

ln(y/(4 - y)) + ln7 = (2 t²)/3.

Using logarithm properties, ln(a) + ln(b) = ln(ab), so:

ln(7 * y/(4 - y)) ) = (2 t²)/3.

Exponentiating both sides to eliminate the natural log:

7 y/(4 - y) = e^{(2 t²)/3}.

So,

7y = (4 - y) e^{(2 t²)/3}.

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for y. Expanding the right side:

7y = 4 e^{(2 t²)/3} - y e^{(2 t²)/3}.

Bring all terms with y to one side:

7y + y e^{(2 t²)/3} = 4 e^{(2 t²)/3}.

Factor y:

y [7 + e^{(2 t²)/3}] = 4 e^{(2 t²)/3}.

So,

y = [4 e^{(2 t²)/3}] / [7 + e^{(2 t²)/3}].

Hmm, that's the expression for y in terms of t. Now, we need to find the time T when y(T) = 3.98.

So set y =3.98 and solve for t.

3.98 = [4 e^{(2 T²)/3}] / [7 + e^{(2 T²)/3}].

Let me call e^{(2 T²)/3} as u for simplicity.

So,

3.98 = (4 u) / (7 + u).

Multiply both sides by (7 + u):

3.98 (7 + u) =4 u.

Expanding:

3.98 *7 + 3.98 u =4 u.

Calculate 3.98 *7: 3*7=21, 0.98*7=6.86 → total 27.86.

So,

27.86 +3.98 u =4 u.

Bring terms together:

27.86 =4u -3.98 u → 27.86 =0.02 u.

So,

u= 27.86 /0.02 = 1393.

Wait, 27.86 divided by 0.02 is 1393? Let me compute that. 27.86 /0.02 is same as 27.86 *50 = 1393. Yes.

So u=1393.

But u is e^{(2 T²)/3}.

So,

e^{(2 T²)/3} =1393.

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

(2 T²)/3 = ln(1393).

Compute ln(1393). Let's think: e^7 is about 1096 (since e^7≈1096), so ln(1393) is a bit more than 7. Let me check exact value.

Wait, using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed.

So,

(2 T²)/3 = ln(1393).

Solve for T²:

T² = [3/(2)] * ln(1393).

Then T is sqrt(  (3/2) * ln(1393)  )

Compute ln(1393):

I know that ln(1000)=6.9078, ln(2000)=7.6009, since e^7≈1096, e^7.2 is about e^(7) * e^0.2≈1096 *1.2214≈1338. So e^7.2≈1338, which is less than 1393. So ln(1393) is a little above 7.2.

Compute e^7.2: as above, about 1338.

e^7.25: Let's compute 7.25 =7 +0.25.

e^7=1096.633.

e^0.25= approx 1.284025.

So e^7.25=1096.633 *1.284025 ≈ let's compute:

1096.633 *1 =1096.633,

1096.633 *.2= 219.3266,

1096.633 *.08= 87.73064,

So total approx 1096.633 + 219.3266=1315.9596 +87.73064≈1403.69024.

Wait, so e^7.25≈1403.69, which is higher than 1393. So ln(1393) is between 7.2 and 7.25.

Let me compute how much.

At 7.2, e^7.2≈1338.

At 7.25, e^7.25≈1403.69.

So 1393 is 1393-1338=55 units above 1338. The difference between 1403.69 and 1338 is about 65.69.

So 55/65.69 ≈0.837 of the interval. So x=7.2 +0.837*(0.05)=7.2 +0.0418=7.2418.

Wait, no, wait. The interval is from 7.2 to7.25, which is 0.05 in x. The e^x increases by 65.69 over this x change.

So the fraction is (1393-1338)/65.69=55/65.69≈0.837. So x=7.2 +0.837*(0.05)=7.2 +0.04185=7.24185.

So ln(1393)≈7.24185.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute more accurately, but for an approximate solution, let's take it as roughly 7.24.

So,

T² = (3/2) *7.24 → 3/2 is 1.5, 1.5 *7.24= 10.86.

So T²≈10.86 → T≈sqrt(10.86)≈3.296.

Wait, but wait, let me check that sqrt(10.86) is.

I know that 3^2=9, 3.3^2=10.89. Oh, wait, 3.3 squared is 10.89. So sqrt(10.86) is a little less than 3.3. Like 3.296 or something.

Hmm, but looking back at the options, let's look:

Options are:

A:3.01012

B:4.65218

C:5.12345

D:2.54678

E:3.87540

F:4.20456

G:3.29527

H:6.78901

I:2.75984

J:2.98732

So option G is 3.29527, which is very close to my approximation of 3.296.

Wait, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me retrace.

Wait, when I set u = e^{(2T²)/3} =1393.

So (2T²)/3 = ln(1393) ≈7.24185.

So T²=(3/2)*7.24185 → 3*7.24185=21.72555, divided by 2 is 10.862775.

So T= sqrt(10.862775)≈3.296.

Yes, that's correct. So the time T is approximately 3.296.

Looking at the options, G is 3.29527, which is 3.295, so very close. So the correct answer would be G.

To solve the initial value problem 

$$
y^{\prime} = \frac{t y (4 - y)}{3}, \quad y(0) = 0.5,
$$

we first separate variables:

$$
\frac{dy}{y(4 - y)} = \frac{t}{3} dt.
$$

Using partial fractions, we decompose the left-hand side:

$$
\frac{1}{y(4 - y)} = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{4 - y} \right).
$$

Integrating both sides, we get:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \ln \left| \frac{y}{4 - y} \right| = \frac{t^2}{6} + C.
$$

Applying the initial condition \( y(0) = 0.5 \), we find \( C = -\frac{\ln 7}{4} \). Substituting \( C \) back, the solution becomes:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \ln \left( \frac{y}{4 - y} \right) = \frac{t^2}{6} - \frac{\ln 7}{4}.
$$

Multiplying through by 4:

$$
\ln \left( \frac{y}{4 - y} \right) = \frac{2t^2}{3} - \ln 7.
$$

Exponentiating both sides:

$$
\frac{7y}{4 - y} = e^{\frac{2t^2}{3}}.
$$

Rearranging for \( y \):

$$
y = \frac{4 e^{\frac{2t^2}{3}}}{7 + e^{\frac{2t^2}{3}}}.
$$

To find the time \( T \) when \( y(T) = 3.98 \), we substitute \( y = 3.98 \):

$$
3.98 = \frac{4 e^{\frac{2T^2}{3}}}{7 + e^{\frac{2T^2}{3}}}.
$$

Let \( u = e^{\frac{2T^2}{3}} \). Then:

$$
3.98 = \frac{4u}{7 + u}.
$$

Solving for \( u \):

$$
3.98(7 + u) = 4u \implies 27.86 + 3.98u = 4u \implies u = \frac{27.86}{0.02} = 1393.
$$

Since \( u = e^{\frac{2T^2}{3}} \), we take the natural logarithm:

$$
\frac{2T^2}{3} = \ln(1393).
$$

Approximating \( \ln(1393) \), we find \( \ln(1393) \approx 7.24 \). Thus:

$$
T^2 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 7.24 = 10.86 \implies T = \sqrt{10.86} \approx 3.296.
$$

Comparing this result to the options, the closest value is \( 3.29527 \), which corresponds to option **G**.
