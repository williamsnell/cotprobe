Okay, so I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 10. Hmm, I remember that LCM is the smallest number that both numbers can divide into without leaving a remainder. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, I think there are a couple of methods to find the LCM. One way is to list the multiples of each number and find the smallest one they have in common. Another method might involve prime factors. Oh right, the prime factorization method! Yeah, that sounds efficient.

Let me try the prime factorization approach. So, for 4, the prime factors are 2 and 2, because 2 times 2 is 4. And for 10, it's 2 and 5. So, I write down the prime factors:

4 = 2²
10 = 2 × 5

To find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations. So for 2, the highest power is 2² from 4, and for 5, it's 5¹ from 10. Then I multiply these together.

So LCM = 2² × 5 = 4 × 5 = 20.

Let me double-check by listing the multiples to make sure. The multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28... and the multiples of 10 are 10, 20, 30, 40... Oh, the first common multiple they both have is 20. So that confirms it.

Alternatively, I could use the formula that relates LCM and GCD: LCM(a,b) = |a*b| / GCD(a,b). Let's see if that works. The GCD of 4 and 10 is 2 because that's the largest number that divides both. So, (4*10)/2 = 40/2 = 20. Yep, same result.

So the LCM of 4 and 10 is 20. Looking back at the options, option B is 20. So the answer should be B.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 10 is determined by identifying the smallest number that both 4 and 10 can divide into without a remainder. Using the prime factorization method:

- The prime factors of 4 are \( 2^2 \).
- The prime factors of 10 are \( 2 \times 5 \).

The LCM is found by taking the highest powers of all prime factors present:  
\[
\text{LCM} = 2^2 \times 5 = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

This result is confirmed by listing the multiples of 4 and 10, where 20 is the first common multiple. Additionally, using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \), with the GCD of 4 and 10 being 2, also yields:  
\[
\text{LCM} = \frac{4 \times 10}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Thus, the LCM of 4 and 10 is 20, corresponding to option B.
