Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the combustion of carbon monoxide. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The question is asking for the equilibrium mixture at 2504°C and 1 atm pressure. CO reacts with a stoichiometric amount of air, and the Kp is given as 49.365. The options are all y values, which I think represents the mole fraction of CO2 or something like that.

First, I should write out the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of CO. CO burns in air (which is mostly O2 and N2), but since it's stoichiometric, I think I can focus on the O2 part. The reaction is CO + ½ O2 → CO2. Wait, but since air is involved, maybe I should include N2 as well? Oh, but stoichiometric amount of air probably means the right proportion for complete combustion, so maybe the N2 is inert and doesn't participate. So the main reaction is CO reacting with O2.

Wait, what's the balanced equation? Let's see. CO has C and O. Combustion produces CO2, so each CO needs one O2 molecule but split because of the stoichiometry. So the balanced equation is 2CO + O2 → 2CO2. Yeah, that's right. So the reaction is 2CO + O2 ⇌ 2CO2, Kp is 49.365.

Wait, but the problem says Kp is given, so I should probably use partial pressures in the equilibrium expression. But wait, Kp is given as 49.365, which is a moderate number, so the reaction favors products.

The initial situation is that we have CO and air in stoichiometric amounts. So the initial moles would be in the ratio of the balanced equation. Let's think about it. Let's say we start with 2 moles of CO and 1 mole of O2. But wait, air is approximately 21% O2 and 79% N2, so maybe I need to account for that. Oh, but the problem says to assume that CO reacts with a stoichiometric amount of air. So the air provides the necessary O2 in the right proportion.

Wait, but when you have stoichiometric air, the amount of O2 is just enough for complete combustion. So let's model this. Let me define the initial moles. Suppose I have n moles of CO. Then, the stoichiometric amount of O2 required would be (n/2) moles, because from the reaction 2CO + O2 → 2CO2, each 2 moles of CO react with 1 mole of O2. But wait, in reality, air has a lot of N2. But the problem might be simplifying it by just considering O2 and N2 as inert, so perhaps we can ignore N2 in the reaction but include it in the total pressure.

Wait, but when calculating Kp, the partial pressures of N2 won't affect the equilibrium because they're inert. So maybe I can ignore N2 in the reaction but include it in the total pressure. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem neglects N2 because it's inert, so we can treat the system as just CO and O2 reacting, and the rest is inert. But the question states that CO reacts with a stoichiometric amount of air, so maybe I should account for the N2 in terms of pressure.

Wait, but when considering stoichiometric air, the mole ratio is important. Let me think. The stoichiometric amount of air for CO combustion would provide exactly the O2 needed. So for every mole of CO, you need half a mole of O2. But air has a certain amount of O2. So, let's say for 1 mole of CO, you need 0.5 moles of O2. Since air is about 21% O2 by volume, to get 0.5 moles of O2, you need (0.5 / 0.21) ≈ 2.38 moles of air. But wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying this and treating air as just O2 and N2 in a 1:3.76 ratio by mole, which is the typical approximation.

But maybe for this problem, the N2 is present but doesn't react, so the total pressure includes N2. So the initial moles would be CO, O2, and N2, but only CO and O2 react. So let's model this.

Let me define the initial moles. Let's say the initial amount of CO is 'a' moles. Then, the stoichiometric amount of O2 required is (a/2) moles. But since it's air, the O2 comes with N2. The ratio in air is O2:N2 = 1:3.76. So for every mole of O2, there are 3.76 moles of N2. So the amount of N2 would be 3.76*(a/2) = 1.88a moles.

So total initial moles are CO: a, O2: a/2, N2: 1.88a.

But wait, the reaction will proceed, and some CO and O2 will convert to CO2. Let's let the change be 'x' moles of CO reacting. Wait, but in the reaction, 2 moles of CO react with 1 mole O2 to form 2 moles CO2. So per mole of reaction, 2 CO consumed, 1 O2 consumed, 2 CO2 formed.

Wait, but I'm considering 'x' as the extent of reaction. So for each 'x', 2x moles of CO are consumed, x moles of O2 consumed, and 2x moles of CO2 produced.

Wait, but since the initial amounts are a moles CO, a/2 moles O2, and 1.88a N2.

But perhaps it's better to use variables. Let me let the initial moles be as follows:

CO: 2n (since the stoichiometric ratio is 2:1 for CO:O2, maybe better to take n as the extent)
O2: n
N2: 3.76n (since O2 is 1/4.76 of air, so for n moles O2, N2 is 3.76n)

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach. Let me define the initial moles as 2n CO, n O2, and 3.76n N2. Because for every n moles of O2, there's 3.76n N2. So 2n CO, n O2, 3.76n N2.

Now, let me let the change be -2x for CO, -x for O2, and +2x for CO2. So the moles at equilibrium would be:

CO: 2n - 2x
O2: n - x
CO2: 0 + 2x
N2: 3.76n (unchanged)

But wait, the problem says the initial amount is stoichiometric, which would mean that all the CO and O2 would react if equilibrium weren't an issue. But with Kp given, we can set up the expression.

But wait, the total pressure is 1 atm. So the sum of the partial pressures would be 1 atm. But since we're using Kp, which is in terms of partial pressures, we can proceed.

Wait, but let's think in terms of mole fractions. Because the total pressure is 1 atm, each partial pressure is the mole fraction multiplied by total pressure, which is 1 atm.

So the mole fractions would be:

CO: (2n - 2x) / total moles
O2: (n - x) / total moles
CO2: 2x / total moles
N2: 3.76n / total moles

Total moles = (2n - 2x) + (n - x) + 2x + 3.76n = 2n -2x +n -x +2x +3.76n = (2n +n +3.76n) + (-2x -x +2x) = 6.76n -x.

Wait, simplifying:

Total moles = 2n (CO) + n (O2) + 3.76n (N2) initially. When reaction occurs, for each x (extent), CO decreases by 2x, O2 by x, CO2 increases by 2x. So total moles after reaction:

CO: 2n - 2x
O2: n - x
CO2: 2x
N2: 3.76n

Adding them up: (2n -2x) + (n -x) + 2x +3.76n = 2n +n +3.76n + (-2x -x +2x) ) = 6.76n -x.

Wait, because 2n +n =3n, 3n +3.76n =6.76n. Then the x terms: -2x -x +2x = -x. So total moles =6.76n -x.

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should express everything in terms of mole fractions, using the variable y as the mole fraction of CO2. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to let the initial moles be 2 moles CO and 1 mole O2, with 3.76 moles N2. Then the total initial moles are 2 +1 +3.76 =6.76 moles.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assume that we have a certain initial amount, say, 2 moles of CO, 1 mole O2, and 3.76 moles N2, for a total of 6.76 moles. Then, as the reaction proceeds, x moles of CO react (so 2x CO consumed, x O2 consumed, 2x CO2 produced). Wait, no, because the reaction is 2CO + O2 → 2CO2, so for every 2 moles CO consumed, 1 mole O2 consumed, and 2 moles CO2 produced. So the change would be: CO: -2x, O2: -x, CO2: +2x.

So the moles at equilibrium would be:

CO: 2 - 2x
O2: 1 -x
CO2: 0 +2x
N2: 3.76

Total moles = (2-2x) + (1 -x) + 2x +3.76 = 2 +1 +3.76 + (-2x -x +2x) = 6.76 -x.

Now, the partial pressures are each mole fraction times total pressure, which is 1 atm.

So the partial pressures:

PCO = (2-2x)/(6.76 -x) *1 atm
PO2 = (1 -x)/(6.76 -x) *1 atm
PCO2 = (2x)/(6.76 -x) *1 atm
PN2 = 3.76/(6.76 -x) *1 atm

Now, the equilibrium expression Kp is given by (PCO2)^2 / (PCO)^2 * PO2).

So Kp = [ (2x/(6.76 -x))^2 ] / [ ( (2-2x)/(6.76 -x) )^2 * ( (1 -x)/(6.76 -x) ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (4x²)/(6.76 -x)^2

Denominator: [ ( (2-2x)^2 ) / (6.76 -x)^2 ) * ( (1 -x)/(6.76 -x) ) ]

Wait, let me compute denominator step by step.

Denominator = (PCO)^2 * PO2 = [ ( (2-2x)/(6.76 -x) )^2 ] * [ (1 -x)/(6.76 -x) ) ]

So that's ( (2-2x)^2 (1 -x) ) / (6.76 -x)^3 )

So Kp = (4x²/(6.76 -x)^2 ) / [ ( (2-2x)^2 (1 -x) ) / (6.76 -x)^3 ) ]

Which is (4x²) * (6.76 -x)^3 ) / [ (2-2x)^2 (1 -x) (6.76 -x)^2 ) ]

Simplify: (4x²) (6.76 -x) ) / [ (2-2x)^2 (1 -x) ) ]

Because (6.76 -x)^3 divided by (6.76 -x)^2 leaves (6.76 -x) in numerator.

So Kp = [4x² (6.76 -x) ] / [ (2-2x)^2 (1 -x) ) ]

Hmm, this seems a bit complex. Let's factor 2 from (2-2x): 2(1 -x). So (2-2x)^2 = 4(1 -x)^2.

Substituting back:

Kp = [4x² (6.76 -x) ] / [4(1 -x)^2 (1 -x) ) ]

Simplify denominator: 4(1 -x)^3.

So Kp = [4x² (6.76 -x) ] / [4 (1 -x)^3 ]

Cancel 4s: x² (6.76 -x) / (1 -x)^3.

So Kp = [x² (6.76 -x) ] / (1 -x)^3.

But wait, Kp is given as 49.365. So:

x² (6.76 -x) / (1 -x)^3 =49.365.

This is a nonlinear equation in x. Solving this would give the value of x, which can then be used to find mole fractions.

Let me note that solving this equation might be tricky. Perhaps we can make an assumption to simplify. Since Kp is around 49, which is somewhat large, the reaction is product-favored. So perhaps x is close to 1, meaning that most of the CO is converted to CO2.

Wait, but if x is close to 1, let's test x=1. Let's see what happens when x approaches 1.

If x=1, denominator (1-x)=0, which would make Kp approach infinity. But our Kp is 49.365, so x must be less than 1. Maybe x is around 0.95 or something. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that (6.76 -x) ≈6.76, but that might not hold if x is a significant fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate by letting x be close to 1, but let me try to make an approximate calculation.

But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is better. Let's let y be the mole fraction of CO2. Since CO2 is a product, maybe we can express everything in terms of y.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the initial moles as 2 moles CO, 1 mole O2, and 3.76 moles N2, for a total of 6.76 moles. Then, the mole fraction of CO2 at equilibrium is y = 2x / (6.76 -x).

Wait, but it's getting a bit messy. Maybe I should make an assumption that x is small compared to 6.76, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can let x be a variable and solve numerically.

Wait, but considering that Kp is 49.365, which is a moderately large value, the reaction will proceed significantly towards the products. So x might be close to 1, but let's see.

Let me try plugging x=0.8 into the equation.

Compute numerator: (0.8)^2 * (6.76 -0.8) = 0.64 * 5.96 ≈ 3.8144.

Denominator: (1 -0.8)^3 = (0.2)^3 = 0.008.

So Kp ≈3.8144 / 0.008 ≈476.8, which is higher than 49.365. So x is less than 0.8.

Try x=0.6:

Numerator: 0.36 * (6.76 -0.6)=0.36 *6.16≈2.2176.

Denominator: (0.4)^3=0.064.

Kp=2.2176/0.064≈34.64. Less than 49. So x is between 0.6 and 0.8.

Next, try x=0.7.

Numerator: 0.49 * (6.76 -0.7)=0.49 *6.06≈2.9694.

Denominator: (0.3)^3=0.027.

Kp=2.9694 / 0.027≈110, which is way higher than 49. So wait, this can't be right. I think I must have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, when x=0.7, the denominator is (1 -x)=0.3, so (0.3)^3=0.027.

Numerator: x² (6.76 -x) = (0.7)^2*(6.76-0.7)=0.49 *6.06≈2.9694.

So 2.9694 / 0.027 ≈110.

Wait, but earlier at x=0.6, it's 34.6. Hmm, so the Kp increases as x increases from 0.6 to 0.7, which suggests that the function isn't linear. Maybe I need to try x=0.65.

At x=0.65:

Numerator: 0.65^2*(6.76-0.65)=0.4225 *6.11≈2.582.

Denominator: (0.35)^3≈0.042875.

So Kp≈2.582 /0.042875≈60.2. Still higher than 49.

Wait, but it's lower than at x=0.7. Hmm, but wait, when x=0.6, it's 34.6, and at x=0.65, 60.2, which is higher. Wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. Maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recheck x=0.6.

x=0.6:

Numerator: 0.6^2=0.36; 6.76 -0.6=6.16 →0.36
