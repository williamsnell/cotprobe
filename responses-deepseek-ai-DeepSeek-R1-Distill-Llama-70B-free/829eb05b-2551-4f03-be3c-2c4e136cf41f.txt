Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about the domestication of cattle. Let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is asking where and when cattle were first domesticated.

From what I remember, the domestication of animals is a key part of human history, especially during the Neolithic period. I think that's when people started moving from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one that's more agricultural and settled. 

Cattle would have been an important animal for early farmers because they provide meat, milk, and labor. But where exactly did this happen? I recall that the Fertile Crescent is often mentioned in this context. The Fertile Crescent includes regions like the Middle East, parts of modern-day Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and parts of Turkey and Egypt. That area is known for the domestication of several key plants and animals.

Now, about the timing. I think domestication started around 10,000 years ago. Wait, but sometimes dates can vary based on sources. Some say it's more like 10,500 years ago. I remember reading that the domestication of cattle happened in the Near East, which is the Middle East, approximately 10,500 years ago. That would place it in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period, I think.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A says sub-Saharan Africa about 10,500 years ago. That doesn't seem right because I thought the Middle East was the place. Option B is western Europe, 3,500 years ago. That's way too recent because domestication started before that. Option C is the Middle East, 10,500 years ago. That matches what I was thinking. Option D is North America, 5,500 years ago. But I don't think cattle were native to the Americas until much later, like with European colonization. Option E is East Asia, 5,500 years ago. Maybe some animals were domesticated there, but not cattle first. Option F is South America, 6,500 years ago. Again, not the first place. Option G is Middle East, 6,500 years ago. Hmm, that's a bit later than I thought. Option H is North America, about 9,500 years ago. No, that's probably too early and wrong location. Option I is sub-Saharan Africa, 8,500 years ago. Not matching. Option J is Australia, 7,500 years ago. No way, since Australia didn't have cattle until Europeans brought them.

So the correct answer should be option C: the Middle East, about 10,500 years ago. I'm pretty confident about that. Let me just make sure I'm not mixing up the dates. Some sources might say 10,000 years ago, but 10,500 is close enough and the option is there.

The domestication of cattle is closely associated with the Neolithic period and the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. Archaeological evidence points to this region as the origin, with the process beginning around 10,500 years ago. This aligns with the transition from a nomadic to an agricultural lifestyle. Among the options provided, option C correctly identifies the location and timeframe.

Answer: C
