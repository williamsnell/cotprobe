Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question is asking which fallacy occurs when someone argues in favor of a two-part proposition but only supports one part and then claims the entire proposition is supported. The options are A through D, with the answers being a priori, Complex proposition, Extension, and Appeal to ignorance.

First, I need to understand what each of these terms means. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: a priori. I remember that a priori refers to knowledge or reasoning that's independent of experience. Like, it's knowledge derived from reason alone, not from observation. For example, mathematical truths are a priori. But wait, how does that relate to the question? The scenario describes someone not fully supporting their proposition, so I don't think a priori is the right fit here. That seems more about the source of knowledge rather than argument structure.

Option B: Complex proposition. Hmm, a complex proposition is one that contains multiple propositions, like a compound statement. For example, "It is raining and the ground is wet." But the question isn't about the structure of the proposition itself; it's about how someone argues for it. So I'm not sure this is the right answer either. It might be a part of the setup but not the fallacy itself.

Option C: Extension. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I think extension might refer to the scope or the range of something. Wait, in logic, sometimes "extension" relates to the set of things a term applies to. Or maybe it's about extending an argument beyond its premises. Alternatively, I've heard of the "denying the correlative" fallacy, but that's not one of the options here. Alternatively, maybe it's about not addressing all parts of a proposition, which would fit the scenario. Let me hold onto that thought.

Option D: Appeal to ignorance. This fallacy happens when someone argues that since something hasn't been proven false, it's true, or vice versa. For example, "Since we can't prove aliens don't exist, they must exist." That doesn't quite match the situation described, where the issue is supporting only part of a proposition. So I don't think D is the right choice.

Wait, maybe I'm forgetting another fallacy. The scenario sounds familiar. When someone presents a proposition that has two parts (like an "and" statement) and only supports one part, then claims the whole is supported, that's a specific fallacy. Oh, right! I think it's called "denying the antecedent" or "affirming the consequent," but no, those are different. Wait, no, those are types of fallacies in conditional statements. 

Wait, another possibility: the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion. No, that's when the argument supports a different conclusion than intended. Alternatively, maybe it's the "Strawman" fallacy, but that's misrepresenting someone else's argument. 

Oh, wait! I think the correct term here is "fallacy of the undistributed middle" or perhaps "complex question." No, complex question is when a question assumes something that hasn't been proven. 

Wait, another approach: The structure is a two-part proposition, say P and Q. The person argues for P but not Q, then concludes P and Q are both true. This is a type of fallacy where only part of the proposition is addressed. I think this is called the "fallacy of extension" or maybe "undue assumption," but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's the "fallacy of the whole," but that's not matching.

Wait, another thought: The fallacy where one supports part of a proposition and claims the whole is supported is sometimes called "part-to-whole fallacy" or "fallacy of division." But wait, division is when you attribute a property of the whole to its parts. The opposite is the fallacy of composition, where you attribute a property of the parts to the whole. But that's not exactly the scenario here.

Alternatively, maybe it's the "package deal fallacy," where an argument treats a group of things as a package, assuming that if one part is true, the whole is. Wait, that's more about treating multiple components as an inseparable package.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the definitions. The fallacy in question is when someone supports only one part of a two-part proposition and then claims the entire proposition is supported. So, for example, if someone argues, "We should invest in both renewable energy and nuclear power because renewable energy is clean," they're only supporting the first part. The fallacy here is that they're only addressing one part of the conjunction.

I think this is called the "fallacy of the complex question" but no, that's more about asking a question that assumes a premise. Alternatively, it's the "fallacy of the whole," but that's about treating a whole as a part.

Wait, perhaps it's the "fallacy of the undistributed middle term," but that's related to syllogisms. Or maybe it's the "fallacy of affirming a disjunct," but that's about OR statements, not AND.

Oh! I think I've got it. The correct term for this is "fallacy of the complex proposition" or maybe "complex question," but that's not matching. Wait, no, complex question is different.

Wait, another angle: The fallacy is called "supporting only one side of the proposition." Maybe it's the "fallacy of partial support" or "incomplete support." But I don't recall those being standard terms.

Wait, perhaps it's the "fallacy of the unexamined premise," but that's when a premise is accepted without question. Not exactly.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about the options again. The options given are A: a priori, B: Complex proposition, C: Extension, D: Appeal to ignorance.

Wait, the question is about supporting only one part of the proposition and claiming the whole is supported. So, for example, if someone says, "We should do X because Y and Z," and they only provide evidence for Y but not Z, they're committing this fallacy.

I think the correct term here is the "fallacy of the complex proposition." Because the proposition is complex (two parts), and the person only supports one part. So option B would be the answer.

Alternatively, I might be mixing it up. Wait, "complex proposition" is the structure, but the fallacy would be about how it's supported. So maybe the fallacy is called "complex question," but that's different.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall: The fallacy where only one part is supported is sometimes called the "fallacy of the half-proof" or "incomplete evidence." But I don't think that's one of the options.

Wait, another approach: The fallacy is called "missing the point" or "irrelevant conclusion," but that's when the argument doesn't address the issue. Not quite.

Alternatively, maybe it's the "fallacy of the undistributed middle," but that's a syllogistic fallacy.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: Complex proposition. Because the proposition is complex (has two parts), and the argument only supports one part, thus the fallacy is related to the complex proposition. So the answer would be B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the "fallacy of extension," option C. Because the person is extending the support from one part to the entire proposition without proper basis.

Wait, what's the definition of "extension" in logic? Extension refers to the set of things to which a term applies. So, maybe in this context, the fallacy is about extending the support beyond what's warranted, thus option C: Extension.

Wait, but I'm not certain. I think the correct answer is B: Complex proposition. Because the fallacy arises in the context of a complex (two-part) proposition where only one part is supported. So the answer is B.

Alternatively, I might be mixing it up. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose someone argues, "We should go to the beach because it's sunny and the water is warm," but only provides evidence that it's sunny. They're supporting only one part of the complex proposition. The fallacy is that they're treating the entire proposition as supported when only part is. So that's the fallacy of the complex proposition, which would be option B.

Wait, but another angle: The fallacy is called "denying the correlative," but I don't see that as an option. Alternatively, perhaps it's the "package deal fallacy," but that's not listed either.

I think I'm going to go with option B: Complex proposition as the answer because the fallacy specifically relates to a complex proposition where not all parts are supported.

The question asks which fallacy occurs when someone argues in favor of a two-part proposition, only supports one part, and then asserts that the entire proposition has been supported. To determine the correct answer, let us analyze the options:

1. **Option A: a priori**  
   This refers to knowledge or reasoning derived from reason alone, independent of experience. It does not relate to the structure of arguments or the support of propositions, so this is not the correct answer.

2. **Option B: Complex proposition**  
   A complex proposition is one that contains multiple parts, such as a compound statement (e.g., "P and Q"). The fallacy in question arises when only one part of the proposition is supported, but the entire proposition is claimed to be supported. This matches the scenario described, making this a strong candidate for the correct answer.

3. **Option C: Extension**  
   In logic, "extension" typically refers to the set of things to which a term applies. While the fallacy described involves extending support for one part of a proposition to the whole, this term does not specifically describe the fallacy in question.

4. **Option D: Appeal to ignorance**  
   This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim is true simply because it has not been proven false (or vice versa). This does not match the scenario described, so this is not the correct answer.

The fallacy described in the question specifically involves arguing in favor of a complex proposition (a two-part statement) but only supporting one part and claiming the entire proposition is supported. This aligns with the concept of a "complex proposition" and the fallacy associated with it. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Complex proposition**
