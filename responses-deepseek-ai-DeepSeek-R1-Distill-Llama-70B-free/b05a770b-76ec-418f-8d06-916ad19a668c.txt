Okay, so I've got this question here with two statements about ring theory and fields. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through them step by step.

Let's start with Statement 1: If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then the degree of (f(x) + g(x)) is the maximum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x). Hmm. I remember that when you add two polynomials, the degree of the sum is at most the maximum of their individual degrees. But wait, does it always equal the maximum? What if the leading terms cancel each other out?

Oh right! For example, let's say f(x) is a polynomial of degree 3, and g(x) is another of degree 3, but their leading coefficients are negatives of each other. So when you add them, the x^3 terms would cancel, and the resulting polynomial would have a degree less than 3. So in that case, deg(f+g) would not be the max of the two degrees. Therefore, Statement 1 isn't always true. So Statement 1 is False.

Moving on to Statement 2: If F is a field, then every ideal of F[x] is principal. I remember that in a field, the polynomial ring F[x] is a principal ideal domain (PID). PID means every ideal is generated by a single element, so every ideal is principal. Yeah, that's right. So Statement 2 is True.

So looking at the options, I need to find where Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is True. Let's check the options.

Option G says False, True. Option G is the correct one.

Statement 1: If \( R \) is a ring and \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are in \( R[x] \), then \( \deg(f(x) + g(x)) = \max(\deg f(x), \deg g(x)) \).  
This is not always true because if the leading coefficients of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) cancel each other out when added, the degree of the sum will be less than the maximum of the degrees of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). Hence, Statement 1 is **False**.

Statement 2: If \( F \) is a field, then every ideal of \( F[x] \) is principal.  
This is true because \( F[x] \) is a principal ideal domain (PID) when \( F \) is a field. In a PID, every ideal is generated by a single element, making all ideals principal. Hence, Statement 2 is **True**.

From the given options, the correct choice is **G: False, True**.

Answer: G
