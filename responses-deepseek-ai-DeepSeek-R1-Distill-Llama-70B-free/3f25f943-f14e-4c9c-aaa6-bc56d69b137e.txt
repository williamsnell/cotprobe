Okay, so I've got this question here about the nickname of the Federal National Mortgage Association. Hmm, I remember that there are these big organizations in the US related to mortgages, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Wait, the question is about the Federal National Mortgage Association specifically. I think Fannie Mae is the nickname for that. Let me think... FNMA stands for Federal National Mortgage Association, right? And Fannie Mae is the common name people use for it. So looking at the options, option B is Fannie Mac, which is probably the correct answer. Freddie Mac is a different entity, I believe, maybe the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. So the answer should be B: Fannie Mac.
