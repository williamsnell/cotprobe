Okay, so I've got this EPR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a PO3^- radical produces a pair of lines separated by 280 MHz with giso = 2.005. I need to calculate the expected resonant field positions of both lines in the X-band EPR spectrum, where the frequency ν is 9.5 GHz. The options are from A to J, each giving different magnetic field values for mI = -½ and +½.

Hmm, I remember that EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) deals with the interaction between the magnetic moments of unpaired electrons and an external magnetic field. The basic equation I think is the resonance condition for EPR, which is hν = gμ_B B + ... something with hyperfine interaction maybe?

Wait, hyperfine splitting. Oh right, the PO3^- ion has a phosphorus nucleus with spin I. Phosphorus has an atomic number of 15, and its most common isotope is P-31, which has a nuclear spin I = 1/2. So each mI can be -1/2 and +1/2.

The hyperfine interaction will split each electronic transition into two lines, separated by the hyperfine coupling constant. The separation between the lines is given as 280 MHz. That's in frequency terms, right?

But how does this translate into the magnetic field separation? Because in EPR, the resonance condition depends on the magnetic field. Oh wait, the hyperfine splitting in terms of magnetic field can be calculated using the formula ΔB = (A * h) / (gμ_B), where A is the hyperfine coupling constant in frequency units. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, I think the general approach is to use the resonance condition for each hyperfine line. The resonance field for each mI is given by solving the equation for the Zeeman effect plus hyperfine interaction.

The resonance condition in EPR is when the microwave frequency ν matches the energy difference between the spin states. For a system with electron Zeeman interaction and hyperfine interaction, the resonance condition is:

hν = gμ_B B + A mI

Wait, no, wait. The hyperfine term usually involves the nuclear spin. The energy levels split due to hyperfine interaction, so the separation between the two lines comes from the difference in mI.

Wait, the energy of each state is given by E = gμ_B B m_S + A m_I m_S. But assuming we're dealing with m_S = ±1/2 transitions, but wait, for EPR transitions, the selection rules are Δm_S = ±1 and Δm_I = 0. So the hyperfine splitting affects the energy levels, and the transition between m_S = -1/2 to +1/2 would occur at a field dependent on the hyperfine interaction.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Breit-Rabi formula, but that's more for when the hyperfine interaction is comparable to the Zeeman effect, which is usually in atomic physics. For EPR, maybe it's simpler.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the resonance magnetic field when hyperfine interaction is present is given by:

B_res = (hν/gμ_B) - (A m_I)/(gμ_B)

Wait, let me think. The basic resonance condition without hyperfine would be hν = gμ_B B. So B = hν/(gμ_B).

But with hyperfine, the energy levels are split by A m_I, so the effective field would be shifted. So the resonance occurs when:

gμ_B B = hν - A m_I

Wait, maybe. So solving for B:

B = (h ν - A m_I) / (g μ_B )

But wait, the hyperfine coupling constant A is typically given in units of frequency (like MHz), right? So perhaps I should express everything in consistent units.

Wait, the hyperfine splitting in frequency is 280 MHz. So each line is separated by 280 MHz. Hmm. So the two lines correspond to mI = +1/2 and -1/2. Since the separation is 280 MHz, the difference in their resonance frequencies is 280 MHz.

But wait, in EPR, the separation in magnetic field terms is what's measured. Oh wait, no, the problem states that the separation is in frequency, 280 MHz, but we need to find the corresponding magnetic field positions for each line.

Wait, maybe I should first find the hyperfine coupling constant A in terms of magnetic field.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The X-band frequency is given as 9.5 GHz. So ν = 9.5e9 Hz.

The g-factor is 2.005.

The hyperfine splitting is 280 MHz, which is 280e6 Hz.

I think the formula that relates the hyperfine splitting to the magnetic field is:

ΔB = (h * Δν) / (g μ_B)

Wait, but wait. The hyperfine splitting in terms of magnetic field can be found by considering that a change in magnetic field would shift the resonance. Alternatively, the separation in the resonance fields for the two mI states would be proportional to the hyperfine coupling.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the hyperfine interaction is A m_I, where A is the hyperfine coupling constant in energy units (like Joules). But A can also be expressed in terms of frequency by dividing by h. So A (frequency) = A (energy) / h.

So the separation in energy between the two mI states is A*(1/2 - (-1/2)) )= A*(1) = A.

So Δν = A / h.

Wait, the separation in frequency is given as 280 MHz, which is 280e6 Hz. So A = h * Δν.

But wait, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

Calculating A: 6.626e-34 J·s * 280e6 Hz = 1.855e-25 J·m.

Wait, but perhaps I should express A in terms of magnetic field. Since the Zeeman energy is g μ_B B, maybe the hyperfine term can be considered as a shift in the magnetic field.

Wait, the energy from the hyperfine interaction is E_hyper = A m_I. But in terms of magnetic field, if I consider that a change in B would cause a change in the Zeeman energy, maybe I can find the equivalent B shift that corresponds to the hyperfine splitting.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation A = g μ_B ΔB, where ΔB is the hyperfine splitting in magnetic field. Wait, that might make sense.

So rearranging, ΔB = A/(g μ_B).

But earlier, A (in energy) is h * Δν. So:

ΔB = (h Δν) / (g μ_B )

Yes, that seems right.

So let's plug in the numbers. Δν is 280 MHz = 280e6 Hz.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

g = 2.005.

μ_B is the Bohr magneton, approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

So:

ΔB = (6.626e-34 * 280e6) / (2.005 * 9.274e-24)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 280e6 = 6.626 * 280 * 1e-34+6 = 1855.28e-28 = 1.85528e-25 J·s * Hz? Hmm, but wait, Hz is 1/s, so units would be J.

Wait, 6.626e-34 J·s * 280e6 1/s = 6.626e-34 * 2.8e8 = let's compute 6.626 * 2.8 = approx 18.55, so 18.55e-26 J·s²? Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled up with the units here. Let me just compute the numerical value.

6.626e-34 * 280e6 = 6.626 * 280 = let's compute that. 6 * 280 = 1680, 0.626 * 280 ≈ 175. So total ≈ 1680 + 175 = 1855. So 1855e-34+6 = 1855e-28 = 1.855e-25 J·s²? Hmm, perhaps I should just calculate the numerical value.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 280e6 = 6.626 * 280 * 1e-34 * 1e6 = 6.626 * 280 * 1e-28.

6.626 * 280 = let's compute 6 * 280 = 1680, 0.626 * 280 ≈ 175.48. So 1680 + 175.48 = 1855.48. So 1855.48e-28 J·s * s^-1? Because 1e6 is 1e6, and 1e-34 is 1e-34.

Wait, perhaps the units are getting too complicated. Let me just compute the numerical value correctly.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 280e6 = (6.626 * 280) * 1e-34 * 1e6 = (1855.28) * 1e-28 = 1.85528e-25 J.

Denominator: 2.005 * 9.274e-24 = approx 2.005 * 9.274 ≈ 18.6. So 18.6e-24 J/T.

So ΔB = (1.85528e-25 J) / (18.6e-24 J/T) ) = (1.85528 / 18.6) * (1e-25 / 1e-24) = (approx 0.0997) * 10 = 0.997 Tesla? Wait, that's like 997 mT? That seems too high.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 300 mT range. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the math.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 280e6

6.626 * 280 = 1855.28.

Then 1e-34 * 1e6 = 1e-28.

So 1855.28e-28 = 1.85528e-25 J.

Denominator: 2.005 * 9.274e-24 = let's compute 2.005 * 9.274.

2 * 9.274 = 18.548; 0.005 * 9.274 = 0.04637. So total is 18.548 + 0.04637 = 18.59437.

So denominator is 18.59437e-24 J/T.

So ΔB = 1.85528e-25 / 18.59437e-24.

Divide numerator and denominator:

1.85528e-25 / 1.859437e-23 (since 18.59e-24 is 1.8594e-23).

Wait, 18.59437e-24 = 1.859437e-23.

So 1.85528e-25 / 1.859437e-23 = (1.85528 / 1.859437) * 1e-2.

1.85528 / 1.859437 is approximately 0.9974.

So 0.9974 * 1e-2 = 0.009974 T, which is 9.974 mT.

Wait, that's around 10 mT. So the separation between the two lines is approximately 10 mT.

Wait, but the options have separations like 10 mT (option A has 335-325=10 mT; option D has 343.5-333.5=10 mT, etc.).

But wait, the problem states that the pair of lines are separated by 280 MHz, which we just calculated corresponds to a ΔB of about 10 mT.

So each line is separated by 10 mT. So, for mI = -1/2 and mI = +1/2, their Bres will be 5 mT below and above the central field, perhaps.

Wait, but wait. The central field is the field without hyperfine splitting, which would be at B0 = hν/(gμ_B).

So let me compute B0 first.

B0 = h ν / (g μ_B).

ν is 9.5 GHz = 9.5e9 Hz.

So:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

g = 2.005

μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T.

So B0 = (6.626e-34 * 9.5e9) / (2.005 * 9.274e-24 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 9.5e9 = 6.626 *9.5= approx 62.917, so 62.917e-34+9 = 62.917e-25 = 6.2917e-24 J·s * Hz? Wait, Hz is 1/s, so units-wise, J·s * 1/s = J.

Denominator: 2.005 * 9.274e-24 = as before approx 18.594e-24 J/T.

So B0 = (6.2917e-24 J) / (18.594e-24 J/T) ) = 6.2917 / 18.594 ≈ 0.3386 Tesla, which is 338.6 mT.

So B0 is approximately 338.6 mT.

Now, the hyperfine splitting is about 10 mT, so each line is 5 mT away from B0? Or wait, no, the separation is 10 mT, so one is 5 mT below, the other 5 mT above? Or wait, maybe the separation is 10 mT between the two lines.

Wait, in our earlier calculation, we found that the separation is approximately 10 mT. So the two lines would be centered around B0, each 5 mT away, so one at 338.6 -5 = 333.6 mT, the other at 338.6 +5= 343.6 mT.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says:

Bres for mI = -½ = 333.5 mT; Bres for mI = +½ = 343.5 mT.

That matches our calculation. Our approximate B0 was 338.6 mT, and each line is 5 mT away, giving 333.6 and 343.6, which rounds to 333.5 and 343.5 as in option D.

Wait, but why is mI = -½ at lower field and +½ at higher field? Because the hyperfine term adds to the Zeeman energy. So the energy for mI = +½ is higher, which would correspond to a lower magnetic field needed for resonance.

Wait, let me think. The resonance condition is hν = g μ_B B + A mI.

Wait, when mI is positive, the term A mI adds to the energy, so to achieve resonance at the same frequency, a lower B is needed. Or wait, the equation is B = (hν - A mI) / (g μ_B).

So for mI = +½, A mI is positive, so B = (hν - A/2 ) / (g μ_B ), which would be lower than B0, which is hν/(g μ_B ). Similarly, for mI = -½, B would be (hν + A/2 )/(g μ_B ), which is higher than B0.

Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Let me make sure. Because if mI = +½, then the hyperfine term is positive, so hν = g μ_B B + A mI. To keep the same ν, if A mI is positive, g μ_B B must be smaller, so B must be smaller. So for mI = +½, B is lower than B0, and for mI = -½, B is higher than B0.

Wait, in our calculation, B0 is 338.6 mT. So for mI = +½, B would be B0 - (A/2)/(g μ_B ). But wait, the separation we found was 10 mT between the two lines. So if the separation is 10 mT, then one line is at B0 - 5 mT, the other at B0 +5 mT.

Wait, no. Because the two lines correspond to mI = +½ and -½. So for mI = +½, B is lower by (A/2)/(g μ_B ), and for mI = -½, it's higher by (A/2)/(g μ_B ). So the separation between the two lines would be 2*(A/(2 g μ_B )) ) = A/(g μ_B ), which is what we calculated as ΔB = 10 mT.

So the two Bres would be B0 ± (ΔB/2). So 338.6 -5 = 333.6 mT, and 338.6 +5= 343.6 mT.

So looking at the options, D is exactly that: 333.5 and 343.5 mT.

Wait, but the options have mI = -½ at 333.5 and mI = +½ at 343.5. That would mean that for mI = -½, B is lower. But according to our equation, mI = -½ would have a higher B.

Wait, perhaps I have the assignment reversed. Let me think again.

The equation is B = (h ν - A mI )/(g μ_B )

So for mI = +½, B = (h ν - A*(+½) )/(g μ_B )

Which would be (h ν - A/2 )/(g μ_B ) = B0 - (A)/(2 g μ_B )

Similarly, for mI = -½, B = (h ν - A*(-½) )/(g μ_B ) = B0 + (A)/(2 g μ_B )

So yes, mI = +½ gives a lower B, mI = -½ gives a higher B.

So the line for mI = +½ is at lower B, and mI = -½ is at higher B.

Wait, but in the options, option D has mI=-½ at 333.5
