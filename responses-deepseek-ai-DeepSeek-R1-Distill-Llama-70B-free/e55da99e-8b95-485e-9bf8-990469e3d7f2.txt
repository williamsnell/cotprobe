Okay, so I've got this problem here about dividing a group of 10 people into 3 non-empty subsets, and I need to figure out how many ways that can be done. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

Wait, subsets, right. So each person can go into any of the three subsets, but none of the subsets can be empty. Oh, right, so it's not just about assigning each person to a group, but ensuring that all three groups end up with at least one person.

I remember something about this being related to Stirling numbers of the second kind. Stirling numbers count the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. The formula for the Stirling number S(n,k) gives the number of ways to partition n elements into k non-empty, unlabeled subsets.

So in this case, n is 10 and k is 3. So I need to find S(10,3) and then multiply by the number of ways to label the subsets, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Because if the subsets are labeled (like if they're called Group A, Group B, Group C), then the formula is different than if they're unlabeled.

Wait, the question is about dividing into 3 non-empty subsets. It doesn't specify if the subsets are distinguishable or not. Hmm. Usually, when the problem says "subsets," it might mean indistinct, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, let me think again.

In combinatorics, the number of ways to partition into k non-empty, unlabeled subsets is S(n,k). But if the subsets are labeled, like if each is a distinct group (say, different teams), then the number is k! * S(n,k). Because for each partition into k unlabeled subsets, we can arrange them in k! ways.

Wait, but the question here is about subsets. So are the subsets considered labeled or not? Hmm. The problem states "divided into 3 non-empty subsets," which might imply that the order doesn't matter. Because subsets aren't ordered. So if the subsets are not labeled, then the answer would be S(10,3).

Alternatively, if the problem considers the subsets as labeled (like assigning to different roles or groups where order matters), then the answer would be higher, as we'd multiply by 3! or something. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, no. The formula for the number of onto functions is k! * S(n,k), but that's when each element is assigned to exactly one of k labeled boxes, and none are empty. So that would be for labeled subsets. So in this problem, if the subsets are labeled, the answer would be 3! * S(10,3). But if they're not, then it's just S(10,3).

But the question is about dividing into subsets, so I'm more inclined to think they're unlabeled. So I should find S(10,3).

Alternatively, another approach is to use inclusion-exclusion. The total number of ways to assign each of the 10 people into 3 subsets (without any restrictions) is 3^10. But since each subset must be non-empty, we have to subtract those cases where at least one subset is empty.

So the inclusion-exclusion approach would be:

Number of onto functions = 3^10 - C(3,1)*2^10 + C(3,2)*1^10.

Wait let me compute that.

Compute each term:

3^10 is 59049.

C(3,1)*2^10: C(3,1)=3, 2^10=1024, so 3*1024=3072.

C(3,2)=3, 1^10=1, so 3*1=3.

So the total is 59049 - 3072 + 3.

Wait, wait, inclusion-exclusion formula is:

Sum_{k=0 to 3} (-1)^k * C(3, k) * (3 -k)^10.

Wait, more accurately, the number of onto functions is sum_{k=0 to 3} (-1)^k * C(3, k) * (3 -k)^10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The formula for the number of onto functions from a set of size n to a set of size k is k! * S(n,k). Alternatively, it's sum_{i=0 to k} (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (k-i)^n.

So for k=3, n=10, it would be sum_{i=0 to 3} (-1)^i * C(3,i)*(3-i)^10.

Compute each term:

i=0: (-1)^0 * C(3,0)*3^10 = 1 * 1 * 59049 = 59049.

i=1: (-1)^1 * C(3,1)*2^10 = -1 * 3 * 1024 = -3072.

i=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*1^10 = 1 * 3 * 1 = 3.

i=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*0^10 = (-1)^3 * 1 * 0 = 0.

So adding them up: 59049 -3072 +3 = 59049-3069 = 55980.

Wait, wait, let me compute 59049 -3072 = 55977, then +3 is 55980.

So the number of onto functions is 55980.

But wait, this is the number of ways to assign each person to one of 3 labeled subsets, none empty. So if the problem's subsets are labeled, that's the answer.

But if the problem considers the subsets as unlabeled, then we would have to divide by 3! because the order of the subsets doesn't matter.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when you count the number of onto functions, you're assuming each subset is distinct. So that's for labeled subsets. So if the problem is asking for unlabeled subsets, then the answer would be S(10,3), which is 55980 divided by 3! ?

Wait no, wait. Because S(n,k) is the number of partitions into k unlabeled subsets. So S(10,3) is the number of ways to split into 3 non-empty unlabeled subsets. So the number of onto functions, which is 3! * S(10,3), would be 6 * S(10,3) = 55980.

So S(10,3) = 55980 / 6 = 9330.

Looking at the options, option I is 9330.

Alternatively, if the problem is considering labeled subsets, the answer would be 55980, which isn't one of the options. So the question must be about unlabeled subsets, so S(10,3)=9330. Option I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, subsets are considered as labeled. But the term "subsets" in combinatorics usually refers to unlabeled. So I think the correct answer is 9330, which is option I.

But wait, let me double-check. Another way to compute S(10,3) is using the formula:

S(n,k) = S(n-1,k-1) + k*S(n-1,k).

But calculating S(10,3) step by step would take time, so perhaps I can look up the value or compute it using another formula.

Alternatively, another formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:

S(n,k) = (1/k!) ) * sum_{i=0 to k} (-1)^i * C(k,i) * (k - i)^n.

Which is exactly the same as the inclusion-exclusion approach. So yes, S(10,3) would be (1/6) * (3^10 - 3*2^10 + 3*1^10) = (59049 - 3072 +3)/6 = (55980)/6 = 9330.

So the correct answer is 9330, which is option I.

To determine the number of ways to divide a group of 10 people into 3 non-empty subsets, we use the concept of Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as \( S(n, k) \), which count the number of ways to partition \( n \) elements into \( k \) non-empty, unlabeled subsets. For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 3 \), the problem asks for \( S(10, 3) \).

The formula for \( S(n, k) \) is:

\[
S(n, k) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i \binom{k}{i} (k - i)^n
\]

Substituting \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 3 \):

\[
S(10, 3) = \frac{1}{3!} \left[ 3^{10} - \binom{3}{1} \cdot 2^{10} + \binom{3}{2} \cdot 1^{10} \right]
\]

Compute each term:

1. \( 3^{10} = 59049 \)
2. \( \binom{3}{1} \cdot 2^{10} = 3 \cdot 1024 = 3072 \)
3. \( \binom{3}{2} \cdot 1^{10} = 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \)

Substituting these values:

\[
S(10, 3) = \frac{1}{6} \left[ 59049 - 3072 + 3 \right] = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 55980 = 9330
\]

Thus, the number of ways to divide the group of 10 people into 3 non-empty subsets is \( 9330 \).

Looking at the options, the correct answer is **I: 9330**.
