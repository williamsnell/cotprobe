Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the decomposition of mercury(II) oxide into oxygen gas and mercury metal. Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen this way, right?

The problem says that when 4.32 grams of solid mercury(II) oxide decomposes, how many moles of oxygen gas are formed. The formula mass given is 216 g/mol. Hmm, wait, formula mass—so molar mass of HgO is 216 grams per mole. Got it.

First, I think I need to write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction. Mercury(II) oxide decomposing into mercury and oxygen. The formula for mercury(II) oxide is HgO. So the reaction is:

HgO → Hg + O2

But I need to balance it. Let's see. On the left, there's one Hg and one O. On the right, Hg is a liquid, so it's Hg(l), and O2 is oxygen gas. So balancing mercury first. Each HgO produces one Hg, so the mercury is balanced if we have one HgO on the left and one Hg on the right.

Now for oxygen. Each HgO has one O atom. So to make O2 molecules, which have two atoms each, we need two HgO molecules to give two O atoms. Let's try:

2 HgO → 2 Hg + O2↑

Wait, let me check. 2 moles of HgO would produce 2 moles of Hg and 1 mole of O2. Because each HgO gives one O, so 2 HgO gives 2 O atoms, which form one O2 molecule. That makes sense. So the balanced equation is 2 HgO → 2 Hg + O2.

Okay, so from the balanced equation, 2 moles of HgO produce 1 mole of O2. So the mole ratio is 2:1 for HgO to O2.

Now the problem gives me 4.32 grams of HgO. I need to find out how many moles of O2 are formed. So the steps are: grams of HgO to moles of HgO, then use the mole ratio to find moles of O2.

First, calculate moles of HgO. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 4.32 g divided by 216 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 4.32 divided by 216. Hmm, 216 is 24 times 9, which is 216=24*9. 4.32 divided by 216. Let me see: 4.32 / 216 = ?

Well, 216 times 0.02 is 4.32 because 216 * 0.02 = 4.32. Oh wait, that's right. So 4.32 g HgO is 0.02 moles of HgO.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 216 g/mol is the molar mass. So 4.32 grams is 4.32 / 216 = 0.02 moles. Because 216 * 0.02 = 4.32. Yep, that's correct.

Now, from the balanced equation, 2 moles of HgO produce 1 mole of O2. So the moles of O2 would be moles of HgO divided by 2.

So 0.02 moles HgO * (1 mole O2 / 2 moles HgO) = 0.01 moles O2.

Wait, is that right? So 0.02 divided by 2 is 0.01. So 0.01 moles of O2 are produced.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.0100 mol. So the answer should be E.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me go through it again.

Mass of HgO = 4.32 g. Molar mass of HgO is 216 g/mol.

Molar mass calculation: Mercury is about 200.59 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. 200.59 + 16.00 = 216.59, but the question says 216 g/mol, probably rounded. So correct.

Moles HgO = 4.32 g / 216 g/mol = 0.02 mol.

From the balanced equation, 2 HgO → 1 O2. So moles O2 = (moles HgO) * (1/2) = 0.02 * 0.5 = 0.01 mol.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is E: 0.0100 mol.

To determine how many moles of oxygen gas (O₂) are formed when 4.32 g of mercury(II) oxide (HgO) decomposes, we start by writing and balancing the chemical equation:

\[
2 \, \text{HgO} \rightarrow 2 \, \text{Hg} + \text{O}_2
\]

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of HgO produce 1 mole of O₂, giving a mole ratio of HgO to O₂ as 2:1.

Next, calculate the number of moles of HgO:

\[
\text{Moles of HgO} = \frac{\text{Mass of HgO}}{\text{Molar Mass of HgO}} = \frac{4.32 \, \text{g}}{216 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.02 \, \text{mol}
\]

Using the mole ratio from the balanced equation, the moles of O₂ formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of O}_2 = \text{Moles of HgO} \times \frac{1 \, \text{mol O}_2}{2 \, \text{mol HgO}} = 0.02 \, \text{mol} \times 0.5 = 0.01 \, \text{mol}
\]

Thus, the number of moles of oxygen gas formed is **0.0100 mol**.

The correct answer is:

**E: 0.0100 mol**
