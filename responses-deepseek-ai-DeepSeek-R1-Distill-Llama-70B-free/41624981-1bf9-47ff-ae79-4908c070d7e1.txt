Question:

In an action for malpractice, a plaintiff sued a doctor, claiming that the latter failed to properly diagnose his emphysema condition. The plaintiff contends that he went to the doctor for a medical examination after experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath. However, the doctor found no evidence of the disease and advised him that he was probably suffering from indigestion. Thereafter, the plaintiff was examined by another doctor who discovered that the plaintiff in fact was suffering from a chronic case of emphysema. At trial, the plaintiff calls the other doctor as his first witness. The other doctor proposes to testify the x-rays of the plaintiff's lungs showed that his respiratory organs were marked by distension, which was characteristic of emphysema. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the testimony should be

Options:

A: admitted, because a doctor is properly qualified as an expert in medical matters.
B: admitted, because the other doctor followed accepted medical practice in arriving at his opinion.
C: excluded, because his opinion is based upon facts not in evidence.
D: excluded, because the x-rays are the best evidence to show the distension of the plaintiff's lungs.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with expert testimony and the best evidence rule. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a malpractice case where the plaintiff sued a doctor for failing to properly diagnose his emphysema. The plaintiff went to the doctor with chest pains and shortness of breath, but the doctor didn't find evidence of emphysema and told him it was probably indigestion. Later, another doctor found that the plaintiff actually had chronic emphysema. 

At trial, the plaintiff calls this second doctor as a witness. The doctor wants to testify that the x-rays of the plaintiff's lungs showed distension characteristic of emphysema. The defense objects, and we need to determine whether the testimony should be admitted or excluded, and why.

The options are A through D. 

First, I need to think about the rules of evidence that apply here. Expert testimony is allowed when the witness is qualified as an expert and the testimony is based on reliable principles and methods. But there's also the best evidence rule, which says that to prove the content of a writing or a recording, the original is preferred. However, there are exceptions, like when the original is lost or not obtainable.

In this case, the doctor is testifying about the x-rays. The x-rays are physical objects, so if the testimony is about the content of the x-rays (like showing distension), do we need the x-rays themselves to be admitted into evidence first? Or can the doctor describe what he saw?

Wait, the best evidence rule typically applies to writings, recordings, and photographs. X-rays are a type of photograph, so under the best evidence rule, to prove what the x-ray shows, the original x-ray should be produced unless reasons are given why it's not possible. 

But here, the doctor isn't testifying about the content of the x-ray as an image; he's giving his expert opinion based on what he observed in the x-ray. So, the x-ray would be the basis of his opinion, but the opinion itself is a separate matter.

Wait, but under the best evidence rule, if the testimony is about the content of the x-ray, like what the x-ray shows, then the original x-ray should be produced. So if the doctor is saying that the x-rays showed distension, that's testimony about the content of the x-ray. Therefore, the x-ray itself should be the best evidence, and without it, the testimony might be excluded.

But another angle: the doctor's testimony is based on his examination of the x-rays. So he's not just testifying about the fact that the x-ray exists, but interpreting it. So perhaps the x-rays are not required because the testimony is about his expert opinion, not the content of the x-ray itself. Or is it?

Wait, the best evidence rule applies when a party is trying to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph. So if the doctor is testifying that the x-ray shows distension, that's about the content of the x-ray (a photograph), so the original x-ray should be produced. Without it, the testimony might be inadmissible unless an exception applies.

But then again, expert witnesses can base their opinions on facts or data in the case, which may be made known to them at or before the hearing. The x-rays would be part of the medical records, so the doctor's opinion is based on those. However, if the x-rays aren't in evidence, can the doctor still testify about their findings?

Wait, I think the distinction is whether the testimony is about the content of the x-ray or the doctor's interpretation. If the doctor is testifying that in his opinion, based on the x-rays he reviewed, the plaintiff has emphysema, then that's expert testimony and the x-rays don't necessarily need to be in evidence unless the opposing party challenges the foundation. But if the testimony is about what the x-ray shows (like the presence of distension), then the x-ray itself should be the best evidence.

So in this question, the doctor is testifying that the x-rays showed distension, which is characteristic of emphysema. That sounds like he's describing the content of the x-ray. So under the best evidence rule, the x-rays should be produced. Without them, his testimony about what the x-rays show might be excluded.

Wait, but the best evidence rule can be satisfied if the original is not available. If the x-rays are lost or not obtainable, then the testimony could be allowed. But the question doesn't say that the x-rays are unavailable. So perhaps the testimony is being offered without the x-rays being in evidence, which would violate the best evidence rule.

So looking at the options:

Option D says the testimony is excluded because the x-rays are the best evidence. So that would align with the best evidence rule.

Option C says excluded because the opinion is based on facts not in evidence. Wait, the doctor's opinion is based on the x-rays, which may not be in evidence. But if the x-rays are not in evidence, can he testify about his opinion based on them? Or does he need the x-rays to be admitted first?

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The doctor's testimony is about his expert opinion that the x-rays show distension characteristic of emphysema. So the basis of his testimony is the x-rays. If the x-rays are not in evidence, can he still testify about his interpretation?

Wait, the best evidence rule is about proving the content of the x-ray. So the doctor can testify as to his expert opinion based on the x-rays he reviewed, even if the x-rays aren't in evidence, as long as he's not testifying about the content of the x-rays themselves. Or is he?

If the doctor is saying that the x-rays showed distension, that's about the content. So without the x-rays, that part of the testimony might be excluded. But his expert opinion that distension is characteristic of emphysema wouldn't require the x-rays.

Alternatively, maybe the doctor can testify about his diagnosis based on the x-rays without the x-rays being in evidence because the testimony is about his medical opinion, not the content of the x-rays. But I'm not sure.

I think the key here is whether the testimony is about the content of the x-rays. If the doctor is describing what he saw on the x-rays, that's the content. So the best evidence rule applies. Therefore, without the x-rays, the testimony about the x-ray's content is inadmissible.

So the testimony should be excluded because the x-rays are the best evidence. That points to option D.

Wait, but option C says it's excluded because the opinion is based on facts not in evidence. So if the x-rays are not in evidence, then the doctor's testimony about them is based on facts not in evidence. So would that apply?

Hmm. The doctor's opinion is based on the x-rays, which are facts in the case. If the x-rays are not in evidence, can he still base his opinion on them? Or does he need the x-rays to be admitted first?

I think under the rules, an expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case, and those facts or data need not be admissible in evidence but must be of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field. So the expert can base the opinion on information that's not in evidence as long as it's the type experts usually rely on.

But the best evidence rule is a separate consideration. So if the testimony is about the content of the x-ray, the x-ray must be produced unless it's unavailable. So in this case, the testimony is about what the x-ray shows, which is its content.

So the correct reason for exclusion would be the best evidence rule, making option D correct.

Wait, but option C is about the opinion being based on facts not in evidence. If the x-rays are not in evidence, then the doctor's testimony about what they show is based on facts (the x-rays) not in evidence. But wait, the x-rays could be in evidence through another means, but the question doesn't say that. The testimony is being offered without the x-rays, so the underlying facts (the x-ray images) aren't in evidence.

Wait, but the doctor's opinion is based on the x-rays he reviewed. So even if the x-rays aren't in evidence, he can still testify about his opinion, unless the opposing party challenges the underlying facts. In that case, the court may require the x-rays to be produced under the best evidence rule.

So in this scenario, the defense is objecting, and the issue is whether the testimony is admissible. The testimony is about what the x-rays showed, so without the x-rays, it's inadmissible under the best evidence rule.

So the answer would be D.

Alternatively, if the doctor's testimony is about his diagnosis, not the x-ray content, then maybe C isn't correct. But the question says the doctor is testifying about the x-rays showing distension. So that's about the content, thus best evidence applies.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of expert testimony regarding the content of x-rays in a malpractice case. The plaintiff’s doctor testified that the x-rays showed distension characteristic of emphysema, but the defense objected, citing the best evidence rule. The best evidence rule requires the original document, recording, or photograph (like an x-ray) to be produced when the content of that item is at issue. 

The doctor’s testimony specifically describes the content of the x-rays (i.e., the presence of distension), which triggers the best evidence rule. Without the x-rays being admitted into evidence, the testimony about their content is inadmissible. While expert opinions can be based on facts or data not in evidence, the testimony here is not merely an expert opinion but a description of the x-rays’ content. Therefore, the x-rays themselves must be produced unless unavailable, which the question does not indicate. 

Option D correctly identifies that the testimony should be excluded because the x-rays are the best evidence to show the distension of the plaintiff’s lungs. Option C, which focuses on the opinion being based on facts not in evidence, is less precise because the testimony is specifically about the x-rays’ content, making the best evidence rule the primary issue.
