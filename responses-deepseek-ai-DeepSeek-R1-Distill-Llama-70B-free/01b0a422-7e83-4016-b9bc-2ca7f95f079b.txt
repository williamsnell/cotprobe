Question:

One afternoon a motorist was driving her car when she struck a pedestrian who entered the intersection. The pedestrian was seriously injured in the accident and sued the motorist to recover damages for personal injuries. There were no witnesses to the accident. The motorist claims that the traffic light was green at the time she entered the intersection. The pedestrian now has amnesia and cannot remember how the accident occurred. At trial, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that she was in the emergency room at the hospital when the pedestrian was brought in following the accident. The witness further testifies that while the pedestrian was being treated for his injuries, the nurse asked him, "How did you get hurt?" The pedestrian replied, "The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection. "Upon objection, this evidence is

Options:

A: admissible as a present sense impression.
B: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
C: inadmissible, because the witness was eavesdropping on a confidential communication between the pedestrian and a hospital representative.
D: admissible, as it is a declaration against interest.
E: inadmissible, because it is a statement made after the event.
F: inadmissible, because the pedestrian's response was prompted by the nurse's question.
G: inadmissible, because the pedestrian cannot remember the incident.
H: admissible, as it is a statement of past or present mental, emotional, or physical condition.
I: admissible as a statement under stress or excitement.

Okay, so I have this evidence question here about hearsay exceptions. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The scenario is a car accident where a pedestrian was hit and is now suing the motorist. At trial, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness who was in the emergency room when the pedestrian was brought in. The witness testifies that a nurse asked the pedestrian, "How did you get hurt?" and the pedestrian replied that the car ran a red light and struck him. The motorist's attorney objects to this testimony, so I need to figure out if this statement is admissible or not.

First, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the pedestrian's statement here is being offered to show that the motorist ran a red light, which would make her liable. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Now, looking at the exceptions. The options given include present sense impression, excited utterance, statement against interest, and others. 

Let me think about each possibility. 

1. **Present Sense Impression (Option A)**: This exception applies when a statement describes an event made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter. But here, the pedestrian made the statement after the accident, in the emergency room. There's a time gap, so it might not qualify as a present sense impression.

2. **Excited Utterance (Option I)**: This applies when a statement is made under the stress of a startling event. The pedestrian was just injured and in the emergency room. It's possible he was under stress, so this might fit. But I'm not sure if the time frame allows it. The accident happened, then he was treated, so maybe some time passed. But the statement was made while he was being treated, which could still be under the stress of the event.

3. **Statement Against Interest (Option D)**: This applies when the statement is against the declarant's interest. Here, the pedestrian is the plaintiff suing the motorist, so saying the car ran a red light is actually in his interest, not against. So this exception doesn't apply.

4. **Past or Present Mental State (Option H)**: This exception covers statements about the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. But the statement here is about how he got hurt, which is more about the event than his mental state. So probably not applicable.

5. **Other Considerations**: The fact that the pedestrian now has amnesia is important because he can't testify himself. But the statement's admissibility doesn't depend on his current memory; it's about whether the statement fits a hearsay exception.

Another point is that the statement was in response to a nurse's question. Some might argue that the question prompted the statement, making it less spontaneous (Option F says it's inadmissible because it was prompted). But under the Federal Rules, even if a question prompts the statement, as long as it's made under stress, it can still be admissible as an excited utterance.

So putting it together: the statement was made in the emergency room right after the accident. The pedestrian was likely still under the stress of the accident. Therefore, it might qualify as an excited utterance under FRE 803(2). 

Wait, but some might argue that by the time he was in the ER, the stress had subsided. But I think courts usually consider that the event is still fresh enough that the stress continues, especially if he's just been injured and is being treated.

Alternatively, the statement could be a present sense impression if it was made while the event was occurring or immediately after. But the ER is after the event, so maybe not.

So between excited utterance (Option I) and present sense impression (Option A), I'm leaning towards excited utterance. 

Wait, but another thought: the statement was made in response to a question. Does that affect its spontaneity? The rule for excited utterances doesn't require the statement to be completely spontaneous; it's enough that it was made under the stress of the event, regardless of who asked the question. So even if the nurse asked, as long as the pedestrian was still under stress, it's admissible.

So the correct answer would be I: admissible as a statement under stress or excitement.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option I says "admissible as a statement under stress or excitement." That aligns with the excited utterance exception.

Alternatively, Option E says it's inadmissible because it was made after the event. But the timing isn't necessarily too long after; it's in the ER, so maybe it's allowed.

Another point: the pedestrian can't remember now, but that doesn't affect the admissibility of the statement when it was made.

So yes, I think the answer is I: admissible as a statement under stress or excitement.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a hearsay statement made by the pedestrian in the emergency room after the accident. The pedestrian, who now has amnesia, stated to a nurse, "The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection." The key issue is whether this statement falls under a recognized hearsay exception.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the pedestrian's statement is being offered to establish that the motorist ran a red light, making it hearsay unless an exception applies. The analysis focuses on several potential exceptions:

1. **Present Sense Impression (Option A)**: This exception applies when a statement describes an event made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter. However, the pedestrian's statement was made in the emergency room after the accident, creating a time gap. Thus, it does not qualify as a present sense impression.

2. **Excited Utterance (Option I)**: This exception applies when a statement is made under the stress of a startling event. The pedestrian was in the emergency room being treated for his injuries, and it is reasonable to infer that he was still under the stress of the accident. Even though the statement was made in response to a nurse's question, the rules do not require complete spontaneityâ€”only that the statement was made under the stress of the event. Therefore, this statement likely qualifies as an excited utterance.

3. **Statement Against Interest (Option D)**: This exception applies when the statement is against the declarant's interest. Here, the pedestrian's statement is in his interest as the plaintiff, so this exception does not apply.

4. **Past or Present Mental State (Option H)**: This exception covers statements about the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. The pedestrian's statement describes the event rather than his mental state, so this exception does not apply.

5. **Other Considerations**: The fact that the pedestrian now has amnesia does not affect the admissibility of the statement, as the statement's admissibility depends on whether it fits a hearsay exception. The statement was made in the emergency room shortly after the accident, and the stress of the event likely persisted, making it admissible under the excited utterance exception.

After evaluating the options, the most appropriate exception is the excited utterance exception under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(2). The statement was made under the stress of the accident, and the fact that it was prompted by a question does not undermine its admissibility.
