Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. Alright, the question is about a non-inertial frame, specifically a freely falling elevator. Hmm, I remember that in physics, non-inertial frames are those that are accelerating, so the elevator here is in free fall, meaning it's accelerating downward.

The problem gives the acceleration of the non-inertial frame as a_O^† equals -g ŷ. Wait, ŷ is the unit vector pointing upward, right? So the acceleration is -g in the ŷ direction. That makes sense for a freely falling elevator because it's accelerating downward, which would be the negative direction if ŷ is up.

The question is asking about the net force on a mass M that's at rest in the elevator. So M is inside the elevator, which is in free fall. From the perspective of someone inside the elevator, what happens?

Wait, I remember something about apparent weight. When you're in a freely falling elevator, it feels like you're weightless. Because both you and the elevator are accelerating downward at g. So there's no normal force acting on you. So from the elevator's frame, which is non-inertial, there must be some pseudo-force involved.

But wait, the question is about the net force. So in an inertial frame, the net force on M would be Mg downward, because that's the only force acting on it—gravity. So the elevator and M are both in free fall, so M is in free fall too, meaning the net force is just gravity.

But wait, in the non-inertial frame (elevator's frame), there's a pseudo-force. Because the elevator is accelerating downward at g, the pseudo-force would be upward, right? Because in the non-inertial frame, objects appear to have a force acting opposite to the acceleration. So the pseudo-force would be M*a, which here is M*g upward.

So in the elevator's frame, the forces on M are gravity (Mg downward) and the pseudo-force (Mg upward). So the net force would be zero. That's why M feels weightless. But wait, the question is about the net force, not the apparent weight.

Wait, no, the question is phrased differently. It says, what's the net force acting on M at rest in the elevator. So in the inertial frame, M is in free fall, so net force is Mg downward. But from the elevator's perspective, since it's a non-inertial frame, the net force would be zero because the pseudo-force cancels the gravitational force.

Wait no, wait. The options are about the net force in the non-inertial frame, I think. Or are they asking from the inertial frame? The question is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's asking about the net force in the non-inertial frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the net force as experienced in the inertial frame. Let me think again.

From the inertial frame (like Earth's surface), the elevator is accelerating downward at g. So the mass M is also in free fall, so the net force on M is just its weight, Mg downward. So that would mean the net force is equal to its weight downward. Looking at the options, option D says M experiences a force equal to its weight downward. But wait, option E says M is weightless.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Because in the elevator's frame, M is at rest, so the net force would be zero. But from the Earth's frame, the net force is Mg downward. So the question is, which frame is being considered here?

The question says, "what is the net force acting on a mass M at rest in the elevator?" So M is at rest in the elevator, which is a non-inertial frame. So in the elevator's frame, M is stationary, so the net force is zero. But if we're considering the net force in the inertial frame, it's Mg downward.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about the net force acting on M. It doesn't specify the frame. Hmm. Oh wait, no, the question might be a bit tricky. Because in the non-inertial frame, you have to consider the pseudo-force. So the net force as observed in the elevator's frame would be zero, but the real forces (in the inertial frame) are just gravity.

Wait, but the options include E: M is weightless. Because in the elevator's frame, M feels weightless. So the net force in the elevator's frame is zero. So M is weightless.

Wait, but the question is about the net force. So if in the non-inertial frame, you have to add the pseudo-force. So the forces are gravity (Mg down) and the pseudo-force (Mg up), so net zero. So the net force is zero, making M feel weightless.

So the answer would then be E: M is weightless.

Looking at the options:

Option E: M is weightless.

So that's the correct answer.

The problem involves a freely falling elevator, which is a non-inertial frame of reference. The acceleration of this frame is given as \( \mathbf{a}_O^\dagger = -g \hat{y} \), where \( \hat{y} \) is the unit vector pointing upward, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. The question asks about the net force acting on a mass \( M \) that is at rest relative to the elevator.

In the inertial frame (e.g., the Earth's surface), the mass \( M \) is in free fall along with the elevator, and the only real force acting on \( M \) is gravity, which exerts a downward force of \( Mg \). However, the question is phrased in the context of the non-inertial frame of the elevator. In this frame, a pseudo-force must be considered to account for the elevator's acceleration. The pseudo-force acts upward with a magnitude \( Mg \), effectively canceling the gravitational force. As a result, the net force on \( M \) in the non-inertial frame is zero.

When the net force on \( M \) is zero in the non-inertial frame, \( M \) feels weightless. This is consistent with the experience of being in free fall, where there is no sensation of weight. Therefore, the correct answer is that \( M \) is weightless.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. \( M \) is not stationary relative to the Earth's surface; it is in free fall.
- **B**: Incorrect. While \( M \) is falling at the same rate as the elevator in the inertial frame, this does not describe the net force.
- **C**: Incorrect. \( M \) does not experience twice the gravitational force; the gravitational force is canceled by the pseudo-force.
- **D**: Incorrect. This describes the real force in the inertial frame but not the net force in the non-inertial frame.
- **E**: Correct. \( M \) is weightless in the non-inertial frame because the net force is zero.
- **F**: Incorrect. \( M \) is not accelerating upward; it is in free fall.
- **G**: Incorrect. \( M \) does not experience a force equal to its weight upward; the pseudo-force cancels gravity.
- **H**: Incorrect. The problem does not involve centrifugal forces due to Earth's rotation.
- **I**: Incorrect. \( M \) is not accelerating in the non-inertial frame; the net force is zero.
- **J**: Incorrect. \( M \) is not at constant velocity; it is in free fall.

The correct answer is **E: M is weightless**.
