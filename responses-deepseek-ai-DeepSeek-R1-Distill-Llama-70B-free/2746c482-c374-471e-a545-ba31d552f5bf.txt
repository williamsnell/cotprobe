Okay, I've got this problem here where I'm supposed to find the limit of a_n divided by n^3 as n approaches infinity. The problem gives me a_n as a sum from k=1 to n-1 of some trigonometric expression. Hmm, let's see... I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, let me write down what a_n is. So,

a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [ sin( (2k -1)π/(2n) ) / ( cos²( (k-1)π/(2n) ) * cos²( kπ/(2n) ) ) ]

Wow, that's a mouthful. I need to find the limit of a_n / n^3 as n → ∞. Since n is getting really big, maybe I can approximate the sum with an integral. Because for large n, sums can look like integrals. But first, I should try to simplify the expression inside the sum.

Let me look at each part. The numerator is sin( (2k-1)π/(2n) ). The denominator is the product of cos squared terms: cos²( (k-1)π/(2n) ) and cos²( kπ/(2n) ). 

Hmm, maybe I can manipulate the denominator first. Let's denote x = kπ/(2n). Then, (k-1)π/(2n) would be x - π/(2n). So, the denominator becomes cos²(x - π/(2n)) * cos²(x). But I'm not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I can expand the denominator using trig identities.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can rewrite the denominator in terms of a double angle or something. Let's recall that cos(A) * cos(B) can be expressed using sum formulas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to write the product of the two cos squared terms as something else.

Wait, let me think about the denominator:

Denominator D = [cos(a)]^2 * [cos(b)]^2, where a = (k-1)π/(2n) and b = kπ/(2n). Since b = a + π/(2n), right? Because (k)π/(2n) = (k-1)π/(2n) + π/(2n). So D = [cos(a)]^2 [cos(a + π/(2n))]^2.

That seems a bit tricky, but maybe for small angles, since n is large, π/(2n) is small. So when n is large, a is about something like x, and the difference between a and a+Δx (Δx small) can be approximated. But perhaps a better approach is to use a substitution to make the sum look like a Riemann sum, which I can then turn into an integral.

So, let's let x = k/n. Then, when n is large, x will range from 1/n to (n-1)/n, which is approximately 0 to 1 as n becomes large. So, x is roughly k/n, and as n → ∞, the sum becomes an integral over x from 0 to 1.

But let me see: in the sum, each term is for k from 1 to n-1. So, the variable substitution would be x = k/n, so k = n x, and as n becomes large, x is a continuous variable from 0 to 1.

Now, let's express each part of the term in terms of x.

First, the numerator: sin( (2k -1)π/(2n) ). Let me write this as sin( (2k π - π) / (2n) ). Which is sin( (k π / n) - π/(2n) ). Since k = n x, this becomes sin( x π - π/(2n) ). As n becomes large, π/(2n) is negligible, so approximately sin(x π). But wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me write it as sin( x π - δ ), where δ = π/(2n). Using the identity sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B. So,

sin(x π - δ) ≈ sin(x π) cos δ - cos(x π) sin δ.

But for small δ, cos δ ≈ 1 - δ²/2 and sin δ ≈ δ. So,

≈ sin(x π) * (1 - δ²/2) - cos(x π) * δ.

But δ = π/(2n), which goes to zero as n → ∞, so the terms with δ² and δ can be neglected in the leading order. So, the numerator approximates to sin(x π).

Wait, but maybe I should keep terms to higher order because when I take the sum and turn it into an integral, perhaps the corrections will matter. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand in terms of 1/n and see which terms contribute to the leading behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a substitution to simplify the expression.

Let me look back at the denominator. The denominator is [cos(a)]^2 [cos(b)]^2, where a = (k-1)π/(2n) and b = kπ/(2n). Let me define h = π/(2n), so a = (k-1) h and b = k h. So, denominator is [cos( (k-1) h )]^2 [cos(k h)]^2.

Wait, perhaps there's a telescoping nature here. Maybe the denominator can be expressed in terms of a product that can telescope when summed. Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities to write the denominator in another form.

Wait, another idea: perhaps write 1 / [cos^2(a) cos^2(b)] as [1/cos^2(a) ] * [1/cos^2(b) ].

But 1/cos^2(a) is sec^2(a), and the derivative of tan(a) is sec^2(a), so maybe integrating something related to tan(a) could help. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can write the denominator as [cos(a) cos(b)]^2. So, [cos(a) cos(b)]^2. Let me compute cos(a) cos(b). Using the product identity:

cos a cos b = [cos(a+b) + cos(a-b)] / 2.

So, [cos(a) cos(b)]^2 = [ (cos(a+b) + cos(a-b)) / 2 ]^2 = [cos(a+b)^2 + 2 cos(a+b) cos(a-b) + cos(a-b)^2 ] / 4.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the entire term in the sum as a function and see if we can find a telescoping behavior.

Wait, let me think about the entire term: numerator over denominator.

So, the term is:

sin( (2k -1)π/(2n) ) / [ cos^2( (k-1)π/(2n) ) cos^2( kπ/(2n) ) ]

Let me denote theta_k = kπ/(2n). Then, (k-1)π/(2n) = theta_{k} - π/(2n) = theta_k - h, where h = π/(2n). So, the denominator becomes [ cos(theta_k - h) cos(theta_k) ]^2.

The numerator is sin( (2k -1) π/(2n) ). Let's compute (2k -1) π/(2n) = (2 theta_k - π/(2n) ), since theta_k = kπ/(2n). So,

sin(2 theta_k - π/(2n)).

Again, using the identity for sin(A - B), but perhaps I can relate this to derivatives or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as sin(2 theta_k - h), where h is small.

Wait, perhaps I can express the numerator in terms of derivatives of the denominator terms. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a telescoping sum approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps express the term as a difference involving tan(theta) or something similar. Because 1/cos^2(theta) is the derivative of tan(theta), so maybe I can find an expression that when summed telescopes.

Wait, let's think about the denominator. Let me compute [cos(theta_k - h) * cos(theta_k)]^2. Let me expand that:

cos(theta_k - h) * cos(theta_k) = [cos(theta_k) cos h + sin(theta_k) sin h ] * cos(theta_k)
= cos^2(theta_k) cos h + sin(theta_k) cos(theta_k) sin h.

Hmm, but squaring this would give terms up to h^2, which might complicate things. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as [cos(theta_k - h) cos(theta_k)]^2 = [ (cos(theta_k - h) cos(theta_k) ) ]^2, and expand the product inside.

Wait, using the identity for cos(A - h) cos A:

cos(A - h) cos A = [cos(A) cos h + sin(A) sin h] * cos A
= cos^2 A cos h + sin A cos A sin h.

Hmm, not sure if that's useful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as [cos(theta_k - h) cos(theta_k)]^2 and see if I can relate it to something else.

Wait, perhaps using the identity for cos(A) cos(B) again. So,

cos(theta_k - h) cos(theta_k) = [cos(2 theta_k - h) + cos(h)] / 2.

So, [cos(theta_k - h) cos(theta_k)]^2 = [ (cos(2 theta_k - h) + cos h)/2 ]^2.

Hmm, but I'm not seeing a clear path forward with that.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to manipulate the denominator, I should look at the entire term and see if it can be expressed as a difference of something, leading to a telescoping sum.

Let me define f(k) as some function such that f(k) - f(k-1) equals the term in the sum. If I can find such an f(k), then the sum from k=1 to n-1 would telescope to f(n) - f(0), or something similar.

So, suppose the term is f(k) - f(k-1). Then, the sum would be sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [f(k) - f(k-1)] = f(n-1) - f(0).

If I can find f(k) such that this holds, then the sum a_n would be f(n-1) - f(0). Then, taking the limit as n→infty, perhaps f(n-1) would go to a finite value or something that I can compute.

So, let me see. Let me try to express the term as a difference.

Looking for f(k) such that:

f(k) - f(k-1) = sin( (2k -1)π/(2n) ) / [ cos^2( (k-1)π/(2n) ) cos^2( kπ/(2n) ) ]

Hmm, maybe f(k) can involve tan(theta_k), because the denominator has cos^2 terms, and the derivative of tan is 1/cos^2.

Wait, let's try f(k) = something involving tan(theta_k).

Let me compute f(k) - f(k-1) where f(k) = A tan(theta_k) + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.

Then, f(k) - f(k-1) = A [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1})]

Let me compute this difference:

tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1}) = [sin(theta_k)/cos(theta_k)] - [sin(theta_{k-1})/cos(theta_{k-1})]

= [sin(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1}) - sin(theta_{k-1}) cos(theta_k)] / [cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1})]

The numerator is sin(theta_k - theta_{k-1}) because sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B. So, theta_k - theta_{k-1} = π/(2n). So, numerator is sin( π/(2n) ).

Therefore,

tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1}) = sin( π/(2n) ) / [cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1}) ]

Hmm, interesting. So, if I set A = 1, then f(k) - f(k-1) = sin(π/(2n)) / [ cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1}) ]

But our term in the sum is [ sin( (2k -1)π/(2n) ) ] / [ cos^2(theta_{k-1}) cos^2(theta_k) ]

So, comparing, our term is sin( (2k-1)π/(2n) ) divided by [ cos^2(theta_{k-1}) cos^2(theta_k) ].

So, maybe I can relate this to [f(k) - f(k-1)]^2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the expression to involve [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1})]^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let me think. The denominator in our term is [cos(theta_{k-1}) cos(theta_k)]^2, so that's [cos(theta_{k-1}) cos(theta_k)] squared. 

From what I found earlier, tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1}) = sin(h) / [cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1})], where h = π/(2n).

So, [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1})] = sin h / [cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1}) ]

So, [cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1})] = sin h / [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1}) ]

But in the denominator of our term, we have [cos(theta_{k-1}) cos(theta_k)]^2, which would be [sin h]^2 / [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1})]^2.

Hmm, so perhaps the denominator can be expressed as [sin h]^2 / [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1})]^2. 

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Let me think about the numerator in the term.

The numerator is sin( (2k -1)π/(2n) ). Let me express this in terms of theta_k. Since theta_k = kπ/(2n), then 2kπ/(2n) = kπ/n. So,

(2k -1)π/(2n) = (kπ/n) - π/(2n) = theta_k * 2 - π/(2n) (since theta_k = kπ/(2n), so 2 theta_k = kπ/n). So,

sin(2 theta_k - π/(2n)).

Hmm, maybe I can write this as sin(2 theta_k - h), where h=π/(2n). Using the sine subtraction formula:

sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B.

So,

sin(2 theta_k - h) = sin(2 theta_k) cos h - cos(2 theta_k) sin h.

But I don't know if that helps yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to derivatives or other trigonometric identities.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I can express the entire term as a multiple of [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1})]^2, or something similar. Or maybe as a difference involving tan(theta_k) and tan(theta_{k-1}).

Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire term as a difference involving higher derivatives. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me go back to the expression for the term:

term = sin(2 theta_k - h) / [ cos^2(theta_{k-1}) cos^2(theta_k) ]

I can write this as [sin(2 theta_k - h)] / [ (cos(theta_{k-1}) cos(theta_k))^2 ]

From earlier, I have that:

tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1}) = sin h / (cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1}) )

So, (cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1})) = sin h / (tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1}) )

So, [cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1})]^2 = [sin h]^2 / [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1})]^2

Thus, 1/[cos(theta_k) cos(theta_{k-1})]^2 = [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1})]^2 / [sin h]^2.

So, substituting back into the term, we get:

term = sin(2 theta_k - h) * [tan(theta_k) - tan(theta_{k-1})]^2 / [sin h]^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider expanding sin(2 theta_k - h) in terms of sin(2 theta_k) and so on.

Wait, let me try to think differently. Since n is large, maybe I can approximate the sum as an integral and then evaluate it. So, let's define x = k/n, so when n is large, x varies from 0 to 1 in steps of 1/n. Then, each term in the sum is approximately f(x) * (1/n), so the sum a_n would be approximately n ∫ f(x) dx, because sum_{k} f(k/n) * (1/n) ≈ ∫ f(x) dx, and a_n is the sum of terms each of order (1/n^3), but wait, let me check.

Wait, let's see:

Each term in a_n is of the form sin(...) / [cos^2(...) cos^2(...)].

Let me try to approximate each term for large n. Since h = π/(2n) is small, and theta_k = kπ/(2n) is also small when k is not too large compared to n, but when k is of order n, theta_k approaches π/2.

Wait, but when n is large, and k varies from 1 to n-1, then theta_k varies from π/(2n) to (n-1)π/(2n) ≈ π/2 - π/(2n). So, as n→infty, theta_k ranges from near 0 to near π/2.

So, let me write each term in terms of x = k/n, so theta_k = (k
