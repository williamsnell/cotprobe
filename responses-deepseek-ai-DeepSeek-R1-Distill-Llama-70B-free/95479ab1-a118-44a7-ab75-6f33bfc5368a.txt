Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the critical angle for electromagnetic waves passing from certain dielectrics into air. The materials given are distilled water and glass, with their permittivity ratios.

Hmm, right, I remember that the critical angle is the angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs. So when light tries to go from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower, it can't pass beyond that critical angle. But wait, I think the critical angle formula is related to the refractive indices of the two materials.

Wait, the formula for the critical angle, I think, is sin(theta_c) equals the ratio of the refractive index of the second medium to the first. Oh wait, no, wait. Because when going from medium 1 to medium 2, if n2 < n1, then the critical angle is when sin(theta_c) = n2/n1. But in this case, the question says the wave is passing into air. So air is the second medium, right?

So, the first medium is either distilled water or glass. Let's think about their permittivities. The problem gives the ratio of their permittivity to that of air as epsilon/epsilon_0. Oh, but wait, I thought the refractive index n is related to the square root of the relative permittivity (epsilon_r). So n = sqrt(epsilon_r), where epsilon_r is epsilon/epsilon_0.

So for distilled water, the ratio is 81.1. That means n_water = sqrt(81.1). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(81) is 9, so sqrt(81.1) is a little more than 9, maybe around 9.005 or something? But for the sake of calculation, maybe it's exactly 9. Because 9 squared is 81, so 9.005 squared is about 81.09, which is close to 81.1. So I'll approximate n_water as 9.

Similarly, for glass, the ratio is 9. So n_glass is sqrt(9) which is 3. Got it.

Now, air has a refractive index of approximately 1. So when the wave is going from water to air, the refractive indices are n1 = 9 (water) and n2 = 1 (air). So the critical angle theta_c would be when sin(theta_c) = n2/n1 = 1/9.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Because when light is going from a higher refractive index to a lower, the critical angle is when sin(theta_c) = n2/n1. So in this case, n2 is air (1), n1 is the material. So yes, sin(theta_c) is 1/9 for water and 1/3 for glass.

So for water: sin(theta_c) = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111. What's the angle whose sine is approximately 0.1111? I think that's around 6.4 degrees or so. Let me think. Because sin(6 degrees) is about 0.1045, and sin(6.3) is about 0.11. Oh wait, wait, no, wait—sin(6.3) is approximately 0.11, right? Let me double-check.

Wait, let me think. Sin(6 degrees) is roughly 0.1045, and each degree adds about 0.017 radians, but in terms of sine, the approximate for small angles is sin(theta) ≈ theta in radians. So 0.1111 radians is about 6.36 degrees. So that's roughly 6.3 degrees. So the critical angle for distilled water would be approximately 6.3 degrees.

Wait, but wait—when the wave is going from water to air, the critical angle is the angle in the denser medium (water) beyond which total internal reflection occurs. So the angle is measured in the water.

Now, for glass, the refractive index is 3. So sin(theta_c) = n_air / n_glass = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. What's the angle whose sine is 0.3333? That's approximately 19.47 degrees, which rounds to about 19.5 degrees. So the critical angle for glass would be about 19.5 degrees.

Wait, but I thought when going from glass to air, which has a lower refractive index, so yes, total internal reflection occurs beyond that angle.

Now, looking at the options. Let's see. The options are for each material. The first value is for distilled water, the second for glass.

Option A: 9 and 81.1 degrees. That doesn't make sense, because we have 6.3 and 19.5.

Option B: 6.3 for water, 19.4 for glass. Oh, wait, that's exactly what we calculated. So option B would have 6.3 for water and 19.4 for glass.

Wait, but let me check the other options to be sure.

Option C: 81 and 9. No, that's reversed.

Option D: 73 and 30. No, that's higher than what we calculated.

Option E: 20 and 6.3. That's the reverse of what we have.

Option F: 48.6 and 42.1. No.

Option G: 25 and 89. No.

Option H: 33 and 14. No.

Option I: 13.2 and 25.8. No.

Option J: 58 and 22. No.

So the correct option is B: 6.3 degrees for distilled water, 19.4 degrees for glass.

To calculate the critical angle for an electromagnetic wave passing from a dielectric into air, we use the formula:

\[
\sin(\theta_c) = \frac{n_2}{n_1}
\]

where \( n_1 \) is the refractive index of the dielectric, \( n_2 \) is the refractive index of air (approximately 1), and \( \theta_c \) is the critical angle. The refractive index \( n \) is related to the relative permittivity \( \epsilon_r = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0} \) by:

\[
n = \sqrt{\epsilon_r}
\]

### For Distilled Water:
- The relative permittivity of distilled water is \( \epsilon_r = 81.1 \), so:
  \[
  n_{\text{water}} = \sqrt{81.1} \approx 9
  \]
- Substituting into the critical angle formula:
  \[
  \sin(\theta_c) = \frac{n_{\text{air}}}{n_{\text{water}}} = \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.1111
  \]
- The angle whose sine is approximately 0.1111 is:
  \[
  \theta_c \approx 6.3^\circ
  \]

### For Glass:
- The relative permittivity of glass is \( \epsilon_r = 9 \), so:
  \[
  n_{\text{glass}} = \sqrt{9} = 3
  \]
- Substituting into the critical angle formula:
  \[
  \sin(\theta_c) = \frac{n_{\text{air}}}{n_{\text{glass}}} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333
  \]
- The angle whose sine is approximately 0.3333 is:
  \[
  \theta_c \approx 19.4^\circ
  \]

### Evaluating the Options:
- **Option A:** 9° for water, 81.1° for glass — Incorrect, as the calculated values are 6.3° for water and 19.4° for glass.
- **Option B:** 6.3° for water, 19.4° for glass — Correct, matches the calculated values.

- **Option H:** 33° for water, 14° for glass — Incorrect, does not match the calculated values.
- **Option I:** 13.2° for water, 25.8° for glass — Incorrect, does not match the calculated values.
- **Option J:** 58° for water, 22° for glass — Incorrect, much higher than the calculated values.
