Okay, so I've got this math problem here about finding the volume of a cube. The formula given is V equals s cubed, where s is the side length. The question is asking for the volume when the side length is 2.3 centimeters. Hmm, sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure I do this right.

Alright, so I know that the volume of a cube is calculated by taking the side length and multiplying it by itself three times. So for this, it's 2.3 cm. Let me write that down: V = (2.3)^3. 

Wait, how do I compute 2.3 cubed? Let me think. 2.3 cubed is 2.3 multiplied by 2.3 multiplied by 2.3. Maybe I should break it down step by step.

First, I'll calculate 2.3 times 2.3. Let's see, 2 times 2 is 4. Then 2 times 0.3 is 0.6, and 0.3 times 2 is another 0.6. Oh wait, that's the FOIL method for multiplying two binomials. So (2 + 0.3) times (2 + 0.3) is 2*2 + 2*0.3 + 0.3*2 + 0.3*0.3. That adds up to 4 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.09. Adding those together: 4 + 1.2 is 5.2, plus 0.09 makes 5.29. So 2.3 squared is 5.29.

Now, I need to multiply that result by 2.3 again because it's the cube. So 5.29 times 2.3. Hmm, let's do this multiplication step by step. Maybe I can break it down.

First, 5 times 2.3 is 11.5. Then, 0.29 times 2.3. Let me calculate that. 0.2 times 2.3 is 0.46, and 0.09 times 2.3 is 0.207. Adding those together gives 0.46 + 0.207 = 0.667. Now add that to the 11.5: 11.5 + 0.667 = 12.167.

Wait a minute, that gives me 12.167, but that's not one of the options here. Let me check the options again. The options are A:14.2, B:6.9, C:7.429, D:5.29, E:12.167, F:4.3, G:8.027, H:10.493, I:6.839, J:9.261.

Oh, wait, option E is 12.167. So that's the one I got. But wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do math in my head, I might slip up.

Let me recalculate 2.3 cubed. Maybe a better approach is to write it as (2 + 0.3)^3. Using the binomial expansion formula, (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3.

So here, a is 2 and b is 0.3. Let's compute each term:

a^3 = 8.

3a^2b = 3*(4)*(0.3) = 3*1.2 = 3.6.

3ab^2 = 3*(2)*(0.09) = 3*0.18 = 0.54.

b^3 = 0.027.

Adding all these together: 8 + 3.6 is 11.6, plus 0.54 is 12.14, plus 0.027 gives 12.167. So yes, that's correct. So the volume is 12.167 cubic centimeters, which matches option E.

Wait, but I thought the options might not have that. Let me check again. The options are A to J, and E is 12.167. So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider if I'm supposed to round the answer. Let me see the possible options. 12.167 is exact, so I think that's the right choice.

The volume of a cube is calculated using the formula \( V = s^3 \), where \( s \) is the side length. For a cube with a side length of 2.3 cm, the volume is:

\[
V = (2.3)^3
\]

First, calculate \( 2.3 \times 2.3 \), which equals 5.29. Then, multiply this result by 2.3:

\[
5.29 \times 2.3 = 12.167
\]

This matches option E. To verify, the binomial expansion of \( (2 + 0.3)^3 \) was used, confirming the result:

\[
(2 + 0.3)^3 = 2^3 + 3(2^2)(0.3) + 3(2)(0.3^2) + 0.3^3 = 8 + 3.6 + 0.54 + 0.027 = 12.167
\]

Thus, the volume of the cube is **12.167 cubic centimeters**, corresponding to option E.
