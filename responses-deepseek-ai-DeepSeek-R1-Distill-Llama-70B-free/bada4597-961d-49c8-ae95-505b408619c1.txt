Okay, so I have this physics question here about an ideal gas expanding according to the law pV² = constant. The question is whether the gas gets hotter or colder when it expands. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that for ideal gases, the state is determined by the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. So, pressure times volume equals n times R times T. But here, the situation is different because the process follows pV² = constant. That's not the usual PV^gamma = constant that I'm familiar with, like in isothermal or adiabatic processes.

Wait, in an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant because PV = constant. But here, it's pV squared equals a constant. So the process is different. I think I need to figure out how temperature changes when the gas expands under this condition.

Let me consider the process. Let's say the gas expands, so volume V increases. The equation is pV² = constant. If V increases, then p must decrease because p is proportional to 1/V². So p decreases as V increases.

Now, using the ideal gas law, T is related to PV. So if p is dropping as V increases, what happens to T? Let's express T in terms of p and V. From PV = nRT, T = PV/(nR). So, as V increases, and p decreases, how does their product PV change?

Wait, since p is proportional to 1/V², let's substitute that. Let's say p = k / V², where k is the constant. Then, T = (k/V²) * V / (nR) ) = k/(V n R). So T is inversely proportional to V. That means as V increases, T decreases. So the temperature should drop as the gas expands.

So when the gas expands under pV² = constant, it gets colder. So looking at the options, option I says 'colder'. That must be the correct answer.

Wait a second, but why isn't it dependent on anything else? The question is about an ideal gas, so the type shouldn't matter. So option H says the change depends on the gas type, but I don't think that's the case here. Because in an ideal gas, the behavior is determined by the process, not the specific gas. So I think my earlier conclusion holds.

Another way to think about it: The process equation is pV² = C. Let's express T in terms of V. From the ideal gas law, p = nRT/V. Substitute into the process equation:

(nRT/V) * V² = C → nRT V = C → T = C/(nRV). So as V increases, T decreases. Yep, that confirms it.

So the gas gets colder when it expands under this process. So the answer should be I: colder.

To determine whether an ideal gas gets hotter or colder when it expands according to the law \( pV^2 = \text{Const} \), we analyze the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature.

1. **Process Equation**: The process is governed by \( pV^2 = \text{Const} \). This implies that as the volume \( V \) increases, the pressure \( p \) decreases proportionally to \( 1/V^2 \).

2. **Ideal Gas Law**: From the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), temperature \( T \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   T = \frac{PV}{nR}.
   \]

3. **Substitute \( p \) from the Process Equation**: Since \( p = \frac{\text{Const}}{V^2} \), substituting into the expression for \( T \) gives:
   \[
   T = \frac{\left(\frac{\text{Const}}{V^2}\right)V}{nR} = \frac{\text{Const}}{nRV}.
   \]
   This shows that \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( V \).

4. **Conclusion**: As the volume \( V \) increases during expansion, the temperature \( T \) decreases. Therefore, the gas gets colder when it expands under the given process.

5. **Evaluation of Options**: Among the options provided, only option \( I \) ("colder") correctly describes the behavior of the gas. Other options, such as temperature remaining constant, oscillating, or depending on the gas type, are inconsistent with the analysis.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: colder**
