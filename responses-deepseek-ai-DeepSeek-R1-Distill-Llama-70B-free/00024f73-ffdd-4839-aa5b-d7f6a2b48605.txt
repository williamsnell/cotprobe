Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the resistance of a copper coil changing with temperature. Hmm, I remember something about temperature coefficients and how resistance varies with temperature. Let me think.

The problem says the coil has a resistance of 100 ohms at 20°C. The temperature coefficient for copper is given as 0.0038 ohm per ohm per degree Celsius. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the temperature coefficient of resistivity (usually denoted as α) tells us how much the resistance changes per degree change in temperature. Or was it per kelvin? Oh, same thing in this case since we're dealing with Celsius degrees.

So the formula I think I should use is R = R0 [1 + α(T - T0)], where R0 is the resistance at temperature T0, and T is the new temperature. Or wait, is there another formula? Oh wait, sometimes it's written as R = R0 * (1 + αΔT), where ΔT is the change in temperature. Yeah, that makes sense.

Let me plug in the numbers. R0 is 100 ohms. T0 is 20°C, and T is 50°C. So the change in temperature ΔT is 50 - 20 = 30°C. The temperature coefficient α is 0.0038 per ohm per degree Celsius.

Wait, wait, per ohm? Or is it per ohm per degree? Oh, right, the unit is (ohm per ohm per degree Celsius), which simplifies to 1/°C. So α is unitless? Or is it per degree?

Wait, no, actually, the temperature coefficient of resistivity is usually given as per degree Celsius. So for every degree increase, the resistance increases by a fraction of its original value. So the formula should work as R = R0 (1 + α (T - T0)).

So substituting, R = 100 * (1 + 0.0038 * 30). Let me calculate that. 0.0038 times 30 is... let's see, 0.0038 * 30 = 0.114. So 1 + 0.114 is 1.114. Multiply by 100 gives 111.4 ohms. 

Looking at the options, option H is 111 ohms, which is the closest. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh wait, no, the calculation gives 111.4, which is approximately 111. So yes, H. But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, 0.0038 * 30. Let me calculate again. 0.0038 * 10 is 0.038, so times 3 is 0.114. Yep. So 100 * 1.114 is 111.4, which is 111 when rounded to the nearest whole number. So yes, that's correct.

To determine the resistance of the copper coil at 50°C, we use the formula for temperature-dependent resistance:

\[
R = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)]
\]

Here:
- \( R_0 = 100 \, \Omega \) (resistance at 20°C),
- \( \alpha = 0.0038 \, \text{°C}^{-1} \) (temperature coefficient of resistivity for copper),
- \( T_0 = 20 \, \text{°C} \),
- \( T = 50 \, \text{°C} \).

First, calculate the temperature change:

\[
\Delta T = T - T_0 = 50 - 20 = 30 \, \text{°C}.
\]

Next, calculate the resistance at 50°C:

\[
R = 100 \times [1 + (0.0038 \times 30)].
\]

Simplify:

\[
0.0038 \times 30 = 0.114, \quad 1 + 0.114 = 1.114.
\]

Thus:

\[
R = 100 \times 1.114 = 111.4 \, \Omega.
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the resistance is approximately \( 111 \, \Omega \). Among the given options, the closest value is **H: 111 ohms**.

Answer: H
