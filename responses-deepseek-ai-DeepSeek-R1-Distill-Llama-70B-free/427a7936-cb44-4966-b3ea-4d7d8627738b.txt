Okay, so I've got this question about fluid mechanics, specifically dealing with boundary layers and drag force on a flat plate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem gives a flat plate that's 1.5 ft long and 5 ft wide. It's placed in a stream of water flowing at 45 ft/s, and the flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side. So the plate's length in the direction of flow is 1.5 ft, I think. Wait, actually, no. Wait, when the flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side, that means the length over which the flow occurs is 5 ft, right? Because the plate is 5 ft wide, so the flow is along the 5 ft length. Or am I getting this mixed up?

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The plate is placed such that the flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side. So the length of the plate in the flow direction is 5 ft. Because the 5 ft side is the one the flow is along. So the plate's length, L, is 5 ft, and the width is 1.5 ft. Because the flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side, meaning the 1.5 ft is the length in the flow direction. Wait, no, maybe I had it backwards. Let me think about it again.

Wait, when the flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side, that means the flow is moving along the 1.5 ft length. So the plate's length in the flow direction is 1.5 ft, and the width is 5 ft. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I think I need to get this straight because it affects the calculations.

The question has four parts: a, b, c, d. Let's tackle part (a) first.

Part (a): Boundary layer thickness at the trailing edge.

So for boundary layer thickness, I remember the formula for a flat plate in laminar flow. The boundary layer thickness δ at a distance x from the leading edge is given by:

δ = (5 * ν * x) / (u * Re_x^(1/2)))

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is δ = (5 * ν * x)^(1/2) / (u * sqrt(Re_x)) ), but I think I'm mixing this up. Wait, let's recall the Blasius solution for laminar flow over a flat plate.

The boundary layer thickness at a distance x is given by δ = (4.96 * x) / sqrt(Re_x), where Re_x is the Reynolds number at x, which is (u * x)/ν.

Wait, no, I think the formula is δ = (5 * ν * x) / (u * sqrt(Re_x)), but maybe I should write it correctly.

Wait, the correct formula is δ = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x), where Re_x = (u x)/ν. So that would make δ proportional to x^(1/2).

So let's compute Re_x first. Since the flow is along the 1.5 ft side, x is 1.5 ft. Wait, but the question says the plate is 1.5 ft long and 5 ft wide. So if the flow is along the 1.5 ft side, then the length in the flow direction is 1.5 ft. So x is 1.5 ft.

Wait, but part (a) is about the trailing edge, which is at x = L, which would be 1.5 ft. So the boundary layer thickness at x = 1.5 ft.

Wait, but wait, the plate's dimensions are length 1.5 ft and width 5 ft. So when the flow is along the 1.5 ft side, the plate is placed such that it's 1.5 ft in the flow direction. So the entire length is 1.5 ft, so the trailing edge is at x = 1.5 ft.

But then, when calculating Re_x, x is 1.5 ft. So we can compute Re = (u * x)/ν.

Wait, what's the kinematic viscosity of water? I remember that at 20°C, water has ν ≈ 1.004e-5 ft²/s. Wait, maybe I should confirm that value. Alternatively, sometimes ν is given as 1.08e-5 ft²/s, but I think 1.0e-5 is a common approximation.

So let's proceed. Given u = 45 ft/s, x = 1.5 ft, ν = 1.0e-5 ft²/s.

So Re_x = (45 * 1.5) / (1e-5) = (67.5) / (1e-5) = 6.75e5.

Wait, 45*1.5 is 67.5, right? So 67.5 divided by 1e-5 is 6,750,000, which is 6.75e6? Wait wait, wait: 1e-5 is 0.00001, so 67.5 / 0.00001 = 6,750,000, which is 6.75e6. So Re_x is 6.75e6.

Then, δ = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x).

So x is 1.5 ft.

So 4.96 * 1.5 = 7.44.

sqrt(Re_x) = sqrt(6.75e6) ≈ 2598.07.

So δ ≈ 7.44 / 2598.07 ≈ approx 0.00286 ft. Wait, that's about 0.00286 ft, which is 0.0343 inches. Hmm, but looking at the answer options, the a) options are in the range of 0.022 to 0.032 ft, so 0.00286 ft is 0.0286 ft? Wait, wait, no, 0.00286 ft is 0.0343 inches, which is about 0.00286 ft. But none of the options for part a are that low. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe I forgot that the formula is δ = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x) when Re_x is based on x. So with Re_x = 6.75e6, sqrt(Re_x) is sqrt(6.75e6) = sqrt(6.75)*1e3 = approx 2.598*1e3 = 2598. So 4.96 * 1.5 = 7.44, divided by 2598 is about 0.00286 ft, which is 0.0286 inches. Wait, that's 0.00286 ft, which is 0.0286 inches. But the answer options for a) are in the 0.02 to 0.03 ft range, which is 0.24 to 0.36 inches. Hmm, I'm getting 0.00286 ft, which is 0.0286 inches, which is 0.0286 ft? Wait no, wait, 1 ft is 12 inches, so 0.00286 ft is 0.0343 inches, which is about 0.0286 ft? Wait, that can't be right because 0.00286 ft is 0.0343 inches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Re_x = (45 ft/s * 1.5 ft) / (1e-5 ft²/s) = (67.5) / (1e-5) = 6,750,000, which is 6.75e6. So sqrt(Re_x) is sqrt(6.75e6) = sqrt(6.75)*1e3. sqrt(6.25)=2.5, and sqrt(6.75)=approx 2.598. So 2.598e3.

Then, δ = (4.96 * 1.5) / (2.598e3) = (7.44) / 2598 ≈ 0.00286 ft, which is 0.0286 inches. Wait, but that's 0.00286 ft, which is 0.0286 inches. None of the options match this. The options for a) are from 0.022 ft (0.264 in) up to 0.032 ft (0.384 in). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating x? Because maybe I used the wrong x.

Wait, the question says the plate is 1.5 ft long and 5 ft wide, and the flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side. So the length of the plate in the flow direction is 5 ft? Wait no, no, if the flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side, then the plate's length in the flow direction is 1.5 ft, and the width is 5 ft. So x is 1.5 ft. So I think I did that right.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Another formula I recall is δ = (5 ν x)/(u sqrt(Re_x)). Wait, let me check that.

Alternatively, δ can be expressed as (5 ν x / u)^(1/2) divided by sqrt(Re_x). Hmm, maybe I should use the formula correctly.

Wait, the correct formula for the boundary layer thickness in laminar flow is δ = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x).

So I think I did that right. So perhaps the answers are using a different kinematic viscosity. Maybe ν is 1.2e-5 ft²/s instead of 1e-5. Let me check that. Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use ν = 1.2e-5 ft²/s. Let me recalculate with that.

So ν = 1.2e-5 ft²/s.

Re_x = (45 * 1.5) / (1.2e-5) = 67.5 / 1.2e-5 ≈ 5.625e6.

sqrt(Re_x) = sqrt(5.625e6) ≈ 2372.58.

Then δ = (4.96 * 1.5) / 2372.58 ≈ 7.44 / 2372.58 ≈ 0.00313 ft, which is about 0.0376 inches, or 0.00313 ft, which is 0.00313 ft, but that's still lower than the options given.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the flow isn't entirely laminar. Wait, part (b) mentions that the laminar boundary layer ends at Re = 5e5, so perhaps for part (a), it's still in the laminar region, so that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the given flow is along the 5 ft length. So perhaps I'm miscalculating x. Let me think again: if the flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side, then the plate is placed such that the 5 ft is the length in the flow direction. So x would be 5 ft, and the width is 1.5 ft. So that would make more sense, perhaps, given the answer options.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the dimensions wrong. Let me re-read the problem.

The plate is 1.5 ft long and 5 ft wide. The flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side. So the plate's length in the flow direction is 5 ft because the width is 5 ft. So the plate is 5 ft long in the direction of flow, and 1.5 ft wide.

Wait, that can't be right, because the plate is flat, so the length and width are the dimensions. So when the flow is parallel to the 1.5 ft side, the flow is along the 1.5 ft length, so x is 1.5 ft. But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with x = 1.5 ft.

Wait, perhaps the answer options are using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (5 ν x)/(u sqrt(Re_x)), which would be different.

Wait, let me think again. The Blasius solution gives δ = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x), where Re_x = (u x)/ν.

Alternatively, another expression could be in terms of the Reynolds number. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this again carefully.

Given u = 45 ft/s, x = 1.5 ft, ν = 1.0e-5 ft²/s.

Re_x = (45 * 1.5) / 1e-5 = 67.5 / 1e-5 = 6.75e5? Wait, no, 6.75e5 is 675,000, but 67.5 / 1e-5 is 6,750,000, which is 6.75e6.

So Re_x = 6.75e6.

Then, δ = (4.96 * 1.5) / sqrt(6.75e6) = (7.44) / (2598.07) ≈ 0.00286 ft.

So 0.00286 ft is about 0.0286 inches.

Wait, but the options for part a) are all around 0.022 to 0.03 ft, which is 0.264 inches to 0.36 inches, so 0.0286 is about 0.0286 ft, which is 0.0286 *12= 0.343 inches.

Wait, 0.00286 ft is 0.0343 inches, but that's 0.00286 ft. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in decimal places.

Wait, 0.00286 ft is 0.0343 inches, which is 0.0286 ft? Wait no, 0.00286 ft is 0.00286 *12= 0.0343 inches, which is 0.0286 ft? No, wait, 0.00286 ft is 0.00286 *12 inches, which is 0.0343 inches, which is 0.00286 ft.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, another formula I found is δ = (5 ν x) / (u sqrt(Re_x)).

Wait, let's try that. So δ = (5 * ν * x) / (u * sqrt(Re_x)).

But Re_x is (u x)/ν, so substituting that in, we get:

δ = (5 ν x) / (u * sqrt( (u x)/ν )) )

Simplify the denominator: sqrt( (u x)/ν ) = sqrt(u x / ν) = (u x / ν)^(1/2).

So denominator = u * (u x / ν)^(1/2) = u^(3/2) x^(1/2) ν^(-1/2).

So the numerator is 5 ν x.

So putting it together:

δ = [5 ν x ] / [u^(3/2) x^(1/2) ν^(-1/2)] ]

Simplify exponents:

ν in numerator: ν^1

Denominator: ν^(-1/2)

So overall, ν^(1 + 1/2) = ν^(3/2).

x in numerator: x^1

Denominator: x^(1/2)

So x^(1 - 1/2) = x^(1/2).

u: denominator is u^(3/2), numerator has no u, so u^(-3/2).

So overall:

δ = 5 * ν^(3/2) x^(1/2) / u^(3/2)

Which can be written as δ = 5 * (ν x / u^2)^(1/2).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute using the original formula.

Wait, let me try plugging in the values:

ν = 1e-5 ft²/s

x = 1.5 ft

u = 45 ft/s

Re_x = (45 * 1.5) / 1e-5 = 6.75e6.

Then, using δ = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x) = (4.96 * 1.5) / sqrt(6.75e6).

Compute numerator: 4.96 * 1.5 = 7.44.

Compute denominator: sqrt(6.75e6) = sqrt(6.75)*1e3 = 2.598 * 1e3 = 2598.

So δ = 7.44 / 2598 ≈ 0.00286 ft, which is 0.00286 ft.

Wait, 0.00286 ft is 0.0343 inches, which is about 0.0286 ft? No, that's not right. Wait, no, 0.00286 ft is 0.0343 inches because 0.00286*12=0.0343 inches. So 0.00286 ft is about 0.0286 inches.

Wait, but the options for part a) are much higher. For example, option B is a) 0.0257 ft, which is 0.3096 inches, which is much larger than my calculation. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula for the boundary layer thickness. Oh wait, I think I remember that the formula I used is for the displacement thickness, but no, the Blasius solution gives the boundary layer thickness as δ = (4.96 x)/sqrt(Re_x).

Wait, perhaps I should check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Since Re_x is 6.75e6, which is greater than the critical Reynolds number of about 5e5, so the flow is turbulent.

Wait, but part (a) just asks for the boundary layer thickness at the trailing edge. So if the flow is turbulent, then the formula changes.

Wait, but in the problem, part (a) doesn't specify laminar or turbulent. Hmm, perhaps I should assume it's laminar. But if Re_x is 6.75e6, which is way above 5e5, so the boundary layer is turbulent.

Wait, but part (a) doesn't specify any transition, so perhaps it's assuming the entire boundary layer is laminar. Or perhaps the question expects me to calculate it as if it's in the laminar region, regardless of the Reynolds number
