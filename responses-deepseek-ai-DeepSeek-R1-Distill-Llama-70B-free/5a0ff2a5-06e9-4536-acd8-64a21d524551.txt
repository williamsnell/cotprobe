Okay, I've got this question about the glossopharyngeal nerve and what happens when it's damaged by a malignant tumor. Hmm, let me think. So, I remember the glossopharyngeal nerve is the ninth cranial nerve, right? I think it's involved in various functions related to the throat area.

Wait, what does the glossopharyngeal nerve do exactly? I recall it has several functions. One of them is taste sensation. Oh right, taste from the posterior third of the tongue. Because the anterior part is handled by a different nerve, maybe the facial nerve? Yeah, the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve does the anterior two-thirds for taste.

So if the glossopharyngeal nerve is damaged, the patient would lose taste from the posterior two-thirds. That would point towards option G, which says loss of taste over the posterior two-thirds. But wait, are there other functions affected?

Another function I remember is the somatic sensory part. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides general sensory innervation to the posterior tongue, like touch and pain. So if it's damaged, the patient would also lose that sensation. But which options mention that?

Looking at the options, E says loss of somaesthetic over the posterior two-thirds. H is complete loss, which I don't think is right because other areas have other nerves. So E might be part of the symptoms.

Wait, the question is about what the patient will experience. So both taste and somatic sensation from the posterior tongue would be affected. So looking for an option that combines both.

Looking again: option I says loss of taste and somatosensory over the posterior third. Oh, wait, the term here is 'posterior third' or 'two-thirds'? The posterior third is a smaller area. Wait, actually, the posterior third refers to the very back part of the tongue, while the posterior two-thirds would be a larger area. I think the glossopharyngeal nerve handles the posterior third for taste, but maybe a bit more for general sensation.

Wait, no. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue's taste is via the facial nerve (cranial VII), specifically the chorda tympani. The glossopharyngeal (IX) handles the posterior third's taste. For somatic sensation, the anterior two-thirds is via the lingual nerve (trigeminal, V3), and the glossopharyngeal does the posterior third's somatic sensation.

So if the glossopharyngeal is damaged, the patient loses taste in the posterior third and the somatic sensation there too. So that's both. So the correct option should be I: loss of taste and somatosensory over the posterior third.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says 'posterior third' of the tongue. But wait, the options also have option E and G.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option G is loss of taste over posterior two-thirds. So that's incorrect because taste from posterior third is via IX, not two-thirds.

So the correct option is I. So the patient would experience loss of both taste and somatosensory sensation in the posterior third of the tongue.

Other options: Option A is loss of taste in anterior two-thirds, which is VII, so that's not it. B is complete loss of taste, which is not the case because they can still taste the anterior parts. C is paralysis of throat muscles, but the muscles of the throat (like pharyngeal muscles) are mainly controlled by the vagus nerve (cranial X), so IX might have some motor function but perhaps not the main ones. Or wait, the glossopharyngeal does supply the stylopharyngeus muscle, which is involved in swallowing. So if the nerve is damaged, maybe some difficulty in swallowing, but that's about paralysis of specific muscles, not the throat overall. So option C says paralysis of the muscles of the throat, which I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Option D is jaw muscles, which are controlled by the trigeminal nerve (cranial V), so no. Option E is loss of somatosensory over posterior two-thirds; no, because the posterior two-thirds' somatic sensation is via the lingual nerve for the anterior part and glossopharyngeal for the posterior third. So E is incorrect. Option F is loss of somatosensory in anterior two-thirds, which would be wrong because that's via the trigeminal. 

Option J is paralysis of the tongue's muscles. The hypoglossal nerve (XII) controls the tongue's muscles, so that's unrelated. 

So the correct answer must be option I.

The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) is responsible for several key functions, including taste sensation from the posterior third of the tongue and somatosensory (general sensory) innervation of the same region. When this nerve is damaged, the patient will experience a loss of taste from the posterior third of the tongue and a loss of somatosensory sensation in that area. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Loss of taste over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is incorrect because this region is innervated by the facial nerve (cranial VII) via the chorda tympani.
- **B**: Complete loss of taste sensation is incorrect because the patient can still experience taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.
- **C**: Paralysis of the muscles of the throat is incorrect because the glossopharyngeal nerve primarily controls the stylopharyngeus muscle, and the pharyngeal muscles are mainly innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial X).
- **D**: Paralysis of the muscles of the jaw is incorrect because jaw muscles are controlled by the trigeminal nerve (cranial V).
- **E**: Loss of somatosensory sensation over the posterior two-thirds of the tongue is incorrect because the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is innervated by the lingual nerve (trigeminal nerve), while the posterior third is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve.
- **F**: Loss of somatosensory sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is incorrect because this region is innervated by the trigeminal nerve.
- **G**: Loss of taste over the posterior two-thirds of the tongue is incorrect because the glossopharyngeal nerve only innervates the posterior third, not two-thirds.
- **H**: Complete loss of somatosensory sensation is incorrect because the glossopharyngeal nerve only affects the posterior third of the tongue.
- **I**: Loss of taste and somatosensory sensation over the posterior third of the tongue is correct because the glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for both functions in this region.
- **J**: Paralysis of the muscles of the tongue is incorrect because the hypoglossal nerve (cranial XII) controls the muscles of the tongue.

The correct answer is **I**, as it accurately reflects the loss of both taste and somatosensory sensation in the posterior third of the tongue due to glossopharyngeal nerve damage.

Answer: I
