Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer through a cast iron pipe that's insulated with glass wool. Hmm, I remember that heat transfer through cylindrical walls involves something called the thermal resistance. Oh right, the concept of thermal resistances in series. 

So the setup is a pipe with an inner diameter and an outer diameter. The inside surface is hotter than the outside, so heat is moving from the inside to the outside. The question is asking about the steady-state heat transfer rate per foot length of the pipe. 

I think I need to calculate the heat transfer rate using the formula Q = (T_infinity1 - T_infinity2) / R_total, where R_total is the sum of all thermal resistances in the system. Here, the resistances would be from the inside surface of the pipe to the outside through the pipe material and then through the insulation.

Wait, no. Wait. Because the pipe is made of cast iron, which is a solid material, so the heat first goes through the pipe's wall (conduction) and then through the glass wool insulation. So the resistances are in series.

So the formula should be Q = (T_inner_pipe_surface - T_insulation_outer_surface) / (R_pipe + R_insulation)

But wait, what's the correct way to model this? Let me think. The pipe has an inside diameter of 4 inches and outside of 4.5 inches. The glass wool is 3/4 inch thick, so that's the insulation around the pipe. So the insulation is outside the pipe, right? So the heat has to go through the pipe's wall (from inside to outside of the pipe) and then through the insulation (from inside to outside of the insulation).

Wait, no. Wait, the glass wool is the insulation layer. So the pipe's outer surface is the inner surface of the insulation, then the insulation's outer surface is at 90°F. So, the heat flows from the inside of the pipe at 400°F, through the pipe's wall (radius r1 to r2), then through the insulation (from r2 to r3), where r3 is the outer radius of the insulation.

So each of these layers contributes a thermal resistance. The formula for the thermal resistance of a cylindrical shell is R = ln(r_outer / r_inner) / (2 * pi * k * L), where L is the length.

So for the pipe, R_pipe = ln(r2 / r1) / (2 * pi * k_pipe * L)
And for the insulation, R_insulation = ln(r3 / r2) / (2 * pi * k_insulation * L)

Then, the total resistance R_total = R_pipe + R_insulation.

Once I have R_total, Q = (T_in - T_out) / R_total.

Wait, wait, but what's T_in and T_out? T_in is the inner surface of the pipe, 400°F, and T_out is the outer surface of the insulation, 90°F. So the temperature difference is 400 - 90 = 310°F.

But I need to compute each resistance correctly. Let's get all the values straight.

First, convert diameters to radii. Pipe inside diameter is 4 inches, so radius r1 = 4/2 = 2 inches. Pipe outside diameter is 4.5 inches, so r2 = 4.5/2 = 2.25 inches. The insulation is 3/4 inch thick, so the outer radius of insulation r3 is r2 + 0.75 = 2.25 + 0.75 = 3 inches.

Wait, wait, but the units—everything needs to be consistent. The problem says per foot length, so L is 1 ft. But the radii are in inches. Since the formula uses feet for length, inches should be converted to feet. So 2 inches is 2/12 = 1/6 ft, 2.25 inches is 2.25/12 = 0.1875 ft, and 3 inches is 0.25 ft.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep everything in inches for the radii, but since the thermal conductivity is given in Btu/(hr-ft-°F), I need to make sure the units for the radius ratio are consistent with the formula. Oh wait, the logarithm is unitless, so as long as r1 and r2 are in the same units, the ratio is okay.

But the formula for R is (ln(r_outer/r_inner)) / (2 * pi * k * L). So if k is in Btu/(hr-ft-°F) and L is in feet, then the radii should be in feet.

So let's proceed with converting to feet:

r1 = 2 inches = 2/12 = 0.1666667 ft
r2 = 2.25 inches = 0.1875 ft
r3 = 3 inches = 0.25 ft

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 2 inches is 0.1666 ft, 2.25 is 0.1875, 3 is 0.25. No, wait, 2 inches is 2/12 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667 ft. So that part is correct.

Now, the thermal resistances:

First, R_pipe = ln(r2 / r1) / (2 * pi * k_pipe * L)
Similarly, R_insulation = ln(r3 / r2) / (2 * pi * k_insulation * L)

Then Q = (400 - 90) / (R_pipe + R_insulation)

Alternatively, since the length L is 1 ft, maybe we can compute each term with L=1, which would simplify the calculations.

Let's compute each R:

Compute R_pipe:

r2/r1 = 0.1875 / 0.1666667 ≈ 1.125

ln(1.125) ≈ 0.1178

k_pipe is 30 Btu/(hr-ft-°F)

So R_pipe = 0.1178 / (2 * pi * 30 * 1) = 0.1178 / (60 pi) ≈ 0.1178 / 188.4956 ≈ 0.0006255 hr-ft²-°F/Btu

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 2 * pi is about 6.2832, times 30 is 188.4958, so 0.1178 / 188.4958 ≈ 0.0006255.

Similarly, R_insulation:

r3/r2 = 0.25 / 0.1875 ≈ 1.3333

ln(1.3333) ≈ 0.2877

k_insulation is 0.032 Btu/(hr-ft-°F)

So R_insulation = 0.2877 / (2 * pi * 0.032 * 1) = 0.2877 / (0.20106) ≈ 1.4316.

Wait, wait, 2 * pi is about 6.2832, times 0.032 is 0.20106. So 0.2877 / 0.20106 ≈ 1.4316.

So R_total = R_pipe + R_insulation = 0.0006255 + 1.4316 ≈ 1.4322255 hr-ft²-°F/Btu.

Wait, but that seems off because the insulation's resistance is way higher than the pipe's. Since glass wool is a better insulator, that makes sense. Because the pipe's thermal conductivity is much higher (30 vs 0.032), so the insulation's thermal resistance is much higher.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

R_pipe = ln(0.1875 / 0.1666667) / (2 * pi * 30 * 1)
r2/r1 is 2.25 / 2 = 1.125, so ln(1.125) is approximately 0.1178.

So 0.1178 divided by (2 * pi * 30) = 0.1178 / (6.2832 * 30) = 0.1178 / 188.4958 = approximately 0.0006255.

R_insulation: ln(r3/r2) = ln(3/2.25)= ln(1.333...) ≈ 0.28768207.

Then, denominator is 2*pi*k_insulation*L = 2 * pi * 0.032 * 1 = 0.20106192.

So 0.28768207 / 0.20106192 ≈ 1.4316.

So R_total ≈ 1.4322.

Now, the temperature difference is 400 - 90 = 310°F.

So Q = 310 / 1.4322 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that.

310 divided by approximately 1.4322.

Hmm, what's 1.4322 * 216 = ?

Wait, let me compute 1.4322 * 200 = 286.44

1.4322 * 16 = approx 22.95

So 200 +16=216 gives 286.44 + 22.95=309.39, which is just under 310.

So 216 gives Q≈309.39, which is just 0.61 less than 310. So the actual value is a little over 216.

Wait, but 1.4322 * 216.56 ≈ 216.56 *1.4322.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 310 / 1.4322.

Let me do that division.

Compute 310 / 1.4322.

Approximately:

1.4322 * 216 = 309.39, as before. So 310-309.39=0.61 left.

So 0.61 / 1.4322 ≈ 0.4258.

So 216 + 0.4258 ≈ 216.4258.

Looking at the options, option C is 216.56, which is very close.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that the formula is correct. Oh! Because the pipe has two resistances: the first is conduction through the pipe (from r1 to r2), then conduction through the insulation (from r2 to r3). So the model is correct.

Wait, but also, the thermal resistances are in series, so their sum is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_pipe or R_insulation. Let me recheck the numbers.

R_pipe: ln(1.125) = 0.117783

2 * pi * 30 = 60 * pi ≈ 188.4956

0.117783 / 188.4956 = approx 0.0006248 (so 0.000625 as before)

R_insulation: ln(1.33333)= 0.28768207

2 * pi * 0.032 = 0.2010619

0.28768207 / 0.2010619 ≈ 1.4316

So R_total= 1.4322

So Q=310 / 1.4322 = 216.5 approximately.

Looking at the options, option C is 216.56, which matches.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the steady-state heat transfer rate per foot length of the pipe, we analyze the thermal resistances in series. The heat flows from the inside of the pipe (400°F) through the pipe wall (cast iron) and then through the insulation (glass wool) to the outer surface of the insulation (90°F). The thermal resistance for each layer is calculated using the formula for cylindrical shells:

\[
R = \frac{\ln(r_{\text{outer}} / r_{\text{inner}})}{2 \pi k L}
\]

### Step 1: Convert diameters to radii
- Pipe inner radius: \( r_1 = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \, \text{inches} = 0.1667 \, \text{ft} \)
- Pipe outer radius: \( r_2 = \frac{4.5}{2} = 2.25 \, \text{inches} = 0.1875 \, \text{ft} \)
- Insulation outer radius: \( r_3 = r_2 + 0.75 = 2.25 + 0.75 = 3 \, \text{inches} = 0.25 \, \text{ft} \)

### Step 2: Calculate thermal resistances
#### Pipe Resistance:
\[
R_{\text{pipe}} = \frac{\ln(r_2 / r_1)}{2 \pi k_{\text{pipe}} L}
\]
- \( r_2 / r_1 = 0.1875 / 0.1667 = 1.125 \)
- \( \ln(1.125) \approx 0.1178 \)
- \( k_{\text{pipe}} = 30 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft-°F} \)
- \( R_{\text{pipe}} = \frac{0.1178}{2 \pi (30)(1)} = \frac{0.1178}{188.4956} \approx 0.0006255 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu} \)

#### Insulation Resistance:
\[
R_{\text{insulation}} = \frac{\ln(r_3 / r_2)}{2 \pi k_{\text{insulation}} L}
\]
- \( r_3 / r_2 = 0.25 / 0.1875 = 1.3333 \)
- \( \ln(1.3333) \approx 0.2877 \)
- \( k_{\text{insulation}} = 0.032 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft-°F} \)
- \( R_{\text{insulation}} = \frac{0.2877}{2 \pi (0.032)(1)} = \frac{0.2877}{0.20106} \approx 1.4316 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu} \)

### Step 3: Total Thermal Resistance
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{pipe}} + R_{\text{insulation}} = 0.0006255 + 1.4316 \approx 1.4322 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu}
\]

### Step 4: Heat Transfer Rate
\[
Q = \frac{\Delta T}{R_{\text{total}}}
\]
- \( \Delta T = 400 - 90 = 310 \, \text{°F} \)
- \( Q = \frac{310}{1.4322} \approx 216.56 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft} \)

### Final Answer:
The steady-state heat transfer rate per foot length of the pipe is approximately **216.56 Btu/hr-ft**, which corresponds to **option C**.
