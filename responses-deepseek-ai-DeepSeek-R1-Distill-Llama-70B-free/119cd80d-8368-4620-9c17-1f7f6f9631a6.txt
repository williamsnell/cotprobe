Question:

What is the source of the material that causes meteor showers?

Options:

A: Large meteorites disintegrate in the Earth's atmosphere, creating smaller particles that cause a meteor shower.
B: Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles that cause a meteor shower.
C: Asteroid impacts elsewhere in the solar system throw sand-sized particles into space and occasionally the Earth passes through a cloud of these particles which burn up in our atmosphere and cause a meteor shower.
D: Meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through a cloud of dust and debris left behind by the disintegration of planets in our solar system.
E: The gravitational pull of the moon causes rocks on its surface to be ejected into space. These rocks then enter Earth's atmosphere and cause a meteor shower.
F: Meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through the tail of a comet, where dust and ice particles are left behind.
G: Meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through a cloud of dust and debris left behind by the disintegration of distant stars.
H: Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.
I: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of satellites and space debris as they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.
J: The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles that cause a meteor shower.

Okay, so I've got this question about meteor showers and their sources. Hmm, I remember that meteor showers happen when the Earth passes through a trail of debris in space. But wait, what kind of debris? Let me think.

I think meteors are usually caused by small particles entering the atmosphere. So where do those particles come from? I remember something about comets and asteroids. Oh right, comets are icy bodies, and when they approach the sun, they release dust and particles. These particles spread out along the comet's orbit.

So when the Earth's orbit intersects with that debris trail, we get a meteor shower. The particles are usually small, like sand-sized, and burn up in the atmosphere, creating the streaks we see. So in that case, the source would be a comet's disintegration, not an asteroid's.

Wait, but I also recall that some meteor showers are linked to asteroids. Like the Geminid meteor shower is associated with an asteroid called Phaeton. So maybe both can contribute? But which option is correct here.

Looking at the options:

Option B says near-Earth asteroids disintegrate and spread particles. So when Earth passes through an asteroid's orbit, we get the shower. Option J says it's comets disintegrating and spreading particles along their path.

So the key is whether the source is asteroids or comets. I think most meteor showers come from comets, but some come from asteroids. But the question is asking in general about the source.

But the question is about what causes meteor showers. So both B and J could be possible, but which is more accurate?

Wait, the standard explanation is that most meteor showers are from comets. Comets leave behind trails of debris as they shed material when they approach the sun. Asteroids can also produce meteoroids, but it's less common. So the primary source for the majority of meteor showers is comets.

So looking at the options, J says comets' nuclei disintegrate and spread particles, which when Earth passes through, causes the shower. That sounds right.

Wait, another point: the question asks for the source material. So the particles causing the meteor shower are from where?

Option J: comets' nuclei disintegrate and spread. So when Earth passes through, we get the meteors.

Option F says it's the Earth passing through a comet's tail. That's a possibility too. The tail does have dust and ice particles. So does the tail count as the source?

I think the tail is part of the debris from the comet. So whether it's the tail or the orbital path, it's similar. So F and J both seem related.

Wait, option J says the particles are spread along the orbital path, so it's more about the trail left behind as the comet moves. Option F is about the tail, which is what the comet is emitting as it moves. So passing through the tail is part of that.

I might be getting confused between the two. Let me think again. The Perseid meteor shower is caused by the Earth passing through the debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet. So the debris is spread along the comet's orbit, so when Earth's orbit intersects, we get the shower. That's more in line with option J.

So the correct answer would be J. Because comets' nuclei disintegrate and spread particles along their orbital paths, and Earth passing through that causes the meteor shower.

The source of the material that causes meteor showers is typically associated with comets. As comets approach the Sun, they release dust and ice particles due to the Sun's heat, which spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through this trail of debris, the small particles enter the Earth's atmosphere, burning up and creating the streaks of light known as meteors. While some meteor showers can also originate from asteroids, the majority are caused by comets. Option J accurately describes this process, as it highlights the disintegration of cometary nuclei and the spread of particles along their orbital paths, which leads to meteor showers when Earth intersects these paths.

Answer: J
