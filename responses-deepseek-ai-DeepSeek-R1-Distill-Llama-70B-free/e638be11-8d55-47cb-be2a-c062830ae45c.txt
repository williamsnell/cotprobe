Question:

A resident of a state was the owner of a large tract of virgin forest. The resident conveyed the tract "to the people of the state in fee simple; provided, however, that if any portion of said tract shall ever be used or developed for any commercial purpose or otherwise converted from its natural state (with exception for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes), then the grantor or his successors in interest may reenter as of the grantor's former estate. "Under state law, conveyances of real property to "the people" of the state are deemed to vest title in the state regarded as a legal entity, and custody over such property resides in an appointed official known as the director of environmental resources. The director granted a logging company the privilege to cut timber on a remote portion of the tract, together with incidental easements of way. The section that the logging company was to clear would be used for the development of a state recreational area. After the privilege was granted, the logging company proceeded to clear the timber, which he later sold for $10,000. When the resident learned that the logging company was cutting the timber and selling it, he notified the director to desist further exploitation of the land. In an ejectment action instituted by the resident against the state to recover the tract, what result would be expected?

Options:

A: The resident would succeed, because the logging company's selling of the timber would constitute an automatic termination of the state's fee interest.
B: The resident would not succeed, because the logging company was given permission by the state official to clear the timber.
C: The resident would not succeed, because the land was being used for recreational purposes, which was an exception in the original conveyance.
D: The resident would not succeed, as the tract was given to the people of the state without any restrictions.
E: The resident would succeed, because the logging company's actions amounted to commercial use of the land.
F: The resident would succeed, because the land was converted from its natural state for commercial purposes.
G: The resident would succeed, because the state did not have the right to grant the logging company the privilege to cut timber.
H: The resident would not succeed, because the reservation of the resident's right to terminate would be violative of the rule against perpetuities.
I: The resident would succeed, because the logging company's selling of the timber would entitle the resident to re-enter and terminate the grant to the state.
J: The resident would not succeed, because the director approved the clearing of the timber in order to develop the area for recreational purposes.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about property conveyance and the right of reentry. Let me break it down step by step.

The situation is that a resident conveyed a large tract of virgin forest "to the people of the state in fee simple." But there's a condition: if any part is used or developed for commercial purposes or converted from its natural state (except for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes), the grantor can reenter and take back the estate.

Under state law, when you convey land to "the people," it goes to the state as a legal entity, and the director of environmental resources is in charge of it.

Now, the director granted a logging company permission to cut timber on a remote part of the tract. The cleared area is for a state recreational area. The logging company sold the timber for $10,000. The resident found out and told the director to stop further exploitation. The resident then sued the state in ejectment to get the land back.

So the question is whether the resident will succeed in this action.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which is correct.

First, I should focus on the conveyance terms. The grant was to the state with a condition subsequent. If the land is used commercially or converted from natural state (with exceptions), the grantor can reenter.

The key here is whether the logging company's actions triggered the condition. The director allowed logging to clear the area for a recreational development. So the purpose is recreational, which is an exception. But wait, the logging company sold the timber for profit. So the question is whether that sale constitutes a commercial use.

The original condition allows recreational use, so if the primary purpose is recreational, maybe the commercial sale doesn't violate it. Or does it? Because the logging was part of preparing the land for recreational use, but selling the timber might be a commercial purpose outside the exception.

Hmm. So the conveyance says if used for commercial purposes, the grantor can take back. Here, the state allowed logging to develop a recreational area, which is allowed. But the logging company selling the timberâ€”does that count as a commercial use?

Wait, maybe not. Because the primary use is still recreational. The sale of the timber is an incidental commercial activity. Or perhaps it's a separate commercial use beyond the exception. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the state's action of allowing logging to clear land for a recreational area might be within the exception, so no breach. Therefore, the resident can't reenter. So the resident would not succeed.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the resident wouldn't succeed because the land was being used for recreational purposes, which is an exception. That seems possible.

Option E: Success because commercial use. But if the primary purpose is recreational, maybe the sale is secondary and allowed.

Option F: Success because converted for commercial purposes. Again, depends on whether the sale is the primary use.

Wait, the conveyance allows for recreational, scientific, or educational. So if the land is being converted for recreational purposes, even if some commercial activity happens (like selling the timber), does that violate it?

I think the key is the purpose of the use. The director allowed it for recreational development. The fact that the timber was sold might be a byproduct but doesn't change the primary purpose. So the condition wasn't breached because the use was for an allowed purpose.

So the resident wouldn't succeed because the exception applies.

Looking at the options again, option C says that. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but another point: when the state granted the logging company the privilege, does that mean the state is allowing a commercial activity? Because the logging company is a commercial entity. But the purpose is for a state recreational area, so perhaps the commercial activity is incidental to the recreational use.

Alternatively, the conveyance's condition is about the land's use, regardless of who is using it. So if the land is being used for a recreational area, even if a company is doing the logging for profit, the primary use is still recreational.

So the condition wasn't violated because the use is for an exception.

Thus, the resident can't reenter, so the answer would be C.

The resident conveyed a large tract of virgin forest to the state in fee simple, with a condition subsequent that allows the grantor to reenter if the land is used or developed for commercial purposes or converted from its natural state, except for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. The state, through its director, granted a logging company permission to cut timber on a remote portion of the tract to develop a state recreational area. The logging company sold the timber for $10,000, prompting the resident to seek an ejectment action to recover the tract.

The key issue is whether the logging company's actions, particularly the sale of the timber, constitute a breach of the condition subsequent. The conveyance allows exceptions for recreational purposes, and the primary goal of the logging was to clear the land for a recreational area. While the sale of the timber constitutes a commercial activity, it is incidental to the recreational development and does not change the primary purpose of the land use. Therefore, the condition subsequent was not violated, and the resident cannot reenter.

Option C correctly reflects this reasoning, as the land was being used for recreational purposes, which is an exception under the original conveyance.
