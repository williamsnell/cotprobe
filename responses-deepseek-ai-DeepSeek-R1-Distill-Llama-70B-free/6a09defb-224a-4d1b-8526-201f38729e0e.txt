Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically regarding character evidence in a criminal trial. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is that a man is on trial for securities fraud. He takes the stand to testify in his own defense. During direct examination, his attorney tries to present evidence of his good character. The prosecution objects. The question is about which statement is correct regarding the admissibility of that evidence.

I remember that character evidence is generally not admissible in criminal cases, except for certain exceptions. So when a defendant takes the stand, they can introduce evidence of their good character, but I think there are specific rules about how and when that's allowed.

Wait, let me think. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, I believe that a defendant who testifies may offer evidence of their good character. But wait, isn't there a rule that the prosecution can then bring in evidence of the defendant's bad character if the defense opens the door? Or is it that the defendant can't introduce evidence of their own good character unless the prosecution has attacked their character first?

No, I think the defendant can introduce evidence of their good character even if the prosecution hasn't attacked it. Because when the defendant takes the stand, they're subjecting themselves to cross-examination, which includes potential questions about their character. But does that mean the defense can proactively present evidence of good character on direct?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the rules. 

Generally, evidence of a person's character is inadmissible to prove they acted in accordance with that character on a particular occasion. That's Rule 404(a). But there's an exception when the defendant's character is an essential element of the charge, like in some sex crimes where the defendant's character for chastity might be relevant, but that's rare.

However, when a defendant testifies, they can introduce evidence of their good character. But I think the rule is that the defendant may offer evidence of their good character, but only in the form of reputation evidence, not specific acts. Wait, no, I think that's for the prosecution when they're rebutting the defense's evidence.

Wait, let me get this straight. For a defendant, if they choose to testify and present evidence of their good character, they can do so. But if they do, the prosecution can then present evidence of their bad character, such as specific instances or a reputation for dishonesty. 

So in the question, the defendant's attorney is proffering evidence of his good character on direct examination. The prosecution objects. So the issue is whether the defense can introduce that evidence in the first place.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The defendant may introduce evidence to show good moral character. I think this is correct because the defendant can present evidence of good character when they testify.

Option B: Defendant may not introduce evidence to show honesty because character evidence is inadmissible. This seems wrong because the defendant is allowed to present such evidence.

Option C: May introduce evidence of past good deeds. No, because character evidence is about reputation or opinion, not specific acts. Wait, no, I think when a defendant offers evidence of good character, they can do so through reputation or opinion testimony, but not specific acts. So Option C might be incorrect because it's about past good deeds, which are specific acts.

Option D: May introduce evidence to show honesty. That's a trait of character, so perhaps allowed under the same reasoning as A.

Option E: Show truthfulness, which is similar to honesty, so same as D.

Option F: Defendant may not introduce evidence of truthfulness unless it's on cross-examination. That doesn't sound right. The defendant can bring it up on direct.

Option G: May not introduce unless prosecution first attacks. No, I think the defendant can introduce it even if the prosecution hasn't attacked their character yet.

Option H: May not introduce evidence of honesty unless on cross. Again, I think the defense can bring it up on direct.

Option I: Introduce evidence of dishonesty. That doesn't make sense because the defendant would want to show good character, not bad.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the defendant can introduce evidence of their good character without the prosecution having attacked it. I think under Rule 404(a)(1), when a defendant is charged with a crime, their good character is admissible, even if the prosecution hasn't brought it up. So the defendant can offer evidence of their good character as part of their case.

So the objection by the prosecution would be overruled, allowing the evidence. So which option supports that?

Looking at the options again:

Option A says the defendant may introduce evidence to show good moral character. That seems correct.

Option D: show honesty. Same as A, but more specific. Wait, but does the defendant have to choose between different character traits, or can they just present a general good character?

I think the rule allows the defendant to present evidence of good character in general, which would encompass traits like honesty. So both A and D might seem correct, but looking at the options, the correct answer is probably A.

Wait, no, wait. I think the Federal Rules allow the defendant to offer evidence of their good character. So the correct answer would be that the defendant may introduce evidence of good moral character, making option A correct.

But wait, another thought: when the defendant takes the stand, they can be asked about specific instances of conduct on cross-examination. But on direct, I think they can present evidence of their good reputation for character. So the attorney can ask the defendant about their reputation in the community, for example.

So the correct statement is that the defendant may introduce evidence to show good moral character. So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me make sure. Option G says the defendant may not introduce evidence unless the prosecution first attacks. If that's not the case, then G is incorrect.

Yes, the defendant can introduce evidence of good character regardless of whether the prosecution has attacked it. So G is wrong.

So the correct answer must be either A, D, or E. But the question is about what is correct after the prosecution objects. So the attorney proffers the evidence, and the prosecution objects. So the issue is whether the evidence is admissible.

The correct rule is that the defendant may introduce evidence of good character when they testify, so the objection would be overruled. Therefore, option A is correct.

Wait, but another angle: in some jurisdictions, the defendant cannot introduce evidence of their good character unless it's a specific character trait that's directly at issue in the case. For example, in a fraud case, honesty might be directly relevant, so evidence of the defendant's honesty could be admissible.

So perhaps the correct answer is D or E. But I think the broader statement in option A is correct because the defendant can introduce evidence of good moral character generally.

Alternatively, maybe the rule is that the defendant can only introduce evidence of a specific trait that's relevant to the charge, like honesty in a fraud case. So in that case, option D or E would be correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think about the Federal Rules again. Rule 404(a)(1) says that evidence of a person's character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except when the defendant's character is an essential element of the charge, or when the defendant offers evidence of their own good character.

Wait, no. Rule 404(a)(1) says: "Evidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible for the purpose of proving that the person acted in conformity with the character or trait on the occasion in question, except: ... (B) in a criminal case in which the defendant’s character is an essential element of the charge, or (C) when the defendant offers evidence of their own good character." 

Wait, no. I think I'm mixing it up. Let me check the actual rule. 

Federal Rule of Evidence 404(a)(1) states: "Evidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible for the purpose of proving that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with the character or trait, except: ... (B) in a criminal case in which the defendant’s character or a character trait is an essential element of the charge, the prosecution may offer evidence of the defendant’s character or trait as circumstantial evidence of the defendant’s conduct on the occasion in question." 

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me get the exact rule. 

Actually, Rule 404(a) says: "(a) Character Evidence. 

(1) Prohibiting Use. Evidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible for the purpose of proving that the person acted in conformity with the character or trait on the occasion in question, except: 

... 

(B) in a criminal case in which the defendant’s character or a character trait is an essential element of the charge, the prosecution may offer evidence of the defendant’s character or trait as circumstantial evidence of the defendant’s conduct on the occasion in question."

Wait, so for the defendant, when can they offer evidence of their own character? I think under Rule 404(a)(1), the general prohibition applies except in cases where the defendant's character is an essential element, which is rare, but the defendant can offer evidence of their own character as an affirmative defense.

Wait, no, I think that the defendant can offer evidence of their good character regardless of whether it's an essential element. Because I remember that when a defendant testifies, they can present evidence of their good character, which opens the door for the prosecution to rebut with evidence of bad character.

So, the correct approach is that the defendant may introduce evidence of their good character, so option A is correct.

But wait, another point: the defendant can introduce evidence of their good character, but it's usually in the form of reputation evidence, not specific instances. So the attorney could ask the defendant about their reputation in the community for honesty or integrity, for example.

So, the prosecution's objection would be overruled, and the evidence would be allowed, making option A correct.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option A says "good moral character," which is a general term. Option D says "honesty." The question is whether the defendant can introduce evidence of a specific trait like honesty.

I think the answer depends on whether the defendant can introduce evidence of a specific trait or only general good character. Alternatively, if the defendant offers evidence of good moral character, that's allowed, but if they try to focus on a specific trait like honesty without the prosecution having brought it up, maybe that's not allowed.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think of it this way: the defendant can offer evidence of their good character in general, which would include traits like honesty. So if the attorney is offering evidence of the defendant's good moral character, that's permissible under the rules, making option A correct.

Alternatively, if the attorney is trying to elicit testimony about specific traits like honesty without a general character framework, that might not be allowed. But in this question, the attorney is proffering evidence of good character, so option A would be correct.

Wait, but another thought: the defendant cannot introduce evidence of specific good acts, only reputation or opinion evidence of good character.

So, the correct approach is that the defendant can introduce evidence of good character, making option A correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of character evidence in a criminal trial, specifically when a defendant testifies in their own defense. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, character evidence is generally inadmissible to prove that a person acted in conformity with that character on a particular occasion, as stated in Rule 404(a). However, there are exceptions. A defendant who takes the stand may introduce evidence of their good moral character, which is an exception to the general prohibition on character evidence. This is allowed even if the prosecution has not attacked the defendant's character.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "The defendant may introduce evidence to show good moral character." This is correct because the defendant is permitted to introduce evidence of their good moral character when they testify, even if the prosecution has not attacked their character.

- **Option B**: "The defendant may not introduce evidence to show honesty because character evidence is inadmissible." This is incorrect because the defendant can introduce evidence of honesty as part of their good moral character under the exception for defendants testifying in their own defense.

- **Option C**: "The defendant may introduce evidence of his past good deeds." This is incorrect because character evidence is limited to reputation or opinion testimony, not specific acts or deeds.

- **Option D**: "The defendant may introduce evidence to show honesty." While honesty is a specific trait, the defendant can introduce evidence of honesty as part of their broader good moral character, making this option redundant in light of Option A.

- **Option E**: "The defendant may introduce evidence to show truthfulness." Similar to Option D, truthfulness is a specific trait that falls under the broader category of good moral character, so this option is also redundant.

- **Option F**: "The defendant may not introduce evidence of truthfulness unless it is inquired into on cross-examination." This is incorrect because the defendant can introduce evidence of truthfulness on direct examination as part of their good moral character.

- **Option G**: "The defendant may not introduce evidence of good character unless the prosecution first attacks his character." This is incorrect because the defendant can introduce evidence of good character even if the prosecution has not attacked it.

- **Option H**: "The defendant may not introduce evidence of honesty unless it is inquired into on cross-examination." This is incorrect because the defendant can introduce evidence of honesty on direct examination.

- **Option I**: "The defendant may introduce evidence to show dishonesty." This is incorrect because the defendant would not introduce evidence of their own dishonesty.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately reflects the rule that the defendant may introduce evidence of their good moral character when testifying in their own defense.
