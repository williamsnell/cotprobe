Okay, so I have this question about cross-cultural studies on facial expressions. The question is asking which option correctly lists the six facial expressions recognized by people in almost every culture. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I remember something about Paul Ekman's work. Let me think about it.

From what I recall, Ekman did studies where he showed pictures of facial expressions to people from different cultures and found that certain emotions were universally recognized. The original six he identified were happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. These are often referred to as the basic emotions.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Happiness, sadness, desire, repulsion, fear, and surprise. Hmm, desire isn't one of the ones I remember. Plus, repulsion might be similar to disgust, but I'm not sure if that's the exact term used.

Option B: Joy, sorrow, fear, rage, astonishment, and repugnance. Joy is happiness, sorrow is sadness, fear is the same, rage is anger, astonishment is surprise, repugnance is disgust. So this looks similar, but the words are a bit different. Wait, is 'rage' the exact term used? I think the original terms are 'anger', not 'rage', but maybe it's a synonym.

Option C: Happiness, sadness, anger, loathing, lust, and surprise. Lust is definitely not one of them. Loathing is close to disgust, but again, not the exact term.

Option D: Elation, melancholy, panic, ire, stupefaction, and detestation. These seem like more intense or less common terms. Elation is like extreme happiness, melancholy is sadness, panic is maybe fear, ire is anger, stupefaction is surprise, detestation is disgust. So similar but more elaborate words.

Option E: Glee, gloom, terror, outrage, amazement, and abhorrence. Glee is happiness, gloom is sadness, terror is fear, outrage is anger, amazement is surprise, abhorrence is disgust. Again, synonyms but not the exact basic terms.

Option F: Happiness, sadness, fright, anger, shock, and revulsion. Fright is fear, shock is surprise, revulsion is disgust. So that's happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust. Which matches what I remember. Wait, but is 'fright' the same as fear? I think in Ekman's list, fear is fear, so this might not be the exact terms.

Option G: Happiness, sadness, indifference, fright, surprise, and dislike. Indifference isn't one of the basic emotions. So this is wrong.

Option H: Delight, despair, dread, fury, wonder, and aversion. Delight is happiness, despair is sadness, dread is fear, fury is anger, wonder is surprise, aversion is disgust. Again, similar but not exact terms.

Option I: Happiness, sadness, fear, wrath, startle, and repulse. Wrath is anger, startle is surprise, repulse is disgust. So that's the same six emotions but different words.

Option J: Happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. Yes, this matches exactly what I remember. These are the six basic emotions as per Ekman's work.

Wait, but looking back, option B uses 'rage' for anger, which is a synonym. Similarly, option J uses the exact terms. The question asks for the correct list, so I think the exact terms are more likely the intended answer. So option J is the correct one.

The question asks which option correctly lists the six facial expressions recognized by people across virtually every culture. Based on Paul Ekman's work, the six universally recognized emotions are happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. These terms match exactly with option J. While other options use synonyms or more elaborate terms, they do not align as precisely with the established findings. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: J
