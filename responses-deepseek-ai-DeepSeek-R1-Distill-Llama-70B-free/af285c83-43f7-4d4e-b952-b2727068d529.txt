Okay, so I have this question about neural transmission being an electrochemical process, and I need to find out which part is most involved in the electrical aspect. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that neural transmission involves both electrical and chemical processes. The electrical part has to do with the movement of ions and the generation of action potentials. The chemical part is about neurotransmitters and synapses.

So, the question is asking about the electrical aspect. What structures are involved in that? Well, the action potential travels along the axon. The axon is the long part of the neuron that carries the electrical impulse away from the cell body. Oh wait, but what about myelin? Myelin sheaths cover the axons and speed up the transmission by allowing the action potential to jump from node to node. That's the saltatory conduction, right? So myelin is definitely involved in the electrical part.

Wait, but the question is about what's most directly involved. The actual electrical impulse is in the axon itself. Myelin just facilitates it. So maybe the axon is the main part.

Let me go through the options again. Option A is the cell body, which is the soma. It's where the cell's nucleus is and where proteins are made. Not directly involved in the electrical transmission, more about the cell's functions.

Option B is myelin. As I thought, it's important for speeding things up but maybe not the primary electrical part.

Option C is synaptic vesicles. Those are in the terminal buttons and contain neurotransmitters, so they're part of the chemical transmission.

Option D, glial cells, support neurons and might help in various functions, including myelination (like Schwann cells), but again, more supportive.

Option E is terminal buttons, which are the ends of the axon where neurotransmitters are released. That's definitely chemical.

Option F, hormones, are chemicals released into the bloodstream, so not directly part of neural transmission's electrical aspect.

Option G is the synapse. That's the gap between neurons where chemical signals are sent, so that's the chemical part.

Option H is the axon. This is where the electrical signal travels as an action potential. So this seems directly involved in the electrical aspect.

Option I, dendrites, receive signals. They have ion channels too, but I think the main electrical transmission is along the axon.

Option J is neurotransmitters, which are chemicals, so part of the chemical process.

So putting it all together, the electrical aspect is mainly about the axon conducting the action potential. Myelin helps, but the axon is the direct structure involved. So the answer should be H.

Neural transmission is an electrochemical process involving both electrical and chemical components. The electrical aspect primarily relates to the movement of ions and the generation of action potentials, which travel along the axon. While myelin sheaths facilitate faster transmission by enabling saltatory conduction, the axon itself is the structure most directly involved in conducting the electrical impulse.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Cell body**: Involved in protein synthesis and general cell functions, not directly in electrical transmission.
- **B: Myelin**: Facilitates faster transmission but is not the primary structure for the electrical aspect.
- **C: Synaptic vesicles**: Part of the chemical transmission process, storing neurotransmitters.
- **D: Glial cells**: Supportive functions, including myelination, but not directly involved in the electrical aspect.
- **E: Terminal buttons**: Involved in releasing neurotransmitters, part of the chemical process.
- **F: Hormones**: Chemical messengers unrelated to the electrical aspect of neural transmission.
- **G: Synapse**: The site of chemical signal transmission, not electrical.
- **H: Axon**: The primary structure for conducting electrical impulses via action potentials.
- **I: Dendrites**: Receive signals but are not the main site of electrical transmission.
- **J: Neurotransmitters**: Chemical messengers, part of the chemical process.

The axon (H) is the most directly involved structure in the electrical aspect of neural transmission.

Answer: H
