Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is about psychology theories, specifically which psychologist's philosophy aligns with the idea that there are three major life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. The options are from A to J, each corresponding to a different psychologist.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down the question. The key part is the three life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. I'm trying to remember which psychologist talked about life tasks or stages involving these areas. 

I remember that Erik Erikson had something to do with stages of development. He proposed the theory of psychosocial development, which includes eight stages. Each stage has a specific conflict or task that needs to be resolved. For example, trust vs. mistrust in infancy, and later stages like identity vs. role confusion in adolescence. But I'm not sure if his stages specifically mention friendship, occupation, and love as three separate tasks.

Wait, another name that comes to mind is Alfred Adler. He was one of Freud's contemporaries and had his own theories. Adler talked about the importance of social interests and striving for superiority. He also mentioned something about life tasks. Oh right, Adler believed that there are three main life tasks: work (occupation), love (relationships), and friendship (social). He emphasized that success in these areas leads to a balanced and healthy life. So that sounds exactly like what the question is asking about.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Maslow is known for the hierarchy of needs, which includes love and belonging, but not specifically as three separate tasks. Rogers focused on person-centered therapy and the concept of the self. Piaget is all about cognitive development stages in children. Freud's psychosexual stages involve oral, anal, etc., but not these three tasks. Jung is about analytical psychology and the collective unconscious. Bandura is social learning theory. Perls is Gestalt therapy. Berne is transactional analysis. So none of these others seem to fit the three tasks mentioned.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be Adler, which is option G.

The question asks which psychologist's philosophy is most consistent with the idea that there are three major life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. Alfred Adler is the correct answer because he specifically identified these three areas as key life tasks, emphasizing their importance for a balanced and fulfilling life. Other psychologists, such as Erikson, Maslow, and others, do not focus on these exact tasks in their theories. 

Answer: G
