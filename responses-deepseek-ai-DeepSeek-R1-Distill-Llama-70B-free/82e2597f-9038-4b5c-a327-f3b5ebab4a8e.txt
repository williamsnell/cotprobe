Question:

The police arrested a man for the murder of his live-in fiancÃ©e after the woman's dead body was found in the basement of their apartment building. At trial, the prosecution attempted to present the testimony of the victim's out-of-state sister regarding a telephone conversation she had with the defendant. She had called their landline number to talk with her sister on the same day when he had first reported to the police that his fiancÃ© had been missing for five days. The sister had not met the man but had spoken with him briefly a few other times. He told her that her sister "went out all night last night and did not return yet." The prosecution attempted at trial to have the sister testify to the conversation to show the significant discrepancy between his stories to the police and to her. The defense objected, arguing that she couldn't authenticate the conversation because she couldn't identify the speaker as the defendant nor had she ever met him. The prosecution told the court that she felt it was "probably" his voice, which she recollected from the prior talks at the same number. Will the court likely grant the defendant's objection to the testimony?

Options:

A: Yes, because the conversation is hearsay and there are no exceptions that would allow it into evidence.
B: Yes, because the sister does not have sufficient experience and knowledge to be able to identify the man's voice and to say that the voice and the defendant were the same person.
C: Yes, because the conversation is irrelevant to the case.
D: Yes, because the sister's testimony could be considered as prejudicial against the defendant.
E: No, because the court can consider the sister's past interactions with the defendant over the phone to authenticate the conversation.
F: No, because the sister's testimony could aid in establishing a timeline of events.
G: No, because telephone conversations do not need to be authenticated, because there is a presumption that the person talking is the same person who owns the phone number.
H: Yes, because the sister cannot provide a reliable account due to her emotional state.
I: No, because there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to make a reasonable conclusion that the man she talked to was her sister's fiancÃ©.
J: No, because the defendant did not deny having the conversation with the sister.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically regarding the admissibility of testimony in a criminal trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a man is on trial for murdering his live-in fiancée. The prosecution wants to call the victim's sister to testify about a phone conversation she had with the defendant. The sister is from out of state and called the couple's landline on the same day the defendant reported his fiancée missing. She hadn't met the defendant but had spoken with him a few times before. During this call, he told her that her sister went out the night before and hadn't returned yet. The prosecution is trying to show a discrepancy between his story to the police (that she'd been missing five days) and what he told the sister (that she went out the night before).

The defense objects, arguing that the sister can't authenticate the conversation because she can't identify the speaker as the defendant and hasn't met him. The prosecution counters that she feels it was "probably" his voice based on prior talks at the same number.

The question is whether the court will grant the defendant's objection.

I need to figure out if the sister's testimony is admissible. The key issues here seem to be authentication and hearsay.

First, authentication. For a telephone conversation, the caller's identity must be established. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), there are methods to authenticate a telephone call. One common method is the identification of the voice, either by the participant or someone who knows the speaker's voice. Another is the use of a telephone number and the inference that the person answering is the one who lives there or is associated with it.

In this case, the sister hasn't met the defendant, but she's spoken to him a few times before. She's calling their landline, which is a number she's called before and spoken to him. She's testifying that she recognizes his voice, albeit tentatively as "probably" him.

So, does this meet the standard for authentication? I think it does. Courts generally allow testimony that a person's voice is familiar if they've had prior communications. The fact that she called the same number and recognized his voice from prior interactions could be sufficient for a jury to conclude that it was him.

Next, hearsay. The statement the defendant made to the sister—“went out all night last night and did not return yet”—is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. That's hearsay unless an exception applies.

But wait, the prosecution is offering it not for the truth, but to show that the defendant made a statement that's inconsistent with his prior statement to the police. So it's non-hearsay if it's offered for the effect on the listener or to impeach the defendant's credibility by showing inconsistency.

Alternatively, if the statement is being offered as a statement against interest under FRE 804(b)(3), but that would require the defendant's statement to be self-inculpatory. Here, the statement might not be self-inculpatory at the time it was made, but in context, it could be part of a pattern of deception.

But the primary issue is authentication, not hearsay, because the defense objection is about authentication. So assuming the conversation is authenticated, the hearsay objection might be overcome by using the statement for a non-hearsay purpose.

So, the defense's main argument is authentication. The sister can authenticate based on her prior interactions and recognizing his voice, even if she hasn't met him in person. Therefore, the objection on authentication grounds would likely fail.

Looking at the options:

Option E says no because the court can consider past interactions for authentication. That seems correct. Option I says no because there's sufficient circumstantial evidence. That might also be a way to authenticate. Option A says yes because it's hearsay with no exceptions, but if it's non-hearsay, then A is incorrect. Option B says yes because she can't sufficiently identify his voice. But she has prior interactions, so B might not be correct. Option G says no because telephone conversations don't need authentication, but that's not true; authentication is required.

So the correct answer is probably E or I. Between E and I, E focuses on past interactions, which directly relates to authentication. I focuses on circumstantial evidence, which might include other factors beyond just the sister's recognition.

But the sister's prior calls and her recognition of the voice are sufficient for authentication. So E is the better choice.

The court is unlikely to grant the defendant's objection because the sister can authenticate the conversation based on her prior interactions with the defendant over the phone. Although she has not met him in person, her recognition of his voice from previous calls to the same landline number provides a sufficient basis for authentication. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

E

The answer is E.
