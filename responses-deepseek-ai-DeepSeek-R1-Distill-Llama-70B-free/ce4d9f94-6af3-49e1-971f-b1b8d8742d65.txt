Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with de Broglie wavelengths. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of a tennis ball. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle. The formula, I think, is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum.

Wait, the variables given are mass and velocity. Oh right, momentum p is mass times velocity, so p = m*v. So I need to calculate p first, then plug it into the de Broglie formula.

Let me jot down the given values. The mass is 57 grams. Oh wait, I should convert that to kilograms because SI units are standard in physics. So 57 grams is 0.057 kg. Got that.

Velocity is given as 25 m/s. So p = m*v = 0.057 kg * 25 m/s. Let me compute that. 0.057 times 25... Let's see, 0.05 *25 is 1.25, and 0.007*25 is 0.175. Adding them gives 1.425 kg·m/s.

Now, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. Since J is kg·m²/s², h has units kg·m²/s. Which matches because when we divide h by p (kg·m/s), the units become meters, which is correct for wavelength.

So putting it all together: lambda = h/(m*v). Plugging in the numbers: (6.626e-34) / (1.425). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 6.626 divided by 1.425. Let me approximate that division. 1.425 times 4 is 5.7, so 4 times 1.425 is 5.7. 6.626 is about 6.626, so 6.626 /1.425 is approximately 4.65 (since 1.425 *4.65 ≈ 6.626). So 4.65e-34? Wait, no, wait. Wait no, because 6.626e-34 divided by 1.425. So 6.626 /1.425 is about 4.65, so the result is 4.65e-34 meters.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, let me check the choices. The options are A:3e-32, J:6.1e-33, G:4.7e-34, etc. So 4.65e-34 is close to option G, which is 4.7e-34.

Wait, did I calculate that correctly? Let me double-check the division. 6.626 /1.425. Let me compute it more accurately.

1.425 times 4 is 5.7. 6.626 -5.7=0.926. Bring down a decimal, add zero. 9.26 divided by 1.425.

1.425 *6 =8.55. 9.26-8.55=0.71. So 4.6 so far. 0.71 becomes 7.1 after multiplying by 10. 1.425 *5=7.125. So 4.65. So yeah, that's 4.65e-34.

Looking at the options, option G is 4.7e-34. That's the closest. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I mix up the calculation somewhere? Let me check the mass again. Oh, wait, the mass was 57 grams, which is 0.057 kg. Multiply by 25 m/s gives 1.425 kg m/s. Correct.

Hmm, but sometimes when I'm in a hurry, I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Oh, wait, another way: use exact values.

So h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s exactly (but for the problem, 6.626e-34 is fine). So 6.626e-34 divided by 1.425.

Let me compute 6.626 /1.425. Let's see:

1.425 = 57/40. So 6.626 divided by (57/40) equals 6.626 * (40/57).

Compute 40/57 ≈ 0.7017.

So 6.626 * 0.7017 ≈ let's see:

6 * 0.7 is 4.2, 0.626 *0.7 is about 0.438, so 4.638. But wait, 40/57 is 0.7017, so more accurately:

6.626 *0.7017 = ?

Compute 6 * 0.7017 = 4.2102.

0.626 *0.7017 = Let's compute 0.6 *0.7 is 0.42, 0.026 *0.7 is 0.0182. So 0.4382. So total is 4.2102 + 0.4382 = 4.6484. So approximately 4.6484e-34 meters.

So about 4.65e-34 m. The closest option is G:4.7e-34. So that's the answer.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a tennis ball, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( p \) is the momentum of the ball, given by \( p = m \cdot v \). The mass of the ball is \( 57 \, \text{g} \), which must be converted to kilograms: 

\[
m = 0.057 \, \text{kg}.
\]

The velocity of the ball is \( v = 25 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus, the momentum is:

\[
p = m \cdot v = 0.057 \cdot 25 = 1.425 \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Substituting into the de Broglie wavelength formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.425}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\lambda \approx 4.65 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{m}.
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is:

**G: \( 4.7 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{m} \).**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G**
