Question:

Consider a tank used in certain hydrodynamic experiments. After one experiment the tank contains $200 \mathrm{~L}$ of a dye solution with a concentration of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$. To prepare for the next experiment, the tank is to be rinsed with fresh water flowing in at a rate of $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, the well-stirred solution flowing out at the same rate. Find the time that will elapse before the concentration of dye in the tank reaches $1 \%$ of its original value.

E: 385 min
F: 345 min
G: 300 min

Okay, so I've got this problem about rinsing a tank and figuring out how long it takes for the concentration of dye to drop to 1% of the original. Hmm, let's break this down.

Alright, the tank initially has 200 liters of dye solution at 1 gram per liter. So the total amount of dye is 200 grams. Then, fresh water is flowing in at 2 liters per minute, and the well-stirred solution flows out at the same rate. So the volume in the tank stays constant at 200 liters, right?

I remember that these kinds of problems usually involve differential equations. The concentration changes over time as fresh water dilutes the solution. The key is to model the rate of change of the dye in the tank.

Let me think about the variables. Let's say y(t) is the amount of dye in the tank at time t. The concentration would then be y(t)/200 grams per liter.

The inflow is pure water, so the dye coming in is zero. The outflow is at the same rate, 2 L/min, and the concentration there is y(t)/200. So the rate at which dye leaves the tank is (2 L/min) * (y(t)/200 g/L) = (y(t)/100) g per minute.

So the differential equation would be dy/dt = (rate in) - (rate out). Since rate in is zero, dy/dt = -y(t)/(100) g per minute.

This is a first-order linear differential equation. The general solution for such an equation is y(t) = y0 * e^(-kt), where k is the rate constant. In this case, k is 1/100 per minute because dy/dt = - (1/100) y. So the equation becomes y(t) = 200 * e^(-t/100).

We need to find the time when the concentration is 1% of the original. The original concentration was 1 g/L, so 1% of that is 0.01 g/L. Since the volume is constant, the amount of dye at that point would be 0.01 g/L * 200 L = 2 grams. So we're looking for when y(t) = 2 grams.

Plugging into the equation: 2 = 200 * e^(-t/100). Let's solve for t.

Divide both sides by 200: 2/200 = e^(-t/100) => 0.01 = e^(-t/100).

Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.01) = -t/100.

What's ln(0.01)? Oh right, ln(1/100) is -ln(100) which is about -4.605.

So -4.605 = -t/100. Multiply both sides by -1: 4.605 = t/100. Multiply both sides by 100: t = 460.5 minutes.

Looking at the options, option A is 460.5 min. So the answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we model the dye concentration in the tank over time. The tank initially contains 200 L of dye solution with a concentration of \(1 \ \mathrm{g/L}\), so the total dye is \(200 \ \mathrm{g}\). Fresh water flows in at \(2 \ \mathrm{L/min}\), and the well-stirred solution flows out at the same rate, keeping the volume constant at \(200 \ \mathrm{L}\).

Let \(y(t)\) represent the amount of dye in the tank at time \(t\). The rate of change of dye is governed by the differential equation:

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = \text{(rate in)} - \text{(rate out)}.
\]

Since the inflow is pure water, the rate in is \(0\). The rate out is proportional to the concentration of dye in the tank, given by:

\[
\text{rate out} = \frac{y(t)}{200} \cdot 2 = \frac{y(t)}{100}.
\]

Thus, the differential equation becomes:

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{y(t)}{100}.
\]

This is a first-order linear differential equation, and its solution is:

\[
y(t) = y_0 e^{-kt},
\]

where \(y_0 = 200 \ \mathrm{g}\) is the initial amount of dye and \(k = \frac{1}{100} \ \mathrm{min}^{-1}\). Substituting these values:

\[
y(t) = 200 e^{-t/100}.
\]

We need to find the time \(t\) when the concentration of dye reaches \(1\%\) of its original value. The original concentration was \(1 \ \mathrm{g/L}\), so \(1\%\) of this is \(0.01 \ \mathrm{g/L}\). Since the volume is constant, the corresponding amount of dye is:

\[
y(t) = 0.01 \cdot 200 = 2 \ \mathrm{g}.
\]

Substituting \(y(t) = 2 \ \mathrm{g}\) into the equation:

\[
2 = 200 e^{-t/100}.
\]

Dividing through by 200:

\[
0.01 = e^{-t/100}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.01) = -\frac{t}{100}.
\]

Since \(\ln(0.01) = -\ln(100) \approx -4.605\), we have:

\[
-4.605 = -\frac{t}{100}.
\]

Multiplying through by \(-100\):

\[
t = 460.5 \ \mathrm{min}.
\]

Thus, the time required for the concentration to drop to \(1\%\) of its original value is approximately \(460.5 \ \mathrm{min}\). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

A: 460.5 min.
