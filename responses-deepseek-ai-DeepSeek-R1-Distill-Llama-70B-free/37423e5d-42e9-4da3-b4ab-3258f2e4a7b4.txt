The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A police officer entered a private home in response to a reported disturbance. She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with "deviate sexual intercourse", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?

Options:

A: The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.
B: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes on the men's Ninth Amendment rights, which protect other rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.
C: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes the men's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.
D: The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.
E: The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.
F: The statute is constitutional as it promotes the common good.
G: The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.
H: The statute is constitutional as it is based on the state's interpretation of religious principles.
I: The statute is unconstitutional as it goes against the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.
J: The statute is constitutional because it falls within the state's police power to regulate health, safety, welfare, and morals.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Supreme Court question. Let me read through it carefully. 

The scenario is about a police officer entering a private home after a disturbance call. She didn't find a disturbance but saw two men having consensual sex. They were arrested and charged under a state law that prohibits same-sex sexual relations. They lost in state courts and are now appealing to the US Supreme Court. I need to figure out what the Court would hold and the reasoning.

I remember that the Supreme Court has dealt with similar issues before. There's the case of Lawrence v. Texas, which I think is directly relevant here. In Lawrence, the Court struck down a Texas law that criminalized same-sex sodomy. The decision was about privacy rights, right?

So, let me think about the options. The question is about what the holding would be. The options are A through J.

Option A: The federal constitution can't interfere with state's right to regulate sexual morality. Hmm, Lawrence actually did interfere with state law, so I don't think A is correct.

Option B: Ninth Amendment rights. The Ninth Amendment is about rights not listed in the Constitution. But I think the main argument in Lawrence was the Due Process Clause, not the Ninth. So maybe B isn't the main reason here.

Option C: Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Equal Protection was part of the discussion in some cases, like Romer v. Evans, but in Lawrence, the majority opinion focused more on substantive due process and privacy rather than equal protection. So C might not be the primary reason here.

Option D: First Amendment freedom of expression. I don't recall the First Amendment being the basis in Lawrence. The issue was more about private conduct than expression.

Option E: Relationship not protected by privacy, subject to state regulation. No, Lawrence established that private consensual conduct is protected by privacy rights, so E is probably wrong.

Option F: Promotes the common good. The Court in Lawrence didn't find the law serving a legitimate state interest, so F is unlikely.

Option G: Substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Yes, this rings a bell. The Court in Lawrence held that the Texas law violated the Due Process Clause because it intruded on the personal privacy of consenting adults in their homes. So G sounds correct.

Option H: Based on religious principles. The Court generally doesn't allow laws that are purely based on religious views without a secular purpose. So H wouldn't make the law constitutional.

Option I: Cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The issue here is the law criminalizing the act, not the punishment being cruel. So I doesn't fit.

Option J: State's police power. States have police power to regulate for health, safety, etc., but Lawrence said that criminalizing private consensual acts isn't a valid exercise of that power. So J isn't the right holding.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be G, as the statute infringes on the men's right to liberty under substantive due process.

The Supreme Court would likely hold that the statute is unconstitutional because it infringes on the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. This conclusion aligns with the precedent set in Lawrence v. Texas, where the Court struck down a similar law, emphasizing the protection of privacy and personal autonomy for consenting adults in private conduct.

Answer: G
