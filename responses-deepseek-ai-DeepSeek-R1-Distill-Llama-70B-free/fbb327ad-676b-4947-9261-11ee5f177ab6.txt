Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about felony murder, and I need to figure out which option least likely removes liability. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that felony murder is a doctrine that holds a defendant responsible for a murder that occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of intent to kill. The underlying felony here is arson because the defendant set fire to the victim's house. The victim died in the fire, so the charge is felony murder.

The question is asking which of the given options would least likely remove liability. So I need to think about what defenses are available in felony murder cases and how each option affects that.

Let me go through each option:

A: The defendant was coerced by another to set the fire.
I think coercion can sometimes be a defense. If someone is forced to commit a crime under duress, they might not be liable. But I'm not entirely sure how this applies to felony murder. Maybe if the coercion was such that the defendant had no choice, it could negate the intent required for the underlying felony.

B: The defendant did not intend to kill the victim.
Felony murder doesn't require intent to kill, just the intent to commit the underlying felony. So if the defendant didn't intend to kill, that doesn't matter. But wait, maybe some jurisdictions require that the death was a natural and probable consequence of the felony. But I'm not sure. So this might not help because the intent for the killing isn't the issue.

C: The defendant thought the house was empty when he set the fire.
If he thought the house was empty, he lacked the intent to harm anyone. But for felony murder, the underlying felony (arson) just needs to be a dangerous felony. Arson inherently involves danger to human life, so even if he thought it was empty, the act is still reckless. So this might not remove liability because the mens rea for the felony is still present.

D: The defendant believed the victim had already evacuated the house.
Similar to option C. If he thought the victim was gone, he might not have intended to harm anyone. But again, the underlying felony's intent is what matters. Arson is intentional burning of a dwelling. If he believed the house was empty, he still intended to commit arson, which is a felony. So maybe this doesn't remove liability either.

E: The defendant was insane when he set the fire.
Insanity is a possible defense. If he was insane, he might not have the mens rea required for the underlying felony. But wait, felony murder can sometimes be strict liability in terms of the killing, but the underlying felony requires specific intent. So if he was insane and couldn't form the intent to commit arson, then he couldn't be guilty of the felony, thus no felony murder. So this could remove liability.

F: The victim died of a heart attack before the fire spread to his bedroom.
This seems like it would break the causal chain. If the victim died of a heart attack before the fire reached him, then the defendant's actions didn't cause the death. So the death wasn't a result of the felony. Therefore, felony murder wouldn't apply because the death wasn't during the commission of the felony. This would remove liability.

Now, the question is which option least likely removes liability. So which of these is not a good defense.

Option B says the defendant didn't intend to kill. Since felony murder doesn't require intent to kill, this fact alone wouldn't remove liability. The other options might provide a defense, but B doesn't because intent to kill isn't required. So the assertion that the defendant didn't intend to kill would least likely remove liability.

Wait, but let me think again. The underlying felony requires intent. For arson, the intent is to burn a dwelling. So if the defendant intended to commit arson, the intent is there regardless of whether he wanted to kill. So option B's assertion doesn't affect the underlying felony's intent. Hence, even if he didn't intend to kill, he still committed the felony, so felony murder applies.

So the correct answer is B.

To determine which assertion would least likely remove liability for felony murder, it is important to analyze each option in the context of the felony murder doctrine. Felony murder holds a defendant liable for a death that occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of intent to kill. The underlying felony here is arson, which requires the intent to burn a dwelling. 

- **Option A**: Coercion can sometimes be a defense if the defendant was forced to commit the crime under duress, potentially negating the intent required for the underlying felony. This could remove liability.  
- **Option B**: The defendantâ€™s lack of intent to kill is irrelevant under the felony murder doctrine because the doctrine does not require intent to kill. The intent to commit the underlying felony (arson) is sufficient. Therefore, this assertion would least likely remove liability.  
- **Option C**: If the defendant believed the house was empty, they still intended to commit arson, which is a dangerous felony. This might not remove liability because the intent for the underlying felony is present.  
- **Option D**: Similar to Option C, believing the victim had evacuated does not negate the intent to commit arson. The defendant still intended to burn the dwelling, so liability may remain.  
- **Option E**: Insanity could remove liability if it prevented the defendant from forming the intent required to commit the underlying felony (arson).  
- **Option F**: If the victim died of a heart attack before the fire spread, the causal link between the felony and the death is broken. This would remove liability because the death did not result from the commission of the felony.  

Among these, **Option B** is the least likely to remove liability because the felony murder doctrine does not require intent to kill. The intent to commit the underlying felony is sufficient to establish liability. 

**Answer: B**
