Okay, so I've got this question about de Marneffe's responses to the objection that drug prohibition is paternalistic. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what paternalism means in this context. Paternalism is when someone, like a government, makes decisions for others 'for their own good' without their consent. The objection here is that prohibiting drugs is paternalistic because it restricts people's choices supposedly to protect them from themselves.

The question is asking which option represents de Marneffe's response to this objection. I remember that de Marneffe has written about drug policy and paternalism. I think he argues against the prohibition of drugs, but I'm not entirely sure how he addresses the paternalism point.

Looking at the options:

Option A says paternalism is always justified if it's in the best interest. That sounds too absolute. I don't think de Marneffe would support that because he might argue that even if it's for good, paternalism can be problematic.

Option B suggests that while prohibition is paternalistic, the good consequences outweigh the paternalism. I'm not sure if de Marneffe would agree with this because I think he leans against prohibition, so maybe he doesn't think the consequences are good enough.

Option C claims paternalism is positive when guiding away from harm. Again, this seems to support paternalism, which I'm not sure de Marneffe does. He might argue that even if it's guiding, it's still wrong because of individual autonomy.

Option D says prohibition is societal control, not paternalism. That doesn't sound right because societal control can be a form of paternalism if it's imposing for the good of the people.

Option E argues that paternalism only applies to children, and prohibition targets adults. Wait, paternalism can apply to adults too, so this might not be correct. De Marneffe might not use this argument.

Option F says prohibition is paternalistic but necessary for order and public health. This is similar to B, but again, I think de Marneffe is more critical of prohibition, so he might not say it's a necessary evil.

Option G claims the concept doesn't apply. That doesn't seem right because the objection is about paternalism, so de Marneffe would address it, not dismiss it.

Option H says it's not paternalistic because it doesn't impose parent-like authority. I don't think that's accurate; paternalism doesn't require a parent figure, just acting in a way that's for the person's own good without their consent.

Option I states that prohibition isn't paternalistic because it protects society. Wait, that's an interesting point. If the main goal is to protect others (like reducing crime or public health issues), then it's more about preventing harm to others, not paternalism towards the user. So, maybe de Marneffe argues that prohibition isn't paternalistic because its aim isn't to protect the individual from themselves but to protect society from the individual's actions.

Option J says it's done for the benefit of others, not the users, so it's not paternalistic in a bad way. That aligns with what I was thinking for option I. So, if prohibition is to protect others, it's not paternalistic towards the drug users themselves. Instead, it's more about third-party effects.

Wait, but options I and J are similar. Option I says it's not paternalistic because it protects society, while J says it's for the benefit of others, so not paternalistic in an objectionable sense.

I think de Marneffe's argument is that paternalism involves imposing restrictions for the person's own good. If the reason for prohibition is the harm to others (like drugged drivers, crime, etc.), then it's not paternalistic because it's not for the individual's own benefit but for others. So, the correct option would be either I or J.

Looking back, the question is about how de Marneffe responds to the objection. He might argue that prohibition isn't paternalistic because it's aimed at protecting society, not the individual. So, option I says it's not paternalistic because it protects society. Option J says it's for the benefit of others, so not paternalistic in an objectionable way.

Wait, but paternalism can be towards others as well. Or is it strictly about the individual? Hmm, I think paternalism is when you impose your will on someone else for their own good. So if the law is to protect others, it's not paternalistic towards the person being restricted.

So, de Marneffe might argue that prohibition isn't paternalistic because it's not aimed at the individual's own good but at protecting others. Therefore, the correct answer would be either I or J.

Looking again, option I says "would not be paternalistic because it would protect society from the harmful effects of drugs." That makes sense because the focus is on others, not the individual user.

Option J says "would be done for the benefit of others, not the benefit of those who wish to produce/sell drugs, so it is not paternalistic in an objectionable sense." So, J is saying it's not paternalistic because it's for others, not for the producers or sellers. But I think the main point is that it's for the benefit of others, not the individual, so it's not paternalistic in a way that's objectionable.

Wait, but the question is about the objection that prohibition is paternalistic. So de Marneffe's response would be to say that it's not paternalistic because it's not for the individual's own good.

So, the correct option would be I or J. I'm a bit torn. Let me think again.

De Marneffe's argument, as I recall, is that laws against drugs are not paternalistic because they are not intended to protect the drug user but to protect others from the user's actions. So, for example, preventing someone from driving under the influence is about protecting others, not the individual. Therefore, the law is not paternalistic in that sense.

So, option I says it's not paternalistic because it protects society. Option J says it's for the benefit of others, so not paternalistic in an objectionable sense.

Wait, but the question is about which is one of de Marneffe's responses. So, perhaps both I and J are possible, but which one is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is J. Because J is about the benefit of others, not the producers or sellers. So, if the prohibition is to protect society from the effects caused by drug users, then it's for others' benefit, making it not paternalistic towards the individual.

Hmm, I'm leaning towards option J. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option E says it's targeted to adults, so only paternalistic towards children. But that's not correct because paternalism can apply to adults too.

Option I: protects society from harmful effects. So, it's about others, not the individual, so it's not paternalistic.

Option J: done for the benefit of others, not the individual, so not paternalistic in an objectionable sense.

So, I think the correct answer is either I or J. But which one.

Wait, de Marneffe's argument is that paternalism involves restricting a person's liberty for their own good. If the restriction is for the good of others, then it's not paternalistic. So, option J states that it's for the benefit of others, making it not paternalistic in the objectionable (self-interested) sense.

Alternatively, I think J is the correct answer because it's about the benefit of others, not the individual, thus not paternalistic.

The question asks which option represents de Marneffe's response to the objection that drug prohibition is paternalistic. Paternalism involves restricting someone's liberty for their own good, often without their consent. De Marneffe argues that drug prohibition is not paternalistic because its primary aim is to protect society from the harmful effects of drugs, rather than to protect the individual drug user for their own good.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Claims paternalism is always justified if it serves the best interest. This is too absolute and does not align with de Marneffe's critique of paternalism.
- **Option B**: Suggests prohibition is paternalistic but justified by good consequences. De Marneffe is critical of prohibition, so this is unlikely.
- **Option C**: Argues paternalism is positive when guiding away from harm. This supports paternalism, which de Marneffe does not do.
- **Option D**: Claims prohibition is societal control, not paternalism. This is incorrect because societal control can be a form of paternalism.
- **Option E**: States paternalism applies only to children, but paternalism can apply to adults too.
- **Option F**: Suggests prohibition is paternalistic but necessary. De Marneffe is more critical of prohibition, so this is unlikely.
- **Option G**: Dismisses the concept of paternalism altogether, which does not address the objection.
- **Option H**: Claims prohibition is not paternalistic because it doesn't impose a parent-like authority. This is incorrect because paternalism does not require a parent-like figure.
- **Option I**: Argues prohibition is not paternalistic because it protects society. This aligns with de Marneffe's argument that the focus is on protecting others, not the individual.
- **Option J**: States prohibition benefits others, not the individual, making it non-paternalistic in an objectionable sense. This also aligns with de Marneffe's argument.

Both **I** and **J** are plausible, but **J** more precisely captures de Marneffe's argument that prohibition is not paternalistic because it is done for the benefit of others, not the individual. This makes it the best answer.

Answer: J
