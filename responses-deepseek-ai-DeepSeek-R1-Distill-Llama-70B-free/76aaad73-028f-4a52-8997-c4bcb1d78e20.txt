Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the sum of the infinite series ∑(2/(n² + 4n +3)) from n=1 to infinity. Hmm, I remember that for series like this, partial fraction decomposition might be the way to go. Let me think about how to break this down.

First, the denominator is a quadratic: n² +4n +3. I think I can factor that. Let's see, what two numbers multiply to 3 and add up to 4? Oh right, 1 and 3. So it factors into (n+1)(n+3). That makes sense.

So the term becomes 2/[(n+1)(n+3)]. Now, partial fractions would split this into A/(n+1) + B/(n+3). To find A and B, I'll set up the equation:

2 = A(n+3) + B(n+1).

I need to solve for A and B. Let me choose convenient values for n. If n = -3, then the equation becomes 2 = A(0) + B(-3 +1) → 2 = B*(-2) → B = -1. 

Similarly, if n = -1, then 2 = A(-1 +3) + B(0) → 2 = A*2 → A=1.

So the partial fractions are 1/(n+1) - 1/(n+3). That means each term in the series can be written as 1/(n+1) -1/(n+3).

Now, the series becomes the sum from n=1 to ∞ of [1/(n+1) -1/(n+3)]. Let me write out the first few terms to see if there's a pattern or if it's telescoping.

For n=1: 1/2 -1/4
n=2: 1/3 -1/5
n=3: 1/4 -1/6
n=4: 1/5 -1/7
n=5: 1/6 -1/8
...

I notice that this series might telescope. Let's write the sum as:

Sum = (1/2 -1/4) + (1/3 -1/5) + (1/4 -1/6) + (1/5 -1/7) + ... 

Looking at the positive terms: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 +1/6 + ...
Negative terms: -1/4 -1/5 -1/6 -1/7 -...

So when we add them, a lot should cancel. Let's see:

Sum = 1/2 + 1/3 + (1/4 -1/4) + (1/5 -1/5) + (1/6 -1/6) + ... 

So most terms cancel except the first two positive terms. So Sum = 1/2 + 1/3 = (3 +2)/6 =5/6 ≈0.8333.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because the series starts at n=1, so the first term is 1/2 -1/4, and the next is 1/3 -1/5, etc.

Let me think about the general partial sum S_N = sum from n=1 to N of [1/(n+1) -1/(n+3)].

This would expand as:

(1/2 -1/4) + (1/3 -1/5) + (1/4 -1/6) + ... + [1/(N+1) -1/(N+3)].

Now, grouping the terms:

Positive terms: 1/2 + 1/3 +1/4 + ... +1/(N+1)
Negative terms: -1/4 -1/5 -1/6 - ... -1/(N+3)

So when we subtract, the 1/4 cancels with -1/4, 1/5 with -1/5, etc., except for the first few.

So S_N = 1/2 + 1/3 -1/(N+2) -1/(N+3).

Wait, because the negative terms start at 1/4, which is the same as n=1: 1/(n+3) when n=1 is 4.

So as N approaches infinity, the terms 1/(N+2) and 1/(N+3) go to zero. So the sum becomes 1/2 +1/3 =5/6.

Yes, that makes sense. So the sum would be 5/6, which is approximately 0.8333.

Looking at the answer options, option E is 0.8333, so that's the one.

To find the sum of the infinite series 

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{n^2 + 4n + 3},
\]

we start by factoring the denominator:

\[
n^2 + 4n + 3 = (n+1)(n+3).
\]

Using partial fraction decomposition, we express the term as:

\[
\frac{2}{(n+1)(n+3)} = \frac{A}{n+1} + \frac{B}{n+3}.
\]

Solving for \(A\) and \(B\), we set up the equation:

\[
2 = A(n+3) + B(n+1).
\]

By choosing convenient values for \(n\), we find \(A = 1\) and \(B = -1\). Thus, the decomposition is:

\[
\frac{2}{(n+1)(n+3)} = \frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n+3}.
\]

The series now becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n+3} \right).
\]

Writing out the first few terms:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{6} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} \right) + \dots
\]

This is a telescoping series, where most terms cancel out. The positive terms are:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \dots
\]

and the negative terms are:

\[
-\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{6} - \dots
\]

After canceling, only the first two positive terms remain:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Adding these:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333.
\]

Thus, the sum of the series is approximately \(0.8333\), which corresponds to option **E**.
