To determine the prime factorization of 77, we start by identifying the prime numbers that multiply together to give 77. 

First, we check if 77 is divisible by smaller prime numbers. Dividing 77 by 7 gives:

\[
77 \div 7 = 11
\]

Next, we check if 11 is a prime number. Since 11 is only divisible by 1 and itself, it is indeed a prime number.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 77 is:

\[
77 = 7 \times 11
\]

Looking at the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: 7 • 11**

Answer: E
