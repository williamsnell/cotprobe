Question:

A state built a racetrack that was specially designed and constructed for thoroughbred horseracing. State bonds were issued to finance the construction of the racetrack. The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the racetrack was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. After the racetrack was built and in operation for two years, the state legislature passed a bill requiring the racetrack to admit all senior citizens over the age of 65 for the discounted admission fee of 50 cents. This law is probably

Options:

A: unconstitutional, because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law.
B: constitutional, because it supports social welfare by providing discounts to senior citizens.
C: unconstitutional, because it discriminates on the basis of age.
D: constitutional, because the state has the power to change admission prices.
E: unconstitutional, because it violates the rights of the bondholders.
F: unconstitutional, because it goes against the state's responsibility to repay bonds.
G: constitutional, because the state has the right to regulate commerce within its borders.
H: unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.
I: unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.
J: constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me break it down step by step. 

The question is about a state that built a racetrack using bonds. The bond agreement had specific repayment terms. For the first five years, $2 from each admission would go to repay the bonds. If that wasn't enough, then for the next five years, $1 from each admission would be used. 

Now, after two years of operation, the state legislature passes a law allowing senior citizens over 65 to get in for 50 cents. I'm guessing this is a discounted price. The question is whether this law is constitutional.

Hmm, so the issue here is about the state changing the admission prices after the bonds were issued. The bondholders were relying on a certain amount from each admission to get repaid. If the state lowers the price, that might reduce the revenue available to repay the bonds. So, does this law interfere with the bond agreement?

I remember something about the Contract Clause in the Constitution. Article I, Section 10 says states can't pass laws impairing the obligation of contracts. So if the state's action impairs a prior contract (like the bond agreement), that might be unconstitutional.

Wait, but what about the state's police power? States have the authority to regulate for public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. So if the legislature is trying to help senior citizens by offering a discount, that's a public welfare measure. But does that justify interfering with the bond contract?

In the case of United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey (1977), the Supreme Court held that a state cannot impair contractual obligations unless it's reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose, and the adjustment is based on due process. So the state's action needs to meet a high standard.

In this scenario, the state is changing the admission price, which affects the revenue stream committed to bond repayment. If this reduces the funds available, the bondholders might not get their money back as agreed. So this impairs the contract between the state and the bondholders.

But the state might argue it's using its police power for the public good—helping seniors. However, the question is whether this action is a reasonable and necessary means to achieve that. I'm not sure if giving a discount to seniors would be seen as a significant enough public purpose to justify impairing the contract, especially since the bondholders relied on the original terms.

Also, the timing matters. The law was passed after the racetrack had been operating for two years. So it's a change after the fact, which could be seen as an impairment.

Another thought: are there any exceptions or cases where such impairment was allowed? I think courts are more lenient when the impairment is minor and the public purpose is strong. But in this case, the bond repayment is a significant obligation. Lowering the admission fee could directly impact the ability to repay, which seems substantial.

So putting it together, the state's law might be unconstitutional because it impairs the contract with the bondholders without a compelling enough reason or without meeting the necessary criteria. So the correct answer is likely about impairing the contract.

Looking at the options, option I says it's unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract. That fits with what I was thinking. Option E says it violates the rights of bondholders, which is similar but more about rights than contract impairment. But the Contract Clause is specific, so I think I is the right choice.

The question revolves around whether a state law, enacted after the issuance of bonds to finance a racetrack, is constitutional. The law mandates discounted admission for senior citizens, potentially reducing revenue earmarked for bond repayment. This raises issues under the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits states from passing laws that impair contractual obligations unless such actions are reasonable, necessary, and serve an important public purpose.

The bond agreement explicitly tied admission revenues to bond repayment, creating a contractual obligation. The state's subsequent law alters this arrangement by reducing admission fees, thereby impairing the revenue stream committed to bondholders. While the state may argue that the law serves a public welfare purpose by aiding senior citizens, courts typically require a high standard of justification for such impairments. The timing of the law—passed after the racetrack had been operational for two years—further supports the argument that it constitutes an impairment of the bondholders' contract rights.

Among the answer choices, option I correctly identifies that the law is unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract, aligning with the analysis under the Contract Clause.
