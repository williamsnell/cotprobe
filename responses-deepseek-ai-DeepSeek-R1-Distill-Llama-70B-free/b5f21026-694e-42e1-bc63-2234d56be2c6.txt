Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of completing the square. Let's see what the question is asking. The expression given is -2x² -20x -53, and I need to rewrite it in the form a(x + d)² + e. Then, find the sum a + d + e. Hmm, right, completing the square.

Alright, let me recall the steps. When you have a quadratic in the form ax² + bx + c, completing the square involves factoring out the coefficient of x² first. So here, the coefficient is -2. I think I should factor that out from the first two terms.

So, the original expression is -2x² -20x -53. Let me rewrite it by factoring out -2 from the first two terms. That would give me -2(x² + 10x) -53. Wait, because -2 times x² is -2x², and -2 times 10x is -20x. Yep, that's correct.

Now, the next step is to complete the square inside the parentheses. The expression inside is x² + 10x. To complete the square, I take the coefficient of x, which is 10, divide it by 2 to get 5, and then square it to get 25. So, I need to add 25 inside the parentheses to make it a perfect square trinomial.

But wait, if I add 25 inside, I'm actually adding (-2)*25 because of the factor outside. So to balance that, I need to add the same amount to the expression. Let me think. So, inside the parentheses, I add 25, which is effectively subtracting 2*25 from the entire expression because of the -2 factor. So, I should add 50 to the expression to keep it balanced.

Wait, maybe I should write it out step by step to avoid confusion. So, starting again:

-2x² -20x -53 = -2(x² + 10x) -53.

Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of 10, which is 5, square it to get 25. So we add and subtract 25 inside:

= -2[(x² + 10x +25 -25)] -53.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because I'm adding 25 inside the parentheses which is multiplied by -2, that's actually subtracting 50 from the expression. So to compensate, I need to add 50 outside. Let me correct that.

So:

= -2[(x² + 10x +25) -25] -53.

Expanding this, it's:

= -2(x +5)^2 + (-2)*(-25) -53.

Because (x^2 +10x +25) is (x+5)^2. The -25 inside is multiplied by -2, so that becomes +50.

So putting it all together:

= -2(x +5)^2 +50 -53.

Then, 50 -53 is -3. So the expression becomes:

-2(x +5)^2 -3.

Wait, but the target form is a(x +d)^2 + e. So in this case, a is -2, d is +5 (because it's x +5), and e is -3.

So now, a is -2, d is 5, and e is -3. The sum a + d + e would be (-2) +5 + (-3).

Let me calculate that: (-2 +5) is 3, then 3 + (-3) is 0. So the sum is 0.

Looking at the options, option A is 0. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I don't want to make a mistake.

Starting again:

Original expression: -2x² -20x -53.

Factor out -2 from the first two terms:

-2(x² +10x) -53.

Complete the square for x² +10x: take half of 10 (which is 5), square it (25). So we add 25 inside the parentheses, which because of the factor becomes -2*(25) = -50. To balance, add 50 outside.

So:

-2(x² +10x +25) +50 -53.

Which simplifies to:

-2(x +5)^2 + (50 -53) = -2(x+5)^2 -3.

Yes, that's correct. So a is -2, d is 5, e is -3.

Sum: (-2) +5 + (-3) = 0.

So the correct answer is A: 0.

To rewrite the expression \(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\) in the form \(a(x + d)^2 + e\), we start by factoring out \(-2\) from the first two terms:

\[
-2x^2 - 20x - 53 = -2(x^2 + 10x) - 53.
\]

Next, we complete the square for the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. The coefficient of \(x\) is \(10\), so we take half of \(10\), which is \(5\), and square it to get \(25\). Adding and subtracting \(25\) inside the parentheses:

\[
-2[(x^2 + 10x + 25) - 25] - 53.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 + 50 - 53.
\]

Combining constants:

\[
-2(x + 5)^2 - 3.
\]

Thus, the expression is in the form \(a(x + d)^2 + e\), where \(a = -2\), \(d = 5\), and \(e = -3\). The sum \(a + d + e\) is:

\[
-2 + 5 - 3 = 0.
\]

The correct answer is **A: 0**.
