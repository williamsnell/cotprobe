Okay, so I have this question about reinforcement schedules in psychology. Hmm, I remember that reinforcement schedules are part of operant conditioning, which Skinner talked about. The question is about buying ice cream and getting a stamp each time until you get one free after ten purchases.

Let me think about the different schedules. There's fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, variable-interval, and continuous reinforcement. I think continuous reinforcement is when you get a reward every single time you perform the behavior. That's probably not this case because here, the reward isn't immediate; you have to buy ten first.

Fixed-ratio is when you get a reward after a set number of responses. Like, every 10 ice creams bought, you get one free. That sounds familiar. So in this scenario, it's every ten purchases, so fixed-ratio makes sense.

Wait, but I should double-check. Variable-ratio is when the number of responses needed varies each time, like gambling where you don't know when you'll win. That's not the case here because it's a fixed number, ten.

Fixed-interval is based on time. You get a reward after a certain time period, regardless of the number of responses. So if you get a free ice cream after, say, every two weeks of buying, that would be fixed-interval. But the question is based on the number of purchases, not time.

So putting it together, the situation is that every tenth purchase gives a reward, which fits fixed-ratio. So the parlor is using a fixed-ratio schedule.

Looking at the options, option E is Fixed-ratio. So the answer should be E.

The question involves identifying the reinforcement schedule used by the Yellow Brick Road ice cream parlor, where a free item is awarded after ten purchases. This scenario aligns with a **fixed-ratio schedule**, as the reward is provided after a consistent, predetermined number of responses (ten purchases). Other schedules, such as variable-ratio (unpredictable number of responses), fixed-interval (time-based), or continuous reinforcement (reward after every response), do not fit the described situation.

**Answer: E**
