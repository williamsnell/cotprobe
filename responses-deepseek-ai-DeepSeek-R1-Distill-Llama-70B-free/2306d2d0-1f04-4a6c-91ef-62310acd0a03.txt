Question:

What do you expect the rate of growth to be of aneconomy where , on average, the population saves 15% of its income and marginal capital/output ratio is 2.5, i.e., an in-crease in output of $100 billion per year is produced by an increase in the capital stock of $250 billion.

A: 4% per year
B: 12% per year
C: 2% per year
D: 15% per year
E: 7.5% per year
F: 10% per year
G: 6% per year
H: 5% per year
I: 3% per year
J: 8% per year

Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the rate of growth of an economy. It says that on average, the population saves 15% of its income. Also, the marginal capital/output ratio is 2.5. That means an increase in output of $100 billion per year is produced by an increase in the capital stock of $250 billion. I need to find the expected rate of growth from the options given.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that there's something called the Harrod-Domar model, which relates savings, capital, and economic growth. Let me think. Oh right, the model suggests that the growth rate depends on savings and the capital-output ratio.

The formula I think is: Growth Rate (g) = Savings Rate (s) / Capital-Output Ratio (k). Or wait, is it the other way around? Wait, no, no. The capital-output ratio is the amount of capital needed per unit of output. So if the capital-output ratio is high, that means more capital is needed to produce each unit of output, which would slow down growth. So the formula should relate the savings rate divided by the capital-output ratio to get the growth rate.

Wait, but in the question, the marginal capital/output ratio is given as 2.5. That is, for an increase in capital of $250 billion, output increases by $100 billion. So the ratio is 250/100 = 2.5, which is the capital-output ratio. So that's the denominator in the formula.

The savings rate is 15%, which is 0.15 as a decimal. So according to the formula, g = s / k. So that's 0.15 divided by 2.5. Let me compute that.

0.15 divided by 2.5. Let me see, 0.15 divided by 2.5. Hmm, 2.5 times 0.06 is 0.15, because 2.5 * 0.06 = 0.15. So 0.15 / 2.5 = 0.06, which is 6%. So the growth rate should be 6% per year.

Looking at the options, option G is 6% per year. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing the formula. I've heard of the formula as g = s / v, where v is the capital-output ratio. Yeah, that seems right. So s is savings rate, v is the capital per unit of output. So 0.15 / 2.5 = 0.06, which is 6%. So yes, option G.

The rate of growth of an economy can be determined using the Harrod-Domar model, which relates the savings rate (s) to the capital-output ratio (k). The formula is:

\[
g = \frac{s}{k}
\]

Here, the savings rate is 15% (or 0.15), and the marginal capital-output ratio is 2.5. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[
g = \frac{0.15}{2.5} = 0.06 \, \text{or} \, 6\%.
\]

Thus, the expected rate of growth is 6% per year. The correct answer is:

G: 6% per year.

Answer: G
