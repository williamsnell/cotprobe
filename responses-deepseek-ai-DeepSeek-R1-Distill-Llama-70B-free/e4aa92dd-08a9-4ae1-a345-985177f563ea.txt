Question:

One month before finals, Conrad makes a study schedule and begins to review his notes. Two weeks before finals, Conrad is studying for hours each day to prepare. Right after finals at the start of summer vacation, Conrad comes down with the flu. Which of the following theories best explains this chain of events?

B: Thorndike's law of effect
C: Selye's general adaptation syndrome
D: Yerkes-Dodson law

F: Freud's psychosexual stages of development
G: Pavlov's classical conditioning
H: Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory
I: Maslow's hierarchy of needs
J: Piaget's stages of cognitive development

Okay, so I have this question here about psychological theories and a scenario involving Conrad. Let me break it down step by step to figure out the correct answer.

The question describes Conrad's actions over time. One month before finals, he makes a study schedule and starts reviewing. Then two weeks before finals, he's studying for hours each day. Then right after finals, at the start of summer vacation, he gets the flu. The question is asking which theory best explains this chain of events.

I remember that this is about stress and the body's response. So, which theories relate to stress? I think Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome is about the body's response to stress over time. Let me recall: Selye's theory has three stages â€” alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. 

So, when you first experience stress, your body triggers the alarm stage, releasing hormones like adrenaline. Then, if the stress continues, the body tries to adapt in the resistance stage, but over time, if the stress doesn't let up, you reach the exhaustion stage where your resources are depleted, and you become more susceptible to illness. That makes sense because Conrad was probably under prolonged stress from studying so much before exams.

Wait, other options: Yerkes-Dodson law is about the relationship between arousal and performance. It suggests that a certain level of stress can enhance performance, but too much can hurt it. But that doesn't directly explain getting sick after the stress period.

Bandura's social learning theory is about observing and imitating others, which doesn't fit here. Erikson and Freud's theories are about developmental stages, which isn't relevant to this scenario. Pavlov's classical conditioning is about associative learning, so that's out. Festinger's cognitive dissonance is about conflicting thoughts causing discomfort, which doesn't explain illness.

Maslow's hierarchy is about needs, but unless Conrad's basic needs weren't met, it's not the cause of getting the flu. Piaget's stages are about cognitive development in children, so that's unrelated.

So the best fit is Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome because it explains how prolonged stress leads to burnout and susceptibility to illness, like Conrad getting the flu after exams.

The scenario describes Conrad experiencing prolonged stress from intense studying before finals, followed by getting the flu immediately after. This chain of events aligns with Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome, which outlines three stages of stress response: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Over time, prolonged stress depletes the body's resources, leading to the exhaustion stage, where the immune system weakens, making the individual more susceptible to illness. Other theories, such as Yerkes-Dodson law, Bandura's social learning theory, Erikson's stages, Freud's psychosexual stages, Pavlov's classical conditioning, Festinger's cognitive dissonance, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and Piaget's cognitive development stages, do not directly explain the link between prolonged stress and illness. Therefore, the best explanation is Selye's theory.
