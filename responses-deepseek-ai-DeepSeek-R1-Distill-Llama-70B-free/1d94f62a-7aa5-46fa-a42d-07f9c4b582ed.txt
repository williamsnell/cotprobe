Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric charges and the force between them. Hmm, okay, let's see. Alright, the setup is that there's a negative point charge of 10^-6 coulombs at the origin. Then, there's a second negative point charge of 10^-4 coulombs situated on the positive x-axis, 50 cm away from the origin. The question is asking for the force on the second charge.

Wait, right, electric force between two charges. Oh right, Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². But wait, I remember that the force also has a direction, determined by whether the charges are attracting or repelling each other.

Since both charges are negative, they should repel each other. So the force on each charge will be in the direction away from each other. For the second charge, which is on the positive x-axis, the force will push it further along the positive x-direction. But wait, the problem is asking for the magnitude of the force, so maybe the direction doesn't matter for the calculation here. But I should double-check the problem statement.

Alright, the charges are q1 = 1e-6 C and q2 = 1e-4 C. The distance r is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. Oh wait, but wait, when using Coulomb's law, the units should be in meters, kilograms, seconds, and coulombs. Right.

Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Let me write that down.

So plugging into the formula: F = (8.988e9) * (1e-6) * (1e-4) / (0.5)^2.

Let me compute the numerator first: 1e-6 * 1e-4 is 1e-10. Multiply that by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 1e-10 = 8.988e-1, which is 0.8988.

Wait, but wait, the denominator is (0.5)^2, which is 0.25. So F = 0.8988 / 0.25.

0.8988 divided by 0.25. Hmm, 0.25 times 4 is 1, so 0.8988 / 0.25 is the same as 0.8988 * 4. Let me calculate that: 0.8988 *4 = 3.5952. So approximately 3.6 Newtons.

Wait, but wait, the charges are both negative, so does that affect the magnitude? No, because the formula uses the absolute value of the charges. So the magnitude is positive. So the force is about 3.6 N.

Looking at the options, option A is 3.6 newtons. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Let's recalculate that step. So F = k * q1 * q2 / r².

q1=1e-6, q2=1e-4. So 1e-6 * 1e-4 = 1e-10. Multiply by k=9e9 (approx). So 9e9 * 1e-10 is 0.9. Then divide by (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 0.9 / 0.25 = 3.6. Yes, that's correct.

So the force is 3.6 Newtons. So the correct answer is option A.

To determine the force on the second charge, we use Coulomb's law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

Here:
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) (Coulomb's constant),
- \( q_1 = 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \),
- \( q_2 = 10^{-4} \, \text{C} \),
- \( r = 50 \, \text{cm} = 0.5 \, \text{m} \).

First, calculate the product of the charges:

\[
q_1 \cdot q_2 = 10^{-6} \cdot 10^{-4} = 10^{-10} \, \text{C}^2
\]

Next, calculate the denominator \( r^2 \):

\[
r^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now substitute into the formula:

\[
F = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (10^{-10})}{0.25}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (10^{-10}) = 8.988 \times 10^{-1} = 0.8988
\]

Finally, divide by \( 0.25 \):

\[
F = \frac{0.8988}{0.25} = 3.5952 \, \text{N}
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the force is approximately \( 3.6 \, \text{N} \). Since both charges are negative, the force is repulsive, but the problem only asks for the magnitude of the force.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: 3.6 newtons**
