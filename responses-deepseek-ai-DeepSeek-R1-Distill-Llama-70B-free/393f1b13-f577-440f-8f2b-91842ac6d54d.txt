Question:

A man was under custodial interrogation as a suspect in the murder of a child. The police initially gave him a written list of his Miranda rights. They told him to read the list out loud, which he did. They then asked him if he understood the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present and he nodded affirmatively. He refused to sign the writing but did not ask for an attorney. During the next three hours they interrogated him and got few answers; he was largely silent but did respond at times with a "no" or "yes" or a nod of the head. Then one of the detectives asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. His eyes welled with tears and he said "yes." This opened further questioning leading to his admission of guilt. He would not sign a written confession or a waiver of the right to remain silent. He was arrested for murder and moved to suppress the confession. Will the court suppress the confession as being involuntarily given?

Options:

A: No, the suspect's emotional response and admission of guilt indicates a voluntary confession.
B: Yes, the confession is considered involuntary because he did not sign a written waiver of his right to remain silent.
C: Yes, the suspect's refusal to sign the written confession and waiver of rights indicates the confession was involuntary.
D: No, the suspect's engagement in the questioning, although minimal, demonstrates an understanding and voluntary waiver of his rights.
E: No, the confession is not considered involuntary as the suspect voluntarily answered the questions without the presence of an attorney.
F: Yes, the confession must be suppressed because the suspect was largely silent during the interrogation, indicating a lack of willingness to participate.
G: Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary.
H: No, the circumstances indicate that he understood that he could stop the questioning and get a lawyer but he did not do so.
I: Yes, the confession must be suppressed because he was questioned for over three hours, making anything he said essentially involuntary.
J: No, whenever a written list of Miranda warnings is given to a suspect and he doesn't ask for a lawyer, this is proof that the suspect fully understands his rights.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the court will suppress the confession as involuntary. Let me start by understanding the facts given.

The man is under custodial interrogation for murder. The police gave him a written Miranda rights list. He read it out loud, nodded that he understood his rights, but refused to sign the waiver. He didn't ask for an attorney either. For three hours, he was mostly silent but gave some short answers like "yes" or "no" or nods. Then, a detective asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. He cried and said "yes," leading to further questioning and his confession. He wouldn't sign any written confession or waiver.

The question is about whether the confession was voluntary. I remember that Miranda rights require that the suspect knowingly and voluntarily waives their rights. The key issue here is voluntariness.

I think the initial part shows he understood his rights because he read them and nodded. But he didn't sign the waiver. However, a written waiver isn't necessarily required; an oral waiver can suffice. So his refusal to sign doesn't automatically make the confession involuntary.

He was interrogated for three hours, mostly silent but occasionally answered. Then, the detective used a religious appeal. The suspect became emotional and confessed. The question is whether this was coercive or deceptive to the point of making the confession involuntary.

I recall that psychological manipulation can sometimes render a confession involuntary. For example, if the police use tactics that create a coercive environment, the confession might be suppressed. But the use of emotional appeals, like religious themes, isn't always enough unless it's particularly egregious.

In this case, the detective's question about asking God for forgiveness might be seen as a form of psychological manipulation. But does it cross the line into making the confession involuntary? I'm not sure. Courts have allowed some level of psychological tactics as long as they don't rise to the level of coercion.

Another point is that the suspect didn't request an attorney and continued to answer, even minimally. His engagement, though limited, could indicate a voluntary participation. The fact that he responded when questioned, even after three hours, might show that he was making conscious decisions to answer.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the emotional response indicates a voluntary confession. That might be possible, but emotional responses can sometimes be induced by coercion.

Option B says the confession is involuntary because he didn't sign a waiver. I don't think that's correct because a waiver can be oral.

Option C is about refusing to sign, but again, that's not the determining factor.

Option D suggests that his minimal engagement shows understanding and voluntary waiver. That seems plausible.

Option E argues that without an attorney present, but he didn't ask for one, so it's voluntary. But the presence of an attorney isn't the only factor.

Option F is about being silent, but he did answer some questions.

Option G says the confession is involuntary because of religious deception. This seems like it could be a point, but I'm not certain if that alone makes it involuntary.

Option H says he understood his rights and didn't stop questioning. That might be a valid point.

Option I is about the three-hour interrogation. I think the length alone doesn't make it involuntary unless there were other coercive factors.

Option J is about the written list and not asking for a lawyer proving understanding. That might not be entirely accurate because understanding can be nuanced.

So, considering the factors, the key points are whether the interrogation tactics were so coercive that they overbore his will. The detective's use of a religious appeal might be a tactic, but unless it's shown to be deceptive or threatening, it might not render the confession involuntary.

In cases I've read, courts often look at the totality of the circumstances. Here, the suspect was given Miranda warnings, understood them, and didn't request an attorney. His responses, though minimal, indicate he was engaging. The emotional appeal might have influenced him, but if it's not seen as coercive, the confession would stand.

So I think the court would not suppress the confession. The options that suggest it's voluntary are A, D, E, H. Now, which is the best answer.

Option D says his engagement shows understanding and voluntary waiver. That makes sense because even though he was mostly silent, he did answer some questions, indicating he was making choices.

Option H says he understood he could stop but didn't. That's also a good point.

I think the correct answer is either D or H. Wait, the question is about whether the confession is voluntary. The court would consider the totality. Since he understood his rights, didn't ask for a lawyer, and responded, it's more likely the confession is voluntary.

So looking at the options, D and H support that. The suspect's minimal participation (some answers) supports that he was voluntarily engaging, even if not extensively.

So I think the answer is D: No, the suspect's engagement in the questioning, although minimal, demonstrates an understanding and voluntary waiver of his rights.

The court is unlikely to suppress the confession as involuntary. The suspect was given Miranda warnings, which he read aloud and appeared to understand, as evidenced by his nodding affirmatively. While he refused to sign a written waiver, an oral waiver is sufficient, and his engagement with the interrogation, even minimally, suggests a level of voluntary participation. The use of a religious appeal by the detective, while potentially emotional, does not necessarily rise to the level of coercion that would render the confession involuntary. Courts consider the totality of the circumstances, and here, the suspect's understanding of his rights and his decision to answer some questions indicate a voluntary waiver. Therefore, the confession is likely to be deemed voluntary.
