The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An attorney received a document at his office with an attached note from a client for whom he had just finished drafting a will. The note read as follows: "Do you think this contract of sale for my boat complies with state law? I would have talked to you in person about this, but I'm on my way out of town. I will be back next week." The attorney reviewed the document and wrote a one-page letter to the client stating that the document complied with state law. The lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a reasonable fee. The client refused to pay the attorney anything, arguing that she had never agreed to retain the attorney and that she had received nothing of value from the attorney because the sales transaction was never concluded. Assume that there is no applicable statute or rule governing the formation of attorney-client relationships in the jurisdiction. If the attorney sues the client for the $500, will the attorney be likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the client did not sign a formal agreement with the attorney.
B: No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.
C: No, because the attorney did not confirm the fee before providing the service.
D: No, because the client's note did not explicitly ask for a billable service.
E: Yes, because the attorney provided a service that is usually billable.
F: Yes, because the client was aware that the attorney's services are typically charged.
G: Yes, because the attorney took action on the client's note to his detriment.
H: No, because even if the parties had an agreement, that agreement was discharged under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.
I: Yes, because the client benefited from the attorney's professional advice.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about an attorney and a client. Let's see, the situation is that the attorney had just finished drafting a will for the client. Then the client sent a document with a note asking if a boat sale contract complies with state law. The client was in a hurry, going out of town, so she couldn't talk in person. The attorney reviewed the document, wrote a letter saying it complies, and billed the client $500. Now, the client refuses to pay, saying she never agreed to retain the attorney and didn't get anything because the sale didn't go through.

The question is whether the attorney will prevail in suing for the $500. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should think about how attorney-client relationships are formed. Usually, a contract is formed when the client agrees to retain the attorney, and the attorney agrees to provide services. There's no formal agreement here, just the note and the attorney's response.

So, the client didn't sign anything, but she sent a document and asked a question. The attorney provided an opinion and billed her. The issue is whether there was an implied contract.

I remember that contracts can be express or implied. Express would require some clear agreement on terms, like a retainer or fee discussion. Implied would be where the parties' actions show mutual agreement. For example, if the client asks for services and the attorney provides them, expecting payment.

In this case, the client sent a document with a specific question. The attorney, having already done work for her (drafting a will), might reasonably assume she's asking for legal services again. The client's note didn't explicitly say "please bill me for this," but she did ask for an opinion. So, the attorney could argue that there was an implied agreement to pay for the services rendered.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because there's no formal agreement. But contracts don't always need to be formal, especially for attorneys. Implied contracts can be enforceable.

Option B says no because they didn't agree on essential terms. The essential terms would be the scope of work and payment. The client asked for a legal opinion, and the attorney provided it, billing a reasonable fee. So maybe the terms were implicitly agreed upon.

Option C says no because the attorney didn't confirm the fee first. It's common for attorneys to charge for their time without prior confirmation, especially with existing clients. But this client had just finished a will, so maybe they had a prior understanding of fees.

Option D says no because the note didn't explicitly ask for a billable service. But the client did ask a legal question, which is a service, so it might be implied that she expected to pay for it.

Option E says yes because the service is usually billable. That makes sense because legal opinions are typically charged services.

Option F says yes because the client knew services are charged. If she's a reasonable person, she'd know that legal services aren't free, so she might be obligated to pay.

Option G says yes because the attorney acted to his detriment. He spent time reviewing, which could be seen as detrimental reliance, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Option I says yes because the client benefited. She got a professional opinion, even if the sale didn't happen. So she received the service, so she should pay.

Now, the client's argument is that she didn't retain him and received nothing of value. But she did receive the legal opinion. The sale not going through isn't the attorney's problem; he provided the service as requested.

So, the attorney likely can recover because there was an implied contract. The client implicitly agreed to pay by submitting the document and question, and the attorney provided the service expecting payment.

Looking back at the options, E, F, and I seem possible. But E says it's billable, which is true. F says the client knew services are charged, which is reasonable. I says she benefited, which is correct.

In terms of contract law, for an implied-in-fact contract, the key is whether the client's actions implied a promise to pay. The attorney's act of providing the service could be seen as an offer, and the client's submission of the document as acceptance, with the payment expected.

So, I think the answer is E or F. Wait, but E is about the service being usually billable, which is a fact, but F is about the client's awareness. Both could apply, but which is more accurate in contract terms.

Another point is that the attorney had previously worked for her, so there might be an established relationship where she knows how fees work. So F might be a good choice.

Alternatively, the fact that the service is usually billable (E) would support the idea that an implied contract exists, regardless of prior relationship.

But wait, the question states that there's no applicable statute or rule, so it's purely about common law contract principles.

I think the key here is that the parties' conduct implies a contract. The client asked for a legal opinion, the attorney provided it, and billed her. So, the client implicitly agreed to pay for the service by requesting it.

So the answer would be E: Yes, because the attorney provided a service that is usually billable.

Wait, but let me check option F again. It says yes because the client was aware that the attorney's services are typically charged. That's also correct. But which is the better reason.

In contract law, the implied agreement focuses on the parties' conduct. If the client's actions (submitting the document and question) and the attorney's response (providing the service) indicate mutual assent, then a contract exists. The fact that such services are usually billable supports this mutual understanding.

So both E and F are pointing towards yes. But let me think about what each option states.

Option E is about the service being usually billable. So, the nature of the service implies payment.

Option F is about the client's awareness. If the client knew that the services are charged, she implicitly agreed by asking for the service.

I think the better option is E because it's about the nature of the service, which is a legal opinion, typically billable. The client's request for such a service would imply agreement to pay.

But wait, another thought: the client might argue she was just asking for a quick opinion as a follow-up to the will, expecting it to be included or not billed separately. But the attorney had already finished the will, and this was a separate matter. So, the attorney was justified in billing.

So, the conclusion is that the attorney provided a service that is typically billable, so the client is obligated to pay, making E correct.

But wait, looking back at the options, option I says yes because the client benefited. She received the advice, so she should pay. But the client's argument is that the sale wasn't concluded, so she didn't benefit. But the attorney provided the service regardless of the outcome. So, she still received the service, so she must pay.

So, I think the correct answer is E, but I'm a bit confused between E and I.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because the service is billable, but I because she received the benefit.

But in terms of contract law, the benefit is a factor, but the key is mutual assent. If the client implicitly agreed to pay by requesting the service, then the contract exists. So, I think E is the better choice.

Wait, another angle: if there was no express agreement, but the services were provided under circumstances where it's customary to charge, then the client is liable. So, that's E.

I think I'll go with E as the answer.

The question revolves around whether an implied attorney-client contract exists when the client requested a legal opinion and the attorney provided it, billing for the service. The client argues there was no explicit agreement and no benefit, but the attorney contends the service was provided and is typically billable.

For an implied contract, mutual assent can be inferred from the parties' conduct. The client submitted a document and asked for a legal opinion, which the attorney provided, billing a reasonable fee. This implies the client implicitly agreed to pay for the service. The nature of the service—a legal opinion—is typically billable, supporting the existence of an implied agreement. While the client claims no benefit because the sale did not proceed, the attorney provided the requested service, and the client received the professional advice.

Option E correctly captures this reasoning, as the service is usually billable, and the client's request implies agreement to pay. Other options, such as F (client's awareness of billable services) or I (benefit received), are relevant but less precise. The key factor is the implied agreement based on the nature of the service and the parties' actions.
