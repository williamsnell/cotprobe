Question:

A lunar module usedAerozine50 as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide (N_2 O_4, molecular weight = 92.0 g/mole) as oxidizer.Aerozine50 consists of 50 % by weight of hydrazine (N_2 H_4, molecular weight = 32.0 g/mole) and 50 % by weight of unsymmetricaldimethylhydrazine ((CH_3)_2 N_2 H_2, molecular weight = 60.0 g/mole). The chief exhaust product was water (H_2 O, molecular weight = 18.0 g/mole). Two of the reactions that led to the formation of water are the following: 2N_2 H_4 + N_2 O_4\rightarrow3N_2 + 4H_2 O (CH_3)_2 N_2 H_2 + 2N_2 O_4\rightarrow2CO_2 + 3N_2 + 4H_2 O. If we assume that these reactions were the only ones in which water was formed, how much water was produced by the ascent of the lunar module if 2200 kg ofAerozine50 were consumed in the process?

Options:

A: 1.5 × 10^3 kg of water
B: 3.0 × 10^3 kg of water
C: 2.5 × 10^3 kg of water
D: 4.0 × 10^3 kg of water
E: 1.8 × 10^3 kg of water
F: 2.2 × 10^3 kg of water
G: 3.5 × 10^3 kg of water
H: 2.0 × 10^3 kg of water
I: 1.0 × 10^3 kg of water
J: 2.8 × 10^3 kg of water

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how much water was produced when a lunar module burned Aerozine50 as fuel. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my stoichiometry, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that Aerozine50 is 50% hydrazine and 50% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine by weight. Both of these are reacting with nitrogen tetroxide to produce water. The goal is to find out the total mass of water produced when 2200 kg of Aerozine50 is consumed.

First, I think I should break down the problem. I need to consider each component of Aerozine50 separately because they have different reactions. So, each will contribute to the water production.

Let me write down the given reactions:

1. 2 N₂H₄ + N₂O₄ → 3 N₂ + 4 H₂O
2. (CH₃)₂N₂H₂ + 2 N₂O₄ → 2 CO₂ + 3 N₂ + 4 H₂O

So, each mole of hydrazine (N₂H₄) produces 2 moles of H₂O, but wait, looking again, no. Wait, the first reaction produces 4 moles of H₂O for every 2 moles of N₂H₄. So per mole of N₂H₄, it's 2 moles of H₂O. Because 4 divided by 2 is 2. Similarly, the second reaction: 1 mole of (CH₃)₂N₂H₂ produces 4 moles of H₂O. So each mole of that gives 4 H₂O.

So, for each component, I'll calculate the moles, then find out how much H₂O each contributes, sum them up, and then convert that to kilograms.

But wait, since Aerozine50 is 50% each by weight, I can split the 2200 kg into two 1100 kg parts, each from hydrazine and dimethylhydrazine.

But wait, no. Wait the percentages are by weight, so 50% of 2200 kg is 1100 kg of each component. So 1100 kg of hydrazine and 1100 kg of dimethylhydrazine.

Wait, wait, no. Is it 50% each by weight, so total is 50+50=100% for the mixture. So yes, each is 1100 kg. But wait, no, wait. 2200 kg is the total. So 50% would be 1100 kg of each. But wait, that can't be right. Because 1100 + 1100 would be 2200 kg, which is correct. So that part is okay.

So, first, I'll handle hydrazine (N₂H₄):

Molecular weight of N₂H₄ is 32.0 g/mol.

So, moles of N₂H₄ = mass / molecular weight.

Mass is 1100 kg, which is 1,100,000 grams.

Moles = 1,100,000 g / 32.0 g/mol = Let's calculate that. 1,100,000 / 32 = approximately 34,375 moles.

Now, each mole of N₂H₄ produces 2 moles of H₂O (from the first reaction, 2 moles N₂H₄ gives 4 H₂O, so 2 per mole). So moles of H₂O from hydrazine = 34,375 * 2 = 68,750 moles.

Now, for the dimethylhydrazine (CH₃)₂N₂H₂:

Molecular weight is 60.0 g/mol.

Mass is 1100 kg = 1,100,000 grams.

Moles = 1,100,000 / 60 = approximately 18,333.33 moles.

Each mole of this gives 4 moles of H₂O. So moles of H₂O from dimethylhydrazine = 18,333.33 *4 = 73,333.33 moles.

Now, total moles of H₂O = 68,750 + 73,333.33 = 142,083.33 moles.

Now, the molecular weight of H₂O is 18.0 g/mol. So mass of H₂O is 142,083.33 * 18 g = ?

Let me compute that: 142,083.33 *18.

Well, 140,000 *18 = 2,520,000.

2,083.33 *18: 2000 *18=36,000; 83.33 *18≈1,500. So approx 36,000 + 1,500 = 37,500.

So total ≈ 2,520,000 + 37,500 = 2,557,500 grams, which is 2,557.5 kg.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me do it more accurately.

142,083.33 * 18 = ?

Let me compute 142,083.33 * 10 = 1,420,833.3

142,083.33 * 8 = 1,136,666.64

Adding them: 1,420,833.3 + 1,136,666.64 = 2,557,500 (approximately, since 1,420,833 + 1,136,666 is 2,557,500).

So 2,557,500 grams is 2,557.5 kg.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A: 1.5e3 kg

B:3e3

C:2.5e3

D:4e3

E:1.8e3

F:2.2e3

G:3.5e3

H:2e3

I:1e3

J:2.8e3

Wait, 2,557.5 kg is approximately 2.5575e3 kg. So looking at the options, the closest is J: 2.8e3, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the moles. Let me recalculate the moles more accurately.

First, for hydrazine:

Mass = 1100 kg = 1,100,000 g.

Molecular weight =32 g/mol.

Moles = 1,100,000 /32 = 34,375 moles.

Yes, that's correct.

Each mole gives 2 H₂O, so 34,375 *2 =68,750 moles H₂O.

Dimethylhydrazine:

Mass =1100 kg = 1,100,000 g.

Molecular weight=60 g/mol.

Moles=1,100,000 /60 = approx 18,333.3333 moles.

Each mole gives 4 H₂O, so 18,333.3333 *4 =73,333.3332 moles.

Total H₂O moles: 68,750 +73,333.3332 = 142,083.3332.

Molecular weight H₂O is 18 g/mol, so mass =142,083.3332 *18 = ?

Let me do this more accurately.

142,083.3332 *18:

Let me break it down:

142,083.3332 * 10 = 1,420,833.332

142,083.3332 *8 = 1,136,666.6656

Adding together:

1,420,833.332 +1,136,666.6656 = 2,557,500 kg? No, wait, that's grams, right? Because 18g/mol * moles gives grams.

Wait, no, wait. 142,083.3332 moles * 18 g/mol = 2,557,500 grams.

Which is 2,557.5 kg. So approximately 2,557.5 kg.

Looking at the options, J is 2.8e3 kg, which is 2800 kg. Hmm, 2557.5 is closer to option C: 2.5e3 (2500 kg), but it's closer to 2.5575e3. Alternatively, perhaps there's a calculation error.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the moles.

Wait, let's double-check:

Hydrazine:

1100 kg is 1,100,000 grams.

Divide by 32 g/mol: 1,100,000 /32 = 34,375 moles. Correct.

H2O per mole: 2, so 34,375 *2 =68,750 moles H2O.

Dimethylhydrazine:

1100 kg is 1,100,000 grams.

Divide by 60 g/mol: 1,100,000 /60 =18,333.3333 moles.

Each gives 4 H2O: 18,333.3333 *4 =73,333.3332.

Total H2O:68,750 +73,333.3332 =142,083.3332 moles.

Mass:142,083.3332 *18 = ?

Calculating 142,083.3332 *18.

18 *142,083.3332 = ?

Well, 142,083.3332 * 18 = let's compute 142,083 *18.

142,083 * 18:

Let me compute 142,000 *18 = 2,556,000.

83 *18 = 1,494.

So total approx 2,556,000 +1,494 =2,557,494 grams. So 2,557.494 kg, which is about 2,557.5 kg.

So the options don't have exactly this number. The closest is option C: 2.5e3 (2500) and option J:2.8e3 (2800). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the stoichiometry in terms of the oxidizer. Because the problem states that the two reactions are the only ones producing water, but perhaps the oxidizer is the same for both. Oh no, wait, the problem just gives the two reactions, and says that these are the only reactions producing H2O. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the mass of each fuel first.

Wait, another approach: Maybe each reaction produces a certain amount of H2O per unit mass of fuel. So perhaps I should compute the H2O per kg of each fuel, then multiply by the mass used.

Let me think. For each component, find the mass of H2O produced per kg of fuel.

Starting with hydrazine (N2H4):

Reaction: 2 N2H4 + N2O4 → products +4 H2O.

So for every 2 moles of N2H4, 4 moles of H2O are produced.

Molar mass of N2H4 is 32 g/mol.

So 2 moles of N2H4 have a mass of 2*32=64 grams.

Each 64 grams of N2H4 produces 4 moles of H2O, which is 4*18=72 grams.

So per gram of N2H4, the H2O produced is 72 g /64 g = 1.125 g H2O per g N2H4.

Similarly, for dimethylhydrazine ((CH3)2N2H2):

Reaction: 1 mole + 2 N2O4 → products +4 H2O.

Molar mass of (CH3)2N2H2 is 60 g/mol.

1 mole of it produces 4 moles H2O, which is 72 grams.

So per gram of dimethylhydrazine, the H2O is 72g /60g = 1.2 g H2O per g.

So now, for each component:

Hydrazine: 1100 kg =1,100,000 g. Each gram gives 1.125 g H2O.

So total H2O from hydrazine: 1,100,000 *1.125 = ?

1,100,000 *1 =1,100,000

1,100,000 *0.125=137,500

Total: 1,237,500 g =1,237.5 kg.

Dimethylhydrazine: 1100 kg =1,100,000 g.

Each gram gives 1.2 g H2O.

So 1,100,000 *1.2=1,320,000 g=1,320 kg.

Total H2O:1,237.5 +1,320=2,557.5 kg.

Same result as before. So that's consistent.

So the answer should be approximately 2,557.5 kg, but looking at the options, that's not an option. The closest is option J:2.8e3 (2800kg), but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, option C is 2.5e3, but that's 2,500, which is also lower than our value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me try once again.

Wait, perhaps the way I split the Aerozine50 is incorrect. Wait, because the problem says 50% by weight of each. So the total mass is 2200 kg, so 50% is 1100 kg of each. That part seems correct.

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for the oxidizer? No, the problem says that the two reactions are the only ones that produce water, so the stoichiometry considers the amount of each fuel and the required oxidizer, but in our approach, we're only considering the fuel's moles because the water comes from the fuel's hydrogen, perhaps. Or maybe the oxidizer contributes as well. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the complete combustion.

Wait, in the first reaction, hydrazine and N2O4 produce H2O. The same for the second. So in each reaction, the amount of H2O depends on the amount of fuel burned, regardless of the oxidizer. So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the H2O based on the fuel's hydrogen content. Because H2O is H and O. So perhaps that's another way, but I'm not sure.

Let me think. Hydrazine is N2H4. So each molecule has 4 H atoms. Similarly, dimethylhydrazine is (CH3)2N2H2: each molecule has 2 H atoms attached to N, plus 2*6 H from the two CH3 groups. Wait, no, the formula is (CH3)2N2H2, so the molecule has two methyl groups (each CH3 has 3 H), so two *3 =6 H, plus the H2: so total 8 H per molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moles of H in each fuel and then determine H2O.

Because each H2O has 2 H, so the total H in the fuel will determine the H2O.

But wait, in the reactions, the H comes from the fuel. So perhaps it's easier to compute the moles of H in each fuel and then see how much H2O they can make.

Let's try that.

For hydrazine (N2H4):

Each mole has 4 H atoms.

So 34,375 moles of N2H4 → 34,375 *4 =137,500 moles of H.

Each mole of H2O has 2 H, so 137,500 /2 =68,750 moles of H2O.

Which matches what I had earlier.

For dimethylhydrazine ((CH3)2N2H2):

Each mole has how many H? Let's count:

Each CH3 group has 3 H, so 2 CH3 groups contribute 6 H. Plus the H2 part: 2 H. So total 8 H per mole.

So 18,333.3333 moles *8 H =146,666.6664 moles H.

Each H2O has 2 H, so 146,666.6664 /2 =73,333.3332 moles H2O.

Again, same as before.

So total H2O is 142,083.3332 moles. Multiply by 18 g/mol gives 2,557.5 kg.

So I think my calculation is correct. Now, looking at the options, the closest one is J:2.8e3 kg, but that's 2800, which is about 242.5 kg higher than my result. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to approximate in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial splitting. Wait, 2200 kg of Aerozine50 is 50% each, so 1100 kg each. So 1100 kg each is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the molecular weights were considered differently. Let me recheck the molecular weights.

N2H4: molecular weight is 32.0 g/mol. Correct.

(CH3)2N2H2: molecular weight is 60.0 g/mol. Correct.

H2O: 18.0 g/mol. Correct.

N2O4: 92.0 g/mol, but not used here.

So I think that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the mass of the oxidizer and then compute the limiting reagent, but the problem states that these are the only reactions that produce water, so perhaps the stoichiometry is such that all the fuel is consumed with the necessary oxidizer, so the water is based purely on the fuel's contribution.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the mass of each reactant is 2200 kg, but no, the problem says 2200 kg of Aerozine50 were consumed. So the 2200 kg is the fuel, and the oxidizer is another mass, but the question only asks about the fuel's part in producing H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the answer in the options. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A:1.5e3 →1500

B:3.0e3 →3000

C:2.5e3 →2500

D:4.0e3 →4000

E:1.8e3 →1800

F:2.2e3 →2200

G:3.5e3 →3500

H:2.0e3 →2000

I:1.0e3 →1000

J:2.8e3 →2800

My result is 2557.5 kg,
