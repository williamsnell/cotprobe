Question:

Farmer Fred was the owner of Grapeview Farm, the largest farm in the County of Grapeview. Fred was advised by his gift and estate attorney to begin making annual fractionalized gifts of the property to his children. Fred executed a conveyance instrument, stating the gifts as "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property is hereby given to all my children per capita." This description of the land to be conveyed is

Options:

A: Sufficient, because it gives a clear description of the fractional gift.
B: Sufficient, because it mentions the name of the county and the property.
C: Sufficient, because it includes the name of the property and a portion of it.
D: Insufficient, because it doesn't state the exact measurements of the land to be given.
E: Insufficient, because the gifts to the children lacked consideration.
F: Insufficient, because it doesn't specify the exact location of the eastern one-tenth.
G: Insufficient, because it is too vague.
H: Sufficient, because the property can be identified.
I: Sufficient, because it satisfies the title of seisin.

Okay, so I've got this question about property law, specifically regarding the sufficiency of a description in a conveyance instrument. Hmm, let's see. So Farmer Fred owns Grapeview Farm, which is the largest in the county. He wants to make annual fractionalized gifts to his children. His attorney suggested this, so I guess it's about estate planning, maybe estate tax reasons.

He executed a conveyance instrument. The wording is: "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property is hereby given to all my children per capita." Wait, Grapeview County? Or Grapeview Farm? Oh, maybe that's a typo, but I think it's the farm he's referring to.

The question is whether this description is sufficient. The options are from A to J, but the possible answers are A through H, I think. Anyway, the key issue is whether the description in the conveyance is legally sufficient.

I remember that for a conveyance to be valid, the description of the property must be sufficient to allow a person to identify and locate the property. It doesn't need to be precise measurements, but it should be enough so that someone can find the property without guessing.

So the description here mentions "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. Is he giving each child a fraction of the property? Or is he dividing the property into parts?

Wait, the gift is "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest." So he's giving each child 1/30th? Or is he giving a portion of the land, like a specific section. The description also says "eastern one tenth of the western corner." So the western corner of the property is a specific area, and he's taking the eastern tenth of that? Or is it the eastern part that's one-tenth of the western corner?

Hmm, maybe it's worded as the eastern one tenth of the western corner. So, the western corner is a specific part of the property. Then, from that, he's taking the eastern one-tenth. So, maybe a smaller section within the western corner. But is that description clear enough?

I think the key here is that the description must be clear enough so that a surveyor or someone can identify the exact parcel. If it's just a fraction without specific measurements or references, it might be insufficient. So, for example, saying "the eastern one-tenth of the western corner" – does that give clear boundaries? Or is it too vague?

Wait, but he also mentions the property is in Grapeview County, which probably is a known location, and the property is the largest farm there, so maybe that helps in identification. But the specific part being conveyed is the eastern one-tenth of the western corner. Is that enough?

I think in property law, the description needs to be sufficient to identify the property without resorting to guesswork. So if it's based on fractions and parts without specific measurements, it might be too vague. For example, if the property is a certain size, and you say "the eastern one-tenth of the western corner," that might not be precise enough because someone might not know exactly where that is without more specifics.

So looking at the options, let's see. Option A says it's sufficient because it gives a clear fractional gift. But wait, the problem is the description of the land, not the fractional interest. So the fact that it's a fractional ownership (like 1/30th) is one thing, but the description of the specific part of the land is another.

Option B: Sufficient because it mentions the county and property name. Well, that helps in identifying the property, but the specific part being conveyed might still be vague.

Option C: Sufficient because it includes the property name and a portion. But that portion is described as eastern one-tenth of the western corner, which might not be precise enough.

Option D: Insufficient because it doesn't state exact measurements. That's a possibility. If the description lacks specific measurements, it might be too vague. But sometimes, descriptions can be sufficient without exact measurements if they refer to identifiable parts.

Option E: Insufficient because it lacks consideration. Wait, but this is a gift, so consideration isn't required. So E is probably not correct.

Option F: Insufficient because it doesn't specify the exact location. So the description doesn't give enough detail to locate the eastern one-tenth precisely.

Option G: Insufficient because it's too vague. That's a general statement, but is it accurate?

Option H: Sufficient because the property can be identified. But the issue is not the entire property, but the specific part conveyed.

Option I: Sufficient because it satisfies seisin. I'm not too sure about this; seisin refers to possession, and the description might not affect seisin directly.

So putting it together, the description needs to be clear enough for identification. The mention of the eastern one-tenth of the western corner might not be precise. Without knowing the exact dimensions or reference points, it's vague. So the description is insufficient because it's too vague or lacks exact measurements.

Wait, but sometimes fractional descriptions can be sufficient if they refer to known parts. For example, "the northern half" of a known parcel is clear. But here, it's "eastern one-tenth of the western corner." The western corner is a specific point, but taking a tenth from the east part of that corner might not be clear enough.

So I think the correct answer is either D, F, or G.

Option D says it's insufficient because it doesn't state exact measurements. Option F says it's insufficient because it doesn't specify the exact location. Option G says it's insufficient because it's too vague.

Which one is more accurate? The description is vague because it uses fractions without clear reference points. So G might be the choice. Alternatively, D could be correct if the issue is lack of measurements.

Wait, the description doesn't mention any measurements. It just says "eastern one-tenth of the western corner." That's a fraction, but without knowing the size of the western corner, you can't determine the exact area. So it's vague because it's based on fractions of parts that aren't clearly defined.

So the answer is likely G: insufficient because it's too vague.

Wait, but let's think again. The entire property is in Grapeview County, and it's the largest farm, so perhaps the description is sufficient because the property is well-known. So maybe someone could identify the western corner and then take the eastern tenth of that. But without more details, like how the western corner is defined, it's unclear. So it's still too vague.

So I think the right answer is G: insufficient because it's too vague.

The question revolves around whether the description in Farmer Fred's conveyance instrument is sufficient to identify the property being gifted. The description provided is: "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property is hereby given to all my children per capita." The key issue is whether this description meets the legal requirement of being clear and specific enough to identify the property without ambiguity.

For a conveyance to be valid, the description must allow someone to locate and identify the property without resorting to guesswork. While the description mentions the property's name and location in Grapeview County, the specific part being conveyed—"the eastern one-tenth of the western corner"—lacks precision. Without exact measurements or clear reference points, this description is too vague to identify the exact parcel of land being gifted. Although fractional descriptions can sometimes be sufficient if they refer to identifiable parts, the lack of specific details here makes the description inadequate.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, H**: These options suggest sufficiency based on factors like fractional gifts, county and property name, or identifiability. However, the issue lies in the specific description of the land, which is too vague.
- **D, F**: These focus on the lack of exact measurements or precise location. While relevant, the broader issue is the overall vagueness of the description.
- **E**: This is incorrect because consideration is not required for a gift.
- **G**: This correctly identifies the core issue—that the description is too vague to allow precise identification of the property.

Given the analysis, the description is insufficient because it is too vague, making **G** the correct answer.

Answer: G
