Okay, so I've got this question about the angular separation of a double star that can be resolved by the Mount Wilson reflecting telescope. Hmm, I remember that resolving power has something to do with the telescope's ability to distinguish between two close objects in the sky. Oh right, it's about the diffraction limit, I think.

Wait, the formula I remember is something like theta equals lambda over (2 times pi times a), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's theta equals 1.22 lambda over the diameter of the telescope. Oh yeah, the Rayleigh criterion, right? The formula is theta (in radians) equals 1.22 times the wavelength divided by the diameter of the telescope's aperture.

So the question gives the diameter as 100 inches. But wait, I need to make sure the units are all consistent. I think the standard wavelength used is around 550 nm, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. Let me confirm that. Oh yeah, for visible light, about 550 nanometers is typical.

Wait, but the answer is in seconds of arc. So I'll have to convert radians to seconds. Because 1 radian is a huge angle, like 57 degrees. So we'll need to convert to arcseconds.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Use the Rayleigh formula: theta (radians) = 1.22 * lambda / D
2. Convert theta from radians to seconds of arc.
3. Plug in numbers: lambda is in meters, D in meters as well.

Wait, I should make sure the units for D and lambda are the same. Lambda is 550 nm, which is 550e-9 meters. D is 100 inches. Oh wait, I need to convert inches to meters because the formula requires meters.

Hmm, how many meters are in an inch? I think 1 inch is approximately 0.0254 meters. So 100 inches is 100 * 0.0254 = 2.54 meters. So D=2.54 m.

So plugging into the formula: theta = 1.22 * 550e-9 m / 2.54 m.

Calculate that: Let's compute the numerator first. 1.22 * 550e-9 = 1.22 * 5.5e-7. 1.22 times 5 is 6.1, 1.22 times 0.5 is 0.61, so 6.1 + 0.61 = 6.71, so 6.71e-7. So theta is 6.71e-7 radians divided by 2.54.

Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Wait, no, 1.22 * 550e-9 = 1.22 * 5.5e-7. Let me calculate it correctly. 550e-9 is 5.5e-7. So 1.22 * 5.5e-7 = (1.22 * 5.5) * 1e-7. 1.22 *5 is 6.1, 1.22 *0.5 is 0.61. So 6.1+0.61=6.71. So 6.71e-7.

Then divide by 2.54: 6.71e-7 / 2.54 = let's see, 6.71 / 2.54 is about 2.64, so 2.64e-7 radians.

But wait, that's in radians. I need to convert this to seconds of arc. How do I do that?

I remember that 1 radian is 57.3 degrees, and each degree is 60 arcminutes, each minute is 60 arcseconds. So 1 radian is approximately 206265 arcseconds. Because 57.3 * 60 * 60 = 205,800, which I've heard as about 206,264.8 arcseconds, which is approximately 206265 arcseconds per radian.

So to convert theta from radians to arcseconds, I multiply by 206265.

So theta (arcseconds) = 2.64e-7 radians * 206265 arcseconds/radian.

Let me calculate that. 2.64e-7 * 2e5 is approximately 5.28e-2. Wait, 2.64e-7 * 2.06265e5.

Let me compute this more accurately.

2.64e-7 * 2.06265e5 = (2.64 * 2.06265) * (1e-7 * 1e5) = let's compute 2.64 * 2.06265.

2.64 * 2 =5.28, 2.64 *0.06265≈0.165. So total is about 5.28 + 0.165 = 5.445.

So 5.445 * 1e-2 = 0.05445 arcseconds. Which is 5.445e-2 arcseconds.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Because 2.64e-7 multiplied by 2.06265e5 is (2.64 * 2.06265) times 1e-7+5 = 1e-2. So 2.64 * 2.06265 ≈ 5.445, so 5.445e-2, which is 0.05445 arcseconds, which is 5.445e-2 arcseconds.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A through J.

Option A is 5.5e-2. Wait, 5.5e-2 is 0.055, which is a bit higher than our 0.05445. But that's close. Or did I make a calculation mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

First, compute the exact value:

lambda = 550 nm = 550e-9 m.

D = 100 inches = 2.54 m.

theta_rad = 1.22 * lambda / D = 1.22 * 550e-9 / 2.54.

Calculate the numerator: 1.22 * 550 = 671. So 671e-9 meters.

671e-9 / 2.54 = approx 264.49e-9, which is 2.6449e-7 radians.

Then, 2.6449e-7 radians * 206265 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.6449e-7 * 206265.

206265 is about 2.06265e5.

Multiply 2.6449e-7 by 2.06265e5:

(2.6449 * 2.06265) * 1e-7+5 = (5.453) * 1e-2.

So 0.05453 arcseconds, which is 5.453e-2.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.5e-2, which is 0.055. That's very close. But wait, are there any other options closer?

Wait, option H is 1.22e-2, which is smaller. Option G is 2.5e-2, which is 0.025. Option J is 7.85e-3, which is about 0.00785. Option B is 1.22e-3, even smaller.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait another approach: 1.22 * 550e-9 / 2.54 = let's compute that.

1.22 * 550 = 671. So 671e-9 / 2.54 = (671 / 2.54) * 1e-9.

671 / 2.54: Let's compute that. 2.54 * 264 = 2.54 * 200 = 508, 2.54 *64=162.56. So 508+162.56=670.56. So 671 is about 264.49. So 264.49e-9, which is 2.6449e-7 radians.

Multiply by 206265 arcseconds per radian:

2.6449e-7 * 206265 = ?

Compute 2.6449e-7 * 2e5 = 5.289e-2.

But 206265 is 2.06265e5, so 2.6449e-7 * 2.06265e5 = (2.6449 * 2.06265) * 1e-7+5 = (approx 5.453) * 1e-2 = 0.05453, which is 5.453e-2 arcseconds.

So 0.0545 is approximately 5.45e-2 seconds of arc.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.5e-2. That's very close. So perhaps option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, I thought the formula is 1.22 lambda / (diameter). Oh but wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, the formula is 1.22 lambda divided by the diameter, yes.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake with the wavelength. Because sometimes the formula uses lambda in the same units as the diameter. Oh but in this case, I converted inches to meters, and lambda is in meters, so that should be okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is theta (in arcseconds) equals (1.22 * lambda_in_mm) / (diameter_mm) ) * (180/pi * 3600) ). No, that's complicating.

Wait, another approach: I remember a rule of thumb that the resolving power in arcseconds is approximately 0.5 divided by the diameter in inches. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right because a 100-inch telescope would have 0.5/100=0.005, which is 5e-3, but that's not matching any of the options except maybe option J which is 7.85e-3.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again.

The Rayleigh criterion is theta (radians) = 1.22 lambda / (D). To get to arcseconds, theta (arcsec) = (1.22 * lambda (meters) / D (meters)) ) * (180 * 3600 / pi ) ). Because 1 radian is 180*3600/pi arcseconds.

So let me compute:

lambda is 550e-9 m.

D is 2.54 m.

So theta_rad = 1.22 *550e-9 / 2.54 = 6.71e-7.

Then, theta_arcsec = theta_rad * (180 * 3600 / pi).

Compute 180 * 3600 = 648000. 648000 / pi ≈ 206264.8.

So theta_arcsec = 6.71e-7 * 2.062648e5.

Wait, 6.71e-7 * 2.062648e5 = let's compute this.

6.71e-7 = 6.71 * 1e-7

2.062648e5 = 2.062648 * 1e5

Multiply: 6.71 * 2.062648 ≈ let's calculate that.

6 *2=12, 6*0.062648≈0.3759, 0.71*2=1.42, 0.71*0.062648≈0.04445.

Adding up: 12 + 0.3759 =12.3759 +1.42=13.7959 +0.04445≈13.84035.

So 13.84035 * 1e-7+5 = 1e-2. So 0.1384 arcseconds, which is 1.384e-1 arcseconds, which is 0.1384.

Wait, this can't be right because earlier I thought the answer was around 0.0545, but this approach is giving me 0.1384. What's going on?

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:

6.71e-7 * 2.06265e5.

Wait, 6.71e-7 = 6.71 * 1e-7.

2.06265e5 = 2.06265 * 1e5.

Multiply 6.71 * 2.06265:

Let me compute 6 * 2.06265 = 12.3759.

0.71 * 2.06265:

0.7 *2.06265=1.443685.

0.01 *2.06265=0.0206265.

So 1.443685 + 0.0206265 = 1.4643115.

So total is 12.3759 + 1.4643115 = 13.8402115.

So 13.8402 * 1e-7 * 1e5 = 13.8402 * 1e-2 = 0.138402.

So theta_arcsec is approximately 0.1384 seconds of arc, which is 1.384e-1.

Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 0.0545. So now I'm getting conflicting results. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. I thought the formula was 1.22 lambda/(D), but maybe it's lambda/(2D) or something else.

Wait, no, the Rayleigh formula is indeed 1.22 lambda / (D), where D is the diameter.

Wait another thought: Oh wait, perhaps I should have used the wavelength in angstroms? No, the formula is in the same units as the diameter.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have converted the diameter to millimeters instead of meters.

Wait, let me try that approach.

Diameter D = 100 inches. 1 inch is 25.4 mm, so 100 *25.4 = 2540 mm.

lambda = 550 nm = 550e-9 m = 550e-6 mm = 0.55 micrometers.

So theta_rad = 1.22 * lambda (mm) / D (mm) = 1.22 * 0.55 / 2540.

Wait, 0.55 is in mm? No, wait: 550 nm is 0.00055 mm. So 0.00055 mm.

So 1.22 * 0.00055 = 0.000671.

Divide by 2540 mm: 0.000671 /2540 = approx 2.64e-7 radians.

Wait, that's same as before. So same result.

Then, converting to arcseconds: 2.64e-7 * 206265 ≈ 0.0545.

Wait, so why when I did the other approach I got 0.1384? Oh wait, because I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, in the second approach, I had theta_rad = 6.71e-7, which I then multiplied by 2.06e5 to get 0.1384.

But wait, 6.71e-7 * 2.06e5 is 6.71e-7 * 2.06e5.

6.71e-7 = 6.71 *1e-7.

2.06e5 = 2.06 *1e5.

Multiply 6.71 *2.06 = approx 13.8.

So 13.8 * 1e-7+5 = 13.8e-2, which is 0.138.

But wait, earlier calculation when I did 2.64e-7 * 2.06e5 gave 0.0545.

Wait, but 6.71e-7 is bigger than 2.64e-7. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps I confused the exponent. Let me recompute theta_rad.

Wait, 1.22 *550e-9 / 2.54.

Compute 550e-9 = 5.5e-7.

So 1.22 *5.5e-7 = 6.71e-7.

Divide by 2.54: 6.71e-7 / 2.54 = approximately 2.64e-7 radians.

Yes, that's correct. So theta_rad = 2.64e-7 radians.

Multiply by 2.06265e5 to get arcseconds: 2.64e-7 *2.06265e5.

Which is (2.64 *2.06265) *1e-7+5 = (5.453) *1e-2 = 0.05453.

So that's approximately 0.0545 arcseconds, which is 5.45e-2 seconds.

Looking back at the options, option A is 5.5e-2, which is 0.055, very close to 0.0545.

But wait, another thought. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is 1.22 * lambda/(D), but I've seen some sources use the formula theta (arcseconds) = 13600 / (D in mm) ), where D is in millimeters and lambda is 550 nm.

Wait, let's try that approach. D is 100 inches. Convert to mm: 100 *25.4 = 2540 mm.

So theta = 13600 / 2540 ≈ 5.354 arcseconds? That's way larger than before. But that can't be right because a larger telescope should have better resolution, so a smaller theta.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is (1.22 * lambda) / (diameter in same units) gives theta in radians. Alternatively, the formula in arcseconds is (lambda (in nm)) / (aperture in mm) multiplied by some constant.

Wait, another approach. Let me look up the formula for resolving power in arcseconds.

The formula is often written as: theta (arcseconds) ≈ (lambda / (D)) * (180 * 3600 / pi), where lambda is in meters, D in meters.

So lambda = 550e-9 m.

D = 2.54 m.

So theta = (550e-9 /2.54) * (180 *3600 / pi).

Compute this.

First, compute 550e-9 /2.54 = approx 2.165e-7.

Then multiply by (180 *3600 / pi) = (648000 / 3.1416) ≈ 206264.8.

So theta = 2.165e-7 * 2.062648e5
