Okay, so I need to figure out the answers to these two statements and then choose the correct option from A to J. Let's take each statement one by one.

Starting with Statement 1: "Q is an extension field of Z_2." Hmm, wait, Q is the field of rational numbers, right? And Z_2 is the field with two elements, {0,1}, usually representing integers modulo 2. An extension field is a field that contains another field. So for Q to be an extension of Z_2, Z_2 must be a subfield of Q. But wait, Z_2 has characteristic 2, and Q has characteristic 0. I remember that fields with different characteristics can't have one be a subfield of the other. Because the characteristic is the smallest positive number of times you add the multiplicative identity to get zero. Since Q's char is 0, and Z_2's is 2, they can't be subfields. So Statement 1 must be false.

Now, Statement 2: "Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field." I think this relates to the concept of extension fields providing roots for polynomials. I remember something about every non-constant polynomial having roots in its algebraic closure. So for any field F, there exists an algebraic extension where the polynomial splits into linear factors. But the statement here says "some extension field," not necessarily the algebraic closure. So, yes, any non-constant polynomial will have at least one root in some extension field of F. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.

So, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. Now looking at the options, which option has False and True in order. Looking at the options:

Option B is False, True. So the correct choice is B.

Statement 1: "Q is an extension field of Z_2."  
- Q (the field of rational numbers) has characteristic 0, while Z_2 (the field with two elements) has characteristic 2. Fields with different characteristics cannot have one be a subfield of the other. Therefore, **Statement 1 is False**.

Statement 2: "Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field."  
- This is true because, for any field, there exists an extension field (specifically an algebraic extension) where every non-constant polynomial has a root. Thus, **Statement 2 is True**.

Combining these results, the correct option is **B: False, True**.

Answer: B
