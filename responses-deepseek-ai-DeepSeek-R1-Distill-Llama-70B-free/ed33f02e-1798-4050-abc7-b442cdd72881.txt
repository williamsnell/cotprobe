Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the molecular weight of a protein based on osmotic pressure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that a 1% solution gives an osmotic pressure of 46 mm of H2O at 0°C. And we're to assume it's an ideal solution. I remember that osmotic pressure relates to concentration, and there's a formula for that. Oh right, the formula is π = iMRT. Wait, but for dilute solutions, especially proteins which are large, the van't Hoff factor i might be 1, right? Because proteins don't dissociate much in solution, especially at their isoelectric point where they have no charge. So i would be 1 here. 

So the formula simplifies to π = MRT. But wait, M is the molarity here. Molarity is moles per liter. But the solution is 1% by mass. Oh right, 1% means 1 gram per 100 grams of solution. Since the solution is dilute, I can approximate 100 grams as 0.1 kg, but wait, for the volume, water is about 1 kg per liter, so 100 grams is 0.1 liters. Or wait, no, 1% solution is 1g per 100ml? No, wait, 1% by mass is 1g per 100g of solution. Since the density of water is roughly 1g/cm³, 100g of solution is about 0.1 liters (100 ml).

Wait, 100g solution is approx 0.1 kg, but for volume, since density is about 1g/ml, 100g is 100 ml which is 0.1 liters. So, the concentration in terms of mass per volume would be 1g per 0.1 liter, which is 10 g/L.

But how does that translate into molarity? Molarity is moles per liter. So I need to find how many moles are in 1 gram of the protein, and then multiply by 10 (since it's 10 g/L) to get the molarity.

Wait, no. Let's think again. 1% solution is 1g protein in 100g solution. The volume of the solution is approximately 100 ml or 0.1 liters. So the mass of solute per liter is (1g / 0.1 L) = 10 g/L. So the molarity M is (10 g/L) divided by molecular weight (Mw) in g/mol. So M = 10 / Mw.

Wait, I might have messed that up. Let me restate. The solution is 1g of solute per 100g of solution. Since the solution's volume is about 100 ml (0.1 L), then per liter, that's 10 times as much. So 1g/0.1 L is 10 g/L. So molarity M is (10 g/L) / Mw, where Mw is the molecular weight in g/mol. Because moles = mass / Mw, and molarity is moles per liter.

So M = (10 / Mw) mol/L.

Now, the osmotic pressure π is given by π = MRT. But wait, what are the units here? π is given in mm H2O, but I think we need to convert that into atmospheres because R is usually in terms of L·atm/(mol·K).

Right, because R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So first, convert 46 mm H2O to atmospheres. How to do that?

I remember that 1 atm is about 760 mm Hg. But wait, this is mm H2O. Water is less dense than mercury. Oh right, 1 atm is 760 mm Hg, but for water, the pressure per mm is less. Wait, how much does each mm of water contribute in terms of pressure?

The conversion factor: 1 atm = 10.33 meters of water. Because water's density is about 1000 kg/m³, and g is 9.81 m/s². So the pressure from a column of water is given by P = ρgh. For 1 atm, ρ is 1000 kg/m³, g is 9.81, so h = P/(ρg) = 1 atm / (1000 * 9.81). But 1 atm is about 101325 Pascals. So h = 101325 / (1000 * 9.81) ≈ 10.33 meters. So 1 atm ≈ 10.33 m H2O, which is 10330 mm H2O.

So 46 mm H2O is 46 / 10330 atm. Let me calculate that. 46 divided by 10330. Hmm, 46 / 10330 ≈ 0.004455 atm.

Wait, let me double-check that. 10330 mm is 1 atm. So 46 mm is 46/10330 atm. Let me compute 46/10330. 46 divided by 10330. Let's see, 10330 * 0.004 is 41.32. So 0.0044 would be 10330 * 0.0044 = approx 45.45. Close to 46. So 46 mm H2O is approximately 0.00445 atm.

Now, the temperature is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. So plugging into π = MRT:

π = M * R * T.

We have π ≈ 0.00445 atm, R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T = 273 K.

So M = π/(R*T) = 0.00445 / (0.0821 * 273) 

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.0821 * 273 ≈ 22.41 (since 0.08 * 273 = 21.84, and 0.0021*273≈0.5733, total ≈22.41). 

So M ≈ 0.00445 / 22.41 ≈ 0.0001986 mol/L.

Wait, but earlier I thought M was also equal to (10 g/L) / Mw. So:

M = 10 / Mw = 0.0001986.

Solving for Mw: Mw = 10 / 0.0001986 ≈ 50300 g/mol.

Wait, that's 50,300 g/mol. Let me check the options. Option G is 50,300 g/mole. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps for any possible mistake.

Another approach: Maybe I should have used the formula for osmotic pressure in terms of mass concentration.

Wait, another formula is π = (cRT)/Mw, where c is the concentration in mass per volume (like g/L). Because c (g/L) divided by Mw (g/mol) gives mol/L, which is M.

So π = (c * R * T) / Mw.

So in this case, c is 10 g/L.

So rearranged, Mw = (c R T) / π.

But wait, π must be in atm. So let me plug in the numbers.

c = 10 g/L.

R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T =273 K.

π is 46 mm H2O, which we converted to 0.00445 atm.

So Mw = (10 * 0.0821 * 273) / 0.00445.

Compute numerator: 10 * 0.0821 = 0.821. 0.821 *273 ≈ 224.0 (because 0.8 *273=218.4, 0.021*273≈5.73, total 224.13).

Denominator: 0.00445.

So Mw ≈ 224.13 / 0.00445 ≈ 50300 g/mol. Yep, same as before.

So the molecular weight is about 50,300 g/mol. Looking at the options, option G is 50,300 g/mole.

To calculate the molecular weight of the isoelectric protein, we use the relationship between osmotic pressure and molarity, given by the formula:

\[
\pi = MRT
\]

where:
- \( \pi \) is the osmotic pressure,
- \( M \) is the molarity,
- \( R \) is the ideal gas constant (\( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Convert osmotic pressure to atmospheres
The osmotic pressure is given as \( 46 \, \text{mm H}_2\text{O} \). Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 10330 \, \text{mm H}_2\text{O} \), we calculate:

\[
\pi = \frac{46}{10330} \approx 0.00445 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 2: Express molarity in terms of molecular weight
The solution is 1% by mass, meaning 1 g of protein is dissolved in 100 g of solution. Assuming the density of water (\( \rho \approx 1 \, \text{g/mL} \)), the volume of the solution is approximately \( 0.1 \, \text{L} \). Thus, the mass concentration is:

\[
c = \frac{1 \, \text{g}}{0.1 \, \text{L}} = 10 \, \text{g/L}.
\]

Molarity (\( M \)) is related to mass concentration (\( c \)) and molecular weight (\( M_w \)) by:

\[
M = \frac{c}{M_w}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for molecular weight
Substituting \( M = \frac{c}{M_w} \) into \( \pi = MRT \), we get:

\[
\pi = \frac{cRT}{M_w}.
\]

Rearranging for \( M_w \):

\[
M_w = \frac{cRT}{\pi}.
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( c = 10 \, \text{g/L} \),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \),
- \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \),
- \( \pi = 0.00445 \, \text{atm} \).

\[
M_w = \frac{(10)(0.0821)(273)}{0.00445}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(10)(0.0821)(273) \approx 224.13.
\]

Then, divide by \( 0.00445 \):

\[
M_w \approx \frac{224.13}{0.00445} \approx 50300 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The molecular weight of the protein is approximately **50,300 g/mol**, which corresponds to option **G**.
