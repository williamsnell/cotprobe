Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let me read it again. It says that I have to calculate the number of milliliters of 0.025 M H3PO4 required to neutralize 25 ml of 0.030 M Ca(OH)2. And then choose the right option from A to J.

Alright, first, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form a salt and water. H3PO4 is phosphoric acid, which is a triprotic acid. That means it can donate three protons. Wait, but in neutralization, each H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from the base. So I need to figure out the stoichiometry here.

Ca(OH)2 is calcium hydroxide. Its formula tells me it has two OH- ions per formula unit. So each mole of Ca(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-. That's important because it affects the reaction's stoichiometry.

Now, the reaction between H3PO4 and Ca(OH)2. Let me write it out. H3PO4 (aq) + Ca(OH)2 (aq) → ?

H3PO4 can donate three H+ ions, but Ca(OH)2 has two OH- per formula. So to neutralize, the H+ and OH- combine to form water.

Wait, the neutralization would involve the H+ from H3PO4 reacting with OH- from Ca(OH)2. So for each molecule of H3PO4, it can contribute 3 H+ ions. But each Ca(OH)2 contributes 2 OH- ions.

So the reaction equation would be: 2 H3PO4 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → 2 Ca3(PO4)2 + 6 H2O? Wait, I'm not sure about the products. Alternatively, maybe each H3PO4 can neutralize two OH- from Ca(OH)2, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of equivalents. Because in acid-base reactions, the equivalents are based on the ions that can react. For H3PO4, since it's triprotic, each mole gives 3 equivalents of acid. Ca(OH)2 is a strong base, and each mole gives 2 equivalents of base (since each OH- is one equivalent).

So the reaction is H3PO4 + OH- → neutralization. Each H3PO4 can provide 3 H+ ions, so each mole is 3 equivalents. Each mole of Ca(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so 2 equivalents per mole.

So the equivalent concept is key here. The equivalents of acid must equal the equivalents of base for neutralization.

So the formula is: M_a * V_a = M_b * V_b, but considering equivalents.

Wait, no. Wait, in terms of equivalents, the equivalents from acid must equal the equivalents from base.

Equivalents (acid) = M_acid (in M) * Volume_acid (in L) * valency_factor_acid
Equivalents (base) = M_base (in M) * Volume_base (in L) * valency_factor_base

So valency factor for H3PO4 is 3 (since it's triprotic, can donate 3 H+ per molecule). For Ca(OH)2, each formula unit gives 2 OH-, so valency factor is 2.

So setting equivalents equal:

M_H3PO4 * V_H3PO4 * 3 = M_Ca(OH)2 * V_Ca(OH)2 * 2

Wait, but wait, in the case of neutralization, the H+ from acid reacts with OH- from base in a 1:1 ratio. So the total equivalents from acid (H+) must equal the total from base (OH-).

So yes, the equation should be:

(H3PO4 concentration) * (volume) * (3) = (Ca(OH)2 concentration) * (volume) * (2)

Because each mole of H3PO4 gives 3 H+ (equivalents) and each mole of Ca(OH)2 gives 2 OH- (equivalents). So the product of each side should be equal.

So plugging in the numbers:

H3PO4: M = 0.025 M, V = let's say V mL (which is what we're solving for)
Ca(OH)2: M = 0.030 M, V = 25 mL.

So the equation becomes:

0.025 * V * 3 = 0.030 * 25 * 2

Let me compute each side.

Left side: 0.075 V
Right side: 0.03 *25 is 0.75, times 2 is 1.5.

So 0.075 V = 1.5

Solving for V:

V = 1.5 / 0.075 → Let's compute that.

1.5 divided by 0.075.

Hmm, 0.075 times 20 is 1.5, because 0.075 * 20 = 1.5.

So V = 20 mL.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Did I mix up the acid and base? Because sometimes I get confused with which is which.

So the acid is H3PO4, which is correct. The base is Ca(OH)2, correct.

Each H3PO4 gives 3 H+ → so 3 equivalents per mole.

Each Ca(OH)2 gives 2 OH- → 2 equivalents per mole.

So the equation is correct.

So the calculation gives V = 20 mL, which is option H.

Looking back at the options: H is 20 ml.

So I think the answer is H.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the volume of 0.025 M H₃PO₄ required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.030 M Ca(OH)₂. Neutralization reactions involve the reaction of H⁺ ions from the acid with OH⁻ ions from the base in a 1:1 ratio. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Determine the equivalents of acid and base:**
   - H₃PO₄ is a triprotic acid, meaning each mole of H₃PO₄ can donate 3 H⁺ ions (3 equivalents per mole).
   - Ca(OH)₂ is a strong base, with each mole providing 2 OH⁻ ions (2 equivalents per mole).

2. **Set up the equivalence equation:**
   \[
   \text{Equivalents of acid} = \text{Equivalents of base}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{H₃PO₄}} \cdot V_{\text{H₃PO₄}} \cdot 3 = M_{\text{Ca(OH)₂}} \cdot V_{\text{Ca(OH)₂}} \cdot 2
   \]

3. **Plug in the values:**
   - \( M_{\text{H₃PO₄}} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \), \( V_{\text{H₃PO₄}} = V \, \text{mL} \)
   - \( M_{\text{Ca(OH)₂}} = 0.030 \, \text{M} \), \( V_{\text{Ca(OH)₂}} = 25 \, \text{mL} \)

   Substituting into the equation:
   \[
   0.025 \cdot V \cdot 3 = 0.030 \cdot 25 \cdot 2
   \]

4. **Simplify and solve for \( V \):**
   - Left side: \( 0.075V \)
   - Right side: \( 0.030 \cdot 25 = 0.75 \), and \( 0.75 \cdot 2 = 1.5 \)
   \[
   0.075V = 1.5
   \]
   \[
   V = \frac{1.5}{0.075} = 20 \, \text{mL}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The volume of 0.025 M H₃PO₄ required to neutralize 25 mL of 0.030 M Ca(OH)₂ is **20 mL**.
