Okay, so I have this question here about an electric iron and how many amperes it takes from a 120-volt line. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrical formulas, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says the iron is 720 watts. Watts, right, that's a unit of power. And power is related to voltage and current. Oh wait, the formula I remember is P = V * I, where P is power in watts, V is voltage in volts, and I is current in amperes. So if I rearrange that formula to solve for current, I would get I = P / V.

So in this case, P is 720 watts, and V is 120 volts. Let me plug those numbers in. I = 720 / 120. Let me do that division. 720 divided by 120. Well, 120 times 6 is 720 because 120 times 5 is 600, and 120 more is 720. So 720 divided by 120 is 6. So that would be 6 amperes.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Oh right, sometimes I confuse whether it's P=VI or something else. But no, that's correct. Power equals voltage multiplied by current. So using that, the calculation should be right.

Looking at the options, option A is 6 amp. So that's the correct answer. I think that's it. I don't see any other way to approach this. Maybe if I thought about Ohm's law, which is V=IR, but that's when you're dealing with resistance. But here, I have power and voltage, so using P=VI makes sense.

Yeah, I think I'm confident with that. So the answer should be A, 6 amp.

To determine how many amperes a 720-watt electric iron takes from a 120-volt line, we use the formula for power: 

\[
P = V \times I
\]

Rearranging to solve for current (\(I\)):

\[
I = \frac{P}{V}
\]

Substituting \(P = 720 \, \text{W}\) and \(V = 120 \, \text{V}\):

\[
I = \frac{720}{120} = 6 \, \text{A}
\]

Thus, the electric iron draws 6 amperes. The correct answer is:

A
