Okay, so I've got this problem about Brownian motion and covariance. Hmm, let's see. I remember that Brownian motion is a stochastic process with certain properties. The question says that W(t) is a standard Brownian motion, which I think means it has independent increments, starts at zero, and has variance equal to time t.

Now, the process X(t) is defined as exp{W(t)}. So X(t) is the exponential of a Brownian motion. I think such a process is called a geometric Brownian motion, right? It's often used in finance for modeling stock prices.

The problem asks for the covariance between X(s=1/2) and X(t=1), so Cov(X(1/2), X(1)). I remember that covariance measures how much two random variables change together. For that, I probably need to find E[X(1/2) X(1)] minus the product of the expectations, E[X(1/2)] E[X(1)].

Wait, but what's E[X(t)]? Since X(t) is exp(W(t)), and W(t) is a normal variable with mean 0 and variance t. I think the expectation of exp of a normal variable is exp(μ + 0.5 σ²). Oh right, because if W ~ N(μ, σ²), then E[e^W] = e^{μ + (σ²)/2}. In this case, μ is 0 and σ² is t. So E[X(t)] = e^{0 + t/2} = e^{t/2}.

So for X(1/2), the expectation is e^{(1/2)/2} = e^{1/4}, and for X(1), it's e^{1/2}.

Now, to find the covariance, I need E[X(s) X(t)] where s=1/2 and t=1. Wait, s is less than t, so maybe I can express X(t) as X(s) multiplied by something else. Let me think: Since W(t) = W(s) + [W(t) - W(s)], and the increments are independent. So W(t) = W(s) + ΔW, where ΔW is a Brownian motion increment over time (t-s). So:

X(t) = exp(W(t)) = exp(W(s) + ΔW) = exp(W(s)) * exp(ΔW) = X(s) * exp(ΔW).

So X(t) = X(s) * exp(ΔW). That might help.

So E[X(s) X(t)] = E[X(s) * X(s) exp(ΔW)] = E[X(s)^2 exp(ΔW)]. Wait, no, because X(s) and ΔW are independent? Since W(t) has independent increments, W(s) and ΔW are independent, so X(s) is exp(W(s)) which is independent of ΔW.

So E[X(s) X(t)] = E[X(s) * X(s) exp(ΔW)] = E[X(s)^2] * E[exp(ΔW)].

Wait, but X(s) is exp(W(s)), so X(s)^2 is exp(2 W(s)). The expectation of exp(2 W(s)) is e^{2*0 + (2)^2*(s)/2} ? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, W(s) is N(0, s). So 2 W(s) is N(0, 4 s). So E[exp(2 W(s))] = e^{0 + (4 s)/2} = e^{2 s}.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. The general formula is E[e^{a W}] where W is N(μ, σ²). Then E[e^{a W}] = e^{μ a + (σ² a²)/2}. In our case, W(s) is N(0, s), so E[e^{a W(s)}] = e^{0*a + (s a²)/2} = e^{(a² s)/2}.

So for a=2, E[X(s)^2] = E[e^{2 W(s)}] = e^{(2^2 * s)/2} = e^{2 s}.

Wait, s is 1/2 here, so E[X(1/2)^2] = e^{2*(1/2)} = e^{1} = e.

And E[exp(ΔW)] where ΔW is W(t) - W(s) = W(1) - W(1/2). Since the increments are independent, ΔW is N(0, t-s) which is N(0, 1 - 1/2 = 1/2). So E[exp(ΔW)] is e^{(0) + ( (1/2) * 1^2 ) / 2 } = e^{(1/2)/2} = e^{1/4}.

So putting it all together, E[X(s) X(t)] = E[X(s)^2] * E[exp(ΔW)] = e * e^{1/4} = e^{5/4}.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Because X(t) = X(s) * exp(ΔW), so X(s) X(t) = X(s)^2 exp(ΔW). Since X(s) and exp(ΔW) are independent, the expectation is E[X(s)^2] * E[exp(ΔW)].

Yes, that's correct. So E[X(s) X(t)] = e^{2s} * e^{(t-s)/2}.

Wait, because E[exp(ΔW)] where ΔW is N(0, t-s), so that's e^{(t-s)/2}.

So s is 1/2, t is 1. So 2s = 1, and (t-s) is 1/2. So E[X(s) X(t)] = e^{1} * e^{(1/2)/2} = e * e^{1/4} = e^{5/4}.

And the expectations E[X(s)] and E[X(t)] are e^{s/2} and e^{t/2}, respectively.

So E[X(s)] = e^{(1/2)/2} = e^{1/4}, E[X(t)] = e^{1/2}.

So Cov(X(s), X(t)) = E[X(s) X(t)] - E[X(s)] E[X(t)].

Plugging in the numbers: e^{5/4} - e^{1/4} * e^{1/2}.

Simplify the second term: e^{1/4} * e^{1/2} = e^{(1/4 + 1/2)} = e^{3/4}.

So Cov = e^{5/4} - e^{3/4}.

Wait, what's e^{5/4}? Let's compute it numerically.

e is approximately 2.71828.

e^{5/4} = e^(1.25) ≈ 3.4903.

e^{3/4} = e^(0.75) ≈ 2.117.

So Cov ≈ 3.4903 - 2.117 ≈ 1.3733.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.3733, which matches.

So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that \( W(t) \) is a standard Brownian motion, and \( X(t) = \exp(W(t)) \) is a geometric Brownian motion. The covariance between \( X(s) \) and \( X(t) \) for \( 0 < s < t \) is given by:

\[
\text{Cov}(X(s), X(t)) = E[X(s) X(t)] - E[X(s)] E[X(t)].
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( E[X(t)] \)
Since \( W(t) \sim N(0, t) \), the expectation of \( X(t) = \exp(W(t)) \) is:

\[
E[X(t)] = E[\exp(W(t))] = \exp\left(\frac{t}{2}\right).
\]

For \( t = 1 \), \( E[X(1)] = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \), and for \( s = 1/2 \), \( E[X(1/2)] = \exp\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \).

### Step 2: Compute \( E[X(s) X(t)] \)
Using the property of Brownian motion, \( W(t) = W(s) + \Delta W \), where \( \Delta W = W(t) - W(s) \) is independent of \( W(s) \). Thus:

\[
X(t) = \exp(W(t)) = \exp(W(s) + \Delta W) = \exp(W(s)) \cdot \exp(\Delta W) = X(s) \cdot \exp(\Delta W).
\]

Since \( X(s) \) and \( \exp(\Delta W) \) are independent, we have:

\[
E[X(s) X(t)] = E[X(s)^2] \cdot E[\exp(\Delta W)].
\]

- \( X(s)^2 = \exp(2 W(s)) \), and since \( W(s) \sim N(0, s) \), \( E[X(s)^2] = \exp(2s) \).
- \( \Delta W \sim N(0, t-s) \), so \( E[\exp(\Delta W)] = \exp\left(\frac{t-s}{2}\right) \).

Thus:

\[
E[X(s) X(t)] = \exp(2s) \cdot \exp\left(\frac{t-s}{2}\right).
\]

For \( s = 1/2 \) and \( t = 1 \):

\[
E[X(1/2) X(1)] = \exp(2 \cdot 1/2) \cdot \exp\left(\frac{1 - 1/2}{2}\right) = \exp(1) \cdot \exp\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{5}{4}\right).
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Covariance
The covariance is:

\[
\text{Cov}(X(s), X(t)) = E[X(s) X(t)] - E[X(s)] E[X(t)].
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Cov}(X(1/2), X(1)) = \exp\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) - \exp\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \cdot \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify the second term:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \cdot \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{3}{4}\right).
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Cov}(X(1/2), X(1)) = \exp\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) - \exp\left(\frac{3}{4}\right).
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
Using \( \exp(5/4) \approx 3.4903 \) and \( \exp(3/4) \approx 2.117 \):

\[
\text{Cov}(X(1/2), X(1)) \approx 3.4903 - 2.117 = 1.3733.
\]

### Final Answer
The covariance is approximately \( 1.3733 \), which corresponds to option **D**.
