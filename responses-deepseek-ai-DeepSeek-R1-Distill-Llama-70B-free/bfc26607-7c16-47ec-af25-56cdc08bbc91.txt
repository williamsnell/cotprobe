The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A bank teller was on trial for embezzlement. The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?

Options:

A: Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.
B: No, because the records are considered public documents and do not need further authentication.
C: No, because the defense did not provide any counter evidence to dispute the records.
D: Yes, because the prosecution must also prove the bank teller had access to manipulate these records.
E: Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.
F: No, because the records are self-authenticating and do not require additional proof of authenticity.
G: No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.
H: Yes, because the prosecution failed to provide a chain of custody for the records.
I: No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.
J: Yes, because the records must be certified by a public official, not just a bank employee.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about bank records being admitted in a trial. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a bank teller on trial for embezzlement. The prosecution is offering the bank's daily deposit and tally records for six months. They want to show that the deposits didn't reconcile with the funds received. But they're trying to enter these records as exhibits without getting certification or testimony from the bank's custodian of records. The defense objects, saying it's hearsay. The question is whether the court would find the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity.

Hmm, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. But there are exceptions. One of the exceptions is the business records exception under FRE 803(6). For business records to be admissible, they must be made at or near the time of the event, kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity, and it must be the regular practice to keep such records. 

But wait, there's more. The proponent (here, the prosecution) must also show that the records are trustworthy. Sometimes that requires a custodian or another qualified witness to testify about the record-keeping process, or they might use a certification under FRE 902(11) or (12) to self-authenticate the records without a witness.

In this case, the prosecution didn't get a certification or have the custodian testify. So are the records admissible? I think the business records exception requires either testimony from the custodian or a proper certification. Without that, the records might not be authenticated enough.

Looking at the options:

Option A says a qualified bank employee must authenticate them. That sounds right because without a custodian or certification, the records aren't properly authenticated.

Option E says bank records aren't included in the business records exception. No, that's wrong because bank records are a classic example of business records under the exception.

Option G says business records are allowed without further qualification. But I think they still need authentication, so G might be incorrect.

Option F says they're self-authenticating. I don't think so. Self-authenticating usually applies to things like public documents or newspapers, not business records. Business records typically need authentication through testimony or certification.

Option J mentions certification by a public official. No, a bank employee's certification should suffice because it's the bank's records. So J is probably wrong.

So the correct answer might be A. Because without the proper authentication (either through testimony or certification), the records can't be admitted under the business records exception. The court would likely require that authentication, so the evidence would be inadmissible without it.

The correct answer is A. Under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, proper authentication is required, typically through testimony from the custodian or a certification. Without this, the records are inadmissible.
