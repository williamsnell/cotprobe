Question:

A circus operates in a rural part of the county. It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the "big top" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb. If the parents assert a claim against the adjuster to recover damages for infliction of emotional distress, they will

Options:

A: not recover, because the adjuster's actions were part of his job duties.
B: recover, because the adjuster's actions constituted harassment.
C: not recover, because the parents took the advice of a neighbor and consulted an attorney.
D: not recover, because the parents did not suffer emotional distress that was severe.
E: not recover, because the parents eventually received a $250,000 settlement from the adjuster's insurance company.
F: recover, because the adjuster provided false information to the parents.
G: not recover, because the adjuster's actions did not directly cause the boy's injury.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with intentional infliction of emotional distress. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A circus has a practice of using aerial bombs for fireworks. A boy finds one, lights it, and gets injured. Then the insurance adjuster for the circus contacts the parents, trying to settle. He tells them they don't need a lawyer because the law doesn't allow recovery. But he's lying, and he knows it. He also warns them they'll get nothing unless they take the $5k offer. He harasses them for over a month. Then the parents consult a lawyer and get a $250k settlement.

The question is about whether the parents can recover damages for infliction of emotional distress against the adjuster.

So, the claim here is for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED). The elements for IIED are:

1. The defendant acted intentionally or recklessly.
2. The conduct was extreme and outrageous.
3. The actions caused emotional distress.
4. The distress was severe.

Now, looking at the adjuster's actions. He's repeatedly contacting the parents, lying about the law, telling them they can't recover, threatening them with getting nothing. This sounds pretty extreme. He's trying to intimidate and mislead them, which could be considered outrageous. 

So, the first point is whether the adjuster's conduct was extreme and outrageous. Courts have held that certain conduct, like harassment and deceit, especially in situations where the person is vulnerable (like after a child's injury), can meet this standard.

Next, did the parents suffer severe emotional distress? The question says they were "outraged" by the adjuster's actions and sought advice. While being outraged is an emotion, I'm not sure if that's enough. Severe distress usually requires more, like physical symptoms or significant emotional impact. But the question doesn't specify if the parents had, say, anxiety, depression, or other issues. It just says they were outraged and took action. So maybe the severity isn't clearly established here.

Another point is that the parents did end up consulting a lawyer and got a good settlement. Does that affect their claim? I don't think so because the IIED claim is about the emotional harm caused by the adjuster's actions, not about the outcome of the settlement.

Looking at the answer options:

A: Adjuster's actions were part of his job. Well, even if within his duties, if the conduct was extreme and outrageous, that's still a basis for IIED. So A might not be correct.

B: Recover because of harassment. Harassment can be part of extreme and outrageous conduct, so this could be a possibility.

C: They consulted an attorney. But that's a reasonable action; it doesn't negate their emotional distress.

D: Not recover because distress wasn't severe. If the facts don't show severe distress beyond being outraged, this could be the reason.

E: They got a settlement, so no recovery. I think this is about the settlement of the original claim, not the IIED. So E might not be correct.

F: Recover because of false info. Providing false information could be part of the outrageous conduct, but IIED requires more than just deceit.

G: Adjuster didn't cause the injury. That's irrelevant because IIED is about the adjuster's own actions causing distress, not the injury itself.

So, the main issue is whether the parents suffered severe emotional distress. The question says they were outraged, but that's a strong emotion, but not necessarily severe. IIED requires severe distress, which often involves more than just temporary upset. If the facts don't show severe, ongoing distress, then they wouldn't recover.

Looking back, the question states the adjuster's actions caused them to seek advice, but it doesn't specify that they experienced severe distress beyond that. So perhaps the answer is D: not recover because the distress wasn't severe.

But wait, some courts might find that being lied to repeatedly and threatened in such a manner could cause severe distress. Without more facts, it's a bit tricky. The adjuster's actions were definitely outrageous, but did they cause severe distress?

Alternatively, if the parents only felt outraged and took action, maybe that's not enough. So the answer would be D.

The question revolves around whether the parents can recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) against the adjuster. To establish IIED, the following elements must be met:

1. The defendant acted intentionally or recklessly.
2. The conduct was extreme and outrageous.
3. The actions caused emotional distress.
4. The distress was severe.

The adjuster's actions, including repeatedly lying about the law, threatening the parents with receiving nothing if they did not accept the settlement, and harassing them for over a month, appear to meet the standard of extreme and outrageous conduct. However, the critical issue is whether the parents suffered severe emotional distress. While the question states that the parents were "outraged" and sought advice, it does not provide evidence of severe emotional distress, such as physical symptoms or significant emotional impairment. Severe distress typically requires more than temporary upset or outrage.

Given the lack of specific evidence showing severe emotional distress, the parents would not recover damages for IIED. The correct answer is:

D: Not recover, because the parents did not suffer emotional distress that was severe.

Answer: D
