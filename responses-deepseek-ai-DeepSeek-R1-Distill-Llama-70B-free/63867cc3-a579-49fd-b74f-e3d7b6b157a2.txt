Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychology, specifically dealing with neurotic symptoms and their relation to anxiety relief. Hmm, I remember that neurotic symptoms are part of defense mechanisms, right? Let me think about this.

The question is: If a symptom doesn't relieve anxiety, does the neurotic discard it? The options are A through E, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

So, I'm trying to recall what I know about neurotic behavior. Neurotics use various defense mechanisms to cope with anxiety. Symptoms like obsessions, compulsions, or phobias are expressions of these mechanisms. The idea is that these symptoms help reduce anxiety in some way, even if they're maladaptive.

Wait, but what happens when the symptom doesn't work? Like, if the symptom doesn't help alleviate the anxiety, would the person just get rid of it? Or do they keep it anyway?

I think the key here is understanding that the symptom itself serves a psychological purpose. Even if it's not effective in reducing anxiety, the individual might still hold onto it because it's part of their defense structure. Maybe they can't just discard it easily because it's tied to their psychological makeup.

So, looking at the options:

Option A says the neurotic discards them. If the symptom isn't working, they get rid of it. But I'm not sure. Symptoms are often deeply ingrained, so maybe they don't just discard them.

Option B suggests they accept them but seek more solutions. That could make sense because the neurotic might keep trying different ways to cope, adding new mechanisms alongside the existing ones.

Option E says the neurotic does not discard them. That aligns with my thought that these symptoms are part of the person's defense, so they might persist even if ineffective.

Wait, but why would they keep an ineffective symptom? Because maybe they don't realize it's not working, or because changing it is difficult. Or perhaps the symptom itself is a manifestation of an underlying conflict, so just discarding it isn't possible without addressing the root cause.

I think the correct answer is E: the neurotic does not discard them. Because even if the symptom doesn't relieve anxiety, it's part of their psychological structure, and they can't just get rid of it. Instead, they might keep the symptom and perhaps develop new ones or other coping strategies.

So the answer should be E.

The question asks whether a neurotic discards a symptom if it fails to relieve anxiety. Neurotic symptoms are defense mechanisms that aim to reduce anxiety, even if they are maladaptive. If a symptom is ineffective, the individual may not discard it because it is deeply ingrained in their psychological structure. Instead, they might retain the symptom and seek additional coping strategies. 

Analyzing the options, E ("the neurotic does not discard them") is correct because symptoms persist as part of the psychological framework, even if ineffective.

Answer: E
