Okay, so I've got this Lebesgue measure question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question defines a function m(·) as the Lebesgue measure. There's a point set E, and the condition given is that for any closed set F and open set G such that F is a subset of E, which is itself a subset of G, it holds that the supremum of m(F) is less than the infimum of m(G). The question is whether E is Lebesgue measurable, and the answer should be 1 for yes or 0 for no, then return the corresponding number from the options.

Hmm, I remember that in Lebesgue measure theory, a set is measurable if it satisfies Carathéodory's condition, which involves the measure of the whole space being equal to the sum of the measures of the set and its complement, but maybe there's another approach here.

Wait, the condition given is about any closed F inside E and any open G containing E. The sup of m(F) is less than the inf of m(G). So, what does this imply?

I think that for any such F and G, m(F) < m(G). Since F is closed and G is open, and F is contained in E which is contained in G. So the measure of any closed subset of E is strictly less than the measure of any open superset of E.

Wait, but in topology, the closure of a set E is the smallest closed set containing E, and the interior is the largest open set contained in E. Oh wait, no, actually, the interior is the largest open set contained within E, but here E is contained in G, so G is an open set that contains E. So perhaps E is contained in some open set G, and F is a closed subset of E.

Wait, the condition is that for any closed F subset of E, and any open G superset of E, sup m(F) < inf m(G). So for E, the supremum of measures of closed subsets is less than the infimum of measures of open supersets.

I think that this condition is related to the concept of a set being measurable. Because for a measurable set, the outer measure (which is the infimum of measures of open sets containing it) equals the inner measure (supremum of measures of closed sets contained within it). If E is measurable, then outer measure and inner measure would be the same, so sup m(F) would equal inf m(G). But the question states that sup m(F) is strictly less than inf m(G). So that would mean that E is not measurable.

Wait wait, because if E is measurable, then m*(E) = inf{m(G) : E⊆G, G open} and m*(E) = sup{m(F) : F closed, F⊆E}.

But the condition given is that sup m(F) < inf m(G). So that would mean that m*(E) is strictly less than m*(E), which can't happen. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps that implies that E is not measurable.

Wait, because if E were measurable, then its inner measure and outer measure would be equal. But if the inner measure (sup of closed subsets) is less than the outer measure (inf of open supersets), then E is not measurable.

Wait, no, actually, let me think again. For any set E, the inner measure is defined as sup{m(F): F closed, F⊆E}, and the outer measure is inf{m(G): G open, E⊆G}.

If E is measurable, then inner measure equals outer measure. If the inner measure is strictly less than the outer measure, then E is not measurable.

So in this problem, the condition is that for any F and G as described, sup m(F) < inf m(G). So the inner measure is less than the outer measure, which implies that the set is not measurable.

Wait, but wait! The problem states that for any closed F subset of E and any open G superset of E, m(F) < m(G). So the supremum of all m(F) would be less than the infimum of all m(G). Because for every F and G, m(F) < m(G), so the sup of m(F) is less than or equal to the inf of m(G). But if the inequality is strict, then sup m(F) < inf m(G). So the inner measure is strictly less than the outer measure, hence E is not measurable.

Therefore, the answer should be 0, meaning E is not measurable.

Looking at the options, the answer that is 0 is option J.

The question involves determining whether a set \( E \) is Lebesgue measurable based on the given condition: for any closed set \( F \subset E \) and any open set \( G \supset E \), it holds that \( \sup m(F) < \inf m(G) \), where \( m(\cdot) \) denotes the Lebesgue measure.

To analyze this, recall that a set \( E \) is Lebesgue measurable if its inner measure equals its outer measure. The inner measure of \( E \) is defined as \( \sup \{ m(F) : F \text{ is closed and } F \subset E \} \), while the outer measure is \( \inf \{ m(G) : G \text{ is open and } E \subset G \} \). If these two measures are equal, \( E \) is measurable; otherwise, it is not.

The condition \( \sup m(F) < \inf m(G) \) implies that the inner measure of \( E \) is strictly less than its outer measure. This violates the equality required for measurability. Therefore, \( E \) is not Lebesgue measurable.

From the given options, the correct answer is \( 0 \), corresponding to option J.
