Okay, so I've got this question about human evolution, specifically comparing Homo erectus and Homo habilis. I'm a bit rusty on my anthropology, but I'll try to think this through.

The question is asking what's a key difference between the two. The options are A to J. I remember that both species are part of the Homo genus, which is closer to modern humans than, say, Australopithecus. 

Let me start by recalling what I know about each. Homo habilis is often considered the first species to use tools, hence the name 'habilis' which means 'handy' or 'skillful'. They were bipedal, I think, and had a brain size a bit larger than Australopithecus, maybe around 600-700 cubic centimeters. Their fossils are mostly found in Africa, right?

Homo erectus comes after Homo habilis. I remember that erectus had a more human-like body, with longer legs and a taller stature. They were fully bipedal and could walk long distances. Their brain size was larger than habilis, something like 900-1100 cc, which is closer to modern humans. Also, I think erectus was the first to migrate out of Africa, spreading into Eurasia. They used more advanced tools, maybe like Acheulean tools, which are more sophisticated than the Oldowan tools used by habilis.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Erectus was not bipedal. Wait, I thought erectus was fully bipedal. So this is incorrect.

Option B: Erectus was not capable of using tools. No, that's wrong because erectus used more complex tools than habilis.

Option C: Erectus was primarily herbivorous. I'm not sure about their diet, but I think they were omnivores, eating both plants and meat. But I'm not certain if this is a key difference from habilis, who might have eaten more plants. Not sure, but maybe not the main point.

Option D: Erectus fossils found only in Africa. No, erectus spread to other parts of the world, like Asia and Europe. So D is wrong.

Option E: Erectus had a larger brain. Yes, I think this is correct. Erectus had a bigger brain than habilis.

Option F: Erectus was a short-lived species. I don't think so. They existed for a long time, maybe from 1.8 million to 70,000 years ago or so. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Erectus had smaller body size. No, erectus was taller and more robust, I believe.

Option H: Fossils only in Europe. No, as I said earlier, they were found in Africa, Asia, and Europe.

Option I: Smaller brain. No, opposite of E, so incorrect.

Option J: Shorter lifespan. I don't recall lifespan being a key difference, but erectus probably had longer lifespans than habilis, given their more advanced traits.

So the main differences I remember are brain size and perhaps body structure. The question is about which option is correct. The answer should be E: Erectus had a larger brain.

Homo erectus and Homo habilis are both part of the Homo genus, but they exhibit distinct differences. Homo habilis is known for being the first species to use tools and had a brain size of approximately 600-700 cubic centimeters. Their fossils are primarily found in Africa. Homo erectus, which succeeded Homo habilis, had a more human-like body, was fully bipedal, and had a larger brain size, ranging from 900-1100 cubic centimeters. Erectus also migrated out of Africa, spreading into Eurasia, and used more advanced tools.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Erectus was fully bipedal.
- **B**: Incorrect. Erectus used more complex tools than habilis.
- **C**: Not a key difference; both were likely omnivores.
- **D**: Incorrect. Erectus fossils are found in Africa, Asia, and Europe.
- **E**: Correct. Erectus had a larger brain than habilis.
- **F**: Incorrect. Erectus existed for a long period.
- **G**: Incorrect. Erectus was taller and more robust.
- **H**: Incorrect. Fossils are not limited to Europe.
- **I**: Incorrect. Erectus had a larger, not smaller, brain.
- **J**: Incorrect. Lifespan differences are not a key distinction.

The correct answer is **E: Erectus possessed a larger brain.**
