Okay, so I have this problem about utility and insurance. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

So the question says: there's a 50-50 chance that someone with $20,000 wealth will lose $10,000 in a car accident. Insurance is available at actuarially fair rates. We need to compute the utility if the individual buys full insurance. The utility function is logarithmic, which I remember is u(w) = ln(w). 

Wait, logarithmic utility means the utility is the natural log of wealth. So the individual's utility depends on their wealth after the accident, considering whether they have insurance or not.

First, let me think about the scenarios without insurance and with insurance. Without insurance, there's a 50% chance they end up with $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000. And 50% chance they keep the full $20,000. But with full insurance, they would be fully covered, so their wealth remains the same in both cases, right?

Wait no, wait. The question says they buy full insurance. So if they have full insurance, the loss is covered. That means regardless of the accident, their wealth would stay at $20,000. Because the insurance company would pay the $10,000 loss, leaving their wealth unchanged.

Wait, but does buying full insurance mean they pay a premium, which would reduce their current wealth? Oh right, because insurance isn't free. So the premium would be the expected loss. Let me calculate the expected loss.

The expected loss is 0.5 * $10,000 = $5,000. So the premium would be $5,000 because it's actuarially fair. So if they buy the insurance, their wealth becomes $20,000 - $5,000 (premium) = $15,000. But wait, no. Wait, when you buy insurance, you pay the premium upfront, regardless of whether the accident happens. So their initial wealth after paying the premium is $15,000. But then, if the accident happens, the insurance pays $10,000, so their wealth becomes $15,000 + $10,000 = $25,000? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think: Suppose without insurance, the possible outcomes are $10,000 (if accident) and $20,000 (no accident). With full insurance, the individual pays a premium P, which is the expected loss, so P = 0.5 * 10,000 = 5,000. So their initial wealth after paying premium is 20,000 - 5,000 = 15,000.

Now, if the accident occurs, the insurance pays the $10,000 loss. Wait, but does that mean their wealth after the accident is 15,000 - 10,000 loss + 10,000 insurance payout = 15,000? Or does the insurance cover the loss, so their wealth doesn't drop?

Wait, if they have full insurance, the loss is fully covered. So if the accident happens, their wealth doesn't go down. So their wealth would be 15,000 (after paying the premium) and that's it, because the insurance covers the $10,000 loss. So in the accident scenario, their wealth remains 15,000. Alternatively, think that after paying the premium, they have 15,000. Then, if the accident happens, the insurance pays 10,000, so their total is 15,000 + 10,000 = 25,000. But that doesn't make sense because that would mean their wealth increases, which isn't how insurance works. Wait, no, wait: No, the insurance would reimburse the loss. So if you have 15,000 after paying the premium, and then you lose 10,000, the insurance gives you 10,000, so you end up with 15,000 again. So in either case, with full insurance, your wealth is 15,000. Because if no accident, you just have 15,000, and if accident, you lose 10k but get 10k back, so still 15k.

Wait, but that can't be right because 15k is less than the original 20k. So by buying the insurance, you're certain to have 15k, which is less than 20k, but avoids the risk of going down to 10k.

Wait, but the utility of 15k would be ln(15,000). Let me compute that.

But wait, let me think again. Am I calculating the expected utility correctly?

Without insurance, the expected utility is 0.5 * ln(10,000) + 0.5 * ln(20,000).

With full insurance, the utility is ln(15,000), because it's certain. So the question asks for the utility when buying full insurance, so it's ln(15,000).

Wait, but wait, is the correct premium the expected loss, which is 5,000, making their wealth after premium 15k. Yes.

So the utility is ln(15,000). Let's compute that.

I know that ln(10,000) is ln(1e4) = 9.2103. Because e^9 is about 8103, and e^9.2103 is 10,000.

Wait, e^9 is approximately 8,103. Multiply by e^0.2103: e^0.2103 is about 1.233, so 8,103 * 1.233 ≈ 10,000. So yes, ln(10,000) is around 9.2103.

Similarly, ln(15,000) is ... Well, 15,000 is 1.5 * 10,000. So ln(15,000) = ln(10,000) + ln(1.5). We know ln(10,000) is about 9.2103. Ln(1.5) is approximately 0.4055. So 9.2103 + 0.4055 = 9.6158.

Wait, so that's approximately 9.6158, which would be option B: 9.616.

But wait, wait! Let me double-check. Let me calculate ln(15,000) accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute it as ln(15000) = ln(15) + ln(1000).

Wait, ln(1000)=6.9078, because e^6.9078≈1000.

And ln(15) is approximately 2.7080. So ln(15,000)=2.7080 +6.9078=9.6158. So yes, that's correct.

So the utility is about 9.616, which is option B.

So the correct answer is B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the utility of an individual with logarithmic utility function \( u(w) = \ln(w) \), who faces a 50-50 chance of losing $10,000 from a current wealth of $20,000. Insurance is available at actuarially fair rates, and we compute the utility if the individual buys full insurance.

### Step 1: Determine the premium for full insurance
The expected loss is calculated as:
\[
\text{Expected loss} = 0.5 \times 10,000 = 5,000.
\]
At actuarially fair rates, the premium equals the expected loss, so the premium is $5,000.

### Step 2: Compute wealth after buying full insurance
If the individual buys full insurance, they pay the premium of $5,000 upfront, reducing their initial wealth to:
\[
\text{Wealth after premium} = 20,000 - 5,000 = 15,000.
\]
With full insurance, the individual is fully protected against the $10,000 loss. Regardless of whether the accident occurs, their wealth remains constant at $15,000.

### Step 3: Calculate the utility with full insurance
The utility function is \( u(w) = \ln(w) \). Substituting \( w = 15,000 \):
\[
u(15,000) = \ln(15,000).
\]
To compute \( \ln(15,000) \), we break it down:
\[
\ln(15,000) = \ln(15) + \ln(1,000).
\]
We know:
\[
\ln(1,000) \approx 6.9078, \quad \ln(15) \approx 2.7080.
\]
Adding these values:
\[
\ln(15,000) \approx 6.9078 + 2.7080 = 9.6158.
\]

### Final Answer
The utility of buying full insurance is approximately \( 9.616 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
