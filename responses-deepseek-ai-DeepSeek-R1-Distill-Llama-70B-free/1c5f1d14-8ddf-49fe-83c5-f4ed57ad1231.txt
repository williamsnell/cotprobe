Okay, so I have this question about the monetary multiplier, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options provided. Let's try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the monetary multiplier, sometimes called the demand deposit multiplier, relates to how money supply changes when there's a change in the monetary base. The monetary base is the total amount of currency in circulation and the reserves that banks hold. But wait, the multiplier is about how much the money supply increases when new money is added to the system. 

I think the multiplier works because when a bank receives new deposits, it doesn't just sit on all of that money. Instead, it lends out a portion of it, and that lending creates more deposits elsewhere. So each dollar can lead to more than a dollar in the money supply, depending on the reserve requirements.

Wait, how is the multiplier calculated? I recall a formula. I think it's M = (1 + c)/c, where c is the reserve requirement ratio. Or was it 1 divided by the reserve ratio? Maybe it's M = 1/r, where r is the required reserve ratio. For example, if the reserve ratio is 0.2 (meaning banks keep 20% in reserves), then the multiplier would be 1/0.2 = 5. So each dollar in the base leads to $5 in the money supply.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused between the money multiplier and the deposit multiplier. I think the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but I should double-check. Oh right, the money multiplier includes both currency and deposits, while the deposit multiplier is just about deposits.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one:

Option A: "The monetary multiplier is the ratio of the total amount of a country's money supply to its central bank's monetary base." That sounds right because the money supply M is divided by the monetary base B, so M/B. So that's the multiplier. 

Option B: It talks about the increase in currency from a single deposit. That doesn't seem right because the multiplier isn't just about currency but the overall money supply, including deposits.

Option C: Ratio of demand deposits to total reserves. Hmm, that's more like the deposit multiplier, which is demand deposits divided by required reserves. But the monetary multiplier would include more factors, like cash holdings by the public. So this might not be the monetary multiplier but the deposit multiplier.

Option D: Reserves to loans. Not familiar with that as a standard ratio. That doesn't sound like the multiplier.

Option E: Demand deposits to total loans. Not sure, but I don't think that's the multiplier.

Option F: Total loans to reserves. Again, not matching what I recall.

Option G: Reserves to demand deposits. That's the reciprocal of option C. Wait, the reserve ratio is usually reserves over deposits. So if the reserve ratio is r = Reserves/Deposits, then the multiplier would be 1/r, which would be Deposits/Reserves. So option C is that. But the monetary multiplier is money supply over base, which is a different measure.

Option H: Rate at which new money is created for each dollar of reserves. That sounds correct as a description because the multiplier tells you how much new money each dollar of base creates. So H says it's the rate, which is the same as the ratio.

Option I: Government bonds held by public to reserves. Not related to the multiplier.

Option J: Percentage of deposits kept as reserves. That's the reserve requirement ratio, not the multiplier itself.

So now I'm a bit torn between options A and H. Let me think again. The monetary multiplier is a ratio of the money supply to the monetary base. So option A says that. Option H describes it as a rate of new money creation per dollar of reserves, which is effectively the same because the multiplier is M = mB, where m is the multiplier. So for each dollar of B, you get m dollars of M. So H is also a correct description.

Wait, but the question is asking what the term means and how it's calculated. So option A gives the ratio definition, which is M = (money supply)/(monetary base). Option H describes it in terms of the rate of creation, which is the same as the multiplier. So which option is correct?

I think the monetary multiplier is specifically defined as the ratio of money supply to the monetary base, so option A. Option H is more of a description of what it does, but not the actual calculation. Let me look up the formula again in my notes. Oh right, the formula is M = mB, so m = M/B. So yes, that's the ratio. So option A is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the monetary multiplier can be calculated as (1 + c)/c, which might not directly match any option. But that's the deposit multiplier. The money multiplier is M = mB, which is the same as m = M/B, so option A is correct.

So the correct answer should be A.

The monetary multiplier, also known as the demand deposit multiplier, refers to the ratio of the total money supply in an economy to the central bank's monetary base. It quantifies how much the money supply increases for every unit change in the monetary base. The formula for the monetary multiplier is:

\[
m = \frac{M}{B}
\]

where \( M \) is the total money supply and \( B \) is the monetary base (which includes currency in circulation and bank reserves).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly defines the monetary multiplier as the ratio of the total money supply to the central bank's monetary base. This aligns with the formula \( m = \frac{M}{B} \).
- **Option B** focuses on the increase in currency in circulation, which is too narrow and does not account for the broader money supply.
- **Option C** describes the ratio of demand deposits to total reserves, which is related to the deposit multiplier, not the monetary multiplier.
- **Option D** refers to the ratio of total reserves to total loans, which is unrelated to the monetary multiplier.
- **Option E** discusses demand deposits relative to total loans, which is also unrelated.
- **Option F** mentions loans relative to reserves, which does not pertain to the monetary multiplier.
- **Option G** refers to reserves relative to demand deposits, which is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio but not the monetary multiplier.
- **Option H** describes the rate of new money creation per dollar of reserves, which is a conceptual description of the multiplier but does not provide the formal definition or calculation.
- **Option I** involves government bonds held by the public relative to reserves, which is unrelated.
- **Option J** refers to the reserve requirement ratio, which is a component of the multiplier but not the multiplier itself.

The most accurate and precise definition is provided by **Option A**, as it directly describes the monetary multiplier as the ratio of the total money supply to the monetary base.
