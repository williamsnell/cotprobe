Okay, so I've got this problem about a gravity-fed lock in a shipping canal and a scale model. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned about hydraulic models and scaling laws. So the question has two parts, a and b. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): If the model lock fills in 0.8 minutes, estimate the prototype time. I think this has to do with the scaling of time in models. Since the model is a scaled-down version, the time scales somehow based on the square root of the scale factor or something like that. Wait, I remember Froude scaling, right? Froude number deals with gravity-driven flows, so that's probably what's used here.

The scale factor, lambda (λ), is 1/100. So the model is 1/100th the size of the prototype. For Froude scaling, the time scale is the square root of the length scale. Because the Froude number equates the ratio of inertial forces to gravitational forces, and for similarity, the model and prototype Froude numbers must be equal.

So the time scaling factor is sqrt(λ). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the model is smaller, so time in the model would be shorter than the prototype. So if the model time is t_m, the prototype time t_p would be t_m divided by sqrt(λ), because λ is the ratio of model to prototype. Because lambda is length_model / length_prototype = 1/100.

Wait, actually, the Froude scaling law says that the time ratio t_p / t_m = 1 / sqrt(λ). Because for gravity-driven flows, the time scale is proportional to sqrt(L), where L is the characteristic length.

So λ is the scale factor for lengths: L_model = λ * L_prototype. So λ here is 1/100.

So t_p = t_model * sqrt(1/λ) ?

Wait, let me make sure. Let's think in terms of the Froude number equation.

Froude number Fr = V / sqrt(g L).

For the model and prototype to be similar, their Froude numbers should be equal. So Fr_model = Fr_prototype.

V_model / sqrt(g_model * L_model) ) = V_prototype / sqrt(g_prototype * L_prototype) )

Assuming the model and prototype have the same gravity (which is usually the case unless it's a different planet), g_model = g_prototype = g. So that cancels out.

So V_model / sqrt(L_model) = V_prototype / sqrt(L_prototype).

Which can be rearranged as V_model / V_prototype = sqrt( L_model / L_prototype ) = sqrt(λ).

So the velocity in the model is sqrt(λ) times that of the prototype.

But how does this relate to time? Hmm. Because time is inversely related to velocity for a given length. So the time it takes for a process (like filling the lock) would depend on how long it takes for the water to flow through the system.

Wait, the time to fill the lock would depend on the volume flow rate. Volume flow rate Q is area times velocity. So Q_model / Q_prototype = (A_model / A_prototype) * (V_model / V_prototype).

The area scales with λ squared, since area is two-dimensional. So A_model = λ² A_prototype.

So Q_model/Q_prototype = λ² * sqrt(λ) ) = λ^(5/2).

Wait, but wait, the volume flow rate is also related to how much volume is being moved. The locks are similar, so their volume scales with λ cubed. So the time to fill would be Volume / Q. So time_model = Volume_model / Q_model. Similarly for the prototype.

Volume_model = λ³ Volume_prototype.

So time_model = (λ³ Vol_p) / Q_model.

Time_prototype = Vol_p / Q_p.

So the ratio time_p / time_m would be (Vol_p / Q_p) / (λ³ Vol_p / Q_model ) )

Which simplifies to (Q_model / Q_p ) * 1/(λ³).

From earlier, Q_model/Q_p = λ^(5/2).

So ( λ^(5/2) ) / λ^3 ) = λ^(5/2 - 3) ) = λ^(-1/2) = 1 / sqrt(λ).

Wait, so time_p / time_m = 1 / sqrt(λ). So time_p = time_m * (1 / sqrt(λ) )

Since lambda is 1/100, sqrt(1/100) is 1/10. So 1/sqrt(λ) is 10.

So time_p = 0.8 min * 10 = 8 minutes.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the scaling. Because sometimes when I'm scaling time, if the process is slower, the prototype takes longer. So if the model takes 0.8 minutes, the prototype takes longer. So 0.8 * 10 is 8 minutes. So the answer for part (a) should be 8 minutes.

Looking at the options, option G says 8 min, λ^5/2. Hmm, but wait, part (a) is just the time, and part (b) is the mass flow ratio.

Wait, let me make sure about the time scaling. Alternative approach: The time scale is proportional to sqrt( L ), so since the prototype is larger by 100 times in length, the time should scale by sqrt(100) = 10. So if model takes 0.8 min, prototype takes 0.8 *10=8 min. So yes, 8 minutes for part (a).

Now part (b): the ratio of mass flow rates in model and prototype. Mass flow rate is density times volume flow rate. Assuming the density is the same (water), so the mass flow ratio is same as the volume flow rate ratio.

Earlier, I got Q_model/Q_prototype = λ^(5/2). Because Q scales as L² V, and V scales as sqrt(L), so L² * sqrt(L) = L^(5/2). So lambda^(5/2).

Wait, let me double-check. Volume flow rate Q = A * V. A scales as lambda squared, V scales as sqrt(lambda) (since V_model = V_prototype * sqrt(lambda) ). So Q_model = A_model * V_model = (lambda^2 A_p) * (sqrt(lambda) V_p) ) = lambda^(2 + 0.5) A_p V_p = lambda^(5/2) Q_p.

So Q_model/Q_p = lambda^(5/2). So the ratio of model to prototype flow rates is lambda^(5/2). But the question is the ratio of model to prototype, which is lambda^(5/2).

Wait, but the options have various exponents. Let's compute lambda: lambda is 1/100. So lambda^5/2 is (1/100)^(5/2) = (1/(10^2))^(5/2) )= 10^(-5) )= 1e-5.

Wait, but the question is the ratio of corresponding mass flow rates in model and prototype. So mass flow rate model / prototype = (rho * Q_model ) / (rho * Q_proto ) ) = Q_model/Q_proto = lambda^(5/2) = (1/100)^(5/2) )= (1/10^2)^(2.5) )= 1/(10^5) )= 1e-5.

But the options have terms like λ^3, λ^4, etc. So looking for an option where part (a) is 8 min and part (b) is λ^(5/2).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option G: 8 min, λ^5/2.

Yes, that's what I have. So part (a) is 8 min, and part (b) is lambda^(5/2), which is (1/100)^(5/2)= 1e-5.

So the correct option is G.

Wait, but wait, are there other options that have 8 min and lambda^5/2? Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:5, λ^7/2

B:9, λ^3/2

C:11, λ^4

D:12, λ^5/3

E:7, λ^4/2

F:6, λ^6/2

G:8, λ^5/2

H:4, λ^2

I:10, λ^3

J:15, λ^7/3

So yes, G is the one with 8 min and λ^(5/2), so option G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the scaling laws for a gravity-fed lock model and prototype. The scale factor is given as \( \lambda = \frac{1}{100} \), meaning the model is \( \frac{1}{100} \) the size of the prototype.

### Part (a): Time to Fill the Prototype
For gravity-driven flows, the Froude scaling law applies. The time scaling factor is proportional to \( \sqrt{\lambda} \), where \( \lambda \) is the ratio of model to prototype lengths. Since \( \lambda = \frac{1}{100} \), we have:

\[
t_{\text{prototype}} = t_{\text{model}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}}
\]

Substituting \( t_{\text{model}} = 0.8 \, \text{min} \) and \( \sqrt{\lambda} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{100}} = \frac{1}{10} \):

\[
t_{\text{prototype}} = 0.8 \cdot 10 = 8 \, \text{min}
\]

Thus, the prototype takes **8 minutes** to fill.

### Part (b): Ratio of Mass Flow Rates
Mass flow rate is proportional to volume flow rate, and volume flow rate \( Q \) scales as:

\[
Q \propto A \cdot V
\]

The area \( A \) scales as \( \lambda^2 \), and the velocity \( V \) scales as \( \sqrt{\lambda} \) under Froude scaling. Therefore, the volume flow rate scales as:

\[
Q_{\text{model}} / Q_{\text{prototype}} = \lambda^2 \cdot \sqrt{\lambda} = \lambda^{5/2}
\]

Since mass flow rate is proportional to volume flow rate (assuming the same density), the ratio of mass flow rates is:

\[
\frac{\dot{m}_{\text{model}}}{\dot{m}_{\text{prototype}}} = \lambda^{5/2}
\]

### Final Answer
From the given options, the correct choice is:

- **8 minutes** for the prototype to fill (part (a)).
- **\( \lambda^{5/2} \)** for the ratio of mass flow rates (part (b)).

This corresponds to **Option G**.
