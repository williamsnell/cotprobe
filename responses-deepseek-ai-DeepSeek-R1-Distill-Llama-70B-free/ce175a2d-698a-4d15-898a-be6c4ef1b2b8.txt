Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about which statement isn't true. The options are A through D, each making a claim about different foods and their protein content. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read each option carefully.

Option A says, "Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein." Hmm, I remember that vegans don't eat animal products, so they rely on plant-based sources for protein. Plants can provide all the essential amino acids, but sometimes people think they don't get enough. But wait, I think that as long as the vegan diet is well-planned and includes a variety of protein sources like legumes, beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, they can get enough protein. So maybe this statement isn't true? Or is it?

Option B: "Cereals are deficient in lysine." I recall that lysine is an essential amino acid. Cereals, which are grains, often are lower in lysine. I think that's why it's recommended to pair them with legumes, which are higher in lysine. So this statement seems correct.

Option C: "Legumes are deficient in methionine." Methionine is another essential amino acid. I remember that legumes (like beans and lentils) are low in methionine, which is why it's often suggested to combine them with grains or other foods that provide methionine. So this statement is true.

Option D: "Dairy products are a rich source of tryptophan." Tryptophan is an essential amino acid found in many protein-rich foods. Dairy products like milk and cheese are good sources of tryptophan. So this statement is correct.

Now, going back to Option A. The statement says vegan diets are "likely" to be deficient. But I think that's not necessarily true. While it's possible if the diet isn't varied, a well-planned vegan diet can meet protein needs. So the statement in A might be the false one because it's making a generalization that isn't accurate.

So, the question is asking which statement is NOT true. Since A claims something that's not necessarily true, that's the incorrect statement. So the answer should be A.

The statement that is not true is:

**A: Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein**

Vegan diets can provide adequate protein if they are well-planned and include a variety of protein sources such as legumes, beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. While it is possible for a poorly planned vegan diet to lack sufficient protein, the statement generalizes this as likely, which is not accurate. The other options (B, C, D) are correct based on the nutritional profiles of cereals, legumes, and dairy products.

Answer: A
