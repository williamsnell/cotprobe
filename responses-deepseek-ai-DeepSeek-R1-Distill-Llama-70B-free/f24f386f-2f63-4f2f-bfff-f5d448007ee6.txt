Okay, so I've got this logic problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these truth tables and logical equivalences. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is asking me to construct a complete truth table for two propositions and then determine their relationship. The propositions are:

1. (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N)
2. (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]

And then I have to choose the correct option from A to J based on whether they're logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, etc.

First, I think I should probably simplify each proposition as much as possible before building the truth tables. Maybe that will make things clearer.

Let's start with the first proposition: (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N). I remember that implication can be rewritten using disjunction and negation. So, ~M ⊃ ~N is equivalent to M ∨ ~N. The second part, O ≡ N, is the biconditional, which is (O → N) ∧ (N → O), but that can also be written as (O ∧ N) ∨ (~O ∧ ~N). So putting that together, the first proposition becomes (M ∨ ~N) ∨ [(O ∧ N) ∨ (~O ∧ ~N)].

Wait, maybe I can simplify that. Let's see: (M ∨ ~N) ∨ (O ∧ N) ∨ (~O ∧ ~N). Hmm. Let me see if I can factor anything out. Oh, wait, the last two terms are (O ∧ N) and (~O ∧ ~N), which together make N ∧ (O ∨ ~O), but O∨~O is a tautology, so that simplifies to N. So the first proposition simplifies to (M ∨ ~N) ∨ N. Because N is being ORed with ~N, that becomes M ∨ (N ∨ ~N), which is M ∨ T, which is always true. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check again. So the first part is (M ∨ ~N) and then OR with (O ≡ N). O ≡ N is equivalent to (O → N) ∧ (N → O). But maybe it's easier to think in terms of the truth table later. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach it differently.

Alternatively, maybe I should construct the truth tables directly without simplifying. Because maybe I'm getting confused with the algebra here.

So, let's list all possible truth values for M, N, O. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

So the variables are M, N, O. Let me list all 8 possibilities.

But before I do that, maybe I should handle each proposition separately.

Starting with the first proposition: (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N). Let's compute its truth value for each combination.

Wait, but maybe I should think of each part step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps the second proposition can be simplified first. The second proposition is (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)].

Let me look at the inner part: (~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N). Let's simplify that.

(~O ∨ ~N) is the same as ~(O ∧ N). And (O ∨ N) is just O∨N. So the inner part becomes ~(O ∧ N) ∧ (O ∨ N). Hmm, maybe I can apply some laws here.

Wait, let's compute the inner part: [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]. Let me make a truth table for this part first.

Wait, but maybe I can use logical equivalences. Let me see:

[(~O ∨ ~N)] is equivalent to ~(O ∧ N). So the inner part is ~(O ∧ N) ∧ (O ∨ N).

Now, using distributive laws, this would be [~O ∧ (O ∨ N)] ∨ [~N ∧ (O ∨ N)].

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute it directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that (A ∨ B) ∧ (C ∨ D) can sometimes be tricky, but in this case, maybe it's better to compute each possibility.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to compute the second proposition step by step.

The second proposition is: (~M ∧ N) ∧ [(~O ∨ ~N) ∧ (O ∨ N)].

Wait, no, the original is: (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]. So it's a conjunction of three parts? Wait, no, it's a conjunction of two parts: (~M · N) and [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)].

Wait, but in the second part, [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] is a conjunction of two terms: (~O ∨ ~N) and (O ∨ N).

Wait, perhaps I can compute this for each possible value of O and N.

Alternatively, maybe I can note that [(~O ∨ ~N) ∧ (O ∨ N)] is equivalent to (O ∨ N) ∧ ~(O ∧ N).

Hmm, perhaps that's not immediately helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of possible truth values.

Let me consider O and N as variables, ignoring M for a moment.

So, for each combination of O and N, compute [(~O ∨ ~N) ∧ (O ∨ N)].

Let's make a small truth table for O, N:

O | N | ~O | ~N | ~O∨~N | O∨N | (~O∨~N) ∧ (O∨N)
---|---|----|----|--------|-------|---------------------
T | T | F  | F  |   T    |   T   |        T ∧ T = T
T | F | F  | T  |   T    |   T   |        T ∧ T = T
F | T | T  | F  |   T    |   T   |        T ∧ T = T
F | F | T  | T  |   T    |   F   |        T ∧ F = F

Wait, that's interesting. So for O and N both true, the inner part is true. For O true and N false, it's also true. For O false and N true, it's true. Only when both are false is it false.

Wait, but looking at the table, when O is F and N is F: (~O is T, ~N is T), so ~O∨~N is T. O∨N is F (since both are F). So the conjunction is T ∧ F = F.

In all other cases, it's T.

So the inner part [(~O ∨ ~N) ∧ (O ∨ N)] is equivalent to (O∨N) ∧ ~(O∧N), which is the same as excluding the case where both O and N are true. Wait no, because when O and N are both true, the inner part is T, as per the table above.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me recheck the small table.

Wait, when O is T and N is T:

~O is F, ~N is F, so ~O∨~N is F. O∨N is T. So (~O∨~N) ∧ (O∨N) is F ∧ T = F.

Wait, no, that contradicts what I had earlier. Wait, I think I made a mistake in my initial table.

Wait, let me correct that. Let me compute for each possible O and N:

1. O=T, N=T:
   ~O=F, ~N=F
   ~O∨~N=F
   O∨N=T
   So the conjunction F ∧ T = F.

2. O=T, N=F:
   ~O=F, ~N=T
   ~O∨~N=T
   O∨N=T
   T ∧ T = T.

3. O=F, N=T:
   ~O=T, ~N=F
   ~O∨~N=T
   O∨N=T
   T ∧ T = T.

4. O=F, N=F:
   ~O=T, ~N=T
   ~O∨~N=T
   O∨N=F
   T ∧ F = F.

Ah, okay, I see I had the first row wrong before. So the inner part is true only when exactly one of O or N is true, but not both. So it's equivalent to O⊕N, the exclusive OR. Because when O and N are the same (both T or both F), it's false, and when they differ, it's true.

So [(~O∨~N) ∧ (O∨N)] is equivalent to O⊕N.

So the second proposition becomes: (~M ∧ N) ∧ (O⊕N).

Wait, but let me make sure. So the inner part is true when O and N are different. So the entire second proposition is true only when (~M ∧ N) is true and (O⊕N) is true.

So let me think: (~M ∧ N) is true when M is false and N is true. Then, for that to be the case, O must be different from N. Since N is true, O must be false. So the second proposition is true only when M is false, N is true, and O is false.

Wait, because O⊕N is true when O and N are different. So if N is true, O must be false for O⊕N to be true.

So the second proposition is true only in the case where M=F, N=T, O=F.

Now let's look at the first proposition again: (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N).

Let me compute this for all possible M, N, O.

But maybe it's easier to compute the truth values for each of the 8 possible combinations and compare the two propositions.

So, let's create a truth table with M, N, O as variables, and compute the value of each proposition for each combination.

Let me list all 8 combinations:

1. M=T, N=T, O=T
2. M=T, N=T, O=F
3. M=T, N=F, O=T
4. M=T, N=F, O=F
5. M=F, N=T, O=T
6. M=F, N=T, O=F
7. M=F, N=F, O=T
8. M=F, N=F, O=F

Now compute first proposition (P1): (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N)

Compute each part:

~M ⊃ ~N is equivalent to M ∨ ~N.

O ≡ N is equivalent to (O → N) ∧ (N → O), which is (O∨N) ∧ (~O∨~N).

But perhaps it's easier to compute O≡N directly: it's true when O and N have the same truth value.

So for each row, compute:

P1: (M ∨ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N)

Let's go row by row.

Row 1: M=T, N=T, O=T
~M=F, ~N=F
~M⊃~N: T∨F → T
O≡N: T≡T → T
So P1: T∨T = T

Row 2: M=T, N=T, O=F
~M=F, ~N=F
~M⊃~N: T
O≡N: F≡T → F
P1: T∨F = T

Row3: M=T, N=F, O=T
~M=F, ~N=T
~M⊃~N: F∨T → T
O≡N: T≡F → F
P1: T∨F = T

Row4: M=T, N=F, O=F
~M=F, ~N=T
~M⊃~N: F∨T → T
O≡N: F≡F → T
P1: T∨T = T

Row5: M=F, N=T, O=T
~M=T, ~N=F
~M⊃~N: F∨F → F (Wait, no: ~M⊃~N is M∨~N. So M=F, ~N=F, so M∨~N = F∨F=F)
O≡N: T≡T → T
So P1: F∨T = T

Row6: M=F, N=T, O=F
~M=T, ~N=F
~M⊃~N: M∨~N = F∨F=F
O≡N: F≡T → F
So P1: F∨F = F

Row7: M=F, N=F, O=T
~M=T, ~N=T
~M⊃~N: T∨T → T
O≡N: T≡F → F
P1: T∨F = T

Row8: M=F, N=F, O=F
~M=T, ~N=T
~M⊃~N: T∨T → T
O≡N: F≡F → T
P1: T∨T = T

So compiling P1's truth values:
Row1: T
Row2: T
Row3: T
Row4: T
Row5: T
Row6: F
Row7: T
Row8: T

Now the second proposition (P2): (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]

We already determined that [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)] is O⊕N, which is true when O and N are different.

So P2 is (~M ∧ N) ∧ (O⊕N). Let's compute this for each row.

Row1: M=T, N=T, O=T
~M=F, N=T → ~M∧N=F
O⊕N: T⊕T=F
So P2: F ∧ F = F

Row2: M=T, N=T, O=F
~M=F, N=T → F
O⊕N: F⊕T=T
P2: F ∧ T = F

Row3: M=T, N=F, O=T
~M=F, N=F → F
O⊕N: T⊕F=T
P2: F ∧ T = F

Row4: M=T, N=F, O=F
~M=F, N=F → F
O⊕N: F⊕F=F
P2: F ∧ F = F

Row5: M=F, N=T, O=T
~M=T, N=T → T
O⊕N: T⊕T=F
P2: T ∧ F = F

Row6: M=F, N=T, O=F
~M=T, N=T → T
O⊕N: F⊕T=T
P2: T ∧ T = T

Row7: M=F, N=F, O=T
~M=T, N=F → F
O⊕N: T⊕F=T
P2: F ∧ T = F

Row8: M=F, N=F, O=F
~M=T, N=F → F
O⊕N: F⊕F=F
P2: F ∧ F = F

So compiling P2's truth values:
Row1: F
Row2: F
Row3: F
Row4: F
Row5: F
Row6: T
Row7: F
Row8: F

Wait, so P2 is only true in row6: M=F, N=T, O=F.

Now, comparing P1 and P2:

Looking at their truth values across all rows:

P1: T, T, T, T, T, F, T, T

P2: F, F, F, F, F, T, F, F

So they are both true only in row6, but P1 is true in all rows except row6, while P2 is true only in row6.

Wait, no. Let me check each row:

Row1: P1=T, P2=F → different
Row2: P1=T, P2=F → different
Row3: P1=T, P2=F → different
Row4: P1=T, P2=F → different
Row5: P1=T, P2=F → different
Row6: P1=F, P2=T → different
Row7: P1=T, P2=F → different
Row8: P1=T, P2=F → different

So in every row, P1 and P2 have opposite truth values. That means they are contradictory, because whenever one is true, the other is false, and vice versa.

Wait, but I thought contradictory meant that one is the negation of the other. So P2 is equivalent to ~P1, or vice versa.

Let me check: If P1 is always the negation of P2, then they are contradictory.

From the truth table, yes, P1 is T exactly where P2 is F, and F where P2 is T. So P1 ≡ ~P2, and P2 ≡ ~P1.

So they are logically equivalent to each other's negations, meaning they are contradictory.

Wait, but I also need to determine if they are consistent or inconsistent. Wait, the question is to determine whether the statements are logically equivalent or contradictory. If neither, then determine whether they are consistent or inconsistent.

Wait, but in this case, they are contradictory, so the other options about consistency may not apply.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm using the terms correctly.

Logically equivalent: P1 and P2 have the same truth values in all rows.

Contradictory: P1 and P2 have opposite truth values in all rows.

Consistent: There is at least one row where both are true.

Inconsistent: There is no row where both are true.

Looking at the truth table, P1 and P2 are never true at the same time. So they cannot both be true in any situation, meaning they are inconsistent.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is whether the two statements are consistent or inconsistent. Two statements are consistent if there is at least one scenario where both are true. They are inconsistent if there's no such scenario.

From the truth table, P1 is false only in row6, and P2 is true only in row6. So in row6, P1 is false and P2 is true. In all other rows, P1 is true and P2 is false. So there is no row where both P1 and P2 are true. Therefore, the two statements are inconsistent.

But earlier, we found that they are contradictory. So they are both contradictory and inconsistent?

Wait, but the options are about whether they are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent.

Wait, the options are: the options are between being equivalent
