Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: When an increase in speed doubles the kinetic energy of a moving body, its momentum... and then there are several options.

Hmm, I remember that kinetic energy and momentum are both related to mass and velocity, but the exact formulas are a bit fuzzy in my head. Let me try to recall.

Kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula KE = (1/2)mv², right? And momentum (p) is p = mv. So both involve mass and velocity, but in different ways.

The problem states that the kinetic energy doubles. Let's call the initial speed v, so the initial KE is (1/2)m v². After the increase in speed, the KE becomes 2*(1/2 m v²) = m v². Let me call the new speed v'. So, (1/2)m (v')² = m v². Hmm, simplifying that.

Wait, let's write it out:

Initial KE: KE_initial = (1/2) m v²
After speed increase: KE_final = 2 * KE_initial = m v²

So setting KE_final equal to the new kinetic energy:

(1/2) m (v')² = m v²

I can cancel the m on both sides (assuming m is not zero, which it isn't for a moving body). So:

(1/2) (v')² = v²

Multiply both sides by 2:

(v')² = 2 v²

Take the square root of both sides:

v' = v * sqrt(2)

So the new speed is sqrt(2) times the original speed. Approximately 1.414 times the original v.

Now, what about momentum? Initial momentum is p_initial = m v.

After the speed change, p_final = m v' = m * (v * sqrt(2)) ) = m v * sqrt(2) = p_initial * sqrt(2)

So the momentum increases by a factor of sqrt(2), which is about 1.414. So it's more than the original, but less than doubling (since 2 is double). So the momentum becomes sqrt(2) times larger than before.

Wait, but let's check the options. The options are:

A: quadruples
B: is halved
C: depends on the mass of the object
D: triples
E: doubles
F: decreases
G: depends on factors not stated
H: remains the same
I: more than doubles
J: increases but less than doubles

So from what I calculated, the momentum increases by a factor of sqrt(2), which is about 1.414. So it's more than the initial but less than double (since double is 2). So the change is an increase, but less than doubling. So option J.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes factors can be tricky.

Let me rephrase: If KE doubles, then (1/2)m v'^2 = 2*(1/2 m v²) → m v'^2 = 2 m v^2 → v'^2 = 2 v^2 → v' = v sqrt(2). So velocity increases by sqrt(2).

Momentum is m v, so new momentum is m * v' = m v sqrt(2) → p' = p * sqrt(2). So p' is sqrt(2) times p, which is about 1.414 times the original. So the momentum increases, but not by as much as doubling (which would be a factor of 2). So the correct answer would be J: increases but less than doubles.

Alternatively, if I'm thinking about it another way, maybe using the relationship between KE and momentum. I remember that KE can be expressed in terms of momentum. Since p = mv, then v = p/m. Substituting into KE: KE = (1/2) m (p/m)^2 = p²/(2m). So KE is proportional to p squared over mass.

If KE doubles, then (p'^2)/(2m) = 2*(p²)/(2m). Wait, no, initial KE is (p²)/(2m), and final is 2*(p²)/(2m) → p'^2/(2m) = 2*(p²)/(2m). Multiply both sides by 2m: p'^2 = 2 p² → p' = p * sqrt(2). So same result as before. So yes, p increases by sqrt(2), which is less than 2.

So option J is correct.

When the speed of a moving body increases such that its kinetic energy doubles, the relationship between kinetic energy (KE) and momentum (p) can be analyzed using their respective formulas:

- Kinetic energy: \( KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \)
- Momentum: \( p = m v \)

Initially, the kinetic energy is \( KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). After the speed increases, the kinetic energy becomes \( KE_{\text{final}} = 2 \cdot KE_{\text{initial}} = m v^2 \). Let the new speed be \( v' \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{2} m (v')^2 = m v^2
\]

Canceling \( m \) (assuming \( m \neq 0 \)) and solving for \( v' \):

\[
(v')^2 = 2 v^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v' = v \sqrt{2}
\]

The new speed is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the original speed. Momentum, which depends linearly on velocity (\( p = m v \)), also increases. Initially, \( p_{\text{initial}} = m v \). After the speed change:

\[
p_{\text{final}} = m v' = m (v \sqrt{2}) = p_{\text{initial}} \sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the momentum increases by a factor of \( \sqrt{2} \), which is approximately 1.414. This means the momentum increases, but the increase is less than double (since doubling would correspond to a factor of 2).

From the given options:

- **A: quadruples** — Incorrect, as the momentum does not increase fourfold.
- **B: is halved** — Incorrect, as the momentum increases rather than decreases.
- **C: depends on the mass of the object** — Incorrect, as the mass cancels out in the derivation.
- **D: triples** — Incorrect, as the increase is not threefold.
- **E: doubles** — Incorrect, as the increase is less than double.
- **F: decreases** — Incorrect, as the momentum increases.
- **G: depends on factors not stated** — Incorrect, as the problem provides sufficient information.
- **H: remains the same** — Incorrect, as the momentum changes.
- **I: more than doubles** — Incorrect, as the increase is less than double.
- **J: increases but less than doubles** — Correct, as the momentum increases by \( \sqrt{2} \), which is less than 2.

The correct answer is **J: increases but less than doubles**.
