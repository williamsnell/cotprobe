Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the energy of photons at two different frequencies. I remember that the energy of a photon is calculated using the formula E = h * f, where h is Planck's constant. But wait, I need to make sure I have the right value for h. I think it's approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. 

So the problem has two parts. The first part is about blue light with a frequency of 7 x 10^14 Hz. I'll calculate that first. Let me plug in the numbers. E1 = 6.626e-34 J·s * 7e14 Hz. Let me do the multiplication. 6.626 times 7 is... let's see, 6*7 is 42, 0.626*7 is about 4.382, so total is 46.382. Then, the exponents: 10^-34 * 10^14 is 10^(-34+14) = 10^-20. So E1 is 46.382e-20 J. Wait, 46.382e-20 is the same as 4.6382e-19 J? Wait, no, because 46e-20 is 4.6e-19. Oh wait no, 46e-20 is 4.6e-19? Wait 46 times 1e-20 is 46e-20. Let me think: 1e-19 is 10e-20, so 46e-20 is 4.6e-19 J. So approximately 4.6e-19 J.

Now moving to the second part: the FM radiation with a frequency of 1e8 Hz. So E2 = 6.626e-34 * 1e8. Let's compute that. 6.626e-34 * 1e8 is 6.626e-26 J. Wait, 1e8 is 1e8, so 6.626e-34 * 1e8 = 6.626e-26 J. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to match these two energies. Let me list the options again. Option E is 4.6e-19 J and 6.6e-26 J. That's exactly what I calculated. Wait, but wait another look. Let me recheck my calculations just to be sure.

For the blue light: 7e14 Hz. 6.626e-34 *7e14 = (6.626 *7) = 46.382, and the exponents: 10^(-34 +14) = 1e-20. So 46.382e-20 J is 4.6382e-19 J, which I can round to 4.6e-19. So E1 is approximately 4.6e-19 J.

For the FM: 1e8 Hz. 6.626e-34 * 1e8 = 6.626e-26 J. Looking at the options, option E has 6.6e-26 J, which is very close. So E's second value is 6.6e-26, which matches.

Looking at the options: option E is (4.6e-19 J, 6.6e-26 J). That seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options in case I made a mistake. Option F is 7.5e-19 and 5e-26. I don't think so. Option E's first number is 4.6e-19, which matches my calculation. So yeah, the correct option should be E.

To determine the energy of the photons, we use the formula for the energy of a photon:

\[
E = h \cdot f
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( f \) is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.

### Step 1: Energy of the blue light photon
The frequency of blue light is given as \( f = 7 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
E_1 = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 7 \times 10^{14}
\]

First, calculate the product of the coefficients:

\[
6.626 \cdot 7 = 46.382
\]

Next, add the exponents:

\[
10^{-34} \cdot 10^{14} = 10^{-20}
\]

Thus:

\[
E_1 = 46.382 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} = 4.6382 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures:

\[
E_1 \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Energy of the FM radiation photon
The frequency of FM radiation is given as \( f = 1 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz} \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
E_2 = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 1 \times 10^8
\]

First, calculate the product of the coefficients:

\[
6.626 \cdot 1 = 6.626
\]

Next, add the exponents:

\[
10^{-34} \cdot 10^8 = 10^{-26}
\]

Thus:

\[
E_2 = 6.626 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures:

\[
E_2 \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Matching the results with the options
From the calculations:
- \( E_1 = 4.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)
- \( E_2 = 6.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)

The only option that matches these values is **Option E**: \( 4.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}, 6.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \).

### Final Answer:
E
