Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Carl Rogers' view of personality. Hmm, I remember Carl Rogers was a psychologist, part of the humanistic approach. Let me think. Humanistic psychology focuses on the individual's potential and self-actualization, right? So Rogers probably had a positive view of people.

The question is asking which option best summarizes his view. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says personality is formed by social roles and expectations. That sounds more like role theory or maybe something from sociology. I don't think that's Rogers; he was more about the individual's inner experience.

Option B: Behavioral expectations. That might relate to behaviorism, which focuses on observable behaviors. But Rogers was a humanist, so he probably looked beyond just behaviors to internal processes.

Option C: Traits are negative and destructive. That doesn't fit because humanists like Rogers are more optimistic about human nature, emphasizing positive traits and growth.

Option D: Genetic makeup. That's more of a biological perspective, like heritability. Rogers focused on environment and personal experiences, I believe.

Option E: Positive and goal-directed traits. This rings a bell. Rogers talked about the self and how people strive to actualize their potential. He believed in the inherent goodness of people, so this might be it.

Option F: Unconscious desires and conflicts. That's Freud's psychoanalysis. Rogers wasn't focused on the unconscious in that way; he was more about conscious experiences.

Option G: Traits like inhibition, extroversion, etc., are constant. That sounds like trait theory, maybe from someone like Allport. But Rogers might have seen people as changing and growing, not static.

Option H: Personality is constant and unchanging. Again, that doesn't seem right. Rogers probably believed in the possibility of change and personal growth.

Option I: Personalities vary based on traits, emotions, thoughts. This is a bit vague. While it's true, I think Rogers had a more specific view about the positive nature and self-actualization.

Option J: External environmental influences. That's more like behaviorism or social learning theory. Rogers did consider the environment, especially conditions of worth, but his main focus was on the individual's inner experience and potential.

So, going back, the key points for Rogers are: emphasis on the self, self-actualization, positive view of human nature, and the role of unconditional positive regard. Option E says people's traits are overwhelmingly positive and goal-directed, which aligns with his belief in the tendency toward self-actualization and the positive aspects of personality.

Wait, but another thought: Rogers talked about the ideal self and the real self. He believed that people have a natural inclination towards self-actualization but can be hindered by conditions of worth imposed by others. So the core of his theory is about the individual's innate drive towards positive growth.

So looking at the options, E seems to fit because it highlights positive traits and being goal-directed, which ties into self-actualization. I think that's the best choice here.
