Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about Tay-Sachs disease. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me the frequency of Tay-Sachs in the Jewish population of NYC as about 0.015, and much lower in non-Jewish individuals. But the actual numbers given are probably just context. The main question is about finding the equilibrium frequency of the Tay-Sachs gene under mutation and selection.

The problem states that the selection coefficient is 1, meaning that individuals with the disease (homozygotes) have zero fitness—they don't survive to reproduce. The forward mutation rate is 1e-6, which I think is the rate at which the normal allele mutates into the Tay-Sachs allele.

So, the equilibrium here is where mutation introducing the allele is balanced by selection against it. I remember that for a recessive disease, the equilibrium frequency can be modeled with a formula involving mutation rate and selection.

Wait, I think the equilibrium frequency (q) when considering mutation-selection balance for a recessive allele is given by q = sqrt(mu / s), where mu is the mutation rate and s is the selection coefficient. Wait, no—wait: I think that's for when selection is acting against the heterozygote as well. Or maybe that's when the allele is dominant. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me think. For a completely recessive allele, the selection is only against the homozygote. So the fitness of the heterozygote is 1, and the homozygote has fitness 1 - s. But in this case, s is 1 because the selection coefficient is 1. So the homozygote has fitness 0.

So the standard formula for equilibrium frequency when s=1 and mutation is mu, and the allele is recessive. I think the formula when selection is only against the recessive homozygote is q = sqrt(mu / (mu + hs)) ), but wait, that's when the heterozygote has some fitness. Wait, no, because here h is the dominance coefficient. Since the disease is recessive, h=0, so the heterozygote is not selected against. So the equation simplifies.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the balance between mutation introducing the allele and selection removing it. So the mutation rate is mu, so each generation, new recessive alleles are added. But each generation, some of these are removed because the homozygotes die.

The equilibrium happens when the input from mutation equals the loss due to selection.

In each generation, the frequency of the allele increases due to mutation. The mutation rate is mu (1e-6) for each allele. So the amount added each generation is approximately 2mu p, where p is the frequency of the normal allele. Wait, but at equilibrium, the allele is rare, so p is approximately 1. So mutation adds about 2mu each generation.

Wait, wait, no, mutation rate is per allele. So each normal allele (which is at frequency p ≈ 1) can mutate to the disease allele at rate mu. So the rate of new mutations per generation is mu multiplied by the number of normal alleles. Since there are 2N alleles in the population, but perhaps it's easier to model this in terms of allele frequencies.

Alternatively, for a diploid population, each individual has two alleles. The mutation rate from A to a (where A is normal and a is Tay-Sachs) is mu. So the frequency of new a alleles introduced each generation is mu times the frequency of A alleles. Since A is the normal allele, which is at frequency approximately 1 (since a is rare), the amount of a added each generation is approximately mu.

But selection removes a certain proportion of a alleles. Each a allele has a chance of being in a homozygote. The frequency of a is q, so the chance that an a allele is paired with another a is q. So the proportion of a alleles that are removed each generation is q * s, but wait, when s is 1, each homozygote a produces no offspring, so each a in a homozygote is removed.

Wait, the number of a alleles lost each generation is equal to the number of a alleles in homozygotes. The frequency of a is q, so the frequency of aa is q^2. Each aa individual has 2 a alleles, so the proportion of a alleles in aa is 2 q^2. Therefore, the loss per generation is 2 q^2 * s, but s=1 here. So the loss is 2 q^2.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the population, the total a alleles are 2N q. The number of aa individuals is N q^2 (assuming Hardy-Weinberg proportions). Each aa individual has 2 a alleles, so the total a alleles in aa is 2 N q^2. So the proportion of a alleles that are in aa is (2 N q^2) / (2 N q) ) = q. So the fraction of a alleles lost each generation is q, because each aa individual dies and doesn't pass on their a alleles.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Suppose the allele frequency of a is q. The proportion of the population that is aa is q². Each aa individual contributes 0 to the next generation because they die. So each aa individual removes two a alleles (since they don't pass any on), but perhaps it's better to model the change in q.

Alternatively, in the absence of mutation, the change in q after selection can be calculated. The genotype frequencies before selection are:

AA: (1-q)^2
Aa: 2 q (1 - q)
aa: q²

But because aa individuals don't survive (s=1), their contribution is zero. So the mean fitness of the population is (1-q)^2 + 2 q (1 - q) * 1 + q² * 0 = 1 - q².

The frequency of a after selection (before reproduction) is [2 q (1 - q) * (1/2) ) ] / (1 - q²). Wait, no. Let me think again.

After selection, the proportion of each genotype is:

AA: (1-q)^2 / (1 - q²)
Aa: [2 q (1 - q)] / (1 - q²)
aa: 0

The frequency of allele a after selection is:

Each AA contributes 0 a alleles, each Aa contributes 1 a allele. So the total a alleles in the population after selection is [2 q (1 - q) * 1 ] / (1 - q²) ) * (1/2) because each diploid individual has two alleles. Wait, no—maybe better to compute the allele frequency after selection.

The total number of a alleles after selection is:

From Aa individuals: each Aa individual has one a allele. So number of a alleles is (number of Aa individuals) * 1.

Number of Aa individuals after selection is [2 q (1 - q) ] * N, where N is the population size. So the number of a alleles from Aa is N * 2 q (1 - q) * 1.

Wait, but the total number of alleles after selection is 2N * (1 - q²), because the population size after selection is N*(1 - q²), since aa individuals die. So the allele frequency of a after selection is [2 q (1 - q) * 0.5 * N ] / [2 N (1 - q²) ) ].

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the allele frequency after selection. The frequency of a after selection is (2 * number of Aa * 1 + 2 * number of aa * 0 ) / (2 * total number of individuals after selection).

But since aa individuals are 0 after selection, it's (2 * Aa * 1) / (2 * (AA + Aa)).

The number of Aa individuals is 2 q (1 - q) N, each contributing 1 a allele. So the total a alleles after selection is (2 q (1 - q) N) * 1.

The total alleles in the population after selection is 2 N (1 - q²), since the population size is N (1 - q²).

So the frequency of a after selection is [2 q (1 - q) N * 1 ] / [2 N (1 - q²) ) ].

Simplify: (2 q (1 - q) ) / (2 (1 - q^2) )) ) = [ q (1 - q) ] / (1 - q^2 )

But 1 - q^2 = (1 - q)(1 + q), so this becomes q (1 - q) / [ (1 - q)(1 + q) ) ] = q / (1 + q)

But this is the frequency of a after selection but before reproduction. Then, when reproduction happens, mutation occurs. So the new q before selection in the next generation is the previous q after selection and mutation.

Wait, but in the model, mutation is a continuous process. To reach equilibrium, the increase in a due to mutation must balance the decrease due to selection.

So, let me model the equilibrium. At equilibrium, the allele frequency q is such that the input from mutation equals the loss due to selection.

In each generation, the loss of a is due to selection, which removes some a alleles. The loss is q^2 (since the aa individuals die), and each such individual has two a alleles, so the loss is 2 q^2 * 0.5? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the proportion of a alleles lost is q^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the change in q. The change due to selection is from q to q', where q' is after selection but before mutation. Then, mutation adds mu to q', giving the new q for the next generation.

Wait, but this might be getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for mutation-selection balance when the allele is recessive and only the homozygote is selected against.

In that case, the equilibrium frequency q is given by q = sqrt( (mu) / (s) ) ), but wait, I'm not sure. Wait, when the allele is recessive, the selection against it is only in the homozygote. So the strength of selection per a allele is q * s (because the chance that an a allele is in a homozygote is q). So the loss rate per a allele is approximately q * s. But in this case, s=1, so the loss rate is q.

The input from mutation is mu, which is the rate at which new a alleles are introduced. At equilibrium, the rate in equals the rate out. So mu = q * s. Wait, but that would give q = mu / s. Since s=1, q=mu=1e-6. But that can't be right because in the options, that's option C, but the answer given in the options is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Another approach: when an allele is maintained by mutation-selection balance and is recessive, the equilibrium frequency q is approximately sqrt(mu / (h s)) ), where h is the dominance coefficient. But in this case, the allele is recessive, so h=0, but that would make the denominator zero, which doesn't make sense. So that formula must be for a dominant or partially dominant allele.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula for a recessive allele is q = sqrt( (mu) / (s) ), but that would imply q = sqrt(1e-6 / 1) = 1e-3, which is 0.001. Looking at the options, option B is 0.001, which is one of the choices. But wait, the initial frequency given in the question is 0.015 in the Jewish population. But that's probably the current frequency, not the equilibrium.

Wait, but why would the equilibrium be 0.001? Let me think again.

Another approach: considering that each a allele has a chance of being in a homozygote, which is q. So the chance that an a allele is removed is q. So each a allele is lost at a rate of q per generation. The rate of introduction is mu per a allele.

At equilibrium, the rate of gain (mu) equals the rate of loss (q). So mu = q. Therefore, q = mu = 1e-6. But that's option C. But that seems off because the initial frequency is higher.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because each homozygote has two a alleles. So maybe the loss rate is 2q^2.

Wait, let's model it carefully. Let q be the frequency of the a allele. The number of a alleles is 2N q. The number of aa individuals is N q². Each aa individual has two a alleles, so the number of a alleles in aa individuals is 2 N q². So the fraction of a alleles that are in aa individuals is (2 N q²) / (2 N q) ) = q. So each a allele has a q chance of being in an aa individual, which dies, so the loss per a allele is q.

So the loss rate per a allele is q. The gain is mu, the mutation rate from A to a.

At equilibrium, the gain must equal the loss. So:

mu = loss rate = q.

So q = mu = 1e-6. That's option C.

But wait, that seems really low. The initial frequency is 0.015 in the Jewish population, but the equilibrium would be much lower. So why isn't the answer 0.001 (option B)? Because 0.001 is larger than 1e-6.

Wait, maybe the correct formula when the allele is recessive and selection is s=1 is q = sqrt(mu / (s)).

So sqrt(1e-6 / 1) = 1e-3, which is 0.001, option B.

Hmm, I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. I think I need to clarify the correct model.

In general, for a harmful recessive allele a, with mutation rate mu from A to a, and selection coefficient s (where aa individuals have fitness 1 - s), the equilibrium frequency is given by q ≈ sqrt( (mu) / (s) ) when mu is small and s is not too small.

Wait, because in each generation, the frequency of a is reduced by a factor due to selection. The change in q can be approximated as q' = q * sqrt(1 - s q). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the equilibrium occurs when the influx from mutation equals the loss from selection.

Alternatively, considering the allele frequency dynamics, the change in q due to selection is approximately -q^2 s, because each aa individual is removed, which reduces the a allele frequency. The mutation adds mu per generation.

So the equilibrium is when the mutation rate mu equals the loss from selection, which is approximately q² s.

So, mu = q² s.

Given that s=1, mu = q².

So q = sqrt(mu) = sqrt(1e-6) = 0.001.

So that would mean the equilibrium frequency is 0.001, which is option B.

But earlier, I thought of it as mu = q, leading to q = 1e-6. So which is correct?

I think the correct approach is that the loss per generation is q² s, so setting mu = q² s. So when s=1, q = sqrt(mu) = 1e-3.

So the correct answer should be 0.001, which is option B.

But wait, looking back, the answer options are:

A: 0.02

B: 0.001

C: 1e-6

D: 0.005

E: 0.00001

F: 0.1

G: 0.985

H: 0.01

I: 0.0001

J: 0.015

So option B is 0.001, which is our calculated value.

But wait, why is the initial frequency given as 0.015 in the Jewish population? Because that's the current frequency, but perhaps under mutation-selection balance, the equilibrium is 0.001. So the answer would be B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the loss is q². Wait, let's think again: the loss each generation is the number of a alleles removed. Each aa individual has two a alleles, so the number of a alleles lost is 2 * (number of aa individuals). The number of aa individuals is q² N. So the number of a alleles lost is 2 q² N.

The total number of a alleles in the population is 2 N q.

So the fraction of a alleles lost each generation is (2 q² N) / (2 N q) ) = q.

So each a allele has a q chance of being lost each generation.

Thus, the loss rate is q, and the gain is mu.

At equilibrium, mu = q.

So q = mu = 1e-6.

But that's option C. Now I'm confused because two different approaches are giving me different answers.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the loss is per allele or per genotype. Let me try another approach.

The allele frequency after selection is q' = q (1 - q s) / (1 - q² s), but for small q, this can be approximated. Alternatively, using the standard formula for selection against recessive alleles.

In the case of a rare allele (q close to 0), the change in q due to selection is approximately delta q ≈ - q² s. So the new q after selection is q' = q - q² s.

But then mutation adds mu to q', so the new q in the next generation is q' + mu ≈ (q - q² s) + mu.

At equilibrium, the change is zero, so:

q = (q - q² s) + mu.

Rearranging gives:

q² s = mu.

So q = sqrt( mu / s ).

Since s=1, q = sqrt(1e-6) = 0.001, which is option B.

Ah, I see. So the correct approach leads to q = sqrt(mu/s), which in this case is 0.001, option B.

So why did I get a different result earlier? Because I was considering the loss per allele as q, but perhaps the correct way is to model the change in q as delta q = -q² s, then add mutation. So the equilibrium condition is when the loss from selection equals the gain from mutation.

So yes, the correct answer is B: 0.001.
