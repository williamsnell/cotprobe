Okay, so I've got this insurance question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is about a house valued at $10,000, insured for $7,000. There's an 80% coinsurance clause. The house is damaged by fire, and the loss is $8,500. I need to find out how much the insurance company will pay and how much the owner must pay.

Hmm. Coinsurance, right. I remember that coinsurance clauses require the policyholder to insure the property for a certain percentage of its value. If they don't, the insurer doesn't pay the full amount of the loss. So the idea is that the insured shares some of the risk.

So the coinsurance is 80%. That means the policyholder must insure the property for at least 80% of its value. Let me check the numbers here. The value is $10,000, so 80% of that is $8,000. The policy is for $7,000, which is less than $8,000. So the insured didn't meet the coinsurance requirement.

Wait, but wait. The coinsurance works in such a way that if the insured amount is less than the required percentage, the insured has to share a part of the loss. So the formula I think is: the insurance company pays the lesser of the policy amount or the actual loss, but adjusted by the coinsurance.

Wait, no, I think the coinsurance affects how much is covered. So the coinsurance formula is usually something like: (Amount of Insurance / Required Insurance) * Actual Loss, but not more than the policy limit.

Let me think. The required insurance is 80% of the value, which is $8,000 as I calculated. The actual insurance is $7,000. So the ratio is 7,000 / 8,000 = 0.875, or 87.5%.

So for the loss of $8,500, the insurance company would pay 87.5% of that, but wait, can that exceed the policy limit? Let me see.

So 87.5% of $8,500 is let's calculate that. 8,500 * 0.875. Let me do the math. 8,500 * 0.8 is 6,800, and 8,500 * 0.075 is 637.5. Adding them together gives 6,800 + 637.5 = 7,437.5. Hmm, but the policy amount is only $7,000. So does that mean the insurance company pays the lesser of $7,437.5 and $7,000? So they pay $7,000, which is the policy limit.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the coinsurance clause requires the insured to carry at least $8,000. Since they only have $7,000, which is less, the insurance company's liability is reduced. So the formula is (insurance amount / required amount) * loss, but cannot exceed the policy limit.

So in this case, the calculation would be (7,000 / 8,000) * 8,500. Let's compute that.

7,000 divided by 8,000 is 0.875. Multiply by 8,500: 8,500 * 0.875 = 7,437.50. But the policy only covers up to $7,000. So the insurance company would pay $7,000, because that's the maximum they're liable for.

Wait, but wait another moment. Another way to think about it: the insurance company's maximum payment is the lesser of the policy amount or the calculated coinsurance amount. So if the coinsurance calculation is higher than the policy, they pay the policy amount.

So in this scenario, the calculated amount is $7,437.50, but the policy is $7,000. So the insurance company pays $7,000.

Wait no, that can't be right. Because the coinsurance is about the insured's coverage. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the insurance company's payment is the lesser of the actual loss or the policy limit, multiplied by the coinsurance factor. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to determine the amount recoverable under coinsurance. So the formula is:

Recovery = (Insurance Amount / Required Insurance) * Loss, but cannot exceed the insurance amount.

So the required insurance is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. The insurance amount is $7,000.

So the ratio is 7,000 / 8,000 = 0.875.

Then, the loss is $8,500. So the recoverable amount is 0.875 * 8,500 = $7,437.50.

But the policy only covers up to $7,000. So the insurance company would pay up to $7,000 because that's the policy limit. Wait, no, because 7,437.50 is more than 7,000, so they pay 7,000. But wait, isn't the policy limit the maximum they can pay regardless of the coinsurance? No, I think not. Because the coinsurance might require them to pay a portion. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the coinsurance clause says that the insured must maintain insurance equal to a certain percentage (here, 80%) of the property's value. If they don't, then the insurance company will only pay a proportion of the loss.

So the formula is (Amount of Insurance / Required Amount) * Loss.

But the insurance company can't pay more than the policy limit. So if the calculation is higher than the policy limit, they pay the policy limit. If it's lower, they pay the calculated amount.

Wait no, that's not correct. Because the coinsurance is about the insured's coverage. The insurance company's payment is the lesser of:

- The actual loss, or

- The policy limit,

but adjusted by the coinsurance factor if applicable.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the coinsurance formula again. Oh wait, I can't look things up; I have to think based on what I know.

So the coinsurance formula is: 

Amount of Recovery = (Amount of Insurance / Required Insurance) × Loss 

But this cannot exceed the policy's face amount.

So in this case, the required insurance is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. The amount of insurance is $7,000, which is less than $8,000.

So the ratio is 7,000 / 8,000 = 0.875.

The loss is $8,500. So 0.875 × 8,500 = $7,437.50.

Now, the policy's face amount is $7,000, which is less than $7,437.50. So the insurance company will pay $7,000, because that's the maximum they're liable for.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because if the loss is $8,500, and the policy is for $7,000, then without coinsurance, they'd pay up to $7,000. But with the coinsurance, they have to pay less because the insured didn't meet the 80% requirement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's try another approach. The coinsurance penalty comes into play when the insured's coverage is less than the required percentage. So the insurance company's liability is reduced by the same proportion.

So the maximum the insurance company would pay is their coverage multiplied by (insurance / required). So 7,000 * (7,000 / 8,000) = 7,000 * 0.875 = 6,125. No, wait, that can't be right because the loss is higher.

Wait, perhaps it's (insurance/required) * loss, but capped at the policy limit.

Wait, let me try an example. Suppose the loss is $8,500.

If the insured had met the required 80%, i.e., $8,000, then the insurance company would pay the full $8,000 if the loss was $8,500, but wait, no, because the policy is only $7,000 in this case. Wait, no, wait, in the problem, the policy is $7,000, but the required is $8,000.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the insurance company's maximum liability is the lesser of the policy limit or the coinsurance-adjusted loss.

So the coinsurance-adjusted loss is (7,000 / 8,000) * 8,500 = 7,437.50.

The policy limit is $7,000. So the insurance company pays the lesser of these two, which is $7,000.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coinsurance-adjusted amount is higher than the policy limit. So the insurance company would just pay the policy limit, which is $7,000.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. If the policy had been for $8,000, then the insurance company would have paid the full $8,000 (since the loss is $8,500, which is more than $8,000). But in this case, the policy is $7,000, which is below the required 80%. So the insurance company's payment is limited by the coinsurance formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is that the insurance company pays the lesser of the policy amount or the coinsurance-adjusted loss. So in this case, the coinsurance-adjusted loss is $7,437.50, which is more than the policy's $7,000. So they pay $7,000.

Wait, but that can't be right because then the coinsurance clause doesn't affect the payment when the policy is lower. That would mean that having a lower policy just means lower coverage, but without considering the coinsurance. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coinsurance.

Wait, another approach: The insurance company's liability is calculated as the lesser of:

1. The face amount of the policy, or

2. The coinsurance percentage multiplied by the value of the property, or

3. The actual cash value of the loss, adjusted by the coinsurance.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the coinsurance first.

The formula for the amount the insurance company pays is the minimum of:

- The policy limit,

- The actual loss,

but adjusted by the coinsurance factor if the insured didn't meet the required coverage.

So the adjustment is: (policy amount / required amount) * actual loss.

So the required amount is 80% of $10,000 = $8,000.

Policy amount is $7,000, which is less than $8,000.

So the adjustment factor is 7,000 / 8,000 = 0.875.

Then, the insurance company's payment is 0.875 * 8,500 = $7,437.50.

But wait, the policy's maximum is $7,000, so the insurance company can't pay more than that. So they pay $7,000.

Wait, but that's confusing because the coinsurance-adjusted amount is higher than the policy limit, so they pay the policy limit. But in that case, the coinsurance doesn't reduce the payment. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the insurance company's payment is the lesser of the policy limit and the coinsurance-adjusted loss. So if the coinsurance-adjusted loss is more than the policy limit, they pay the policy limit. If it's less, they pay the adjusted loss.

In this case, the adjusted loss is $7,437.50, which is more than $7,000, so they pay $7,000.

But that seems contradictory because the coinsurance is meant to penalize the insured for under-insuring. So if the policy is $7,000 and the required is $8,000, the insured is penalized by having a lower coverage. So perhaps the insurance company would only pay a portion of the $7,000.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The coinsurance clause says that the insured must carry insurance equal to at least 80% of the value. If they don't, then the insurance company's payment is based on the ratio of what they have to what they should have.

So the insurance company's payment is (insurance / required) * loss, but not to exceed the policy limit.

So, (7,000 / 8,000) = 0.875.

0.875 * 8,500 = 7,437.50.

But since the policy is only $7,000, the insurance company pays the lesser of 7,437.50 and 7,000, which is 7,000.

Wait, but that doesn't penalize the insured for under-insuring. Because if the loss is $8,500, and the policy is $7,000, the insurance company just pays the full $7,000, regardless of the coinsurance. That doesn't make sense because the coinsurance is supposed to encourage the insured to purchase sufficient coverage.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let's say the required insurance is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. The insured only has $7,000, so they're $1,000 short.

The loss is $8,500. Without coinsurance, the insurance company would pay up to $7,000. But because of coinsurance, they have to determine how much they should pay.

The formula I think is: (Insurance / (Value * Coinsurance %)) * Loss.

So (7000 / (10000 * 0.8)) * 8500.

Which is 7000 / 8000 = 0.875.

0.875 * 8500 = 7437.50.

But wait, the policy is only for $7,000. So the insurance company can't pay more than that. So they pay $7,000.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So in this case, the insurance company pays the full policy amount because the coinsurance-adjusted amount is higher than the policy limit.

But that would mean that the coinsurance clause doesn't apply in this scenario, which doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the coinsurance affects the maximum amount the insurance company will pay, but the actual payment can't exceed the policy limit.

Wait, perhaps the coinsurance clause reduces the maximum the insurance company would pay, but in this case, the policy limit is lower than that reduced amount.

Wait, let me think of it as the insurance company's maximum liability after applying coinsurance is the lesser of the policy limit and (coinsurance percentage * value). So 80% of $10,000 is $8,000. So the maximum they would pay is $8,000, but the policy is only $7,000. So the insurance company's maximum is $7,000.

So for a loss of $8,500, the insurance company would pay the lesser of $8,000 (80% of value) and $7,000 (policy limit), which is $7,000.

But then, how does the coinsurance affect the payment in this case? Because the loss is higher than both the policy and the coinsurance limit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the options provided. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

Looking at the options, option H is $7,000, which would be the policy limit. Option J is $7,437.50, which is the coinsurance-adjusted amount, but that's higher than the policy limit, so the insurance company can't pay that. So the payment would be $7,000.

But wait, I thought the coinsurance would reduce the payment if the insured didn't meet the required coverage. But in this case, the payment is the full policy amount. That doesn't seem to make sense because the insured underinsured by $1,000.

Wait another angle: The coinsurance clause might mean that the insured shares the loss in proportion to their underinsurance. So the insurance company's payment is (insurance / required) * loss, but not exceeding the policy.

So (7000/8000)*8500 = 7437.50, but since the policy is 7000, they cap it at 7000. So yes, they pay 7000.

But that would mean that the owner's loss is 8500, so the owner has to pay the remaining 1500.

Wait, but the question is how much will the insurance company pay and how much must the owner assume.

So if the insurance pays 7000, the owner pays 8500 -7000 = 1500.

Looking at the options, option I is $1,500, which is the owner's share.

But wait, the question asks two things: how much the insurance company pays and how much the owner must assume. But the options only give single answers. Oh wait, the question is part of a multiple-choice, so perhaps each option is the insurance company's payment, and the owner's share is the remainder.

Looking back, the options are labeled A through J, each a single value. So the question is, which is the correct payment by the insurance company. The owner's share would be 8500 minus that.

So if the insurance company pays 7000, then the owner pays 1500, which is option I.

But wait, the answer options are only for the insurance company's payment, I think. Because the way the question is phrased is: "how much will the insurance company pay on the loss? How much of the loss must the owner assume?"

But the options are single amounts, so perhaps each option represents the insurance company's payment.

Looking at the options, H is 7000, which would mean the owner assumes 1500 (option I). But the way the options are presented, perhaps each option is the insurance company's payment.

So the correct answer would be H: $7,000.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident because I thought the coinsurance would reduce the payment further.

Alternatively, perhaps the coinsurance clause calculates the insurance company's maximum liability as (policy amount) multiplied by (policy amount / required amount). So 7000 * (7000/8000) = 7000 * 0.875 = 6125. So the insurance company would pay 6125. But that's not one of the options. Wait, option C is 6250, which is close but not exactly 6125.

Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the insurance company's payment is the minimum of:

- The policy amount,

- The coinsurance-adjusted amount,

- The actual loss.

So the coinsurance-adjusted amount is (7000/8000)*8500 = 7437.50.

But the policy is 7000, which is less than 7437.50. So the insurance company pays 7000.

Thus, the insurance company pays 7000, and the owner pays 1500.

Looking at the options, H is 7000, which would be the
