Okay, so I have this question about which planets in our solar system have active plate tectonics. Hmm, I remember that plate tectonics is a process where the outer layer of a planet (the lithosphere) is broken into plates that move. This movement is responsible for things like earthquakes and volcanic activity. 

I think Earth definitely has active plate tectonics because that's where the theory was developed. So Earth is one for sure. But what about the others? 

Venus is often compared to Earth because they're similar in size. I've heard that Venus has volcanoes, but I'm not sure if it has moving tectonic plates. I think Venus's surface is younger overall, which might suggest that it doesn't have the same kind of plate tectonics as Earth. Or wait, maybe it does have some tectonic activity but not in the same way. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Mars is another planet I'm considering. I know Mars has volcanoes like Olympus Mons, the largest in the solar system. But does that mean it has plate tectonics? I'm not sure. I think Mars's surface is more static, with less movement. The tectonics there might be more related to volcanic activity rather than moving plates.

What about the gas giants? Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all gas or ice giants. They don't have solid surfaces, so I don't think they can have plate tectonics. Their structures are more about atmospheric layers and liquid interiors, not solid plates.

So putting it all together, Earth definitely has active plate tectonics. Venus and Mars might have some tectonic activity, but I don't think it's the same as Earth's. The other planets either don't have solid surfaces or don't show signs of moving plates.

Looking at the options, option G is Earth. So the correct answer must be G.

The correct answer is G: Earth. Earth is the only planet in the solar system with active plate tectonics. Venus and Mars show some tectonic activity, but it is not the same as Earth's moving plates. The gas giants lack solid surfaces necessary for plate tectonics.

Answer: G
