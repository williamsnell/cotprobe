Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the sources of information on the credit rating of retail businesses. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for an important source of credit ratings specifically for retail businesses. I remember that credit ratings are usually provided by certain agencies. I've heard of some big names in this area.

Option A is Equifax, Inc. Equifax is one of the major credit bureaus, right? They provide credit reports and scores for individuals, but do they also handle businesses? I think they might have some business services too, but I'm not sure if they're the primary source for retail businesses.

Option B is the National Retail Federation. That sounds like a trade organization for retailers. They might provide industry data or advocacy, but I'm not sure they directly provide credit ratings. More about the industry as a whole rather than individual business credit.

Option C is the Small Business Administration. They help small businesses with loans and resources, but again, I don't think they rate credit. They might provide information on how to get credit, not the ratings themselves.

Option D is the local chamber of commerce. Chambers might have some local business info, maybe even reputation, but I don't think they issue credit ratings. They're more for networking and local business support.

Option E is Moody's Corporation. Oh yeah, Moody's is a big name in credit ratings. They rate the creditworthiness of corporations and governments. They probably cover retail businesses too, especially larger ones. But wait, are they the main source for retail specifically?

Option F is the United States Department of Commerce. They collect economic data and might have stats on retail sales and such, but I don't think they issue credit ratings. More about economic indicators than individual business credit.

Option G is the Retail Merchants Association. Another trade group, maybe similar to the National Retail Federation. They might offer member benefits but not credit ratings.

Option H is Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. Oh right, D&B is well-known for business credit reports. They provide detailed credit information and ratings for businesses. So this seems very relevant. They might be the primary source for business credit ratings.

Option I is the Better Business Bureau. They handle complaints and give ratings based on business practices, not creditworthiness. So BBB ratings are about trust and customer service, not credit.

Option J is the United States Retail Credit Association. Hmm, not sure about this one. Sounds like it could be related to retail credit, but I don't recall this being a major player. Maybe it's a smaller organization or perhaps it's not the main source.

So putting it all together: the question is about credit ratings for retail businesses. The main agencies I know for business credit are Dun & Bradstreet (H), Equifax (A), and maybe Experian, but they're not listed here. Also, Moody's (E) does credit ratings, but they're more for larger corporations and bonds, not necessarily retail businesses' credit ratings.

Between Equifax and D&B, I think Dun & Bradstreet is more specialized in business credit. Equifax is more for personal credit, though they do have business services. So the important source would be H: Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.

Wait, but the question specifies "retail businesses." Does that make a difference? Maybe not, since D&B covers all types of businesses, including retail.

So I think the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is H: Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. 

Dun & Bradstreet is a leading provider of business credit information and ratings, making it an important source for assessing the creditworthiness of retail businesses. While other options like Equifax and Moody's also provide credit-related services, Dun & Bradstreet is particularly recognized for its focus on business credit data.

Answer: H
