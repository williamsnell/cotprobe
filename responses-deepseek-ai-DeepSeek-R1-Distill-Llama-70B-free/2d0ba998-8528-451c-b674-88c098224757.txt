Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. Two electrically charged balls are separated by a short distance, and they produce a force of 50 microNewtons between them. Now, the charge on each ball stays the same, but the mass of one of the balls is doubled. The question is asking what the new electric force between them will be. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, wait. Electric force between two charges... I remember Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law states that the electric force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * (q1 * q2) / r², where k is Coulomb's constant.

So in this problem, the charges on both balls are kept the same. So q1 and q2 don't change. The distance r isn't mentioned as changing either. So according to Coulomb's law, if q1, q2, and r stay the same, the force should remain the same.

But wait, the problem says the mass of one of the balls is doubled. Oh, mass. So the electric force depends on charge, not mass. So changing the mass shouldn't affect the electric force between them. Unless... unless there's some other factor I'm missing here.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing concepts. Coulomb's law is purely about electric charges and distance. It doesn't take into account the masses of the objects. So whether the mass changes or not, as long as the charges and the distance are the same, the electric force remains the same.

So the initial force was 50 μN. After doubling the mass of one ball, the charges are unchanged, so the force should still be 50 μN. Let me look at the options. Option H is 50 μN.

I think that's the correct answer because the electric force doesn't depend on mass. It's all about the charges and the distance. So even though one ball is more massive, the electric force remains the same.

Coulomb's law describes the electric force between two charges as \( F = k \cdot \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2} \), where \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) are the charges, \( r \) is the distance between them, and \( k \) is Coulomb's constant. The problem states that the charges on both balls remain unchanged, and the distance between them is also constant. 

The electric force depends only on the charges and the distance, not on the masses of the objects. Therefore, doubling the mass of one ball does not affect the electric force between the two balls. Since the initial force was \( 50 \, \mu N \), the force remains \( 50 \, \mu N \) after the mass change.

The correct answer is:

H: 50 μN

Answer: H
