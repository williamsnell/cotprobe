Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which New Age musician released an album called 'King of the Pan3Flute' in 1998. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all these artists, but let me think through each option.

First, I know that New Age music often features instruments like the pan flute, so that's a hint. The album title mentions the pan3flute, which I'm guessing is a pan flute, maybe with a typo or a creative spelling.

Looking at the options:

A: Andreas Vollenweider - I think he's known for the harp, not the pan flute. So probably not him.

B: Kitaro - I remember Kitaro uses a lot of synthesizers and is from Japan. Not sure about pan flute being his main thing.

C: Zamfir - Wait, I've heard of Zamfir before. Isn't he known as the "Master of the Pan Flute"? That rings a bell. I think he's a Romanian musician who plays the pan flute extensively. So this might be the right choice.

D: Enigma - They're more of a project with electronic and Gregorian chant influences. Don't think they focus on pan flute.

E: Vangelis - He's known for synth music, like the Chariots of Fire theme. Not pan flute.

F: Yanni - He's a Greek composer and pianist. His music is more orchestral, not specifically pan flute.

G: Jean-Michel Jarre - Another synth-heavy artist. Not associated with pan flute.

H: Enya - She's known for her ethereal vocals and new age sound, but I don't recall her using pan flute prominently.

I: Tangerine Dream - They're a German electronic band, so not relevant here.

J: Kenny G - He's a saxophonist, so definitely not.

So putting it all together, the one associated with the pan flute is Zamfir. The album title 'King of the Pan3Flute' likely refers to him. I'm pretty sure he released that album around that time.
