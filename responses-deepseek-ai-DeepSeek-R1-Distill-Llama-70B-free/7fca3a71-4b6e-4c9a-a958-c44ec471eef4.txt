Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the first names of the early American explorers Lewis and Clark. Hmm, I remember that they were famous for their expedition, but I'm a bit fuzzy on their actual first names.

Wait, Lewis and Clark... I think their names are Meriwether and William. Let me try to recall. I think Meriwether Lewis was one of them. He was the leader, right? And Clark... wasn't his first name William? So the pair would be Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. 

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Martin and Walter. No, that doesn't sound right. I don't think either of them was named Martin or Walter.

Option B: Matthew and Charles. Nope, I don't remember those names associated with them.

Option C: Mitchell and Warren. Not these either. I don't think those are their first names.

Option D: Michael and Christopher. No, that's not it. Those names are more common but not matching Lewis and Clark.

Option E: Meredith and George. Meredith sounds a bit off. I don't think so.

Option F: Marcus and Wilson. Marcus maybe, but Wilson doesn't ring a bell. I think Clark's first name starts with a W, though.

Option G: Cabot and Joseph. Cabot is a surname I'm familiar with, like John Cabot, but not for these explorers.

Option H: Meriwether and William. Yes, that's it! Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. So H should be the correct answer.

Option I: Morgan and Mason. No, those don't fit.

Option J: Miles and Wesley. Doesn't seem right either.

So I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is H.
