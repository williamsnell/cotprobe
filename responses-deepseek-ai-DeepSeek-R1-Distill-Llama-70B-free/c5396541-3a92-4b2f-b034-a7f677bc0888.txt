Okay, so I have this question about gerrymandering and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let's start by recalling what I know about gerrymandering.

Gerrymandering is the manipulation of electoral district boundaries for political advantage. It's usually done to favor one party over another. I remember it's named after Elbridge Gerry, a governor who did this in Massachusetts, and a newspaper cartoon compared the district shape to a salamander, hence "gerrymander".

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: "is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations." Hmm. I think that's not true. I mean, the US certainly allows it to some extent, though courts sometimes strike it down. Other countries probably have their own versions. So if A says it's universally disallowed, that's false. So this might be the exception.

Option B: "is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system." Wait, I don't think that's correct. The US is a two-party system and gerrymandering is definitely a thing there. So if B says it's only possible in multi-party, that's wrong. So either B or A might be the answer.

Option C: "is a strategy utilized by both major political parties in the United States." Yes, that's true. Both Democrats and Republicans do it when they can. So C is a true statement.

Option D: "can lead to an increase in voter turnout." Wait, I'm not so sure. I think gerrymandering often leads to safe districts, which might make elections less competitive. If voters feel their vote doesn't matter because the district is safe, they might not turn out. But I also read somewhere that sometimes gerrymandering can increase turnout in certain situations, but I'm not certain. Maybe it's not the main effect, but the option says it's possible. So D could be a true statement.

Option E: "can divide like-minded voters into several districts to reduce their influence." Yes, that's a common tactic called splitting or cracking. So E is true.

Option F: "is a strategy used to increase the number of districts with a majority of minority voters." That sounds like it's referring to majority-minority districts. I think gerrymandering can sometimes be used to pack minorities into a district to ensure their representation, but sometimes it's also used to split them. Maybe F is talking about creating those districts. So F could be true.

Option G: "has been allowed by the Supreme Court in some instances." Yes, the Supreme Court has ruled on gerrymandering cases. For example, in some cases, they allowed it if it's for certain reasons like creating majority-minority districts, but struck it down when it's purely political. So G is true.

Option H: "increases the control voters have over their elected officials." No, I think the opposite. Gerrymandering can lead to elected officials having safe seats, so voters have less influence because the outcome is predictable. So H is false. But wait, the question is about which is the exception, the false statement. So if the question says "all statements are true except", and H is false, then H would be the answer. But wait, I thought earlier that A and B are also possibly false.

Option I: "favors incumbent candidates over challengers." Yes, that's correct. Gerrymandering often protects incumbents by making their districts safer. So I is true.

Wait, let me go back. The question is about which is not true, the exception.

So the options are A through I, J maybe, but the choices given are A to I.

So I need to find which is the false statement about gerrymandering.

Option A: Is it universally disallowed? No, because it's allowed in the US to some extent, as the Supreme Court allows it under certain conditions. So A is false. So the answer would be A.

Option B: Is it only possible in multi-party systems? No, the US is a two-party system and it's done there. So B is also false. So now I'm confused because both A and B seem incorrect.

But the question is about which is the exception. So I need to figure out which one is not true, the rest are true.

Wait, the options are from A to I, so the question is to find which is the false statement.

So let's think again.

Option B: "is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system." That's not correct because the US, a two-party system, does gerrymandering. So B is false.

So the question is which is the NOT true statement. So the question is 'all are true except that it...'

So the correct options are the ones that are true except one.

So the false statements are the exceptions.

So if both A and B are false, but the options only allow choosing one, but I need to see what the question asks.

Wait, let me re-express the question: All of the following statements about gerrymandering are true EXCEPT that it...

So the options are statements, and we need to pick the one that's not true.

So let's go through each.

A: It's universally disallowed in all democratic nations. Not true, because US allows it.

B: It's only possible in multi-party systems. Not true, because US is two-party and does it.

C: Used by both major parties in US. True.

D: Can increase voter turnout. I'm not sure, but perhaps possible? Maybe when districts are competitive, but gerrymandering usually makes them less so. So maybe D is false, but I'm not certain.

E: Divide like-minded voters. True.

F: Strategy to increase districts with minority majority. True, like in majority-minority districts.

G: Allowed by SC in some cases. True.

H: Increases voter control. False, because it decreases.

I: Favors incumbents. True.

So the statements that are not true are A, B, H, and maybe D.

But the question is which is the exception, so the question is looking for the one statement that is false.

The options are:

A: is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations.

So, is this true? No. Because the US allows it, so it's not disallowed everywhere. So A is false.

B: is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system.

No, as US has two-party and does it. So B is false.

H: increases the control voters have over their elected officials.

No, it decreases, so H is false.

So the question is which of these is NOT true. So the question is, which is the exception. So which one is not true about gerrymandering.

So the options include A, B, H, and maybe D as not true.

But the question is about which is the exception.

Now, I need to see which is the correct answer.

The question asks, which is NOT true about gerrymandering.

Looking back, the options:

A: universally disallowed in all democratic nations. So, if any democratic nation allows it, A is false. Since the US does, A is false.

B: only possible in multi-party. US is two-party and does it, so B is false.

So the question is, the statements are all true except one. So which is the false one.

I think the options may have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option.

Option A says it's universally disallowed. That's incorrect because in the US, it's still done. So A is false.

Option B says it's only possible in multi-party systems. That's incorrect because the US is two-party and they do it. So B is false.

So now, I have two options that are false. But the question says only one is the exception.

Wait, perhaps the question is set up so that only one option is the incorrect statement.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's consider the statements again.

Option A: is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations.

No, it's not disallowed in the US. So A is false.

Option B: is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system.

No, because even in two-party systems like the US, it's done. So B is false.

So both A and B are false. But that can't be, because the question is multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, the options are from A to I, so perhaps I should re-examine each.

Option H: increases the control voters have over their elected officials.

No, gerrymandering usually reduces this because districts can be safe, so voters have less influence. So H is false.

So now, I have A, B, H as false.

But the options only have one correct answer, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, let's read the options again.

The question is: All of the following statements about gerrymandering are true EXCEPT that it...

So, which one is the false statement.

Looking at each option.

A: is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations.

No, it's not disallowed in the US. So A is false.

B: is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system.

No, US does it in a two-party system. So B is false.

C: is a strategy utilized by both major political parties in the US. True.

D: can lead to an increase in voter turnout.

I'm not sure about this. Gerrymandering can sometimes create more competitive districts, but usually, it makes them less so. Wait, but sometimes, in packing, you might have some competitive districts elsewhere. Or perhaps in some cases, it can increase turnout if certain groups are mobilized. I'm not certain whether D is true or false, but I'm leaning towards it being false because gerrymandering more often leads to safe seats and lower turnout.

E: can divide like-minded voters into several districts to reduce their influence. True.

F: is a strategy used to increase the number of districts with a majority of minority voters. True, as in majority-minority districts.

G: has been allowed by the Supreme Court in some instances. True, e.g., when based on race in a way that's constitutional.

H: increases the control voters have over their elected officials. False.

I: favors incumbent candidates over challengers. True.

So, the false statements are A, B, H, and possibly D.

But the question asks for the exception, so the one that's not true. So among the options, which one is the false statement.

Wait, the question is phrased as "all are true except that it...".

So, the correct answer is the statement that is not true about gerrymandering.

So, which of the options is not true.

Looking at the options, H says it increases voter control. That's not true, so H is the false statement.

But also, A and B are false.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's validity.

Option A: No, gerrymandering isn't disallowed everywhere. So A is false.

Option B: As the US has it in a two-party system, B is false.

Option H: Gerrymandering doesn't increase voter control, so H is false.

So, the question is which of these is NOT true. So the question is, which is the exception. So which one is the false statement.

But the options are A through I, and the question is which is the exception.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is A, because it's a common misconception. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, because gerrymandering is possible in any electoral system, regardless of the number of parties.

Wait, but the question is which is the false statement.

So, given that, perhaps the correct answer is A: it's universally disallowed. Because it's not; it's allowed in the US in some forms, so A is false.

But I'm also seeing that B is false, as it's possible in two-party systems.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A: is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations.

But the US allows it, so A is false.

Option B: is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system.

But the US is two-party and does it, so B is false.

So both A and B are false, but the question expects only one correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each option is saying.

Option A is about being disallowed. Since it's not disallowed in the US, A is false.

Option B is about being possible only in multi-party. Since US is two-party and does it, B is false.

So both A and B are not true, but the question is asking for the exception.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B, because gerrymandering is possible in any system, regardless of the number of parties.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the intended answer is A, because it's a common misconception that it's banned everywhere.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to think of the options given.

The question is: which is the exception, meaning which statement is not true about gerrymandering.

So, the correct answer is the one that is not true.

Option H says it increases voter control. That's not true, so H is false.

So, if I go through each option, H is definitely false.

But so are A and B.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the options again.

The question is about which is the exception. So, the statement that is NOT true.

So, the correct answer is the one that is not true about gerrymandering.

So, if I go through each option:

- A: False, because not all democratic nations disallow it.

- B: False, because possible in two-party systems.

- C: True.

- D: Not sure, but possible.

- E: True.

- F: True.

- G: True.

- H: False.

- I: True.

So, the question is which is NOT true, so the answer must be one of A, B, or H.

But the options are multiple-choice, so the intended answer is probably H.

Wait, no, because the question is about the exception: all are true except that it...

So, the statement that is not true. So which one is not true.

I think the correct answer is A, because it's a common misunderstanding. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H.

Because gerrymandering reduces voter control, so H is false.

So, the answer is H.

Wait, but the question is about which is the exception, the statement that is not true.

So, the options are:

A: universally disallowed in all democratic nations → Not true.

B: only possible in multi-party systems → Not true.

H: increases voter control → Not true.

So, three options. But the question expects one correct answer.

I think I need to look for the most clearly incorrect statement.

Option H is clearly incorrect because gerrymandering decreases voter influence, so H is false.

Option A is also incorrect because it's not disallowed everywhere, but perhaps some countries do disallow it.

So, the answer is H.

But wait, looking back, perhaps the intended answer is A.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I'll go with H as the answer, because it's clearly false.

To determine which statement about gerrymandering is NOT true, we analyze each option:

- **A**: "is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations."  
  This is false because gerrymandering is not universally disallowed; for example, it is practiced in the United States, albeit with some legal constraints.

- **B**: "is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system."  
  This is also false because gerrymandering occurs in the United States, which has a two-party system.

- **C**: "is a strategy utilized by both major political parties in the United States."  
  This is true, as both Democrats and Republicans engage in gerrymandering when possible.

- **D**: "can lead to an increase in voter turnout."  
  This is debatable. While gerrymandering often reduces voter turnout by creating safe districts, it can occasionally increase turnout in specific contexts, so this statement is plausible.

- **E**: "can divide like-minded voters into several districts to reduce their influence."  
  This is true, as gerrymandering often involves splitting or cracking voter groups to dilute their influence.

- **F**: "is a strategy used to increase the number of districts with a majority of minority voters."  
  This is true, as gerrymandering can be used to create majority-minority districts.

- **G**: "has been allowed by the Supreme Court in some instances."  
  This is true, as the Supreme Court has permitted gerrymandering in certain cases, such as when it serves compelling governmental interests.

- **H**: "increases the control voters have over their elected officials."  
  This is false because gerrymandering often reduces voter influence by creating safe districts where the outcome is predictable.

- **I**: "favors incumbent candidates over challengers."  
  This is true, as gerrymandering often protects incumbents by making their districts safer.

The question asks for the statement that is NOT true about gerrymandering. While both **A** and **B** are false, **H** is the most clearly and directly false statement, as gerrymandering inherently reduces voter control over elected officials.

ANSWER: H
