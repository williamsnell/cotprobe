Question:

In theorising the Responsibility to Protect, fundamental questions are raised about the nature of state sovereignty. Regarding this tension between R2P and notions of sovereignty, which of the following is not an accurate statement?

Options:

A: In order to transcend the intervention-vs.-sovereignty debate, R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty.
B: In order to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention, the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty.
C: The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens.
D: According to R2P, sovereignty is only valid if the state can guarantee the safety and rights of its citizens.
E: In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and its relation to state sovereignty. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is not accurate regarding the tension between R2P and sovereignty. The options are A to E.

First, I need to recall what R2P is about. From what I remember, R2P is a concept that emerged in the early 2000s. It's about the responsibility of states to protect their own citizens from severe harm, like genocide, war crimes, etc. If a state fails to do so, the international community has a responsibility to intervene.

Now, the traditional Westphalian sovereignty is about the state having supreme authority within its territory and non-interference from other states. So R2P challenges that because it allows for intervention when a state isn't protecting its people.

Looking at the options:

Option A: R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty to move beyond the intervention vs sovereignty debate. I think that's correct because R2P does try to redefine sovereignty to include responsibilities, not just rights.

Option B: R2P redefines traditional Westphalian sovereignty to allow humanitarian intervention. Yes, that makes sense. R2P shifts the focus from state rights to responsibilities, thus altering the Westphalian model.

Option C: Sovereignty is linked with responsibilities to protect citizens. Definitely accurate. R2P's core idea is that sovereignty comes with the duty to protect.

Option D: Sovereignty is only valid if the state protects citizens' safety and rights. This aligns with R2P's stance. If a state can't protect, sovereignty isn't absolute, so intervention is justified.

Option E: To legitimize R2P interventions, Westphalian sovereignty is invoked, specifically for international security. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought R2P actually challenges the Westphalian idea of non-interference. So invoking Westphalian notions to justify intervention seems contradictory. Or maybe it's the oppositeâ€”R2P doesn't rely on the traditional Westphalian view but instead moves away from it.

Wait, let me think again. Westphalian sovereignty is about non-interference. R2P says that when a state fails, the international community can intervene. So it's not invoking the traditional Westphalian idea but rather redefining it. So Option E says that R2P invokes Westphalian notions to legitimize intervention for international security. That doesn't seem correct because R2P is about moving beyond that, not using it to justify.

So the incorrect statement would be E. Because R2P doesn't rely on the traditional Westphalian sovereignty; instead, it redefines it by emphasizing responsibility and allowing intervention when the state fails.
</think>

The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) challenges traditional notions of state sovereignty by emphasizing that sovereignty entails responsibilities, particularly the duty to protect citizens from severe harm. R2P redefines sovereignty to allow international intervention when a state fails to fulfill this responsibility. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, and D** accurately describe how R2P redefines sovereignty, focusing on responsibilities and justifying intervention when states fail to protect their citizens.
- **E** is incorrect because R2P does not invoke traditional Westphalian sovereignty, which emphasizes non-interference, to legitimize intervention. Instead, R2P moves beyond this framework by redefining sovereignty to include the responsibility to protect.

Thus, the inaccurate statement is **E**. 

Answer: E
