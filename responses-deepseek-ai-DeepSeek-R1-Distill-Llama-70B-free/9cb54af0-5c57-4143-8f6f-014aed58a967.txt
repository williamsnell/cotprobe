Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about efficiency. Hmm, I remember that efficiency has to do with how much useful work a device produces compared to the energy you put into it.

The problem says that when 100 J of energy are put into a device, it outputs 40 J of useful work. I need to find the efficiency. Right, efficiency is usually calculated as the ratio of useful output to the input, right? So the formula should be efficiency = (useful work done) / (energy input) multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Wait, let me make sure. So in this case, the useful work is 40 J, and the energy input is 100 J. So plugging those numbers in, the efficiency would be (40 / 100) * 100. Oh wait, that's 40%. So is the answer 40%?

Looking back at the options, option H is 40%. So the correct answer should be H.

But wait, maybe I should double-check. Efficiency can't be more than 100%, right? So if I got a number higher than that, I'd know something was wrong. But here, 40% is well within the 0-100% range, so that makes sense.

Another way to think about it: if the device used all the energy efficiently without any losses, the efficiency would be 100%. But since only 40 J out of 100 J are useful, it's definitely less than that. 40% is exactly 40/100, so that's correct.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The formula is straightforward, and the numbers plug in directly. So yeah, the answer is H.

The efficiency of a device is calculated as the ratio of useful work output to the energy input, expressed as a percentage. In this problem, the device outputs 40 J of useful work when 100 J of energy are input. Using the formula:

\[
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful Work}}{\text{Energy Input}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{40}{100} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
\]

Thus, the efficiency of the device is 40%, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
