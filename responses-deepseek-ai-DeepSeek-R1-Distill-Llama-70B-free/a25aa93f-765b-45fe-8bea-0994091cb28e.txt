Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about writing the balanced cell reaction and calculating the electromotive force (emf) of a cell at 298 K. The cell is Pt | Sn²+ (a=0.1000), Sn⁴+ (a=0.0100) || Fe³+ (a=0.200) | Fe. And there are some standard electrode potentials given in the literature, but they aren't listed here. Hmm, I think I remember some standard electrode potentials, or maybe I can deduce them.

Wait, I should probably jot down what I know. The cell notation is important here. The left side is the anode (oxidation), and the right is the cathode (reduction). The electrodes are Pt, which is inert, so the actual reactions are happening in the solutions.

So, the left side has Sn²+ and Sn⁴+. I think tin can exist in different oxidation states. Sn²+ can oxidize to Sn⁴+, right? Because Sn²+ is being oxidized, that's the anode. So the reaction at the anode would be Sn²+ losing electrons to become Sn⁴+.

The right side has Fe³+ and Fe metal. Fe³+ is a strong oxidizing agent. It probably gains electrons to become Fe²+? Or maybe Fe metal is getting oxidized? Wait, no, in the cell notation, the right side is the cathode, so it's reduction. So Fe³+ is being reduced. Oh wait, no. Wait, the Fe is on the right, so the reduction would be Fe³+ going to Fe²+? Or wait, maybe Fe metal is deposited from Fe²+? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the cell notation, the right side is the cathode, which is reduction. So the Fe³+ would accept electrons. What's the possible reaction? Fe³+ + e^- → Fe²+? Or maybe Fe³+ is getting reduced to Fe metal. Oh wait, Fe's standard electrode potential is about that.

Wait, no. Let me think. The standard reduction potentials I remember:

I think the Fe³+ + e^- → Fe²+ has a standard E of about 0.77 V. And Sn²+ can act in the reverse reaction. Let me think: the Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^-. What's the standard E for that? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, the standard electrode potentials are usually written as reductions.

So the standard potential for Sn⁴+ + 2e^- → Sn²+ is, I think, around 0.13 V. Let me make sure. Oh wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the standard E for Sn²+/Sn is lower. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible reactions.

Wait, the cell reaction will involve oxidation on the left and reduction on the right. So the anode (left) is Sn²+ being oxidized to Sn⁴+. So the reaction is Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^-. The cathode is Fe³+ being reduced. But to what? Let's see, Fe³+ can go to Fe²+ or to Fe(s). Which is more likely? Well, it depends on the potentials.

Wait, I think the Fe³+ is being reduced to Fe²+ because Fe³+ is a strong oxidizer. So the cathode reaction is Fe³+ + e^- → Fe²+. But wait, is that the correct way? Because each Fe³+ gains one electron to become Fe²+. So the reaction would be Fe³+ + e^- → Fe²+.

So now, to balance the electrons. The anode produces 2 electrons (from Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^-), and each Fe³+ only takes one electron. So to balance, I need two Fe³+ ions to accept the two electrons. So the cathode reaction would be 2 Fe³+ + 2 e^- → 2 Fe²+.

Putting it together, the overall reaction should be:

Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^-
2 Fe³+ + 2e^- → 2 Fe²+
---------------------------------------
Sn²+ + 2 Fe³+ → Sn⁴+ + 2 Fe²+

Wait, but that doesn't look right in terms of oxidation states. Let me check: Sn²+ goes to Sn⁴+ (oxidation, since it's losing electrons), and Fe³+ goes to Fe²+ (reduction, gaining electrons). Yes, that makes sense.

Now, to calculate the emf of the cell at 298 K, which is 25°C. The formula for the cell potential under non-standard conditions is the Nernst equation.

The Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q, where Q is the reaction quotient. But sometimes it's written as E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q at 25°C, since 0.0592 is approximately (RT/F) converted into log terms.

Wait, but when using the equation in terms of concentrations, the reaction quotient Q is products over reactants, each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients. So for the reaction:

Sn²+ + 2 Fe³+ → Sn⁴+ + 2 Fe²+

So Q would be [Sn⁴+][Fe²+]^2 / ([Sn²+][Fe³+]^2 )

But wait, in the cell, the activities are given. The anode has Sn²+ at 0.1 and Sn⁴+ at 0.01. The cathode has Fe³+ at 0.2, but what about Fe²+? Wait, the problem doesn't give the activity of Fe²+. Hmm, that's confusing. Because the reaction produces Fe²+ from Fe³+. So in the initial state, before the reaction, is Fe²+ present? The problem states that the anode is Sn²+ and Sn⁴+ with their activities, and the cathode is Fe³+ at 0.2. So perhaps the Fe²+ is initially zero? Or maybe the solution is that in the Nernst equation, when a species isn't present initially, its concentration is taken as 1 (if it's a product) or as in solution.

Wait, perhaps the Fe²+ is a product, so its concentration isn't given. Hmm, but the problem gives the initial activities. If the cell is operating, then some Fe²+ is being formed, but for the initial emf calculation, perhaps it's assumed that the concentrations are at the initial state. Wait, but in the problem, the only concentrations given are for the reactants. So in the reaction quotient, the [Fe²+] would be 1 (standard concentration) because it's a product, but in the problem, maybe it's not given, but wait, no, the problem gives the concentrations for all the ions present.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The cell is Pt | Sn²+ (a=0.1), Sn⁴+ (a=0.01) || Fe³+ (a=0.2) | Fe.

So the anode is where Sn²+ is oxidized to Sn⁴+. The cathode is Fe³+ being reduced to Fe²+.

In the reaction, the initial concentrations are [Sn²+] = 0.1, [Sn⁴+] = 0.01, [Fe³+] = 0.2. [Fe²+] is zero because the reaction hasn't proceeded yet. Wait, but that can't be, because at the start, I don't think Fe²+ is present. Hmm, but wait, in the problem statement, it's the initial activities given. So for the reaction quotient, [Fe²+] is 1 (if it's a standard solution), but no, the problem gives all the activities except for Fe²+.

Wait, maybe I should assume that the activity of Fe²+ is 1, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the cathode solution contains Fe³+ only, and Fe²+ is formed as the reaction proceeds. So the initial [Fe²+] is zero, but that would make the reaction quotient zero, which complicates things. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the reaction is under standard conditions except for the concentrations given. So the only concentrations not at standard are those given. But in this case, the Sn²+ is 0.1, Sn⁴+ is 0.01, and Fe³+ is 0.2. Fe²+ is at standard activity (1) because it's not given. So Q would be [Sn⁴+][Fe²+]^2 / ([Sn²+][Fe³+]^2 ) = (0.01)(1)^2 / (0.1)(0.2)^2 ) = 0.01 / (0.1 * 0.04) = 0.01 / 0.004 = 2.5.

Wait, but then that would be log(2.5). Let me compute that. log(2.5) is approximately 0.39794.

But wait, let's double-check the reaction quotient. The balanced equation is Sn²+ + 2 Fe³+ → Sn⁴+ + 2 Fe²+. So products are Sn⁴+ and Fe²+; reactants are Sn²+ and Fe³+.

So Q is [Sn⁴+][Fe²+]^2 / [Sn²+][Fe³+]^2.

Given that, and assuming [Fe²+] = 1 (since it's not given, perhaps it's standard), then Q = (0.01)*(1)^2 / (0.1 * (0.2)^2 ) = 0.01 / (0.1 * 0.04) = 0.01 / 0.004 = 2.5.

So log Q is log(2.5) ≈ 0.39794.

Now, the cell potential E is E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q.

Wait, but what's E°, the standard cell potential? To find E°, we need the standard potentials for the cathode and anode.

Wait, the anode is where oxidation happens. So the anode's standard potential is for Sn⁴+ + 2e^- → Sn²+, which is a reduction. But since it's being oxidized, we have to reverse it. The standard E for Sn⁴+/Sn²+ is E°(anode) = 0.13 V (I think that's correct but I'm not 100% sure). Wait, wait, I might be mixing up some values. Let me think again.

Wait, standard electrode potentials are usually given for reduction. So for Sn²+ being oxidized to Sn⁴+, the reaction is Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^-. The reverse of the reduction reaction. The standard reduction potential for Sn⁴+ + 2e^- → Sn²+ is, I believe, about 0.13 V. So when we reverse it for oxidation, the E° becomes -0.13 V.

The cathode is Fe³+ being reduced to Fe²+. The standard reduction potential for Fe³+ + e^- → Fe²+ is about 0.77 V. So the E°(cathode) is 0.77 V.

So the overall standard cell potential E°cell is E°(cathode) - E°(anode). Wait, no, the standard cell potential is E°cathode - E°anode (since E°anode is the reduction potential of the anode, which is actually undergoing oxidation, so we subtract it). So E°cell = 0.77 V - 0.13 V = 0.64 V.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me make it clear.

The anode is the site of oxidation. The standard potential for the anode's reaction (Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^-) is the reverse of the reduction reaction (Sn⁴+ + 2e^- → Sn²+), which has E° = 0.13 V. So the anode's standard potential as an oxidation is -0.13 V. But when calculating E°cell, we take E°cathode - E°anode (where E°anode is the reduction potential). So E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode = 0.77 V - 0.13 V = 0.64 V.

So E°cell is 0.64 V.

Now, we can compute the actual cell potential using the Nernst equation.

E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q.

n is the number of electrons transferred. In the balanced equation, the anode produces 2 electrons (from Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^-), and the cathode uses 2 electrons (2 Fe³+ + 2e^- → 2 Fe²+). So n=2.

So plugging in the values:

E = 0.64 V - (0.0592/2) * log(2.5)

Wait, wait, but earlier I thought Q was 2.5, which is greater than 1, so log Q is positive. Since the reaction is spontaneous when E is positive, but let's compute.

log(2.5) ≈ 0.39794.

So (0.0592 / 2) = 0.0296.

0.0296 * 0.39794 ≈ 0.01178 V.

So E = 0.64 V - 0.01178 V ≈ 0.6282 V.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the range of 0.01 to 0.25 V. So 0.628 is not among the options. That means I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, maybe I mixed up the anode and cathode? Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fe³+ is being reduced to Fe(s). Let me think again. The standard reduction potential for Fe³+ + 3e^- → Fe(s) is about -0.036 V, which is much lower than that of Sn²+ → Sn⁴+.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if Fe³+ is being reduced to Fe(s), its E° would be lower than the Sn's, which would mean the cell reaction would have E° negative, which doesn't make sense because the cell should be spontaneous as written.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong cathode reaction. Let's consider that maybe Fe³+ is being reduced to Fe²+, as I thought earlier. Then E°cathode is 0.77 V, and E°cell is 0.64 V.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the E I calculated is 0.628 V, which isn't in the options. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I got the cell reaction wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the anode is Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^-, which is correct, and the cathode is Fe³+ + 3e^- → Fe(s). But then, the E° for that reaction is lower. Let me look up (or try to remember) the standard E for Fe³+ + 3e^- → Fe(s). I think it's about -0.036 V.

Wait, so the E°cell would be E°cathode - E°anode. If the cathode is Fe³+ + 3e^- → Fe(s) with E° = -0.036 V, and the anode is Sn⁴+ + 2e^- → Sn²+ with E° = 0.13 V. So E°cell = (-0.036) - 0.13 = -0.166 V. But that would mean the cell isn't spontaneous, which contradicts the setup. Because in the given cell, the right side is the cathode, so it should be reduction. So if the E°cell is negative, that would mean the reaction isn't spontaneous as written, which can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the anode and cathode. Wait, in the cell notation, the left is the anode and the right is the cathode. So the anode is where oxidation happens, so Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^-. The cathode is where Fe³+ is reduced. So the cathode reaction must have a higher E° than the anode's E° to have a positive E°cell.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the Fe³+ reaction. Let me make sure. The standard E for Fe³+ + e^- → Fe²+ is 0.77 V, and for Sn²+ → Sn⁴+ + 2e^- is the reverse of Sn⁴+ + 2e^- → Sn²+ (E° = 0.13 V), so the E°cell is 0.77 - 0.13 = 0.64 V as before.

But wait, in the problem, the anode's solution has both Sn²+ and Sn⁴+, with activities 0.1 and 0.01, respectively. And the cathode has Fe³+ at 0.2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction quotient. Maybe I should be considering the concentrations as they are, without assuming [Fe²+] is 1. Because in the problem, Fe²+ isn't given, but it's a product. So perhaps the activity of Fe²+ is 1, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the Fe²+ is at a different concentration.

Wait, the problem gives the activities of Sn²+, Sn⁴+, and Fe³+ as 0.1, 0.01, and 0.2, respectively. It doesn't give the activity of Fe²+. So when calculating Q, [Fe²+] is taken as 1, as it's a product and not given. So in that case, the calculation I did earlier holds.

But that leads to E ≈ 0.628 V, which isn't among the options. The options are A:0.25, B:0.114, C:0.0158, D:0.1298.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong E° values. Let me double-check the standard electrode potentials. I might have them wrong.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the anode is the Sn⁴+/Sn²+ couple and the cathode is Fe³+/Fe²+.

Looking up standard electrode potentials (hypothetically in my mind), the
