Question:

A 12-year-old boy decided to play a practical joke. Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, the boy filled a bucket with ice-cold water and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, thinking that his father would take the guests' coats there to put them on the bed. The boy then went off to play at a friend's house. The boy's father decided to keep all the guests' coats in the hall closet instead of putting them in the guest bedroom. Later that evening, one of the guests mistakenly wandered into the guest bedroom while searching for a bathroom. As the guest opened the door, the bucket fell and hit his head, causing a severe cut that required a dozen stitches. If the guest sues the boy for negligence, the most likely result is

Options:

A: the boy loses, because this "practical joke" posed a risk of severe harm and, therefore, the boy had a duty to exercise as much care as a reasonable adult.
B: the boy wins, because a child's conduct cannot be negligent.
C: the boy loses, because he did not act with the amount of care that one would expect from a 12-year-old child.
D: the boy wins, because he could not foresee that a guest would mistakenly enter the guest bedroom.
E: the boy wins, because he did not expect anyone to enter the guest bedroom.
F: the boy loses, as he left the house without removing the trap, knowing his parents were having guests over.
G: the boy wins, because the guest should have been more careful in an unfamiliar house.
H: the boy wins, because the guest unreasonably assumed the risk of entering an unfamiliar room rather than asking for directions to the bathroom.
I: the boy loses, because he intentionally set a trap that could potentially cause harm.

Okay, so I've got this question about a kid who played a prank that went wrong, and now someone is suing for negligence. I need to figure out whether the boy would lose or win the case. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the facts: A 12-year-old boy set up a bucket of ice-cold water on a partially open door, planning for his dad to take guests' coats there. But his dad used a different closet, so the bucket stayed. Later, a guest looking for the bathroom opened the door, the bucket fell, and caused a severe cut needing stitches. The guest is suing the boy for negligence.

I remember that negligence has four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. So I need to see if the boy meets all these.

Duty: The boy, as a minor, has a duty to act as a reasonable person of his age, experience, and knowledge. So it's not about what a reasonable adult would do, but what a reasonable 12-year-old would do. 

Breach: Did he breach that duty? Setting up a bucket of water on a door could be seen as a prank, but the question is whether a reasonable kid his age would know that this could cause harm. I think a reasonable 12-year-old might realize that someone could get hurt if the bucket falls on them. So maybe he did breach the duty.

Causation: The action (placing the bucket) directly caused the injury. The guest opened the door, the bucket fell, he got hurt. So causation seems clear.

Damages: The guest had a severe cut, so damages are definitely there.

Now looking at the answer choices:

Option A says the boy loses because the prank posed a risk of severe harm, so he had a duty to act like a reasonable adult. Wait, no, because the duty for children is based on their own age's standard, not adults. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says the boy wins because a child can't be negligent. That's incorrect because children can be held negligent based on their own standard.

Option C says the boy loses because he didn't act with the care expected of a 12-year-old. This seems possible. A reasonable 12-year-old might know that leaving a heavy bucket on a door could cause someone harm, so maybe he didn't meet that standard.

Option D says the boy wins because he couldn't foresee a guest entering. But I think a reasonable kid would foresee that someone might open the door, especially since the dad was taking coats, even if he changed his mind. So D is probably wrong.

Option E says the boy wins because he didn't expect anyone to enter. But he set the trap expecting his dad to take coats there, so someone was expected to enter. E doesn't hold up.

Option F says the boy loses because he left without removing the trap, knowing guests were coming. That makes sense. He should have known that leaving it could cause harm, especially with people around. So F is a possibility.

Option G says the guest should have been more careful. But in negligence, it's about the defendant's actions, not the plaintiff's. So G isn't the right reason.

Option H says the guest assumed the risk by entering an unfamiliar room. But the guest was looking for the bathroom, which is a reasonable thing to do. So H doesn't seem right.

Option I says the boy loses because he intentionally set a trap. Wait, but this is a negligence case, not intentional tort. The boy didn't intend to hurt, just to prank. So I is probably incorrect.

So between C and F. The question is whether the boy's action breached the duty as a 12-year-old. If a reasonable 12-year-old would have known the risk, then C is correct. Alternatively, F points out that he left the trap knowing guests were coming, which could be part of the breach.

I think the key here is that the boy's action was a prank that a reasonable child should have known could cause harm. So C is about the standard of care for his age, which he breached. So the answer should be C.

The question revolves around whether a 12-year-old boy can be held negligent for setting up a prank that resulted in an injury. Negligence requires proving duty, breach, causation, and damages. The boy's duty is based on the standard of care expected of a reasonable 12-year-old. Setting up a bucket of water on a door could foreseeably cause harm, and a reasonable child of that age should understand the potential risks. The breach occurs if the boy failed to act with the care expected of a 12-year-old. Causation and damages are clear, as the bucket falling directly caused the injury.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because the duty for minors is based on their age, not an adult standard.
- **Option B** is wrong because children can be negligent under their own standard of care.
- **Option C** is plausible because it focuses on whether the boy met the standard of care expected of a 12-year-old, which he likely breached by setting up the prank.
- **Option D** is incorrect because a reasonable 12-year-old could foresee someone opening the door.
- **Option E** is invalid because the boy expected someone to enter the room.
- **Option F** highlights the boy leaving the trap, which could also indicate a breach, but the key issue is the standard of care for his age.
- **Option G** and **Option H** focus on the guest's actions, which are irrelevant to the boy's negligence.
- **Option I** is incorrect because this is a negligence case, not an intentional tort.

The most accurate answer is **Option C**, as it directly addresses the breach of duty based on the standard of care expected of a 12-year-old.

Answer: C
