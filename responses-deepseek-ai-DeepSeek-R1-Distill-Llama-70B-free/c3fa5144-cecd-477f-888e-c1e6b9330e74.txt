Okay, so I'm trying to answer this Supreme Court jurisdiction question. Hmm, I remember that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in certain cases, and Congress can give lower courts concurrent jurisdiction in most of them except for a few. Let me think through this.

So, the question is asking which area Congress hasn't given lower federal courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Supreme Court. The options are A through I.

From what I remember, the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction includes cases involving ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. Oh wait, that's option I. Also, cases where a state is a party, like when states sue each other. That's option G. And cases involving the United States government as a party, which could relate to federal officials, maybe option H?

Wait, but does Congress allow lower courts to handle some of these? I think in most cases, except for a couple, lower courts can also hear them. So the exceptions are cases where a state is a party or cases involving foreign ambassadors etc.

The question is about what's excluded from concurrent jurisdiction. So the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction in those exceptions.

Looking at the options, I think the correct answer is either G or I. Because I remember that when states are parties, the Supreme Court is the only one that can hear it originally. Similarly, for cases involving foreign diplomats, those are exclusive to the Supreme Court.

Wait, let me think again. The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction includes:

1. Cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls.
2. Cases in which a state is a party.

These are the two main areas. I believe that in these two areas, the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction. So lower federal courts don't have concurrent jurisdiction here.

So looking at the options, G says "a state as a party" and I says "public ministers and consuls." So the question is asking which cases Congress hasn't given lower courts concurrent jurisdiction. So both G and I are such cases, but the options are single choices.

Wait, looking back at the question, it says "except for disputes involving:" So the correct answer is one of the options that's exclusive to the Supreme Court.

So if I look at the options, option G is "a state as a party" and I is "public ministers and consuls." So in the options given, both G and I are exceptions. But the question is phrased as "all cases except for disputes involving:" So the answer should include both G and I, but the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me check my notes. Oh right, the Constitution gives the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in cases involving states and foreign diplomats. Congress can't give lower courts concurrent jurisdiction in these cases because the Constitution specifically vests it in the Supreme Court. So in all other cases, like federal laws or maritime issues, lower courts can have concurrent jurisdiction.

So the question is, which of the options is an exception where lower courts don't have concurrent jurisdiction. Let's look at the options again:

A: maritime issues - I think lower courts handle maritime cases, so concurrent jurisdiction exists.

B: private citizens - not an exception, lower courts handle that.

C: international disputes - Maybe, but I'm not sure. Wait, international disputes might involve treaties, which could be federal laws. Or maybe they fall under the public ministers category.

D: federal laws - Lower courts handle many federal issues, so concurrent jurisdiction exists.

E: different states - Oh, that's when a state is a party, which is option G. Wait, E says "different states," which might refer to diversity jurisdiction, but that's a different thing.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. So when two states are disputing each other, like a border dispute, the Supreme Court is the original court. Lower courts can't take that.

So the exception is when a state is a party. So that's option G.

Wait, but option I is about public ministers and consuls. So which one is the correct answer?

The question is phrased as "except for disputes involving" which of the options. The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction includes cases involving states and cases involving foreign ministers. So both G and I are exceptions. But looking at the options, the question is looking for one answer. So perhaps the answer is G and I, but since the options are separate, maybe the answer is I, or G.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that "public ministers and consuls" are part of the same original jurisdiction. Let me think again.

The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is outlined in Article III, Section 2. It says the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and cases where a state is a party.

So both G and I are exceptions where lower courts don't have concurrent jurisdiction.

Looking back at the options, the question is about which one is the exception. So the answer must be either G or I.

Wait, the question says "except for disputes involving:" So the correct answer is both G and I, but since the options are single, perhaps the correct answer is both. But the options don't have a combined choice.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I. Because when it's about public ministers and consuls, that's the only case where the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction. But wait, no, states as parties also are exclusive.

Wait, maybe the answer is G and I, but in the options, that's not possible. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because that's a more common example. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the correct answer is that the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction in cases where a state is a party (option G) and cases involving foreign diplomats (option I). But the options only have one correct answer, so perhaps the question expects one of these.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because that's more commonly tested. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think of the actual law. The Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is exclusive in cases where a state is a party and cases involving foreign ambassadors, etc. So both G and I are correct, but perhaps the question is looking for one answer.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the answer is G: a state as a party.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: public ministers and consuls.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. But the question says "except for disputes involving" which area. So the areas where lower courts don't have concurrent jurisdiction are G and I.

But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is I. Because maritime issues (A) are handled by lower courts. Option E is "different states," which might refer to state vs state, which is covered in G.

Wait, the options are:

G: a state as a party

E: different states.

So E is about when states are parties on both sides, perhaps. So the correct answer would be G.

Alternatively, no. Because E says "different states" which might refer to when two states are parties. So perhaps E is the correct answer, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court includes cases where a state is a party. So if a state is suing someone, the Supreme Court can hear it. Lower courts can't have concurrent jurisdiction in such cases.

So the exception is when a state is a party, which is option G.

Alternatively, perhaps option I is correct because that's another exclusive area.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to recall the specific exceptions.

From what I remember, the two exclusive cases are:

1. Cases where a state is a party.

2. Cases involving foreign ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls.

So both G and I are correct, but the options don't allow selecting both.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for option I. Because the other option, G, might be more about the states' disputes, which could be a subset.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, I think in the provided options, the correct answer is G: a state as a party.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of the actual text.

Article III, Section 2: "... the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party..."

So these are the two categories where the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, and Congress cannot give lower courts concurrent jurisdiction in these cases.

So the answer would involve these two. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is G, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is phrased as "disputes involving" which of the options. So perhaps "a state as a party" is the correct answer because that's one of the exclusive cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: public ministers and consuls.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of what the question is asking. It's asking which disputes do NOT have concurrent jurisdiction. So the answer is the ones that are exclusive to the Supreme Court.

So the answer would be G and I. But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is G or I.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G. Because I think that's the more commonly tested point.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, I'm going to have to make a choice. Based on what I remember, the correct answer is that the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction in cases where a state is a party. So the answer is G.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because I might be mixing up the exceptions.

Wait, another approach: think about what lower federal courts can't handle. They can't handle cases where a state is suing another state because the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction there. Similarly, they can't handle cases involving foreign ambassadors because that's also exclusive.

So the answer would be both G and I, but since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think of the options again. The options are:

A: maritime issues - concurrent.

B: private citizens - concurrent.

C: international disputes - perhaps concurrent, but maybe not.

D: federal laws - concurrent.

E: different states - maybe concurrent, but I'm not sure.

F: constitutional matters - concurrent.

G: a state as a party - exclusive.

H: federal officials - maybe concurrent.

I: public ministers and consuls - exclusive.

So the correct answers are G and I. But the question is asking for which one is the exception. Since the options are single choices, perhaps the answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G.

Wait, the question is phrased as "disputes involving" which of the following. So the answer is either G or I.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is G: a state as a party. Because when a state is a party, the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction. So the answer is G.

The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in specific areas, and Congress cannot give lower federal courts concurrent jurisdiction in these cases. The two primary exceptions are:

1. **Cases where a state is a party**: The Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction when a state is a party to the dispute, such as in state-to-state disputes.
2. **Cases involving public ministers and consuls**: The Supreme Court also has exclusive original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls.

The question asks for the specific area where lower federal courts lack concurrent jurisdiction. Among the options provided, **"a state as a party" (Option G)** is one of the exclusive areas where the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, and lower courts cannot share jurisdiction in such cases.

ANSWER: G
