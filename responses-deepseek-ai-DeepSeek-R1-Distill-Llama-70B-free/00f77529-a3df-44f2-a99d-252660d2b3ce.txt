Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the mass and weight of the air in a living room and then doing the same for an equal volume of water. The units for the weight are given in 10^5 N. Hmm, that's a big unit, so maybe the answers are scaled down?

First, I need to visualize the room. The floor is 4.0 meters by 5.0 meters, and the ceiling is 3.0 meters high. So the volume of the room would be length x width x height. Let me calculate that:

Volume = 4.0 m * 5.0 m * 3.0 m = 60 m³. Okay, that seems right.

Now, I need to find the mass and weight of the air. I remember that air has a density, which I think is around 1.2 kg/m³ at 20°C. Wait, is that right? I recall that at 20 degrees Celsius, the density of air at sea level is approximately 1.204 kg/m³. So I'll use 1.2 kg/m³ for simplicity.

Mass of air is density multiplied by volume. So:

Mass_air = density_air * Volume = 1.2 kg/m³ * 60 m³ = 72 kg. That makes sense. 

Weight is mass times gravity. Gravity is 9.8 m/s², so:

Weight_air = 72 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 705.6 N. Hmm, but the options are in units of 10^5 N. Wait, 705.6 N is way smaller than 1e5 N. Oh, wait, maybe I misunderstood the units. Oh wait, the problem says the unit is 1e5 N, so maybe the weight is 7.056e3 N? No, that's 7056 N. Wait, that's 7.056 x 10^3, which is 0.07056 x 1e5 N. But wait, that would make it 0.07, which isn't among the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. Volume is 60 m³, density 1.2 kg/m³ gives 72 kg. Weight is 72 * 9.8: let's compute that again. 70*9.8=686, 2*9.8=19.6, so total 705.6 N. Oh, wait, the options are in 1e5 N, so 705.6 N is 0.007056e5 N. But that's way lower than any of the options. Oh, wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Wait no, 1e5 is 100,000. So 705.6 is 0.007056 times 1e5. But the options start at 2.8 (option D) up to 10.1, so maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the weight in terms of 10^5 N, so maybe I have to convert the weight into multiples of 1e5 N. Let me think again. 705.6 N is how many times 1e5 N? 705.6 / 1e5 = 0.007056. That would be 0.007056 in units of 1e5 N. But none of the options are that low. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I got the units wrong. Oh wait, no, the problem says the unit is 1e5 N, so the answer is in multiples of 1e5 N. So 705.6 N is 0.007056e5 N, which is 0.007056 x 1e5 N. But the options are all above 2, so that can't be right. I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I confused mass and weight. Let me check the question again. The problem asks for the mass and weight of the air, and the same for an equal volume of water. Oh, but the multiple-choice options are only giving one number each. Wait, the options are labeled A-J, each with a number. But the question is asking for four values: mass of air, weight of air, mass of water, weight of water. But the multiple-choice only gives one answer. Hmmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, the problem says to select from A-J, but each option is a single value. So perhaps the question is only asking for one of these values, but which one?

Wait, the problem statement says: "Find the mass and weight of the air ... and the mass and weight of an equal volume of water." But the options don't provide multiple values, so maybe the question is only asking for one of these four quantities, perhaps the weight of the air? Or maybe it's the weight of the water? Hmm, but the question isn't entirely clear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the weight of the air in the unit of 1e5 N, but 705.6 N is 0.007056e5 N, which would be about 0.007, which isn't an option. So I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the volume. Let me check again: the room is 4.0 m by 5.0 m floor, and 3.0 m high. So 4*5 is 20, times 3 is 60 m³. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the density of air is different? Let me confirm. At 20°C, the density of dry air at sea level is approximately 1.204 kg/m³. So 1.2 kg/m³ is a good approximation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the weight again. 1.2 kg/m³ * 60 m³ = 72 kg. 72 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 705.6 N. So that's correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the weight in terms of 10^5 N, but expressed as a multiple. So 705.6 N is 0.007056 * 1e5 N, which is 0.007056. But none of the options match that. So maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the mass, which is 72 kg, but the options are in N units. Hmm, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to calculate the weight of the water as well, maybe that will clarify things. Let's see.

For water, the density is about 1000 kg/m³. So mass_water = 1000 kg/m³ * 60 m³ = 60,000 kg.

Weight_water = mass_water * g = 60,000 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 588,000 N. Now, the problem says the unit is 1e5 N, so 588,000 N is 5.88e5 N. So 5.88 in units of 1e5 N. Looking at the options, option F is 5.9, which is close. So perhaps that's the weight of the water.

Wait, so the question is asking for the mass and weight of the air and the same for water, but the multiple-choice options are each single numbers. So perhaps the question is only asking for the weight of the water, which would be 5.88e5 N, so 5.9 when rounded, which is option F.

But wait, let me check the calculations again. Mass of water is 60 m³ * 1000 kg/m³ = 60,000 kg. Weight is 60,000 * 9.8 = 588,000 N. 588,000 divided by 1e5 is 5.88, which is approximately 5.9, so option F.

So perhaps the correct answer is F:5.9.

But wait, what about the air's weight? That was 705.6 N, which is 0.007056e5, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is only about the water's weight, and the answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking about the weight of the air, but that doesn't match any options. So maybe I made a mistake in the air's density.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the weight of the air in kg, but no, the unit is N. Or perhaps the question is about mass in kg, but the options are in N.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the mass of the air in kg and then see if any of the options match. 72 kg. The options go from 2.8 to 10.1. 72 is way higher than any of these. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume. Wait, 4m x5mx3m is 60 m³, correct. So I think I'm correct there.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Wait, perhaps the problem wants the total weight of the air and water combined, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of the weights. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the weight of the air and the weight of the water, and the options are for each, but the way the question is phrased, it's not clear. But the multiple-choice options are single answers, so perhaps the question is only about one of them, likely the water's weight, which I calculated as ~5.88e5 N, so 5.9 in the unit of 1e5.

So I think the correct answer is F:5.9.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the volume of the living room using its dimensions:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 4.0 \, \text{m} \times 5.0 \, \text{m} \times 3.0 \, \text{m} = 60 \, \text{m}^3.
\]

### Mass and Weight of Air
The density of air at \(20^\circ \text{C}\) is approximately \(1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3\). The mass of the air is:

\[
\text{Mass}_{\text{air}} = \text{density}_{\text{air}} \times \text{Volume} = 1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 60 \, \text{m}^3 = 72 \, \text{kg}.
\]

The weight of the air is calculated using gravity (\(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\)):

\[
\text{Weight}_{\text{air}} = \text{Mass}_{\text{air}} \times g = 72 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 705.6 \, \text{N}.
\]

Since the problem specifies the unit as \(10^5 \, \text{N}\), we convert:

\[
\text{Weight}_{\text{air}} = \frac{705.6}{10^5} = 0.007056 \, \text{(in units of } 10^5 \, \text{N)}.
\]

This value is much smaller than any of the provided options, so the question is likely asking for a different quantity.

### Mass and Weight of Water
The density of water is approximately \(1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\). The mass of water in the same volume is:

\[
\text{Mass}_{\text{water}} = \text{density}_{\text{water}} \times \text{Volume} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 60 \, \text{m}^3 = 60,000 \, \text{kg}.
\]

The weight of the water is:

\[
\text{Weight}_{\text{water}} = \text{Mass}_{\text{water}} \times g = 60,000 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 588,000 \, \text{N}.
\]

Converting to the specified unit:

\[
\text{Weight}_{\text{water}} = \frac{588,000}{10^5} = 5.88 \, \text{(in units of } 10^5 \, \text{N)}.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place gives \(5.9\), which matches option \(F\).

### Conclusion
The problem is likely asking for the weight of the water in units of \(10^5 \, \text{N}\), and the correct answer is:

**F: 5.9**
