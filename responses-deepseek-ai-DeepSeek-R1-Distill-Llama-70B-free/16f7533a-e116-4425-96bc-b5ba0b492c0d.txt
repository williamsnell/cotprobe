Question:

A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?

Options:

A: Fibroma
B: Mucinous cystadenoma
C: Clear cell carcinoma
D: Teratoma
E: Brenner tumor
F: Serous cystadenoma
G: Endometrioid tumor
H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor
I: Ovarian carcinoid
J: Granulosa tumor

Okay, let me try to work through this question. So, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with increased facial hair for six months and her last menstrual period was four months ago. She has some physical signs like temporal balding, coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin, and clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone is high, but other hormones like androstenedione, DHEA, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are normal. Pelvic ultrasound shows a 12-cm ovarian mass.

Hmm, so the symptoms here point towards hyperandrogenism. The increased facial hair (hirsutism) and balding suggest high androgens. The clitoral enlargement is also a sign of excess androgens. Her menstrual irregularity could be due to anovulation, which can be caused by hormonal imbalances.

Now, looking at the lab work: serum testosterone is increased. But androstenedione, DHEA, and 17-ketosteroids are within normal ranges. That makes me think that the source of the excess testosterone isn't from the adrenal glands because DHEA is an adrenal androgen. If the adrenals were the issue, those levels might be elevated. So, it's more likely an ovarian source since the ovaries produce androgens like testosterone.

The pelvic ultrasound found a 12-cm ovarian mass. So, the question is about what kind of ovarian tumor could cause this presentation. Let's go through the options.

Option A: Fibroma. Ovarian fibromas are usually solid tumors. They are sex cord-stromal tumors. I think they can produce estrogen sometimes, but not sure about androgens. Maybe not the best fit here.

Option B: Mucinous cystadenoma. These are epithelial tumors, usually benign. They are large and can be cystic. But I don't think they produce hormones. So probably not the cause of high testosterone.

Option C: Clear cell carcinoma. This is a type of epithelial ovarian cancer. It's aggressive but I'm not sure it's linked to androgen production. Plus, clear cell tends to be associated with endometriosis sometimes, not sure about hormones.

Option D: Teratoma. Teratomas are germ cell tumors. They can produce various substances, but I don't recall them being a common cause of hyperandrogenism. More often, they might produce AFP or other markers.

Option E: Brenner tumor. These are also epithelial, usually solid. Some can be functional, like producing estrogen, but not sure about testosterone. Maybe less likely.

Option F: Serous cystadenoma. These are benign epithelial tumors, often large and cystic. Again, I don't think they're hormone-producing, so probably not causing the androgen symptoms.

Option G: Endometrioid tumor. These are epithelial ovarian cancers that resemble endometrial carcinoma. They might be linked to endometriosis. I don't think they produce androgens.

Option H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor. Oh, wait, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are sex cord-stromal tumors. They are known to produce androgens. That fits with the high testosterone here. These tumors can cause virilization, which includes hirsutism, balding, and clitoral enlargement.

Option I: Ovarian carcinoid. These are rare and usually produce serotonin or other neuroendocrine markers. They cause carcinoid syndrome, not hyperandrogenism. So not this.

Option J: Granulosa tumor. Granulosa cell tumors are sex cord-stromal as well. They typically produce estrogen, not androgens. So if the patient had high estrogen, but here the issue is high testosterone, so maybe not granulosa.

Wait, so granulosa produces estrogen, which is why they are linked to endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in some cases. But this patient has high testosterone, so that points more towards a tumor producing androgens.

So Sertoli-Leydig tumor (option H) fits. They are known to cause virilization because they secrete androgens. Also, these tumors can be large, as in this case a 12-cm mass. So that's probably the answer.

The patient is a 40-year-old woman presenting with symptoms of hyperandrogenism, including increased facial hair, temporal balding, clitoral enlargement, and irregular menstruation. Her serum testosterone is elevated, while other androgens like androstenedione, DHEA, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within normal ranges. This suggests an ovarian source of excess testosterone rather than adrenal pathology. Imaging reveals a 12-cm ovarian mass, and the clinical findings point to a hormone-producing ovarian tumor.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Fibroma** and **E: Brenner tumor** are unlikely, as they are not typically associated with androgen production.
- **B: Mucinous cystadenoma**, **C: Clear cell carcinoma**, **F: Serous cystadenoma**, and **G: Endometrioid tumor** are epithelial tumors, which are generally not hormone-producing and do not fit the clinical presentation of hyperandrogenism.
- **D: Teratoma** and **I: Ovarian carcinoid** are rare and not commonly associated with androgen production or the symptoms described.
- **J: Granulosa tumor** typically produces estrogen, not testosterone, making it an unlikely cause of this patient's symptoms.

The most likely diagnosis is **H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor**, a sex cord-stromal tumor known to produce androgens. These tumors are associated with virilization, including hirsutism, balding, and clitoral enlargement, and can present as large ovarian masses, consistent with the patient's findings.
