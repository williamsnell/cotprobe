To find the reciprocal of \( 0.\overline{7} \) and express it as a common fraction, let's start by determining the value of \( 0.\overline{7} \).

1. **Convert \( 0.\overline{7} \) to a fraction:**
   - Let \( x = 0.\overline{7} \).
   - Then, \( 10x = 7.\overline{7} \).
   - Subtracting the original equation from this, \( 10x - x = 7.\overline{7} - 0.\overline{7} \), which simplifies to \( 9x = 7 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{7}{9} \).

2. **Find the reciprocal:**
   - The reciprocal of \( \frac{7}{9} \) is \( \frac{9}{7} \).

3. **Match with the options:**
   - The fraction \( \frac{9}{7} \) corresponds to option A.

Thus, the reciprocal of \( 0.\overline{7} \) expressed as a common fraction is \( \frac{9}{7} \).
