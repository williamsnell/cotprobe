Okay, so I've got this question about the Minoan civilization and what they didn't show much evidence of compared to other early civilizations. Hmm, I remember that the Minoans were one of the earliest civilizations in the Mediterranean, right? They were on the island of Crete. I think they're known for their palaces, like Knossos, which had some really cool art and architecture. 

The question is asking which of the options (A to D) is something the Minoans didn't have much evidence of. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Trade. Wait, I recall that the Minoans were involved in trade. They were a maritime civilization, so they probably traded goods with other regions. I think their pottery and other artifacts have been found in places like Egypt and Mesopotamia, which suggests active trade networks. So maybe trade isn't the right answer.

Option B: Warfare. This is tricky. I know that the Minoans had some fortifications, but I'm not sure how much evidence there is of actual warfare. Wait, I think the Mycenaeans, who came after the Minoans on the Greek mainland, were more war-focused. The Minoans might have been more peaceful or at least left behind less evidence of organized warfare. So this could be the answer.

Option C: Development of a common religion. I'm not too certain about this. The Minoans had religious symbols, like the bull's head and the labrys (double axe). Their palaces had religious spaces, and there were frescoes depicting rituals. So it seems they did have a common religion. So maybe this isn't the right answer either.

Option D: Conspicuous consumption by elites. The palaces themselves are a form of conspicuous consumption. The elites would have lived in these grand structures, and the art found there suggests wealth and status. So this doesn't seem to be the correct answer.

Putting it all together: The Minoans traded a lot, had some religious practices, and their elites did show off their wealth. But they don't have as much evidence of warfare as other early civilizations. So the answer should be B: warfare.

The Minoan civilization, known for its palaces like Knossos and its maritime trade networks, shows little evidence of warfare compared to other early civilizations. While they engaged in trade (A), had religious practices (C), and exhibited wealth through their elites (D), their lack of significant fortifications or depictions of conflict suggests warfare was not a prominent feature. 

Answer: B
