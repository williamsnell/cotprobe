Okay, so I have this physics problem here about mixing ice and water, and I need to find the final temperature after the ice has melted. Hmm, I think I remember that when ice melts and mixes with water, heat transfer happens between them. Let me try to break this down.

So the problem says: there's a 100-gram piece of ice at 0°C, and it's added to 400 grams of water at 30°C. The calorimeter is perfectly insulated, so no heat is lost to the surroundings. I need to find the final temperature once all the ice has melted.

Wait, right. So the ice is at 0°C, so first it will absorb heat to melt into water at 0°C. Then, that water will warm up as heat is transferred from the warmer water. But wait, the warmer water is going to cool down as it gives off heat. So I think I need to calculate the heat absorbed by the ice and the heat released by the water, and set them equal since it's an isolated system.

Let me jot down some notes. The ice is initially at 0°C, so first it melts. The latent heat of fusion for water is about 334 J/g, I think. So the heat required to melt the ice is mass times latent heat. That would be 100 grams * 334 J/g. Let's calculate that: 100 * 334 = 33,400 Joules. So Q1 is 33,400 J.

Then, once the ice is melted, the resulting water (which is now 100 grams of water at 0°C) will absorb more heat to increase its temperature. The specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g°C, I remember. So the heat needed to raise this water's temperature from 0°C to the final temperature T is mass * specific heat * (T - 0). So that's 100 g * 4.184 J/g°C * T.

On the other side, the 400 grams of water at 30°C will lose heat. The heat it loses is mass * specific heat * (initial temp - final temp). So that's 400 g * 4.184 J/g°C * (30 - T).

Since the system is insulated, the heat lost by the warm water equals the heat gained by the ice and the melted water. So Q_ice_melt + Q_water_heat = Q_water_cool.

Wait, no, wait. The heat lost by the warm water (Q_water_cool) should equal the sum of the heat required to melt the ice (Q1) plus the heat needed to warm the melted ice (Q2). Because the ice first melts using Q1, then the melted water warms up using Q2. So:

Q_water_cool = Q1 + Q2

Which translates to:

400 * 4.184 * (30 - T) = 100 * 334 + 100 * 4.184 * T

Let me plug in the numbers. Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute Q1: 100 * 334 = 33,400 J.

Then, Q2 is 100 * 4.184 * T. Let me compute that coefficient: 100 *4.184 = 418.4. So Q2 = 418.4 T.

On the left side, 400 *4.184 = let's calculate that. 4.184 *400 = 1,673.6. So the left side is 1,673.6*(30 - T) = 1,673.6*30 -1,673.6 T.

Calculate 1,673.6 *30: 1,673.6 *30 is 50,208.

So left side becomes 50,208 -1,673.6 T.

Putting it all together:

50,208 -1,673.6 T = 33,400 + 418.4 T

Now, let's combine like terms. Bring all terms with T to one side and constants to the other.

So, 50,208 -33,400 = 1,673.6 T + 418.4 T

Compute 50,208 - 33,400: 50,208 minus 33,400. Let's see, 50,208 -33,000 is 17,208. Then minus 400 more is 16,808.

So 16,808 = (1,673.6 + 418.4) T.

Add the coefficients: 1,673.6 +418.4 = 2,092.

So 16,808 = 2,092 T.

Now, solve for T: T = 16,808 / 2,092.

Let me compute that. Let's see: 2,092 × 8 = 16,736. Because 2,000 ×8=16,000, 92×8=736. So 16,736. The numerator is 16,808, which is 72 more than 16,736. So 72 / 2,092 is about 0.0344. So T≈8.0344°C.

Wait, that would make the final temperature approximately 8 degrees Celsius. Looking at the options, F is 8°C. But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator. 1,673.6 + 418.4 = 2,092. Yes. So 16,808 / 2,092.

Alternatively, perhaps I can divide 16,808 by 2,092 step by step.

Let me approximate:

2,092 × 8 = 16,736.

16,808 -16,736 =72.

So 72/2,092 = approximately 0.0344.

So T≈8.0344°C, which is about 8°C. So the answer would be F:8 degrees.

Wait, but wait, I thought that sometimes when you mix ice and water, if all the ice melts, the final temp is above zero but not too high. Let me think about it. The mass of ice is 100g, and the water is 400g. So in terms of heat capacity, the 400g of water at 30°C has a lot of heat to give. But wait, does all the ice necessarily melt?

Alternatively, maybe not all the ice melts, but in the problem statement, it says 'when the ice has all been melted', so we can assume that yes, all ice is melted.

Wait, but wait another thing. In my calculation, I ended up with a temp above zero, which makes sense because the ice has melted. So the final temp should be above 0, which it is.

But let me think again: is 8°C a reasonable answer? Because the warm water is 30°C, which is a lot, but the ice is 100g and the water is 400g. So the melted ice will add 100g of cold water, making the total water 500g. So the initial temp is 30°C, and after adding 100g at 0°C, perhaps the temp drops but not too much.

Wait, but let's think about another approach. The heat lost by the warm water is used to melt the ice and then raise the temp of the melted ice. Alternatively, sometimes people set up the equation as:

Heat lost by warm water = heat to melt ice + heat to warm melted ice.

Yes, which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation somewhere.

Let me re-calculate the numbers.

Compute Q1: 100g * 334 J/g = 33,400 J.

Compute Q2: 100g * 4.184 J/g°C * (T-0) = 418.4 T.

Q_water = 400g *4.184 J/g°C * (30 - T) = 400*4.184*(30-T).

Compute 400*4.184: 400 *4=1600, 400 *0.184=73.6. So 1600+73.6=1673.6.

So 1673.6*(30-T) = 33,400 + 418.4 T.

Expanding left side: 1673.6*30 = 50,208. So 50,208 -1673.6 T = 33,400 +418.4 T.

Bring all T terms to one side:

50,208 -33,400 = 1673.6 T +418.4 T.

16,808 = 2092 T.

So T=16,808 / 2092.

Let me compute that division more accurately.

2092 × 8 = 16,736.

16,808 -16,736=72.

So 72 / 2092 = approximately 0.0344.

So T is approximately 8.0344°C, which is about 8.03°C. So 8 degrees Celsius.

Looking back at the options, option F is 8°C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Did I correctly account for the fact that after the ice melts, the temperature can't go above the initial 30°C, but in this case, it's much lower. Alternatively, sometimes in calorimetry problems, you have to check if all the ice can actually melt given the available heat.

Wait, right! Because sometimes, the warm water may not have enough heat to melt all the ice, in which case the final temperature would be 0°C. But in this problem, the question says that all the ice has melted, so we don't have to worry about that scenario.

So the calculation holds, and the final temp is 8°C, which is option F.
</think>

To determine the final temperature of the mixture, we analyze the heat transfer in the system. The ice at 0°C absorbs heat to melt, and the resulting water at 0°C then absorbs additional heat to raise its temperature. Simultaneously, the warm water at 30°C loses heat as it cools down. Since the system is perfectly insulated, the heat lost by the warm water equals the heat gained by the ice and the melted water.

### Step 1: Heat required to melt the ice
The latent heat of fusion for water is \( 334 \, \text{J/g} \). The heat required to melt 100 g of ice is:
\[
Q_1 = 100 \, \text{g} \times 334 \, \text{J/g} = 33,400 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Heat required to warm the melted ice
Once melted, the 100 g of water at 0°C absorbs heat to increase its temperature to the final temperature \( T \). The specific heat capacity of water is \( 4.184 \, \text{J/g°C} \). The heat required is:
\[
Q_2 = 100 \, \text{g} \times 4.184 \, \text{J/g°C} \times T = 418.4T \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Heat lost by the warm water
The 400 g of warm water at 30°C loses heat as it cools to the final temperature \( T \). The heat lost is:
\[
Q_{\text{water}} = 400 \, \text{g} \times 4.184 \, \text{J/g°C} \times (30 - T) = 1,673.6 \times (30 - T) \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Energy balance equation
Since the heat lost by the warm water equals the heat gained by the ice and the melted water:
\[
Q_{\text{water}} = Q_1 + Q_2.
\]
Substituting the expressions:
\[
1,673.6 \times (30 - T) = 33,400 + 418.4T.
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( T \)
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
50,208 - 1,673.6T = 33,400 + 418.4T.
\]
\[
50,208 - 33,400 = 1,673.6T + 418.4T.
\]
\[
16,808 = 2,092T.
\]
\[
T = \frac{16,808}{2,092} \approx 8.03 \, \text{°C}.
\]

### Final Answer
The final temperature of the mixture is approximately \( 8 \, \text{°C} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
