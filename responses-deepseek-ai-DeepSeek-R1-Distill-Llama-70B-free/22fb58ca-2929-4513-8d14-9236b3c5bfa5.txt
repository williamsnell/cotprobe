Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says something about spherical pollen particles being shaken up in water and allowed to stand. The depth of the water is 2 cm. We need to find the diameter of the largest particles that remain suspended after 1 hour. The density of the pollen is given as 1.8 g/cm³. The options are A through J, each with different diameters in centimeters.

Hmm, so I think this is a problem related to sedimentation, where particles settle under gravity. The ones that remain suspended are the smaller ones that haven't settled yet. So I probably need to calculate the maximum size of a particle that stays suspended after a certain time.

I remember something about Stoke's Law, which deals with the settling of particles in a fluid. Stoke's Law gives the frictional force on a sphere moving through a fluid. The equation is F = 6πηrv, where η is the viscosity of the fluid, r is the radius of the particle, and v is the terminal velocity.

But wait, I think there's another approach when considering the time it takes for particles to settle. Oh right, the settling time depends on the balance between the gravitational force and the frictional force.

So the particles will settle out if their terminal velocity allows them to reach the bottom of the container within the given time. In this case, the container's depth is 2 cm, and the time is 1 hour.

Wait, actually, the particles remain suspended if they don't settle to the bottom in that time. So the largest particles that stay suspended would be those that have a terminal velocity such that they would take exactly 1 hour to settle 2 cm. Because if they take longer than an hour, they haven't settled yet and are still suspended.

So the idea is to calculate the maximum diameter where the time to settle 2 cm is longer than or equal to 1 hour.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the terminal velocity v using Stoke's Law.
2. Determine the time t it takes for a particle to settle the given depth (2 cm) using the velocity.
3. Set t equal to 1 hour and solve for the particle's diameter.

Wait, no. Because the particles that settle in less time than 1 hour will have reached the bottom, so the ones remaining are those that take longer than 1 hour to settle 2 cm. Or wait, no, I think I got that backwards. No. The particles that take longer than an hour to settle would still be suspended because they haven't reached the bottom yet. So for the largest diameter that remains suspended, their settling time would be just over 1 hour. So perhaps, the time taken to settle 2 cm should be equal to 1 hour, so that if the particle's settling time is equal to that, it would just reach the bottom at that time. Therefore, any particle larger than that would settle faster and be out, and smaller ones would stay longer.

So, I think the approach is: the time taken to settle 2 cm is 1 hour. So the velocity is distance/time, which is 2 cm / 1 hr. Then, using Stoke's Law, we can find the diameter.

Wait, but wait, what's the formula again. Stoke's Law gives the terminal velocity v as (2/9) * (ρ - σ) * g * r² / η, where:
- ρ is the density of the particle,
- σ is the density of the fluid (water),
- g is acceleration due to gravity,
- r is the radius of the particle,
- η is the viscosity of the fluid.

So rearranging that, we can solve for r.

Let me jot down the variables:

- Density of pollen, ρ = 1.8 g/cm³ = 1800 kg/m³ (Wait, no, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 1.8 g/cm³ is 1800 kg/m³. But wait, when working in centimeters, maybe it's better to convert to cgs units to keep units consistent.)

Wait, in CGS units (centimeter-gram-second), let me make sure I get the units right.

Wait, in CGS units:
- Density ρ (pollen) = 1.8 g/cm³
- Density of water σ = 1 g/cm³
- Acceleration due to gravity g = 980 cm/s² (since 9.8 m/s² is 980 cm/s²)
- Viscosity of water η. Hmm, the viscosity of water at 20°C is about 0.01 poise. Wait, 1 poise is 1 g/(cm·s). So η = 0.01 g/(cm·s).

Wait, wait, I should double-check these constants. Let me think: water's viscosity is about 0.01 poise, which is 0.01 g/(cm·s). Yes.

So, the formula for terminal velocity v is:

v = (2/9) * ( (ρ - σ) * g * r² ) / η

Wait, but wait, because the particle is settling, the net force is (ρ - σ) * volume * g, where σ is the density of the fluid.

So the formula is correct.

Now, the time taken to settle a depth H is t = H / v.

We need to find the maximum r such that t = 1 hour. Because if t is exactly 1 hour, the particle would just reach the bottom in that time. So any larger particles would have settled already, and the ones smaller would still be suspended.

Wait, but the depth H is 2 cm. So the time to settle is t = H / v.

So set t = 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

Wait, but in CGS units, time would be in seconds. Let me confirm the units.

Wait, let's make sure all the units are consistent. Since we're using CGS units, let's keep everything in cm, g, and seconds.

So:

H = 2 cm
t = 3600 s (since 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds)
ρ = 1.8 g/cm³
σ = 1 g/cm³
g = 980 cm/s²
η = 0.01 g/(cm·s)
r is in cm, so diameter d = 2r.

So our equation is:

t = H / v

We can substitute v from Stoke's Law into this equation.

So,

t = H * 9 η / (2 (ρ - σ) g r² )

Wait, let's see:

v = (2 (ρ - σ) g r² ) / (9 η )

So 1/v = 9 η / (2 (ρ - σ) g r² )

So,

t = H * (9 η ) / (2 (ρ - σ) g r² )

We can solve for r²:

r² = (9 η H ) / (2 (ρ - σ) g t )

So,

r = sqrt( (9 η H ) / (2 (ρ - σ) g t ) )

So let's plug in the numbers.

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 9 * η * H
= 9 * 0.01 g/(cm·s) * 2 cm
= 9 * 0.01 * 2
= 0.18 g·cm/s

Denominator: 2 * (ρ - σ) * g * t
= 2 * (1.8 g/cm³ - 1 g/cm³) * 980 cm/s² * 3600 s
= 2 * 0.8 g/cm³ * 980 * 3600

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1.8 - 1 = 0.8 g/cm³.

So 2 * 0.8 = 1.6.

Then, 1.6 * 980 = let's compute that. 1.6 * 980 = (1 * 980) + (0.6 * 980) = 980 + 588 = 1568.

Then, 1568 * 3600 = let me compute that.

Wait, 1568 * 3600: 1568 * 36 * 100.

Compute 1568 * 36:

Let me do 1568 * 30 = 47,040
1568 * 6 = 9,408
So 47,040 + 9,408 = 56,448
Multiply by 100: 5,644,800

So denominator is 5,644,800 g/(cm²·s²) ?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units, but let's proceed with the calculation.

So the denominator is 5,644,800.

Wait, no, the denominator is 2*(ρ-σ)*g*t = 2*0.8*980*3600. Oh wait, but we have to calculate it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the entire equation numerically.

So let's compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 9 * η * H = 9 * 0.01 * 2 = 0.18

Denominator: 2*(1.8-1)*980*3600 = 2*(0.8)*980*3600

Let me compute 2*0.8 = 1.6

1.6 * 980 = 1.6 * 980 = let's compute:

1 * 980 = 980
0.6 * 980 = 588
Total: 980 + 588 = 1568

Now, 1568 * 3600 = 5,644,800

So denominator is 5,644,800.

So r² = 0.18 / 5,644,800 = let's compute that.

0.18 / 5,644,800 = 1.8e-1 / 5.6448e6 = (1.8 / 5.6448) * 1e-7

Compute 1.8 / 5.6448 ≈ 0.3188

So r² ≈ 0.3188e-7 = 3.188e-8 cm²

Then r = sqrt(3.188e-8) cm.

sqrt(3.188e-8) is sqrt(3.188)*1e-4

sqrt(3.188) ≈ 1.786, so 1.786e-4 cm

So radius r ≈ 1.786e-4 cm

Therefore, diameter d = 2r ≈ 3.572e-4 cm.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Did I do the division correctly?

Wait, 0.18 / 5,644,800 = let me compute 0.18 ÷ 5,644,800.

Well, 5,644,800 is 5.6448e6.

0.18 / 5.6448e6 = 0.18 / 5,644,800.

Let me compute 0.18 ÷ 5,644,800:

First, 5,644,800 = approximately 5.6448 x 10^6.

So 0.18 / 5.6448e6 = (0.18 / 5.6448) ) x 1e-6

0.18 ÷ 5.6448 ≈ 0.03189

So 0.03189e-6 = 3.189e-8.

So r² = 3.189e-8 cm².

Taking square root: r ≈ sqrt(3.189e-8) cm.

sqrt(3.189e-8) = sqrt(3.189) * 1e-4.

sqrt(3.189) is approximately 1.786. So r ≈ 1.786e-4 cm.

Therefore, diameter d = 2 * 1.786e-4 cm ≈ 3.57e-4 cm.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is 3.57 ×10^-4 cm, which is 3.57e-4 cm.

But wait, the options are:

I:3.57e-4 cm.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the exponents or in the unit conversions.

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

Stokes Law equation: v = (2/9) * (ρ - σ) * g * r² / η.

Wait, but perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me confirm.

Wait, the formula is correct: v = (2gr²(ρ-σ))/(9η).

Then, the settling time t is H/v, so t = H * 9η / (2g r² (ρ-σ)).

Wait, so solving for r²:

r² = (9 η H) / (2 g t (ρ - σ) )

Wait, I think I might have missed the t in the denominator in my earlier thought. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the initial step, I wrote:

r² = (9 η H ) / (2 (ρ - σ) g t )

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator:

Denominator is 2*(1.8-1)*980*3600.

Which is 2*(0.8)*980*3600.

So 2 * 0.8 = 1.6

1.6 * 980 = 1568

1568 * 3600: Let me compute 1568 * 3600.

Well, 1568 * 3600 = 1568 * 36 * 100.

1568 * 36: Let's compute this.

1568 * 30 = 47,040

1568 * 6 = 9,408

Adding them: 47,040 + 9,408 = 56,448

Multiply by 100: 5,644,800.

So denominator is 5,644,800.

Numerator is 9 * 0.01 * 2 = 0.18.

So 0.18 / 5,644,800 = 1.8e-1 / 5.6448e6 = approx 3.189e-8.

So r² = 3.189e-8 cm²

r = sqrt(3.189e-8) cm ≈ 1.786e-4 cm.

So diameter d = 2 * 1.786e-4 = 3.572e-4 cm.

Looking at the options, option I is 3.57 ×10^-4 cm, which matches.

Wait, but wait: option I is 3.57e-4 cm, which is 3.57 × 10^-4 cm. So that's the diameter.

But wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:4.00e-4 cm

B:1.57e-4

C:2.00e-4

D:7.57e-4

E:6.57e-4

F:5.57e-4

G:2.57e-4

H:4.57e-4

I:3.57e-4

J:3.00e-4

So option I is 3.57e-4 cm. That's what I got.

Wait, but wait, could I have made a mistake in the calculation of the square root?

Let me compute sqrt(3.189e-8) more accurately.

3.189e-8 is 3.189 x 10^-8.

The square root of 3.189 is approximately 1.786, as I had before.

So sqrt(3.189e-8) = 1.786e-4 cm.

Diameter is 3.57e-4 cm, which is 3.57 ×10^-4 cm. So the answer is option I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, people use the formula with different unit conversions. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, the formula for the maximum diameter is given by d = sqrt( (18 η H) / ( (ρ - σ) g t ) )

Wait, let me check this.

Wait, from the equation:

r² = (9 η H) / (2 (ρ - σ) g t )

So diameter d = 2r, so d² = 4 r² = 4 * (9 η H) / (2 (ρ - σ) g t )

Simplify:

d² = (36 η H) / (2 (ρ - σ) g t )

Which is d² = (18 η H) / ( (ρ - σ) g t )

So d = sqrt( (18 η H) / ( (ρ - σ) g t ) )

So perhaps I can compute it this way.

Plugging in the numbers:

η = 0.01 g/(cm·s)

H = 2 cm

ρ - σ = 0.8 g/cm³

g = 980 cm/s²

t = 3600 s.

So,

d² = (18 * 0.01 * 2) / (0.8 * 980 * 3600 )

Compute numerator: 18 * 0.01 * 2 = 0.36

Denominator: 0.8 * 980 * 3600

Compute denominator:

0.8 * 980 = 784

784 * 3600: Let me compute 784 * 36 = ?

700 *36 = 25,200

84 *36 = 3,024

Total: 25,200 + 3,024 = 28,224

So denominator is 28,224 * 100 = 2,822,400

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 0.8 *980 = 784 cm/s²? Wait, no. No, wait, 0.8 g/cm³ is the (ρ - σ) term.

Wait, no, the denominator is 0.8 * 980 * 3600.

Wait, 0.8 * 980 = 784.

784 * 3600 = 2,822,400.

So d² = 0.36 / 2,822,400.

Compute 0.36 / 2,822,400 = 3.6e-1 / 2.8224e6 = (3.6 / 2.8224) * 1e-7.

3.6 / 2.8224 ≈ 1.276.

So d² ≈ 1.276e-7 cm².

d = sqrt(1.276e-7) cm

sqrt(1.276e-7) = sqrt(1.276)
