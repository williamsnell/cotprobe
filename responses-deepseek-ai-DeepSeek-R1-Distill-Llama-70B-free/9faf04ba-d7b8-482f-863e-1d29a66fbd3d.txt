If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will

Options:

A: prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.
B: prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.
C: not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.
D: not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically strict liability. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a grocery store that bought a large mirror. The manufacturer provided brackets and bolts for hanging it. The store hired a carpenter to install the mirror. A few days later, the mirror fell because the brackets were defective, injuring a shopper. The shopper is suing the carpenter based on strict liability.

Hmm, strict liability... I remember that strict liability is usually applied in certain situations. One of them is when a person is in the business of selling a product. So manufacturers and sometimes retailers can be held strictly liable if a defective product causes injury. But what about someone like a carpenter who's just installing it?

The options are A through D. Let's look at each.

Option A says the shopper will prevail because the brackets were defective when installed. Wait, but the carpenter didn't make the brackets; he just installed them. I think strict liability usually applies to manufacturers or sellers, not installers, unless the installer was somehow negligent. But the question is about strict liability, not negligence. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option B suggests it's because it's abnormally dangerous to have such a large mirror. But I don't think that's the standard for strict liability. Abnormally dangerous activities are more about whether someone can be held strictly liable for certain ultrahazardous activities, like using explosives. Installing a mirror, even a large one, probably doesn't fall into that category. So B might not be the right reason.

Option C says the shopper won't prevail because the carpenter wasn't selling the mirror. That makes sense because strict liability typically applies to those in the business of selling the product. The carpenter is an installer, not a seller. So the carpenter wouldn't be strictly liable because he's not part of the chain of distribution in selling the product.

Option D mentions privity of contract. I recall that originally, privity was required for warranty claims, but strict liability doesn't require privity. So even if the carpenter didn't have a direct relationship with the shopper, that wouldn't matter. So D is probably incorrect.

Wait, but wait. The carpenter was hired by the store. The store is the one who bought the mirror. So the carpenter is an independent contractor, not a manufacturer or seller. So under strict liability, the claim would be against the manufacturer or the store, but not the installer unless he was negligent in installing it.

So the shopper is suing the carpenter for strict liability. But the carpenter didn't sell the product; he just installed it. So the correct reason the shopper wouldn't prevail is because the carpenter wasn't in the business of selling the mirror. That points to option C.

Another angle: strict liability requires that the defendant be a commercial supplier. The carpenter isn't selling the mirror; he's providing a service. So he wouldn't be strictly liable for the product's defects. Unless the carpenter modified the product in a way that caused the defect, but the question says the defect was in the brackets provided by the manufacturer. So the carpenter didn't cause the defect.

So yes, I think the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around whether a carpenter can be held strictly liable for injuries caused by a defective mirror that fell due to faulty brackets provided by the manufacturer. Strict liability typically applies to those in the business of selling products, such as manufacturers or retailers, not to installers unless they cause the defect through negligence or modification. The carpenter in this case was hired to install the mirror but did not sell it, nor did he contribute to the defect in the brackets. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because the carpenter did not create or sell the defective brackets; he merely installed them. 
- **Option B** is incorrect because installing a mirror does not qualify as an abnormally dangerous activity under tort law. 
- **Option C** is correct because strict liability does not apply to the carpenter, as he was not engaged in the sale of the mirror. 
- **Option D** is incorrect because strict liability does not require privity of contract, so the lack of a direct relationship between the carpenter and the shopper is irrelevant.

Thus, the shopper cannot prevail against the carpenter based on strict liability because the carpenter was not involved in the sale of the mirror.

C
