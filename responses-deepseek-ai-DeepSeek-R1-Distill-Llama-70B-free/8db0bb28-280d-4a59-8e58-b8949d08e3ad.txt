Okay, so I've got this question here about a code segment and which change wouldn't affect the result. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The code is structured with an IF-ELSE statement. Line 1 is the condition: if a equals 0. Then, in line 3, b is assigned a + 10. Else, in line 7, b is assigned a + 20 (wait, wait, line 7 in the code has '2O'—oh, that's probably a typo, right? So it's supposed to be 20, I guess. So line 7 is b ← a + 20.

So the original code does this: if a is 0, then b is a+10, which would be 10. Otherwise, b is a+20.

Now, the question is asking which change wouldn't affect the results. So I need to look at each option and see which one doesn't change the outcome.

Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Changing line 3 to b ← 10. So when a is 0, instead of 0+10=10, it's just 10. So same result. So for a=0, same value of b. But wait, what if a wasn't 0? No, because line 3 is only executed when a is 0. So for a=0, same result. Other cases, the else is executed, so line 7 remains a+20. So the outcome of b would be same as before for a=0, but for other a's, no change. So this change doesn't affect the results. But wait, maybe I should check if this is the correct option. But let me see other options.

Option B: Changing line 7 to a ← b + 10. Oh wait, original line 7 is b = a +20. If we change this to a = b +10, that's a different operation. But wait, in the else block, when a is not zero, what's the initial value of b? Because in this case, if a is not zero, the else block is executed. So in the original code, b is set to a+20. If we change it to a = b +10, then a's value would change, but what was b's initial value before this line? It might be undefined or have some previous value. So this could change a, but the question is about the result of the code. So if the result is about the value of b, then changing line 7 to assign a instead of b would change the outcome because b wouldn't be set in the else case. So this would affect the results. So option B would change the result.

Option C: Changing line 1 to IF (a > 0). So originally, the condition was a=0. Now, it's a>0. So when a is positive, the if block runs; else, else block. So for a=0, which originally would have run the if block, now it would run else. So for a=0, b would be 0+20=20 instead of 10. So the result changes. So this affects the outcome.

Option D: Changing line 1 to IF (a < 0). So if a is negative, the if block runs. Else, else. So again, for a=0, it would hit the else. So b would be 20 instead of 10. So again, the result changes. So this affects the outcome.

Option E: Changing line 1 to IF (a != 0). Hmm. Originally, the condition was a=0. So the else would run when a is not zero. Now, the condition is a !=0. So the if block runs when a is not zero, else when a is zero. Wait, that's the opposite of the original. So in the original, if a is zero: if block, else otherwise. Now, if a is not zero: if block, else when a is zero. So for a=5, original would have gone to else (b=25). Now, with this change, it would go to if block (b=5+10=15). So the result changes. So option E affects the outcome.

Option F: Changing line 3 to b ← a +20. So in the if block, when a is zero, b becomes 0+20=20. Originally, it was 10. So for a=0, b would be 20 instead of 10. So this changes the result. So option F affects the outcome.

Option G: Changing line 7 to b ← a +10. So in the else block, which runs when a is not zero, b is set to a+10 instead of a+20. So for any a not zero, b becomes a+10, which is different from before. So this changes the outcome. So option G affects the results.

Option H: Changing line 7 to b ←20. So regardless of a's value (as long as it's else), b becomes 20. So for example, if a is 5, before it was 25, now it's 20. So this changes the result. So option H affects the outcome.

Option I: Changing line 3 to a ← b +10. So in the if block (a=0), a is set to b+10. But wait, what is b's initial value? It's possible that b was undefined before. So the value of a would change, but the original code sets b. So if the result we're considering is the value of b, then changing line 3 to assign a instead of b would mean that in the if block, b isn't set. So the result for b could be undefined or previous value, which would change from the original where b was 10. So this affects the outcome. So option I changes the result.

Option J: Changing line 7 to a ←20. So in the else block, a is set to 20. Again, if the result is about b's value, then in the else case, b isn't set in this change, whereas before it was set to a+20. So for a not zero, b would have some previous value (or undefined), which is different. So this affects the result.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about which change will NOT affect the results. So looking for the option where the outcome remains the same.

Looking back, option A: Changing line 3 to b=10. So for a=0, b becomes 10, same as before. For other a's, the else runs, which sets b to a+20. So in no case does the result change. So option A's change doesn't affect the outcome.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think: in the original code, when a is zero, b is 10. Option A's change makes it so that for a=0, b is 10, same as before. So the output is the same. So yes, option A doesn't change the result.

Wait, but what about if a is something else? No, because in the else, line 7 is still a+20. So for a not zero, no change. So the overall result is same as before.

So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

To determine which change will NOT affect the results when the code segment is executed, we analyze the original code and each option:

### Original Code:
- **Line 1:** `IF (a = 0)`
- **Line 3:** `b ← a + 10` (if `a = 0`, `b` becomes `10`)
- **Line 7:** `b ← a + 20` (if `a ≠ 0`, `b` becomes `a + 20`)

The code assigns `b` a value based on whether `a` is zero or not.

---

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A:** Changing Line 3 to `b ← 10`  
   - For `a = 0`, `b` is set to `10`, which is the same result as the original code.  
   - For `a ≠ 0`, the else block still executes, setting `b ← a + 20`, which is unchanged.  
   - **Result:** No change in output.

2. **Option B:** Changing Line 7 to `a ← b + 10`  
   - This changes the operation in the else block from assigning `b` to modifying `a`.  
   - If the result depends on `b`, this would alter the outcome because `b` would no longer be assigned `a + 20`.  
   - **Result:** Affects the outcome.

3. **Option C:** Changing Line 1 to `IF (a > 0)`  
   - The condition now runs the if block for `a > 0`, and the else block for `a ≤ 0`.  
   - For `a = 0`, the else block executes, setting `b ← a + 20`, which changes the result from `10` to `20`.  
   - **Result:** Affects the outcome.

4. **Option D:** Changing Line 1 to `IF (a < 0)`  
   - The condition now runs the if block for `a < 0`, and the else block for `a ≥ 0`.  
   - For `a = 0`, the else block executes, setting `b ← a + 20`, which changes the result from `10` to `20`.  
   - **Result:** Affects the outcome.

5. **Option E:** Changing Line 1 to `IF (a != 0)`  
   - The condition now runs the if block for `a ≠ 0`, and the else block for `a = 0`.  
   - This is the opposite of the original logic, changing which block executes for different values of `a`.  
   - **Result:** Affects the outcome.

6. **Option F:** Changing Line 3 to `b ← a + 20`  
   - For `a = 0`, `b` becomes `20` instead of `10`, changing the result.  
   - **Result:** Affects the outcome.

7. **Option G:** Changing Line 7 to `b ← a + 10`  
   - For `a ≠ 0`, `b` becomes `a + 10` instead of `a + 20`, changing the result.  
   - **Result:** Affects the outcome.

8. **Option H:** Changing Line 7 to `b ← 20`  
   - For `a ≠ 0`, `b` becomes `20` regardless of `a`, changing the result.  
   - **Result:** Affects the outcome.

9. **Option I:** Changing Line 3 to `a ← b + 10`  
   - This modifies `a` instead of `b` in the if block. If the result depends on `b`, this would leave `b` undefined or with its previous value, changing the outcome.  
   - **Result:** Affects the outcome.

10. **Option J:** Changing Line 7 to `a ← 20`  
    - This modifies `a` instead of `b` in the else block. If the result depends on `b`, this would leave `b` undefined or with its previous value, changing the outcome.  
    - **Result:** Affects the outcome.

---

### Conclusion:
The only change that does NOT affect the results is **Option A**, as it produces the same output for all values of `a`.

**Answer:** A
