Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about legal responsibility for a patient's care during their time in the hospital. Hmm, I need to figure out who is ultimately responsible.

The options are A through J. Let's break it down. I remember that in a hospital setting, different professionals have different roles. The question is about legal responsibility, so it's probably about who is legally accountable.

Option A is the GP. Wait, the GP is the general practitioner, usually the patient's primary doctor outside the hospital. But once the patient is admitted, I think the GP isn't the one in charge. They might get updates, but responsibility shifts to the hospital team.

Option B is the named consultant. Consultants are senior doctors who specialize in specific areas. They oversee patient care, especially in their department. So when a patient is admitted under a consultant, that consultant would be responsible for their care plan. That makes sense because consultants have the authority and expertise.

Option C is the named nurse. Nurses are crucial in daily care, but I'm not sure if they have the overall legal responsibility. They follow the care plans set by doctors, so maybe not the primary legal responsibility.

Option D is the hospital pharmacist. Pharmacists handle medications, ensuring they're correct and safe. They're part of the care team but probably not the ones with overall legal responsibility for the patient's entire care.

Option E is the hospital's legal department. They handle legal issues but don't provide patient care, so they wouldn't be responsible for the care itself.

Option F is the ward manager. They manage the ward's operations, including staffing and resources, but again, not the direct legal responsibility for patient care decisions.

Option G is the head nurse of the hospital. Similar to the ward manager, they're in a managerial role. They might oversee nursing staff but not have the legal accountability for a patient's medical care.

Option H is the head of the hospital board. That's more of an administrative and governance role, not directly involved in patient care.

Option I is the patient's family doctor, which is the same as option A. Already considered that, and I don't think they're responsible once the patient is admitted.

Option J is the hospital CEO. The CEO manages the hospital but isn't involved in direct patient care. Their role is more about overall management and policy.

So, putting it all together, the named consultant (Option B) is the one who has legal responsibility. They are the ones who diagnose, create treatment plans, and oversee the patient's care during their stay. The other options are either support staff, managers, or not directly involved in the medical decisions.

The legal responsibility for a patient's care during hospital admission, stay, and discharge lies with the named consultant. This is because the consultant oversees the patient's treatment plan, makes medical decisions, and is accountable for the care provided. Other roles, such as nurses, pharmacists, and administrative staff, contribute to patient care but do not hold the primary legal responsibility.

Answer: B
