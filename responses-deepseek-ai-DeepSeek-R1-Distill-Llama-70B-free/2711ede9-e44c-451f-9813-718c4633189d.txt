Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Danbury Hat Company, and I need to figure out their profit when they make and sell a certain number of hats. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, I remember that profit is calculated by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue. So the basic formula is Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs. That makes sense because revenue is what they make from selling the hats, and costs include both fixed and variable expenses.

The problem states that the fixed costs are $10,500. Fixed costs are expenses that don't change regardless of how many hats they produce. So whether they make 1 hat or 1000 hats, they still have to pay $10,500. 

Now, the variable cost per hat is $1.50. Variable costs change depending on the number of units produced. So for each hat they make, they spend an additional $1.50. 

They sell each hat for $5, which is the selling price. So each hat sold brings in $5 in revenue. 

The question is asking how much profit they make when they create and sell 46,500 hats. So I need to calculate both the total revenue and the total costs for that number of hats.

Let me start with the total revenue. That's the number of hats sold multiplied by the selling price. So 46,500 hats times $5 per hat. Let me compute that: 46,500 * 5. Hmm, 46,500 times 5... 45,000 *5 is 225,000 and 1,500 *5 is 7,500. So adding those together gives 225,000 + 7,500 = 232,500. So total revenue is $232,500.

Next, I need to find the total costs, which include both fixed and variable costs. The fixed costs are straightforwardâ€”$10,500. The variable costs depend on the number of hats. So variable costs = number of hats * cost per hat. That's 46,500 * $1.50. Let me calculate that. 46,500 multiplied by 1.5. 

Hmm, 46,500 * 1 is 46,500, and 46,500 * 0.5 is 23,250. Adding those together gives 46,500 + 23,250 = 69,750. So the variable costs are $69,750.

Therefore, total costs are fixed plus variable, which is $10,500 + $69,750. Let me add those: 10,500 + 69,750. 10k plus 69k is 79k, and 500 + 750 is 1250. So 79,000 + 1,250 is 80,250. So total costs are $80,250.

Now, profit is total revenue minus total costs. So that's $232,500 - $80,250. Let me subtract that. 232,500 minus 80,000 is 152,500. Then subtract the remaining 250, which gives 152,250. So the profit is $152,250.

Looking at the options, option A is $152,250. So the answer should be A.

The Danbury Hat Company calculates profit as Total Revenue minus Total Costs. 

1. **Total Revenue**:  
   \( 46,500 \, \text{hats} \times \$5/\text{hat} = \$232,500 \).

2. **Total Costs**:  
   - Fixed Costs: \$10,500.  
   - Variable Costs: \( 46,500 \, \text{hats} \times \$1.50/\text{hat} = \$69,750 \).  
   - Total Costs: \( \$10,500 + \$69,750 = \$80,250 \).

3. **Profit**:  
   \( \$232,500 - \$80,250 = \$152,250 \).

The correct answer is **A: $152,250**.
