Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking which of the options relies on internal resources to cope with a problem. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that coping mechanisms can be categorized in different ways. I think there's something about problem-focused and emotion-focused coping. Oh right, I think problem-focused coping is about dealing with the problem itself, like taking action to solve it. So that probably uses external resources or maybe doesn't rely on internal ones as much.

Wait, but the question is about internal resources. So maybe emotion-focused coping is the one. Emotion-focused coping deals more with managing the emotional response rather than the problem. Like, if someone is stressed, they might use strategies to calm themselves down instead of trying to change the situation. That would mean relying on internal resources, such as their mental strategies or emotional management.

Let me look at the options again. Option A is Emotion-focused coping. Option C is Problem-focused coping. So that would make sense if A is the correct answer.

Wait, but I also remember something about appraisal-focused coping. Oh, that's another type where people change their perception of the problem. So that's more internal as well. But the question is about relying on internal resources to cope, so maybe both emotion-focused and appraisal-focused are internal. But the question is multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Looking back, the options are A: Emotion-focused, C: Problem-focused, H: Appraisal-focused. The question is which relies on internal resources. Both emotion and appraisal might fit, but I think emotion-focused is about handling emotions, which is internal. Appraisal-focused is about changing how you view the problem, which is also internal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, problem-focused is about taking action, so that's external. Emotion-focused is about dealing with your feelings, so that's internal. So the correct answer would be A: Emotion-focused coping.

I think that's right. So the answer is A.

The question asks which option relies on internal resources to cope with a problem. Emotion-focused coping (Option A) deals with managing emotional responses internally, such as calming oneself, rather than addressing the problem externally. This fits the description of relying on internal resources. 

Answer: A
