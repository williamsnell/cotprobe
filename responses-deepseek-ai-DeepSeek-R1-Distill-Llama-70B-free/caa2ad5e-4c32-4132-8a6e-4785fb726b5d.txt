Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about theories that support the belief that aggression is necessary. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology theories, but let's try to work through this.

The question is asking which pair of theories back up the idea that aggression is necessary. The options are A through G, each listing two theories.

First, I'll try to recall what each theory says about aggression.

Option A: "Aggressive Energy" and "Natural Born Killer." Aggressive Energy sounds familiar, maybe related to Freud? I think Freud had something about instincts, like the death drive, which could be a form of aggressive energy. But I'm not sure about "Natural Born Killer" theory. I don't remember that being a specific psychological theory; it sounds more like a movie title. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B: "Game" theory and "Cognitive Neoassociation." Game theory is more about strategic decision-making, I don't think it directly relates to aggression being necessary. Cognitive Neoassociation, I'm not too sure about. Maybe it's about how thoughts are connected, but not sure how that ties into aggression as necessary. So B might not be the answer.

Option C: "Psychoanalytic" and "Drive" theory. Psychoanalytic theory, yeah, that's Freud again. He talked about the id and the death instinct, which drive people to aggression. Drive theory could relate to the idea that people have internal drives, like aggression, that need to be expressed. So C seems plausible because both theories suggest aggression is a natural part of human behavior, maybe even necessary.

Option D: "Dominance" and "Behaviorist." Dominance theory would suggest that aggression is used to establish hierarchy, which is necessary in some contexts. Behaviorist theory focuses on learning through environment, so aggression is learned behavior. But does it support that aggression is necessary, or just that it's learned? I'm not sure if both support the necessity aspect. Maybe D is a possibility.

Option E: "Evolution" and "Conflict." Evolutionary theory often explains aggression as serving a purpose, like protecting resources or mates, which would make it necessary for survival. Conflict theory, I'm not as clear on. Maybe it's about competition leading to aggression? So E might be a good option because both theories can support aggression as necessary.

Option F: "Social Learning" and "Biological." Social Learning is about observing and imitating others, which explains how aggression is learned. Biological theories look at genetics and physiology. Both can explain aggression, but do they argue it's necessary? Maybe, but I'm not certain if they specifically support the necessity aspect.

Option G: "Survival of the fittest" and "Catharsis." Survival of the fittest is part of evolutionary theory, so that fits. Catharsis is about releasing pent-up emotions, like aggression, which can be seen as necessary to prevent worse behavior. So G also seems like a possible answer.

Now, I need to think about which theories explicitly support that aggression is necessary, not just that it exists or is learned.

Psychoanalytic theory (Option C) suggests that aggression is an instinctual drive, so it's necessary as part of human nature. Drive theory also posits that these drives are essential, so together they support the necessity of aggression.

Dominance theory (Option D) is about hierarchy, so aggression is necessary to establish dominance, which can be seen as necessary in some societies or animal kingdoms.

Evolution theory (Option E) definitely supports that aggression is necessary for survival and reproduction. Conflict theory might relate to competition, which can drive aggression as necessary for resource acquisition.

Survival of the fittest (Option G) aligns with evolution, so that's another point for E and G.

Wait, the question is about which theories support the belief that aggression is necessary. So which pair does that.

Looking back, I think Evolution theory (E) and Catharsis (G) are in different options. Option E pairs Evolution with Conflict, and G pairs Survival of the fittest (which is Evolution) with Catharsis.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. So, in Option G, "Survival of the fittest" is the same idea as Evolution theory. Catharsis theory suggests that expressing aggression (like through sports) is a way to release tension, implying it's necessary to do so for mental health.

So G's two theories both support that aggression has a necessary function.

Alternatively, Evolution theory (E) would support that aggression is necessary for survival, and Conflict theory... Conflict theory in sociology is about competition for resources, so maybe that also supports aggression as necessary.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact names of the theories. Let me think again.

Psychoanalytic theory (C) and Drive theory (C) both come from Freud, emphasizing internal drives, so they support that aggression is a necessary part of human nature.

Dominance theory (D) suggests that aggression is necessary to maintain social order or hierarchy.

So which options are correct.

The question is asking which theories support the belief that aggression is necessary.

So for each option, the two theories should both support that.

Looking back:

Option E: Evolution and Conflict. Evolution definitely supports that aggression is necessary for survival. Conflict theory, if that's a recognized theory in psychology, I'm not certain. Maybe it's related to Marx's conflict theory, but that's more sociology. So perhaps E is less likely.

Option G: Survival of the fittest (Evolution) and Catharsis. Catharsis theory suggests that aggression needs to be expressed, so that supports necessity.

Wait, the question is about which theories support that aggression is necessary. So Catharsis theory would argue that it's necessary to express aggression to prevent it from building up, which could be harmful. So G's two theories both support the necessity.

Alternatively, Evolution (E or G) and another theory.

Wait, the options are:

E: Evolution and Conflict.

G: Survival of fittest (same as Evolution) and Catharsis.

So if the question is which pair supports the necessity, G has two theories that do so.

Similarly, option C's two theories (psychoanalytic and drive) also support necessity.

Wait, the question is about which pair supports the belief that aggression is necessary. So I think both C and G are possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of the major theories.

- Psychoanalytic (Freud): aggression is an instinct, part of the id, so necessary.
- Drive theory: similar, as drives are basic motivations.
- Evolutionary: aggression aids survival and reproduction, so necessary.
- Catharsis: releasing aggression is necessary for health.

So the correct options would be either C or G.

Looking at the answer options, the options are:

C: Psychoanalytic and Drive.

G: Survival of fittest and Catharsis.

The question is which support the belief that aggression is necessary.

So both C and G have two theories that support that.

Wait, but the answer options are given as options A through J, but in the provided question, the options are A to G.

Wait, the options are:

A: Aggressive Energy and Natural Born Killer.

B: Game and Cognitive Neoassociation.

C: Psychoanalytic and Drive.

D: Dominance and Behaviorist.

E: Evolution and Conflict.

F: Social Learning and Biological.

G: Survival of the fittest and Catharsis.

So the answer could be either C, E, or G.

But the question is to pick the correct option from the given choices.

I think the correct answer is G: Survival of the fittest and Catharsis.

Because Survival of the fittest is an evolutionary concept that aggression is necessary for survival, and Catharsis theory suggests that expressing aggression is necessary to relieve stress.

Alternatively, option C has Psychoanalytic and Drive theory, both from Freud, suggesting that aggression is an inherent drive, so it's necessary.

Hmm. So which is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is about theories that support the belief that aggression is necessary.

So both C and G have two theories that support this.

But I think the most commonly recognized pair would be Evolution (Survival of the fittest) and Catharsis.

Alternatively, maybe another pair.

Wait, another approach: looking up the theories.

Psychoanalytic theory: yes, Freud believed in the death instinct, so aggression is necessary as part of human nature.

Drive theory: similar, as it's about biological drives, including aggression.

So option C would say both theories support that aggression is necessary.

Option G: Survival of the fittest is part of Evolutionary theory, which does support necessity. Catharsis theory, proposed by Freud as well, I think, suggests that aggression needs to be released, so it's necessary.

Wait, but catharsis is more about the expression of aggression as a way to reduce it, but it implies that it's necessary to express it, otherwise it builds up. So both theories in G support that aggression is necessary.

But I'm a bit confused about which option is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C: Psychoanalytic and Drive theory.

Wait, let me think about the answer options again.

The options are:

A: Aggressive Energy and Natural Born Killer.

Aggressive Energy could be Freud's death drive, which is part of Psychoanalytic theory. Natural Born Killer doesn't ring a bell as a theory name.

B: Game and Cognitive Neoassociation. Not related.

C: Psychoanalytic and Drive. Both Freudian, so yes.

D: Dominance (maybe from social hierarchy theories) and Behaviorist (learning). So Dominance might support necessity, but Behaviorist is more about learning, not necessity.

E: Evolution and Conflict. Evolution yes, Conflict maybe not as much.

F: Social Learning and Biological. Both explain causes, but do they support necessity?

G: Survival of fittest (Evolution) and Catharsis.

So the answer could be C or G.

Wait, I think the correct answer is C: Psychoanalytic and Drive theory.

Because both are directly about internal drives making aggression necessary.

Alternatively, G's theories also support that.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: which of these options is an actual pair of theories discussed in psychology.

Psychoanalytic and Drive theories are both from Freud, so they're a pair.

Survival of the fittest is from Evolutionary theory, and Catharsis is from Freud as well. So G's pair includes two different theory types.

But the question is about which option lists theories that support the necessity.

In that case, both C and G are possible.

Wait, but the options are:

C: Psychoanalytic and Drive.

G: Survival of the fittest and Catharsis.

Looking for the best fit, I think the answer is C: Psychoanalytic theory and Drive theory.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each theory actually says.

Drive theory, developed by Freud, suggests that behavior is motivated by drives, including the death drive (aggression). So Drive theory definitely supports that aggression is necessary because it's an innate drive.

Psychoanalytic theory, being Freud's overall approach, includes the idea of the id and the death instinct, so again, aggression is seen as a necessary part of human nature.

So option C's two theories both support that aggression is necessary.

In contrast, option G's Survival of the fittest is Evolutionary theory, which says aggression is necessary for survival. Catharsis theory suggests that expressing aggression is necessary to prevent it from leading to worse outcomes, so that also supports the necessity.

So both C and G have two theories that support the necessity.

But looking back at the answer options, which one is correct? Hmm.

Wait, the other options: E says Evolution and Conflict. Conflict theory, if it's referring to the sociological theory, might not be as directly related to psychological theories of aggression necessity.

So perhaps the correct answer is C or G.

I think the intended answer is G: Survival of the fittest and Catharsis.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: Evolution and Conflict.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should make a decision.

Since the question is about the necessity of aggression, the Evolutionary perspective (Survival of the fittest) definitely supports that. Catharsis theory also supports it by stating that aggression needs to be expressed.

So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but I'm now contradicting myself because earlier I thought C might be the answer.

Alternatively, let me check the options again.

The question is looking for theories that support a belief that aggression is necessary.

So, which theories argue that without aggression, something bad would happen, or that it's essential for survival or well-being.

- Evolutionary theory: aggression is necessary for survival and reproduction.

- Catharsis theory: aggression needs to be expressed to prevent internal conflict.

- Psychoanalytic theory: aggression is an instinct, so it's necessary.

- Drive theory: same as psychoanalytic, it's a drive that needs to be satisfied.

So both C and G have theories that fit.

But the options are:

C: Psychoanalytic and Drive.

G: Survival of the fittest and Catharsis.

So which pair is correct.

I think the intended answer is G: Survival of the fittest and Catharsis.

But I'm not 100% confident.

Wait, another approach: looking up the theories.

"Survival of the fittest" is part of Evolutionary theory, which does support aggression as necessary for survival.

Catharsis theory, proposed by Freud, suggests that repressing aggression leads to negative outcomes, so expressing it is necessary.

So G's pair supports the necessity.

Similarly, C's pair also does.

But the question is about which option is correct.

I think the correct answer is C: Psychoanalytic and Drive theory.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should go with the most well-known theories that directly address necessity.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: Evolution and Conflict.

But I'm not sure about Conflict theory in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: Evolution and Conflict.

But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another thought: the "Natural Born Killer" theory isn't a recognized psychological theory, so A is out.

Behaviorist theory (D) is about learning, so it doesn't necessarily argue that aggression is needed, just that it's learned.

So the best candidates are C, E, and G.

I think I'll go with option C: Psychoanalytic and Drive theory.

To determine which theories support the belief that aggression is necessary, we analyze the options provided:

1. **Option A**: "Aggressive Energy" and "Natural Born Killer" theory.  
   - "Aggressive Energy" could relate to Freud's death drive, but "Natural Born Killer" is not a recognized psychological theory.  
   - **Conclusion**: Not a strong match.

2. **Option B**: "Game" theory and "Cognitive Neoassociation" theory.  
   - "Game" theory pertains to strategic decision-making, and "Cognitive Neoassociation" focuses on thought connections, neither directly supporting the necessity of aggression.  
   - **Conclusion**: Not relevant.

3. **Option C**: "Psychoanalytic" theory and "Drive" theory.  
   - Psychoanalytic theory (Freud) includes the death instinct, positing aggression as an innate and necessary part of human nature.  
   - Drive theory also emphasizes internal drives, including aggression, as essential motivations.  
   - **Conclusion**: Both theories strongly support the necessity of aggression.

4. **Option D**: "Dominance" theory and "Behaviorist" theory.  
   - Dominance theory suggests aggression is necessary for establishing hierarchy, but Behaviorist theory focuses on learning through environment, not necessarily on the necessity of aggression.  
   - **Conclusion**: Partially relevant but not the best fit.

5. **Option E**: "Evolution" theory and "Conflict" theory.  
   - Evolutionary theory supports aggression as necessary for survival and reproduction.  
   - Conflict theory, if referring to sociological competition, may indirectly support aggression but is less directly tied to psychological necessity.  
   - **Conclusion**: Evolution theory is relevant, but Conflict theory is less clear.

6. **Option F**: "Social Learning" theory and "Biological" theory.  
   - Social Learning explains aggression as learned behavior, and Biological theory links aggression to genetics and physiology. Both explain aggression's origins but do not explicitly argue its necessity.  
   - **Conclusion**: Not the best fit.

7. **Option G**: "Survival of the fittest" theory and "Catharsis" theory.  
   - "Survival of the fittest" aligns with Evolutionary theory, supporting aggression as necessary for survival.  
   - Catharsis theory suggests that expressing aggression is necessary to prevent negative outcomes, further supporting its necessity.  
   - **Conclusion**: Both theories strongly support the necessity of aggression.

After evaluating all options, **Option C** (Psychoanalytic and Drive theory) and **Option G** (Survival of the fittest and Catharsis) both present theories that support the necessity of aggression. However, **Option C** is the most directly aligned with psychological theories explicitly emphasizing aggression as an inherent and necessary drive.

**Answer: C**
