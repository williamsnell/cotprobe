Okay, so I've got this question about the Vasicek model and zero-coupon bond prices. Hmm, I need to find r* given some prices. Let's think through what I remember about the Vasicek model.

Alright, the Vasicek model is a short-rate model, right? It's used to price interest rate instruments. The formula for the price of a zero-coupon bond in this model is P(r, t, T) = exp[-r*(T-t) + ... wait, no, I think it's a bit more involved than that. Oh right, the bond price formula incorporates the model's parameters, like the mean reversion rate, the volatility, and the risk premium.

Wait, the general formula for the Vasicek model is P(r, t, T) = exp[ A(t,T) - r*B(t,T) ], where A(t,T) and B(t,T) are functions determined by the model's parameters. Oh yeah, and those functions depend on the parameters a, b, σ, and maybe the market price of risk λ.

Wait, no, wait. I think the bond price formula in Vasicek is derived from solving the term structure model. The formula I recall is:

P(r, t, T) = exp( (B(t,T)(a + λ) - (σ² B(t,T)^2)/2 )/(a) ) * e^{-r B(t,T)}}

Wait, maybe I should break it down. Let me think about the zero-coupon bond price in Vasicek. The model is a Gaussian short-rate model, where the short rate follows a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. So the bond price depends on the current short rate r, and the time to maturity (T-t).

I think the formula is:

P(r, t, T) = exp[ -r * B(t,T) + A(t,T) ]

Where B(t,T) is (1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) / a, and A(t,T) is a term involving the model parameters.

Wait, more accurately, I think A(t,T) is given by:

A(t,T) = ( (a + λ) / a ) * ( B(t,T) * T - (T-t) ) ) + (σ²)/(4a) * ( B(t,T)^2 * (e^{-2a(T-t)} -1 ) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up some parts. Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as:

P(r, t, T) = exp( C(t,T) - r D(t,T) )

Where D(t,T) = (1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) / a,

and C(t,T) is:

C(t,T) = (D(t,T) - (T-t)) * (a + λ) / a  + (σ² D(t,T)^2 )/(4a)

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. Alternatively, maybe it's:

C(t,T) = ( (a + λ)(D(t,T) - (T-t)) )/a  + (σ² D(t,T)^2)/(4a) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. Since we have three bond prices given, perhaps I can set up equations and solve for the parameters a, σ, and λ, then use those to find r*.

Wait, but the question gives three points:

1. P(0.04, 0, 2) = 0.9445 → let's call this P1.

2. P(0.05, 1, 3) = 0.9321 → P2.

3. P(r*, 2, 4) = 0.8960 → P3.

But wait, the Vasicek model has parameters a, σ, λ. So typically, we need three equations to solve for three unknowns. So with three bond prices given, perhaps I can set up three equations and solve for a, σ, and λ, then use those to find r*.

So, let's structure each P(r, t, T) using the Vasicek formula.

The formula I think is correct is:

P(r, t, T) = exp[ A(t,T) - r * B(t,T) ]

Where:

B(t,T) = (1 - e^{-a (T-t)}) / a,

and

A(t,T) = [ (a + λ) * B(t,T) * T - (a + λ) * (T - t) ) ] * something... Wait, maybe I should refer back to the standard formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is:

P(r, t, T) = exp( ( (a + λ) ( B(t,T) (T - t) ) - (σ² B(t,T)^2 ) / 2 ) / a ) ) * e^{- r B(t,T) }

Wait, maybe I should look for the exact expression. Alternatively, another approach: in the Vasicek model, the bond price is given by:

P(r, t, T) = e^{ A(t,T) - r B(t,T) }

where:

B(t,T) = (1 - e^{-a(T-t)})/a,

and

A(t,T) = ( (a + λ) / a ) * ( B(t,T) - (T - t) ) ) + (σ² / (4a)) * ( (1 - e^{-2a(T-t)}) * (T-t) ) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the exact form of A(t,T). Maybe a better approach is to recall that in the Vasicek model, the bond price can be written as:

P(r, t, T) = e^{ - r B(t,T) + C(t,T) }

Where:

B(t,T) = (1 - e^{-a (T-t)}) / a,

and C(t,T) is:

C(t,T) = ( (a + λ) ( B(t,T) - (T - t) ) ) + (σ² / (4a)) ( B(t,T)^2 - 2 a (T-t) B(t,T) + 2 a (T-t) - (e^{2a(T-t)} -1)/a ) )

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. Since I'm stuck, perhaps I can consider that the zero-coupon bond prices can be related via the model's parameters.

Wait, the question gives three bond prices. Let me note them down:

P(r, t, T) = exp( A(t,T) - r B(t,T) )

So for each of the given bonds, I can write an equation:

1. 0.9445 = exp( A(0,2) - 0.04 * B(0,2) )

2. 0.9321 = exp( A(1,3) - 0.05 * B(1,3) )

3. 0.896 = exp( A(2,4) - r* * B(2,4) )

Let me compute B(t,T) for each case.

Compute B(t,T):

For the first bond, t=0, T=2:

B(0,2) = (1 - e^{-a*(2-0)}) / a = (1 - e^{-2a})/a

Similarly, for the second bond, t=1, T=3:

B(1,3) = (1 - e^{-a*(3-1)}) / a = (1 - e^{-2a})/a

Third bond, t=2, T=4:

B(2,4) = (1 - e^{-a*(4-2)}) / a = (1 - e^{-2a})/a

Wait, so all three B(t,T) are equal? Because each has T-t=2 years. So B(t,T) is same for all three because their maturities are 2 years. That's an important point.

So B(0,2) = B(1,3) = B(2,4) = B, where B = (1 - e^{-2a}) / a.

Now, for each bond:

Equation 1: ln(0.9445) = A(0,2) - 0.04 * B

Equation 2: ln(0.9321) = A(1,3) - 0.05 * B

Equation 3: ln(0.896) = A(2,4) - r* * B

Now, I need expressions for A(t,T). Let's think about what A(t,T) is. In the Vasicek model, A(t,T) is given by:

A(t,T) = ( (a + λ) ( B(t,T) - (T-t) ) ) + (σ² / (4a)) ( 2a(T-t) B(t,T) - B(t,T)^2 - 2(T-t) ) )

Wait, maybe a better way is to recall that A(t,T) can be written as:

A(t,T) = [ (a + λ) * (B(t,T) - (T-t)) ] / a  + (σ² B(t,T)^2) / (4a)

Wait, I might have that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps A(t,T) = ( (a + λ) ( B(t,T) - (T-t) ) ) / a + (σ² B(t,T)^2 )/(4a) )

Wait, yes, I think that's correct. So:

A(t,T) = [ (a + λ) ( B(t,T) - (T-t) ) + (σ² B(t,T)^2 ) / 4 ] / a

Wait, no, perhaps:

A(t,T) = [ (a + λ) ( B(t,T) - (T-t) ) ) + (σ² B(t,T)^2 )/(4a) ] / something? Hmm, I'm not confident about this part. Maybe I should think in terms of the general solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express A(t,T) as:

A(t,T) = [ (a + λ) * ( B(t,T) (T - t) - D(t,T) ) ] + (σ² / (4a)) * ( (B(t,T))^2 (T - t) + ... ) 

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Since all B(t,T) are the same, and the time to maturity is 2 years, perhaps I can write A(t,T) in terms of t.

Wait, another thought: in the Vasicek model, the term A(t,T) is independent of t except through (T-t). So for each of these bonds, since (T-t) is 2 years, A(t,T) would be the same for each. Wait, is that correct?

Wait no, A(t,T) depends on the time to maturity, which is (T-t), so for each bond, since they all have (T-t)=2, then A(t,T) is the same for all. So A(0,2) = A(1,3) = A(2,4) = A.

If that's the case, then all three equations have the same A and B. That would make the equations:

Equation 1: ln(0.9445) = A - 0.04 B

Equation 2: ln(0.9321) = A - 0.05 B

Equation 3: ln(0.896) = A - r* B

Wait, but if A and B are the same in all three, then I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

ln(0.9321) - ln(0.9445) = (A -0.05 B) - (A -0.04 B )

This simplifies to ln(0.9321/0.9445) = (-0.05 B + 0.04 B ) → ln(0.9321/0.9445) = -0.01 B

Let me compute that:

0.9321 / 0.9445 ≈ 0.9863 → ln(0.9863) ≈ -0.01375

So, -0.01375 = -0.01 B → B = 1.375

Since B = (1 - e^{-2a}) / a = 1.375

So, (1 - e^{-2a}) = a * 1.375 → 1 - e^{-2a} = 1.375 a

Hmm, this is a nonlinear equation in a. Let's solve for a.

Let me denote x = 2a. Then,

1 - e^{-x} = 1.375 * (x/2 )

Wait, because 1.375 a = 1.375 * (x/2 ), since x=2a → a = x/2.

So 1 - e^{-x} = (1.375 * x ) / 2 = 0.6875 x

So equation becomes: 1 - e^{-x} = 0.6875 x

We can solve this numerically for x.

Let me try some values:

At x=1: 1 - e^{-1} ≈ 0.6321 → 0.6321. 0.6875 *1=0.6875 → 0.6321 < 0.6875 → need x a bit larger.

x=1.2: 1 - e^{-1.2} ≈ 1 - 0.3012 ≈ 0.6988. 0.6875*1.2=0.825 → 0.6988 < 0.825 → not enough.

x=0.8: 1 - e^{-0.8}≈1 - 0.4493=0.5507. 0.6875*0.8=0.55 → 0.5507≈0.55 → very close.

Wait, x=0.8:

Left side: 1 - e^{-0.8} ≈ 0.5507.

Right side: 0.6875 * 0.8 = 0.55.

So 0.5507 ≈ 0.55 → x≈0.8 is the solution.

So x≈0.8 → a = x/2 = 0.4.

So a=0.4.

Wait, let me check x=0.8.

Compute 1 - e^{-0.8} = 1 - approx 0.4493 = 0.5507.

Right side: 0.6875 * 0.8 = 0.55.

Close enough. So a=0.4.

Now, with a=0.4, B=1.375.

Now, we can compute A from equation 1.

Equation 1: ln(0.9445) = A - 0.04 * 1.375.

Compute ln(0.9445) ≈ -0.0575.

0.04 * 1.375 = 0.055.

So:

-0.0575 = A - 0.055 → A ≈ -0.0575 + 0.055 = -0.0025.

Wait, that can't be right. A is supposed to be a function of the parameters, but getting such a small value? Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, equation 1: ln(0.9445) = A - 0.04 * B.

We have B=1.375, so 0.04 * 1.375 = 0.055.

ln(0.9445) is approximately:

0.9445 → ln(0.9445) = let's compute it accurately.

Using calculator: ln(0.9445) ≈ -0.0575 (I think that's correct).

So,

-0.0575 = A - 0.055 → A = -0.0575 + 0.055 = -0.0025.

Hmm, that's a very small A. But let's proceed.

Now, equation 3 is ln(0.896) = A - r* * B.

Compute ln(0.896) ≈ -0.1099.

So,

-0.1099 = (-0.0025) - r* * 1.375.

Rearranging:

-0.1099 + 0.0025 = - r* * 1.375 → -0.1074 = -1.375 r*

So,

r* = 0.1074 / 1.375 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.1074 / 1.375 = approximately 0.0781, so about 0.078 or 7.8%.

Looking at the options, E is 0.08, which is 8%. So r* would be approximately 0.08. So the answer is E.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check my calculations again because the result seems a bit off, and I might have made a mistake in the A calculation.

Wait, from equation 1:

A = ln(0.9445) + 0.04 * B.

Wait, no: equation 1 is ln(0.9445) = A - 0.04 B → A = ln(0.9445) + 0.04 B.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.

Equation 1: ln(0.9445) = A - 0.04 * B → A = ln(0.9445) + 0.04 * B.

So with ln(0.9445) ≈ -0.0575, and 0.04 * B = 0.04 *1.375=0.055.

So A = -0.0575 + 0.055 = -0.0025. That's correct.

Then equation 3:

ln(0.896) = A - r* * B → -0.1099 = (-0.0025) - r* * 1.375.

So,

-0.1099 + 0.0025 = - r* * 1.375 → -0.1074 = -1.375 r*.

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.1074 = 1.375 r*

r* = 0.1074 / 1.375 ≈ 0.0781 or 7.81%, which is approximately 0.08.

So the closest option is E: 0.08.

But wait, let me check equation 2 to make sure my a and B are correct.

Equation 2: ln(0.9321) = A - 0.05 * B.

We have A = -0.0025, B=1.375.

So RHS: -0.0025 - 0.05*1.375 = -0.0025 - 0.06875 = -0.07125.

Compute ln(0.9321
