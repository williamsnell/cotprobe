Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this psychology ethics question. Let me read it again.

The question is about a psychologist whose client is a 31-year-old man. The mother calls to check on her son's progress and express her concerns. She wants to know how she can help him. The psychologist has been seeing the son for six months. The question is, what should the psychologist do ethically?

The options are from A to J.

I remember that confidentiality is a big part of psychology ethics. The main ethical principle here is probably confidentiality. So, the psychologist can't just disclose information about the client without consent.

Looking at the options:

Option D says to tell her you can't discuss her son's condition. That makes sense because without the client's consent, the psychologist can't share details. But maybe there's a way to be supportive without breaking confidentiality.

Option A suggests advising her in general terms. That could be possible because giving general advice doesn't disclose specific information about the client. So the psychologist might say things like, "It's important to be supportive," without going into specifics.

Option B is about suggesting regular conversations about feelings. That's a bit more specific but still general advice. Similarly, option C is about providing emotional support, which is also a general suggestion.

Option E asks her to encourage the son to talk about therapy, which might not be appropriate because it's pushing the client to disclose more than he might want to. Plus, the mother's involvement could complicate the therapeutic relationship.

Option F is advising her to read more about the condition. That's helpful but might require knowing the specific condition, which the psychologist can't disclose. So maybe F isn't the best option.

Option G is disclosing detailed info, which is definitely against confidentiality, so G is out.

Option H suggests she get her own therapy. That could be a possibility if the mother is struggling, but the psychologist's primary duty is to the client, not the mother. So unless the mother's mental health is at risk, the psychologist might not suggest that.

Option I is to have her make an appointment to discuss in person. That might be appropriate if there's a need, but without the client's consent, it's tricky. Plus, the psychologist can't disclose info without consent.

Option J is suggesting she come to therapy with her son. That would require the son's consent, and the psychologist can't make that decision without talking to the son first.

So, putting this together: The psychologist can't disclose specific info, so D is a strong candidate. But could they offer general advice without violating confidentiality? Like A, B, or C.

Wait, the question is about the most ethical response. So, if the psychologist can't share details, they can still offer general advice. But I'm not sure if that's allowed or if the best response is to say you can't discuss it.

In many cases, the standard response is to say you can't disclose any information without the client's consent. So the psychologist would inform the mother that they can't discuss the son's condition. That would be option D.

But wait, some sources say that psychologists can provide general information without violating confidentiality. So maybe option A is acceptable. For example, the psychologist could say, "It's important for family members to be supportive," without giving any specifics about the client.

However, the question is about the most ethical response. The ethical guidelines typically prioritize confidentiality unless the client has given consent to share information with others. Since the mother is calling, the psychologist can't assume consent. So the safest and most ethical response is to inform her that they can't discuss the son's condition.

Therefore, the answer should be D.

The psychologist is faced with a situation where a client's mother calls to inquire about her son's progress and express her concerns. Ethical principles, particularly confidentiality, guide the psychologist's response. Confidentiality prohibits disclosing specific information about the client without their consent. While offering general advice (options A, B, or C) might seem helpful, the most ethical and safest response is to inform the mother that the psychologist cannot discuss the son's condition without his consent. This upholds confidentiality and adheres to ethical standards.

D: tell her that you cannot discuss her son’s condition with her.

Answer: D
