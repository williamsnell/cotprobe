Okay, so I've got this problem about a molten lead droplet cooling and solidifying, and I need to find the coefficient of heat transfer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, the problem gives me several parameters. The droplet's average is 1/8 inch in diameter, which is important for surface area calculations. The initial temperature is 750°F, and it falls from 60 feet. The surrounding air is at 70°F. The lead solidifies at 621°F. Also, the specific heat capacity (Cp) is 0.031 Btu/lbm-°F, the density (rho) is 710 lbm/ft³, and the heat of fusion (h_fusion) is 10.6 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the droplet falls from 60 ft. I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe that's just extra info or maybe it relates to something like terminal velocity or time in air? But I don't think that's needed for the heat transfer coefficient calculation. Probably, the main focus is on the heat transfer during cooling and solidification.

So, what do I know about cooling and solidification? Oh right, when a liquid solidifies, it releases latent heat. So the process has two parts: cooling the liquid from its initial temperature to the solidification point, and then the phase change.

I think I should model this using the energy balance. The heat lost by the droplet will be the sum of the heat lost during cooling to the solidification temperature and the heat released during solidification.

Wait, but wait again. The problem is about finding the heat transfer coefficient 'h'. How do I approach that?

I remember that for such transient cooling problems, especially when the temperature is changing, the lumped capacitance method might be applicable. But wait, the lumped capacitance method is usually when the temperature is uniform within the object, which is the case for small objects with high thermal conductivity. Lead has a high thermal conductivity, so maybe this applies.

But wait, the droplet is solidifying. So maybe it's better to think in terms of both sensible heat (cooling from 750°F to 621°F) and latent heat (changing phase at 621°F).

So the total heat lost should be the sum of the sensible heat and the latent heat.

The formula for the total heat transfer would be Q = m*(Cp*(T_initial - T_solidify) + h_fusion)

Once I have Q, I can relate it to the heat transfer equation, which is Q = h*A*(T_s - T_air)*time. Wait, but I don't know the time. Hmm, that's a problem. How do I find time?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of cooling time, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the problem is assuming steady-state conditions, but that doesn't seem right because it's a transient process.

Wait a second, maybe the problem is using the droplet's fall time as the time available for cooling. Because the droplet falls from 60 ft, so I can calculate the time it takes to fall that distance, assuming it's in air. Then, using that time as the time for cooling and solidification.

Oh! That makes sense. So the droplet falls, and during the time it's falling, it cools and solidifies. So the time of fall is the time available for heat transfer.

So to find the time of fall, I can use the equation for free fall. The height is 60 ft. Assuming it starts from rest, so initial velocity is zero.

The equation is h = (1/2) g t². So t = sqrt(2h/g).

But wait, in the English system, g is 32 ft/s². So t = sqrt(2*60 /32) = sqrt(120/32) = sqrt(3.75) ≈ 1.936 seconds. Approximately 1.936 s.

But is that right? Wait, 60 ft is the height. So yeah, that equation should work.

Wait, but if the droplet is falling through air, does air resistance play a role? Probably, but the problem doesn't give any information about drag or terminal velocity. So I think the assumption here is that the fall is under gravity only, no air resistance. So the time calculated is about 1.936 seconds.

Okay, so now I have the time, t ≈ 1.936 s.

Next, I need to calculate the total heat Q that is transferred during this time. Then, using Q = h*A*Delta_T_avg * t, I can solve for h.

Wait, but the temperature of the droplet changes during cooling, so the average temperature difference isn't straightforward. Oh wait, but if I'm using the lumped capacitance method, perhaps the temperature is uniform and the average can be considered as the initial temperature minus the surrounding temperature, but that's a simplification.

Wait, let me think again. The droplet starts at 750°F, and the surrounding is at 70°F. So the temperature difference is 680°F initially, but as the droplet cools, the difference decreases. So for the heat transfer, it's not a constant Delta T. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps in this problem, because the time is very short (about 2 seconds), the temperature doesn't drop too much, so maybe the average Delta T can be approximated as the initial Delta T, or perhaps an average between the initial and the final.

Wait, but in the lumped system analysis, the temperature as a function of time is T(t) = T_surr + (T_initial - T_surr) * exp(-h A/(m C_p) t). But integrating Q over time would require knowing the temperature history.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the droplet completely solidifies during this time, so the heat transfer is the sum of the sensible heat (cooling to 621°F) and the latent heat.

So let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the mass of the droplet. The diameter is 1/8 inch. Since it's a sphere, the volume is (4/3) π r³. The radius is diameter/2 = 1/16 inch. But I need to convert that into feet because the density is in lbm/ft³.

Wait, 1 inch is 1/12 ft. So 1/8 inch is (1/8)*(1/12) ft = 1/96 ft. So diameter is 1/96 ft, radius is 1/192 ft.

Volume V = (4/3) π (1/192)^3 ft³.

Compute that: (4/3) * π * (1/192)^3 = (4/3) * π * 1/(192^3) ≈ (4/3) * 3.1416 * 1/(7077888) ≈ (4.1888) / 7,077,888 ≈ approx 5.92e-7 ft³.

Then, mass m = density * volume = 710 lbm/ft³ * 5.92e-7 ft³ ≈ 710 * 5.92e-7 ≈ 4.2064e-4 lbm.

Wait, that seems small, but okay, it's a tiny droplet.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Let me compute (1/192)^3:

192^3 = 192 * 192 * 192.

192^2 is 36864, 36864 * 192 = let's compute 36864 * 200 = 7,372,800, minus 36864 * 8 = 294,912, so 7,372,800 - 294,912 = 7,077,888. So (1/192)^3 is 1/7,077,888.

So (4/3) * π * (1/192)^3 ≈ (4.18879) * (1/7,077,888) ≈ 5.92e-7 ft³. So yes, 5.92e-7 ft³.

Multiply by density 710 lbm/ft³: 710 * 5.92e-7 = 710 * 5.92e-7 = so 5.92e-7 is 0.000000592. 710 * 0.000000592 = 0.00041952 lbm. So m ≈ 0.00041952 lbm.

Okay, so that's the mass.

Now, the heat lost is the sum of the sensible heat and the latent heat.

Sensible heat Q_sensible = m * Cp * (T_initial - T_solidify).

T_initial is 750°F, T_solidify is 621°F, so the difference is 129°F.

So Q_sensible = 0.00041952 lbm * 0.031 Btu/lbm-°F * 129°F.

Calculate that: 0.00041952 * 0.031 = 1.3e-5, multiplied by 129: approx 0.001677 Btu.

Wait, more precisely: 0.00041952 * 0.031 = 0.00001300192. Then 0.00001300192 * 129 = 0.0016774 Btu.

Then latent heat Q_latent = m * h_fusion = 0.00041952 lbm * 10.6 Btu/lbm = 0.004445312 Btu.

So total Q = 0.0016774 + 0.0044453 ≈ 0.0061227 Btu.

So Q ≈ 0.0061227 Btu.

Now, the heat transfer equation is Q = h * A * (T_initial - T_surr) * t.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the time being the fall time, but the temperature difference might change. Ah, but in the lumped capacitance method, the heat transfer is modeled with the log mean temperature difference, but perhaps for a short time, the average temperature is approximately (T_initial + T_final)/2.

Wait, but in this case, the final temperature is T_solidify, which is 621°F, so the average Delta T would be (750 - 70) and (621 -70). So the average could be, say, (750 +621 -70 -70)/2 = (1371 - 140)/2 = 1231/2 = 615.5°F. Wait, no, that's not the way. The average temperature difference would be (T_initial - T_surr + T_final - T_surr)/2 = [(750-70)+(621-70)]/2 = (680 + 551)/2 = 1231/2 = 615.5°F.

But wait, the time is so short, so the temperature doesn't drop much. Wait, no, because the droplet solidifies, so the final temperature is 621°F. So it's cooled from 750 to 621, so the average Delta T would be [(750-70) + (621-70)] / 2 = (680 + 551)/2 = 615.5°F.

So average Delta T is 615.5°F.

Wait, but using the average temperature difference is an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: the heat transfer Q can be written as the integral of h A (T(t) - T_surr) dt from 0 to t_fall.

But without knowing T(t), that's tricky. So perhaps the lumped capacitance method would give us T(t), and we can calculate the average heat transfer.

Wait, in the lumped capacitance method, the temperature as a function of time is:

(T(t) - T_surr) = (T_initial - T_surr) * exp(-h A / (m Cp) * t)

But I don't know h, which is what I'm trying to find. So maybe I can relate the heat transfer to the temperature change.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat lost Q is equal to m Cp (T_initial - T_final) + m h_fusion.

Which is what I did earlier, getting Q = 0.0061227 Btu.

Now, the heat transfer equation is Q = h A ΔT_avg t.

So solving for h:

h = Q / (A ΔT_avg t)

But I need to compute A, the surface area.

The droplet is a sphere, so surface area A = 4 π r².

Radius is 1/192 ft, so A = 4 * π * (1/192)^2.

Compute that:

(1/192)^2 = 1/36864.

So A = 4 * π / 36864 ≈ 12.566 / 36864 ≈ 3.406e-4 ft².

So A ≈ 3.406e-4 ft².

Now, let's plug in the numbers:

Q = 0.0061227 Btu.

A = 3.406e-4 ft².

ΔT_avg = 615.5°F.

t = 1.936 s.

So h = 0.0061227 / (3.406e-4 * 615.5 * 1.936)

Let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, 3.406e-4 * 615.5 = ?

3.406e-4 is 0.0003406.

0.0003406 * 615.5 ≈ 0.2096.

Then 0.2096 * 1.936 ≈ approx 0.4059.

So denominator ≈ 0.4059 Btu/(ft²·°F·s).

Wait, because the units: Btu = h * (ft²) * (°F) * (s) → h has units Btu/(ft²·°F·s) → which is equivalent to Btu/(hr-ft²-°F) when converted from seconds to hours.

Wait, so the denominator is (A * ΔT_avg * t) = (ft²) * °F * s → so Q (in Btu) divided by that gives h in Btu/(ft²·°F·s). To convert to Btu/(hr-ft²-°F), multiply by 3600 s/hr.

So let me compute the denominator correctly.

But wait, let me compute the denominator: 3.406e-4 ft² * 615.5 °F * 1.936 s.

So 3.406e-4 *615.5 = 3.406e-4 *615.5 ≈ 3.406 * 615.5 * 1e-4.

Compute 3.406 *615.5 → 3 *615.5 = 1846.5, 0.406*615.5≈250 → total ≈2096.5. So 2096.5e-4 = 0.20965.

Multiply by 1.936 s: 0.20965 * 1.936 ≈ 0.4062.

So denominator ≈ 0.4062 ft²·°F·s.

So h = 0.0061227 Btu / 0.4062 (ft²·°F·s) → 0.0061227 / 0.4062 ≈ 0.01507 Btu/(ft²·°F·s).

Convert that to per hour: multiply by 3600 s/hr → 0.01507 * 3600 ≈ 54.25 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 52.8, option B is 45.7, option A is 59.2, and D is 63.4. So 54.25 is not exactly matching, but closest to C) 52.8.

Wait, but perhaps I made some approximations in calculations. Let me double-check the calculations more precisely.

First, compute the droplet's volume and mass.

Diameter is 1/8 inch = 1/8 * 0.08333 ft = 0.0104167 ft? Wait, no. Wait, 1 inch is 0.0833333 ft. So 1/8 inch is (1/8)*0.0833333 = 0.01041667 ft.

Wait wait, no! Wait, 1 inch is 1/12 ft, which is approximately 0.0833333 ft. So 1/8 inch is (1/8)*(1/12) ft = 1/(96) ft ≈ 0.0104166667 ft.

So diameter is 0.0104166667 ft, radius 0.0052083333 ft.

Volume V = (4/3) π r³ = (4/3) * π * (0.0052083333)^3.

Compute (0.0052083333)^3 = (5.2083333e-3)^3 ≈ 140.7e-9 = 1.407e-7 ft³.

Multiply by (4/3)π: (4/3)*3.1416 ≈ 4.1888. So 4.1888 * 1.407e-7 ≈ 5.9e-7 ft³.

So V ≈ 5.9e-7 ft³.

Mass m = rho * V = 710 lbm/ft³ * 5.9e-7 ft³ = 710 * 5.9e-7 = 4.189e-4 lbm.

Now, Q_sensible = m * Cp * (T_initial - T_solidify).

= 4.189e-4 lbm * 0.031 Btu/lbm-°F * (750-621)°F.

= 4.189e-4 * 0.031 * 129.

Compute 4.189e-4 * 0.031 = 1.300e-5.

1.300e-5 * 129 = 1.677e-3 Btu.

Q_latent = m * h_fusion = 4.189e-4 lbm * 10.6 Btu/lbm = 4.189e-4 *10.6 = 4.44e-3 Btu.

Total Q = 0.001677 + 0.00444 ≈ 0.006117 Btu.

Now, surface area A = 4 π r².

r = 0.0052083333 ft.

r² = (0.0052083333)^2 = 2.713e-5 ft².

A = 4 * π * 2.713e-5 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 2.713e-5 ≈ 3.406e-4 ft².

Time t is 1.936 s.

Average ΔT = (750-70 + 621-70)/2 = (680 + 551)/2 = 615.5°F.

Now, Q = h * A * ΔT_avg * t → h = Q /
