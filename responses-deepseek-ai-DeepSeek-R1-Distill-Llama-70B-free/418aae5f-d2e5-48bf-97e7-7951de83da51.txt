Okay, so I've got this question about an automobile insurance policy. Let me read it again and try to figure it out. The policy was purchased on March 10 with a $155 premium, and then it was canceled on September 6 by the owner. The question is asking how much the refund was.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of insurance refund policies, but I think it has to do with the time the policy was active. So the policy was bought in March and canceled in September. I guess I need to calculate how much of the policy period had passed and determine the refund based on that.

Wait, but how exactly do insurance companies calculate refunds? I remember hearing that sometimes they might prorate the premium based on the time used. So if the policy is for a certain term, like a year, and you cancel partway through, you get a portion of the premium back.

Let me think about the dates. March 10 to September 6. March has 31 days, so from March 10 to March 31 is 21 days (since 31 minus 10 is 21, but I think you include the 10th, so maybe 22 days? Wait, no, because the policy starts on the 10th. So from March 10 to March 31 is 22 days. Then April has 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, and then September 6 is 6 days. Let me add those up.

March: 22 days (from the 10th to the 31st)
April: 30
May: 31
June: 30
July: 31
August: 31
September: 6 days

Adding these together: 22 + 30 = 52, +31=83, +30=113, +31=144, +31=175, +6=181 days total.

Wait, but wait. If the policy was canceled on September 6, does that mean up to but not including that day? Or including? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should recount.

From March 10 to March 31: 22 days (since 31-10+1=22)
April: 30
May:31
June:30
July:31
August:31
September: 6 days (from 1st to 6th, which is 6 days)
So 22+30=52, +31=83, +30=113, +31=144, +31=175, +6=181 days.

So 181 days have passed since the policy started.

Now, the total policy term. Wait, the question doesn't specify the term. Oh, wait, the purchase was on March 10, but when does the policy end? Typically, insurance policies are for a year, so probably March 10 to March 10 of the next year. But if it's canceled on September 6, then the period from March 10 to September 6 is 181 days.

So the total policy period would be 365 days (assuming it's a non-leap year). So the fraction of the year that has passed is 181/365.

So the premium is $155. If the refund is based on the unused portion, then the refund would be 155 multiplied by (1 - (181/365)).

Wait, no, because the company might keep a portion for the time the policy was active. So the refund would be the premium minus the amount used.

So the used portion is (181/365)*155, and the refund is 155 minus that.

Alternatively, some companies might calculate it as a short-rate, which isn't exactly pro-rata. But I think for this question, it's a simple pro-rata calculation.

So let's compute 181/365 first. Let me do that division. 181 ÷ 365. Let me approximate that.

365 goes into 181 zero times. 365 × 0.5 is 182.5. Oh wait, 0.5 times 365 is 182.5, which is just a bit more than 181. So 181/365 is approximately 0.496, so about 0.495 or 49.5%.

So the used portion is roughly 49.5% of 155. Let me calculate 0.495 * 155.

Breaking it down: 0.4 * 155 = 62, 0.09 *155=13.95, 0.005*155=0.775. Adding those together: 62 +13.95 =75.95 +0.775=76.725. So approximately $76.73 used, so the refund would be 155 -76.73=78.27.

Looking at the options, J is $77. That's close. But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 181 days over 365. Let me compute 181/365 exactly.

365 × 0.5 is 182.5. 181 is 1.5 less than 182.5. So 0.5 - (1.5/365). 1.5/365 is approximately 0.0041096. So 0.5 - 0.0041 is about 0.4959.

So 0.4959 * 155 = ?

Let me compute 155 * 0.4959.

155 * 0.4 = 62
155 * 0.09 = 13.95
155 * 0.005 = 0.775
155 * 0.0009=0.1395
Adding all together: 62 +13.95=75.95 +0.775=76.725 +0.1395=76.8645.

So used is about $76.86. So the refund is 155-76.86=78.14.

Hmm, but that's approximately $78.14, and the closest option is J: $77. But wait, maybe the question uses a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps the policy is for six months, but that seems unlikely. Usually, annual policies are more common.

Wait, another approach: maybe the refund is calculated based on the number of months. Let's see. From March 10 to September 6. How many months is that?

March: from the 10th, so March is not a full month. April, May, June, July, August are full months. September: 6 days, so not a full month.

So from March 10 to September 6 is:

March: partial (22 days)
April: full
May: full
June: full
July: full
August: full
September: partial (6 days)

So that's 5 full months (April to August) plus parts of March and September.

If the company calculates refunds on a monthly basis, perhaps they charge for each full month the policy was in force, and any partial months are either charged or not, depending on the policy.

But without knowing the exact method, it's a bit tricky. Let me think differently. Maybe the policy is for a year, and the refund is based on the remaining months.

Alternatively, perhaps it's being canceled after a certain number of months, and the refund is a standard percentage.

Wait, another thought: the total period from March 10 to September 6 is about 181 days, which is roughly half a year (since 365/2=182.5). So 181 days is almost exactly half a year. So the refund would be approximately half of $155, which is $77.50. But the options don't have $77.50, but J is $77, which is close.

So maybe the refund is $77.50, but since the options are in whole dollars, it's rounded down to $77.

Alternatively, perhaps the company gives a refund for the exact number of days. Let me calculate 181/365 of $155 and subtract that from 155.

So 181/365 = approx 0.49589.

So 0.49589 *155 ≈ 76.86, so the refund is 155 -76.86=78.14, which is about $78.14. But the options don't have that. The closest is J: $77.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the policy was in effect for 6 months, so the refund is 155/2=77.50, which would round to $77.

Alternatively, perhaps the refund is calculated based on the number of months. If the policy was for a year, and it's canceled after 6 months, the refund would be half. But in this case, it's not exactly 6 months; it's about 5.9 months (since 181 days is about 5.9 months, because 30 days per month average).

Wait, 181 days divided by 30 is approximately 6.033 months. So about 6 months. So the refund would be roughly half of $155, which is $77.50, so $77.

Alternatively, maybe the company refunds the premium minus the pro-rata amount, so 155 * (1 - 181/365) = 155 * (184/365) ≈ 155 * 0.5041 ≈ 78.14, which as before.

But the options don't have $78. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider it as a six-month policy, but that's not indicated in the question. Or perhaps the policy is for a year, and the refund is based on the exact days.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a different method, like a short-rate calculation, which might involve a higher charge for the initial months. But without knowing the exact terms, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe the policy is considered to have been in force for 180 days, which is exactly half a year. So the refund would be 155/2=77.50, which is $77.50, so the option J is $77, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the company only refunds in full months, and any partial month is not refunded. So let's see: how many full months were covered.

From March 10 to September 6.

March: started on the 10th, so no full month in March.

April: full month.

May: full.

June: full.

July: full.

August: full.

September: up to the 6th, so not a full month.

So that's 5 full months (April to August). So the used premium is 5/12 of 155.

Wait, 5/12 of 155 is (155 *5)/12 = 775/12 ≈64.58. So the used amount is about $64.58, so the refund would be 155 -64.58≈90.42. But none of the options are near $90 except maybe E: $93, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, that doesn't match any of the options well. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the company charges for each full month, and the days beyond that are considered as an additional fraction. For example, March: 22 days, which is about 0.73 of a month (22/30). So total months used would be 0.73 (March) +1 (April) +1 (May) +1 (June) +1 (July) +1 (August) + 0.2 (September: 6/30). So total months: 0.73 + 5 + 0.2=5.93 months. So 5.93/12=0.494, so about 49.4% of the premium used. So the used amount is 155 *0.494≈76.57, so refund is 155-76.57≈78.43. Again, $78, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the insurance company calculates the refund as a pro-rata based on the exact days, so 181 days out of 365. So the used is (181/365)*155 ≈76.86, so refund is 78.14. But the options don't have that. The closest is J:77, but that's $1.14 off. Alternatively, perhaps the company uses 360 days for calculations, which is common in some financial contexts. Let's see: 181/360=0.503. So 0.503*155≈77.965, so refund would be 155-77.965≈77.03, which is around $77. So that would match option J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a simpler approach, like the policy was canceled after 6 months, so the refund is half the premium, which is $77.50, rounded to $77.

Given that, I think the intended answer is J: $77.

The question involves calculating the refund for an automobile insurance policy purchased on March 10 for $155 and canceled on September 6. The refund is based on the unused portion of the policy, assuming the policy is for a full year (365 days). 

To determine the refund, the number of days the policy was in force is calculated as follows:

- **March**: From March 10 to March 31 = 22 days  
- **April**: 30 days  
- **May**: 31 days  
- **June**: 30 days  
- **July**: 31 days  
- **August**: 31 days  
- **September**: From September 1 to September 6 = 6 days  

Adding these together:  
\[
22 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 6 = 181 \text{ days}
\]

The fraction of the year that has passed is:  
\[
\frac{181}{365} \approx 0.4959
\]

The used portion of the premium is calculated as:  
\[
0.4959 \times 155 \approx 76.86
\]

Thus, the refund is the remaining portion of the premium:  
\[
155 - 76.86 \approx 78.14
\]

However, the closest option to this value is **$77**, which likely represents a rounded or simplified calculation. Given the options provided, the most reasonable answer is:

**J: $77**
