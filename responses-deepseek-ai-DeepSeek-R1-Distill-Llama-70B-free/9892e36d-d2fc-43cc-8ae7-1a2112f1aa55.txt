Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about fluid flow. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my classes that when dealing with fluids in motion, Bernoulli's equation is probably involved. The question says the fluid flows through a horizontal pipe with negligible viscosity, which means we can ignore any viscous forces. So the flow is streamlined and the viscosity is zero, so Bernoulli's equation should apply here.

Wait, Bernoulli's equation states that in a fluid with no viscosity, the sum of the pressure, the kinetic energy per unit volume, and the potential energy per unit volume remains constant along a streamline. Since the pipe is horizontal, the vertical height doesn't change, so the potential energy term (which depends on height) cancels out. So the equation simplifies to P + ½ ρ v² = constant.

The problem gives me two points, Point 1 and Point 2. At Point 1, the diameter is d, and the speed is V. At Point 2, the diameter is d/3. I need to find the pressure at Point 2 relative to Point 1.

Wait, the flow rate is constant. Oh, right, the flow rate Q is the same at both points because the fluid is incompressible and the flow is steady. The flow rate Q is area times velocity, so Q = A1 * v1 = A2 * v2.

The area A is πr², so for a pipe, A is proportional to the square of the diameter. Since diameter at Point 2 is d/3, the radius is r2 = (d/3)/2 = d/6. So the area A2 is π (d/6)^2 = π d² / 36. Point 1 has diameter d, so radius d/2, area π (d/2)^2 = π d² /4.

So, Q = A1 * v1 = A2 * v2. Let's plug in the areas. So (π d²/4) * V = (π (d/3)^2) * v2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Point 2's diameter is d/3, so radius is (d/3)/2 = d/6, so area is π (d/6)^2 = π d²/36. So Q is A1 V = (π d²/4) V.

Setting that equal to A2 v2: (π d²/4) V = (π (d/3)^2) v2 → Wait, wait, no. Wait, Point 2's diameter is d/3, so the radius is (d/3)/2 = d/6. Hence, area is π (d/6)^2 = π d²/36.

So, (π d²/4) V = (π d²/36) v2. Let's cancel π d² from both sides. (1/4) V = (1/36) v2. Multiply both sides by 36: 9 V = v2. So v2 = 9 V.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check the math again. So, the flow rate equation is A1 V = A2 v2. A1 is π (d/2)^2 = π d²/4. A2 is π (d/3 / 2)^2 = π (d/6)^2 = π d²/36. So (π d²/4) V = (π d²/36) v2. Oh, wait, no, the diameters are d and d/3, so the radii are d/2 and (d/3)/2 = d/6.

So, A1 = π (d/2)^2 = π d²/4. A2 = π (d/6)^2 = π d²/36. So, A1 V = A2 v2 → (π d²/4) V = (π d²/36) v2. Cancel π d² from both sides. So (1/4) V = (1/36) v2 → v2 = (36/4) V → v2 =9 V. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the velocity at Point 2 is 9 times that at Point 1. Now, applying Bernoulli's equation. Since the pipe is horizontal, the potential energy terms (ρ g h) are the same at both points, so they cancel out. So, P1 + ½ ρ v1² = P2 + ½ ρ v2².

We can rearrange this to find P2 - P1. Let's subtract P2 from both sides: P1 - P2 = ½ ρ v2² - ½ ρ v1².

Wait, no. Wait, Bernoulli's equation is P1 + ½ ρ v1² = P2 + ½ ρ v2².

So, P1 - P2 = ½ ρ v2² - ½ ρ v1².

But v2 is 9 V, and v1 is V. So:

P1 - P2 = ½ ρ ( (9 V)^2 - V^2 ) = ½ ρ (81 V² - V²) = ½ ρ (80 V²) = 40 ρ V².

So, P1 = P2 + 40 ρ V² → So P2 is less than P1 by 40 ρ V². So the pressure at Point 2 is lower than at Point 1 by 40 ρ V².

Looking back at the options: Option D says less than P1 by 40 ρv². Option G is less by 4, etc. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the velocity is higher at Point 2, so the pressure should be lower, which matches our result. So yes, the pressure at Point 2 is lower by 40 ρ V².

To solve the problem, we apply Bernoulli's equation and the principle of continuity of flow. The fluid flows through a horizontal pipe with negligible viscosity, so Bernoulli's equation simplifies to:

\[
P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2
\]

Here, \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) are the pressures at Points 1 and 2, respectively, and \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the flow speeds at these points. The potential energy term cancels out because the pipe is horizontal.

### Step 1: Relating velocities using the continuity equation
The flow rate \(Q\) is constant, and \(Q = A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2\), where \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) are the cross-sectional areas of the pipe at Points 1 and 2, respectively. The area of a pipe is proportional to the square of its radius (or diameter). 

- At Point 1, the diameter is \(d\), so the radius is \(r_1 = d/2\), and the area is:
  \[
  A_1 = \pi r_1^2 = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}
  \]

- At Point 2, the diameter is \(d/3\), so the radius is \(r_2 = (d/3)/2 = d/6\), and the area is:
  \[
  A_2 = \pi r_2^2 = \pi \left(\frac{d}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{36}
  \]

Using \(Q = A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2\), we find:
\[
\frac{\pi d^2}{4} v_1 = \frac{\pi d^2}{36} v_2
\]

Canceling \(\pi d^2\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{4} v_1 = \frac{1}{36} v_2
\]

Solving for \(v_2\):
\[
v_2 = 9 v_1
\]

Thus, the velocity at Point 2 is \(v_2 = 9v_1\).

### Step 2: Applying Bernoulli's equation
Substituting \(v_2 = 9v_1\) into Bernoulli's equation:
\[
P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho (9v_1)^2
\]

Simplify:
\[
P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho (81v_1^2)
\]

\[
P_1 - P_2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho (81v_1^2 - v_1^2)
\]

\[
P_1 - P_2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho (80v_1^2)
\]

\[
P_1 - P_2 = 40 \rho v_1^2
\]

This shows that the pressure at Point 2 is less than the pressure at Point 1 by \(40 \rho v^2\).

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**D: less than the pressure at Point 1 by \(40 \rho v^2\)**
