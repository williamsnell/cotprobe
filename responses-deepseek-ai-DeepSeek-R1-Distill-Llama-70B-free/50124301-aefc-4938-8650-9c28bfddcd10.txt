Okay, so I've got this question about boiling points of hydrocarbons. Hmm, I remember that boiling points are related to molecular weight and structure. Let me think.

The hydrocarbons given are: methane (a), n-hexane (b), n-undecane (c), neopentane (d), and 2,3-dimethylbutane (e). I need to arrange them in order of increasing boiling points.

First, I should recall that straight-chain alkanes have higher boiling points than their branched isomers because they have more surface area for London dispersion forces. So, the more branching, the lower the boiling point.

Methane is CH4. It's the smallest, so it should have the lowest boiling point. Wait, but wait—actually, the question says "increasing boiling points", so the lowest first and highest last.

Let's list the molecular formulas. Methane is C1H4. Neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is C5H12. 2,3-dimethylbutane is also a pentane isomer? Let me see: its structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me draw it. But wait, 2,3-dimethylbutane is (CH3)2CHCH(CH3)2? No, wait. Butane is four carbons. So 2,3-dimethylbutane would be CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH3? Or wait, maybe it's CH(CH3)2-CH(CH3)- something. Oh wait, butane is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with two methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3. So it becomes CH(CH3)2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH3? No, that's pentane. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Butane is four carbons: CH2CH2CH2CH3. So 2,3-dimethylbutane would have methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3. So the structure would be CH2C(CH3)2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, butane is CH2CH2CH2CH3. Adding methyl groups on C2 and C3 would make the structure (CH3)C-CH(CH3)-? Maybe I should think of it as 2,3-dimethylbutane being (CH3)2CHCH2CH3? No, that's pentane. Wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Butane is four carbons. Adding two methyl groups would make the formula C6H14? Wait, no. Wait, the general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. Methane is C1H4. Hexane is C6H14. Neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is C5H12. 2,3-dimethylbutane would be a pentane isomer? Wait, no. Butane is four carbons; adding two methyl groups would give six carbons in total. Wait, no: butane is four carbons, each methyl is a CH2 group? No, no, wait. Let's think: butane is CH2CH2CH2CH3. Adding a methyl group on C2 would make it CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which is 2-methylbutane, but that's pentane. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 2-methylbutane would have five carbons. Because butane has four, adding a methyl group would make five. Oh wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Butane is four carbons: C-C-C-C. 2,3-dimethylbutane would have a methyl group on the second and third carbons. So the structure would be CH2-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH3. Wait, that can't be right because that would be five carbons. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, butane is four carbons. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH3? Wait, that would be 2,3-dimethylbutane, which is correct. So the formula is C6H14? Because the main chain is four carbons, and two methyl groups add two more carbons, making six total. So the formula is C6H14. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the main chain is four, and each methyl is a CH3. So the formula would be C4 + 2*(CH3) → C4+2*(1) → C6? So yes, C6H14.

So the compounds are:

a) Methane (C1H4)

b) n-hexane (C6H14)

c) n-undecane (C11H24)

d) neopentane (C5H12)

e) 2,3-dimethylbutane (C6H14)

Wait, but wait, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which has five carbons (C5H12). Yes.

So now, I need to arrange these in order of increasing boiling points.

Methane has the smallest molecular weight, so it'll have the lowest boiling point. Next would be the compounds with higher molecular weights, but also considering branching.

n-undecane is the largest with C11, so it has the highest boiling point.

So the order from lowest to highest boiling points:

Methane < ... < n-undecane.

Now, between the C5 and C6 compounds.

Neopentane (d) is a highly branched pentane. Its structure is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is very compact, so it has lower boiling point than n-pentane. But wait, in this case, the options are neopentane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, and n-hexane.

Wait, n-hexane is a straight-chain C6H14, so higher molecular weight than neopentane (C5H12). So n-hexane should have a higher boiling point than neopentane.

But wait, the other compound is 2,3-dimethylbutane, which is a branched C6H14. So which has a higher boiling point: n-hexane or 2,3-dimethylbutane?

In general, straight-chain alkanes have higher boiling points than their branched isomers because of greater surface area for London dispersion forces. So n-hexane (straight) has higher boiling point than 2,3-dimethylbutane (branched). So 2,3-dimethylbutane has lower BP than n-hexane.

So let's list the molecular weights:

Methane: MW 16

Neopentane: MW (12*5 +1*12) → wait, more accurately, the formula is C5H12. So MW is (5*12)+(12*1) → 5*12=60, 12 H is 12 → total 72 g/mol.

2,3-dimethylbutane is C6H14. So MW is (6*12)+(14*1)=72+14=86.

n-hexane is also C6H14, same as 2,3-dimethylbutane. So same molecular weight, but n-hexane is straight-chain, so higher BP than the branched isomer.

n-undecane is C11H24. MW is (11*12)+(24*1)=132+24=156.

So putting it together:

Boiling points from lowest to highest:

Methane (C1) < neopentane (C5, highly branched) < 2,3-dimethylbutane (C6, branched) < n-hexane (C6, straight) < n-undecane (C11).

Wait, wait. Wait, is neopentane (C5) lower BP than 2,3-dimethylbutane (C6)? Because C5 has lower MW than C6. So yes. So neopentane's BP is lower than 2,3-dimethylbutane.

So the order should be:

Methane < neopentane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < n-hexane < n-undecane.

Wait, but wait, I thought the straight-chain has higher BP than branched with same carbon count. So in C6, n-hexane (straight) has higher BP than 2,3-dimethylbutane (branched). So the order between them is correct.

So the list is:

a (methane) → d (neopentane) → e (2,3-dimethylbutane) → b (n-hexane) → c (n-undecane).

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option F: methane < neopentane < n-hexane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < n-undecane.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because 2,3-dimethylbutane is C6 branched, which should have lower BP than n-hexane.

So option F's order is methane, neopentane, n-hexane, then 2,3-dimethylbutane. That can't be right because 2,3-dimethylbutane has lower BP than n-hexane.

So the correct order is: methane < neopentane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < n-hexane < n-undecane.

Looking at the options:

Option F is: methane < neopentane < n-hexane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < n-undecane. No, that's not correct.

Wait, let me look again. Option B is: methane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < neopentane < n-hexane < n-undecane. No, because neopentane is lower than 2,3-dimethylbutane?

Wait, no. Neopentane is C5, 2,3-dimethylbutane is C6. So neopentane has lower MW, so lower BP. So the correct order is:

methane < neopentane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < n-hexane < n-undecane.

Which option is that?

Looking at the options:

Option F: methane < neopentane < n-hexane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < n-undecane → No, because n-hexane is higher than 2,3-dimethylbutane.

Option G: neopentane < methane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < n-hexane < n-undecane → No, methane is first.

Option B: methane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < neopentane < n-hexane < n-undecane → No, neopentane is C5, lower than C6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list them again:

Methane (C1) → lowest.

Next: neopentane (C5, branched).

Then: 2,3-dimethylbutane (C6, branched).

Then: n-hexane (C6, straight).

Highest: n-undecane (C11, straight).

So correct order is: a < d < e < b < c.

Looking at the options:

Option F is a < d < b < e < c → No, because e is C6 and b is C6; e has lower BP than b.

Option F's order is a, d, b, e, c → which is wrong because e has lower BP than b.

Option J: n-hexane < neopentane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < methane < n-undecane → No, methane is first.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for an option where the order is a < d < e < b < c.

Looking at all options:

Option F: a < d < b < e < c → No.

Option B: a < e < d < b < c → No, because d is C5, e is C6. So e should be after d.

Option F is a, d, b, e, c. Which is wrong.

Option G: d < a < e < b < c → No, methane is a, comes first.

Option J: b < d < e < a < c → No.

Option E: e < a < b < d < c → No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order between neopentane and 2,3-dimethylbutane. Neopentane is C5 (72 g/mol) and 2,3-dimethylbutane is C6 (84 g/mol). So higher MW means higher BP, so 2,3-dimethylbutane has higher BP than neopentane. So the correct order is a < d < e < b < c.

Which option has that?

Looking at the options:

Looking for a < d < e < b < c.

Option F has a < d < b < e < c → incorrect, because e (2,3-dimethylbutane) comes after b (n-hexane), which is wrong.

Option B: a < e < d < b < c → No, e is after a, but d is C5 and e is C6. So e should be after d in order.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing an option. Let's check all.

Option F: a < d < b < e < c → No.

Option B: a < e < d < b < c → No, because e is C6, which is higher than d (C5). So e comes after d.

Option G: d < a < e < b < c → No, a comes first.

Option J: b < d < e < a < c → No.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's see each option:

Option A: e < d < b < c < a → No.

Option B: a < e < d < b < c → a=1, e=6, d=5, so e after d? No, that can't be right because d is C5, e is C6. So e comes after d.

So B is a < e < d → which is wrong because e is higher than d.

Wait, so maybe I'm miscalculating the order. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the correct order is:

methane (a) → neopentane (d) → 2,3-dimethylbutane (e) → n-hexane (b) → n-undecane (c).

So, looking for an option that's a < d < e < b < c.

Looking through the options, does any option fit this?

Looking at option F: a, d, b, e, c → No.

Option J: b, d, e, a, c → No.

Option G: d, a, e, b, c → No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the molecular weights. Let me confirm:

Methane: C1H4 → MW 16.

Neopentane (d): C5H12 → MW (5*12)+(12*1)=72.

2,3-dimethylbutane (e): C6H14 → (6*12)+(14*1)=72 +14=86.

n-hexane (b): C6H14 → same as e, but straight chain → higher BP.

n-undecane (c): C11H24 → highest MW, highest BP.

So the order is based on MW and structure.

So the order is a (16) < d (72) < e (86) < b (same as e but straight) < c (156).

So the correct order is a < d < e < b < c.

Looking at the options, I don't see any option that matches this exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the options:

Option F: methane < neopentane < n-hexane < 2,3-dimethylbutane < n-undecane → a < d < b < e < c → No, because e (branched) comes before b (straight), which is incorrect.

Option B: a < e < d < b < c → a < e (C6) < d (C5) → No, because C5 has lower MW than C6. So e should be after d.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structures wrong. Let me check 2,3-dimethylbutane's formula again.

Wait, butane is four carbons. 2,3-dimethylbutane would have a four-carbon chain with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, let me count again.

Butane is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Adding a methyl on C2 and another on C3:

So C1: CH2-

C2: CH(CH3)-

C3: CH(CH3)-

C4: CH3.

So the formula is C(4 + 2) H? Let me count hydrogens.

Each CH2 group has 2 H, but with methyl branches, more Hs. Alternatively, the formula for 2,3-dimethylbutane is C6H14, same as hexane.

Yes, because butane is C4H10. Adding two methyl groups (each -CH2-) would add 2*(2 H) → but wait, the formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. So for n=6, it's C6H14. So 2,3-dimethylbutane is indeed C6H14.

So neopentane is C5H12, which has lower MW than 2,3-dimethylbutane (C6H14). So neopentane comes before 2,3-dimethylbutane.

So the order is a < d < e < b < c.

Looking back at the options, I don't see any option that matches this. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let me look again. Option F is: a < d < b < e < c → No, because e comes before b.

Option B is a < e < d < b < c → No, because e is C6, d is C5. So e comes after d.

Option G is d < a < e < b < c → No, a comes first.

Option F: a < d < b < e < c → No, because e
