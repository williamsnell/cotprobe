Okay, so I've got this math problem here about factorials and trailing zeros. The question is asking for how many positive integers k the decimal representation of k! ends with exactly 99 zeros. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. And since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, the number of trailing zeros depends on the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factors of k!. But wait, I think there are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial, so the number of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros. Yeah, that's right.

So the formula to find the number of trailing zeros in k! is to divide k by 5, then divide the result by 5 again, and keep going until the division results in zero. Sum all those quotients. For example, for k=100, it's 100/5 =20, 20/5=4, 4/5=0, so 20+4=24 zeros.

The question is about finding k such that this total equals exactly 99. So we need to find all k where the sum of floor(k/5) + floor(k/25) + floor(k/125) + ... equals 99.

I think that each time we increase k, the number of trailing zeros increases, but sometimes it jumps by more than one, especially when k crosses multiples of higher powers of 5.

Wait, but can there be multiple k's that result in the same number of trailing zeros? Like, maybe two consecutive k's give the same count. I think so. For example, when k is like 24 and 25, I think 24! has some number of zeros, and 25! jumps because 25 contributes two 5s.

So the problem is to find how many k's have exactly 99 trailing zeros.

I think that the number of k's that give a certain number of trailing zeros is usually 5, but sometimes when a higher power of 5 is crossed, the number of k's that give the same zero count is more.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose for a given n, the number of trailing zeros is Z(n). Then Z(k) increases roughly as k increases. But when k crosses a multiple of 5, especially higher powers, Z(k) increases by more than one. So for each n, there might be a range of k where Z(k) = n.

Wait no, the function Z(k) is non-decreasing. Each time k increases, Z(k) either stays the same or increases. So the number of k's that have Z(k)=99 is the number of consecutive integers where Z(k) doesn't increase beyond 99.

I think the maximum possible is 5, but sometimes it could be less, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the number of solutions is either 0 or 5 or some other number, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me try to compute for 99.

We can set up the equation:

Z(k) = floor(k/5) + floor(k/25) + floor(k/125) + ... = 99.

We need to find all k such that this sum equals 99.

Let me approximate. Let's ignore the floor functions for a moment and solve k/5 + k/25 + k/125 + ... =99.

This is a geometric series with a= k/5, ratio=1/5. The sum is (k/5)/(1-1/5) )= (k/5)/(4/5) )= k/4.

So approximately k is about 99 *4 = 396.

So around 396, let's compute Z(396):

396 divided by 5 is 79.2, so 79.

Divided by 25:396/25=15.84, so 15.

Divided by 125: 3.168, so 3.

Divided by 625: 0.6336, so 0.

So total is 79+15+3=97, which is less than 99. So we need a higher k.

Wait, maybe I should compute for 400.

400/5=80, 400/25=16, 400/125=3.2→3, 400/625=0. So sum is 80+16+3=99. Oh, so Z(400)=99.

Wait, but what about k=399?

Let's compute Z(399):

399/5=79.8 →79

399/25=15.96→15

399/125=3.192→3

Higher powers are 0. So sum is 79+15+3=97. Hmm, not 99.

Wait, so what about 400 gives 99 and 399 gives 97? That can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Z(395):

395/5=79, 395/25=15.8→15, 395/125=3.16→3. Sum=79+15+3=97.

Same as 396, 397, 398, 399. Then what about 400: 80+16+3=99.

So between 399 and 400, the count jumps from 97 to 99. So 400 is the first k where Z(k)=99.

Wait, that's a jump of 2. So 400 gives 99, 401 also.

Wait, let me check for 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405.

At k=400: Z=99.

k=405: 405/5=81, 405/25=16.2→16, 405/125=3.24→3. So sum is 81+16+3=100.

Wait, that's more. So let's see what's happening.

Wait, maybe I should think about the exact k where Z(k)=99.

We have Z(400)=80+16+3=99.

What about 395: 395/5=79, 395/25=15, 395/125=3 → sum 97.

So between 395 and 400, the sum goes from 97 to 99. So maybe 396: 396/5=79.2 →79, 396/25=15.84→15, 396/125=3.168→3 → sum 79+15+3=97.

Same for 397,398,399, same 97.

At 400: 80+16+3=99.

Wait, so when k=400, Z=99.

What about k=401:

401/5=80.2→80, 401/25=16.04→16, 401/125=3.208→3. So sum 80+16+3=99.

Same for 402,403,404.

k=405: 405/5=81, 405/25=16.2→16, 405/125=3.24→3. Sum 81+16+3=100.

Wait, but let me check 405:

405 ÷5=81, ÷25=16.2→16, ÷125=3.24→3. Total 81+16+3=100.

So Z(405)=100.

So between 400 and 405, how does it go.

At k=400: Z=99.

k=401: same as 400, but let's compute:

400: 80+16+3=99.

401: 401//5=80 (since 5*80=400 ≤401), 401//25=16 (25*16=400 ≤401), 401//125=3. So sum is 80+16+3=99.

Similarly for 402,403,404: same as 400, because dividing by 5 gives 80 (since 402/5 is 80.4, but floor is 80; same for 403,404.

But when k=405, 405//5=81. So the first term jumps.

So, the values of k where Z(k)=99 are from 400 to 404.

Wait, so that's 5 values: 400,401,402,403,404.

Wait, 400 to 404 inclusive is 5 numbers.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me compute Z(404):

404//5=80 (5*80=400 ≤404), 404//25=16 (25*16=400 ≤404), 404//125=3. So sum is 80+16+3=99.

Yes. So for k=400 to 404 inclusive: 5 numbers.

But wait, what about k=399? As earlier, Z(399)=97.

So, from k=400 to 404, Z(k)=99, and at 405, it jumps to 100.

So that's 5 values of k.

Wait, but let me think again. Because 400 gives 99, and 401,402,403,404 give the same because adding 1,2,3,4 doesn't add another 5 factor until 405, which is 5*81.

So yes, 5 k's: 400,401,402,403,404.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. What about k=400: when you calculate Z(400), you get 80+16+3=99.

Wait, but 400 is 5^3 * 4. So 400//5=80, 400//25=16, 400//125=3, and 400//625=0.

So sum is 80+16+3=99.

Now, k=400: 99.

k=401: same as 400, because 401 isn't a multiple of 5.

Wait, but 401 divided by 5 is 80.2, but floor is 80, same as 400.

Same for 402,403,404.

Only when k reaches 405 does the first term (k//5) increase by 1, making Z(k)=100.

So the number of k's where Z(k)=99 is 5 (400,401,402,403,404).

But wait, the options only go up to J: One, etc. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:20, B:3, C:none, D:4, E:5, F:2, G:7, H:10, I:15, J:1.

So E is 5. So the answer would be E:5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because earlier I thought that for 99 zeros, there are 5 k's, but I'm not sure if that's always the case.

Alternatively, sometimes, when a higher power of 5 is involved, the number of k's might be less. For example, when k is a multiple of 25, adding 1 to k might not change the count until the next multiple.

Wait, another approach: for each k, Z(k) can be found, and the possible k's that give Z(k)=99 are consecutive numbers until the next multiple of 5.

Wait, let me compute Z(400)=99.

Z(400)=99.

Z(401)= same as Z(400) because 401 is not a multiple of 5. So yes, same.

Same for 402,403,404.

Z(405): 405/5=81, 405/25=16, 405/125=3. So 81+16+3=100.

So from 400 to 404: 5 numbers.

Wait, so 5 values. So the correct answer would be E:5.

But wait, wait another moment. Let me think about when k is larger, perhaps more than one higher power of 5 might affect it. For example, suppose when k crosses 625, which is 5^4. But 625 is way beyond 400.

Wait, so no, in this case, the only higher power is 125, which is 5^3.

So in this case, the number of k's where Z(k)=99 is 5.

So the answer should be E:5.

But wait, looking back, the options are given, and E is five.

But wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, when k increases from 399 to 400, the Z(k) increases from 97 to 99. So Z(400) is 99.

But wait, 400 is a multiple of 5^3 (since 5^3=125, 400 is 3.2 * 125). Wait, no, 400 is 5^2 * 16. So 400 is divisible by 25 but not by 125.

Wait, 400//5 = 80.

400//25=16.

400//125=3 (since 125*3=375 ≤400).

So sum is 80+16+3=99.

So k=400 gives Z=99.

k=401: same as 400, because 401 isn't a multiple of 5.

Similarly, k=402,403,404: same.

k=405: now, 405//5=81, 405//25=16, 405//125=3. So sum is 81+16+3=100.

So Z(405)=100.

So between 400 and 405, Z increases by 1 when k=405.

So the k's where Z(k)=99 are 400,401,402,403,404: that's 5 numbers.

So the correct answer would be E:5.

Wait, but let me check for k=395 and others.

Because sometimes when you cross a multiple of 25, the count increases by 2, which might cause the number of k's for a certain Z(k) to be less.

Wait, for example, let's say that when k is 24, Z(k)=4 (from 24//5=4, 24//25=0; sum 4). Then at k=25, Z(k) jumps to 6 (25//5=5, 25//25=1; sum 6). So between 25 and 29, Z(k) remains 6, because 26,27,28,29 are not multiples of 5. So 25,26,27,28,29: 5 k's with Z=6.

So in that case, number is 5.

Similarly, in our case, when k=400, Z=99, and the next k where Z increases is 405. So 5 k's.

So the answer should be E:5.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of k's for a given Z is usually 5, except when higher multiples cause bigger jumps. So in this case, it's 5.

But looking at the options, E is 5, which would be the correct answer.

To determine how many positive integers \( k \) result in \( k! \) ending with exactly 99 trailing zeros, we use the formula for the number of trailing zeros in \( k! \), which is given by:

\[
Z(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{125} \right\rfloor + \dots
\]

This formula counts the number of times 10 is a factor in \( k! \), which depends on the number of pairs of prime factors 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5.

### Step 1: Approximate \( k \) for \( Z(k) = 99 \)
To find \( k \) such that \( Z(k) = 99 \), we approximate by solving:

\[
\frac{k}{5} + \frac{k}{25} + \frac{k}{125} + \dots = 99
\]

This is a geometric series with the sum:

\[
\frac{k}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{5}} = \frac{k}{4}
\]

Setting \( \frac{k}{4} = 99 \), we estimate \( k \approx 396 \).

### Step 2: Refine \( k \) by calculating \( Z(k) \)
We calculate \( Z(k) \) for values around 396:

- For \( k = 396 \):
  \[
  Z(396) = \left\lfloor \frac{396}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{396}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{396}{125} \right\rfloor = 79 + 15 + 3 = 97
  \]

- For \( k = 400 \):
  \[
  Z(400) = \left\lfloor \frac{400}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{400}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{400}{125} \right\rfloor = 80 + 16 + 3 = 99
  \]

Thus, \( k = 400 \) is the smallest integer where \( Z(k) = 99 \).

### Step 3: Determine the range of \( k \) with \( Z(k) = 99 \)
We check subsequent values of \( k \):

- For \( k = 401, 402, 403, 404 \):
  \[
  Z(401) = Z(402) = Z(403) = Z(404) = 99
  \]

- For \( k = 405 \):
  \[
  Z(405) = \left\lfloor \frac{405}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{405}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{405}{125} \right\rfloor = 81 + 16 + 3 = 100
  \]

Thus, \( Z(k) = 99 \) for \( k = 400, 401, 402, 403, 404 \), which gives 5 values.

### Final Answer
The number of positive integers \( k \) for which \( k! \) ends with exactly 99 trailing zeros is **5**.
