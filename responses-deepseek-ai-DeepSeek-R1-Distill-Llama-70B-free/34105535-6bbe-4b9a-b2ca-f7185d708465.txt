Question:

This question refers to the following information.
First we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. …
That the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. …
As it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. … Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation."

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Copernicus and the tradition he was working in. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The passage given is from Copernicus's "The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies," written in 1543. I remember that Copernicus is famous for proposing the heliocentric model, where the Sun is at the center of the solar system instead of the Earth. But the question is about which tradition he was part of.

Looking at the options: 

A: Ptolemaic tradition – Ptolemy's model was geocentric, with Earth at the center. But Copernicus opposed that, so probably not A.

B: Skeptical tradition – Skeptics doubted everything, but I'm not sure how that ties here. Copernicus was presenting a new model, not just doubting.

C: Stoic tradition – Stoicism was more about ethics and cosmos being made of fire, maybe not directly related to his astronomical model.

D: Aristotelian tradition – Aristotle believed in a geocentric universe too. Since Copernicus was challenging that, maybe not D.

E: Platonic/Pythagorean tradition – I think Plato and Pythagoras believed in a spherical Earth and maybe some heliocentric ideas. Plato thought the Earth was a sphere, and Pythagoras might have had ideas about a central fire, possibly the Sun. So this could be it.

F: Observational tradition – This is about relying on observations. Copernicus used observations, but his work was more theoretical and mathematical.

G: Cartesian tradition – Descartes came later, so Copernicus wasn't in that.

H: Heliocentric tradition – Well, Copernicus is the founder of this, but the question is about which existing tradition he was working in, not creating a new one.

I: Empirical tradition – Again, similar to F. He used empirical data but the question is about the philosophical tradition.

J: Natural magic tradition – That's more about occult practices, doesn't fit.

The passage mentions the Earth being spherical and moving, which goes against Aristotle and Ptolemy. So he's going against the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views. The Platonic tradition, especially Pythagoras, supported the idea of a spherical Earth and possibly the idea of a central Sun. So Copernicus might have been influenced by them. 

I think the answer is E: the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition.

The passage from Copernicus's "The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies" challenges the geocentric models of Aristotle and Ptolemy by proposing a heliocentric model. However, the question asks which tradition he was working in, not the one he created. The Platonic/Pythagorean tradition emphasized a spherical Earth and considered the possibility of a central Sun, aligning with Copernicus's ideas. Therefore, the answer is:

E: the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition

Answer: E
