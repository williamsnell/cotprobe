Question:

A man participated in a bank robbery as the driver of the getaway vehicle. The other conspirators assured him there would be no injuries or killings, but while in the bank they killed two people. Pursuant to the state's felony murder rule, the getaway driver was convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to death. After exhausting his appeals, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear his case. He argued that he did not intend to kill and was not even present. What is the most likely holding of the Supreme Court?

Options:

A: The defendant's lack of intent to kill makes the application of the death penalty unconstitutional.
B: The Supreme Court cannot interfere with a state's application of the felony murder rule.
C: The felony murder rule is constitutional, but the defendant's execution is not justified in this case.
D: The felony murder rule is unconstitutional and the defendant's conviction must be reversed.
E: The defendant's role as a getaway driver does not justify a first degree murder charge.
F: The Eighth Amendment does not protect the defendant from execution in felony murder cases.
G: The defendant cannot be held responsible for the actions of his co-conspirators.
H: It is constitutional for a state to authorize the execution of an individual who participates in a robbery in which another robber takes life.
I: A conviction of first degree murder justifies the execution as long as aggravating circumstances are found to exist.
J: The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Supreme Court question about the felony murder rule and the death penalty. Let me start by breaking down what I know.

The question says a man was the getaway driver in a bank robbery. The others told him there wouldn't be any injuries or killings, but they ended up killing two people. Under the state's felony murder rule, he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Now, the Supreme Court is hearing his case, and he's arguing that he didn't intend to kill and wasn't even present when the killings happened.

Hmm, I remember that felony murder is when someone dies during the commission of a felony, and all participants can be held liable for murder, regardless of intent. But I'm not sure how the Supreme Court has ruled on this, especially when it comes to the death penalty.

I think about the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. There have been cases where the Court considered whether certain applications of the death penalty are constitutional. For example, in Enmund v. Florida, the Court held that the death penalty couldn't be applied to someone who wasn't a major participant and didn't intend for a killing to happen. That case involved a robbery where a murder occurred, and the defendant wasn't the shooter but was part of the robbery.

Wait, in Enmund, the Court ruled that the death penalty violated the Eighth Amendment because the defendant didn't kill or intend to kill. So if that's the case, the getaway driver here didn't intend for anyone to die and wasn't present, so maybe his situation is similar.

But then I also remember that some states have broader felony murder laws that could impose the death penalty even without specific intent. But the Supreme Court case law might limit that. So in this scenario, the defendant's situation aligns with the Enmund case, meaning the Court would likely find the death penalty unconstitutional here.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the lack of intent makes the death penalty unconstitutional. That aligns with Enmund. But let me check other options.

Option C says the felony murder rule is constitutional, but execution isn't justified. That's possible too. But wait, Enmund didn't strike down the felony murder rule itself, just the application of the death penalty in that case.

Option H says it's constitutional for a state to authorize execution for someone who participates in a robbery where another takes life. But Enmund would contradict that, because the Court in Enmund said that the death penalty in such cases is unconstitutional.

Option J says it's cruel and unusual, which would align with Enmund. So which one is correct?

Wait, the question is about the holding, not just the result. Enmund held that capital punishment is unconstitutional when the defendant didn't kill, intend to kill, or act with reckless indifference. So the Court would likely rule that applying the death penalty here is unconstitutional because he didn't have the required mens rea.

So looking at the options, option A says the lack of intent makes the death penalty unconstitutional. Option J is about cruel and unusual punishment, which is similar.

Wait, in Enmund, the Court held that the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment when the defendant didn't kill or intend to kill. So the reasoning was under the Eighth Amendment, making the execution unconstitutional. So the correct holding would be that the death penalty is unconstitutional in this case because of the lack of intent.

Thus, the answer would be A or J. Option A is about intent making the death penalty unconstitutional, while J is about it being cruel and unusual.

Wait, but the question is about the most likely holding. The Court in Enmund didn't overrule the felony murder rule; instead, it ruled on the death penalty's application. So the holding would be about the death penalty being unconstitutional based on the lack of intent, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe H is wrong because Enmund says that states can't execute in such cases.

Wait, but let me think again. The options are:

A: Lack of intent makes death penalty unconstitutional.

H: It's constitutional for a state to allow execution in such cases.

But Enmund says H is incorrect. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is about the death penalty application being unconstitutional, and option J is about cruel and unusual punishment. So it's a matter of which option matches the reasoning.

In Enmund, the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution when the defendant neither killed nor intended to kill. So the holding would be under the Eighth Amendment, making the execution unconstitutional. So option A is about the intent, and J is about the Eighth Amendment.

Wait, but option A says the lack of intent makes the death penalty application unconstitutional, which is correct. Option J says execution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, which is also correct, but perhaps more specific to the Eighth Amendment.

Wait, but the answer options are phrased differently. Let me see the exact options:

Option A: The defendant's lack of intent to kill makes the application of the death penalty unconstitutional.

Option J: The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.

So both A and J seem correct, but in Enmund, the Court specifically addressed the Eighth Amendment, so option J is more accurate.

Wait, but in Enmund, the Court ruled that the death penalty in such a case violates the Eighth Amendment because it's disproportionate. So the holding would be that it's cruel and unusual punishment. So the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but wait another moment. The felony murder rule itself wasn't struck down. The issue was the death penalty. So the holding is that the death penalty is unconstitutional in this context, making option J the correct one.

But looking back, the options are about what the Supreme Court's holding would be in this case.

Alternatively, another angle: the Supreme Court in Tison v. Arizona (1987) reconsidered Enmund and held that a defendant could be sentenced to death under felony murder if they were a major participant and acted with reckless indifference to human life. So if the getaway driver was a major participant but didn't intend to kill, perhaps Tison would apply.

Wait, in Tison, the defendants were involved in a prison break where a guard was killed. The Court held that the death penalty could be imposed if the defendant was a major participant and exhibited reckless indifference. But in our case, the driver was part of the robbery but didn't kill or intend to kill. So under Tison, if the defendant was a major participant and acted with reckless indifference, death is allowed.

But in this question, the defendant was the driver and perhaps not a major participant. Or maybe he was. It's a bit unclear.

Wait, but the question says that the other conspirators assured him there would be no injuries or killings. So he might not have acted with reckless indifference, as he thought no violence would occur.

So under Enmund, if he didn't intend to kill and wasn't a major participant, then the death penalty is unconstitutional. So in that case, the answer would be J, that the execution is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.

Alternatively, if the Court applies Tison, but the driver wasn't a major participant, then perhaps the death penalty is unconstitutional.

I think the key is that the defendant wasn't present and didn't intend for anyone to be killed. So the most likely holding is that the death penalty is unconstitutional because of the lack of intent, making it cruel and unusual.

So the answer would be J.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of applying the death penalty to a getaway driver in a bank robbery where others killed two people, under the state's felony murder rule. The defendant argues that he did not intend to kill and was not present when the killings occurred. The analysis hinges on Supreme Court precedent, particularly *Enmund v. Florida* and *Tison v. Arizona*.

In *Enmund v. Florida*, the Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the death penalty for a defendant who neither killed, intended to kill, nor acted with reckless indifference to human life. This case is directly applicable here because the defendant lacked intent to kill and was not present during the killings. However, in *Tison v. Arizona*, the Court later refined this rule, allowing the death penalty if the defendant was a major participant in the felony and acted with reckless indifference to human life. 

In this scenario, the defendant was the getaway driver and was assured by co-conspirators that no violence would occur. This suggests he was not a major participant and did not act with reckless indifference. Therefore, under *Enmund*, the death penalty would likely be deemed unconstitutional as it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.

Option A focuses on the lack of intent making the death penalty unconstitutional, which aligns with *Enmund*. Option J emphasizes that the execution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, which is also consistent with *Enmund*. However, the holding in *Enmund* explicitly addresses the Eighth Amendment, making Option J the most precise answer.
