Okay, so I've got this question about voting populations and which statement is the most accurate. Let's see, I need to go through each option and think about what I know regarding voter behavior and demographics.

The question is asking which statement is correct. The options are A through G. I'll go one by one.

Option A: Voters are more likely to vote at age 18 than at 65. Hmm, I remember that older people tend to vote more. Like, I think the elderly have higher voter turnout compared to younger people. So 18-year-olds might be less likely to vote than 65-year-olds. So A doesn't seem right.

Option B: Someone with a bachelor's degree is less likely to vote than someone with only a high school diploma. Wait, isn't it the opposite? I think higher education levels correlate with higher voter turnout. So people with degrees probably vote more, making B incorrect.

Option C: Affluent individuals are less likely to vote than impoverished ones. No, that's probably wrong. I think higher income people are more likely to vote. They might have more resources, transportation, and perhaps more engagement in politics. So C doesn't seem right.

Option D: Individuals are less likely to vote in a closely contested race. Wait, isn't it the opposite? If a race is close, like really competitive, don't more people come out to vote because they think their vote matters more? So D might not be correct.

Option E: Individuals with no high school diploma are more likely to vote than those with one. That seems off. From what I know, education level is a strong predictor of voting. People with higher education, including high school diplomas, are more likely to vote. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: People in rural areas are less likely to vote than urban. I'm not too sure about this. I think sometimes rural areas have different turnout patterns, but I don't recall if urban vs rural directly correlates in a straightforward way. Maybe it's more about other factors like education or income. I'll come back to this one.

Option G: Someone with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than someone with only a high school diploma. Yes, this makes sense. Higher education usually means higher voter turnout. So G is likely correct.

So, from this analysis, G seems to be the correct answer. Let me just double-check each option quickly.

A: 18-year-olds vote less than 65-year-olds. Correct, so A is incorrect.

B: Bachelor's less than high school. No, higher education means more voting. So B is wrong.

C: Affluent less than impoverished. No, affluent vote more. So C wrong.

D: Less likely in close races? No, higher turnout. So D wrong.

E: No diploma more than diploma. No, diploma holders vote more. So E wrong.

F: Rural less than urban. I don't think this is a strong factor. Maybe in some cases, but not a general rule. So F isn't the best choice.

G: Graduate degree more than high school. Yes, that's correct.

The most accurate statement is that individuals with a graduate degree are more likely to vote than those with only a high school diploma.

Answer: G
