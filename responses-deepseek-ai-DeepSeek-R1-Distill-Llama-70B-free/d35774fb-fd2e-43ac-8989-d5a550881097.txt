Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about short-term memory, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking about the two principal explanations for why short-term memory has limited capacity. Hmm, I remember that short-term memory, also known as working memory, can only hold so much information for a short period before it's either stored longer or forgotten.

Wait, the options are from A to J, each with different pairs. Let me think about what I know about memory theories. I think there are two main ideas here. One is about how information fades over time if you don't rehearse it, right? So like, if you don't repeat the info, it just decays and disappears. That's the time-decay theory. The other main idea is about interference, where new information comes in and pushes out the old stuff you were trying to remember. So interference could be proactive, where old info interferes with new, or retroactive, where new info interferes with old. Both of these would limit how much you can hold in short-term memory.

Looking at the options, option C says Interference and Time-Decay. That sounds right because those are the two explanations I just thought of. Option A is rehearsal and forgetting. Wait, rehearsal is a strategy to prevent forgetting, but I'm not sure if that's one of the main explanations for the capacity limit. Forgetting is more like a result of the limited capacity, not the reason for it. So A might not be the right choice.

Option D is capacity and duration. Capacity refers to how much you can hold, and duration is how long. But the question is about the explanations for the limited capacity, not the capacity itself. So D doesn't explain why it's limited, just what the limits are.

Option E is chunking and associative learning. Chunking is a way to increase the amount of information you can hold, like grouping numbers into smaller sets. But that's more about how we cope with the limits, not the reasons for them. Associative learning is about forming connections, which might help in remembering but not directly explaining the capacity limits.

Option G is attention and distraction. Attention is about what information you focus on, but distraction would affect how much you can process, not the inherent capacity limits of short-term memory. So maybe not G.

Option I is working memory and long-term storage. Working memory is part of short-term, but the capacity issue isn't because of long-term storage. So I don't think that's right either.

So the best fit seems to be option C: Interference and Time-Decay. These are the two main theories explaining why short-term memory can't hold too much information for too long.

The two principal explanations for the limited capacity of short-term memory are interference and time-decay. Interference occurs when new information displaces or disrupts previously stored information, while time-decay refers to the natural fading of memory traces over time if they are not rehearsed. These factors directly explain the constraints on short-term memory's capacity.

Answer: C
