Okay, so I have this economics question in front of me about capital deepening and technological progress. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about these concepts.

Capital deepening, if I remember correctly, refers to an increase in the capital per worker, meaning each worker has more capital to work with. This can make production more efficient because workers have better tools or machinery, leading to higher productivity.

The question is about why technological progress is considered the most important factor for growth in advanced countries, explained through the concept of capital deepening. So, the options are A through D.

Option A says the capital-output ratio has risen. Wait, the capital-output ratio is the amount of capital needed to produce one unit of output. If this ratio rises, it means you need more capital for each unit, which might not directly explain technological progress. I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Option B states that technological progress is the factor that has been most instrumental in offsetting diminishing returns. Diminishing returns happen when adding more capital or labor leads to smaller increases in output. So how does technological progress help here? Well, technological advancements can make each unit of capital more effective, so even if you add more capital, the returns don't diminish as much because each capital unit is doing more. Or maybe it's about how technology allows for better allocation, avoiding the diminishing returns by making capital more efficient. This seems plausible because if you have better technology, the same amount of capital can produce more, offsetting the problem of diminishing returns as you increase capital per worker.

Option C suggests the capital-labor ratio has decreased. Wait, capital deepening is about increasing the capital per worker, so the ratio should go up, not down. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option D says new investments have reduced the stock of capital. That doesn't make much sense. New investments usually add to the capital stock, so this seems wrong.

So, focusing back on option B. Technological progress helps offset diminishing returns. Because as you have more capital per worker (capital deepening), without technological progress, each additional unit of capital might contribute less to outputâ€”diminishing returns. But with technological advancements, each new unit of capital is more productive, so the returns don't diminish as quickly. This would mean that even as capital per worker increases, output increases more than proportionally because of better technology. So economists think that technological progress is a key driver because it prevents the economy from hitting the limits of diminishing returns from capital deepening alone.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

Capital deepening refers to an increase in the capital per worker, enhancing productivity. The question asks why technological progress is seen as the most important factor for growth in advanced countries through this concept. 

- **Option A** mentions the capital-output ratio rising, which implies more capital is needed per unit of output. This doesn't directly explain technological progress.  
- **Option B** highlights that technological progress offsets diminishing returns. As capital per worker increases, diminishing returns could occur, but technological advancements make capital more efficient, preventing returns from diminishing quickly. This aligns with the idea that technology drives growth.  
- **Option C** suggests the capital-labor ratio has decreased, which contradicts capital deepening, as the ratio should rise.  
- **Option D** claims new investments reduce capital stock, which is incorrect since investments typically increase capital.  

Thus, **Option B** is correct because technological progress enhances capital efficiency, offsetting diminishing returns and driving growth.
