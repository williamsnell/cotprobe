Okay, so I've got this tax question here about Prime Corp. and their taxable income. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, first, I remember that corporations use accrual accounting, so their book income is based on that method. The question says their reported book income before federal income taxes is $300,000. But wait, taxable income isn't the same as book income because of the differences in how certain items are treated for tax purposes versus GAAP.

Looking at the details, they have $17,000 of corporate bond interest income. I think interest from corporate bonds is taxable. Wait, no, wait—corporate bond interest is taxable to the corporation, right? Because when a corporation owns bonds, the interest it receives is income. So that's included in taxable income. So that part doesn't change anything.

Then there's a $20,000 expense for term life insurance premiums on corporate officers. Hmm, term life insurance. Okay, so I remember that in tax, the treatment of life insurance premiums depends on who owns the policy. If the corporation is the owner and beneficiary, like it says here, then the premiums they pay are deductible as an expense. Wait, no, wait a second. No, wait, I think for corporations, the term life insurance premiums are not deductible as a business expense. Or is that only for certain cases?

Wait, let me think again. For individuals, the premiums on their own life insurance aren't deductible. But for businesses, if they have a term life policy on an officer, are the premiums deductible? Or is it only for key person insurance where the business can deduct the premiums? I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, I think that the general rule is that life insurance premiums paid by a business on the life of an employee (like a corporate officer) are not deductible. Because the corporation is the beneficiary, and the proceeds would be taxable to the corporation when the officer dies. So the premiums are treated as a nondeductible expense. So, in this case, the $20,000 expense for term life insurance is not allowed for tax purposes. That means, for taxable income, this expense would be added back.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Or is it that the premiums are deductible, but the proceeds are taxable? Or is it the other way around? No, I'm pretty sure that the premiums are not deductible because the IRS considers them a personal expense, not a business expense. So, for tax purposes, the corporation can't deduct the $20,000. So in the Schedule M-1, which reconciles book income to taxable income, this expense would be added back.

So the book income is $300,000. But in that $300k, they included the $17k bond interest as income. Wait, no, bond interest is taxable, so that's already included in taxable income. Wait, no, no—bond interest is taxable income, so that's correct on the tax return. So the book income includes that $17k, which is correct for tax purposes.

But the $20k term life insurance expense is subtracted in book income, but for tax purposes, it's not allowed. So to get from book to taxable, you have to add back that $20k because it was subtracted in book but isn't allowed in tax. So, taxable income would be book income plus the disallowed expense.

So, $300,000 plus $20,000 equals $320,000. Looking at the options, E is $320,000.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The book income is $300k before federal taxes. So that's the company's accounting income. They have the $17k interest which is taxable, so that's fine. The term life insurance is an expense on the books, so book income is reduced by $20k. But for tax purposes, that expense isn't allowed. So in the M-1 reconciliation, we have to take the book income and adjust it. So, the book income is 300k. The tax return will not allow the $20k deduction, so we add it back. So, 300k + 20k = 320k, which is option E.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option E is $320k. The other options include 310k, 330k, etc. So I think E is the right answer.

Prime Corp. is an accrual-basis calendar-year C corporation with a reported book income before federal income taxes of $300,000. This amount includes $17,000 of corporate bond interest income, which is taxable and correctly included in taxable income. Additionally, Prime Corp. incurred a $20,000 expense for term life insurance premiums on corporate officers, where the corporation is the policy owner and beneficiary. 

For tax purposes, life insurance premiums paid by a corporation on the life of an officer are not deductible because the IRS considers them a nondeductible personal expense. Therefore, the $20,000 expense must be added back to book income when reconciling to taxable income on Schedule M-1. 

Thus, Prime Corp.'s taxable income is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Taxable Income} = \$300,000 \, (\text{Book Income}) + \$20,000 \, (\text{Nondeductible Life Insurance Premiums}) = \$320,000
\]

The correct answer is **E: $320,000**.
