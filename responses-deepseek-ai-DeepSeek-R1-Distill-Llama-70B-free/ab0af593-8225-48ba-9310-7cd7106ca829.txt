Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the volume of a solid S. The base is an elliptical region defined by the equation 9x² + 4y² = 36. And the cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are isosceles right triangles, with the hypotenuse lying in the base.

Hmm, right. I remember that for volumes of solids with known cross-sections, we can use the method of slicing. Since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis, I should integrate with respect to x.

First, I think I should rewrite the equation of the ellipse in its standard form. The given equation is 9x² + 4y² = 36. Dividing both sides by 36 to normalize it, I get (x²)/4 + (y²)/9 = 1. Oh wait, no, 36 divided by 9 is 4 for the x term and 36 divided by 4 is 9 for the y term. So yes, standard form is (x²)/(2²) + (y²)/(3²) = 1. So the semi-major axis is 3 along y, and the semi-minor is 2 along x.

Now, the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles. Isosceles right triangle means the two legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is leg * sqrt(2). The hypotenuse is in the base, which is the ellipse. So the hypotenuse is the line segment across the ellipse at each x, which I think is the width of the ellipse at that x. So the length of the hypotenuse would be 2y, since for a given x, y ranges from negative to positive, so the total length is 2y.

Wait, but in the ellipse equation, for a given x, y is sqrt( (9)(1 - (x²)/4) ). Wait, let me rearrange the equation:

From 9x² +4y²=36, solving for y:

4y² = 36 -9x² → y² = (36-9x²)/4 → y² = 9(4 -x²)/4 → y = ± (3/2) * sqrt(4 - x²). So at a given x, the y values go from -(3/2)sqrt(4-x²) to +(3/2)sqrt(4-x²). So the full length in y (the height of the ellipse at x) is 2*(3/2)sqrt(4-x²) )= 3 sqrt(4 -x²).

Wait, but that's the total length along the y-axis for a given x. But wait, in the cross-sections, which are perpendicular to the x-axis, the triangle's hypotenuse is in the base. So the hypotenuse length is the width of the ellipse at that x, which is 3 sqrt(4 -x²) * 2? Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought that the hypotenuse is 2y, but let me think again. For a given x, the base of the ellipse is the line from (x, y) to (x, -y), so the length is 2y. But wait, according to the equation, y is (3/2) sqrt(4 - x²), so 2y would be 3 sqrt(4 - x²). So that's the hypotenuse of the triangle.

Since the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal. Let's denote each leg as 'a'. Then, the hypotenuse is a*sqrt(2). But the hypotenuse is 3 sqrt(4 -x²), so:

a * sqrt(2) = 3 sqrt(4 - x²) → a = [3 sqrt(4 -x²)] / sqrt(2) = 3/sqrt(2) * sqrt(4 -x²).

But wait, the area of the triangle is (a²)/2, because for a right triangle, area is (base * height)/2, and since it's isosceles, base = height = a.

So the area A(x) is (a²)/2. Substituting a from above:

a = [3 sqrt(4 -x²)] / sqrt(2) → a² = (9 (4 -x²)) / 2.

So A(x) = (9 (4 -x²)/2 ) / 2 = 9 (4 -x²) / 4.

Wait, let me check that. Area is (a^2)/2. So:

a² = [ (3 sqrt(4 -x²) ) / sqrt(2) ]² = (9 (4 - x²)) / 2.

So A(x) = (9 (4 -x²)/2 ) / 2 → 9 (4 -x²) /4.

So A(x) = (9/4)(4 - x²).

Then, the volume V is the integral of A(x) dx from x = -a to x = a, where a is the semi-minor axis length. Looking back, the ellipse is (x²)/4 + (y²)/9 =1, so x ranges from -2 to 2.

So V = ∫ from -2 to 2 of (9/4)(4 - x²) dx.

Since the integrand is even function (because x² is even), I can compute from 0 to 2 and double it.

So V = 2 * [ ∫ from 0 to2 (9/4)(4 -x²) dx ].

Let me compute the integral.

First, take constants out: (9/4) * ∫ (4 - x²) dx from 0 to 2.

Compute ∫ (4 -x²) dx = 4x - (x^3)/3 evaluated from 0 to 2.

At x=2:

4*(2) =8; (2)^3 /3 =8/3 → 8 - 8/3 = (24/3 -8/3 )= 16/3.

At x=0, it's 0. So the integral from 0 to2 is 16/3.

So V= 2*(9/4)*(16/3).

Compute this:

2 * (9/4) * (16/3) = (2 *9 *16)/(4*3) ) → numerator 2*9*16=288; denominator 4*3=12 → 288/12=24.

So the volume is 24. Looking at the options, option D is 24.

To find the volume of the solid \( S \), we start by analyzing the given information. The base of \( S \) is an elliptical region defined by the equation \( 9x^2 + 4y^2 = 36 \). Rewriting this in standard form, we divide through by 36:

\[
\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1.
\]

This represents an ellipse with a semi-minor axis of length 2 along the \( x \)-axis and a semi-major axis of length 3 along the \( y \)-axis. The ellipse extends from \( x = -2 \) to \( x = 2 \).

The cross-sections of \( S \) perpendicular to the \( x \)-axis are isosceles right triangles, with the hypotenuse lying in the base (the ellipse). For a given \( x \), the hypotenuse of the triangle corresponds to the width of the ellipse at that \( x \). Solving the ellipse equation for \( y \), we find:

\[
y = \pm \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{4 - x^2}.
\]

Thus, the total width of the ellipse at a given \( x \) is:

\[
2y = 3 \sqrt{4 - x^2}.
\]

Since the cross-sections are isosceles right triangles, the legs of the triangle are equal, and the hypotenuse is related to the legs by a factor of \( \sqrt{2} \). Let the legs of the triangle be \( a \). Then:

\[
a \sqrt{2} = 3 \sqrt{4 - x^2} \implies a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{4 - x^2}.
\]

The area of the triangle is given by:

\[
A(x) = \frac{1}{2} a^2.
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{4 - x^2} \), we find:

\[
a^2 = \frac{9}{2} (4 - x^2),
\]

so:

\[
A(x) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{2} (4 - x^2) = \frac{9}{4} (4 - x^2).
\]

To find the volume of \( S \), we integrate \( A(x) \) over the interval \( x = -2 \) to \( x = 2 \). Since \( A(x) \) is an even function, we can compute the integral from \( 0 \) to \( 2 \) and double the result:

\[
V = 2 \int_{0}^{2} \frac{9}{4} (4 - x^2) \, dx.
\]

Factoring out constants:

\[
V = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{4} \int_{0}^{2} (4 - x^2) \, dx.
\]

The integral of \( 4 - x^2 \) is:

\[
\int (4 - x^2) \, dx = 4x - \frac{x^3}{3}.
\]

Evaluating from \( 0 \) to \( 2 \):

\[
\left[ 4(2) - \frac{(2)^3}{3} \right] - \left[ 4(0) - \frac{(0)^3}{3} \right] = 8 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3}.
\]

Thus:

\[
V = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{4} \cdot \frac{16}{3} = \frac{2 \cdot 9 \cdot 16}{4 \cdot 3} = \frac{288}{12} = 24.
\]

The volume of the solid is \( 24 \). From the given options, the correct answer is:
