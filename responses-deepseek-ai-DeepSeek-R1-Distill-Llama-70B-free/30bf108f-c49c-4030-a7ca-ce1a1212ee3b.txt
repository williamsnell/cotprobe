Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find out how many different 6-letter arrangements can be made from the letters in the word BANANA. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with permutations of letters that have repeating characters, the formula involves factorials and dividing by the factorial of the number of repeats for each repeated character.

Wait, the word BANANA has 6 letters. Let me count the letters. B, A, N, A, N, A. Oh right, so there are three A's and two N's, and one B. So the letters are A, A, A, N, N, B.

I think the formula for permutations of a multiset is n! divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each repeated element. So in this case, n is 6 because there are 6 letters. Then, since A appears 3 times and N appears 2 times, the denominator would be 3! for the A's and 2! for the N's. B only appears once, so its factorial is 1!, which doesn't change the product.

So putting that together, the number of arrangements should be 6! / (3! * 2! * 1!). Let me compute that step by step.

First, 6! is 720. Then, 3! is 6, 2! is 2, and 1! is 1. Multiplying the denominator: 6 * 2 * 1 = 12. So 720 divided by 12 is 60. Oh, so the answer should be 60. Let me check the options. Option D is 60. So I think the correct answer is D.

But wait, am I missing something? Let me double-check. The word is BANANA, which has 6 letters with 3 A's, 2 N's, and 1 B. Yes, so the calculation is correct. 720 divided by (6 * 2) is indeed 60. Yeah, I'm confident now. The answer is D.

The word BANANA consists of 6 letters with the following counts: 3 A's, 2 N's, and 1 B. To calculate the number of unique 6-letter arrangements, we use the formula for permutations of a multiset:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \dots \cdot n_k!}
\]

Here, \( n = 6 \) (total letters), \( n_1 = 3 \) (A's), \( n_2 = 2 \) (N's), and \( n_3 = 1 \) (B). Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{6!}{3! \cdot 2! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{6 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Thus, the number of different 6-letter arrangements is **60**.
