Okay, so I've got this question about social psychology experiments and evaluation apprehension. Hmm, I remember that evaluation apprehension refers to the anxiety people feel when they're being evaluated, which can affect their behavior in experiments. The question is asking how to eliminate this from experimental settings.

Let me think about the options. Option A says conducting the experiment with the subject's peers present. Wait, wouldn't that actually increase apprehension? Because if their peers are around, they might feel more pressure to perform well or conform, which could make the problem worse, not better.

Option B suggests offering financial incentives. I'm not sure about that. Money might motivate them, but does it reduce their fear of being judged? Maybe not directly. They might still be worried about looking bad even if they're getting paid.

Option C is making the subject aware they're being observed. That sounds counterintuitive. If you tell them they're being watched, wouldn't that make them more anxious? I think that would heighten their apprehension, so that's probably not the right choice.

Option D talks about field experiments and nonobtrusive approaches. Oh right, field experiments are done in more natural settings rather than a lab. Nonobtrusive means the subjects don't know they're being observed. So if they don't know they're part of an experiment, they won't feel evaluation apprehension because they aren't aware of being judged. That makes sense as a way to eliminate it.

Option E is giving false feedback. I'm not sure how that would help. Maybe if you tell them they did well when they didn't, they might feel better, but it doesn't eliminate the apprehension itself. It's more about manipulating their perception after the fact.

Option F suggests increasing the number of observers. That seems like it would make things worse. More people watching would probably make the subject more anxious, so that's not the solution.

Option G is a double-blind procedure where neither subjects nor experimenters know the true purpose. I think double-blind is more about reducing experimenter bias. It might help with other aspects, but if the subjects don't know what's being studied, maybe they're less anxious. Wait, but evaluation apprehension is about being evaluated, not about knowing the purpose. So maybe this isn't directly addressing the issue.

Option H is conducting the experiment in a familiar environment. That does make sense because being in a comfortable setting might reduce anxiety. But does it eliminate evaluation apprehension? Maybe it reduces it, but perhaps not completely. Field experiments might be better because the natural setting could make subjects behave more normally without the pressure of knowing they're in a study.

So putting it all together, the best way to eliminate evaluation apprehension is to use field experiments where the subjects are in their natural environment and don't realize they're being observed. That way, they don't feel like they're being judged, so their behavior is more natural.

To eliminate evaluation apprehension in social psychological experimental settings, it is important to address the root cause: the anxiety individuals feel when they believe they are being evaluated. Among the options provided, the most effective approach is to use **field experimentation and nonobtrusive methods**. This approach involves conducting experiments in natural, real-world settings where participants are unaware they are being observed. By removing the awareness of being judged or evaluated, this method minimizes the pressure and anxiety associated with evaluation apprehension, allowing for more natural and authentic behavior.
