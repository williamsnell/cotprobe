Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about the dissociation of water into H+ and OH- ions. The reaction is H2O ⇌ H+ + OH^-. The question says that the equilibrium is disturbed, and the relaxation time for returning to equilibrium at 25°C is 37 microseconds. I need to calculate the rate coefficients for the forward and backward reactions. Hmm.

Wait, what's the relaxation time? I remember that relaxation time is related to the rates of the reactions. Oh right, for a reversible reaction, the relaxation time (τ) is the time it takes for the system to return to equilibrium after being disturbed. The formula for the relaxation time is τ = 1/(k1 + k2), where k1 is the forward rate coefficient and k2 is the backward rate coefficient.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because the reaction is H2O dissociating into H+ and OH-, the forward rate is k1 times the concentration of H2O. But since H2O is a pure liquid, its concentration is considered constant and incorporated into the rate coefficient. So the forward rate is just k1 for the production of H+ and OH-. The reverse reaction is the combination of H+ and OH- to form H2O, which would have a rate of k2 [H+][OH^-]. 

At equilibrium, the concentrations of H+ and OH- are both 1e-7 M at 25°C, right? So the equilibrium constant Kw is (1e-7)^2 = 1e-14. And Kw = k1/k2, so k1 = k2 * Kw.

Now, the relaxation time τ is given as 37 μs, which is 37e-6 seconds. The formula for τ is 1/(k1 + k2). So τ = 1/(k1 + k2) → k1 + k2 = 1/τ = 1/(37e-6) ≈ 27027 s^-1.

But since k1 = k2 * Kw, we can substitute that into the equation. So:

k2 * Kw + k2 = 1/τ → k2 (Kw + 1) = 1/τ.

Wait, Kw is 1e-14, so Kw + 1 is approximately 1.00000000000001, which is practically 1. So we can approximate k2 ≈ 1/τ → k2 ≈ 27027 s^-1.

Wait, no, wait. That can't be right because Kw is 1e-14, so when you add it to 1, it's nearly 1, but maybe I should calculate it correctly. Let's see. So the equation is:

k2 = (1/τ) / (1 + Kw) → 1/(37e-6 s) * 1/(1 + 1e-14) ≈ 27027 / 1 → k2 ≈ 27027 s^-1.

But wait, let me compute 1/τ: 1 / 37e-6 → 1 / 3.7e-5 is approximately 27027.027 s^-1.

But wait, the units. The reverse reaction rate k2 has units of M^-1 s^-1 if it's a second-order reaction. Wait, no, the reverse reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which is a bimolecular reaction, so rate is k2 [H+][OH-], so k2 has units of M^-1 s^-1. But wait, the forward reaction is first-order in H2O, which is treated as a constant, so the forward rate is k1, which has units of s^-1. Oh, wait, no, because for the forward reaction, if the rate is k1 [H2O], and since [H2O] is a constant (≈55.5 M), then k1 would have units of s^-1 because [H2O] is in M. So the forward rate is k1 (per second), and the reverse rate is k2 [H+][OH^-], so k2 has units of M^-1 s^-1.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula for τ is 1/(k1 + k2), but that can't be the case if their units are different. Oh, wait, I might have made a mistake there.

Let me rethink. For a reaction where the forward is first-order and the reverse is second-order, what is the correct expression for the relaxation time?

Alternatively, perhaps the approach should involve the rate equations. The rate of change of [H+] is d[H+]/dt = k1 [H2O] - k2 [H+][OH-]. But at equilibrium, [H+]=[OH-]=1e-7 M, so the net rate is zero: k1 [H2O] = k2 (1e-7)^2. Which gives Kw = k1 [H2O] / k2 = (k1 /k2) [H2O] = 1e-14. Wait, but earlier I thought Kw = k1/k2, but that's only if the forward rate is k1 [H2O] and reverse is k2 [H+][OH-].

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me denote the forward rate as k1 and the reverse rate as k2. The forward reaction is H2O → H+ + OH-, so rate_forward = k1 [H2O]. The reverse is H+ + OH- → H2O, rate_reverse = k2 [H+][OH^-]. At equilibrium, rate_forward = rate_reverse → k1 [H2O] = k2 [H+]^2. Since [H+] = [OH-] = sqrt(Kw) = 1e-7 M.

So, [H2O] is approximately 55.5 M. So, k1 * 55.5 = k2 * (1e-7)^2 → k1 = (k2 * 1e-14) / 55.5 → k1 ≈ (k2 * 1e-14) / 55.5.

Wait, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should express k1 in terms of k2. So, k1 = (k2 * Kw) / [H2O]. Since Kw is 1e-14 and [H2O] is about 55.5 M, then k1 = (k2 * 1e-14) / 55.5.

Now, the relaxation time τ is given by τ = 1 / (k1 + k2). Wait, but that would require that k1 and k2 have the same units. But k1 is per second (since rate_forward = k1 [H2O], [H2O] is in M, so k1 would be in (M/s) / M = 1/s). Similarly, the reverse rate is k2 [H+]^2, so unit of k2 is (M/s) / (M^2) )= M^-1 s^-1.

So yes, k1 is 1/s, and k2 is M^-1 s^-1. So when you add k1 and k2, their units are different, so you can't directly add them. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps my initial assumption about τ = 1/(k1 +k2) is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula for the relaxation time of such a reaction. Alternatively, think about the kinetics.

For a reaction A ⇌ B, the relaxation time is τ = 1/(k1 + k2). But in this case, the forward reaction is first-order (H2O → ions) and the reverse is second-order (ions → H2O). So perhaps the relaxation time is given by a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the general case. The relaxation time for a reversible reaction is given by τ = 1/(k1 + k2 [A][B]), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to set up the rate equation and linearize it around equilibrium.

Let me denote the concentrations of H+ and OH- as x. At equilibrium, x = 1e-7 M. If the system is disturbed, let the deviation from equilibrium be Δ, so [H+] = [OH-] = x + Δ. The rate of change of Δ is dΔ/dt = (rate_forward) - (rate_reverse).

Rate_forward is k1 [H2O] ≈ k1 * 55.5 (since [H2O] is ~55.5 M and taken as constant).

Rate_reverse is k2 [H+][OH-] = k2 (x + Δ)^2 ≈ k2 x^2 + 2 k2 x Δ, using the approximation that Δ is small.

At equilibrium, rate_forward = rate_reverse → k1 *55.5 = k2 x² → as before.

So the net rate is dΔ/dt = (k1 *55.5 - k2 (x + Δ)^2 )

But substituting k1 *55.5 = k2 x^2:

dΔ/dt ≈ k2 x^2 - k2 (x² + 2x Δ) = -2 k2 x Δ.

Wait, so dΔ/dt ≈ -2 k2 x Δ. That's a first-order differential equation. The solution would be Δ = Δ0 exp(-t/(τ)), where τ is the relaxation time, τ = 1/(2 k2 x).

So τ = 1/(2 k2 x). Because x is 1e-7 M.

So, τ = 1/(2 * k2 * 1e-7) → k2 = 1/(2 * τ * 1e-7).

Given that τ is 37e-6 seconds:

k2 = 1/(2 * 37e-6 s * 1e-7 M) → 1/(7.4e-13 M s) → approximately 1.35135e12 M^-1 s^-1.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, τ = 37e-6 s.

So, k2 = 1/(2 * τ * x) → x is 1e-7 M.

So 2 * τ * x = 2 * 37e-6 * 1e-7 = 74e-13 → 7.4e-12.

So 1/(7.4e-12) → approximately 1.35135e11 M^-1 s^-1.

Wait, that gives k2 ≈ 1.35e11 M^-1 s^-1.

Hmm, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option E: k1=2.5e-5 s^-1, k2=1.4e11 M^-1 s^-1.

Option G: k1=3.5e-5 s^-1, k2=1.2e11.

Option A: k2=2.5e-5 s^-1? No, wait, looking at the options:

Let me look:

Option E: k_1 = 2.5e-5 s^-1; k_2 = 1.4e11 M^-1 s^-1.

So if k2 is 1.35e11, then E's k2 is 1.4e11, which is close.

But wait, let's compute more accurately.

k2 = 1/(2 * τ * x) → τ = 37e-6 s, x=1e-7.

So 2 * 37e-6 * 1e-7 = 74e-13 = 7.4e-12.

So 1 / 7.4e-12 → approximately 1.35135e11. So the correct k2 is approximately 1.35e11 M^-1 s^-1.

Looking at the options, option E has k2=1.4e11, which is close. Option G has 1.2e11.

Now, what about k1? Since k1 = (k2 * Kw) / [H2O].

Kw is 1e-14. [H2O] is approximately 55.5 M.

So k1 = (1.35e11) * 1e-14 / 55.5 → (1.35e-3) / 55.5 → approximately 2.43e-5 s^-1.

Looking at the options, option E has k1 = 2.5e-5 s^-1, which is very close to 2.43e-5. So option E would have k1 =2.5e-5 and k2=1.4e11, which fits our calculations.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

k1 = (k2 * Kw) / [H2O] → (1.35e11 M^-1 s^-1) * (1e-14 M^2) ) / (55.5 M) → (1.35e-3 M) / 55.5 M → 1.35e-3 / 55.5 → 2.43e-5 s^-1.

Yes, that's correct.

So option E has k1=2.5e-5, which is very close. So the correct answer would be E. But let me check the other options for possible closer matches.

Looking at option F: k1=2.0e-5, k2=5.6e11. That k2 is much higher than our calculated 1.35e11.

Option G: k1=3.5e-5, k2=1.2e11. k1 is higher than our value.

Option A: k_1=1.4e11 M^-1 s^-1, which doesn't fit because k1 should be in s^-1.

Wait, no, option A has k_1 =1.4e11 M^-1 s^-1, which is for the reverse reaction (k2) perhaps? Because in our case, k2 is ~1.35e11 M^-1 s^-1.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option E says: k_1 = 2.5e-5 s^-1, k_2 =1.4e11 M^-1 s^-1. Which fits our calculation.

So the correct option is E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the dissociation of water, H₂O ⇌ H⁺ + OH⁻, where the equilibrium is disturbed. The relaxation time (τ) for the system to return to equilibrium is given as 37 μs (37 × 10⁻⁶ s). The goal is to calculate the rate coefficients for the forward (k₁) and backward (k₂) reactions.

### Key Equations and Relationships:
1. **Relaxation Time Formula**:  
   For a reversible reaction, the relaxation time is given by:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{1}{k_1 + k_2}
   \]  
   However, since the forward reaction is first-order (k₁) and the backward reaction is second-order (k₂), the correct formula for τ is:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{1}{2k_2x}
   \]  
   where \(x = [H^+] = [OH^-] = 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\) at equilibrium.

2. **Equilibrium Constant (Kₙ)**:  
   The equilibrium constant for water dissociation is:  
   \[
   K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = (10^{-7})^2 = 10^{-14}
   \]  
   At equilibrium, \(k_1 [H_2O] = k_2 [H^+][OH^-]\), which simplifies to:  
   \[
   k_1 = \frac{k_2 K_w}{[H_2O]}
   \]  
   where \([H_2O] \approx 55.5 \, \text{M}\).

### Calculations:
1. **Relaxation Time and \(k_2\)**:  
   Using \(\tau = \frac{1}{2k_2x}\), we solve for \(k_2\):  
   \[
   k_2 = \frac{1}{2 \tau x}
   \]  
   Substituting \(\tau = 37 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s}\) and \(x = 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\):  
   \[
   k_2 = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 37 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 10^{-7}} = \frac{1}{7.4 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 1.35 \times 10^{11} \, \text{M}^{-1} \text{s}^{-1}
   \]

2. **Forward Rate Coefficient (\(k_1\))**:  
   Using \(k_1 = \frac{k_2 K_w}{[H_2O]}\):  
   \[
   k_1 = \frac{(1.35 \times 10^{11}) \cdot 10^{-14}}{55.5} = \frac{1.35 \times 10^{-3}}{55.5} \approx 2.43 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{s}^{-1}
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
- **Option E**: \(k_1 = 2.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{s}^{-1}\), \(k_2 = 1.4 \times 10^{11} \, \text{M}^{-1} \text{s}^{-1}\)  
  This matches closely with the calculated values (\(k_1 \approx 2.43 \times 10^{-5}\), \(k_2 \approx 1.35 \times 10^{11}\)).

- **Other Options**:  
  - Option A: \(k_1 = 1.4 \times 10^{11} \, \text{M}^{-1} \text{s}^{-1}\) is incorrect because \(k_1\) should have units of \(\text{s}^{-1}\).  
  - Option G: \(k_1 = 3.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{s}^{-1}\), \(k_2 = 1.2 \times 10^{11} \, \text{M}^{-1} \text{s}^{-1}\) does not match the calculated values.  
  - Option F: \(k_1 = 2.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{s}^{-1}\), \(k_2 = 5.6 \times 10^{11} \,
