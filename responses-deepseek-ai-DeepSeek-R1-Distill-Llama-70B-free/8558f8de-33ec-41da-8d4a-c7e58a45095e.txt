Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the assessed valuation of taxable property for a city. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on tax calculations, but I'll try to break it down.

The problem says the tax budget is $2,455,335. The tax rate is made up of three parts: $0.52 per $100 for construction, $0.31 per $100 for general health and welfare, and $1.42 per $100 for education. Wait, wait—wait, the way it's written is a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, the tax rates are 52 dollars per 100, 31 dollars per 100, and 1.42 dollars per 100. Oh wait, that can't be right—that would be a really high tax rate. Wait, maybe I'm misreading the units. Because 52 dollars per 100 would mean 52% tax rate, which sounds high. Alternatively, maybe it's 52 cents, 31 cents, and 1.42 cents? No, the question probably means dollars, but let me make sure.

Wait, the tax rates are per $100, right? So each rate is per $100 of assessed value. So, for example, the construction tax is 52 dollars per 100 dollars of assessed value. So that would be 52% tax rate, which seems high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the rates are in cents, but the question says dollars. Hmm.

So the tax rates are:
- Construction: $0.52 per $100 (which is 0.52%)
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because $0.52 per $100 is 0.52%, right? Because 1% is $1 per $100. So 0.52 is 52 cents per $100, which is 0.52%. Similarly, 31 dollars per 100 would be 31%, which is a lot. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Because 31 dollars per 100 is 31%, but 0.31 dollars would be 0.31 per 100, which is 0.31%. But the problem says 31$ per 100, so that's 31 dollars per 100, which is 31%. Oh wait, that's a 31% tax rate. That seems high, but maybe that's how it is.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the terms. In the US, tax rates are often expressed in mills or as a percentage. For example, a tax rate of 1% would be $1 per $100 of assessed value. So if you have a property assessed at $100, you pay $1 in taxes.

So in this problem, the tax rate has three components:

1. Construction: 52 dollars per 100. So that's $52 per $100, which is 52% tax rate on the assessed value for construction. Wait, that's a huge tax rate. Similarly, 31 dollars per 100 is 31%, and 1.42 per 100 is 1.42%. That sums up to 52 + 31 + 1.42 = 84.42% total tax rate. That seems really high, but maybe that's correct for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax rates are in cents. So 52 cents per $100, which is 0.52%, and 31 cents per $100 is 0.31%, and 1.42 cents per $100 is 0.0142%. That would make the total tax rate 0.52 + 0.31 + 0.0142 = 0.8442%, which is 0.8442% total tax rate. But the way the question is written, it says 52$ per 100, which would be dollars, not cents. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the given numbers as they are.

So the total tax rate per $100 is 52 + 31 + 1.42 = 84.42 dollars per $100. But wait, that's 84.42%, which as a tax rate is extremely high, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, no, wait. Because each tax component is per $100, so perhaps the total tax rate is the sum of these. So the total tax per $100 is 52 + 31 + 1.42 = 84.42 dollars per $100. So the tax rate is 84.42% of the assessed value.

But the total tax collected is $2,455,335. So the assessed valuation (AV) is the total value of all taxable properties, and the tax is calculated as (tax rate) * (AV) / 100.

So let me think: the tax is computed as (52 + 31 + 1.42) dollars per 100. So total tax rate is 84.42 dollars per 100, which is 84.42%.

So the formula would be:

Tax = (Total Tax Rate) * (Assessed Valuation) / 100

We have the Tax as $2,455,335. So:

2,455,335 = (84.42) * (AV) / 100

Wait, no, because the tax rate is 84.42 dollars per 100, so that's 84.42 per 100, which is 0.8442 in terms of a decimal rate. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the tax rate is 84.42 dollars per 100 dollars of AV. So that's equivalent to 84.42%. So the tax would be AV * (84.42 / 100) = AV * 0.8442.

So 2,455,335 = AV * 0.8442

Therefore, AV = 2,455,335 / 0.8442

Wait, wait, let me compute that. Let me calculate 2,455,335 divided by 0.8442.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as:

AV = (Total Tax) * (100) / (Total Tax Rate)

Because tax rate is per 100, so:

AV = (2,455,335 * 100) / 84.42

Let me compute that.

So 2,455,335 * 100 = 245,533,500

Divide by 84.42.

So 245,533,500 / 84.42 = ?

Let me compute that.

Wait, let me approximate this. 84.42 times 2,900,000 is approximately 245 million.

Wait, 84.42 * 2,905,280 = ?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute 245,533,500 divided by 84.42.

Let me compute this step by step.

So 84.42 * x = 245,533,500

x = 245,533,500 / 84.42

Let me compute 245,533,500 ÷ 84.42.

Well, 84.42 times 2,900,000 is 245,178,000 (since 84.42 * 2,900,000 = 84.42 * 2.9e6 = 84.42*2.9=244.218, so 244.218e6 = 244,218,000. Wait, wait, no, 84.42 * 1,000,000 is 84,420,000. So 84.42 * 2,900,000 = 84.42 * 2.9e6 = 244,818,000.

Wait, 2,900,000 * 84.42 = ?

Let me compute 2,900,000 * 80 = 232,000,000

2,900,000 * 4.42 = ?

4.42 * 2,900,000 = Let's compute 4 * 2,900,000 = 11,600,000

0.42 * 2,900,000 = 1,218,000

So 11,600,000 + 1,218,000 = 12,818,000

So 80 + 4.42 = 84.42. So total is 232,000,000 + 12,818,000 = 244,818,000.

So 2,900,000 * 84.42 = 244,818,000.

But our numerator is 245,533,500.

So 245,533,500 - 244,818,000 = 715,500.

So 715,500 ÷ 84.42 per 1 is 715,500 / 84.42 ≈ 8,474. So approximately 2,900,000 + 8,474 ≈ 2,908,474.

Wait, wait, that's the AV? So around 2,908,474.

Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, the closest is option A: $245,533,500, which is 245 million. Wait, but wait, wait: 2,455,335 is about 2.45 million, and if the tax rate is 84.42%, then the AV would be much larger.

Wait, no, wait, no, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me re-express the tax calculation.

Each tax component is per $100 of AV. So the total tax is (sum of the rates) per $100.

So the total rate is 52 + 31 + 1.42 = 84.42 dollars per 100.

So the tax per $100 AV is 84.42 dollars.

So the formula is:

Tax = (AV / 100) * 84.42

So rearranged:

AV = (Tax * 100) / 84.42

So AV = (2,455,335 * 100) / 84.42

Which is 245,533,500 / 84.42 ≈ ?

Wait, 84.42 times 2,900,000 is 244,818,000. So 245,533,500 minus 244,818,000 is 715,500.

So 715,500 ÷ 84.42 is approx 8,474.

So total AV is 2,900,000 + 8,474 ≈ 2,908,474.

Wait, but 2,908,474 is $2,908,474, which is about 2.9 million. But looking at the options, the closest is option H: $1,091,260 or option J: $109,126,000. Wait, none of these match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to compute 245,533,500 ÷ 84.42.

Let me compute 84.42 × 2,908,474 = ?

Wait, maybe I can think of it as 84.42 × 2,908,474 = 245,533,500. But perhaps I should compute it as:

84.42 × 2,908,474 = ?

Wait, maybe I can use a calculator approach here, but since I can't, I'll estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check.

The total tax is the sum of each component. So for each $100 of AV, the tax is 52 + 31 + 1.42 = 84.42 dollars. So the tax rate is 84.42 per 100, which is 0.8442 as a decimal.

So the formula is:

Tax = AV × (Tax Rate)

So AV = Tax / (Tax Rate)

Wait, no, because the tax rate is per $100. So the tax rate is 84.42 per 100, which is 0.8442 in decimal.

So AV = Tax / (Tax Rate)

So AV = 2,455,335 / 0.8442 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

2,455,335 ÷ 0.8442 ≈ ?

Well, 0.8442 × 2,908,474 ≈ 2,455,335.

Wait, no, because 0.8442 × 2,908,474 would be 2,455,335. So AV is approximately $2,908,474.

Looking at the options, I don't see that number. The options are:

A: $245,533,500
B: $54,563,000
C: $2,455,335
D: $12,276,675
E: $4,500,000
F: $220,000,000
G: $5,000,000
H: $1,091,260
I: $2,250,000
J: $109,126,000

Hmm, none of these options match my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the tax rates.

Wait, perhaps the tax rates are in cents, not dollars. Because 52 cents per $100 is 0.52 dollars per $100, which is 0.52%. Let me recalculate with that assumption.

So, if the tax rates are in cents:

Construction: 0.52 dollars per 100 (52 cents)
General health: 0.31 dollars per 100 (31 cents)
Education: 0.0142 dollars per 100 (1.42 cents)

Wait, wait, no, that's not correct. 1.42 dollars per 100 would be 1.42%, which is high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant 52 cents per 100, which is 0.52 dollars per 100, which is 0.52%.

So total tax rate would be 0.52 + 0.31 + 0.0142 = 0.8442 dollars per 100, which is 0.8442%.

So the total tax is 2,455,335 = AV × (0.8442 / 100), because the tax rate is 0.8442 dollars per 100, which is 0.8442%.

Wait, no, wait: 0.52 dollars per 100 is 0.52%. Similarly, 0.31 is 0.31%, and 0.0142 is 0.0142%.

So total tax rate is 0.52 + 0.31 + 0.0142 = 0.8442%.

So tax is AV × 0.8442% = AV × 0.008442.

So AV = 2,455,335 / 0.008442 ≈ ?

Let me compute this.

2,455,335 ÷ 0.008442 ≈ ?

Calculate 2,455,335 ÷ 0.008442.

Well, 0.008442 is approximately 8.442e-3.

So 2,455,335 ÷ 0.008442 ≈ 2,455,335 ÷ 8.442e-3 ≈ 2,455,335 × (1/0.008442) ≈ 2,455,335 × 118.5 ≈ ?

Wait, 1/0.008442 is approximately 118.5.

So 2,455,335 × 118.5 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2,455,335 × 100 = 245,533,500

2,455,335 × 18.5 ≈ ?

2,455,335 × 10 = 24,553,350
2,455,335 × 8 = 19,642,680
2,455,335 × 0.5 = 1,227,667.5

So 24,553,350 + 19,642,680 = 44,196,030
Plus 1,227,667.5 ≈ 45,423,697.5

So total AV ≈ 245,533,500 + 45,423,697.5 ≈ 290,957,197.5, which is approximately $290,957,197.5.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: $245,533,500, but that's lower than my calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should go back. Maybe the tax rates are in dollars per $100, but as in 52 dollars per $100, which is 52%, not 0.52%.

So tax rate is 52 +31+1.42 = 84.42 dollars per $100, which is 84.42%.

So tax = AV × (84.42/100) = AV × 0.8442.

So AV = 2,455,335 / 0.8442 ≈ 2,908,474.

Wait, none of the options match that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each component is applied to the AV. So the total tax is (52 + 31 + 1.42) per $100. So total tax is 84.42 per $100, so the AV is (total tax) * (100 / 84.42).

So AV = (2,455,335 × 100) / 84.42 = 245,533,500 / 84.42 ≈ 2,908,474.

But the options given are much larger or smaller. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a decimal point. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem states the tax rate is comprised of 52$ per 100 for construction, 31$ per 100 for health, and 1.42$ per 100 for education. So yes, it's 52 dollars, 31 dollars, and 1.42 dollars per 100.

So the calculation seems correct, but the AV I'm getting is around 2.9 million, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, looking at the options, option J is $109,126,000. Let me see if that makes sense. Let me compute the tax on 109,126,000.

Tax = (52 +31+1.42) * (109,126,000 / 100) = 84.42 * 1,091,260.

Compute 84.42 × 1,091,260.

Wait, 1% of 1,091,260 is 10,912.6.

So 84.42% would be 84 × 10,912.6 + 0.42 × 10,912.6.

84 × 10,912.6 ≈ 917, 000 (wait, 10,912.6 ×80=873,  10,912.6 ×4=43,650.4 → total 873,000 + 43,650.4 = 916,650.4)

Plus 0.42 ×10,912.6 ≈ 4,583.7.

So total ≈ 916,650.4 + 4,583.7 ≈ 921,234.1. But the tax is
