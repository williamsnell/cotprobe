Okay, so I have this genetics question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about an X-linked recessive disorder in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The incidence in males is 1 in 100, and I need to find the expected incidence of affected homozygous females.

Wait, I remember that for X-linked recessive disorders, males are more frequently affected than females because they have only one X chromosome. Females would need both X's to have the recessive allele to show the trait, right?

So, the incidence in males is given as 1 in 100. Since males have only one X, their allele frequency for the recessive allele (let's say it's 'a') would be equal to the incidence. So, the frequency of 'a' in males is 1/100. Wait, actually, the frequency of the X chromosome with the recessive allele in the population is q, and for males, the incidence is q because each male has one X. So q equals 1/100.

Now, for females to be affected, they need to be homozygous recessive, meaning both X's have the 'a' allele. The frequency of affected females would be q squared, q². Because in a population, the frequency of homozygous recessive (aa) is q².

So let me calculate that. q is 1/100, so q² is (1/100) * (1/100) = 1/10,000. So the incidence in females would be 1 in 10,000.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, no, no. Wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. Because in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, for X-linked traits, the allele frequencies are the same for males and females, but the expression differs because males have only one X.

Wait, so the frequency of the recessive allele in the population is q. For males, the chance of having the disease is q because they have only one X. For females, the chance is q^2, because both X's need the allele. So yes, if males have 1/100 incidence, q=0.01, so q squared is 0.0001, which is 1 in 10,000.

Looking at the options, option A is 1 in 10,000. So that should be the answer.

Wait, am I missing something here? Let me think again. Oh, wait, sometimes I get confused about whether the incidence in males is q or something else, but no, X-linked recessive in males is q because they have only one X. So yes, q is 0.01, so q^2 is (0.01)^2=0.0001, which is 1 in 10,000.

So the correct answer should be A: 1 in 10,000.

To determine the expected incidence of affected homozygous females for an X-linked recessive disorder in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we start by noting that the incidence in males is given as 1 in 100. For X-linked recessive traits, males are hemizygous (having only one X chromosome), so their incidence directly reflects the frequency of the recessive allele (\(q\)) in the population. Thus, \(q = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01\).

For females, who have two X chromosomes, the probability of being homozygous recessive (affected) is \(q^2\). Substituting \(q = 0.01\), we calculate:

\[
q^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001
\]

This corresponds to an incidence of 1 in 10,000. Among the provided options, the correct answer is:

**A: 1 in 10,000.**
