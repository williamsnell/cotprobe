Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem about hemophilia. Let me think through it step by step.

Hemophilia is a recessive sex-linked disorder, which means the gene responsible for it is on the X chromosome. Since it's recessive, a person needs two copies of the defective gene to show the disease. But wait, for males, it's different because they have only one X chromosome. So if a male gets the defective X, he'll have hemophilia since he doesn't have another X to mask it.

The problem says a phenotypically normal couple had a son with hemophilia. Hmm, so the son has hemophilia. Let's break down the parents' genotypes.

The father's genotype: Since he's normal and doesn't have hemophilia, his X must be normal. Fathers pass their X chromosome to daughters and Y to sons. So the father's X is normal, so his genotype is XY, where the X doesn't have the hemophilia gene.

The mother's genotype: She's normal but she must carry the recessive gene because the son has hemophilia. Since the son gets his X from the mother, she must have given him the X with the hemophilia gene. But wait, she's phenotypically normal, so she can't have two copies of the recessive gene. Therefore, her genotype must be a carrier, meaning she has one normal X and one with the hemophilia gene. So her genotype is XHXh, where XH is the normal allele and Xh is the recessive one.

So the mother is XHXh and the father is XHY (since he has a Y chromosome). Wait, no, the father would be XY, with his X being normal. So the father's X is XH, and Y has no corresponding allele for this gene.

Now, the couple has a son with hemophilia. So the son must have received the Xh from the mother because the father gives Y. So the son's genotype is XhY, making him have hemophilia.

The question is, what is the probability that their next child, if a girl, would also have hemophilia.

Wait, if the next child is a girl, she gets an X from each parent. The father can only give his X (XH), and the mother can give either XH or Xh.

So the possible X chromosomes the mother can pass are:

- XH (50% chance)
- Xh (50% chance)

So the daughter would get X from father (XH) and X from mother. So possible combinations:

1. XH (father) and XH (mother): XHXH. Phenotypically normal, not a carrier.
2. XH (father) and Xh (mother): XHXh. Carrier, but phenotypically normal.

Wait, but in this problem, the daughter would have hemophilia only if she gets two Xh alleles. But wait, hemophilia is recessive, so females need two copies to have the disease. Because the daughter gets XH from the father, she can only have XH from the mother to have XHXH (normal) or XH from father and Xh from mother, making her a carrier (XHXh), which doesn't have the disease.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, no: the daughter must get X from father and X from mother. The father gives only XH. The mother gives XH or Xh. So the daughter can't get two Xh alleles because the father only contributes XH. So the daughter can't have hemophilia. Because hemophilia in females would require both X chromosomes to have the h allele. But since the father can only give XH, the daughter would have XH from him and possibly Xh from the mother, making her a carrier (XHXh), not affected.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, in the scenario, the mother is XHXh. So when she has a daughter, each daughter has a 50% chance of getting the XH or Xh from the mother. But the father gives his XH. So the daughter's genotype would be XH (from dad) and either XH or Xh (from mom).

So the daughter's X chromosomes would be:

- XH from dad, XH from mom → XHXH → Not a carrier, not affected.
- XH from dad, Xh from mom → XHXh → Carrier, but not affected.

So in neither case does the daughter have hemophilia. Because she would need two copies of Xh. But she can't get two Xh alleles because the father only gives XH.

Wait, but wait the question says the son has hemophilia. So the mother must have given him Xh. But the mother is XHXh, so she can pass either XH or Xh. So the son is Xh (from mom) and Y (from dad), so XhY, which has hemophilia.

So for the daughter, she can't get Xh from the father. So the daughter can only have XH from the father. So the daughter can have XH and XH (normal) or XH and Xh (carrier), but never Xh and Xh, which is needed for hemophilia.

Therefore, the probability that the next child, if a girl, would have hemophilia is zero. So the correct answer is G: No chance.

Hemophilia is a recessive sex-linked disorder, meaning the gene responsible for it is located on the X chromosome. Males, having only one X chromosome, will express the disorder if they inherit the defective allele, while females must inherit two defective alleles (one from each parent) to exhibit the condition.

In this scenario, the couple is phenotypically normal, but their son has hemophilia. This indicates the following genotypes:

- **Father**: Since he is normal and does not have hemophilia, his genotype must be **XHY** (where **XH** represents the normal X chromosome and **Y** is the male sex chromosome).
- **Mother**: She is phenotypically normal but must carry the recessive allele because the son has hemophilia. Therefore, her genotype is **XHXh** (where **XH** is the normal allele and **Xh** is the recessive allele).

When the couple has a daughter, the daughter inherits one X chromosome from each parent. The father can only pass his **XH** chromosome, while the mother has a 50% chance of passing either **XH** or **Xh**. Thus, the possible genotypes for the daughter are:

1. **XHXH** (50% chance): The daughter inherits **XH** from both parents, making her phenotypically normal and not a carrier.
2. **XHXh** (50% chance): The daughter inherits **XH** from the father and **Xh** from the mother, making her a carrier but still phenotypically normal.

For a daughter to have hemophilia, she would need to inherit two defective **Xh** alleles (one from each parent). However, since the father can only pass a normal **XH** chromosome, the daughter cannot inherit two **Xh** alleles. Therefore, the probability that the next child, if a girl, would have hemophilia is **0%**.
