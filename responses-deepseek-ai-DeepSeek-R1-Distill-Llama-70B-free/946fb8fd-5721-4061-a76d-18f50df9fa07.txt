Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about determining the root-mean-square (rms) values of displacement, velocity, and acceleration for a damped forced harmonic oscillator operating at steady state. The options are A through J, each with different expressions.

Hmm, I remember that in harmonic motion, especially simple harmonic motion (SHM), the displacement, velocity, and acceleration are related in specific ways. But wait, this is a damped forced oscillator, but I think in steady state, the behavior is still harmonic, so the same relationships might apply.

So first, I need to recall what the rms values mean. RMS is the square root of the mean of the square of the quantity. For sinusoidal functions, like in SHM, there's a standard relationship between the peak value and the rms value. 

For example, for displacement x(t) = x_max * sin(ωt + φ), the rms displacement would be x_rms = x_max / sqrt(2). Because the average of sin squared over a full cycle is 1/2, so the rms is sqrt(1/2) times the amplitude.

Similarly, velocity in SHM is v(t) = dx/dt = ω x_max cos(ωt + φ). So the rms velocity would be v_rms = ω x_max / sqrt(2).

Acceleration a(t) is the derivative of velocity, so a(t) = -ω² x_max sin(ωt + φ). The rms acceleration would then be a_rms = ω² x_max / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, some of them have these expressions. Let's check each part.

Looking at option A: x_rms = x_max / sqrt(2), v_rms = (ω x_max)/sqrt(2), a_rms = (ω² x_max)/sqrt(2). That matches what I just thought.

Option B has x_rms as ω² x_max / sqrt(2), which doesn't fit. Option C has x_rms as ω x_max/sqrt(2), which isn't right. Option D's x_rms is x_max/3, which doesn't match. Option J has all rms values except acceleration as x_max/sqrt(2), but acceleration there is ω² x_max/sqrt(2), which matches, but the velocity in J is x_max/sqrt(2), which doesn't fit.

Wait, no, option A has all three correctly. Let me double-check.

Wait, what's the velocity in SHM? Velocity is ω times displacement, but when you take rms, it's (ω x_rms), but wait, the maximum velocity is ω x_max. So the rms velocity would be (ω x_max)/sqrt(2). Similarly, acceleration's maximum is ω² x_max, so rms is (ω² x_max)/sqrt(2).

So yes, option A seems correct. Let me scan the other options to be sure.

Option H: x_rms is 2x_max/sqrt(2), which is sqrt(2)*x_max, which is too big. No, that's not right.

Option J has velocity rms as x_max/sqrt(2), which misses the ω factor. So no.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the root-mean-square (rms) values of displacement, velocity, and acceleration for a damped forced harmonic oscillator operating at steady state, we start by recalling the relationships between these quantities in harmonic motion. For a sinusoidal function, the rms value is related to the peak value by a factor of \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

1. **Displacement**: The displacement in simple harmonic motion is given by \( x(t) = x_{\text{max}} \sin(\omega t + \phi) \). The rms displacement is:
   \[
   x_{\text{rms}} = \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

2. **Velocity**: The velocity is the time derivative of displacement, \( v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = \omega x_{\text{max}} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \). The rms velocity is:
   \[
   v_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

3. **Acceleration**: The acceleration is the time derivative of velocity, \( a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = -\omega^2 x_{\text{max}} \sin(\omega t + \phi) \). The rms acceleration is:
   \[
   a_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega^2 x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

Now, comparing these results with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( x_{\text{rms}} = \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}}, v_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}}, a_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\omega^2 x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \). This matches the derived expressions.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as \( x_{\text{rms}} \) is given as \( \frac{\omega^2 x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \), which is not consistent with the derived result.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as \( x_{\text{rms}} \) is given as \( \frac{\omega x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \), which is not correct.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as \( x_{\text{rms}} \) is given as \( \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{3} \), which does not match the derived result.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as \( x_{\text{rms}} \) is given as \( \frac{\omega x_{\text{max}}}{3} \), which is not correct.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as \( x_{\text{rms}} \) is given as \( \frac{\omega^2 x_{\text{max}}}{2} \), which does not match the derived result.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as \( x_{\text{rms}} \) is given as \( \frac{\omega x_{\text{max}}}{2} \), which is not correct.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as \( x_{\text{rms}} \) is given as \( \frac{2 x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \), which is too large.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as \( x_{\text{rms}} \) is given as \( \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{2} \), which does not match the derived result.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as \( v_{\text{rms}} \) is given as \( \frac{x_{\text{max}}}{\sqrt{2}} \), which is missing the \( \omega \) factor.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately reflects the derived rms values for displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
