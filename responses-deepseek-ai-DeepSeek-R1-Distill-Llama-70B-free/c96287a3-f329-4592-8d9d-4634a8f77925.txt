The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What differences emerged with regard to theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic?

Options:

A: From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. The question of what should or what should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security.
B: The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.
C: The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.
D: Theorizing has parallel theoretical forms of knowledge based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the differences in security theorizing between the US and Europe. Hmm, I remember that in my international relations class, we talked about different schools of thought. I think the US and Europe have some differing approaches when it comes to security studies.

Wait, the question is asking what differences emerged regarding theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic. So I need to look at the options and see which one correctly identifies these differences.

Option A says that from a US perspective, the main voice of security is external, and there's a focus on what should count as security issues. I'm not too sure about this. I think the US might focus more on traditional security like military and state-based issues, while Europe might consider non-traditional aspects like environmental or economic security. But I'm not certain if this is exactly what A is saying.

Option B mentions the European school being based on hegemonic knowledge, understanding causal mechanisms related to material. I'm not entirely clear on this. I thought the European approach, maybe the Copenhagen School, is more about securitization theory, which looks at how issues become security issues through speech acts. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option C talks about different forms of knowledge relating to policy relationships. It says the US has a problem-solving tradition, while Europe does critical studies. That rings a bell. The US tends to focus on practical solutions and policy relevance, aiming to make the system work better. In contrast, European scholars might be more critical, questioning the underlying structures and power dynamics. So this seems plausible.

Option D says theorizing has parallel forms based on empirical cause-and-effect. I'm not sure about this one. It sounds like both sides might use similar empirical methods, but the question is about differences, not similarities.

So putting it together, I think the main difference is that the US approach is more about problem-solving, providing practical solutions, while the European approach is more critically oriented, looking at the broader structures and power relations. So Option C seems correct.

The question asks about the differences in security theorizing between the US and Europe. The correct answer is based on understanding the distinct approaches each region takes. The US tends to focus on problem-solving and policy relevance, aiming to address security issues within the existing system. In contrast, Europe often adopts a more critical approach, examining underlying structures and power dynamics. 

Option C correctly captures this distinction, highlighting the problem-solving tradition in the US versus the critical studies in Europe.

Answer: C
