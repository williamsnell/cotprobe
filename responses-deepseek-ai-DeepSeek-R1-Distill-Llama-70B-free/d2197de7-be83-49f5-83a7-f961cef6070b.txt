Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Stevenson's views on moral disagreements. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think this through.

I remember that Stevenson was a philosopher who worked on ethics, specifically on emotivism. Emotivists believe that moral statements are expressions of emotion rather than objective truths. So when people disagree morally, it's not about facts but about attitudes or feelings.

The question is asking what Stevenson said moral disagreements involve. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different kind of disagreement. Let's go through them:

A: Disagreement in principles. That sounds more like something related to rules or codes people follow. Maybe more of a deontological view.

B: Disagreement in understanding. That would be about comprehension, but I don't think Stevenson focused on that.

C: Disagreement in experience. That's about personal experiences. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

D: Disagreement in practice. Practices are actions, so maybe behavior, but again, not directly about the moral judgment.

E: Disagreement in interest. Interests are what people want, but that's more like a utilitarian perspective, perhaps.

F: Disagreement in theory. That's about abstract ideas, but I'm not sure.

G: Disagreement in attitude. Oh wait, attitudes are related to emotions and perspectives. Since Stevenson was an emotivist, this might fit because moral disagreements would be about differing emotions or attitudes.

H: Disagreement in perception. Perception is how you see the world, but again, maybe not the core of his argument.

I: Disagreement in belief. Beliefs are cognitive, but emotivism is more about emotions than beliefs.

J: Disagreement in values. Values are closeâ€”values are what people hold dear. But I think Stevenson would tie it more to attitudes, which encompass feelings and dispositions.

Wait, but sometimes 'values' and 'attitudes' can be similar. Did Stevenson specifically talk about values or attitudes? I think he focused on attitudes because emotivism is about expressing attitudes. So when people morally disagree, they're expressing different attitudes towards something.

So the answer should be G: disagreement in attitude.

Stevenson, an emotivist, argued that moral statements express emotions or attitudes rather than objective facts. Therefore, moral disagreements stem from differing attitudes. 

Answer: G
