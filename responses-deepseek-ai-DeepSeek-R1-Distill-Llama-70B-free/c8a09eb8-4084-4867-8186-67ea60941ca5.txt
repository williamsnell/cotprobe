Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, Paul owes $56.30 plus a 3% sales tax. Then there are these terms: (2/10), (n/30). Hmm, I remember those terms relate to payment discounts. I think the first part is a discount if he pays within a certain number of days, and the second part is the net days he has to pay otherwise.

Wait, right, the terms (2/10), (n/30) mean that if Paul pays within 10 days, he gets a 2% discount. If he doesn't pay within 10 days, he has to pay the full amount within 30 days without the discount. So the question says he paid one week after the agreement. One week is 7 days, which is less than 10, so he qualifies for the 2% discount.

First, I need to calculate the total amount Paul owes before any discounts. That's the $56.30 plus 3% sales tax. Let me compute the sales tax first. 3% of $56.30 is... let's see, 0.03 times 56.30. 0.03 * 50 is 1.50, and 0.03 * 6.30 is 0.189. So adding those together, 1.50 + 0.189 is $1.689. So the total amount before discount is 56.30 + 1.689, which is $57.989. Wait, that's approximately $57.99, but let me be precise here. 56.30 + 1.689 is 57.989, which I can round to 57.99 for now.

Now, since Paul is paying within 10 days, he gets a 2% discount on the total amount. So I need to calculate 2% of $57.989 and subtract that from the total. 2% is 0.02, so 57.989 * 0.02. Let's calculate that. 57.98 * 0.02 is 1.1596. So the discount is approximately $1.16. Subtracting that from $57.989 gives me 57.989 - 1.16 = $56.829.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate the sales tax. 56.30 * 0.03. Well, 56 * 0.03 is 1.68, and 0.30 * 0.03 is 0.009, so total is 1.68 + 0.009 = 1.689. So yes, the total before discount is 56.30 + 1.689 = 57.989. Then the discount is 2% of 57.989, which is 1.15978, approximately 1.16. So subtracting that gives 57.989 - 1.16 = 56.829. So the amount Paul paid is approximately $56.83.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $56.83. Let me check the options again. The options are A: $57.99, B: $60.35, C: $58.65, D: $59.50, E: $57.50, F: $56.86, G: $54.00, H: $58.12, I: $55.65, J: $55.17.

Hmm, the closest to 56.83 is F: $56.86. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again step by step.

First, calculate the sales tax: 56.30 * 0.03. Let's compute 56.30 * 3%:

56.30 * 3 = 168.90, so moving the decimal two places gives 1.689.

So total amount before discount: 56.30 + 1.689 = 57.989.

Now, the discount is 2% of 57.989. So 57.989 * 0.02 = 1.15978.

Subtracting that gives 57.989 - 1.15978 = 56.82922, which is approximately $56.83.

But in the options, F is $56.86, which is close but not exact. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe the sales tax is applied differently. Oh, wait, perhaps the discount is applied after adding the sales tax. Let me think again. The total is $56.30 plus tax. So 56.30 * 1.03 equals the total with tax. Then apply the 2% discount.

Wait, let me compute it that way to check. 56.30 * 1.03 = ?

56.30 * 1 = 56.30

56.30 * 0.03 = 1.689

So 56.30 + 1.689 = 57.989.

Then, 57.989 with a 2% discount: 57.989 * 0.98.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the discount is 2%, so 57.989 * (1 - 0.02) = 57.989 * 0.98.

Let me compute that. 57.989 * 0.98.

I can compute this as 57.989 - (57.989 * 0.02).

Which is 57.989 - 1.15978 = 56.82922, same as before.

So approximately $56.83, but the closest option is F: $56.86. Hmm, that's different. Did I compute it correctly?

Wait, perhaps I should do the multiplication more accurately. Let me compute 57.989 * 0.98.

57.989 * 0.98:

Calculate 57.989 * 98 = ?

Wait, 57.989 * 98 is the same as (57.989 * 100) - (57.989 * 2).

57.989 * 100 = 5798.9

57.989 * 2 = 115.978

So 5798.9 - 115.978 = 5682.922

Wait, that can't be right because 57.989 * 98 would be in the thousands, but wait, no, 57.989 is a dollar amount, so 57.989 * 98 is 5682.922 cents? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the decimal places.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. 57.989 is dollars, so 57.989 * 0.98 is 56.82922.

So when I calculate 57.989 * 0.98, it's 56.82922. So that's $56.83 approximately.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. F is $56.86, which is 56.86. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the discount differently. Let me try another approach: compute the total with tax, then apply the discount.

So total with tax: 56.30 * 1.03 = 57.989.

Discount: 2% of 57.989 = 1.15978.

So total after discount: 57.989 - 1.15978 = 56.82922, which is approximately 56.83.

Wait, but maybe the question expects rounding to the nearest cent. So 56.82922 would be $56.83.

But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait another thought: Maybe the discount is applied on the original amount before tax? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the terms are on the total owed. No, the discount is applied after adding the tax.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is applied to the pre-tax amount. Let me see: If that's the case, discount on $56.30, then add tax on the discounted amount.

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let me try that approach.

If the discount is applied before tax, then:

Discount amount: 56.30 * 0.02 = 1.126.

So discounted price: 56.30 - 1.126 = 55.174.

Then add 3% tax on this discounted price: 55.174 * 1.03.

Compute 55.174 * 1.03.

55.174 + (55.174 * 0.03) = 55.174 + 1.65522 = 56.82922. So same result.

So either way, the total is approximately $56.83.

But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option F is $56.86, which is a bit higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, perhaps I should compute 56.30 * 1.03 * 0.98.

Let me compute 56.30 * 1.03 first. 56.30 * 1.03 = 56.30 + (56.30 * 0.03) = 56.30 + 1.689 = 57.989.

Then multiply by 0.98: 57.989 * 0.98.

Let me compute 57.989 * 0.98:

57.989 * 0.98 = ?

Well, 57.989 * 0.98 = 57.989 - (57.989 * 0.02) = 57.989 - 1.15978 = 56.82922.

So again, same result.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the terms. Wait, the terms are (2/10), (n/30). So 2% discount if paid in 10 days, otherwise, net in 30 days. Paul paid in 7 days, so he gets the discount.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to round to the nearest cent correctly. 56.82922 would be 56.83 when rounded to the nearest cent. But the options don't have that. So maybe the correct option isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the tax first, then apply the discount. Let me try that again.

Tax: 56.30 * 0.03 = 1.689. So total with tax: 56.30 + 1.689 = 57.989.

Discount: 57.989 * 0.02 = 1.15978.

Total after discount: 57.989 - 1.15978 = 56.82922, which is $56.83.

Looking at the options, F is $56.86. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in multiplication.

Wait, let me compute 57.989 * 0.98 using another method.

0.98 is the same as 98%, so 57.989 * 98%.

Compute 57.989 * 98 = ?

Wait, 57.989 * 98 = (57.989 * 100) - (57.989 * 2) = 5798.9 - 115.978 = 5682.922.

Wait, but 57.989 is dollars, so 57.989 * 0.98 is 56.82922, as before.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to not round the sales tax to the nearest cent and carry more decimals. Let me try that.

Compute sales tax as 56.30 * 0.03 = 1.689 exactly.

Then total is 56.30 + 1.689 = 57.989.

Then discount is 57.989 * 0.02 = 1.15978.

Subtracting gives 57.989 - 1.15978 = 56.82922.

If we round this to the nearest cent, it's $56.83. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is F: $56.86. But why?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial tax calculation. Let me compute 56.30 * 0.03 again.

56.30 * 0.03: 0.3 * 0.03 is 0.009, 56 * 0.03 is 1.68. So total is 1.68 + 0.009 = 1.689. Correct.

So total is 57.989. Then 2% discount: 1.15978. Subtracting, 56.82922.

Wait, maybe the question uses different rounding rules, like rounding up at each step. Let's see:

If we round the tax to the nearest cent: 1.689 is approximately $1.69, so total becomes 56.30 + 1.69 = 57.99.

Then 2% discount on 57.99: 57.99 * 0.02 = 1.1598, which is $1.16.

So total after discount: 57.99 - 1.16 = 56.83.

Still, same result. But the options don't have 56.83.

Alternatively, maybe the discount is applied before tax. Wait, that would change things.

If discount is applied first: 56.30 * 0.98 = let's compute that.

56.30 * 0.98: 56.30 - (56.30 * 0.02) = 56.30 - 1.126 = 55.174.

Then add 3% tax: 55.174 * 1.03.

Compute 55.174 * 1.03:

55.174 + (55.174 * 0.03) = 55.174 + 1.65522 = 56.82922.

Same result again.

Wait, so all approaches lead to $56.83, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again, option F is $56.86. That's 56.86. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total differently. Let me compute the total amount as:

Total = 56.30 * 1.03 * 0.98.

Which is the same as 56.30 * (1.03 * 0.98).

1.03 * 0.98 = (1 + 0.03)(1 - 0.02) = 1 + 0.03 - 0.02 - 0.0006 = 1.00 - 0.0006 = 0.9994.

So 56.30 * 0.9994 = ?

Compute 56.30 * 0.9994.

56.30 * 1 = 56.30

Minus 56.30 * 0.0006 = 0.03378.

So 56.30 - 0.03378 = 56.26622.

Wait, that's different. Wait, that can't be right because 0.9994 is less than 1, so the result should be slightly less than 56.30, but that's not matching previous calculations.

Wait, no, wait. 1.03 * 0.98 is 1.03 - (1.03 * 0.02) = 1.03 - 0.0206 = 1.0094. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute 1.03 * 0.98 properly.

1.03 * 0.98:

Compute 1 * 0.98 = 0.98.

0.03 * 0.98 = 0.0294.

Add them together: 0.98 + 0.0294 = 1.0094.

So 1.03 * 0.98 = 1.0094.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So then, the total would be 56.30 * 1.0094.

Wait, that would be higher, which doesn't make sense because the discount should lower the price.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The total amount owed is 56.30 plus 3% tax. Then, if paid within 10 days, a 2% discount is applied. So the correct order is to apply the tax first, then the discount. So:

Total after tax = 56.30 * 1.03 = 57.989.

Then, discount: 57.989 * 0.98 = 56.82922.

So that's correct, and the answer should be approximately $56.83.

Wait, but option F is $56.86. Hmm, maybe the question expects the discount to be applied on the pre-tax amount. Let me try that.

Discount on 56.30: 56.30 * 0.02 = 1.126.

So discounted price: 56.30 - 1.126 = 55.174.

Then add 3% tax on this discounted amount: 55.174 * 1.03 = 55.174 + 1.65522 = 56.82922.

Same result. So I'm back to $56.83.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a step. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the discount is applied after adding tax, but the calculation is done with more precise decimals. Let me compute the tax as 56.30 * 1.03 = 57.989.

Then, 57.989 * 0.98 = ?

Let me compute 57.989 * 0.98.

57.989 * 0.98:

Compute 57.989 * 98 = 57.989 * (100 - 2) = 57.989*100 - 57.989*2 = 5798.9 - 115.978 = 5682.922.

But 57.989 is in dollars, so 57.989 * 0.98 = 56.82922.

So that's $56.83.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But looking back, the options given don't include $56.83. The closest is F: $56.86.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup. Let me read the question again.

"Paul owed $56.30 plus a 3% sales tax to a sporting goods store. The terms were (2/10), (n/30). If Paul paid one week after the agreement, how much did he pay?"

So, the terms are 2% discount if paid within 10 days, net in 30 days. He paid in 7 days, so he gets the discount. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total differently. Let me try using fractions.

56.30
