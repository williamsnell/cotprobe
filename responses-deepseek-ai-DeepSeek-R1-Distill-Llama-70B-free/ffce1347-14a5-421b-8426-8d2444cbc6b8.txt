Question:

A farmer purchased a new pickup truck from a local automobile dealership. A few weeks later, the farmer was using the truck to haul a load of supplies to his farm. As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.
B: Yes, if the manufacturing company had issued a recall for the defect.
C: No, if the farmer was speeding and therefore could not stop in time.
D: Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.
E: No, if the pedestrian was crossing the street illegally.
F: No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.
G: Yes, if the auto dealer was aware of the defect but did not inform the farmer.
H: No, because the farmer should have had the truck inspected before using it for heavy duty work.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically negligence. Let me try to break it down. 

The situation is a farmer bought a new pickup truck from a dealership. Later, the brakes failed because of a manufacturing defect, and the truck hit a pedestrian. Now, the pedestrian is suing the dealership for negligence.

I remember that negligence requires four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. The dealership, as a seller, would have a duty to provide a product that's safe for its intended use. But wait, the truck had a manufacturing defect. So if the dealership sold it without knowing about the defect, are they liable?

I think about the concept of strict liability. Usually, manufacturers are strictly liable for defects, but sometimes sellers can be too, especially if they're in the business of selling such products. But the question is about negligence, not strict liability.

In negligence, the plaintiff must show that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care. So did the dealership do anything wrong here? If the defect was manufacturing, and the dealership didn't know or have reason to know about it, then maybe they didn't breach any duty. Dealerships typically rely on manufacturers for safety, right? Unless they had some reason to suspect the brakes were faulty, like if there was a recall or previous issues.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because the pedestrian wasn't a purchaser or user. Wait, but in negligence, the duty is to anyone foreseeable who could be harmed. So being a third party isn't necessarily a bar. So A might not be correct.

B: Yes, if there was a recall. If the manufacturer issued a recall, the dealership should know, so their failure to inform or fix would be a breach. That makes sense because they had a duty to inform customers about known defects.

C: No, if the farmer was speeding. That relates to the farmer's negligence, but if the dealership is also negligent, both could be at fault. This is about the dealership's liability, not the farmer's actions. So C might not be the right reason to deny liability.

D: Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care. So if the dealership should have found it, then they breached their duty. But if the defect was not discoverable without specialized knowledge, maybe they're not liable. I'm not sure if dealerships are expected to test every vehicle's brakes. Usually, they rely on the manufacturer's quality control.

E: No, if pedestrian was jaywalking. That's a defense, but contributory negligence varies by state. Some states bar recovery if the plaintiff was even slightly at fault. But if the pedestrian was illegally crossing, that's a factor, but not sure if it directly affects the dealership's negligence.

F: No, if the farmer was negligent in steering. Again, that's about the farmer's actions, not the dealership's. Unless the dealership's action contributed, but the question is about the dealership's liability.

G: Yes, if the dealer knew but didn't inform. That's a clear breach of duty. If they knew and didn't tell the farmer, yes, they're liable.

H: No, because farmer should have inspected. That's shifting the blame to the farmer. But the dealership's duty is separate. If they sold a defective product, their responsibility isn't negated by the farmer's failure to inspect.

The question states that the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect, and it's conclusively proven. So the issue is whether the dealership could have known or should have known.

In strict liability, the seller can be liable even without fault, but under negligence, the dealership needs to have been at fault. If the defect couldn't have been discovered with reasonable care, then the dealership didn't breach their duty. So option D says yes if it could have been discovered, which would mean the dealership failed to inspect. 

But wait, is the dealership required to inspect every vehicle? I think dealerships generally don't have a duty to test every vehicle's components. They rely on the manufacturer. So unless there's a recall or some notice, the dealership might not be negligent. So if the defect was latent and couldn't have been found with reasonable care, then no breach.

Looking back, the question says the defect was a manufacturing defect, but it doesn't say the dealership knew or should have known. So if the defect couldn't have been discovered through reasonable care, then the dealership didn't breach any duty, so pedestrian can't prevail. But the options don't directly say that.

Wait, let me read the options again. Option D says yes if the defect could have been discovered. So if it's possible, then the dealership should have found it, making them negligent. If not, then they aren't.

But in reality, dealerships don't usually inspect every part. So if the defect was something they couldn't have reasonably found, then the answer would be no. But the question doesn't specify, so it's about whether the defect was discoverable.

In the given scenario, if it's proven that the defect was manufacturing, but the dealership didn't know or have reason to know, then they didn't breach their duty. So the pedestrian wouldn't prevail unless the dealership had a reason to know.

Looking at the options, option D says yes if it could have been discovered. So in that case, if the defect was discoverable with reasonable care, then the dealership is liable. Otherwise, not.

Wait, but the truck was new. Dealerships usually don't test every function unless there's a reason to. So unless the brakes showed obvious signs, they might not have known.

So the answer would depend on whether the defect was discoverable. Since the question doesn't specify that, but the options are given, I think the correct answer hinges on whether the dealership could have known.

If the defect couldn't have been discovered, then the pedestrian doesn't win. If it could have been, then yes.

Looking back, the question is, "will the pedestrian prevail?" So under what condition would the pedestrian win.

If the defect was discoverable through reasonable care, then yes (option D). If not, then no.

But the question doesn't give any information about whether the defect was discoverable, so the answer must assume that the dealership had a duty to discover it. However, in reality, dealers don't usually test every aspect unless there's a reason.

So perhaps the correct answer is D: Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care by the dealer.

Alternatively, another approach: the dealership's duty is to provide a safe product. If they sold a defective product, but had no reason to know, then they didn't breach their duty. So the pedestrian can't establish breach unless the dealer should have known.

So if the defect was discoverable, then yes, the pedestrian wins. Otherwise, no.

But in the question, it's given that the defect is a manufacturing defect, but not whether it was known. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but another angle: the farmer is the purchaser, and the pedestrian is a foreseeable third party. So the dealership could still be liable under strict liability, but the question is about negligence.

Wait, the question is about a negligence claim, not strict liability. So the dealership would only be liable if they were negligent, i.e., failed to exercise reasonable care.

If the defect was not discoverable, then they weren't negligent. If it was, then yes.

So the answer would be D.

But wait, let me think again. The options are:

A: No, because pedestrian wasn't purchaser or user. But in negligence, duty is to foreseeable plaintiffs, which includes pedestrians. So A is incorrect.

B: Yes, if there's a recall. If the manufacturer issued a recall, the dealer should have known and informed the farmer. So B is a possible yes.

D: Yes, if defect could have been discovered. So either B or D could be correct.

But the question says it's proven the defect was manufacturing. So whether the dealer knew or could have known is key.

But in the case of a recall, the dealer would be on notice. So B would make the pedestrian win.

But the question doesn't mention a recall. So the correct answer must be D or G.

Wait, option G says yes if the dealer was aware but didn't inform. So if they knew, that's a breach.

But the question doesn't say the dealer knew. So if the defect couldn't have been discovered without reasonable care, then the dealer isn't liable. Otherwise, they are.

So, considering all this, the correct answer is D: Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care by the auto dealer.

The question revolves around whether the pedestrian can prevail in a negligence claim against the auto dealership. To establish negligence, the pedestrian must prove that the dealership had a duty, breached that duty, and that the breach caused the harm. The dealership, as a seller, has a duty to provide a safe product, but under negligence, liability depends on whether the dealership failed to exercise reasonable care.

Key points to consider:

1. **Duty and Foreseeability**: The dealership's duty extends to foreseeable plaintiffs, including pedestrians, even if they are not the direct purchaser or user of the product. Thus, option A is incorrect because the pedestrian's status as a third party does not bar the claim.

2. **Breach of Duty**: The dealership's breach depends on whether it could have discovered the defect through the exercise of reasonable care. Dealerships typically rely on manufacturers for product safety, but if the defect was discoverable with reasonable inspection or due diligence, the dealership may be found negligent for failing to detect it. Option D aligns with this reasoning.

3. **Knowledge of the Defect**: If the dealership knew or should have known about the defect (e.g., through a recall, as in option B), it would clearly be negligent for failing to inform the farmer. However, the question does not specify whether a recall existed or whether the dealership had actual knowledge of the defect.

4. ** Farmer's Actions**: Options C, E, F, and H focus on the farmer's or pedestrian's actions, which are irrelevant to the dealership's liability. The question is about the dealership's negligence, not the farmer's or pedestrian's conduct.

5. **Strict Liability vs. Negligence**: While strict liability could apply to the manufacturer, the question specifically addresses negligence. Therefore, the dealership's liability hinges on whether it failed to exercise reasonable care in discovering the defect.

Given the facts, the pedestrian will prevail if the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care by the dealership. This makes option D the correct answer.

ANSWER: D
