Question:

Police officers had probable cause to believe that a man had committed a series of armed bank robberies with an accomplice. The officers obtained a valid arrest warrant for the man and went to his house to arrest him. The officers found the front door ajar and could hear a radio playing inside. They knocked on the door, identified themselves as police officers, and stated that they had a warrant. Getting no response, the officers entered the house. After the officers called the man's name several times and again identified themselves as police officers, the man emerged from the basement and was arrested. The officers went into the basement to look for the accomplice. They opened a closet door and found cocaine in plain view. They did not find the accomplice. The man was indicted for cocaine possession. He has moved to suppress the cocaine as evidence on the ground that it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?

Options:

A: No, because the officers discovered the cocaine during a lawful protective sweep of the house looking for the man's accomplice.
B: Yes, because the man was not given a chance to surrender before the officers entered the house.
C: Yes, because the officers did not find the accomplice in the house.
D: No, because the officers had a valid arrest warrant for the man.
E: Yes, because the officers entered the house without permission.
F: Yes, because the officers did not have probable cause to believe that cocaine would be in the closet.
G: No, because the search was incident to the man's arrest.
H: No, because the officers had probable cause to believe that the man was involved in criminal activity.
I: No, because the cocaine was in plain view when the officers opened the closet.
J: Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a Fourth Amendment issue in a criminal procedure context. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the scenario is that police officers have probable cause to believe a man committed several armed bank robberies with an accomplice. They obtained a valid arrest warrant for him and went to his house to arrest him. The front door was ajar, and they could hear a radio inside. They knocked, identified themselves, stated they had a warrant, but got no response. So they entered the house. After calling his name and identifying themselves again, the man came out of the basement and was arrested. Then, the officers went into the basement to look for the accomplice. They opened a closet door and found cocaine in plain view. No accomplice was found. The man was indicted for cocaine possession and is moving to suppress the evidence, claiming it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

The question is whether the court should grant the motion to suppress.

I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. So the key here is whether the officers' actions were constitutional.

First, the officers had a valid arrest warrant. That means they had the authority to arrest the man. When they arrived, the door was ajar, which might imply that they could enter without forcing it, but I'm not sure if that's the case. They knocked, announced themselves, had a warrant, but got no response. So they entered.

Wait, but what's the rule for entering a home with an arrest warrant? I think that under Payton v. New York, police can't just automatically enter a home to make an arrest. They need an arrest warrant and, if they're going to enter a home, they must have exigent circumstances or consent. But here, the warrant was for the man's arrest, so maybe they could enter without a separate search warrant. Also, the fact that the door was ajar might count as exigent circumstances, or maybe they could argue that they were allowed to enter because they had a valid warrant and the man was inside.

But wait, in this case, they knocked and announced, which is part of the Payton requirements. Since they had a valid arrest warrant, they were allowed to enter the home to arrest the man. So their entry into the house was lawful.

Now, after arresting the man, they went into the basement to look for the accomplice. Is that a valid protective sweep? I remember that a protective sweep is allowed under Maryland v. Buie. It's a limited search of the premises for officer safety, looking for other dangerous people. But for a protective sweep, the officers must have a reasonable belief that there are other dangerous people present.

In this case, the officers were looking for an accomplice, which they had probable cause to believe existed because they knew the man had an accomplice in the robberies. So that might give them the reasonable belief needed to conduct a protective sweep. So going into the basement could be part of that.

When they opened the closet door and found cocaine in plain view, that's a plain view seizure. For something to be admissible under the plain view doctrine, three things must be true: (1) the officer was lawfully present at the place where the evidence was found, (2) the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent, and (3) the officer had a lawful right of access to the object itself (i.e., could legally be where the object was).

Here, the officers were lawfully in the basement during a protective sweep after a valid arrest, so condition one is met. The cocaine was in plain view, so condition two is probably met. And they opened the closet, which they were allowed to do during the protective sweep, so condition three is met. Therefore, the seizure of the cocaine was lawful.

Wait, but what about the protective sweep? The protective sweep is supposed to be limited to areas immediately adjoining where the arrest occurs and places where someone might be hiding to ambush the police. So, for example, in the case where the arrest happens in the living room, the police can sweep the kitchen and dining room but maybe not the entire house unless there's a reason to believe someone else is there.

But in this case, the arrest happened upstairs, and then the officers went into the basement. If the basement is a separate area, maybe they can still check it, especially since they were looking for an accomplice. So I think the protective sweep would cover the basement.

Wait another thing: when they entered the house, the man didn't respond, so they went in. Then they called his name, he came out, and was arrested. So at that point, he was under arrest, and they were looking for the accomplice, which justified the protective sweep. So the search of the closet in the basement would be part of that sweep.

But another angle: some might argue that once the suspect is arrested and secured, the need for a protective sweep diminishes. However, in this case, the officers were still looking for another person, the accomplice, so the protective sweep would still be justified because they had reason to believe another person was present who might pose a danger.

So, considering all that, the seizure of the cocaine was proper, so the court should not grant the motion to suppress.

Looking at the options:

Option A: No, because they were doing a lawful protective sweep looking for the accomplice. That sounds right.

Option B: Yes, because the man wasn't given a chance to surrender. But they did knock and announce, and he didn't respond, so entering was lawful. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Yes, because they didn't find the accomplice. But the fact that they didn't find him doesn't negate the reasonable belief at the time, so C is wrong.

Option D: No, because they had a valid arrest warrant. While the arrest warrant is valid, the issue is the search for the cocaine, so D is not the reason.

Option E: Yes, because they entered without permission. But they had a warrant and followed proper procedure, so E is wrong.

Option F: Yes, because no probable cause for cocaine in the closet. But under plain view, they don't need probable cause; they just need to be lawfully present, so F is wrong.

Option G: No, because the search was incident to arrest. But a search incident to arrest (Chimel) allows searching the arrestee and the area within his reach. Here, the search was in the basement, which is beyond the arrestee's reach after he was arrested, so G might not apply. So G is incorrect.

Option H: No, because they had probable cause. But the issue is the search, not the arrest, so H is not the right reason.

Option I: No, because the cocaine was in plain view. That's correct because plain view doctrine applies, making the seizure lawful. So I is a possible answer.

Option J: Yes, because no search warrant. But they were conducting a protective sweep, which doesn't require a separate search warrant, so J is wrong.

So the correct answers would be either A or I.

Wait, the question is about whether the court should suppress the evidence. So if the officers were lawfully present in the basement during a protective sweep, and the cocaine was in plain view, then both A and I would be correct reasons to deny suppression.

Looking back at the options, A says it's because of a lawful protective sweep. I says because it was in plain view.

In the scenario, the protective sweep allowed them to be in the basement, and then the plain view allowed them to seize the cocaine. So both A and I are correct. But the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, but which option is the best fit. The seizure is proper under plain view, which would make I correct. Alternatively, the protective sweep allowed them to be there, so A is correct.

So which is the primary reason? The fact that they were lawfully present in the basement during a protective sweep (A) allows them to find the cocaine, which was in plain view (I). So both factors are present, but the options don't combine them.

Looking at the options, the question is about the basis for denying suppression. So the correct reasoning would involve both the protective sweep and plain view.

But since the options are separate, I think the best answer would be A because they were conducting a lawful protective sweep, which allows them to be in the area where they found the cocaine. Without the protective sweep, they wouldn't have been there. So the primary reason is the lawful protective sweep.

Alternatively, the plain view makes the seizure lawful, so I is also a correct reason.

Wait, but the question is whether the court should grant the motion to suppress. So the man is arguing that the search was unconstitutional, and the state would argue that the seizure was lawful.

In this case, the seizure would be lawful under the plain view doctrine, which is a separate exception. So perhaps option I is the better answer.

Alternatively, the protective sweep is a separate doctrine, and the plain view applies because they were lawfully present.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Under the protective sweep, the officers can look into the closet. When they open it, they see the cocaine in plain view, so that's a lawful seizure. So the fact that it was in plain view is the reason, making option I correct.

But another point: when conducting a protective sweep, the officers can only look in places where an accomplice might be hiding. Opening a closet is allowed, and if they see contraband in plain view, they can seize it.

So I think both A and I are correct, but looking at the options, A and I are separate. So which one is the better answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, because the protective sweep is the reason they were in the basement, and the plain view is a given once they're there.

Wait, but the options are separate. So the question is, which reason justifies admitting the evidence.

Option A says it's a lawful protective sweep. Option I says it's plain view.

So both are correct, but perhaps the answer is A, because without the protective sweep, they wouldn't have been there. But if the court finds that the protective sweep was lawful, then the plain view seizure is also lawful.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe I is the better answer because the seizure is under plain view, which is a separate doctrine.

Wait, let me think about the order of events. The officers were in the basement looking for the accomplice, which is a protective sweep. During that, they opened the closet and found the cocaine. So the fact that they were in the basement lawfully (protective sweep) allowed them to be in a position to see the cocaine in plain view.

So the seizure would be lawful under both doctrines. But the question is, which option is the reason the court should not suppress.

Looking again at the options, I think the answer is A because the protective sweep allows the officers to be there, and thus the plain view applies. So the primary reason is the protective sweep.

Alternatively, if the court finds that the protective sweep was unlawful, then the plain view wouldn't save it. So the critical factor is whether the protective sweep was lawful.

In this case, the officers had a valid arrest warrant, and they were looking for an accomplice, which gave them the reasonable belief that another person might be present. So the protective sweep was lawful, making option A correct.

So I think the answer is A.

The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. In this case, the officers had a valid arrest warrant for the man, which allowed them to enter his home under Payton v. New York, as they knocked, announced themselves, and had exigent circumstances (the ajar door and the need to arrest him). Once inside, they lawfully arrested the man, and their subsequent search of the basement was justified as a protective sweep under Maryland v. Buie. A protective sweep is permissible if officers have a reasonable belief that another dangerous person, such as an accomplice, might be present. Here, the officers had probable cause to believe the man had an accomplice, making the protective sweep lawful.

During the protective sweep, the officers opened a closet and found cocaine in plain view. The plain view doctrine applies because: (1) the officers were lawfully present in the basement, (2) the incriminating nature of the cocaine was immediately apparent, and (3) the officers had lawful access to the closet. Thus, the seizure of the cocaine was constitutional.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The officers conducted a lawful protective sweep, which allowed them to be in the basement and find the cocaine in plain view.  
- **B**: Incorrect. The man was given a chance to surrender when the officers knocked, announced themselves, and called his name.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The failure to find the accomplice does not negate the reasonable belief that justified the protective sweep.  
- **D**: Incorrect. While the arrest warrant was valid, the issue is the subsequent search and seizure, not the arrest itself.  
- **E**: Incorrect. The officers lawfully entered the home with a valid warrant and exigent circumstances.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Probable cause for the cocaine is not required under the plain view doctrine.  
- **G**: Incorrect. A search incident to arrest (Chimel) does not apply here because the basement was beyond the man's reach after his arrest.  
- **H**: Incorrect. The issue is the search, not the arrest, so this reasoning is irrelevant.  
- **I**: Correct. The cocaine was in plain view, making its seizure lawful. However, the primary reason the officers were in the basement was the protective sweep.  
- **J**: Incorrect. A search warrant was not required for the protective sweep or the plain view seizure.

Both **A** and **I** are valid reasons, but **A** is the better answer because the protective sweep was the basis for the officers' lawful presence in the basement, which led to the plain view seizure. Without the protective sweep, the plain view doctrine would not apply. 

ANSWER: A
