Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the capital/output ratio when switching from annual to quarterly output. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says the capital/output ratio for annual output is 2. And they're asking what it is for quarterly output. I remember that the capital/output ratio is basically the amount of capital required to produce one unit of output. So, if it's 2 for the whole year, that means for each unit of output produced every year, you need 2 units of capital.

Wait, but the question is about quarterly output. So, how does that change things? Let me break it down. If the annual output is, say, Q, then the capital required is 2Q. But the output is produced over a year, which is four quarters. So if we're looking at quarterly output, each quarter's output would be Q/4.

But wait, the capital is used to produce the entire annual output. So the capital is fixed for the year, right? Or does the capital change when considering shorter periods? Hmm. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Oh, wait! The capital/output ratio is the same regardless of the time period because it's a ratio. Or is it? No, wait, perhaps when you're considering a different time frame, like quarterly instead of annually, the output is a fraction of the annual. So the ratio would adjust based on how output is measured.

Let me think again. The capital/output ratio (K/Y) is calculated as capital (K) divided by output (Y). If Y is annual, then K/Y is 2. But if Y is quarterly, then Y would be a quarter of the annual output. So the quarterly output Y' is Y/4.

So K remains the same, because capital doesn't change just because we're measuring output over a quarter. So the new ratio K/Y' would be K divided by (Y/4), which is (K/Y) * 4. Since K/Y is 2, the new ratio would be 2 *4=8.

Wait, that can't be right because 8 is one of the options (option J). But wait, I thought the ratio for quarterly would be lower, but according to this, it's higher.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach: the capital-output ratio is how much capital is needed per unit of output. If the annual ratio is 2, that means for each dollar of output per year, you need 2 dollars of capital. Now, if you look at a quarter, which is a fourth of a year, the output per quarter would be a quarter of the annual output. So the same capital supports a quarter of that output each quarter. So the capital per quarterly output unit would be 2 * 4 =8. Oh, that makes sense.

Wait, but another way to think about it: if the annual output is Y, then K=2Y. For quarterly, each quarter's output is Y/4. So the capital per quarterly output would be K/(Y/4) = (2Y) / (Y/4) )= 2Y *4/Y =8. So yes, the ratio becomes 8.

Looking at the options, option J is 8. So the answer must be J.
</think>

The capital/output ratio is calculated as capital divided by output. If the annual output is denoted as \( Y \), the capital \( K \) is \( 2Y \) since the ratio is 2 for annual output. When considering quarterly output, the output per quarter becomes \( Y/4 \). The capital remains the same, so the new ratio becomes:

\[
\text{Capital/Output Ratio for Quarterly Output} = \frac{K}{Y/4} = \frac{2Y}{Y/4} = 2 \times 4 = 8.
\]

Thus, the capital/output ratio for quarterly output is 8.

Answer: J
