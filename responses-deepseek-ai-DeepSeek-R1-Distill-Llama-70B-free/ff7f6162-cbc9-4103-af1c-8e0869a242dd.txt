Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about a salesman's income. The company is the Yearly Almanac Co., and their salesmen get a commission and a salary. The setup is that they receive a 10% commission on all sales above $2,500, and they also get a salary of $300 per month. The task is to find out what the salesman's income would be if his total sales in one month were $5,070.20.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to break down the components of his income. There's the base salary, which is straightforward, and then the commission, which only applies to the amount he sells over a certain threshold.

Let me jot down the numbers:

- Salary per month: $300
- Commission rate: 10% on sales above $2,500
- Total sales: $5,070.20

So the total income is the sum of the base salary and the commission earned. The commission is calculated on the amount by which the sales exceed $2,500.

Wait, right. So first, I need to find out how much he sold over $2,500. Let me calculate that.

Total sales = $5,070.20

Subtract the threshold: 5,070.20 - 2,500 = ?

Let me do that subtraction. 5,070 minus 2,500 is 2,570.20. So he sold $2,570.20 above the threshold.

Now, the commission is 10% of that amount. So I need to calculate 10% of $2,570.20.

Calculating that: 0.10 * 2,570.20 = ?

Let me compute that. 2,570.20 * 0.10 is 257.02.

So the commission is $257.02.

Now, add that to his base salary: $300 + $257.02 = ?

300 + 257 is 557, and then add the 0.02 cents, so 557.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option H is $557.02. So that's probably the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Total sales: 5070.20

Minus 2500: 5070.20 - 2500 = 2570.20

10% of 2570.20: 257.02

Then 300 + 257.02 = 557.02.

That seems correct. So the answer should be option H.

The salesman's income is calculated by adding his base salary and the commission earned on sales exceeding $2,500. 

1. **Base Salary**: $300 per month.
2. **Sales Above Threshold**: $5,070.20 - $2,500 = $2,570.20.
3. **Commission**: 10% of $2,570.20 = $257.02.
4. **Total Income**: $300 (salary) + $257.02 (commission) = $557.02.

The correct answer is option H: $557.02.
