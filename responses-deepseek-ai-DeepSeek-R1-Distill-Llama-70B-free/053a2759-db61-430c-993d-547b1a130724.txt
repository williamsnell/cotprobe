Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and protons in a magnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the ratio of the equilibrium polarizations, |pe/pH|. The setup is that both an electron and a proton are placed in a 1.0 T magnetic field at 300 K. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, what's equilibrium polarization in this context? Oh right, when a particle is placed in a magnetic field, it can become polarized, meaning its magnetic moments align with the field. At equilibrium, the thermal motions tend to randomize the alignment, but the magnetic field encourages alignment. So the polarization depends on the balance between these two effects.

I remember that the polarization is related to the magnetic moment of the particles. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = γ * ħ/2, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the magnetization or the expectation value of the magnetic moment.

Wait, maybe the polarization here refers to the expectation value of the magnetic moment along the field direction. So the equilibrium polarization for each particle would be proportional to its magnetic moment and dependent on temperature and the magnetic field.

I think the formula for the polarization (or the expectation value of the magnetic moment) is given by the Langevin function or something similar. But wait, for small values of μB/(kT), where μ is the magnetic moment, B the magnetic field, k Boltzmann constant, and T temperature, the polarization can be approximated as pe ≈ μ_e * (μ_e B)/(3 k T), because the Taylor expansion of the Langevin function starts as L(x) ≈ x/3 for small x.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The magnetization M is given by the number of particles per unit volume times the average magnetic moment. For a single particle, the average magnetic moment is μ_avg = μ * (μ B)/(3 k T). So for each particle, the polarization (which I think here is the average magnetic moment) would be proportional to μ^2 * B / (3 k T).

So for electron and proton, we have their respective magnetic moments. The electron's magnetic moment μ_e is about -μ_B (Bohr magneton), and the proton's μ_p is about μ_N (nuclear magneton). The Bohr magneton is much larger than the nuclear magneton.

Wait, what's the exact value? Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T, and the nuclear magneton μ_N is about 5.05e-27 J/T. So μ_B is much larger than μ_N.

So the polarization for each particle would be proportional to μ². So the ratio |pe/pH| would be (μ_e^2 / μ_p^2) multiplied by some other factors.

Wait, but wait, the other factors like B and T would be the same for both particles since they're in the same magnetic field and temperature. So the ratio would just depend on the square of the ratio of their magnetic moments.

So let's compute μ_e over μ_p. Since μ_e is about μ_B = 9.27e-24 J/T, and μ_p is μ_N ≈ 5.05e-27 J/T.

μ_e / μ_p = (9.27e-24) / (5.05e-27) ≈ let me calculate that. 9.27 /5.05 is roughly 1.83. Then 1e-24 / 1e-27 is 1e3. So 1.83e3 ≈ 1830. So μ_e is about 1830 times larger than μ_p.

Then the ratio (μ_e/μ_p)^2 is (1830)^2 = let's see, 1800 squared is 3.24e6, so 183^2 is 33489, so 1830^2 is 3.3489e6. So the ratio of the squares is about 3,348,900.

Wait, but that's the square of the magnetic moments. So the polarizations pe and pH are proportional to μ_e² and μ_p², respectively. So their ratio would be (μ_e^2)/(μ_p^2) = (1830)^2 ≈ 3.3489e6. But looking at the options, the highest option is G:1640. So none of the options are near a million, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a second, maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Because the polarization might not be proportional to μ². Let me think again. The average magnetic moment is given by the Brillouin function or the Langevin function. For electrons and protons, which have spin 1/2, the Brillouin function simplifies.

Wait, for spin 1/2 particles, the average magnetic moment is μ_avg = (μ) * tanh(μ B / (k T)), where μ is the magnetic moment of the particle. But if the argument μ B/(k T) is small, which it probably is for typical lab conditions, then tanh(x) ≈ x. So μ_avg ≈ μ^2 B / (3 k T). So the polarization would be proportional to μ².

Wait, but in that case, the ratio would be (μ_e^2) / (μ_p^2). So that's (μ_e/μ_p)^2.

Wait, so earlier I thought that μ_e is about 1830 times μ_p. So the square would be about 3.3 million, which isn't among the options. So I must have gone wrong somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the polarization being proportional to μ² is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the ratio of the polarizations as |pe/pH|, which could involve other factors.

Wait, what if the polarization is proportional to μ times the magnetogyric ratio (gyromagnetic ratio) or something else? Let me think about the definition of polarization in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the polarization is given by the product of the magnetic moment and the susceptibility. And the susceptibility for a paramagnetic substance is given by χ = (n μ²)/(3 k T), where n is the number of particles. So the magnetization M = χ B. So for each particle, the magnetization per particle would be μ² B/(3 k T). So that would make the polarization (per particle) proportional to μ².

So yeah, I'm back to the same place. So the ratio would be (μ_e^2)/(μ_p^2) which is (μ_e/μ_p)^2.

Wait, but let's compute μ_e and μ_p more accurately.

The Bohr magneton μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

The nuclear magneton μ_N = (eħ)/(2m_p) ≈ 5.0508e-27 J/T.

So μ_e/μ_p = (μ_B)/(μ_N) = (m_p)/(m_e) * (eħ)/(2m_e) * (2m_p)/(eħ) )? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, μ_B = (eħ)/(2 m_e), μ_N = (eħ)/(2 m_p).

So μ_B / μ_N = (m_p)/(m_e) ≈ 1836. So that's about 1.836e3.

So (μ_e/μ_p)^2 = (1836)^2 ≈ 3.37e6.

But the options don't go that high. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of the equilibrium polarizations not as (pe/pH) = (μ_e²)/(μ_p²), but perhaps it's the inverse? Or perhaps I have the ratio inverted.

Wait no, because the question asks for |pe/pH|, which would be (μ_e²)/(μ_p^2), which is a huge number, but none of the options are like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm forgetting that the electron and proton have opposite charges, so their magnetic moments are in opposite directions, but the ratio's magnitude is still the same.

Wait another thought: maybe it's not about the magnetic moments but about the gyromagnetic ratios. Because the gyromagnetic ratio γ is defined as μ = γ S, where S is the spin angular momentum. For the electron, γ_e = (e/(2m_e)), and for the proton, γ_p = (e/(2m_p)) * (g_p/2), but wait, the g-factor for the proton is about 5.586, so perhaps that affects it.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the g-factor is relevant here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the polarization is given by P = (γ^2 ħ^2 B)/(6 k T). Because the energy of a magnetic dipole in a field is U = -μ·B, and μ = γ S, so U = -γ S · B. For spin-1/2, S = ħ/2 √3, but perhaps that's getting complicated.

Wait, the partition function Z for a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field would be Z = e^{γ B ħ / (2 k T)} + e^{- γ B ħ / (2 k T)}.

The average magnetic moment would be (d/dβ)(ln Z), where β = 1/(k T). So let me compute that.

Average μ = (1/Z) * (e^{x} * (γ ħ/2) + e^{-x} * (-γ ħ/2)), where x= (γ B ħ)/(2 k T).

So μ_avg = [ (e^{x} - e^{-x}) / (e^{x} + e^{-x}) ) ] * (γ ħ / 2) ) * (1/2) [because when taking derivative, perhaps I missed a factor]

Wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully.

The average energy U_avg is given by the derivative of ln Z with respect to beta (β =1/(k T)), but perhaps it's easier to compute the average magnetic moment.

Alternatively, the expectation value of the magnetic moment operator μ_z is given by:

μ_z = (1/2) γ ħ tanh( (γ ħ B) / (2 k T) )

So for small x, where x = (γ ħ B) / (2 k T), tanh(x) ≈ x. So μ_z ≈ (1/2 γ ħ) * (γ ħ B) / (2 k T) )

Which simplifies to μ_z ≈ (γ^2 ħ^2 B) / (8 k T) * 1/2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the factors wrong.

Wait, let me compute the expectation value step by step.

The partition function Z for a two-state system (spin up and down) is Z = e^{β γ ħ B/2} + e^{- β γ ħ B/2}, where β = 1/(k T).

The average value of the magnetic moment in the z-direction is:

μ_z = (1/Z) [ (γ ħ/2) e^{β γ ħ B/2} + (-γ ħ/2) e^{-β γ ħ B/2} ]

So,

μ_z = (γ ħ/2) [e^{x} - e^{-x}]/[e^{x} + e^{-x} ] where x = (γ ħ B)/(2 k T)

Which can be written as (γ ħ/2) * tanh(x)

Now, for small x, tanh(x) ≈ x - x^3/3 + ... So for x << 1, tanh(x) ≈ x.

So,

μ_z ≈ (γ ħ/2) * ( γ ħ B )/(2 k T )

Simplify:

μ_z ≈ (γ^2 ħ^2 B )/(4 k T) * (1/2) ?

Wait, let's compute it correctly.

(γ ħ/2) * ( γ ħ B/(2 k T) ) ) = (γ^2 ħ^2 B) / (4 k T) ) * (1/2? I'm getting confused here. Let me compute the factors:

(γ ħ/2 ) * (γ ħ B/(2 k T) ) ) = γ*ħ/(2) * γ ħ B/(2 k T) )

So that's (γ^2 ħ^2 B) ) / (4 k T)

So, μ_z ≈ (γ^2 ħ^2 B )/(4 k T )

Wait, but in this approximation, the average magnetic moment is proportional to γ².

Thus, the polarizations for electron and proton would be proportional to γ_e^2 and γ_p^2, respectively.

So the ratio |pe/pH| would be (γ_e / γ_p )^2.

So what's γ for electron and proton?

The gyromagnetic ratio γ is given by γ = g * (q)/(2m), where g is the g-factor, q is the charge, and m is the mass.

For the electron, g ≈ -2 (approximately), so γ_e = (-e)(g_e)/(2 m_e). But since we're taking the magnitude, it's e * 2/(2 m_e) ) → e/(m_e).

Similarly, for the proton, g_p ≈ 5.586, so γ_p = (e)(g_p)/(2 m_p).

So, γ_e = (e * 2 )/(2 m_e ) ) = e/m_e.

γ_p = (e * g_p )/(2 m_p )

So the ratio γ_e / γ_p = (e/m_e ) / ( (e g_p)/(2 m_p) ) ) = (e/m_e) * (2 m_p)/(e g_p ) ) = (2 m_p )/( m_e g_p )

Plugging in the numbers:

m_p ≈ 1.67e-27 kg

m_e ≈ 9.11e-31 kg

g_p ≈ 5.586

So,

γ_e / γ_p = (2 * 1.67e-27 ) / (9.11e-31 * 5.586 )

Let me compute denominator and numerator.

Numerator: 2 *1.67e-27 = 3.34e-27 kg

Denominator: 9.11e-31 kg *5.586 ≈ 9.11e-31 *5 ≈4.555e-30, but more accurately:

9.11e-31 *5.586 = let's compute 9.11 *5.586 first.

9.11 *5 =45.55, 9.11*.586 ≈5.34. So total ≈45.55 +5.34 =50.89 → 50.89e-31 kg.

Wait, 9.11e-31 *5.586 = (9.11 *5.586 )e-31 → 50.89e-31 =5.089e-30.

So denominator is 5.089e-30.

So γ_e/γ_p = 3.34e-27 / 5.089e-30 = approx (3.34/5.089 )e3 → 0.656 * 1e3 → ≈656.

Wait, 3.34 /5.089 is approximately 0.656.

So 0.656e3 is 656. So γ_e / γ_p ≈656.

So the ratio of the polarizations is (γ_e/γ_p)^2 ≈ (656)^2.

Wait, 656 squared is 430,336. But none of the options are that high. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, but wait, the options include 658, option C. Hmm, that's very close to 656. So maybe considering more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I approximated too roughly. Let me recalculate.

Compute γ_e / γ_p again more accurately.

γ_e = e/(m_e) → approx 1.76e11 T^-1 s^-1 (I think that's the actual value for γ_e).

Wait, I remember that γ_e is approximately 2.8e10 rad·s⁻¹·T⁻¹? Or maybe I'm mixing units. Alternatively, I think the electron gyromagnetic ratio γ_e is about 1.76e11 T^-1 s^-1. Looking at the options, option D says |γe|=1.761e11 T^-1 s^-1, so that's probably the value we need to use for γ_e.

Similarly, the proton's γ_p is about 4.2576e6 T^-1 s^-1.

So, γ_e = 1.76e11, γ_p=4.2576e6.

Thus, γ_e/γ_p = (1.76e11 )/(4.2576e6 ) → approx 4.13e4.

Wait, no, wait 1.76e11 /4.2576e6 = (1.76 /4.2576 )e5.

1.76 /4.2576 ≈0.413.

So 0.413e5 →4.13e4.

So the ratio (γ_e/γ_p )^2 is (4.13e4 )^2 = approx 1.7e9, which is way higher than any option.

Hmm, this is confusing. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe the polarization is not proportional to γ², but to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the polarization is given by the magnetic susceptibility, which is proportional to the square of the magnetic moment. And the magnetic moment is μ = γ ħ/2 for spin 1/2 particles.

So μ_e = γ_e ħ/2, μ_p = γ_p ħ/2.

Then the ratio (μ_e/μ_p ) = (γ_e/γ_p )

So μ_e/μ_p = (1.76e11 )/(4.2576e6 ) ≈41300.

So (μ_e/μ_p )^2 is about 1.7e9, which again doesn't match any options.

Wait another approach: maybe it's the ratio of the magnetic moments squared times the ratio of their gyromagnetic ratios. Or perhaps the question is about the magnetization per particle, which would involve the number of particles, but the question is about the ratio for a single electron and proton.

Wait, perhaps the equilibrium polarization is given by the product of the magnetic moment and the gyromagnetic ratio. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the formula for polarization in terms of magnetization.

The magnetization M is given by M = n (μ_avg ), where n is the number of particles per unit
