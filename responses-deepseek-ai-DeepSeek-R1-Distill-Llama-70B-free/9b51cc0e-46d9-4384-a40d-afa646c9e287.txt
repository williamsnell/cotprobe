Question:

A debtor owed a creditor $12,000 under a promissory note. Under the applicable statute of limitations, a suit to collect on the promissory note had to have been filed by September 30 of last year. On June 1 of this year, the creditor received a letter from the debtor stating, "I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you. " However, the debtor failed to make the payment on July 1. If, on August 1, the creditor brings suit against the debtor and the debtor asserts the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and refuses to pay the creditor anything, which of the following accurately states the creditor's legal rights against the debtor?

Options:

B: On June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000.
C: The creditor is entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000, regardless of the date.
D: On August 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000.
E: The creditor is entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $7,000, the remaining amount after the promised $5,000 payment.
F: On July 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for the full $12,000, due to the debtor's failure to pay.
G: The creditor is not entitled to anything, due to the statute of limitations expiring.

Okay, so I've got this question about the statute of limitations and a promissory note. Let me try to break it down. 

Alright, the debtor owed $12,000 under a promissory note. The statute of limitations for filing a suit to collect was September 30 of last year. That means if the creditor didn't file by then, they can't sue anymore because the time's up.

But wait, here's what happened. On June 1 of this year, the creditor got a letter from the debtor. The letter says, "I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you." So the debtor is offering $5k as full payment. But then, the debtor didn't pay on July 1. 

Now, on August 1, the creditor sues the debtor. The debtor uses the statute of limitations as a defense and refuses to pay anything. The question is about the creditor's legal rights now.

Hmm. So first, the statute of limitations ran out on September 30 last year. After that, the creditor can't normally sue because the time has expired. But sometimes, certain actions can toll or restart the statute. I remember that if the debtor makes a payment or acknowledges the debt, it can restart the clock.

Wait, in this case, the debtor sent a letter offering to pay $5k as full satisfaction. So did that action by the debtor affect the statute of limitations? I think that acknowledging the debt can restart the clock. But does a conditional offer like this count as an acknowledgment?

I think the general rule is that a partial payment or an offer to pay can restart the statute. But here, the debtor didn't actually make a payment; they just promised to. So does a promise without payment count? Or maybe the offer itself is enough to toll the statute?

Wait, maybe it's about when the new promise was made. Let's see, the original statute ran out on September 30 last year. The debtor's letter was on June 1 this year. So if the statute had already expired, would the debtor's letter have any effect?

Wait, but wait—the statute of limitations is about when you can file a lawsuit. If the original time had passed, the creditor couldn't sue anymore. But if the debtor's action somehow tolls the statute, the time might start again from that point.

I think the key here is that the debtor's letter was a new promise. But the creditor didn't bring suit until August 1. Let me think about the timeline.

Original debt: $12k, statute expired Sept 30 last year.

Debtor's offer on June 1 this year: "I'll pay $5k on July 1 as full satisfaction."

But the debtor didn't pay. So the creditor sues on August 1.

Does the debtor's letter count as an acknowledgment of the debt, thereby restarting the statute? If so, the new statute period would start from June 1, but I don't know the exact period. Let's assume the statute period is, say, 3 years or 6 years—whatever, but the point is, the creditor filed on August 1, which is within the new period if it was restarted.

Wait, but the statute had already run out before June 1. So the creditor couldn't have sued before June 1 because the time was up. But after June 1, does the debtor's letter allow the creditor to sue again?

Yes, I think so. Because the debtor's acknowledgment can revive the debt for the purpose of the statute. So the statute starts anew from the date of acknowledgment.

But wait, the letter was on June 1. So the new statute period would begin on June 1. If the statute is, say, 3 years, then the creditor would have until June 1, 3 years later, to file. But in this case, the creditor filed on August 1, which is within the new period if it was restarted.

Alternatively, maybe the statute period is shorter. But regardless, the point is that the creditor's suit on August 1 would be within the new period if the statute was restarted on June 1.

But wait, another angle: the debtor's offer was a conditional payment—only if they pay $5k on July 1. So is that an unconditional acknowledgment of the debt, or is it conditional? Because the debtor is saying they'll pay $5k in full satisfaction. So maybe it's a settlement offer.

In terms of the statute, does a settlement offer count as an acknowledgment sufficient to restart the statute? Or does it have to be an unconditional promise to pay?

I think that any written acknowledgment of the debt, even if it's a partial payment offer, can restart the statute. So the debtor's letter on June 1 might have done that.

But wait, the statute had already expired before June 1. So the creditor couldn't have sued before June 1, but after June 1, the new period starts. So when the creditor sues on August 1, which is after the acknowledgment, it's within the new period.

But another point: the debtor's offer was to pay $5k in full satisfaction. So if the creditor had accepted that offer by, say, waiting until July 1, then the debt would have been settled for $5k. But the creditor didn't accept; the debtor just didn't pay. So what's the effect?

I think that the offer to pay a lesser amount as full satisfaction doesn't necessarily revive the entire debt unless the creditor agrees. But for the purposes of the statute of limitations, any acknowledgment can restart the clock, regardless of the amount.

So the creditor's suit on August 1 would be timely because the statute was restarted on June 1. Therefore, the creditor can sue for the original amount, $12k, because the debtor's offer to pay part didn't reduce the debt unless accepted.

Wait, but the debtor's letter was a firm offer to pay $5k on July 1. If the creditor didn't accept it, then the offer doesn't affect the original debt. So the original debt remains at $12k.

So when the creditor sues on August 1, which is after the original statute expired but within the new period (if the statute restarts on June 1), the creditor can collect the full $12k.

Wait, but the options are about when the creditor became entitled to a judgment. Let me look at the options.

Option D says on August 1, the creditor became entitled for $12k. But I'm not sure. Because the suit is brought on August 1, but the entitlement arises when the debtor fails to pay.

Wait, the original debt was due under the promissory note. But the debtor's letter on June 1 was a new promise. If the creditor didn't accept the offer, the original debt remains. So when the debtor failed to pay on July 1, the creditor can sue on the original note, but only if the statute allows.

But if the statute was restarted by the June 1 letter, then the creditor can sue within the new period. So when the creditor sues on August 1, which is within the new period, they can collect the full $12k.

Alternatively, perhaps the creditor's right to sue was revived on June 1, so they can sue anytime after that, as long as it's within the new statute period.

Wait, but the question is about when the creditor became entitled to a judgment. So when did the cause of action arise again?

Alternatively, perhaps the original debt's statute had expired, so the creditor couldn't sue until the debtor's June 1 letter, which restarted the clock. So on June 1, the creditor's right to sue was revived, but only for the new period.

Wait, but the creditor can't collect more than the debtor offered unless they reject the offer. Hmm, but the debtor's offer was to settle for $5k. The creditor didn't accept, so the original debt stands at $12k.

So putting it together, the creditor's suit on August 1 is timely because the statute was restarted by the June 1 letter. Therefore, the creditor can collect the full $12k.

Looking at the options, option D says on August 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment for $12k. But I'm not sure about the entitlement date. Alternatively, perhaps the entitlement arose when the debtor failed to pay on July 1, making the entire debt due again.

Wait, the promissory note was due, but the statute had run. The debtor's offer didn't pay, so the creditor can sue after July 1. But because the statute was restarted on June 1, the creditor's suit on August 1 is within the new period.

So the creditor can now sue for the full $12k because the statute is no longer a bar. So option D says that on August 1, the creditor became entitled. But perhaps the entitlement was when the debtor failed to pay, which was July 1.

Wait, the original debt was already due. The creditor's right to collect was only barred by the statute. So when the statute was restarted, the creditor could sue again. So the suit on August 1 is within the new period, so the creditor can collect the full amount.

Alternatively, maybe the creditor's entitlement to the full amount arose when the debtor failed to pay on July 1, because the offer was to settle, and the failure to pay means the creditor can pursue the original debt. But the timing of the lawsuit is within the new statute period.

So looking back at the options:

Option F: On July 1, the creditor became entitled to judgment for full $12k due to failure to pay.

Option D: On August 1, became entitled for $12k.

Wait, the entitlement to the full amount would be when the debtor failed to make the promised payment, right? Because the offer was to pay $5k as full satisfaction. If the debtor doesn't pay, the original debt remains. So on July 1, when the payment wasn't made, the creditor could then sue for the full amount, provided the statute allows.

But because the statute was restarted on June 1, the creditor can sue within the new period. So when the creditor sues on August 1, they can collect the full $12k.

Alternatively, the debtor's failure to pay on July 1 might not change the fact that the statute was restarted. So the creditor is allowed to sue because the statute is now active again.

So the correct answer might be D: On August 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment for $12k.

Wait, but another thought: the original debt was $12k. The creditor's right to collect was barred by the statute of limitations as of September 30 last year. The debtor's letter on June 1 this year restarts the statute. So the creditor can bring suit within the new period, which would be, say, 3 years from June 1. So when the creditor sues on August 1, which is within that time, they can collect the full $12k.

But the question is about the creditor's rights when they bring the suit on August 1. So when the creditor files on August 1, they can collect the full $12k because the statute no longer bars the claim.

So looking at the options, option D says on August 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment for $12k. That seems correct.

Wait, but another option is F: On July 1, the creditor became entitled to the full $12k. Because that's when the debtor failed to pay the $5k. So perhaps the entitlement is on July 1, but the suit was brought on August 1.

But the creditor's entitlement to the debt arises when the debtor defaults on the promissory note. However, the statute of limitations issue is about whether they can bring the suit. So even if the debt was due, if the statute had run, they couldn't sue. But if the statute was restarted, they can.

So when the debtor failed to pay on July 1, the creditor's right to the full debt was restored, but only if they can sue within the new statute period. So the right to the debt was always there, but the ability to enforce it was barred until the statute restarted.

So perhaps the creditor's entitlement to the $12k was on July 1, but the ability to sue was possible because the statute was restarted on June 1. So when the creditor sues on August 1, they can collect.

But the options are about when the creditor became entitled to the judgment. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, because on July 1, the debtor's failure to pay the $5k means the creditor can go back to the original debt. But whether the creditor can sue depends on the statute.

Wait, but without the statute being tolled, the creditor couldn't have sued even if the debtor failed to pay. So the combination is that the statute was restarted on June 1, allowing the creditor to sue after that, and the debtor's failure to pay on July 1 meant the creditor can pursue the full debt.

So the creditor's entitlement to the full amount arises on July 1, but the ability to sue is because the statute was restarted. So perhaps the correct answer is F.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the rules again.

Under the statute of limitations, once it's expired, the creditor can't sue unless an event restarts the clock. A written acknowledgment by the debtor can restart the statute. So the June 1 letter did that. So the statute starts from June 1.

When the creditor sues on August 1, which is within the new period, they can collect the debt.

The amount they can collect is the original $12k because the offer to pay $5k wasn't accepted. So the debt remains at $12k.

So the creditor can collect $12k when they sue on August 1 because the statute allows it now.

Looking at the options, option D says that on August 1, the creditor became entitled to $12k. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but when did the entitlement actually happen? The debt was already owed, but the ability to enforce it was barred. So when the statute restarts, the creditor can enforce it again. So the entitlement is when the statute allows the suit, which would be when the suit is brought, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the entitlement to the debt itself doesn't change, but the ability to enforce it does. So the creditor is entitled to the $12k regardless, but can only collect if the statute hasn't run.

So when the statute restarts, the creditor can bring the suit. So the creditor's right to the judgment is on August 1 when they file, but that's more about the procedure.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about what each option is saying.

Option D: On August 1, creditor became entitled to $12k.

Option F: On July 1, entitled to $12k.

But the creditor didn't file until August 1. So the entitlement to the judgment would be when the suit is brought, but the cause of action (the right to sue) became available again on June 1.

Wait, the cause of action was originally barred on September 30 last year. The debtor's letter on June 1 this year revived it, making the cause of action available again.

So the creditor could have sued anytime from June 1 onwards, as long as it's within the new statute period.

So when the creditor sues on August 1, they can collect the $12k.

So the creditor's entitlement to the judgment is when the suit is properly brought, which is August 1.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The debtor owed the creditor $12,000 under a promissory note, and the statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit expired on September 30 of last year. On June 1 of this year, the debtor sent a letter offering to pay $5,000 on July 1 as full satisfaction of the debt. However, the debtor failed to make the payment, and the creditor filed suit on August 1. The debtor asserted the statute of limitations as a defense.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Statute of Limitations**: The original statute of limitations expired on September 30 of last year, barring the creditor from suing unless an event occurred to restart the clock. A written acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor can toll or restart the statute of limitations.

2. **Debtor's Letter**: The debtor's letter on June 1, offering to pay $5,000 as full satisfaction, constitutes a written acknowledgment of the debt. This acknowledgment restarted the statute of limitations, allowing the creditor to sue within the new period.

3. **Failure to Pay**: The debtor's failure to pay $5,000 on July 1 meant that the original debt of $12,000 remained outstanding. The creditor was not obligated to accept the $5,000 settlement offer, so the full debt remained enforceable.

4. **Timing of the Lawsuit**: The creditor filed suit on August 1, which was within the new statute of limitations period that began on June 1. Therefore, the creditor was entitled to pursue the full $12,000 debt.

5. **Entitlement to Judgment**: The creditor's entitlement to a judgment for the full $12,000 arose when the lawsuit was brought on August 1, as this was when the creditor properly enforced the debt within the restarted statute of limitations period.

Option Analysis:
- **Option D**: Correct. On August 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment for $12,000 because the lawsuit was timely filed within the restarted statute of limitations period.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. While the debtor's failure to pay on July 1 restored the creditor's right to the full $12,000, the creditor's entitlement to a judgment occurred when the lawsuit was brought on August 1.
- Other options are inconsistent with the analysis of the statute of limitations, the effect of the debtor's acknowledgment, and the timing of the lawsuit.
