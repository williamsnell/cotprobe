Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. The question is about the sides of a triangle. The longest side is given as 10, and I need to figure out which of the options cannot be the lengths of the other two sides. Hmm, right. I remember something about the triangle inequality theorem. Let me think about that.

The triangle inequality theorem says that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. Oh wait, right. So for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, where c is the longest side, the sum of a and b must be greater than c. That makes sense because if a + b were equal to or less than c, the two shorter sides wouldn't be able to meet to form a triangle.

So in this problem, the longest side is 10. That means for each option, I'll have two sides, and I need to check if their sum is greater than 10. If it's not, then those two sides can't form a triangle with the longest side being 10.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: 5 and 5. So adding them gives 5 + 5 = 10. Wait, but the triangle inequality says the sum must be greater than the third side. So 10 is not greater than 10. Oh, so this would not form a valid triangle. Because the sum is equal, which would make it a degenerate triangle, right? Like, it would just be a straight line, not a triangle. So Option A is a candidate for the answer because it doesn't satisfy the condition.

Option B: 9 and 8. Adding them gives 9 + 8 = 17. That's definitely greater than 10. So this works. So B is a possible option, so it's not the answer.

Option C: 3 and 9. Let's see, 3 + 9 = 12, which is greater than 10. So that's okay. So C is possible.

Option D: 6 and 5. 6 + 5 = 11, which is greater than 10. So that's fine. D is okay.

Option E: 4 and 7. 4 +7 =11, which is also greater than 10. So E is fine.

Wait, but wait a minute. I went through each option, but I think I might have missed something. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the question is asking which option could NOT be the lengths of the other two sides. So the one that fails the triangle inequality.

So from my earlier analysis, only option A gives a sum of 10, which is not greater. So option A is the one that cannot be the other two sides.

But wait, let me make sure. Did I get all the options right? Let's recheck each sum:

A: 5+5=10 → Not greater than 10. So invalid.

B: 9+8=17>10 → Valid.

C:3+9=12>10 → Valid.

D:6+5=11>10 → Valid.

E:4+7=11>10 → Valid.

Yes, so only option A fails. So the answer must be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says the longest side is 10. So in each option, maybe 10 is the longest, or perhaps one of the options has a side longer than 10? Let me check.

Looking at the options again:

A: 5 and 5. Both less than 10, so 10 is the longest.

B:9 and8. Both less than 10. So 10 is longest.

C:3 and9. 9 is less than 10. So 10 is longest.

D:6 and5. Both less than 10.

E:4 and7. Both less than 10.

So none of the options have a side longer than 10. So all the options are considering 10 as the longest side. So my earlier conclusion holds.

To determine which option cannot be the lengths of the other two sides of a triangle with the longest side being 10, we apply the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Here, the longest side is 10, so the sum of the other two sides must be greater than 10.

- **Option A: 5, 5**  
  \(5 + 5 = 10\), which is not greater than 10. This fails the triangle inequality, so a triangle cannot be formed.  

- **Option B: 9, 8**  
  \(9 + 8 = 17\), which is greater than 10. This satisfies the triangle inequality.  

- **Option C: 3, 9**  
  \(3 + 9 = 12\), which is greater than 10. This satisfies the triangle inequality.  

- **Option D: 6, 5**  
  \(6 + 5 = 11\), which is greater than 10. This satisfies the triangle inequality.  

- **Option E: 4, 7**  
  \(4 + 7 = 11\), which is greater than 10. This satisfies the triangle inequality.  

The only option that fails the triangle inequality is **Option A**. Therefore, the lengths 5 and 5 cannot be the other two sides of the triangle.
