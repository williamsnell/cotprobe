Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here about predicting the number of votes for candidate A in an election based on a survey. Hmm. So, the survey was done on 1000 registered voters, and 450 of them said they'd vote for candidate A. Now, the question is, if 220,000 people vote in the election, how many votes would candidate A get according to the survey's prediction?

Alright, so the first thing I think is that the survey is a sample of the larger population. So the 1000 voters represent the whole 220,000 voters. The idea is that the proportion of people who support candidate A in the sample should be the same as in the whole population.

So, in the sample, 450 out of 1000 support A. To find out the proportion, I can calculate 450 divided by 1000. Let me do that. 450 divided by 1000 is 0.45. So 45% of the surveyed people support A.

Now, applying this proportion to the total number of voters. The total is 220,000. So I multiply 220,000 by 0.45 to find the predicted votes for A.

Wait, let me calculate that. 220,000 times 0.45. Hmm, 220,000 times 0.4 is 88,000, and 220,000 times 0.05 is 11,000. Adding those together, 88,000 + 11,000 equals 99,000. So the prediction is 99,000 votes for candidate A.

Looking at the options, option C is 99,000, so that should be the correct answer.

The survey indicates that 45% of the voters support candidate A. Applying this percentage to the total of 220,000 voters gives 220,000 * 0.45 = 99,000 votes. 

The correct answer is C: 99,000.
