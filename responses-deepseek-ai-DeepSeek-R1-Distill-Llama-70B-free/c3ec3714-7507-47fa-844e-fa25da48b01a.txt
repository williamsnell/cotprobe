Question:

Suggest a reason for the fact that ultraviolet light causes Cl_2 (gas) to cleavehomolytically, to produce two chlorine radicals, rather thanheterolytically, to produceCl^+ andCl^-.

Options:

A: The Cl-Cl bond is nonpolar, making heterolysis less favorable
B: Ultraviolet light induces a change in the chlorine molecule's geometric structure, promoting homolysis
C: Heterolysis is prevented by the high ionization energy of chlorine atoms
D: A molecule will need less dissociation energy in homolysis
E: Chlorine is more electronegative
F: The formation of radicals is energetically more favorable under UV light conditions
G: Cleavage occurs more easily by heterolysis
H: Chlorine atoms have equal electronegativity, leading to equal sharing of electrons
I: Ultraviolet light provides insufficient energy for heterolysis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why ultraviolet light causes Cl2 gas to cleave homolytically rather than heterolytically. Hmm, homolytic cleavage means each chlorine atom gets one electron, right? So that would produce two chlorine radicals, each with an unpaired electron. On the other hand, heterolytic cleavage would result in Cl+ and Cl- ions because one takes both electrons and the other none.

Wait, so why does UV light make it happen this way? I remember that homolytic fission is more common in nonpolar bonds because the bond is already sharing electrons equally, so breaking them equally makes sense. Cl2 is a diatomic molecule with a covalent bond, which is nonpolar because both atoms are the same. So if the bond is nonpolar, heterolysis might not be as favorable because that would require the bond to break in a way that creates ions of opposite charges, which isn't as easy in a nonpolar bond.

Looking at the options, option A says the Cl-Cl bond is nonpolar, making heterolysis less favorable. That makes sense because if the bond is nonpolar, breaking it into ions (which have charges) would require more energy since the molecule isn't naturally set up for that. So UV light provides energy, but maybe not enough for heterolysis, or maybe it's just more energetically favorable to break it homolytically.

Option C mentions high ionization energy. Wait, ionization energy is about removing an electron from an atom. If the ionization energy is high, maybe that affects heterolysis. But in heterolysis, you're not necessarily ionizing atoms; you're breaking a bond into ions. I'm not sure if that's the main factor here.

Option F says radicals are more favorable under UV light. I think UV light provides the necessary energy to break the bond. Homolysis requires that each atom takes an electron, which might be lower energy than creating ions, especially if the molecule is nonpolar.

So going back, the main reason is the bond's nonpolarity. So option A seems correct. Another option is D: homolysis needs less dissociation energy. That might be true, but why is that the case? Because the bond is nonpolar, so breaking it into radicals is easier than into ions.

Wait, another thought: heterolysis would require the bond to break such that one Cl gets both electrons (becoming Cl-) and the other gets none (Cl+). But in a nonpolar bond, the electrons are shared equally. So it's harder to split them unequally. So the energy from UV light might not be enough to force that unequal split, or it's more favorable to split equally.

So the reason is the bond's nonpolarity making heterolysis less favorable. So the correct answer is A.

The reason ultraviolet light causes Cl₂ to cleave homolytically rather than heterolytically lies in the nature of the Cl-Cl bond. The bond is nonpolar, meaning electrons are shared equally between the two chlorine atoms. Homolytic cleavage, which produces two chlorine radicals by splitting the bond equally, is more energetically favorable in this case. Heterolytic cleavage, on the other hand, would require the bond to break unequally, resulting in Cl⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. This unequal split is less favorable for a nonpolar bond like Cl-Cl, as it would necessitate a significant energy input to create charged species from a neutral, symmetric molecule. Therefore, the nonpolarity of the Cl-Cl bond makes heterolysis less favorable, favoring homolysis instead.
