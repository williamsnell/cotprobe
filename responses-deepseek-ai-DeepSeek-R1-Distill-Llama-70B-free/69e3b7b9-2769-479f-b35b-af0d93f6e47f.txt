Okay, so I've got this system of equations to solve. The problem is: 725x + 727y = 1500 and 729x + 731y = 1508. And I need to find the value of x - y. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.

Alright, I remember that when you have two equations with two variables, you can use either substitution or elimination. Both methods should work, but elimination might be quicker here if I can manipulate the equations to eliminate one of the variables.

Looking at the coefficients, the first equation has 725x and 727y, while the second has 729x and 731y. The right-hand sides are 1500 and 1508 respectively. I notice that the coefficients in the second equation are each 4 more than those in the first equation. Wait, 729 is 725 +4, 731 is 727 +4, and 1508 is 1500 +8. Oh, right, because 1500 + 8 is 1508. So maybe subtracting the first equation from the second could help eliminate some terms.

Let me write down the equations:

1) 725x + 727y = 1500  
2) 729x + 731y = 1508

If I subtract equation 1 from equation 2, what do I get?

(729x - 725x) + (731y -727y) = 1508 - 1500  
That's 4x +4y = 8.

Simplify that by dividing both sides by 4: x + y = 2.

Okay, so now I have a new equation, equation 3: x + y = 2.

Now I need another equation to solve for x and y. Maybe I can use equation 3 and equation 1 together. Let me write equation 3 as x = 2 - y and substitute that into equation 1.

Substituting into equation 1:  
725*(2 - y) + 727y = 1500  
Let me compute that.

725 * 2 is 1450.  
725*(-y) is -725y.  
So 1450 -725y +727y = 1500.

Combine like terms: (-725y +727y) is 2y. So:

1450 + 2y = 1500.

Subtract 1450 from both sides: 2y = 50.

Divide by 2: y = 25.

Wait, that seems a bit large, but let's check. Then substitute y=25 into equation 3: x +25 =2 â†’ x= -23.

So x is -23 and y is 25. Then x - y is -23 -25 = -48. Hmm, that's option A: -48. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Let me plug these values back into the original equations to verify.

First equation: 725*(-23) +727*(25). Let's compute each term.

725 * (-23) = let's see, 700*23=16100, so 725 is 25 more, so 25*23=575. So 725*23= (700+25)*23 = 16100 + 575 = 16675. So with negative, it's -16675.

727*25: 700*25=17500, 27*25=675. So 17500+675=18175.

Adding them: -16675 +18175 = 1500, which matches the first equation. Good.

Second equation: 729*(-23) +731*(25).

729*(-23): 700*(-23)= -16100, 29*(-23)= -667. So total is -16100 -667= -16767.

731*25: 700*25=17500, 31*25=775. So 17500+775=18275.

Adding them: -16767 +18275 = 1508. Which matches the second equation. So the values are correct.

So x= -23, y=25. Thus x - y = -23 -25 = -48. So the answer is option A.

To solve the system of equations:

1) \(725x + 727y = 1500\)  
2) \(729x + 731y = 1508\),  

we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate terms:  

\[
(729x - 725x) + (731y - 727y) = 1508 - 1500
\]  
\[
4x + 4y = 8
\]  
Dividing through by 4:  
\[
x + y = 2 \tag{3}
\]

Next, substitute \(x = 2 - y\) from equation (3) into equation (1):  

\[
725(2 - y) + 727y = 1500
\]  
\[
1450 - 725y + 727y = 1500
\]  
\[
1450 + 2y = 1500
\]  
\[
2y = 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 25
\]

Substitute \(y = 25\) into equation (3):  
\[
x + 25 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -23
\]

Thus, \(x - y = -23 - 25 = -48\).
