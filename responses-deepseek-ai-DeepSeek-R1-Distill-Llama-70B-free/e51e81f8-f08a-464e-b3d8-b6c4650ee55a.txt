Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man is repaying a $1,000 loan in 15 equal annual installments with an interest rate of 4%. After his tenth payment, he wants to pay the balance in a lump sum, and I need to find out how much he owes at that point. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that loans like this are usually amortized, meaning each payment covers the interest for the period and reduces the principal. So each installment is part interest and part principal.

I think I'll need to calculate the amount of each annual payment first. The formula for the annual payment (A) on an amortized loan is given by A = P * [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n - 1], where P is the principal, i is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.

Plugging in the numbers: P is $1,000, i is 4% or 0.04, and n is 15. So let's calculate that.

A = 1000 * [0.04*(1+0.04)^15]/[(1+0.04)^15 - 1]

I think I should compute (1.04)^15 first. Let me approximate that. Wait, 1.04^15 is about... Let's see, 1.04^10 is approximately 1.4802, and then 1.04^5 is about 1.2167. So multiplying those together gives roughly 1.4802 * 1.2167 ≈ 1.797. So (1.04)^15 ≈ 1.797.

So the numerator becomes 0.04 * 1.797 ≈ 0.07188.

The denominator is 1.797 - 1 = 0.797.

So A ≈ 1000 * (0.07188 / 0.797) = 1000 * approx 0.0902, which is about $90.20 per year.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise. Maybe using a calculator would help, but I'll proceed with this approximation for now.

So each payment is approximately $90.20 per year. But maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me try that.

Calculating (1.04)^15 more accurately. Let me compute step by step.

1.04^1 = 1.04

1.04^2 = 1.0816

1.04^3 ≈ 1.124864

1.04^4 ≈ 1.16985856

1.04^5 ≈ 1.2166529024

1.04^6 ≈ 1.265319018

1.04^7 ≈ 1.315931779

1.04^8 ≈ 1.368569050

1.04^9 ≈ 1.423312812

1.04^10 ≈ 1.480244285

1.04^11 ≈ 1.539454491

1.04^12 ≈ 1.601032735

1.04^13 ≈ 1.665075129

1.04^14 ≈ 1.731676801

1.04^15 ≈ 1.800943352

Wait, so more accurately, (1.04)^15 is approximately 1.800943. So the numerator is 0.04 * 1.800943 ≈ 0.07203872.

Denominator is 1.800943 - 1 = 0.800943.

So A = 1000 * (0.07203872 / 0.800943) ≈ 1000 * 0.0899 ≈ $89.90 per year.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using the present value of an annuity formula.

Alternatively, each payment is $X, and the present value of 15 payments of X is $1,000. So X = 1000 * (0.04)/(1 - (1+0.04)^-15).

Let me compute (1.04)^-15. Since (1.04)^15 ≈ 1.800943, so (1.04)^-15 is 1/1.800943 ≈ 0.554956.

So denominator 1 - 0.554956 ≈ 0.445044.

So X = 1000 * (0.04) / 0.445044 ≈ 1000 * 0.0899 ≈ $89.90 per year.

So each payment is about $89.90. Let's say approximately $90.

Now, he's made 10 payments. So I need to find the remaining balance after 10 years, and then calculate how much he would owe in a lump sum at that point.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the outstanding balance after 10 payments using the present value formula again. The outstanding balance after k payments can be found by calculating the present value of the remaining (n - k) payments.

So after 10 payments, the outstanding balance is the present value of the remaining 5 payments (since 15-10=5) of $89.90 each, at 4% interest.

So the present value (PV) is X * [1 - (1+i)^-m ] / i, where X is the annual payment, i is 0.04, and m is 5.

So PV = 89.90 * [1 - (1.04)^-5]/0.04.

Compute (1.04)^-5: 1/(1.04)^5. Since 1.04^5 is approximately 1.2166529, so (1.04)^-5 ≈ 0.821927.

So 1 - 0.821927 = 0.178073.

So PV = 89.90 * (0.178073 / 0.04) = 89.90 * 4.4518 ≈ ?

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.178073 / 0.04 = 4.4518.

So 89.90 * 4.4518 ≈ let's compute 90 * 4.4518 ≈ 400.062, but since it's 89.90, maybe 400.062 - (0.10 * 4.4518) = 400.062 - 0.44518 ≈ 399.6168.

So the present value is approximately $399.62. So he would owe about $399.62 after 10 payments.

Wait, but this is an approximation. Let me check if there's a more accurate method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the balance after each payment using the amortization schedule, but that might take longer.

Wait, let me think. Each payment is $89.90. After the first payment, the principal reduces by (payment - interest). The interest for the first year is 0.04 * 1000 = $40. So the principal after first payment is 1000 - (89.90 - 40) = 1000 - 49.90 = 950.10.

After the second payment, interest is 0.04 * 950.10 ≈ 38.004. So principal payment is 89.90 - 38.004 ≈ 51.896. So new balance is 950.10 - 51.896 ≈ 898.204.

Hmm, this is getting tedious, but maybe doing it for a few more periods would help see a pattern, but perhaps it's better to find a formula.

Yes, I think the formula for the remaining balance after k periods is:

B_k = P * [(1+i)^k - 1] / [(1+i)^n - 1] * [ (1+i)^n * i ]

Wait, no. Alternatively, the remaining balance can be calculated as the present value of the remaining payments.

So after k payments, the remaining balance is the present value of (n - k) payments at the same interest rate.

Which is what I did before, so the present value is X * [1 - (1 + i)^-(n -k)] / i.

So in this case, X is the annual payment of $89.90, n is 15, k is 10, so m = 5.

So yes, I think that's correct.

So the present value of 5 payments of $89.90 at 4% is approximately $399.62.

But let me compute it more accurately.

Compute (1.04)^5: 1.04^1=1.04; 1.04^2=1.0816; 1.04^3=1.124864; 1.04^4=1.16985856; 1.04^5≈1.2166529.

So (1.04)^-5 ≈ 1/1.2166529 ≈ 0.821927.

So the present value factor for 5 years is [1 - 0.821927]/0.04 = 0.178073/0.04 ≈ 4.4518.

So 89.90 * 4.4518 = let's compute it step by step.

4 * 89.90 = 359.6

0.4 * 89.90 = 35.96

0.05 * 89.90 = 4.495

0.0018 * 89.90 ≈ 0.16182

Adding up:

359.6 + 35.96 = 395.56

395.56 + 4.495 = 400.055

400.055 + 0.16182 ≈ 400.2168.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was approximately 399.62. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 89.90 * 4.4518.

Let me compute 89.90 * 4 = 359.6.

89.90 * 0.4 = 35.96 → 359.6 +35.96=395.56

89.90 * 0.05=4.495 → total 395.56 +4.495=400.055

Then 89.90 * 0.0018= approx 0.1618. So 400.055 +0.1618=400.2168.

So more accurately, about $400.22.

Wait, but that's using the precise X of $89.90.

But perhaps I should use the exact annual payment. Wait, perhaps the initial annual payment is more accurately calculated.

Let me recalculate the annual payment accurately.

P = 1000, i=0.04, n=15.

A = P * i / (1 - (1 + i)^-n )

So A = 1000 * 0.04 / (1 - (1.04)^-15 )

Compute denominator: 1 - 1/(1.04)^15.

(1.04)^15 ≈ 1.800943, so 1/1.800943≈0.554956.

So denominator is 1 - 0.554956 = 0.445044.

So A = 1000 * 0.04 / 0.445044 ≈ (40) / 0.445044 ≈ 89.899, approximately $89.90.

So using A=89.90.

Thus, present value after 10 payments is 89.90 * 4.4518≈400.22.

Wait, but wait a second, let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the present value factor using (1.04)^5, but perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the remaining balance after k payments.

Another approach: the remaining balance after k payments can be found by:

B_k = P(1+i)^k - A * [(1+i)^k -1]/i

Wait, that's another formula. Let me try that.

So here, P=1000, i=0.04, k=10.

A is the annual payment, which is 89.90.

So B_10 = 1000*(1.04)^10 - 89.90 * [ (1.04)^10 -1 ] / 0.04.

Compute each part:

First, (1.04)^10 ≈ 1.480244.

So 1000 * 1.480244 ≈ 1480.244.

Next, compute (1.04)^10 -1 = 1.480244 -1 = 0.480244.

So 89.90 * 0.480244 /0.04.

So 0.480244 /0.04 =12.0061.

So 89.90 *12.0061 ≈ ?

Compute 89.90 * 12 = 1078.8.

89.90 * 0.0061 ≈ 0.5486.

So total ≈ 1078.8 + 0.5486 ≈ 1079.3486.

So B_10 = 1480.244 - 1079.3486 ≈ 400.8954, approximately $400.90.

Wait, but earlier using the present value of 5 payments, I got approximately $400.22. Hmm, but these methods should give the same result. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the calculations.

Wait, let's double-check the second method. The formula is B_k = P(1+i)^k - A * [ ( (1+i)^k - 1 ) / i ]

So, A=89.90, k=10.

Compute (1.04)^10=1.480244.

Compute numerator for the second term: (1.480244 -1)=0.480244.

Divide by i=0.04: 0.480244/0.04=12.0061.

Multiply by A=89.90: 89.90 * 12.0061.

Let me compute 89.90 * 12 = 1078.8.

89.90 * 0.0061 = 0.5486.

So total is 1078.8 + 0.5486 ≈ 1079.3486.

So B_10 = 1000*(1.04)^10 - 1079.3486.

1000*(1.04)^10 = 1000*1.480244≈1480.244.

1480.244 - 1079.3486 ≈ 400.8954, so approximately $400.90.

Hmm, this is a more precise method, so $400.90.

Wait, but earlier using the present value approach, I had about $400.22. These are close but not exactly the same. Maybe due to rounding differences.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the present value factor more accurately.

Let me compute the present value of 5 payments of $89.90 at 4% interest.

The present value factor for an ordinary annuity is [1 - (1+i)^-m ]/i.

So m=5, i=0.04.

Compute (1.04)^5: 1.2166529.

So (1.04)^-5 = 1/1.2166529 ≈ 0.821927.

So 1 - 0.821927 = 0.178073.

Divide by 0.04: 0.178073/0.04=4.451825.

Multiply by annual payment of 89.90: 89.90 *4.451825.

Let me compute this accurately.

Compute 80 *4.451825 = 356.146.

Compute 9.90 *4.451825: 9 *4.451825=40.066425; 0.90*4.451825≈4.006565. So total 40.066425 +4.006565≈44.07299.

So total PV is 356.146 +44.07299≈400.219, approximately $400.22.

Wait, so according to this method, it's about $400.22, but using the other formula, it's $400.90. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the initial annual payment was slightly different. Let me compute A more accurately.

A = 1000 * 0.04 / (1 - (1.04)^-15 )

Compute denominator: 1 - (1.04)^-15.

(1.04)^15=1.800943353, so (1.04)^-15≈0.554956.

So denominator is 1 - 0.554956=0.445044.

A=1000 * 0.04 / 0.445044 = 40 /0.445044 ≈ 89.8998, so approximately $89.90.

So using A=89.90.

In the first method, using the present value of 5 payments, it's $400.22.

In the second method, using the balance formula, it's $400.90.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the second method's formula. Let me recheck the formula.

The formula is B_k = P*(1+i)^k - A*[ ((1+i)^k -1)/i ]

Yes, that's correct. So P=1000, i=0.04, k=10, A=89.8998.

Compute (1.04)^10=1.480244285.

So B_10=1000*1.480244285 - 89.8998*( (1.480244285 -1)/0.04 )

Compute the second term: (1.480244285 -1)=0.480244285.

Divide by 0.04: 0.480244285/0.04=12.00610714.

Multiply by A=89.8998: 89.8998 *12.00610714.

Let me compute this accurately.

89.8998 *12 = 1078.7976.

89.8998 *0.00610714≈ let's see, 89.8998 *0.006=0.5394.

89.8998 *0.00010714≈≈0.00963.

So total≈1078.7976 +0.5394 +0.00963≈1078.7976+0.549≈1079.3466.

So B_10=1000*1.480244285 -1079.3466≈1480.244285 -1079.3466≈400.8977.

So approximately $400.90.

Wait, but the present value method gave me $400.22. That's about a $0.68 difference. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding in the payment.

Wait, perhaps the exact payment is not precisely $89.90, but let's compute it more accurately.

A=1000*0.04/(1 -1/(1.04)^15 )

Compute 1/(1.04)^15=0.554956.

So denominator is 1 -0
