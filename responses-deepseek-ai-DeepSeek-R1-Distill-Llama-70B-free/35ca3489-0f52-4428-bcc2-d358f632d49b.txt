Okay, so I've got this question about oxygen gas being heated, and I need to figure out what happens to the gas molecules. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but I'll try to think it through.

The question states that a sample of oxygen gas at 50°C is heated to 100°C. I need to determine how this affects the gas molecules. The options are A through J, each making a different claim about the number of molecules, their velocity, or kinetic energy.

First, I recall that when a gas is heated, its temperature increases. Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules. Oh wait, right! The average kinetic energy is directly proportional to the temperature in Kelvin. So when temperature goes up, kinetic energy should increase.

But wait, the question is about what's happening when the gas is heated. Let me think about the kinetic theory. Each molecule's kinetic energy is (3/2)kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So if the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of each molecule increases.

In this case, the initial temperature is 50°C. Converting that to Kelvin would be 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K. The final temperature is 100°C, which is 373.15 K. So the temperature increases by about 50 K.

Now, the average kinetic energy is proportional to absolute temperature. So the factor by which the kinetic energy increases is (373.15 / 323.15). Let me calculate that. 373 divided by 323 is roughly 1.155. So the kinetic energy increases by a factor of approximately 1.155, which is less than double. So any option suggesting a doubling (like option J) would be incorrect. But wait, option G says "their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2." That fits because 1.155 is less than 2. So G is a possible answer.

But let me check all the options to make sure. The question asks which statement best describes the behavior of the gas molecules.

Option A: The number of molecules decreases by half. No, unless the volume changes or some gas is allowed to escape, the number of molecules remains the same. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Their velocity remains the same. No, because temperature affects velocity. B is wrong.

Option C: Their velocity decreases by a factor of two. No, heating increases velocity, so C is wrong.

Option D: The number of molecules doubles. Again, no, unless more gas is added, which isn't indicated here. D is wrong.

Option E: Their kinetic energy remains the same. No, because temperature increased, so KE increases. E is wrong.

Option F: Their velocity increases by a factor of two. Hmm, velocity is related to temperature. The root-mean-square velocity is sqrt(3kT/m). So velocity is proportional to sqrt(T). Let me compute the factor. Initial T is 323.15 K, final is 373.15 K. So the ratio is sqrt(373.15/323.15) = sqrt(1.155) ≈ 1.075. So velocity increases by about 7.5%, not double. So F is wrong.

Option G: Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2. Yes, as I calculated earlier, about 1.155 times, which is less than 2. So G seems correct.

Option H: Their kinetic energy decreases. No, because heating increases KE. H is wrong.

Option I: Their velocity increases by a factor of four. That's way too high. I is wrong.

Option J: Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2. No, because it's only about 1.155. So J is incorrect.

So the best answer is G. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.

When a sample of oxygen gas is heated from 50°C to 100°C, the temperature increases from 323.15 K to 373.15 K. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. Thus, as the temperature rises, the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules also increases.

The factor by which the kinetic energy increases can be calculated as the ratio of the final temperature to the initial temperature:  

\[
\frac{T_{\text{final}}}{T_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{373.15}{323.15} \approx 1.155
\]

This means the kinetic energy increases by a factor of approximately 1.155, which is less than 2. Therefore, the statement that best describes the behavior of the gas molecules is that their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.

Analyzing the options:  
- **A, D**: Incorrect, as the number of molecules does not change unless gas is added or removed.  
- **B, C, F, I**: Incorrect, as velocity changes with temperature, and none of these options accurately describe the change.  
- **E, H**: Incorrect, as kinetic energy does not remain the same or decrease when the gas is heated.  
- **J**: Incorrect, as the kinetic energy does not double.  
- **G**: Correct, as the kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.

Thus, the best answer is **G**.
