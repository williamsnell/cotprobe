Answer:
    <think>

Okay, so I've got this differential equation to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. The equation is (d²x/dt²) - 2(dx/dt) - 3x = 10a sin t + b(2t +1). Hmm, wait, wait. Oh wait, maybe the right-hand side is 10a sin t plus b times (2t+1). So a and b are constants, right?

So, I remember that the general solution to a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution (Yh) and a particular solution (Yp). So, x = Yh + Yp.

First, I need to find Yh by solving the homogeneous equation: (d²x/dt²) - 2(dx/dt) -3x = 0.

To do that, I'll write the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for ay'' + by' + cx = 0 is ar² + br + c = 0. So here, the equation is r² - 2r -3 =0.

Solving this quadratic: r = [2 ± sqrt(4 +12)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)]/2 = [2 ±4]/2. So roots are (2+4)/2=3 and (2-4)/2=-1. So the homogeneous solution is Yh = c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{3t}. Wait, no, wait: because the roots are r1=3 and r2=-1. So yes, that's correct.

Now, I need to find the particular solution Yp, which has two parts because the right-hand side is 10a sin t + b(2t+1). So I can split this into two parts: one for the sine term and one for the polynomial term.

First, for the 10a sin t part. The forcing function is of the form F(t) = sin(ωt), where ω=1. So I'll assume a particular solution of the form A cos t + B sin t. But wait, I should check if this form is part of the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous solution has e^{-t} and e^{3t}, which are exponentials and don't interfere with sine or cosine, so it's safe to use A cos t + B sin t as the trial solution.

Taking derivatives:
Yp1 = A cos t + B sin t.
Yp1' = -A sin t + B cos t.
Yp1'' = -A cos t - B sin t.

Plugging into the homogeneous equation (but wait, no— into the nonhomogeneous equation? No, wait, wait. The particular solution must satisfy the nonhomogeneous equation: Yp'' -2 Yp' -3 Yp = 10a sin t.

Wait, no, the equation is (d²x/dt²) -2(dx/dt) -3x = 10a sin t + ... So for Yp1, it should satisfy Yp1'' -2 Yp1' -3 Yp1 = 10a sin t.

Let me plug in:

Yp1'' -2 Yp1' -3 Yp1 = [ -A cos t - B sin t ] -2[ -A sin t + B cos t ] -3[ A cos t + B sin t ]

Let me compute each term:

- A cos t - B sin t (from Yp1'' )

-2*(-A sin t + B cos t) = 2A sin t - 2B cos t

-3*(A cos t + B sin t) = -3A cos t -3B sin t

Now add all terms together:

(-A cos t - B sin t) + (2A sin t -2B cos t) + (-3A cos t -3B sin t)

Let me group cos t and sin t terms:

cos t: (-A) + (-2B) + (-3A) = (-4A -2B)

sin t: (-B) + (2A) + (-3B) = (2A -4B)

So the equation becomes:

(-4A -2B) cos t + (2A -4B) sin t = 10a sin t.

Since this must hold for all t, the coefficients of cos t and sin t must match on both sides.

On the right-hand side, the coefficient of cos t is 0, and sin t is 10a.

So:

-4A -2B = 0 (from cos t)
2A -4B = 10a (from sin t)

Let me solve these equations.

From the first equation: -4A -2B = 0 → 4A + 2B =0 → 2A + B=0 → B = -2A.

Substitute B=-2A into the second equation:

2A -4*(-2A) = 10a → 2A +8A =10a →10A=10a → A=a.

Then B= -2a.

So Yp1 = a cos t + (-2a) sin t = a cos t -2a sin t.

Wait, but the term on the RHS was 10a sin t, but our Yp1 gives a sin t coefficient of (2A -4B) which with A=a and B=-2a would be 2a -4*(-2a) = 2a +8a=10a. So yes, correct.

Now, moving on to the second part of the particular solution, Yp2, which comes from the term b(2t +1) = 2b t + b. So this is a first-degree polynomial.

So the forcing function is a polynomial of degree 1. So the trial particular solution would be of the form Yp2 = Ct + D.

Wait, but I need to check if that form is part of the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous solution is e^{-t} and e^{3t}, so polynomials are linearly independent from them, so it's safe to use Yp2 = Ct + D.

Compute derivatives:

Yp2 = Ct + D
Yp2' = C
Yp2'' = 0

Plug into the equation: Yp2'' -2 Yp2' -3 Yp2 = 0 -2C -3(Ct + D) = -2C -3C t -3D.

This must equal 2b t + b. So:

-3C t + (-2C -3D) = 2b t + b.

Set coefficients equal:

-3C = 2b → C= -(2b)/3.

And:

-2C -3D = b.

Substitute C into this:

-2*(-2b/3) -3D = b → (4b/3) -3D = b → Rearranging, -3D = b -4b/3 → -3D = -b/3 → D= (-b/3)/(-3) → D= b/(9).

So Yp2 = C t + D = [ (-2b/3) t ] + (b/9) = (-2b/3) t + b/9.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in signs. Let me recheck.

Wait, the equation after substitution was:

-3C t + (-2C -3D) = 2b t + b.

So equate coefficients:

-3C = 2b → C= -2b/3.

Then, the constant term: -2C -3D =b.

Plugging C= -2b/3:

-2*(-2b/3) = 4b/3.

So 4b/3 -3D = b → 4b/3 -b =3D → (4b -3b)/3 =3D → b/3=3D → D= b/(9).

Yes, correct. So Yp2= (-2b/3) t + b/9.

Now, the particular solution Yp is Yp1 + Yp2 = [a cos t - 2a sin t] + [ (-2b/3) t + b/9 ].

So the general solution is x= Yh + Yp = c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{3t} + a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t + b/9.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have different signs and terms. Let me check the options again.

Option A: x= c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{2t} + a (cos t -2 sin t) + b[ -2/3 t +1/9 ]

Wait, wait, our Yp has a cos t -2a sin t, so that's a (cos t -2 sin t ), which matches option A's a term.

But the homogeneous solution in option A is e^{-t} and e^{2t}, but our Yh is e^{-t} and e^{3t}. So that's a problem. So option A can't be correct because the exponents are 2 and -1.

Looking at option G: Yh is c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{3t}, which matches ours. Then Yp includes a (cos t +2 sin t) and b terms. Wait, our Yp1 is a (cos t -2 sin t), so G's a term is cos t +2 sin t, which doesn't match.

Option E has Yh as e^{t} and e^{3t}, which doesn't match.

Option D: Yh is e^{-t} and e^{3t}, which is correct. Then a term is (sin t -2 cos t), which is different from ours. So no.

Option B: Yh is e^{-t} and e^{3t}, correct. But the a term is -a (cos t -2 sin t). Hmm, ours is +a (cos t -2 sin t). So B would have -a (cos t -2 sin t) = -a cos t + 2a sin t, which is different. So unless the RHS was negative, but in our problem, the 10a sin t term is positive, so B might have a sign error.

Wait, no, in our Yp1, we had 10a sin t, so our particular solution had a (cos t -2 sin t). So option B's term is negative that, which would imply maybe a miscalculation.

Option G's a term is (cos t +2 sin t), which is different. So none of the options except perhaps option A and G have the right Yh.

Wait, looking back:

Wait, in the calculation for Yp1, when I set up the equation:

(-4A -2B) cos t + (2A -4B) sin t = 10a sin t.

Which gives:

-4A -2B =0 → equation 1.

2A -4B=10a → equation 2.

Solving:

From equation 1: B= -2A.

Substitute into equation 2:

2A -4*(-2A) = 10a → 2A +8A=10a →10A=10a → A=a.

Then B= -2a.

So Yp1= a cos t + (-2a) sin t = a (cos t - 2 sin t).

Which matches option A's a term. But option A's Yh has e^{2t}, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the homogeneous equation. Wait, original equation: x'' -2x' -3x = ... So the characteristic equation is r² -2r -3=0. Which factors as (r-3)(r+1)=0 → roots r=3 and r=-1. So Yh= c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{3t}, correct.

So looking back at the answer options, option G has Yh as c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{3t}, which is correct. Its Yp has a (cos t + 2 sin t), which doesn't match ours (we have cos t -2 sin t). So that can't be right.

Option E's Yh is e^t and e^{3t}, which is wrong.

Option D: Yh correct, but a term is sin t -2 cos t, which is different from ours.

Option B: Yh correct, a term is -a (cos t -2 sin t) → which is -a cos t +2a sin t. But our Yp1 is a cos t -2a sin t. So in option B, it's negative of our Yp1. So unless there's a sign error, that would be incorrect.

Wait, but the nonhomogeneous term is 10a sin t, so the particular solution's coefficient for sin t should match. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, when I plugged Yp1 into the equation, I had:

Yp1'' -2 Yp1' -3 Yp1 = [ -A cos t - B sin t ] -2[ -A sin t + B cos t ] -3[ A cos t + B sin t ]

Which simplifies to:

(-A cos t -B sin t) + (2A sin t -2B cos t) + (-3A cos t -3B sin t )

Grouping cos t:

(-A -2B -3A) cos t → (-4A -2B) cos t.

Grouping sin t:

(-B +2A -3B) sin t → (2A -4B) sin t.

Set equal to 10a sin t:

So,

-4A -2B =0 (coefficient of cos t)

2A -4B =10a (coefficient of sin t)

Solving, as before, gives A=a, B=-2a.

So Yp1 = a cos t -2a sin t.

So the correct Yp for the first part is a cos t -2a sin t.

Looking at the options, option A has a (cos t -2 sin t), which matches, but its Yh is wrong. Option G's a term is cos t +2 sin t, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs when plugging into the equation.

Wait, the equation is x'' -2x' -3x = 10a sin t.

So when I substitute Yp1 into the equation, I should have:

Yp1'' -2 Yp1' -3 Yp1 =10a sin t.

Which, after substitution, gives:

(-4A -2B) cos t + (2A -4B) sin t =10a sin t.

So equating:

-4A -2B =0 → equation 1.

2A -4B=10a → equation 2.

Which gives A=a, B=-2a, so Yp1 = a cos t -2a sin t.

So that's correct.

Now, the second part Yp2 is for the term 2bt +b.

We found Yp2= (-2b/3) t + b/9.

Now, putting it all together, the general solution is:

x = c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{3t} + a cos t -2a sin t - (2b/3) t + b/9.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: x= c1 e^{-t} + c2 e^{2t} + a (cos t -2 sin t) + b [ -2/3 t +1/9 ]

But Yh is wrong (e^{2t} instead of e^{3t}).

Option G: x= c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} +a (cos t +2 sin t) +b [ (2/3) t -1/9 ]

No, a term is cos t +2 sin t, which is wrong.

Option B: x= c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} -a (cos t -2 sin t) -b[ (2/3) t +1/9 ]

So Yh is correct, but the a term is -a (cos t -2 sin t) → which is -a cos t +2a sin t. Which is different from our Yp1, which is a cos t -2a sin t. So this would be correct only if the nonhomogeneous term was -10a sin t.

But in our problem, the term is +10a sin t, so option B's a term is wrong.

Option D: a term is sin t -2 cos t → which is -2 cos t + sin t, which doesn't match.

Option E: Yh is e^t and e^{3t} → wrong.

Option I: Yh is e^t and e^{-3t} → wrong.

Wait, what about option E: x= c1 e^{t} +c2 e^{3t} +a (cos t -2 sin t) +b [ (1/3) t +1/9 ]

But Yh is wrong, as exponents are 1 and 3 instead of -1 and 3.

Option G: x= c1 e^{-t} +c2 e^{3t} +a (cos t +2 sin t) +b [ (2/3) t -1/9 ]

No, a term is cos t +2 sin t.

Wait, did I make a mistake in calculating Yp2? Let me double-check.

For Yp2 = Ct + D.

We have:

Yp2'' -2 Yp2' -3 Yp2 = -2C -3(Ct + D) = -2C -3C t -3D.

Set equal to 2b t + b.

So, -3C t + (-2C -3D) =2b t +b.

Thus:

-3C =2b → C= -2b/3.

-2C -3D =b → substitute C:

-2*(-2b/3) =4b/3 → 4b/3 -3D =b → 4b/3 -b =3D → (4b-3b)/3=3D → b/3=3D → D= b/(9).

So Yp2 = (-2b/3) t + b/9.

Which is correct.

Looking back at the options, does any have Yh as e^{-t} and e^{3t}, Yp1 as a (cos t -2 sin t), and Yp2 as (-2b/3) t +b/9 ?

Looking at option A: Yh wrong, but Yp correct.

Option G: Yh correct, Yp a term wrong, Yp2
