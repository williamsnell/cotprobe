Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking. We have three variables a, b, and c, and we're given some equations involving their sums and products. The question is asking for a³ + b³ + c³. Hmm, I remember there's a formula that relates these terms to the sums of a, b, c and their products. 

The given equations are:
a + b + c = 6,
ab + ac + bc = 5,
and abc = -12.

I think the formula for the sum of cubes is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh right, wait, the correct formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Or is it minus 3abc? Wait, maybe I should double-check that formula.

Wait, I think it's actually a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I've heard about another formula where a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac). But that doesn't directly give me a³ + b³ + c³ without knowing a² + b² + c².

Wait, perhaps I can find a² + b² + c² first. Because I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So if I have a + b + c = 6 and ab + ac + bc = 5, then (6)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2*5. So 36 = a² + b² + c² + 10. Therefore, a² + b² + c² = 36 - 10 = 26. Okay, so a² + b² + c² is 26.

Now, going back to the sum of cubes. I think the formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc. Let me plug in the values I have:

(a + b + c)^3 is 6^3, which is 216.

Then subtract 3*(a + b + c)*(ab + bc + ac). So that's 3*6*5. Let's compute that: 3*6 is 18, 18*5 is 90.

So 216 minus 90 is 126.

Then add 3abc. Because the formula is +3abc. So 3*(-12) is -36.

So 126 - 36 equals 90. Wait, that would make a³ + b³ + c³ equal to 90. But wait, let me check the formula again because sometimes I get confused between adding and subtracting the 3abc term.

Wait, let me rederive the formula to make sure. Let's expand (a + b + c)^3. That's a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3ab² + 3ac² + 3b²c + 3bc² + 6abc. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, when you expand (a + b + c)^3, it's equal to a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c). No, wait, maybe that's another identity.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc. So that would mean substituting as I did before.

So let's recalculate that:

(a + b + c)^3 = 6^3 = 216.

Then, subtract 3*(a + b + c)*(ab + ac + bc) which is 3*6*5 = 90. So 216 - 90 = 126.

Then add 3abc. Since abc is -12, 3*(-12) is -36. So 126 + (-36) = 90.

Wait, but that would give 90 as the result. Looking at the options, F is 90. So is that the answer?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Another approach: I know that a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation x³ - (a + b + c)x² + (ab + ac + bc)x - abc = 0. So substituting the given values, the equation is x³ -6x² +5x +12 = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps me directly. Alternatively, maybe I can think of a, b, c as satisfying this equation, but I'm not sure that's necessary here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should compute each of a³, b³, c³ individually. But without knowing the individual values of a, b, c, that's tricky. So perhaps the formula approach is better.

Wait, let me check the formula again. I think the correct formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

So substituting the numbers:

6³ = 216.

3*(6)*(5) = 90.

3abc = 3*(-12) = -36.

So 216 - 90 + (-36) = 216 - 90 is 126, minus 36 is 90.

So the answer would be 90, which is option F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've seen another formula where a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ac). So using that, maybe I can compute it differently.

We already found a² + b² + c² is 26, and ab + bc + ac is 5. So a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac = 26 -5 = 21.

Then (a + b + c)(that) is 6 *21 = 126.

So a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = 126.

Then, a³ + b³ + c³ = 126 + 3abc.

Since abc is -12, 3abc is -36. So 126 -36 = 90. Same result.

So the answer should be 90, which is option F.

To solve for \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\), we use the identity:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc
\]

### Given:
- \(a + b + c = 6\)
- \(ab + bc + ac = 5\)
- \(abc = -12\)

### Step 1: Compute \((a + b + c)^3\)
\[
(a + b + c)^3 = 6^3 = 216
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac)\)
\[
3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) = 3 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 90
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(3abc\)
\[
3abc = 3 \cdot (-12) = -36
\]

### Step 4: Substitute into the formula
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 216 - 90 + (-36)
\]

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 216 - 90 - 36 = 90
\]

### Final Answer:
The value of \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\) is **90**, which corresponds to option **F**.
