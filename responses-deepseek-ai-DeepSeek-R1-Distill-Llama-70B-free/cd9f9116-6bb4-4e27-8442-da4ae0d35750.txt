Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating real estate taxes for Ms. Finer. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that Ms. Finer owns two houses. The tax rate is $43.72 per $1000. The market values are $17,000 and $25,000, and the assessment rate is 75%. I need to find out how much she pays in total real estate tax.

Wait, I remember that property taxes are usually calculated based on the assessed value, not the market value. Oh right, assessment rate is the percentage of the market value that's used for tax purposes. So first, I should find the assessed value for each house.

Assessed value is market value multiplied by the assessment rate. So for the first house, it's $17,000 * 75%. Let me calculate that. 75% is 0.75, so 17,000 * 0.75. Let's do 17k * 0.75. 17 times 0.75 is 12.75, so that's $12,750.

Similarly, the second house is $25,000. So 25,000 * 0.75. 25 * 0.75 is 18.75, so $18,750.

Now, I have to find the tax for each. The tax rate is $43.72 per $1000 of assessed value. So I think I need to calculate each house's tax and then add them together.

For the first house: assessed value is $12,750. I need to see how many thousands that is. So, 12,750 divided by 1000 is 12.75. Then multiply by the tax rate, which is $43.72 per thousand. So 12.75 * 43.72.

Wait, how do I calculate that? Let me think. 12 * 43.72 is easy. 12 * 40 is 480, 12 * 3.72 is about 44.64, so 480 + 44.64 = 524.64. Then the 0.75 part: 0.75 *43.72. 0.7 *43.72 is 30.604, 0.05 *43.72 is 2.186. So 30.604 + 2.186 =32.79. So total for the first house is 524.64 +32.79=557.43 dollars.

Wait, let me double-check that math. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 12.75 *43.72 more accurately.

Another way: 12.75 is the same as 12 and 3/4, which is 12 + 0.75. So 12 *43.72 is 524.64, and 0.75 *43.72 is 32.79. Yes, same as before. So 524.64 +32.79=557.43. So that's the tax for the first house.

Now the second house's assessed value is $18,750. Divide by 1000 to get 18.75. Multiply by 43.72.

Again, breaking it down: 18 *43.72 and 0.75 *43.72.

18 *43.72: Let's compute 10*43.72=437.2, 8*43.72=349.76. So 437.2 +349.76=786.96.

Then 0.75 *43.72=32.79, as before. So total is 786.96 +32.79=819.75.

So the second house's tax is $819.75.

Now, add both taxes together. 557.43 +819.75. Let's add: 557 +819 is 1376, and 0.43+0.75 is 1.18. So total is 1376 +1.18=1377.18.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is $1,377.18, which matches this. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe use a different method to calculate each tax.

First house: $17,000 *0.75=12,750. Tax is 12,750 * (43.72/1000). So 12,750 *0.04372. Let me compute that.

12,750 *0.04372. Hmm, 12,750 *0.04 is 510. 12,750 *0.00372 is let's see, 12,750 *0.003 is 38.25, and 12,750 *0.00072 is approximately 9.18. So 38.25+9.18=47.43. So 510+47.43=557.43. Same as before.

Second house: 25,000 *0.75=18,750. Tax is 18,750 *0.04372. Let's compute that. 18,750 *0.04=750. 18,750 *0.00372: 18,750 *0.003 is 56.25, 18,750 *0.00072 is about 13.5. So 56.25+13.5=69.75. So 750 +69.75=819.75. Same as before.

Adding together 557.43 +819.75 gives 1377.18, which is $1,377.18. So the correct answer should be option H.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option H is $1,377.18, which matches. So the answer must be H.

To calculate the real estate tax Ms. Finer pays, we first determine the assessed value of each house by applying the assessment rate of 75% to their market values:

1. **First house**:  
   Market value = $17,000  
   Assessed value = $17,000 × 0.75 = $12,750  

2. **Second house**:  
   Market value = $25,000  
   Assessed value = $25,000 × 0.75 = $18,750  

Next, we calculate the tax for each house using the tax rate of $43.72 per $1,000 of assessed value:

1. **First house**:  
   Tax = ($12,750 ÷ $1,000) × $43.72 = 12.75 × $43.72 = $557.43  

2. **Second house**:  
   Tax = ($18,750 ÷ $1,000) × $43.72 = 18.75 × $43.72 = $819.75  

Finally, we add the taxes for both houses to find the total tax Ms. Finer pays:  
Total tax = $557.43 + $819.75 = $1,377.18  

Thus, the correct answer is **H: $1,377.18**.
