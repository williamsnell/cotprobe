Question:

A woman was hired by a restaurant as a cashier under an at-will employment contract. On the woman's first day at work, she noticed a sign in the kitchen area that read:"IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEESEmployees are not permitted to smoke during working hours. Any employee who is found to be in violation of this policy will be fined $50 for the first offense; $100 for the second offense; and fired for the third violation. "The woman, who was a smoker, read the notice, but did not object or make any comment regarding the restaurant's nonsmoking policy. For six months, the woman worked at the restaurant and never smoked during business hours. One afternoon, the woman was working when an armed robber stormed into the restaurant. He pointed a pistol at the woman and demanded all the money from the cash register. Frightened and panic stricken, the woman handed over the money and then collapsed. Moments later, she regained consciousness and then smoked a cigarette while she regained her composure. Thereafter, the woman resumed her duties for the rest of the day. The next week, however, when the woman received her pay check, she noticed that the restaurant had deducted $50 from her check. A note was attached indicating that the woman was being fined for smoking during business hours. Although the woman protested, the restaurant refused to make any waiver and stood by its policy. In an action by the woman against the restaurant to recover the $50, which of the following is the best argument in the woman's favor?

Options:

A: The woman was not given a warning before the fine was implemented, which goes against standard disciplinary procedures.
B: The woman was not properly informed of the nonsmoking policy upon her hire, rendering the fine invalid.
C: The nonsmoking provision concerning disciplinary action is unenforceable, because it attempts to impose a penalty instead of reasonably liquidating the damages, if any, sustained by the restaurant.
D: The restaurant's nonsmoking policy violates the woman's right to smoke, which is protected under the law.
E: The nonsmoking provision is discriminatory as it does not take into account the personal habits or needs of the employees.
F: The restaurant violated the woman's rights by imposing a fine without giving her a chance to defend herself.
G: The restaurant impliedly waived the nonsmoking provision by permitting the woman to continue working for the rest of the day.
H: The restaurant's nonsmoking policy concerned a collateral matter that was not incorporated within the terms of their employment contract.
I: The nonsmoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about employment law, specifically dealing with at-will contracts and employer policies. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the woman was hired as a cashier under an at-will contract. I remember that at-will means the employer can terminate the employment for any reason, or no reason, as long as it's not against public policy. So the employer has a lot of flexibility here.

On her first day, she saw a notice in the kitchen. It said employees can't smoke during working hours. If they do, there are fines: $50 for first offense, $100 second, and termination on the third. She read it but didn't object. So she was aware of the policy.

For six months, she worked there without any issues, never smoked during work hours. Then one day, an armed robber comes in. She's working, he points a gun at her, demands money. She's frightened, gives the money, and then collapses. Later, she wakes up, smokes a cigarette to regain composure, then finishes her shift.

Next week, her paycheck is $50 short. The restaurant deducted it, citing the smoking policy. She protests, but they won't budge. Now she's suing to get that $50 back.

The question is, what's her best argument?

Looking at the options:

A: No warning before the fine. But the policy was clear about fines, so maybe she was warned via the policy. Not sure if this is the strongest argument.

B: Not properly informed. But she read the notice, so this seems weak.

C: The nonsmoking provision is unenforceable because it's a penalty, not liquidated damages. Hmm. Liquidated damages are supposed to estimate actual damages. If the fine is seen as a penalty, it might not be enforceable. But I'm not sure if this applies in employment contracts the same way as in other contracts.

D: Smoking right protected by law. I don't think smoking is a protected right in the workplace. Employers can have no-smoking policies.

E: Discriminatory because of personal habits. Unless it's a disability or something protected, I don't think so. Smoking isn't a protected category.

F: No chance to defend herself. Maybe due process, but in private employment, especially at-will, I don't think they need to give a hearing unless it's a contract issue.

G: Implied waiver by letting her work. The restaurant let her finish the day, but the policy says fines, not termination. So maybe they didn't waive it because they enforced the fine later.

H: Policy not part of employment contract. The notice was in the kitchen, but the employment was at-will. The contract didn't mention it, but policies can often be introduced later, especially if the employee is aware.

I: Constructive condition subsequent excused by impracticability. Constructive conditions are a bit tricky. Impracticability is like when fulfilling a contract becomes impossible due to unforeseen events. Here, she smoked due to the traumatic event. So maybe the impossibility or impracticability doctrine applies. She couldn't comply because of the circumstances.

So, thinking about this, the best arguments seem to be either C or I.

Option C argues that the fine is a penalty, not liquidated damages. If the restaurant can't show that $50 is a reasonable estimate of their actual damages, it's considered a penalty, which is unenforceable. But I'm not sure if this applies in the context of an employment contract. Usually, liquidated damages clauses are in contracts where parties agree to a specific amount as damages. In an at-will setup, maybe the employer can impose fines as part of their policies.

Option I is about constructive conditions. A condition subsequent is something that, if it happens, the other party can end the contract. But here, the policy is a rule with penalties. However, constructive conditions can sometimes be excused if fulfilling them becomes impossible or impracticable. In this case, after being robbed at gunpoint, the woman was in a state of panic. She might argue that under such duress, she couldn't comply with the no-smoking policy, making it temporarily impracticable. So the condition (not smoking) was excused because of the extreme circumstances.

Alternatively, maybe the trauma made her unable to adhere, so the condition was impossible to fulfill, thus excusing her breach.

I think I is a stronger argument because it's based on the specific circumstances that made compliance impossible. C is about whether the fine is enforceable as a penalty, but in employment law, employers often have leeway to set such policies as long as they're not against public policy.

So the best answer is probably I.

The woman's best argument is that the nonsmoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused due to temporary impracticability. After being robbed at gunpoint, she was in a state of panic and collapsed, making compliance with the no-smoking policy impossible under the circumstances. This impossibility or impracticability excused her breach of the policy.
