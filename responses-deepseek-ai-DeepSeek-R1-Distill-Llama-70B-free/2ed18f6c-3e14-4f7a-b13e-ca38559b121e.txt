Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating the temperature change of a diatomic gas. Hmm, I remember that for gases, especially diatomic ones, the specific heat capacities are important. 

The problem gives me q as 65 J and w as 210 J. Wait, right, in thermodynamics, q is the heat added to the system, and w is the work done by the system. Oh wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? Because I think when the system does work on the surroundings, the work is positive, and when work is done on the system, it's negative. Or maybe it's the sign convention that's confusing me. Let me get this straight. The first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = q + w, but I think sometimes it's written as ΔU = q - w, depending on the convention for work. Oh right, sometimes w is the work done on the system, sometimes it's the work done by. So I need to clarify that.

Wait, the standard formula is ΔU = q - w, where w is the work done by the system. So, in this case, if the gas is expanding (doing work on the piston), then w is positive, and that means energy is leaving the system. So if q is positive, that's heat added to the system. 

So given q = 65 J and w = 210 J. So ΔU = q - w = 65 - 210 = -145 J. Oh wait, that's the change in internal energy. Now, I need to find the temperature change, which relates to the internal energy change.

For a diatomic gas, the molar specific heat at constant volume (Cv) is (5/2) R, right? Because diatomic gases have more degrees of freedom. Oh wait, monoatomic is (3/2) R, diatomic is (5/2) R for Cv. Wait, wait, no, maybe it's (7/2) R for diatomic at higher temps, but I think in this question, we might be assuming Cv is (5/2) R.

So the formula for the change in internal energy is ΔU = n Cv ΔT. Since n is 1 mole here, ΔU = (5/2) R ΔT.

Wait, R is the gas constant, which is about 8.314 J/mol·K. So we can set up the equation. 

We have ΔU as -145 J. So:

-145 J = (5/2) * R * ΔT.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that. R is 8.314, so (5/2)*8.314 is (5 * 8.314)/2. Let me compute that. 5 * 8 is 40, 5 * 0.314 is 1.57, so total is 41.57. Divided by 2 is 20.785 J/(mol·K). So:

ΔT = ΔU / ( (5/2) R ) = (-145) / 20.785 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 145 divided by 20.785. Let me do this step by step. 20 * 7 is 140, so 20.785 is approximately 20.8. 20.8 times 7 is 145.6. Oh wait, so 145 is about 7 times 20.8, but since it's negative, ΔT ≈ -7 K. So the temperature change is approximately -7 K. 

Looking at the options, option H is -7.0 K. Option I is approximately -6.98 K. Wait, but wait—I approximated R as 8.314. Let me do a more precise calculation.

ΔU = -145 J.

Cv = (5/2) R = (5/2)*8.314 = let me compute that accurately. 8.314 *5 = 41.57, divided by 2 is 20.785 J/(mol·K).

So ΔT = (-145) / (20.785) = let me compute this. 20.785 * 7 is 145.495. So 145 J is 7 times 20.785. But since ΔU is -145, then ΔT ≈ -7.0 K. But wait, exact calculation:

20.785 * x = 145 → x = 145 / 20.785. Let me compute 145 ÷ 20.785.

20.785 * 6 = 124.71 → subtract that from 145 → 145 - 124.71 = 20.29.

20.785 * 0.97 = approx 20.785*(1 - 0.03) → 20.785 - 0.62355 ≈ 20.161.

So 0.97 → 20.161, which is less than 20.29. So 0.97 gives 20.161, difference is 20.29-20.161=0.129. So how much more? 0.129 /20.785 per 0.01.

0.129 /20.785 ≈ 0.0062. So 0.97 + 0.0062 ≈ 0.9762. So 6.9762 → approximately 6.98.

Wait wait, no. Wait, 20.785 * x =145: x =145 / 20.785 = approx 6.98 (since 20.785 *6.98≈145). But since ΔU is negative, ΔT is -6.98 K.

So the correct answer would be approximately -6.98 K. Looking at the options, option I is -6.98 K. Option H is -7.0 K. So which one is correct?

Hmm, because I used exact calculation, it's about -6.98 K. So option I is the precise answer, but option H is the approximate. But wait, the way the problem is set up, perhaps the rounding is considered. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: -275J

B: -13.5K

C:13.5K

D:7.0K

E:65K

F:145J

G:210K

H: -7.0K

I: -6.98K

J:275J

So the exact calculation leads to approximately -6.98 K, so option I. But wait, some sources might round this to -7.0 K, which is option H. So which is correct?

Well, the exact value is approximately -6.98 K, so option I is the correct answer. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: using the formula again.

ΔU = q + w? Or q - w? Wait, no, I think the confusion comes from different sign conventions. Let me get this right.

The first law is ΔU = q - w, where w is the work done by the system. So if the system does work (expands), w is positive, so ΔU decreases.

So in this case, q is +65 J (heat added to the system), w is +210 J (work done by the system), so ΔU = 65 - 210 = -145 J. Correct.

Then, for diatomic gas, Cv is (5/2) R. So ΔU = n Cv ΔT → ΔT = ΔU / (n Cv). n=1, so ΔT = (-145) / [(5/2)*8.314] = (-145) / (20.785) ≈ -6.98 K. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option I: -6.98 K. But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check again. Oh wait, option I is -6.98 K. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but why is option H -7.0 K? Maybe because someone approximates R as 8.3 J/mol·K. Let me check with R=8.3.

So (5/2)*8.3 = 20.75.

ΔT = -145 / 20.75 ≈-145 /20.75 = Let me compute:

20.75 *7 = 145.25. So -145/20.75 ≈-6.99 K. So again, approximately -7 K. So perhaps depending on rounding, it's either -7.0 K or -6.98 K.

Looking at the options, both H and I are present. So which one is intended?

Wait, the question gives q as 65 J and w as 210 J. So perhaps it's expecting an exact calculation. Since 145 is exactly 20.785 * 6.98... So the precise value is -6.98 K.

So the correct option is I.
</think>

To calculate the temperature change of 1 mole of a diatomic gas, we use the first law of thermodynamics:

\[
\Delta U = q - w
\]

where \( q = 65 \, \text{J} \) (heat added to the system) and \( w = 210 \, \text{J} \) (work done by the system). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta U = 65 - 210 = -145 \, \text{J}.
\]

For a diatomic gas, the molar specific heat at constant volume is:

\[
C_v = \frac{5}{2} R,
\]

where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \). Substituting \( R \):

\[
C_v = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 8.314 = 20.785 \, \text{J/mol·K}.
\]

The relationship between the change in internal energy and temperature is:

\[
\Delta U = n C_v \Delta T,
\]

where \( n = 1 \, \text{mol} \). Solving for \( \Delta T \):

\[
\Delta T = \frac{\Delta U}{C_v} = \frac{-145}{20.785} \approx -6.98 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the temperature change is approximately \( -6.98 \, \text{K} \).
