Okay, so I've got this question about the due date for a federal estate tax return, Form 706. The taxpayer died on May 15, year 2, and no extension was requested. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules here, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that estate taxes have specific filing deadlines. I think the general rule is that the return is due nine months after the date of death. Oh wait, but waitâ€”tax returns are usually due on the 15th of the month, right? So if the person died on May 15, adding nine months would take us to February. Let me calculate that: May to February is... May has 31 days, so from May 15 to the end of May is 16 days. Then June 30 (30 days), July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 31, and then January 31. Wait, that's nine months. So May 15 plus nine months would be February 15 of the next year.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check that again. May is the 5th month. Adding nine months would bring us to February, which is the 2nd month of the next year. So 5 + 9 = 14, which is 14 months, meaning that's 2 months into the next year. So May 15, year 2, plus nine months would be February 15, year 3.

But wait, the options don't have February 15 as an option. Let me look back. The options are A through J, and option H is February 15, year 3. So that must be the answer.

Alternatively, I've heard that sometimes if the due date falls on a weekend or a holiday, it gets pushed to the next business day. But in this case, the question doesn't mention any such complications, so I think it's safe to assume the straightforward nine months.

So the correct due date would be February 15, year 3, which is option H.

The due date for a federal estate tax return (Form 706) when the taxpayer died on May 15, year 2, and no extension was requested, is nine months after the date of death. This brings the due date to February 15, year 3. 

Answer: H
