Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the naturalistic fallacy. I remember that the term is related to ethics and philosophy, specifically something about confusing what is natural with what is good. Let me think.

Moore, I think, discussed this in his work "Principia Ethica." From what I recall, the naturalistic fallacy is about incorrectly deriving an 'ought' from an 'is.' So, just because something is natural doesn't mean it's good. People often make the mistake of assuming that natural things are inherently good, but that's not necessarily true.

Looking at the options, option C says "everything that is natural is good." That sounds exactly like the fallacy Moore was talking about. So the naturalistic fallacy is the belief that whatever is natural is good. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check. Option D says "good is identical to a natural property." Hmm, that seems similar but not exactly the fallacy. The fallacy isn't just about good being a natural property, but the assumption that natural equals good. So I think C is the right one.

The naturalistic fallacy, as defined by Moore, occurs when it is assumed that because something is natural, it is therefore good. This aligns with option C.

Answer: C
