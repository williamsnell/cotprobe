Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Johnson Supply Company and their overhead distribution. Hmm, let me read it again. They have $3,160 of overhead, and they distribute it based on square feet occupied. The departments and their areas are listed, and I need to find out how much each is charged. The options are from A to J.

Alright, so the first thing I think I should do is figure out the total square footage. Let me add up the areas of all the departments. The Raw Materials department is 2,500 sq. ft., Manufacturing is 5,000, Storage is 2,000, and Administrative is 500. So adding those together: 2500 + 5000 is 7500, plus 2000 is 9500, and then plus 500 makes 10,000 square feet total. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. 2500 +5000 is 7500, plus 2000 is 9500, then 500 more is 10,000. Yep, that's right.

So the total overhead is $3,160, and it's distributed based on the area each department occupies. So I guess each department's share is their area divided by the total area, multiplied by the total overhead. So the formula for each would be (department_area / total_area) * total_overhead.

Let me break it down for each department.

Starting with Raw Materials: 2,500 sq. ft. So 2500 divided by 10,000 is 0.25. Multiply that by 3160. 0.25 * 3160 is... let's see, 3160 divided by 4 is 790. So Raw Materials would be charged $790.

Next, Manufacturing is 5,000 sq. ft. 5000/10000 is 0.5. 0.5 * 3160 is 1580. So Manufacturing gets $1,580.

Then Storage is 2,000 sq. ft. 2000/10000 is 0.2. 0.2 * 3160 is 632. So Storage is $632.

Lastly, Administrative is 500 sq. ft. 500/10000 is 0.05. 0.05 * 3160 is... 3160 * 0.05 is 158. So Administrative is $158.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For Raw Materials: 2500 /10000 is 1/4, so 3160/4 is 790. Correct. Manufacturing is half, so 3160/2 is 1580. Correct. Storage is 2000/10000 is 1/5, 3160 * 0.2 is 632. Right. Administrative is 500/10000 is 1/20, 3160 * 0.05 is 158. Yep, that's correct.

Now I need to look at the options. The correct amounts are: Raw Materials $790, Manufacturing $1580, Storage $632, Administrative $158.

Looking at the options:

Option F says: $790, $1580, $632, $158. That matches exactly. Let me just glance through the other options to make sure none of them match.

Option A is lower on Raw Materials, higher on Admin. No. Option C has $800, which is higher than 790. So not that. Option F is the only one that matches the calculated numbers.

To determine the amount of overhead charged to each department, we start by calculating the total square footage of all departments. Adding the areas together:  
2,500 (Raw Materials) + 5,000 (Manufacturing) + 2,000 (Storage) + 500 (Administrative) = 10,000 sq. ft.  

The total overhead of $3,160 is distributed proportionally based on the square footage of each department. The formula used is:  
\[
\text{Overhead Charge} = \left( \frac{\text{Department Area}}{\text{Total Area}} \right) \times \text{Total Overhead}
\]

1. **Raw Materials (2,500 sq. ft.):**  
   \[
   \left( \frac{2,500}{10,000} \right) \times 3,160 = 0.25 \times 3,160 = 790
   \]

2. **Manufacturing (5,000 sq. ft.):**  
   \[
   \left( \frac{5,000}{10,000} \right) \times 3,160 = 0.5 \times 3,160 = 1,580
   \]

3. **Storage (2,000 sq. ft.):**  
   \[
   \left( \frac{2,000}{10,000} \right) \times 3,160 = 0.2 \times 3,160 = 632
   \]

4. **Administrative (500 sq. ft.):**  
   \[
   \left( \frac{500}{10,000} \right) \times 3,160 = 0.05 \times 3,160 = 158
   \]

The calculated amounts are:  
- Raw Materials: $790  
- Manufacturing: $1,580  
- Storage: $632  
- Administrative: $158  

Comparing these values with the options provided, **Option F** matches exactly.  

**Answer: F**
