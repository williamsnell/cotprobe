Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a person is standing on a scale in an elevator, and the scale reading is less than his usual weight. So I need to figure out what the elevator's motion could be for this to happen.

Hmm, I remember that when you're in an elevator, your apparent weight can change based on the elevator's acceleration. Oh right, weight is related to the normal force, which depends on the acceleration of the elevator.

Wait, the usual weight is mg, where m is mass and g is gravity. So when the scale shows less than usual, his apparent weight is lower. So the normal force N is less than mg.

I think the formula is N = m(g + a), where a is the acceleration. Wait, no, wait. If the elevator is accelerating upward, the normal force increases, making you feel heavier. If it's accelerating downward, the normal force decreases, making you feel lighter.

Wait, so if N is less than mg, that would mean that the acceleration a is downward, right? Because N = m(g - a) in that case. But wait, no, I think I should think about it as N = m(g + a_elevator), but depending on the direction of acceleration.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the direction of the elevator's acceleration. Let me clarify: when the elevator accelerates upward, the apparent weight increases. When it accelerates downward, the apparent weight decreases. And if it's moving at constant speed, then a is zero, so N = mg, which is the usual weight.

So the scale reading is less than usual, meaning N < mg. So the elevator must be accelerating downward. Or is it moving downward with some acceleration?

Wait, but wait. The elevator could be moving downward with an acceleration less than g, but the direction is downward. Alternatively, it could be moving upward but decelerating, which effectively is an acceleration downward.

Wait, no. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. So if the elevator is moving upward and slowing down, that's a negative acceleration, which is effectively an acceleration downward. So that would make the apparent weight less than mg.

Wait, so what are the options? Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Moving in circular motion. Hmm, circular motion would mean centripetal acceleration, but I'm not sure how that applies here. Unless the elevator is moving in a circle, but that's probably not the case in a typical elevator scenario. So maybe this isn't the right choice.

Option B: Moving upward and speeding up. So acceleration is upward. That would make N = m(g + a), so N > mg. But the scale shows less, so B is not correct.

Option C: Moving upward at constant speed. Then a=0, N=mg. But the scale is less, so C is not correct.

Option D: Moving downward at constant speed. Then a=0 again, so N=mg. So D isn't the answer.

Option E: Stationary at top floor. Then a=0, N=mg. So E is out.

Option F: Stationary at bottom. Same as E, a=0, so F is out.

Option G: Moving upward and slowing down. So the velocity is upward, but acceleration is downward because it's slowing. So a is negative. So N = m(g + a) where a is negative. So N = m(g - |a|). So that would make N less than mg. So G is a possibility.

Option H: Moving sideways. Hmm, that's perpendicular to the direction of gravity. Wait, but the scale measures the normal force in the vertical direction. If the elevator moves sideways, that's horizontal, but the person's weight is vertical. So would moving sideways affect the vertical normal force? I don't think so, unless there's some tilt or acceleration in the vertical direction. So H probably doesn't affect the scale reading.

Option I: Moving downward and slowing down. So the velocity is downward, but the acceleration is upward because it's slowing (decelerating). So a is upward. So N = m(g + a), which would make N larger than mg. But the scale is showing less, so I is not correct.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I mixed up the signs.

Wait, when the elevator accelerates upward, the apparent weight increases. When it accelerates downward, the apparent weight decreases.

So in the case of the elevator moving upward and slowing down, the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the velocity, i.e., downward. So a is downward. So N would be less than mg. So that's option G.

Alternatively, if the elevator is moving downward and speeding up, that's acceleration downward, so N < mg. Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is moving upward and speeding up (so a upward, N>mg).

Option I is moving downward and slowing down (so a upward, N>mg).

Wait, no, perhaps I confused the options.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option I says "it is moving downward and slowing down." So when moving downward and slowing down, the acceleration is upward because the speed is decreasing in the downward direction. So a is upward.

So N = m(g + a), which would make N greater than mg. So scale reading would be higher, which doesn't fit the question.

So the correct scenario is when the elevator's acceleration is downward. So when is that happening?

When the elevator is moving upward and slowing down: velocity up, acceleration down.

Or when the elevator is moving downward and speeding up: velocity down, acceleration down.

Wait, but let me think about that.

Wait, if the elevator is moving downward and speeding up, then the acceleration is downward. So a is downward, so N = m(g - a), which is less than mg.

But looking at the options, is there such an option?

Let me check the options again.

Option B: moving upward and speeding up (a up, N>mg). No.

Option I: moving downward and slowing down (a up, N>mg). No.

Wait, so the options I have are G and perhaps something else. Let me see.

Wait, the options given are:

A: circular motion.

B: upward and speeding up.

C: upward at constant speed.

D: downward at constant speed.

E: stationary top.

F: stationary bottom.

G: upward and slowing.

H: sideways.

I: downward and slowing.

So from earlier analysis, G (up and slowing) has a downward acceleration, so N < mg. That fits.

Another option could be if the elevator is moving downward and speeding up, which would have a downward acceleration, but is that any of the options?

Looking at the options, no. Because option I is moving down and slowing, which has upward acceleration.

Wait, what about if the elevator is moving downward at an increasing speed (speeding up downward), then acceleration is downward, which would make N < mg. But none of the options say that. The options are only up to I, which is moving down and slowing.

Wait, so the possible correct answers are G and any other that implies a downward acceleration.

Looking back, the only option that gives a downward acceleration is G: moving up and slowing. Because when you move up and slow, acceleration is opposite to velocity, so acceleration is down.

Alternatively, if the elevator starts moving downward from rest, but that's not one of the options. Because option D is moving down at constant speed, which a=0, so N=mg.

So, the only option that gives a downward acceleration is G: moving upward and slowing down.

Wait, but what about option A: moving in circular motion. How would that affect weight?

In circular motion, there's a centripetal acceleration towards the center of the circle. But in an elevator, that would require moving in a circle, which is not typical. If the elevator is moving in a circular path with acceleration a towards the center, then the apparent weight would be N = m(g - a) if the circle is in the horizontal plane. Wait, no, if the elevator is moving in a horizontal circle, the centripetal acceleration is horizontal, but the scale measures vertical normal force.

Wait, if the elevator is moving in a vertical circle, like a roller coaster loop, then that's different. But that's probably beyond the scope here. The question doesn't mention anything about circular motion, so I think option A is not the intended answer.

So, the correct answer must be G: moving upward and slowing down.

Wait, but what about if the elevator is in free fall? Then the apparent weight would be zero. But that's not any of the options.

So, putting it all together, the scale reads less than usual when the elevator's acceleration is downward. So the elevator is either moving upward and slowing down (G) or moving downward and speeding up (but that's not an option here).

So among the options, G is possible.
</think>

When a person stands on a scale in an elevator and the scale reading is less than their usual weight, it indicates that the apparent weight is reduced. Apparent weight is determined by the normal force, which depends on the elevator's acceleration. The relationship is given by:

\[
N = m(g + a)
\]

where \( N \) is the normal force (apparent weight), \( m \) is the person's mass, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( a \) is the elevator's acceleration. If \( a \) is upward, the apparent weight increases (\( N > mg \)). If \( a \) is downward, the apparent weight decreases (\( N < mg \)).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: Moving in circular motion**  
   Circular motion involves centripetal acceleration, but this is typically horizontal and does not directly affect the vertical normal force. This is unlikely to explain the reduced weight.

2. **Option B: Moving upward and speeding up**  
   If the elevator is moving upward and speeding up, the acceleration is upward (\( a > 0 \)), which increases the apparent weight (\( N > mg \)). This does not match the condition of reduced weight.

3. **Option C: Moving upward at a constant speed**  
   If the elevator is moving at a constant speed, the acceleration is zero (\( a = 0 \)), so the apparent weight equals the usual weight (\( N = mg \)). This does not explain the reduced weight.

4. **Option D: Moving downward at a constant speed**  
   Similar to Option C, if the elevator is moving downward at a constant speed, the acceleration is zero (\( a = 0 \)), so the apparent weight equals the usual weight (\( N = mg \)). This does not explain the reduced weight.

5. **Option E: Stationary at the top floor**  
   If the elevator is stationary, the acceleration is zero (\( a = 0 \)), so the apparent weight equals the usual weight (\( N = mg \)). This does not explain the reduced weight.

6. **Option F: Stationary at the bottom floor**  
   If the elevator is stationary, the acceleration is zero (\( a = 0 \)), so the apparent weight equals the usual weight (\( N = mg \)). This does not explain the reduced weight.

7. **Option G: Moving upward and slowing down**  
   If the elevator is moving upward and slowing down, the acceleration is downward (\( a < 0 \)), which decreases the apparent weight (\( N < mg \)). This matches the condition of reduced weight.

8. **Option H: Moving sideways**  
   Sideways motion involves horizontal acceleration, which does not affect the vertical normal force. This does not explain the reduced weight.

9. **Option I: Moving downward and slowing down**  
   If the elevator is moving downward and slowing down, the acceleration is upward (\( a > 0 \)), which increases the apparent weight (\( N > mg \)). This does not match the condition of reduced weight.

### Conclusion:
The only scenario that explains the reduced weight is when the elevator is moving upward and slowing down, as this results in a downward acceleration, reducing the apparent weight.
