Question:

Would you expect the transfer RNA molecules and the messenger RNA molecules to be the same in the cells of a horse as in similar human cells? Give reasons for your answer in each case.

Options:

A: tRNA from cells of horse and man are basically the same, whereas the mRNA from the cells of these two animals would show much more difference.
B: tRNA molecules show slight variations between horse and human cells, while mRNA molecules are identical.
C: tRNA and mRNA in horse and human cells are completely identical.
D: Both tRNA and mRNA molecules in horse and human cells vary significantly in their nucleotide sequences.
E: tRNA molecules in horse cells contain different amino acids compared to human cells, while mRNA molecules are highly conserved.
F: tRNA molecules in both horse and human cells are similar in function but differ in their nucleotide sequences, whereas mRNA molecules have identical sequences but differ in function.
G: tRNA in horse and human cells are different, but mRNA are the same.
H: tRNA molecules are completely different between horse and human cells, but mRNA molecules are similar.
I: tRNA and mRNA in horse and human cells are completely different.
J: The anticodon regions of tRNA are different in horses compared to humans, but the rest of the tRNA structure is the same, and mRNA molecules are completely identical.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about tRNA and mRNA in horse and human cells. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that RNA plays a big role in protein synthesis. Let me think.

First, I know that tRNA stands for transfer RNA. Its job is to carry amino acids to the ribosome during translation. Each tRNA has an anticodon loop that matches the mRNA's codons. But wait, humans and horses are different species, so their DNA must be different. Does that mean their tRNA would be different too?

Well, tRNA molecules are responsible for bringing specific amino acids. But the genetic code is almost universal, right? So the codons for amino acids are mostly the same across species. So maybe the tRNA anticodons wouldn't differ much. But wait, the actual structure of tRNA might have some variations. Or perhaps they're similar because the function is so crucial and conserved.

Now, mRNA is messenger RNA. It carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosome. The sequence of mRNA is complementary to DNA. Since horses and humans have different DNA sequences for many genes, their mRNA sequences for corresponding proteins would differ. But wait, for some genes that are conserved, maybe the mRNA is similar. But overall, I think mRNA would show more differences because the genetic information varies.

So, tRNA might be more similar because the genetic code is the same, but mRNA would differ because the genes differ between species. So the answer would be that tRNA is similar, mRNA differs.

Looking at the options, option A says tRNA same, mRNA different. That fits my reasoning. Let me double-check the options.

Option A: tRNA same, mRNA differ. Yes, that's what I thought. Other options don't fit. Like option D says both vary a lot, but I don't think tRNA varies as much. Option G says tRNA different, mRNA same, which is opposite.

So I think the answer is A.

The question asks whether transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules in horse and human cells are the same. tRNA is responsible for translating mRNA codons into amino acids during protein synthesis, relying on the genetic code, which is nearly universal across species. This suggests that tRNA molecules are highly conserved and similar between horses and humans. On the other hand, mRNA sequences are transcribed from DNA and reflect the genetic differences between species. Since horses and humans have distinct DNA, their mRNA sequences for corresponding genes will differ. 

Option A aligns with this reasoning: tRNA molecules are basically the same due to the conserved genetic code, while mRNA molecules show more differences because they reflect species-specific genetic variation.

Answer: A
