Question:

A developer recently acquired a large vacant lot and wished to build a series of 10 tract homes on the lot to offer for sale. On May 1, he telephoned a number of contractors whom he had dealt with in the past and asked them to submit bids to build the homes. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. He notified each subcontractor that he intended to use their bids in submitting a general bid to the developer. A plumber submitted a bid to the contractor in the amount of $50,000, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the developer. On June 1, the contractor submitted a bid to the developer in which he offered to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. On June 4, the plumber notified the contractor that he had overbooked his crews and could not possibly do the work on the developer's job. On June 5, the developer sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein he stated, "I hereby accept your offer to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. ', Thereafter, the contractor hired another plumber to complete the plumbing work at a cost of $60,000. The contractor then explained the situation to the developer and requested that the overall cost of the job be increased to $510,000. The developer refused on the grounds that he had a contract for $500,000 and that this was the contractor's problem. The contractor then built the 10 tract homes, and the developer sent him a check for $500,000. Which of the following best supports a claim for $10,000 by the contractor against the plumber who refused to do the work?

Options:

A: The plumber's bid created an enforceable promissory estoppel situation.
B: An option contract was created, because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.
C: The plumber had an implied contract with the contractor, which he violated by refusing to fulfill his bid.
D: The plumber had a moral obligation to fulfill his bid as it was already included in the contractor's total cost.
E: The contractor relied on the plumber's bid in good faith, creating an enforceable contract.
F: The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.
G: The plumber's bid was a binding contract, which the plumber breached by refusing to do the work.
H: The contractor made an offer to the plumber that the plumber accepted when he submitted his bid.
I: The plumber's bid was a "firm offer" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants.
J: The plumber's bid constituted a unilateral contract which the contractor accepted by submitting his bid to the developer.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with bids and subcontractors. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

So the scenario is a developer wants to build 10 tract homes and contacts several contractors. One of those contractors gets bids from subcontractors to figure out his total cost. The plumber in question submits a bid of $50k, which the contractor uses in his own bid to the developer. Then, on June 1, the contractor offers to build the homes for $500k. The developer accepts this offer on June 5. But before that, on June 4, the plumber says he can't do the job because he's overbooked. The contractor has to hire another plumber for $60k, so he asks the developer for an extra $10k, which the developer refuses. Now, the contractor is trying to get that $10k from the original plumber.

The question is about which option best supports the contractor's claim against the plumber. So, I need to figure out the legal theory here.

I remember that when someone asks for bids, the bid can sometimes be considered an offer. But in many cases, bids are considered invitations to treat unless there's something that makes them binding. So, the key is whether the plumber's bid was an offer that the contractor accepted, or if it's just an invitation.

Wait, but in this case, the contractor told the subcontractors he intended to use their bids in his general bid. Does that change things? Oh right, there's a concept called promissory estoppel where a bid can be enforced if the person asking relied on it to their detriment.

Also, I think about the idea of firm offers. Under the UCC, merchants can make firm offers that can't be revoked for a certain period. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the plumber is a subcontractor, maybe not a merchant in the same sense as a seller of goods.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Promissory estoppel. So, the plumber made a bid, the contractor relied on it by including it in his bid, and now the plumber can't back out because the contractor relied. That sounds plausible.

Option B: Option contract. That would require some consideration to keep the offer open. The plumber didn't give anything, so maybe not.

Option C: Implied contract. I'm not sure about that. Implied contracts require mutual intent, and the plumber's bid was just a bid, not necessarily an acceptance.

Option D: Moral obligation. That's not a legal argument, so it doesn't hold in court.

Option E: Reliance creates a contract. This sounds similar to A, but I think promissory estoppel is more specific.

Option F: Offer accepted by using the bid. Wait, if the plumber's bid is an offer, then the contractor's use of it would be an acceptance. But I thought that bids are usually invitations, not offers, unless stated otherwise.

Option G: Binding contract through bid. Again, unless it's a firm offer, I don't think the bid is binding.

Option H: Contractor made an offer? No, the plumber submitted the bid, which would be the offer.

Option I: Firm offer. If both are merchants, under UCC 2-205, a firm offer can't be revoked. If the plumber is a merchant, this could apply. But is the plumber a merchant? Well, contractors and subcontractors in their usual course of business might qualify as merchants. So if the plumber made a firm offer, and the contractor relied, then the offer couldn't be revoked. But the question is whether the plumber's bid was a firm offer.

Option J: Unilateral contract. I don't think so because the acceptance isn't an action here but rather using the bid.

So, between A and I. If the plumber's bid was a firm offer, then I would apply. But I'm not sure if the plumber is a merchant. Assuming he is, then I would be the right answer. But if not, then A would be better because promissory estoppel doesn't require merchant status.

Wait, but in the scenario, the contractor told the subcontractors he intended to use their bids. So the plumber knew his bid would be used in the contractor's bid to the developer. That seems like a situation where promissory estoppel applies because the contractor relied on the bid when submitting his own, and the plumber should have expected that reliance.

So, A says the plumber's bid created a promissory estoppel situation. That seems to fit because the contractor relied on it to his detriment, and the plumber can't just back out.

But wait, option I says it's a firm offer because both are merchants. If that's the case, then under UCC, the plumber can't revoke the offer. But does the bid count as a firm offer? Also, the time frame matters. The offer was made in May, and the revocation happened in June. If the firm offer is irrevocable for a reasonable time or as specified, then it might still be in effect.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. I think promissory estoppel (A) is a possible answer, but if the firm offer applies (I), that's another route.

Wait, I remember that a firm offer under UCC 2-205 requires that the offer be in writing and signed, and it must have a specified irrevocability period or, if not specified, it's irrevocable for a reasonable time. The plumber's bid was verbal, I think, since he just submitted it over the phone. So without a written signed offer, it's not a firm offer. So option I wouldn't apply because the bid wasn't in writing. Therefore, A would be the better choice.

So, the correct answer would be A: The plumber's bid created an enforceable promissory estoppel situation.

Another angle: Did the contractor accept the plumber's offer? Because if the plumber's bid was an offer, and the contractor used it, is that acceptance? Or is it just reliance?

In contract law, an offer can be accepted by performance or by notification. But in this case, the contractor didn't notify the plumber of acceptance; he just used the bid. So maybe it's not an acceptance but rather reliance, which is more about promissory estoppel.

Therefore, the correct option is A.
</think>

The question revolves around contract law principles, specifically whether the plumber's bid created a legally enforceable obligation. The contractor relied on the plumber's bid of $50,000 when submitting his own bid to the developer for $500,000. When the plumber later refused to perform, the contractor incurred an additional $10,000 cost by hiring another plumber. The issue is determining which legal theory best supports the contractor's claim against the plumber.

### Key Analysis of Options:

- **Option A**: Promissory estoppel applies when a party makes a promise that another party relies on to their detriment. Here, the plumber's bid was used by the contractor in submitting his bid to the developer, creating reliance. This fits the elements of promissory estoppel, making this a strong option.

- **Option B**: An option contract requires consideration to keep an offer open. There is no indication of consideration here, so this is not applicable.

- **Option C**: An implied contract requires mutual intent to be bound. The plumber's bid was merely a bid, not an acceptance of terms, so this does not apply.

- **Option D**: Moral obligation is not a legal basis for enforcing a contract, so this is irrelevant.

- **Option E**: While reliance is a factor, this option is less specific than promissory estoppel, which directly addresses the situation.

- **Option F**: For the plumber's bid to be considered an offer accepted by the contractor, the contractor would need to have clearly accepted it. Instead, the contractor merely relied on it, making this option incorrect.

- **Option G**: A binding contract requires mutual assent, which is absent here. The plumber's bid was not a binding contract unless specific conditions (e.g., firm offer) apply.

- **Option H**: The contractor did not make an offer; the plumber did. This option misrepresents the roles.

- **Option I**: A firm offer under UCC § 2-205 requires a written, signed offer. The plumber's bid was verbal, so this does not apply.

- **Option J**: A unilateral contract requires performance as acceptance, which is not the case here.

### Conclusion:
The best legal theory is **promissory estoppel**. The plumber's bid was relied upon by the contractor to his detriment, and the plumber should have anticipated this reliance. This makes **Option A** the correct choice.

**Answer: A**
