Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a racing car moving in a circular path at a constant speed. The speed is given as 120 miles per hour, and the radius of the track is 1000 feet. The question is asking what acceleration the center of gravity of the car exhibits, and there are multiple-choice options provided.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when an object moves in a circular path at a constant speed, it's experiencing centripetal acceleration. Oh wait, but wait—the key here is that the speed is constant. So, is the car accelerating? Because in circular motion, even at constant speed, there's acceleration directed towards the center.

Wait, but wait another thing. Centripetal acceleration is a type of acceleration, right? Because acceleration is the change in velocity over time, and velocity has both magnitude and direction. So even if the speed (which is the magnitude of velocity) is constant, the direction is changing, which means there's acceleration.

So the car is moving in a circle, so it must have centripetal acceleration. That would mean the acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle.

But the question is about the magnitude of that acceleration. So I need to calculate the centripetal acceleration. The formula for centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r, where v is the speed and r is the radius of the circular path.

Wait, but I have to make sure the units are consistent. The speed is given in miles per hour, and the radius is in feet. So I need to convert either the speed to feet per second or the radius to miles, but since the answer options are in various units, I think converting the speed to feet per second would be better.

Let me think: 120 miles per hour. There are 5280 feet in a mile and 3600 seconds in an hour. So to convert miles per hour to feet per second, I multiply by 5280/3600.

So 120 * (5280/3600) = let's compute that. 5280 divided by 3600 is... let's see, 5280/3600 = (528 ÷ 36) / 100? Wait, 5280 ÷ 3600. Let me compute it step by step.

Well, 5280 ÷ 3600 = (5280 ÷ 10) ÷ (3600 ÷ 10) )= 528 ÷ 360. 528 ÷ 360 is 1.46666... So approximately 1.4667. So 120 * 1.4667 equals about 176 feet per second.

Wait, let me check that calculation again because that seems high. Wait, 120 miles per hour is a high speed, but 176 ft/s is extremely high. Wait, wait, I must have messed up the calculation.

Wait, 5280 feet in a mile, 3600 seconds in an hour. So 1 mile per hour is 5280/3600 ft/s. Let me compute 5280 ÷ 3600. 3600 goes into 5280 once, with 1680 remaining. 1680 is 0.46666... times 3600. So 5280/3600 is 1.46666... So 1.46666 ft/s per mph. So 120 mph is 120 * 1.46666 ft/s.

Let me compute 120 * 1.46666. 120 * 1 = 120, 120 * 0.46666 = approximately 56. So 120 + 56 = 176. So yeah, 176 ft/s. That's correct.

So the speed v is 176 ft/s, the radius r is 1000 ft. So centripetal acceleration a = v² / r.

Calculating v squared: 176 * 176. Let's compute that. 170^2 is 28900, and 6^2 is 36, and the cross term is 2*170*6=2040. So (170+6)^2 = 28900 + 2040 +36 = 28900+2076=30976. So v squared is 30976.

Then a = 30976 / 1000 = 30.976 ft/s². Oh wait, that's approximately 30.98 ft/s². Looking at the options, option H is 30.98 ft/s². So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the options. The question is asking, what if any acceleration does the center of gravity exhibit? So the acceleration is centripetal, which is non-zero because the car is moving in a circle. So the answer should be H:30.98 ft/s².

Looking at the options again: H is 30.98. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but another thought: the car is moving at a constant speed. So its tangential acceleration is zero, but the centripetal (normal) acceleration is non-zero. So the net acceleration is just the centripetal component, which is what I calculated. So yeah, the correct answer is H.

To determine the acceleration exhibited by the center of gravity of the car, we analyze the situation. The car is moving in a circular path at a constant speed of 120 miles per hour, with a radius of 1000 feet. Since the speed is constant, the car does not have tangential acceleration, but it does experience centripetal acceleration due to the change in the direction of its velocity.

The formula for centripetal acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
\]

where \(v\) is the speed and \(r\) is the radius of the circular path. To use this formula, the units must be consistent. The speed is given in miles per hour, so it is converted to feet per second. Using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{mile/hr} = \frac{5280}{3600} \, \text{ft/s}\), we calculate:

\[
v = 120 \, \text{miles/hr} \times \frac{5280}{3600} \, \text{ft/s per mile/hr} = 176 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

Substituting \(v = 176 \, \text{ft/s}\) and \(r = 1000 \, \text{ft}\) into the formula:

\[
a = \frac{176^2}{1000} = \frac{30976}{1000} = 30.976 \, \text{ft/s}^2.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the centripetal acceleration is approximately \(30.98 \, \text{ft/s}^2\).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 30.98 ft/s².**

This is the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration experienced by the center of gravity of the car.
