Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about thermal conductivities and collisional cross sections of gases. Hmm, I remember thermal conductivity is related to how well a substance can conduct heat, and for gases, it probably has to do with the motion of the molecules. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The question gives me the thermal conductivities of acetylene (C₂H₂) and nitrogen (N₂) at the same temperature and pressure. Acetylene's conductivity is 0.01866 J K⁻¹ m⁻¹ s⁻¹, and N₂ is 0.0240 J K⁻¹ m⁻¹ s⁻¹. I need to find the ratio of their collisional cross sections.

Wait, collisional cross section... right, that's a measure of the effective area that a molecule presents during a collision. So, bigger molecules would have a larger cross section, right? Because they're larger, they're more likely to collide.

I think the formula for thermal conductivity (κ) of a gas is given by the Eucken formula or something similar. Let me recall. Oh right, κ is proportional to the mean free path (λ), the average molecular speed (v), the heat capacity at constant volume (Cv), and the number density (n). But wait, maybe another approach is better here.

Oh wait, the thermal conductivity for monatomic gases is given by κ = (1/3) * n * v * λ * Cv. But wait, both acetylene and N₂ are diatomic or polyatomic? No, wait, N₂ is diatomic, as is acetylene. Wait, but I'm not sure if that affects the formula directly.

Alternatively, I remember that thermal conductivity is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass for monatomic gases, but that's probably the thermal diffusion part, not conductivity. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: kinetic theory tells us that thermal conductivity depends on properties like the mean free path, the speed of the molecules, and their specific heat capacities. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the collisional cross section (σ) and the number density (n), because λ = 1/(√2 n σ). So if pressure is the same, n is proportional to 1/P, but since pressure is 1 atm for both, n is same for both gases at same T and P? Wait, no, because n is determined by PV=NRT. Since they're at the same P and T, n is same for both. So the number density n is same for both gases. So any differences in λ would be due to differences in σ.

Wait, but thermal conductivity also depends on the average molecular speed. The average speed is proportional to sqrt( (8 R T) / (π M) ), where M is the molar mass. So, higher molar mass means lower average speed.

So putting it all together, the thermal conductivity κ is proportional to (v * λ * Cv). Let's see.

Wait, but for diatomic gases, the molar specific heat at constant volume Cv is different. Acetylene is C₂H₂, which is a linear molecule, I think. At room temperature, diatomic gases have Cv = (5/2) R, and polyatomic maybe have higher. No, wait, no, Cv for diatomic is (5/2) R at room temp because they can rotate. Wait, acetylene is a linear triatomic molecule? Or is it diatomic? No, acetylene is C₂H₂, so it's a four-atom molecule, but arranged linearly as HC≡CH. So it's a linear molecule, which I think has the same degrees of freedom as a diatomic in some treatments, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the general formula for thermal conductivity. For a gas, the thermal conductivity κ can be approximated as κ = (5/2) η Cv / m, where η is the viscosity? Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I remember that thermal conductivity is related to viscosity, but perhaps that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, I think κ is proportional to (v * λ * Cv), and since v is the average speed, λ is the mean free path, and Cv is molar specific heat at constant volume.

Wait, but considering the same temperature and pressure, number density n is the same for both gases. So n is same. So λ is inversely proportional to σ, because λ = 1/(√2 n σ). So λ ∝ 1/σ.

The average speed v is sqrt( (8 R T) / (π M) ), where M is molar mass. So v ∝ 1 / sqrt(M).

Cv is the molar specific heat at constant volume. For diatomic gases, Cv is (5/2) R. For acetylene, which is a linear molecule, maybe it's also considered as having similar degrees of freedom? Or perhaps it's treated as a rigid rotor, so maybe it has a higher Cv. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact value.

Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that the specific heat capacities are the same? No, probably not, because that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the ratio of the thermal conductivities is determined by the ratio of the product of mean free path and velocity, because perhaps the specific heat terms cancel out or are similar. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the fact that thermal conductivity is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass times the collisional cross section. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for thermal conductivity. Oh wait, I can't look things up right now. I have to rely on my memory.

Wait, thermal conductivity κ for a gas is given by κ = (1/3) * n * v * λ * C_v, where C_v is molar specific heat at constant volume. Since n is the same for both gases (same P and T), the ratio κ1/κ2 would be (v1 λ1 C_v1) / (v2 λ2 C_v2).

So, let me write that as κ1/κ2 = (v1/v2) * (λ1/λ2) * (C_v1/C_v2).

We can compute each part.

First, compute v1/v2. The average speed v is sqrt( (8 R T)/(π M) ), so v1/v2 = sqrt( M2 / M1 ). Because T is same.

M1 is molar mass of acetylene (C₂H₂). Carbon is 12 g/mol, H is 1. So M1 = 2*12 + 2*1 = 24 +2=26 g/mol.

M2 is molar mass of N₂. Nitrogen is 14 g/mol, so M2=28 g/mol.

So v1/v2 = sqrt(28 / 26) = sqrt(14/13) ≈ sqrt(1.0769) ≈ 1.0377.

Next, λ1/λ2. Since λ = 1/(√2 n σ), and n is same for both, λ1/λ2 = σ2 / σ1.

So the ratio (λ1/λ2) is (σ2 / σ1).

Wait, because λ is inversely proportional to σ, so if σ is larger, λ is smaller.

So putting it together, λ1/λ2 = (σ2)/(σ1).

Now, the third term is C_v1/C_v2. What's the specific heat at constant volume for each gas?

Acetylene is a linear molecule, so it's like a diatomic. Diatomic gases have Cv = (5/2) R. Nitrogen is diatomic as well, so Cv for N2 is (5/2) R.

Wait, wait, but wait. No, wait. Acetylene is C₂H₂, a four-atom molecule, but linear, so perhaps it has more degrees of freedom. Wait, no. For a linear molecule, the rotational degrees of freedom are 2, like diatomic. So at room temperature, the specific heat for both would be similar. So perhaps their Cv is the same. So C_v1/C_v2 = 1.

Alternatively, if the problem assumes that the specific heat capacities are the same, then that term is 1.

So putting it all together:

κ1/κ2 = (v1/v2) * (σ2/σ1) * (C_v1/C_v2 )

Assuming C_v1/C_v2 =1,

κ1/κ2 = (v1/v2) * (σ2/σ1 )

We can rearrange to find (σ1/σ2) = (v1/v2) * (κ1/κ2 )^{-1} * (σ2/σ1)^{-1} Wait no, perhaps better to solve for σ1/σ2.

Wait, let's rearrange the equation.

We have:

κ1/κ2 = (v1/v2) * (σ2/σ1 )

We can write:

(σ1/σ2) = (v1/v2) * (κ2/κ1 )

Because:

κ1/κ2 = (v1/v2) * (σ2/σ1 )

=> (σ2/σ1) = (κ1/κ2) * (v2/v1 )

Taking reciprocal,

σ1/σ2 = (v1/v2) * (κ2/κ1 )

Yes, correct.

So,

σ_ratio = σ1/σ2 = (v1/v2) * (κ2/κ1 )

We have v1/v2 = sqrt(M2/M1) = sqrt(28/26) ≈ sqrt(1.0769) ≈ 1.0377.

κ2 is N2's conductivity, which is 0.0240.

κ1 is acetylene's, 0.01866.

So κ2/κ1 = 0.0240 / 0.01866 ≈ let's compute that.

0.024 / 0.01866 ≈ 1.2857.

So, 1.0377 * 1.2857 ≈ Let's calculate that.

1.0377 * 1.2857 ≈ 

1 * 1.2857 = 1.2857.

0.0377 * 1.2857 ≈ approximately 0.0485.

So total ≈ 1.2857 + 0.0485 = 1.3342.

Wait, but wait, let's do it more accurately.

0.0240 / 0.01866 = let me compute exact.

0.0240 / 0.01866 = 240 / 186.6 ≈ let's compute 240 ÷ 186.6.

Well, 186.6 * 1 = 186.6, 186.6 * 1.28 ≈ 186.6 *1=186.6, 186.6 * 0.28 = 52.248; so 186.6 +52.248=238.848. Close to 240.

So 1.2857 is accurate, since 186.6 * (24/20.66) → wait, perhaps I should compute it as 240 / 186.6.

240 ÷ 186.6 ≈ 1.286 approximately.

So 1.0377 * 1.286 ≈ let's compute:

1 * 1.286 = 1.286.

0.0377 * 1.286 = let's see, 0.03 *1.286=0.03858, 0.0077 *1.286≈0.00990. So total ≈0.03858 +0.00990≈0.04848.

So total 1.286 +0.04848≈1.3345.

So σ1/σ2 ≈ 1.3345.

Wait, but wait. The question asks for the ratio of the collisional cross section of acetylene relative to N₂. So that's σ1/σ2. So approximately 1.3345.

Looking at the options:

E is 1.33, which is very close to our calculation.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the formula: κ ∝ v * λ * Cv.

But earlier, I assumed Cv1/Cv2 is 1. Is that correct?

Wait, acetylene is C₂H₂, which has more atoms than N₂. So at the same temperature, perhaps its specific heat is higher. Let me think about it. For a diatomic gas, Cv is (5/2) R. For a linear triatomic like CO₂ or acetylene, which is linear, Cv would also be (5/2) R, because they have 3 translational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom, and vibrational modes may not contribute much at low temps. So maybe Cv is same for both. So the assumption holds.

So our calculation of σ1/σ2 ≈1.33 seems correct. So the ratio is about 1.33, which matches option E.
</think>

To determine the ratio of the collisional cross section of acetylene (C₂H₂) relative to nitrogen (N₂), we use the relationship between thermal conductivity (κ), average molecular speed (v), mean free path (λ), and specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv). The thermal conductivity is given by:

\[
\kappa \propto v \cdot \lambda \cdot C_v
\]

Since the gases are at the same temperature and pressure, the number density \(n\) is the same for both, and the mean free path \(\lambda\) is inversely proportional to the collisional cross section \(\sigma\), i.e., \(\lambda \propto 1/\sigma\). The average molecular speed \(v\) is proportional to \(\sqrt{1/M}\), where \(M\) is the molar mass. Assuming \(C_v\) is the same for both gases (as they are both diatomic-like molecules at room temperature), the ratio of thermal conductivities can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{\kappa_1}{\kappa_2} = \frac{v_1 \cdot \lambda_1}{v_2 \cdot \lambda_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} \cdot \frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of collisional cross sections:

\[
\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} \cdot \frac{\kappa_2}{\kappa_1}
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(v_1/v_2\)
The average molecular speed is proportional to \(\sqrt{1/M}\), where \(M\) is the molar mass. For acetylene (\(M_1 = 26 \, \text{g/mol}\)) and nitrogen (\(M_2 = 28 \, \text{g/mol}\)):

\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{28}{26}} \approx 1.0377
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\kappa_2/\kappa_1\)
The thermal conductivities are given as \(\kappa_1 = 0.01866 \, \text{J K}^{-1} \text{m}^{-1} \text{s}^{-1}\) for acetylene and \(\kappa_2 = 0.0240 \, \text{J K}^{-1} \text{m}^{-1} \text{s}^{-1}\) for nitrogen:

\[
\frac{\kappa_2}{\kappa_1} = \frac{0.0240}{0.01866} \approx 1.286
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\sigma_1/\sigma_2\)
Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} \cdot \frac{\kappa_2}{\kappa_1} = 1.0377 \cdot 1.286 \approx 1.334
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of the collisional cross section of acetylene relative to nitrogen is approximately \(1.33\), which corresponds to option **E**.
