Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the marginal cost and fixed cost to find out the total cost to produce one item. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from economics and calculus.

The question says the marginal cost y' is given by the equation 3 + x + (e^-x)/4. And the fixed cost is $4. I need to find the total cost to produce one item. 

Wait, right, marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost function. So if I have the marginal cost function, I should integrate it to get the total cost function. Then, I can use the fixed cost to find the constant of integration.

So the process is: integrate y' with respect to x to get C(x), the total cost. Then use the fixed cost to determine C(0), because when x=0 (no production), the cost should be the fixed cost, which is $4.

Let me set that up. The marginal cost is y' = 3 + x + (e^-x)/4. To find C(x), I need to integrate y' dx.

So the integral of 3 dx is 3x. The integral of x dx is (1/2)x². Now, the integral of (e^-x)/4 dx. The integral of e^-x is -e^-x, so multiplying by 1/4, it becomes (-e^-x)/4. So putting it all together, the integral is:

C(x) = 3x + (1/2)x² - (e^-x)/4 + K, where K is the constant of integration.

Now I remember that when x=0, the total cost should be the fixed cost, which is $4. So plugging x=0 into C(x):

C(0) = 3(0) + (1/2)(0)^2 - (e^0)/4 + K = 0 + 0 - (1)/4 + K = K - 1/4.

And this equals 4, because at x=0, the cost is the fixed cost. So:

K - 1/4 = 4 → K = 4 + 1/4 = 17/4 or 4.25.

Wait, 17/4 is 4.25? Yes, because 4 is 16/4, so 16/4 +1/4 is 17/4. So K is 4.25.

So the total cost function is C(x) = 3x + (1/2)x² - (e^-x)/4 + 17/4.

But wait, the question is asking for the cost to produce one item. So x=1, because the first item is x=1 (since x is the number of items produced, I think).

So I need to plug x=1 into the total cost function.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: 3x = 3(1) = 3.

Second term: (1/2)x² = (1/2)(1)^2 = 0.5.

Third term: -(e^-1)/4. e is approximately 2.71828, so e^-1 is about 0.3679. So 0.3679 divided by 4 is approximately 0.091975. But there's a negative sign, so it's about -0.091975.

Fourth term: 17/4 is 4.25.

Adding all these together: 3 + 0.5 - 0.091975 + 4.25.

Let me compute that step by step.

3 + 0.5 is 3.5.

3.5 +4.25 is 7.75.

7.75 minus 0.091975 is approximately 7.658.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly 7.658. Hmm, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: $7.45

B: $7.30

C: $7.20

D: $7.55

E: $8.00

F: $7.85

G: $7.66

I: $7.77

J: $7.99

Wait, option G is $7.66, which is close to my approximate 7.658. Alternatively, maybe my approximation of e is causing some discrepancy.

Let me calculate more accurately.

e^-1 is about 0.3678794412.

So (e^-1)/4 is 0.3678794412 /4 = 0.0917198603.

So the third term is -0.0917198603.

So putting it all together:

3 + 0.5 = 3.5.

3.5 +4.25 = 7.75.

7.75 - 0.0917198603 = 7.6582801397.

So approximately 7.6583. Looking at the options, G is 7.66, which is the closest. But wait, option I is 7.77, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to find the average cost or something else? No, the question is about the cost to produce one item. So x=1.

Wait another thing: the total cost function is the integral, so when x=1, it's the cost up to that point. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether x is the number of items beyond the fixed cost. Wait, but fixed cost is included in K. So when x=0, C=4, which is correct.

So my calculation for x=1 should give me the total cost for producing one item, which is about $7.6583. Looking at the options, the closest is G: $7.66. But let me check the options again.

Wait, option I is $7.77, which is higher. So why isn't it option I? Did I miscalculate?

Wait, let me double-check the integration steps. The integral of y' = 3 + x + (e^-x)/4.

So integrating term by term:

∫3 dx = 3x + C.

∫x dx = 0.5 x² + C.

∫(e^-x)/4 dx = (1/4) * ∫e^-x dx = (1/4)(-e^-x) + C.

So the integral is 3x + 0.5 x² - (e^-x)/4 + K.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, plug in x=0:

C(0) = 0 + 0 - (1)/4 + K = 4.

So K = 4 + 1/4 = 17/4 = 4.25.

So the total cost function is correct.

So when x=1, C(1) = 3(1) + 0.5(1) - (e^-1)/4 + 4.25.

Compute each part:

3*1=3.

0.5*(1)^2=0.5.

e^-1=0.367879441.

(0.367879441)/4=0.09171986.

So -0.09171986.

Plus 4.25.

Adding all: 3 + 0.5 =3.5; 3.5 +4.25=7.75; 7.75 - 0.09171986=7.65828.

So approximately 7.6583, which is about $7.66 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Looking at the options, option G is $7.66. So the answer should be G.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The fixed cost is $4, which is included in the K. So when x=1, the calculation includes that fixed cost. So yes, the cost to produce one item is about $7.66.

To determine the cost to produce one item, we start with the marginal cost function:

\[
y' = 3 + x + \frac{e^{-x}}{4}.
\]

The total cost function \( C(x) \) is obtained by integrating \( y' \) with respect to \( x \):

\[
C(x) = \int y' \, dx = \int \left(3 + x + \frac{e^{-x}}{4}\right) dx.
\]

Breaking this into terms:

1. \(\int 3 \, dx = 3x\),
2. \(\int x \, dx = \frac{1}{2}x^2\),
3. \(\int \frac{e^{-x}}{4} \, dx = -\frac{e^{-x}}{4}\).

Thus, the total cost function is:

\[
C(x) = 3x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{e^{-x}}{4} + K,
\]

where \( K \) is the constant of integration. To find \( K \), we use the fixed cost. When \( x = 0 \), the total cost is the fixed cost, \( C(0) = 4 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into \( C(x) \):

\[
C(0) = 3(0) + \frac{1}{2}(0)^2 - \frac{e^0}{4} + K = -\frac{1}{4} + K = 4.
\]

Solving for \( K \):

\[
K = 4 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{17}{4} = 4.25.
\]

The total cost function becomes:

\[
C(x) = 3x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{e^{-x}}{4} + 4.25.
\]

To find the cost to produce one item (\( x = 1 \)), substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( C(x) \):

\[
C(1) = 3(1) + \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 - \frac{e^{-1}}{4} + 4.25.
\]

Calculate each term:

1. \( 3(1) = 3 \),
2. \( \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 = 0.5 \),
3. \( e^{-1} \approx 0.3679 \), so \( \frac{e^{-1}}{4} \approx 0.091975 \) (with a negative sign: \( -0.091975 \)),
4. \( 4.25 \).

Adding these together:

\[
C(1) = 3 + 0.5 - 0.091975 + 4.25 = 7.75 - 0.091975 = 7.658025.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( C(1) \approx 7.66 \).

From the given options, the closest match is **G: $7.66**.
