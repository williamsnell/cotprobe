Okay, so I've got this FORTRAN program here, and I need to figure out what it outputs. Let me try to understand what's going on step by step.

First, I see that there are two arrays, A and PTR, each with 8 elements. The DATA statements are initializing them. So A is filled with the characters 'A', 'S', 'E', 'Q', 'N', 'U', 'T', '1'. Wait, that's 8 elements, right? Let me count: A, S, E, Q, N, U, T, 1. Yep, indexes 1 through 8.

Then the PTR array is initialized with the values 4,7,2,6,6,3,0,5. So PTR(1)=4, PTR(2)=7, and so on up to PTR(8)=5.

The program starts by setting I = PTR(1). Since PTR(1) is 4, I becomes 4.

Then there's a loop: it checks if I equals zero. If so, it goes to statement 30, which is the CONTINUE statement. But right now, I is 4, so it doesn't go there. Instead, it writes to unit 5 using format 100, which is (1X,A1), so it's printing one character. The character is A(I), which is A(4). Looking back at A, index 4 is 'Q'. So the first character printed is Q.

After that, I is set to PTR(I), which is PTR(4). Looking at PTR, index 4 is 6. So I becomes 6.

Then it goes back to the loop. I is 6, which is not zero. So it writes A(6), which is 'U'. Then I becomes PTR(6), which is 3.

Now I is 3, so it writes A(3), which is 'E'. Then I is set to PTR(3) = 2.

I is 2, so it writes A(2) which is 'S'. Then I is PTR(2)=7.

A(7) is 'T'. So next character is T. Then I becomes PTR(7)=0.

Now I is 0, so the loop condition I.EQ.0 is true. It goes to statement 30, which is CONTINUE, and then the program stops. So the output is the characters printed in order: Q, U, E, S, T.

Putting that together, it's "QUEST". Let me check the options. Option D is QUEST, so that should be the correct answer.

The FORTRAN program initializes two arrays, `A` and `PTR`, with specific values. The array `A` contains the characters `'A', 'S', 'E', 'Q', 'N', 'U', 'T', '1'`, and `PTR` contains the indices `[4, 7, 2, 6, 6, 3, 0, 5]`. The program then follows a sequence of operations based on the values in `PTR`.

Starting with `I = PTR(1) = 4`, the program enters a loop where it prints `A(I)` and updates `I` to `PTR(I)` until `I` becomes zero. The sequence of printed characters is as follows:

1. `I = 4`: Print `A(4) = 'Q'`.
2. `I = PTR(4) = 6`: Print `A(6) = 'U'`.
3. `I = PTR(6) = 3`: Print `A(3) = 'E'`.
4. `I = PTR(3) = 2`: Print `A(2) = 'S'`.
5. `I = PTR(2) = 7`: Print `A(7) = 'T'`.
6. `I = PTR(7) = 0`: Exit the loop.

The output is the string `"QUEST"`, which corresponds to option **D**.
