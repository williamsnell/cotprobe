Okay, so I have this problem here where a sequence is defined, and I need to find its limit assuming it converges. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The sequence is given by x₁ = 1, and then each subsequent term is defined by x_{n+1} = sqrt(3 + 2x_n). Hmm, right. So it's a recursively defined sequence. I remember that for such sequences, if they converge, the limit should satisfy a certain equation.

Wait, if the sequence converges to a limit L, then as n approaches infinity, both x_n and x_{n+1} approach L. So I can set up an equation where L equals the square root of (3 + 2L). That makes sense because each term depends on the previous one, and in the limit, they're all the same.

So let me write that down: L = sqrt(3 + 2L). To solve for L, I should square both sides to eliminate the square root. That gives me L² = 3 + 2L. Oh wait, that's a quadratic equation now. Rearranging terms, I get L² - 2L - 3 = 0.

Hmm, solving quadratic equations... I can use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic is L² - 2L -3 = 0. The quadratic formula is L = [2 ± sqrt((−2)² - 4*1*(-3))]/(2*1). Let's compute that discriminant: (−2)^2 is 4, and 4*1*(-3) is -12. So 4 - (-12) is 16. So sqrt(16) is 4. So the solutions are [2 ±4]/2.

That gives two possibilities: (2 +4)/2=6/2=3, and (2-4)/2=(-2)/2=-1. So L could be 3 or -1. But wait, the sequence starts at x₁=1, and each term is a square root, which is always positive. So the limit, if it exists, must be positive. Therefore, L can't be -1. So the only possible limit is 3.

Let me double-check my reasoning. The recursive formula is x_{n+1} = sqrt(3 + 2x_n). Starting with 1, let's compute a few terms to see if it seems to approach 3.

x₁ =1.

x₂ = sqrt(3 + 2*1) = sqrt(5) ≈2.236.

x₃ = sqrt(3 + 2*(2.236))=sqrt(3 +4.472)=sqrt(7.472)≈2.733.

x₄ = sqrt(3 +2*(2.733))=sqrt(3 +5.466)=sqrt(8.466)≈2.909.

x₅= sqrt(3+2*(2.909))=sqrt(3+5.818)=sqrt(8.818)≈2.970.

x₆= sqrt(3+2*(2.970))=sqrt(3+5.94)=sqrt(8.94)≈2.99.

x₇= sqrt(3+2*2.99)=sqrt(3+5.98)=sqrt(8.98)≈2.997.

It's getting closer to 3 each time. So the trend supports that the limit is indeed 3.

Wait, but what about the possibility of the limit being -1? Well, the square root always gives a non-negative result, so the sequence terms are all positive. So -1 isn't possible because you can't get negative terms here. So yeah, 3 is the only valid solution.

So looking at the options, option C is 3. So the answer should be C.

To determine the limit of the sequence \( \{x_n\} \) defined by \( x_1 = 1 \) and \( x_{n+1} = \sqrt{3 + 2x_n} \), we assume the sequence converges to a limit \( L \). If the sequence converges, then as \( n \to \infty \), both \( x_n \) and \( x_{n+1} \) approach \( L \). Substituting \( L \) into the recursive formula gives:

\[
L = \sqrt{3 + 2L}.
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root yields:

\[
L^2 = 3 + 2L.
\]

Rearranging terms results in the quadratic equation:

\[
L^2 - 2L - 3 = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( L = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = -3 \), we find:

\[
L = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 4}{2}.
\]

This gives two solutions:

\[
L = \frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad L = \frac{2 - 4}{2} = -1.
\]

Since the sequence starts with \( x_1 = 1 \) and each term is defined as a square root (which is always non-negative), the limit \( L \) must be positive. Thus, \( L = -1 \) is not valid, and the only possible limit is \( L = 3 \).

To confirm, we compute the first few terms of the sequence:

\[
x_1 = 1, \quad x_2 = \sqrt{3 + 2(1)} = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236, \quad x_3 = \sqrt{3 + 2(2.236)} \approx 2.733,
\]
\[
x_4 \approx 2.909, \quad x_5 \approx 2.970, \quad x_6 \approx 2.99, \quad x_7 \approx 2.997.
\]

The terms are clearly approaching 3, consistent with the derived limit.

Thus, the limit of the sequence is \( 3 \), corresponding to option C.
