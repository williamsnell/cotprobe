Question:

A market demand curve is defined as a horizontal summation of all the individual demand curves. Why is this summation taken horizontally rather than vertically?

Options:

A: A vertical summation fits the definition of a market demand curve.
B: The horizontal summation reflects the prices at which consumers are willing to purchase a given quantity.
C: A vertical summation would represent the sum of the prices for each quantity, which is not meaningful.
D: The proper horizontal point is a summation of all the individual quantities demanded.
E: The market demand curve is a schedule of prices.
F: The horizontal summation allows for the calculation of the total quantity demanded at various price levels.
G: A vertical summation would show the total revenue, not the quantity demanded.
H: A vertical summation would aggregate individual demands in terms of price, not quantity.
I: The vertical summation would reflect the cumulative willingness to pay, rather than the total quantity demanded.
J: The vertical point is a summation of all individual quantities demanded.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about market demand curves. Hmm, I remember that market demand is different from individual demand. Oh right, market demand is the sum of all individual demands. But wait, the question is about why we sum them horizontally instead of vertically.

Wait, let me think back to what I learned. In individual demand, each person's curve shows the quantity they'll buy at different prices. So if the price changes, each person adjusts their quantity. Now, when we combine these to get market demand, we're looking for the total quantity that all individuals together will buy at a given price.

Oh, right! So, for a specific price, say $10, each individual might buy a certain amount. To get the market quantity at $10, we add up all the quantities each person buys at that price. That makes sense because it's a horizontal summationâ€”same price level across all individual curves.

If we summed vertically, that would mean adding the prices each person is willing to pay for a given quantity. But that doesn't make sense because the market demand isn't about the sum of prices; it's about the sum of quantities at each price point.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option C says a vertical summation would sum prices for each quantity, which isn't meaningful. That sounds right. Option F says horizontal summation allows calculation of total quantity at various prices. That also makes sense. Option I mentions vertical summation reflecting willingness to pay instead of quantity. Yeah, that fits too.

Wait, the question is why it's horizontal. So the reason is that we're adding quantities, not prices. So the correct answer should explain that a horizontal summation gives total quantity at each price point.

Option F says that. Alternatively, option C explains why vertical isn't done. Let me read the question again. The question asks why we take the summation horizontally. So the reason is that it sums the quantities at each price level, which is what the market demand curve shows.

So looking at the options, F says horizontal summation allows for the calculation of total quantity at various price levels. That's correct. Also, Option C says vertical summation isn't meaningful because it sums prices, which isn't what we want for market demand.

So the correct answer should be either F or C. The question is about why we do horizontal summation. So the answer would be because it's the sum of quantities, not prices.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me read each again.

Option F: The horizontal summation allows for the calculation of the total quantity demanded at various price levels. Yes, that directly answers the question.

Option C: A vertical summation would represent the sum of the prices for each quantity, which is not meaningful. That also explains why vertical isn't done, but the question is about why it's done horizontally.

So the correct answer should be F. Alternatively, maybe another option.

Another option, H: vertical summation would aggregate demands in terms of price. No, not really. Wait, no. H says vertical summation would aggregate in terms of price, which is incorrect. Market demand is in terms of quantity.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that market demand is total quantity across all individuals at each price. So when price is P, each individual's quantity is Q1, Q2, etc. Sum them to get market Q. So it's a horizontal summation because each point on the market curve is the sum of quantities across individuals at a given price.

So the answer is F: horizontal summation allows calculation of total quantity at various prices.

The market demand curve is derived by summing individual demand curves horizontally because it reflects the total quantity demanded by all consumers at each price level. At a specific price, each individual's quantity demanded is identified, and these quantities are added together to determine the market quantity. This horizontal approach is essential because it aggregates quantities, not prices, across all individuals. 

Option F correctly captures this reasoning, stating that the horizontal summation allows for the calculation of the total quantity demanded at various price levels. This aligns with the purpose of the market demand curve, which focuses on the relationship between price and total quantity demanded in the market.

Answer: F
