Okay, so I've got this question about Corvino's reading of Aquinas and what makes a sexual act "unnatural." Hmm, I remember that Aquinas was a medieval philosopher and theologian, so his views would be rooted in Catholic teachings. The term "unnatural" in this context probably relates to the natural law theory, which Aquinas was a proponent of.

Natural law, as I understand it, is based on the idea that there's a moral order inherent in the universe, derived from reason and observation of nature. For Aquinas, human actions are evaluated based on whether they align with this natural order. When it comes to sexual acts, the natural purpose would likely be procreation, as that's a common theme in Catholic sexual ethics.

So, "unnatural" acts would be those that go against this natural purpose. That means any sexual activity that doesn't have the potential for procreation. For example, same-sex relations, because they can't lead to procreation, or non-procreative acts like contraception use in heterosexual relationships.

Looking at the options, let's break them down. Option I says "deliberately non-procreative." That fits because if the act is intentionally not aimed at creating life, it goes against the natural purpose. Option F is the opposite, "deliberately pro-creative," which would be in line with natural law, so that's probably not the answer.

Other options: A talks about being outside marriage. While the Catholic Church does have teachings about marriage, the question is specifically about "unnatural" acts, which I think is more about the act's purpose than the context (like marital status). So A might not be correct.

B is about consent. Non-consensual acts are wrong, but I don't think that's what defines them as unnatural in this context. It's more about the nature of the act itself, not the consent.

C is about adolescents. I don't recall Aquinas focusing on the age group specifically as making an act unnatural. It's more about the act's purpose.

D is emotional fulfillment. Not sure about that. Natural law is more about the physical and biological purpose than emotional aspects.

E is societal norms. But Aquinas's view would be based on natural law, not what society happens to accept at a given time.

G is multiple partners, which relates to adultery or polygamy, but again, the unnatural aspect is more about procreation, not the number of partners.

H is uncommon practices. That seems more like a statistical or cultural thing, not a moral determination based on natural law.

J is about religious endorsement. While Aquinas is a religious figure, the question is about the definition of unnatural acts, which is tied to natural law, not just what the Church endorses.

So putting it all together, the answer should be I: deliberately non-procreative.

The question asks about Corvino's reading of Aquinas regarding "unnatural" sexual acts. Aquinas, influenced by natural law theory, would define such acts as those contrary to the natural purpose of sexuality, which is procreation. Among the options, "deliberately non-procreative" aligns with this understanding, as it directly opposes the natural purpose of sexual acts.
