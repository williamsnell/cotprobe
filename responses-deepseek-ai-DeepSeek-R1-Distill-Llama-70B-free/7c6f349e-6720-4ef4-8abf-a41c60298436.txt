Okay, so I've got this problem about buying a piano on an installment plan, and I need to calculate the monthly installment and the total cost. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

The piano is priced at $1250, plus 4 and a half percent tax. Wait, so the tax is 4.5% on $1250. I think I'll calculate that first. So, 4.5% of 1250. Let me compute that. 1250 * 0.045. Hmm, 1250 times 0.04 is 50, and 1250 times 0.005 is 6.25. So 50 + 6.25 is $56.25. So the total price including tax would be 1250 + 56.25, which is $1306.25.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "plus 4(1/2)% tax". Oh, right, that's 4.5%, so yes, that's correct. So the total cash value is $1306.25.

Now, the piano was purchased on an installment plan. The down payment is 10% of the cash value. So 10% of 1306.25. Let me calculate that: 0.10 * 1306.25. 0.1 times 1300 is 130, and 0.1 times 6.25 is 0.625, so total down payment is $130.625. Hmm, but money usually goes to cents, so perhaps $130.63? Or maybe they just keep it at two decimal places, so $130.63.

Wait, but let me double-check. 1306.25 * 0.10 is indeed 130.625. So the down payment is $130.63 (rounded to the nearest cent). That leaves the balance to be paid over 18 months.

So the balance after down payment is 1306.25 minus 130.625, which is 1175.625, or $1175.63.

Now, a service charge of 12% is added to the unpaid balance. So that's 12% of 1175.63. Let me compute that: 0.12 * 1175.63. Let me compute 1175.63 * 0.12.

Well, 1000 *0.12 is 120. 175.63 *0.12: 175 *0.12 is 21, and 0.63 *0.12 is 0.0756, so 21.0756. Adding to 120, that makes 141.0756. So total service charge is approximately $141.08.

Wait, but wait. Is the service charge applied on the balance before or after the down payment? Oh, the service charge is added to the unpaid balance. So the unpaid balance is $1175.63, so 12% of that is indeed $141.08 approximately.

So the total amount to be paid in installments is the balance plus the service charge. So 1175.63 + 141.08 equals 1316.71. Wait, let me add that again: 1175.63 + 141.08. 1175 + 141 is 1316, and 0.63 + 0.08 is 0.71, so total is $1316.71.

Wait, but wait, the way the problem is phrased: "service charge of 12% was added to the unpaid balance." So yes, that's correct. So the total amount now owed is 1175.63 plus 12% of that, which is 1316.71.

Now, this amount is to be paid over 18 months. So the monthly installment would be 1316.71 divided by 18. Let me calculate that: 1316.71 ÷ 18.

So 18*70 is 1260. 1316.71 minus 1260 is 56.71. Now, 56.71 ÷ 18 is approximately 3.151. So adding to 70, that would be about 73.151 per month. So approximately $73.15 per month.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation. 1316.71 divided by 18. Let me see: 18 × 73 = 1314. 1316.71 - 1314 is 2.71. So 2.71 ÷ 18 is approximately 0.1506. So total monthly payment is 73.1506, which would round to approximately $73.15.

But looking at the options, I don't see a $73.15 option. Let me check the options again. The options are A through J, with various amounts. Let's see:

Option H is $73.40 and $1448. Hmm, close but not exact. Option D is $71.10 and $1422. Option B is $70 and $1400.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go through the steps again, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, the service charge is 12% of the unpaid balance. The unpaid balance is $1175.625. So 12% of that is 0.12 * 1175.625 = let me calculate that more accurately.

1175.625 × 0.12: 1000 ×0.12=120, 175 ×0.12=21, 0.625×0.12=0.075. So 120 +21=141, plus 0.075 is 141.075. So total service charge is $141.075, which is $141.08 when rounded.

So the total owed after service charge is 1175.625 + 141.075 = 1316.70.

Divide that by 18 months: 1316.70 / 18.

Let me compute 18 ×73 = 1314. So 1316.70 -1314 is 2.70. 2.70 /18 = 0.15. So 73 + 0.15 is 73.15.

Hmm, but the options don't have $73.15. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total amount?

Wait, perhaps the service charge is added, but maybe the way the problem is structured is that the service charge is applied to the balance, and then that sum is divided by 18. So perhaps I'm correct in that.

Alternatively, perhaps the service charge is calculated on a monthly basis, but no, the problem says a service charge of 12% was added to the unpaid balance. So that's a one-time charge.

Wait, another approach: maybe the total cost after down payment is $1175.625, then the service charge is 12% on that, so 1175.625 ×1.12 = ?

Yes, that's another way to compute it. So 1175.625 ×1.12.

Let me compute that: 1175.625 ×1 is 1175.625, and 1175.625 ×0.12 is 141.075. So adding them gives 1316.70, same as before.

So 1316.70 divided by 18 is 73.15 per month.

But let's look at the options again. Option H is $73.40 and total cost $1448. Option D is $71.10 and $1422.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial tax calculation. Let me double-check that.

The piano's price is $1250 plus 4.5% tax. So 1250 × 1.045 = ?

Let me compute 1250 × 1.045.

1250 ×1 = 1250.

1250 ×0.04 = 50.

1250 ×0.005=6.25.

So 0.045 is 50 + 6.25 = 56.25. So 1250 +56.25 =1306.25. So that part is correct.

Then down payment is 10% of 1306.25, which is 130.625.

So the balance after down payment is 1306.25 -130.625 =1175.625.

Then service charge is 12% of 1175.625, which is 141.075. So total owed is 1175.625 +141.075=1316.70.

Divide by 18 months: 1316.70 /18 =73.15.

So the monthly payment would be approximately $73.15. But looking at the options, the closest is option H: $73.40, but the total cost would be higher.

Wait, but let's compute the total cost. The total cost is the cash price plus tax plus the service charge. Wait, no: the total cost the buyer pays is the down payment plus all the monthly payments.

Alternatively, perhaps the total cost is the sum of the down payment plus 18 monthly installments. But in this case, the total amount paid in installments is 73.15 ×18, plus the down payment.

Wait, wait, no. The 18 monthly payments sum up to 1316.70, because that's the amount after service charge. So the total cost is the down payment plus the sum of the installments. So down payment is 130.625, and then 18 payments of 73.15, which sum to 1316.70. So total cost is 130.625 + 1316.70 =1447.325. Which is approximately $1447.33.

Looking at the options, option H says total cost is $1448, which matches closely. And the monthly installment is $73.40, which is a bit higher than my calculation of 73.15. Perhaps the exact calculation would result in a slightly different figure due to rounding during monthly payments.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact monthly payment without intermediate rounding.

Let me try that. So, the total after service charge is 1316.70 (from 1175.625 +141.075). Now, dividing 1316.70 by 18.

Let's compute 1316.7 / 18:

18 ×73 = 1314. So 1316.7 -1314=2.7.

2.7 /18 = 0.15.

So 73 + 0.15=73.15. So monthly payment is $73.15. But perhaps the problem expects us to round up to the nearest cent or to the nearest dollar.

Alternatively, perhaps the service charge is calculated differently. Wait, could the service charge be 12% per annum, but since it's 1.5 years, perhaps the rate is adjusted? But the problem says a service charge of 12% was added, so I think it's a flat 12% on the unpaid balance, regardless of time.

Wait, perhaps the down payment is 10% of $1250, not including tax? Wait, let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says: "a down payment of 10% of the cash value". Cash value would include tax, right? Because the piano is priced at $1250 plus tax, so the cash value is $1306.25. So the down payment is 10% of that, which is 130.625.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct. So the monthly payment is $73.15, and the total cost is $1447.33. The closest option is H: $73.40 and $1448.

But wait, maybe the monthly payment is calculated with more precise decimal handling. Let me compute 1316.70 divided by 18 exactly.

1316.70 ÷18 = ?

Well, 18 ×73 is 1314. Subtract that from 1316.70, we have 2.70 left. 2.70 ÷18 is 0.15. So 73.15 exactly. So perhaps the problem rounds to the nearest cent, making it $73.15, but none of the options have that exact figure. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let's consider that the service charge is calculated on the original price before tax. No, the problem says the service charge is added to the unpaid balance, which is after tax and after down payment.

Alternatively, perhaps the total amount after adding the service charge is $1175.625 ×1.12=1316.70, which is correct. So the monthly payment is 73.15. So perhaps the options have a typo or I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again, option H is $73.40 and total cost $1448. That's very close. Alternatively, perhaps the service charge is 12% per annum, but the period is 18 months, so 1.5 years. Then the service charge would be 12% *1.5 =18%? No, that doesn't make sense because the problem says a service charge of 12% was added, so probably a flat 12% regardless of time.

Wait, perhaps the service charge is 1% per month? No, the problem says a service charge of 12% was added, so it's a one-time 12% charge.

Wait, perhaps instead of adding the service charge to the balance, the monthly payments include interest. But no, the problem says a service charge was added, so it's a lump sum added to the balance.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the total cost. The total cost is down payment plus 18 monthly payments. So if the monthly payment is 73.15, then 73.15 ×18 =1316.70. Adding the down payment of 130.625 gives 1447.325, which is approximately $1447.33. The closest option is H, which is total cost $1448, and monthly payment $73.40.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the service charge to be included in the monthly payments, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tax calculation.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the total cost as per the options and see which one aligns.

Option H: total cost $1448.

So down payment is 10% of 1306.25, which is 130.625.

So 1448 -130.625 =1317.375. This would be the sum of the 18 installments.

So each installment would be 1317.375 /18 =73.374... which is approximately $73.37 per month. But option H says $73.40, which is close but not exact.

Hmm, perhaps the problem rounds the monthly payment to the nearest cent or dollar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's calculations are slightly different.

Wait, perhaps the down payment is 10% of the original price, not including tax. Let me see: original price is $1250. 10% of that is $125. Then the cash value including tax would be 1250 ×1.045=1306.25. So the down payment would be $125, and the balance would be 1306.25 -125=1181.25. Then service charge is 12% of 1181.25, which is 141.75. So total owed is 1181.25 +141.75=1323. So 1323 divided by 18 is 73.5 per month. Then total cost would be 125 + (73.5×18)=125 +1323=1448. So that would match option H.

Wait, so perhaps the down payment is 10% of the original price before tax, not including tax. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says: "a down payment of 10% of the cash value". Cash value is the price plus tax, right? So that would imply that the down payment is 10% of 1306.25, which is 130.625 as before.

But if I instead take the down payment as 10% of the original price ($1250), that would be $125, then the calculations would proceed as I did above, leading to total cost $1448 and monthly payment $73.50, but option H says $73.40.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try that approach again.

If down payment is 10% of $1250, which is $125. Then the balance is 1250 ×1.045=1306.25 - $125=1181.25.

Service charge is 12% of 1181.25=141.75.

Total owed: 1181.25 +141.75=1323.

1323 divided by 18 is 73.5 per month.

So total cost: $125 + (73.5 ×18)=125 +1323=1448.

This matches option H's total cost of $1448, but the monthly payment would be $73.50, which isn't exactly an option. Option H is $73.40, but perhaps due to rounding, it's presented as $73.40.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the cash value after tax to compute the down payment, leading to a slightly lower total cost.

Wait, but if I proceed with the down payment as 10% of the cash value (including tax), which is 130.625, then the balance is 1175.625. Service charge is 12% of that, 141.075. So total owed is 1316.70. Divided by 18 gives 73.15 per month. Total cost is 130.625 + (73.15×18)=130.625 +1316.70=1447.325, which is approximately $1447.33. The closest option is H: $1448.

But looking at the options, option H's monthly payment is $73.40, which is a bit higher than my calculation. Perhaps the problem expects us to round up to the nearest cent or dollar.

Alternatively, perhaps the service charge is calculated on the pre-tax amount. Let me try that.

If the service charge is 12% of the balance before tax: original price $1250, down payment 10% of 1250 is $125. So balance is 1250 -125=1125. Service charge 12% of 1125=135. So total owed is 1125 +135=1260. Then 1260 divided by 18 is 70. So monthly payment $70, total cost 125 +70×18=125+1260=1385. But that's not matching any option.

So that approach doesn't fit. Thus, the correct approach must be considering the tax first, then down payment, then service charge.

So, the total cost is approximately $1447.33, which is closest to option H's $1448, and the monthly payment is approximately $73.15, which is closest to option H's $73.40. However, none of the options exactly match both numbers.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the total cost calculation. Because the total cost is the cash price plus tax, plus the service charge, but actually, the service charge is part of the total amount paid. So perhaps the
