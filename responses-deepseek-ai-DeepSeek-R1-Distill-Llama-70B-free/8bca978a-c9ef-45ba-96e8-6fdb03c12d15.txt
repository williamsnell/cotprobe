Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about average total cost in economics. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the options A to J is correct. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Average total cost, ATC, right? I think it's related to the total cost divided by the quantity produced. Oh wait, total cost would include both fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are things like rent that don't change with production levels, and variable costs are things like labor or materials that do change as you produce more.

So the formula for average total cost should be (Total Fixed Costs + Total Variable Costs) divided by the number of units produced. Let me look at the options.

Option A says: Average total cost equals total fixed costs plus total variable costs. Wait, no, that's just total cost, not average. Because average would be total cost divided by quantity. So A doesn't seem right.

Option B: ATC is total costs divided by marginal cost. Hmm, marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit. So dividing total costs by MC doesn't sound familiar. I don't think that's correct.

Option C: AVC is average variable cost, which is variable costs divided by units. So C says ATC is AVC divided by units, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually C says total variable costs divided by units, which is AVC. So C is AVC, not ATC. So C is incorrect.

Option D: ATC is total fixed costs divided by units. That would be average fixed cost, not total. So D is wrong.

Option E: ATC equals AVC plus marginal cost. Hmm, I'm not sure. I remember that marginal cost is related to the change in variable costs. But I think the correct formula is ATC = AVC + AFC (where AFC is average fixed cost). So E is mixing MC into it, which doesn't fit. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: ATC is total revenue divided by units. No, that's average revenue, not cost. F is wrong.

Option G: ATC is MC divided by units. That doesn't make sense. Marginal cost is per unit, so dividing by units would give something per unit squared, which isn't right. G is out.

Option H: ATC is AVC plus AFC. Oh wait, yes! Because average total cost is the sum of average variable and average fixed costs. So H sounds correct. Let me just double-check the other options.

Option I: ATC is AFC minus AVC. That doesn't make sense economically because costs can't be negative here, and this would imply subtracting a larger cost from a smaller one, which might give a negative number. So I is wrong.

Option J: AVC divided by total units. No, that's not right. AVC is already variable costs divided by units. Dividing again by units would be wrong. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is H. Average total cost equals average variable cost plus average fixed cost.

The correct answer is:

H: Average total cost = average variable cost plus average fixed cost.

This is because average total cost (ATC) is calculated by summing average variable cost (AVC) and average fixed cost (AFC). 

Answer: H
