Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the standard cell potential (E°) for a given cell and determining if the reaction is spontaneous. The cell notation given is Pt/Ag(s)/AgBr(s)/Br^-(a=0.34)/Br2(1atm)/Pt. And the standard electrode potentials provided are for AgBr/Ag at 0.071 V and Br2/Br^- at 1.065 V.

Hmm, I remember that cell potential is calculated using the formula E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode. So I need to figure out which is the cathode and which is the anode.

Wait, in cell notation, the anode is on the left and the cathode on the right. Because electrons flow from anode to cathode. So the left side is where oxidation happens (anode), and the right is reduction (cathode).

Looking at the cell: the left side is Ag(s)/AgBr(s). I think that's the silver-silver bromide electrode. The right side is Br2/Br^-; that's bromine and bromide ions.

I should write the two half-reactions. For the anode (oxidation), Ag must be oxidized. Let me think: AgBr is Ag+ and Br^- in solution. So when Ag(s) is in contact with AgBr(s), the possible reaction involves Ag losing electrons.

Wait, the standard potential for AgBr/Ag is given as 0.071 V. I think that's the reduction potential. So in which direction will it run when connected to another electrode?

The Br2/Br^- has a higher potential (1.065 V), which is higher than 0.071 V. So Br2 will act as the cathode (reduction), and AgBr/Ag will act as the anode (oxidation).

Wait no, wait. The higher the E°, the more likely it is to be the cathode. So since Br2's E° is higher (1.065) than AgBr/Ag (0.071), Br2 will be cathode, AgBr/Ag will be anode.

So the anode reaction is oxidation. The standard reaction for AgBr/Ag as anode would be oxidation. Let's see: Ag(s) is in contact with AgBr(s). The oxidation would involve Ag losing electrons. Let me think about the half-reactions.

The standard reduction for AgBr/Ag is: AgBr(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Br^-(aq). So the reverse would be oxidation: Ag(s) + Br^- → AgBr(s) + e^-.

So the anode is Ag(s) → Ag+ + e^-, but wait, wait. No, because in the anode, the metal is oxidized. But in this case, Ag is part of AgBr. So the reaction is Ag(s) losing electrons, producing Ag+ which combines with Br^- to form AgBr. So the anode reaction would be Ag(s) → Ag^+ + e^-, but since AgBr is present, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as Ag(s) + Br^- → AgBr(s) + e^-.

Wait, but the standard E° for the AgBr/Ag electrode is given as 0.071 V, which is the reduction potential. So the reverse would be oxidation, which would have E°anode (as oxidation) as -0.071 V.

Wait no, no. The E° for the cell is E°cathode - E°anode, but E°anode is the standard reduction potential of the anode. So when the anode undergoes oxidation, its E° is lower than the cathode's. So in the cell, the anode's E° is 0.071 V (since that's the E° for reduction), and the cathode's E° is 1.065 V.

Wait, but let me make sure. The cell diagram is: Pt | Ag(s) | AgBr(s) | Br^- (a=0.34) | Br2 (1 atm) | Pt.

So the left side is the Ag/AgBr half-cell, acting as the anode, and the right is the Br2/Br^- half-cell, acting as the cathode.

So the standard E°cell is E°cathode (Br2/Br^-) minus E°anode (AgBr/Ag).

So E°cell = 1.065 V - 0.071 V = 0.994 V.

Wait, wait, but let me double-check. Since the anode is undergoing oxidation, so it's the reverse of its standard reduction. So E°anode (as oxidation) would be -0.071 V, but in the formula, we subtract the anode's standard reduction potential.

So formula is E°cell = (E°cathode) - (E°anode as reduction), which is 1.065 - 0.071 = 0.994 V.

So E°cell is positive, which indicates a spontaneous reaction. Because if E°cell is positive, the reaction is spontaneous.

Now, looking at the options: Let's see. The options are A through J.

Option J is 0.994, spontaneous. Option D is 1.136 V, which is higher than what I calculated.

Wait wait, did I do the math right? 1.065 minus 0.071 is 0.994 V. Yes.

So E°cell is 0.994 V, which is positive, so the reaction is spontaneous.

Looking at the options, the correct one would have E° as 0.994 and be spontaneous.

Looking at the options again:

Option J: 0.994, spontaneous.

Yes, that's the one.

To determine the standard cell potential (E°) and the spontaneity of the reaction, we analyze the given cell: Pt/Ag(s)/AgBr(s)/Br^-(a = 0.34)/Br₂(1 atm)/Pt. The standard electrode potentials provided are:

- **AgBr/Ag**: 0.071 V (reduction potential)
- **Br₂/Br⁻**: 1.065 V (reduction potential)

### Step 1: Identify the cathode and anode
In cell notation, the anode (oxidation) is on the left, and the cathode (reduction) is on the right. Since the reduction potential of Br₂/Br⁻ (1.065 V) is higher than that of AgBr/Ag (0.071 V), the Br₂/Br⁻ half-cell will act as the cathode, and the AgBr/Ag half-cell will act as the anode.

### Step 2: Write the half-reactions
1. **Cathode (reduction):**  
   Br₂(g) + 2e⁻ → 2Br⁻(aq)  
   (E° = 1.065 V)

2. **Anode (oxidation):**  
   Ag(s) + Br⁻(aq) → AgBr(s) + e⁻  
   (E° = -0.071 V, as it is the reverse of the reduction reaction)

### Step 3: Calculate the standard cell potential
The standard cell potential is calculated using the formula:  
\[
E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}}
\]
Substituting the values:  
\[
E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = 1.065 \, \text{V} - 0.071 \, \text{V} = 0.994 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 4: Determine spontaneity
Since the calculated \( E^\circ_{\text{cell}} \) is positive (0.994 V), the reaction is spontaneous.

### Step 5: Match with the options
From the given options, the correct one is:  
**J: 0.994, spontaneous**
