Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a converging lens used as a simple magnifier. Hmm, I remember that a simple magnifier uses the concept of angular magnification. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the lens has a focal length of 5.0 cm. It's used as a simple magnifier, producing a virtual image 25 cm from the eye. I need to find out how far the object should be placed from the lens and what the magnification is.

Wait, so in a simple magnifier setup, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. Oh right, the image is formed at the near point of the eye when the object is at the focal point. But wait, in this case, the image is 25 cm away, which is probably the near point. I think the near point of the human eye is around 25 cm, so that makes sense.

I remember the formula for angular magnification when using a simple magnifier. The magnification M is given by M = 1 + (f / do), where f is the focal length, and do is the object distance. Or wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, for a simple magnifier, the formula is M = (25 cm)/f, but that's when the image is at the near point and the object is at the focal point. Because when the object is at f, the image is at infinity, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, when the object is placed at the focal point (so do = f), the image is formed at infinity, which would make the magnification M = 1 + (25 cm)/f. Because when the image is at infinity, the magnification is higher. So in that case, if f is 5 cm, then M would be 1 + 5 = 6? Or wait, 25/5 is 5, plus 1 is 6. So M would be 6. But in this problem, the image is at 25 cm, not at infinity. So maybe the object isn't at the focal point.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline what I know.

The lens formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where do is object distance, di is image distance, and f is focal length. Since it's a converging lens and the image is virtual, di will be negative because, by convention, virtual images are on the same side as the object. So di is -25 cm.

Given that, I can plug into the lens formula:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

f is 5 cm, di is -25 cm.

So 1/5 = 1/do + 1/(-25) => 1/do = 1/5 - (1/-25) = 1/5 + 1/25.

Hmm, 1/5 is 5/25, so 5/25 + 1/25 =6/25. So 1/do =6/25 => do =25/6 cm. Let's calculate that. 25 divided by 6 is approximately 4.166... cm. So about 4.17 cm. Let me see the options; option E is 4.2 cm, which is close. Option J is 4.5 cm, which is a bit higher.

Wait, options: A:2.8, B:4.8, C:3.9, D:7.0, E:4.2, F:6.3, G:5.5, H:5.0, I:3.5, J:4.5.

So 4.17 is closest to E's 4.2 cm.

Now for magnification. The magnification M is given by M = - di/do. Since di is negative and do is positive, M will be positive (because di is -25, so -(-25)/do =25/do).

Wait, M = -(di/do) => since di is -25, M = -(-25)/do =25/do.

Because di is -25 cm, so substituting, M =25 / (25/6) )= 25*(6/25)=6.

Wait, but that's when the image is formed at the near point? Or is that only when the object is at the focal point? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, the magnification when the image is at the near point (25 cm) would be M = 1 + (f / do). Let me think.

Wait, another way: the angular magnification M is given by M = (25 cm)/f + 1. No, wait, that's when the image is at infinity. Let me get this straight.

The formula for magnification when using a simple magnifier (which creates a virtual image) is M = 1 + (25 cm)/f. But that's when the image is at the near point and the object is within the focal length, so that the image is at infinity. Wait, no, when the object is placed at the focal point, the image is at infinity, which allows maximum magnification. But in this problem, the image is at 25 cm, which is the near point, so the object is closer than the focal point. So the formula might be different.

Wait, another approach: using the lens formula to find do, which I did (25/6 ≈4.166 cm). Then, the magnification M is (v/u), where v is image distance (in meters, but sign matters), u is object distance.

Wait, in the sign conventions, for a converging lens, object distance is positive (since it's real), and image distance for virtual images is negative. So di is -25 cm.

So M = - (di/do) = - ( (-25) / (25/6) ) = - ( (-25 *6)/25 ) = - ( -6 ) = 6.

Wait, so M is 6. But none of the options have a magnification of 6. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Option C: 3.9 cm, 6.1 → M=6.1.

Option E:4.2 cm,5.9 → M=5.9.

Option J:4.5,5.5.

Hmm, none of the options have M=6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the object distance. 1/f = 1/do +1/di.

f=5 cm, di=-25 cm.

So 1/5 =1/do + (1/-25).

That is 1/do = 1/5 + 1/25 = (5 +1)/25 =6/25 → do=25/6 ≈4.1667 cm. So that's correct.

Magnification M = -(di/do) → di is -25, so:

M= - ( (-25) / (25/6) ) → 25/(25/6) is 6. So M=6.

But the options don't have 6. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the magnification formula is different. The angular magnification M is given by M = (image distance)/(object distance) when the image is at the near point. Wait, no. Let me think again about the simple magnifier formula.

Wait, the simple magnifier formula (angular magnification) is M = (25 cm)/f + 1. But that's when the image is formed at infinity. Wait, no, when the object is placed at the focal point, the image is at infinity, and the magnification is (25 cm)/f. Oh wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, let me get the correct formula. The angular magnification M of a simple magnifier is given by M = 1 + (D)/f, where D is the near point distance (usually 25 cm). But this formula holds when the image is formed at infinity. So that's when the object is at the focal point, which would produce maximum magnification.

But in this problem, the image is formed at the near point, not at infinity. So we can't use that formula directly.

Wait, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the lens formula to find do, which I did (about 4.17 cm), then compute the magnification using M = (image height)/(object height) * (object distance)/(image distance). But since it's a lens, the magnification is M = - (di/do). Because magnification m = height of image / height of object = - di/do.

So in our case, di is -25 cm, do is 25/6 cm ≈4.1667 cm.

So M = - (di/do) → di is -25, so M = - ( (-25) / (25/6) ) → M = 6.

So the magnification is 6x. But looking at the options, the closest is option C, which has 6.1, but the object distance there is 3.9 cm, which doesn't match our 4.17 cm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck the lens formula.

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

f=5 cm.

di is the image distance. Since the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, di is negative. So di = -25 cm.

So 1/5 = 1/do + (1/-25)

→ 1/do = 1/5 + 1/25 → 5/25 + 1/25 =6/25 → do=25/6 ≈4.1667 cm.

So that's correct.

Now, the magnification M is given by M = v/u, where u is object distance, v is image distance.

Wait, wait, in optics, the magnification m is m = v/u, where u is the object distance (do, usually positive for real objects), and v is the image distance (di, which can be positive or negative).

So m = v/u → di/do = (-25) / (25/6) )= (-25 *6)/25 = -6.

So the magnification is -6, but magnification is often given as the absolute value, or perhaps the sign indicates whether it's upright or inverted. But in the context of a simple magnifier, the image is virtual and upright, so the magnification would be positive.

But according to the formula, it's negative, which suggests the image is inverted. Wait, but for a converging lens used as a magnifying glass, the image is virtual, upright, and larger, so the magnification should be positive.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnification M is calculated as M = (di)/(do), but considering signs.

Wait, another approach. The formula for angular magnification when the image is at the near point is M = 1 + (f)/(do).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

If the image is at the near point (di = -D, where D=25 cm), then the magnification M is M = D/f * (1 + f/do).

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to use the lens formula and then calculate the magnification with M = v/u.

Wait, but in this case, we have di = -25 cm, do =25/6 cm.

So M = di/do = (-25)/(25/6) )= -6. So the magnification is 6, but negative, implying an inverted image. But that's impossible for a simple magnifier, which should produce an upright image.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the conventions. Let's clarify the sign conventions.

In optics, the object distance (u) is positive for real objects. The image distance (v) is positive if the image is on the opposite side of the lens (real image) and negative if on the same side as the object (virtual image).

Magnification m = v/u. So for a virtual image, v is negative, u is positive → m is negative, which implies the image is inverted relative to the object. But a simple magnifier is supposed to produce an upright, virtual image. Hmm, that's a contradiction.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe for a simple magnifier, the magnification is calculated differently, considering only the angular size, not the image inversion.

Wait, another thought: maybe the magnification formula when the image is at the near point is M = (D)/(u), where D is the near point distance. Or perhaps M = (D + u)/u.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me look for another approach. Maybe using the concept of the magnifier producing a virtual image at the near point, so the object must be placed somewhere between the lens and the focal point.

Wait, the simple magnifier formula when the image is at the near point (25 cm) is M = 1 + (D)/f.

Wait, if D is 25 cm and f is 5 cm, then M = 1 + 25/5 = 6. So that's the same as before. But that formula is supposed to apply when the image is at the near point, so perhaps that's the correct approach.

Wait, but that formula gives M=6, but the options don't have 6 as the magnification. Let me look again. Option C is 6.1, which is close, but the object distance is 3.9 cm, which doesn't match our calculated 4.17 cm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the image is at the near point. The question says the virtual image is 25 cm from the eye, which I took as the near point. So my calculation seems correct, but none of the options have M=6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. The magnification when the image is at the near point is M = 1 + (f)/(do). Wait, if I rearrange that, M = 1 + f/do → M-1 = f/do → do = f/(M-1).

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the magnification using M = (image distance)/(object distance). So M = di/do, but with signs.

Wait, di is -25 cm, do is 25/6 cm ≈4.1667 cm.

So M = (-25) / (25/6) )= (-25 *6)/25 = -6. The magnification is -6. But that can't be right because a simple magnifier should produce an upright image.

Wait, perhaps the formula for magnification when the image is virtual is M = |di/do|. So perhaps the magnification is 6, but that's not in the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for angular magnification when the image is at the near point is M = (D)/(f) + 1. So with D=25, f=5, M=(25/5)+1=5+1=6. So that's 6. But again, the options don't have 6. The closest is option C with 6.1.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the lens formula calculation. Let me redo it.

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

f=5 cm, di=-25 cm.

1/5 = 1/do + (1/-25).

→ 1/do = 1/5 - (-1/25) → 1/5 +1/25 = (5 +1)/25 =6/25 → do=25/6 ≈4.1667 cm.

So that's correct. So the object distance is approximately 4.17 cm, which is closest to option E's 4.2 cm.

But then the magnification, according to M=-di/do =6, but none of the options have exactly 6. So perhaps the question intended for the image to be at infinity, but that's not what it says.

Wait, let me consider the second part of the question: the magnification. Maybe I'm miscalculating it. Let's think differently: the magnification when the image is at the near point is given by M = (D)/(f) → D=25 cm, f=5 cm → M=5. Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps M = D/(u), where u is the object distance. So D=25 cm, u=25/6 ≈4.1667 cm. So M=25/(25/6)=6. So same result.

I think I must proceed with M=6, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option E, which has do=4.2 cm and M=5.9, which is close to 6.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, perhaps di is positive? No, because virtual images have negative di.

Wait, perhaps the lens formula I used is incorrect. Let me check the sign convention again. In some conventions, object distance is negative when on the same side as the incoming light. Wait no, usually, in the real is positive convention, object distance is positive for real objects, image distance is positive for real images (on the opposite side). So di is negative because it's virtual.

So the calculation seems correct. So the only conclusion is that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the closest is option E:4.2 cm and 5.9 magnification.

Wait, looking at option E: do=4.2 cm, M=5.9.

If do is 4.2 cm, then 1/do = approx 0.2381. 1/f is 0.2.

So 1/di = 1/f - 1/do → 0.2 - 0.2381 = -0.0381 → di≈-26.23 cm.

But the problem states di is -25 cm, so this would imply that with do=4.2, di would be about -26.23, which is not matching the problem's di of -25. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the equation again, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the image distance is positive because the image is on the same side as the object, so di is positive. But no, in standard conventions, virtual images have negative di.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, with di positive for real images, negative for virtual.

So if di is -25 cm, then:

1/5 = 1/do + (1/-25) → 1/do =1/5 +1/25 =6/25 → do=25/6≈4.1667 cm.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the correct magnification is M=6, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options
