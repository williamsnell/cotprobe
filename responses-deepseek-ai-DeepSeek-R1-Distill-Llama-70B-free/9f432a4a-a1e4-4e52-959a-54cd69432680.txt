Okay, so I've got this question here asking what 7% is equal to, and there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think...

Alright, I remember that the percent sign means per hundred. So when they say 7%, that translates to 7 per 100. To convert a percentage to a decimal, I divide by 100. So 7 divided by 100 is 0.07.

Wait, let me double-check that. If I take 100 and split it into 100 parts, each part is 1%. So 7% would be 7 of those parts. So 7 divided by 100 is 0.07. Yep, that makes sense.

Now looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A is 0.0007, which is way too small. That's 0.7%, right? Not 7. Option B is 700, which is way too big. Option C is 0.007, that's 0.7%. Option D is 0.007%, nope, that's even smaller. Option E is 0.7, which is 70%. Because 0.7 times 100 is 70. So E is 70%, not 7%.

Option F is 0.7%, which again is not 7%. Option G is 7, which is just seven, but that's a whole number. If the question was about 700%, that would be 7, but here it's 7%. So G is not correct. Option H is 70, which would be 7000% maybe? Wait, no, 70 is 70, which is 7000% divided by 100. Hmm, confusing, but not relevant here.

Option I is 7%, but that's the same as the question, so it's just restating. So probably not the correct answer since the question is asking what it's equal to, so they want the decimal form. Then, option J is 0.07. That matches what I thought earlier. So J is 0.07.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any options. So the correct decimal form of 7% is 0.07, which is option J. Yeah, that's right.

The question asks what 7% is equal to. To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide by 100. Thus, 7% becomes 0.07. Among the options provided, option J corresponds to 0.07, making it the correct answer.
