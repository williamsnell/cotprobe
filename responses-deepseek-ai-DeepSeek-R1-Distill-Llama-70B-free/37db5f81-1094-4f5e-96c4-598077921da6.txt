Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: An object is placed 100 cm from a plane mirror. How far is the image from the object? And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in optics, when dealing with mirrors, the position of the image depends on the type of mirror. But wait, the question specifies a plane mirror, so that should be a flat mirror, right? So it's not a concave or convex mirror. Plane mirrors are the regular flat ones you see every day, like in your bathroom or a handheld mirror.

Now, I'm trying to recall the rules about images formed by plane mirrors. I think the key points are that the image is virtual, and it's located behind the mirror. Also, the distance from the object to the mirror is equal to the distance from the image to the mirror. Oh right, so the image is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front.

So if the object is placed 100 cm in front of the mirror, the image should be 100 cm behind the mirror. But the question is asking how far the image is from the object, not the mirror. So I need to calculate the total distance between the object and the image.

Wait, the object is 100 cm in front, and the image is 100 cm behind. So the distance between them should be the sum of these two distances. Let me think: 100 cm (object to mirror) plus 100 cm (mirror to image) equals 200 cm total.

Looking at the options, I see option J is 200 cm. So the correct answer should be J.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up any concepts. Is there any scenario where the image distance is different with a plane mirror? No, I think the rule is consistent. The image distance is equal to the object distance, both measured from the mirror. So adding those gives the total distance between object and image.

Yes, I'm pretty confident now. The answer is J: 200 cm.

The question involves determining the distance between an object and its image when the object is placed 100 cm in front of a plane mirror. For a plane mirror, the image is virtual and located behind the mirror at a distance equal to the object's distance from the mirror. Thus, the object is 100 cm in front of the mirror, and the image is 100 cm behind it. The total distance between the object and the image is the sum of these two distances: 

\[
100 \, \text{cm} + 100 \, \text{cm} = 200 \, \text{cm}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **J: 200 cm**.
