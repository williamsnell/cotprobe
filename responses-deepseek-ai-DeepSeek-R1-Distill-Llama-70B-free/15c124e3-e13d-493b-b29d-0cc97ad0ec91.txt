Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about PTC tasting. Hmm, I remember that PTC tasting is a classic example of a dominant trait. The question has two parts, a) and b). Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part a), I need to calculate the allelic frequencies of T and t. The data given is that 60.4 percent of 798 students were tasters. Since tasting (T) is dominant, being a taster means you could be either TT or Tt. Non-tasters would be tt.

Wait, so the percentage of tasters is 60.4%, which is the sum of TT and Tt genotypes. Non-tasters are 39.6% (since 100% -60.4% = 39.6%). 

In a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies are p² for TT, 2pq for Tt, and q² for tt. Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele T, and q is the recessive t.

So the frequency of tt is q², which should equal 0.396 (since 39.6% are non-tasters). So to find q, I take the square root of 0.396. Let me calculate that.

Square root of 0.396 is approximately 0.629. So q is 0.629, which is the frequency of allele t. Then p is 1 - q, so 1 - 0.629 = 0.371. So p is 0.371 for T.

Wait, that would mean the frequencies are T=0.371 and t=0.629. Looking at the options, option A has T as 0.371 and t as 0.629. Hmm, but let me double-check that.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: 0.396 is approximately 39.6%. So square root of 0.396.

Let me compute sqrt(0.396). Since 0.6^2 is 0.36, 0.63^2 is 0.3969. Oh, right, so sqrt(0.396) is approximately 0.63. So q = 0.63, so t's frequency is 0.63, which is 63%. Therefore, T's frequency is 37%.

Wait, but 0.63 is approximately 0.629 in the options. Hmm, so option A says T is 0.371 and t is 0.629. So that seems correct for part a).

Now part b) asks how many students are TT, Tt, or tt. So we've got 798 students. 

We know that the genotype frequencies are:

TT: p² = (0.371)^2

Tt: 2pq = 2 * 0.371 * 0.629

tt: q² = (0.629)^2 = 0.396, which we already calculated.

Wait, but wait a second. Actually, wait, in part a) we found that q² is 0.396, so q is sqrt(0.396) which is ~0.63. So the frequencies are p=0.37 and q=0.63.

So let's compute each genotype's count.

TT: p² * total = (0.371)^2 *798. Let me compute 0.371 squared. 0.371 * 0.371 = approximately 0.1376. Then 0.1376 *798. Let's calculate that.

Well, 0.1376 * 800 would be 110.08, but since it's 798, subtract 0.1376*2=0.2752. So 110.08 -0.2752=109.8048. So about 110 students. But looking at the options, option A says 109 for TT. Close enough.

Tt: 2pq * 798 = 2*(0.371)*(0.629) *798.

First, calculate 2*0.371=0.742. 0.742 *0.629 = let's compute 0.7 *0.629 = 0.4403, 0.042 *0.629 ≈ 0.0264. So total ≈ 0.4403 +0.0264=0.4667. So 0.4667 *798.

Compute 0.4667 *800=373.36, minus 0.4667*2=0.9334. So 373.36 -0.9334=372.4266. So approximately 372. So about 372 students. Option A says 373, which is close.

tt: q² *798 = 0.396 *798. Let me compute 0.4*798=319.2, but 0.396 is 0.4 -0.004. So 319.2 - (0.004*798)= 319.2 -3.192=316.008. So about 316 students. 

So according to this, the numbers are TT:109, Tt:373, tt:316. So looking at the options, option A is exactly that. So option A would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes I confuse p and q. Since T is dominant, p is the frequency of the dominant allele. Oh wait, but in the model, usually, p is the dominant and q is the recessive? No, wait, actually, in Hardy-Weinberg, p and q are just the two alleles; it's arbitrary which is which unless specified. But in this case, the question says that T is dominant. So the frequency of the dominant allele would be p, and the recessive is q.

Wait, but in our calculations, we found that the frequency of t (the recessive) is 0.629, so q=0.629. Therefore, p=1 - q=0.371. So yes, that's correct.

So option A says for part a), T is 0.371 and t is 0.629, which matches. And the numbers are 109 TT, 373 Tt, 316 tt. So the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we calculate the allelic frequencies of T and t using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The percentage of tasters (60.4%) corresponds to the combined frequencies of the TT and Tt genotypes, while the percentage of non-tasters (39.6%) corresponds to the tt genotype. 

### Part (a): Allelic Frequencies
1. The frequency of the tt genotype is \( q^2 = 0.396 \). Taking the square root, \( q = \sqrt{0.396} \approx 0.629 \), which is the frequency of the recessive allele (t).
2. The frequency of the dominant allele (T) is \( p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.629 = 0.371 \).

Thus, the allelic frequencies are:
- \( T = 0.371 \)
- \( t = 0.629 \)

### Part (b): Number of Students with Each Genotype
Using the Hardy-Weinberg equations:
1. \( \text{TT} = p^2 \cdot 798 = (0.371)^2 \cdot 798 \approx 109 \)
2. \( \text{Tt} = 2pq \cdot 798 = 2(0.371)(0.629) \cdot 798 \approx 373 \)
3. \( \text{tt} = q^2 \cdot 798 = (0.629)^2 \cdot 798 \approx 316 \)

### Matching with Options
The calculated values match the data in **Option A**:
- Frequency of \( T = 0.371 \), \( t = 0.629 \)
- Number of students: \( \text{TT} = 109 \), \( \text{Tt} = 373 \), \( \text{tt} = 316 \)
