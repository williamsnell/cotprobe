Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick an option that shows a counterexample.

The argument is: ~K ≡ L / (K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)

Hmm, wait. I think the argument is in the form of a premise leading to a conclusion. So the premise is ~K if and only if L, and the conclusion is (K and L) or (K and not L). Or maybe the way it's written is that ~K ≡ L is the premise, and the conclusion is (K·L) ∨ (K·~L). I need to parse this correctly.

Wait, in logic, the symbol '/' is sometimes used to separate premises from conclusions. So I think the argument is: If ~K is equivalent to L, then (K·L) ∨ (K·~L). Or maybe it's presented as a single statement where the premise is ~K ≡ L, and the conclusion is (K·L) ∨ (K·~L). So the argument is assuming ~K ≡ L and then concluding (K·L) ∨ (K·~L). So we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.

Wait, but the way it's written is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's an argument with one premise: ~K ≡ L, and then the conclusion is (K·L) ∨ (K·~L). So the structure is: Premise: ~K ≡ L. Conclusion: (K·L) ∨ (K·~L). So is this a valid argument?

To check validity, I can construct a truth table for all possible truth values of K and L, and see in each case whether whenever the premise is true, the conclusion is also true. If in any case the premise is true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that case is a counterexample.

Alternatively, maybe the argument is presented as a single conditional statement: If ~K ≡ L, then (K·L) ∨ (K·~L). So the conditional is (~K ≡ L) → [(K·L) ∨ (K·~L)]. To see if this is a tautology.

Let me think. So the approach is: construct a truth table for all variables involved. There are two variables, K and L, so four possible combinations.

Let me outline the columns I need:

1. K
2. L
3. ~K (negation of K)
4. ~K ≡ L (equivalence between ~K and L)
5. K·L (K and L)
6. K·~L (K and not L)
7. (K·L) ∨ (K·~L) (the conclusion)

So I'll make a table for all four cases.

Case 1: K = T, L = T
~K = F
~K ≡ L: F ≡ T? No, so F.
K·L = T
K·~L = F (since L is T, ~L is F)
Conclusion: T ∨ F = T

So in this case, premise is F, conclusion is T. So the conditional (premise → conclusion) is T because a false premise makes the implication true.

Case 2: K = T, L = F
~K = F
~K ≡ L: F ≡ F? Yes, so T.
K·L = F
K·~L = T (since L is F, ~L is T)
Conclusion: F ∨ T = T

Here, premise is T, conclusion is T. So implication holds.

Case 3: K = F, L = T
~K = T
~K ≡ L: T ≡ T? Yes, so T.
K·L = F
K·~L = F (since K is F)
Conclusion: F ∨ F = F

Wait a minute, the conclusion here is F. The premise is T, and the conclusion is F. So in this case, the implication (premise → conclusion) is F. Which means the argument is invalid because there's a case where the premise is true, but the conclusion is false. So this would be a counterexample.

Case 4: K = F, L = F
~K = T
~K ≡ L: T ≡ F? No, so F.
K·L = F
K·~L = F
Conclusion: F ∨ F = F

Here, premise is F, conclusion is F. The implication holds because a false premise makes the implication true.

So from the four cases, the only case where the premise is true is when K=T, L=F (case 2) and K=F, L=T (case 3). In case 2, the conclusion is T, so implication holds. In case 3, conclusion is F, so implication fails. Therefore, the argument is invalid because there's at least one case where premise is true and conclusion is false.

Now, looking for the counterexample. The counterexample is when the premise is true, and the conclusion is false. Looking at case 3: K=F, L=T. So when K is false and L is true, the premise ~K ≡ L becomes T ≡ T, which is true. But the conclusion (K·L) ∨ (K·~L) is (F·T) ∨ (F·F) = F ∨ F = F. So conclusion is false.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. In case 3: K=F, L=T.

~K is T, so ~K ≡ L is T ≡ T: True.

Then, the conclusion is (K·L) ∨ (K·~L) = (F·T) ∨ (F·F) = F ∨ F = F. So yes, conclusion is false. So that's a counterexample.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and L is false.

Wait, in case 2: K=T, L=F. That's when the premise is true, and the conclusion is true. So that's not a counterexample. The counterexample is case 3: K=F, L=T.

So looking for an option where the counterexample is when K is false and L is true.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when L is true and K is false. That's exactly case 3.

Option H: Invalid. Counterexample when L is false and K is true. No, that's case 2, which isn't a counterexample.

Option I: Invalid. Counterexample when both K and L are false. In that case, premise is F, conclusion F. Not a counterexample.

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when K and L are true. In case 1, premise is F; not a counterexample.

Option A: Counterexample when K is true, L is false. That's case 2, where the conclusion is true. So no, it's not a counterexample.

Option D is the one that states the correct counterexample.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's re-examine the conclusion.

The conclusion is (K·L) ∨ (K·~L). Can that be simplified? Let's see. Factor K out: K·(L ∨ ~L). Since L ∨ ~L is always true, the conclusion simplifies to K·T, which is K. So the conclusion is equivalent to K.

Wait, that's interesting. So the conclusion is K. So the argument is: If ~K ≡ L, then K.

Hmm, that's a different way to look at it. So the premise is ~K ↔ L, which is equivalent to (K → L) and (L → ~K). Or, it's equivalent to K ≡ ~L, because ~K ≡ L is the same as K ≡ ~L.

So the conclusion being K, the argument is: If K is equivalent to ~L, then K must be true.

Wait, that seems a bit more clear. So the argument is: If K is equivalent to not L, then K is true.

But is that necessarily true? Let's see.

If K is equivalent to ~L, then whenever K is true, ~L is true, and vice versa. So let's consider when K is true: then ~L is true, so L is false. But K can be true or false, depending on L.

Wait, but when K is equivalent to ~L, K and L can be:

Case 1: K=T, L=F (satisfies K ≡ ~L)
Case 2: K=F, L=T (also satisfies K ≡ ~L)

So in the first case, the conclusion (K) is true. In the second case, the conclusion is false. So when the premise holds (i.e., K is equivalent to ~L), the conclusion can be either true or false, depending on the case. Therefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow.

So the argument is invalid because there's a case (K=F, L=T) where the premise is true, but the conclusion is false.

Therefore, the correct option is D: Invalid. Counterexample when L is true and K is false.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D says: "Invalid. Counterexample when L is true and K is false." Which matches our case 3.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the validity of the argument **~K ≡ L / (K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)**, we construct a truth table for all possible truth values of **K** and **L**. The argument is valid if, in every case where the premise **~K ≡ L** is true, the conclusion **(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)** is also true. If there is any case where the premise is true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that case serves as a counterexample.

### Truth Table Analysis:
1. **Case 1: K = T, L = T**
   - **~K = F**
   - **~K ≡ L = F ≡ T = F** (premise is false)
   - **K · L = T · T = T**
   - **K · ~L = T · F = F**
   - **(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L) = T ∨ F = T** (conclusion is true)
   - Implication holds.

2. **Case 2: K = T, L = F**
   - **~K = F**
   - **~K ≡ L = F ≡ F = T** (premise is true)
   - **K · L = T · F = F**
   - **K · ~L = T · T = T**
   - **(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L) = F ∨ T = T** (conclusion is true)
   - Implication holds.

3. **Case 3: K = F, L = T**
   - **~K = T**
   - **~K ≡ L = T ≡ T = T** (premise is true)
   - **K · L = F · T = F**
   - **K · ~L = F · F = F**
   - **(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L) = F ∨ F = F** (conclusion is false)
   - Implication fails. This is a counterexample.

4. **Case 4: K = F, L = F**
   - **~K = T**
   - **~K ≡ L = T ≡ F = F** (premise is false)
   - **K · L = F · F = F**
   - **K · ~L = F · T = F**
   - **(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L) = F ∨ F = F** (conclusion is false)
   - Implication holds.

### Conclusion:
The argument is **invalid** because there is a counterexample: when **K = F** and **L = T**, the premise **~K ≡ L** is true, but the conclusion **(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)** is false. This corresponds to **Option D**.
