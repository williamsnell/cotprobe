Question:

A buyer contracted in writing to purchase 1,000 gidgets (which are similar to widgets but are more popular because of their greater durability and- resiliency) from a manufacturer for a total contract price of $4,000. After this agreement was executed and before delivery, the buyer and the manufacturer agreed in a telephone conversation to change the quantity term from 1,000 to 800 gidgets. This modification is probably unenforceable, because

Options:

A: it violates the statute of frauds.
B: there was no consideration.
C: the original contract was in writing.
D: the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The situation is: A buyer contracted in writing to buy 1,000 gidgets for $4,000. Then, after the agreement was made but before delivery, the buyer and manufacturer agreed over the phone to change the quantity from 1,000 to 800. The question is why this modification is probably unenforceable.

The options are A through D, and the answer is one of them. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm. I remember that contract modifications can sometimes be tricky, especially when it comes to the Statute of Frauds or consideration. Let me think about the key points here.

First, the original contract was in writing. So that's a written agreement for the sale of goods. I think the Statute of Frauds requires contracts for the sale of goods over a certain amount to be in writing. Wait, the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) applies here because it's a sale of goods. So under UCC ยง 2-201, contracts for goods priced $500 or more must be in writing to be enforceable. Here, the contract is $4,000, so it's definitely covered by the Statute of Frauds.

Now, the modification was done orally. So they changed the quantity term from 1,000 to 800. The question is whether this oral modification is enforceable.

Wait, I remember something about the Statute of Frauds and modifications. Does the original contract being in writing affect modifications? Or is it about consideration for the modification?

Wait, there's a doctrine called the pre-existing duty rule. Normally, a modification of a contract needs new consideration to be enforceable. But wait, under the UCC, I think there's an exception. Let me recall: UCC ยง 2-209 deals with modifications. It says that an agreement modifying a contract within the Statute of Frauds needs to be in writing, but there's an exception when the modification is executed, I think. Wait, no, maybe it's when the goods are accepted or payment made. Or perhaps consideration isn't required under UCC 2-209.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. Under common law, to modify a contract, you need consideration. But under UCC 2-209, a modification can be enforceable even without consideration as long as it's not a substitute for an existing duty. But wait, if the modification is for a reduced quantity, is that a problem?

Wait, the original contract was for 1,000 gidgets at $4,000. So the price per gidget is $4 each. If they reduce the quantity to 800, but presumably the total price would then be $3,200? Or did they adjust the total price? Wait, the question doesn't say the price was adjusted, just the quantity. So perhaps the modification is reducing the number of gidgets but keeping the total price the same? Or maybe the price per unit is adjusted. Hmm, the question isn't clear on that. But maybe it's not necessary for the question.

Wait, the question is about why the modification is unenforceable. So the possible issues are either Statute of Frauds or lack of consideration.

Option A says it violates the Statute of Frauds. So if the original contract was in writing, and the modification is oral, does that make it unenforceable? Or is the modification a new contract that would also need to be in writing?

Alternatively, option B is about no consideration. So if the modification was a mutual change, but without any new consideration, is it unenforceable under common law? But under UCC 2-209, consideration isn't required for a modification, as long as the modification isn't unconscionable or the like.

Wait, but UCC 2-209(1) says that a contract can be modified without additional consideration if the modification is in good faith. So consideration might not be the issue here. So option B might not be correct.

Wait, but the modification here reduces the quantity. So perhaps the buyer is getting less, but is the manufacturer agreeing to it? Maybe, but in terms of consideration, perhaps there's no new consideration because both parties are just changing terms without exchanging anything new.

Wait, but under UCC 2-209, the requirement of consideration is relaxed. So a modification without consideration is enforceable unless it's unconscionable. So in that case, the lack of consideration (option B) wouldn't make it unenforceable. So option B might not be the correct answer.

Option C says the original contract was in writing. But the original contract being in writing doesn't necessarily make the modification unenforceable. It's about the Statute of Frauds for the modification. So if the modification is oral, does it need to be in writing?

Wait, the original contract is in writing. So under the Statute of Frauds, any modification that would bring the contract outside the SoF requirements needs to be in writing. Wait, but the original contract was for 1,000 gidgets, which is over $500, so it's covered by SoF. If the modification reduces the quantity, maybe the price would now be below $500? Let's see: 800 gidgets at $4 each would be $3,200, which is way over $500. So the modified contract is still above the SoF threshold, so the modification itself doesn't take it out of SoF. Therefore, the modification would still need to be in writing to be enforceable because it's a contract for goods over $500.

Wait, but the modification was oral. So under UCC 2-209, any modification that is within the SoF (i.e., the modified contract is still for goods over $500) must be in writing, right? Because the original contract was in writing, but if the modification brings a term within the SoF, it needs to be written. Wait, no. Let me think again. The Statute of Frauds applies to the original contract, and the modification doesn't necessarily have to be in writing unless it's a new contract that would fall under the SoF. But in this case, the modification (from 1,000 to 800) would result in a contract for 800 gidgets at, say, the same price per unit, so 800*$4 = $3,200, which is way over $500. So the modified contract is still within the SoF. Therefore, any agreement to modify the quantity term (a term that affects the SoF) would need to be in writing. Because if the original contract was written, and you're changing a term that's material (like quantity), then the modification must be in writing to be enforceable under SoF.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the modification is a new agreement that would itself need to be in writing. So because the original contract was in writing, any modification to a term that's covered by the SoF must also be in writing. So the oral agreement to change the quantity is not in writing, so it violates the SoF. Thus, the modification is unenforceable because it's oral and should have been in writing.

So option A says it violates the Statute of Frauds. That would make sense if the modification had to be in writing. So that would be the reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is consideration. But under UCC 2-209, consideration isn't needed. So option B is incorrect.

Option C says the original contract was in writing. But that's a fact, but not the reason for unenforceability. The reason would be SoF or consideration.

Option D is the parol evidence rule, which deals with prior or contemporaneous agreements contradicting a written contract. But here, the modification is subsequent, so the parol evidence rule doesn't apply. So D is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the modification is oral, and because the modified contract is still within the Statute of Frauds (exceeds $500), the modification needs to be in writing. So the answer is A.

The question involves a written contract for the sale of 1,000 gidgets for $4,000, which was modified orally to reduce the quantity to 800 gidgets. The issue is why this modification is unenforceable.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) ยง 2-201, contracts for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more must be in writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The original contract, being for $4,000, clearly falls under this requirement. When the parties orally modified the quantity term, the modified contract (for 800 gidgets at the same price per unit) would still exceed $500, meaning it remains subject to the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, the oral modification violates the Statute of Frauds because it was not in writing.

Option B, concerning lack of consideration, is not the correct reason because UCC ยง 2-209 relaxes the requirement of consideration for modifications, allowing them to be enforceable as long as they are made in good faith. Option C, which states that the original contract was in writing, is a fact but not the reason for unenforceability. Option D, regarding the parol evidence rule, is irrelevant because the rule applies to prior or contemporaneous agreements, not subsequent modifications.

Thus, the modification is unenforceable because it violates the Statute of Frauds by not being in writing.
