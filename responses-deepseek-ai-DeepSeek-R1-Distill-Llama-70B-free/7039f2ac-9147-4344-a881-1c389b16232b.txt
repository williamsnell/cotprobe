Question:

Two ice skaters are moving on frictionless ice and are about to collide. The 50-kg skater is moving directly west at 4 m/s. The 75-kg skater is moving directly north at 2 m/s. After the collision they stick together. For this scenario, which of the following is true?

Options:

A: Neither the kinetic energy nor the linear momentum of the system is conserved.
B: The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.
C: The linear momentum of the system is not conserved because the net force on the system is zero.
D: Only the kinetic energy of the system is conserved because it is an inelastic collision.
E: Both the kinetic energy and linear momentum of the system are conserved because it is an elastic collision.
F: The linear momentum of the system is not conserved because the net force on the system is nonzero during the collision.
G: Only the kinetic energy of the system is conserved because the collision is frictionless.
H: Only the kinetic energy of the system is conserved because it is an elastic collision.
I: The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is nonzero during the collision.
J: The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is nonzero.

Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again and think through each part.

So, there are two ice skaters on frictionless ice. One is 50 kg moving west at 4 m/s, and the other is 75 kg moving north at 2 m/s. They collide and stick together. The question is about whether kinetic energy and linear momentum are conserved.

I remember that in collisions, whether momentum and kinetic energy are conserved depends on the type of collision. There are two main types: elastic and inelastic. 

Linear momentum is conserved in any collision as long as there are no external forces acting on the system. Because the ice is frictionless, I don't think there are any external forces during the collision. So momentum should be conserved regardless of whether the collision is elastic or inelastic. But wait, the collision here is inelastic because they stick together. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy isn't conserved because some is lost as heat or other forms of energy.

Looking at the options:

Option B says linear momentum is conserved because the net force is zero. That makes sense because in the system of two skaters, the internal forces during collision don't affect the conservation since the external forces are zero. So B sounds correct.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option D says only kinetic energy is conserved because it's inelastic. No, that's wrong because kinetic energy isn't conserved in inelastic collisions. So D is incorrect.

Option E says both are conserved because it's elastic. No, the problem says they stick, which is inelastic, so E is wrong.

Option B says the net force is zero, which is the reason for momentum conservation. Right, because the external forces are zero, so the momentum of the system is conserved. So B is correct.

Other options: Option F says momentum isn't conserved because net force is non-zero. That's wrong because net external force is zero, so F is incorrect.

Option H and G talk about kinetic energy being conserved, which isn't the case here. So they're out.

So the correct answer should be B: The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.

The problem involves two ice skaters on frictionless ice who collide and stick together. The 50-kg skater is moving west at 4 m/s, and the 75-kg skater is moving north at 2 m/s. The question asks whether kinetic energy and linear momentum are conserved in this scenario.

In any collision, the conservation of linear momentum depends on the presence of external forces. Since the ice is frictionless, there are no external forces acting on the system during the collision. Therefore, linear momentum is conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in this case because the collision is inelastic (the skaters stick together), and some kinetic energy is lost as heat or other forms of energy.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** is correct because it correctly states that linear momentum is conserved due to the absence of external forces.
- **Option D** is incorrect because kinetic energy is not conserved in inelastic collisions.
- **Option E** is incorrect because the collision is inelastic, not elastic.
- **Option F** is incorrect because the net external force is zero, so linear momentum is conserved.
- **Options G, H, and J** are incorrect because they either misstate the conservation of kinetic energy or the role of forces in momentum conservation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.**
