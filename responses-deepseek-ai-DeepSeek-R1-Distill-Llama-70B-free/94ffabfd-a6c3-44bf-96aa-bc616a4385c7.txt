Okay, so I've got this question about a hydrogen atom absorbing and then emitting a photon. Hmm, I remember that hydrogen atoms have energy levels, and when they absorb or emit photons, electrons move between these levels. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says it's a ground-state hydrogen atom. Oh right, the ground state is the lowest energy level, which is n=1. So initially, the electron is in n=1.

It absorbs a photon with a wavelength of 97.2 nm. Wait, I need to find out the energy of that photon to see which energy level it's moving to. Oh wait, the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. But wait, for hydrogen atoms, I think the energy levels are quantized and given by the formula E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So maybe I can calculate the energy of the absorbed photon and see how it affects the electron's energy level.

But calculating the exact energy might be tricky without a calculator, but maybe I can find the energy difference between levels. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Rydberg formula, which relates wavelengths to energy levels. The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where R is the Rydberg constant, approximately 1.097e4 m⁻¹. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the photon is absorbed, so the electron moves to a higher energy level. So n_initial is 1, and n_final after absorbing would be higher. Then it emits a photon of 486 nm, which means it transitions to a lower level again. So after emitting, it's in some state n_final. I need to find that state.

Let's tackle the absorption first. The photon's wavelength is 97.2 nm, which is in the ultraviolet range. So the energy is higher than visible light. Let me compute the energy of this photon. Using E=hc/λ.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s, λ is 97.2 nm which is 97.2e-9 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (97.2e-9). Let's compute that numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divide by 97.2e-9: 1.9878e-25 / 97.2e-9 = approx 2.045e-17 J. Now, convert that to electron volts, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E = (2.045e-17) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 12.76 eV.

Wait, the energy levels of hydrogen are E_n = -13.6 / n². So the initial energy is E_1 = -13.6 eV. After absorbing 12.76 eV, the new energy would be E = -13.6 + 12.76 = -0.84 eV? That doesn't make sense because all energy levels are negative. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the energy difference.

Wait, maybe I should use the Rydberg formula to find the transition. Let me think, when the electron absorbs a photon, it goes from n=1 to a higher n. Let's say it goes to n=2, 3, etc. The energy of the absorbed photon should match the difference between E_n and E_1.

So the energy difference ΔE = E_final - E_initial. Since E_initial is E_1 = -13.6 eV, and E_final is E_n = -13.6/n². So ΔE = (-13.6/n²) - (-13.6) ) = 13.6 (1 - 1/n²).

So ΔE is the energy of the absorbed photon. We found that the photon's energy is about 12.76 eV. So 13.6 (1 - 1/n²) = 12.76 → 1 - 1/n² = 12.76 /13.6 ≈ 0.938. So 1/n² = 1 - 0.938 = 0.062 → n² = 1/0.062 ≈16.13 → n ≈4 (since 4^2 is 16). So the electron moves to n=4 after absorbing the photon.

Wait, but 12.76 is close to 13.6*(1-1/16) = 13.6*(15/16)= about 12.75. Yes, that's right. So n=4.

Then, the atom emits a photon with wavelength 486 nm. So the electron transitions from n=4 to a lower level, say n=2, because 486 nm is the H-beta line, which is from n=4 to n=2. Let me confirm that.

The Rydberg formula for emission is 1/λ = R(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where n₂ > n₁ because it's emission (to lower energy level). So, for the emitted photon, 486 nm is 486e-9 m.

Compute 1/λ: 1/(486e-9) ≈ 2.058e6 m^-1.

R is 1.097e7 m^-1. So 2.058e6 ≈ 1.097e7 (1/n₁² - 1/n₂^2). Let me compute the right side.

Wait, perhaps I can find n₁ and n₂. Let me take n₂ as the higher level and n₁ as the lower. So in emission, the electron drops from a higher level to a lower one.

So, let me say the transition is from n=4 to n=2. Let me compute 1/λ using Rydberg's formula.

1/λ = R (1/2² - 1/4²) = R (1/4 - 1/16) = R ( (4-1)/16 ) = (3/16) R.

R is 1.097e7 m⁻¹. So 3/16 * 1.097e7 = (0.1875) * 1.097e7 = approx 2.06e6 m⁻¹. Which matches the 1/λ we have for 486 nm (since 1/486e-9 is about 2.06e6). So yes, the transition is from 4→2.

So after emission, the electron is in n=2. So the final state is n=2, which is option E.

The problem involves a ground-state hydrogen atom (initially in \( n = 1 \)) absorbing a photon of wavelength \( 97.2 \, \mathrm{nm} \), transitioning to a higher energy level, and then emitting a photon of wavelength \( 486 \, \mathrm{nm} \), transitioning back to a lower energy level. The goal is to determine the final state of the hydrogen atom.

### Step 1: Analyze the absorption process
The energy of the absorbed photon is calculated using the formula \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 97.2 \, \mathrm{nm} = 97.2 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m} \). The energy is found to be approximately \( 12.76 \, \mathrm{eV} \).

The energy levels of hydrogen are quantized and given by \( E_n = -\frac{13.6}{n^2} \, \mathrm{eV} \). The energy difference between the initial state (\( n = 1 \)) and the final state after absorption is:

\[
\Delta E = 13.6 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n^2} \right).
\]

Setting \( \Delta E = 12.76 \, \mathrm{eV} \), we solve for \( n \):

\[
1 - \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{12.76}{13.6} \approx 0.938 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{n^2} \approx 0.062 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n^2 \approx 16.13 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n \approx 4.
\]

Thus, after absorbing the photon, the electron transitions to \( n = 4 \).

### Step 2: Analyze the emission process
The atom emits a photon of wavelength \( 486 \, \mathrm{nm} \), which corresponds to the \( n = 4 \to n = 2 \) transition. Using the Rydberg formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m^{-1}} \), \( n_1 = 2 \), and \( n_2 = 4 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{4^2} \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \cdot \frac{3}{16}.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} \approx 2.06 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m^{-1}}.
\]

This matches the wavelength of \( 486 \, \mathrm{nm} \), confirming the transition is \( n = 4 \to n = 2 \).

### Final State
After emitting the photon, the electron is in \( n = 2 \). Therefore, the final state of the hydrogen atom is \( n = 2 \).
