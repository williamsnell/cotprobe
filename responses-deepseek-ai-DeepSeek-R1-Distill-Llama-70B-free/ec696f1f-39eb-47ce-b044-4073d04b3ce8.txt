Question:

A man decided to stop at a drive-through hamburger stand for a late snack. As he drove up to the drive- through line, the manager of the hamburger stand informed him through the intercom system that the restaurant was closing and no further orders would be accepted. She told the man that the last car to be served was the one directly in front of him. The man became angry and yelled into the intercom machine, "Listen, babe, I am hungry. I want two cheeseburgers, a large order of fries, and a Coke. " The manager retorted, "I'm terribly sorry, but we cannot accept your order. "Shortly thereafter, the manager handed the food order to the passengers in the car immediately in front of the man's. When the man saw the manager serving that car, he became very angry, drove his automobile up to the service window and shouted at the manager, "You can't do this to me. " When the manager laughed, the man suddenly reached into the car's glove compartment and pulled out a gun. He aimed at the manager and fired the weapon, intending to hit her. The bullet missed the manager but hit a customer, wounding him in the head. In an action by the customer against the man for battery, the customer will be

Options:

A: successful, because the man caused harm with his actions, regardless of his intent.
B: unsuccessful, because the man was not aiming at the customer.
C: unsuccessful, because the manager could have prevented the situation by accepting the man's order.
D: successful, because the man was acting recklessly and created a dangerous situation.
E: unsuccessful, because the man could not foresee that the bullet would hit anyone other than the manager.
F: unsuccessful, because the man was provoked by the manager's refusal to serve him.
G: unsuccessful, because the man did not intend to shoot the customer.
H: successful, because there was a "substantial certainty" that the customer would be hit by the bullet.
I: successful, because the man intended to shoot the manager.
J: successful, because the bullet from the man's gun directly caused the customer's injury.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically battery. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a bit involved. Let me read it again. A man goes to a drive-through, but the manager says they're closing and won't take his order. He gets angry, yells, and then when the car in front gets served, he becomes even more upset. He drives up, shouts, and when the manager laughs, he pulls out a gun, aims at her, and fires. The bullet misses her but hits another customer, wounding him. Now, the customer is suing the man for battery.

I need to figure out whether the customer will succeed in this action. The options are A through J, each presenting a different legal argument.

First, I should recall the elements of battery. Battery is an intentional tort, which requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant acted with the intent to cause harmful or offensive contact with the plaintiff, or an imminent apprehension of such contact, and that the contact actually occurred.

So, the key here is intent. The man intended to shoot the manager, but he hit the customer instead. Now, is there a way to hold him liable for battery against the customer?

I remember something about transferred intent. Transferred intent applies when the defendant intends to commit a tort against one person but ends up harming another. For example, if I throw a rock at Alice but hit Bob, I can still be held liable for battery against Bob under transferred intent.

In this case, the man intended to shoot the manager. But since he missed and hit the customer, the intent transfers. So, the intent to harm the manager is imputed to the customer for the purpose of establishing liability.

Looking at the options:

A: Successful because harm was caused regardless of intent. That doesn't sound right because battery requires intent.

B: Unsuccessful because he wasn't aiming at the customer. But transferred intent should cover this.

C: Manager's fault for not taking the order. That's more about causation, but not directly related to intent.

D: Acting recklessly. Well, battery is about intent, not recklessness. Recklessness might apply in negligence, but this is about intentional tort.

E: Couldn't foresee the bullet hitting someone else. But in transferred intent, it's about the intent, not foreseeability.

F: Provoked by the manager. Provocation is more of a defense in some cases, but I don't think it negates intent here.

G: No intent to shoot the customer. But transferred intent says the intent is transferred.

H: Substantial certainty. That's more a standard for recklessness or negligence, not battery.

I: Intended to shoot the manager. This is about transferred intent, so the intent exists, just towards a different person.

J: Bullet caused injury. That's about causation, but not intent.

So, the correct reasoning would involve transferred intent. The man intended to shoot the manager, so the intent is transferred to the customer he hit. Therefore, the customer should succeed.

Looking at the options, I think option I says he intended to shoot the manager, which is correct, and under transferred intent, that's enough. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but some might think about option G, which says unsuccessful because he didn't intend to shoot the customer. But transferred intent makes that irrelevant. So G is incorrect.

So the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the customer can successfully sue the man for battery after being accidentally shot. Battery requires intent to cause harmful or offensive contact, which can be established through transferred intent. The man intended to shoot the manager, and under transferred intent, this intent transfers to the unintended victim, the customer. Therefore, the customer's action for battery will succeed.

Option I correctly identifies that the man intended to shoot the manager, and through transferred intent, this satisfies the intent requirement for battery against the customer.

Answer: I
