Okay, so I've got this question about fluid mechanics, specifically dealing with open channel flow. Hmm, I remember that Manning's equation is used for calculating the flow velocity in open channels. Let's see what the question says.

The channel is long with a rectangular cross-section and an unfinished concrete surface. The width is 35 ft, and the slope is 0.5 degrees. They're asking for the water depth when the channel carries 3500 cubic feet per second. I think the first step is to find the Manning coefficient. Looking at the table provided, for an unfinished concrete surface, the n value is 0.017. Got that.

Manning's equation is V = (1/n) * (R)^(2/3) * S^(1/2), where V is the flow velocity, R is the hydraulic radius, and S is the slope (in decimal form, so 0.5 degrees would be 0.008726... or wait, no, wait. Wait, the slope is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to a decimal for S. Oh wait, no, the slope S is the sine of the angle when it's in degrees. Because when the angle is small, the sine is approximately equal to the tangent, which is the rise over run. But I might have to calculate sin(0.5 degrees). Alternatively, since 0.5 degrees is a small angle, maybe I can approximate it as S = tan(theta) ≈ sin(theta). But for more accuracy, I should compute sin(0.5 deg). Let me think. 0.5 degrees is 0.008726 radians. The sine of that is approximately 0.008726. So S is 0.008726.

Wait, no. Wait, the slope is given as 0.5 degrees, which is the angle of the channel. So the slope S is the tangent of that angle, which is approximately equal to the angle in radians when it's small. So S = tan(0.5°). Let me calculate that. Let me convert 0.5 degrees to radians: 0.5 * (pi/180) ≈ 0.0087265 radians. The tan(0.5°) is approximately 0.0087265 as well since for small angles, tan(theta) ≈ theta in radians. So S is 0.0087265.

Now, the flow rate Q is given as 3500 ft³/s. For a rectangular channel, Q = V * A, where A is the cross-sectional area. The area for a rectangle is width * depth, so A = 35 * y, where y is the depth. So Q = V * 35 * y.

Putting it all together, I can write Q = (1/n) * R^(2/3) * S^(1/2) * A.

But what's R, the hydraulic radius? For a rectangle, R = (width * depth) / (width + 2*depth). Since the channel is much wider than it is deep, the perimeter is approximately 35 + 2y ≈ 35, so R ≈ (35 y) / 35 = y. Wait, no. Let me think again. The hydraulic radius R is the area divided by the wetted perimeter. The area is 35y. The wetted perimeter is 35 + 2y (since the channel is rectangular, the two sides and the bottom are wetted). So R = (35y) / (35 + 2y). But if the depth y is much smaller than the width, which is often the case, then 2y is negligible compared to 35, so R ≈ (35y)/35 = y. But I'm not sure if that's a valid approximation here. Maybe I should proceed without approximating and see if it's necessary later.

So substituting R into Manning's equation, we have:

V = (1/n) * [ (35y)/(35 + 2y) ]^(2/3) * S^(1/2 )

Then, Q = V * A = [ (1/n) * (R)^(2/3) * S^(1/2) ) ] * (35y )

So substituting R:

Q = (1/n) * [ (35y)/(35 + 2y) ) ]^(2/3) * sqrt(S) ) * 35 y

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange the equation to solve for y.

Let me write the equation as:

Q = (1/n) * (35y / (35 + 2y) )^(2/3) * sqrt(S) * 35 y

Let me plug in the known values:

n=0.017, Q=3500, width=35, S=0.008726.

So,

3500 = (1/0.017) * [ (35y)/(35 + 2y) ) ]^(2/3) * sqrt(0.008726) * 35 y

First, let's compute the constants:

1/0.017 ≈ 58.8235

sqrt(0.008726) ≈ 0.0934

So,

3500 = 58.8235 * [ (35y)/(35 + 2y) ) ]^(2/3) * 0.0934 * 35 y

Let me compute 58.8235 * 0.0934 ≈ 5.5, and 5.5 *35 ≈ 192.5.

Wait, wait, let me compute step by step.

Calculate each part:

58.8235 * 0.0934 = let's compute 58.8235 * 0.0934.

Hmm, 58.8235 * 0.09 = 5.2941, 58.8235 * 0.0034 ≈ 0.2002. So total ≈ 5.4943.

Then, 5.4943 * 35 = 5.4943 *35 = 192.3005.

So the equation becomes:

3500 = 192.3 * [ (35y)/(35 + 2y) ) ]^(2/3) * y

Hmm, simplifying:

Divide both sides by 192.3:

3500 / 192.3 ≈ 18.2 = [ (35y)/(35 + 2y) ) ]^(2/3) * y

So,

[ (35y)/(35 + 2y) ) ]^(2/3) * y = 18.2

Let me make a substitution: let’s set u = y, to make it easier. So,

( (35u) / (35 + 2u) )^(2/3) * u = 18.2

This is a nonlinear equation in u. Solving this analytically might be tricky, so I might need to use an iterative approach or make an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate R as y, as I thought earlier. Let me see if that's valid.

If I assume that 2y is much smaller than 35, then 35 +2y ≈ 35, so R ≈ (35u)/35 = u. So,

[ u ]^(2/3) * u = u^(5/3) = 18.2

So,

u^(5/3) =18.2 → u = (18.2)^(3/5)

Calculate 18.2^(3/5). Let's see, 3/5 is 0.6, so 18.2^0.6.

Well, 10^0.6 is about 3.98, 20^0.6 is around 5.24. 18.2 is close to 20, so maybe around 5.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Take natural log: ln(18.2) ≈ 2.897.

Multiply by 0.6: 2.897 * 0.6 ≈ 1.738.

Exponentiate: e^1.738 ≈ 5.68. So u ≈5.68 ft.

But wait, if u is 5.68 ft, then 2u is 11.36, which is about a third of 35, so 35 +2u =46.36. So the denominator isn't that negligible. So my initial assumption that R ≈ u might not be accurate. Therefore, the approximation might be off.

Hmm, so perhaps I should proceed without that assumption. Let me instead consider the equation again.

Let me try an iterative approach. Let's make an initial guess for y and see if it satisfies the equation.

Let me try y=5 ft.

Compute (35*5)/(35+10) = 175/45 ≈3.8889.

Then, (3.8889)^(2/3) ≈ (3.8889)^(0.6667). Let me compute 3.8889^(2/3).

3.8889 is close to 3.375 (which is 15/4^3, but wait, perhaps cube of 1.5 is 3.375). Wait, 3.8889 is about 3.89. Let me compute 3.89^(1/3) first.

Cube root of 3.89 is approximately 1.57, because 1.57^3 ≈ 3.89 (since 1.5^3=3.375 and 1.6^3=4.096). So 3.89^(1/3)=~1.57, so 3.89^(2/3)= (1.57)^2 ≈ 2.4649.

Then, y=5, so the term is 5 * 2.4649 ≈12.3245. But we needed it to be 18.2, so 12.3 is lower. So y needs to be larger than 5.

Wait, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the substitution. Let me go back.

The equation after substitution is:

[ (35y)/(35 + 2y) ) ]^(2/3) * y = 18.2

I tried y=5: [ (175/45) ]^(2/3) *5 = [3.8889]^(2/3) *5 ≈ (3.8889^0.6667)*5 ≈ 3.8889^0.6667 is approximately 3.8889^(2/3) ≈ 3.8889^(2/3) ≈ (3.8889^(1/3))^2.

Wait, 3.8889^(1/3) is about 1.57, so squared is ~2.4649. So 2.4649 *5 =12.3245. Which is less than 18.2. So I need a higher y.

Let me try y=6.

(35*6)/(35+12) = 210/47 ≈4.4681.

4.4681^(2/3) = (4.4681^(1/3))^2.

Cube root of 4.4681 is approximately 1.65, because 1.65^3=4.49, which is close to 4.4681. So (1.65)^2 is approx 2.7225. Then, multiply by y=6: 2.7225 *6≈16.335. Closer to 18.2, but not there yet.

Next, try y=7.

35*7=245. 35+14=49. 245/49=5 exactly.

So, (5)^(2/3) = (5^(1/3))^2. 5^(1/3)≈1.710, squared≈2.924. Multiply by y=7: 2.924 *7=20.468. That's higher than 18.2.

So between y=6 and y=7.

At y=6: 16.335

At y=7:20.468

We need 18.2. So let's do linear interpolation.

The difference between y=6 and y=7 is 1, and between 16.335 and 20.468, the range is 4.133.

We need 18.2-16.335=1.865 above y=6.

So fraction=1.865 /4.133 ≈0.451.

So y ≈6 + 0.451*(1)=6.451. So approximately 6.45 ft.

But wait, let me try y=6.5.

Compute:

35*6.5=227.5. 35+2*6.5=35+13=48.

So 227.5/48≈4.7396.

4.7396^(2/3)= ?

Compute cube root: cube root of 4.7396 is approx 1.679 (since 1.68^3≈4.741). So 1.679^2≈2.82.

Multiply by y=6.5: 2.82*6.5≈18.33. That's very close to 18.2. So y≈6.5 ft.

But wait, 18.33 is a little higher than 18.2. Let me try y=6.4.

Compute:

35*6.4=224. 35+12.8=47.8. 224/47.8≈4.686.

Cube root of 4.686 is approx 1.67 (since 1.67^3=4.657). So 1.67^2≈2.7889.

Multiply by y=6.4: 2.7889 *6.4≈17.85. Close to 18.2. So 17.85 is a bit lower than 18.2.

So between y=6.4 (17.85) and y=6.5 (18.33). We need 18.2.

The difference between 17.85 and 18.33 is 0.48.

18.2 is 0.35 above 17.85.

So the fraction is 0.35 / 0.48 ≈0.729.

So y≈6.4 + (0.729 *0.1)≈6.4 +0.0729≈6.4729 ft.

So approximately 6.47 ft.

But wait, earlier when I tried y=6.5, I got 18.33, which is a bit higher than 18.2. So perhaps the depth is around 6.45 ft. Let me check y=6.45.

Compute:

35 *6.45= 35 *6 +35*0.45=210 +15.75=225.75.

35 + 2*6.45=35+12.9=47.9.

So 225.75 /47.9≈4.713.

Cube root of 4.713 is approx 1.675 (since 1.675^3 ≈4.70). So (1.675)^2≈2.806.

Multiply by y=6.45: 2.806 *6.45≈18.07. Close to 18.2. So y=6.45 gives 18.07, which is 0.13 less than 18.2.

The next step, perhaps y=6.475.

Compute 35*6.475=226.125.

Denominator:35 + 2*6.475=35+12.95=47.95.

So 226.125 /47.95≈4.715.

Cube root of 4.715≈1.676.

Square: 1.676^2≈2.809.

Multiply by y=6.475: 2.809 *6.475 ≈18.16. Close to 18.2.

So y≈6.475 ft.

So approximately 6.48 ft.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D:6 ft, option J:8 ft. Wait, wait, the options are A to J with values:

Options:

A:7 ft

B:3

C:3.5

D:6

E:9

F:2.5

G:10

H:4

I:5

J:8

Wait, the possible answers are 6, which is option D, and 7 which is A, and 8 is J.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the depth is about 6.48 ft, which is close to 6.5 ft. However, the options don't have 6.5; the closest is D:6, which is 6 ft, and A:7 ft.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the Chezy equation or another form. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for flow in a rectangular channel.

Another approach is to write the equation in terms of y and solve for it.

The equation is:

(1/n) * ( (35y) / (35 + 2y) )^(2/3) * sqrt(S) *35 y = Q

Plug in the numbers:

(1/0.017) * [ (35y)/(35+2y) ]^(2/3) * sqrt(0.008726) *35 y = 3500

I think I did that correctly earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation as:

y^(5/3) * (35)/(35 + 2y))^(2/3) = (n Q) / (35 sqrt(S)) )

Let me compute the right-hand side.

n=0.017, Q=3500.

n Q=0.017 *3500=59.5.

Denominator: 35 * sqrt(0.008726) =35 *0.0934≈3.269.

So right-hand side:59.5 /3.269≈18.2.

So,

y^(5/3) * [35/(35+2y)]^(2/3) =18.2

Hmm, same as before.

Another approach is to make it dimensionless. Let me define z=2y/35, so y= (35 z)/2.

Then,

35y =35*(35 z/2)= (35^2 z)/2.

35+2y=35 +35 z=35(1 +z).

So,

[35y/(35+2y)] = [ (35^2 z/2) ] / [35(1+z) ) ] = (35 z) / [ 2(1+z) ) ].

So,

[35y/(35+2y)] = (35 z) / [2(1+z)].

Then,

[35y/(35+2y)]^(2/3) = [ (35 z)/(2(1+z)) ]^(2/3).

y= (35 z)/2.

Putting it all into the equation:

y^(5
