Okay, so I have this question about phenylketonuria (PKU) and the risks it poses when a mother has it untreated. Hmm, I remember PKU is a genetic disorder, right? It's something to do with metabolism. Let me think.

So, PKU is caused by a defect in the enzyme that breaks down phenylalanine, an amino acid. If untreated, it can lead to intellectual disabilities and other health issues. But the question is about the risk to the child when the mother has untreated PKU.

Wait, I think this is about maternal PKU affecting the offspring, not necessarily passing on the gene. Because the question is about the child's risk of abnormality, not the risk of inheriting the condition.

Oh right! When a woman with untreated PKU becomes pregnant, the high levels of phenylalanine in her blood can affect the developing fetus. This is called maternal PKU. I remember reading that this can cause serious problems, like congenital heart defects, low birth weight, and intellectual disabilities in the child.

So what's the risk percentage? I think it's quite high if the mother's PKU isn't managed. I'm trying to recall the exact figure. I believe the risk is significantâ€”like, if the mother doesn't control her PKU through diet, the chance of the child having abnormalities is pretty high.

Wait, I thought the risk was something like about 90%? Or maybe it's even higher. Or was it that about 90% of children born to mothers with untreated PKU have some kind of issue. Or maybe it's that the offspring have a high chance of being affected.

Alternatively, another figure comes to mind. I think I've heard that without treatment, the risk is around 90% or higher. So looking at the options, J is 90%, and I is almost 100%. So which is it?

Wait, maybe it's not 100%, but close. Because some might have less severe issues, but still, the majority would be affected. So perhaps the answer is almost 100%? Or is it 90%?

Another thought: The exact risk might vary, but I think the classic teaching is that the risk is very high, like over 90%. Or perhaps the risk is that the child has a condition, but maybe not all 100% because some might be less affected.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is J: 90%, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, I think the risk is approximately 90% of having some kind of abnormality, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle. PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder. So if the mother has PKU, she must have two defective alleles, meaning she's homozygous recessive (like pp). If the father is normal (assuming he's not a carrier), his genotype is PP. So all their children would be Pp, meaning carriers, but not affected themselves. Wait, but that's about the genetic transmission of PKU, not about the effects of maternal PKU on the child.

Ah, right, so the question isn't about whether the child has PKU, but about the risk of abnormalities due to the mother's high phenylalanine levels. So the child might not have PKU (since they get one normal allele from the father, assuming he's not affected), but they can have other issues because of the mother's condition during pregnancy.

So, in that case, the risk is high because the mother's metabolites affect the fetus. I think the risk is up to 90% or more for some kind of issue if untreated.

So looking back at the options, J is 90% and I is almost 100%. Which one is correct? I think I remember that the risk is about a 90% chance of having some kind of problem, but not necessarily all of them severe. So the answer might be J:90%.

Alternatively, perhaps it's almost 100% because the exposure is so toxic. Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think the correct figure is approximately 90%, so J. But I'm not 100% sure.

The question concerns the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the enzyme that breaks down phenylalanine, an amino acid. If left untreated, high levels of phenylalanine in the blood can lead to intellectual disabilities and other health issues. However, the question specifically focuses on the risk to the child due to maternal PKU, not the inheritance of the condition itself.

Maternal PKU refers to the effects of high phenylalanine levels in the mother's blood on the developing fetus. This can result in congenital heart defects, low birth weight, and intellectual disabilities in the child. The risk of such abnormalities is very high if the mother's PKU is untreated. While the exact percentage may vary, the classic teaching is that the risk is approximately 90%. This is because the toxic effects of high phenylalanine levels during pregnancy are significant, though not necessarily 100% in all cases.

Given the options provided, the most accurate answer is J: 90%.
