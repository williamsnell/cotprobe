Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychology, specifically regarding Horner's motive to avoid success. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that Horner did some work related to women's motivations, particularly in the context of success. I think she proposed that some women fear success because of societal pressures or expectations. 

The question asks about the definition of the motive and how she studied it. The options are A to D. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says it's a motive to avoid success in occupational and intellectual areas to ensure success in emotional and relational areas. That sounds familiar. I think Horner suggested that women might avoid success in certain fields because they believe it might hinder their relationships or emotional lives, which were traditionally more valued for them.

Option B suggests women are naturally less ambitious. I don't think that's what Horner said. Her theory was more about fear of success leading to negative consequences, not about natural differences in ambition.

Option C states that success leads to negative results. That's a bit vague, but I think Horner's idea was more specific, linking the avoidance to potential relational issues rather than just any negative outcome.

Option D is about believing success is unattainable. That doesn't quite fit either. It's more about the fear of succeeding and the consequences that follow, not whether success is possible.

So, putting it together, Horner's motive is about avoiding success in certain areas to maintain success in others, particularly emotional or relational ones. The method she used was probably some kind of study or experiment. Wait, didn't she use a projective technique where she asked participants to write stories about a successful individual? That way, she could tap into their unconscious fears.

But the question is more about the definition than the method. Oh wait, the first part of the question is about the definition. So the correct answer should define the motive as avoiding success in occupational/intellectual to ensure emotional/relational success.

Looking back, option A matches that definition. The other options don't fit as well. So the answer should be A.

The motive to avoid success, as defined by Horner, involves avoiding success in occupational and intellectual pursuits to ensure success in emotional and relational areas. This concept suggests that women may avoid excelling in certain fields due to fears that such success could negatively impact their personal relationships or emotional well-being, which were traditionally prioritized. Among the options provided, option A accurately captures this definition. 

Answer: A
