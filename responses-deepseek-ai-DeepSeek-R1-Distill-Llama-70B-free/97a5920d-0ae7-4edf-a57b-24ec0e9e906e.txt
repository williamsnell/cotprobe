Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Darnell buying and selling stocks, and I need to figure out his loss per share and the total loss. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when you buy stocks, if you later sell them for a lower price, you incur a loss. The loss per share would be the difference between the purchase price and the selling price. Then, the total loss is just the loss per share multiplied by the number of shares he bought.

So, Mr. Darnell bought 20 shares at $182.50 each. Then, two months later, he sold each share for $168.75. Wait, so the selling price is lower than the buying price, which means he lost money on each share.

Let me calculate the loss per share first. That should be the buying price minus the selling price. So, $182.50 minus $168.75. Hmm, let me do that math. 182.50 - 168.75. Let's see, 182 minus 168 is 14, but wait, the cents part is .50 minus .75. Oh, right, that's a bit tricky. So, .50 minus .75 would be negative, which means I might have to adjust. Maybe it's better to subtract them directly. 182.50 - 168.75 equals 13.75? Wait, let me check that again. 

Wait no, 182.50 minus 168.75: from 168.75 to 170 is 1.25, then from 170 to 182.50 is 12.50, so total is 13.75. So yes, the loss per share is $13.75.

Now, the total loss would be this per share loss multiplied by the number of shares, which is 20. So 13.75 times 20. Let me calculate that. 13 times 20 is 260, and 0.75 times 20 is 15, so 260 plus 15 is $275. So the total loss is $275.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches $13.75 per share and $275 total. Let me scan through the options:

Option J says $13.75 per share and total loss $275. That matches exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be option J.

The loss per share is calculated as the difference between the purchase price and the selling price:  
$182.50 - $168.75 = $13.75 per share.  

The total loss is the loss per share multiplied by the number of shares:  
$13.75 Ã— 20 = $275.00.  

The correct answer is **J: $13.75 per share, total loss $275.00**.
