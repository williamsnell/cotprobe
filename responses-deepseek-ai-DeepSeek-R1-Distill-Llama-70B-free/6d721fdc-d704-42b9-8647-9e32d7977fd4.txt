Okay, so I've got this question about Erich Fromm's ideas, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about Fromm. He was a social psychologist and philosopher, right? I remember he wrote a lot about human nature, society, and how people interact with each other and their environment.

The question is about how society prevents people from realizing their true nature to be loving, creative, and productive. Fromm talks about different character orientations, I think. These orientations are ways people relate to the world, especially in terms of how they handle things like material possessions, relationships, and work.

I recall that Fromm identified several types of characters, like the receptive, hoarding, exploitative, marketing, productive, authoritarian, and destructive. Each of these represents a different way people interact with the world. The key here is understanding which of these allows a person to realize their true nature as loving, creative, and productive.

So, the question is asking which response to societal demands allows someone to achieve that true nature. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Authoritative. Hmm, authoritative sounds like it's about control or dominance. Fromm probably didn't think that's positive. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: Productive. Wait, the productive orientation is about being productive in a healthy way, contributing to society and themselves. This sounds like it aligns with being loving and creative. So B could be a candidate.

Option C: Destructive. That's clearly negative, so C isn't the right choice.

Option D: Exploitative. Exploitative implies taking advantage of others, which doesn't sound like it leads to positive traits, so D is out.

Option E: Manipulative. Manipulating others isn't about being loving or creative, so E is wrong.

Option F: Marketing. Marketing orientation is about self-commodification, like seeing oneself as a product. That doesn't foster creativity or love, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Hoarding. Hoarding is about accumulating things and being possessive, which is the opposite of productive and loving, so G is wrong.

Option H: Submissive. Being submissive might mean following without questioning, but that doesn't necessarily lead to being creative or productive in a positive sense. So H is not the answer.

Option I: Controlling. Controlling others is more about power than love or creativity. So I is out.

Option J: Receptive. Receptive orientation is about being open to receiving, like being open to experiences, love, and ideas. This sounds like it would support creativity and productivity. So J could be a possibility.

Wait, but earlier I thought B was a candidate. Let me think again. The productive orientation in Fromm's theory is about creating and contributing, which is exactly what the question is pointing towards. The receptive orientation is more about being open to receive, which supports productivity but isn't the same as being productive itself.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be B: The productive allows a person to realize their true nature. Because Fromm's idea is that being productive in a healthy, life-affirming way allows people to express their true selves as loving, creative, and productive.
