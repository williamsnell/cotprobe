Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because equilibrium problems can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution containing the complex ion Ag(NH3)2^+. Let's read the details carefully.

So, the solution has 0.30 M NH4^+ and 0.15 M of the complex ion. The goal is to find the pH when the concentration of Ag^+ is 1.0e-6 M. The given data includes K_disso for Ag(NH3)2^+ as 6.0e-8, K_b for NH3 as 1.8e-5, and K_w is 1e-14.

Hmm, first, I remember that K_disso is the dissociation constant for the complex. So the complex Ag(NH3)2^+ dissociates into Ag^+ and NH3. The dissociation equation would be:

Ag(NH3)2^+ ⇌ Ag^+ + 2NH3

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Because the complex is Ag(NH3)2^+, so when it dissociates, it releases two NH3 molecules and one Ag^+ ion. So the correct equation is:

Ag(NH3)2^+ → Ag^+ + 2 NH3

The K_disso would be [Ag+][NH3]^2 / [Ag(NH3)2^+].

But the problem is, we're given the concentration of the complex ion as 0.15 M. Wait, is that the concentration before or after dissociation? Oh, right, in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.15 M. But wait, no, the problem says the solution contains 0.15 M of the actual complex ion. So I think that's the actual concentration in the solution, meaning that's [Ag(NH3)2^+] = 0.15 M.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the solution contains 0.30 M NH4^+ and 0.15 M of the complex ion. Oh wait, no, the wording is: "contains 0.30 M of NH4^+ and 0.15 M of the actual ^+ complex ion." So the complex is Ag(NH3)2^+ and its concentration is 0.15 M.

So, in solution, [Ag(NH3)2^+] is 0.15 M, and [NH4^+] is 0.30 M.

Wait, but NH4^+ comes from the dissociation of NH3, right? Or wait, maybe it's from another source. Because if NH3 is acting as a base, it can accept a proton to form NH4^+.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the solution's pH and how it affects the concentration of NH3 and NH4^+. Because the K_b of NH3 is given, which is 1.8e-5. So that relates to the base dissociation:

NH3 + H2O ⇌ NH4^+ + OH^-

The K_b is [NH4^+][OH^-] / [NH3] = 1.8e-5.

But in the solution, the [NH4^+] is given as 0.30 M. So that must come from the dissociation of NH3 in solution. Hmm, but the presence of NH4^+ suggests that the solution is somewhat acidic, because NH3 is a weak base. Wait, but the solution contains both NH4^+ and NH3, so it's a buffer solution perhaps.

Wait, but the presence of NH4^+ and NH3 can be used to calculate the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch is for buffers, so maybe that's the way to go here.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH4^+ is from another source. Wait, but in the complex, Ag(NH3)2^+ is present, which means NH3 is a ligand. When the complex dissociates, it releases NH3 into solution. So the NH3 in solution comes from both the complex dissociation and any other sources.

Wait, but the problem states that the solution contains 0.30 M NH4^+ and 0.15 M of the complex ion. So the NH4^+ is part of the solution, perhaps from the dissociation of NH3. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the complex ion's dissociation first. The K_disso is given as 6.0e-8. The dissociation equation as I wrote before is:

Ag(NH3)2^+ ⇌ Ag^+ + 2 NH3

So the expression is K_disso = [Ag+][NH3]^2 / [Ag(NH3)2^+] = 6.0e-8.

We are given that [Ag+] is 1.0e-6 M, and [Ag(NH3)2^+] is 0.15 M. So I can plug these into the equation to find [NH3].

So rearranging the K_disso equation:

[NH3]^2 = (K_disso * [Ag(NH3)2^+]) / [Ag+]

Plugging in the numbers:

[NH3]^2 = (6.0e-8 * 0.15) / (1.0e-6)

Let me compute that:

6e-8 * 0.15 = 9e-9.

Then, 9e-9 / 1e-6 = 9e-3.

So [NH3]^2 = 0.009 → [NH3] = sqrt(0.009) ≈ 0.094868 M.

Wait, but let me compute sqrt(0.009) accurately. 0.009 is 9e-3, sqrt(9e-3) is 3e-1.5? No, sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(1e-3) is 1e-1.5, which is about 0.0316. So 3 * 0.0316 ≈ 0.094868 M. So [NH3] ≈ 0.094868 M.

So the concentration of NH3 in solution is approximately 0.0949 M.

Now, knowing that, and the concentration of NH4^+ is 0.30 M, I can find the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the NH3/NH4^+ buffer.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

Where the base is NH3 and the acid is NH4^+.

But wait, the pKa here is for the conjugate acid of NH3, which is NH4^+. So the relevant Ka is for NH4^+.

Since K_b for NH3 is 1.8e-5, the K_a for NH4^+ is K_w / K_b = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.5556e-10.

So pKa = log(1/(5.5556e-10)) → wait, pKa is -log(Ka).

So Ka = 5.5556e-10 → pKa = -log(5.5556e-10) ≈ 9.2553.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 5.5556e-10 → log(5.5556e-10) = log(5.5556) + log(1e-10). log(5.5556) is about 0.745. So log(5.5556e-10) ≈ -9.255. So pKa is 9.255.

So now, using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]) = 9.255 + log([NH3]/[NH4^+])

We have [NH3] ≈ 0.0949 M, [NH4^+] = 0.30 M.

So [base]/[acid] = 0.0949 / 0.30 ≈ 0.3163.

log(0.3163) is approximately... Well, log(0.3) is about -0.5229, and 0.3163 is a bit higher, so maybe around -0.50.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's do it step by step.

log(0.3163) = log(3.163e-1) = log(3.163) + (-1)log(10^1) → log(3.163) ≈ 0.5 (since 10^0.5 ≈ 3.162), so log(3.163) ≈ 0.5. So log(3.163e-1) = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5.

So approximately, pH ≈ 9.255 + (-0.5) = 8.755.

Wait, but wait, I approximated log(0.3163) as -0.5, but let's get a more precise value.

Let me think: 10^(-0.5) is about 0.3162, which is very close to our value of 0.3163. So log(0.3163) ≈ -0.5 exactly.

So pH ≈ 9.255 - 0.5 = 8.755.

Looking at the options, let's see: the options are A:7.45, B:10.50, C:6.90, D:8.76, E:7.00, F:7.80, G:10.00, H:8.20, I:9.20, J:9.50.

So 8.755 is very close to option D:8.76. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, K_disso: yes, I used [Ag+] and [Ag(NH3)2^+] correctly. Then, I calculated [NH3] as sqrt[(6e-8 * 0.15)/(1e-6)] → which is sqrt(9e-9 / 1e-6) → wait, no. Wait, 6e-8 * 0.15 is 9e-9, and 9e-9 divided by 1e-6 is 0.009. So [NH3]^2 = 0.009 → [NH3] = 0.094868, correct.

Then, for NH3 and NH4^+ concentrations, using Henderson-Hasselbalch, correct. Calculated pKa as about 9.255, correct. Then ratio of [NH3]/[NH4^+] is 0.0949/0.30 ≈ 0.3163, which is 10^(-0.5), so log is -0.5, giving pH ≈ 8.755, which is 8.76 when rounded, matching option D.

So I think I did it right. So the answer should be option D:8.76.

To determine the pH of the solution, we start by analyzing the dissociation of the complex ion Ag(NH₃)₂⁺. The dissociation equation is:

\[
\text{Ag(NH₃)₂⁺ ⇌ Ag⁺ + 2NH₃}
\]

The dissociation constant is given as:

\[
K_{\text{disso}} = \frac{[\text{Ag⁺}][\text{NH₃}]^2}{[\text{Ag(NH₃)₂⁺}]}
\]

We are provided with the following values:
- \([\text{Ag⁺}] = 1.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{Ag(NH₃)₂⁺}] = 0.15 \, \text{M}\),
- \(K_{\text{disso}} = 6.0 \times 10^{-8}\).

Rearranging the equation to solve for \([\text{NH₃}]^2\):

\[
[\text{NH₃}]^2 = \frac{K_{\text{disso}} \cdot [\text{Ag(NH₃)₂⁺}]}{[\text{Ag⁺}]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
[\text{NH₃}]^2 = \frac{(6.0 \times 10^{-8})(0.15)}{1.0 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{9.0 \times 10^{-9}}{1.0 \times 10^{-6}} = 9.0 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
[\text{NH₃}] = \sqrt{9.0 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 0.0949 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution. The solution contains a buffer system of NH₃ (base) and NH₄⁺ (acid). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right)
\]

Here:
- \([\text{base}] = [\text{NH₃}] = 0.0949 \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{acid}] = [\text{NH₄⁺}] = 0.30 \, \text{M}\),
- \(K_b\) for NH₃ is given as \(1.8 \times 10^{-5}\), so \(K_a = \frac{K_w}{K_b} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-10}\).

The pKa is:

\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(K_a) = -\log(5.56 \times 10^{-10}) \approx 9.255.
\]

Now substitute into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = 9.255 + \log \left( \frac{0.0949}{0.30} \right)
\]

Calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{0.0949}{0.30} \approx 0.3163.
\]

The logarithm of 0.3163 is approximately \(-0.5\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 9.255 - 0.5 = 8.755.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is approximately \(8.76\), which corresponds to option D.
