Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the recoil energy of an atom after emitting a gamma ray. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a nucleus emits a gamma ray, it must recoil to conserve momentum. But wait, how does that translate into energy? Let me think this through.

First, the problem states that the atom has a mass of 10. Wait, mass of 10 what? Oh right, probably atomic mass units (u), since that's common in such problems. And the gamma ray has an energy of 2 MeV. I need to find the recoil energy of the atom.

I recall that energy and momentum are related. The gamma ray, being a photon, has energy E and momentum p, and since it's massless, E = pc. So the momentum of the photon is E/c. But wait, the units here are a bit tricky. Let me make sure I get them right.

The atom will recoil in the opposite direction to conserve momentum. So the momentum of the atom (p_atom) must equal the momentum of the photon (p_photon). So p_atom = E_photon / c.

But the kinetic energy (KE) of the atom, which is the recoil energy, is given by (p_atom)^2 / (2m_atom). Because for non-relativistic speeds, KE = p²/(2m).

Wait, let me write down the equations:

E_photon = 2 MeV = 2e6 eV.

The momentum of the photon, p_photon = E_photon / c.

Momentum of atom, p_atom = p_photon = E_photon / c.

Kinetic energy of atom, KE = (p_atom)^2 / (2 m_atom).

But wait, the mass m_atom is given as 10 u. I need to convert that into kilograms or maybe use it in eV units with some constants.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So 10 u is 1.66e-26 kg.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula with the mass in terms of energy using E=mc². Let's see, perhaps it's easier to work in units where c is incorporated.

Wait, another approach: The recoil energy can be calculated using the formula:

KE = (E_photon)^2 / (2 m_atom c²)

Wait, because KE = p²/(2m) and p is E_photon/c. So substituting, p² = (E_photon)^2 / c². So KE = (E_photon)^2 / (2 m c² * c²?) Wait, no, let me clarify.

Wait, KE = (p^2) / (2m). Since p = E/c, p^2 = E²/c². So KE = E² / (2 m c²). Yes, that makes sense.

So KE = (E_photon)^2 / (2 m c²)

But wait, the units need to be consistent. Let me plug in the numbers properly.

E_photon is 2 MeV. m is 10 u. Let me convert everything into SI units or maybe use a conversion factor I know.

I remember that 1 eV = 1.6e-19 joules, so 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 2 MeV is 2e6 eV = 2e6 * 1.6e-19 J = 3.2e-13 J.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of energy units. Alternatively, perhaps there's a shortcut formula when using atomic mass units and MeV.

Wait, another thought: The rest mass energy of 1 u is about 931.5 MeV. So m c² for 10 u is 10 * 931.5 MeV = 9315 MeV.

Wait, that's a lot. So m c² is 9315 MeV for the atom.

So let me write the formula again:

KE = (E_photon)^2 / (2 m c²)

Plugging in the values:

KE = (2 MeV)^2 / (2 * 9315 MeV) )

Wait, because m c² is 10 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 9315 MeV.

So KE = (4 MeV²) / (2 * 9315 MeV) ) = (4)/(2 * 9315) MeV

Wait, simplifying:

4 / (18630) MeV = let's compute that.

4 divided by 18630 is approximately 0.0002147 MeV.

But wait, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 0.0002147 MeV is 0.0002147e6 eV = 214.7 eV.

Looking at the options, I see option D is 214 eV, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

E_photon = 2 MeV.

m c² = 10 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 9315 MeV.

So KE = (2)^2 / (2 * 9315) ) MeV.

That's 4 / (18630) = 0.0002147 MeV = 214.7 eV.

Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be D: 214 eV.

To calculate the recoil energy of an atom of mass 10 u after the emission of a 2 MeV gamma ray, we use the formula for recoil energy:

\[
KE = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}^2}{2 m c^2}
\]

Here:
- \(E_{\text{photon}} = 2 \, \text{MeV}\),
- \(m = 10 \, \text{u}\),
- \(c^2\) is the speed of light squared, and the rest mass energy of 1 u is approximately \(931.5 \, \text{MeV}\).

First, calculate \(m c^2\) for the atom:
\[
m c^2 = 10 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 9315 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Now substitute into the formula:
\[
KE = \frac{(2 \, \text{MeV})^2}{2 \times 9315 \, \text{MeV}} = \frac{4}{18630} \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
KE = 0.0002147 \, \text{MeV} = 214.7 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the recoil energy is approximately **214 eV**, which corresponds to option **D**.
