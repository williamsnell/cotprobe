Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, there are these four friends who started a business remodeling and selling old cars. They rented a barn for $600 for the summer. They buy each car from a dealer for $250, and then spend an average of $410 on materials to remodel each car. They sell each car for $1,440 and want to make a gross profit of $7,000. The question is, how many cars do they need to sell to reach that profit?

Hmm, first, I think I should understand what's their total cost and how much profit they make per car. Then, I can figure out how many cars they need to sell to reach the $7,000 gross profit.

So, the costs they have are the barn rental, which is a fixed cost of $600. Then, for each car, they have variable costs: the cost to buy the car ($250) and the materials ($410). So for each car, the variable cost per unit is 250 + 410, right?

Let me calculate that. 250 plus 410 is 660. So each car costs them $660 in variable costs. But wait, the barn rental is a fixed cost, so that's a one-time expense regardless of how many cars they sell. So the total cost for them would be fixed costs plus variable costs multiplied by the number of cars.

But wait, when calculating profit, I think gross profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So, their total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs.

The selling price per car is $1,440. So the revenue per car is $1,440, and their variable cost per car is $660, so the contribution margin per car is 1440 - 660. Let me calculate that: 1440 minus 660 is 780. So each car gives them a profit of $780 towards covering their fixed costs and generating overall profit.

But wait, no, actually, to find the gross profit, we subtract the cost of goods sold (COGS) from revenue. COGS includes variable costs (like materials and the cost of the cars) but not fixed costs like the barn rental. Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Gross profit is typically revenue minus cost of goods sold. COGS usually includes direct costs like materials and labor, but in this case, the barn rental is more of an operating expense, not directly tied to each car. Hmm, maybe I should treat the barn rental as a fixed cost, and each car's cost includes the $250 and $410. So for each car, the COGS is $660, right?

So the gross profit per car would be selling price minus COGS per car, which is 1440 - 660 = $780 per car. But wait, the barn rental is a fixed cost, so when calculating total gross profit, we subtract all COGS from total revenue. Then, fixed costs like the barn rental would be part of operating expenses, which are subtracted after gross profit to get operating income. But the question here is about gross profit, so maybe the fixed costs aren't considered in the gross profit calculation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The formula for gross profit is:

Gross Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

COGS typically includes direct costs: materials, labor, and cost of purchasing the cars (since each car is bought for $250). So in this case, COGS per car is $250 + $410 = $660. The barn rental is a fixed overhead, so it's not part of COGS. So when calculating gross profit, we subtract only COGS from revenue.

So, for each car, the gross profit per unit is $1,440 - $660 = $780.

Now, the total gross profit needed is $7,000. But wait, is that before or after considering the fixed costs? Hmm, the question says "obtain a gross profit of $7,000." So I think that refers to the total gross profit, which is after subtracting all COGS but before subtracting fixed costs. Or wait, perhaps in this context, the $7,000 is their target for (gross profit) after considering all costs, including the barn rental. Because sometimes people might refer to net profit, but the question specifically says "gross profit." So I need to get that straight.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is:

Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS

COGS includes only direct costs. So if their total gross profit needs to be $7,000, that means:

Total Revenue - COGS = $7,000

But COGS is variable, depending on how many cars they sell. So let's denote the number of cars as x.

Total Revenue is 1440 * x.

COGS is 660 * x.

So, Gross Profit = (1440x) - (660x) = 780x.

Wait, but that would mean 780x = 7,000.

Solving for x: x = 7000 / 780 ≈ 8.97.

But 8.97 is approximately 9 cars. But wait, the options don't have 9 as the correct answer. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option H is 9. But wait, maybe I'm missing the fixed costs.

Wait, no. Because in the calculation above, the barn rental of $600 isn't considered in COGS. So the $780 per car is the gross profit per car, but the fixed costs would reduce the overall profit beyond gross profit. But the question is about gross profit, not net profit. So perhaps the fixed costs aren't subtracted here.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let's clarify: the Gross Profit is the money left after covering the direct costs (COGS) but before paying for fixed costs. So in that case, the formula would be:

Gross Profit = (Selling Price - COGS per unit) * Number of units - Fixed Costs.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because fixed costs are operating expenses, which are subtracted after gross profit to get operating income.

So, the formula should be:

Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS

And COGS is (250 + 410) * x = 660x

Total Revenue is 1440x

So, Gross Profit = 1440x - 660x = 780x

But the question says they want a gross profit of $7,000. So 780x = 7000

x = 7000 / 780 ≈ 8.97, so about 9 cars.

But looking at the options, option H is 9. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait a second, perhaps the initial fixed cost of $600 is a one-time expense that should be considered when calculating the total profit, but since the question is about gross profit, maybe that cost isn't included in the calculation. So if we're only considering COGS, then yes, 9 cars would give a gross profit of 780*9=7020, which is slightly over $7,000. But wait, 9*780 is 7020, which is $20 more than needed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to include the fixed cost in the total cost, but that would be more like net profit, not gross profit.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let's read it again.

They paid $600 to rent the barn. They buy each car for $250, and spend $410 on materials. So each car's cost is 250 + 410 = 660. They sell each at 1440.

They want a gross profit of 7000.

So, as per the definition, gross profit is revenue minus COGS. COGS here is 660x. So, Gross Profit = 1440x - 660x = 780x.

Set that equal to 7000: 780x =7000 → x=7000/780 ≈8.97. So x=9, because you can't sell a fraction of a car. So 9 cars would give a gross profit of 7020, which is just over 7000. So the answer would be 9, which is option H.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the fixed cost of the barn isn't being considered in the gross profit. So perhaps the question is actually asking about net profit, but it's stated as gross profit. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all costs, including the barn, in the total costs, so the calculation would be different.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about it differently. Let's calculate the total cost, which includes both fixed and variable costs.

Total Cost = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs

Fixed Costs are $600.

Variable Costs per car: 250 + 410 = 660.

Total Variable Costs = 660 * x.

So, Total Cost = 600 + 660x.

Total Revenue = 1440x.

Profit (which could be gross or net) is Total Revenue - Total Cost.

But the terminology here is important. If the question is about gross profit, it's Revenue minus COGS (which is variable costs), so 1440x - 660x = 780x. So 780x =7000 → x≈9.

But if the question is about net profit (which is after all costs, including fixed), then:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = 1440x - (600 + 660x) = (1440x -660x) -600 = 780x -600.

Set that equal to 7000: 780x -600 =7000 →780x=7600 →x=7600/780≈9.74. So x≈10.

Wait, but the question says "gross profit of $7,000". So I think the correct approach is that gross profit is 780x=7000 →x≈9.

But let me check the options again. Option H is 9, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, 9 cars give a gross profit of 7020, which is more than 7000. So perhaps they need to sell 9 cars.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake by assuming COGS is 660 per car. Let's double-check.

Each car is bought for 250, and materials are 410, so yes, COGS per car is 660.

So revenue per car is 1440.

Gross profit per car is 1440-660=780.

Total gross profit needed is 7000.

So, number of cars x is 7000 /780 ≈8.97, so 9 cars.

So the answer is H:9.

To determine how many automobiles the students must sell to achieve a gross profit of $7,000, we analyze the costs and revenue structure:

1. **Fixed Costs**: The students paid $600 to rent the barn for the summer. This is a one-time expense and does not depend on the number of cars sold.

2. **Variable Costs per Car**: 
   - Cost to purchase each car: $250
   - Cost of materials: $410
   - Total variable cost per car: $250 + $410 = $660

3. **Revenue per Car**: Each car is sold for $1,440.

4. **Gross Profit per Car**: 
   - Gross profit per car is calculated as revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS). 
   - COGS per car = $660.
   - Gross profit per car = $1,440 - $660 = $780.

5. **Total Gross Profit**: The students aim for a total gross profit of $7,000. Since gross profit is calculated as total revenue minus COGS, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total Gross Profit} = (\text{Gross Profit per Car}) \times (\text{Number of Cars})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   7,000 = 780 \times x
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{7,000}{780} \approx 8.97
   \]
   Since the number of cars must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, \(x = 9\).

6. **Verification**: Selling 9 cars generates a gross profit of:
   \[
   9 \times 780 = 7,020
   \]
   This is slightly more than $7,000, which satisfies the requirement.

Thus, the students must sell **9 cars** to achieve a gross profit of $7,000.
