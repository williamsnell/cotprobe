Okay, so I've got this physics question here about free fall with air resistance. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct description of the motion. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, so the question says the object is in free fall, experiencing a drag force proportional to its speed. And it hits the ground before reaching terminal velocity. Oh right, terminal velocity is when the drag force equals the gravitational force, so the acceleration becomes zero. But in this case, the object doesn't reach that point.

So first, I remember that in free fall without air resistance, the object would accelerate downward at g (about 9.8 m/sÂ²), resulting in increasing speed. But with air resistance, it's different. The drag force opposes the motion, so it reduces the net force.

The drag force is proportional to speed, which makes this a bit more complex. Let's model the forces. The gravitational force is mg, acting downward. The drag force is upward and equals some constant k times velocity, so F_drag = kv.

So the net force is mg - kv. According to Newton's second law, F_net = ma. So ma = mg - kv. Let's rearrange that: a = g - (k/m)v.

Wait, but acceleration a is the time derivative of velocity. So as the object falls, the velocity increases, which makes the drag force increase. But since the drag is subtracted from mg, the net force decreases as velocity increases.

At first, when the object starts falling, velocity is zero, so drag is zero. The acceleration is g. As it speeds up, the drag (kv) increases, making the net force mg - kv smaller. So the acceleration decreases over time.

Since the object hasn't reached terminal velocity yet (because it hits the ground first), the acceleration is always positive but decreasing. Because the acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, a positive acceleration means the velocity is increasing. So the object is speeding up, but the rate at which it's speeding up is slowing down.

So putting that together: the object's speed increases, but the acceleration decreases. So the correct description must be that the object is falling with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.

Looking back at the options, option E says "increasing speed and decreasing acceleration." That sounds right.

Wait, let me check the other options to be sure. Option J says increasing speed and constant acceleration. No, because as drag increases, acceleration decreases. So J is wrong.

Option E matches what I concluded. So the answer should be E.

The motion of a real object in free fall, experiencing a drag force proportional to its speed, can be analyzed by considering the forces acting on it. The gravitational force, \( F_g = mg \), acts downward, while the drag force, \( F_{\text{drag}} = kv \), acts upward and opposes the motion. The net force is given by \( F_{\text{net}} = mg - kv \), and from Newton's second law, the acceleration is \( a = g - \frac{k}{m}v \).

Initially, when the object starts falling, the velocity \( v \) is zero, so the drag force is zero, and the acceleration is \( g \). As the object falls and \( v \) increases, the drag force \( kv \) increases, reducing the net force and causing the acceleration to decrease. Since the object strikes the ground before reaching terminal velocity, the acceleration remains positive but decreases over time.

This means the object's speed increases throughout the fall, but the rate of increase of speed (acceleration) decreases. Therefore, the correct description of the motion is that the object falls with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.

Option E correctly describes this motion.
