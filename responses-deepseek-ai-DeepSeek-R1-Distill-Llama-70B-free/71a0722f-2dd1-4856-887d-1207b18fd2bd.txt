Okay, so I've got this question here about banking reserves. Hmm, I remember that banks have something called required reserves and excess reserves. Let me try to think through this.

So the question says the bank has $250,000 in deposits and $10,000 in excess reserves. The required reserve ratio is 20%. They're asking for the bank's actual reserves.

Wait, right. I think the required reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that the bank must hold as reserves. So required reserves would be 20% of the deposits. Let me calculate that first.

Deposits are $250,000. So 20% of that is 0.20 * 250,000. Let me do the math: 250,000 times 0.2 is 50,000. So the required reserves are $50,000.

But wait, the bank also has excess reserves. Excess reserves are the extra amount the bank holds beyond what's required. So if the required is $50k and the excess is $10k, then the total actual reserves must be the sum of required and excess.

So adding those together: $50,000 (required) + $10,000 (excess) = $60,000. So the actual reserves are $60,000.

Let me double-check. The formula for reserves is: Actual Reserves = Required Reserves + Excess Reserves. That makes sense. So yes, required is 20% of deposits, which is 50k, plus 10k excess gives 60k total.

Looking at the options, option H is $60,000. So the answer should be H.

The bank's actual reserves are calculated by adding the required reserves and the excess reserves. Required reserves are 20% of deposits, which is $50,000. Adding the $10,000 in excess reserves gives total actual reserves of $60,000.

Answer: H
