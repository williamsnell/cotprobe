Okay, so I've got this question here about graph theory, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking for the maximum number of edges in a simple triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that planar graphs have certain properties based on Euler's formula. Oh wait, Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2, right? Where V is vertices, E edges, F faces. But how does that help me here?

I think there's a theorem related to planar graphs and the maximum number of edges they can have without containing a triangle. Oh right, Turán's theorem! Wait, Turán's theorem gives the maximum number of edges in a graph that doesn't contain complete subgraphs of a certain size. But wait, Turán's theorem applies to all graphs, whether planar or not. So maybe I should consider both Turán's theorem and planar graph constraints.

Turán's theorem for triangle-free graphs (which are K₃-free) says that the maximum number of edges is achieved by the complete bipartite graph with partitions as equal as possible. So for n vertices, the maximum edges would be floor(n²/4). Let me calculate that for n=30.

30 squared is 900, divided by 4 is 225. So the Turán graph gives 225 edges, but wait, that's for any graph. But planar graphs have a stricter limit. So the answer is probably less than 225, but which option is correct?

Wait, the question is about planar graphs. Planar graphs can't have too many edges without being non-planar. I remember that for a planar graph without any triangles, there's a specific formula. Oh right, it's related to Euler's formula and the maximum edges in a planar graph.

The general formula for planar graphs is E ≤ 3V - 6. So for V=30, that's 3*30 -6 = 90-6=84 edges. But that's for any planar graph, including those with triangles. But the question specifies triangle-free. So maybe the maximum is lower.

In a triangle-free planar graph, there's a stricter limit. I think the formula is E ≤ 2V - 4 for triangle-free planar graphs. Oh wait, where did I get that from? Let me think. For planar graphs, each face must be at least a triangle (3 edges) if the graph is maximally planar. But without triangles, each face must have at least 4 edges, right? So using that, the formula changes.

So using Euler's formula V - E + F = 2. And for planar graphs, each face is bounded by at least k edges. For triangle-free, k=4. Because each face must have at least 4 edges if there are no triangles.

In planar graphs, there's a relationship between edges and faces. Each edge is shared by two faces, so 2E ≥ kF, where k is the minimum number of edges per face. So for triangle-free, 2E ≥ 4F → F ≤ (2E)/4 = E/2.

Now plug into Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2. Substituting F ≤ E/2:

V - E + (E/2) ≥ 2 → V - (E/2) ≥ 2 → E ≤ 2(V - 2).

So E ≤ 2V - 4. For V=30, that gives 2*30-4=56 edges.

Wait, but earlier I thought the Turán graph gives 225 edges, but that's not planar. So the maximum for planar is 56? But wait, the options have 56 as option H.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check. So for triangle-free planar graphs, E ≤ 2V -4. So 30*2=60-4=56. So yeah, that's the maximum.

But wait, I've heard that for bipartite planar graphs, it's E ≤ 2V -4, and bipartite graphs are triangle-free. So that makes sense.

So the maximum is 56 edges. Looking at the options, option H is 56. So the answer should be H.

To determine the maximum number of edges in a simple triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices, we analyze the constraints imposed by planarity and the absence of triangles.

1. **Planar Graphs and Euler's Formula**: For any planar graph, Euler's formula \( V - E + F = 2 \) holds, where \( V \) is the number of vertices, \( E \) is the number of edges, and \( F \) is the number of faces. Additionally, for planar graphs, the inequality \( E \leq 3V - 6 \) applies. For \( V = 30 \), this gives \( E \leq 3(30) - 6 = 84 \). However, this is the general limit for planar graphs, including those with triangles.

2. **Triangle-Free Planar Graphs**: For triangle-free planar graphs, the constraint is stricter. In such graphs, each face must be bounded by at least 4 edges (since triangles are not allowed). Using the relationship \( 2E \geq 4F \) (each edge is shared by two faces), we find \( F \leq \frac{E}{2} \). Substituting this into Euler's formula gives \( V - E + \frac{E}{2} \geq 2 \), which simplifies to \( E \leq 2V - 4 \).

3. **Calculation for \( V = 30 \)**: Substituting \( V = 30 \) into \( E \leq 2V - 4 \), we get \( E \leq 2(30) - 4 = 56 \). This is the maximum number of edges for a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices.

4. **Verification with Options**: Among the given options, the value 56 corresponds to option H. Therefore, the correct answer is **H: 56**.
