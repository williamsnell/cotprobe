Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 50 eV. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength relates the momentum of a particle to its wavelength. The formula, I think, is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum.

Wait, but wait. Electrons have kinetic energy here, so I probably need to find their momentum based on that. I remember that the kinetic energy (KE) is related to momentum. Oh right, for non-relativistic speeds, KE equals (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So I can solve for p from that.

Wait, but what's the mass of an electron? I think it's about 9.11 x 10^-31 kilograms. And Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. Oh, but wait, sometimes it's easier to use eV units because the kinetic energy is given in eV.

Oh right! There's a version of the de Broglie wavelength formula that uses electron volts. Let me think. I think the formula when KE is in eV is lambda = h / sqrt(2m KE). But wait, I'm a bit confused about the units here. Because KE is in eV, but h is in J·s. So maybe I should convert the kinetic energy from eV to joules.

Yes, because 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 50 eV would be 50 times that, which is 8.01 x 10^-18 J.

So the formula is lambda = h / sqrt(2m KE). Let's plug in the numbers. h is 6.626e-34, m is 9.11e-31 kg. KE is 8.01e-18 J.

Wait wait, let me compute the denominator first. sqrt(2 * m * KE). 2 times m is 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30. Multiply by KE (8.01e-18) gives 1.822e-30 * 8.01e-18 = let's calculate that. 1.822 * 8.01 is approximately, let's see, 1.8 *8 is 14.4, 0.022 *8 is 0.176, so around 14.576. Then the exponents: 1e-30 * 1e-18 = 1e-48, so 14.576e-48? Wait, no, because 1.822e-30 * 8.01e-18 is (1.822 * 8.01) multiplied by 1e-30+(-18) = 1e-48. So 1.822 *8.01 is about 14.58, so 14.58e-48, which is 1.458e-47 kg²·m²/s²? Wait, because units of KE are J which is kg·m²/s², so 2mKE is in kg·m²/s², so the sqrt would be kg·m/s, which is the unit of momentum. Makes sense.

So sqrt(2mKE) is sqrt(1.458e-47) kg·m/s. Let's calculate the square root. The square root of 1.458 is approximately 1.207, and the square root of 1e-47 is 1e-23.5, which is 1e-23.5 equals 3.16e-24 approximately. So sqrt gives 1.207 * 3.16e-24 kg m/s. Wait, 1.207 *3 is 3.621, 1.207 *0.16 is about 0.193. So total around 3.814e-24 kg m/s.

Wait, wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. 1.458e-47 is 1.458 x 10^-47. So square root is sqrt(1.458) * 1e^(-47/2) = 1.207 * 1e-23.5. 1e-23.5 is 3.162e-24, so 1.207 * 3.162e-24 is approximately (1.2 *3.16) = 3.79e-24 kg m/s.

So the denominator is approx 3.79e-24 kg m/s.

Now the numerator is h, which is 6.626e-34 J s. So lambda is 6.626e-34 / 3.79e-24. Let's compute that. 6.626 /3.79 is approximately 1.748. The exponents are 1e-34 divided by 1e-24 = 1e-10. So 1.748e-10 meters. That's 1.748 angstroms, since 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m.

Wait, but the question asks for nanometers. Oh right, because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 1.748e-10 m is 0.1748 nm. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 0.17, option A is 0.27. So 0.17 is option G.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check because sometimes factors can creep in. Oh, wait, when using the formula lambda = h / sqrt(2m KE), but wait, is that correct? Because the kinetic energy formula is KE = (p²)/(2m), so solving for p gives p = sqrt(2m KE). So yes, lambda is h/(p) = h/(sqrt(2m KE)).

Another approach is to use a shortcut formula when KE is in eV. I recall that the de Broglie wavelength (in nm) can be approximated as lambda = 1.226 / sqrt(KE_eV) angstroms. Wait, because 1 angstrom is 0.1 nm, so that would convert it.

Wait, let me think. If lambda in angstroms is 1.226 / sqrt(KE), then in nm it's 0.1226 / sqrt(KE). Because 1 angstrom is 0.1 nm.

So for KE =50 eV, sqrt(50) is approximately 7.07. So lambda = 1.226 /7.07 ≈ 0.173 angstroms, which is 0.173 * 0.1 nm = 0.0173 nm. Wait, that can't be right because that would be 0.0173 nm, which is 0.017 nm, but the options don't have that.

Wait wait, no, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. I think the formula is lambda (in nm) equals 1.226 divided by sqrt(KE in eV). Wait, 1.226 divided by sqrt(50) would give 1.226/7.07≈0.173 nm. Oh wait no, wait, no, wait. Let me check the formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is lambda (in angstroms) = 12.26 / sqrt(KE in eV). Because 1.226 is in angstroms, but wait, 1.226 is in angstroms? No, wait, 12.26 divided by sqrt(KE) gives the wavelength in angstroms, so in nm that's 1.226 nm / sqrt(KE).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of units. Let me consider Planck's constant in eV s and other constants.

Alternatively, let me use the initial method but with more precise calculation.

So, h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value from 2019 redefinition). Mass of electron m = 9.1093837015e-31 kg. KE is 50 eV, which is 50 * 1.602176634e-19 J = 8.01088317e-18 J.

So, p = sqrt(2 m KE). Let's compute that step by step.

Compute 2mKE: 2 * 9.1093837015e-31 kg * 8.01088317e-18 J.

2 *9.10938e-31 = 1.8218767e-30.

Multiply by 8.01088e-18: 1.8218767e-30 *8.01088e-18 = ?

1.8218767e-30 *8.01088e-18 = (1.8218767 *8.01088) * 1e-48.

Calculate 1.8218767 *8.01088:

1.8 *8 =14.4.

1.8*0.01088=0.019584.

0.0218767 *8=0.175014.

0.0218767 *0.01088≈0.000238.

Adding up: 14.4 +0.019584=14.419584; +0.175014=14.594598; +0.000238≈14.594836.

So approximately 14.5948e-48, which is 1.45948e-47 kg²·m²/s².

Now, take the square root to find p: sqrt(1.45948e-47) = sqrt(1.45948) *1e-23.5.

sqrt(1.45948) ≈ 1.2083.

1e-23.5 is 1e-23 * 1e-0.5 = 1e-23 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-24.

So p ≈1.2083 *3.1623e-24 kg·m/s.

Multiply 1.2083 *3.1623: approx 3.821e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, lambda = h / p = 6.62607015e-34 /3.821e-24 m.

Compute 6.62607e-34 /3.821e-24 = (6.62607 /3.821) *1e-10.

6.62607 /3.821 ≈ let's see, 3.821 *1.73 ≈ 6.613 (since 3.821 *1.7=6.4947; 3.821*0.03=0.11463; total 6.6093). So 1.73 gives about 6.609, which is close to 6.62607, so it's approximately 1.731.

So lambda ≈1.731e-10 meters. 1e-10 m is 0.1 nm, so 1.731e-10 m is 0.1731 nm. So approximately 0.173 nm. Looking at the options, option G is 0.17, which is close to this value.

Wait, but wait. The calculation I did with the formula lambda = 1.226 / sqrt(KE) in nm: for KE=50 eV, sqrt(50)=7.071. So 1.226 /7.071≈0.1734 nm. That's the same result as before, so that confirms it.

So the correct answer should be approximately 0.173 nm, which is option G:0.17.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 50 eV, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2m \cdot KE}}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the electron),
- \( KE = 50 \, \text{eV} = 50 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} = 8.01 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \sqrt{2m \cdot KE} \)
\[
2m \cdot KE = 2 \cdot 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-18} = 1.459 \times 10^{-47} \, \text{kg}^2 \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]
\[
\sqrt{2m \cdot KE} = \sqrt{1.459 \times 10^{-47}} = 1.208 \times 10^{-23.5} = 3.821 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \lambda \)
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2m \cdot KE}} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{3.821 \times 10^{-24}} = 1.731 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 0.1731 \, \text{nm}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The calculated wavelength is approximately \( 0.173 \, \text{nm} \), which is closest to option **G: 0.17**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: 0.17**
