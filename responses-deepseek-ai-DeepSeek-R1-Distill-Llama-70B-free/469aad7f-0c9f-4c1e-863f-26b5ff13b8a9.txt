Alright, so I've got this question about options pricing, specifically relating to put-call parity. Hmm, I remember that put-call parity is a formula that relates the price of a call option to the price of a put option with the same strike and expiration. Let me think about the formula.

Okay, the put-call parity equation is C - P = S - K*e^(-rT), where C is the call price, P is the put price, S is the spot price, K is the strike, r is the risk-free rate, and T is time to maturity in years. Wait, or is it S = K*e^(-rT) + C - P? No, I think I mixed it up. Let me get this right. Oh right, the correct formula is C - P = S - PV of the strike. So the present value of the strike is K multiplied by e^(-rT). 

In this problem, the call option is European, so the put-call parity should hold if the markets are efficient and no arbitrage opportunities exist. The question gives me the call price, the strike, the spot price, the risk-free rate, and the time to expiration. So I can plug these into the formula to find the put price.

Let me jot down the given values:

- Call price (C) = $5
- Strike (K) = $50
- Spot price (S) = $52
- Risk-free rate (r) = 2% or 0.02
- Time to maturity (T) = 1 month. Oh, wait, that's 1/12 of a year, so T = 1/12.

Now, applying the put-call parity formula. Let's rearrange it to solve for P. The formula is:

P = C - (S - K*e^(-rT))

Wait, no. Let me think again. Put-call parity is C - P = S - K*e^(-rT). So rearranging for P, that would be P = C - (S - K*e^(-rT)).

Wait, no, more accurately, from C - P = S - PV(K), so P = C - (S - PV(K)).

Alternatively, it's easier to compute the right-hand side first. Let me compute PV(K), which is the present value of the strike price.

PV(K) = K * e^(-rT). Plugging the numbers in: K is 50, r is 0.02, T is 1/12.

So, e^(-0.02*(1/12)). Let me compute that exponent. 0.02 divided by 12 is approximately 0.001666667. So the exponent is -0.001666667.

Now, e^(-0.001666667) is approximately 0.99834. Because e^(-x) ≈ 1 - x for small x, but more accurately, let's compute it. Using a calculator, e^(-0.001666667) ≈ 0.998338.

So PV(K) = 50 * 0.998338 ≈ 49.9167.

Now, S is 52. So S - PV(K) = 52 - 49.9167 = 2.0833.

Wait, but according to the put-call parity, C - P should equal S - PV(K). So 5 - P = 2.0833. Solving for P: P = 5 - 2.0833 = 2.9167.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.92, which is approximately what I got. So the put premium should be around $2.92.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the present value factor.

Let me recompute PV(K). K is 50. The exponent is -r*T = -0.02*(1/12) ≈ -0.001666667. e^(-0.001666667) can be calculated more accurately. Let me compute it using a calculator:

e^(-0.001666667) is approximately 1 - 0.001666667 + (0.001666667^2)/2 - ... but maybe it's better to use a calculator approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for continuous compounding.

Wait, 0.02 is the annual rate, right? So for one month, it's 0.02/12 = 0.001666667. So the exact value would be e^(-0.001666667). Let me compute this using a calculator.

Using a calculator, e^(-0.001666667) ≈ 0.998338. So yes, that part is correct. So PV(K) = 50 * 0.998338 ≈ 49.9167.

So S - PV(K) = 52 - 49.9167 = 2.0833. Then, C - P = 2.0833. Since C is 5, 5 - P = 2.0833 → P = 5 - 2.0833 = 2.9167, which is approximately 2.92. So the put premium is about $2.92, which corresponds to option A.

To determine the price of the put premium, we use the put-call parity formula:

\[
C - P = S - K \cdot e^{-rT}
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = Call price = $5
- \( P \) = Put price (to be calculated)
- \( S \) = Spot price = $52
- \( K \) = Strike price = $50
- \( r \) = Risk-free rate = 2% = 0.02
- \( T \) = Time to maturity = 1 month = \( \frac{1}{12} \) years

### Step 1: Calculate the present value of the strike price (\( K \cdot e^{-rT} \))
The present value factor is:

\[
e^{-rT} = e^{-0.02 \cdot \frac{1}{12}} = e^{-0.001666667}
\]

Using a calculator:

\[
e^{-0.001666667} \approx 0.998338
\]

Thus:

\[
K \cdot e^{-rT} = 50 \cdot 0.998338 \approx 49.9167
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( S - K \cdot e^{-rT} \)
\[
S - K \cdot e^{-rT} = 52 - 49.9167 = 2.0833
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( P \) using the put-call parity formula
Rearranging the formula:

\[
P = C - (S - K \cdot e^{-rT})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P = 5 - 2.0833 = 2.9167
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated put premium is approximately $2.92, which corresponds to option **A**.
