Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: "You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia." Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: "You are abundant," so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: "You are poor and impotent," so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind."
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931

Okay, so I've got this history question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is referring to a speech by Joseph Stalin from 1931. In the speech, he talks about how Russia has been beaten throughout history because of its backwardness. He mentions being beaten by various groups like the Mongols, Turks, Swedes, Poles, Lithuanians, British, French, and Japanese. The key point is that Russia was beaten because it was backward in military, cultural, industrial, etc., aspects. He says that the exploiters beat the weak and backward, following the jungle law of capitalism. So, the main idea is that to avoid being beaten, Russia must not fall behind anymore.

The question is asking which later Soviet foreign policy decision is most directly supported by the reference to these "continual beatings." The options are from A to J.

I need to think about each option and see which one aligns with the idea of avoiding being beaten by staying strong and not lagging behind.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Declaration of war against Japan at the end of WWII. That's when the Soviet Union joined the Allies against Japan. This was more about ending the war and gaining territory, not directly about avoiding being beaten because of backwardness.

Option B: Blockade of Berlin. That was during the Cold War, part of the Berlin Crisis. The Soviets blockaded Berlin to prevent the Western powers from having a presence, but I'm not sure how this ties into the speech about backwardness.

Option C: Support for the Cuban Revolution. Cuba was a communist revolution, and the Soviets supported it, but this seems more about spreading communism than about avoiding being beaten.

Option D: Decision to build the Berlin Wall. This was to stop East Germans from fleeing to the West, more about controlling their own people rather than avoiding external beating.

Option E: Imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine. That was about intervening in socialist countries to prevent them from becoming non-communist. It's about maintaining influence, but I'm not sure how it ties directly to Stalin's speech.

Option F: Signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. That's the non-aggression treaty with Nazi Germany before WWII. This was a strategic move to prevent being attacked, but I'm not sure if it's directly about avoiding backwardness.

Option G: Launch of Sputnik. Sputnik was the first satellite, part of the space race. This was definitely about not being behind technologically. It fits the idea because if you're advanced, you're not beaten. So this could be a candidate.

Option H: Diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic of China. This is about establishing relations with China, but it's more about geopolitical alliances than avoiding being beaten.

Option I: Invasion of Afghanistan. That was in 1979, and it was about propping up a communist government. It's a military action, but does it relate to avoiding backwardness? Maybe, but not as directly as some other options.

Option J: Creation of the Warsaw Pact. This was a military alliance in response to NATO. It's about military strength and unity among socialist states. This could be about not being beaten because you're part of a strong alliance.

Now, thinking back to Stalin's speech. He's emphasizing that Russia was beaten because it was backward, so the solution is to not lag behind. So the policy most directly supported would be one that focuses on not being backward and ensuring strength.

Looking at the options, G is about technological advancement (Sputnik), which is about not being backward. J is about military alliance, which is about collective strength to avoid being beaten.

Wait, but the speech is from 1931, and the options are about later foreign policies. Sputnik was in 1957, so that's after Stalin's time but during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was formed in 1955. So both are post-Stalin but part of the Soviet approach.

But the question is about which decision is supported by the "continual beatings" reference. So, which policy was about ensuring the Soviet Union wasn't weak or backward.

The Warsaw Pact was a collective defense alliance to counter NATO. It was about military strength and preventing being beaten by the West. That fits with the idea of not being backward and avoiding being beaten.

Alternatively, Sputnik was about technological advancement, which directly relates to not being backward. But Sputnik was more about showcasing technological prowess rather than a foreign policy decision per se. It's a technological achievement, which is a form of policy but more about internal development.

Hmm, but the question is about foreign policy. So building the Warsaw Pact is a foreign policy decision to strengthen alliances and military, preventing being beaten. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a foreign policy move to avoid war, but it's more about strategic alliance with an enemy.

Alternatively, the Brezhnev Doctrine was about keeping socialist states in line, which is a foreign policy to maintain influence and prevent others from moving away, which could be seen as avoiding being beaten by external forces.

Wait, but the Brezhnev Doctrine was about intervening in socialist countries, so it's about maintaining dominance. Not exactly about avoiding being beaten because of backwardness.

I think the best fit is the Warsaw Pact because it's about military strength and alliances to prevent being beaten by stronger powers. Alternatively, Sputnik is about technological advancement, which is part of not being backward.

But Sputnik is more of a technological milestone, not a foreign policy decision. The question is about foreign policy decisions. So perhaps the answer is J: Creation of the Warsaw Pact.

Wait, but the speech is about not being backward, so Sputnik is about technological advancement, which is a form of not being backward. But Sputnik is a space program, so it's more of a domestic policy achievement. The foreign policy aspect would be how it affected the Cold War, projecting power.

Alternatively, the creation of the Warsaw Pact is a direct foreign policy decision to strengthen the Soviet bloc's military position to prevent being beaten.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between G and J. But considering that the speech is about not falling behind, which led to the Soviet emphasis on industrialization and military strength. The Warsaw Pact is a military alliance, which is about collective defense to prevent being beaten.

Wait, but the question is about which decision is supported by the "continual beatings" reference. So perhaps the answer is J: the creation of the Warsaw Pact. Because it's about forming a military alliance to prevent being beaten by stronger capitalist nations.

Alternatively, the launch of Sputnik is about technological advancement to avoid being backward. So both could fit, but which one is more directly a foreign policy decision.

Wait, the question says "foreign policy." Sputnik is more of a technological achievement, but it's also a foreign policy tool as it showcased Soviet strength. But the question is about a decision in foreign policy.

The creation of the Warsaw Pact is a foreign policy decision. So I think the answer is J.

But wait, another thought: the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a non-aggression treaty with Nazi Germany, which was a strategic move to avoid being attacked. But that's more about immediate strategic needs rather than the long-term avoidance of backwardness.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The speech emphasizes not being backward, so decisions that ensure the Soviet Union is strong enough to not be beaten. Warsaw Pact is about collective strength, which fits. So the answer is J.

The question refers to a speech by Joseph Stalin in 1931, where he emphasizes that Russia was historically beaten because of its backwardness and asserts that avoiding such outcomes requires staying strong and not falling behind. The task is to identify which later Soviet foreign policy decision is most directly supported by this reference to "continual beatings."

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Declaration of war against Japan at the end of WWII was about ending the war and gaining territory, not directly tied to avoiding backwardness.
- **Option B**: Blockade of Berlin was part of the Cold War and more about preventing Western influence in Berlin.
- **Option C**: Support for the Cuban Revolution was about spreading communism, not directly related to avoiding backwardness.
- **Option D**: Building the Berlin Wall was about controlling East Germans, not external threats.
- **Option E**: Brezhnev Doctrine was about maintaining influence in socialist countries, not directly about avoiding backwardness.
- **Option F**: Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a strategic move to avoid war with Nazi Germany, not specifically about backwardness.
- **Option G**: Launch of Sputnik was a technological achievement showcasing Soviet advancement, but it is more of a domestic policy milestone.
- **Option H**: Diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic of China was about geopolitical alliances.
- **Option I**: Invasion of Afghanistan was about propping up a communist government, not directly tied to backwardness.
- **Option J**: Creation of the Warsaw Pact was a military alliance to counter NATO, emphasizing collective strength to avoid being beaten.

The speech highlights the need to avoid being beaten by staying strong and not lagging behind. While Sputnik represents technological advancement, it is more of a domestic achievement. The Warsaw Pact, on the other hand, is a foreign policy decision focused on military strength and collective defense, directly aligning with the idea of avoiding being beaten due to backwardness.

Answer: J
