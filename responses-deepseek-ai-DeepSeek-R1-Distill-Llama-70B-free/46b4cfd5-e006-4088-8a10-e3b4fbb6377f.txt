Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding offers and acceptances. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about Calvin Poultry Co. offering to sell Chickenshop 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound under specified delivery terms. Chickenshop then accepts but adds something about "city scale weight certificate." So the issue is whether this acceptance is valid or if it changes the terms, making it a counteroffer.

I remember that for a contract to form, the acceptance must be unconditional. If the offeree introduces new terms or changes existing ones, it's not a valid acceptance; instead, it's a counteroffer. So the key here is whether Chickenshop's addition of the "city scale weight certificate" is a new term or a condition.

In the original offer, Calvin specified delivery terms, but I don't know if those terms included how the weight would be measured. If the delivery terms didn't mention the scale, then Chickenshop adding that could be seen as adding a new term. Alternatively, if it's just specifying a method of measurement that was already part of the delivery terms, it might not change anything.

But wait, the offer was for 20,000 pounds at 40 cents per pound. The delivery terms are specified, but the weight measurement method isn't mentioned. So when Chickenshop adds that they accept based on the city scale weight certificate, they're introducing a term about how the weight will be determined. This could be a condition that wasn't in the original offer.

Under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies to the sale of goods like chickens, the rules are a bit more relaxed. The UCC allows for some leeway where additional terms don't necessarily terminate the offer; they might just be proposals. But for the acceptance to be effective, it has to be unequivocal.

If Chickenshop's acceptance adds a new term, then under the UCC §2-207, it could be considered an additional term. But if it's a material term, like the method of weighing, which could affect the price or quantity, then it might be a counteroffer. Alternatively, if it's just a minor detail, it might become part of the contract as an additional term without ending the original offer.

Wait, but in this case, the original offer was for a specific quantity (20,000 pounds) at a specific price (40 cents per pound). The delivery terms would typically include how the quantity is measured. If Calvin's offer didn't specify the method of measurement, then Chickenshop's addition could be seen as adding a condition. Since it's about how the weight is determined, it's a key term. So by adding it, Chickenshop is modifying the offer.

So under common law, any addition would make it a counteroffer, and no contract is formed unless the offeror accepts the new terms. But under UCC, the rules are a bit different. The UCC allows for additional terms in the acceptance, but if they're material, they don't become part of the contract unless the offeror agrees. However, the mere addition might not terminate the offer; it just proposes new terms.

Wait, but in this scenario, the question is about whether a contract was formed. If Chickenshop's reply is a counteroffer, then the original offer is rejected, and there's no contract. But if it's an acceptance with an additional term, then under UCC, a contract might still form based on the original terms, with the additional term being a proposal. But the original offer's terms would govern unless the offeror accepts the new terms.

So, the options are:

A: Counteroffer, no contract.
B: Contract formed, terms need clarification.
C: Rejection, no contract.
E: Conditional acceptance, not counteroffer.
G: Contract formed on Chickenshop's terms.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The original offer was specific on quantity and price, but perhaps silent on how the weight is measured. The acceptance adds a condition about the scale. So is that a new term? If it's a term that goes to the essence of the contract—like the method of determining the quantity delivered—then it's a material term.

Under UCC 2-207, an order or acceptance that adds terms becomes part of the contract unless the offeror objects. But wait, 2-207 says that additional terms in a contract between merchants become part of the contract unless they are objected to. But if the additional term is a condition that materially alters the offer, it might be considered a counteroffer.

Alternatively, if the original offer didn't specify, and the acceptance adds a term that's necessary, maybe it's seen as filling in a gap rather than altering the offer. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question doesn't specify whether the original offer included a measurement method. If it didn't, then Chickenshop's addition might be an additional term. But whether that's a counteroffer or an acceptance with additional terms depends on the context.

But from the answer options, looking at option A says it's a counteroffer. Option G says a contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms. Option B says contract formed but terms need clarification.

Alternatively, under the "mirror image" rule of common law, the acceptance must mirror the offer exactly. Any deviation makes it a counteroffer. But since this is a sale of goods, UCC applies, which is more flexible.

So under UCC, the additional term would be treated as a proposal. If it's a material term, the offeror (Calvin) would have to accept it for it to become part of the contract. But without Calvin's acceptance, the contract would be formed on the original terms, and the additional term would not be part of it unless Calvin agrees.

Wait, but in this case, the additional term is in the acceptance. So the question is whether the contract is formed when Chickenshop sends the acceptance. Under UCC, the contract would be formed upon acceptance, but the additional terms would not necessarily be part of it unless agreed upon.

But wait, no. The UCC says that when both parties are merchants, additional terms become part of the contract unless they are objected to. So in this case, if Calvin is a merchant (since they're in the poultry business), and Chickenshop is also a merchant (buying chickens), then the additional term about the city scale certificate would be part of the contract unless Calvin specifically objects.

But the problem is that the original offer didn't include that term. So when Chickenshop adds it in their acceptance, under UCC 2-207, it's considered an additional term. Since both are merchants, the term is automatically included unless Calvin objects.

But the question is whether a contract was formed. So the answer would be that a contract was formed, but the terms might include the additional one unless Calvin objects. Looking at the options:

Option G says a contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms. But that's not accurate because the additional term is proposed, but whether it's part of the contract depends on Calvin's response.

Alternatively, the contract is formed when Chickenshop accepts, and the additional term is part of the contract unless Calvin objects. So the contract exists, but with the new term.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Option B: A contract was formed, but the terms need to be clarified. That might make sense because the additional term could be a point of contention.

Option G: Contract formed on Chickenshop's terms. Maybe that's the case if the additional term is accepted as part of the contract.

Wait, but under UCC 2-207, the additional terms become part of the contract unless the offeror (Calvin) objects. So if Calvin doesn't object, the term is included. But since Calvin hasn't responded yet, the contract is formed with the additional term. So the contract exists on Chickenshop's terms because the additional term is included.

So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The original offer was to sell at 40 cents per pound, 20,000 pounds, under specified delivery terms. The delivery terms may or may not have included the method of weighing. If they didn't, then Chickenshop's addition is an extra term. Under UCC, when the offeree (Chickenshop) is a merchant and sends an acceptance with additional terms, those terms become part of the contract unless the offeror (Calvin) objects. Since both are merchants, and the additional term is part of the acceptance, the contract is formed with the additional term included. So yes, the contract is formed on Chickenshop's terms, option G.

Alternatively, maybe the additional term is a condition that must be met for the acceptance to be valid. If the original offer didn't specify, the method of weighing could affect the contract. So by adding this, Chickenshop is making a conditional acceptance, which under common law would be a counteroffer. But under UCC, it's treated differently.

Wait, but in this case, perhaps the original offer didn't specify the method of weighing, so Chickenshop's acceptance adds that as a condition. If the method of weighing is a material term, then under UCC, adding it would be an additional term, and the contract is formed with that term unless Calvin objects.

But the question is whether the contract was formed. So the answer would be that a contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms, which is option G.

So I think the correct answer is G.
</think>

The question revolves around contract formation under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically whether Chickenshop's acceptance of Calvin Poultry Co.'s offer constitutes a valid acceptance or a counteroffer. Calvin offered to sell 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound under specified delivery terms. Chickenshop accepted but added a condition: "per city scale weight certificate." The issue is whether this addition modifies the original offer.

Under the UCC, when both parties are merchants, additional terms in an acceptance are generally included in the contract unless the offeror objects. Here, Chickenshop's addition of the "city scale weight certificate" could be seen as an additional term regarding the method of weight measurement, which was not specified in Calvin's original offer. Since both parties are likely merchants, this term would automatically become part of the contract unless Calvin objects.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Chickenshop's reply is not a counteroffer because, under UCC §2-207, additional terms in an acceptance do not automatically terminate the offer.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While terms may need clarification, the contract is still formed with the additional term included unless Calvin objects.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Chickenshop's reply is not a rejection; it is an acceptance with an additional term.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The reply is not merely a conditional acceptance; it adds a specific term.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The contract is legally binding under the UCC.
- **Option G**: Correct. The contract is formed on Chickenshop's terms because the additional term is included unless Calvin objects.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. There is no breach of contract at this stage.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The terms are not negotiable; they are either part of the contract or objected to by Calvin.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: A contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms.

Answer: G
