Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about calculating the volume of O2 needed to burn 50 liters of CO completely and also finding the volume of CO2 formed. The balanced equation given is 2CO + O2 → 2CO2. Hmm, I remember stoichiometry is involved here.

Wait, right, stoichiometry involves mole ratios. Oh, right, the balanced equation shows the ratio of the reactants and products. So for every 2 moles of CO, 1 mole of O2 is needed, and that produces 2 moles of CO2. 

But wait, the question is about volumes. Oh, right, I think at the same temperature and pressure, the volume of gases is directly proportional to moles. So I can use volume ratios instead of mole ratios. That should make it easier.

So the reaction is 2CO : 1O2 → 2CO2. So for every 2 liters of CO, I need 1 liter of O2, and I get 2 liters of CO2. 

Wait, the problem says I have 50 liters of CO. Let me figure out the O2 needed. Since 2 liters of CO require 1 liter of O2, then 50 liters would need (1/2)*50 = 25 liters of O2. Oh, wait, because 2 CO uses 1 O2, so 50 CO would require 25 O2. That makes sense.

Now, the CO2 produced. For 2 liters of CO, we get 2 liters of CO2. So the ratio is 1:1 for CO to CO2. So 50 liters of CO would produce 50 liters of CO2. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The balanced equation says 2 CO → 2 CO2, so it's a 1:1 ratio. So yes, 50 liters of CO gives 50 liters of CO2.

So the O2 needed is 25 liters and CO2 is 50 liters. Let me look at the options. Option J says O2 is 25 and CO2 is 50. Option E is O2 12.5 and CO2 50, which doesn't fit because I calculated O2 as 25. Option J seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check. 2 moles CO to 1 mole O2. So 50 liters CO is 50/2 = 25 moles of O2 needed. And 50 liters CO gives 50 liters CO2. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be option J.

To determine the volume of O₂ required to burn 50 liters of CO completely and the volume of CO₂ formed, we use the balanced chemical equation:

\[
2CO + O_2 \rightarrow 2CO_2
\]

From the equation, the following relationships can be derived:
1. **For every 2 liters of CO, 1 liter of O₂ is required.**  
   Since 50 liters of CO are available, the volume of O₂ needed is:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \, \text{liters}.
   \]

2. **For every 2 liters of CO, 2 liters of CO₂ are produced.**  
   This means the ratio of CO to CO₂ is 1:1. Therefore, 50 liters of CO will produce:  
   \[
   50 \, \text{liters of CO}_2.
   \]

Now, comparing these results with the given options:
- Option J states that the volume of O₂ is 25 liters and the volume of CO₂ is 50 liters, which matches the calculations.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: O₂ volume is 25 liters and CO₂ volume is 50 liters.**

Answer: J
