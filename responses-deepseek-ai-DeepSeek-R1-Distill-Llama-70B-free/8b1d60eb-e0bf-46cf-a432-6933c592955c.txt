Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating property taxes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says Mr. Williams owns a property assessed at $7,800 in a city with a tax rate of $2.80 per $100. I need to find out how much he pays in property taxes. Hmm, I remember that property taxes are usually calculated by applying the tax rate to the assessed value.

Wait, the tax rate is $2.80 per $100. So for every $100 of the property's value, he pays $2.80 in taxes. So the formula must be something like (assessed value / 100) multiplied by the tax rate.

Let me write that down. So the assessed value is $7,800. Divided by 100 gives me 78. Then multiply that by the tax rate, which is 2.80. So 78 times 2.80... Let me calculate that.

Wait, 78 times 2 is 156, and 78 times 0.80 is... let's see, 78 * 0.8 is 62.4. So adding those together, 156 + 62.4 equals 218.4. So the tax should be $218.40.

Looking at the options, option A is $218.40. But wait, let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I mix up decimals.

Another way to think about it: 2.80 per 100 is the same as 0.028 in decimal. So 7,800 * 0.028. Let's compute that. Hmm, 7,800 times 0.02 is 156, and 7,800 times 0.008 is 62.4. Adding them gives 156 + 62.4 = 218.4. Okay, same result.

So I think the correct answer is A: $218.40.

To calculate Mr. Williams' property taxes, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Property Taxes} = \left(\frac{\text{Assessed Value}}{100}\right) \times \text{Tax Rate}
\]

Given:
- Assessed Value = $7,800
- Tax Rate = $2.80 per $100

First, divide the assessed value by 100:

\[
\frac{7,800}{100} = 78
\]

Next, multiply by the tax rate:

\[
78 \times 2.80 = 218.40
\]

Thus, Mr. Williams pays $218.40 in property taxes. The correct answer is:

A: $218.40
