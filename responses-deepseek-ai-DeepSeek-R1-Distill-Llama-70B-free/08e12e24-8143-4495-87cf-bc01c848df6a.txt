Question:

Carol Collector was a serious antique car buyer, and was always searching for Thunderbirds in good shape. She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address "to view a picture of the car," which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was "used and sold as is." When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for

Options:

A: Carol, because the seller was not negligent in providing a picture of the car.
B: Carol, because the "as is" disclosure was not totally effective.
C: The seller, unless they can prove Carol had knowledge that the car was a 1968 model.
D: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.
E: The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold "as is."
F: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.
G: The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.
H: The seller, if Carol can prove she relied on the picture when making her purchase.
I: Carol, because the seller provided a picture of the car, regardless of its condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about Carol Collector and the Thunderbird car she bought. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the situation: Carol saw an ad for a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe priced at $25,000. The ad had a website with a picture showing a T-Bird in great shape. She paid and signed a contract saying the car was "used and sold as is." But when she went to pick it up, it was a 1968 model, which isn't rare and is worth less. She's suing the seller.

The question is about the likely outcome of her lawsuit. The options are A through J, but I'll focus on the given choices.

I remember that in contract law, when a seller misrepresents something about a product, it can be grounds for rescission or damages. The key here is whether the seller made a false representation that Carol relied on.

The contract says "sold as is," which usually means the buyer takes the risk, but that's unless there's fraud or misrepresentation. So, if the seller lied about the car's model year, that's a problem.

The ad specifically stated it was a 1964 model, and the website had a picture of a car that looked like a '64. But the actual car was a '68. So the seller misrepresented the car's year, which is a material fact because it affects the value.

Now, the "as is" clause might not protect the seller if they made a false representation. Because "as is" typically covers the condition, not the identity or fundamental characteristics of the item. So selling a different model year is a breach, even under "as is."

Looking at the options:

Option D says the seller loses because the car was misrepresented in the ad. That makes sense because the ad was false about the model year.

Option B suggests the "as is" disclosure wasn't effective. I'm not sure if that's the main point, but it could be relevant if the court finds that the seller's misrepresentation outweighs the "as is" clause.

Option F says Carol wins unless the '68 is equal in value. But the '68 is worth less, so that might not apply, but the question is about misrepresentation, not equal value.

Option H says the seller loses if Carol relied on the picture. But the picture was of a '64, which the seller didn't deliver. So reliance is a factor, but the main issue is the false ad.

So the strongest case is that the seller misrepresented the car's model year, making the sale fraudulent. Therefore, the likely outcome is that Carol will win, and the seller is liable.

The correct answer is based on the misrepresentation of the car's model year in the advertisement. The seller advertised a 1964 Thunderbird but provided a 1968 model, which is a material difference affecting the car's value. The "as is" clause does not protect the seller in cases of fraud or misrepresentation. 

Answer: D
