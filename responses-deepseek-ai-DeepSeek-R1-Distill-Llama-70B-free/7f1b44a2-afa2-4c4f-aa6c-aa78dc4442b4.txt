Okay, so I have this question about employment selection tests and gender differences. Let me try to break it down. The question says that female applicants consistently get lower scores on a selection test compared to males. But when they're hired, the females perform just as well as the males on the job. I need to figure out what this situation illustrates from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in employment law and psychology, there are terms related to discrimination and test validity. Let me think about each option.

Option A is reverse discrimination. That usually refers to when policies intended to help minorities might unfairly disadvantage majority groups, but I don't think that's the case here. The question isn't about policies favoring one group over another.

Option B is disparate treatment. That's when individuals are treated differently based on a protected characteristic, like race or gender. So maybe if the test is applied differently to men and women, but here the test is the same for everyone, so it might not be this.

Option C is differential selection. I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe it refers to different selection rates for different groups, but I'm not certain if that's the right term here.

Option D is differential validity. I think validity refers to how well a test predicts job performance. If the test isn't equally valid for both genders, meaning it's a good predictor for one but not the other, that could be differential validity. But in this case, the test is less predictive for females since they score lower but perform equally. So maybe that's what D is about.

Option E is adverse impact. Adverse impact is when a seemingly neutral employment practice has a disproportionately negative effect on a protected group. Like, if a test is used and fewer minorities or women are selected because of it, even if the test wasn't intended to be biased. So if women are scoring lower, leading to fewer being hired, that could be adverse impact. But the question says that when hired, they perform as well. So the test might be causing an adverse impact because it's keeping out qualified women who would do just as well.

Option F is unfairness. While the situation seems unfair, the term is too vague. The question is asking for a specific concept, so maybe not F.

Option G is glass ceiling effect. That refers to invisible barriers that prevent women from advancing into higher-level positions. Not directly related to selection tests, so probably not G.

Option H is gender bias. That's a broad term, but it's more general. The question is about a specific scenario with test scores and job performance, so maybe a more specific term applies.

Option I is sexual harassment. Definitely not related to the scenario.

Option J is constructive dismissal. That's about an employee feeling forced to resign due to unbearable working conditions. Not relevant here.

So narrowing down the options, it's between D, E, and maybe others. Let me think again.

The selection test has lower scores for women, but when hired, their job performance is equal. This suggests that the test might not be a valid predictor for women, meaning it's not accurately reflecting their ability to perform the job. So differential validity could be the issue because the test is valid for men but not for women. Alternatively, it's causing an adverse impact because it's screening out women who are just as capable but score lower on the test.

Wait, differential validity would mean that the test's validity differs across groups. So if the test predicts job performance well for men but not for women, then it's differential validity. But in this case, the test isn't predicting as well for women since they perform as well as men despite lower test scores. So that's a validity issue, but is it differential validity?

Alternatively, adverse impact is about the effect of the test on hiring rates, regardless of the test's validity. So even if the test is valid for men, if it's causing fewer women to be hired, that's adverse impact. But the question states that when hired, they perform as well. So the test might be unnecessarily screening out qualified women, leading to adverse impact.

But wait, what's the exact definition of each term. Adverse impact doesn't require intent, just that a practice has a disparate effect. Differential validity is when a selection tool has different validity across different groups. So if the test is less valid for women, that's differential validity.

In this scenario, the test is less predictive for women, implying differential validity. Because women's test scores don't correlate with their job performance as much as men's do. So when the test is used, it's keeping out women who would have done well, leading to a validity issue specific to women.

Alternatively, the test could be valid for the job overall but have adverse impact because it's keeping women out who would perform well. But maybe in this case, the test isn't valid for women, so it's differential validity.

Wait, but another angle: if the test has the same cutoff for everyone, and women are scoring lower, they might be excluded more, leading to adverse impact. But the test's validity is the same for both. Or maybe the test is not valid for women. So if women's job performance isn't predicted by the test as well, that's differential validity.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall: Adverse impact is about the outcomes disproportionately affecting a group. Differential validity is about the test's validity differing across groups.

In this case, the test is less valid for women because when they are hired (so when the test isn't a barrier), they perform as well. So the test isn't a good predictor for them. So that's differential validity. But wait, the test may have been constructed in a way that it's biased against women, leading to lower scores but same performance.

But another thought: the test may have adverse impact because it's causing fewer women to be hired than men, even though when hired, they perform well. So the impact is adverse, even if the test isn't necessarily biased in validity.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: adverse impact. Because the test is having a disproportionately negative effect on women (they score lower, so presumably fewer are selected), but when they are selected, they perform as well. So the effect is adverse, and the test may not be a valid measure for them.

Alternatively, differential validity would mean that the test is a valid predictor for men but not for women. So if the test is only valid for men, and women's test scores don't predict their performance as well, that's differential validity.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find another approach.

The scenario is that women score lower but perform as well. So the test is underpredicting their abilities. That suggests that the test is not valid for women, which is differential validity. Because validity is the extent to which the test predicts job performance. If for women, the test scores don't correlate with job performance, then it's less valid.

So in that case, the problem is differential validity.

Wait, but if the test is used as a selection tool, and women are being excluded because of lower scores, but when they do get hired, they perform as well, that's an adverse impact situation because the test is causing a negative impact on women, even if it's unintentional.

So perhaps the answer is E: adverse impact.

Alternatively, it's differential validity. Which one is correct?

Wait, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP) define adverse impact as when the selection rate for a protected group is less than 80% of the majority group. But in this question, it's not clear about the selection rates, but the fact that lower scores are obtained by women would likely lead to lower hiring rates if the test is used as a cutoff.

So if the test is used and results in fewer women being hired, that's adverse impact.

But the question says that when hired, women perform as well. So the test is causing an adverse impact because it's screening out women who could have been successful. So the situation is adverse impact.

So the answer would be E.

Wait, but the test's validity is an issue. If the test is not a good predictor for women, then it's a validity issue. But adverse impact is about the effect, regardless of validity.

So perhaps the correct answer is E: adverse impact.

But I'm a bit torn between E and D.

Wait, the question is about what the situation illustrates. The key point is that the test is causing a problem for women in selection (lower scores) but doesn't reflect their actual job performance.

So this is an example of the test having an adverse impact on women because it's affecting their hiring rates disproportionately, even though they can perform the job.

Thus, the answer is E: adverse impact.

The question describes a scenario where female applicants consistently score lower on a selection test than male applicants, yet when hired, they perform as well as males on the job. The key issue here is that the test appears to disproportionately affect women, potentially leading to fewer being hired, even though they are equally capable of performing the job. This situation raises concerns about the fairness and validity of the selection process.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (Reverse discrimination):** This refers to policies or practices that unfairly disadvantage a majority group, which is not relevant here.  
- **Option B (Disparate treatment):** This involves treating individuals differently based on protected characteristics, but the test is applied uniformly to all applicants.  
- **Option C (Differential selection):** This could refer to different selection rates for different groups, but it is not the most precise term for this scenario.  
- **Option D (Differential validity):** This refers to a situation where a test predicts job performance differently for different groups. While the test may be less predictive for women, the question emphasizes the disproportionate impact on hiring, making this less fitting.  
- **Option E (Adverse impact):** This occurs when a neutral employment practice disproportionately affects a protected group. The test causing lower scores for women, potentially leading to fewer hires, aligns with this definition.  
- **Option F (Unfairness):** While the situation seems unfair, this term is too vague and does not capture the specific issue described.  
- **Option G (Glass ceiling effect):** This refers to barriers preventing women from advancing to higher positions, which is unrelated to the selection test scenario.  
- **Option H (Gender bias):** This is a broader term and does not specifically address the disproportionate impact of the test.  
- **Option I (Sexual harassment):** This is unrelated to the scenario.  
- **Option J (Constructive dismissal):** This involves employees feeling forced to resign, which is irrelevant here.  

The most accurate term for this scenario is **adverse impact**, as the test disproportionately affects women by potentially excluding qualified candidates who could perform the job as well as men. While differential validity might also be relevant, the emphasis on the disproportionate effect of the test makes adverse impact the better choice.
