Okay, so I have this question about a theory in philosophy, specifically related to the mind and brain. The question is asking which theory states that mental states are nothing but brain states. Hmm, I remember that there are several theories and terms related to this topic, so I need to think carefully.

First, let me go through the options one by one. The options are A through J, each with a different term. I'll try to recall what each term means.

Option A is Monism. I think monism is a general term that refers to the belief that there is only one kind of substance or principle in the universe. It's the opposite of dualism, which posits two substances, like mind and matter. But monism itself doesn't specifically say that mental states are brain states; it's more about the fundamental nature of reality being singular. So maybe not A.

Option B is Functionalism. From what I remember, functionalism is the view that mental states are determined by their functional roles, like how they interact with other states and the environment. It's more about what the mind does rather than what it's made of. So functionalism is about the function, not necessarily identifying the mind with the brain. So B might not be the correct answer.

Option C is Identity Theory. I think this is a specific type of monism where mental states are directly identified as brain states. Like, every mental event is a physical event in the brain. This sounds exactly like what the question is describing. So C could be the right choice.

Option D is Dualism. Dualism posits that the mind and body are separate entities, so this is the opposite of what the question is asking. The question is about mental states being brain states, which would eliminate dualism as an option. So D is out.

Option E is Brain Theory. I'm not too familiar with this term. It might refer to theories about how the brain works, but I don't think it's the standard term used for the idea that mental states are just brain states. So probably not E.

Option F is Logical Behaviorism. Behaviorism, in general, suggests that mental states can be explained by behavior, and logical behaviorism ties that to language and logical analysis. It reduces mental states to behavioral dispositions, so it's more about behavior than brain states. So F isn't the right choice.

Option G is Eliminative Materialism. This theory argues that mental states, as commonly understood, don't exist and should be eliminated in favor of explanations from neuroscience and psychology. It's more radical than just saying mental states are brain states; it says common mental concepts are outdated. So G might not fit the question perfectly.

Option H is Physicalism. Physicalism is a broader term that suggests everything is physical, including the mind. It's similar to materialism and might encompass the idea that mental states are brain states, but it's a more general view. The question seems to ask for a more specific theory.

Option I is Epiphenomenalism. This theory states that mental states are byproducts of physical processes in the brain but don't cause anything themselves. So the mind is a result of the brain but doesn't influence it. This is different from saying mental states are nothing but brain states. So I isn't the answer.

Option J is Reductionism. Reductionism is about explaining complex phenomena in terms of simpler components. While the idea that mental states reduce to brain states could be a form of reductionism, the term isn't specific to mental states. It's a more general approach used in various sciences. So J might not be the best fit.

Putting it all together, the question is about a theory that equates mental states directly with brain states. Monism is too broad, physicalism is also broad, functionalism is about roles, dualism is the opposite. The most specific and accurate term here is Identity Theory, which is option C.

The theory that states mental states are nothing but brain states is known as **Identity Theory**. This theory posits that mental events are directly equivalent to physical events in the brain, making it the most specific and accurate term for the concept described in the question.

Answer: C
