Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Warner and Myrdal's claims regarding black former slaves not joining the ethnic melting pot in North American cities. I need to think through this carefully.

First, I remember that Warner and Myrdal were sociologists who studied race relations. I think Myrdal wrote "An American Dilemma," which discussed the contradiction between American ideals and the reality of racial discrimination.

The question is about why black former slaves weren't integrating into this melting pot. The options are from A to I. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: North American cities didn't offer any advantages over the Southern states. I don't think that's right. After the Civil War, many African Americans moved north during the Great Migration because of better economic opportunities and escaping Jim Crow laws. So the cities did offer advantages, making A unlikely.

Option B: White population didn't believe in liberty, equality, and democracy. Well, many white people did believe in those ideals, but there was still discrimination. This might be part of the issue, but I'm not sure if this is the reason Warner and Myrdal pointed out.

Option C: They weren't physically capable of moving. That doesn't make sense. Moving is possible; it's more about economic or social barriers, not physical inability.

Option D: Government didn't allow them to join. There were certainly discriminatory laws, like segregation and later things like redlining, but I'm not sure if it was outright banning them from the melting pot. It's more about social exclusion rather than legal prohibition.

Option E: They wanted to retain their ethnic identity. That could be a factor, but I think the main issue was more about external barriers rather than internal choices. The melting pot idea often implies assimilation, but maybe African Americans faced resistance to being included.

Option F: They weren't prepared to leave the South. Again, during the Great Migration, many did leave, so this doesn't seem right.

Option G: They weren't economically capable. Economic factors did play a role, but the question is about joining the ethnic melting pot, which is more social. So maybe not the direct reason.

Option H: The promise of citizenship was contradicted by discrimination. This sounds familiar. Myrdal's work highlighted the contradiction between American ideals (like citizenship and equality) and the reality of discrimination. So even though they were citizens, they were excluded because of racism.

Option I: Afraid of losing cultural heritage. Similar to E, but again, the main issue was probably external discrimination rather than fear of losing culture.

Putting it all together, the most plausible answer is H. Warner and Myrdal likely pointed out that despite the promise of citizenship and inclusion, discrimination prevented African Americans from joining the melting pot.

The correct answer is H: the promise of citizenship was contradicted by continued discrimination.

Answer: H
