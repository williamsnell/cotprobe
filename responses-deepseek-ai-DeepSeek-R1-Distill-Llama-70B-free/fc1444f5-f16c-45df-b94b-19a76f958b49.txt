Alright, so I've got this problem about the expansion coefficient of a liquid. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question gives me a formula for volume as a function of temperature. The expansion coefficient, alpha, is what I need to find at 320 K.

Wait, what's the expansion coefficient again? Oh right, the volumetric expansion coefficient, alpha, is defined as the fractional change in volume per unit change in temperature. The formula is usually (1/V) * (dV/dT). But wait, sometimes it's written as (dV/dT)/(V), which would be the same thing.

The volume is given by V = V' [0.75 + 3.9e-4 (T/K) + 1.48e-6 (T/K)^2]. Oh wait, V' is the volume at 300 K. So, at T=300 K, the expression inside the curly brackets must be 1, right? Because then V would be V' * 1 = V'. Let me check that. Plugging T=300 K into the expression inside:

0.75 + 3.9e-4*(300) + 1.48e-6*(300)^2. Let's compute each term.

3.9e-4 * 300 = 0.117. 1.48e-6 * 90000 = 0.1332. So adding them up: 0.75 + 0.117 + 0.1332 = about 1.0002. Hmm, close enough to 1, considering some rounding maybe.

But wait, the question says V' is the volume at 300 K, so perhaps the expression is set up that way. So, the general formula is correct.

Now, to find alpha at 320 K. So I need to compute (1/V) * (dV/dT) at T=320 K.

First, let's write V as a function of T: V(T) = V' * [0.75 + 3.9e-4 T + 1.48e-6 T^2]. Hmm, wait, but the (T/K) term is just T in Kelvin, right? So maybe it's easier to just treat T as in Kelvin.

So V(T) = V' * [0.75 + 3.9e-4 T + 1.48e-6 T²]

To find dV/dT, I'll take the derivative of V with respect to T.

V' is a constant, so dV/dT = V' * derivative of the bracket.

Derivative of 0.75 is 0. Derivative of 3.9e-4 T is 3.9e-4. Derivative of 1.48e-6 T² is 2*1.48e-6 T = 2.96e-6 T.

So dV/dT = V' [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 T]

Then, (1/V) * dV/dT is [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 T] divided by V/V'.

Wait, because V = V' * f(T), so V/V' = f(T). So 1/V * dV/dT = [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 T] / [0.75 + 3.9e-4 T + 1.48e-6 T²]

But wait, is that correct? Let me think. Let me write it as:

alpha = (1/V) dV/dT = [dV/dT]/V = [V' (3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 T)] / [V' (0.75 + 3.9e-4 T + 1.48e-6 T²)]

Oh right, the V' cancels out. So alpha = (3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 T) / (0.75 + 3.9e-4 T + 1.48e-6 T²)

So now, plug in T = 320 K.

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 * 320.

Let's compute each term:

3.9e-4 is 0.00039.

2.96e-6 * 320 = (2.96 * 320) * 1e-6.

2.96 * 320: 300 * 2.96 = 888, 20*2.96=59.2 → total 947.2. So 947.2e-6 = 0.0009472.

So numerator is 0.00039 + 0.0009472 = 0.0013372.

Denominator: 0.75 + 3.9e-4 *320 + 1.48e-6 * (320)^2.

Compute each term:

3.9e-4 *320 = 0.00039 *320 = 0.1248.

1.48e-6 * (320)^2 → 320^2 is 102400. 1.48e-6 * 102400 = 1.48 * 102400e-6 → 1.48 * 0.1024 → approx 0.151632.

Wait, let me compute it accurately:

320^2 = 102400. So 1.48e-6 * 102400 = (1.48 * 102400) * 1e-6.

1.48 * 102400 = Let's compute it step by step.

1.48 * 100,000 = 148,000.

1.48 * 2,400 = 3,552.

So total 148,000 + 3,552 = 151,552.

So 151,552e-6 = 0.151552.

So denominator terms: 0.75 + 0.1248 + 0.151552.

Adding them up: 0.75 = 0.750000, plus 0.1248 → 0.8748, plus 0.151552 → 1.026352.

So denominator is approximately 1.026352.

So alpha = 0.0013372 / 1.026352.

Let me compute this division.

0.0013372 / 1.026352 ≈ ?

Well, 1.026352 is about 1.02635.

So 0.0013372 ÷ 1.02635.

Let me write it as 1.3372e-3 ÷ 1.02635.

Hmm, let's compute:

Approximately, 1.3372 / 1.02635 = about 1.303, because 1.02635 * 1.3 is approximately 1.334. Wait, let me check:

1.02635 * 1.3 = 1.034255. Hmm, but 1.3 is giving 1.034255, which is less than 1.3372.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute 1.3372e-3 / 1.02635.

Let me compute 1.3372e-3 ≈ 0.0013372.

Divide that by 1.02635.

Let me think of this as 0.0013372 ÷ 1.02635.

Hmm, which is roughly 0.001303, because 1.02635 * 0.001303 ≈ 0.001337.

Wait, let me compute 1.02635 * 0.001303.

1.02635 * 0.001 = 0.00102635.

1.02635 * 0.0003 = 0.000307905.

1.02635 * 0.000003 = 0.00000307905.

Adding them: 0.00102635 + 0.000307905 = 0.001334255 + 0.00000307905 ≈ 0.001337334. So 1.02635 * 0.001303 ≈ 0.0013373, which matches the numerator. So 0.0013372 /1.02635 ≈ 0.001303.

So alpha ≈ 1.303e-3 K^-1.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A: 1.50e-3

B:1.19e-3

C:1.15e-3

D:1.31e-3

E:1.33e-3

F:1.05e-3

G:1.27e-3

H:1.22e-3

I:1.38e-3

J:1.45e-3

So my approximate calculation gives 1.303e-3, which is closest to option D, which is 1.31e-3. But wait, perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the division more precisely.

Compute 0.0013372 / 1.026352.

Let me write both in terms of 1e-3.

Numerator: 1.3372e-3

Denominator: 1.026352.

So (1.3372e-3) / 1.026352 = (1.3372 / 1026.352) )e-3? Wait, no, perhaps better to compute as:

Divide 1.3372 by 1026.352 to get approximately 0.001303, but that's not correct.

Wait, no. Wait, wait: denominator is approx 1.02635, which is about 1.02635.

So 1.3372e-3 / 1.02635 = (1.3372 / 1026.35) )? No, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think: A is 1.3372e-3, B is 1.026352.

So A/B = (1.3372e-3)/(1.026352) ≈ Let me compute 1.3372e-3 divided by 1.026352.

Let me compute 1.3372e-3 ÷ 1.026352.

1.3372e-3 is 0.0013372.

Divide 0.0013372 by 1.026352.

So, how many times does 1.026352 go into 1.3372?

Wait, 1.026352 * 1.303 = 1.3373. Oh wait, because earlier I found that 1.02635 * 0.001303 gives about 0.0013373, so 0.001303 is the value.

Wait, no, wait: 1.026352 * 0.001303 = 0.0013373, which is the numerator. So 0.0013372 / 1.026352 = 0.001303, which is 1.303e-3, which is 1.303 x 1e-3 = 0.001303.

So alpha is approximately 1.303e-3 K^-1.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1.31e-3, which is the closest. But wait, let me see if perhaps I made any miscalculations in the numerator or denominator.

Wait, let's double-check the numerator:

At T=320,

numerator: 3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 *320.

3.9e-4 is 0.00039.

2.96e-6 *320 = (2.96 *320) * 1e-6 = 947.2e-6 = 0.0009472.

Adding 0.00039 + 0.0009472 gives 0.0013372. That seems correct.

Denominator: 0.75 + 3.9e-4 *320 + 1.48e-6*(320)^2.

3.9e-4 *320 = 0.1248.

1.48e-6 * 320^2 = 1.48e-6 * 102400 = 0.151552.

So 0.75 + 0.1248 = 0.8748 + 0.151552 = 1.026352. Correct.

So the division is 0.0013372 / 1.026352 = 0.001303, which is 1.303e-3. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is D: 1.31e-3, but there's also option E: 1.33e-3. Wait, I'm getting approximately 1.303e-3, which is very close to 1.30e-3, but the options don't have that exact value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial differentiation. Let me check.

The given V is V' times [0.75 + 3.9e-4 (T/K) + 1.48e-6 (T/K)^2].

Wait a second, the terms are (T/K), so when T is in Kelvin, it's just (T/K) = 1, so it's unitless. So for T=300 K, each term is (300/K) which is 1? No, wait, perhaps I've been treating T as Kelvin, but in the formula, it's written as T/K, which would make it unitless, so in the formula, T is in Kelvin. So when T=300 K, T/K is 300/300=1, so (T/K)=1.

Wait, but when I take the derivative, if the terms are (T/K), that is, (T over Kelvin), then the T is in Kelvin, and (T/K) is unitless. So when taking the derivative, d(T/K) is (1/K) dT, because T is in Kelvin. So when I take the derivative of 3.9e-4 (T/K), it's 3.9e-4 * (1/K) = 3.9e-4 / K. Similarly, for the quadratic term, derivative is 2*(1.48e-6)*(T/K)* (1/K), because derivative of (T/K)^2 is 2(T/K) * (1/K).

Wait, wait, this is a crucial point! I think I might have made a mistake earlier because I didn't account for the units properly when taking the derivative.

Let me clarify. Let's define x = T/K, where T is in Kelvin. So x is unitless. Then, the volume equation is V = V' [0.75 + 3.9e-4 x + 1.48e-6 x^2]. Then, dV/dT would be the derivative of V with respect to x times dx/dT.

So, dV/dx = V' [3.9e-4 + 2 * 1.48e-6 x] = V' [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 x]

And dx/dT is (1/Kelvin), because x = T/K, so d x/dT = 1/K.

So, dV/dT = dV/dx * dx/dT = V' [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 x] * (1/K)

Wait, this changes things. So I think I missed the (1/K) factor in the derivative.

Wait, so let me redo the calculation with this in mind.

So, V = V' [0.75 + 3.9e-4*(T/K) + 1.48e-6*(T/K)^2]

Let x = T/K. So V = V' [0.75 + 3.9e-4 x + 1.48e-6 x^2]

dV/dx = V' [3.9e-4 + 2*1.48e-6 x] = V' [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 x]

dx/dT = 1/(K), since x = T/K → dx/dT = 1/K.

So dV/dT = dV/dx * dx/dT = V' [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 x] * (1/K)

Thus, (1/V) dV/dT = [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 x]/(V/V') → but V/V' is [0.75 + 3.9e-4 x + 1.48e-6 x^2]

So, (1/V) dV/dT = [3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 x]/(0.75 + 3.9e-4 x + 1.48e-6 x^2) ) * (1/K)

Wait a minute, because dV/dT includes a 1/K factor. So when I compute alpha as (1/V)(dV/dT), I must include this 1/K factor.

So, let's compute this with x = T/K = 320/300? No, wait, wait. Wait, in the formula, x is T/K, but T is in Kelvin. So for T=320 K, x=320/1 = 320? Wait, no, because x is T/K, so if T is 320 K, then x is 320 K / K → 320, a unitless number.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if T is 320 K, then T/K is 320 K / K = 320, which is unitless. So x is 320.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the denominator, I used T=320 K, so x=320. But when I took the derivative earlier without considering the 1/K factor, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me correct the approach.

So, in this correct approach, the expansion coefficient alpha is:

alpha = (1/V) * (dV/dT) = [ (3.9e-4 + 2.96e-6 x) * (1/K) ] / [0.75 + 3.9e-4 x + 1.48e-6 x^2 ]

Where x = T/K, and T is in Kelvin.

Wait, but K is the unit. So when T is in Kelvin, x is T/K, which is unitless. So when I plug in T=320 K, x=320 K/K = 320, unitless.

So, let's compute this at T=320 K, x=320.

So numerator of the fraction inside the brackets is
