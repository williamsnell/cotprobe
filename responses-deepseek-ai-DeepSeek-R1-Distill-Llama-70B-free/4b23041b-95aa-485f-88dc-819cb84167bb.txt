Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about what some contemporary intelligence researchers are complaining that schools focus too much on. The question mentions Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg specifically. I remember that both of them have theories about intelligence that go beyond the traditional views.

Gardner is known for his theory of multiple intelligences. From what I recall, he argues that people have different types of intelligences, like linguistic, musical, spatial, etc., and that schools often only focus on a few of these, mainly the academic ones. So he's critical of the education system for neglecting other forms of intelligence, like artistic or kinesthetic.

Sternberg, on the other hand, proposed the triarchic theory of intelligence, which includes analytical, creative, and practical intelligence. He's also critical of schools because they tend to prioritize analytical intelligence, which is measured through tests and academic performance, while ignoring creative and practical aspects. This means schools might not be fostering all the types of thinking that are important for real-life success.

The question is asking what these researchers think schools focus too much on. The options are A through J. Let's look at them one by one.

Option A: Nonessential subjects like art and music. Wait, Gardner actually values art and music as part of his multiple intelligences. So if schools are focusing too much on these, that doesn't seem right because Gardner would probably want more attention on these, not less.

Option B: Fostering collaborative learning environments. I don't think this is the main issue. Collaborative learning is more about how students work together, not the subjects or methods being criticized here.

Option C: Traditional subjects and methods. This sounds plausible. Traditional subjects would be things like math, reading, maybe scienceâ€”what schools usually focus on. Methods might be the standard teaching approaches. Since both Gardner and Sternberg argue for a broader view of intelligence, they might be criticizing the focus on these traditional areas.

Option D: Promoting physical education and sports. I don't think this is what they're focusing on. Their criticism is more about the academic subjects rather than physical education.

Option E: Cultivating social intelligence. Social intelligence is part of Gardner's multiple intelligences, so if schools were focusing on that, it might be in line with his views, not something he'd complain about.

Option F: The development of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is another concept, but I'm not sure if that's directly tied to Gardner or Sternberg's main points. They're more about types of intelligence rather than emotional aspects specifically.

Option G: Individual learning styles and preferences. Learning styles are another educational concept, but I don't recall Gardner or Sternberg focusing on that in their critiques. Their focus is more on the types of intelligence rather than how each student learns.

Option H: Encouraging creative thought. Wait, Sternberg's theory includes creative intelligence, so if schools were encouraging creative thought, that would be a good thing according to him. So he'd complain if schools are not doing enough of this, but the question says they're complaining about what schools focus too much on. So maybe the opposite.

Option I: The use of technology in education. I don't think this is directly related to their arguments. Their focus is more on the curriculum and methods rather than technology use.

Option J: Environmental factors influencing intelligence expression. That's more about how environment affects intelligence, which might relate to Sternberg's work on practical intelligence, but I'm not sure if this is the main point of their complaint about school focus.

So, putting it together, the main issue is that schools focus too much on traditional academic subjects and teaching methods. Gardner would say they're neglecting other intelligences, and Sternberg would say they're not teaching creativity or practical skills. So the answer should be option C.

The question asks what Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg criticize schools for focusing too much on. Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences highlights that schools often neglect non-traditional forms of intelligence, such as artistic or musical. Sternberg's triarchic theory emphasizes that schools prioritize analytical intelligence over creative and practical intelligence. Both argue that schools focus too narrowly on traditional academic subjects and methods, neglecting broader aspects of intelligence. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as Gardner values art and music.
- **B**: Incorrect, as collaborative learning isn't their main critique.
- **C**: Correct, as it aligns with their criticism of traditional academic focus.
- **D**: Incorrect, as physical education isn't their focus.
- **E**: Incorrect, as social intelligence is part of Gardner's theory.
- **F**: Incorrect, as emotional intelligence isn't their main concern.
- **G**: Incorrect, as they focus on types of intelligence, not learning styles.
- **H**: Incorrect, as they advocate for creative thought, not its overemphasis.
- **I**: Incorrect, as technology use isn't relevant here.
- **J**: Incorrect, as environmental factors aren't the main issue.

Thus, the answer is **C: traditional subjects and methods**.

Answer: C
