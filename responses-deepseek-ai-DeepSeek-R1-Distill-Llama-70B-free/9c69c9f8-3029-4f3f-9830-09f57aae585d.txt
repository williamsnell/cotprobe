Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the force constant of HCl using a Morse potential expansion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem gives me an equation from the Maclaurin expansion of a Morse potential. The equation is V(x) = D β² x² + ... So, from what I remember, a Maclaurin expansion is just a Taylor series expansion around x=0. That means the potential is being approximated as a parabola near the equilibrium point, which makes sense for small displacements.

Wait, the general form of a potential near equilibrium for a diatomic molecule is often approximated as a harmonic oscillator, right? So the potential would look like (1/2) k x², where k is the force constant. Oh wait, but in this case, the given expansion is V(x) = D β² x² + ... So comparing that to the harmonic form, which is (1/2) k x², I need to find what k is in terms of D and β.

So if V(x) ≈ D β² x², but the harmonic form is (1/2)k x². Wait, am I missing a factor here? Or maybe the given expansion is already in the form without the 1/2? Let me double-check. Oh wait, in the problem statement, the expansion is D β² x², which would correspond to the coefficient being k/2 if it's the harmonic potential. Because in harmonic oscillator, V(x) = (1/2)k x². So that would mean D β² = (1/2) k. Therefore, k = 2 D β².

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. The general expansion for a Morse potential around the minimum is V(r) = D (β (r - r0))² + ... So when expanded around r0, the leading term is D β² (r - r0)^2, which is the same as D β² x² where x is displacement from equilibrium. So yes, the potential is V(x) = D β² x². But the standard form is (1/2) k x², so setting D β² = (1/2)k. Therefore, k = 2 D β².

Wait, wait, no, wait. Because the expansion given is V(x) = D β² x², so comparing to (1/2)k x², that would mean D β² = (1/2)k. So solving for k gives k = 2 D β². Okay, that makes sense.

So now I have the formula for k: k = 2 * D * β².

The given values are D = 7.31e-19 J·molecule^-1 and β = 1.81e10 m^-1.

Let me compute this step by step. First, compute β squared. β is 1.81e10 m^-1, so β squared is (1.81e10)^2. Let's compute that.

1.81 squared is approximately 3.2761. Then, (1e10)^2 is 1e20. So 1.81e10 squared is 3.2761e20 m^-2.

Then multiply by D: 7.31e-19 J/molecule * 3.2761e20 m^-2 = ?

So 7.31e-19 * 3.2761e20 = Let's compute the exponent part first: 1e-19 * 1e20 = 1e1 (since 1e-19 *1e20 = 1e^( -19 +20 )=1e^1=10).

Now multiply the coefficients: 7.31 * 3.2761. Let me compute that. 7 *3 is 21, 7*0.2761 is about 1.9327. 0.31 *3 is 0.93, 0.31 *0.2761 is about 0.0855. So adding up:

7 *3.2761 = 22.9327
0.31 *3.2761 ≈ 1.0155
Wait, no, wait. Actually, 7.31 *3.2761 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately. 7 *3.2761 = 22.9327. 0.31 *3.2761 = 1.0155. So total is 22.9327 +1.0155 ≈23.9482.

So 7.31 *3.2761 ≈23.948. Then multiply by 1e1 (10), so 23.948 *10=239.48.

So D * β² ≈ 239.48 J/m. But then, remember that k=2*D β², so multiply by 2: k ≈ 478.96 J/m, which is N/m since 1 J =1 N·m.

So approximately 479 N/m. Looking at the options, option I is 479 N·m^-1, so that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations, especially the exponents and multiplication.

D =7.31e-19 J, β=1.81e10 m^-1.

So β squared is (1.81e10)^2 = (1.81)^2 * (1e10)^2 = 3.2761 * 1e20 =3.2761e20 m^-2.

Multiply by D: 7.31e-19 *3.2761e20 = (7.31 *3.2761) * (1e-19 *1e20) = 23.948 * 1e1 = 239.48.

Then k=2 *239.48 =478.96 ≈479 N/m.

So the closest option is I:479 N·m^-1.

To calculate the force constant \( k \) of HCl, we start with the given Maclaurin expansion of the Morse potential:

\[
V(x) = D \beta^2 x^2 + \cdots
\]

This is compared to the standard harmonic potential form:

\[
V(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

From this comparison, we identify that:

\[
D \beta^2 = \frac{1}{2} k
\]

Rearranging for \( k \), we find:

\[
k = 2 D \beta^2
\]

The given values are:

\[
D = 7.31 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J \cdot molecule^{-1}}, \quad \beta = 1.81 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{m^{-1}}
\]

First, calculate \( \beta^2 \):

\[
\beta^2 = (1.81 \times 10^{10})^2 = 3.2761 \times 10^{20} \, \mathrm{m^{-2}}
\]

Next, calculate \( D \beta^2 \):

\[
D \beta^2 = (7.31 \times 10^{-19}) \times (3.2761 \times 10^{20}) = 239.48 \, \mathrm{J \cdot m^{-1}}
\]

Finally, calculate \( k \):

\[
k = 2 D \beta^2 = 2 \times 239.48 = 478.96 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^{-1}}
\]

Rounding to three significant figures, \( k \approx 479 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^{-1}} \).

From the options provided, the closest match is:

**I: 479 \(\mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-1}\)**.
