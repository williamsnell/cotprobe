Okay, so I have this question about Mill defining "utility." Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about John Stuart Mill and utilitarianism.

From what I remember, utilitarianism is an ethical theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. I think Mill was a key figure in this, maybe even an improvement on earlier ideas. So utility, in this context, is about what's useful in terms of promoting happiness.

Wait, wasn't Mill's version a bit more nuanced than Bentham's? Oh right, Bentham focused on the quantity of pleasure, while Mill emphasized the quality. But the question is about how Mill defines "utility," so I should focus on that.

I think the term "utility" in Mill's work refers to the idea that actions are right if they promote happiness, and wrong if they produce the opposite. So, the definition would relate to the usefulness in creating happiness or preventing unhappiness.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Advantage or benefit to the user. That sounds a bit narrow because it's focused on the individual user, not the overall. I think utility in utilitarianism is more about the greater good.

Option B: Usefulness for some craft. That doesn't ring a bell. Crafts aren't really part of Mill's discussions, so probably not this.

Option C: The ability to satisfy wants and needs. That's closer. Utility is about meeting desires and needs, which ties into happiness. But I think Mill's definition is more specific about happiness and preventing suffering.

Option D: Usefulness to an individual. Again, this seems too individualistic. Mill's utilitarianism is about the collective, the greatest number.

Option E: It promotes the interests of all and does not harm anyone. That's a bit too idealistic. In reality, sometimes actions might harm some but benefit more. So this might not capture the full essence.

Option F: It promotes self-interest. No, because utilitarianism is more about the greater good, not self-interest, which is more of an egoistic approach.

Option G: The state of being useful, profitable, or beneficial. This seems a bit too general. It doesn't tie directly to happiness or the prevention of pain, which are central to utility.

Option H: Pleasure and the absence of pain. Wait, this sounds like the hedonic calculus from Bentham, not Mill. Mill's utility includes higher pleasures and considers quality over quantity, but the core is still about pleasure and pain.

Option I: Usefulness to society. This is getting somewhere. Utility is about what's beneficial for society as a whole, which aligns with the greatest happiness principle.

Option J: It benefits the majority and harms the minority. This is a bit tricky. While utilitarianism does consider the majority's happiness, it's not necessarily about harming a minority. It's more about the overall net utility, not just majority over minority.

Wait, but Mill's definition of utility is specifically the Greatest Happiness Principle. So he defines utility as the promotion of happiness and the prevention of pain. So looking back, which option aligns with that.

Option H says pleasure and absence of pain, which is exactly the hedonic aspect. But wait, Mill's version is a bit more refined, but the core definition of utility is still tied to pleasure and pain.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is asking how Mill defines "utility," not necessarily the entire theory. So in his work, he might have defined it in terms of pleasure and pain. Or perhaps more about the overall usefulness in terms of happiness for the greatest number.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option I says "usefulness to society." That might fit because utility is about what's beneficial for society as a whole.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to recall specific passages. In "Utilitarianism," Mill defines it as the doctrine that an action is right if it promotes happiness and wrong if it promotes unhappiness. So the utility is about the overall happiness.

So the definition would be about the ability to produce happiness. Looking back at the options, option C is about satisfying wants and needs, which can lead to happiness. Option G is about being useful, profitable, beneficial. Option I is about society.

Wait, another angle: Mill's concept is often summarized as "the greatest happiness for the greatest number." So the utility is about the overall happiness.

Looking at the options, option G says "the state of being useful, profitable, or beneficial." That seems to encapsulate the idea of something being useful towards an end, which in this case is happiness.

Alternatively, option H is about pleasure and absence of pain, which is more Bentham than Mill. But Mill does use the term utility in the sense of promoting pleasure and preventing pain, even if he adds more nuance.

Wait, the question is asking for Mill's definition. So I think option G is a bit vague, but option H is more specific about pleasure and pain, which is directly tied to utility.

But I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. Mill's definition of utility is tied to the concept of happiness, which is a state of pleasure and absence of pain. So option H is "pleasure and the absence of pain." That seems accurate.

But wait, another possibility: the question might be referring to the concept of utility in economics, but I don't think so because the question is about Mill, the philosopher, so it's about ethical utility.

So, putting it together, I think the correct answer is H: pleasure and the absence of pain.

Mill defines "utility" in the context of utilitarianism, which is an ethical theory that actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they promote unhappiness. Specifically, Mill's version of utility emphasizes the quality of happiness and is often summarized by the "Greatest Happiness Principle," which aims to maximize overall happiness and minimize pain. Among the options provided, the one that most accurately captures Mill's definition of utility is:

**H: pleasure and the absence of pain.**

This aligns with the core idea that utility, for Mill, is tied to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain, even though his approach adds nuance by prioritizing higher-quality pleasures.
