Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a chemical reaction carried out in a basic solution, and I need to find out how many moles of Cl⁻ will be in the final solution. 

The reaction provided is:

HC₂O₄⁻ + Cl₂CO₃²⁻ + Cl⁻ → ... (I think the products are missing, but maybe I can figure it out from the context.)

Wait, the problem states that the reaction is to be carried out in a basic solution. So, I probably need to balance the equation under basic conditions. 

The reactants given are:
- 0.10 mole of OH⁻ (so it's a basic solution)
- 0.10 mole of HC₂O₄⁻ (which is the hydrogen oxalate ion)
- 0.05 mole of Cl₂ (chlorine gas)

Hmm, I think the reaction involves the oxidation of oxalate ions by chlorine in a basic solution. Chlorine can act as an oxidizing agent here. The products are likely to be CO₃²⁻ (carbonate) and Cl⁻ (chloride), since Cl₂ is getting reduced.

Wait, let me write the possible half-reactions. 

First, the oxidation of HC₂O₄⁻. In basic solution, oxalate (C₂O₄^2-) is oxidized to carbonate (CO₃^2-), I think. So, let's write that half-reaction.

The oxidation half-reaction would be:
HC₂O₄⁻ → CO₃²⁻ 

But I need to balance this in basic solution. Let me do that step by step.

1. Balance the C atoms: On the left, there are 2 C in HC₂O₄⁻. On the right, each CO₃²⁻ has 1 C. So, I'll need 2 CO₃²⁻ on the right.

HC₂O₄⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

2. Balance O with H2O and OH⁻. The left has 4 O (from C₂O₄). The right has 2*(3 O) = 6 O, but wait, that's 6 O on the right. So, the left has 4 O, right has 6 O. Hmm, maybe I should add H2O on the left as needed.

Wait, maybe a better approach: Let's count O on both sides. HC₂O₄⁻ has 4 O. So on the right, 2 CO₃²⁻ have 2*3=6 O. So difference is 2 O on the right. To balance, I can add H2O on the left. Alternatively, maybe add H2O to the other side. Wait, maybe I should proceed with the steps.

Another approach: Since it's basic solution, I can balance O by adding H2O and OH⁻.

Let me write the steps:

HC₂O₄⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

Now, balance O:

Left: 4 O (from HC₂O₄⁻)
Right: 2 * 3 O = 6 O
So, need 2 more O on the left. I can add H2O to the left. Wait, but adding H2O to the left would add O. Alternatively, perhaps I should add H2O to the right to balance O. Hmm, maybe I should think about each side.

Wait, the left has 4 O, the right has 6 O. So, the left side is short by 2 O. So, to balance O, maybe add 2 H2O to the left. Let me try that:

HC₂O₄⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

Now, let's balance H. On the left, HC₂O₄⁻ has 1 H, and 2 H2O gives 4 H. So total H on left is 5 H.

On the right, no H yet. So, I'll need to add H+ on the right, but since it's a basic solution, I should convert H+ to OH⁻.

Wait, no, in basic solution, I can't have H+; I need to proceed by adding OH⁻ to both sides as needed.

Wait, another approach: Let's balance the O first.

HC₂O₄⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

O on left: 4, right: 6. So, need 2 O on left, I'll add 2 H2O to the left.

HC₂O₄⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

Now, balance H. Left side has (1 from HC₂O₄⁻) + (2 H2O * 2 H) = 5 H.

On the right, no H. So, add H to the right. Since it's basic, we can't have H+; instead, we can add H2O and OH⁻.

Wait, maybe I should add 4 H+ to the right, but then in basic solution, I need to neutralize by adding OH⁻ to both sides.

Wait, perhaps I should balance H as follows:

Left: 5 H (from HC₂O₄⁻ and 2 H2O). Right: 0 H. So, I need to add 5 H to the right. But since it's basic, I can't have H+; instead, I can add 5 H2O to the right and adjust.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach: write the oxidation half-reaction in acidic solution first, then convert to basic.

In acidic solution, the oxidation of HC₂O₄⁻ to CO₃²⁻ would be:

HC₂O₄⁻ → CO₂(g) + H+ + e⁻ 

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, let's write the half-reaction step by step.

In acidic conditions:

HC₂O₄⁻ → CO₂ + H+ + e⁻ 

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should find the correct oxidation half-reaction for oxalate ion to carbonate.

Alternatively, I remember that the oxidation of oxalate ion (C₂O₄²−) in basic solution produces carbonate (CO₃²−) and water, releasing electrons.

Let me look up the standard half-reaction. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I'll try to recall. 

The oxidation of C₂O₄^2- to CO3^2-:

The reaction is:

C₂O₄²⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

But let's balance this in basic conditions.

Step 1: Balance C: 2 on each side, so that's done.

Step 2: Balance O: Left has 4 O, right has 6 O. So, add 2 H2O to the left:

C₂O₄²⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

Step 3: Balance H: On the left, 2 H2O gives 4 H. On the right, no H. So, add 4 H+ to the right, but since it's basic, we can't have H+; instead, we add OH⁻.

Wait, in basic solution, to balance H, we can add OH⁻ to both sides. So, for each H on the right, we can add OH⁻ to the left to balance.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the steps. So, after adding 2 H2O to the left:

C₂O₄²⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

Now, balance H. On the left, 4 H (from 2 H2O). On the right, no H. So, need to add 4 H to the right. But in basic solution, we can't have H+, so we add 4 OH⁻ to the right, which will turn into H2O.

Wait, maybe another approach: when you have H on one side, you can add H2O and OH⁻ accordingly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to balance in acidic solution first, then convert to basic.

So, in acidic solution:

C₂O₄²⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

O: 4 on left, 6 on right. So, add 2 H2O to left.

C₂O₄²⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

Now, H: left has 4 H, right has 0. So, add 4 H+ to the right.

C₂O₄²⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²⁻ + 4 H+ 

Now, charge balance. Left side: C₂O₄²⁻ has charge -2. Right side: 2 CO₃²⁻ is -4, 4 H+ is +4. So total charge on right is (-4 +4) = 0. Left is -2. So, difference is 2 electrons. Since it's oxidation, electrons are on the right.

So, adding 2 electrons to the right:

C₂O₄²⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²⁻ + 4 H+ + 2 e⁻ 

Now, to convert to basic solution, add OH⁻ to both sides to eliminate H+.

We have 4 H+ on the right. So, add 4 OH⁻ to both sides:

C₂O₄²⁻ + 2 H2O + 4 OH⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ + 4 H+ + 4 OH⁻ + 2 e⁻ 

On the right, 4 H+ + 4 OH⁻ → 4 H2O.

So, equation becomes:

C₂O₄²⁻ + 2 H2O + 4 OH⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ + 4 H2O + 2 e⁻ 

Simplify H2O:

Left: 2 H2O + 4 OH⁻ → 2 H2O + 4 OH⁻ (can't combine)
Wait, perhaps subtract H2O from both sides. Let's see:

Left has 2 H2O and 4 OH⁻. Right has 4 H2O.

So, moving 2 H2O from left to right would give:

C₂O₄²⁻ + 4 OH⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ + 2 H2O + 2 e⁻ 

Wait, I think that's correct. So, the balanced oxidation half-reaction in basic solution is:

C₂O₄²⁻ + 4 OH⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ + 2 H2O + 2 e⁻ 

Wait, but in the problem, the reactant is HC₂O₄⁻, which is the conjugate acid of C₂O₄²⁻. So, the initial form is HC₂O₄⁻, which can donate a proton. But since the solution is basic (we have OH⁻), HC₂O₄⁻ will deprotonate to C₂O₄²⁻ + H2O? Or perhaps, I can adjust the half-reaction to account for HC₂O₄⁻.

Wait, HC₂O₄⁻ → C₂O₄²⁻ + H+ ?

But in basic solution, H+ would react with OH⁻ to form H2O. So, perhaps I can proceed with the half-reaction as I have it, considering that HC₂O₄⁻ is deprotonated to C₂O₄²⁻ in the presence of OH⁻.

So, for the oxidation half-reaction, we have:

HC₂O₄⁻ + OH⁻ → C₂O₄²⁻ + H2O 

But then, the oxidation to CO3^2- would proceed as above.

Wait, maybe I can include that step in the overall reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the overall oxidation half-reaction starting from HC₂O₄⁻.

Let me try that.

Starting with HC₂O₄⁻:

HC₂O₄⁻ → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

But I have to balance it in basic solution.

So, O: 4 on left, 6 on right. So, add 2 H2O to left.

HC₂O₄⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²⁻ 

Now, balance H: left has 1 (from HC₂O₄⁻) + 2*2 (from 2 H2O) = 5 H. Right has none. So, add 4 H+ to the right, but since it's basic, I can't have H+, so I'll add OH⁻.

Wait, perhaps I should add 5 H to the right as H2O and OH⁻.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed as before, balancing in acidic first then converting.

In acidic:

HC₂O₄⁻ → 2 CO₂(g) + 2 H+ + 2 e⁻ ?

Wait, no, because in this case, the product is CO₃²−, not CO₂. So, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reduction half-reaction as well. Cl₂ is being reduced to Cl⁻.

Cl₂ is a strong oxidizing agent, so in basic solution, the reduction half-reaction would be:

Cl₂ + 2 e⁻ → 2 Cl⁻ 

Wait, no, in basic solution, the reduction might involve OH⁻. Let me think.

In acidic solution, Cl₂ + 2 e⁻ → 2 Cl⁻ 

But in basic solution, perhaps it's the same, since Cl⁻ is the product regardless.

So, the reduction half-reaction is:

Cl₂ + 2 e⁻ → 2 Cl⁻ 

Now, combining the two half-reactions.

The oxidation half-reaction (from HC₂O₄⁻ to CO₃²−) would produce electrons, and the reduction would consume them.

So, let's find the balanced overall reaction.

First, write the oxidation half-reaction in basic solution.

HC₂O₄⁻ → 2 CO₃²− 

Balancing:

First, balance C: 2 on each side.

O: 4 on left, 6 on right. So, add 2 H2O to left.

HC₂O₄⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²− 

Now, balance H. Left has 1 (from HC₂O₄⁻) + 4 (from 2 H2O) = 5 H. Right has none. So, add 4 H to the right, but in basic solution, we can't have H+, so we add OH⁻.

Wait, perhaps we can add H2O and OH⁻ to balance H.

Wait, maybe I should use the method where I balance O with H2O, H with H+, then convert to OH-.

So, in acidic solution, after adding 2 H2O to the left:

HC₂O₄⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²− 

Now, H: left has 5 H (1 from HC₂O₄⁻ and 4 from 2 H2O). Right has none. So, add 5 H+ to the right.

HC₂O₄⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²− + 5 H+ 

Charge balance: Left side is HC₂O₄⁻ which has a charge of -1. Right side: 2*(-2) = -4 from CO3^2-, and 5 H+ is +5. Total charge on right is +1. So, left is -1, right is +1. So, difference is 2 electrons. Since it's oxidation, electrons are on the right.

So, adding 2 e⁻ to the right:

HC₂O₄⁻ + 2 H2O → 2 CO₃²− +5 H+ +2 e⁻ 

Now, convert to basic solution by adding OH⁻ to both sides to neutralize H+.

We have 5 H+ on the right. So, add 5 OH⁻ to both sides:

HC₂O₄⁻ + 2 H2O +5 OH⁻ → 2 CO₃²− +5 H+ +5 OH⁻ +2 e⁻ 

On the right, 5 H+ +5 OH⁻ → 5 H2O.

So, equation becomes:

HC₂O₄⁻ + 2 H2O +5 OH⁻ → 2 CO₃²− +5 H2O +2 e⁻ 

Simplify H2O: 2 on left, 5 on right. Subtract 2 from both sides:

HC₂O₄⁻ +5 OH⁻ → 2 CO₃²− +3 H2O +2 e⁻ 

So, the oxidation half-reaction is:

HC₂O₄⁻ +5 OH⁻ → 2 CO₃²− +3 H2O +2 e⁻ 

Now, the reduction half-reaction is Cl₂ + 2 e⁻ → 2 Cl⁻ 

To balance electrons, multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 1 and the reduction by 1, since they both have 2 electrons.

So, overall reaction is:

HC₂O₄⁻ +5 OH⁻ + Cl₂ → 2 CO₃²− +3 H2O +2 Cl⁻ 

Wait, let me add the two half-reactions:

Oxidation: HC₂O₄⁻ +5 OH⁻ → 2 CO₃²− +3 H2O +2 e⁻ 

Reduction: Cl₂ +2 e⁻ → 2 Cl⁻ 

Adding them together:

HC₂O₄⁻ +5 OH⁻ + Cl₂ → 2 CO₃²− +3 H2O +2 Cl⁻ 

Now, check the atoms:

C: 2 from HC₂O₄⁻ → 2 in CO3²−. Good.

O: HC₂O₄⁻ has 4 O, 5 OH⁻ has 5 O → total 9 O. Cl₂ has no O. On the right: 2*3=6 O from CO3²−, 3 H2O has 3 O. Total O on right: 6 +3*1=9 O
