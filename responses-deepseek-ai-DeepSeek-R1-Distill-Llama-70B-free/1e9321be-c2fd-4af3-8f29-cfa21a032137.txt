Question:

Today Susan took a pill for her allergy that raised her blood pressure, caused her heart to beat faster, and raised her body temperature. Now caught in traffic, she feels angry. Yesterday, when she took the pill, she was with her husband. When her blood pressure rose, her heart speeded up, she got hotter, and she felt amorous. This description exemplifies

A: two-factor theory
B: Incentive theory
C: Opponent-process theory
D: the adaptation-level phenomenon
E: Cognitive dissonance theory
F: Arousal theory
G: Cannon-Bard theory
H: Cognitive Appraisal theory
I: James-Lange theory
J: Drive-reduction theory

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about Susan who took a pill for her allergy. The pill caused some physiological reactions: raised blood pressure, faster heartbeat, and higher body temperature. Then, depending on the situation she's in, she feels different emotions. Yesterday, she was with her husband and felt amorous. Today, stuck in traffic, she feels angry. The question is asking which theory this exemplifies.

Hmm. So the key here is that the same physiological response leads to different emotional experiences based on the context. That makes me think of theories related to emotion that involve both physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal.

I remember that the two-factor theory, also known as the Schachter-Singer theory, says that emotions result from both physiological arousal and cognitive labeling. So the body gets aroused, and then the brain interprets that arousal based on the situation, leading to the specific emotion.

Looking at the options, option A is two-factor theory. That seems to fit because Susan's arousal (from the pill) is being interpreted differently depending on her environment. When she's with her husband, she labels the arousal as romantic, and when in traffic, as anger.

Other options: Let's think. Incentive theory is about motivation and rewards, so probably not. Opponent-process is about opposing emotions during addiction or over time. Drive-reduction is about reducing needs like hunger. Cannon-Bard and James-Lange are about the order of emotion and physiological response. Cognitive appraisal is part of some theories, like Lazarus's, which also involve appraisal but maybe not the same as two-factor.

Wait, cognitive appraisal theory (option H) suggests that emotions result from how we appraise a situation. But in this case, the same arousal leads to different emotions based on context. So it's more about the combination of arousal and appraisal, which is exactly what two-factor theory says.

So the answer should be A: two-factor theory.

The scenario describes Susan experiencing the same physiological responses—raised blood pressure, faster heartbeat, and higher body temperature—leading to different emotional experiences (amorous when with her husband and angry in traffic) based on the context. This aligns with the two-factor theory (Schachter-Singer theory), which posits that emotions arise from a combination of physiological arousal and cognitive labeling. The physiological arousal is the same in both situations, but the emotional interpretation differs depending on the context.

Other options like cognitive appraisal theory (H) focus on how situations are appraised but don’t emphasize the combination of arousal and labeling as two-factor theory does. Therefore, the best answer is:

A: two-factor theory.
