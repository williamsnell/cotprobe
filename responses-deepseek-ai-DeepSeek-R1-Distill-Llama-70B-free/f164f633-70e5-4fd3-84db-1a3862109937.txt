Okay, so I've got this math problem here about linear functions. Hmm, let me think. The question says that f is a linear function with a nonzero slope, and c is less than d. I need to figure out which of the options must be false.

Wait, linear function with nonzero slope. Right, a linear function is like f(x) = mx + b, where m is the slope. Since the slope is nonzero, m is not zero. So, the function is either increasing or decreasing.

The problem gives me that c < d. So, c comes before d on the number line. Now, I need to see what happens when I plug these into the function f.

If the slope is positive, then as x increases, f(x) increases. So, if c < d, then f(c) would be less than f(d). That would mean f(d) is greater than f(c). So in that case, options A and B would be true because A says f(d) > f(c) and B says f(c) < f(d). 

But wait, if the slope is negative, the function is decreasing. So when x increases, f(x) decreases. So then f(c) would be greater than f(d) because c < d. So in that scenario, f(d) is less than f(c). So option A would be false and option G would be true.

The question is asking which option must be false. So let's look at the options:

Option A: f(d) > f(c) — this is true if the slope is positive, but false if the slope is negative. So it's not necessarily always true. So it's not necessarily false either because it depends on the slope.

Option B: f(c) < f(d) — same as A, just flipped. So if the slope is positive, this is true. If slope is negative, it's false. So B can be false.

Option C: f(d) ≠ f(c) — since the function has a nonzero slope, it's either increasing or decreasing. So f(d) can't equal f(c) because c ≠ d (since c < d). Wait, because if the slope is zero, which isn't the case here, then f would be constant. But since slope is non-zero, f(d) must be different from f(c). So C is always true. So C is not the false one.

Option D: f(c) = f(d) — wait, as I just thought, since the slope is non-zero, f can't be flat. So f(c) can't equal f(d) if c ≠ d. Since c < d, c is not equal to d. So D must be false. Because the function is linear with non-zero slope, so it's one-to-one; each x gives a unique f(x). So D is false. But wait, let me make sure.

Option E: f(d) < f(c) — this would be true if the slope is negative. So it's not always false; it depends. So E is not necessarily false.

Option F: f(c) ≠ f(d) — same as C, because F is the same as C but with variables swapped. So F is always true because c≠d and slope isn't zero, so F is true. So F is not the false one.

Option G: f(c) > f(d) — this is true when the slope is negative. So G can be true or false depending on the slope.

Wait, the question is which must be FALSE. So looking at each option:

Option D says f(c) equals f(d). But since f is linear with a non-zero slope, and c≠d, f(c) can't equal f(d). So D is definitely false. Because if the slope is non-zero, the function is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. So for any two different x's, their outputs are different.

So the question is, which option must be false. So D must be false. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check:

The options are A through G, but the user presented them as A to G, including D and others.

So the question is asking which must be false. So D is f(c)=f(d), which must be false because the function has a non-zero slope, so it can't have the same value at two different points.

But wait, let me read the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: f(d) > f(c)
B: f(c) < f(d)
C: f(d) ≠ f(c)
D: f(c) = f(d)
E: f(d) < f(c)
F: f(c) ≠ f(d)
G: f(c) > f(d)

So D says f(c) equals f(d). Since c < d and f is linear with non-zero slope, this can't be true. So D is always false. So the answer should be D.

To determine which statement must be false, we analyze the properties of the linear function \( f \) with a nonzero slope. A linear function can be expressed as \( f(x) = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope. Since the slope is nonzero, the function is either strictly increasing (\( m > 0 \)) or strictly decreasing (\( m < 0 \)).

Given \( c < d \), we evaluate each option:

- **Option A: \( f(d) > f(c) \)**  
  This is true if the slope is positive (\( m > 0 \)) because the function is increasing. However, it is false if the slope is negative (\( m < 0 \)) because the function is decreasing. Thus, this statement is not necessarily false.

- **Option B: \( f(c) < f(d) \)**  
  This is true if the slope is positive (\( m > 0 \)) because the function is increasing. However, it is false if the slope is negative (\( m < 0 \)) because the function is decreasing. Thus, this statement is not necessarily false.

- **Option C: \( f(d) \neq f(c) \)**  
  Since the slope is nonzero, the function is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Therefore, \( f(d) \) cannot equal \( f(c) \) when \( c \neq d \). This statement is always true and not false.

- **Option D: \( f(c) = f(d) \)**  
  This statement claims that the function has the same value at two different points \( c \) and \( d \). However, since the slope is nonzero, the function is strictly monotonic (either increasing or decreasing), and \( f(c) \neq f(d) \) whenever \( c \neq d \). Thus, this statement is always false.

- **Option E: \( f(d) < f(c) \)**  
  This is true if the slope is negative (\( m < 0 \)) because the function is decreasing. However, it is false if the slope is positive (\( m > 0 \)) because the function is increasing. Thus, this statement is not necessarily false.

- **Option F: \( f(c) \neq f(d) \)**  
  This is equivalent to Option C. Since the slope is nonzero, \( f(c) \neq f(d) \) whenever \( c \neq d \). This statement is always true and not false.

- **Option G: \( f(c) > f(d) \)**  
  This is true if the slope is negative (\( m < 0 \)) because the function is decreasing. However, it is false if the slope is positive (\( m > 0 \)) because the function is increasing. Thus, this statement is not necessarily false.

The only statement that must be false under all conditions is **Option D**, as a linear function with a nonzero slope cannot have the same value at two distinct points \( c \) and \( d \).
