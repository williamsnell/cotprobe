Question:

"Top gun" pilots have long worried about taking a turn too tightly. As a pilot's body undergoes centripetal acceleration, with the head toward the center of curvature, the blood pressure in the brain decreases, leading to loss of brain function.
There are several warning signs. When the centripetal acceleration is $2 g$ or $3 g$, the pilot feels heavy. At about $4 g$, the pilot's vision switches to black and white and narrows to "tunnel vision." If that acceleration is sustained or increased, vision ceases and, soon after, the pilot is unconscious - a condition known as $g$-LOC for " $g$-induced loss of consciousness."

What is the magnitude of the acceleration, in $g$ units, of a pilot whose aircraft enters a horizontal circular turn with a velocity of $\vec{v}_i=(400 \hat{\mathrm{i}}+500 \hat{\mathrm{j}}) \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $24.0 \mathrm{~s}$ later leaves the turn with a velocity of $\vec{v}_f=(-400 \hat{\mathrm{i}}-500 \hat{\mathrm{j}}) \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ ?

Options:

A: 95.67 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
B: 62.48 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
C: 83.81 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
D: 72.14 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
E: 110.87 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
F: 75.19 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
G: 100.56 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
H: 55.92 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
I: 90.43 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
J: 68.25 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$

Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a pilot experiencing g-forces during a tight turn. The problem gives the initial and final velocities as vectors, and the time taken to change direction. I need to find the magnitude of the acceleration in terms of g's.

Hmm, so the initial velocity is vi = (400i + 500j) m/s, and after 24 seconds, the final velocity is vf = (-400i -500j) m/s. I think I need to find the acceleration first, then convert it into g's.

Wait, acceleration is the change in velocity over time. Oh right, a = (vf - vi)/Δt. Since the time given is 24 seconds, that makes sense.

Let me compute the change in velocity. So, the change in i component is (-400 - 400) = -800 m/s. And the change in j component is (-500 - 500) = -1000 m/s. So the delta v vector is (-800i -1000j) m/s.

Then, acceleration a is delta v divided by 24 s. So a_i = -800 /24 = -33.333..., and a_j = -1000 /24 ≈ -41.6667 m/s².

Wait, but the question asks for the magnitude of the acceleration, so I need to find the magnitude of the a vector.

The magnitude of a would be sqrt( (-33.333)^2 + (-41.6667)^2 ). Let me compute each part.

First, 33.333 squared is approximately (100/3)^2 = 10000/9 ≈ 1111.11. Similarly, 41.6667 is 125/3, so (125/3)^2 = 15625/9 ≈ 1736.11.

Adding those gives 1111.11 + 1736.11 = 2847.22. The square root of that is sqrt(2847.22). Let me think, 53 squared is 2809, and 54 squared is 2916. So sqrt(2847.22) is about 53.35 m/s².

Wait, wait, but the question is in terms of g. Oh right, because the options are given in m/s², but the question asks for the magnitude in g units. Or wait, no, the question says, what is the magnitude of acceleration in g units? Hmm, no, looking back: the question says, "what is the magnitude of the acceleration, in g units".

Wait, no, looking again: the question states, "what is the magnitude of the acceleration, in g units, of a pilot..." So I think I need to express the acceleration in terms of g, where g is 9.8 m/s².

So the acceleration I found is approximately 53.35 m/s². To convert that to g's, divide by 9.8.

So 53.35 /9.8 ≈ 5.44 g's. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 5.44 as an option. The options are A to J, and looking at them, the values are all around 55 to 110 m/s², which when converted to g's would be like 5.6 to 11.2 g's.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, the initial and final velocities are given, and the time. So the change in velocity is (vf - vi) which is (-400 -400, -500-500) = (-800, -1000) as I had before.

So yes, delta v is (-800, -1000) m/s.

Then acceleration is delta v over 24 s.

So a_x = -800 /24 = -33.333 m/s².

a_y = -1000 /24 ≈ -41.6667 m/s².

The magnitude is sqrt( (33.333)^2 + (41.6667)^2 )

Let me compute 33.333 squared: 33.333 *33.333. 33^2 is 1089. 0.333^2 is about 0.111. The cross term is 2*33*0.333 = 21.978. So total is approximately (33.333)^2 ≈ 1111.0889.

Similarly, 41.6667 squared: 40^2 is 1600, 1.6667^2 is approximately 2.7778. The cross term is 2*40*1.6667 ≈ 133.333. So 40+1.6667=41.6667. So squared is (40^2) + 2*(40)*(1.6667) + (1.6667)^2 = 1600 + 133.333 + 2.7778 = approx 1736.11.

Adding 1111.0889 + 1736.11 = 2847.2.

Square root of 2847.2: Let's see. 50^2 is 2500. 53^2 is 2809. 54^2 is 2916. So sqrt(2847.2) is between 53 and 54.

Compute 53 *53=2809. 2847.2 - 2809 = 38.2. So 53 + (38.2)/(2*53) ) = 53 + 38.2/106 ≈ 53 + 0.36 = 53.36 m/s².

So that's about 53.36 m/s². Now, convert to g's: divide by 9.8.

53.36 /9.8 ≈ 5.44 g's.

Wait, but the options don't have 5.44. Let me look at the options again.

Options are A:95.67, B:62.48, C:83.81, D:72.14, E:110.87, F:75.19, G:100.56, H:55.92, I:90.43, J:68.25.

Wait, these are all in m/s², not g's. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's requirement. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "What is the magnitude of the acceleration, in g units, of a pilot..." So wait, does it mean to express the acceleration in terms of g, like 5.44 g's, as I thought? But the options are all in m/s². Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude in m/s², but the options are presented in m/s². Because in the first part, the question introduces the concept of g's, but the actual question is phrased a bit ambiguously.

Wait, the question's exact wording: "What is the magnitude of the acceleration, in g units, of a pilot whose aircraft..." So "g units" probably means to express the acceleration as a multiple of g. So 5.44 g's, but the options are all in m/s², so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the acceleration. Maybe the time is 24 seconds, which is a relatively long time, so the acceleration isn't as high as I thought.

Wait, let me re-express the problem: The initial velocity is (400,500), and the final is (-400,-500). So the change in velocity is (-800, -1000). The time is 24 seconds.

So the acceleration is (-800/24, -1000/24) = (-33.333, -41.6667) m/s².

The magnitude is sqrt( (33.333)^2 + (41.6667)^2 ) = sqrt(1111.11 + 1736.11) = sqrt(2847.22) ≈ 53.36 m/s².

So that's about 53.36 m/s². Now, to express this in g's, divide by 9.8, which gives about 5.44 g's.

But the options don't have 53.36 m/s². Let me look at the options again. Option J is 68.25, which is higher. Option H is 55.92, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of delta v. Let me double-check.

Wait, initial velocity vi is 400i +500j.

Final velocity vf is -400i -500j.

So delta v is vf - vi = (-400-400, -500-500) = (-800, -1000). Yes, that's correct.

Time is 24 seconds. So a = (-800/24, -1000/24) = (-33.333..., -41.666...) m/s².

Yes, that's correct.

So the magnitude is about 53.36 m/s². But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question asks for the magnitude in g units, which would be 5.44 g's. So 1 g is 9.8 m/s². So the options are in m/s², but the question says "in g units." So perhaps the answer is supposed to be in g's, but the options are in m/s². That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the options are in m/s², but the question expects the answer in g's. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the acceleration. Let me try another approach. Maybe the velocity change isn't just from vi to vf, but considering the direction.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors and find the acceleration properly. Let me compute the vectors again.

vi = 400i +500j.

vf = -400i -500j.

So delta v = vf - vi = (-400 -400)i + (-500 -500)j = -800i -1000j m/s.

Yes, correct.

So a = delta v / delta t = (-800/24, -1000/24) = (-33.333..., -41.666...) m/s².

The magnitude is sqrt( (33.333)^2 + (41.6667)^2 ) = sqrt(1111.11 + 1736.11) = sqrt(2847.22) ≈ 53.36 m/s².

Yes, same as before.

Then, 53.36 m/s² divided by 9.8 m/s²/g is approximately 5.44 g's.

Looking at the options, none of them match 5.44 g's. The options are all in the 50-110 m/s² range, which would correspond to 5 to 11 g's.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the magnitude of acceleration. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 33.333^2 = (100/3)^2 = 10000/9 ≈ 1111.1111.

41.6667^2 = (125/3)^2 = 15625/9 ≈ 1736.1111.

Adding them: 1111.1111 + 1736.1111 = 2847.2222.

The square root of 2847.2222.

Let me calculate sqrt(2847.2222).

I know that 53^2 = 2809.

53.36^2 = ?

Wait, let me calculate 53.36 *53.36.

53 *53 = 2809.

Now, 0.36^2 = 0.1296.

Cross terms: 2*(53)*(0.36) = 38.16.

So 53.36^2 = (53 + 0.36)^2 = 53^2 + 2*53*0.36 + 0.36^2 = 2809 + 38.16 + 0.1296 = 2809 + 38.2896 = 2847.2896. Which is very close to 2847.2222.

So sqrt(2847.2222) is approximately 53.36 m/s².

So the acceleration is 53.36 m/s², which is 53.36 /9.8 ≈ 5.44 g's.

But the options are all in m/s², so perhaps the question is asking for the acceleration in m/s². But the question says, "magnitude of the acceleration, in g units." So maybe it's a mistake, and the intended answer is 53.36 m/s², but that's not among the options either.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the delta v. Let me double-check.

Wait, initial velocity is (400i +500j). After 24 seconds, the velocity is (-400i -500j). So the change in velocity is (-400 -400, -500 -500) = (-800, -1000). That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the time is 24.0 seconds, so the calculation is correct. So the acceleration is 53.36 m/s², which is 5.44 g's.

But looking back at the options, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the question is referring to centripetal acceleration, and I need to compute that differently.

Wait, centripetal acceleration is a_c = v² / r, but that's when moving in a circle. However, in this problem, we're given initial and final velocities, which suggests that the plane is changing direction, so it's undergoing some acceleration.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the plane is moving in a circular path, and we're to find the centripetal acceleration.

But wait, the initial and final velocities are given as vectors. If the plane is making a turn, the velocity changes direction, implying that the acceleration is centripetal. So perhaps I should compute the average velocity and find the radius, then compute the centripetal acceleration.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the acceleration is the average acceleration over the 24 seconds.

Wait, in my initial approach, I computed the average acceleration as (vf - vi)/Δt, which is correct for average acceleration. But perhaps the question is considering the instantaneous acceleration, but given the data, I think average is the way to go.

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose the plane is moving in a circular path with a radius r. The initial velocity is vi, and after time Δt, the velocity is vf. Since the turn is circular, the magnitude of velocity should remain constant if the speed isn't changing, but in this case, vi and vf have the same magnitude because vi is 400i +500j, so |vi|=sqrt(400² +500²)=sqrt(160000+250000)=sqrt(410000)= about 640.3128 m/s. Similarly, vf is -400i -500j, same magnitude. So speed is constant, implying that the acceleration is centripetal.

Wait, but then the acceleration is directed toward the center of the circle, and its magnitude is v² / r. However, in this problem, since the initial and final velocities are given, perhaps we can find the radius of the turn and then compute the centripetal acceleration.

But wait, the time given is 24 seconds. So the plane changes direction from vi to vf in 24 seconds, but if the speed is constant, the turn is a part of a circle, and the angle covered in that time can be found.

Wait, perhaps I can find the angular displacement and then find the radius, which would allow me to compute the centripetal acceleration.

Hmm, but this approach might be more complicated, and I'm not sure if it's necessary. Let's see.

Alternatively, the initial and final velocities are each other's negatives, which suggests that the plane has turned 180 degrees, i.e., made a half-circle. But wait, in 24 seconds, is that possible?

Wait, the angle between vi and vf can be found using the dot product. The dot product of vi and vf is (400)(-400) + (500)(-500) = (-160000) + (-250000) = -410000.

The magnitudes of vi and vf are both sqrt(400² +500²) = sqrt(410000) ≈ 640.3128 m/s.

So the cosine of the angle θ between them is (dot product) / (|vi| |vf|) ) = (-410000)/(640.3128²) ) = (-410000)/(410000) )= -1.

So the angle is 180 degrees, meaning the plane has made a 180-degree turn, i.e., a half-circle, in 24 seconds.

So the period T for a full circle would be 48 seconds, since 24 seconds is half a period.

The centripetal acceleration is v² / r.

But I can also relate the period T to the radius. For circular motion, T = 2πr / v.

So solving for r, r = v T / (2π).

But wait, T is the period for a full circle, which is 48 seconds.

So r = (640.3128 m/s * 48 s) / (2π) = (640.3128 *48) / (6.2832) ≈ (30750) / 6.2832 ≈ 4896.3 meters.

Then, centripetal acceleration is a_c = v² / r = (640.3128)^2 / 4896.3.

Compute 640.3128 squared: approximately 410,000 (since 640^2 = 409,600, and 0.3128^2 is negligible). So 410,000 / 4896.3 ≈ 83.7 m/s².

Wait, that's about 83.7 m/s². Looking at the options, option C is 83.81 m/s², which is very close. So that would be the answer.

But wait, earlier I calculated using average acceleration and got 53.36 m/s², which isn't an option. But using the centripetal acceleration approach, I get approximately 83.7 m/s², which matches option C.

So perhaps the correct approach is to treat this as circular motion with a 180-degree turn, compute the radius, and then find the centripetal acceleration.

Wait, but why the discrepancy between the two methods? The average acceleration approach gives 53 m/s², while the centripetal approach gives 83.7 m/s².

Hmm, I think the issue is that average acceleration is different from centripetal acceleration. The average acceleration is the change in velocity over time, which includes both the change in direction and magnitude. But in this case, the magnitude of velocity is constant, so the average acceleration is perpendicular to the velocity, similar to centripetal acceleration, but the magnitude might differ.

Wait, but in circular
