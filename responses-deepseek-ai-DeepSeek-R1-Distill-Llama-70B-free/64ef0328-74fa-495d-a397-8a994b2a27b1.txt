Question:

A man was arrested and charged with robbery. Upon being taken into custody, he was given his Miranda rights and then taken to the police station for booking. At the stationhouse, the man told a police officer that he was prepared to make a confession. The police officer then turned on a video recorder and videotaped the man's confession. At trial, the prosecution called the police officer to testify to the incriminating statements that the man made in his confession. Upon objection by the man's attorney, the police officer's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the police officer's testimony would be considered prejudiced.
B: admissible, because the man confessed voluntarily.
C: admissible, because the man was given his Miranda rights before the confession was elicited.
D: admissible, because the man was aware of his rights when he confessed.
E: inadmissible, because the man was not given an attorney during the confession.
F: inadmissible, because the videotape is the best evidence of the man's confession.
G: admissible, because the confession was videotaped.
H: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
I: admissible, because the police officer had firsthand knowledge of the confession.
J: inadmissible, because the man was under duress during the confession.

Okay, so I have this question about criminal procedure and evidence law. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about whether a police officer's testimony regarding a defendant's confession is admissible at trial. 

Alright, the scenario: a man is arrested for robbery, given Miranda rights, and then taken to the police station. At the station, he tells a police officer he's ready to make a confession. The officer videotapes it. At trial, the prosecution wants the officer to testify about the man's incriminating statements. The defense objects, and we need to decide if that testimony is admissible.

I remember that Miranda rights are crucial here. Miranda v. Arizona established that statements made under custodial interrogation without Miranda warnings are inadmissible. But in this case, the man was given his Miranda rights before being taken to the station. So that part is covered.

Wait, but the issue isn't about the admissibility of the confession itself, but the officer's testimony about it. So the question is about whether the officer can testify to the statements made by the defendant.

I think about the hearsay rule. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the officer's testimony about what the defendant said would be hearsay unless an exception applies.

What exceptions apply here? Confessions are an exception under FRE 801(d)(2), which considers a defendant's statement as non-hearsay if it's offered against the defendant. Wait, no, 801(d)(2) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's own statement. So the defendant's own confession would fall under this exception.

But wait, the officer is testifying about the defendant's statement. So the statement is the defendant's own words, so it's an admission by a party-opponent, which is non-hearsay under 801(d)(2)(A). So the officer's testimony about the confession would be admissible as non-hearsay.

Alternatively, maybe the prosecution could also use it under the exception for custodial confessions, but I think the key point is that it's a party admission.

Wait, but the options don't directly mention this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C says admissible because Miranda rights were given. Well, that's important for the voluntariness, but the question is about the admissibility of the officer's testimony, which is about hearsay. So giving Miranda rights makes the statement admissible as voluntary, but the testimony's admissibility depends on hearsay.

Option I says admissible because the officer had firsthand knowledge. That's about the officer's basis for testifying, not the hearsay issue. The officer can testify as to what they heard, but if it's hearsay, then it's inadmissible unless an exception applies.

Option H says inadmissible because it's hearsay without exception. But wait, is it hearsay? Because the defendant's own statement is an admission, so it's not hearsay. So H would be incorrect.

Option B says admissible because the confession was voluntary. But the voluntariness goes to the confession's admissibility, not the officer's testimony. So B might not be the best answer.

Option C and D relate to Miranda and awareness of rights. But again, those affect the confession's admissibility, not the hearsay issue.

Option F says inadmissible because the videotape is best evidence. The best evidence rule requires the original if the content is in question. But here, the officer is testifying about what was said, not about the contents of the videotape. So if the prosecution is offering the officer's testimony, the best evidence rule doesn't apply unless they're trying to prove the content of the recording. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G says admissible because it's videotaped. The fact that it's recorded doesn't directly affect the admissibility of the officer's testimony; it's more about the evidence's reliability. So G might not be the right reason.

Options A, E, and J talk about prejudice, attorney presence, and duress. The scenario doesn't mention any issues with duress or attorney presence beyond Miranda. So those might not apply.

Putting it all together: The officer's testimony about the defendant's confession is admissible because it's a party admission, not hearsay. So the correct answer should be that the testimony is admissible.

Wait, looking back, the options. Option I says admissible because the officer had firsthand knowledge. That's a basis for testimony, but not addressing hearsay. So the better reason is that it's a party admission. But the options don't explicitly state that. Let's see the options again.

Option B: admissible because voluntary. Well, that's about the confession being admissible, not the hearsay exception. But the officer's testimony about the statement would still be hearsay unless it's a party admission. So perhaps the correct answer is that it's admissible because it's a party admission, but none of the options say that. Alternatively, maybe the answer hinges on Miranda and voluntariness, but I think the key is the hearsay exception.

Wait, option C says admissible because Miranda rights were given. That's more about the confession being voluntary, but the testimony could still be hearsay. So perhaps the correct answer is that the testimony is inadmissible as hearsay unless an exception applies. But since the defendant made the statement, it's a party admission, so it's not hearsay. Therefore, the officer can testify.

Looking at the options, I think the correct answer is C, but wait, noâ€”option C is about Miranda, but that's not directly about hearsay. Alternatively, option I is about firsthand knowledge, which is a factor, but not the hearsay issue.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the testimony is admissible because the statement is a party admission, making it non-hearsay. But none of the options explicitly say that. Let me check the options again.

Option I: admissible because the officer had firsthand knowledge. That addresses the officer's competence to testify but not the hearsay issue. So the testimony is admissible because it's a party admission (non-hearsay), but the options don't state that. The closest is option B, but B is about voluntariness.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the defendant's own statement is admissible as a party admission, so the officer can testify about it. So the correct answer is that the testimony is admissible, making options B, C, D, G, I as possible.

Alternatively, another angle: Miranda warnings make the confession admissible, but the question is about the admissibility of the officer's testimony, which is about hearsay. So the officer's testimony is admissible because the statement is a party admission, thus not hearsay. So the correct answer would be that the testimony is admissible, and the reason is that it's a party admission. But looking at the options, none directly say that. 

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the officer's testimony is hearsay, but covered under the exception for present sense impressions or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's not hearsay because it's the defendant's own statement.

Wait, under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against the defendant and is their own statement. So the officer testifying about the defendant's statement is admissible as non-hearsay.

But looking at the options, the only one that relates to this is option I, but that's about firsthand knowledge, not the hearsay exception. So perhaps the correct answer is that the testimony is admissible because it's a party admission, but none of the options directly state that.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me re-examine them:

Option C: admissible because Miranda was given. That ensures the confession is voluntary, but doesn't directly address hearsay.

Option I: admissible because officer had firsthand knowledge. That's about the officer's basis for testimony, but not the hearsay issue.

Option B: admissible because voluntary. Again, that's about the confession's admissibility, not the hearsay.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C or B. But I'm a bit confused because the key issue is hearsay. So if the statement is a party admission, the testimony is admissible. But if none of the options state that, perhaps the closest is option C.

Wait, no. Let's think differently. If the defendant made the statement, it's an admission, so the officer can testify without it being hearsay. Therefore, the testimony is admissible. Among the options, which one supports this?

Looking back, the options don't explicitly mention the admission exception. So perhaps the correct answer is that the testimony is admissible because the defendant was given Miranda rights, making the statement admissible, but that's more about voluntariness than hearsay.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the testimony is inadmissible because it's hearsay. But that can't be right because the statement is an admission.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline:

- The defendant's confession is a statement by the defendant, so under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), it's not hearsay.

- Therefore, the police officer can testify about the statement because it's non-hearsay.

So the testimony is admissible. Among the options, the correct reason is that it's a party admission, but the options don't have that. So the next best is perhaps option C, but that's about Miranda.

Wait, maybe option C is correct because giving Miranda rights makes the confession admissible, but that's about the confession's voluntariness, not the hearsay rule. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but that's about the officer's knowledge, not the hearsay exception.

Hmm, maybe I should think about what each option is saying. Option H says inadmissible because it's hearsay without exception. But since it's a party admission, it's not hearsay, so H would be incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is that the testimony is admissible, so options B, C, D, G, I are possible. Now, considering that the best reason is that it's a party admission, but that's not an option, the next best is that the confession was voluntary, making the testimony admissible. So option B says admissible because voluntary. But does that address hearsay? Or is it about the confession's admissibility?

Wait, no. The voluntariness affects whether the confession can be used, but the officer's testimony about the confession would still be hearsay unless it's a party admission. So perhaps the correct answer is that the testimony is admissible because it's a party admission, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is option C, assuming that Miranda rights were given, making the confession admissible, but that's more about the confession's admissibility, not the hearsay.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the key is that the defendant's own statement is admissible as a party admission, so the officer's testimony is not hearsay. Therefore, the testimony is admissible. Among the options, the correct one would be that it's admissible because it's a party admission, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the best evidence rule. Option F says inadmissible because the videotape is best evidence. But best evidence applies when the content of the recording is at issue. Here, the prosecution is offering the officer's testimony, not the video. So F is incorrect.

Alternatively, if the video is played, then best evidence wouldn't bar the officer's testimony about what was said. So F is not the reason.

I think I've circled back. The testimony is admissible because it's a party admission, making it non-hearsay. So the correct answer should be that it's admissible, and the reason is that it's a party admission. But looking at the options, none state that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps option C is the correct answer. Because Miranda was given, so the confession is admissible, and the officer can testify about it. But wait, that's about the confession being admissible, not the hearsay issue. So I'm a bit torn.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, because the officer has firsthand knowledge, but that's about the foundation for testimony, not hearsay.

Wait, maybe the answer is option H: inadmissible because it's hearsay without exception. But that's incorrect because the statement is a party admission.

So the correct answer must be that the testimony is admissible, so options B, C, D, G, I.

Among these, the best fit is option C: admissible because Miranda rights were given. So the answer would be C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a police officer's testimony regarding a defendant's confession, with the key issue being whether the testimony is inadmissible as hearsay. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, a defendant's own statement is not considered hearsay under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), as it qualifies as a party admission. This means the officer's testimony about the defendant's confession is admissible because it is non-hearsay.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not inadmissible simply because the officer might be prejudiced. Prejudice is not the issue here.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the voluntariness of the confession is important for its admissibility, this option does not address the hearsay issue, which is the central concern.
- **Option C**: Correct. Although this option emphasizes Miranda rights, giving Miranda warnings ensures the confession is voluntary and admissible. While it does not explicitly address the hearsay exception, it is the most relevant option supporting the admissibility of the testimony.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Awareness of rights is important but does not directly address the hearsay issue.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The absence of an attorney during the confession is not the issue here, as Miranda rights were given.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The best evidence rule applies when the content of a recording is at issue, but here the officer is testifying about what they heard, so this rule does not bar the testimony.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The fact that the confession was videotaped does not directly affect the admissibility of the officer's testimony.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The testimony is not inadmissible as hearsay because the defendant's own statement qualifies as a party admission under FRE 801(d)(2)(A).
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While the officer having firsthand knowledge is a valid basis for testifying, this option does not address the hearsay issue.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. There is no indication in the scenario that the confession was made under duress.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it aligns most closely with the admissibility of the testimony, even though it does not explicitly address the hearsay exception. The testimony is admissible because the defendant's confession is a party admission, and Miranda rights were given, ensuring the confession's voluntariness.
