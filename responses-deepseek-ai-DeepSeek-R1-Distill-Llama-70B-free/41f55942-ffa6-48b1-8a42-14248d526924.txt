Okay, so I have this question about CSMA/CD networks and frame sizes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in a CSMA/CD network with a data rate of 10 Mbps, the minimum frame size is 512 bits. Now they increased the data rate to 1 Gbps and are asking what the new minimum frame size should be. The options are A through J with various bit values.

Wait, I remember that the minimum frame size in CSMA/CD is related to collision detection. Oh right, it's about the time it takes for a collision to be detected. The idea is that a frame must be long enough so that by the time a collision occurs, all nodes can detect it and back off properly.

I think the key here is the relationship between the data rate and the minimum frame size. The formula I remember is that the minimum frame size (in bits) is equal to the round-trip propagation delay multiplied by the data rate. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? Let me think. Oh wait, wait. The minimum frame size must be such that the time to transmit it is at least equal to the time it takes for a signal to travel the entire network and back (the round-trip time). 

So the formula must be something like: Minimum Frame Size (bits) = (2 * propagation delay * data rate) bits. Because data rate is bits per second, and propagation delay is in seconds, so multiplying them gives bits.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. The propagation delay is the time it takes for a signal to go from one end to the other and back. So if the physical medium has a certain length, the time is determined by the speed of light in the medium (like the speed of electrical signals in a cable). But in this problem, the propagation delay isn't given, but the initial data rate and frame size are given, so I can find the propagation delay from that, and then apply it to the new data rate.

Oh right, that makes sense. So first, calculate the propagation delay based on the initial data rate and frame size. Then use that delay to find the minimum frame size at the higher data rate.

So in the original setup: Data rate (D1) = 10 Mbps = 10^7 bits per second. Minimum frame size (F1) = 512 bits.

The time to transmit this frame is F1 / D1. That's 512 / (10^7) seconds. Let me compute that. 512 / 10^7 = 5.12e-5 seconds, which is 51.2 microseconds. Wait, wait, but that's the time to transmit one frame. But for the collision detection, this time has to be at least equal to the round-trip propagation delay (let's call it T). So T is the time for a signal to go from one end to another and back.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, the minimum frame size must ensure that when a collision happens, the transmitting stations can detect it. The worst case is when two stations at opposite ends of the network transmit at the same time. So the signals will collide somewhere in the middle. The first station stops transmitting when it detects the collision, but the second station may not stop immediately because the collision signal takes time to reach them.

So the minimum frame time (the time to transmit the minimum frame) must be at least twice the maximum propagation delay between any two stations. Because if the frame is too short, by the time the collision happens, the transmitting stations might have already finished sending the frame and wouldn't detect the collision.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's clarify. The maximum time for a collision to be detected is twice the maximum propagation delay (the time for a signal to go from one end to the other and back). So the minimum frame time (F/D) must be at least equal to 2 * T, where T is the maximum one-way propagation delay.

So in the initial case, F1/D1 = 2*T. Then when the data rate increases, the new F2/D2 must equal the same 2*T. So we can find T from the initial condition and then compute F2.

Let me write this down:

F1 / D1 = 2*T
F2 / D2 = 2*T

So F1/D1 = F2/D2 â†’ F2 = F1 * (D2/D1)

Because both equal 2*T. So F2 = F1 * (D2 / D1)

That makes sense. Because when the data rate increases, the minimum frame size must increase proportionally to maintain the same time for collision detection.

So in the problem, D2 is 1 Gbps, which is 10^9 bps. D1 is 10 Mbps, which is 10^7 bps.

So F2 = 512 * (1e9 / 1e7) = 512 * 100 = 51200 bits.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 1e9 / 1e7 is 100. So 512 * 100 is 51,200 bits.

Looking at the options, option E is 51200. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me think of it another way. If the data rate is higher, each bit takes less time to transmit. So to have the same time (twice the propagation delay), you need more bits. So F2 is bigger than F1, which makes sense because 51200 is larger than 512.

So the answer should be E: 51200.

In a CSMA/CD network, the minimum frame size is determined by the requirement that the time to transmit a frame must be at least equal to twice the maximum propagation delay (round-trip time) to ensure proper collision detection. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{F}{D} = 2T
\]

where \( F \) is the frame size (in bits), \( D \) is the data rate (in bits per second), and \( T \) is the round-trip propagation delay (in seconds).

### Step 1: Extract the propagation delay from the initial setup
In the initial setup:
- \( D_1 = 10 \, \text{Mbps} = 10^7 \, \text{bits/second} \)
- \( F_1 = 512 \, \text{bits} \)

Using the formula:
\[
\frac{F_1}{D_1} = 2T \implies T = \frac{F_1}{2D_1}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
T = \frac{512}{2 \times 10^7} = \frac{512}{2 \times 10^7} = 2.56 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{seconds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the new minimum frame size at the higher data rate
In the new setup:
- \( D_2 = 1 \, \text{Gbps} = 10^9 \, \text{bits/second} \)

Using the same formula:
\[
\frac{F_2}{D_2} = 2T \implies F_2 = 2T \cdot D_2
\]

Substituting \( T = 2.56 \times 10^{-5} \) and \( D_2 = 10^9 \):
\[
F_2 = 2 \cdot (2.56 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 10^9 = 51200 \, \text{bits}
\]

### Step 3: Verify the result
The calculated minimum frame size at the higher data rate is \( 51200 \, \text{bits} \), which matches option \( E \). This ensures that the collision detection process works correctly even at the increased data rate.
