Question:

Discuss cognitive development during adolescence as describedby Piaget.

Options:

A: The stage of formal operations begins at about the age of 11 when the child begins to think abstractly, hypothetically, and idealistically.
B: Cognitive development peaks in early adolescence and declines thereafter.
C: Cognitive development during adolescence is marked by a return to sensory-motor thinking.
D: Cognitive development begins in adolescence.
E: Cognitive development ends with the stage of formal operations.
F: Adolescents revert to egocentric thinking patterns that are typical of early childhood.
G: The stage of formal operations is only reached by a minority of individuals, with most never advancing beyond concrete operations.
H: The stage of formal operations is achieved by all individuals by the age of 8.
I: Cognitive development is characterized by the ability to deal with concrete situations.
J: Adolescents primarily focus on developing practical skills rather than abstract thinking.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Piaget's theory of cognitive development, specifically during adolescence. Hmm, I remember that Piaget proposed several stages of cognitive development. Let me try to recall what each stage entails.

From what I learned, Piaget's stages are: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Each stage builds on the previous one, and each has distinct characteristics.

The sensorimotor stage is from birth to about 2 years old, where children learn by using their senses and motor activities. Then comes the preoperational stage, around 2-7 years, where they start using symbols and language but are egocentric. Next is the concrete operational stage, roughly 7-11 years old, where children develop logical thinking but only with practical aids. 

The formal operational stage is the last one, starting around adolescence, which is about 11 years old and beyond. At this stage, adolescents develop the ability to think abstractly, reason logically, and consider possibilities. They can handle hypothetical situations and think about abstract concepts, like ideals and moral principles.

Now, looking at the question, it's about cognitive development in adolescence according to Piaget. So the key point is the formal operational stage.

Let me go through the options:

Option A: The stage of formal operations begins at about 11 when the child begins to think abstractly, hypothetically, and idealistically. That sounds right. Piaget said formal operations start around 11, so this fits.

Option B: Cognitive development peaks early in adolescence and declines. No, I don't think so. Development continues into adulthood, so this doesn't sound correct.

Option C: Return to sensory-motor thinking. No, that's the first stage, so not relevant here.

Option D: Cognitive development begins in adolescence. No, it starts much earlier, so this is wrong.

Option E: Development ends with formal operations. Well, yes, because it's the last stage, so that's correct. But the question is about the characteristics during adolescence, which is when formal operations begin.

Option F: Adolescents revert to egocentric thinking. Egocentrism is more a feature of the preoperational stage, like in early childhood, so this is incorrect.

Option G: Only a minority reach formal operations. Wait, I think Piaget believed that not everyone reaches this stage. Some might remain in concrete operations. So G says only a minority, but I'm not sure. I think in some cultures or educational systems, maybe not everyone does, but Piaget's theory was more about the stages being universal. Hmm, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Maybe G is correct, but I'm not certain.

Option H: Formal operations achieved by all by age 8. No, concrete operations end around 11, so this is wrong.

Option I: Deal with concrete situations. That's the concrete operational stage, which is before adolescence, so not the case here.

Option J: Focus on practical skills. That's more the concrete stage again, so J is incorrect.

So the options I'm considering are A, E, and G.

Wait, the question is about what happens during adolescence. So during adolescence, the formal operational stage begins. So A says it begins at 11, which is the start of adolescence, and describes the thinking as abstract, hypothetical, and idealistic. That fits.

E says development ends with formal operations. Well, yes, but the question is about what happens during adolescence. So E is correct but maybe not the best answer because the question is about the characteristics during that time, not the end point.

So looking back, the question is specifically about cognitive development during adolescence as described by Piaget. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but what about G? G says the stage is only reached by a minority. I thought Piaget believed that everyone who reaches the formal operational stage does so around adolescence, but maybe in reality, not everyone does. So is G correct? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: I remember that Piaget's theory posits that the formal operational stage is the final stage, and that it typically starts in adolescence, around 11-12. But he also thought that not all individuals reach this stage. So G says "only a minority" reach it, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. I think more people do, but maybe in some cases, especially without proper education or stimulation, some don't reach it. So perhaps G is correct.

Wait, but the question is about Piaget's description. So what did Piaget say? From what I remember, Piaget stated that the formal operational stage begins around adolescence, so A is correct. As for whether everyone reaches it, I think Piaget thought that it's the final stage, so the majority do, but maybe not everyone. So G might be incorrect because Piaget didn't say only a minority reach it. Or did he?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The options are:

A: Correctly describes the start and characteristics.

G: Says only a minority reach it.

Piaget's theory was that each stage is invariant and universal, but the rate may vary. So perhaps he didn't say that only a minority reach it, but rather that it's the final stage. So G would be incorrect as per Piaget's view.

So the correct answer should be A.

The question asks about cognitive development during adolescence as described by Piaget. According to Piaget's theory, cognitive development progresses through four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. The formal operational stage is the final stage, typically beginning in adolescence around the age of 11. During this stage, individuals develop the ability to think abstractly, reason logically, and consider hypothetical and idealistic concepts.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correctly states that the formal operational stage begins around age 11 and is characterized by abstract, hypothetical, and idealistic thinking. This aligns with Piaget's description of adolescence.
- **B**: Incorrect, as cognitive development does not peak and decline in early adolescence; it continues into adulthood.
- **C**: Incorrect, as sensory-motor thinking is the first stage and not relevant to adolescence.
- **D**: Incorrect, as cognitive development begins much earlier than adolescence.
- **E**: While technically correct that development ends with formal operations, the question focuses on the characteristics of adolescence, making this less relevant.
- **F**: Incorrect, as egocentric thinking is characteristic of the preoperational stage, not adolescence.
- **G**: Incorrect, as Piaget believed the formal operational stage is universal, though not everyone may fully achieve it; he did not suggest only a minority reach it.
- **H**: Incorrect, as formal operations begin around age 11, not 8.
- **I**: Incorrect, as dealing with concrete situations describes the concrete operational stage, which precedes adolescence.
- **J**: Incorrect, as practical skills are more relevant to earlier stages, not adolescence.

The best answer is **A**, as it accurately describes the onset and characteristics of the formal operational stage during adolescence according to Piaget.
