Question:

A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of sore throat and fever. During the past 3 days, she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are temperature 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse 130/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 102/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There is a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted. Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate management?

Options:

A: Oral nystatin therapy
B: Tranquilizer therapy
C: Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy
D: Oral pain reliever therapy
E: Intravenous antiviral therapy
F: Incision and drainage
G: Salt water gargle
H: Antacid therapy
I: Oral antifungal therapy
J: Inhaled corticosteroid therapy

Okay, so I have this medical question here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman presenting with a 5-day history of sore throat and fever. In the past three days, she's noticed a change in her voice and increased pain when swallowing. She's been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms started. Her medical history is unremarkable, no routine medications. Her vitals are temp 40°C (which is pretty high), pulse 130, respirations 18, BP 102/66. Oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

On exam, the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There's white exudate on the right tonsil. She has trismus, which is difficulty opening the mouth. Neck palpation shows enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes.

The question is asking, in addition to antibiotic therapy, what's the most appropriate management? The options are from A to J.

Alright, so first, I need to figure out what's going on here. Let's break down the symptoms and signs.

She has a severe sore throat, high fever, and difficulty swallowing. The oropharynx is red and swollen, with exudate on the right tonsil. The soft palate is displaced anteriorly on the right, and the uvula is deviated to the left. She also has trismus, which is lockjaw or inability to open the mouth fully, often due to pain or spasm in the muscles of mastication.

This clinical picture makes me think of a peritonsillar abscess. Let me think why. Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a collection of pus behind the tonsil, in the peritonsillar space. It's a complication of tonsillitis. Symptoms include severe sore throat, fever, trismus (because the muscles involved in opening the mouth are affected), and a muffled voice (often called "hot potato voice"). On exam, the uvula is often displaced to the opposite side, and the soft palate may be swollen and red.

In this case, the uvula is deviated to the left, and the soft palate on the right is displaced anteriorly. That suggests something is pushing it from the right side, which fits with a peritonsillar abscess on the right. The white exudate could be pus. The trismus and high fever also support an abscess, which is a sign of a more severe infection than just tonsillitis.

So, the patient likely has a peritonsillar abscess. Now, the question is about management beyond antibiotics. I know that for peritonsillar abscess, treatment usually involves antibiotics, pain management, and sometimes drainage of the abscess.

Looking at the options:

A: Oral nystatin - that's an antifungal, usually for oral candidiasis. Not relevant here.

B: Tranquilizer therapy - I don't think that's standard. Maybe for anxiety, but not for this condition.

C: IV methylprednisolone - steroids might help with inflammation, but I'm not sure if that's the immediate next step.

D: Oral pain reliever - they're already on acetaminophen. Maybe they need something stronger, like opioids or NSAIDs, but I'm not certain if that's the best option here.

E: IV antiviral - no indication of a viral etiology here; this seems bacterial.

F: Incision and drainage - this is a common treatment for PTA. They might need to drain the abscess.

G: Salt water gargle - that's more for symptom relief, maybe for tonsillitis, but not sufficient for an abscess.

H: Antacid therapy - not relevant here.

I: Oral antifungal - same as A, not needed.

J: Inhaled corticosteroid - not appropriate here.

So, the main options are C, D, F. The question says, in addition to antibiotic therapy, what's the next step.

Antibiotics are given, but if it's a large abscess, it might not resolve with just antibiotics. Incision and drainage is often necessary to evacuate the pus, which can help with pain and prevent complications.

Alternatively, steroids could help reduce swelling. But usually, in an abscess, the main issue is the collection of pus, so drainage is key.

Trismus can make it difficult to open the mouth, so sometimes they might need anesthesia to drain it, but that's more procedural.

So, the correct answer is probably F: Incision and drainage.

Wait, but let me think again. Could there be another possibility? Sometimes, if the abscess is small, they might attempt needle aspiration, but in a severe case like this with high fever and trismus, incision and drainage is more definitive.

So, yes, I think F is the right choice.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman presenting with symptoms suggestive of a peritonsillar abscess (PTA), including severe sore throat, high fever, trismus, and deviation of the uvula. The physical examination confirms significant swelling, displacement, and exudate consistent with an abscess. In addition to antibiotic therapy, the most appropriate management for PTA involves addressing the abscess directly. 

Among the options provided, incision and drainage (Option F) is the most appropriate next step. This procedure is necessary to evacuate the pus, reduce symptoms, and prevent complications. Other options, such as oral pain relievers or steroids, may provide supportive care but do not address the underlying abscess. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: Incision and drainage

Answer: F
