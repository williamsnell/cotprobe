Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a container with a plunger compresses one lb-mol of an ideal gas from 1 atmosphere to 10 atmospheres. They mention it's a polytropic process, and we're supposed to calculate the work done. The temperature is given as 273 K, and the polytropic index k is 1.4. They also say to neglect any losses, which I think means we don't have to worry about efficiency or anything like that.

Hmm, I remember that work done during a polytropic process can be calculated with a specific formula. Let me try to recall. Oh right, the formula for work done on the gas during compression is something like W = P_initial * V_initial / (k-1) * [1 - (P_final / P_initial)^((k-1)/k) ].

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Another thought: for a polytropic process, PV^k equals a constant. So the general formula for work done is (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(k-1) when it's expansion, but since this is compression, the work done on the gas would be positive. But wait, in the context of the problem, when the gas is compressed, work is done on the system, so the work would be negative as the system is receiving work. Or wait, maybe I should get the signs right. I need to clarify that.

Wait, I think the formula for work done on the gas (compression) is positive. But in the options, all the answers are negative. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the sign conventions. Let's think: in physics, work done by the system is negative, and work done on the system is positive. But in engineering thermodynamics, sometimes it's the opposite. Oh wait, in the problem statement, the work done by the system would be negative because the system is doing work on the surroundings during expansion. But in this case, it's compression, so the surroundings are doing work on the system, which would be positive work. But the options are all negative, so maybe the question is asking for work done by the system. Or perhaps I should focus on the magnitude and then see the sign based on the context.

Wait, maybe I should just focus on the formula. The work done on the gas during a polytropic compression is given by W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(k-1). But wait, another version of the formula I've seen is W = (n R T)/(k-1) [1 - (P2/P1)^((k-1)/k)].

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to write down the correct formula. For a polytropic process where PV^k = constant, the work done on the gas (compression) is positive and is given by:

W = (n R T) / (k - 1) * [1 - (P2 / P1)^((k - 1)/k)]

Wait, but wait! Let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, because when the gas is being compressed, the volume decreases. So the formula for work done on the gas (compression) would be:

W = (n R T) / (k - 1) * [ (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (P1 V1) ) ]... Hmm, no, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, another approach. For a polytropic process, the work can be expressed as:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (k - 1)

But that's when the process is expansion, right? Wait, no, that formula is for when you're going from state 1 to state 2. So if P2 > P1, then P1 V1 is greater than P2 V2 because the gas is being compressed, so the work done on the gas would be positive.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about whether to use P1 and P2 correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the work in terms of pressure and volume. Since the work done on the gas during compression would be positive, the formula is:

W = (n R T) / (k - 1) [1 - (P2 / P1)^((k-1)/k)]

Wait, wait, no, I think that when the pressure increases, the term (P2/P1) would be greater than 1, so 1 - (something >1) would be negative, which would mean the work is negative. But that doesn't make sense if the work is done on the gas. Hmm, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula in terms of the integral of P dV. The work done by the gas during expansion is the integral from V1 to V2 of P dV. But when the gas is compressed, V2 < V1, so the work done by the gas is negative (since the system is doing less work as it's being compressed). So the work done on the gas would be positive in that case.

But in the problem, the options are all negative, implying that the work done by the gas is negative, which would align with the system receiving work (compression). So perhaps the formula gives a negative value when the gas is compressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is:

W = n R T [ (P2 V2 - P1 V1) / (k - 1) ) ] ... No, wait.

Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up different expressions. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, for a polytropic process PV^k = C, where C is a constant.

The formula for work done is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (k - 1)

But wait, this is only applicable when the process is reversible and follows PV^k = C. So, to use this, I need to find V1 and V2.

Wait, but I have n, P1, P2, temperature, and k. So perhaps it's better to express V1 and V2 using the ideal gas law.

Given that n = 1 lb-mol, T = 273 K.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT.

So, V1 = nRT / P1.

Similarly, V2 = nRT / P2.

So, V1 = (1 lb-mol)(R)(273 K) / (1 atm).

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units here because the gas constant R is involved. Let me recall the value of R in appropriate units.

In the English system, R is often given as 53.35 ft-lbf/(lb-mol·R). Wait, but wait, temperature is in Kelvin here, but R is sometimes expressed with Rankine. Wait, since temperature is given in K, but the gas constant uses Rankine. So I need to convert T from K to R.

Wait, 273 K is 0 degrees Celsius, which is 273.15 K, which is 31.67 degrees Rankine (since Rankine is 5/9 of Kelvin). Hmm, but wait, more accurately, 273.15 K is 0°C, which is 31.67 °R. But wait, the problem says 273 K, so I think I can approximate it as 273.15 K, which is 31.687 °R.

Wait, but perhaps the question expects me to use T in Rankine? Because when using R in English units, temperature needs to be in Rankine.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So I need to convert T from K to R.

So, T (°R) = T (K) * 9/5.

So 273 K * 9/5 = (273 * 9)/5 = 2457/5 = 491.4 °R.

Wait, no, wait: 0°C is 273.15 K, which is 491.67 °R. So 273 K is approximately 491.4 °R.

Okay, so now, R in English units is 53.35 ft·lb_f/(lb-mol·°R).

So, V1 = (nRT)/P1.

n=1 lb-mol, R=53.35, T=491.4 °R, P1=1 atm.

But wait, I need the volume in cubic feet. So let me compute V1.

V1 = (1 * 53.35 * 491.4) / 1 atm.

Wait, but wait, units: atm is in pounds per square foot? Wait, no, atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, but when dealing with volume in cubic feet, we need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, perhaps I should compute V1 in cubic feet. Let me compute this:

V1 = (n R T) / P1.

n = 1 lb-mol.

R = 53.35 ft·lb_f/(lb-mol·°R)

T = 491.4 °R.

P1 = 1 atm. But 1 atm in lb_f/ft² is approximately 2116.2 lb_f/ft².

Wait, because 1 atm = 14.7 psi, and 1 psi is 144 lb_f/ft² (since 1 lb_f/in² * 144 in²/ft² = 144 lb_f/ft²). So 14.7 psi = 14.7 * 144 = 2116.8 lb_f/ft².

So P1 = 2116.2 lb_f/ft².

So V1 = (1 * 53.35 * 491.4) / 2116.2

Let me compute that:

Compute numerator: 53.35 * 491.4 = let's see, 53 * 491 is approx 53*490=26,870, so 53.35*491.4 is approx 26,200.

Wait, 53.35 * 491.4: 50*491.4=24,570, 3.35*491.4 ≈ 1,647.39. So total ≈ 24,570 + 1,647.39 ≈ 26,217.39.

Then divide by 2116.2: 26,217.39 / 2116.2 ≈ let's see, 2116.2 * 12 = 25,394.4. So 26,217.39-25,394.4=822.99 left. 822.99/2116.2≈ 0.39. So total V1 ≈ 12.39 ft³.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can use exact values.

Wait, I can also compute V1 as:

V1 = n R T / P1

n=1, R=53.35, T=491.4, P1=2116.2.

So V1 = (1)(53.35)(491.4) / 2116.2.

Compute numerator: 53.35 * 491.4.

Let me do 53.35 * 491.4.

Let me compute 53.35 * 400 = 21,340.

53.35 * 90 = 4,801.5.

53.35 * 1.4 = 74.69.

So total: 21,340 + 4,801.5 = 26,141.5 +74.69 = 26,216.19.

So V1 = 26,216.19 / 2116.2 ≈ let me compute that.

2116.2 * 12 = 25,394.4.

26,216.19 - 25,394.4 = 821.79.

821.79 / 2116.2 ≈ 0.388.

So V1 ≈ 12.388 ft³.

Similarly, V2 = n R T / P2.

P2 is 10 atm, so P2 = 10 * 2116.2 = 21,162 lb_f/ft².

V2 = (1)(53.35)(491.4) / 21,162.

So numerator same as before: 26,216.19.

Denominator: 21,162.

26,216.19 / 21,162 ≈ 1.238 ft³.

Wait, but perhaps these exact numbers aren't necessary because I'm going to plug them into the work formula.

The polytropic work formula is W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (k - 1).

Wait, but earlier I thought that the formula for work done on the gas is positive, so plugging in the values:

P1 V1 is 1 atm * 12.388 ft³.

Wait, but I have to make sure that the units are consistent. Because P1 and P2 are in lb_f/ft², and V is in ft³, so P V would be in lb_f·ft, which is equivalent to ft·lb_f.

Wait, no, wait: P is in lb_f/ft², V in ft³, so P*V is (lb_f/ft²) * ft³ = lb_f*ft. Which is correct because work is in ft·lb_f.

So P1 V1 = (2116.2 lb_f/ft²) * 12.388 ft³.

Wait, 2116.2 * 12.388 ≈ Let me compute that.

2000 * 12.388 = 24,776.

116.2 *12.388 ≈ approx 1,440.

So total approx 24,776 + 1,440 = 26,216 lb_f·ft.

Similarly, P2 V2 = 21,162 lb_f/ft² * 1.238 ft³.

21,162 * 1.238 ≈ Let's see, 21,162 *1 = 21,162.

21,162 * 0.2 = 4,232.4.

21,162 * 0.038 ≈ 804.16.

So total ≈ 21,162 + 4,232.4 = 25,394.4 + 804.16 = 26,198.56 lb_f·ft.

Wait, but that seems too close. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation because when I compute V2 as nRT/(P2), and P2 is 10 atm, V2 should be 1/10th of V1, right? So V2 = V1 /10 = 12.388 /10 = 1.2388 ft³.

So P2 V2 is 10 atm * 1.2388 ft³.

Wait, but earlier when computing with actual units, P2 is 10 atm in lb_f/ft², so 10 * 2116.2 = 21162 lb_f/ft².

Wait, so P2 V2 = 21162 * 1.2388.

Let me compute that accurately.

21162 * 1 = 21162.

21162 * 0.2 = 4232.4.

21162 * 0.0388 ≈ let's compute 21162 * 0.03 = 634.86, 21162 * 0.0088 ≈ 186.28. So total 634.86 + 186.28 ≈ 821.14.

So total P2 V2 = 21162 + 4232.4 + 821.14 ≈ 21162 + 5053.54 ≈ 26215.54 lb_f·ft.

Wait, that's almost the same as P1 V1, which is 26,216 lb_f·ft. So P1 V1 ≈ 26,216, P2 V2 ≈ 26,215.54. So the difference is minimal?

Wait, that can't be right. Because when you compress a gas polytropically, the work done is usually significant. If P1 V1 and P2 V2 are almost the same, then the work would be near zero, which contradicts the options given.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the formula. Maybe the formula I should use is the one involving the work for a polytropic process in terms of n, R, T, and the pressures.

Wait, another formula I remember is:

For a polytropic process, the work done is:

W = (n R T) / (k - 1) [1 - (P2/P1)^((k-1)/k)]

Because when the process is polytropic and reversible, the work can be expressed in terms of temperatures or pressures.

Wait, but wait, let me check the derivation.

Starting from PV^k = C.

The work done on the gas is the integral of P dV from V1 to V2.

Since PV^k = C, P = C V^{-k}.

So the integral becomes ∫ C V^{-k} dV from V1 to V2.

Which is C ∫ V^{-k} dV from V1 to V2.

Integrate V^{-k} is [V^{-(k-1)}]/(-(k-1))).

So W = C [ V2^{-(k-1)} - V1^{-(k-1)} ] / (-(k-1)) )

But C is P1 V1^k, from P1 V1^k = C.

So substituting C:

W = P1 V1^k [ (V2^{-(k-1)} - V1^{-(k-1)} ) / ( - (k-1) ) ) ]

= P1 V1^k [ (V1^{-(k-1)} - V2^{-(k-1)} ) / (k-1) ) ]

Simplify:

= (P1 V1^k) ( V1^{-(k-1)} - V2^{-(k-1)} ) ) / (k-1)

= (P1 V1^{k - (k-1)} ) (1 - (V2/V1)^{ -(k-1)} ) / (k-1 )

Simplify exponent in V1: k - (k-1) = 1, so V1^1 = V1.

Thus:

W = (P1 V1) ( 1 - (V2/V1)^{ -(k-1)} ) / (k-1 )

But (V2/V1)^{-(k-1)} is equal to (P1/P2)^{(k-1)/k} because from the ideal gas law, since T is constant? Wait, no, wait, temperature isn't constant in a polytropic process unless it's isothermal, which it's not because k=1.4, so it's a different process.

Wait,
