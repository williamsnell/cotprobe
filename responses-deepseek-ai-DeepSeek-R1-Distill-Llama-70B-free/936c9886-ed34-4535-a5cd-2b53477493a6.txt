Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says, "A decrease in the price of a particular product will result in..." and then there are several options.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that demand and supply are related to price. When the price changes, it affects the quantity demanded or supplied. Wait, I'm a bit confused between demand and quantity demanded. I think demand refers to the whole schedule, while quantity demanded is the specific amount at a certain price.

So the question is about a decrease in price. What happens then? Oh right, the law of demand says that when the price of a product decreases, the quantity demanded increases, assuming all other factors are constant. That's because lower prices make the product more affordable, so people are willing to buy more.

Looking at the options, option A says "an increase in the quantity demanded." That sounds right. Option B is the opposite, so that's probably not correct. What about the other options? Option C mentions supply increasing, but wait, a change in price affects demand, not supply. Unless we're talking about quantity supplied. Oh wait, if the price decreases, suppliers might supply less, right? So that would be a decrease in quantity supplied, but that's not the same as supply itself. The supply curve is about how much producers are willing to supply at different prices.

So the question is about the result of a price decrease. The immediate effect is on the quantity demanded. So option A seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is about a particular product, so it's talking about a movement along the demand curve, not a shift. So yes, lower price means higher quantity demanded.

I should also check the other options. Option H and I talk about demand increasing or decreasing. But a change in price doesn't shift the demand curve; it just moves along it. So demand as a whole doesn't change unless other factors like income or preferences change.

Similarly, supply (options C, E, G, J) are about producers. If the price decreases, the quantity supplied would decrease (like option J), but that's not what the question is asking. The question is about what results from a price decrease, which is about the consumer's response, so quantity demanded.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be A.

When the price of a product decreases, according to the law of demand, consumers will typically increase the quantity they are willing to buy, assuming all other factors remain constant. This is a movement along the demand curve, not a shift in the demand curve itself. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. A decrease in price leads to an increase in the quantity demanded.
- **B**: Incorrect. The quantity demanded does not decrease when the price falls.
- **C, E, G, J**: These relate to supply, but the question focuses on the effect of a price change on demand, not supply.
- **H, I**: These suggest a shift in demand, which does not occur due to a price change alone.
- **D, F**: These imply no change, which contradicts the law of demand.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
