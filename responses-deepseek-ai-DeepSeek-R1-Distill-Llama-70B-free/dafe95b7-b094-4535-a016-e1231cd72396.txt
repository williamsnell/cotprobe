Question:

An owner operated a successful retail business. He decided he wanted to retire and listed his business for sale. A buyer saw the listing and visited the retail business. The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect "unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business. " Subsequently, the buyer made no effort to attempt to obtain a loan from a bank so that the sale could be finalized. After several months, the owner filed suit against the buyer for breach of contract. Which of the following will be the owner's strongest argument in support of his action against the buyer for breach of contract?

Options:

A: The buyer's lack of effort in obtaining a loan is a breach of good faith and fair dealing.
B: The buyer was under a duty to inform the owner of her decision not to seek a loan.
C: Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.
D: The owner suffered financial loss due to the buyer's inaction in seeking a loan.
E: The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.
F: The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a "condition" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.
G: Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.
H: The buyer did not explicitly state in the contract that she would not seek a loan.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about contract law, specifically regarding conditions and breach of contract. Hmm, I remember that contracts can have conditions that must be met for the agreement to be enforceable. 

So the scenario is that an owner wants to sell his business, and the buyer agrees to buy it for $250k, but the sale is contingent on the buyer getting a loan from the bank. The contract says the sale won't happen unless she successfully gets the loan. But then she doesn't even try to get the loan, and the owner sues her.

The question is what's the owner's strongest argument. The options are A to H. 

First, I think about conditions in a contract. There are conditions precedent, which must happen before the contract becomes enforceable. If the condition isn't met, the contract doesn't have to be performed. So in this case, getting the loan is a condition precedent for the buyer's obligation to purchase.

But wait, what if the condition isn't met because the buyer didn't try? Like, she didn't make an effort to get the loan. Is that a breach? Or does it just mean the condition failed, so the contract isn't enforceable against her?

I remember something about a duty of good faith. Even if a condition is outside someone's control, they can't deliberately prevent it from happening. So, if the buyer doesn't make a reasonable effort, maybe that's a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 

Looking at the options, option E says the buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain the loan. That sounds right because parties are expected to act in good faith. If the condition is getting the loan, the buyer can't just sit back and do nothing, because that would frustrate the purpose of the contract.

Option A says it's a breach of good faith and fair dealing. That's similar to E, but E is more specific about the implied promise to make an effort. So E might be the stronger argument.

Option C talks about excusing the condition because it causes a forfeiture. I'm not too sure about that. Forfeiture is when one party loses a right because of a condition, but I think that applies more when the condition isn't met through no fault, but maybe the owner could argue that the buyer's inaction caused the forfeiture. But I'm not so confident about this one.

Option F says the condition wasn't worded as a "condition." But the contract used the word "unless," which I think is a condition. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says the condition is unconscionable. That doesn't make sense because a loan condition is pretty standard in business sales. So G is out.

So, putting it together, the strongest argument is that the buyer impliedly promised to make a reasonable effort to get the loan, and by not doing anything, she breached that promise. So E is the right answer.

The strongest argument for the owner is that the buyer impliedly promised to make a reasonable effort to obtain the loan, and her failure to do so constitutes a breach of that implied promise. This ties into the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which requires parties to act in a way that does not frustrate the purpose of the contract. Since the contract made the sale contingent on securing a loan, the buyer's inaction undermines this condition and breaches the implied covenant.

Option E correctly captures this reasoning, making it the most compelling argument.
