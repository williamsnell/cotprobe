Okay, so I've got this question here about angles formed by two perpendicular lines. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my geometry, but let me think it through.

Alright, I remember that when two lines are perpendicular, they form a specific kind of angle. Wait, perpendicular means they intersect at 90 degrees, right? So the angle they make is a right angle. But let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Let me go through the options. Option A is reflex angle. Reflex angles are bigger than 180 degrees, so that's not right because 90 is less than 180. Option B is complementary. Complementary angles add up to 90, so two angles that complement each other make 90 together. But the question is about the angle formed by the two lines meeting, not two angles adding up. So that's probably not it.

Option C is supplementary. Supplementary angles add up to 180. Again, that's about the sum of two angles, not the angle formed by two lines. So C isn't the right choice either.

Option D is zero. Zero angle would mean they don't meet or something, but obviously, two lines that are perpendicular do meet, so D is out.

E is right. Right, because 90 degrees is a right angle. That makes sense. But let me check the other options to be thorough.

F is invisible. Wait, that's not a real term in geometry. Angles can't be invisible. So F is wrong.

G is full rotation. A full rotation is 360 degrees, which is way more than what we're dealing with here. So G is incorrect.

H is acute. Acute angles are less than 90 degrees. Since 90 is exactly a right angle, H isn't the answer.

I is straight. A straight angle is 180 degrees, like a straight line. So that's not it either.

J is obtuse. Obtuse angles are between 90 and 180. So again, not 90, which is exactly a right angle.

So putting it all together, the angle formed by two perpendicular lines meeting is a right angle. So the correct answer should be E.

The angle formed where two perpendicular lines meet is a right angle, as they intersect at 90 degrees. 

Answer: E
