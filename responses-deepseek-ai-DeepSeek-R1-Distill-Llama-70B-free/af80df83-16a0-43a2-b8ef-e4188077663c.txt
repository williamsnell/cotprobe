Question:

A landlord was the owner of a two-story dwelling house and leased it completely furnished to a tenant for a 10-year period. Two years after the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement with the landlord, he subleases the house to his cousin. Thereafter, the cousin defaults on the rental payments. If the landlord brings an action to recover the past rent due from the cousin, the landlord will:

Options:

A: not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.
B: recover, because the landlord is the original owner of the house.
C: not recover, because the landlord did not approve the sublease agreement.
D: recover, because there is privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.
E: not recover, because there is no privity of contract between the landlord and sublessee.
F: recover, because there is both privity of estate and privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.
G: not recover, because the original tenant is responsible for the rent, not the sublessee.
H: recover, because there is privity of estate and privity of contract between the landlord and the original tenant.
I: recover, because the landlord has a right to payment from any tenant occupying the property.
J: recover, because pnvity of estate exists between a landlord and sublessee.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about landlord-tenant law, specifically dealing with subleases and who is liable for rent. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the situation is that a landlord owns a two-story house and leased it completely furnished to a tenant for 10 years. So the tenant has a lease agreement with the landlord. Now, two years later, the tenant subleases the house to his cousin. Then the cousin stops paying rent. The landlord wants to sue the cousin for the past rent. The question is whether the landlord can recover from the cousin.

First, I need to remember the concepts of privity of contract and privity of estate. Privity of contract means that there's a direct contractual relationship between two parties. So the landlord and the tenant have a lease, which is a contract, so there's privity of contract between them. But what about the sublease?

When a tenant subleases to someone else, like the cousin, the tenant becomes the sublessor, and the cousin is the sublessee. So the sublease is a contract between the tenant and the cousin. Now, does that create any privity between the landlord and the sublessee (cousin)?

Wait, privity of estate refers to the legal relationship between parties concerning a particular property. In a lease, the landlord and tenant have privity of estate because the lease gives the tenant the right to possess the property. But when a tenant subleases, the sublessee (cousin) gets a right to possession from the tenant, but does that create privity of estate with the landlord?

I think the key here is whether the landlord can hold the sublessee liable for rent. Generally, the original tenant remains liable for the rent because the lease is between the landlord and the tenant. The sublease is a separate agreement. So the sublessee's obligation is to the tenant, not the landlord. So the landlord can't directly go after the sublessee unless there's an assignment, not a sublease.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. In a sublease, the tenant (sublessor) transfers a portion of their leased premises or a portion of the remaining term to the sublessee. The original lease between landlord and tenant remains in place. So the tenant is still responsible to the landlord for the rent.

But can the landlord sue the sublessee for rent? I think that without the landlord's consent, the sublessee isn't directly liable to the landlord. Because there's no privity of contract between them. The sublessee's contract is with the tenant, not the landlord.

So looking at the options:

Option A says the landlord won't recover because there's no privity of estate between landlord and sublessee. Is that correct? Privity of estate would require that the sublessee holds directly from the landlord, which isn't the case here. So the landlord and sublessee don't have privity of estate.

Option E says the landlord won't recover because there's no privity of contract. That makes sense because the sublessee's contract is with the tenant, not the landlord.

Wait, but some options mention privity of contract. Option D says the landlord can recover because there's privity of contract. No, because the sublessee didn't contract with the landlord.

Option G says the original tenant is responsible, so the landlord can't recover from the cousin. That fits with what I was thinking earlier.

Option J says privity of estate exists between landlord and sublessee, so the landlord can recover. But no, I don't think so. The sublessee's estate is derived from the tenant, not the landlord.

So putting it together: the landlord can't recover from the sublessee because there's no privity of contract or estate directly between them. The tenant is the one liable for the rent. So the correct answer would be either A, E, or G.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the landlord doesn't have privity with the sublessee, can the landlord still hold the sublessee liable? Or is the sublessee's liability only to the tenant?

In most jurisdictions, the sublessee isn't directly liable to the landlord unless the landlord has somehow become a party to the sublease or has given consent. Without that, the landlord can only go after the original tenant.

So looking at the options, option E says no recovery because no privity of contract. That seems right. Option A says no recovery because no privity of estate. Which is also correct. Hmm, which one applies here?

Wait, privity of contract is about the contractual relationship. For the landlord to sue for rent, they need to have a contract (privity of contract) with the sublessee. Since the sublessee has a contract with the tenant, not the landlord, there's no privity of contract. So the landlord can't sue the sublessee directly.

So option E says the landlord can't recover because no privity of contract. That's correct.

Alternatively, option A says no privity of estate. But privity of estate refers to the right to possession. The sublessee does have possession, but that's through the tenant, not the landlord. So the landlord and sublessee don't have a direct estate relationship. So option A is also correct.

Wait, but which is the correct reason? Let's think. In real property law, to recover rent, the landlord must have both privity of contract and privity of estate with the person they're suing. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Privity of estate is about the right to possession, but the right to rent is based on the lease contract.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the landlord can pursue the sublessee for use and occupation. But generally, the sublessee's obligation is to the tenant, not the landlord. Unless the sublessee has attorned to the landlord, which would create privity.

In this case, the sublease was done without the landlord's approval, so there's no attornment. So the sublessee isn't directly responsible to the landlord.

So the correct reason is that there's no privity of contract. Because the sublessee didn't contract with the landlord. So the landlord can't sue the sublessee for rent. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but some sources say that the original tenant is primarily liable, and the sublessee is not. So the landlord can't recover from the sublessee because there's no privity of contract.

So looking at the options again:

A: No recovery, no privity of estate.

E: No recovery, no privity of contract.

Which is correct? Because privity of contract is necessary for the landlord to have a right to rent from the sublessee.

Yes, so the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around whether a landlord can recover past rent from a sublessee (the cousin) when the sublessee defaults on rental payments. The key issue is the relationship between the landlord and the sublessee, specifically whether there is privity of contract or privity of estate between them.

1. **Privity of Contract**: This refers to a direct contractual relationship between two parties. In this case, the landlord and the tenant have a lease agreement, creating privity of contract between them. However, the sublease is a separate contract between the tenant (as sublessor) and the cousin (as sublessee). The landlord is not a party to this sublease, meaning there is no privity of contract between the landlord and the sublessee. Without this, the landlord cannot directly sue the sublessee for rent.

2. **Privity of Estate**: This refers to the legal relationship concerning the right to possess and use the property. The landlord and the tenant have privity of estate because the lease grants the tenant the right to possession. However, the sublessee's right to possession comes from the tenant, not the landlord. Thus, there is no privity of estate between the landlord and the sublessee.

3. **Liability for Rent**: The original tenant remains liable for the rent under the lease agreement with the landlord. The sublessee's obligation is to the tenant, not the landlord, unless the landlord explicitly approves the sublease or there is attornment (which is not present here). Therefore, the landlord cannot recover rent directly from the sublessee.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Correctly states that the landlord cannot recover because there is no privity of estate between the landlord and the sublessee.
- **Option E**: Correctly states that the landlord cannot recover because there is no privity of contract between the landlord and the sublessee.
- **Option G**: Correctly states that the original tenant is responsible for the rent, not the sublessee.

While both A and E are plausible, the more precise reason is the lack of privity of contract, as the landlord's right to rent is based on the lease agreement, which does not include the sublessee. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: not recover, because there is no privity of contract between the landlord and sublessee.**

Answer: E
