Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a person walking and the acceleration of a blood drop in their arm. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit rusty on circular motion, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that when a person walks, their arms swing through approximately a 45-degree angle in 0.5 seconds. They mention that the arm moves with constant speed during each swing. The arm length is 70 cm, and I need to find the acceleration of a blood drop at the fingertips when it's at the bottom of the swing. The options are given in m/s².

Wait, I think I remember that when something moves in a circular path, the acceleration is towards the center of the circle. That's centripetal acceleration, right? The formula for centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r, where v is the velocity and r is the radius of the circle.

So the arm is moving in a circular path with radius equal to the arm length, which is 70 cm or 0.7 meters. The angle it swings through is 45 degrees, and the time taken for that swing is 0.5 seconds. But wait, how do I find the velocity from that?

Oh, right, because the arm is moving through an angle θ in time t, I can find the angular velocity ω. The formula for angular velocity is ω = θ / t. But θ needs to be in radians, right? So 45 degrees converted to radians is π/4, which is approximately 0.7854 radians.

Calculating ω: θ is 45 degrees, so in radians, 0.7854 rad. The time is 0.5 seconds. So ω = 0.7854 / 0.5 = approximately 1.5708 rad/s. Wait, that's pi/2 over 0.5, which is pi per second. Oh wait, because 0.7854 is about pi/4, divided by 0.5 is pi/2, yeah, about 1.5708 rad/s.

Wait, but the arm swings through 45 degrees in 0.5 seconds. So that's the time for a quarter of a full swing? Or is the full swing 90 degrees? Hmm. No, wait, the arms swing through 45 degrees in half a second. So each swing is a movement of 45 degrees, taking 0.5 seconds. So the angular velocity is correct as 0.7854 / 0.5.

Wait, but the arm is moving at a constant speed during each swing. So the angular velocity is constant. That makes sense.

Now, the linear velocity v is related to angular velocity by v = r * ω. So I can calculate v as 0.7 meters * 1.5708 rad/s.

Let me compute that. 0.7 * 1.5708. Hmm, 0.7 times 1.5 is 1.05, and 0.7 times 0.0708 is about 0.0496. So total v is approximately 1.0996 m/s.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 1.5708 times 0.7. Let's compute 1.5708 * 0.7:

1.5708 * 0.7 = 1.09956 m/s. So approximately 1.1 m/s.

Now, the centripetal acceleration a = v² / r.

So plugging the numbers in, v is about 1.09956 m/s. Squaring that: (1.09956)^2 = approximately 1.2093.

Then divide by r, which is 0.7 m. So 1.2093 / 0.7 = approximately 1.729 m/s².

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Because 1.1 squared is 1.21. 1.21 divided by 0.7 is around 1.7286, which is approximately 1.73 m/s².

Looking at the options, option F is 1.73. So that's looking like the answer.

But wait, did I miss anything? Let me think again. The problem mentions a 1.0 g drop of blood. Does the mass matter? Oh, no, because acceleration is independent of mass in this case. So mass doesn't affect the acceleration here. So the 1.0 gram is just extra info.

Another thing to check: the direction. The question asks for acceleration at the bottom of the swing. In circular motion, the acceleration is always towards the center. At the bottom, that would be upward, but the magnitude is what's being asked here.

Wait, but when the arm is at the bottom, the acceleration is pointing upward towards the shoulder. But the question just asks for the acceleration, which is a magnitude, so the value would be positive.

Wait, did I get the right formula? Yes, centripetal acceleration is correct. So I think my approach is right.

So the acceleration is approximately 1.73 m/s², which is option F.

To determine the acceleration of a 1.0 g drop of blood in the fingertips at the bottom of the swing, we analyze the circular motion of the arm. The arm swings through a 45° angle in 0.5 seconds, and its length is 70.0 cm (0.7 m). The acceleration at the bottom of the swing is the centripetal acceleration, given by:

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
\]

where \(v\) is the linear velocity and \(r\) is the radius of the circular path (arm length). First, calculate the angular velocity \(\omega\):

\[
\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}
\]

The angle \(\theta = 45^\circ\) is converted to radians: \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.7854 \, \text{rad}\). Substituting \(\theta = 0.7854 \, \text{rad}\) and \(t = 0.5 \, \text{s}\):

\[
\omega = \frac{0.7854}{0.5} \approx 1.5708 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

Next, calculate the linear velocity \(v\) using \(v = r \cdot \omega\):

\[
v = 0.7 \cdot 1.5708 \approx 1.09956 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now, calculate the centripetal acceleration \(a\):

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{(1.09956)^2}{0.7}
\]

First, square \(v\):

\[
v^2 = (1.09956)^2 \approx 1.2093
\]

Then divide by \(r = 0.7\):

\[
a = \frac{1.2093}{0.7} \approx 1.729 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Thus, the acceleration of the blood drop at the bottom of the swing is approximately \(1.73 \, \text{m/s}^2\). The mass of the blood drop (1.0 g) does not affect the acceleration, as centripetal acceleration is independent of mass.

From the given options, the closest value is:

**F: 1.73**
