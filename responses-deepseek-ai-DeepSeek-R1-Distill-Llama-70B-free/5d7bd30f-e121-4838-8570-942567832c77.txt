Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about when arrests can be made without a warrant. I'm a bit rusty on my criminal procedure, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which option is NOT a circumstance where an arrest can be made without a warrant. The options are A through D.

Let me think about what I remember regarding warrantless arrests. Generally, a warrant is required for arrests, but there are exceptions. The main ones I remember are:

1. When a felony is committed in the presence of the officer. So if the officer actually sees someone committing a felony, they can arrest without a warrant.

2. When a misdemeanor is committed in the officer's presence, especially if it's a breach of the peace. I think that's because misdemeanors are less severe, but if it's happening right there, the officer can step in.

3. For felonies, even if not in the officer's presence, if the officer has probable cause to believe the person committed it. So probable cause for a felony allows warrantless arrest.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. I think for misdemeanors, the general rule is that an officer can't make a warrantless arrest unless it's committed in their presence. But some states might have broader rules, like allowing it for certain misdemeanors, especially breaches of peace, even if not in presence? Or is that only when it's in presence?

Looking at the options:

Option A: A misdemeanor occurred, and the officer believes the person committed it. Wait, but if the misdemeanor didn't happen in the officer's presence, can they arrest without a warrant? I thought that's not allowed. Because for misdemeanors, the traditional rule is that you need a warrant unless it's in your presence. So if the misdemeanor wasn't in their presence, they can't arrest without a warrant.

Option B: Officer has probable cause that a felony occurred and the person did it. That's a standard exception. So this is a valid circumstance, so the question is asking which is NOT valid, so B is not the answer.

Option C: Arrest for a felony committed in the officer's presence. That's definitely allowed, so C is a valid circumstance, not the answer.

Option D: Arrest for a misdemeanor that's a breach of peace and in the officer's presence. I think this is allowed. Because it's in their presence, and maybe even more so if it's a breach of peace. So this is a valid exception.

So the question is which is NOT allowed. So the options are about what's not a valid circumstance.

Looking back, the question is which is NOT one of the circumstances where an arrest can be made without a warrant.

So the options:

A: Misdemeanor occurred, officer believes person did it. If this is without the misdemeanor being in the officer's presence, then this would not be allowed. Because for misdemeanors, the officer generally needs to witness it. So if the misdemeanor happened elsewhere, and the officer just believes the person did it, they can't arrest without a warrant.

Wait, but the option says "a misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it." It doesn't specify whether it was in presence. So if the misdemeanor wasn't in the officer's presence, then the officer can't make the arrest without a warrant. So in that case, option A describes a situation where an arrest without a warrant would not be allowed.

Wait, but maybe I'm misremembering. Are there any exceptions for misdemeanors beyond presence? Like, in some states, can they arrest for misdemeanors not in presence if certain conditions are met?

I think traditionally, no. The common law rule is that misdemeanors require a warrant unless committed in the officer's presence. So if the misdemeanor didn't occur in front of the officer, the officer can't arrest without a warrant.

So in option A, it's about a misdemeanor that the officer believes the person committed. But if it wasn't in the officer's presence, then this arrest would not be allowed without a warrant. Therefore, option A is a circumstance where an arrest without a warrant is NOT allowed.

Wait, but option A doesn't specify whether the misdemeanor was in the officer's presence. It just says "a misdemeanor has occurred." So if the officer believes the person did it, but didn't see it, then it's not allowed. So option A is a situation where a warrant is needed, so it's not a valid exception. Thus, the answer would be option A because it's not a circumstance where a warrantless arrest is allowed.

But wait, let me check the other options again. Option D says a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and in presence. That should be allowed because it's in presence and it's a breach of peace, which is a specific misdemeanor. So D is a valid exception.

Option B is about a felony with probable cause, which is allowed.

Option C is a felony in presence, allowed.

So the only one that's not allowed is A, because it's about a misdemeanor not necessarily in presence. So the question is which is NOT a circumstance, so the answer is A.

To determine which circumstance does not allow for a warrantless arrest, we analyze each option:

- **Option A**: This describes a situation where a misdemeanor has occurred, and the officer believes the person committed it. However, under traditional rules, a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor is only permitted if the offense occurs in the officer's presence. If the misdemeanor did not occur in the officer's presence, a warrant is required. Since this option does not specify that the misdemeanor occurred in the officer's presence, it describes a circumstance where a warrantless arrest is not allowed.

- **Option B**: This involves an officer having probable cause that a felony occurred and that the arrested person committed it. This is a valid exception to the warrant requirement, as probable cause for a felony allows for a warrantless arrest.

- **Option C**: This describes an arrest for a felony committed in the officer's presence. This is a well-established exception to the warrant requirement, as officers can arrest without a warrant if they witness a felony.

- **Option D**: This involves a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and committed in the officer's presence. Since the misdemeanor occurred in the officer's presence and involves a breach of peace, this is a valid exception to the warrant requirement.

The only option that does not describe a valid circumstance for a warrantless arrest is **Option A**, as it does not specify that the misdemeanor occurred in the officer's presence, which is required for a warrantless arrest in such cases.
