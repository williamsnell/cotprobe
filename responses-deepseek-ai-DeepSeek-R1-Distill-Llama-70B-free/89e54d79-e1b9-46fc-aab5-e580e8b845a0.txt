Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter for causing a vehicular homicide. A grand jury was convened, and various witnesses were subpoenaed. At the grand jury, a witness was asked the following question by the prosecuting attorney: "Is it not true that 20 minutes after the accident you told the police that the defendant's car went through the red light?" He answered, "Yes. "The defendant was also subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. The defendant was represented by counsel at the grand jury hearing. During questioning he was shown the witness's statement from his testimony. No objection was made to the introduction of the witness's statement. At the defendant's trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce into evidence the witness's statement from the deposition taken at the grand jury hearing. The defendant's attorney objects to this proffer of evidence. The objection at trial will be

Options:

A: denied, because the statement was made during a formal legal proceeding and is therefore admissible.
B: granted, because the questioning of the witness was leading.
C: granted, because the statement is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: granted, because the witness's statement could prejudice the jury against the defendant.
E: granted, because the statement was not made under oath.
F: denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the questioning of the witness was leading.
G: denied, because the defendant's attorney did not properly cross-examine the witness at the grand jury hearing.
H: denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the witness's testimony was hearsay.
I: denied, because the defendant was given an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the grand jury hearing.
J: granted, because the witness's statement is irrelevant to the case.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So the situation is a defendant charged with involuntary manslaughter due to a vehicular homicide. A grand jury was convened, and witnesses were subpoenaed. One witness was asked a question by the prosecuting attorney: "Is it not true that 20 minutes after the accident you told the police that the defendant's car went through the red light?" The witness answered yes.

Then, the defendant was also subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury and was represented by counsel there. During questioning, he was shown the witness's statement from his testimony. No objection was made to the introduction of that statement. Now, at the defendant's trial, the prosecutor wants to introduce that witness's statement from the grand jury hearing. The defendant's attorney objects, and we need to determine if the objection is granted or denied and why.

The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

Hmm. So the key issue here is whether the witness's prior statement from the grand jury can be admitted at trial. I remember that hearsay is a big topic in evidence law. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

But wait, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. One of them is the prior statement by a witness who is subject to cross-examination. However, I think that applies more to statements made under oath at a trial or other proceeding where the declarant is testifying and can be cross-examined.

Wait, the grand jury is a different proceeding. The witness's statement was made at the grand jury, which is a formal legal proceeding. But does that make the statement admissible at trial as an exception to hearsay?

Alternatively, I remember that prior inconsistent statements can sometimes be used as substantive evidence if they were made under oath at a prior proceeding. So if the witness made a statement under oath in a deposition or a prior trial, that could be used as substantive evidence under the hearsay exception for prior statements.

Wait, but in this case, the prior statement was made during the grand jury. So the question is, is the grand jury testimony considered a 'prior proceeding' for the purposes of the hearsay exception.

I think the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(1)(A) says that a prior statement by a witness is not hearsay if it was given under oath and subject to cross-examination at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition. So the key is whether the grand jury hearing counts as such a proceeding.

Wait, the grand jury is a different kind of proceeding. It's an investigative body, not a trial. So is testimony before a grand jury considered a 'proceeding' for this exception?

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. I think that generally, grand jury testimony can be used in certain situations, but maybe not as a prior statement exception. Alternatively, maybe it can be used under the hearsay exception for former testimony if the witness is unavailable, but that's not the case here.

Wait, no, the issue here is that the witness is testifying again at trial, and the prosecutor is trying to introduce their prior statement from the grand jury. So it's about whether that prior statement can be used as substantive evidence.

In that case, under FRE 801(d)(1)(A), the prior statement must have been made under oath and subject to cross-examination in a trial, hearing, or other proceeding. So does a grand jury count as a 'proceeding' here?

I recall that a grand jury is a judicial proceeding, but perhaps not in the same way as a trial. So maybe the prior statement could still qualify. But wait, the defendant was present with counsel, so the opportunity for cross-examination was there. But I'm not sure if the grand jury is considered a 'hearing' for this purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is hearsay and doesn't fall under any exception, so it would be inadmissible. Let me think about what the options are.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the objection is granted because it's hearsay not within any exception.

Option A says it's admissible because it was made during a formal legal proceeding.

Option I says it's denied because the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine.

Wait, so in this scenario, the defendant was present with counsel at the grand jury and was shown the witness's statement. But no objection was made to the introduction of the statement. So perhaps the defendant's attorney could have objected on hearsay grounds but didn't, but at trial, the statement's admissibility depends on whether it meets the hearsay exception.

Wait, but the defendant's attorney not objecting at the grand jury wouldn't necessarily waive the hearsay objection at trial because hearsay objections are generally preserved for trial. Unless the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine, which they did, as the defendant was present and represented.

Wait, but under the hearsay rule, if the statement was made in a prior proceeding where the witness was subject to cross-examination, then it's admissible. So if the grand jury is considered a proceeding where the witness was under oath and subject to cross-examination, then the statement would be admissible under 801(d)(1)(A). 

But I'm not 100% certain whether a grand jury qualifies as such a proceeding for this purpose. From what I remember, grand jury testimony can sometimes be used as prior statements for impeachment purposes, but not necessarily as substantive evidence unless it meets the criteria.

Wait, the key is that the prior statement must have been made under oath and in a proceeding where the declarant was subject to cross-examination. So if the grand jury is considered a proceeding where cross-examination was possible, then yes. But in a grand jury, the defendant's attorney can ask questions, so perhaps it counts.

So if that's the case, the statement would be admissible under 801(d)(1)(A), making the objection overruled (denied). But looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says the statement was made during a formal legal proceeding and is admissible. That would align with this reasoning.

Option I says the objection is denied because the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine. That also seems relevant because the defendant was present with counsel, so cross-examination was possible.

Wait, but the admissibility under 801(d)(1)(A) requires that the prior statement was subject to cross-examination. So if the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine, that would satisfy the requirement, making the statement admissible.

So in this case, the objection at trial would be denied because the statement is admissible under the prior statement exception.

Looking back at the options, option C says the objection is granted because it's hearsay without exception. If the statement is admissible under an exception, then option C is incorrect.

So the correct answer would be either A or I.

Option A says it's admissible because it was made during a formal legal proceeding. That's a bit vague. The key is whether it was under oath and subject to cross in a proceeding. So perhaps option I is more accurate because it points out that the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine, which is a key element for the exception.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: the witness's statement at the grand jury is being offered at trial. The defendant was present, represented by counsel, and had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the grand jury. So the statement would be admissible under the prior statement exception, making the objection overruled (denied).

So looking at the options:

Option C says the objection is granted because it's hearsay without exception. But if an exception applies, then C is incorrect.

Option I says the objection is denied because the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine at the grand jury. That seems correct.

Option A says it's admissible because formal proceeding, which is also correct, but perhaps less precise than I.

Hmm, but wait, the exception under 801(d)(1)(A) requires that the statement was made in a proceeding. So the grand jury is a proceeding, and the statement was made under oath, and the defendant had the chance to cross-examine. So under that exception, the statement is not hearsay.

So the objection would be denied because the statement is admissible as a prior statement under oath in a proceeding where cross-examination was possible.

Looking at the options, option I says the objection is denied because the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine at the grand jury. So that would fit.

Alternatively, option A says it's admissible because it's a formal proceeding, which is also correct, but perhaps I is more precise.

Wait, but I don't think the mere fact that it's a formal proceeding is enough. The key is that it's a prior statement under oath in a proceeding with cross-examination opportunity. So option I is more accurate.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C? No, option C says it's granted because it's hearsay without exception, but if the exception applies, then C is wrong.

Wait no, if the exception applies, then the statement is not hearsay, so the objection (which is based on hearsay) would be overruled (denied). So the correct ruling is that the objection is denied, so the options that say denied are A, F, G, H, I.

From the options, the correct reason would be that the statement is admissible under the prior statement exception because it was made under oath in a proceeding where cross-examination was possible.

Looking at the options, option I states that the objection is denied because the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine at the grand jury. That aligns with the exception.

So the correct answer is option C? No, I think I got confused earlier. Let me clarify: if the statement is admissible under an exception, the objection is overruled, meaning the evidence is admitted. So the options that say 'denied' are when the judge allows the evidence, so the objection is denied.

Wait, the question is about whether the objection at trial is granted or denied. So if the statement is hearsay but falls under an exception, the objection is overruled (denied). So the correct choice would be one where the objection is denied because the statement is admissible.

Looking back, option C says the objection is granted because it's hearsay without exception, which would be incorrect if an exception applies.

Option I says the objection is denied because the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine. That would be correct if the exception applies.

So the correct answer is option C: granted because it's hearsay without exception? Or I: denied because opportunity to cross.

Wait no, if the exception applies, the statement is not hearsay, so the objection (which is based on hearsay) is denied. So the correct ruling is that the objection is denied. So the options that say 'denied' are A, F, G, H, I.

But which one gives the correct reason?

Option I says the objection is denied because the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine at the grand jury. That's correct because the prior statement was made under oath in a proceeding where cross-examination was possible, making it admissible under 801(d)(1)(A).

Therefore, the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but another thought: the defendant was shown the witness's statement during the grand jury testimony. Does that matter? Or is that just how the defendant became aware of it? I think that's irrelevant to the admissibility of the statement as a prior statement.

So the key points are:

- Witness's statement at grand jury is being offered at trial.

- The statement is hearsay unless an exception applies.

- The exception for prior statements under 801(d)(1)(A) applies if the statement was under oath in a proceeding where cross-examination was possible.

- Here, the grand jury is a proceeding, the statement was under oath, and the defendant had the chance to cross-examine (as counsel was present and could have done so).

Therefore, the statement is not hearsay and is admissible, so the objection is denied.

Looking at the options, the reason would be that the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine, which is option I.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a witness's prior statement made during a grand jury hearing, which the prosecutor seeks to introduce at trial. The key issue is whether this statement qualifies as hearsay and, if so, whether it falls under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(1)(A), a prior statement by a witness is not considered hearsay if it was made under oath and subject to cross-examination in a trial, hearing, or other proceeding. In this case, the witness's statement was made during a grand jury hearing, which is a formal legal proceeding. The defendant was present with counsel and had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, satisfying the requirements for the prior statement exception under FRE 801(d)(1)(A). Therefore, the statement is admissible as substantive evidence at trial.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While the statement was made during a formal legal proceeding, the admissibility depends on the prior statement exception, not merely the formality of the proceeding.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The question of whether the questioning was leading is irrelevant to the admissibility of the statement as hearsay.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The statement is not hearsay because it falls under the prior statement exception.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no indication that the statement would prejudice the jury.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The statement was made under oath at the grand jury hearing.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The lack of objection at the grand jury hearing does not determine the admissibility of the statement at trial.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The ability to cross-examine at the grand jury hearing is not the determining factor; the key is whether the statement qualifies under the prior statement exception.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The admissibility of the statement is based on the prior statement exception, not the failure to object to hearsay at the grand jury hearing.
- **Option I**: Correct. The objection is denied because the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the grand jury hearing, making the statement admissible under the prior statement exception.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The statement is relevant to the case.

The correct answer is **I**, as the statement is admissible under the prior statement exception due to the opportunity for cross-examination at the grand jury hearing.

Answer: I
