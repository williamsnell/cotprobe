Question:

Cooper is suing March for money damages. Because he believes portions of March's deposition are highly favorable to his case, Cooper's attorney intends to read parts of the deposition at trial instead of calling March to the stand. March objects to Cooper's use of the deposition at trial. What is the court's likely ruling?

Options:

A: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only if he can prove that March's statements are unreliable.
B: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only if March's attorney is present during the reading.
C: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as it is considered hearsay.
D: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as this would make March his witness and immune to impeachment.
E: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but must read the entire deposition, not just selected parts.
F: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as it would violate March's right to confrontation.
G: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only to contradict or impeach March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings.
H: Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.
I: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, unless March is unavailable to testify.
J: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with depositions and their use at trial. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the scenario is Cooper is suing March for money damages. Cooper's attorney wants to use parts of March's deposition at trial instead of calling March as a witness. March objects. The question is about how the court would rule on this.

I remember that depositions can be used at trial under certain circumstances. I think the key here is the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 32, which deals with depositions.

Wait, Rule 32 says that a deposition can be used if the witness is unavailable, but there's an exception when the deposition was taken for discovery and the witness is available. Oh right, but for a party's own deposition, especially when you're a party in the case, there might be different rules.

Wait, Cooper is the plaintiff, and March is the defendant. So March is a party here. I remember that depositions of parties can be used more freely. Specifically, under Rule 32(a)(2), a deposition of a party doesn't require a showing of unavailability. So the fact that March is available to testify doesn't prevent Cooper from using the deposition.

So Cooper's attorney can use the deposition at trial without March being unavailable. But wait, are there any other conditions? Like, do you have to read the whole thing or can you pick parts?

I think there's another rule about how much you have to read. If a party uses part of a deposition, the other side can require them to read any other parts that are relevant for fairness. So if Cooper reads parts, March's attorney might ask him to read more, but Cooper isn't compelled to do so unless requested.

Looking at the options now. Option H says Cooper may use the deposition but must read all parts that are fair to consider. So that aligns with the idea that, upon request, you have to include relevant parts for context.

Option I says Cooper can't use unless March is unavailable, which isn't the case here because March is available. So I is incorrect.

Option E says must read the entire deposition. No, that's not right because you can use portions, but you might have to include more if fairness requires it.

Option J says Cooper can't use because March can testify and no exceptional circumstances. But since March is a party, Cooper can use the deposition regardless of availability.

Option G talks about using it only to impeach, but I don't think that's the case here. The question states that the deposition is favorable, so it's being offered for the truth of the matter, not just to impeach.

Option H seems correct. Cooper can use the deposition, but if asked, he has to read the parts that are necessary for fairness. So the court would likely rule that way.

Wait, but is there a hearsay issue? Depositions are generally not hearsay because they're testimony under oath. So option C is incorrect because it's not hearsay.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H. Cooper can use the deposition but must include other parts if needed for fairness upon request.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a deposition at trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 32. Cooper, the plaintiff, seeks to use portions of March's deposition at trial without calling March as a witness. March objects, arguing against the use of the deposition. 

Under Rule 32(a)(2), a party's own deposition can be used at trial without requiring a showing of unavailability. This means that March's availability to testify does not bar Cooper from using the deposition. Additionally, while a party may use selected portions of a deposition, Rule 32(b) allows the opposing party to request that additional parts be read to ensure fairness and context. Therefore, Cooper may use the deposition but must include other relevant parts if requested.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, F, G, I, J**: These options are incorrect because they either misstate the rules regarding unavailability, hearsay, or impeachment or impose unnecessary restrictions on the use of the deposition.
- **E**: Incorrect because Cooper is not required to read the entire deposition unless requested.
- **C**: Incorrect because depositions are not considered hearsay as they are sworn testimony.
- **H**: Correct because it aligns with the rule that Cooper may use the deposition but must read additional parts if fairness requires it.

Thus, the court is likely to rule that Cooper may use the deposition at trial but must read all parts that, in fairness, ought to be considered with the part introduced if requested.
