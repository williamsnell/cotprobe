Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Gauthier's claims on moral agreements. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that David Gauthier is a philosopher known for his work in ethics and political philosophy. I think he's associated with contractarianism, which is the idea that moral principles are based on agreements among rational individuals. So the question is about why Gauthier finds certain moral agreements desirable.

The question states that Gauthier claims moral agreements that are equally favorable to all parties are desirable because they... and then there are several options. I need to figure out which one aligns with his views.

Let me recall his main arguments. I remember that Gauthier's book "Morals by Agreement" presents a contractarian approach. In it, he argues that rational individuals would agree to certain moral principles because it's in their self-interest. The idea is that moral rules are solutions to coordination problems that help individuals achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.

So, if the agreements are equally favorable to all parties, why would that be desirable? Well, contractarianism often focuses on mutual benefit and fairness. If everyone benefits equally, it's more likely that all parties would agree to the arrangement because it's fair and serves their interests.

Looking at the options:

A: Promote a sense of community and unity. That sounds more like a communitarian perspective, not necessarily Gauthier's contractarian approach.

B: Satisfy our desire for fairness. This seems plausible because fairness is a key component in agreements. If everyone is treated equally, it's fair, and people would desire that.

C: Fulfill the basic needs of all parties. Not sure. I think Gauthier is more about rational self-interest than basic needs.

D: Promote the principle of equality. While equality is related, I think the focus is more on fairness and mutual benefit rather than equality for its own sake.

E: Maximize the productivity of society. Productivity might be a side effect, but I don't think that's the primary reason Gauthier gives.

F: Ensure the preservation of individual rights. That sounds more like a libertarian view, which might not be Gauthier's main point here.

G: Increase the overall happiness of society. This is more utilitarian, and Gauthier isn't a utilitarian; his approach is based on rational agreement rather than maximizing happiness.

So, narrowing it down, the options that stand out are B and D. But I think Gauthier's argument is more about fairness. In his view, moral agreements are those that rational individuals would accept because they're fair and beneficial to everyone involved. So option B, satisfying our desire for fairness, makes sense.

Wait, but another angle: Gauthier's idea of "equally favorable" might relate to the concept of justice as fairness, as in Rawls. But Gauthier's approach is different; he focuses on rational choice and mutual advantage. So the agreements are desirable because they ensure that no one is taken advantage of, which ties back to fairness.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B: satisfy our desire for fairness.

The question asks about Gauthier's view on why moral agreements equally favorable to all parties are desirable. Gauthier, a contractarian, argues that such agreements arise from rational self-interest and mutual benefit. Among the options, fairness stands out as the key reason, aligning with the idea that such agreements satisfy the desire for fairness because they ensure mutual benefit without exploitation.

Answer: B
