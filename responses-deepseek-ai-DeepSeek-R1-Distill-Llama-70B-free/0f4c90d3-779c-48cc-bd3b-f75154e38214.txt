C: unethical if it is related to sensitive topics.
D: ethical as long as students are free to choose the research project they participate in.
E: ethical only if students are given class credit for participating.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the ethics of requiring psychology students to participate in research projects. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully.

The question is asking whether it's ethical for students to be required to participate in one of the university's ongoing research projects as part of their introductory psychology class. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in psychology, ethical guidelines are really important, especially when it comes to human subjects. I think one of the key principles is informed consent. People should know what they're getting into and agree to it without being coerced.

Wait, but in this case, the students are required to participate. So does that count as coercion? If they're forced to take part as a class requirement, maybe that's a problem because they don't have a choice. Or is it okay as long as they can choose which project they're part of?

Looking at the options, option A says it's ethical as long as students aren't forced. But the question says they're required, so that might not fit. Option D says it's ethical if they can choose the project. I'm not sure if choice of project makes it ethical or not. I think the main issue is whether participation is mandatory.

Option G suggests it's ethical if they can choose an alternative activity. That sounds better because it gives students an option. So instead of participating in a study, they might do something else, like a paper or another assignment. That way, they're not forced into the research.

Option H mentions informed consent. That's definitely important. But even with consent, if the participation is mandatory, it might still be unethical because the students feel they have no choice. So H alone might not be sufficient.

What about the other options? Option E talks about class credit. I don't think getting credit automatically makes it ethical. It's more about the choice and informed consent. Option B is about sharing results, which is a good practice, but not directly related to the ethics of requiring participation.

Option C is about sensitive topics. That's a consideration, but the question doesn't specify the nature of the research. Option I is about compensation. I don't think compensation is required for such participation, especially if it's part of their education.

Option J says it's clearly unethical. But I think it's not that clear-cut. It depends on the conditions. If students can opt out or choose an alternative, then it might be acceptable.

So putting it together, the key factors are whether students are forced, whether they have alternatives, and whether they consent. If they can choose an alternative activity, that makes the requirement ethical because they aren't forced into the research specifically. So option G seems correct.

The ethical consideration here revolves around student autonomy and informed consent. Requiring participation in research raises concerns about coercion unless students have the option to choose an alternative activity. Option G correctly identifies that allowing students to opt for an alternative ensures the practice remains ethical, as it respects their autonomy and provides a choice.

Answer: G
