Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this syllogism question. Hmm, I remember syllogisms are a form of logical reasoning with two premises and a conclusion. The question is about a hypothetical syllogism, which I think involves conditional statements, like "If P then Q."

The question says that the minor premise affirms the antecedent. Wait, let me break that down. In a conditional statement (the major premise), the antecedent is the "if" part, and the consequent is the "then" part. So if the major premise is "If P, then Q," then P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.

The minor premise is the second statement. If it affirms the antecedent, that means it's stating that P is true. So the minor premise would be "P is true." 

In syllogistic terms, when you have a conditional (major premise) and you affirm the antecedent in the minor premise, what conclusion follows? I think this is called modus ponens. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument where if P implies Q and P is true, then Q must be true. So the conclusion would affirm the consequent, which is Q.

Wait, but let me double-check. The options are A through D. The options are about what the conclusion must do. So option B says the conclusion must affirm the consequent. That matches with modus ponens, right? So the answer should be B.

Wait, but what if I'm mixing things up? Like, denying the antecedent would lead to something else. Oh right, if the minor premise denies the antecedent (says not P), that's called modus tollens, and the conclusion would deny the consequent (not Q). But that's not the case here since the minor premise affirms the antecedent.

So in this case, the conclusion must affirm the consequent, which is option B. So I think the correct answer is B.

In a hypothetical syllogism, when the minor premise affirms the antecedent, the conclusion must affirm the consequent. This is based on the logical rule of modus ponens, where if "If P, then Q" is the major premise and the minor premise affirms P, the conclusion logically follows as Q. 

Answer: B
