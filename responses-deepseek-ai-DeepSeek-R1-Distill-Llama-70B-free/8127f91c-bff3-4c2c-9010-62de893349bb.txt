Question:

Find the mode or modes of the sample 6, 7, 7, 3, 8, 5, 3, 9.

Options:

A: No mode
B: 6, 7, and 8
C: 7 only
D: 6 and 9
E: 6 and 8
F: 6, 7, and 3
G: 5 and 9
H: 3 only
I: 3 and 7
J: 8 and 9

Okay, so I've got this question about finding the mode of a sample. The sample given is the numbers 6, 7, 7, 3, 8, 5, 3, 9. Hmm, I remember that the mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. If all numbers appear the same number of times, then there's no mode. And if multiple numbers have the highest frequency, they're all modes.

Let me break this down. I'll list out each number and count how many times each occurs.

Looking at the sample: 6 comes once. 7 appears twice. 3 appears twice as well. 8 appears once, 5 once, 9 once. So the counts are:

6: 1
7: 2
3: 2
8: 1
5: 1
9: 1

So both 7 and 3 occur twice, which is more than any other number. That means both are modes. Wait, but wait—I thought the mode is the most frequent. So in this case, since 3 and 7 each have two occurrences, and no other number has more than that, they are both modes.

Now looking at the options, option I says "3 and 7". So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check the options to make sure.

Options:
A: No mode → No, because we have two modes.
B: 6,7,8 → No, they appear once.
C:7 only → No, 3 also appears twice.
D:6 and9 → No, they only appear once.
E:6 and8 → No.
F:6,7,3 → No, 6 appears once.
G:5 and9 → No, once each.
H:3 only → No, 7 is also mode.
I:3 and7 → Yes, correct.
J:8 and9 → No.

So the correct answer is I.

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a dataset. In the sample 6, 7, 7, 3, 8, 5, 3, 9, the numbers 3 and 7 each appear twice, which is more frequent than any other number. Therefore, both 3 and 7 are modes.

Option I correctly identifies the modes as 3 and 7.

Answer: I
