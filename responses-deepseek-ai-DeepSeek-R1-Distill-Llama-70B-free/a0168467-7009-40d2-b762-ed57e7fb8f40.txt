Okay, so I have this problem where Alex needs to borrow $10,000 from the bank. There are two loan options, and I need to find the positive difference between the total amounts he has to pay back under each scheme. The options are A through J, and I think the correct answer is one of them, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think through each step carefully.

First, let me understand the two options.

Option 1: It's a ten-year loan with an annual interest rate of 10% compounded quarterly. But there's a condition. After 5 years, Alex must make a payment equal to half of what he owes at that point. The remaining half continues to accrue interest, and then he'll pay off the rest at the end of ten years.

Option 2: A ten-year loan with a simple annual interest rate of 12%, and he just makes one lump-sum payment at the end of the ten years.

So I need to calculate the total amount Alex would pay under each option and then find the positive difference between these two totals.

Starting with Option 2 because it seems simpler. Simple interest is calculated as Principal * Rate * Time. So the interest would be 10,000 * 0.12 * 10. Let me compute that.

Wait, 10,000 * 0.12 is 1,200 a year. Over ten years, that's 1,200 * 10 = 12,000. So the total to pay back is the principal plus interest: 10,000 + 12,000 = $22,000.

Wait, but wait. For simple interest loans, yes, that's correct. So the total is $22,000.

Now, the more complicated part is Option 1. Let's break it down.

Option 1 is a 10-year loan, 10% annual interest, compounded quarterly. So the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($10,000).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 0.10).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (quarterly means 4 times a year).
- t is the time in years.

But there's a twist: after 5 years, Alex pays half of what he owes. The remaining half continues to accrue interest for the next 5 years, and then he pays it all off.

So I think I need to compute two parts: the amount owed after 5 years, then the payment after 5 years, and then the amount owed on the remaining part after another 5 years.

Let me structure this step by step.

Step 1: Compute the amount owed after 5 years with quarterly compounding.

P is $10,000, r is 0.10, n is 4, t is 5.

A = 10000 * (1 + 0.10/4)^(4*5).

Let me compute 0.10/4 first. 0.10 divided by 4 is 0.025.

4*5 is 20, so the exponent is 20.

So A = 10000 * (1.025)^20.

I need to calculate (1.025)^20. Hmm, I think I can approximate this. Alternatively, using logarithms or remembering that (1.025)^20 is approximately 1.6386... Wait, I think the exact value is approximately 1.63861644.

Wait, let me check: 1.025^20.

I know that 1.025^4 is about 1.10381289 (since (1.025)^4 = approx 1.1038).

Then 1.1038^5, because 20 is 4*5.

Wait, no, that approach might not be precise. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step or use a formula.

Alternatively, I can use the rule of 72 or other methods, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of logarithms. Alternatively, I can use a calculator approximation.

But since I don't have a calculator here, I'll proceed with the approximation that (1.025)^20 ≈ 1.6386.

So A after 5 years is 10,000 * 1.6386 = 16,386.

Wait, but that's approximate. Let me see if that's correct.

Alternatively, using the formula exactly:

(1.025)^20 = e^(20 * ln(1.025)).

ln(1.025) is approximately 0.02469.

So 20 * 0.02469 = 0.4938.

e^0.4938 is approximately 1.6386. So yes, that's correct.

So A is $16,386 after 5 years.

So at this point, Alex has to pay half of what he owes. Half of 16,386 is 8,193. So he pays $8,193 after 5 years. The remaining $8,193 continues to accumulate interest for the next 5 years.

Now, for the next 5 years, the same interest terms apply: 10% annual rate, compounded quarterly. So the amount due after another 5 years will be 8,193 * (1 + 0.10/4)^(4*5).

Again, (1.025)^20 = 1.6386, so 8,193 * 1.6386.

Let me compute that.

8,193 * 1.6386.

Let me break it down:

8,000 * 1.6386 = 8,000 * 1.6386 = 13,108.8.

193 * 1.6386: Let's compute 200 * 1.6386 = 327.72, then subtract 7 * 1.6386 (which is 11.47), so 327.72 - 11.47 = 316.25. So 193 is approximately 316.25.

So total is 13,108.8 + 316.25 = 13,425.05.

Wait, but I'm approximating. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 8,193 * 1.6386:

First, let's compute 8,193 * 1 = 8,193.

8,193 * 0.6 = 4,915.8

8,193 * 0.03 = 245.79

8,193 * 0.0086 = approximately 8,193 * 0.008 = 65.544, and 8,193 * 0.0006= approx 4.9158. So total 65.544 + 4.9158 ≈ 70.4598.

So adding all together:

8,193 + 4,915.8 = 13,108.8

13,108.8 + 245.79 = 13,354.59

13,354.59 + 70.4598 ≈ 13,425.05.

So approximately $13,425.05 after the next 5 years.

So the total amount Alex pays under Option 1 is the payment after 5 years plus the payment after 10 years.

So $8,193 + $13,425.05 = $21,618.05.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations for the first 5 years.

Wait, let me recalculate A after 5 years more accurately. Because maybe my approximation of 1.6386 was a bit off. Let me compute (1.025)^20 accurately.

Let me compute step by step.

(1.025)^1 = 1.025

^2 = 1.025 * 1.025 = 1.050625

^3 = 1.050625 * 1.025 = Let's compute 1.050625 * 1.025.

1.050625 * 1 = 1.050625

1.050625 * 0.025 = 0.026265625

So sum is 1.050625 + 0.026265625 = 1.076890625

^4: 1.076890625 * 1.025.

Compute 1.076890625 * 1 = 1.076890625

1.076890625 * 0.025 = 0.026922265625

Adding, we get 1.076890625 + 0.026922265625 ≈ 1.1038128906

So after 4 quarters, it's 1.1038128906.

Now, ^5: multiply by 1.025 again.

1.1038128906 * 1.025

Compute as:

1.1038128906 * 1 = 1.1038128906

1.1038128906 * 0.025 = 0.02759532226

Sum is approximately 1.1314082129.

Wait, this is getting tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with precise calculation, but maybe I can note that (1.025)^20 is approximately 1.6386164155, as per precise calculation. So the amount after 5 years is 10000 * 1.6386164155 = 16,386.164155 ≈ $16,386.16.

So after 5 years, he owes approximately $16,386.16.

He pays half, which is 16,386.16 / 2 = 8,193.08.

So the remaining amount is $8,193.08.

Now, this amount will accrue interest for another 5 years, so again, using the same formula.

A = 8,193.08 * (1 + 0.10/4)^(4*5) = 8,193.08 * (1.025)^20.

We already know (1.025)^20 is approximately 1.6386164155.

So A = 8,193.08 * 1.6386164155.

Calculating this:

Let me compute 8,193.08 * 1.6386164155.

First, 8,000 * 1.6386164155 = 8,000 * 1.6386164155.

8,000 * 1 = 8,000.

8,000 * 0.6386164155 = 8,000 * 0.6 = 4,800; 8,000 * 0.0386164155 = approx 8,000 * 0.0386 = 308.8. So total 4,800 + 308.8 = 5,108.8.

So 8,000 * 1.6386164155 ≈ 8,000 + 5,108.8 = 13,108.8.

Now, 193.08 * 1.6386164155.

Compute 193 * 1.6386164155.

Let me compute 200 * 1.638616 = 327.9232, then subtract 7 * 1.638616.

7 * 1.638616 = approx 11.470332.

So 327.9232 - 11.470332 ≈ 316.452868.

So 193 * 1.638616 ≈ 316.45.

Adding the 0.08 * 1.638616: 0.08 * 1.638616 ≈ 0.1311.

So total is 316.45 + 0.1311 ≈ 316.5811.

So 193.08 * 1.638616 ≈ 316.5811.

So the total A is 13,108.8 + 316.5811 ≈ 13,425.3811.

So approximately $13,425.38.

So the total amount Alex pays under Option 1 is the payment at 5 years, $8,193.08, plus the payment at 10 years, $13,425.38.

So 8,193.08 + 13,425.38 = 21,618.46.

Wait, wait, that's approximately $21,618.46.

But wait, let me double-check the math.

Wait, 8,193.08 + 13,425.38 = 21,618.46. So about $21,618.46.

Now, Option 2's total is $22,000. So the difference is 22,000 - 21,618.46 = 381.54. So approximately $381.54. The question asks for the positive difference, so it's about $381.54. Rounding to the nearest dollar, that would be $382.

Wait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, in Option 1, after 5 years, Alex pays half, which is 8,193.08, and the remaining 8,193.08 is what's left. Then, over the next 5 years, that amount grows to 13,425.38. So total paid is 8,193.08 + 13,425.38 = 21,618.46.

Option 2 is 22,000, so the difference is 22,000 - 21,618.46 = 381.54. So positive difference is $381.54. Rounded to the nearest dollar is $382.

Looking at the options, option D is 382.

Wait, but let me check if I'm correct about the calculation for the remaining amount after 5 years.

Wait, wait a second. Another way to compute the amount after the second 5 years: Maybe I should compute it precisely as 8,193.08 * (1.025)^20.

Let me compute 8,193.08 * 1.6386164155.

Compute 8,193.08 * 1.6386164155:

8,193.08 * 1.6386164155 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

Let me compute 8,193.08 * 1.6386164155.

But I think I did that correctly before, getting to approximately 13,425.38.

Hmm, but let me think about whether I'm supposed to pay exactly half each time or not.

Wait, the problem states that at the end of 5 years, Alex makes a payment equal to half of what he owes. So if the amount owed is A, he pays A/2, and the remaining A/2 continues.

So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first calculation of the amount after 5 years.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.025)^20 more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it using more precise steps.

Let me compute (1.025)^20 more accurately.

We can compute (1.025)^20 using logarithms.

ln(1.025) ≈ 0.02469.

20 * 0.02469 = 0.4938.

e^0.4938 = approx 1.6386.

But perhaps a better approximation of e^0.4938.

We know that e^0.5 is about 1.64872. So 0.4938 is slightly less than 0.5, so e^0.4938 is slightly less than 1.64872.

Compute 0.4938: the difference from 0.5 is 0.0062.

Using the Taylor series for e^x around x=0.5:

e^(0.5 - 0.0062) = e^0.5 * e^(-0.0062).

e^(-0.0062) ≈ 1 - 0.0062 + (0.0062)^2/2 - ...

Which is approximately 1 - 0.0062 + 0.000019 = 0.99382.

So e^0.4938 ≈ 1.64872 * 0.99382 ≈ 1.64872 * (1 - 0.00618) ≈ 1.64872 - (1.64872 * 0.00618).

1.64872 * 0.00618 ≈ 0.01020.

So 1.64872 - 0.01020 ≈ 1.63852.

So (1.025)^20 ≈ 1.638616, as I had before. So the initial calculation was correct.

So the amount after 5 years is 10,000 * 1.638616 ≈ 16,386.16.

So, half is 8,193.08.

Then, the remaining 8,193.08 grows for another 5 years, leading to 8,193.08 * 1.638616 ≈ 13,425.38.

So total payment for Option 1 is 8,193.08 + 13,425.38 = 21,618.46.

Option 2 is 22,000, so the difference is 22,000 - 21,618.46 = 381.54, which rounds to $382.

Looking at the options, D is 382. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I should check if I made any mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximation for (1.025)^20.

Let me compute it more precisely.

Using the formula:

(1.025)^20 = e^(20 * ln(1.025)).

Compute ln(1.025):

Using Taylor series for ln(1+x) around x=0: x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ...

x = 0.025.

So ln(1.025) = 0.025 - (0.025)^2/2 + (0.025)^3/3 - (0.025)^4/4 + ...

Compute each term:

0.025 = 0.025.

(0.025)^2 = 0.000625; divided by 2, that's 0.0003125.

(0.025)^3 = 0.000015625; divided by 3, approx 0.0000052083.

(0.025)^4 = 0.000000390625; divided by 4, approx 0.000000097656.

So ln(1.025) ≈ 0.025 - 0.0003125 + 0.0000052083 - 0.000000097656 ≈ 0.02469265.

So 20 * ln(1.025) ≈ 20 * 0.02469265 ≈ 0.493853.

Now compute e^0.493853.

We can compute this using the Taylor series expansion around 0.493853.

But perhaps it's easier to use known values.

We know that e^0.49 ≈ let's see, e^0.4 is 1.49182, e^0.49:

Compute e^0.49:

We can compute it using e^0.
