Question:

Two friends were members of a fraternity at their college. During homecoming weekend, the fraternity held a big party, which was widely attended by students and alumni. At the party, the two friends were horsing around when the first friend pulled out a revolver. He gave the revolver's cylinder a spin, put the barrel of the gun to the second friend's head and, intending to scare the second friend, said, "Hey, man, let's play Russian roulette. " The second friend, who had consumed a fifth of bourbon, was very intoxicated. Thinking that the gun was unloaded, the second friend responded, "Sure, dude. " The first friend then pulled the trigger. The gun just made a clicking sound as the hammer fell on an empty chamber of the cylinder. The two friends both laughed and continued partying. Unbeknownst to the second friend, the first friend had placed bullets in two of the revolver's six firing chambers before making his challenge. The next day, the second friend found out that the gun was, in fact, loaded when the first friend pulled the trigger. If the second friend asserts a tort action against the first friend, he will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the first friend intended to place the second friend in apprehension.
B: prevail, because the first friend showed gross negligence.
C: not prevail, because there was no physical harm inflicted on the second friend.
D: prevail, because the first friend's actions were reckless and dangerous.
E: prevail, because there was a substantial certainty that the second friend would be placed in apprehension.
F: not prevail, because the second friend was unaware that the gun was loaded.
G: not prevail, because the first friend did not actually intend to harm the second friend.
H: not prevail, because the second friend consented to participate in the Russian roulette game.
I: not prevail, because the second friend was under the influence of alcohol.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically regarding a situation where two friends play Russian roulette, and I need to figure out what the legal outcome would be if the second friend sues the first. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the facts. Two friends are at a fraternity party during homecoming. The first friend pulls out a revolver, spins the cylinder, puts it to the second friend's head, and suggests playing Russian roulette. The second friend is very intoxicated, having consumed a fifth of bourbon, and thinks the gun is unloaded, so he agrees. The first friend pulls the trigger, and it clicks—thankfully, an empty chamber. They both laugh and continue partying. The next day, the second friend finds out that the gun was actually loaded with two bullets in six chambers. Now, he's suing his friend in tort.

So the question is about whether the second friend can prevail in a tort action against the first friend. The options are from A to I, and I need to choose the correct one.

I remember that torts can involve various theories like negligence, intentional torts, or recklessness. Let me think about each possibility here.

First, the main issue seems to be whether the first friend committed an intentional tort or was negligent. The friends were horsing around, and the first friend intended to scare the second. So, he pulled out a loaded gun, which is a dangerous act. But the second friend didn't know the gun was loaded and thought it was unloaded. The first friend had two bullets in the six chambers, so there was a 1/3 chance of the gun going off if all chambers were considered, but in this case, it didn't fire.

I think the key here is to determine which tort applies. Let's consider possible torts:

1. **Assault**: An intentional tort that involves causing apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. The elements are intent, apprehension, and imminence. The first friend intended to scare the second, so he had the intent. But did the second friend actually experience apprehension? Wait, the second friend was intoxicated and thought the gun was unloaded, so he didn't feel afraid at the time. However, after finding out the gun was loaded, he might have suffered emotional distress, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for assault since assault is about the apprehension at the time of the act.

2. **Battery**: This is intentional harmful or offensive contact. Here, there was no actual contact because the gun didn't fire. So battery doesn't apply here.

3. **Negligence**: The first friend was acting recklessly by loading the gun and pointing it, which could be considered negligence. But negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages. The second friend didn't suffer physical harm, only emotional distress, which is usually not enough for negligence unless it's a case of negligent infliction of emotional distress, which typically requires physical harm or a specific situation like a duty to rescue.

4. **Recklessness**: If the first friend acted recklessly, that might support a claim for reckless conduct. Reckless disregard for the safety of others can sometimes be a basis for liability, even without intent to cause harm.

Wait, but the first friend intended to create apprehension, which is an element of assault. However, for assault, the victim must actually perceive the threat. Here, the second friend thought the gun was unloaded, so he didn't feel any apprehension at the time. So does that mean there was no assault because the apprehension wasn't present?

Alternatively, could it be an assault if the first friend took an action that would cause a reasonable person to feel apprehension, regardless of the victim's state of mind? Or does the victim's subjective apprehension matter?

I think in tort law, the victim's subjective apprehension is key for assault. So if the second friend didn't feel any fear because he thought the gun was unloaded, he didn't experience apprehension. Therefore, assault might not apply because the second friend didn't actually feel threatened at the time.

Then, what about intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED)? IIED requires intentional or reckless extreme and outrageous conduct, causing severe emotional distress. Here, the first friend intended to scare him, but the second friend didn't feel scared because he was drunk and thought it was unloaded. So maybe IIED isn't applicable either.

What about negligence? The first friend was negligent in handling a loaded gun. But since there was no physical harm, it's hard to see how negligence would apply here. The second friend didn't suffer any physical injury, so damages might be an issue.

Wait, but the second friend could argue that the first friend's actions were so reckless that it constitutes recklessness as a basis for IIED. Alternatively, maybe the first friend's act was reckless, and the second friend can claim for the emotional distress he experienced upon learning the gun was loaded.

But I think IIED typically requires that the distress be severe, like leading to physical symptoms, and that the conduct was so outrageous. Also, the distress must result from the defendant's actions. In this case, the immediate reaction was laughing, but the next day, the second friend found out and perhaps felt distress then. But I'm not sure if that's enough for IIED.

Another angle: the first friend committed an assault even if the second friend didn't feel fear at the time, but perhaps a reasonable person would have. But I think the majority rule is that the victim must have actually felt apprehension. So without that, it's not assault.

Alternatively, maybe the first friend's act of pointing a loaded gun could be considered an assault because it created an imminent threat, regardless of the victim's perception. But I think that's a minority view. The Restatement (Second) of Torts §21(1) says that assault requires that the victim has the apprehension. So without the victim being aware, maybe it's not assault.

Wait, but some jurisdictions might consider that the act itself is enough if it's inherently dangerous, even if the victim didn't perceive it. I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but I think the traditional view requires the victim's apprehension.

So if assault isn't applicable because the second friend didn't feel fear, then what about recklessness? Maybe the first friend was reckless in handling a loaded firearm, which is a dangerous instrumentality, and that could give rise to liability under a theory of recklessness leading to emotional distress.

Alternatively, could this be a case of negligent handling of a firearm, leading to potential liability? Some states have specific laws about handling firearms negligently, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, another thought: when the first friend pulled the trigger, he was acting with the intent to place the second friend in apprehension. So that's an intentional tort—specifically, assault. But since the second friend didn't feel apprehension, maybe it's not assault, but could it be attempted assault? But no, because the act was completed.

Alternatively, maybe the first friend's act was so reckless that it constitutes a battery by causing offensive contact, but again, there was no contact because the gun didn't fire.

Wait, another approach: the first friend took an action that he intended to cause apprehension, but the second friend didn't perceive it. So perhaps the first friend is not liable for assault because the second friend didn't feel fear. But the first friend's act was still reckless, which could make him liable for another tort.

Looking at the options, option D says "prevail, because the first friend's actions were reckless and dangerous." So if the court finds that the first friend acted recklessly, the second friend could recover under a theory of recklessness.

Alternatively, option E is about substantial certainty of apprehension. Since the second friend didn't actually feel apprehension, E might not apply.

Option A says prevail because the first friend intended to cause apprehension. But if the second friend didn't feel it, then A might not work unless the intent is enough without the apprehension, which I don't think is the case.

Option B says prevail because of gross negligence. Gross negligence could support a claim, but again, without physical harm, it's tricky. But IIED or another tort might require more than just negligence.

Option D is about recklessness. If the first friend's actions were reckless, then the second friend could argue that the first friend's recklessness caused him emotional distress, perhaps under a theory of reckless infliction of emotional distress, but I'm not sure if that's a recognized tort.

Wait, IIED requires intent to cause distress or recklessness with the knowledge that distress would result. The first friend intended to scare him, but the second friend didn't feel scared because he was drunk. So maybe the first friend didn't subjectively foresee that the second friend would experience distress later. Alternatively, the first friend was reckless in handling a loaded gun, which a reasonable person would know could cause severe emotional distress if the bullet fired or if the victim later found out.

But in this case, the gun didn't fire, and the second friend only found out the next day. So perhaps he can claim for the emotional distress caused by the realization that he could have been killed.

But I'm not sure if that's a basis for a claim. The traditional rule is that without physical injury, it's hard to recover for pure emotional distress. However, some cases allow recovery when the defendant's actions were particularly egregious and caused severe distress.

But looking at the options, option D seems to suggest that the first friend's actions were reckless and dangerous, which could support a claim. Alternatively, option E says there was a substantial certainty of apprehension. But since the second friend didn't actually feel it, maybe E isn't correct.

Wait, another thought: even if the second friend didn't feel apprehension at the time, the first friend's act was so dangerous that it could be considered an assault regardless. But I think that's not how the law works; assault requires the victim's apprehension.

So perhaps the second friend can't claim assault, but can claim negligence or recklessness leading to emotional distress. But again, without physical harm, it's tough.

Alternatively, maybe the first friend's action was an assault because he intended to cause an apprehension, and the fact that the second friend didn't feel it because he was intoxicated doesn't matter. But I don't think that's the case because the victim's state of mind is what determines apprehension.

Wait, but maybe the first friend's actions were so inherently dangerous that it's an assault regardless of the victim's perception. I'm not sure about that. I think the majority view requires the victim to have a subjective apprehension.

So perhaps the correct answer is that the second friend cannot prevail because he didn't experience apprehension at the time, so no assault. Or because he wasn't physically harmed, so no negligence.

Looking at the options, option C says not prevail because no physical harm. Option F says not prevail because the second friend was unaware the gun was loaded, so no apprehension.

But wait, option D is about recklessness. So if the first friend acted recklessly, perhaps the second friend can recover for the emotional distress caused by the reckless act, even without physical harm.

Alternatively, the first friend's act was so reckless that it's considered willful and wanton conduct, leading to liability for emotional distress.

I think the answer might be D: prevail because the first friend's actions were reckless and dangerous. Recklessness in torts can sometimes be enough to impose liability, especially when the conduct is inherently dangerous, like handling a loaded gun.

Alternatively, option E is about substantial certainty of apprehension. But the second friend didn't have that, so E doesn't apply.

Another angle: when the first friend pulled the trigger, he acted with the intent to cause the second friend to fear imminent harm, but the second friend didn't perceive it because he was intoxicated. However, the first friend's intent is clear, but the second friend's state of mind is also a factor.

So maybe the correct answer is F: not prevail because the second friend was unaware the gun was loaded. Because without awareness, there's no apprehension, so no assault.

But wait, the first friend's actions were still reckless, so perhaps the second friend can sue for recklessness causing emotional distress. But I'm not certain if that's a valid claim without physical harm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first friend's act constitutes battery because the gun was loaded, and he pulled the trigger, but the chamber was empty. However, battery requires harmful or offensive contact. Since the gun didn't fire, there was no contact, so no battery.

So perhaps the second friend can't recover because he didn't suffer any physical harm, and he didn't experience apprehension at the time, so no assault. Therefore, option C says he won't prevail because no physical harm. But I'm not sure if that's the case because sometimes emotional distress can be a basis for damages without physical harm, but it's limited.

Wait, another thought: under the doctrine of transferred intent, could the first friend's intent to cause fear be transferred to another tort? But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the first friend's act was an assault, but the second friend didn't perceive it, so he can't recover. Or perhaps the first friend is liable for reckless conduct, regardless of the second friend's perception.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: prevail because first friend intended to cause apprehension. But without the second friend feeling it, maybe this doesn't hold.

Option B: prevail because of gross negligence. Gross negligence could be a basis, but without physical harm, it's unclear.

Option C: not prevail because no physical harm. But maybe emotional distress counts, but usually, you need more.

Option D: prevail because actions were reckless and dangerous. This seems plausible because handling a loaded gun is inherently dangerous, and the first friend acted recklessly.

Option E: prevail because substantial certainty of apprehension. But the second friend didn't have that.

Option F: not prevail because second friend was unaware. So no apprehension.

Option G: not prevail because first friend didn't intend to harm. But he intended to scare, which is an intent to cause apprehension, not necessarily to harm.

Option H: not prevail because second friend consented. He agreed to play, but he thought the gun was unloaded. So maybe he didn't consent to a loaded gun. So H might not be correct.

Option I: not prevail because he was intoxicated. But his intoxication might negate his ability to consent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the second friend was very intoxicated and thought the gun was unloaded, so when he agreed, he didn't consent to a loaded gun. Therefore, H might not apply.

So, considering all this, I think the most plausible answer is D: the first friend's actions were reckless and dangerous, so the second friend would prevail.

Alternatively, if the court finds that the first friend's actions were so reckless as to constitute an assault, even without the second friend's apprehension, but I'm not certain about that.

Another angle: some jurisdictions allow for assault when the defendant's actions would cause a reasonable person to apprehend imminent harm, regardless of the victim's actual state of mind. So if the first friend pointed a loaded gun at the second's head and pulled the trigger, a reasonable person would feel apprehension, even if the second friend, due to intoxication, didn't. In such a case, the first friend could be liable for assault because the act itself was sufficient to create apprehension in a reasonable person.

If that's the case, then the answer would be A or E. Option E says "substantial certainty that the second friend would be placed in apprehension." But the second friend didn't actually feel it because he was drunk. So does that matter?

I think the traditional rule is that the victim's apprehension is subjective, so without it, there's no assault. But some modern approaches might focus on whether a reasonable person would have felt apprehension. So if the first friend's action was such that a reasonable person would have been in apprehension, then it's assault regardless of the victim's state.

In that case, the answer would be A: prevail because the first friend intended to cause apprehension, but I'm not sure if intent is enough without the victim's perception.

Alternatively, if the court uses an objective standard, then the first friend's action would be considered an assault because a reasonable person would have felt fear. So the answer would be E: substantial certainty that the second friend would be placed in apprehension.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the subjective or objective standard applies here.

Wait, according to the Restatement (Second) of Torts §21, the apprehension must be reasonable, but the victim's perception is still required. So the victim must actually feel it. So without that, no assault.

Therefore, the second friend didn't feel apprehension, so no assault. Then, what about recklessness?

In that case, the first friend's actions were reckless, so the second friend could sue for recklessness leading to emotional distress. But without physical harm, it's difficult unless it's a case where the distress is so severe that it causes physical symptoms, but that's not mentioned here.

So perhaps the correct answer is D: prevail because the first friend's actions were reckless and dangerous. Recklessness can be a basis for liability in certain torts, such as reckless infliction of emotional distress, but I'm not certain if that's applicable here without physical harm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first friend's act constitutes gross negligence because handling a loaded gun in such a way is a high risk of harm, which could make him liable even without intent.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: some states allow for punitive damages when someone acts with reckless disregard for human life, which could apply here.

Putting it all together, I think the best answer is D: prevail because the first friend's actions were reckless and dangerous. The first friend acted recklessly by loading the gun and pointing it, which is a dangerous act, and that recklessness could form the basis of liability.

The question revolves around whether the second friend can prevail in a tort action against the first friend after the first friend pulled a loaded gun on him during a game of Russian roulette. The key issues involve determining the applicable tort and whether the second friend can recover damages despite not suffering physical harm or apprehension at the time of the incident.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: "Prevail, because the first friend intended to place the second friend in apprehension."  
   - Assault requires both intent to cause apprehension and the victim's actual perception of imminent harm. Since the second friend was intoxicated and believed the gun was unloaded, he did not feel apprehension. Without this subjective awareness, assault does not apply. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: "Prevail, because the first friend showed gross negligence."  
   - Gross negligence involves a significant breach of duty. While the first friend's actions were dangerous, negligence typically requires physical harm or damages. Since the second friend did not suffer physical harm, this option is less likely to succeed.

3. **Option C**: "Not prevail, because there was no physical harm inflicted on the second friend."  
   - This option highlights the lack of physical harm, which is a barrier to recovery in many torts. However, emotional distress could potentially be a basis for recovery in some cases, so this option is not entirely conclusive.

4. **Option
