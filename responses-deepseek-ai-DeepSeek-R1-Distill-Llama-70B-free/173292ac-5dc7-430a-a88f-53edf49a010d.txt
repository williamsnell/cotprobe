Okay, so I have this equation e^x + x - 2 = 0, and I need to find the number of real solutions in the interval [0,1] and outside of it. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe I should define a function f(x) = e^x + x - 2. The solutions to the equation are the points where f(x) equals zero. So, I'm looking for the roots of this function.

I remember that for finding the number of real roots, especially in intervals, the Intermediate Value Theorem can be helpful. That theorem says that if a function is continuous on [a,b] and takes on values f(a) and f(b), then it takes on any value between f(a) and f(b) at some point in the interval. So if f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs, there's at least one root in between.

Let's evaluate f(x) at the endpoints of the interval [0,1]. 

At x=0: f(0) = e^0 + 0 -2 = 1 + 0 -2 = -1. So f(0) is -1.

At x=1: f(1) = e^1 +1 -2 = e +1 -2. e is approximately 2.718, so 2.718 +1 is 3.718, minus 2 is 1.718. So f(1) is about 1.718, which is positive.

So f(0) is negative, f(1) is positive. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there's at least one root in (0,1). So k, the number of solutions in [0,1], is at least 1. But could there be more than one?

To check that, I should look at the behavior of f(x). Maybe I can compute the derivative to see if the function is increasing or decreasing. 

The derivative f’(x) = d/dx (e^x +x -2) = e^x + 1. Since e^x is always positive, e^x +1 is always greater than 1. So f’(x) >0 for all x, which means the function is strictly increasing everywhere.

If the function is strictly increasing and crosses the x-axis once, then there's exactly one solution in the interval. So k=1.

Now, what about outside of [0,1]? So n is the number of real solutions not in [0,1].

Let me check the behavior of f(x) as x approaches negative infinity and positive infinity.

As x approaches negative infinity: e^x approaches 0, so f(x) ≈ 0 + x -2 → x -2. As x becomes very negative, x -2 approaches negative infinity. So f(x) approaches negative infinity.

As x approaches positive infinity: e^x grows exponentially, so f(x) ≈ e^x + x -2, which goes to positive infinity.

Since f(x) is continuous and strictly increasing, and we've already found that it crosses zero once in [0,1], what about outside?

Wait, at x=0, f(0) is -1. So for x <0, let's see. Let me pick x=-1. f(-1)=e^{-1} + (-1) -2 = (1/e) -3 ≈ 0.3679 -3 ≈ -2.6321. That's negative.

Wait, but as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, and at x=0, it's -1. So in the interval (-∞,0), f(x) is always negative? Because the function is increasing. So from x=-infty to x=0, f(x) goes from -infty to f(0)=-1. So it's always negative in that interval. So no roots there.

Wait, but wait: the function is strictly increasing. So let's think about the entire real line. At x approaching negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. At x=0, f(0)=-1. Then it increases to x=1, f(1)=1.718, and continues to increase beyond.

So the function crosses zero once in [0,1]. Then, for x>1, since the function is increasing, and f(1) is positive, and it keeps increasing beyond that, so for x>1, f(x) is positive, so no roots there either.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. So for x>1, f(x) is increasing, so it's going from 1.718 upwards. So no zero crossings there. For x<0, the function is increasing from -infty to f(0)=-1, so no zero crossings there.

So the only real root is in [0,1], which means k=1 and n=0 (since there are no solutions outside [0,1]).

Wait, but wait, let me think again. What about x= something less than 0? Let me plug in x=-2.

f(-2)=e^{-2} + (-2) -2 = (1/e²) -4 ≈ 0.1353 -4 ≈ -3.8647. Negative. So f(x) is negative for all x<0. So no roots there.

So the only real solution is in [0,1], so k=1, n=0. So looking at the options, option A says k=1 and n=0. Option E says k=n=1. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure. Is there any possibility that f(x) has more than one solution? Since it's strictly increasing, it crosses zero at most once. So in [0,1], only one solution. And no solutions elsewhere. So yes, k=1, n=0. So the answer is A.

To determine the number of real solutions of the equation \( e^x + x - 2 = 0 \) in the interval \([0, 1]\) (denoted as \( k \)) and outside of it (denoted as \( n \)), we analyze the function \( f(x) = e^x + x - 2 \).

1. **Behavior at the endpoints of \([0, 1]\):**
   - At \( x = 0 \): \( f(0) = e^0 + 0 - 2 = -1 \) (negative).
   - At \( x = 1 \): \( f(1) = e^1 + 1 - 2 \approx 1.718 \) (positive).

   Since \( f(x) \) changes sign from negative to positive across \([0, 1]\), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root in this interval.

2. **Monotonicity of \( f(x) \):**
   The derivative \( f'(x) = e^x + 1 \) is always positive because \( e^x > 0 \) for all \( x \). This means \( f(x) \) is strictly increasing everywhere. Therefore, \( f(x) \) can cross the x-axis at most once in any interval, including \([0, 1]\). Thus, \( k = 1 \).

3. **Behavior outside \([0, 1]\):**
   - As \( x \to -\infty \): \( f(x) \to -\infty \) (since \( e^x \to 0 \) and \( x \to -\infty \)).
   - At \( x = 0 \): \( f(0) = -1 \) (negative).
   - As \( x \to \infty \): \( f(x) \to \infty \) (since \( e^x \) grows exponentially).

   Since \( f(x) \) is strictly increasing and crosses zero exactly once in \([0, 1]\), it does not cross zero elsewhere. For \( x < 0 \), \( f(x) \) remains negative, and for \( x > 1 \), \( f(x) \) remains positive. Therefore, there are no solutions outside \([0, 1]\), so \( n = 0 \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   The function \( f(x) = e^x + x - 2 \) has exactly one real solution in \([0, 1]\) and no solutions outside this interval. Thus, \( k = 1 \) and \( n = 0 \).

The correct answer is **A**.
