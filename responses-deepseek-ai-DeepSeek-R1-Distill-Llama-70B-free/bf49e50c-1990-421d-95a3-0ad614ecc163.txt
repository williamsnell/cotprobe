Okay, so I have this math problem here: What value of y makes y + 2.9 = 11 true? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Hmm, let me think about how to solve this.

Alright, the equation is y plus 2.9 equals 11. So, I need to find y. To isolate y, I should subtract 2.9 from both sides of the equation. That way, I get y by itself.

Let me write that down. Starting with y + 2.9 = 11. If I subtract 2.9 from both sides, it becomes y = 11 - 2.9. Now, I need to calculate 11 minus 2.9.

Wait, 11 minus 2 is 9, right? So 11 minus 2.9 must be a little less than 9. Let me do the subtraction step by step. 2.9 is the same as 2 and 0.9. So subtracting 2 from 11 gives me 9, and then I subtract the 0.9, which brings it down to 8.1.

So y should be 8.1. Now I look at the options. Let me check each one quickly.

Option A is 12.9, which is way higher than 8.1. Option B is 15.1—nope. Option C is 11.1, still higher. D is 14.9, no. E is 8.9, which is close but not exact. F is 9.9—no. G is 8.1. Oh, that's the one I got. H is 10.1, I is 13.9, J is 9.1. So the correct answer is G.

The equation is y + 2.9 = 11. To solve for y, subtract 2.9 from both sides: y = 11 - 2.9 = 8.1. Among the options, G is 8.1.

G

The answer is G.
