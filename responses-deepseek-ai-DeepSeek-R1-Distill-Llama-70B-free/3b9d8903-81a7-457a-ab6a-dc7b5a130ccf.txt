Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again. Samantha has 342 baseball cards, and Perry has 184. The question is asking how many more baseball cards Samantha has than Perry. Hmm, that sounds like I need to subtract the number of Perry's cards from Samantha's to find the difference.

Alright, let's break it down. Samantha's cards are 342, and Perry has 184. So I guess I subtract 184 from 342. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Actually, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, too much, I think I got stuck in a loop. Let me just focus.

So, I need to subtract Perry's cards from Samantha's. 342 minus 184. Let me do the subtraction. 

Starting from the right, 2 minus 4. Oh wait, I can't do that because 2 is smaller than 4. So I have to borrow from the next digit. The 4 in the tens place becomes 3, and the 2 becomes 12. 12 minus 4 is 8. Then the tens place: 3 minus 8. Wait, 3 is smaller than 8? Oh right, so I have to borrow again from the hundreds place. The 3 becomes 13 (after borrowing from the 3, which becomes 2), and the 3 in tens becomes 13. So 13 minus 8 is 5. Then the hundreds place: 2 minus 1 is 1. So putting it together, 342 minus 184 is 158.

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Yes, 184 plus 158 equals 342. Because 184 + 100 is 284, plus 58 is 342. So yes, that's correct. So the difference is 158.

Looking at the options, option D is 158. So the answer should be D.

The question asks how many more baseball cards Samantha has than Perry. Samantha has 342 cards, and Perry has 184. To find the difference, subtract Perry's cards from Samantha's:

\[
342 - 184 = 158
\]

Thus, Samantha has 158 more baseball cards than Perry. The correct answer is:

D: 158

Answer: D
