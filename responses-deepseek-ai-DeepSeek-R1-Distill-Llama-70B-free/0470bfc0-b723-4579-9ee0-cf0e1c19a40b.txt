Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find a three-digit number abc. The condition is that a positive integer N and N squared both end with the same sequence of four digits abcd in base 10, and the digit a is nonzero.

Hmm, let me break this down. I remember that numbers whose squares end with the same digits as themselves have something to do with automorphic numbers. Automorphic numbers are numbers whose squares end with the number itself. For example, 5^2 is 25, which ends with 5. Similarly, 6^2 is 36, which ends with 6.

But wait, in this problem, it's about four digits. So N is a number such that N^2 ends with the last four digits being the same as N's last four digits. That sounds like a four-digit automorphic number.

I think the general approach is to solve the equation N^2 ≡ N mod 10000. That simplifies to N(N-1) ≡ 0 mod 10000. So N and N-1 must multiply to a multiple of 10000. Since 10000 is 2^4 * 5^4, N and N-1 must be coprime (because consecutive integers are coprime), so one must be divisible by 2^4=16, and the other by 5^4=625.

So there are two cases:

1. N ≡ 0 mod 16 and N ≡ 1 mod 625
2. N ≡ 0 mod 625 and N ≡ 1 mod 16

I think I need to solve these using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Let me try the first case: N ≡ 0 mod 16 and N ≡ 1 mod 625.

Let N = 16k. Then 16k ≡ 1 mod 625. I need to find k such that 16k ≡ 1 mod 625.

To solve 16k ≡ 1 mod 625, I can find the modular inverse of 16 modulo 625. Let's compute that.

Looking for x such that 16x ≡ 1 mod 625.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

Find gcd(16,625):

625 ÷ 16 = 39 with remainder 1 (since 16*39=624, 625-624=1)
16 ÷ 1 = 16 with rem 0. So gcd is 1.

Now backtracking:

1 = 625 - 16*39

So 1 ≡ -16*39 mod 625.

Which means the inverse of 16 is -39 mod 625.

But -39 mod 625 is 625-39=586. So x=586.

So k ≡ 586 mod 625. Therefore, k = 586 + 625m, where m is an integer.

So N =16k =16*(586 +625m)=16*586 + 16*625m= 9384 + 10000m.

So the smallest positive N in this case is 9384. But wait, the problem states that N and N^2 end with four digits abcd, and a is nonzero. So abcd would be 9384, so a=9. That would make the three-digit number abc as 938.

But looking at the options, I don't see 938. So perhaps I made a mistake, or maybe I need to check the other case.

Let me try the second case: N ≡0 mod 625 and N ≡1 mod 16.

So N=625k. Then 625k ≡1 mod 16.

Compute 625 mod16: 16*39=624, so 625 mod16 is 1. So 625k mod16 = (1)k mod16 =k mod16. So we have k ≡1 mod16.

So k=1 +16m, where m is an integer.

Thus, N=625*(1+16m)=625 +625*16 m =625 +10000m.

So the smallest N here is 625. Let's check N=625.

625 squared is 390625. The last four digits are 0625, which is 625 with a leading zero. But wait, the problem says N ends with abcd, which is four digits, and a is nonzero. So if N is 625, then the last four digits would be 0625, but a is zero, which is not allowed. So 625 isn't valid.

Wait, but maybe a larger N in this case? Let's compute N=625 +10000m. Let me take m=1: N=10625. Now, N^2 = (10625)^2. Let me compute that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute N mod 10000 and N^2 mod 10000. For N=10625:

N mod10000 is 625. Wait no, 10625 mod10000 is 625, but N is 10625, so the last four digits are 0625. So a is zero again, which is not allowed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think. For the case where N ≡0 mod625 and N≡1 mod16, the solution is N=625 +10000m. The smallest such N is 625, but that gives last four digits 0625. If m=1, N=10625, last four digits 0625 again. So in this case, the four-digit ending is 0625, which starts with a=0. But the problem says a is nonzero, so this case doesn't work.

So the valid solution comes from the first case, where N=9384, which ends with 9384. So the last four digits abcd are 9384, with a=9, b=3, c=8, d=4. So the three-digit number abc is 938. But wait, looking at the options provided: A is 491, B is 254, C is625, D is812, E is368, F is789, G is937, H is673, I is123, J is456.

Hmm, 937 is option G. But wait, in the first case, I got N=9384, so abc would be 938, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider other automorphic numbers beyond four digits. Maybe there's another number beyond 9384 that satisfies the condition but doesn't start with a=9. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the modular inverse.

Let me double-check the first case. N ≡0 mod16 and N≡1 mod625.

I had N=16k. So 16k ≡1 mod625.

I found the inverse of 16 mod625 to be 586. So k=586 mod625, so k=586+625m.

Thus, N=16*586=9384. Let me compute 9384 squared.

But 9384 squared is a big number. Let me compute it modulo 10000, since we only care about the last four digits.

But wait, since N^2 ≡N mod10000, I can just verify that 9384^2 mod10000 is 9384.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 9384^2:

Well, 9384 * 9384. Let me compute this step by step.

But wait, 9384 mod10000 is 9384, so 9384^2 mod10000 is (9384)^2 mod10000.

Alternatively, I can compute (9000 + 384)^2.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 9384^2:

Let me compute 9384 * 9384:

First, 9000 *9000 =81,000,000

9000*384= 3,456,000

384*9000= same as above.

384*384: Let's compute that.

384 * 300 =115,200

384 *80=30,720

384 *4=1,536

So sum: 115200 +30720=145920 +1536=147,456.

So putting it all together:

9384^2 = (9000+384)^2 =9000^2 + 2*9000*384 +384^2.

Which is 81,000,000 + 2*3,456,000 +147,456.

So 81,000,000 +6,912,000 =87,912,000 +147,456=88,059,456.

So the last four digits are 9456. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, 88,059,456 ends with 9456, but N is 9384. So 9384 squared ends with 9456, which isn't equal to 9384. So something's wrong here.

Wait a minute, that can't be right. If N is automorphic, N squared should end with N. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, I think I see the mistake. Because when I computed N=9384, perhaps the square doesn't end with 9384 but with something else.

Wait, let me compute 9384^2 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 9384^2 mod 10000.

Because 9384 mod 10000 is 9384, so (9384)^2 mod10000 is equal to (9384^2) mod10000.

Alternatively, I can compute 9384 *9384:

But perhaps a better approach is to compute (9000 + 384)^2 mod10000.

Let me compute (a + b)^2 where a=9000, b=384.

(a + b)^2 =a² + 2ab +b².

But when computing mod10000, terms beyond 10000 will wrap around.

a² =9000²=81,000,000. mod10000 is 0.

2ab=2*(9000)*(384)=2*9000*384= 18,000 *384.

Wait, 9000*384=3,456,000. Multiply by 2: 6,912,000.

mod10000: 6,912,000 mod10000 is 2000.

b²=384²=147,456. mod10000 is 7456.

So adding all together: 0 + 2000 +7456 = 9456 mod10000.

So 9384^2 mod10000 is 9456, which is not equal to 9384. So that means N=9384 is not a solution. But that contradicts the earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the congruence.

Wait, I thought N^2 ≡N mod10000, so N(N-1)≡0 mod10000.

But I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the inverse.

Let me re-calculate the inverse of 16 mod625.

We have 16x ≡1 mod625.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

Find integers x and y such that 16x +625y=1.

Let me perform the algorithm step by step.

625 divided by 16: 16*39=624, remainder 1.

So 625 =16*39 +1.

Then 1=625 -16*39.

So x is -39, which is 586 mod625.

Wait, that's correct. So x=586.

So 16*586=9376.

Wait, 16*586 = 9376. Let me compute 9376 mod625.

Wait, 625*15=9375. So 9376 mod625 is 1. Correct.

So N=16k, where k=586 mod625. So k=586, 586+625=1211, etc.

So N=16*586=9384.

But as I saw earlier, 9384 squared ends with 9456, which is different, so N=9384 doesn't satisfy N^2 ≡N mod10000. That's confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that N and N² end with the same four digits, abcd, and a is non-zero. So N can be any number, but its last four digits must be abcd, and N² must also end with abcd.

Wait, but for N=0625, that's 625, but a is zero, which is invalid. For N=0625, a=0, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps there's another solution beyond 10000. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I missed another solution when solving the congruence.

Another approach: The equation is N^2 ≡N mod 16 and mod625.

So N^2 ≡N mod16 → N(N-1)≡0 mod16.

Similarly, N^2 ≡N mod625 → N(N-1)≡0 mod625.

So either N≡0 mod16 and N≡1 mod625, or N≡1 mod16 and N≡0 mod625.

Wait, I think I might have mixed the cases. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, in mod16: N^2 ≡N → N(N-1)≡0 mod16.

So possible cases:

Either N≡0 mod16 or N≡1 mod16.

Similarly, in mod625: N≡0 or 1.

So the possible combinations are:

Case 1: N≡0 mod16 and N≡0 mod625 → N≡0 mod(16*625)=10000. So N=0 mod10000. But then N would end with 0000, which has a=0, invalid.

Case 2: N≡0 mod16 and N≡1 mod625 → this was the first case I considered, leading to N=9384.

Case3: N≡1 mod16 and N≡0 mod625 → which would give N=625 mod10000, leading to last four digits 0625, which is invalid because a=0.

Case4: N≡1 mod16 and N≡1 mod625 → Then N≡1 mod lcm(16,625)=10000. So N=1 mod10000, which would end with 0001, a=0, invalid.

So only Case2 and Case3 are possible, but Case3 gives a=0, which is invalid, so only Case2 remains, leading to N=9384.

But earlier when I computed 9384^2 mod10000, I got 9456, which doesn't match 9384. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 9384^2 mod10000.

Compute 9384 * 9384:

First, 9384 *9384.

But let me compute it step by step.

Alternatively, compute (9384)^2:

Calculate 9384 × 9384:

Let me break it down:

9384 × 9000 = 84,456,000

9384 × 300 = 2,815,200

9384 × 80 = 750,720

9384 ×4= 37,536

Now add all these together:

84,456,000

+2,815,200 → 87,271,200

+750,720 → 88,021,920

+37,536 → 88,059,456

So 9384 squared is 88,059,456, which ends with 9456. Wait, that's not 9384. So something's wrong here.

So N=9384 doesn't satisfy N^2 ≡N mod10000. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, maybe I need to check if there's another number beyond 10000 that meets this condition.

Wait, perhaps I should consider solving N^2 ≡N mod10000 again.

Let me try N=0625, which is 625. As before, 625^2 is 390625, which ends with 0625. So yes, 625^2 ends with 0625. But a=0, which is invalid.

What about N=9376? Wait, 9376 is a known automorphic number in base 10 for four digits.

Wait, let me check 9376^2.

Compute 9376 ×9376.

Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

But perhaps I can compute 9376^2:

I remember that 9376 is an automorphic number, so 9376^2 should end with 9376.

Let me verify:

9376 ×9376.

Compute as (9000 + 376)^2.

=9000^2 + 2*9000*376 +376^2.

9000^2=81,000,000.

2*9000*376= 18,000 *376 = Let's compute 18,000*300=5,400,000 and 18,000*76=1,368,000 → total 6,768,000.

376^2: Let's compute 376 ×376.

Compute 300×300=90,000.

300×76=22,800.

76×300=22,800.

76×76=5,776.

So 90,000 +22,800 +22,800 +5,776 = 141,376.

So now adding all parts:

81,000,000 +6,768,000 =87,768,000 +141,376=87,909,376.

So 9376^2=87,909,376, which indeed ends with 9376. So N=9376 satisfies N^2 ≡N mod10000.

So the last four digits abcd are 9376, so a=9, b=3, c=7, d=6. So the three-digit number abc is 937.

Looking at the options, option G is 937.

So the correct answer should be G:937.

Wait, but why didn't this solution come up in the earlier case? Because when I solved N≡0 mod16 and N≡1 mod625, I got N=9384, which didn't work. But 9376 is another solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial solving. Let me check.

Wait, when solving N≡0 mod16 and N≡1 mod625, I found N=9384, which didn't satisfy the condition, but N=9376 does. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should solve N≡1 mod625 and N≡0 mod16 again to see if I missed something.

Let me re-solve N≡0 mod16 and N≡1 mod625.

So N=16k. 16k ≡1 mod625 → 16k=1 +625m.

We're looking for integer k and m such that 16k -625m=1.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm again:

We have 625 = 16*39
