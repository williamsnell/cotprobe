Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Keynesian economics and why they changed their view on monetary policy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking why Keynesians initially rejected monetary policy but later included both monetary and fiscal policies as options. I remember that Keynesian theory focused a lot on fiscal policy, like government spending and taxes, to manage the economy, especially during the Great Depression. They probably thought that monetary policy, which involves the money supply and interest rates, wasn't as effective, maybe because of the liquidity trap ideaâ€”where people just hold onto cash and don't invest even with low interest rates.

But why did they change their minds later on? I think it had something to do with challenges to their views. Oh right, monetarism came into play. Milton Friedman and other monetarists argued that monetary policy is more potent in the long run and that Keynesians were ignoring it. So maybe the rise of monetarism influenced Keynesians to reconsider.

Looking at the options, option A says the rise of monetarism influenced them. That sounds plausible. But wait, I should make sure. Another option is H: failure of predictions based on fiscal policy and empirical research on money supply. That makes sense too. Maybe Keynesians saw that their fiscal policies weren't working as expected, and studies showed that money supply changes did have effects. So their initial rejection was based on theory, but empirical evidence from monetarists forced them to include monetary policy.

So both A and H seem possible. But the question is about why they changed their minds. Initially, they dismissed monetary policy, thinking fiscal was better. Then, due to monetarism's influence, supported by empirical research, they had to include it.

Wait, another angle: the Keynesians initially thought that during a depression, monetary policy is ineffective because of the liquidity trap. But later, perhaps when the economy wasn't in such a trap, monetary policy became more relevant. Or maybe stagflation in the 70s made them realize fiscal policy alone wasn't enough.

Option E says recognition of fiscal policy's ineffectiveness during high inflation. That could be it because if fiscal policy leads to higher deficits, which can cause inflation, then maybe they saw that monetary policy is better suited to control inflation.

But I'm not sure. The initial change in Keynesian views might have been more about the counterarguments from monetarists. So option A is about the rise of monetarism influencing them, while H is about empirical failures of fiscal policy and evidence on money supply.

Alternatively, I remember reading that Keynesians started to incorporate rational expectations and monetarist ideas, leading to the development of the neo-Keynesian synthesis. This came after challenges from monetarists showed that monetary policy does matter, especially in the long run.

So perhaps the correct answer is H: failure of fiscal policy predictions and empirical research showing money supply effects. Or maybe it's A, the influence of monetarism itself.

Wait, the question says after the initial rejection, why did they include both. So the reason would be that they saw monetary policy as effective, which they didn't before.

Monetarists provided evidence that changes in money supply have significant effects on the economy. So maybe option H is correct because it's about empirical research on money supply effects, which made Keynesians realize monetary policy works.

But I'm not entirely certain. I think the key point is that the Keynesians initially dismissed monetary policy, but then through empirical research (like monetarist studies showing money matters) and perhaps the failure of their fiscal-only approach, they had to include it.

So looking back, the answer is probably H. Because the failure of their predictions based on fiscal policy alone, coupled with new empirical evidence on how money supply changes affect the economy, made them change their stance.

The Keynesians initially focused on fiscal policy and dismissed monetary policy, partly due to the concept of the liquidity trap, where monetary policy was seen as ineffective during economic downturns. However, over time, the rise of monetarism and empirical research challenged this view. Monetarists, such as Milton Friedman, argued that monetary policy had significant long-term effects, and studies demonstrated the impact of changes in the money supply. Additionally, the failure of fiscal policy alone to predict economic outcomes effectively, especially in contexts like stagflation, further prompted Keynesians to reconsider their stance. This shift was driven by both the influence of monetarist ideas and the accumulation of empirical evidence showing the effectiveness of monetary policy. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: Failure of predictions based on fiscal policy and empirical research on effects of changes in money supply.

Answer: H
