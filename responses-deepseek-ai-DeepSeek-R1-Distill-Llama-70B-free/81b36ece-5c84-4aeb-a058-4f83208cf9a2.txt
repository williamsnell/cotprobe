Question:

Which is the best way to describe the AS curve in the long run?

Options:

A: Always upward sloping because it follows the Law of Supply.
B: Always downward sloping due to decreased demand over time.
C: Always upward sloping due to the effects of inflation.
D: Fluctuates between upward and downward sloping.
E: Always vertical in the short run.
F: Always downward sloping.
G: Always vertical in the long run.
H: Always horizontal.
I: Fluctuates between vertical and horizontal.
J: Always horizontal due to constant supply.

Okay, so I have this question about economics, specifically the AS curve in the long run. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the AS/AD model is a key concept in macroeconomics. The AS curve represents the total supply of goods and services in an economy. But wait, I'm getting confused between the short run and the long run. In the short run, the AS curve is upward sloping because as prices increase, businesses produce more. But what about the long run?

Oh right, in the long run, things are different. In the short run, prices can sticky, like wages might not adjust immediately. But in the long run, all prices, including wages and resource prices, adjust. So, if the economy is at its long-run potential, it doesn't matter what the price level is because the economy can't produce more than that potential in the long run.

Wait, so the long-run AS curve is vertical. Because beyond the full employment level of output, the economy can't go. So no matter how prices change, the real output doesn't change. That means the AS curve in the long run is vertical at the potential GDP level.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option G says "Always vertical in the long run." That sounds right. Option A says upward sloping because of the Law of Supply, but that's the short run AS curve. Option C talks about inflation, which might affect it, but in the long run, inflation would be accounted for by price level changes, not quantity.

Other options: Option E is about the short run, so that's not it. Option J says horizontal due to constant supply, but that's probably the long-run AD curve, or maybe the SRAS if prices are fixed. Wait, no, the long-run AD curve isn't horizontal. Actually, no, the long-run AS is vertical, and AD is still a downward sloping curve.

So the correct answer should be G. Always vertical in the long run.

The correct answer is:

G: Always vertical in the long run.

Explanation: In the long run, the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve is vertical because all prices, including wages and resource prices, adjust fully. The economy produces at its potential output level regardless of the price level, making the AS curve vertical at the long-run equilibrium point. This distinguishes it from the short-run AS curve, which is upward sloping due to sticky prices.
