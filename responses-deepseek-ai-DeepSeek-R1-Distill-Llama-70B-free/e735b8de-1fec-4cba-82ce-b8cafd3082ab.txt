Okay, so I've got this question about attachment theory, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about Joe and his interactions with Helen. Joe really wants to get close to Helen, but Helen seems put off by his desperate advances. And this isn't the first time this has happened in Joe's relationships with women. So, the question is asking what Joe's attachment style is according to attachment theory.

I remember that attachment theory categorizes people into different styles based on how they behave in relationships. The main types are secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant. Wait, sometimes I've also heard terms like anxious-ambivalent and others, so I might need to clarify that.

Let me break down the options:

A: Detached lover - Hmm, not sure what that's exactly. Maybe someone who doesn't get close?

B: Avoidant lover - That's a general term. There are two types of avoidant: dismissive and fearful.

C: Disorganized lover - I think this is more about people who have experienced trauma, leading to an inconsistent attachment style.

D: Fearful-avoidant lover - These people fear rejection but still want intimacy. They might have a history of negative relationships.

E: Secure-avoidant - That doesn't sound right. Secure people are comfortable with intimacy and don't avoid it.

F: Passionate lover - Not an attachment style term I recognize. Sounds more like a trait than an attachment category.

G: Dismissive-avoidant lover - These individuals value their independence highly and might come off as aloof or distant. They don't seek intimacy as much.

H: Secure lover - Securely attached people have healthy relationships, not the case here since Joe's actions are pushing Helen away.

I: Obsessive lover - Not a standard attachment style term. Maybe similar to anxious-preoccupied.

J: Anxious-ambivalent lover - Now, this term rings a bell. Anxious-preoccupied or anxious-ambivalent types are overly dependent and fear rejection. They can come across as clingy or desperate.

So Joe is described as desperate and making advances that push Helen away. This seems like someone who is anxious and seeking a lot of closeness, maybe to the point of being overwhelming. That fits with the anxious-ambivalent or anxious-preoccupied type. Looking at the options, J is the anxious-ambivalent lover.

Wait, but let me make sure. Anxious-ambivalent people are preoccupied with their relationships and fear rejection. They might be overly dependent and seek a lot of reassurance, which can sometimes come off as desperate. That definitely matches Joe's behavior here. 

On the other hand, the avoidant types (like dismissive or fearful) tend to pull away. But Joe is the one approaching, not pulling away. So the avoidant options (B, D, G) don't fit as well because Joe is seeking closeness, not avoiding it.

So the correct answer should be J: an anxious-ambivalent lover.

Joe's behavior, as described, aligns with the anxious-ambivalent attachment style. He is desperate for closeness and his advances are overwhelming, which pushes Helen away. This pattern of seeking intense intimacy and fearing rejection is characteristic of the anxious-ambivalent type. 

Option J: an anxious-ambivalent lover is the correct answer.
