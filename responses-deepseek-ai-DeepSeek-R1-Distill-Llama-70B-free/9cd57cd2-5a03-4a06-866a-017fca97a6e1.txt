Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.
"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the Populist Party Platform of 1892. The question is asking which of the given options has sentiments most similar to the excerpt provided. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the excerpt again to understand its main points. The text talks about two major political parties struggling for power and plunder. It mentions that these parties have allowed grievous wrongs to be inflicted upon the people. The controlling influences in both parties are accused of not making serious efforts to prevent these issues and not promising substantial reforms. They are focusing on the tariff issue to distract from other problems like corporations, trusts, and the demonetization of silver. The goal is to restore the government to the plain people and align with the Constitution's purposes, like promoting general welfare and securing liberty.

So the key themes here are criticism of both major parties for corruption and ignoring the people's needs, focusing on economic issues like corporations and monetary policy, and advocating for returning power to the common people.

Now, I need to look at each option and see which one aligns with these themes.

Option A: Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912. I know that TR was a progressive who focused on trust-busting and breaking up big corporations. He was critical of the power of big businesses and advocated for more government regulation. This seems somewhat similar because he was against corporate influence.

Option B: Abraham Lincoln, Republican Party, 1860. Lincoln was more focused on preserving the Union and ending slavery. I don't recall him being as critical of both parties as the Populists were. His main issues were different.

Option C: H. Ross Perot, Reform Party, 1996. Perot ran on balancing the budget and was critical of trade deals like NAFTA. He also focused on the national debt and was a bit of an outsider candidate. His main issues were economic, but I'm not sure if he criticized both parties in the same way.

Option D: William Jennings Bryan, Populist Party, 1896. Bryan was a key figure in the Populist movement. He ran for president on a platform that included free silver (which relates to the demonetization of silver mentioned in the excerpt) and was critical of big corporations and banking interests. This seems very similar.

Option E: Barry Goldwater, Republican Party, 1964. Goldwater was a conservative who opposed big government and supported states' rights. He doesn't really fit the Populist critique of both parties; his focus was more on reducing government intervention in the economy.

Option F: Bernie Sanders, Democratic Party, 2016. Sanders is a progressive who criticizes income inequality, big corporations, and the influence of money in politics. His message about taking power back from the elites and giving it to the people aligns with the Populists' ideas.

Option G: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Democratic Party, 1932. FDR's New Deal was about reforming the economy post-Depression, regulating banks, and providing relief. He was critical of the economic structures but was part of the Democratic Party establishment, so maybe not as similar in terms of criticizing both parties.

Option H: Andrew Jackson, Democratic Party, 1829. Jackson was a populist himself, opposing the Second Bank of the US and championing the common man. He was critical of elites and sought to expand democracy. His platform was about giving power to the people, similar to the Populists.

Option I: Richard Nixon, Republican Party, 1968. Nixon's focus was more on law and order, and he used the Southern Strategy to gain votes. Not really aligned with the economic and anti-corruption themes of the Populists.

Option J: George McGovern, Democratic Party, 1972. McGovern was an anti-war candidate and focused on social issues. His platform doesn't align closely with the economic and anti-corporate themes here.

Now, considering the options, the Populists in 1892 were very critical of both major parties and focused on economic issues like silver, trusts, and corporate influence. They wanted to return power to the people.

Looking at the options, D is William Jennings Bryan, who was a Populist himself. So that seems like a direct match. But I should check the others.

Option A: TR was part of the Progressive movement, which shared some similarities, but he was a Republican initially, and the Progressives were a bit different. The Populists were more focused on farmers and laborers, while Progressives included a broader range of reforms.

Option F: Bernie Sanders is a modern-day progressive who talks about income inequality and corporate power, which is similar. He ran against the establishment in his party, which aligns with the Populists' criticism of both parties.

Option H: Andrew Jackson's policies were populist in nature, opposing banks and supporting the common man. His movement was in the 19th century, but the Populists were a specific third party later on.

So, the question is about the sentiments being most similar. The excerpt is from the Populist Party, so the answer might be D, since Bryan was their 1896 candidate. But the question is about the sentiments, not the exact party.

Wait, the question is about the sentiments being similar, not the exact policies. So maybe the answer is someone else.

Alternatively, another thought: the Populists were a third party, so their critique was against both major parties. So looking for someone else who also criticized both major parties for being controlled by elites or corporations.

Bernie Sanders in 2016 ran as a Democrat but was critical of the Democratic establishment and the influence of money in politics, similar to the Populists' stance against both parties.

H. Ross Perot in 1996 also ran as a third-party candidate, critical of both parties, focusing on deficit spending and trade. His economic focus is somewhat similar.

Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 ran as the Progressive Party candidate, critical of both parties, especially for being controlled by corporate interests. So TR's platform was about breaking up trusts and direct democracy, which aligns with the Populists' anti-corporate stance.

So now I'm a bit torn between options A, C, D, F, H.

The Populists in the excerpt are talking about both parties ignoring issues except the tariff, which is an economic issue, and instead focusing on things like corporations, trusts, demonetization of silver, and usury.

Looking at the options, the ones that focus on economic issues and are critical of both parties are A, C, D, F, H.

Option D is Bryan, who was a Populist, so that's a direct link. But the question is about who else has similar sentiments.

Option F, Bernie Sanders, talks a lot about income inequality, corporate power, and the influence of money in politics, which is similar to the Populists' message.

Option A, TR's Progressives, focused on trust-busting and direct primaries, which is somewhat similar.

Option H, Andrew Jackson, was against the Bank of the US and for the common man, which is similar.

But the excerpt is from the Populist Party, so the most similar would be another Populist, which is D.

Wait, the question is about which of these options has similar sentiments, so D is part of the Populist Party. So the answer might be D, but wait the question is about the "sentiments expressed... are most similar to those expressed by" someone else.

Wait, no: the question is about the sentiments in the Populist platform being similar to another person's.

So the Populists are criticizing both parties, so looking for someone else who did the same.

So TR in 1912, as a Progressive, criticized both parties for being controlled by special interests. So that's similar.

Similarly, Bernie Sanders in 2016, as a Democrat, criticized both parties for being influenced by big money.

So perhaps both A and F are possibilities.

Alternatively, looking at the options, the correct answer is likely A: Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912, because the Progressives were similar to Populists in their critique of corporate power and both parties being controlled by special interests.

But wait, another angle: the Populists were particularly focused on monetary policy, like the demonetization of silver, which was a big issue for them. So someone who also focused on that would be a better match.

William Jennings Bryan, in 1896, ran on the free silver issue, so D would be a direct match, but the question is about someone else's sentiments being similar. So perhaps the answer is D, but the options are about other people.

Wait, the question is which of these options has sentiments similar to the Populists. So the Populists are in the excerpt, and the question is about which other figure's sentiments are similar.

So D is Bryan, who is a Populist, so perhaps the answer is D. But the options are about other parties.

Wait, no, the options are about other people. So perhaps the answer is A or F.

Alternatively, the sentiments are about both parties being corrupt and controlled by corporate interests, which is similar to Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign, where he criticized both parties as being influenced by big money and corporations. So F would be a good match.

But I'm not sure. The Populists were also very focused on economic issues affecting farmers and labor, so maybe someone like Andrew Jackson, who was a champion of the common man, but he was earlier.

Alternatively, TR's Progressives were about breaking up trusts and corporations, which is similar.

Wait, the question is about the sentiments expressed, not the exact policies. So the key is the critique of both major parties and the focus on economic issues and corporate influence.

So I think the best matches are A, D, and F.

D is a Populist, so that's a direct match, but the question is about someone else. So perhaps it's A or F.

I think the correct answer is A: Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912, because the Progressives were similar in their critique of both parties being controlled by special interests and advocating for reforms against corporate power.

Alternatively, F: Bernie Sanders, who is a modern progressive, also fits.

But looking back, the Populist Party platform is from 1892. The options include William Jennings Bryan in 1896 as D. Wait, but the question is about the sentiments in the excerpt, which is from 1892, so D is from 1896. That's just four years later, same movement.

But the question is about which other figure's sentiments are similar. So perhaps the answer is H. Ross Perot, option C, because he was a third-party candidate critical of both parties and focused on economic issues.

Wait, Perot's main issues were the budget deficit and NAFTA. The excerpt is more about corporate control and monetary policy.

Hmm. This is tricky. I think the best fit is either A or F.

The Populists were a third party, so someone else who ran as a third party with similar anti-corporate, pro-people messages would make sense.

Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 ran as the Progressive (Bull Moose) Party candidate, and his platform was about trust-busting, direct primaries, and women's suffrage. He was critical of the corruption in both parties and the influence of corporations.

So I think the answer is A.

Wait, but let me think again. The excerpt mentions the two major parties agreeing to ignore all issues except the tariff, and the Populists are bringing up other issues like demonetization of silver, trusts, etc.

So the focus is on economic issues that the major parties are ignoring, and the sentiment is that both parties are corrupt and serving the interests of the wealthy.

So who else has expressed similar sentiments about both parties being in the pocket of the wealthy and ignoring the people's economic concerns.

Bernie Sanders in 2016 ran on a platform of income inequality, breaking up big banks, and getting money out of politics. He was critical of both parties, especially the Democrats for being influenced by corporate money.

So F could be the answer.

Alternatively, TR's Progressives were focused on similar issues, but he was more about regulation and breaking up trusts, but perhaps the sentiment is similar.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But I think both A and F are possible.

Wait, the options are from 1912, 1996, 2016.

The Populists were in 1892, so the next similar movement in the early 20th century was Progressivism, which TR was part of.

So perhaps the answer is A.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: read the options again.

The sentiments expressed are that both parties are corrupt, controlled by corporations, and ignoring the real issues. So looking for someone who also criticizes both parties for being controlled by special interests and corporations.

In 1912, TR's platform was about breaking up trusts and direct democracy, which aligns with the Populists' anti-corporate stance.

Similarly, Bernie Sanders in 2016 talked a lot about the corruption of both parties by money and corporations.

So both A and F could be correct. But which one is more similar?

The Populists were focused on farmers and labor, while TR's Progressives included a broader range. Sanders' message was more about the 1% and income inequality.

But the key is the sentiment about both parties being controlled by special interests.

I think both A and F fit, but the options only allow one correct answer.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is likely A: Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912.

But wait, I recall that the Populists were more focused on monetary policy, like free silver, which was a big issue. So someone else who focused on that would be a better fit, but none of the options except D and maybe G (FDR) touch on that.

Wait, FDR's 1932 platform was about the New Deal, which included banking reforms, but he was a Democrat and not as critical of both parties as the Populists.

So, considering all this, I think the best answer is A: Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912.

The question asks which figure's sentiments are most similar to those expressed in the Populist Party Platform of 1892. The excerpt criticizes both major political parties for being controlled by corporate interests, ignoring the plight of the common people, and focusing on distractions like the tariff while neglecting issues like trusts, demonetization of silver, and usury. The key themes are anti-corporate critique, a focus on economic inequality, and a call to return power to the people.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912**: Roosevelt's Progressive platform criticized both parties for being controlled by special interests and advocated for trust-busting and direct democracy, aligning with the Populists' anti-corporate stance.
- **B: Abraham Lincoln, Republican Party, 1860**: Lincoln's focus was on preserving the Union and ending slavery, not on critiquing both parties for corruption or economic inequality.
- **C: H. Ross Perot, Reform Party, 1996**: Perot criticized both parties but focused on issues like the budget deficit and NAFTA, which are less aligned with the Populists' economic and monetary policy concerns.
- **D: William Jennings Bryan, Populist Party, 1896**: Bryan was a key Populist figure, advocating for free silver and criticizing corporate influence. However, the question seeks someone outside the Populist Party with similar sentiments.
- **E: Barry Goldwater, Republican Party, 1964**: Goldwater's conservatism and focus on reducing government intervention do not align with the Populists' critique of corporate power.
- **F: Bernie Sanders, Democratic Party, 2016**: Sanders criticized both parties for being influenced by corporate money and focused on income inequality, aligning with the Populists' themes of economic justice and anti-corporate critique.
- **G: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Democratic Party, 1932**: FDR's New Deal addressed economic reforms but did not involve the same level of criticism of both parties as the Populists.
- **H: Andrew Jackson, Democratic Party, 1829**: Jackson's populism opposed the Bank of the U.S. and championed the common man, but his focus was earlier and less aligned with the specific economic issues of the 1892 Populists.
- **I: Richard Nixon, Republican Party, 1968**: Nixon's focus on law and order and the Southern Strategy does not match the Populists' economic and anti-corporate themes.
- **J: George McGovern, Democratic Party, 1972**: McGovern's anti-war and social justice platform does not align closely with the Populists' economic critique.

The sentiments expressed in the Populist Platform are most similar to those of **Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912**, as both criticized corporate influence and advocated for reforms to return power to the people. While Bernie Sanders (F) also shares similar themes, Roosevelt's Progressive movement more directly mirrors the Populists' anti-corporate and reform-oriented agenda.

Answer: A
