Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about thermal noise voltage in a resistor. Hmm, I remember that thermal noise is also called Johnson-Nyquist noise. The formula I think is something like V_noise = sqrt(4*k_B*T*R*Δf), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, R is resistance, and Δf is the bandwidth.

Wait, right, the exact formula is V_rms = sqrt(4 * k_B * T * R * Δf). Oh, but wait, sometimes I've seen it without the 4, so maybe I should double-check. No, wait, I think the formula with the 4 is correct because it comes from the Nyquist theorem derivation. So I'll go with that.

The resistor given is 40k Ohms, which is 4000 Ohms. The room temperature is 27 degrees Celsius. Oh, right, I need to convert that to Kelvin. So 27 + 273.15 is 300.15 K, approximately 300 K. Close enough, I think using 300 K is acceptable here.

Boltzmann's constant, k_B, is 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. Okay, so all the constants are ready.

The problem has two parts: (a) bandwidth from 0 to 10 kHz, so Δf is 10 kHz, which is 10^4 Hz. And (b) from 10 kHz to 25 kHz, so Δf is 15 kHz, which is 1.5 x 10^4 Hz.

Wait, no, wait. Because when they give a bandwidth like 10 kHz to 25 kHz, the range is 15 kHz. So yes, 25-10=15, so 15,000 Hz.

So for part (a), plug in the numbers. Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, calculate 4 * k_B * T * R. Let's compute that:

4 * 1.38e-23 J/K * 300 K * 4000 Ω.

Wait, let me compute each multiplication step.

4 * 1.38e-23 = 5.52e-23.

Then multiply by 300: 5.52e-23 * 3e2 = 5.52e-23 * 3e2 = 1.656e-20.

Then multiply by 4000 (4e3 Ω): 1.656e-20 * 4e3 = 6.624e-17.

Now, multiply by Δf for each case.

Case (a): Δf=1e4 Hz.

So 6.624e-17 * 1e4 = 6.624e-13.

Then take the square root to get V_rms.

sqrt(6.624e-13) = approx 8.138e-7 volts, which is 0.8138 microvolts. Wait, wait, no, 8.138e-7 is 0.8138e-6, so 8.138e-7 is 0.8138 microvolts, but in terms of volts_rms, that's 8.138e-7 V, or about 8.14 x 10^-7 V.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first parts are around 2.5e-6, which is 2.5 microvolts. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recheck the calculation. Because 8e-7 is 0.8 microvolts, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I messed up a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the formula is sqrt(4kTRΔf), but maybe I forgot to account for something else, like the units. Let me recheck.

Wait, 4kTRΔf is correct, so 4 * 1.38e-23 * 300 * 4000 * 1e4.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate more accurately.

Compute 4kTRΔf:

4 * 1.38e-23 = 5.52e-23.

Multiply by 300: 5.52e-23 * 300 = 1.656e-20.

Multiply by 4000: 1.656e-20 *4e3 = 6.624e-17.

Multiply by Δf (1e4 Hz): 6.624e-17 * 1e4 = 6.624e-13.

Square root: sqrt(6.624e-13) = let's compute this.

The square root of 6.624 is approximately 2.575, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7? Wait, no, wait: sqrt(1e-13) is (1e-13)^(1/2) = 1e-6.5 = 3.16e-7. So 2.575 * 3.16e-7.

Wait, 2.575 * 3.16 is approximately 8.14, so 8.14e-7 volts. So about 8.14 x 10^-7 V, which is 0.814 microvolts.

But looking at the options, the first options are around 2.57e-6, which is about 2.57 microvolts. So I'm off by a factor of roughly 3. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the bandwidth. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, maybe the formula is actually without the 4? Let me think again. The Johnson noise formula is V_rms = sqrt(4k_B T R Δf), but sometimes sources write it without the 4, maybe using a different expression. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the formula again.

Wait, another version of the formula is V_rms = sqrt( (k_B * T) / (R) ) * sqrt(Δf) * sqrt(4), but no, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the exact formula. Oh wait, another approach: the noise voltage is given by V = sqrt(4k_B T R Δf). So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but let me recalculate the numbers again, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

So 4 * 1.38e-23 = 5.52e-23.

5.52e-23 * 300 = 1.656e-20.

1.656e-20 *4000 = 1.656e-20 *4e3 = 6.624e-17.

6.624e-17 * 1e4 (for part a) = 6.624e-13.

sqrt(6.624e-13) = sqrt(6.624) * 1e-6.5.

sqrt(6.624) is about 2.575, and 1e-6.5 is 3.162e-7.

So 2.575 * 3.162e-7 = approx 8.14e-7 V.

Hmm, that's 8.14e-7 V, which is 0.814 microvolts. But none of the options have that for part (a). So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should check the resistor value. Oh, the resistor is 40k, which is 40,000 Ohms, so R=4e4 Ω, not 4e3. Oh wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. Because 40k is 40,000, which is 4e4, not 4e3. Oh! That's a big error.

So let's correct that. R is 4e4 Ω.

So redoing the calculation:

4 * 1.38e-23 = 5.52e-23.

Multiply by 300: 5.52e-23 *3e2 = 1.656e-20.

Multiply by 4e4: 1.656e-20 *4e4 = 6.624e-16.

Multiply by Δf: for part (a) Δf=1e4 Hz.

So 6.624e-16 *1e4 =6.624e-12.

Square root of 6.624e-12 is sqrt(6.624) * sqrt(1e-12) = 2.575 * 1e-6 = 2.575e-6 V.

Ah, that's approximately 2.57 x10^-6 V, which matches some of the options.

So part (a) gives 2.57e-6 V.

Now for part (b), Δf is 25 kHz -10 kHz =15 kHz=1.5e4 Hz.

So compute 6.624e-16 * 1.5e4 = 9.936e-12.

Square root of 9.936e-12 is sqrt(9.936) *1e-6.

sqrt(9.936) is approx 3.154, so 3.154e-6 V, which is 3.15e-6 V.

So the two values are 2.57e-6 V and 3.15e-6 V.

Looking at the options, option D says 2.57e-6 and 3.15e-6. Option A is 2.57e-6 and 4.15e-6. Option D matches.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations quickly.

Alternative approach for part (b): Δf=15 kHz=1.5e4 Hz.

So 4kTRΔf for R=4e4, Δf=1.5e4.

Compute 4 *1.38e-23 *300 *4e4 *1.5e4.

Wait, but that's 4*1.38e-23=5.52e-23.

5.52e-23 *300=1.656e-20.

1.656e-20 *4e4=6.624e-16.

6.624e-16 *1.5e4=9.936e-12.

sqrt(9.936e-12)=sqrt(9.936)*1e-6=3.154e-6.

Yes, that's correct.

So the two parts are 2.57e-6 and 3.15e-6.

Looking at the options, option D is "2.57 × 10^-6 volts_rms and 3.15 × 10^-6 volts_rms". So the correct answer should be option D.

To calculate the root mean square (rms) thermal noise voltage for a 40 kΩ resistor at a room temperature of 27°C, we use the Johnson-Nyquist noise formula:

\[
V_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{4 k_B T R \Delta f}
\]

Where:
- \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) (Boltzmann's constant),
- \( T = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \) (temperature in Kelvin),
- \( R = 40 \, \text{kΩ} = 4 \times 10^3 \, \Omega \),
- \( \Delta f \) is the bandwidth in Hz.

### Part (a): Bandwidth = 0 to 10 kHz (\( \Delta f = 10 \, \text{kHz} = 10^4 \, \text{Hz} \))
1. Compute \( 4 k_B T R \):
   \[
   4 \cdot 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 300 \cdot 4 \times 10^3 = 6.624 \times 10^{-16}
   \]
2. Multiply by \( \Delta f \):
   \[
   6.624 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 10^4 = 6.624 \times 10^{-12}
   \]
3. Take the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{6.624 \times 10^{-12}} = 2.575 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V}
   \]

Thus, the rms thermal noise voltage for part (a) is approximately \( 2.57 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V} \).

### Part (b): Bandwidth = 10 kHz to 25 kHz (\( \Delta f = 15 \, \text{kHz} = 1.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{Hz} \))
1. Compute \( 4 k_B T R \):
   \[
   4 \cdot 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 300 \cdot 4 \times 10^3 = 6.624 \times 10^{-16}
   \]
2. Multiply by \( \Delta f \):
   \[
   6.624 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 1.5 \times 10^4 = 9.936 \times 10^{-12}
   \]
3. Take the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{9.936 \times 10^{-12}} = 3.154 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V}
   \]

Thus, the rms thermal noise voltage for part (b) is approximately \( 3.15 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V} \).

### Final Answer
The rms thermal noise voltages for the given bandwidths are \( 2.57 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V} \) and \( 3.15 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{V} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
