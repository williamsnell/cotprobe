Okay, so I have this problem where an investor deposits $1000 in an account that pays 8% interest, compounded monthly. Also, the investor adds $25 each month. I need to find the balance after 3 years. Hmm, I remember that compound interest can be calculated with a specific formula, especially when there are regular contributions. 

Wait, the formula for compound interest with regular contributions is a bit different from the standard one. Oh right, it's the future value of an annuity plus the future value of the initial deposit. So the initial deposit earns interest, and each monthly deposit also earns interest for the time they're in the account.

The initial deposit is $1000. The monthly contributions are $25. The annual interest rate is 8%, but since it's compounded monthly, I need to divide that by 12 to get the monthly rate. So 8% divided by 12 is 0.006666... or approximately 0.0066667.

The time period is 3 years, which is 36 months. So n is 36.

The formula for the future value of the initial deposit (PV) is PV * (1 + r)^n. So that's 1000 * (1 + 0.0066667)^36. Let me calculate that part first.

Then, for the monthly contributions of $25, which form an annuity. The future value of an ordinary annuity is given by PMT * [((1 + r)^n - 1)/r]. So that's 25 multiplied by [((1 + 0.0066667)^36 -1)/0.0066667].

Wait, I should make sure I get the order right. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, the initial deposit's future value:

1000 * (1.0066667)^36.

I can compute 1.0066667 raised to the 36th power. Let me see, 0.0066667 is 1/150, but maybe I should just calculate it step by step. Alternatively, I can remember that (1 + r)^n can be calculated using the exponential function, but maybe it's easier to use logarithms or just approximate it.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest. Let me compute (1.0066667)^36.

I think I can compute that using the rule of 72 or just logarithms. Alternatively, maybe I can use an approximate value. But perhaps I should just compute it accurately.

Alternatively, use the formula step by step. Wait, maybe I can compute it as e^(36 * ln(1.0066667)).

The natural logarithm of 1.0066667 is approximately 0.006645, because ln(1+x) ≈x -x²/2 +x³/3..., for small x. So x is 0.0066667, so ln(1.0066667) ≈0.006645.

Then, 36 * 0.006645 = 0.23922. So e^0.23922 is approximately 1.2702 (since e^0.2 is about 1.2214, e^0.23 is about 1.258, e^0.239 is about 1.270).

Wait, let me check that with a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that (1 + 0.0066667)^36 is approximately (1.0066667)^36.

Alternatively, another approach: 8% annual rate, so over 3 years, the effective annual rate would be (1.08)^3, but since it's monthly compounding, it's actually (1 + 0.08/12)^36. Oh wait, same as before.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute (1.0066667)^36.

Let me compute step by step:

After 1 month: 1.0066667

After 2 months: (1.0066667)^2 = approx 1.0133778

After 3 months: approx 1.0201345

Wait, maybe that's too slow. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using a better method.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest for the initial deposit:

FV_initial = 1000 * (1 + 0.08/12)^(36) 

So that's 1000 * (1.0066667)^36.

I think I can look up that the value of (1.0066667)^36 is approximately 1.270237. So FV_initial is 1000 * 1.270237 = 1270.237.

Now, the monthly contributions: each $25 is added at the end of each month, so it's an ordinary annuity. The formula for the future value is:

FV_annuity = 25 * [ ((1 + r)^n - 1) / r ]

Plugging in the numbers:

r = 0.0066667, n=36.

So ((1.0066667)^36 -1) is (1.270237 -1) = 0.270237.

Divide that by 0.0066667: 0.270237 / 0.0066667 ≈40.5236.

So FV_annuity =25 * 40.5236 ≈1013.09.

Wait, let me be more precise. Let me compute 0.270237 / 0.0066667.

0.0066667 is 1/150, so 1/0.0066667 is 150.

So 0.270237 * 150 = ?

0.270237 * 150: 0.27 *150 is 40.5, 0.000237*150=0.03555. So total is 40.53555.

So FV_annuity =25 * 40.53555 ≈1013.38875.

So total FV is 1270.237 + 1013.38875 ≈2283.626.

Looking at the options, option G is $2283.63, which matches this.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a rounding error.

Wait, the initial deposit's future value is 1000*(1.0066667)^36.

Using a calculator, (1.0066667)^36:

We can compute it more accurately. Let me compute it step by step.

Compute (1.0066667)^36:

Let me compute using logarithms.

ln(1.0066667) = approximately 0.0066445.

Multiply by 36: 0.0066445 *36 = 0.239202.

e^0.239202 ≈ 1.2703.

So 1000 *1.2703 =1270.3.

Now the annuity part:

Each payment is $25. The formula is PMT * [( (1+r)^n -1 ) / r ].

So (1.0066667)^36=1.270237, so numerator is 0.270237.

Divide by 0.0066667: 0.270237 / 0.0066667.

As before, that's approximately 40.5355.

Multiply by 25: 25 *40.5355=1013.3875.

Adding to the initial deposit's FV: 1270.3 +1013.3875=2283.6875.

Rounding to two decimal places, it's approximately $2283.69. But looking at the options, option G is $2283.63, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps I made a slight miscalculation in the exponent.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute (1.0066667)^36 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a more precise calculation method.

Wait, let me compute (1.0066667)^36 using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as (1.0066667)^(36).

But to get a precise value, perhaps I should use a better method.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for compound interest exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more accurate value for (1.0066667)^36.

Using a calculator, 0.08/12 is 0.00666666667.

Compute (1.00666666667)^36.

Using a calculator: 1.00666666667 raised to 36.

I can compute this as e^(36 * ln(1.00666666667)).

ln(1.00666666667) is approximately 0.006644520284.

Multiply by 36: 0.23920272.

e^0.23920272 ≈ 1.2702373.

So 1000 *1.2702373 =1270.2373.

Now for the annuity:

FV = 25 * [ (1.00666666667^36 -1 ) / 0.00666666667 ]

Which is 25 * [ (1.2702373 -1 ) / 0.00666666667 ]

Which is 25 * (0.2702373 / 0.00666666667 )

0.2702373 / 0.00666666667 = 40.53552.

So 25 *40.53552=1013.388.

Total FV is 1270.2373 +1013.388= 2283.6253.

So approximately $2283.63.

Which matches option G exactly, so the answer is G.
</think>

To determine the balance in the account after 3 years, we calculate the future value of both the initial deposit and the monthly contributions. The interest rate is 8% annually, compounded monthly, so the monthly interest rate is:

\[
r = \frac{0.08}{12} \approx 0.0066667
\]

The total number of months is:

\[
n = 3 \times 12 = 36
\]

### 1. Future Value of the Initial Deposit
The initial deposit of $1000 grows according to the compound interest formula:

\[
FV_{\text{initial}} = PV \times (1 + r)^n
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
FV_{\text{initial}} = 1000 \times (1 + 0.0066667)^{36}
\]

Using a calculator, \((1.0066667)^{36} \approx 1.270237\). Therefore:

\[
FV_{\text{initial}} = 1000 \times 1.270237 \approx 1270.24
\]

### 2. Future Value of the Monthly Contributions
The monthly contributions of $25 form an ordinary annuity. The future value of an annuity is given by:

\[
FV_{\text{annuity}} = PMT \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
FV_{\text{annuity}} = 25 \times \frac{(1 + 0.0066667)^{36} - 1}{0.0066667}
\]

From earlier, \((1.0066667)^{36} \approx 1.270237\). Thus:

\[
FV_{\text{annuity}} = 25 \times \frac{1.270237 - 1}{0.0066667} = 25 \times \frac{0.270237}{0.0066667}
\]

Dividing \(0.270237\) by \(0.0066667\):

\[
\frac{0.270237}{0.0066667} \approx 40.5355
\]

Therefore:

\[
FV_{\text{annuity}} = 25 \times 40.5355 \approx 1013.39
\]

### 3. Total Future Value
The total balance in the account is the sum of the future value of the initial deposit and the future value of the monthly contributions:

\[
FV_{\text{total}} = FV_{\text{initial}} + FV_{\text{annuity}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
FV_{\text{total}} = 1270.24 + 1013.39 \approx 2283.63
\]

### Final Answer
The balance in the account after 3 years is approximately **$2283.63**, which corresponds to option **G**.
