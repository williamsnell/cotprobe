Okay, so I've got this economics question here about utility and demand curves. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about Matt's total utility from consuming bratwurst increasing at a constant rate. Hmm, I remember that utility is all about the satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming a good. So, if the total utility increases at a constant rate, that means each additional bratwurst gives Matt the same amount of additional utility. 

Wait, utility can be marginal or total. Oh right, marginal utility is the utility from each additional unit. So if total utility is increasing at a constant rate, that implies that the marginal utility is constant. Because each bratwurst adds the same amount to total utility, the marginal utility curve is flat, right? 

Now, the question is about the demand curve. I remember that the demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded. But wait, how does marginal utility relate to demand?

Oh, right! The theory of consumer choice says that a consumer will demand a good up to the point where the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods, or where the marginal utility of the good equals its price (assuming income effects are considered). But wait, in this case, Matt's marginal utility for bratwurst is constant. So, if each bratwurst gives him the same marginal utility, how does that affect his demand?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Normally, the demand curve is downward sloping due to the law of diminishing marginal utility. As more of a good is consumed, each additional unit gives less utility, so people are willing to pay less, hence the curve slopes downward. But in this scenario, Matt's marginal utility isn't diminishing—it's constant. So the marginal utility doesn't decrease as he consumes more bratwursts.

So, in the normal case, as the price of bratwurst falls, a consumer would buy more because the marginal utility of each bratwurst is higher than the price. But if marginal utility is constant, then for each additional bratwurst, Matt's marginal utility is the same. Let's say the marginal utility is MU. If the price of a bratwurst is P, Matt will keep buying as long as MU >= P. 

Wait, but in a typical demand curve, as price decreases, quantity demanded increases. So if Matt's MU is constant, his willingness to buy depends on whether P is below MU. For example, if MU is 10 utils per bratwurst, and the price is $5, he'd buy as many as he can because each gives him 10 utils. But if the price rises above 10, he wouldn't buy any. Wait, no, that's only if he stops entirely. But in reality, the quantity demanded would adjust based on where P is relative to MU.

Wait, no, I'm confusing things. Let me think about the demand curve shape. Normally, with diminishing MU, the demand curve slopes downward. If MU is constant, then the demand would be such that any price below MU would lead to infinite demand? That can't be right. Or perhaps, for any price below a certain point, Matt would want to buy all he can. But that doesn't make sense in a normal market.

Wait, no, maybe the demand curve becomes a horizontal line. Because if MU is constant, then the consumer's maximum willingness to pay per unit is MU. So, up to the point where price equals MU, they would buy any quantity. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, another approach: the demand curve is derived from the marginal utility curve. In the standard case, since MU decreases as quantity increases, the demand curve is downward sloping. But if MU is constant, then the demand curve would be horizontal only if the price is at the level of MU. Wait, no, that's not exactly right.

Wait, when the MU is constant, the consumer's willingness to pay for each additional unit doesn't change. So, for all units beyond the first, the consumer is willing to pay the same price. But how does that translate into the demand curve?

Alternatively, think about the demand curve's elasticity. If MU is constant, then the demand is perfectly elastic beyond a certain point. Or maybe it's a straight line.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that when marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is a horizontal line beyond the point where MU equals price. Because each additional unit is worth the same to the consumer. So, if the price is below MU, the consumer would buy as much as possible, leading to a horizontal demand curve at that price level. But in the graph, the demand curve would be a horizontal line because for all quantities beyond a certain point, the price remains the same.

Wait, but this is getting a bit unclear. Let me think of it another way. The demand curve is the consumer's marginal willingness to pay. If marginal utility is constant, then marginal willingness to pay (which is MU divided by the price of other goods, assuming they're measured in the same terms) is also constant. So the demand curve would be a horizontal line because the consumer is willing to pay the same price for each additional unit.

Wait, but that would mean that the quantity demanded doesn't change with price, which isn't the case. Normally, lower prices increase quantity demanded. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another angle: if the total utility increases at a constant rate, then the marginal utility is constant. So, the marginal utility of the nth bratwurst is the same as the (n+1)th. So, for each bratwurst, the consumer is willing to pay the same price. So, in the demand curve, which plots price vs quantity, the quantity would increase as price decreases, but the consumer would buy as much as possible only when price is below their marginal utility.

Wait, but that would mean that the demand curve is downward sloping only if marginal utility decreases. So if marginal utility is constant, then the demand curve would be a horizontal line once price is below marginal utility. But that can't be the case because the demand curve is supposed to show how quantity demanded changes with price.

Wait, perhaps if marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is a horizontal line. Because the consumer's willingness to pay doesn't change with quantity—each additional unit is worth the same. So, for any price below that willingness, the quantity would be unlimited, but that's not practical. Alternatively, perhaps the demand curve is a vertical line, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, no, maybe the demand curve is a horizontal line because the quantity demanded can keep increasing without the price changing. Or perhaps the demand curve is a straight line that's horizontal. Or maybe it's a vertical line.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of it in terms of the law of demand. Normally, as price decreases, quantity demanded increases. If marginal utility is constant, then the consumer's willingness to pay is the same for each additional unit. So, if the price is set below the marginal utility, the consumer would want to buy an infinite quantity. But in reality, they are constrained by their budget. So, perhaps the demand curve would be a horizontal line at the price level equal to marginal utility beyond a certain quantity. Or maybe that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to think of the demand curve. If the marginal utility is constant, then the marginal benefit (MU) is the same for all units. The demand curve is where MB = price. So, for each unit, the price must be equal to or below the MB. But since MB is constant, if the price is above MB, quantity demanded is zero. If the price is below MB, the consumer would demand infinite quantity, but in reality, they're limited by their income. So, perhaps the demand curve would be a horizontal line at the MB level beyond a certain quantity. Or maybe it's a vertical line at a certain quantity where MB equals price.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to recall a specific example. If the marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is a horizontal line beyond the point where price equals marginal utility. Because beyond that point, the consumer is willing to pay the same price for each additional unit. So, the demand curve would be horizontal. But wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the demand curve is perfectly elastic. Because if the price drops a little, the quantity demanded increases a lot. So, the curve would be a horizontal line at the price level equal to marginal utility. So, any quantity at that price.

Wait, but in the question, it's asking what the demand curve would look like. The options are: options include horizontal (C), vertical (E), downward sloping (G), upward sloping (D), etc.

Wait, in the standard case, without diminishing MU, the demand curve is horizontal beyond the point where P = MU. So, the demand curve would be a horizontal line. So, option C: Horizontal.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think again. If MU is constant, then the consumer's marginal willingness to pay is constant. So, the demand curve is the same as the marginal utility curve. But demand curves are plotted with price on the y-axis and quantity on the x-axis. So, if marginal utility is constant, the demand curve would be a horizontal line because the price they're willing to pay doesn't change with quantity. So, regardless of how many bratwursts Matt buys, he's willing to pay the same price for each. So the demand curve is a horizontal line.

Wait, no. Wait, the demand curve is the quantity demanded at each price. If the marginal utility is constant, then for any price below MU, the quantity demanded would be unlimited. But since that's not realistic, it's more about how the quantity changes as price changes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the demand curve is horizontal. So, option C.

But another thought: the demand curve is downward sloping only if marginal utility decreases. So, if marginal utility is constant, the demand curve wouldn't slope downward. So, if it's not sloping downward, and it's not upward sloping (which would be unusual), then maybe the curve is a horizontal line. So the answer should be C: Horizontal.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another way to think: if the marginal utility is constant, the consumer's demand doesn't depend on the quantity; they're willing to pay the same for each unit. So, the demand curve would be a horizontal line, meaning that at any price below MU, they buy a lot, but in the graph, it's represented as a horizontal line at the MU price. Or perhaps it's a vertical line if they buy all they can at a certain price.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should consider what the demand curve looks like when marginal utility is zero. But that's not the case here. Alternatively, if marginal utility is always positive and constant, the demand is not affected by the quantity, so the demand is perfectly elastic beyond a certain price. So, the curve would be a horizontal line beyond that price.

Alternatively, think about what would happen if Matt's MU is constant. Let's say MU is 10 for each bratwurst. So, the maximum price Matt would pay is 10. If the price is 15, he won't buy any. If the price is 8, he'd keep buying as many as possible because each gives him 10 utils. But in reality, his income constrains him. So, his demand curve would be a horizontal line at price=10 because beyond that, he wouldn't buy, but wait, no—the demand curve plots quantity against price. So, for any price below 10, Matt's quantity demanded would be very high, but it's a step function. But in continuous terms, perhaps the demand curve is a horizontal line at P=10, beyond some quantity. 

Wait, but that doesn't fit neatly into the multiple-choice options. Alternatively, perhaps the demand curve is vertical, meaning no matter the price, quantity is the same. No, that doesn't make sense because price changes would affect quantity.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is that the demand curve is horizontal. So, the answer is C.

If Matt's total utility from consuming bratwurst increases at a constant rate, this implies that his marginal utility (MU) is constant. Marginal utility represents the additional satisfaction derived from consuming one more unit of a good. When MU is constant, the consumer's willingness to pay for each additional unit does not change. 

In the context of the demand curve, which plots the relationship between price and quantity demanded, a constant MU has specific implications. Normally, the demand curve slopes downward due to the law of diminishing marginal utility, where MU decreases as more units are consumed. However, if MU is constant, the consumer's willingness to pay for each additional unit remains the same. This means that the demand curve would not slope downward. Instead, it would take the form of a horizontal line, as the quantity demanded would increase at a constant price level corresponding to the marginal utility.

Given the options provided, the correct answer is that Matt's demand curve for bratwurst would be horizontal.
