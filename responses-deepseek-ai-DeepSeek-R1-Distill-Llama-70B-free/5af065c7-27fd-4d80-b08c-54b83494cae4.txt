The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.
—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795

Okay, so I've got this question about Enlightenment intellectuals based on a passage from Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking which characteristic of Enlightenment thinkers is best illustrated by Paine's ideas in the given excerpt. The options are A through J.

Looking at the passage, Paine talks a lot about individual belief and criticizes organized religions. He says things like, "My own mind is my own church," which suggests he values personal belief over structured religious institutions. He also mentions that he doesn't believe in the creeds of various churches, calling them human inventions meant to terrify and enslave. So, he's definitely against organized religion and promotes individual belief systems.

Now, going through the options:

Option A: Many promoted individual belief over organized religions. That seems to fit because Paine is clearly against organized churches and supports personal belief.

Option B: Most focused on accumulating power through religious institutions. No, the passage actually condemns such practices, so this doesn't fit.

Option C: Against equality. No, Paine believes in equality, as he states, "I believe in the equality of man."

Option D: Used salons and pamphlets to communicate. The passage is from a pamphlet, which supports this, but the question is about characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals in general. While D is correct about their methods, the main focus here is on their ideas about religion and individual belief.

Option E: Believed in one religion's superiority. Paine doesn't seem to do that; he rejects all major churches.

Option F: Believed science would solve all problems. The passage doesn't mention scientific discoveries, so I'm not sure about this.

Option G: Science irrelevant. Again, the passage doesn't talk about science, so this might not be the best fit.

Option H: Most rejected religion for atheism. Paine does reject organized religion but he says he believes in one God, so he's not an atheist. Therefore, H isn't correct.

Option I: Many were scientists. The passage doesn't indicate Paine was a scientist, so this isn't the best choice.

Option J: Believed in maintaining traditional religion. No, he's against that.

So, the best fit seems to be Option A. Paine's emphasis on individual belief over organized religion aligns with this characteristic of Enlightenment thinkers, who often valued reason and individualism over traditional institutions.

The excerpt from Thomas Paine's *The Age of Reason* highlights his rejection of organized religion and his emphasis on individual belief systems. Paine critiques religious institutions as human inventions designed to control and exploit, instead advocating for personal conviction and reason. This aligns with the Enlightenment intellectual characteristic of promoting individual belief over organized religion.

**Answer: A**
