The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A doctor was the owner of 1,500 acres of undeveloped timberland. In September 1989, the doctor executed a warranty deed conveying the timberland property to a dentist in fee simple. The dentist recorded immediately in the Grantor Grantee Index. Then in April 1990, the dentist conveyed the same tract to a buyer in fee simple by warranty deed. The buyer paid full market value and recorded the deed at once in the Grantor Grantee Index. The land in question had never been occupied, fenced, or cleared except that between the years 1986 2010, a mining company, one mile from the property, regularly drove trucks over a cleared path pursuant to a 1986 agreement with the doctor. The agreement, which was duly recorded, provided that "the parties expressly agree and the doctor promises that the doctor and his successors shall refrain from obstructing the said described pathway across the doctor's land, which the mining company and its successors may perpetually use as a road, in consideration of which the mining company and its successors will pay the sum of $700 per annum. "In 1990, after the conveyance from the dentist, the buyer informed the mining company that he would no longer honor the 1986 agreement permitting the mining company to use the pathway. The mining company brought an action for specific performance. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the buyer, because the mining company's use of the pathway was not a legally binding agreement.
B: the mining company, because the possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners.
C: the mining company, because the agreement gives them perpetual use of the pathway.
D: the mining company, because the agreement was duly recorded and thus legally binding.
E: the buyer, because the mining company has no legal right to the use of the pathway.
F: the buyer, because there was no privity of estate between the buyer and the mining company.
G: the buyer, because the agreement was with the original landowner, not the buyer.
H: the mining company, because they have paid an annual fee for the use of the pathway.
I: the mining company, because their property interest would "run with the land. "
J: the buyer, because the mining company's interest was extinguished by the subsequent conveyance.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let's break it down step by step. The question involves a series of conveyances and an easement agreement. 

First, the setup: a doctor owns 1,500 acres of timberland. In 1989, he conveys it to a dentist via a warranty deed. The dentist records it immediately. Then in 1990, the dentist conveys it to a buyer, who also records right away. So the chain of title is Doctor → Dentist → Buyer.

Now, the land has a pathway that a mining company has been using since 1986 under an agreement with the doctor. The agreement was recorded and says that the doctor and his successors won't obstruct the pathway, and the mining company can use it perpetually. In exchange, they pay $700 annually.

In 1990, after the dentist sold it to the buyer, the buyer tells the mining company to stop using the pathway. The mining company sues for specific performance.

The question is about who wins. The options are A through J.

I remember that when dealing with easements, especially appurtenant ones, they can "run with the land," meaning they bind future owners. But this depends on whether the easement was properly created and recorded.

Wait, the agreement was between the doctor and the mining company in 1986. It was recorded, so that should put subsequent purchasers on notice. The doctor's warranty deed to the dentist was in 1989. The dentist then conveyed to the buyer in 1990. The dentist's deed would be subject to any existing easements, especially if they were recorded.

So the key issue is whether the mining company's easement is binding on the buyer. Since the agreement was recorded, the buyer should have known about it when they took the deed. In property law, a recorded easement is generally enforceable against subsequent purchasers because they are deemed to have constructive notice.

But wait, what kind of easement is this? The agreement is a perpetual right of way. It's in the form of a promise not to obstruct and a grant to use the pathway. So it's an easement in gross, perhaps, because it's for the mining company's benefit, not benefiting a particular piece of land (appurtenant easement). Easements in gross can be trickier because they don't necessarily run with the land unless they are specifically made to do so.

Wait, but I think in some jurisdictions, commercial easements in gross can be enforceable against subsequent owners if properly recorded. Also, the agreement here says "the doctor and his successors," which suggests that the easement is intended to bind future owners.

So the dentist, as a grantee from the doctor, would take the land subject to the easement because it was recorded before the dentist's ownership. Then when the dentist conveys to the buyer, the buyer also takes subject to that easement.

So the mining company's right is an easement that runs with the land. The buyer, as a subsequent owner, cannot terminate it because the easement is appurtenant (or at least binding) and was properly recorded.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the mining company wins because the agreement gives perpetual use. That's part of it, but the main point is whether it's binding on the buyer.

Option D says because it's recorded. Recording puts the buyer on notice, so yes, but the underlying issue is that it's an easement that runs with the land.

Option I says the mining company wins because their interest runs with the land. That sounds correct because the easement was intended to be perpetual and the agreement was recorded, so it's binding on successors.

Option B says the possessor of a servient interest would prevail against subsequent owners. Wait, the servient estate is the land burdened by the easement. The mining company holds the easement, so they are the dominant estate. So maybe B isn't the right reasoning.

Option E and others that say the buyer wins seem incorrect because the easement should still be valid.

So the correct answer should be I: the mining company, because their property interest runs with the land. Alternatively, C could be correct if it's about the perpetual grant.

Wait, another angle: the agreement was between the doctor and the mining company. It says the doctor and his successors won't obstruct. So when the dentist took the land, he was subject to the easement, and when he sold to the buyer, the buyer also took it subject. So the easement is enforceable against the buyer.

Thus, the mining company can enforce the easement, so judgment is for them. Looking at the options, I think I is the best because it's about the interest running with the land.

The question revolves around whether the mining company's easement, established by a 1986 agreement with the doctor, is enforceable against the buyer, a subsequent owner of the property. The agreement granted the mining company perpetual use of a pathway in exchange for an annual payment and was duly recorded. The buyer, after acquiring the property, refused to honor the agreement, leading to the mining company's lawsuit for specific performance.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Nature of the Easement**: The agreement created an easement, which is a right to use another's land for a specific purpose. The easement was intended to be perpetual and was recorded, putting subsequent purchasers on constructive notice.

2. **Recording and Notice**: The easement was recorded in 1986, before the doctor conveyed the property to the dentist in 1989 and before the dentist conveyed it to the buyer in 1990. Recording ensures that subsequent owners, like the buyer, are deemed to have notice of the easement.

3. **"Run with the Land"**: The agreement explicitly stated that the doctor and his successors would not obstruct the pathway, indicating that the easement was intended to bind future owners. In property law, easements generally "run with the land," meaning they are enforceable against subsequent owners, especially when properly recorded.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option C**: Correctly states that the agreement grants perpetual use, but the enforceability against the buyer depends on the easement running with the land.
   - **Option I**: Accurately reflects that the mining company's property interest (the easement) runs with the land, making it binding on the buyer.
   - Other options (e.g., A, E, F, G, J) incorrectly suggest that the easement is not enforceable against the buyer, which contradicts the principles of recorded easements and their enforceability against subsequent owners.

The correct answer is **I**, as the mining company's easement runs with the land and is enforceable against the buyer.

Answer: I
