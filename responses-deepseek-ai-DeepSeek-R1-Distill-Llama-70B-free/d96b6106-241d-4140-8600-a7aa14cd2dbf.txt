Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the Gibbs free-energy change for the solidification of copper at a specific temperature. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question gives me the reaction: Cu(l) → Cu(s). The standard enthalpy change, ΔH°, is -3100 cal at the melting point of 1356 K. They also provide the ΔCp as -2.09 + 1.5e-3*T. And the temperature for spontaneous solidification is 1120 K. I need to find the Gibbs free-energy change at 1120 K.

Wait, I remember that Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) is related to the enthalpy change (ΔH) and entropy change (ΔS) by the equation ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. But wait, that's at a specific temperature. Oh, but since the temperature here isn't the same as the standard condition (which is the melting point, 1356 K), I think I need to calculate ΔH and ΔS at 1120 K first.

Right, because the ΔH given is at 1356 K, but we need it at 1120 K. So I should use the heat capacity (ΔCp) to adjust ΔH and ΔS to the new temperature.

So the approach would be:
1. Calculate ΔH at 1120 K using ΔH° at 1356 K and the ΔCp.
2. Calculate ΔS at 1120 K similarly.
3. Then plug into ΔG° = ΔH - TΔS to get the Gibbs free energy change.

Wait, but the equation for ΔH at a different temperature is ΔH(T) = ΔH° + ∫ΔCp dT from T_initial to T. Since ΔCp is given as a function of T, I'll have to integrate it between 1356 K and 1120 K.

Let me write down the variables to make it clear.

ΔH° is -3100 cal at T_melt =1356 K.
We need ΔH at T = 1120 K.

So the change in temperature, ΔT, is 1120 - 1356 = -236 K.

The formula for ΔH(T) would be:
ΔH(T) = ΔH° + ∫(from T_melt to T) ΔCp dT.

ΔCp is given as -2.09 + 1.5e-3 * T. So I need to integrate this function from 1356 to 1120.

The integral of ΔCp dT would be:

∫ΔCp dT = ∫(-2.09 + 0.0015 T) dT
= -2.09*T + 0.0015*(T^2/2) + C
So evaluating from 1356 to 1120:

[ (-2.09)(1120) + 0.00075*(1120)^2 ] - [ (-2.09)(1356) + 0.00075*(1356)^2 ]

Let me compute each part:

First, compute for T=1120:
-2.09 * 1120 = Let's see, 2 * 1120 is 2240, 0.09 is 100.8. So 2.09 * 1120 = 2240 + 100.8 = 2340.8. So -2340.8.

Then 0.00075*(1120^2). 1120 squared is 1,254,400. Multiply by 0.00075: 1,254,400 * 0.00075 = 941.8.

So for T=1120, it's (-2340.8 + 941.8) = -1399 cal? Wait, wait—wait, the units. Because ΔCp is in cal/(mol·K), so integrating gives cal/mol.

Wait, actually, the integral will give units of cal/(mol), because ΔCp is cal/(mol·K), multiplied by dT (K), so cal/mol.

So for T=1120: -2340.8 + 941.8 = -1399 cal/mol.

Now for T=1356:
-2.09 * 1356 = Let's compute that. 2 * 1356 = 2712. 0.09 * 1356 = 122.04. So 2.09 * 1356 = 2712 + 122.04 = 2834.04. So -2834.04.

Then 0.00075*(1356)^2. 1356 squared: Let's compute 1350^2 = 1,822,500. 6^2=36, and cross terms 2*1350*6=16,200. So 1356^2 = 1,822,500 + 16,200 +36= 1,838,736.

0.00075 * 1,838,736 = 1,379,052 * 0.00075. Wait, no, 1,838,736 * 0.00075. Let's compute that.

1,838,736 * 0.0001 = 183.8736. So 0.00075 is 0.0001 *7.5, so 183.8736 *7.5 = 1379.008.

So for T=1356, it's (-2834.04 + 1379.008) = (-2834.04 + 1379) = let's compute: 2834-1379=1455, so -1455.04.

Wait, wait, no: 1356^2 is 1,838,736. So 0.00075 * 1,838,736 = 0.00075 * 1,838,736 = 1,379, 052? Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1,838,736 * 0.00075 = (1,838,736 * 75) / 100,000.

75 * 1,838,736 = 137,905,200.

Divide by 100,000: 1379.052.

So 0.00075 * (1356)^2 = 1379.052.

So the T=1356 part is (-2834.04 + 1379.052) = (-2834.04 + 1379.052) = approximately -1455. (Wait, 2834 -1379 is 1455; so it's -1455 approximately. Let's compute exactly: 2834.04 -1379.052 = 1455. (Because 1379.052 + 1455 = 2834.052, which is about 2834.04, so yes, approximately -1455.)

So the integral from 1356 to 1120 is [(-1399)] - [(-1455)] = (-1399) + 1455 = 56 cal/mol.

Wait, because integral from a to b is F(b) - F(a), so it's (value at T=1120) minus (value at T=1356). So F(1120) is (-1399), F(1356) is (-1455). So F(1120) - F(1356) = (-1399) - (-1455) )= 56 cal/mol.

So ΔH at 1120 K is ΔH° + 56 cal/mol.

ΔH° is given as -3100 cal/mol. So ΔH(T) = -3100 +56 = -3044 cal/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the integral is ∫(from T_melt to T) ΔCp dT. So when T is lower than T_melt (1120 < 1356), the change in H is negative?

Wait, no, the integral calculation was 56 cal/mol. So ΔH = ΔH° + 56 = -3100 +56 = -3044 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait: since we're going from higher T (1356) to lower T (1120), which is a negative ΔT, but the integral came out positive 56. Hmm, maybe correct.

Wait, but let me think. At higher temperatures, for an exothermic process, when cooling, the enthalpy change would adjust accordingly. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed.

Next, I need to find the entropy change at 1120 K. Because the standard entropy change is ΔS° = ΔH° / T_melt.

Wait, no. At the melting point, the Gibbs free energy change is zero because it's the equilibrium point. So ΔG° = 0 at T_melt. So ΔG° = ΔH° - T_melt * ΔS° = 0 → ΔS° = ΔH° / T_melt.

But wait, that's the standard entropy change at T_melt. But I need the entropy change at 1120 K. So I have to adjust ΔS as well.

Wait, the entropy change at any temperature T is given by:

ΔS(T) = ΔS° + ∫(from T_melt to T) (ΔCp / T) dT.

Because dS = (Cp / T) dT.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate ΔS° = ΔH° / T_melt.

2. Then compute the integral of ΔCp / T dT from T_melt to T.

3. So ΔS(T) = ΔS° + (integral).

Let me compute that.

First, ΔS° = ΔH° / T_melt.

ΔH° is -3100 cal/mol.

T_melt is 1356 K.

So ΔS° = (-3100) / 1356 ≈ let's compute that.

3100 /1356 ≈ 2.287 cal/(mol·K), but since ΔH° is negative, ΔS° is negative.

So ΔS° ≈ -2.287 cal/(mol·K).

But let's compute more accurately:

1356 × 2 = 2712; 3100-2712=388.

So 3100 /1356 = 2 + 388/1356.

388 ÷1356 ≈ 0.286 (since 1356 * 0.286 ≈ 388). So ≈ 2.286, so ΔS° ≈ -2.286 cal/(mol·K).

But wait, I need to keep more decimals for accurate calculation.

Now, the integral ∫(from 1356 to 1120) [ΔCp / T] dT.

ΔCp is given as (-2.09 + 0.0015 T).

So the integrand is [ (-2.09 + 0.0015 T) / T ] dT.

Simplify the integrand:

= (-2.09 / T) + 0.0015 dT.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (-2.09 / T + 0.0015) dT from 1356 to 1120.

Which is:

-2.09 ln(T) + 0.0015 T evaluated from 1356 to 1120.

So compute for T=1120 and T=1356.

At T=1120:

-2.09 * ln(1120) + 0.0015 * 1120.

At T=1356:

-2.09 * ln(1356) + 0.0015 *1356.

Compute each part:

Compute ln(1120):

ln(1000)=6.9078, ln(1120)= ln(1000*(1.12))= ln(1000)+ln(1.12)=6.9078 + 0.1133=7.0211.

So ln(1120)= ~7.0211.

Similarly, ln(1356): Let's compute. 1356 is between e^7 (1096) and e^7.5 (1808). Let's compute ln(1356).

But perhaps I can use a calculator approach. Let me think: 1356 is approximately 1350.

ln(1350)= ln(1.35 * 1000)= ln(1.35) + ln(1000)= 0.3001 + 6.9078=7.2079.

Wait, but 1356 is 6 more than 1350. So using a linear approximation:

d(ln x)/dx = 1/x. So for x=1350, dx=6, d(ln x)=6/1350≈0.00444.

So ln(1356) ≈7.2079 +0.00444≈7.2123.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

But perhaps for the sake of time, I'll proceed with approximate values.

So, at T=1120:

-2.09 *7.0211 = let's compute 2 *7.0211=14.0422, 0.09 *7.0211≈0.6319. So 2.09*7.0211≈14.0422 +0.6319=14.6741. So -2.09 * ln(1120)= -14.6741.

0.0015 *1120=1.68.

So the first term is -14.6741 +1.68 = -12.9941.

At T=1356:

-2.09 * ln(1356)= -2.09 *7.2123≈-2.09 *7.2= approximately 15.048, but more accurately:

7.2123 *2=14.4246, 7.2123 *0.09=0.6491. So 14.4246 +0.6491=15.0737. So -2.09 *7.2123≈-15.0737.

0.0015 *1356=2.034.

So the second term is -15.0737 +2.034≈-13.0397.

So the integral from 1356 to 1120 is [ (-12.9941) - (-13.0397) ) ] = (-12.9941 +13.0397) = 0.0456 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, because the integral is [value at 1120] - [value at 1356] → (-12.9941) - (-13.0397) )= 0.0456.

So the integral is approximately 0.0456 cal/(mol).

So the entropy change at 1120 K is:

ΔS(T) = ΔS° + 0.0456 = (-2.286) +0.0456 ≈-2.2404 cal/(mol·K).

Now, with ΔH(T) = -3044 cal/mol and ΔS(T)= -2.2404 cal/(mol·K), and T=1120 K, we can compute ΔG.

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.

= (-3044) - (1120)*(-2.2404).

Compute 1120 * 2.2404.

1120 *2 =2240, 1120 *0.2404= 269.248. So total 2240 +269.248=2509.248.

So ΔG = (-3044) + 2509.248 = (-3044 +2509.248) = -534.752 cal/mol.

Wait, that's approximately -535 cal/mol.

Looking at the options:

Options are A: -470, B:-500, C:-700, D:-440, E:-610, F:-380, G:-540, H:-560, I:-650, J:-630.

Wait, the closest option to -535 would be G: -540 or H:-560. But wait, perhaps my calculations were a bit approximate and I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral calculations.

Let me recheck the integral for ΔH:

ΔCp is -2.09 + 0.0015 T.

Integral from 1356 to 1120:

= [ (-2.09 T + 0.00075 T^2 ) ] from 1356 to 1120.

At T=1120:

-2.09 *1120 = let's compute 2 *1120=2240, 0.09*1120=100.8 → 2240+100.8=2340.8 → -2340.8.

0.00075*(1120)^2: 1120^2=1,254,400 → 0.00075 *1,254,400 = 941.8.

So sum: -2340.8 +941.8 = -1399 cal/mol.

At T=1356:

-2.09 *1356 = let's compute 2*1356=2712, 0.09*1356= 122.04 → 2712+122.04=2834.04 → -2834.04.

0.00075*(1356)^2: 1356^2=1,838,736 → 0.00075 *1,838,736=1379.052.

Sum: -2834.04 +1379.052= -1455. (approx.)

So the integral is (-1399) - (-1455) )=56 cal/mol. So ΔH(T)= -3100 +56= -3044 cal/mol.

That seems correct.

Now for the entropy part.

ΔS(T) = ΔS° + ∫(ΔCp/T) dT from 1356 to 1120.

ΔS° = -3100 /1356 ≈-2.287 cal/(mol·K).

The integral part was ≈0.0456 cal/(mol·K).

So ΔS(T)= -2.287 +0.0456 ≈-2.2414 cal/(mol·K).

Then, ΔG=ΔH - TΔS.

= (-3044) - (1120)*(-2.2414).

Compute 1120 *2.2414:

Let me compute 1120 * 2 =2240.

1120 *0.2414 = ?

Compute 1120 *0.2=224.

1120 *0.04=44.8.

1120 *0.0014=1.568.

Adding: 224 +44.8=268.8 +1.568=270.368.

So total 2240 +270.368=2510.368.

So ΔG = (-3044) +2510.368= -533.632 cal/mol.

Approximately -534 cal/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is G: -540 or J: -630, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in
