Okay, so I have this question about the energy eigenvalues of a hydrogen atom. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that the energy levels of a hydrogen atom are quantized and given by a specific formula. Oh right, the formula is E_n = -13.6 eV / n², where n is the principal quantum number. So each energy level n corresponds to a specific energy.

The question asks for the first five energy eigenvalues. That means I need to plug in n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4, and n=5 into the formula.

Let me calculate each one step by step.

For n=1: E_1 = -13.6 / (1)^2 = -13.6 eV.

n=2: E_2 = -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV.

n=3: E_3 = -13.6 / 9 ≈ -1.51 eV.

n=4: E_4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV.

n=5: E_5 = -13.6 / 25 = -0.544 eV, which I think is approximately -0.54 eV.

So looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches these values.

Looking at the options:

Option J: E1=-13.6, E2=-3.4, E3=-1.51, E4=-0.85, E5=-0.54. That matches exactly what I calculated.

Wait, let me double-check the other options to make sure. Option A has E1=-27.2, which is way too low. Option B's E1 is -8.1, which doesn't match. Option C has E1=-21.6, which is not right. Option D starts at -17, nope. Option E is -20.4 for E1, not matching.

Option F starts at -10, which is higher than our E1. G starts at -15, which is also higher than -13.6. H starts at -6.8 which is way higher. I starts at -16.8, which is lower than -13.6.

So the only option that fits is J.

The energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen atom are determined by the formula:

\[
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
\]

where \( n \) is the principal quantum number. For the first five energy levels (\( n = 1 \) to \( n = 5 \)):

- \( E_1 = -\frac{13.6}{1^2} = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_2 = -\frac{13.6}{2^2} = -3.4 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_3 = -\frac{13.6}{3^2} \approx -1.51 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_4 = -\frac{13.6}{4^2} = -0.85 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_5 = -\frac{13.6}{5^2} \approx -0.54 \, \text{eV} \)

Among the given options, only **Option J** matches these calculated values:

- \( E_1 = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_2 = -3.4 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_3 = -1.51 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_4 = -0.85 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_5 = -0.54 \, \text{eV} \)

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J**
