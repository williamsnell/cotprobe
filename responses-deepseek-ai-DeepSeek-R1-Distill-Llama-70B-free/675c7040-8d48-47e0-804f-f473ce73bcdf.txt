Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about enzyme inhibitors, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again: it's about competitive inhibitors and how they exert their effect.

Alright, I remember that enzymes can be inhibited in different ways. The main types are competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive, and maybe some others. But the question is specifically about competitive inhibitors.

So, what do I know about competitive inhibition? From what I studied, competitive inhibitors compete with the substrate for binding to the enzyme. They structurally resemble the substrate, which allows them to fit into the active site of the enzyme. When they bind, they prevent the substrate from binding and being processed. So they're like lookalikes that take the enzyme's attention away from the real substrate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Reversibly modifying amino acids in the active site. Hmm, modifying amino acids sounds more like a covalent change, maybe like what an irreversible inhibitor would do. Competitive inhibitors are usually reversible, so I don't think A is right.

Option B: Irreversibly forming covalent links with the enzyme. Oh wait, that's not competitive inhibition. That sounds more like an irreversible inhibitor, which would be something like a suicide inhibitor. So B isn't the right answer here.

Option C: Irreversibly modifying the active site. Again, that's not competitive. Competitive is reversible, so C is out.

Option D: Reversibly increasing enzyme availability. No, that doesn't make sense. Inhibitors would decrease activity, not increase. Plus, it's about binding substrates—competitive inhibitors would decrease the effective substrate binding because they compete.

Option E: Irreversibly decreasing enzyme availability. That's more like an inactivator, not a competitive inhibitor. Competitive doesn't decrease the number of enzymes available; it just stops them from working when bound.

Option F: Competing with the product for a different binding site. Wait, product inhibition is a different thing. Competitive inhibitors are about the substrate, not the product. So F is probably not correct.

Option G: Competing with the substrate for the same enzyme, different binding site. Wait, no—competitive inhibitors compete for the same binding site as the substrate. Because they mimic the substrate. So if G says different site, that's not it. Oh wait, no. Wait, another thought: non-competitive inhibitors bind elsewhere, not the active site. So G doesn't fit competitive.

Option H: Irreversibly binding to substrate via covalent links. That sounds unrelated. Inhibitors target the enzyme, not the substrate. So H is out.

Option I: Reversibly decreasing enzyme availability. No, that sounds like allosteric inhibition maybe. Competitive inhibition doesn't decrease the number; it's about the substrate's access.

Option J: Competing with substrate for same enzyme and same binding site. That fits. Because the inhibitor and substrate are both going for the active site.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be J. Because competitive inhibitors directly compete with the substrate for the active site of the enzyme.
</think>

A competitive inhibitor exerts its effect by competing with the substrate for the same enzyme and binding to the same active site. This is because competitive inhibitors structurally resemble the substrate, allowing them to occupy the active site and prevent the substrate from binding and being processed. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, E, H**: These options describe irreversible modifications or covalent interactions, which are characteristic of irreversible inhibitors, not competitive inhibitors. Competitive inhibition is reversible.
- **D, I**: These options suggest changes in the number of available enzyme molecules, which is unrelated to competitive inhibition. Competitive inhibitors do not alter enzyme availability but instead block substrate binding.
- **F**: This describes competition with the product, which is not relevant to competitive inhibition.
- **G**: This describes competition for a different binding site, which applies to non-competitive inhibitors, not competitive ones.
- **J**: This correctly describes competitive inhibition, where the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the same binding site on the enzyme.

Thus, the correct answer is:

J
