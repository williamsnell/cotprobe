Question:

A gardener sued a homeowner for breach of contract. The gardener claims that the homeowner hired him to perform landscape work at his home. After performing the gardening services, the homeowner paid him $100. The gardener, who speaks only English, contends that the homeowner, who speaks only Japanese, originally agreed to pay him $200 for the work. When the parties entered into their agreement, the gardener was accompanied by his friend, who is now deceased, who spoke both English and Japanese. This jurisdiction has a typical Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the gardener now seeks to testify to the terms of his agreement with the homeowner as communicated to him by his friend. Upon objection by the homeowner's attorney, the gardener's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, as it is hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute.
B: inadmissible, because the gardener did not have a translator present during the agreement.
C: admissible, as it is relevant to the case and not excluded by the Dead Man's Statute.
D: admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.
E: inadmissible, because the friend was not an official translator.
F: admissible, because it is a statement of a deceased person.
G: admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.
H: inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.
I: admissible, as it is a statement made during the course of employment.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this evidence question about the admissibility of testimony. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a gardener is suing a homeowner for breach of contract. The gardener claims they agreed on $200 for the work, but only got $100. The issue arises because the two don't speak the same language—gardener speaks English, homeowner Japanese. So when they made the agreement, the gardener brought a friend who spoke both languages. Now, the friend is deceased, and the gardener wants to testify about what the friend told him regarding the agreement. But the homeowner's attorney objects.

The question is whether this testimony is admissible. The options are A to J, but let me focus on the relevant ones.

First, I need to figure out if the gardener's testimony is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the gardener is testifying about what his friend told him about the agreement. So the friend's translation would be a statement made by the friend, not by the gardener himself.

Wait, but the friend was acting as a translator. So when the gardener and homeowner were making the contract, the friend was translating between them. So when the homeowner offered $200 in Japanese, the friend translated that to the gardener in English. So the friend's statement (the translation) is being offered to show that the homeowner agreed to pay $200. That would make it hearsay because it's the friend's statement used to prove the truth of the matter (that the homeowner agreed to $200).

But wait, is there an exception? The friend is deceased, so maybe the Dead Man's Statute applies. The Dead Man's Statute, also known as the Dead Man Act, generally prohibits a party from testifying against the estate of a deceased person about transactions or communications with the deceased. But in this case, the gardener is testifying about his own conversation with the friend, not about a transaction with the deceased. Wait, no—the deceased is the friend, not a party to the contract. So maybe the Dead Man's Statute isn't directly applicable here because the friend isn't the one who died as a party to the transaction.

Alternatively, maybe the friend's statement is being offered under another hearsay exception, like translation or agent's statement. If the friend was acting as the gardener's agent in the transaction, then the friend's statements might be admissible as statements by the gardener's agent. Or perhaps since the friend was translating, it's not hearsay because it's a translation of the homeowner's statement.

Wait, that's an important point. When the friend translates the homeowner's offer, the friend is essentially conveying the homeowner's words. So the friend's translation would be considered as the homeowner's statement, not the friend's. So when the gardener testifies about what the friend told him, it's actually the homeowner's offer. Statements made by a party (here, the homeowner) are not hearsay under the admission by a party-opponent exception (FRE 801(d)(2)). So if the friend was merely translating the homeowner's offer, then the gardener's testimony is relaying the homeowner's statement, which is admissible as a party admission.

Alternatively, if the friend was acting as an agent for the gardener, then his statements would be those of the agent concerning a matter within the scope of his agency, which could make them admissible under FRE 801(d)(2)(D). But I'm not sure if that's necessary here because the friend was translating the homeowner's offer, making it the homeowner's statement.

Another angle: the Dead Man's Statute usually applies when a witness is testifying about a conversation with a deceased person who was a party to the litigation. But in this case, the deceased is the friend, who's not a party. So the Dead Man's Statute might not prevent the testimony here. Therefore, the gardener can testify about the friend's translation because it's the homeowner's statement.

Looking at the options:

Option G says it's admissible as an admission by a party-opponent. That makes sense because the friend was translating the homeowner's offer, so the friend's statement is the homeowner's statement. So the gardener's testimony about what the friend told him (the homeowner's offer of $200) would be an admission by the homeowner, hence not hearsay.

Other options: Option A says it's inadmissible as hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute. But if it's an admission, it's not hearsay. So A would be incorrect.

Option D says it's non-hearsay to corroborate a verbal act. I'm not sure about that. Verbal acts can be relevant for other purposes, but this seems more like a party admission.

Option B talks about needing a translator, but that doesn't seem relevant to admissibility—just whether the translation was accurate, but that's a different issue.

Option H says it's inadmissible unless the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent. Wait, no—the friend was the gardener's translator, not the homeowner's agent. So the issue is whether the friend's statements are those of the homeowner. Since the friend was translating the homeowner's offer, it's the homeowner's statement, making it an admission.

So the correct answer should be G: admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.

The gardener seeks to testify about the terms of his agreement with the homeowner, which were communicated to him through a deceased friend who acted as a translator. The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible or barred by hearsay rules or the Dead Man's Statute.

The gardener's testimony about what the friend told him is, at first glance, hearsay because it relies on the friend's out-of-court statement. However, the friend was translating the homeowner's offer, making the friend's statement a conveyance of the homeowner's words. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), statements made by a party to the litigation (here, the homeowner) are not considered hearsay and are admissible as admissions by a party-opponent under FRE 801(d)(2)(A). 

The Dead Man's Statute does not apply here because it typically bars testimony about transactions or communications with a deceased person who was a party to the litigation. In this case, the deceased friend was not a party to the transaction but merely acted as a translator. Therefore, the gardener's testimony about the friend's translation of the homeowner's offer is admissible as an admission by the homeowner.

Option G correctly identifies that the testimony is admissible as an admission by a party-opponent, making it the correct answer.
