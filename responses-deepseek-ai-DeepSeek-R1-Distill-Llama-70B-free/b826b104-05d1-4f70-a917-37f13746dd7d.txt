Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Democratic Party's traditional groups and which has the least liberal constituency. Hmm. Let's see. The options are A through J, each representing a different group.

First, I need to understand what each group generally stands for and their typical political leanings. The question is about which group is the least liberal, meaning they might be more moderate or even conservative compared to the others.

Starting with option A: African Americans. I know they've been a strong Democratic base, especially since the Civil Rights era. They tend to support liberal policies, so probably not the least liberal.

Option B: Urban residents. Cities usually lean more liberal, so urban voters are likely quite liberal. Not the answer.

Option C: Labor union members. Unions have historically been aligned with Democrats, pushing for workers' rights and better wages. They're pretty liberal, so not the least.

Option D: Hispanic and Latino Americans. This group is significant and growing. They tend to support Democrats, especially on issues like immigration reform. They might lean liberal, but I'm not sure how they compare to others.

Option E: White Southerners. Wait, White Southerners... I recall that the South has traditionally been more conservative. In the past, Southern Democrats were more conservative, but over time, the South has trended Republican. However, the question is about groups that have traditionally supported the Democratic Party. So maybe among Democrats, White Southerners are less liberal.

Option F: Northern ethnic minorities. These groups, like immigrants from various backgrounds, have often been part of the Democratic coalition. They probably support more liberal policies, so not the least.

Option G: College students. College students are usually more liberal, especially on social issues. So they're likely very liberal.

Option H: LGBTQ+ community. This group is known for being progressive and supporting liberal policies, especially on social issues. So they're not the least.

Option I: Environmental activists. They are typically very liberal, pushing for strong environmental policies. Not the answer.

Option J: Women's rights advocates. They support liberal policies like reproductive rights and equal pay, so they're quite liberal.

So now, thinking about each group's stance. The question is which group within the Democratic Party's traditional supporters is the least liberal. White Southerners in the past were part of the Democratic Party, but they were more conservative. After the Civil Rights era, many switched to the Republican Party, but some may still remain as Democrats, especially in certain areas. These remaining White Southern Democrats are probably more moderate or conservative compared to other Democratic groups.

So the answer would be E: White Southerners.

The Democratic Party has traditionally drawn support from a variety of groups, each with differing levels of political liberalism. Among the options provided:

- **African Americans (A)**, **Urban residents (B)**, **Labor union members (C)**, **Hispanic and Latino Americans (D)**, **Northern ethnic minorities (F)**, **College students (G)**, **LGBTQ+ community (H)**, **Environmental activists (I)**, and **Women's rights advocates (J)** are all known for their strong alignment with liberal policies and ideologies.

- **White Southerners (E)**, however, stand out as the least liberal constituency within the Democratic Party's traditional base. Historically, Southern Democrats were more conservative, especially on issues like race and social policies. While many White Southerners shifted to the Republican Party over time, those who remain within the Democratic Party tend to be more moderate or conservative compared to the other groups listed.

Thus, the group with the least liberal constituency is **White Southerners**.

Answer: E
