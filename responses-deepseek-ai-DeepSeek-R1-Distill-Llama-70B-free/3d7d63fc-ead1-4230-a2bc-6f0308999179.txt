Question:

Co-defendants were dealers at a casino. They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.
B: Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he physically placed the bomb in the casino.
C: Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.
D: The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.
E: Both are guilty, but only the one who made the phone call is guilty of a felony.
F: Both are not guilty, because they intended to defuse the bomb before it exploded.
G: Both are guilty, but only the one who built the bomb is guilty of a felony.
H: Neither is guilty, because the faulty wire, an unforeseeable circumstance, caused the bomb to explode.
I: Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.
J: The co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty, because he made the demand for the money.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding co-defendants and a bombing at a casino. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: Two co-defendants were dealers at a casino. They got fired by the new manager, who was hired to replace old employees with cheaper new ones. Angry, they decided to plant a bomb and demand $1 million. They planned to give the casino enough warning so no one gets hurt. One built the bomb and placed it, the other called to make the demand. The casino didn't take it seriously, so the plan failed. On their way to defuse it, the bomb went off prematurely because of a faulty wire, killing 30 people.

The question is about whether they're guilty under a state statute that makes detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb a felony.

So, the statute says that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb is a felony. The key here is understanding the elements of the crime and how each co-defendant's actions relate to those elements.

Let's think about the elements. Typically, a crime requires both actus reus (the guilty act) and mens rea (the guilty mind). For this statute, the actus reus would be detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb. The mens rea might be intent to detonate, but I'm not sure if it's specific or just general intent.

Now, the co-defendants both planned the crime. One built the bomb and placed it, the other made the phone call. The one who placed the bomb actually did the physical act of placing it, which could be seen as an attempt to detonate. The other co-defendant made the demand, but how does that tie into the bomb detonation?

In criminal law, when two people agree to commit a crime, they can be guilty as co-conspirators or under accomplice liability. So, both could be guilty if they each played a role in the crime.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Both guilty because they planned it. Planning alone might not be enough without an overt act. But they both took steps beyond planning. The one built and placed the bomb, the other made the call. So A might be possible.

Option B: Only the bomb builder is guilty because he placed it. But the other helped plan and made the demand, which might be part of the crime.

Option C: Neither guilty because they didn't intend to kill. But the crime is about detonating a bomb, regardless of intent to kill. So their intent was to extort money, but the act of planting the bomb could still be the crime.

Option D: Builder guilty, caller not because the call wasn't a substantial step. But making a demand could be part of the attempt. The Model Penal Code says that a substantial step towards the crime can make someone guilty of attempt.

Option E: Both guilty, but only caller guilty of felony. Doesn't make sense because placing the bomb is the physical act.

Option F: Both not guilty because they intended to defuse. But they still planted the bomb with the intent to detonate it later as part of the extortion. So the intent to defuse after doesn't negate the initial intent to detonate unless paid.

Option G: Both guilty, but only builder guilty of felony. Maybe because the caller was part of the plan but the actual placing is the felony. Not sure.

Option H: Neither guilty because of faulty wire. But the premature explosion doesn't negate their initial criminal act of attempting to detonate.

Option I: Casino's negligence as intervening cause. But if the act was planting the bomb with intent, their own act is the cause, so this might not apply.

Option J: Only caller guilty because he made the demand. Doesn't seem right because the builder placed the bomb.

So, the statute is about detonating or attempting to detonate. The act of placing the bomb with the intent that it explode (even if they later intended to defuse it) could be an attempt. Both co-defendants were involved in the plan. So both could be guilty under the statute as co-conspirators or accomplices.

Wait, but the actual detonation was accidental because of the faulty wire. Did their actions constitute an attempt? Because they intended to detonate it later if the money wasn't paid. So placing the bomb was part of the attempt.

In criminal law, attempt requires intent to commit the crime and a substantial step towards it. Both defendants took substantial steps: one built and placed the bomb, the other made the demand as part of the plan to extort money which would lead to detonation if not paid.

Therefore, both are guilty because they each participated in the attempt to detonate the bomb. So the correct answer would be A: Both guilty because each participated.

Wait, but does the statute require actual detonation or just an attempt? The question says the statute makes it a felony to detonate or attempt to detonate. They attempted, so they're guilty. Both were part of the attempt. So A is correct.

But let me look at the options again. Option A says both guilty because each participated in planning. Planning isn't enough; they need to have taken action. But both did take actions: building, placing, and making the call. So their participation in the act, not just planning, makes them guilty.

So I think the answer is A. But wait, another possibility: under the felony murder rule? No, because the question is about the specific statute, not murder. So it's about the bombing statute.

Alternatively, could they be guilty as aiders and abettors? Yes, each contributed to the crime.

So, the correct answer should be A: Both are guilty because each participated in the planning of the crime. Wait, but the option says "participated in the planning," but they actually took overt acts beyond planning. However, the option's wording might not matter because both did participate in planning and acting.

Another thought: the co-defendant who made the phone call, did that action constitute an attempt? Or was it just part of the plan? The phone call was part of the attempt to extort, which was tied to the bomb's detonation. So both actions were in furtherance of the attempt to detonate the bomb as part of the plan.

Therefore, both are guilty under the statute. So the answer is A.

The question revolves around whether the co-defendants are guilty under a state statute that criminalizes detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb. The co-defendants planted a bomb in a casino as part of an extortion scheme, intending to defuse it later if their demand for $1,000,000 was not met. However, the bomb exploded prematurely due to a faulty wire, killing 30 people. The statute requires both the actus reus (guilty act) and mens rea (guilty mind) for the crime of detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Both co-defendants are guilty because they participated in the planning and execution of the crime. This is correct because both took substantial steps: one built and placed the bomb, and the other made the demand. Their actions constitute an attempt to detonate the bomb under the statute.
- **Option B**: Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty. This is incorrect because the other co-defendant's phone call was a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime, making him guilty as well.
- **Option C**: Neither is guilty because they did not intend for anyone to be killed. This is incorrect because the statute focuses on the act of detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb, not the intent to kill.
- **Option D**: The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, but the other is not. This is incorrect because the phone call was a substantial step in the crime.
- **Option E**: Both are guilty, but only the caller is guilty of a felony. This is incorrect because placing the bomb is the physical act that directly violates the statute.
- **Option F**: Both are not guilty because they intended to defuse the bomb. This is incorrect because their initial intent to detonate the bomb unless paid satisfies the mens rea requirement.
- **Option G**: Both are guilty, but only the bomb builder is guilty of a felony. This is incorrect because both co-defendants' actions contributed to the attempt to detonate the bomb.
- **Option H**: Neither is guilty due to the faulty wire. This is incorrect because the faulty wire does not negate their initial criminal act of attempting to detonate the bomb.
- **Option I**: Neither is guilty due to the casino's negligence. This is incorrect because the co-defendants' actions, not the casino's negligence, constitute the crime.
- **Option J**: Only the caller is guilty. This is incorrect because the bomb builder's actions were also essential to the crime.

The correct answer is **A**, as both co-defendants participated in the planning and execution of the crime, and their actions satisfy the requirements of the statute.

**Answer: A**
