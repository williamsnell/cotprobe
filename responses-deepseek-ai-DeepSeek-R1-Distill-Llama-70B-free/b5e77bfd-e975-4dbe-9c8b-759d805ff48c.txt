Okay, so I've got this economics question here about marginal revenue and marginal cost. Hmm, I remember from my notes that marginal revenue is the additional revenue a firm gets from selling one more unit of a product. Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit. 

The question is asking where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. I think this is related to profit maximization. Right, because firms aim to maximize their profits, and they do that by producing where the cost of producing an extra unit equals the revenue from selling it. So when MR = MC, the firm isn't losing money on the last unit it produces, and it's not leaving potential profit on the table.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Total product is at its highest point. Wait, total product refers to the total output produced. The highest point would be where production is maxed out, maybe at the end of the production possibilities. But that doesn't directly relate to MR and MC. I don't think this is the right choice.

Option B: Average product is at its highest point. Average product (output per unit of input) being max would be where marginal product equals average product. I remember that happens at the peak of the average product curve, but that's more about productivity efficiency, not revenue and cost. So probably not B.

Option C: Total revenue is at its maximum, irrespective of total cost. Hmm, if TR is max, but what about costs? Profit is TR minus TC. So just because TR is max doesn't mean profit is. I think MR=MC relates to maximizing profit, not just TR. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Total revenue is less than total cost. That would mean the firm is operating at a loss. But the MR=MC point is where profit is maximized, whether that's a profit or a loss. So this could be possible, but the question is about where MR=MC, not the profitability outcome. So maybe D isn't the point in question.

Option E: Marginal product is at its highest point. Marginal product is the additional output from an extra input. The highest marginal product would be when the first units are added, like when increasing labor in production. MR=MC is more about the equality in terms of cost and revenue per unit, not the productivity per se. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F: Average revenue equals average cost. Oh wait, average revenue is the same as average price if you're selling multiple units. When AR equals AC, that's the break-even point where total revenue equals total cost. But the question is about MR=MC, which is the profit-maximizing point. So F is about a different equality. So probably not F.

Option G: Fixed cost is at its lowest point. Fixed costs don't change with output, like rent. I don't think this relates to MR and MC, which are about the margin. So G is not it.

Option H: Total revenue is equal to total cost. That's the break-even point again, as in option F. So H and F are similar. But the question is about where MR=MC, which is about the last unit adding as much revenue as cost. So H isn't the answer.

Option I: Total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance. Hmm, that sounds like maximum profit. Because when TR is greater than TC, and the difference is the largest. But how does that relate to MR=MC? Oh right, because when MR=MC, it's the point where the profit is maximized. So if TR is greater than TC, and it's the maximum point, then I could be correct. But wait, let me think again. The question is phrased as "the point where MR equals MC." So that point is where profit is maximized, which could be when TR is greater than TC, but I think this option is a bit confusingly worded. Or maybe it's not directly the point but a condition around it.

Option J: Variable cost is at its lowest point. Variable costs change with output, like labor costs. The lowest point would be at zero production maybe? That doesn't make sense with MR=MC. So J is probably not correct.

Wait, going back. The question is about where MR equals MC. So the correct point is where the firm maximizes profit, which is where MR=MC. This doesn't necessarily mean TR is at its max (since costs might eat into it). So which option aligns with that.

Looking again at the options, option F says average revenue equals average cost. That's the break-even point. But MR=MC is about maximizing profit, not breaking even. So the correct answer is F? No, because F is about average revenue and average cost being equal, not about marginal.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the profit maximization condition. Profit is maximized when MR=MC. At this point, the firm may be making a profit or a loss, depending on where the ATC curve is. But the question is about the point where MR=MC occurs.

Wait, another way: the MR=MC point is where the firm's additional revenue equals additional cost, which is the optimal production level. So looking at the options, which one describes this condition.

Option I says total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance. So this would be maximum profit, yes. Because when TR is as much higher than TC as possible, that's maximum profit. So perhaps I is correct. But wait, the question is about the condition when MR=MC. That condition leads to maximum profit, but the question is phrased as where does MR=MC occur. So perhaps the correct answer is when the firm is maximizing profit, which would be option I.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options directly state that, but looking again.

Option C says total revenue is at maximum, irrespective of cost. That's not correct because TR can be maximum beyond the profit maximizing point. Because TR might keep increasing, but if MC is higher, it's not profitable to produce beyond MR=MC.

So, the correct point is where MR=MC, which is the profit-maximizing point. So, which option corresponds to that.

Looking again, option I says "total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance." That sounds like maximum profit. So I think I is correct.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: in a perfectly competitive market, MR equals price, which is also average revenue. So when MR=MC, the firm is producing where price equals MC, which is the allocatively efficient level. But that's a different point.

Wait, the options don't mention perfect competition, so perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, in the context of a monopoly, the profit-maximizing output is where MR=MC, regardless of whether that gives positive profit or loss.

So, when MR=MC, the firm is producing the quantity that maximizes profit. So, if the question is about where MR=MC, the correct point is the profit-maximizing level, which would be when TR is greater than TC by the greatest amount (maximum profit).

So looking back, the options are:

I: total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance.

So I think option I is correct. So the answer is I.

Marginal revenue (MR) is the additional revenue a firm earns from selling one more unit of a product, while marginal cost (MC) is the additional cost of producing one more unit. Firms aim to maximize profits by producing where MR equals MC. This is the profit-maximizing point, as it ensures that the revenue from the last unit produced equals the cost of producing it, maximizing the difference between total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC).

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Total product being at its highest point refers to maximum output, which is unrelated to MR and MC equality. Incorrect.
- **B**: Average product being at its highest point relates to productivity efficiency, not revenue and cost. Incorrect.
- **C**: Total revenue being at its maximum irrespective of total cost is incorrect because profit maximization depends on both TR and TC. Incorrect.
- **D**: Total revenue being less than total cost describes a loss, but MR=MC can occur at a profit or loss. The question is about the condition itself, not profitability. Incorrect.
- **E**: Marginal product being at its highest point refers to productivity, not revenue and cost. Incorrect.
- **F**: Average revenue equals average cost at the break-even point, not necessarily where MR=MC. Incorrect.
- **G**: Fixed cost being at its lowest point is irrelevant to MR and MC. Incorrect.
- **H**: Total revenue equaling total cost is the break-even point, not the profit-maximizing point. Incorrect.
- **I**: Total revenue being greater than total cost at its greatest distance describes maximum profit, which aligns with the MR=MC condition. Correct.
- **J**: Variable cost being at its lowest point is unrelated to MR and MC equality. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **I**, as it aligns with the profit-maximizing condition where MR=MC.
