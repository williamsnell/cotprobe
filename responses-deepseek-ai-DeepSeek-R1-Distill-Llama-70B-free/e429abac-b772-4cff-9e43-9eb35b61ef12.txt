Okay, so I've got this question about memory systems, specifically a purely segmented memory system. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has three statements, I, II, and III. I need to figure out which of these are true for a purely segmented system. The options are combinations of these statements.

First, what's a segmented memory system? From what I remember, segmentation is a memory management technique where the memory is divided into segments. These segments are based on logical divisions, like functions, modules, or objects in a program. Each segment can have different access rights, which helps in memory protection.

Statement I says it divides memory into units of equal size. Wait, no, I think segmentation doesn't use equal-sized units. Segmented systems use variable-sized segments based on the logical needs of the program. Paging, on the other hand, uses fixed-size pages. So Statement I would be false because segmentation doesn't split into equal units. So any option including I as true (like option A or D) is probably incorrect.

Statement II claims it permits virtual memory implementation. I'm a bit confused here. Virtual memory is often implemented using paging, but can segmentation be part of it? I think some systems combine paging and segmentation. For example, Intel's x86 architecture uses a combination where the memory is segmented and then each segment is paged. But wait, the question is about a purely segmented system. If it's purely segmented without paging, does it support virtual memory? Virtual memory typically involves paging because it allows for swapping parts of memory to disk. If segmentation is used alone, maybe it doesn't support virtual memory. Or perhaps in some systems, segmentation alone can provide some form of virtual memory by allowing programs to reference segments beyond physical memory, using swapping. I'm not too sure about this. I'll need to think more.

Statement III says it suffers from internal fragmentation. Internal fragmentation happens when the allocated memory is larger than what's needed, leaving unused space. Segmentation divides memory into variable-sized segments, so each segment is exactly the size needed. That would mean no internal fragmentation, right? Wait, no. Wait, in some cases, if the segment sizes are not exact, maybe there's some waste. Or perhaps because segments aren't necessarily contiguous, it can lead to holes, but that's more external fragmentation. Oh wait, internal fragmentation is when a block is larger than needed, so the extra space is unused. Segments are allocated as needed, so maybe there's no internal fragmentation. So Statement III would be false. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify.

Wait, segmentation doesn't use fixed-size blocks, so each segment is exactly the size required. So no, internal fragmentation wouldn't occur because there's no extra space allocated beyond what's needed. So Statement III is false.

Wait, but maybe in some implementations, if the segments are allocated in fixed sizes, but that's paging. No, in pure segmentation, the sizes are variable. So Statement III is false.

So putting this together:

Statement I: False (segmentation uses variable size)
Statement II: Not sure, but maybe True if it can support virtual memory
Statement III: False (no internal fragmentation)

Wait, but let's go back to Statement II. Virtual memory allows programs to use more memory than physically available by using disk space. Paging is a common way to do this, but can segmentation alone support virtual memory? Hmm. I think that in a purely segmented system without paging, each segment's size is fixed, but it's possible that the system can't efficiently manage virtual memory because it's hard to swap variable-sized segments in and out. Paging breaks memory into small, equal parts, making it easier to manage and swap. So perhaps a purely segmented system doesn't permit virtual memory, making Statement II false.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another approach: in the pure segmented model, each process is divided into segments that can be stored non-contiguously in memory. To implement virtual memory, you need a way to extend the physical memory, which usually involves paging. So maybe a purely segmented system doesn't support virtual memory, making Statement II false.

Alternatively, maybe a purely segmented system can implement virtual memory through segmentation, but I'm not sure. If a system allows segments to be swapped in and out of physical memory, perhaps that's a form of virtual memory. So maybe Statement II is true.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each statement again.

I. It divides memory into units of equal size. -> No, segmentation uses variable sizes, so I is false.

II. It permits implementation of virtual memory. -> Maybe. If the system can map segments to disk and swap them in as needed, then yes. But I'm not certain if that's considered a virtual memory system. I think virtual memory is more commonly associated with paging, but segmentation can be part of it. Without paging, perhaps it's not efficient, but theoretically possible. So II could be true.

III. It suffers from internal fragmentation. -> No, because each segment is the exact size needed, so no internal fragmentation. So III is false.

So, the only statement that could be true is II.

Looking at the options, option B is II only. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If the system is purely segmented, without paging, can it implement virtual memory? I'm trying to recall.

In the pure segmentation model, each segment is loaded into physical memory as a whole. If the physical memory is full, the OS might need to replace a segment. But without fixed-size pages, this might be less efficient. However, the ability to have segments not in physical memory (on disk) and loaded on demand would constitute virtual memory. So yes, Statement II is correct.

So the only correct statement is II. So the answer is option B.

In a purely segmented memory system, memory is divided into variable-sized segments based on logical divisions of a program, such as functions or modules. This approach does not use fixed-size units, so Statement I ("It divides memory into units of equal size") is false. Additionally, since segments are allocated exactly as needed, there is no internal fragmentation, making Statement III ("It suffers from internal fragmentation") also false.

Regarding Statement II ("It permits implementation of virtual memory"), virtual memory allows programs to use more memory than is physically available by swapping memory contents to and from disk. While paging is the most common method for implementing virtual memory due to its fixed-size blocks, a purely segmented system can theoretically support virtual memory by swapping entire segments in and out of physical memory. Thus, Statement II is true.

Therefore, the only correct statement is II, and the correct answer is:

B: II only

Answer: B
