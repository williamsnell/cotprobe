Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the volume of a solid. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right. 

The base of the solid is a circular disk with radius 3. So, the base is a circle, radius 3 units. Now, the solid is such that when you take cross-sections perpendicular to the base, and these cross-sections are parallel, each one is an isosceles right triangle. And importantly, the hypotenuse of each triangle lies along the base. Hmm, wait, so each cross-section is a right triangle, and the hypotenuse is on the base of the solid.

I think I need to visualize this. The base is a circle, so any cross-section perpendicular to the base would be a line segment. But wait, no, the cross-sections are triangles. Oh, right, because the cross-section is taken perpendicular to the base and, since the base is a circle, each cross-section is a triangle whose base lies along a chord of the circle, I suppose.

Wait, no, the hypotenuse lies along the base. Oh, so the hypotenuse of each triangle is a chord of the circular base. Because the cross-section is perpendicular to the base, which is a circle. So for each point along the base, or maybe along some axis, we're taking a slice perpendicular to the base, and each slice is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse on the base.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this. Let's think in terms of integrating the area of these cross-sections along the base. Because the volume would be the integral from one end to the other of the area of each cross-section.

So, first, let's model the base. The base is a circle with radius 3. Let's imagine it centered at the origin (0,0) on the xy-plane. The equation of the circle would be x² + y² = 3² = 9.

Now, cross-sections are taken perpendicular to the base. Since the base is in the xy-plane, a cross-section perpendicular to it would be along the z-axis. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the base is in, say, the xy-plane, and the cross-sections are slices along the z-axis. Or perhaps the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, meaning they are vertical slices. Maybe it's easier to think of the base as lying along the x-axis, but perhaps it's better to align it with the x-axis for simplicity.

Wait, perhaps I should model the base as a line segment along the x-axis, with the solid extending in the y-direction. No, wait, because the base is a circle, which is a 2D shape. So perhaps the cross-sections are taken along the y-axis, with the base being the circle in, say, the x-y plane, and the cross-sections being perpendicular to the x-axis.

Wait, maybe I should think of slices perpendicular to the diameter of the circle. Let's say the base is a circle in the x-y plane, and we're taking slices along the x-axis. So each slice at position x would have a certain height in the y-direction. But in this problem, each cross-section is an isosceles right triangle, with the hypotenuse lying along the base.

Wait, perhaps each cross-section is a triangle whose base is a chord of the circle, and the height is perpendicular to that chord. Since the cross-section is perpendicular to the base, which is the x-y plane, the cross-section's plane would be vertical, say along the x-z plane.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let's imagine the base is a circle of radius 3, and we're taking slices perpendicular to this base. Each slice is an isosceles right triangle, and the hypotenuse of each triangle lies along the base. So, for each position along the base, the cross-section is a right triangle whose hypotenuse is a chord of the circle.

But wait, the cross-sections are triangles, so each cross-section must be a line segment in some direction. Hmm, perhaps the cross-sections are perpendicular to a diameter of the base. So, for example, if the base is a circle, and we take cross-sections along the y-axis, each at a position x, the cross-section is a triangle whose base is the line from (x, y1) to (x, y2) on the base, and the height is in the z-direction.

Wait, perhaps I should model the base as the x-axis, from x = -3 to x = 3, since the radius is 3. Then, for each x, the cross-section is a triangle whose base is a segment on the x-axis (the base of the solid). But no, because the base is a disk, which includes all points within the circle, not just along a line.

Wait, perhaps the cross-sections are taken perpendicular to a diameter. Let me think: the base is a circle, and the solid is generated by moving an isosceles right triangle along the circle, with the hypotenuse always lying on the circumference.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think of it as the solid being formed by sweeping a line segment along the circle, but the cross-sections are triangles. Alternatively, perhaps each cross-section is a triangle whose base is a chord of the circle, and the height is determined by the right triangle's legs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parametrize the problem. Let's consider the base circle in the x-y plane, with equation x² + y² = 9. The cross-sections are taken perpendicular to the x-axis, so for each x, the cross-section is in the y-z plane. Each cross-section is an isosceles right triangle, with hypotenuse lying along the base (the x-y plane). So, the hypotenuse would be along the line where z=0, which is the base.

Wait, no, because the cross-section is perpendicular to the base, so the cross-section's plane would be vertical, say the x-z plane, and the base is in the x-y plane. So, the hypotenuse of each triangle lies along the x-y plane. So, for each x, the cross-section at position x is an isosceles right triangle in the y-z plane, with its hypotenuse lying along the x-y plane (so along the line where z=0).

Wait, but the cross-section is perpendicular to the base, so maybe it's better to think that for each point along the diameter of the base, the cross-section is a triangle. Let me perhaps model it by taking the base as a line segment (diameter) along the x-axis, from x = -3 to x = 3. Then, for each x, the cross-section is a triangle in the y-z plane, with its base (hypotenuse) lying along the x-axis.

Wait, but in that case, the base of the triangle (the hypotenuse) would be a line segment on the x-axis. But the cross-section is perpendicular to the base, so perhaps the base of the triangle is a line segment along the x-axis, and the triangle extends upward in the y or z direction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Since each cross-section is an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are equal in length. The hypotenuse is lying along the base, which is a circle. So, for each cross-section, the hypotenuse is a chord of the circle. The length of the hypotenuse would vary depending on where we are along the circle.

Wait, but if the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, then each cross-section is a slice through the solid, and the hypotenuse of the triangle lies along the circular base. So, each cross-section's triangle has its hypotenuse as a chord of the circle, and the height of the triangle (the other dimension) is perpendicular to the base.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as follows: for each point along the diameter of the base circle, the cross-sectional area is an isosceles right triangle whose hypotenuse is equal to the length of the chord at that point.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solid is generated by moving an isosceles right triangle along the circular base such that the hypotenuse is always a chord of the circle. The area of each cross-section would depend on the position along the diameter.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to model this using integration. Let's consider the base as a circle of radius 3, centered at the origin. Let's take cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis, so each cross-section is at a particular x value. The cross-section at position x will be a triangle whose hypotenuse is a horizontal line segment (along the x-axis) at that x, and the triangle extends upward in the y-direction.

Wait, but the cross-section is perpendicular to the base, which is in the x-y plane, so perhaps the cross-section is in the x-z plane. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think differently. The base is a circle of radius 3. Let's imagine the solid as being built up by moving a line segment along the circle, but each position has a triangle attached to it. Wait, no, the cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, so perhaps each cross-section is a triangle whose base is a chord of the circle, and the height is perpendicular to that chord.

Wait, perhaps the solid is such that for each point along the diameter (let's say the x-axis from -3 to 3), the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle, with the hypotenuse being the chord at that x. So, for each x, the length of the chord is 2*sqrt(9 - x²), because the circle equation is x² + y² = 9, so at a given x, y ranges from -sqrt(9 - x²) to +sqrt(9 - x²), so the length is 2*sqrt(9 - x²).

Wait, but that's the length of the chord perpendicular to the x-axis at position x. So, if the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse equal to the chord length, then the legs of the triangle would be equal. Let me denote the legs as 'a', so the hypotenuse would be a*sqrt(2). So, a*sqrt(2) = 2*sqrt(9 - x²), which implies a = (2*sqrt(9 - x²))/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(9 - x²).

Then, the area of each cross-section (the triangle) would be (a^2)/2, since area of a right triangle is (base*height)/2, and both legs are equal to 'a'. So, area A(x) = (a^2)/2 = [ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(9 - x²))^2 ] / 2 = [ 2*(9 - x²) ] / 2 = (9 - x²).

Wait, that's interesting. So, the area of each cross-section at position x is (9 - x²). Now, to find the volume, we can integrate A(x) from x = -3 to x = 3. Because the solid extends along the x-axis from -3 to 3, and each slice at x has area (9 - x²). So, the volume V is the integral from -3 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx.

But wait a second, let me check that again. Because the cross-section is an isosceles right triangle, and the hypotenuse is the chord length, which is 2*sqrt(9 - x²). So, the legs are each a = (2*sqrt(9 - x²)) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(9 - x²). So, the area would be (a^2)/2 = [ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(9 -x²))^2 ] / 2 = [ 2*(9 -x²) ] / 2 = 9 - x². Yes, that's correct.

So, V = ∫ from x = -3 to x = 3 of (9 - x²) dx.

Since the function (9 - x²) is even, we can compute the integral from 0 to 3 and double it. So,

V = 2 * ∫ from 0 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx.

Let's compute the integral:

∫ (9 - x²) dx = 9x - (x^3)/3 + C.

Evaluated from 0 to 3:

At x=3: 9*(3) - (3^3)/3 = 27 - 27/3 = 27 - 9 = 18.

At x=0: 0 - 0 = 0.

So, the integral from 0 to 3 is 18. Then, V = 2 * 18 = 36.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because the area of each cross-section is (9 - x²), and integrating from -3 to 3 would give:

∫ from -3 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx = [9x - x^3/3] from -3 to 3.

At x=3: 9*3 - (3)^3/3 = 27 - 9 = 18.

At x=-3: 9*(-3) - (-3)^3/3 = -27 - (-9) = -27 +9 = -18.

So, subtracting: 18 - (-18) = 36. So the volume is 36.

Looking back at the options, option B is 36. So, the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in reasoning. The cross-sections are perpendicular to the base, so the slices are along the x-axis, and each is a triangle with area 9 - x². The integral of that from -3 to 3 gives 36. That seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the solid as a kind of bicone or something, but the calculation seems straightforward. So, I think I'll go with option B: 36.

The base of the solid is a circular disk with radius 3, and the cross-sections perpendicular to the base are isosceles right triangles with their hypotenuses lying along the base. To find the volume of the solid, we model the base as a circle in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane with the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 9\). Cross-sections are taken perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis, and each cross-section is an isosceles right triangle.

The hypotenuse of each triangle corresponds to the length of a chord of the circle at position \(x\), which is given by \(2\sqrt{9 - x^2}\). For an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is \(a\sqrt{2}\), where \(a\) is the length of each leg. Thus, \(a = \frac{2\sqrt{9 - x^2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}\sqrt{9 - x^2}\). The area of each cross-sectional triangle is:

\[
A(x) = \frac{1}{2}a^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sqrt{2}\sqrt{9 - x^2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(2(9 - x^2)\right) = 9 - x^2.
\]

To find the volume, we integrate the cross-sectional area \(A(x)\) along the \(x\)-axis from \(-3\) to \(3\):

\[
V = \int_{-3}^{3} (9 - x^2) \, dx.
\]

Since \(9 - x^2\) is an even function, we can simplify the calculation by integrating from \(0\) to \(3\) and doubling the result:

\[
V = 2 \int_{0}^{3} (9 - x^2) \, dx.
\]

The integral of \(9 - x^2\) is:

\[
\int (9 - x^2) \, dx = 9x - \frac{x^3}{3}.
\]

Evaluating this from \(0\) to \(3\):

\[
\left[9x - \frac{x^3}{3}\right]_{0}^{3} = \left(9(3) - \frac{3^3}{3}\right) - \left(9(0) - \frac{0^3}{3}\right) = (27 - 9) - 0 = 18.
\]

Thus, the volume is:

\[
V = 2 \times 18 = 36.
\]

Therefore, the volume of the solid is **36**, and the correct answer is:

**B: 36**
