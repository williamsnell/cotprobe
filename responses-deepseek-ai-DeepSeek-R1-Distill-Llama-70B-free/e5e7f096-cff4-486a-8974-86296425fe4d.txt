Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... The question is about blood types. Two people are having a child: one has type B blood, and the other has type AB. I need to find the probability that their child has type O blood. Hmm, interesting.

Wait, I remember that blood types are determined by the ABO system, right? So each person has two alleles, one from each parent. The alleles can be A, B, or O. And the O allele is recessive, while A and B are dominant. So the blood type is determined by which alleles you have.

Type B blood means that the person has at least one B allele. Since B is dominant, the possible genotypes are BB or BO. Similarly, type AB has both A and B alleles, so their genotype must be AB. Because AB is dominant over both A and B, right? So the AB person can only contribute either A or B alleles to their offspring.

So the parents are type B and type AB. Let me think about their possible genotypes. The type B parent could be BB or BO. Oh wait, but wait—AB can only contribute A or B. So let me consider each parent's possible alleles.

Wait, the type AB parent is AB, so their genotype is AB. So they can pass on either A or B. The type B parent is either BB or BO. Let me clarify: for the child to have type O blood, they must have two O alleles, right? Because O is recessive. So the child needs to get an O from each parent.

But wait, the AB parent can't contribute an O allele because their genotype is AB (they don't have an O allele). So the AB parent can only give A or B. The type B parent could be BB or BO. If the B parent is BB, they can only give B. If they're BO, they could give B or O.

So let's break it down. The AB parent can contribute either A or B. The B parent's contribution depends on their genotype.

Case 1: B parent is BB.
Then, the B parent can only give B. The AB parent gives A or B. So the possible combinations for the child would be:
- From AB: A; from BB: B → AB blood type (since A and B present).
- From AB: B; from BB: B → BB, which is type B.

So in this case, the child can't have type O. Because the AB parent can't give O, and the BB parent can't give O either.

Case 2: B parent is BO.
Then, the BO parent can give B or O (each with 50% chance). The AB parent gives A or B (each 50% chance as well).

So let's make a Punnett square maybe. The AB parent's alleles are A and B. The BO parent's alleles are B and O.

So the possible combinations are:

AB parent: A or B (each 50%).
BO parent: B or O (each 50%).

So the possible gamete combinations are:
A from AB and B from BO → AB (blood type AB).
A from AB and O from BO → AO (blood type A, since A is dominant).
B from AB and B from BO → BB (blood type B).
B from AB and O from BO → BO (blood type B).

So the possible blood types for the child are AB, A, B, or B. So in this case, the only possibilities are A, B, AB. There's no way for the child to have O blood type because the AB parent can't contribute an O.

Wait, but wait. No, in case the B parent is BO, the child could only get O from the B parent. But the AB parent can't give O. So even if the B parent gives O, the AB parent gives A or B. So the child would have AO or BO, which are types A or B. So type O would require OO genotype, which is impossible here because the AB parent can't contribute O.

So in both cases, whether the B parent is BB or BO, the child cannot have type O blood. Because the AB parent doesn't have an O allele to pass on, and the B parent can only pass O if they're BO, but even then, the other allele would be A or B, making the blood type A or B.

So the probability of the child having type O blood is zero.

The question involves determining the probability that a child with one parent having type B blood and the other having type AB blood will have type O blood. Blood type is determined by the ABO system, where the alleles A and B are dominant, and O is recessive. A person with type B blood can have the genotype BB or BO, while a person with type AB blood has the genotype AB.

For a child to have type O blood, they must inherit two recessive O alleles (one from each parent). However, the parent with type AB blood (genotype AB) cannot contribute an O allele, as they only have A and B alleles to pass on. Therefore, the child cannot inherit an O allele from the AB parent, making it impossible for the child to have type O blood.

Even if the type B parent has the genotype BO, they can only contribute either a B or an O allele. However, since the AB parent cannot contribute an O allele, the child would inherit either A or B from the AB parent, resulting in a blood type of A, B, or AB. Thus, the probability of the child having type O blood is zero.

The correct answer is:

C: 0%
