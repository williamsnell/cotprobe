Okay, so I have this problem about bond yields, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is asking for the effective yield of a 6 and a half percent bond with a face value of $1,000, purchased at 8 and a quarter. Hmm, I think I remember that effective yield has to do with the return an investor gets on a bond, considering its purchase price and the interest it pays.

Wait, I think the effective yield is calculated using the coupon payment and the purchase price. So the formula might be something like (coupon payment divided by purchase price) multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. But wait, coupon payment is usually annual, right? So I need to make sure I'm using the annual coupon.

The bond's face value is $1,000, and the coupon rate is 6.5%, so the annual coupon payment should be 6.5% of 1,000. Let me calculate that. 6.5% of 1,000 is 65 dollars. So the bond pays $65 each year.

But wait, the bond was purchased at a price. The question says it was purchased at 8 and a quarter. Oh, I think that's 8.25, but wait, in bond terms, prices are often quoted as a percentage of face value. So 8.25 would mean 82.5% of the face value? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, no, bonds are usually priced at 100 being face value. So if it's purchased at 8 and a quarter, that might actually be 80.25 dollars? Or wait, perhaps 8.25 as in 8.25% of face value? Wait, that can't be right because 8.25% of 1,000 is 82.5, but that would be an unusually low price. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps the purchase price is 8 and a quarter percent of the face value. So 8.25% of 1,000 is 82.5 dollars. So the investor paid $82.5 for a bond that's going to pay $65 a year in interest and then return the face value in the future.

Wait, but the effective yield formula I'm thinking of is for a bond purchased at a discount, so the yield would be higher than the coupon rate. Alternatively, if the bond is selling at a premium, the yield would be lower. Wait, no, no, in this case, the bond was purchased at 8.25, which is below the face value of 100. So it's a discount bond. So the effective yield should be higher than the coupon rate of 6.5%.

Wait, but the formula for effective yield is a bit more complicated than that. I think it's the coupon payment divided by the purchase price, but I might be mixing it up with current yield. Oh wait, current yield is exactly that: (annual coupon / purchase price). So current yield would be 65 / 82.5 = let me calculate that.

65 divided by 82.5. Let me compute that. 82.5 times 0.8 is 66, so 0.8 would give 66, which is a bit more than 65, so 65/82.5 is approximately 0.787 or 78.7%. Wait, that's way higher than the options given. The options are around 6-8%, so I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the purchase price. Oh wait, perhaps 8 and a quarter refers to 8.25 times the face value? Or maybe the price is 80.25 dollars. Hmm, 8.25 as a percentage would be 8.25% of 100, which is 8.25, but that can't be right because the price is way too low. Alternatively, maybe it's 8 and a quarter percent, which would be 8.25% of face value. So 8.25% of 1000 is 82.5. So purchase price is $82.5.

Wait, but that would make the current yield 65 / 82.5 = 0.787, which is 78.7%, which is way higher than any of the options. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the purchase price. Alternatively, perhaps 8 and a quarter is 80.25 dollars, which would make more sense because 80.25 is 80.25% of face value. So purchase price is 80.25.

Wait, then the current yield would be 65 / 80.25. Let me compute that. 65 divided by 80.25 equals approximately 0.8095, so 8.095%. But that's still higher than the options given, which are all below 8.25% and some are around 6-7%.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Maybe the bond is selling at a premium. No, the purchase price is 8 and a quarter, which is less than 100, so it's a discount. So the yield should be higher than the coupon rate.

Wait, but the effective yield isn't the same as the current yield. Oh right, effective yield is the yield to maturity, considering the time value of money and the capital gain or loss.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the yield to maturity formula. The formula for yield to maturity (YTM) is more complicated because it considers the time value of money for each coupon payment. But if the bond is sold at a discount, the YTM is higher than the coupon rate.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the effective yield, which I think is the same as the current yield, but perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's the same as the yield to maturity. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective yield is calculated as (coupon + (face - purchase price)/time) divided by average price. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me look up the formula for effective yield. Oh wait, I can't look things up right now. I'll have to think.

The effective yield is the yield that would make the present value of all cash flows equal to the purchase price. So it's the internal rate of return on the bond investment.

So the bond has a face value of $1,000, purchase price of $825 (if 8.25 is 82.5% of 1000, which is 825). Wait, no, 8.25% of 1000 is 82.5, but perhaps the price is 8 and a quarter, meaning 8.25% above face value? No, that wouldn't make sense because then the price would be 1082.5, which would be a premium bond, and the yield would be lower than 6.5%.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

If the bond is purchased at 8¼, that is 8.25, which in bond terms is sometimes a price of 82.5, meaning 82.5% of the face value. So for a $1,000 bond, that would be $825.

So the purchase price is $825. The bond pays $65 each year in interest (since 6.5% of 1000 is 65). And it will mature in some years, returning the face value.

Wait, but how many years is the bond? The question doesn't specify the time to maturity. Oh wait, maybe it's a perpetual bond? No, that's unlikely. Or perhaps the time to maturity isn't necessary for the effective yield calculation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the formula is (C + (F - P)/n) / ((F + P)/2), where C is coupon, F is face value, P is purchase price, and n is years to maturity. But without knowing n, I can't compute this. So perhaps the question is considering the bond as a perpetuity, where the yield is just the coupon divided by price.

Wait, but in that case, the yield would be 65 / 825 = let's calculate that. 65 divided by 825. Let me compute: 825 * 0.08 = 66. So 0.08 is 66, so 65 is 0.078 approx. So 7.8%.

Wait, 65 ÷ 825 = 0.07878, which is 7.878%. Rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent is 7.9%. But looking at the options, option C is 7.8%, E is 7.5%, and so on.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the purchase price. Let me double-check. If the bond is purchased at 8¼, which is 8.25 in decimal, but in bond terms, that's 8.25 as a percentage of face value, so 8.25% of 1000 is 82.5 dollars. So the purchase price is $82.5, not $825.

Wait, that would make more sense because 6.5% coupon on a $1,000 bond is $65 annually. If the purchase price is $82.5, then the current yield is 65 / 82.5 = 0.787 or 78.7%, which is way higher than any options given. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the price.

Wait, maybe 8¼ is 8.25, but in bond terms, it's 8 and a quarter dollars per 100 of face value. So for a $1,000 bond, it would be 8.25 * 10 = $82.5. So that's the same as before.

But then the current yield is 78.7%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the question is using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the formula.

Wait, perhaps the effective yield is calculated as (C / P) * 100, but that's current yield. Alternatively, maybe it's considering the yield to maturity, which would require knowing the time to maturity. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is treating the bond as if it's sold at a discount and the yield is based on the average of the cost and face value. Like, the effective rate is (C + (F - P)/n) / ((F + P)/2). But without knowing n, I can't compute this.

Wait, maybe the question is assuming that the bond is held to maturity and that the time to maturity is 1 year? That seems unlikely because bonds typically have longer maturities.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective yield is just the coupon rate adjusted for the purchase price. So, (65 / 82.5) * 100 = 78.7%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the purchase price. Maybe 8¼ is 80.25, which would be 80.25% of face value. So 80.25% of $1,000 is $802.5. So the purchase price is $802.5.

Then, the current yield would be 65 / 802.5 = let's compute that. 802.5 * 0.08 = 64.2, which is close to 65, so 0.08 is 64.2, so 65 is 0.08 plus (0.8 / 802.5) = approximately 0.08 + 0.0009975 = 0.0809975, so about 8.1%. That's still higher than the options given.

Wait, perhaps the price is 8.25 times the face value, meaning $8,250 for a $1,000 bond. No, that would make it a premium bond, and the yield would be lower than 6.5%, but the options have higher yields.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about the formula for effective yield.

The effective yield is the internal rate of return (IRR) of the bond. For a bond with annual coupons, the formula is:

Price = (C / (1 + r)) + (C / (1 + r)^2) + ... + (C + F) / (1 + r)^n

Where C is the annual coupon payment, F is the face value, r is the effective yield, and n is the number of years to maturity.

But without knowing n, I can't compute this. So perhaps the question assumes a particular maturity, like one year, but that would make the yield equal to (C + (F - P)) / P, which would be (65 + (1000 - 82.5)) / 82.5. That's (65 + 917.5) / 82.5 = 982.5 / 82.5 = approximately 11.9%, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond is a zero-coupon bond, but no, it's a 6.5% coupon bond.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the simple yield, which is (C + (F - P)/n) / P. But without n, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the effective yield here is the same as the current yield, which is C / P. So with a purchase price of 82.5, C is 65, so 65 / 82.5 = 0.787 or 78.7%, but that's not an option. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in error, or I'm misunderstanding the purchase price. Wait, another thought: perhaps 8¼ is in decimal form, meaning 8.25 dollars per $100 face value, which would make the purchase price for $1,000 face value as 8.25 * 10 = $82.5. So that's the same as before.

But again, that leads to a yield of 78.7%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the purchase price. Maybe 8¼ is 8.25% of the face value, which is 82.5, but that's what I've been using.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the yield to maturity formula, but without knowing the time, I can't compute it. Alternatively, maybe the question is using the formula for effective annual yield, which is (1 + r)^n - 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the effective yield is calculated as (C / (P)) * 100, so 65 / 825 = 0.07878, which is 7.88%, approximately 7.9%, but the closest option is 7.8% in option C, or 7.9% isn't an option. Wait, looking at the options:

A:7.2%, B:7.4%, C:7.8%, D:6.9%, E:7.5%, F:6.8%, G:6.5%, H:7.0%, I:8.25%, J:8.0%.

So 7.8% is option C, 7.5% is E. So if my calculation gives 7.88%, that rounds to 7.9%, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is 7.8%, option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the purchase price is 80.25 dollars, which is 80.25% of 1000, which is 802.5. Then, 65 / 802.5 = 0.08099, which is 8.1%, which is option I (8.25%) or J (8.0%).

Wait, but 8.1% isn't an option either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the effective yield as the coupon rate adjusted for the price. So maybe it's (6.5% * (1000 / 825)).

Wait, 1000 / 825 is approximately 1.2121. So 6.5% * 1.2121 is about 7.88%, which again would be 7.9%, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the bond's price and yield relationship. The price is 8.25, which is 82.5 dollars. The coupon is 65 annually. So the yield to maturity would be the rate that discounts the coupons and face value to the purchase price.

The formula is:

82.5 = 65/(1 + r) + 65/(1 + r)^2 + ... + (65 + 1000)/(1 + r)^n

But without knowing n, I can't compute this. So perhaps the question assumes the bond has a certain maturity, maybe 5 years or something, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the effective annual yield as the same as the current yield, which would be 65 / 82.5 = 78.7%, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate 65 divided by 82.5.

65 ÷ 82.5 = Let's compute this.

82.5 × 0.7 = 57.75, 82.5 × 0.8 = 66. So 0.78 would be 82.5 × 0.78 = let's compute 0.7 *82.5=57.75, 0.08*82.5=6.6, so 57.75 +6.6=64.35. So 0.78 gives 64.35, which is just under 65. So 65 /82.5 is approximately 0.787, so 78.7%.

But again, that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the purchase price is 80.25 instead of 82.5. So 80.25 is 80.25% of 1000, which is 802.5.

Then, 65 / 802.5 = 0.08099, which is 8.099%, approximately 8.1%, which is near option I (8.25%) and J (8.0%). But the closest option is J:8.0%.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in understanding the purchase price. Maybe 8¼ is 8.25 as in 8.25% of face value, so 82.5 dollars.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for something else. Maybe the effective yield is calculated as the coupon rate divided by (1 - (discount / face value)).

So discount is face value minus purchase price. So if purchase price is 82.5, discount is 917.5.

Wait, that formula doesn't seem familiar. Alternatively, perhaps the effective yield is (C / (F - discount)) * 100.

So C is 65, F is 1000, discount is 917.5, so F - discount is 82.5.

So 65 /82.5 = same as before,
