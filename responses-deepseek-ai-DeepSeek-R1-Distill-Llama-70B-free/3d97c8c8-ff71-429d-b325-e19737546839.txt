Question:

An owner entered into a written contract with a landscaper whereby the landscaper promised to landscape the exterior of the owner's house for the sum of $5,000. According to their agreement, the owner was to pay the money to the landscaper's son. The landscaper intended to have the $5,000 given to his son as a graduation present. After the landscaper completed the job, the landscaper requested that the owner pay the $5,000 to him instead of to his son. The owner paid the landscaper. The next day, the son learned of the contract between the landscaper and the owner, as well as the payment to his father. In an action by the son against the owner for $5,000, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the written contract between the owner and the landscaper operated as a valid assignment to the son.
B: prevail, because the son was the intended beneficiary under the terms of the written contract between the owner and the landscaper.
C: not prevail, because the son did not give any consideration.
D: prevail, because the owner had a duty to honor the original agreement.
E: not prevail, because the landscaper, as the original contractor, had the right to alter the terms of payment.
F: not prevail, because the son was not a party to the original contract.
G: not prevail, because the son was not directly involved in the contractual agreement.
H: prevail, because the owner breached the contract by not paying the son.
I: prevail, because the son was a third party beneficiary of the contract.
J: not prevail, because the owner and the landscaper effectively modified their agreement, thereby depriving the son of any rights he may have had.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step.

The situation is: An owner hired a landscaper to do some work for $5,000. The contract says the owner should pay the landscaper's son. The landscaper's plan was to give this money to his son as a graduation gift. After the job was done, the landscaper asked the owner to pay him directly instead of the son. The owner did that. Now, the son is suing the owner for the $5,000.

Hmm, so the son is the third party here. I remember that when a contract is made, the third party can sometimes have rights, but it depends on the situation. There's something about third-party beneficiaries. Let me think.

First, the contract was between the owner and the landscaper. The owner agreed to pay the son, but then the landscaper changed his mind and asked for the money himself, and the owner complied. So, can the son still claim the money?

I think about the concept of third-party beneficiary rights. A third party can sue if they are an intended beneficiary. That happens when the contract is made with the intent that the third party directly benefits. Like, if I contract with someone to pay my debt, the creditor is an intended beneficiary.

In this case, the landscaper wanted the $5,000 to go to his son as a gift. So the son was definitely intended to benefit. But then the landscaper, after the work was done, changed the payment method. Does that affect the son's rights?

Wait, once the contract is made, can the original parties change it in a way that deprives the third party of their rights? I think that if the third party's rights have already vested, they can't be taken away by modifying the contract without the third party's consent.

When do third-party beneficiary rights vest? I believe it's when the beneficiary either brings a lawsuit on the contract, changes their position in reliance on the promise, or when the beneficiary learns of the contract and agrees to it. In this case, the son didn't know about the contract until after the payment was made. So he didn't take any action beforehand. 

So if the son's rights hadn't vested yet, the original parties (owner and landscaper) could modify the contract. The landscaper asked the owner to pay him instead, which the owner did. So the modification here was the change in who gets paid. If the son's rights hadn't vested, then the modification is valid, and the son can't claim the money anymore.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the son prevails because he's a third-party beneficiary. But wait, if his rights hadn't vested, the modification would prevent that. So maybe he doesn't prevail.

Option J says the son doesn't prevail because the owner and landscaper modified their agreement, depriving the son of his rights. That sounds right if the rights hadn't vested yet.

Option B says the son prevails as an intended beneficiary. But again, if the rights weren't vested, the contract modification could affect that.

What about consideration? Option C says the son didn't give consideration. But as a third-party beneficiary, the beneficiary doesn't need to provide consideration; it's the main contract that requires consideration between the parties.

So, the key here is whether the son's rights as a beneficiary had vested. Since the payment was made after the contract was modified and the son found out later, his rights might not have vested. Therefore, the modification would be effective, and the son can't claim the money.

So the correct answer is probably J.

The case involves a contract between an owner and a landscaper where payment was to be made to the landscaper's son as a graduation gift. However, after the work was completed, the landscaper requested and received payment directly from the owner. The son, upon learning of the contract and the payment, sued the owner for the $5,000.

The key issue revolves around the son's status as a third-party beneficiary. A third party can enforce a contract if they are an intended beneficiary, which occurs when the contract is made with the intent to directly benefit the third party. Here, the landscaper intended the $5,000 as a gift for his son, making the son an intended beneficiary.

However, for a third-party beneficiary's rights to be enforceable, those rights must have vested. Vesting typically occurs when the beneficiary takes some action in reliance on the promise, brings a lawsuit, or otherwise assents to the arrangement. In this case, the son learned of the contract and the payment only after the modification, and there is no indication that he took any prior action in reliance on the promise. Therefore, his rights as a beneficiary had not vested.

Since the son's rights had not vested, the owner and landscaper could modify the contract by agreeing to change the payee. This modification effectively deprived the son of his potential claim. As a result, the son cannot prevail in his action against the owner.

The correct answer is:

J: not prevail, because the owner and the landscaper effectively modified their agreement, thereby depriving the son of any rights he may have had.

Answer: J
