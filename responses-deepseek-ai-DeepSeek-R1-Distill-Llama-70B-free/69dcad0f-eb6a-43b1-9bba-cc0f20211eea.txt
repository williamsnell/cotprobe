Okay, so I have to solve this problem about stock options. Let me see what the question is asking. 

The question says that Amalgamated Corp. offered a VP an option to buy 1000 shares at 95% of the average price for the day. The high was 19 and 3/8, and the low was 18 and 3/4. I need to find the price per share of the option.

Hmm, I think the average price here refers to the average of the high and low prices for the day. Because sometimes, when people talk about average stock price, they mean the average of the high and low. So first, I'll calculate that.

Wait, the high is 19 3/8. Let me convert that to a decimal. 3/8 is 0.375, so 19.375. And the low is 18 3/4. 3/4 is 0.75, so 18.75.

So the high is 19.375 and the low is 18.75. The average would be (19.375 + 18.75)/2. Let me add those two first. 19.375 plus 18.75 is... 38.125. Then divide by 2, which gives 19.0625. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me add them again. 19.375 plus 18.75. 19 +18 is 37, 0.375 +0.75 is 1.125. So total is 38.125. Divided by 2 is 19.0625. So the average price is $19.0625.

But the option is at 95% of that average. So I need to calculate 95% of 19.0625. 

To find 95%, I can multiply 19.0625 by 0.95. Let's do that. 

Hmm, 19.0625 times 0.95. Let me break that down. 19 times 0.95 is 18.05. Then, 0.0625 * 0.95 is... 0.059375. So adding those together, 18.05 + 0.059375 equals 18.109375.

So the option price is $18.109375 per share. Looking at the options, option A is $18.109375. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in adding or converting. Let's confirm.

High is 19 3/8, which is 19.375. Low is 18.75. The average is (19.375 + 18.75)/2 = 38.125/2 = 19.0625. Then 95% of that is 19.0625 * 0.95.

Let me compute 19.0625 * 0.95 another way. 19.0625 is the same as 19 and 1/16, because 0.0625 is 1/16. So 0.95 is 19/20. So 19.0625 * 0.95 = (19 + 1/16) * (19/20). 

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 19.0625 * 0.95. Let's do it step by step.

19.0625 * 0.95 = ?

Well, 19.0625 * 1 is 19.0625. Subtracting 5% (which is 0.05) of 19.0625.

So 5% of 19.0625 is 0.953125. So subtract that from 19.0625.

19.0625 - 0.953125 = 18.109375. Yep, that's the same as before.

So the option price is $18.109375, which is option A.

The problem requires determining the price per share of a stock option offered by Amalgamated Corp. The option is set at 95% of the average stock price for the day, with the high price being 19⅜ ($19.375) and the low price being 18¾ ($18.75). 

First, the average price is calculated as the midpoint of the high and low prices:

\[
\text{Average Price} = \frac{19.375 + 18.75}{2} = \frac{38.125}{2} = 19.0625
\]

Next, the option price is 95% of this average price:

\[
\text{Option Price} = 0.95 \times 19.0625 = 18.109375
\]

Thus, the price per share at which the option was awarded is **$18.109375 per share**, corresponding to option **A**.
