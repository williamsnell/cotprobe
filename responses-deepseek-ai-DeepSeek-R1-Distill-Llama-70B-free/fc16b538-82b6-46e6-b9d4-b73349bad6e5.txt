Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about a household's saving and how much of that saving is added to cash balances, which affects the demand for loan contracts. The income is $30,000 per year. They save 10 percent of their income, and then they add three quarters of their savings to cash balances. The question is asking what the value of the loan contracts they demand would be.

Hmm, I remember that in economics, when households save, they can hold those savings in different forms—like cash, bank deposits, or other assets. The part that's added to cash balances is what affects the money supply, I think. But wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me think.

So, first, the household saves 10% of their income. Their income is $30,000, so 10% of that is $3,000. That's their savings. Now, they add three quarters of this saving to cash balances. Oh wait, three quarters is 75%, right? So 75% of $3,000 would be 0.75 * 3000. Let me calculate that. 0.75 times 3,000 is $2,250. So they add $2,250 to their cash balances.

Wait, but the question is about the loan contracts demanded. Hmm. I think loan contracts are related to how much they're borrowing. But wait, saving is about how much they're putting aside, not necessarily borrowing. Oh, maybe I should recall the concept of the demand for money or the demand for loanable funds.

Wait, in the loanable funds market, the supply is saving, and the demand is for investment. Households' savings can be held as money or loaned out. If they're adding to their cash balances, that means they're holding more money, so the amount they lend (which is the supply of loanable funds) would be their total savings minus the amount they're adding to cash.

Oh right, because if they save S, and they decide to hold M in cash, then the amount available for loans (the supply of loanable funds) is S - M.

So in this case, the household saves $3,000. They add $2,250 to cash, so the remaining must be what they're willing to lend. So the loan contracts they demand would be the amount they're supplying as loans. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the demand for loan contracts would be how much they're borrowing? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The household's saving is the amount they don't consume. They can hold this saving as cash (money) or lend it out (loan contracts). So the amount they add to cash is part of their savings, and the rest would be the amount they're willing to supply as loans.

So the supply of loanable funds from this household would be their savings minus the addition to cash. So S = $3,000. Cash added is $2,250. So the loan supply is 3,000 - 2,250 = $750.

But wait, the question is about the demand for loan contracts. Oh wait, maybe I got that wrong. Because loan contracts are when you borrow money, right? So the demand for loans would be how much they're borrowing. But in this case, the household is saving, so they're probably supplying loans, not demanding them.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read again. It says, "what would be the value of the loan contracts it demanded." Oh, so they're the ones demanding the loans. That would mean they're borrowing, which doesn't quite fit because they have savings. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the household's demand for loans, which would relate to their borrowing for investment or consumption. But that's not directly tied to their savings and cash holdings. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. If the household is saving, they might be supplying loanable funds. The demand for loan contracts could refer to how much they're demanding from others, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the household's own borrowings.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think about the equations.

In the loanable funds market, the supply comes from savings (S), and the demand is for investment (I). The equilibrium is where S = I, but this is in the aggregate. But for a single household, their supply of loanable funds would be their saving minus any change in their cash holdings.

Wait, I think the key is that when a household saves, they can choose to hold the savings as cash or as other financial assets, like loans. So the portion not held as cash is what's available for lending.

So in this case, the household's saving is $3,000. They decide to add three quarters to cash, so 3/4 * 3000 = $2,250. The rest, which is $750, must be the amount they're willing to lend. So that $750 would be the supply of loanable funds from this household.

But the question is asking about the loan contracts demanded. If they're supplying $750, then perhaps that's the amount they're offering as loans, meaning others are demanding it. But the question is about the household's demand for loans, which would be if they were borrowing. But in this scenario, they're saving, so it's more likely they're supplying loans, not demanding them.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of it another way. The question is phrased as "the value of the loan contracts it demanded." So the household is demanding loan contracts, meaning they are the borrowers. But wait, if they're saving, they have excess funds, so they would be suppliers, not demanders.

Unless the question is considering that the household's addition to cash affects their demand for money, which in turn affects their demand for loans. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Maybe it's just asking for the amount they're saving, and then the portion that's not held as cash. So 10% of $30k is $3k saved. 3/4 of that is added to cash, so $2250. Then, the remaining $750 is the amount they're willing to lend, i.e., the value of the loan contracts they supply. But the question is about the demand, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the household's demand for loans. If they are holding more cash, maybe their need to borrow is reduced. But I'm not sure how that ties in.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's go step by step.

1. Household income: $30,000/year.
2. Savings: 10% of income = 0.10 * 30,000 = $3,000.
3. They add three quarters (75%) of their savings to cash balances. So 0.75 * 3,000 = $2,250 added to cash.
4. The remaining is 25% of savings, which is 0.25 * 3,000 = $750. This amount is not added to cash, so it's used for something else—probably invested or lent out. So this $750 would be the amount they supply as loans.

But the question is about the demand for loan contracts. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the household's demand for loans is the amount they're taking out, but that doesn't seem to fit with the scenario where they're saving.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the household's demand for loanable funds, but that would be their desire to borrow, which doesn't align with their saving.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me think about it differently. Loan contracts typically represent debt—so when a household demands a loan, they're borrowing money. But in this case, the household is saving, so they're more likely to be supplying loans, not demanding them.

Wait, maybe the question is about the demand for cash versus demand deposits. No, that's more about the money demand.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded, and it's actually asking for the supply of loanable funds, which would be $750. But the options don't have $750 except option I. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: $3,000

B: $2,250

C: $4,500

D: $1,500

E: $900

F: $1,750

G: $6,000

H: $2,750

I: $750

J: $5,250

So option I is $750, which is the 25% of savings not added to cash. But the question is about the demand for loan contracts, which I thought was the amount they're supplying, but perhaps the question is considering that when they add to cash, they're reducing their demand for loans, or something else.

Wait a minute, perhaps the household's demand for loan contracts refers to how much they themselves are borrowing. But in this case, since they're saving, they might be net savers, not borrowers. So the demand for loans would be zero, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the household's demand for loans is determined by their income and their cash holdings. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the concepts of the money market and the loanable funds market.

Alternatively, perhaps the "loan contracts demanded" refers to the amount they're holding in loans, which would be the same as the amount they've supplied. So if they've supplied $750 in loans, that's the value of the loan contracts they've provided, but the question is phrased as "demanded", which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the household's demand for cash, and thus their demand for loans is indirectly related. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the equation for money supply. The money supply (M) includes cash and deposits. But when the household adds to their cash, it affects their demand for money. The rest of their savings would go into other assets, like bonds or loans.

So, the total savings is S = $3,000.

The amount added to cash is M = $2,250.

So the amount they're willing to lend (supply of loanable funds) is S - M = 3,000 - 2,250 = $750.

So the value of the loan contracts they supply is $750. But the question is about the demand. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is asking about the household's demand for loans, which would be their desire to borrow. But if they're saving, they might not be borrowing. Unless they're borrowing for some reason, but the question doesn't indicate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when they save, they're effectively reducing their own borrowing. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the total amount they have. They have an income of $30k, save $3k. They add $2,250 to cash, so their cash balance increases by that. The remaining $750 is perhaps invested elsewhere, like in bonds or loans. So the household's demand for loan contracts (i.e., their demand to hold such financial assets) would be $750.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the supply of loanable funds, which would be $750, option I.

But the question clearly states "loan contracts it demanded," which suggests borrowing. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question is about the total amount the household is contributing to the loan market, which would be the amount they save and then lend out. So 10% saved is $3,000. They add 3/4 to cash, so 3/4 * 3,000 = $2,250. The remaining 1/4 is $750, which is lent out. So the demand for loan contracts would be the amount they're borrowing, but that doesn't make sense because they're saving.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when they save and hold cash, they're reducing their own borrowing, thus the demand for loans is lower. But without knowing their previous borrowing, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the household's net increase in financial assets. Their saving is $3,000. They add $2,250 to cash, so their other financial assets (like loans) increase by $750. So the value of the loan contracts they hold is $750. But again, the question is about demand, not supply.

I'm getting stuck between the terms 'supply' and 'demand'. The question says 'loan contracts demanded'—so perhaps it's the amount they're demanding, i.e., wanting to borrow. But in this case, since they're saving, they might not be borrowing, so the demand would be zero. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded and it's actually about the supply. If that's the case, then the answer would be $750, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the amount they save, which is $3,000, but that's option A.

Wait, I think I need to make a decision. Based on what I understand, the household saves $3,000. They add $2,250 to cash, so the remaining $750 is the amount they lend, which would be the supply of loanable funds. But the question is about the demand for loan contracts, which is confusing. Unless the question intended to ask about the supply, then the answer would be $750, option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me. Maybe the loan contracts demanded refers to their own borrowings. If they're saving, maybe they're not borrowing, so the demand is zero. But there's no zero option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recap.

Household income: $30,000.

Savings: 10% → $3,000.

Add three quarters of savings to cash: 0.75 * 3,000 = $2,250.

So cash increases by $2,250.

The remaining is $750, which must be invested or lent out.

So the value of loan contracts they supply is $750.

But the question is about the demand, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the demand for money (cash), which is $2,250. Then, the demand for loan contracts would be the rest, $750. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the demand for loan contracts is the amount they're holding in loans, which would be $750.

But the question says 'demanded', which in economics usually refers to what they want to buy or borrow. If they're supplying loans, they're on the supply side, not the demand side.

I'm a bit stuck here, but I think the intended answer is $750, which is option I.
</think>

The household has an income of $30,000 per year and saves 10% of it, which equals $3,000. They add three quarters (75%) of their savings to cash balances, amounting to $2,250. The remaining $750 is not added to cash and is assumed to be lent out or invested in loan contracts. The question asks for the value of the loan contracts "demanded," but this phrasing is somewhat ambiguous. 

If "loan contracts demanded" refers to the household's borrowing activity, it would not align with the scenario since the household is saving, not borrowing. However, if the question is interpreted as asking for the amount the household supplies to the loan market (i.e., the value of loan contracts they provide), the correct answer would be $750. This is the portion of their savings not added to cash balances, which is likely lent out or invested.

Given the options provided, the most reasonable interpretation is that the question is asking for the amount the household supplies to the loan market, which is $750. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: $750

Answer: I
