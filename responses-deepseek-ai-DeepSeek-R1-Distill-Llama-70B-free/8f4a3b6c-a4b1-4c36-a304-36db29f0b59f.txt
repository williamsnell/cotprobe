Question:

Distinguish economic goods from free goods, and give an example of each.

Options:

A: Economic goods require large amounts of resources to produce, such as diamonds, while free goods are created with minimal resources, like sunlight.
B: Economic goods are non-renewable resources, like coal. Free goods regenerate naturally and have no cost, like wind energy.
C: Economic goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air. Free goods are scarce and command a positive price, like oil.
D: Economic goods and free goods are the same, both are available in sufficient quantity to satisfy all wants.
E: Economic goods are produced by the government and are free of charge, like public education. Free goods are produced by private companies and have high prices, like smartphones.
F: Economic goods are those that cannot be consumed by multiple people at once, like a sandwich. Free goods can be shared by many simultaneously, like a public park.
G: Economic goods are free, like air. Free goods are costly and scarce, like oil.
H: Economic goods are scarce and command a positive price, like oil. Free goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air.
I: Economic goods are services that come at a cost, like legal advice. Free goods are natural phenomena that are not owned, like moonlight.
J: Economic goods are items with no intrinsic value, like currency. Free goods are essential for survival and cannot be owned, like oxygen.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about distinguishing economic goods from free goods and providing an example of each. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my basic economics class that economic goods are things that are scarce and have a positive price. They are limited in supply, so people have to make choices about how to use them. On the other hand, free goods are those that are plentiful, so much so that everyone can have as much as they want without paying anything. These are not scarce, so they don't have a price.

Wait, wait. So economic goods are scarce and have a price. Free goods are abundant and don't cost anything. Got it. So examples of economic goods would be things like oil, food, carsâ€”things you have to pay for because they're not unlimited. Free goods would be like air, sunlight, maybe rainwater because you don't pay for them.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Economic goods require lots of resources, like diamonds. Free goods need minimal resources, like sunlight. Hmm, this seems to mix up scarcity with resource use. Diamonds are scarce, which fits economic goods. Sunlight is free, yes. But is the key point about resources? Maybe, but I think the main distinction is scarcity and price.

Option B: Economic goods are non-renewable, like coal. Free goods are renewable, like wind. Wait, but coal is scarce and has a cost, so it's an economic good. Wind is free, but it's more about whether it's a good that's priced. But I'm not sure if this is the best way to distinguish them. Also, some renewable resources can be economic goods if they're managed in a way that they become scarce.

Option C: Economic goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air. Free goods are scarce and cost money. No, this is backwards. Economic goods are scarce, so they can't satisfy all wants. Air is a free good. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: Economic and free goods are the same, both available enough. No, that can't be right. They're opposites.

Option E: Economic goods are produced by the government for free, like public education. Free goods are from private companies and pricey. That doesn't make sense. Public education isn't free in the economic sense; it's paid through taxes. Plus, economic goods can come from any source, not just government.

Option F: Economic goods can't be consumed by multiple people at once, like a sandwich. Free goods can be shared. Wait, this is about rivalrous and non-rivalrous goods. Economic goods are rivalrous (if I eat a sandwich, you can't), and free goods are non-rivalrous (like a public park where many can use it). So F is talking about something else, not exactly the same as economic vs free goods. But maybe it's a related concept, but not the direct answer.

Option G: Economic goods are free, like air. No, that's wrong because economic goods cost money. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Economic goods are scarce and cost money, like oil. Free goods are plentiful, like air. Yes, this matches what I remember. Economic goods have a price because they're scarce; free goods don't because they're abundant.

Option I: Economic goods are paid services, like legal advice. Free goods are natural, like moonlight. This seems correct too, but let me think. Legal advice is an economic good because it's scarce and you pay for it. Moonlight is a free good. So I is also a possible correct option. But I need to see which is the best fit.

Option J: Economic goods have no intrinsic value, like currency. Free goods are essential, like oxygen. Currency does have value, so J seems off.

So both H and I seem correct, but I need to check the exact definitions again. Economic goods are those that are scarce and have a price. Free goods are non-scarce and no price. So H gives examples that fit: oil as economic, air as free. I gives legal advice as economic and moonlight as free. Both are correct, but perhaps H is the more direct answer because it's more about physical goods. But the question asks for examples of each, so both could be correct. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I should check the exact wording of the options.

Wait, the question is to distinguish economic goods from free goods, and give an example of each. So the correct answer should correctly define both and provide correct examples.

Looking again:

Option H says economic goods are scarce and command a positive price, like oil. Free goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air. That's correct.

Option I says economic goods are services that cost, like legal advice. Free goods are natural phenomena not owned, like moonlight. Also correct, but is it as direct as H?

I think both H and I are correct, but perhaps the question expects the more classic examples. Oil and air are standard examples given in economics.

So I think the answer is H.

To distinguish economic goods from free goods, it is important to focus on scarcity and price. Economic goods are scarce, meaning their supply is limited relative to demand, and they command a positive price. Examples include oil, food, and other resources that require trade-offs. Free goods, on the other hand, are abundant and available in sufficient quantity to satisfy all wants, making them non-scarce and without a price. Examples include air and sunlight.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** mixes scarcity with resource use, which is not the key distinction.
- **Option B** focuses on renewable vs. non-renewable resources, which is not the defining criterion.
- **Option C** reverses the definitions, incorrectly stating that economic goods are plentiful.
- **Option D** incorrectly claims that economic and free goods are the same.
- **Option E** misrepresents economic goods as government-produced and free, which is not accurate.
- **Option F** discusses rivalrous vs. non-rivalrous goods, a related concept but not the direct answer.
- **Option G** incorrectly states that economic goods are free.
- **Option H** correctly defines economic goods as scarce and priced (e.g., oil) and free goods as plentiful and unpriced (e.g., air).
- **Option I** also provides correct examples but focuses on services and natural phenomena, which is less direct than Option H.
- **Option J** incorrectly describes economic goods as having no intrinsic value.

Option H provides the most direct and classic examples, aligning with standard economic definitions.

Answer: H
