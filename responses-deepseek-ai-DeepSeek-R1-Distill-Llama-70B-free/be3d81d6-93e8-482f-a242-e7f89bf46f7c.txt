Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The problem says that positive integers x and y have a product of 56, and x is less than y. So, x * y = 56, and x < y. Then, there's another condition: seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus 14 times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, the reciprocal of a number is just 1 divided by that number. So, the reciprocal of the smaller integer is 1/x, and the reciprocal of the larger is 1/y. So the equation they give is 7*(1/x) + 14*(1/y) = 4. 

So now I have two equations:

1. x * y = 56
2. 7/x + 14/y = 4

And x and y are positive integers with x < y.

Alright, the question is asking for the value of x. So I need to solve these equations to find x.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

From equation 1, y = 56 / x.

Substituting this into equation 2:

7/x + 14/(56/x) = 4

Wait, let me make sure I write that correctly. 14 divided by (56/x) is the same as 14 * (x/56). Because dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal.

So substitute y into equation 2:

7/x + 14*(x/56) = 4

Simplify the second term: 14*(x/56) = (14/56)*x = (1/4)*x. Because 14 divided by 56 is 0.25, which is 1/4.

So now the equation becomes:

7/x + (1/4)x = 4

Let me write that clearly:

7/x + (x/4) = 4

Hmm, okay, so now I have an equation with x in it. Let's solve for x.

To eliminate the fraction with x in the denominator, maybe I can multiply each term by 4x. That should clear the denominators.

So multiplying each term by 4x:

4x*(7/x) + 4x*(x/4) = 4x*4

Simplify each term:

First term: 4x*(7/x) = 4 * 7 = 28

Second term: 4x*(x/4) = x^2

Right side: 4x*4 = 16x

So putting it all together:

28 + x² = 16x

Wait, that gives me a quadratic equation. Let's rearrange it.

x² - 16x + 28 = 0

Hmm, let's see. I can try to factor this quadratic, or use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it factors.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 28 and add up to -16. Wait, since the middle term is -16x and the constant term is +28, the factors should both be negative because their product is positive and sum is negative.

So factors of 28: 1 & 28, 2 &14, 4&7.

Looking for two numbers that add up to -16. Let's see: -14 and -2: -14 * -2 = 28, and -14 + (-2) = -16. Yes, that works.

So the quadratic factors as (x - 14)(x - 2) = 0.

So the solutions are x=14 and x=2.

But wait, we have the condition that x < y. Remember, x is the smaller integer because x < y.

So let's think about the possible x values.

If x=2, then y = 56/x =56/2=28. So y=28. Then x=2 < y=28, which fits.

If x=14, then y=56/14 =4. But then x=14 and y=4. Here, x=14 is not less than y=4. So that violates the condition x < y. So x cannot be14.

So only x=2 is a valid solution.

Wait, but let me double-check the second equation to make sure.

Plugging x=2 and y=28 into 7/x +14/y:

7/2 +14/28 = 3.5 + 0.5 =4. Yes, that adds up to 4. So it works.

So x must be 2.

The problem involves finding the value of \( x \) where positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) satisfy the conditions \( x \cdot y = 56 \), \( x < y \), and \( \frac{7}{x} + \frac{14}{y} = 4 \).

1. From \( x \cdot y = 56 \), we express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):  
   \[
   y = \frac{56}{x}.
   \]

2. Substitute \( y = \frac{56}{x} \) into the second equation:  
   \[
   \frac{7}{x} + \frac{14}{\frac{56}{x}} = 4.
   \]

3. Simplify the second term:  
   \[
   \frac{14}{\frac{56}{x}} = \frac{14 \cdot x}{56} = \frac{x}{4}.
   \]

4. The equation becomes:  
   \[
   \frac{7}{x} + \frac{x}{4} = 4.
   \]

5. Multiply through by \( 4x \) to eliminate denominators:  
   \[
   4x \cdot \frac{7}{x} + 4x \cdot \frac{x}{4} = 4x \cdot 4.
   \]

6. Simplify:  
   \[
   28 + x^2 = 16x.
   \]

7. Rearrange into a standard quadratic form:  
   \[
   x^2 - 16x + 28 = 0.
   \]

8. Factor the quadratic equation:  
   \[
   (x - 14)(x - 2) = 0.
   \]

9. The solutions are \( x = 14 \) and \( x = 2 \). Since \( x < y \), we check both solutions:  
   - If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = \frac{56}{2} = 28 \), and \( x < y \) is satisfied.  
   - If \( x = 14 \), then \( y = \frac{56}{14} = 4 \), but \( x < y \) is not satisfied.

10. Verify \( x = 2 \) in the second equation:  
    \[
    \frac{7}{2} + \frac{14}{28} = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4.
    \]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 2 \).
