Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a box on an inclined plane. The question is about what happens to the normal force as the angle of the plane increases. Hmm, I remember that the normal force is related to how the object presses against the surface. Right, when you have an object on a slope, the normal force isn't the same as its weight because part of the weight is acting along the incline.

Wait, the box isn't sliding, so it's in equilibrium. That means the forces along the incline must balance. The forces acting are the gravitational force (mg) pulling the box down, the normal force (N) perpendicular to the plane, and the static friction (f) opposing the motion along the plane.

I think I should break the weight into components. The weight (mg) can be split into two parts: one perpendicular to the incline and one parallel. The perpendicular component is mg cos(theta), and the parallel is mg sin(theta). Since the box isn't moving, the static friction must balance the parallel component. So f = mg sin(theta).

But the question is about the normal force. Oh right, the normal force equals the perpendicular component of the weight. So N = mg cos(theta). So as the angle theta increases, what happens to cos(theta)?

I remember that the cosine of an angle decreases as the angle increases from 0 to 90 degrees. Like, cos(0) is 1, cos(90) is 0. So as theta goes up, cos(theta) goes down, making N decrease.

So the normal force decreases as the angle increases. But wait, is it a linear decrease? Let me think. Cosine isn't a linear function. Its graph is curved. So as theta increases, the rate at which N decreases changes. For example, from theta=0 to theta=30 degrees, cos(theta) goes from 1 to about 0.866. Then from 30 to 60, it goes from 0.866 to 0.5. The decrease isn't the same each time, so it's not linear. So the normal force decreases nonlinearly.

Wait, but wait. The options say things like 'decreases nonlinearly', 'decreases exponentially' etc. So in the options, E is 'decreases nonlinearly', which matches because N = mg cos(theta), and cos(theta) isn't a straight line function.

So looking at the options, the answer should be E. But wait, let me check the options again. Option E says 'decreases nonlinearly'. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe someone might think that since N depends on cos(theta), which decreases, but maybe they think about the relation between theta and normal force being a straight line. No, because for small angles, the change in cos(theta) is roughly linear, but as theta becomes larger, it's definitely nonlinear.

So the correct answer is E: decreases nonlinearly.

The normal force on a box sitting on an inclined plane is given by \( N = mg \cos(\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle of the incline. As the angle \( \theta \) increases, \( \cos(\theta) \) decreases because the cosine function is nonlinear and diminishes from 1 at \( \theta = 0^\circ \) to 0 at \( \theta = 90^\circ \). This means the normal force decreases as the angle increases. However, the decrease is not linear because \( \cos(\theta) \) follows a curved relationship with \( \theta \). Therefore, the normal force decreases nonlinearly as the angle of the incline increases.

The correct answer is:

E: decreases nonlinearly

Answer: E
