Question:

A 75-year-old woman comes to the office because she has band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back. Physical examination discloses no abdominal tenderness to palpation. Findings on ultrasonography of the gallbladder are normal. Serum amylase concentration is within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Gallstones
B: Gastric cancer
C: Peptic Ulcer Disease
D: Herpes zoster
E: Irritable Bowel Syndrome
F: Appendicitis
G: Acalculous cholecystitis
H: Diverticulitis of the cecum
I: Hepatitis C

Alright, let's try to tackle this question. Hmm, okay, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen. The pain goes from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back. So, that's a specific area, right? The right upper quadrant and back.

She had an ultrasound of the gallbladder, which was normal. So gallstones or gallbladder issues are probably not the cause here. Her serum amylase is within normal, so pancreatitis might be ruled out too since high amylase usually indicates that.

Let me think about the symptoms. Burning, band-like pain. That makes me think of something that's causing a girdle-like pain, maybe around the abdomen. Oh, wait, could it be shingles? Like herpes zoster? Because shingles can cause a burning pain in a dermatomal distribution, which might present as a band around the torso.

The patient's physical exam shows no abdominal tenderness. So they didn't find any specific areas where pressing would cause pain. That aligns with something like shingles because the pain is more superficial, related to the nerves, rather than an organ issue.

So looking at the options, option D is Herpes zoster. That fits because the pain is described as band-like and burning, and the lack of findings on ultrasound and normal amylase points away from gallbladder or pancreatic issues.

Wait, what about other options? Let's go through them quickly.

A: Gallstones are less likely because the ultrasound was normal. If she had gallstones, you'd expect the ultrasound to pick them up, especially if they're causing symptoms.

B: Gastric cancer. Usually presents with weight loss, maybe abdominal pain, but not typically a band-like pain. Plus, the lack of tenderness on exam is a bit odd for that.

C: Peptic Ulcer Disease. Pain is usually more localized to the abdomen, maybe the epigastric area, and could be burning. But the back pain might not be as prominent, unless it's penetrating. But again, the physical exam might have shown some tenderness.

E: Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Usually causes crampy pain, bloating, changes in bowel habits. Doesn't typically present as a band-like pain around the back.

F: Appendicitis. Typically presents with pain starting around the periumbilicus and moving to the lower right abdomen. Not matching her symptom location.

G: Acalculous cholecystitis. That's gallbladder inflammation without gallstones, often in critically ill patients. Her ultrasound was normal, so probably not.

H: Diverticulitis of the cecum. That's on the lower right side, so pain would be in the lower abdomen, not upper.

I: Hepatitis C. That's a liver infection, but her symptoms don't point to hepatitis. Also, she doesn't have elevated liver enzymes mentioned.

So the most likely is D: Herpes zoster. The pain description fits a shingles outbreak affecting the thoracic dermatomes, causing the band-like pain. The normal tests support this because there's no abdominal pathology; it's a neurological issue.

The patient is a 75-year-old woman presenting with band-like, burning pain in the right upper abdomen extending to the midline of the back. Key findings include no abdominal tenderness on physical examination, normal ultrasonography of the gallbladder, and a normal serum amylase concentration. These findings help rule out gallbladder pathology (e.g., gallstones or acalculous cholecystitis), pancreatic issues (e.g., pancreatitis), and other abdominal pathologies like peptic ulcer disease or diverticulitis.

The description of band-like, burning pain is characteristic of herpes zoster (shingles), which causes pain in a dermatomal distribution. The lack of abdominal tenderness and normal diagnostic tests further support this diagnosis, as shingles is a neurological condition rather than an abdominal pathology. Other options, such as gastric cancer or hepatitis C, are less likely given the clinical presentation and normal test results.

Thus, the most likely diagnosis is **D: Herpes zoster**.
