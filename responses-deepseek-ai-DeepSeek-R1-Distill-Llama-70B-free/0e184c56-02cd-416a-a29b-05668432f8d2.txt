Question:

A state statute provides: "Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. " Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.
B: not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.
C: guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.
D: guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, there's this statute that says when a person knows or should know they're being arrested by a police officer, they must not use force or weapons to resist. If they do, they can be fined or imprisoned. 

In this case, there was a bank robbery, and a police officer arrested a suspect the same day. The officer and suspect have different stories. The officer says the suspect resisted after being caught, hit him, so he used his nightstick. The suspect says he cursed, and the officer started hitting him, so he hit back in self-defense.

The suspect is charged with assault. The question is whether he's guilty or not based on the statute and the circumstances.

Hmm, so the key points are the lawfulness of the arrest and who the jury believes. The statute seems to make it a duty not to resist if you know you're being arrested. So if the arrest is lawful, then resisting is a crime. But if the arrest is unlawful, maybe the suspect has a right to resist?

Wait, I remember that in some places, if an arrest is unlawful, the person being arrested can use reasonable force to resist. So if the arrest was unlawful because there was no probable cause, then the suspect might not be guilty for resisting, especially if that's what the jury believes.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not guilty if the arrest was unlawful and the jury believes the suspect's story. That makes sense because if the arrest was without probable cause, the suspect might have the right to resist.

Option B: Not guilty if the arrest was lawful but the jury believes the suspect. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the arrest is lawful, the suspect isn't allowed to resist. So even if the jury believes the suspect's version, if the arrest was lawful, the suspect is guilty because he used force.

Option C: Guilty if the arrest was lawful, regardless of the story. That seems right because the statute says you can't resist a lawful arrest. So even if the suspect cursed first, if the arrest was lawful, hitting the officer would be a crime.

Option D: Guilty if arrest was unlawful, regardless. That doesn't fit because if the arrest is unlawful, the suspect might have a right to resist, so he wouldn't be guilty.

Wait, but the suspect is charged with assault. So the elements are using force against the officer. The defense would be that the arrest was unlawful, so his resistance was justified.

So, under the statute, the duty is to not resist if you know you're being arrested. But if the arrest is unlawful, perhaps that duty doesn't apply. So the suspect's guilt depends on the lawfulness of the arrest.

If the arrest was unlawful (no probable cause), then the suspect's resistance might be justified, making him not guilty. But if the arrest was lawful, then the suspect's actions, even in self-defense, wouldn't justify using force against the officer.

Wait, but in the suspect's account, he was just cursing, and the officer started hitting him. So if the jury believes that, maybe the officer used excessive force, and the suspect's response was self-defense. But does that matter if the arrest itself was lawful?

Hmm, the statute doesn't mention self-defense. It simply prohibits using force when being arrested. So regardless of whether the officer's actions were justified, if the arrest was lawful, the suspect can't use force. So even if the officer was hitting him, if the arrest was lawful, the suspect can't hit back.

Wait, but self-defense is a common law defense. So if the officer used excessive force, maybe the suspect can claim self-defense. But the statute here might be making it so that any resistance is a crime, regardless of the officer's actions.

Wait, but the statute says "refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest." So even if the officer is using force, the suspect can't resist. So the suspect's only defense would be if the arrest was unlawful, in which case the statute doesn't apply.

So, if the arrest was lawful, the suspect can't use force, so he's guilty. If the arrest was unlawful, then the statute doesn't require him to refrain, so he's not guilty.

Looking at the options again. Option A says not guilty if arrest was unlawful and jury believes suspect's account. That fits because if the arrest was unlawful (no probable cause), then the duty under the statute doesn't apply, and the suspect isn't guilty.

Option C says guilty if arrest was lawful, regardless of the story. Because even if the suspect says the officer hit him first, under the statute, he can't resist a lawful arrest, so he's guilty.

So the correct answer would be either A or C. The question is, what's the correct condition for guilt or innocence.

Wait, the possible outcomes: The suspect is charged with assault. So in a lawful arrest, any resistance is a crime. If the arrest is unlawful, then the suspect's resistance is justified.

So, the answer depends on whether the arrest was lawful. The officer arrested the suspect because he believed he was involved in the robbery. If that belief was based on probable cause, the arrest is lawful. If not, it's unlawful.

So, in the scenario, the officer's belief might be based on probable cause if there was enough evidence. But the question doesn't give details on that. So the answer options are contingent on whether the arrest was lawful or not.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer is A and C.

Wait, the question is asking which option is correct. So if the arrest was unlawful, and the jury believes the suspect's account, then he's not guilty because the statute doesn't apply. That's option A.

But what if the arrest is lawful? Then regardless of the story, the suspect is guilty because he can't resist. So option C says guilty if arrest was lawful, regardless of which account is believed. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if the arrest was unlawful, the suspect isn't guilty, so option A is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what the suspect should be found. So the answer depends on both the lawfulness of the arrest and the jury's belief.

So the correct answer is A: not guilty if arrest was unlawful and the jury believes the suspect.

But I'm a bit confused because if the arrest is lawful, then regardless of the circumstances, the suspect is guilty. So option C would be correct if the arrest is lawful.

But the options are mutually exclusive. So which is the correct answer based on the scenario.

Wait, the question is asking what the suspect should be found based on the possibilities. So if the arrest was unlawful and the jury believes the suspect, then he's not guilty. That's option A.

If the arrest was lawful, then regardless of the story, he's guilty. So the correct answer would be A or C depending on the circumstances.

But the question is about what should happen, considering both possibilities. So the correct answer is A because if the arrest is unlawful, he's not guilty. If the arrest is lawful, he is guilty.

Wait, but the options are about what the suspect 'should be found' based on certain conditions.

So looking again, the possible correct answers are A and C. But the question is asking which option is correct.

Wait, the suspect is charged with assault. The defense would be that the arrest was unlawful, thus he was justified in using force.

Under the statute, if the arrest is unlawful (without probable cause), then the suspect doesn't have a duty to refrain, so using force isn't a violation of the statute. Thus, he wouldn't be guilty under the statute, but could he still be guilty of assault under common law?

Wait, no, because the statute defines the offense. So if the statute doesn't apply because the arrest was unlawful, then the suspect isn't guilty under that statute.

But wait, the suspect is charged with assault, not under the statute but as a separate crime. Or is the statute the crime? Let me read the question again.

The statute makes it a crime to resist arrest when you know you're being arrested. So the suspect is charged with assault. So perhaps the assault is a separate offense, but the statute is about resisting arrest.

Wait, maybe I'm conflating the two. The statute makes resisting arrest a crime, punishable by fine/imprisonment. The suspect is charged with assault, so that's a different charge. So the assault is a separate offense, and the suspect's defense would be that he acted in self-defense because the officer was using excessive force.

But if the arrest was lawful, then the officer has the right to make the arrest, and even if the suspect believes the force was excessive, he can't use force in return. So in that case, the suspect can't claim self-defense for assaulting the officer during a lawful arrest.

But if the arrest was unlawful, then the officer has no right to make the arrest, so the suspect can use reasonable force to resist, including self-defense if the officer uses excessive force.

So, if the arrest was lawful (probable cause), then the suspect can't resist, so any assault would be guilty. If the arrest was unlawful, then the suspect can resist, so if the jury believes the suspect's account (that the officer hit him first), then the suspect's actions were in self-defense, so he's not guilty of assault.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not guilty if arrest was unlawful and jury believes suspect's account.

That fits because if the arrest is unlawful, and the suspect was acting in self-defense (as per his account), then he's not guilty of assault.

Option C: Guilty if arrest was lawful, regardless of which account the jury believes.

Because if the arrest is lawful, the suspect can't use force, so even if the officer used excessive force, the suspect can't hit back. So he's guilty of assault.

So the correct answer depends on the lawfulness of the arrest and the jury's belief.

The question is, which option correctly states the outcome.

So the correct answer would be A and C, but since the options are separate, the correct answer is A if the arrest was unlawful and the jury believes the suspect. C if the arrest was lawful, regardless of belief.

But the question is asking which option is correct, not which condition leads to which outcome.

So the correct answer is A because if the arrest is unlawful, the suspect isn't guilty. But wait, the question is about the suspect being found guilty or not based on the conditions.

Wait, the question is about what the suspect should be found. So the answer is either A or C.

In the options, the only correct one is A and C. So if the arrest is lawful, option C applies. If it's unlawful, option A applies.

But the question is which option is correct, so I think the correct answer is A.

Wait, no, because the question is about the suspect being charged with assault. So under the common law, if the arrest is lawful, the suspect can't use force, so the assault is unlawful. If the arrest is unlawful, the suspect can use reasonable force, so the assault may be justified.

So the suspect should be found not guilty only if the arrest was unlawful and the jury believes his account. Otherwise, he's guilty.

So the correct answer is A.

The question revolves around a statute that prohibits resisting arrest by using force or weapons when a person knows or should know they are being arrested. The suspect is charged with assault, and the outcome depends on the lawfulness of the arrest and the jury's belief in the suspect's account. Here's the analysis:

1. **If the arrest was lawful**:  
   Under the statute, a person has a duty to refrain from using force or weapons when being lawfully arrested. Even if the suspect claims self-defense or that the officer used excessive force, the statute prohibits resisting a lawful arrest. Therefore, if the arrest was lawful, the suspect would be guilty of assault, regardless of the jury's belief in the suspect's account.

2. **If the arrest was unlawful**:  
   If the arrest was unlawful (e.g., without probable cause), the suspect's duty to refrain from resisting under the statute does not apply. In this case, the suspect may have a right to use reasonable force to resist, especially if the officer used excessive force. If the jury believes the suspect's account (e.g., that the officer initiated violence), the suspect's actions could be justified as self-defense, and they would not be guilty of assault.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Correct. If the arrest was unlawful and the jury believes the suspect's account, the suspect is not guilty because the statute does not apply, and the suspect's actions may be justified as self-defense.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. If the arrest was lawful, the suspect cannot resist, even if the jury believes the suspect's account. The statute prohibits resisting a lawful arrest.  
- **Option C**: Correct. If the arrest was lawful, the suspect is guilty regardless of the jury's belief in the suspect's account, as resisting a lawful arrest is a violation of the statute.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. If the arrest was unlawful, the suspect may have a right to resist, so they would not necessarily be guilty regardless of the jury's belief.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A**, as it accurately reflects the scenario where the arrest was unlawful, and the jury believes the suspect's account, leading to a not guilty verdict. 

Answer: A
