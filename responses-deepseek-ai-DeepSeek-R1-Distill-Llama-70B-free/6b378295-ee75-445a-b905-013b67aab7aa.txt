Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about required reserves. I remember from my economics class that required reserves are the amount of funds that banks must hold and can't lend out. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question is asking about what required reserves can or cannot do. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says required reserves can be used by banks to make loans or buy investments. Wait, I thought required reserves are funds that banks must keep, not use for lending. So A might be incorrect because they can't use them for loans. But I'm not 100% sure.

Option B states they must be held at the FED exclusively. I think banks can keep some in their vaults, so maybe B is wrong.

Option C says they must be kept in a bank's vault. I remember that required reserves can be held either in the bank's vault or at the Federal Reserve. So C is incorrect because it's not only the vault.

Option D claims they're optional for large banks but required for smaller ones. I don't think size affects whether they're required; all banks have to keep required reserves, but maybe the percentage varies. So D might not be right.

Option E says they can be invested in government securities. I'm not sure about this. I think required reserves have to be in a specific form, maybe cash or reserves at the Fed, but not sure if they can invest in securities. Maybe E is incorrect.

Option F suggests they must be used to pay off bank debts. That doesn't sound right. Required reserves are about liquidity, not directly paying debts. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says they can be used to cover operational expenses. I don't think so. Those funds are for reserves, not for covering day-to-day expenses. So G is likely incorrect.

Option H states they can be held in a bank's vault or its account at the FED. This rings a bell. Yes, I remember that required reserves can be in either place. So H might be the correct answer.

Option I claims they must be used to make loans. No, that's the opposite. Required reserves are kept and not lent out. So I is wrong.

Option J says they are not required to be held by banks. That's the opposite of what required reserves are, so J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: can be held in a bank's vault or its account at the FED.

The correct answer is H because required reserves can be held in a bank's vault or its account at the Federal Reserve.

Answer: H
