Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about how many electrons need to be removed from a coin to leave it with a positive charge of 1.0 × 10^-7 Coulombs. Hmm, right, because removing electrons makes the object positively charged.

Alright, I remember that the charge of a single electron is a fundamental constant. Wait, what's the exact value? Let me think. Oh right, the elementary charge is approximately 1.6 × 10^-19 Coulombs per electron. And since each electron carries a negative charge, removing them would leave the object with a positive charge.

So the problem is basically asking, how many electrons have a total charge equal to 1.0 × 10^-7 C. Because when you remove that many, the coin's charge would be positive that amount.

Let me put that into an equation. Let n be the number of electrons. So the total charge that would be removed is n multiplied by the charge per electron. But wait, since removing electrons adds positive charge, the charge of the coin (Q) equals n times e, where e is 1.6e-19 C.

So Q = n * e. We need to solve for n, which is the number of electrons removed.

So n = Q / e.

Plugging in the numbers, Q is 1.0e-7 C, e is 1.6e-19 C per electron.

Calculating that: n = (1.0e-7) / (1.6e-19) = (1.0 / 1.6) * 10^(-7 - (-19)) ) = (0.625) * 10^(12) = 6.25 × 10^11 electrons.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see exactly 6.25e11. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: 8.5e11
B:7.1e11
C:7.5e11
D:9.2e11
E:3.8e11
F:4.5e11
G:6.3e11
H:5.0e11
I:8.0e11
J:6.9e11

Hmm, none have exactly 6.25e11. Closest is probably option G (6.3e11) or J (6.9e11). Wait, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recalculate. 1e-7 divided by 1.6e-19.

1e-7 is 10^-7, 1.6e-19 is 1.6 ×10^-19.

So 10^-7 / (1.6 ×10^-19) ) = (1/1.6) × 10^(-7 +19) ) = 0.625 × 10^12 = 6.25 × 10^11.

So 6.25e11. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the charge per electron is taken as 1.602e-19, which is a more precise value.

Let me try that. So e = 1.602 ×10^-19 C.

n = 1e-7 / 1.602e-19 = (1 / 1.602) )e12.

1 divided by 1.602 is approximately 0.6245, so 0.6245e12 is 6.245e11, which is about 6.25e11. Still, not matching any options exactly.

Wait, perhaps the question uses e = 1.6e-19 for simplicity. Then the calculation is as before, 6.25e11. Looking back at the options, I see that option G is 6.3e11, which is close. But wait, option J is 6.9e11, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let's check it again.

Wait, 1e-7 / 1.6e-19 = (1 / 1.6) * 1e12.

1 / 1.6 is 0.625, so 0.625e12 is 6.25e11. So none of the options match exactly, but perhaps the closest is G:6.3e11 or J:6.9e11.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a decimal point. Let me double-check the exponents. Oh wait, 1e-7 is 1e-7, and 1.6e-19 is 1.6e-19. So when you divide them, it's (1e-7)/(1.6e-19) = (1/1.6) * (1e-7 / 1e-19) ) = 0.625 * 1e12 = 6.25e11.

So, 6.25e11 is the correct number. Looking at the options, the closest is option G:6.3e11, which is 6.3... but wait, perhaps the exact value is 6.25, but maybe the options rounded it differently.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again. Oh, wait, option J is 6.9e11, which is significantly higher. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation requires more precise handling.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the exponent. Let me check: 1e-7 is 10^-7, and 1.6e-19 is 1.6 × 10^-19. So subtracting exponents: -7 - (-19) = 12. So it's 10^12 multiplied by (1/1.6). So yes, 1/1.6 is 0.625, giving 6.25e11.

Looking again, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the charge as 1e-7 C, and whether the number is per electron or per proton? No, electrons are what's being removed.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the charge per electron is approximated as 1.6e-19 C, but perhaps the exact value used here is 1.602e-19, which would change the calculation a bit.

Let me try that. So, 1e-7 / 1.602e-19 = ?

1e-7 is 1e-7, and 1.602e-19 is 1.602 × 1e-19.

So n = (1e-7) / (1.602e-19) ) = (1 / 1.602) ) × (1e-7 / 1e-19) ) = 0.6245 × 1e12 = 6.245e11.

So approximately 6.245e11, which is about 6.25e11.

Looking at the options again, none match exactly. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, the question says "electrons would have to be removed." So the coin's charge is positive when electrons are removed. So the number of electrons to remove is equal to the charge divided by electron charge.

Wait, but perhaps the question is using the magnitude. So perhaps the charge per electron is 1.6e-19 C, so n= (1e-7) / (1.6e-19) = 6.25e11.

So, the options don't have 6.25e11, but option G is 6.3e11, which is 6.3, and J is 6.9e11. So perhaps the intended answer is G, but let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 1e-7 divided by 1.6e-19 using a calculator.

1e-7 / 1.6e-19 = (1 / 1.6) ) × 1e12 ≈ 0.625 × 1e12 = 6.25e11.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps the question is using 1.6e-18 C per electron? That would change things. Let me check. Oh no, that's not right because 1.6e-19 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using 1.6e-20? No, that's way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the number of significant figures. The given charge is 1.0e-7, which is two significant figures. So the answer should also have two.

So 6.25e11 rounds to 6.3e11 if rounded to two significant figures, because the third digit is 2. Wait, 6.25 is 6.2 when rounded to two sig figs? No, wait, 6.25 is 6.3 when rounded to two decimal places for two sig figs.

Wait, 6.25e11 → 6.3e11 when using two significant figures. So the correct answer would be approximately 6.3e11, which is option G.

Looking back, option G is 6.3e11. So that must be the correct choice.

To determine how many electrons must be removed from a coin to leave it with a charge of $+1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{C}$, we start by recognizing that the charge of a single electron is approximately $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$. The relationship between the total charge $Q$ and the number of electrons $n$ is given by:

\[
Q = n \cdot e
\]

Rearranging for $n$, we have:

\[
n = \frac{Q}{e}
\]

Substituting $Q = 1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{C}$ and $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$:

\[
n = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-7}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
n = \frac{1.0}{1.6} \times 10^{-7 + 19} = 0.625 \times 10^{12} = 6.25 \times 10^{11}
\]

Thus, approximately $6.25 \times 10^{11}$ electrons must be removed. Comparing this result to the provided options:

- **A: $8.5 \times 10^{11}$** — Too high.
- **B: $7.1 \times 10^{11}$** — Too high.
- **C: $7.5 \times 10^{11}$** — Too high.
- **D: $9.2 \times 10^{11}$** — Too high.
- **E: $3.8 \times 10^{11}$** — Too low.
- **F: $4.5 \times 10^{11}$** — Too low.
- **G: $6.3 \times 10^{11}$** — Closest to $6.25 \times 10^{11}$.
- **H: $5.0 \times 10^{11}$** — Too low.
- **I: $8.0 \times 10^{11}$** — Too high.
- **J: $6.9 \times 10^{11}$** — Slightly higher than $6.25 \times 10^{11}$.

The closest match to $6.25 \times 10^{11}$ is **G: $6.3 \times 10^{11}$**, which aligns with the calculation when rounded to two significant figures.
