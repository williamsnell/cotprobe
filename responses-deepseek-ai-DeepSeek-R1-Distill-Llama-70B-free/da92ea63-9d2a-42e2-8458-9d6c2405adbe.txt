Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about economic theory and its applicability. The question is: "Economic theory is applicable only to a capitalist society." Evaluate. The options are A through D.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about whether economic theory applies exclusively to capitalist societies or if it's broader.

I remember that economic theory covers various concepts like supply and demand, market structures, pricing, production, etc. These principles aren't limited to just capitalism. For example, socialist systems still have markets and allocate resources, so economic theories would apply there too. Even in a communist system, which might be more about central planning, some economic principles like scarcity and resource allocation would still be relevant, though perhaps less about markets.

Looking at the options:

Option A says economic theory applies to any system of competition. That makes sense because competition is a key element in many economic systems, not just capitalism. Socialist economies can have competition between state-owned enterprises, for instance.

Option B claims economic theory can't be applied to socialist societies. That doesn't seem right because socialist systems still deal with economic issues like resource allocation and pricing, just in different ways. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C states that economic theory is irrelevant to communist systems. I don't think that's true. Even in a communist system, you have to manage resources, so some economic theories would still apply, maybe more about planning and distribution.

Option D says economic theory is only applicable to capitalist systems. That's the statement the question is asking us to evaluate. From what I recall, economic theory is more general and applies to various economic systems, so D is likely incorrect.

So the correct answer would be A because economic theory applies wherever there's competition, which isn't limited to capitalism. Socialist and other systems can have competitive elements even if they're not capitalist.

Economic theory is not limited to capitalist societies; it applies to any system where competition exists, including socialist systems. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Economic theory is applicable to any system of competition

Answer: A
