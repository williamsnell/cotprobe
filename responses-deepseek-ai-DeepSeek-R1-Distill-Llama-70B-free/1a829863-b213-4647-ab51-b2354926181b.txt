Question:

Tay-Sachs is a disease caused by a recessive allele. Individuals with the genetic disorder usually do not survive more than a few years, and thus are not able to reproduce and pass on the gene. What would explain how this allele and its associated disease is preserved in the population?

Options:

A: Occasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual.
B: Tay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive.
C: The recessive allele is actually beneficial in certain environments.
D: The disease increases the fertility of those who carry it.
E: Tay-Sachs is a dominant disease, so carriers will show symptoms.
F: Spontaneous mutation converts the dominant allele to the recessive form.
G: Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.
H: The gene for Tay-Sachs also provides resistance to another disease.
I: The disease can be cured, so individuals with the disorder are able to reproduce.
J: The allele is not preserved and is actually decreasing in frequency.

Okay, so I've got this question about Tay-Sachs disease and genetics. Hmm, I remember that Tay-Sachs is a genetic disorder caused by a recessive allele. The question is asking why this allele is preserved in the population even though people with the disease don't survive long and can't pass it on.

Wait, the disease is caused by a recessive allele. That means you need two copies to actually have the disease. So if someone is homozygous recessive, they get Tay-Sachs. But carriers, who are heterozygous, don't show symptoms, right? Because recessive traits only show when both alleles are recessive.

So the main point is that the individuals with the disease don't reproduce, but somehow the allele isn't disappearing. Why? Because carriers might be more common. Since the allele is recessive, carriers (who are heterozygous) don't get sick. So they can pass on the allele without being affected themselves. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says the gene sometimes increases fitness. I don't think that's the case here. Tay-Sachs is bad, but maybe in some cases, like maybe resistance to something else? Not sure.

Option B: Asymptomatic in homozygous recessive. No, that's not right because the disease is severe when you have two recessive alleles.

Option C: The recessive allele is beneficial in certain environments. Oh, wait, I think there's something about Tay-Sachs and resistance to another disease like tuberculosis. But wait, is that the recessive allele that's beneficial? Or the carrier status?

Option D: The disease increases fertility. Doesn't seem right. The people with the disease don't survive to reproduce, so that doesn't make sense.

Option E: Tay-Sachs is dominant. No, because it's a recessive disease. So this can't be right.

Option F: Spontaneous mutation. Well, mutation can introduce new alleles, but I think the main reason is not mutation but selection or heterozygote advantage.

Option G: Heterozygous show no symptoms. That's correct, but how does that preserve the allele? Because carriers can pass the allele without getting the disease themselves. So the allele stays in the population because carriers are healthy but can pass the recessive allele. So even if homozygous individuals die, the carriers keep the gene alive.

Option H: The gene provides resistance to another disease. I think I've heard this before. Like sickle cell anemia protects against malaria. Maybe Tay-Sachs carriers have some advantage. But wait, is this about the recessive allele or the heterozygous state? Oh, in sickle cell, it's the heterozygotes that have the advantage. So if the Tay-Sachs allele gives resistance when you're a carrier, that would help. But I'm not sure if that's the case for Tay-Sachs. I think in some cases, maybe the recessive allele has a different effect.

Wait, I should recall. Tay-Sachs is a lysosomal storage disease. Oh, wait, I think that in the case of Tay-Sachs, it's the carriers (heterozygotes) who might have some resistance to certain infections, like maybe tuberculosis. So if that's true, then the allele is maintained because being a carrier offers some advantage, balancing the disadvantage when homozygous.

So looking back at the options, if H says the gene provides resistance, that would explain it. So H would be the correct answer.

Wait, but option G says heterozygotes show no symptoms. That's also true, but that alone doesn't explain why the allele persists. Because even if carriers are healthy, if they don't have any advantage, the allele could still decrease. So the key is that the carriers have some sort of advantage. So either G is part of the story but not the whole reason, or H is the reason.

So the question is, is the allele preserved because carriers are resistant to another disease (H), or because carriers are just healthy but not necessarily more fit (G)?

So the main point is that carriers (het) are not affected, so they can pass the allele. But if the allele is harmful when homozygous, why isn't it selected against? Because if the het has some advantage, like resistance, it's maintained in the population.

Wait, but without any advantage, the allele would still be present because it's recessive. Let me think about Hardy-Weinberg. The frequency of recessive alleles can stay in the population if the heterozygote has some advantage. Or in the absence of selection, the allele could persist but at lower frequencies. But the question states that the disease is preserved, implying it's maintained at a higher frequency than expected.

So in the absence of any advantage, the allele would decrease because affected individuals don't reproduce. But in reality, Tay-Sachs is more common in certain populations, like Ashkenazi Jews. So there must be a reason it's maintained.

I think the answer is H: the gene provides resistance to another disease.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to remember. I think that for Tay-Sachs, carriers (heterozygotes) have some resistance to tuberculosis. So when the heterozygote has an advantage, it's called heterozygote advantage, and that maintains the allele in the population despite the homozygous condition being bad.

So in that case, the correct answer would be H.

But looking back at the options, option G says heterozygotes show no symptoms. That's correct because they don't have the disease. But that doesn't explain why the allele is preserved. It only explains why it's not immediately removed. But if the allele doesn't offer any advantage, then over time, the allele would become less common as people who are heterozygous don't have the disease and can pass it, but if their children happen to get two copies, they die. But in populations where the disease is common, like Ashkenazi Jews, it's because of a founder effect, but also possibly because of heterozygote advantage. So the point is that the carriers are somehow better off, making the allele stay in the gene pool.

So the correct answer should be H because the allele provides resistance to another disease, which is the case for Tay-Sachs. Thus, the presence of the recessive allele is maintained because the heterozygotes have a survival advantage.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option G says that heterozygotes show no symptoms, which is true. But the question is why is the allele preserved. So option G is a fact but doesn't explain preservation. The correct reason for preservation is that carriers have an advantage, which is option H.

So the answer should be H.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Another possibility is option G is correct because carriers can pass the allele without being affected. But that alone would mean the allele is carried but not necessarily maintained at any particular frequency. So without some form of selection, the allele would likely decrease because affected individuals die without passing it on. But if the carriers have an advantage, the allele is maintained despite some individuals being affected.

So the correct reasoning is that the allele is maintained because heterozygotes have an advantage, which would be option H.

Tay-Sachs is a genetic disorder caused by a recessive allele, and individuals with the disease (homozygous recessive) typically do not survive long enough to reproduce. However, the allele is preserved in the population due to the phenomenon of heterozygote advantage. Carriers (heterozygous individuals) do not exhibit symptoms of the disease, but they are known to have an increased resistance to other diseases, such as tuberculosis. This selective advantage ensures that the allele remains in the population despite the severe consequences for homozygous individuals. 

Among the options provided, the most accurate explanation is that the gene for Tay-Sachs also provides resistance to another disease, which aligns with the concept of heterozygote advantage.
