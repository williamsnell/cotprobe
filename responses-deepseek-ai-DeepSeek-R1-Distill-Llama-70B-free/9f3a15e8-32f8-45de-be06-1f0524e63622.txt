Okay, so I have this EPR question here about dimethylnitroxide, (CH3)2NO•. I'm a bit rusty on EPR, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

EPR stands for Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, right? It's used to study species with unpaired electrons, like free radicals. The spectrum gives information about the environment around the unpaired electron, especially the nuclei that have a spin and are nearby.

The question asks about the number of lines in the EPR spectrum. I remember that the number of lines depends on the neighboring nuclei and their spin states. So this is probably a splitting due to hyperfine interaction.

I think the formula for the number of lines is (n + 1) multiplied by the number of equivalent nuclei. Wait, no, more accurately, for each set of equivalent nuclei, the number of lines is (nI + 1), where I is the spin quantum number of the nucleus, and n is the number of equivalent nuclei.

So dimethylnitroxide has the structure where the NO• is connected to two methyl groups. Let's draw it mentally: the nitrogen is in the center, double-bonded to an oxygen, and single-bonded to two methyl groups. The unpaired electron is on the nitrogen, I believe.

Nitrogen has a spin I of 1. Wait, no. Wait, the common isotopes... Oh right! The most abundant isotope of nitrogen is ^14N, which has a nuclear spin I of 1. Because for ^14N, the nucleus has a spin of 1. So that's important.

So the unpaired electron is on the nitrogen atom. The adjacent nuclei are the two methyl groups attached to it. Each methyl group has three protons, but wait, the structure is (CH3)2NO•, so the NO is connected to two CH3 groups. So each CH3 is attached to the nitrogen. So the methyl groups are directly bonded to the nitrogen.

Wait, but for EPR, the hyperfine splitting comes from nuclei that are coupled to the unpaired electron. So the only nucleus contributing here is the ^14N, because the protons (from the CH3 groups) are farther away and might not contribute much, or maybe they are not in an equivalent position.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The unpaired electron is on the nitrogen. So the nitrogen's nuclear spin would cause hyperfine splitting. But what about the nearby protons? Are they coupled to the electron? I think that in such nitroxide radicals, the electron is localized on the nitrogen, and the protons are on the adjacent methyl groups. So perhaps the protons are in a position where they are not coupled strongly. Or maybe in the case of dimethylnitroxide, the protons on the methyl groups are equivalent and may cause splitting as well.

Wait, but in some cases, when the protons are all equivalent, their splitting can lead to a certain number of lines. So maybe I should calculate the splitting from both the nitrogen and the protons.

But wait, the question is about the EPR spectrum assuming lines do not overlap. So I need to consider all hyperfine interactions that split the lines.

So let me break it down.

First, the nitrogen (I=1) is directly bonded to the unpaired electron. So the electron's spin will couple with the nitrogen's nuclear spin, leading to hyperfine splitting.

Each equivalent set of nuclei adds a multiplicative factor to the total number of lines. So if there are two sets of nuclei, the total number is the product of each (nI +1) for each set.

Wait, but wait—each set of equivalent nuclei contributes a (n_i * I_i + 1) factor multiplied together.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify. For each set of equivalent nuclei, the number of lines is multiplied by (nI +1), where n is the number of equivalent nuclei with spin I.

Alternatively, another approach: when multiple nuclei are present, the total number of lines is the product of the (number of lines each nucleus contributes). But that's only when the nuclei are non-equivalent and independent. If they are equivalent, the formula is different.

I think the general formula for the number of EPR lines is given by the product of (n_i * I_i + 1) for each type i of nuclei. But I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that each set of equivalent nuclei contributes a (n_i * (I_i) +1) to the total number of lines, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of coupling. The main splitting is from the nitrogen's I=1. Then, any equivalent protons would contribute additional splitting.

Let me think about each contributing nucleus.

1. Nitrogen atom: I=1, and there's only one such nucleus. So the number of lines from this would be (1 * 1 + 1) = 2? Wait, no, that's not right. Because the formula is (2I + 1) for the number of possible m_I states when considering hyperfine splitting. So for I=1, there are 2I +1 = 3 possible states (m_I = -1, 0, +1). So the nitrogen would split each line into 3, leading to 3 lines. But wait, that's not the case when the multiplicity comes from multiple nuclei.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how the hyperfine structure works. Each nucleus with spin I will split each line into (2I +1) lines. But if there are multiple equivalent nuclei, the splitting can be more complex.

Wait, here's a better way. The total number of lines is the product of (2I_i + 1) for each type of nucleus, but only if the nuclei are of different types. If there are multiple equivalent nuclei of the same type, the formula is different.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. For each nucleus with spin I, the number of hyperfine lines is (2I +1). If you have multiple equivalent nuclei, the situation is more complicated. For example, for n equivalent nuclei each with I=1/2, the number of lines would be n + 1. But wait, that's for the case where each nucleus has I=1/2, and you have n equivalent nuclei. So for each coupling, you have (n + 1) lines, but that's perhaps when they're equivalent and each has I=1/2.

Wait, maybe the general approach is to consider each nucleus's contribution, whether equivalent or not. So in dimethylnitroxide, the nearby nuclei are:

- One nitrogen (I=1)
- Two methyl groups (each CH3 has three protons, but are the protons equivalent?).

Wait, the protons on each methyl group are equivalent, and the two methyl groups are equivalent because the molecule is symmetric. So in total, there are 6 protons, but all are equivalent in terms of their environment around the NO• group.

Wait, but wait, each methyl group is attached to the nitrogen. So the two CH3 groups are equivalent because of the molecule's symmetry. So the six protons are split into two equivalent sets? Or are all six equivalent?

Hmm, perhaps all six protons are equivalent in terms of their hyperfine coupling to the unpaired electron on the nitrogen. Because the molecule is symmetric, so each proton experiences the same environment. So they are all equivalent.

So for the protons, each has I = 1/2, and there are 6 equivalent nuclei.

So the hyperfine splitting from the protons would be (n * (I) +1) = (6 * 1/2 + 1) = 4? Wait, no, that's not the correct approach.

Wait, I think for n equivalent nuclei each with spin I, the number of lines is (2nI + 1). But that's only when the nuclei are equivalent and their spins are coupled. Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Wait, another approach: for each nucleus, the hyperfine interaction leads to splitting. When you have multiple nuclei, the total splitting is the product of each individual splitting.

But when nuclei are equivalent, the combined effect is a bit more involved.

Wait, when two nuclei are equivalent and each has spin I, the number of lines is (2I +1) for each, but because they are equivalent, the total number is (nI +1), where n is the number of equivalent nuclei. Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

I think the correct approach is to calculate the number of lines contributed by each type of nucleus and then multiply them together.

So, the first nucleus is the nitrogen (I=1), which is a single nucleus. So the number of lines from this would be (2I +1) = 3 lines.

Then, the protons. There are six protons, all equivalent, each with I=1/2. So how does that affect the splitting?

Wait, for n equivalent nuclei each with I=1/2, the number of lines is (n + 1). So six protons would contribute (6 +1) =7 lines.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. For each equivalent set, the formula is (2I*n +1) or (n*(2I) +1)? No, perhaps it's different.

Wait, wait, for n equivalent nuclei each with I=1/2, the multiplicity is (n + 1). So for 6 equivalent protons, the number of lines would be (6 +1) =7.

But wait, that's when the nuclei are all coupled to the same electron, right? So each additional proton would add a splitting, but since they're all equivalent, the number of possible states is (n +1). So yes, 6+1=7.

So, the total number of lines would be the product of the lines from each type of nucleus. So nitrogen contributes 3 lines, and protons contribute 7 lines.

So 3 *7=21 lines.

Wait, but isn't the multiplicative approach only when the nuclei are of different types? Because if the nuclei are the same type (like all protons), then the splitting is additive in a certain way. But in this case, the nitrogen and the protons are different types, so their contributions multiply.

So the total number of lines is 3 *7=21. So the answer would be option C:21.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes, when the hyperfine couplings are small, the lines might not split further. But the question says lines do not overlap, so all possible splits are considered.

So, to recap:

- Nitrogen (I=1): contributes 3 lines (m_I = -1, 0, +1)
- 6 equivalent protons (I=1/2 each): contribute 7 lines (since 6+1=7)
Total lines: 3 *7=21.

So the correct answer is C:21.

To predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of dimethylnitroxide ((CH₃)₂NO•), we analyze the hyperfine interactions caused by the nuclei coupled to the unpaired electron. The unpaired electron is localized on the nitrogen atom, and the nearby nuclei contributing to the splitting are:

1. **Nitrogen (¹⁴N):** The most abundant isotope of nitrogen, ¹⁴N, has a nuclear spin quantum number \( I = 1 \). This results in \( 2I + 1 = 3 \) possible hyperfine states (\( m_I = -1, 0, +1 \)).

2. **Protons (¹H):** The two methyl groups attached to the nitrogen each contain three equivalent protons. Since the molecule is symmetric, all six protons are equivalent. For \( n \) equivalent nuclei with \( I = 1/2 \), the number of hyperfine lines is given by \( n + 1 \). Thus, the six equivalent protons contribute \( 6 + 1 = 7 \) lines.

The total number of lines in the EPR spectrum is the product of the contributions from the nitrogen and the protons, as they are independent and non-overlapping:

\[
\text{Total lines} = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

Thus, the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of dimethylnitroxide is **21**.
