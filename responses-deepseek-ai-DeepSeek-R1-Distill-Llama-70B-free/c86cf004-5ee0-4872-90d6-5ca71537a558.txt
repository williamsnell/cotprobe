Okay, so I have this question here about the letters on the '3' button of a touch-tone telephone. Hmm, I remember that old telephones have these buttons with numbers and letters, right? Each number corresponds to certain letters. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact arrangement. Let me think.

I think the phone keypad is set up in a specific way where each number from 2 to 9 has a set of letters. Like, for example, the 2 button has ABC, 3 has DEF, 4 has GHI, and so on. Wait, no, that might not be right. Or was it the other way around? I remember that 1 usually doesn't have any letters, and then 2 starts with A, B, C. So 2 is ABC, 3 is DEF, 4 is GHI, 5 is JKL, 6 is MNO, 7 is PQRS, 8 is TUV, and 9 is WXYZ. Oh wait, but the question is about the 3 button. So if 2 is ABC, 3 must be DEF. 

Looking at the options, option H is DEF. Let me double-check. The options are A through J. Option H says DEF, which matches what I was thinking. So the letters on the 3 button should be D, E, F. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I mix up the order. Let me try to visualize the phone keypad. The first row is usually 1, then 2 (ABC), 3 (DEF), 4 (GHI), then 5 (JKL), 6 (MNO), 7 (PQRS), 8 (TUV), 9 (WXYZ), and 0. Yeah, that seems right. So 3 is definitely DEF. 

So the correct answer should be option H: DEF.
