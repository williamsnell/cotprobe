Okay, so I have this question about Hobbes's view on what it means to say something is good. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that Hobbes was a philosopher who focused a lot on human nature and the social contract. He's known for his book Leviathan, right? In that, he talks about the state of nature and how life without government would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." So, he probably has a pragmatic view on good and bad.

Wait, the question is about what Hobbes thinks when someone says something is good. I recall that he had a subjectivist view of good and evil. I think he believed that good and evil are based on human desires. Like, good is what people desire, and evil is what they avoid.

So, when someone says something is good, they're expressing their own desire for it. It's not about some objective moral standard or what's best for society. It's more about individual preference. For example, if I say chocolate is good, it's because I desire it, not because it's inherently good.

Looking at the options, option F says "you desire it." That sounds right because Hobbes would probably say that calling something good is just stating that the speaker desires it. It's a first-person perspective, not a universal truth.

Other options don't fit as well. Option E says it's universally desired, but Hobbes might not go that far because desires can vary. Option C talks about human happiness, but I think that's more from utilitarianism, which came later with people like Bentham or Mill. Option A is about natural law, which I associate more with someone like Locke or Aquinas, not Hobbes.

So putting it all together, the answer should be F.

In Hobbes's view, to say something is good is to express that you desire it. He held a subjectivist perspective, where good and evil are determined by individual desires rather than objective standards. This aligns with option F: "you desire it."

Answer: F
