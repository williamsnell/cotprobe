Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a charged oil drop between two plates of a parallel-plate capacitor. Hmm, I remember that in such problems, the electric field plays a key role. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the oil drop has a mass of 2.5e-4 grams. Wait, grams? Oh right, that's 2.5 times 10 to the power of -4 grams. I need to convert that into kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kg. So 1 gram is 0.001 kg, so 2.5e-4 grams is 2.5e-7 kg. Got that.

The plates each have an area of 175 cm². Oh, I should convert that to m² because the formulas use meters. 1 cm² is 1e-4 m², so 175 cm² is 175e-4 m², which is 1.75e-2 m². Okay.

The charge on the upper plate is 4.5e-7 C, and the lower plate has an equal negative charge. Wait, so the upper plate is positive, lower is negative, same magnitude. The drop remains stationary, which means it's in equilibrium. So the forces acting on it must balance out.

When the drop is stationary, the electric force must balance the gravitational force. So the electric force equals the weight of the drop. The electric force is qE, where q is the charge on the drop, and E is the electric field between the plates.

I need to find E first. For a parallel plate capacitor, the electric field E is given by sigma/epsilon_0, where sigma is the surface charge density. Alternatively, it's E = V/d, but since I don't have the potential V or the separation d, maybe using sigma is better.

Surface charge density sigma is charge per unit area. The charge on each plate is 4.5e-7 C, and the area is 1.75e-2 m². So sigma = Q/A = (4.5e-7 C) / (1.75e-2 m²). Let me calculate that. 4.5e-7 divided by 1.75e-2. Let's see, 4.5 /1.75 is approximately 2.571, and 10^-7 /10^-2 is 10^-5. So sigma is about 2.571e-5 C/m².

Then E is sigma / epsilon_0. Epsilon_0 is 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²). So E = (2.571e-5) / (8.85e-12) ≈ let's compute that. 2.571e-5 divided by 8.85e-12 is approximately (2.571 / 8.85) * 1e7. 2.571 /8.85 is about 0.29, so 0.29e7 is 2.9e6 N/C. Hmm, wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait 2.571e-5 divided by 8.85e-12 is (2.571 /8.85) ) * (1e-5 / 1e-12) )= (0.29) * (1e7) )= 2.9e6 N/C. Yeah, that's right.

Now, the electric force on the drop is qE upwards, and the gravitational force is mg downwards. Since the drop is stationary, qE = mg.

So solving for q: q = mg / E.

Mass m is 2.5e-7 kg. g is 9.8 m/s². So mg = (2.5e-7 kg)(9.8 m/s²) = 2.45e-6 N.

Wait, 2.5e-7 *9.8 is 2.45e-6? Let me check: 2.5 *9.8 is 24.5, so 24.5e-7 = 2.45e-6 N. Yeah.

E is 2.9e6 N/C. So q = 2.45e-6 / 2.9e6 ≈ (2.45/2.9) * 1e-12. Wait, wait, 2.45e-6 divided by 2.9e6 is (2.45/2.9) * 1e-12, because 1e-6 /1e6 is 1e-12.

2.45 divided by 2.9 is approximately 0.845. So 0.845e-12 C, which is 8.45e-13 C. Hmm, but looking at the options, let me see.

Wait the options are:

A: 6.25 ×10^13 C

B:5.67e-14

C:4.00e-13

D:7.45e13

E:3.14e-13

F:9.98e13

G:2.21e-13

H:8.43e13

I:9.11e-14

J:1.12e-13

Wait, so my calculation gives 8.45e-13 C. Looking for that. Option H is 8.43e13, but that's 1e13, which is way bigger than my result. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculation. Because 2.45e-6 divided by 2.9e6 is:

2.45e-6 / 2.9e6 = (2.45 / 2.9) * 1e-12. Because 1e-6 /1e6 = 1e-12.

Yes, so 0.845 *1e-12 is 8.45e-13 C.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match 8.45e-13. The closest option is option C:4.00e-13, but that's half of my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate sigma and E.

Sigma = Q/A = (4.5e-7 C) / (175e-4 m²). 175e-4 is 0.0175 m². So 4.5e-7 / 0.0175 = (4.5 / 0.0175 )e-7. 4.5 /0.0175 is 257.142... So sigma is 2.5714e-5 C/m².

E = sigma / epsilon_0 = 2.5714e-5 / 8.85e-12.

Let me compute that accurately.

2.5714e-5 / 8.85e-12 = (2.5714 / 8.85) * 1e7.

2.5714 divided by 8.85 is approximately 0.2903.

So 0.2903 *1e7 = 2.903e6 N/C. So E is about 2.903e6 N/C.

Now, q = mg / E.

m=2.5e-7 kg, g=9.8, so mg=2.45e-6 N.

E is 2.903e6 N/C.

So q = 2.45e-6 / 2.903e6 = (2.45 /2.903) * 1e-12.

2.45 /2.903 is approximately 0.844. So 0.844e-12 C =8.44e-13 C.

Hmm, so around 8.44e-13 C. Looking at the options, none of the C options are exactly that. Let me look again.

Ah, option H is 8.43e13 C, but that's 1e13, which is way larger. Oh, wait no, perhaps a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the mass was given as 2.5e-4 g, which is 2.5e-7 kg. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the electric field. Let me think again. Electric field between the plates is sigma / epsilon0.

Sigma = Q/(A), where A is the area. Wait, the plates are charged to Q and -Q, so each has charge of 4.5e-7 C. Yes.

Wait, maybe another approach: since E = (sigma)/epsilon0, and sigma is Q/A. So E = Q/(A epsilon0). Let me compute that.

Q is 4.5e-7 C.

A is 175 cm² = 0.0175 m².

E = 4.5e-7 / (0.0175 *8.85e-12 )

Wait, no, E = (4.5e-7) / (0.0175) / (8.85e-12 )

Wait, no, E = (4.5e-7 / 0.0175) / (8.85e-12 )

So 4.5e-7 /0.0175 = (4.5 / 0.0175) *1e-7.

4.5 /0.0175 = 257.142857. So 257.142857e-7 = 2.57142857e-5 C/m².

Then E = 2.57142857e-5 / 8.85e-12 = 2.57142857e-5 / 8.85e-12.

Which is (2.57142857 /8.85 ) * 1e7. 2.5714/8.85 is approximately 0.2903, so 0.2903e7=2.903e6 N/C.

Same result as before.

So q = (mg)/E = (2.5e-7 kg *9.8 m/s² ) / (2.903e6 N/C)

Compute numerator: 2.5e-7 *9.8 = 2.45e-6 N.

Divide by 2.903e6: 2.45e-6 / 2.903e6 = (2.45 / 2.903) * 1e-12.

2.45 / 2.903 is approximately 0.844, so 0.844e-12 =8.44e-13 C.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H:8.43e13 C. Wait, no, that's 8.43 times 1e13, which is way larger. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of q.

Wait, when I compute 2.45e-6 divided by 2.903e6, the exponents are 1e-6 /1e6 =1e-12. So the result is (2.45/2.903 )e-12 = 0.844e-12 =8.44e-13 C.

Looking at the options, option H is 8.43e13, which is 8.43e13 C, but that's 1e13, which is way larger. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E. Let me think again. E is sigma/epsilon0. Sigma is Q/A.

Q is 4.5e-7 C. A is 0.0175 m². So sigma is 4.5e-7 / 0.0175 = 2.5714e-5 C/m².

E = 2.5714e-5 / 8.85e-12 = (2.5714 /8.85 ) *1e7 = 0.2903 *1e7 =2.903e6 N/C.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the way the charge is considered. Oh wait, the drop is between the plates, so the electric field is uniform. The drop's charge will experience a force qE. But the direction depends on the sign of q. Since the plates are + and -, the field direction is from upper to lower plate. So if the drop is positive, it will be pushed downward. To balance gravity, which is downward, the electric force must be upward, so the drop must have a negative charge, so the electric force is upward.

Wait, no, because the problem states the drop remains stationary. So the forces must balance. The gravitational force is mg downward. The electric force must be upward, so qE must be upward. So the electric field is from upper (+) to lower (-), so the force on a positive charge would be downward, same as gravity. That wouldn't balance. Therefore, the drop must have a negative charge so that the electric force is upward.

Wait, but in our calculation, q could be positive or negative. But the magnitude is 8.44e-13 C. So the charge is negative, but the options don't indicate the sign, just the magnitude. So the magnitude is about 8.44e-13 C.

Looking again at the options, none of them have that. So maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait the options are:

A:6.25e13

B:5.67e-14

C:4.00e-13

D:7.45e13

E:3.14e-13

F:9.98e13

G:2.21e-13

H:8.43e13

I:9.11e-14

J:1.12e-13

Hmm, so none match 8.44e-13. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E.

Wait, another approach: the electric field between the plates is E = (2 * sigma)/epsilon_0? No, wait, for a parallel plate capacitor with charge +Q and -Q, the electric field is sigma/epsilon0, where sigma is Q/A.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the field is E = (sigma)/epsilon0 *2? No, no, no. No, each plate contributes to the field, but when you have a parallel plate capacitor, the field between the plates is E = sigma / epsilon0. Because each plate contributes E = sigma/(2 epsilon0), but together they add up to E = sigma/epsilon0. So no, I think my calculation was correct.

Wait, perhaps the area was miscalculated. The area is 175 cm². Oh wait, 1 m² is (100 cm)^2 = 1e4 cm². So 175 cm² is 175 /1e4 = 0.0175 m². So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I got the mass wrong. Oh wait, the mass is 2.5e-4 grams. 1e-3 grams is a milligram. So 2.5e-4 grams is 0.25 milligrams. To convert to kg, 2.5e-4 grams = 2.5e-7 kg. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the way I calculated q. Let me compute mg/E again.

mg = 2.5e-7 kg *9.8 m/s² = 2.45e-6 N.

E=2.903e6 N/C.

q= (2.45e-6) / (2.903e6) = (2.45 / 2.903 ) * 1e-12.

2.45 /2.903 is approximately 0.844, so 0.844e-12 =8.44e-13 C.

So the charge is about 8.44e-13 C. Looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate E using another method. Another formula for electric field in a parallel plate capacitor is E = V/d, but without knowing V or d, that's not helpful. Alternatively, using Q = C V. But without d, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the electric field using E = (Q/(epsilon0 A)) * 2? No, wait, no.

Wait, another thought: the electric field due to a single charged plate is E = sigma/(2 epsilon0). So for two plates, opposite charges, the fields add up, so E between them is sigma/(epsilon0). So my initial approach was correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me try calculating E again, more precisely. Let's compute sigma:

sigma = Q/A = (4.5e-7 C) / (0.0175 m²) = 4.5e-7 / 0.0175.

Calculating that:

4.5e-7 / 0.0175 = (4.5 / 0.0175) *1e-7.

4.5 /0.0175 = (4.5 * 1000 ) /17.5 = 4500 / 17.5.

Let me compute that: 17.5 * 257 = 4492.5. So 257.

So 4.5e-7 /0.0175 = 257e-7 = 2.57e-5 C/m².

E = sigma / epsilon0 = 2.57e-5 / 8.85e-12.

Compute that:

2.57e-5 /8.85e-12 = (2.57 /8.85 ) * 1e7.

2.57 /8.85 = approximately 0.2903.

So 0.2903e7 = 2.903e6 N/C.

Now, q = (2.5e-7 kg *9.8 )/(2.903e6) = (2.45e-6) / (2.903e6) = (2.45 /2.903 ) * 1e-12.

2.45 /2.903 is approximately 0.844, so q ≈8.44e-13 C.

Looking again at the options, perhaps I missed something. Oh wait, option H is 8.43e13 C, but that's 1e13. That's a big number, way off. None of the other options are close to 8.44e-13. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of E. Let me try doing the division more accurately.

sigma =4.5e-7 / 0.0175.

Compute 4.5e-7 / 0.
