Okay, so I have this physics problem about calculating the electrostatic force between two charged particles. Hmm, I remember that electrostatic force is related to Coulomb's Law. Let me think about what I learned.

Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². Oh right, k is Coulomb's constant, which I think is 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². 

Wait, the charges here are given as +3.00e-6 C and -1.50e-6 C. Oh, but the force's magnitude depends on the absolute values, so the signs don't matter for the calculation, just the magnitude. So I can just take their absolute values.

The distance is 12.0 cm. Oh wait, I need to convert that to meters because the units in k are in meters. So 12 cm is 0.12 meters. Got it.

Putting it all together. Let's plug in the numbers. So F = (8.988e9) * (3e-6) * (1.5e-6) / (0.12)^2. Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, multiply the charges: 3e-6 * 1.5e-6. 3 times 1.5 is 4.5, and 1e-6 times 1e-6 is 1e-12. So that part is 4.5e-12.

Then, the denominator is (0.12)^2. 0.12 squared is 0.0144. So now, F = (8.988e9) * (4.5e-12) / 0.0144.

Let me compute the numerator first: 8.988e9 multiplied by 4.5e-12. 8.988 *4.5 is approximately, let's see, 8 *4.5 is 36, 0.988 *4.5 is about 4.446. So total around 40.446. But wait, 8.988 *4.5: 8 *4=32, 8*0.5=4; 0.988*4=3.952, 0.988*0.5=0.494. Hmm, maybe it's easier to calculate 8.988 *4.5. Let's do it: 4.5 *8 is 36, 0.988 *4.5 is 4.446. So 36 +4.446 is 40.446. So that's 40.446e (9-12) = 40.446e-3, which is the same as 0.040446.

Now divide this by 0.0144. So 0.040446 / 0.0144. Let me compute that. 0.04 is 4e-2, 0.0144 is 1.44e-2. So 4 / 1.44 is approximately 2.777... So 0.040446 / 0.0144 is approximately 2.807 N.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's do exact numbers.

Compute 8.988e9 * 3e-6 *1.5e-6 / (0.12)^2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *3e-6= 8.988e9 *3e-6 = 8.988 *3 *1e3 = 26.964e3 = 26964.

Then 26964 * 1.5e-6 = 26964 *1.5 = 40446; 40446e-6=40.446.

Denominator: 0.12^2=0.0144. So F=40.446 /0.0144.

Compute 40.446 /0.0144. Let me write it as 40446e-3 / 1.44e-2 = (40446 / 1.44) * (1e-3 / 1e-2) )= (28072. something) * 0.1.

Wait no, 40.446 /0.0144 = (40.446 * 1000) / (14.4) ) = 40446 /14.4.

Compute 40446 ÷14.4. Let's see:

14.4 * 2800 = 14.4 *2800= 40320. 40446-40320=126. So 2800 and 126/14.4.

126 ÷14.4 = 8.75. So total is 2808.75.

So 2808.75? Wait, that can't be right—wait, no, wait, because 40.446 is 40.446 N? No, no. Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's recompute. Let's write out all the exponents correctly.

F = (8.988e9) * (3e-6) * (1.5e-6) / (0.12)^2.

Let's compute each term:

8.988e9 = 8.988 x10^9

3e-6 is 3 x10^-6

1.5e-6 is 1.5 x10^-6

Multiply the constants: 8.988 *3*1.5 = 8.988 *4.5 = let's calculate that.

8 *4.5=36, 0.988 *4.5= about 4.446, so total 40.446.

Exponents: 10^9 *10^-6 *10^-6 = 10^(9-6-6)=10^-3.

So the numerator is 40.446e-3.

Denominator: (0.12)^2 =0.0144, which is 1.44e-2.

So F = (40.446e-3) / (1.44e-2) )= (40.446 /1.44 ) * (1e-3 /1e-2 )

40.446 /1.44 is approx 28.08.

1e-3 /1e-2 = 0.1.

So 28.08 *0.1 = 2.808 N.

So approximately 2.81 Newtons.

Looking at the options, option H is 2.81 N. So the answer should be H.

To calculate the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two charged particles, we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

### Given:
- \( q_1 = +3.00 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \)
- \( q_2 = -1.50 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \)
- \( r = 12.0 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.12 \, \mathrm{m} \)
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N·m^2/C^2} \)

### Step 1: Compute the product of the charges
\[
|q_1 \cdot q_2| = (3.00 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (1.50 \times 10^{-6}) = 4.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C^2}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the square of the distance
\[
r^2 = (0.12)^2 = 0.0144 \, \mathrm{m^2}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute into Coulomb's Law
\[
F = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.5 \times 10^{-12})}{0.0144}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.5 \times 10^{-12}) = 40.446 \times 10^{-3} = 0.040446 \, \mathrm{N·m^2}
\]

Now divide by the denominator:
\[
F = \frac{0.040446}{0.0144} \approx 2.808 \, \mathrm{N}
\]

### Final Answer:
The magnitude of the electrostatic force is approximately **2.81 N**, which corresponds to option **H**.
