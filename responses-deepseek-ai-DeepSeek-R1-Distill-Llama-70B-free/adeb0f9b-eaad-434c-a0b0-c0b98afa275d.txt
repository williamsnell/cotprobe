Question:

 Which of the following is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child?

Options:

A: The potential for genetic abnormalities is not a valid argument against SCNT.

C: The argument falsely assumes that SCNT individuals would have a lesser quality of life.
D: The argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism.
E: The argument fails to take into account the rights and autonomy of the parents.
F: The argument neglects the emotional and psychological well-being of the child.
G: People's prejudicial attitudes are likely to change.
H: SCNT could potentially lead to advancements in medical research and treatment.
I: The argument ignores the potential benefits of SCNT to society.
J: If people's prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about SCNT and Pence's objections. Hmm, I remember SCNT stands for Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer, which is a cloning technique. The question is asking which option is NOT an objection Pence raises against the argument that SCNT isn't best for the child.

Wait, the question is about identifying which option is not an objection. So, I need to think about what Pence's arguments against the anti-SCNT stance are.

I think Pence argues against the claim that SCNT is bad because it's not in the best interest of the child. So, the arguments against that would be pointing out flaws in the reasoning.

I remember that one of Pence's points is that the argument assumes genetic determinism or reductionism. Like, it's saying that a clone's life would be worse because people might treat them differently based on their genetics, but Pence argues that's not necessarily the case. So that's one of his objections.

Another point I think he makes is about the expectations placed on SCNT individuals. He might say that the expectations aren't worse than those placed on sexually created children. Like, maybe people have high expectations for their kids regardless, so that part isn't a unique problem for clones.

He also might argue that the quality of life assumption is wrong. The anti-SCNT argument claims that clones would have a lesser quality of life, but Pence says that's a false assumption.

Oh, and I think he brings up that people's prejudicial attitudes might change over time. So if society stops being prejudiced, then the problem goes away. That's another point he uses against the objection.

Wait, but the options are from A to J. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Potential for genetic abnormalities isn't valid. I'm not sure if Pence addresses this. I think genetic issues are more about safety concerns, but maybe not directly related to the "best for the child" argument in the way the question is framed.

Option B: Expectations could be no worse than normal. That sounds like what I was thinking earlier. So this is one of Pence's objections.

Option C: Argument assumes lesser quality of life. So Pence says that's a false assumption. So this is an objection.

Option D: Assumes genetic determinism. Yes, this is definitely one of his points.

Option E: Fails to consider parents' rights. I'm not sure. I think some ethicists talk about parental autonomy, but I'm not certain if Pence uses this as an objection in this context.

Option F: Neglects emotional well-being. Hmm, not sure. The original argument is about the child's best interest, so maybe the objection is that it does consider emotional well-being.

Wait, no, actually, if the argument is that SCNT is bad because of the child's emotional well-being, then Pence would argue against that. Alternatively, maybe the argument neglects it, but I'm not sure.

Option G: People's attitudes will change. Yes, this is one of his points. So this is an objection he makes.

Option H: SCNT could lead to medical advancements. I think this is more of a separate argument in favor of SCNT, not directly an objection to the "best for child" argument.

Option I: Ignores benefits to society. Similar to H, this is about the benefits, not directly countering the best interest argument.

Option J: If attitudes don't change, we shouldn't allow SCNT. This seems like the opposite of G. If J is saying that we shouldn't allow it if people are prejudiced, then Pence might argue against that. Or maybe Pence argues that even if attitudes don't change, it's not a reason to ban SCNT.

Wait, the original question is which is NOT an objection. So, looking back, the options are the objections Pence gives. So the one that is not an objection would be something he doesn't argue against.

Option E says the argument fails to consider parents' rights. I'm trying to remember if Pence brings up parental rights as a counter. I think his main points are about the social and psychological aspects, not so much parental autonomy. So maybe E is not one of his objections.

Alternatively, maybe option E is not an objection he raises. So the question is which is NOT an objection, meaning it's not something Pence uses against the argument.

Wait, the question is about which option is not an objection Pence gives. So the correct answer would be the option that is not listed as one of his arguments against the anti-SCNT position.

So, if the answer is E, that would mean that failing to consider parents' rights is not an objection Pence makes. If he doesn't mention that, then E is the correct answer.

Alternatively, let me think again. The main objections I remember are:

1. The argument assumes genetic determinism (D)
2. The expectations aren't worse than normal (B)
3. The quality of life assumption is false (C)
4. People's attitudes might change (G)

So, options B, C, D, G are objections he raises.

Options A, E, F, H, I, J are either other points or not related.

Option J says if attitudes don't change, we shouldn't allow SCNT. I think Pence argues against this, saying that we shouldn't ban it just because of possible prejudice. So J is an argument someone else might make, but Pence would object to that. So J is not an objection he gives; rather, he argues against J.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is which is NOT an objection. So the options are what Pence is objecting to. So, if J is something he says is an invalid argument, then J is an objection he gives. Or perhaps not.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to clarify.

The question is about which option is NOT an objection that Pence gives. So, which option is not something Pence argues against.

Wait, no. The question is, "Which of the following is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child?"

So, the argument is "SCNT is not best for the child." Pence is objecting to this argument, so his objections are pointing out flaws in that argument.

So, the options are possible objections, and we need to choose which one is not among them.

From my notes, Pence's objections include:

- The argument assumes genetic determinism (D)
- The expectations aren't worse (B)
- The quality of life is falsely assumed (C)
- People's attitudes may change (G)
- That the argument neglects the benefits to society (I think H and I are about benefits, but maybe I is about society benefits)
Wait, option I says the argument ignores potential benefits to society. So perhaps Pence argues that the anti-SCNT argument doesn't consider the broader societal benefits, thus making it an objection.

Wait, but the main focus of the argument is on the child's best interest. So maybe the societal benefits (I) are a separate point, not directly an objection to the best interest argument. So perhaps I is not an objection he gives in this context.

Alternatively, maybe he does bring up that the argument against SCNT ignores the benefits, thus making it a flawed argument.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's see.

So, the options that are likely to be Pence's objections are B, C, D, G, I, and perhaps E. Options A, F, H, J are possibilities for not being objections.

So, the question is which is NOT an objection.

Wait, the original argument is that SCNT is not best for the child, perhaps because of psychological issues, genetic problems, etc.

Pence's objections would counter each of these points.

So, for example:

- If the argument is that SCNT children would face undue expectations, Pence would say that's no worse than normal (B).
- If the argument is that clones would have lesser quality of life, Pence says that's a false assumption (C).
- If the argument assumes that genes determine everything, Pence says that's genetic determinism (D).
- If the argument is based on people's prejudice, Pence says attitudes may change (G).
- If the argument ignores the benefits, like medical advancements, Pence points that out (H, I).

Wait, but the original question is about the argument that SCNT is not best for the child, so maybe the objections are about the child's welfare, not about societal benefits. So perhaps H and I are not directly about the child's best interest, but about other benefits.

So, the options that are objections related to the child's welfare would be B, C, D, E, F, G.

Wait, but H is about medical research, which is a benefit to society, not directly to the child. So, if the argument is that SCNT isn't best for the child, then pointing out societal benefits is not directly addressing the child's best interest. So, H and I might not be objections Pence makes in this specific context.

Wait, but the question is about which option is NOT an objection. So, if H or I are not objections, then they could be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps E is not an objection. If the argument is about the child's best interest, maybe Pence doesn't bring up parents' rights as an objection. Because the argument is focused on the child, not the parents.

Wait, but parents' rights could be a separate issue. So, if the anti-SCNT argument is about the child, then the objection about parents' rights (E) would not be relevant. So, E is not an objection Pence gives in this context.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to list each option and see.

Option E: The argument fails to take into account the rights and autonomy of the parents.

If the original argument is that SCNT isn't best for the child, then a possible objection is that it ignores parents' rights. But I'm not sure if Pence makes that point. His focus seems more on the child's quality of life and societal attitudes.

So, perhaps E is not an objection he raises, making E the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the argument is about the child's best interest, and someone objects that parents have rights, that's a separate issue. So, in Pence's objections to the anti-SCNT argument, he might not bring up parental rights.

So, I think the correct answer is E.

The question asks which option is **not** an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child. To determine this, it is important to analyze each option and identify whether it aligns with Pence's arguments against the anti-SCNT position.

Pence's objections primarily focus on countering claims that SCNT is harmful to the child. These include:

1. **Option B**: Pence argues that the expectations placed on SCNT individuals are no worse than those placed on children created sexually.
2. **Option C**: He contends that the argument falsely assumes SCNT individuals would have a lesser quality of life.
3. **Option D**: Pence criticizes the argument for assuming genetic determinism or reductionism.
4. **Option G**: He suggests that people's prejudicial attitudes toward SCNT individuals are likely to change over time.

Options **H** and **I**, which focus on the potential benefits of SCNT for medical research and society, are not directly related to the child's best interest and are therefore less likely to be part of Pence's objections in this context. However, **Option E**, which states that the argument fails to consider the rights and autonomy of parents, is not a point Pence raises. His focus is on the child's welfare and societal attitudes, not parental rights. 

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as it is not an objection Pence gives to the argument that SCNT is not best for the child.

**Answer: E**
