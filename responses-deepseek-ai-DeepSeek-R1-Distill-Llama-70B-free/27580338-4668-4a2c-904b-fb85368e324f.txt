Okay, so I've got this insurance question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about Mr. Green, who just bought a new car. The car is classified as symbol 5, and it's kept in territory 06. He had one accident in the last three years. Now, he's considering using the new car for business, and the question is about the cost difference between a $50 deductible and a $100 deductible for collision insurance.

Hmm, right. I remember that in insurance, the deductible is the amount the policyholder pays out of pocket before the insurance kicks in. So a lower deductible, like $50, means the insurance company pays more, so the premium (the cost of the policy) is higher. Conversely, a higher deductible like $100 means the policyholder pays more when they make a claim, so the premium is lower.

The question is asking for the difference in cost between these two deductibles. So, I need to find out how much more (or less) the $50 deductible policy costs compared to the $100 one.

But wait, the question doesn't give me the actual premium amounts. So I must be missing some information, or perhaps I need to refer to a standard rate table or something. Oh wait, maybe this is part of a textbook or practice exam that provides a table elsewhere. Since I don't have that, I have to think about how such a question is typically structured.

In many insurance questions, the difference in premium for different deductibles is a standard amount, often based on a percentage or a fixed rate per deductible level. For example, maybe each increase in deductible by $50 reduces the premium by a certain fixed amount.

Let me think about possible patterns. For instance, if the premium for $50 deductible is $X, and for $100 it's $Y, the difference is X - Y. But without the exact numbers, I need to rely on typical scenarios.

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing knowledge of how territory, symbol, and accident history affect the rate, but since the deductibles are the only varying factors here, maybe the other factors influence the base rate, but the difference between deductibles is a fixed value.

Wait, I think in some cases, the difference in premium for each $50 increase in deductible is a certain amount. For example, going from $50 to $100 might save $25 on the premium. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the savings for a higher deductible is a fixed amount per $50. For instance, each $50 increase in deductible might lower the premium by $15 or $25. But without specific data, I'm just guessing.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a standard table that shows the cost for each deductible level. Let's say, for example, that the cost for $50 deductible is $150, and for $100 it's $125. The difference would be $25. But again, without the exact numbers, I can't be certain.

Wait, maybe the answer is one of the options given. The options are A through J, with values ranging from $25 to $70. So, perhaps the correct answer is $25, which would be option E. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, considering that the difference might be higher. Let's think about the standard rate increases. If each $50 increase in deductible lowers the premium by, say, $30, then moving from $50 to $100 would save $60, making the difference $60. That would be option B. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, perhaps the standard difference is $25. So the $50 deductible might cost $25 more than the $100. So the difference would be $25. That would make the answer E. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the difference is $50, which is option C. But that seems high if it's just a $50 increase in deductible.

Wait, perhaps the base rate is calculated with a certain formula. Let's say the base premium is 100, and for each $50 deductible, the rate increases by a certain percentage. But without the exact formula or table, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing the understanding that the difference between $50 and $100 deductible is $50, but that seems too straightforward.

Wait, another angle: sometimes the change in deductible affects the premium in a specific way. For example, for collision coverage, each higher deductible might lower the premium by a certain percentage. For example, a $50 deductible might have a $100 premium, and a $100 deductible might be $80. So the difference is $20. But again, without knowing the exact figures, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is $25. So the answer is E, $25.

Wait, but I'm not confident. I think I need to make an educated guess based on typical patterns. In many cases, the difference between a $50 and $100 deductible is often around $25 to $30. So looking at the options, E is $25, which is a plausible answer.

The question involves determining the cost difference between a $50-deductible and a $100-deductible collision insurance policy for Mr. Green. The deductible amount affects the premium, with lower deductibles typically resulting in higher premiums. The difference in cost is calculated by subtracting the premium of the higher deductible ($100) from the premium of the lower deductible ($50). 

While the exact premiums are not provided, the question likely assumes a standard pattern where the difference between a $50 and $100 deductible is a common fixed amount, often around $25. Based on this reasoning and the provided options, the most plausible answer is $25.
