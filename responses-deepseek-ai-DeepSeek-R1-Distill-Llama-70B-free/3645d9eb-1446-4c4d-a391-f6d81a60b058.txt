Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychological testing and legal challenges. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which type of test is most likely to withstand a legal challenge if there's an adverse impact on a minority group. Adverse impact means that the test is having a disproportionately negative effect on a particular group, which can be a legal issue under anti-discrimination laws.

I remember that in the context of employment testing, there are different types of tests, and some are more defensible in court than others. The key here is probably the concept of validity. Tests that are shown to be valid and job-related are more likely to be upheld legally.

Looking at the options:

A: Projective tests. These are like the Rorschach or TAT. They're more about personality and less about specific job skills. I don't think they're as commonly used in hiring, so maybe they're not the best here.

B: Empirically keyed. This refers to tests where the questions are selected based on empirical data showing they predict job performance. I think these are stronger because they have a statistical basis.

C: Personality test. These assess traits like conscientiousness or extroversion. They can be useful, but if there's adverse impact, the employer needs to show the test is necessary and valid. Not sure if it's the strongest.

D: Multiple-choice. This is a format, not a type of test. So it doesn't directly answer the question about the type.

E: Computer adaptive test. This is about the method of administration, not the content. Doesn't speak to validity directly.

F: Integrity test. These measure honesty and trustworthiness. They might be less likely to show adverse impact, but the question is about which test would withstand a challenge if there was an impact.

G: Work sample. These tests have candidates perform tasks that are part of the actual job. They're considered very valid because they directly assess job-related skills. High validity makes them defensible.

H: Situational judgement test. These present scenarios and ask how the candidate would respond. They're related to job situations and have decent validity, but maybe not as strong as work samples.

I: Cognitive ability test. These measure intelligence or problem-solving skills. While they can be predictive, they sometimes show adverse impact against minorities. So if there's an impact, the test needs strong validity. But are they as defensible as work samples?

J: Polygraph test. These are lie detectors, but they're not typically used in employment testing except for specific jobs. They might not be relevant here.

So, thinking about this, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP) emphasize that tests must be job-related and consistent with business necessity. Work sample tests (option G) are often seen as having high face validity and content validity because they directly replicate job tasks. High validity makes it easier to defend against legal challenges even if there's adverse impact, as the employer can argue the test is essential for the job.

Cognitive ability tests (option I) can be valid, but sometimes they have a higher adverse impact. So when there's an adverse impact, the employer needs a strong justification. Work samples, being so directly tied to the job, might have a better chance in court.

So the best answer is probably G: Work sample.

The question asks which type of test is most likely to withstand a legal challenge if there is an adverse impact on a minority group. Adverse impact occurs when a test disproportionately affects a particular group negatively, raising legal concerns under anti-discrimination laws. Tests that are highly valid and directly related to job requirements are more defensible in such cases.

Analyzing the options:

- **Projective tests (A)** and **Personality tests (C)** are less commonly used in hiring and may lack the strong validity needed to withstand legal challenges.
- **Empirically keyed (B)** and **Cognitive ability tests (I)** rely on statistical data and can predict job performance but may still face scrutiny if adverse impact occurs.
- **Multiple-choice (D)** and **Computer adaptive tests (E)** refer to formats, not the content or validity of the test.
- **Integrity tests (F)** and **Situational judgement tests (H)** are relevant but may not have the same level of job-specific validity as other options.
- **Polygraph tests (J)** are rarely used in employment settings and are not relevant here.

**Work sample tests (G)** are highly valid because they directly assess job-related skills by replicating actual job tasks. This strong validity makes them more defensible in legal challenges, even if adverse impact occurs. Therefore, the best answer is:

**G: Work sample**

Answer: G
