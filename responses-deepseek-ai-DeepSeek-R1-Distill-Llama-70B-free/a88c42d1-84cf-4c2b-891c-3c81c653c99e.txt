Okay, so I've got this question about Alice, who's 14 years old and thinks everyone is staring at her because of a blemish on her forehead. The question is asking which concept from Elkind (1967) this belief represents. Hmm, I remember that Elkind did some work on adolescent egocentrism, so maybe that's related.

Wait, I think Elkind proposed that adolescents often have two main types of egocentric thoughts. One is the "imaginary audience" and the other is the "personal fable." Let me think about what each of those means.

The imaginary audience is when a person believes that other people are as focused on them as they are on themselves. So like, if Alice has a pimple, she might think everyone else is noticing it and staring, which fits her situation. That sounds like what's happening here.

The personal fable, on the other hand, is more about feeling unique and invulnerable, like believing you're the only one who feels a certain way or that nothing bad can happen to you. That doesn't quite fit Alice's situation because she's worried about others' attention, not about her uniqueness or being invincible.

So putting it together, Alice's belief is about others watching her, which aligns with the imaginary audience concept. So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: the "imaginary audience."

Answer: E
