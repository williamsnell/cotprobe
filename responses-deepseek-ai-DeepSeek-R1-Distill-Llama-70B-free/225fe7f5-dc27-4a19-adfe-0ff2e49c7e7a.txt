Okay, so I've got this problem about Newton's law of cooling, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

The problem says that the coffee's temperature changes at a rate proportional to the difference between its temperature and the surroundings. So, Newton's law of cooling. I remember that the formula for this is something like T(t) = T_s + (T0 - T_s) * e^(-kt), where T(t) is the temperature at time t, T_s is the surrounding temperature, T0 is the initial temperature, and k is the cooling constant.

The given data: the coffee starts at 200°F, and after 1 minute, it's 190°F. The room is at 70°F. We need to find when the coffee reaches 150°F.

Hmm, let's plug in the numbers. So T0 is 200, T_s is 70. At t=1 min, T is 190.

So the equation at t=1 is 190 = 70 + (200-70)e^(-k*1).

Let me compute that. 200-70 is 130, so 190 =70 +130e^(-k). Subtract 70 from both sides: 120=130e^(-k). Then, divide both sides by 130: 120/130 = e^(-k). Which simplifies to 12/13 ≈ 0.9231 = e^(-k). Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(12/13) = -k. So k = -ln(12/13) = ln(13/12).

Wait, ln(12/13) is negative because 12/13 is less than 1. So k is positive, which makes sense because it's a cooling constant.

Let me calculate that. 13/12 is about 1.0833, so ln(1.0833) is approximately 0.07796 per minute. So k ≈ 0.07796 min^-1.

Now, the problem is to find the time t when T(t) is 150°F. So, using the same formula:

150 = 70 + (200-70)e^(-kt). So 150-70 is 80, and 200-70 is 130 again.

So 80 = 130 e^(-kt). Divide both sides by 130: 80/130 = e^(-kt), which is 8/13 ≈ 0.6154 = e^(-kt). Take the natural log: ln(8/13) = -kt. So t = -ln(8/13)/k.

Wait, but I already have k as ln(13/12). Let me substitute that.

t = (-ln(8/13)) / (ln(13/12)).

Hmm, let's compute this step by step.

First, compute ln(8/13). 8/13 is approximately 0.6154, so ln(0.6154) is about -0.481. Alternatively, using exact fractions: ln(8/13) = ln(8) - ln(13) = (2.079)(ln2 is 0.693, but wait, 8 is 2^3, so ln8=3 ln2 ≈3*0.6931=2.0794. Ln13 is about 2.5649. So 2.0794 - 2.5649 = -0.4855. So ln(8/13) ≈ -0.4855.

Then, ln(13/12) is what? 13/12 is about 1.0833. Ln(1.0833) ≈ 0.07796. So k ≈ 0.07796.

So t = (- (-0.4855)) / 0.07796 = 0.4855 / 0.07796.

Let me compute that. 0.4855 divided by 0.07796. Let's see: 0.07796 times 6 is about 0.46776, which is less than 0.4855. Subtract 0.46776 from 0.4855 and you get about 0.01774 left. 0.07796 times 0.227 is approximately 0.0177 (since 0.07796 *0.2 is 0.0156, *0.227 is about 0.0177). So 0.4855 / 0.07796 ≈ 6.227 minutes.

Wait, but let me check the calculation more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more exact way. Since t = [ln(130/80)] / k.

Wait, because 80 =130 e^(-kt) => e^(-kt) =80/130=8/13.

So ln(8/13) = -kt → t = ln(13/8)/k.

But earlier, we found k= ln(13/12).

So t = [ln(13/8)]/[ln(13/12)].

Wait, let me compute ln(13/8) and ln(13/12).

Compute ln(13/8):

13/8 = 1.625. Ln(1.625) ≈ 0.4855.

Compute ln(13/12)=ln(1.08333)≈0.07796.

So t=0.4855 / 0.07796 ≈6.227 minutes.

But wait, let me compute this division more accurately.

So 0.4855 / 0.07796.

Let me compute 0.07796 * 6 = 0.46776.

0.4855 -0.46776=0.01774.

0.01774 /0.07796 = approx 0.2275.

So 6.2275 minutes.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see options like 6.07 min (option J), 8.4 (H), 7.8 (B), etc. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should redo the steps.

Wait, the initial equation at t=1 is 190=70 +130 e^(-k). So 120=130 e^(-k). So e^(-k)=12/13 ≈0.9231. So k= -ln(12/13)=ln(13/12)= approx 0.07796.

Wait, then when T(t)=150, 150=70 +130 e^(-kt). So 80=130 e^(-kt). So e^(-kt)=80/130=8/13≈0.6154.

So -kt= ln(8/13) → t= -ln(8/13)/k → = ln(13/8)/k.

So ln(13/8) is ln(1.625)= approx 0.4855.

So t=0.4855 / 0.07796 ≈6.227 minutes.

But the options don't have 6.227. The closest option is J:6.07, which is 6.07. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute ln(13/8) and ln(13/12) more accurately.

Compute ln(13/8)=ln(1.625).

Using calculator: ln(1.625) = 0.485497.

ln(13/12)=ln(1.0833333)= 0.0779605.

So t=0.485497 / 0.0779605 = let's compute this.

Divide 0.485497 by 0.0779605.

0.0779605 * 6 = 0.467763.

Subtracting from 0.485497 gives 0.017734.

0.0779605 * 0.2275=?

0.0779605 *0.2=0.0155921.

0.0779605 *0.0275=0.0021463.

So 0.0155921 + 0.0021463=0.0177384.

That's very close to 0.017734, so 0.2275 is correct.

So 6.2275 minutes. So approximately 6.23 minutes.

Looking at the options, J is 6.07, which is 6.07. Hmm, that's lower than my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is T(t) = T_s + (T0 - T_s) e^(-kt).

So, T(t) - T_s = (T0 - T_s) e^(-kt).

So, the ratio (T(t) - T_s)/(T0 - T_s) = e^(-kt).

Take natural log: ln[(T(t)-T_s)/(T0-T_s)] = -kt.

So, at t=1, T=190.

So, (190-70)/(200-70) = 120/130=12/13=e^(-k*1).

So, ln(12/13)= -k → k= -ln(12/13)=ln(13/12)= 0.0779605.

Then, when T(t)=150, (150-70)/(200-70)=80/130=8/13 =e^(-kt).

So, ln(8/13)= -kt → t= -ln(8/13)/k → which is ln(13/8)/k.

So, ln(13/8)= ln(1.625)=0.485497.

So t=0.485497 / 0.0779605= approx 6.2275, which is about 6.23 minutes.

Looking at the options, the closest is J:6.07, but that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier?

Wait, perhaps I should check if my steps are correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the question expects the use of ln( (T - T_s) / (T0 - T_s) ) = -kt.

So, for the first case: t=1, T=190.

ln( (190-70)/(200-70) )= ln(120/130)= ln(12/13)= -k *1 → k= -ln(12/13)=0.07796.

Then, at T=150, ln( (150-70)/(200-70) )= ln(80/130)= ln(8/13)= -kt.

So, t= [ ln(8/13) ] / (-k) )= [ ln(13/8) ] / k.

Which is the same as before.

So, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the options are rounded. Let me compute 6.2275.

Wait, perhaps the exact value is 6.22 minutes, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:10.2

B:7.8

C:12

D:9.5

E:2.8

F:4.5

G:5.2

H:8.4

I:3.3

J:6.07

So J is 6.07, which is about 0.16 less than our calculated 6.22.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the logarithms.

Wait, let me compute ln(8/13) more accurately.

8/13 is 0.615384615.

Natural log of 0.615384615.

Using calculator: ln(0.615384615) ≈-0.481. Hmm, but wait, earlier I thought ln(8/13)= ln(0.615384615)= -0.481, but when I compute it:

Wait, wait, 8/13 is approximately 0.615384615.

ln(0.615384615)=?

Let me compute it with a calculator:

Because 0.615384615 is 8/13.

So, using calculator:

ln(8/13)= ln(8) - ln(13)= 2.079441542 - 2.564949357= -0.485507815.

So yes, it's approximately -0.4855.

So, t= (0.4855) / (0.07796)=6.227.

Hmm, but why is the option J 6.07, which is about 6.07, not 6.22.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me compute k again.

k= ln(13/12)= ln(1.0833333)= 0.0779605.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question uses the formula T(t) = T_s + (T0 - T_s) * e^{-kt}, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I can compute t more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations.

So, let's compute t= [ln(13/8)]/[ln(13/12)].

Compute ln(13/8)=ln(13)-ln(8)=2.564949357 - 2.079441542=0.485507815.

ln(13/12)=ln(13)-ln(12)=2.564949357 - 2.484906649=0.080042708.

So, t=0.485507815 / 0.080042708 ≈6.0703.

Wait, wait, that's very different. Oh wait, no, earlier I thought ln(13/12) was 0.07796, but actually, if ln(12)=2.4849, ln(13)=2.5649.

So, ln(13)-ln(12)=2.5649 -2.4849=0.0800.

Wait, so earlier I thought it was 0.07796, but that's incorrect.

Ah, so I made a mistake in calculating ln(13/12). Ok, let me correct that.

Wait, 13/12 is 1.0833333.

ln(1.0833333)= approx 0.0800.

Wait, using calculator, ln(1.083333)= approximately 0.0800.

So, 0.485507815 / 0.080042708 = ?

0.485507815 divided by 0.080042708.

Let me compute this:

0.080042708 *6 =0.480256248.

Subtracting from 0.485507815: 0.485507815 -0.480256248=0.005251567.

Now, 0.005251567 /0.080042708= approx 0.0656.

So, 6.0656 minutes, approximately 6.07 minutes.

Ah, so this gives t≈6.07 minutes, which is option J.

Wait, but earlier I thought ln(13/12) was 0.07796, but that was a mistake. Correcting that, ln(13/12)=0.0800.

So, that changes the calculation. So, t≈6.07 minutes.

So the correct answer is J:6.07 min.

Newton's law of cooling states that the temperature of an object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between its temperature and that of its surroundings. The formula for this is:

\[
T(t) = T_s + (T_0 - T_s)e^{-kt}
\]

where:
- \(T(t)\) is the temperature of the object at time \(t\),
- \(T_s\) is the surrounding temperature,
- \(T_0\) is the initial temperature of the object,
- \(k\) is the cooling constant.

### Given Data:
- Initial temperature of the coffee: \(T_0 = 200^\circ \mathrm{F}\),
- Surrounding temperature: \(T_s = 70^\circ \mathrm{F}\),
- After \(t = 1 \, \mathrm{min}\), the coffee cools to \(T = 190^\circ \mathrm{F}\),
- We need to find the time \(t\) when the coffee reaches \(T = 150^\circ \mathrm{F}\).

### Step 1: Determine the cooling constant \(k\)
Using the data at \(t = 1 \, \mathrm{min}\):
\[
190 = 70 + (200 - 70)e^{-k(1)}
\]
Simplify:
\[
190 - 70 = 130e^{-k} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 120 = 130e^{-k}
\]
Divide through by 130:
\[
\frac{120}{130} = e^{-k} \quad \Rightarrow \quad e^{-k} = \frac{12}{13}
\]
Take the natural logarithm:
\[
-k = \ln\left(\frac{12}{13}\right) \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = -\ln\left(\frac{12}{13}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{13}{12}\right)
\]
Using a calculator:
\[
k = \ln(1.083333) \approx 0.080042708 \, \mathrm{min}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(t\) when \(T(t) = 150^\circ \mathrm{F}\)
Using the formula:
\[
150 = 70 + (200 - 70)e^{-kt}
\]
Simplify:
\[
150 - 70 = 130e^{-kt} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 80 = 130e^{-kt}
\]
Divide through by 130:
\[
\frac{80}{130} = e^{-kt} \quad \Rightarrow \quad e^{-kt} = \frac{8}{13}
\]
Take the natural logarithm:
\[
-kt = \ln\left(\frac{8}{13}\right) \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = -\frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{13}\right)}{k}
\]
Substitute \(k = \ln\left(\frac{13}{12}\right)\):
\[
t = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{13}{8}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{13}{12}\right)}
\]
Using a calculator:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{13}{8}\right) = \ln(1.625) \approx 0.485507815, \quad \ln\left(\frac{13}{12}\right) = \ln(1.083333) \approx 0.080042708
\]
\[
t = \frac{0.485507815}{0.080042708} \approx 6.07 \, \mathrm{min}
\]

### Final Answer:
The coffee reaches \(150^\circ \mathrm{F}\) at approximately **6.07 minutes**.

**Correct Option: J: 6.07 min**
