Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about offensive and defensive realism. Hmm, I remember from my international relations class that these are two theories within realism, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact differences. Let me think this through.

So, the question is asking which statement is not correct regarding offensive and defensive realism. The options are A through F. I need to figure out each one to see which is incorrect.

First, let me recall what offensive and defensive realism are about. Offensive realism, as I remember, is associated with scholars like John Mearsheimer. The core idea is that the international system is anarchic, and states can never be too secure. Because of this, states are inclined to seek more power to ensure their survival. They might even pursue offensive strategies to increase their power because power is the key to security. So, offensive realists would probably not shy away from competition and would see cooperation as risky because others might take advantage.

On the other hand, defensive realism, linked with Kenneth Waltz, also operates in an anarchic system but suggests that states are primarily motivated by survival, not necessarily the desire to maximize power. Defensive realists believe that states can achieve security through cooperation and that balance of power is a more stable approach. They might be more cautious about expanding power because it could lead to a backlash or arms races, which aren't in anyone's interest.

Now, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Both offensive and defensive realism agree that states should avoid cooperation to achieve security.
Wait, no. I thought defensive realists actually do think cooperation is possible and beneficial for security. Offensive realists are more skeptical of cooperation because they think states will cheat if it benefits them. So this statement can't be right because defensive realism doesn't avoid cooperation. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Offensive realism regards cooperation as the way in which states can achieve security.
No, that's opposite. Offensive realists don't think cooperation is the way. They think competition and power are more reliable. So B is incorrect. But wait, the question is which statement is not correct, so B is incorrect, making it a candidate.

Option C: Offensive realism argues that states should avoid power and competition to achieve security.
No way. Offensive realism is all about seeking power. Avoiding power would be the opposite. So C is definitely incorrect. But let's check other options.

Option D: Both defensive realism and offensive realism regard power and competition as a means by which security can be achieved for the state.
Wait, defensive realism does think power is important but perhaps not the only or best way. I think defensive realists see power as necessary but also believe in cooperation. So D says both see power and competition as means. Offensive realists definitely do. Do defensive realists? Maybe. So D might be correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option E: Defensive realism theorizes that states will pursue hegemony where possible.
No, I think offensive realists are more about pursuing hegemony because they seek as much power as possible. Defensive realists would avoid hegemony because it could provoke others. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Both offensive and defensive realism agree that states should avoid power and competition to achieve security.
No, that's wrong because offensive realism definitely doesn't avoid power. So F is incorrect.

Wait, the question is which statement is NOT correct. So I need to find the incorrect statement.

Let me go back.

Option A: Both agree to avoid cooperation. As I thought, defensive realism doesn't avoid cooperation, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Offensive realism regards cooperation as a way. No, that's wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Offensive realism argues to avoid power. No, that's wrong. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Both see power and competition as means. Offensive does, but does defensive? Defensive realists might see competition as sometimes necessary but prefer cooperation when possible. So perhaps D is correct because both do see power as important, just with different approaches. So D would be correct.

Option E: Defensive realism says states pursue hegemony. No, that's offensive. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Both avoid power and competition. No, offensive doesn't. So F is incorrect.

So the question is which statement is not correct. Let's re-examine the options.

The question is about which is NOT correct. So the incorrect statements are A, B, C, E, F. The correct statements would be D, perhaps.

Wait, but the question is about which is NOT correct. So the correct answer would be the one that is incorrect.

Looking back at the options, the question is which is not correct.

So, let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: Both agree to avoid cooperation. As defensive realism doesn't avoid cooperation, A is incorrect.

Option B: Offensive sees cooperation as way. No, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Offensive avoids power. No, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Both see power/competition as means. Yes, I think both do. Even defensive realists use power but in a defensive way. So D is correct.

Option E: Defensive realism and hegemony. No, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Both avoid power. No, so F is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be one of the incorrect options. The question asks which is not correct, meaning which is false.

Looking back at the question, the options are A-F, and the correct answer is the one that is incorrect.

The options are:

A: Both avoid cooperation. (False, because defensive realism doesn't.)

B: Offensive sees cooperation as way. (False.)

C: Offensive avoids power. (False.)

D: Both see power/comp as means. (True.)

E: Defensive realism says states pursue hegemony. (False.)

F: Both avoid power. (False.)

So the question is which is not correct. So the incorrect statements are A, B, C, E, F. The correct ones are D.

Wait, the question is which statement is NOT correct, so the incorrect options are A, B, C, E, F. So the correct answers to the question (the incorrect statements) are these, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, but the options are labeled A to F, and the question is which is not correct.

Wait, the question is phrased as "which of these statements is not correct?" So the correct answer is the incorrect statement.

Let me check each option again.

Option A: Both agree to avoid cooperation. That's incorrect because defensive realism doesn't avoid it. So A is not correct.

Option B: Offensive sees cooperation as way. That's incorrect. So B is not correct.

Option C: Offensive avoids power. That's incorrect. So C is not correct.

Option D: Both see power/comp. as means. That's correct. So D is correct.

Option E: Defensive realism says states pursue hegemony. That's incorrect. So E is not correct.

Option F: Both avoid power. That's incorrect. So F is not correct.

So the question is which is not correct. The options A, B, C, E, F are all incorrect. But the question is multiple choice, so only one is correct as the answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, the answer is the statement that is incorrect. So all these options are incorrect except D.

Wait, the question is which statement is not correct. So the correct answer is the incorrect statement. So among the options, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine each option.

Looking at Option B: Offensive realism regards cooperation as the way to achieve security. No, offensive realists don't think that. They are skeptical of cooperation. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Offensive realism argues that states should avoid power and competition. No, they do the opposite. So C is incorrect.

Option E: Defensive realism says states will pursue hegemony. No, that's offensive. So E is incorrect.

Wait, but the options are A-F, and the question is which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Let me think again.

Option C says offensive realists argue that states should avoid power and competition to achieve security. That's the opposite of what offensive realism says. So C is incorrect.

So the question is asking which statement is not correct, so the answer would be C.

Wait, but let's check all the options.

Which of the statements is not correct?

Looking for the one that is factually wrong.

So, let's think about each.

Option C: Offensive realism argues that states should avoid power and competition. That's incorrect because offensive realism actually says that states should seek power and engage in competition. So C is incorrect.

Option E: Defensive realism theorizes that states will pursue hegemony where possible. That's incorrect because defensive realists don't pursue hegemony; offensive realists do.

So both C and E are incorrect, but looking back at the answer options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait the options are:

A: Both avoid cooperation. (False, defensive doesn't.)

B: Offensive sees coop as way. (False.)

C: Offensive avoids power. (False.)

D: Both see power/comp as means. (True.)

E: Defensive seeks hegemony. (False.)

F: Both avoid power. (False.)

So the incorrect statements are A, B, C, E, F. So the correct answer is one of these.

Wait, but the question is which is not correct. So the answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because defensive realists don't pursue hegemony, offensive do. So E is incorrect.

Alternatively, C is incorrect because offensive realism doesn't avoid power.

So both C and E are incorrect.

Wait, the question is which is not correct, so the answer would be one of these.

Looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again.

The question is: Which statement is not correct.

Offensive realism says states should seek power and competition. So any statement saying offensive avoids power is wrong.

So option C is incorrect.

Option E says defensive realism thinks states will pursue hegemony. That's wrong because it's offensive that does.

So both C and E are incorrect, but the question is which is not correct, so which is the answer.

Wait, but the question is a single choice. So I must have made a mistake. Let me see.

Looking back, perhaps the answer is E. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me think again.

Option C: Offensive realism argues that states should avoid power and competition to achieve security. That's wrong because offensive realism says states should seek power and engage in competition.

Yes, so C is incorrect.

Option E: Defensive realism theorizes that states will pursue hegemony where possible. No, that's offensive realism. So E is incorrect.

Wait, but the options are A-F, each is a possible answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, let me cross-reference.

Another approach: What do each of the options state.

Option A: Both agree to avoid cooperation. No, defensive realists don't. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Offensive sees cooperation as the way. No, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Offensive avoids power. No, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Both see power/comp as means. Yes, D is correct.

Option E: Defensive says states pursue hegemony. No, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Both avoid power. No, so F is incorrect.

The question is which is not correct, so all except D are incorrect.

But the options given are A-F, so the answer is among them.

Wait, but the question is which is not correct, so which is false.

So the correct answer is one of A, B, C, E, F.

Now, the question is about which statement is incorrect.

The possible answers are A, B, C, E, F.

But looking for the one that is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option is factually incorrect.

Let me think about each theory again.

Offensive Realism:

- Anarchy leads to security competition.

- States can never be too secure; more power is better.

- Cooperation is risky because others might exploit.

- Power is the key; states should seek hegemony if possible.

Defensive Realism:

- Anarchy exists, but states can cooperate.

- Security can be achieved through cooperation and balance of power.

- Excessive power can lead to instability, so states should maintain a defensive posture.

So, based on this:

Option A: Both agree to avoid cooperation. No, defensive realism doesn't. So A is wrong.

Option B: Offensive sees cooperation as the way. No, so B is wrong.

Option C: Offensive avoids power. No, they seek power. So C is wrong.

Option D: Both see power/comp as means. Offensive does, defensive sees power as necessary but prefers cooperation. So D is correct.

Option E: Defensive realism says pursue hegemony. No, so E is wrong.

Option F: Both avoid power. No, offensive doesn't. So F is wrong.

So the incorrect statements are A, B, C, E, F. The correct statement is D.

The question is which is not correct, so the answer is one of A, B, C, E, F.

But the question is multiple choice, so only one option is correct as the answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Because defensive realists don't pursue hegemony, offensive do.

Alternatively, the answer could be C because offensive realists don't avoid power.

Hmm.

Wait, the question is which statement is not correct. So which of the options is factually wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Offensive realism argues that states should avoid power and competition to achieve security. That's the opposite of offensive realism, which argues states should seek power. So C is incorrect.

Option E: Defensive realism theorizes that states will pursue hegemony where possible. That's incorrect because offensive realists do that, not defensive. So E is incorrect.

So both C and E are incorrect. But the options don't present both; each is a separate option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think in terms of each option.

Which option is definitely wrong.

Option C is wrong because offensive realism is about seeking power, not avoiding.

Option E is wrong because defensive realism doesn't pursue hegemony.

But the question is which statement is not correct. So both C and E are incorrect, but the answer options only allow one correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the most incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Because defensive realists don't pursue hegemony, but offensive do.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, but the options are A to F, each being a possible answer. The question is to choose one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.

Another approach: Let's match each option to what's correct.

Option A: Both avoid cooperation. No, defensive realism doesn't. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Offensive sees cooperation as a way. No, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Offensive avoids power. No, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Both see power/comp as means. Yes, D is correct.

Option E: Defensive seeks hegemony. No, E is incorrect.

Option F: Both avoid power. No, F is incorrect.

So the question is which is not correct. So the incorrect statements are A, B, C, E, F.

But the question is multiple choice, so only one is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is C. Because offensive realism definitely doesn't avoid power.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option C: Offensive realism argues that states should avoid power and competition. That's the opposite. So C is incorrect.

Option E: Defensive realism theorizes that states will pursue hegemony where possible. No, that's offensive. So E is incorrect.

So both C and E are incorrect, but the answer options are separate.

Wait, the question is which is not correct. So the correct answer is one of these.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, the options are:

The question is phrased as: which statement is not correct.

So all the incorrect options (A, B, C, E, F) are not correct. But the correct answer is the one that is incorrect.

So the answer is one of these.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the other options.

Option A: Both agree to avoid cooperation. That's incorrect because defensive realism doesn't. So A is wrong.

Option B: Offensive sees cooperation as the way. No, so B is wrong.

Option C: Offensive avoids power. No, so C is wrong.

Option D: Both see power/comp as means. Correct.

Option E: Defensive pursues hegemony. No, so E is wrong.

Option F: Both avoid power. No, so F is wrong.

So all except D are incorrect. So the incorrect statements are A, B, C, E, F.

But the question is which one is not correct. So the correct answer is one of these.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Which of these is the most incorrect statement.

Option C says offensive realism argues to avoid power. That's directly opposite to offensive realism's tenets. So C is incorrect.

Option E says defensive realism theorizes states pursue hegemony. That's incorrect because that's offensive realism. So E is incorrect.

So both C and E are incorrect. But the question is to choose one option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because it's the only one that misattributes hegemony to defensive.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C because it directly contradicts offensive realism's core belief.

I think the answer is C. Because offensive realism is all about seeking power, not avoiding it.

So the incorrect statement is C.
</think>

To determine which statement is not correct regarding offensive and defensive realism, let's analyze each option:

### Key Concepts:
- **Offensive Realism**: Associated with scholars like John Mearsheimer. It posits that the international system is anarchic, and states can never be too secure. States seek power and engage in competition to ensure survival. Cooperation is viewed skeptically, as others may exploit it.
- **Defensive Realism**: Linked with Kenneth Waltz. It also operates in an anarchic system but suggests that states are primarily motivated by survival. Cooperation and balance of power are seen as viable means to achieve security. States avoid excessive power to prevent provoking others.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A**: "Both offensive and defensive realism agree that states should avoid cooperation to achieve security."
   - **Incorrect**: Defensive realism does not avoid cooperation; it sees cooperation as beneficial for security. Offensive realism is skeptical of cooperation, but defensive realism does not share this view.

2. **Option B**: "Offensive realism regards cooperation as the way in which states can achieve security."
   - **Incorrect**: Offensive realism does not view cooperation as a reliable means to achieve security. It emphasizes power and competition instead.

3. **Option C**: "Offensive realism argues that states should avoid power and competition to achieve security."
   - **Incorrect**: This directly contradicts offensive realism
