Okay, so I've got this question about contractionary monetary policy and its effects on the discount rate, nominal interest rate, and aggregate demand. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, contractionary monetary policy is when a central bank, like the Federal Reserve, takes actions to reduce the money supply and slow down the economy. I remember that one of the tools they use is the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate the central bank charges commercial banks for loans. So, if the policy is contractionary, they probably increase the discount rate. Because higher rates make borrowing more expensive for banks, which then have less money to lend out, right?

Wait, but wait. How does that affect the nominal interest rate in the economy? Well, if the discount rate goes up, banks might increase the interest rates they charge their customers. Because they're paying more to borrow from the central bank, they pass that cost on. So nominal interest rates in the economy would also increase. That makes sense because when interest rates rise, people borrow less, spend less, and aggregate demand should decrease.

So putting it together: contractionary policy leads to an increase in the discount rate. Higher discount rate leads to higher nominal interest rates. And higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, so people and businesses borrow less, leading to reduced spending and thus lower aggregate demand.

Let me look at the options. The question is asking about each variable: discount rate, nominal interest rate, aggregate demand. Each option lists these three in that order.

Option D says: Increases, Increases, Decreases. That fits what I was thinking.

Wait, any other possibilities? Let me think again. Oh, sometimes the central bank uses open market operations to change the money supply. When they sell securities, they reduce the money supply, which would increase interest rates. So that's another way to think about it, but the effect on the discount rate and nominal interest rates is the same.

So yes, I think D is the correct choice. All three variables are addressed correctly.

Contractionary monetary policy is implemented by central banks to reduce the money supply and slow down economic activity. One of the key tools used is the discount rate, which is the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow from the central bank. When the central bank adopts a contractionary policy, it increases the discount rate, making borrowing more expensive for banks. This, in turn, leads to higher nominal interest rates in the economy as banks pass on the increased borrowing costs to their customers. 

Higher nominal interest rates reduce borrowing and spending, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand. Therefore, contractionary monetary policy results in an increase in both the discount rate and nominal interest rates, while aggregate demand decreases.

Considering the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: Increases      Increases      Decreases**

Answer: D
