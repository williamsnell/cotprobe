Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this phase equilibrium question. The question is about a three-component mixture and the maximum number of phases that can coexist at equilibrium. Hmm, I remember something about the Gibbs phase rule from my studies. Let me try to recall.

The Gibbs phase rule is something like the number of phases plus the number of degrees of freedom equals the components plus something else. Oh wait, right, the formula is F = C - P + 2, where F is the degrees of freedom, C the components, and P the phases. Or wait, no, wait. Maybe it's F = C - P + 2. Yeah, that sounds right.

So the question is about the maximum number of phases, which I think would be when the system is at equilibrium with as many phases as possible. So we want to maximize P. Since F is the degrees of freedom, and in a situation where the system is in equilibrium, F would be zero because there's no variance—meaning temperature and pressure are fixed, or something like that.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The Gibbs phase rule is F = C - P + 2. And F is the number of degrees of freedom, which are variables like temperature and pressure that can be changed without changing the number of phases. So if the system is at equilibrium and we're looking for the maximum number of phases, we probably want to set F to zero, right? Because that's when you can't change anything without changing the phases.

So plugging in, F equals zero. So 0 = C - P + 2. Let's solve for P. Rearranging, P = C + 2. Wait, no, wait: 0 = 3 - P + 2. Because the question is about a three-component mixture, so C is 3. So 0 = 3 - P + 2. That simplifies to 0 = 5 - P, so P = 5. So the maximum number of phases is 5?

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The phase rule is F = C - P + 2. And when the system is in equilibrium, the maximum number of phases occurs when F is zero. So yes, P = C + 2. Wait, C is 3, so P would be 5. So the answer should be 5?

Looking at the options, option J is 5. So the answer would be J:5.

But wait, am I confusing something here? I think I might be mixing up the conditions. Because I remember that for a single-component system, like water, the maximum number of phases is three—solid, liquid, gas. Let me check that with the phase rule. For C=1, F=1-P+2. If in equilibrium, F=0, so P=3. Which matches. So that works.

Another example: for a two-component system. C=2, so P=4? But wait, can two components have four phases at once? I'm not so sure. Wait, maybe in some cases. But in a three-component system, the calculation gives P=5. So the maximum is 5 phases.

Hmm, but I've also heard that in practice, it's hard to have that many phases, but theoretically, it's possible. So I think the correct answer is J:5.

The question asks for the maximum number of phases that can be at equilibrium in a three-component mixture. To solve this, we use the Gibbs phase rule:

\[
F = C - P + 2
\]

Here, \( F \) is the degrees of freedom, \( C \) is the number of components, and \( P \) is the number of phases. At equilibrium, \( F = 0 \), as there are no variables (like temperature or pressure) that can be changed without altering the number of phases. Substituting \( C = 3 \) (for a three-component mixture) into the equation:

\[
0 = 3 - P + 2
\]

Simplifying:

\[
P = 5
\]

Thus, the maximum number of phases that can coexist at equilibrium in a three-component mixture is 5. This matches option J.

Answer: J
