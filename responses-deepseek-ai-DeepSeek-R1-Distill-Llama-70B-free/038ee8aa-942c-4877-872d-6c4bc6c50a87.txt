Okay, so I have this complex analysis question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking whether there exists a holomorphic function f defined on the unit disk B(0,1) (excluding the boundary) such that the image of f is the entire complex plane C. And I have to return 1 for yes and 0 for no. The options are given as A to J, with various numbers, but I think the key is to determine whether such a function exists.

Hmm, I remember that in complex analysis, there's something called Liouville's Theorem. Liouville's Theorem states that every bounded entire function is constant. Wait, but this is about a function on the unit disk, not the entire complex plane. Oh right, but the unit disk is a bounded domain. So maybe that plays a role here.

Wait, no, the function f is defined on the unit disk, which is an open set in C, but it's not the entire complex plane. So Liouville's Theorem in its basic form might not apply directly here. Because Liouville's usually talks about functions that are entire, meaning they're holomorphic on all of C.

But wait, there's another theorem related to the unit disk. Oh, right, the Little Picard Theorem. No, wait, the Little Picard Theorem says that if a function is entire and non-constant, then its image is either the whole complex plane or misses at most one point. But again, that's for entire functions.

Wait, but I'm dealing with a function on the unit disk. So maybe I should think about the maximum modulus principle or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can think about whether the unit disk is biholomorphic to the complex plane.

Wait, another thought: the unit disk and the complex plane are not conformally equivalent because they are not homeomorphic. The unit disk is simply connected but it's not the same as C in terms of holomorphic mappings. But wait, in complex analysis, I think that the unit disk and the complex plane are different because, for example, the unit disk is hyperbolic and C is parabolic in terms of their geometry.

Wait, but the question is about whether a holomorphic function can map the unit disk onto C. So the image being the entire complex plane. So f(B(0,1)) = C.

I remember that for the unit disk, any holomorphic function on it can be represented by a power series. But does such a function cover the entire complex plane?

Wait, let me think about the possible images. For a function to be surjective onto C, it must attain every complex value. So for every w in C, there exists a z in B(0,1) such that f(z) = w.

But wait, the unit disk is a bounded domain. So if f is holomorphic on B(0,1), can it be unbounded? Because if f(B(0,1)) is all of C, then f must be unbounded because C is unbounded.

Wait, but if a function is holomorphic on a bounded domain, can it be unbounded? Or is it necessarily bounded? I think about the maximum modulus principle, which says that a non-constant holomorphic function on an open set can't have its maximum modulus attained in the interior unless it's constant. But that doesn't directly say whether it's bounded or not.

Wait, but in the case of the unit disk, if a function is bounded, then by Liouville's Theorem, it can't be entire unless it's constant, but here f is defined on the unit disk, not all of C. So maybe f can be unbounded on the unit disk.

Wait, but can a holomorphic function on the unit disk be unbounded? For example, consider the function f(z) = 1/(1-z). That's holomorphic on the unit disk, right? Because the denominator is zero only at z=1, which is on the boundary. So in the open unit disk, it's holomorphic. But as z approaches 1 from within the disk, f(z) goes to infinity. So f is unbounded on the unit disk.

Ah, so a function can be holomorphic on the unit disk and still be unbounded. So that function, 1/(1-z), maps the unit disk to C minus some part? Let me see: f(z) = 1/(1-z) takes values in C \ {0}, because as z approaches 1, it goes to infinity, and as z approaches -∞, but wait, no, the function is only defined on the unit disk. Wait, for z approaching 1, f(z) approaches infinity, but what about other points?

Wait, let me compute f(z) as z approaches different points. Let's say z approaches 1 from below on the real axis: f(z) approaches +infinity. If z approaches a point just less than 1, say 1 - ε for small ε>0, then f(z) is positive and large. Similarly, approaching from the other side (though z is confined to the disk, so it can't go beyond 1). But in any case, f(z) can take any positive real value greater than 1/(1 - |z|), but wait, more accurately, when z is in the unit disk, |z| <1, so 1-z is in a disk of radius 1 around 1, so 1/(1-z) can take a variety of values, but I'm not sure if it's the entire complex plane.

Wait, let's think of f(z) = e^{g(z)}, where g(z) is some function. If I can make g(z) take all complex values, then the exponential function would cover the punctured plane, but not zero. But that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps considering a function that can attain every complex value. Let's think about polynomials. But polynomials are entire functions, and by Liouville, they can't be surjective unless they're constant, but wait, no, actually, polynomials are surjective onto C if they're of degree ≥1. Wait, no: a non-constant polynomial is surjective as a map from C to C because for any w in C, the equation P(z) = w has a root. But on the unit disk, can a polynomial map the unit disk onto C? Probably not, because the unit disk is bounded, and a non-constant polynomial tends to infinity as |z| tends to infinity, but on the unit disk, |z| is less than 1, so the image would be bounded. Wait, no: for example, consider f(z) = z. Then f(B(0,1)) is B(0,1), which is not all of C. Similarly, f(z) = z^n would map the unit disk to another disk. So polynomials won't do.

Wait, but what about other functions? Let me think about the function f(z) = 1/(1 - z). As I thought earlier, this function is holomorphic on B(0,1), and as z approaches 1, f(z) approaches infinity. So the image of f would be all complex numbers except 0, because when z approaches 1, f(z) goes to infinity, and when z is near 0, f(z) is near 1. But wait, does it cover the entire complex plane except zero? Or does it miss more points?

Wait, let's see. f(z) = 1/(1 - z) maps the unit disk to the complex plane minus some points. Let me think: when z is in the unit disk, 1 - z is in the right half-plane, because Re(1 - z) > 0 since |z| < 1. So 1/(1 - z) would lie in the left half-plane, but wait, no: if z is in the unit disk, then 1 - z has real part greater than zero because Re(1 - z) = 1 - Re(z) > 0, since Re(z) < 1. Therefore, 1/(1 - z) would have Re(1/(1 - z)) < 0. So the image of f(z) = 1/(1 - z) is the left half-plane, i.e., {w ∈ C : Re(w) < 0}. So it's not all of C, because it misses the right half-plane and zero.

So that function doesn't cover C. So perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, but maybe I can construct a function that does cover all of C. Let me think about using an infinite product or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using a function that's known to map the unit disk onto C.

Wait, another thought: the unit disk is conformally equivalent to the complex plane via a mapping like the Cayley transform. Wait, the Cayley transform maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk. But maybe there's a function that maps the unit disk to the complex plane.

Wait, more accurately, the unit disk and the complex plane are not conformally equivalent because the unit disk is hyperbolic and C is parabolic. But that doesn't immediately answer the question about the existence of a holomorphic surjective function.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps considering that the unit disk is biholomorphic to C via some function. Wait, I don't think that's possible because their automorphism groups are different, and the unit disk is not simply connected at infinity, while C is. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about whether such a function can exist. So, f: B(0,1) → C is holomorphic, and surjective. Does such a function exist?

I remember that in complex analysis, the unit disk is a hyperbolic Riemann surface, meaning that it's uniformly hyperbolic, and functions from it can't be surjective onto the entire complex plane because of the structure of their holomorphic maps.

Wait, but I also recall that there's a theorem called the Great Picard Theorem, which says that in any neighborhood of an essential singularity, a holomorphic function takes on all complex values infinitely often, with at most one exception. So if a function has an essential singularity on the boundary of the unit disk, then near that singularity, the function would take on almost all complex values. But the function would still be defined on the unit disk, excluding the boundary.

Wait, but for example, consider f(z) = e^{1/(1 - z)} or something similar. Let me think: as z approaches 1, 1/(1 - z) approaches -infinity, so e^{1/(1 - z)} approaches 0. Wait, no, maybe that's not the best example.

Alternatively, consider f(z) = 1/(1 - z)^n for some n. But as before, these functions might not cover all of C.

Wait, perhaps considering a function with essential singularities on the boundary. For example, consider f(z) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ z^{n!}, which has a radius of convergence 1 and has an essential singularity at z=1. But I'm not sure if that function's image covers all of C.

Wait, but I'm not sure if such a function would be surjective. It might not reach every point in C.

Another approach: Suppose such a function f exists. Then, because it's holomorphic on the unit disk and surjective onto C, it must be unbounded, as C is unbounded. So f would have to be unbounded on B(0,1). But is that possible?

Wait, I know that functions can be unbounded on the unit disk. For example, f(z) = 1/(1 - z) is unbounded on B(0,1). But as I saw earlier, it doesn't cover all of C.

Wait, but maybe there exists a function that does. Let me think about the Weierstrass theorem and stuff. Or perhaps, using some kind of infinite products or similar.

Alternatively, maybe I can argue by connectivity. The image of a connected set under a holomorphic function is connected. Since C is connected, that's fine. But that doesn't help much.

Wait, another thought: the unit disk is a simply connected Riemann surface, and by the Uniformization Theorem, every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to either the unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere. So the unit disk and C are different in that sense. So perhaps there's no conformal map from the unit disk to C, because they are different simply connected surfaces. But the question is about a holomorphic function, not necessarily a conformal map or biholomorphism. So a conformal map is a bijective holomorphic function with a holomorphic inverse, but the question just asks for a surjective holomorphic function, which doesn't have to be injective or have an inverse.

So maybe that's possible. But then again, I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the Liouville's Theorem again, but in the context of the unit disk. If f is bounded on the unit disk, then it's constant. But if it's unbounded, can it attain every complex value?

Wait, but if f is holomorphic on B(0,1) and unbounded, does that imply that it's surjective? No, not necessarily. For example, f(z) = 1/(1 - z) is unbounded but only maps to the left half-plane. Similarly, f(z) = z would map to the unit disk, which is bounded.

Wait, but maybe if we can find a function that has essential singularities densely located on the boundary, then the function might take on all values in C infinitely often. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps considering a taylor series whose partial sums are dense in C, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: Suppose f is a holomorphic function on B(0,1) such that f(B(0,1)) = C. Then, for every w ∈ C, the equation f(z) = w has a solution in B(0,1). Now, consider the function f(z) = (1 - z)^{-1} as before. The image is {w ∈ C : Re(w) < 0}, which is not all of C. So that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps composing functions. Suppose I take a function that maps the unit disk onto the complex plane. Maybe a suitable function like a composition of functions that together cover all of C.

Wait, but I can't think of such a function. Maybe the answer is no, such a function doesn't exist.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible properties. If f is a holomorphic function on the unit disk and it's surjective onto C, then it must be unbounded, as C is unbounded. So f cannot be bounded. But can such an f exist?

Wait, another thought: The unit disk is a hyperbolic Riemann surface, and C is a parabolic Riemann surface. So, I think that there are no non-constant holomorphic maps from a hyperbolic surface to a parabolic one except for constant maps. Wait, is that true? Or is that only under certain conditions.

Wait, I think that a parabolic surface doesn't have non-constant holomorphic functions mapping to a hyperbolic surface, but the other way around might not necessarily be impossible. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of analytic continuation. If f is defined on the unit disk and is holomorphic there, and it's surjective onto C, then it would have to have an essential singularity on the boundary, I suppose. But even so, I'm not certain if that would make the image cover all of C.

Wait, perhaps the answer is no. Because if f is holomorphic on the unit disk and its image is C, which is simply connected, but the unit disk is also simply connected. But I don't know if that implies anything about the existence of such a function.

Wait, another angle: If f is a holomorphic function from the unit disk to C, and it's surjective, then for every w ∈ C, there's some z in B(0,1) with f(z)=w. But consider the function f(z) = z. That's not surjective onto C because the image is just the unit disk. Similarly, any polynomial would have an image that's not all of C when restricted to the unit disk.

But what about non-polynomial functions? Like functions with essential singularities on the boundary. For example, f(z) = e^{1/(1-z)}. Let's see, as z approaches 1, 1/(1-z) approaches -infty, so e^{-infty} approaches 0. Wait, but when z approaches other boundary points, what happens? For example, approaching other points on the unit circle, say z approaching e^{iθ}, then 1/(1 - e^{iθ}) is some finite complex number, so e^{1/(1 - e^{iθ})} is some point in C. But does this function f(z) = e^{1/(1-z)} map the unit disk onto C?

Wait, let's think about the range. The exponent 1/(1-z) can take any complex value except perhaps zero. So as z approaches 1 from inside the disk, 1/(1-z) approaches negative infinity, so f(z) approaches zero. But for other points near the boundary, 1/(1-z) can take any complex value except when 1-z approaches zero. So the exponent can take any value in C except where 1/(1-z) is undefined, which is at z=1.

So the function f(z) = e^{1/(1-z)} would have an essential singularity at z=1. The image of f would be all of C except 0, because the exponential function never takes the value zero. So f(z) would map B(0,1) to C \ {0}, not all of C. So that's not surjective onto C.

Hmm, so that approach misses zero. What if I take another function that covers zero? Like f(z) = z * e^{1/(1-z)}. Then, when z approaches 0, f(z) approaches zero, and as z approaches 1, e^{1/(1-z)} approaches zero, but multiplied by z approaching 1, so f(z) approaches zero from some direction. But does this cover all of C?

Wait, maybe not, because for other points, the function might not attain all values. It's getting complicated, and I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Wait, another idea: The unit disk is biholomorphic to the upper half-plane via the Cayley transform. And the upper half-plane is conformally equivalent to the unit disk. So if I can find a function from the upper half-plane to C that's surjective, then composing with the Cayley transform would give a function from the unit disk to C.

But do I know a function from the upper half-plane to C that's surjective? Well, the exponential function maps the complex
