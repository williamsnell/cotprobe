Okay, so I'm trying to solve this finance problem about the intrinsic value of a stock. Hmm, I remember that intrinsic value calculations often involve dividends and some kind of discounting. Let me think about the concepts here.

The question says the stock pays a $5 dividend this year, and the dividend has been growing at 6% annually. The required rate of return is 12%. I think I need to calculate the present value of all future dividends, but wait, that's for a dividend discount model. Oh right, the Gordon Growth Model, which is a special case of the DDM where dividends grow indefinitely at a constant rate.

The formula I remember is the Gordon Growth Model formula: intrinsic value (P) equals the next year's dividend (D1) divided by the required rate of return (r) minus the growth rate (g). So P = D1/(r - g).

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting the formula right. So D1 is the dividend for the next year, which is this year's dividend plus the growth rate. Oh right, because the $5 is this year's dividend, so next year's would be 5*(1+0.06) since it's growing at 6%.

So D1 is 5 * 1.06. Let me calculate that: 5 * 1.06 is 5.30.

Then, the required rate of return (r) is 12%, which is 0.12. The growth rate (g) is 6%, so 0.06. So plugging into the formula: P = 5.3 / (0.12 - 0.06).

Wait, 0.12 minus 0.06 is 0.06. So P = 5.3 / 0.06. Let me do that division. 5.3 divided by 0.06. Hmm, 5.3 divided by 0.06 is the same as 5.3 * (100/6), because dividing by 0.06 is multiplying by 1/0.06 which is approximately 16.6667.

So 5.3 * 16.6667. Let me calculate that. 5 * 16.6667 is 83.3335, and 0.3 * 16.6667 is 5.0001. Adding them together gives 88.3336. So approximately $88.33.

Looking at the options, option G is 88.33, so that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Oh, no, the formula is correct. The present value is D1/(r - g). So yes, 5.3/(0.12-0.06) is 88.33.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is to calculate the value per share as the next year's dividend divided by (r - g). Yep, that aligns with what I did. So I think G is correct.

To determine the intrinsic value of the stock, we use the Gordon Growth Model, which is appropriate for this scenario since the dividends are growing at a constant rate indefinitely. The formula for the intrinsic value (P) is:

\[
P = \frac{D_1}{r - g}
\]

Where:
- \(D_1\) is the dividend for the next year.
- \(r\) is the required rate of return.
- \(g\) is the dividend growth rate.

### Step 1: Calculate \(D_1\)
The current dividend is $5, and it grows at an annual rate of 6%. Therefore, the dividend for the next year is:

\[
D_1 = 5 \times (1 + 0.06) = 5 \times 1.06 = 5.30
\]

### Step 2: Plug values into the formula
The required rate of return (\(r\)) is 12% or 0.12, and the growth rate (\(g\)) is 6% or 0.06. Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
P = \frac{5.30}{0.12 - 0.06} = \frac{5.30}{0.06}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the division
\[
P = \frac{5.30}{0.06} = 88.33
\]

### Final Answer
The intrinsic value of the stock is approximately **$88.33**, which corresponds to option **G**.
