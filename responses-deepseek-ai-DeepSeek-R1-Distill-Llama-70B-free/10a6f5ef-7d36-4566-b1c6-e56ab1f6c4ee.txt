Okay, so I have this question about why milk spoils when kept in the refrigerator. Hmm, I remember that milk can spoil even when refrigerated, but I'm not exactly sure why. Let me think this through.

First, I know that refrigeration slows down bacterial growth because most bacteria don't grow well at lower temperatures. But some bacteria are still active in the fridge. Wait, there are different types of bacteria based on the temperatures they like. Like, thermophiles love heat, mesophiles like moderate temperatures, and psychrophiles (or psychrotrophs) prefer colder environments. Oh right, psychrophilic means cold-loving.

So when we store milk in the fridge, it's not that all bacteria die. Some can still grow, just more slowly. These psychrophilic bacteria might be the cause. They might feed on the milk's nutrients and produce waste products, which could cause the milk to spoil by souring or curdling.

Looking at the options, option G is psychrophilic bacteria. That makes sense because those are the ones that can grow in the cold. Option D is mesophiles, which are more active at room temperature, so the fridge would slow them down. So D might not be the main reason when the milk is kept cold.

Other options: A is enzymatic reactions with oxygen. I'm not sure about that. Maybe enzymatic activity can happen, but I think bacterial action is more common for spoilage. B is lactose crystallization—that sounds more like what happens when something like honey crystallizes, not spoilage. C is loss of refrigeration power, which doesn't make sense because the fridge is working. E is natural separation without bacteria. I don't think so; spoilage is usually microbial. F is acidification from light—light might affect some things, but in the fridge, it's dark, and the main issue is bacteria. H is thermophiles, which wouldn't grow in cold. I is chemical reactions—maybe, but probably not the main spoilage cause. J is contamination from other foods—that's possible, but the question is why it spoils when kept in the fridge, implying the cause is something inherent, like the bacteria already present.

So I'm leaning towards option G, psychrophilic bacteria, being the correct answer.

When milk spoils in the refrigerator, it is primarily due to the activity of psychrophilic bacteria. These bacteria thrive in colder environments and can grow slowly in the refrigerator, breaking down the milk's components and causing spoilage. Other options, such as mesophiles (D), are less likely because they prefer warmer temperatures, and thermophiles (H) are inactive in cold environments. Contamination from other foods (J) is a possibility but not the primary reason for spoilage in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G
