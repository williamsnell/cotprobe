Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It asks how much work is done when a mass of 5 kilograms is raised a height of 2 meters. Hmm, I remember from my classes that work done against gravity involves potential energy. Wait, right, when you lift something, you're doing work against the gravitational force, which increases the potential energy of the object.

The formula I think is needed here is the change in gravitational potential energy. Oh right, the formula is ΔPE = mgh, where m is mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height. Oh wait, but what's the value of g? I remember it's approximately 9.8 m/s² on Earth.

So let me plug in the numbers. The mass is 5 kg, the height is 2 meters. So ΔPE would be 5 kg multiplied by 9.8 m/s² multiplied by 2 meters. Let me calculate that step by step. 5 times 9.8 is 49, right? And 49 times 2 is 98. So the work done should be 98 joules.

Looking at the options, option J is 98 joules. So that's the correct answer.

The work done in raising the mass is calculated using the formula for gravitational potential energy, ΔPE = mgh. Substituting the given values (m = 5 kg, g = 9.8 m/s², h = 2 m), the work done is 5 * 9.8 * 2 = 98 joules.

Answer: J
