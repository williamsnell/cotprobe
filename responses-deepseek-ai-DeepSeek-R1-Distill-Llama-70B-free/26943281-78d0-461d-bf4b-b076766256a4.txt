Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all."

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Erasmus and his legacy compared to earlier humanists. Let me read through the passage carefully to understand the context.

The passage is from Johan Huizinga's book about Erasmus. It talks about Erasmus's work, specifically the Adagiorum Collectanea, which was a collection of about 800 Latin proverbs with explanations. The dedication of this work mentions how these proverbs can help writers enhance their style and arguments. But Erasmus's contribution went beyond just providing these sayings; he made the classic spirit more accessible to a wider audience.

Earlier humanists had kind of monopolized classical culture, using their knowledge to show off and become seen as learned elites. Erasmus, on the other hand, wanted to share this knowledge more broadly. He had a strong desire to teach and a love for humanity, which led him to introduce the classic spirit to a larger group of people. However, he wrote in Latin, so his direct influence was mainly on the educated classes, not the general populace.

The question asks why Erasmus's legacy was more significant than earlier humanists. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different reason.

Looking at the options:

A: He wrote exclusively about religious matters. The passage doesn't say this. Erasmus wrote about proverbs and classical culture, so A doesn't seem right.

B: He wrote more books. The passage doesn't mention the quantity of his works compared to others, so B is unlikely.

C: First to translate Latin proverbs. The passage says he elucidated them, but not necessarily translating into vernacular. So maybe not C.

D: More critical of the Church. The passage doesn't discuss his criticism of the Church, so D doesn't fit.

E: Wider variety of interests. The passage doesn't say he had more varied interests, just that he made classical culture more accessible. So E might not be it.

F: Less interested in academic pomp. The passage mentions that earlier humanists paraded their knowledge, but Erasmus was more about teaching. So F could be a possibility, but the main point seems to be about accessibility, not just his personal interest in academia.

G: More Church support. The passage doesn't indicate that, so G is probably not correct.

H: Made classic spirit more accessible by teaching. This aligns with the passage, which says he made the spirit accessible. However, the passage mentions he wrote in Latin, so maybe it's about teaching through his writing.

I: Valued educating masses more. The passage says he introduced the classic spirit among the people, implying he cared more about educating a broader audience than just the elite.

J: Wrote in a language understandable to masses. But he wrote in Latin, which the masses (common people) wouldn't understand. So J is incorrect.

So, narrowing it down. The key point is that Erasmus's work made classical culture more accessible beyond the elite. Earlier humanists kept it exclusive, but Erasmus wanted to share it with a wider audience, even if through Latin, which limited it to the educated classes. But his intent was broader than earlier humanists.

Looking at the options again, option I says he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors. That fits because he wanted the book of antiquity to be open to all, even if practically it was limited to the educated. Option H says he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it, which also fits. But the passage emphasizes his desire to spread knowledge beyond the few, so I think I is the better choice.

Wait, but the passage says he "familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached." So he did make it more accessible, which is option H. Or option I, which is about valuing education of the masses more.

Hmm, the passage says he had an "irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture." So it's about his intent and valuing education for more people. So I think the correct answer is I.

Wait, but the options are about why his legacy was more significant. So the reason is that he made the classics more accessible, which is H, but I says he valued educating the masses more.

Wait, the passage says earlier humanists monopolized the treasures, but Erasmus introduced the classic spirit among the people, even if limited to educated classes. So his intention was broader, making it more accessible. So the legacy is that he made it more accessible, which is H. Alternatively, his valuing education more (I) led to that.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me read the options again.

H: he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it.

I: he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had.

The passage says he "familiarized a much wider circle" and that he had a sincere love for humanity and general culture, implying he valued educating more people. So I think I is the correct choice.

The question asks why Erasmus's legacy was more significant than that of earlier humanists. The passage highlights that earlier humanists monopolized classical culture, using it to showcase their elite knowledge, while Erasmus sought to make the classic spirit more accessible to a broader audience. Although he wrote in Latin, limiting his direct influence to the educated classes, his intent was to share classical knowledge widely. The passage emphasizes Erasmus's "irresistible need of teaching" and his "sincere love for humanity and its general culture," indicating that he valued educating a broader audience more than his predecessors did. This aligns with option I, which captures his commitment to spreading knowledge beyond the elite.

Answer: I
