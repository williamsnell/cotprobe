Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem says: A solution of 20.0 g of a non-volatile solute in 100 g of benzene at 30°C has a vapor pressure 13.4 torr lower than the vapor pressure of pure benzene. The vapor pressure of pure benzene at 30°C is given as 121.8 torr. They're asking for the mole fraction of the solute. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, the vapor pressure of the solvent decreases. The formula that relates the vapor pressure lowering to the mole fraction of the solute is something like... oh right, Raoult's Law. Raoult's Law states that the vapor pressure of the solvent (P) is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent (X_solvent) multiplied by the vapor pressure of the pure solvent (P°). So P = X_solvent * P°. 

Wait, but the problem gives the vapor pressure lowering, which is the difference between the pure solvent's vapor pressure and the solution's vapor pressure. So the lowering, ΔP, is P° - P. According to Raoult's Law, since P = X_solvent * P°, then ΔP = P° - P = P° (1 - X_solvent). But wait, since the solute is non-volatile, the vapor pressure of the solution is just from the solvent. Also, the mole fraction of solute plus the mole fraction of solvent equals 1. So X_solute = 1 - X_solvent.

Let me try to write this down. So, ΔP = P° - P = P° * (1 - X_solvent). But since X_solute = 1 - X_solvent, we can substitute that in. So ΔP = P° * X_solute. Wait no, that can't be right because if X_solute is small, which it is, then ΔP would be small, which it is. Oh wait, no, because X_solute is the mole fraction of the solute, but in Raoult's Law, the lowering is proportional to the mole fraction of the solute. So yes, ΔP = X_solute * P°. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The mole fraction of the solute is X_solute. Since the solution is dilute, X_solute is small. So the vapor pressure lowering, which is 13.4 torr, equals X_solute multiplied by the pure solvent's vapor pressure. So, 13.4 = X_solute * 121.8. Thus, X_solute = 13.4 / 121.8. Let me calculate that.

13.4 divided by 121.8. Let me do this division. 13.4 ÷ 121.8. Hmm, 121.8 is approximately 120, so 13.4/120 is about 0.1117. So X_solute would be approximately 0.1117. Wait, but checking the options, option C is 0.111, which is close. So maybe the answer is C.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because I think the formula is ΔP = X_solute * P°, but I should make sure. Because from Raoult's Law, the vapor pressure of the solution is P = X_solvent * P°. So the lowering is P° - P = P° (1 - X_solvent) = P° * X_solute. Oh yes, because X_solute = 1 - X_solvent. So yes, ΔP = X_solute * P°. So I think I did it right.

Wait, but let's double-check. Let me calculate 13.4 / 121.8 exactly. Let me do that. 13.4 divided by 121.8. Let me compute this: 121.8 × 0.11 is 13.398, which is about 13.4. So 0.11. So 0.11 is approximately the mole fraction. Looking at the options, C is 0.111, which is 0.111. So that's very close. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but another thought: maybe I need to calculate the mole fraction using the actual moles of solute and solvent. Because sometimes the mole fraction is calculated as (moles solute)/(moles solute + moles solvent). Oh, right! Because I assumed that X_solute is equal to ΔP / P°, which comes from Raoult's Law, but perhaps I should compute it via the moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using that formula. Because that formula holds when the solute is non-volatile, which it is. So maybe both approaches should agree. Let me try computing via moles.

Okay, let's compute the moles of solute and solvent. But wait, I don't know the molar mass of the solute. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give it, so perhaps the approach using Raoult's law directly is the correct way, because without the molar mass, I can't compute the mole fraction via moles.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives 20.0 grams of solute, but without knowing its molar mass, I can't find moles. So perhaps the only way is to use the ΔP = X_solute * P° approach, which gives X_solute = 13.4 / 121.8 ≈ 0.11. So answer C is 0.111, which matches.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The solution is made by dissolving 20g of solute in 100g benzene. Benzene's molar mass is 78.11 g/mol. So the moles of benzene would be 100g /78.11 g/mol ≈ 1.28 moles.

But without the molar mass of the solute, I can't find its moles. Therefore, I can't compute the mole fraction via the mole ratio. So the only approach is using the vapor pressure lowering formula, which gives X_solute ≈ 0.11, which is option C.

Wait, but why did I think about mole fraction as moles solute divided by total moles then? Because if I had the molar mass, I could compute it that way. But since I don't, I have to rely on the ΔP method.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the solution's vapor pressure. Let me make sure.

So, pure benzene's vapor pressure is 121.8 torr. The solution's vapor pressure is 121.8 -13.4 = 108.4 torr.

According to Raoult's Law, P_solution = X_solvent * P_pure. So X_solvent = P_solution / P_pure = 108.4 / 121.8 ≈ 0.89.

Wait, that's X_solvent. Then X_solute is 1 - 0.89 = 0.11, which matches what I got before. So that's consistent.

So the mole fraction of the solute is approximately 0.11, which is option C: 0.111. So I think the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we use Raoult's Law, which states that the vapor pressure of a solvent in a solution is proportional to the mole fraction of the solvent. The vapor pressure lowering, ΔP, is related to the mole fraction of the solute, \( X_{\text{solute}} \), by the equation:

\[
\Delta P = X_{\text{solute}} \cdot P^\circ
\]

Here, \( \Delta P \) is the vapor pressure lowering (13.4 torr), and \( P^\circ \) is the vapor pressure of pure benzene (121.8 torr). Rearranging the equation to solve for \( X_{\text{solute}} \):

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{\Delta P}{P^\circ}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{13.4}{121.8} \approx 0.111
\]

This calculation shows that the mole fraction of the solute is approximately 0.111. Among the given options, the closest value is **C: 0.111**. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
