Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the net price of a water pump Herbie bought. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the list price is $40. That's the original price before any discounts. Then there's a trade discount of $16. I remember that a trade discount is like a reduction given to wholesalers or retailers when they buy something, so it's subtracted from the list price to get the net price. 

So the formula, if I'm not mistaken, should be net price = list price - trade discount. That makes sense because the discount is deducted to find the actual price Herbie has to pay. 

Let me plug in the numbers. The list price is $40, and the discount is $16. So 40 minus 16 is... 24. So the net price should be $24. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes there are other discounts or different ways to calculate, but in this case, the problem seems straightforward. It's a simple subtraction because the discount is a flat $16 off the list price. 

Looking back at the options, E is $24. So I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any other calculations needed here, so I'm pretty confident.

The net price is calculated by subtracting the trade discount from the list price. 

Net price = List price - Trade discount  
Net price = $40 - $16 = $24  

The correct answer is E: $24.
