Okay, so I've got this question here about a 3 input NAND gate and the number of entries in its truth table. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my logic gates, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that a truth table shows all possible combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs for a logic circuit. For each input, there are two possibilities: 0 or 1. So if there are multiple inputs, the total number of combinations would be 2 raised to the power of the number of inputs.

Wait, the question is about a 3 input NAND gate. So the number of inputs is 3. That means each input can be either 0 or 1. To find the total number of possible input combinations, I should calculate 2^3. Let me do that: 2 times 2 is 4, times another 2 is 8. So 8 possible combinations.

Each of these combinations will have a row in the truth table. So the truth table will have 8 entries. Now I need to look at the options provided.

Looking at the options, option H is 8. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, just to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me double-check.

Another way to think about it: for each input added, the number of possible combinations doubles. So with 1 input, it's 2 entries. 2 inputs would be 4, and 3 inputs would be 8. Yep, that makes sense.

So the truth table for a 3-input NAND gate has 8 entries. Therefore, the correct answer is H.

The number of entries in the truth table of a logic gate is determined by the formula \( 2^n \), where \( n \) is the number of inputs. For a 3-input NAND gate, the number of possible input combinations is \( 2^3 = 8 \). Therefore, the truth table will have 8 entries.

Option H corresponds to 8, which is the correct answer.

Answer: H
