Question:

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says that events A, B, and C are mutually independent. Oh right, mutual independence means that the occurrence of one doesn't affect the others. So for independent events, the probability that all of them happen is just the product of their individual probabilities. 

Alright, the probabilities given are P(A) = 0.5, P(B) = 0.8, and P(C) = 0.9. I think I need to multiply these together to find the probability that all three occur. Let me do the math. 

So 0.5 times 0.8 is 0.4. Then I multiply that by 0.9. Wait, 0.4 times 0.9... let's see. 0.4 * 0.9 is 0.36, right? Because 0.4 times 0.9 is like 4 times 9, which is 36, and then we add two decimal places (since 0.4 has one, 0.9 has one, so total two). Yep, 0.36.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.36. So that should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Since the events are independent, multiplying their probabilities gives the correct joint probability.

To determine the probability that all three mutually independent events \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) occur, we multiply their individual probabilities:

\[
P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \cdot P(C)
\]

Given \( P(A) = 0.5 \), \( P(B) = 0.8 \), and \( P(C) = 0.9 \), we calculate:

\[
P(A \cap B \cap C) = 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.9 = 0.36
\]

Thus, the probability that all three events occur is \( 0.36 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
