Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about what Smith & Tomlinson argued. I'm a bit rusty on my sociology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me options from A to J, each making a different claim about their argument. I remember that Smith & Tomlinson did some work related to educational achievement and factors influencing it, like class, gender, and ethnicity.

I think their research was about how different factors predict educational outcomes. I recall that some studies suggest that while factors like gender and ethnicity play a role, social class is often the most significant. But wait, was that Smith & Tomlinson specifically?

Wait, I think they looked into the impact of race and ethnicity. They might have found that ethnic background was a significant factor but possibly not the most important. Or was it the other way around?

Let me try to break down the options. 

Option A says ethnic background was more significant than class or gender. I'm not sure if they said it was more significant than class. I thought class was a big factor.

Option B claims social class was the most significant. I think this might be correct because I remember reading that class is a major determinant. But I'm not certain if Smith & Tomlinson specifically said that.

Option E says ethnic background was less significant than class or gender. That sounds plausible because class often is a stronger predictor. So maybe E is correct?

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up different studies. I remember reading that in some cases, ethnic background can have a significant impact, but it's often in conjunction with class factors. So perhaps Smith & Tomlinson argued that class is more important.

Alternatively, I think they might have found that all three factors—class, gender, and ethnicity—play roles, but class is the most significant.

Looking at the options again, option B says social class was the most significant. Option E says ethnic background is less significant than class or gender. So if class is the most significant, then E would make sense if ethnic is less than class, but maybe gender is also a factor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the specific study. Smith & Tomlinson's work from what I remember focused on how different factors interact. They might have concluded that while all factors matter, class is the strongest.

Alternatively, I might be confusing them with another study. Wait, another thought: I think they found that when controlling for social class, the impact of ethnicity decreases. So class is a bigger factor.

So looking again, option B says social class was the most significant. Option E says ethnic background is less than class or gender. So if class is more significant than both, then E would say ethnic is less than both, which would include class being more significant than ethnic.

Wait, but option B says social class was the most significant factor. So if class is the most significant, then options that say class is more important than others would be correct.

So between B and E, which one is it? Or another option altogether.

Wait, another angle: I think Smith & Tomlinson found that ethnic background was a significant predictor, but when class was considered, its impact was reduced. So class is more important.

So in that case, option E says ethnic background was less significant than class or gender. So if class is more significant than ethnic, but what about gender?

Alternatively, if class was the most significant, then option B would say that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the options are suggesting.

Option B: social class was the most significant. So if that's the case, then that's the answer.

But I think I might be mixing this up with another study. Wait, another approach: I think in some studies, it's found that class is the main factor, but gender and ethnicity also have their own effects. So Smith & Tomlinson might have argued that class is the most significant.

So I'm leaning towards option B. But I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, another thought: I remember that in the 1980s, some studies found that when class is controlled, the impact of ethnicity on achievement becomes negligible. So Smith & Tomlinson's work might support that, meaning class is more important.

So if that's the case, then option B would be correct.

Alternatively, if the question was about more recent studies showing that ethnicity also plays a role, perhaps E would be correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to make a decision.

I think the correct answer is B: social class was the most significant factor.

But wait, another possibility is option E, which states that ethnic background was less significant than class or gender. So if class is the most significant, then ethnic is less than class, but what about gender? If gender is also significant, perhaps more than ethnic.

Wait, but I'm not sure if Smith & Tomlinson made that specific comparison.

Alternatively, I think I've heard that Smith & Tomlinson found that ethnic background was less significant than class. So option E says ethnic is less than class or gender. So if class is more significant than ethnic, but what about gender? If gender is also more significant than ethnic, then E would be correct.

I think I'm getting too confused. Maybe I should look for the correct answer.

Wait, I think the correct answer is E. Because I remember that in their study, when controlling for social class, the effect of ethnicity was reduced. So ethnic background was less significant than class.

But then, what about gender? If gender is also a factor, then E says ethnic is less than both, which would fit.

Alternatively, option B says class is the most significant, which would also be correct if class is the top factor.

I'm a bit torn between B and E.

Wait, another angle: the question is about what Smith & Tomlinson argued. So perhaps they argued that class was the most significant, making B correct.

Alternatively, if their argument was that ethnic differences were less important than class and gender, then E would be correct.

I think I'm going to go with B: social class was the most significant factor.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident. Maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because I've read that in their study, they found that social class was more important than ethnic background in determining educational achievement.

So if E says that ethnic background was less significant than class or gender, that would fit.

Wait, but does E say that? Let me read option E again.

E: ethnic background was less significant than class or gender in predicting educational achievement.

Yes, that's what E says.

So if Smith & Tomlinson found that class was more significant than ethnic background, then E would be correct, because ethnic is less than class. But what about gender? If gender is also a factor, then ethnic is less than both.

Alternatively, perhaps they found that class is more significant than both gender and ethnic.

So in that case, E would be correct because ethnic is less than both class and gender.

But I'm not sure about the role of gender in their findings.

Alternatively, perhaps they found that class was more significant than ethnic, but didn't compare to gender. So I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: I've read that in the 1980s, studies like Smith & Tomlinson's found that social class was the most important factor, and that ethnic differences were less significant once class was accounted for.

So that would suggest that option B is correct, because class is the most significant.

But I'm not entirely certain. I think I'm going to have to make a guess here.

I think the correct answer is E: ethnic background was less significant than class or gender.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's more specific about the comparison between ethnic and the other factors.

I think I'm going to go with option E as the answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might have mixed up the findings.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because Smith & Tomlinson found that ethnic background was less significant than class. So E states that ethnic is less than class or gender, which would mean class is more significant, which aligns with their findings.

So I think the correct answer is E.

The question asks about Smith & Tomlinson's argument regarding factors influencing educational achievement. After considering the options and reflecting on their research, Smith & Tomlinson's work suggests that while ethnic background plays a role, social class is the most significant factor. However, option E states that ethnic background was less significant than class or gender, which aligns with the idea that class is more important than ethnicity. Given this reasoning, the correct answer is:

E: ethnic background was less significant than class or gender in predicting educational achievement.
