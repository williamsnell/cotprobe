Okay, so I've got this problem about a shunt motor, and I'm supposed to figure out the answers for parts (a) and (b). Let me try to break it down step by step.

Starting with part (a). The question is about a shunt motor running at 1200 rpm under a load that requires 50 amps of armature current from a 230-volt source. At no load, the armature current is 5 amps. Also, the armature resistance is 0.15 ohms. The effect of armature reaction has reduced the air-gap flux by 2% from no-load to full load. I need to find the no-load speed.

Hmm, I remember that in shunt motors, the flux is mainly determined by the shunt field current. Since the shunt field is connected across the supply voltage, the field current remains roughly the same whether the motor is loaded or not. But wait, the question says that the armature reaction reduces the air-gap flux by 2%. So the flux isn't exactly the same at full load as it is at no load. That's important because flux affects the induced voltage and hence the speed.

The speed of a DC motor is given by N = (V - I_a R_a) / (k φ), where k is a constant, φ is the flux per pole, V is the supply voltage, I_a is the armature current, and R_a is the armature resistance.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the formula I remember is N = (V - I_a R_a) / (k φ). But more accurately, the induced back EMF E is E = V - I_a R_a, and E is also equal to k φ N, so N = E / (k φ) = (V - I_a R_a) / (k φ). So if the flux changes, that would affect the speed.

At no load, the armature current I_a is 5 A. Under full load, it's 50 A. So, first, I think I need to find the induced EMF at full load and no load.

Wait, but the flux is different in each case. Let me define some variables.

Let me denote:

At full load:
I_a_full = 50 A
V = 230 V
R_a = 0.15 Ω
E_full = V - I_a_full * R_a = 230 - 50 * 0.15 = 230 - 7.5 = 222.5 V.

At no load:
I_a_no = 5 A
E_no = V - I_a_no * R_a = 230 - 5 * 0.15 = 230 - 0.75 = 229.25 V.

Now, the flux at full load is 2% less than at no load. So φ_full = φ_no * (1 - 0.02) = 0.98 φ_no.

Now, the speed is N = E / (k φ). Let me think about the relationship between the speeds at full load and no load.

At full load, N_full = 1200 rpm = E_full / (k φ_full)
At no load, N_no = E_no / (k φ_no)

So, N_full = (222.5) / (k * 0.98 φ_no)
N_no = (229.25) / (k φ_no)

I can write N_full in terms of N_no. Let's see:

N_full = (222.5) / (0.98 φ_no k ) = (222.5 / 0.98) * (1/(k φ_no)) ) = (222.5/0.98) * (N_no / 229.25 )

Wait, because N_no is (229.25)/(k φ_no), so 1/(k φ_no) ) = N_no / 229.25.

So substituting:

N_full = (222.5 / 0.98) * (N_no / 229.25)

I can compute this:

222.5 / 0.98 ≈ 227.551 (since 222.5 * 100/98 = 2225/98 ≈ 227.551)
Then, 227.551 / 229.25 ≈ 0.9926.

So N_full ≈ 0.9926 * N_no.

But wait, N_full is given as 1200 rpm.

So, 1200 = 0.9926 * N_no

So N_no ≈ 1200 / 0.9926 ≈ ?

Calculating that: 1200 / 0.9926 ≈ 1200 * (1/0.9926) ≈ 1200 * 1.0075 ≈ 1209 rpm.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

0.9926 is approximately 0.9926. 1/0.9926 = approx 1.0075.

1200 * 1.0075 = 1200 + (1200 * 0.0075) = 1200 + 9 = 1209 rpm.

So the no-load speed is approximately 1209 rpm. But wait, the options don't have 1209. Let me check my calculations again, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

222.5 / 0.98 = ?

222.5 divided by 0.98:

Compute 222.5 / 0.98.

0.98 * 227 = 222.46. So 0.98 * 227.551 ≈ 222.5.

So 222.5 / 0.98 = 227.551 as before.

Then, 227.551 / 229.25 = ?

Let me calculate 227.551 ÷ 229.25.

229.25 is approximately 229.25, so 227.551 / 229.25 ≈ 0.9926.

So 0.9926 * N_no = 1200 → N_no = 1200 / 0.9926 ≈ 1209 rpm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option F: 1250, or option E:1230, or maybe none. Wait, the options are:

A:1000, B:1300, C:1220, D:1280, E:1230, F:1250, G:1150, H:1211, I:1180, J:1100.

Hmm, 1209 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe using the relationship between the EMFs and the speeds, considering the flux change.

Alternative approach: The flux at full load is 0.98 times that at no load. So, φ_full = 0.98 φ_no.

But E is proportional to φ*N, because E = k φ N. So, for the same voltage V, the EMF at full load is E_full = V - I_a_full * R_a, and similarly for no load.

Wait, but the speed is N = (V - I_a R_a) / (k φ). So, for full load, N_full = (V - I_a_full R_a) / (k φ_full) = (222.5) / (k * 0.98 φ_no )

At no load, N_no = (V - I_a_no R_a ) / (k φ_no ) = (229.25) / (k φ_no )

So, let me write N_full in terms of N_no.

N_full = (222.5) / (0.98 k φ_no ) = (222.5 / 0.98) * (1/(k φ_no )) = (222.5/0.98) * (N_no / 229.25 )

Which is the same as before. So N_full = [222.5/(0.98 * 229.25)] * N_no.

Wait, 222.5/(0.98 * 229.25) = 222.5 / (224.791) ≈ 0.989.

So 0.989 * N_no = 1200 → N_no ≈ 1200 / 0.989 ≈ 1212.5 rpm.

Hmm, that's about 1213 rpm. Again, not matching any options exactly. The closest option is H:1211, which is 1211 rpm. So perhaps I should consider that.

But wait, let me think: maybe the way I'm accounting for the flux change is incorrect. Because the armature reaction reduces the air-gap flux by 2%. So, at full load, the flux is 98% of no load. So, the no load flux is higher than full load.

Wait, but how does that affect the EMF?

Wait, the EMF is E = k φ N. So, if flux decreases, for the same speed N, E would be lower. But in our case, the speed is changing as well.

Wait, no. At full load, the flux is lower, so for the same E, the speed would be higher, but in reality, the E is V - I_a R_a, which is lower than V.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of speeds.

Let me define:

E_full = 222.5 V
E_no = 229.25 V

φ_full = 0.98 φ_no.

Now, E = k φ N → N = E/(k φ).

So,

N_full = E_full / (k φ_full ) = E_full / (k * 0.98 φ_no )

N_no = E_no / (k φ_no )

So, N_full = (E_full / E_no ) * (1/0.98 ) * N_no

Because:

N_full = [ E_full / (k φ_full) ] = [ E_full / (k *0.98 φ_no) ) ] = (E_full / E_no ) * (E_no / (k φ_no )) ) * (1/0.98 )

E_no/(k φ_no) is N_no. So:

N_full = (E_full / E_no ) * (1/0.98 ) * N_no

So,

N_full = (222.5 / 229.25 ) * (1/0.98 ) * N_no

Compute 222.5 / 229.25 first. Let me calculate that.

222.5 ÷ 229.25 ≈ 0.9706.

Then, 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

Multiply 0.9706 * 1.0204 ≈ 0.9911.

So,

N_full ≈ 0.9911 * N_no.

We know N_full is 1200 rpm. So,

1200 = 0.9911 * N_no → N_no = 1200 / 0.9911 ≈ 1211 rpm.

Ah, that's about 1211 rpm. Looking at the options, option H is 1211 rpm. So that's a possible answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation:

Compute 222.5 / 229.25.

Compute 222.5 ÷ 229.25.

229.25 goes into 222.5 how many times? It's less than 1. Let me compute 222.5 / 229.25.

Well, 229.25 ≈ 229.25, so 229.25 - 222.5 = 6.75.

So 222.5 / 229.25 = (229.25 - 6.75) / 229.25 = 1 - (6.75/229.25) ≈ 1 - 0.02945 ≈ 0.97055.

Then, 1/0.98 ≈ 1.020408.

Multiply 0.97055 * 1.020408 = ?

0.97055 * 1 = 0.97055

0.97055 * 0.020408 = approximately 0.0198.

So total ≈ 0.97055 + 0.0198 ≈ 0.99035.

So N_full ≈ 0.99035 * N_no.

Thus, N_no ≈ 1200 / 0.99035 ≈ 1200 * 1.0097 ≈ 1211.7 rpm.

Approximately 1212 rpm. So the closest option is H:1211 rpm.

So part (a)'s answer is 1211 rpm, which is option H.

Now, moving on to part (b).

The rated line current is 56 A. The shunt field resistance is 230 ohms, and armature resistance is 0.15 ohms. The question is, when the motor is at standstill (i.e., starting), connected to rated voltage, what's the line current? Also, how much external resistance is needed to limit the starting current to 125% of full-load armature current.

Wait, the full-load armature current is 50 A as given in part (a). So 125% of that is 62.5 A.

But wait, in part (b), the rated line current is 56 A. Hmm, perhaps under full load, the line current is 56 A. But wait, the line current is the sum of the shunt field current and the armature current, right?

Wait, in a shunt motor, the line current I_line = I_shunt + I_armature.

But wait, no, wait: The shunt field is connected in parallel with the armature. So the line current is the sum of the shunt current and the armature current.

Wait, but in a shunt motor, the shunt field is across the supply, so I_shunt = V / R_shunt = 230 / 230 = 1 A.

So, I_shunt is 1 A regardless of the load, because R_shunt is 230 ohms.

So, when the motor is running at full load, the armature current is I_a = 50 A, so the line current is I_line = I_shunt + I_a = 1 + 50 = 51 A.

Wait, but the question says the rated line current is 56 A. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Because in part (a), the full load armature current is 50 A, which would make the line current 51 A. But the question says the rated line current is 56 A. So perhaps the rated line current corresponds to a different armature current. Maybe I'm getting confused between rated line current and full load.

Wait, perhaps part (a) is a specific case, and part (b) is a different scenario. Let me re-read part (b).

Part (b) says: The rated line current of a 230-volt shunt motor is 56 amp. If the shunt-field circuit resistance is 230 ohms and the armature circuit resistance is 0.15 ohm, what would be the line current, assuming that the motor, at standstill, is connected across rated voltage? How much external resistance must be connected in the armature circuit to limit the current at starting to 125 percent full-load armature current.

Wait, so in part (b), the full-load armature current is I_a_fl = I_line_fl - I_shunt.

Since I_shunt = 230 V / 230 Ω = 1 A. So I_line_fl = 56 A, so I_a_fl = 56 - 1 = 55 A.

Wait, no. Wait, the line current is the sum of the shunt current and the armature current. So, I_line = I_shunt + I_armature.

At full load, I_line is 56 A, so I_armature_fl = 56 - 1 = 55 A.

So, 55 A is the full-load armature current in part (b).

Now, the first question is, what is the line current when the motor is at standstill (starting), connected to rated voltage.

At standstill, the speed is zero, so the back EMF is zero. So the armature current would be I_a_start = V / (R_a + R_ext), where R_ext is any external resistance. But if no external resistance is added, R_ext is zero.

Wait, the question is, what is the line current when the motor is at standstill, connected across rated voltage, without any external resistance. So, the armature resistance is 0.15 Ω. So the starting current would be I_a_start = 230 V / 0.15 Ω ≈ 1533.33 A.

So the line current would be I_line_start = I_shunt + I_a_start = 1 + 1533.33 ≈ 1534.33 A. Looking at the options, option H has line current 1534 A. So that's a possible match.

But wait, the second part of the question is: How much external resistance must be connected in the armature circuit to limit the current at starting to 125 percent full-load armature current.

Full-load armature current is 55 A, so 125% is 68.75 A.

So, the starting current should be limited to 68.75 A. So, the total resistance in the armature circuit at start should be R_total = V / I_a_start_limit.

So R_total = 230 V / 68.75 A ≈ 3.3467 Ω.

But the armature resistance is 0.15 Ω, so the external resistance needed is R_ext = R_total - R_armature = 3.3467 - 0.15 ≈ 3.1967 Ω. Approximately 3.2 Ω.

Looking at the options, option H has external resistance 3.2 Ω.

So part (b) line current at start without external resistance is approximately 1534 A, and external resistance needed is 3.2 Ω. So the option that matches is H.

So, putting it all together, part (a) no-load speed is 1211 rpm, part (b) line current is 1534 A, and external resistance is 3.2 Ω, which is option H.
</think>

### Solution:

#### Part (a):
The problem involves determining the no-load speed of a shunt motor. The motor runs at 1200 rpm under full load, drawing an armature current of 50 A from a 230 V supply. At no load, the armature current is 5 A, and the armature resistance is 0.15 Ω. The air-gap flux decreases by 2% from no load to full load due to armature reaction.

1. **Induced EMF at Full Load and No Load**:
   - At full load:  
     \[
     E_{\text{full}} = V - I_a R_a = 230 - (50)(0.15) = 222.5 \, \text{V}
     \]
   - At no load:  
     \[
     E_{\text{no}} = V - I_a R_a = 230 - (5)(0.15) = 229.25 \, \text{V}
     \]

2. **Flux Relationship**:
   - The flux
