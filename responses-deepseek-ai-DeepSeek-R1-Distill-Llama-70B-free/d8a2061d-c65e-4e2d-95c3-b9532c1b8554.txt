Okay, so I have this physics problem about lenses and their power in different mediums. Hmm, I remember that the power of a lens depends on the refractive index of the surrounding medium. Let me think about what I know.

The problem says it's an aplano-convex lens in air with a power of 5 diopters. I need to find its power when it's in water. The refractive index of the glass is 1.60. Wait, aplano-convex means one side is flat and the other is convex. Oh right, so the flat side is probably the plano part, so it's a convex lens with one flat surface.

I remember the lensmaker's formula, which is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where n is the refractive index of the lens material relative to the surrounding medium. Oh wait, right! When the lens is in a different medium like water, the effective refractive index changes because it's the ratio of the lens material to the medium.

So normally, in air, the refractive index of air is approximately 1. So for a convex lens in air, the formula would be 1/f_air = (n_glass - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). But when it's submerged in water, the surrounding medium's refractive index is higher. Water has a refractive index around 1.33, if I remember correctly.

So the power in water would be calculated using (n_glass/n_water - 1) instead of (n_glass -1). Because the formula uses the relative refractive index. So the new power P_water would be based on (1.60/1.33 -1) times the same (1/R1 -1/R2) factor.

Wait, but wait, the original power in air is given as 5 diopters. So I can relate the two. Let me think about it. The power is inversely proportional to the focal length, so P = 1/f.

In air, P_air = (n_air -1) * C, where C is that (1/R1 - 1/R2) term. In water, P_water = (n_water_rel -1) * C, where n_water_rel is n_glass / n_water.

So if I take the ratio, P_water / P_air = (n_water_rel -1) / (n_air -1). Since in air, n_air is 1, so denominator is (n_glass -1).

So substituting the numbers: n_glass is 1.60, n_water is 1.33. So n_water_rel is 1.60 / 1.33 ≈ 1.2025, approximately. So n_water_rel -1 is about 0.2025.

In air, the term (n_glass -1) is 0.60. So the ratio is 0.2025 / 0.60 ≈ 0.3375.

So P_water = P_air * 0.3375. Since P_air is 5 diopters, then P_water = 5 * 0.3375 = 1.6875 diopters.

Wait, looking at the options, there's option G which is 1.67 diopters. That's close to my calculation. So perhaps the exact calculation would give 1.67.

Let me compute it more accurately. 1.60 divided by 1.33 equals approximately 1.60 / 1.333 is 1.20, wait, but 1.333 is 4/3, so 1.6 / (4/3) = (1.6 * 3)/4 = 4.8/4 = 1.2. Oh wait, that's not right because 1.333 is 4/3, so 1.6 divided by (4/3) is 1.6 * 3/4 = 1.2. So n_water_rel is 1.2. Then, 1.2 -1 is 0.2. So the ratio is 0.2 / 0.6 = 1/3. Wait that can't be right.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me redo it.

n_glass = 1.60, n_water = 1.33.

So in air: (n_glass -1) = 0.6.

In water: (n_glass/n_water) -1 = (1.60/1.33) -1.

Calculate 1.60 / 1.33. Let's compute that:

1.60 ÷ 1.33. Well, 1.33 times 1 is 1.33, 1.2 times 1.33 is 1.596 (since 1.2 *1.33= (1 +0.2)*1.33=1.33 + 0.266=1.596). So 1.60 is a bit higher than that. So 1.60/1.33 ≈ 1.2015.

So 1.2015 -1 = 0.2015.

So the ratio P_water / P_air = 0.2015 / 0.6 ≈ 0.3358.

So 0.3358 times 5 diopters is approximately 1.679 diopters, which is about 1.68. Looking at the options, option G is 1.67, which is the closest.

Wait, but let me check if I did the ratio correctly. Because the lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n_rel -1) * (1/R1 -1/R2). So the power, which is 1/f, is proportional to (n_rel -1). So P_water = P_air * (n_water_rel -1)/(n_air_rel -1).

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the power in air is 5 D. So (n_glass -1) = 0.6. In water, (n_glass / n_water -1) = (1.6/1.33 -1) ≈ (1.2015 -1) = 0.2015. So the power becomes 5 * (0.2015/0.6) = 5 * 0.3358 ≈ 1.679, which is ~1.68 D. So the closest option is G:1.67.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.6 divided by 1.33 exactly.

1.33 is 133/100. So 1.6 is 16/10 = 8/5.

So 8/5 divided by 133/100 = (8/5) * (100/133) = (8 * 20) / 133 = 160 / 133 ≈ 1.20150376.

So 1.20150376 -1 = 0.20150376.

So (0.20150376)/(0.6) = 0.20150376 / 0.6 = 0.3358396.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.3358396 ≈ 1.679198.

So approximately 1.68 diopters. The option G is 1.67, which is the closest. So probably, the intended answer is G.

Wait, but looking through the options, option I is 2.0. Hmm, no, because 1.68 is closer to 1.67 than to 2.0. So option G is correct.

To determine the power of the aplano-convex lens in water, we use the lensmaker's formula and account for the change in the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The power of a lens is given by:

\[
P = \frac{1}{f} = (n_{\text{rel}} - 1) \cdot C
\]

where \(n_{\text{rel}}\) is the relative refractive index of the lens material with respect to the surrounding medium, and \(C = \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\) is a constant for the lens geometry.

### Step 1: Power in Air
In air, the refractive index of air is approximately 1, so the relative refractive index is:

\[
n_{\text{air}} = n_{\text{glass}} = 1.60
\]

The power in air is given as:

\[
P_{\text{air}} = (n_{\text{glass}} - 1) \cdot C = 5 \, \text{diopters}
\]

### Step 2: Power in Water
When the lens is submerged in water, the relative refractive index becomes:

\[
n_{\text{water,rel}} = \frac{n_{\text{glass}}}{n_{\text{water}}} = \frac{1.60}{1.33} \approx 1.2015
\]

The power in water is then:

\[
P_{\text{water}} = (n_{\text{water,rel}} - 1) \cdot C
\]

The ratio of the power in water to the power in air is:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{water}}}{P_{\text{air}}} = \frac{n_{\text{water,rel}} - 1}{n_{\text{glass}} - 1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{water}}}{P_{\text{air}}} = \frac{1.2015 - 1}{1.60 - 1} = \frac{0.2015}{0.60} \approx 0.3358
\]

Thus:

\[
P_{\text{water}} = P_{\text{air}} \cdot 0.3358 = 5 \cdot 0.3358 \approx 1.679 \, \text{diopters}
\]

### Step 3: Closest Option
The calculated power in water is approximately \(1.68 \, \text{diopters}\). Among the given options, the closest value is **1.67 diopters**.

G
