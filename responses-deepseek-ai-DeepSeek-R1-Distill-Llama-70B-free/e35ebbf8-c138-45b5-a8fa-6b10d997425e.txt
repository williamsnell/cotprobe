Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Osman test from the European Court of Human Rights case Osman v UK (1998). Hmm, I remember that this case is about the positive obligations of states under the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 2 which deals with the right to life.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is NOT part of the Osman test. The options are A, B, C, D.

Let me try to recall what the Osman test entails. From what I remember, the test sets out when a state can be held liable for failing to protect someone from a risk. The key elements are:

1. The risk must be real and imminent. So, not just any risk, but one that's actually going to happen soon.
2. The state (or its agents) must know or ought to have known about this risk. So, they have to have actual or constructive knowledge.
3. Once they know, the state should have taken reasonable steps to prevent the harm. It's not that they have to succeed, but their actions must be reasonable in trying to prevent it.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The risk must emanate from a state agent. Wait, in the Osman case, the risk was from a third party, a teacher who was obsessed with the applicant. So the state's responsibility was because they didn't protect despite knowing, but the risk itself wasn't from a state agent. So maybe the test doesn't require the risk to come from a state agent. So if an option says the risk must come from a state agent, that's not correct.

Option B: If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm). That aligns with the first element I remembered, so B is part of the test.

Option C: A state should take reasonable steps. That's definitely part of the test, so C is included.

Option D: A state knows or ought to have known. That's the second element I thought of, so D is part.

So the one that's not part is A, because the risk doesn't have to come from a state agent. It can come from a third party, and the state is still obligated to protect if they knew or should have known and failed to take reasonable steps.

The Osman test, established in the case of Osman v UK (1998), sets out the criteria for determining when a state can be held liable for failing to protect individuals from risks under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The test includes the following elements:

1. The risk must be real and imminent.  
2. The state must know or ought to have known about the risk.  
3. The state should have taken reasonable steps to prevent the harm.  

Analyzing the options:  

- **Option A** states that the risk must emanate from a state agent. This is incorrect because the Osman test does not require the risk to originate from a state agent; it can come from a third party.  
- **Option B** refers to a real and imminent risk, which is a key part of the test.  
- **Option C** emphasizes that the state should take reasonable steps to prevent harm, which is also part of the test.  
- **Option D** highlights that the state must know or ought to have known about the risk, another essential element of the test.  

Thus, the statement that is **not** part of the Osman test is **Option A**.  

Answer: A
