Okay, so I've got this audit question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about what an auditor of a nonissuer should design tests of details to ensure. The options are from A to J.

Alright, I remember that in auditing, there's a difference between tests of controls and tests of details. Tests of controls are about evaluating the design and effectiveness of internal controls, right? So that's probably related to assessing control risk. Tests of details, on the other hand, are substantive tests. Their purpose is to detect material misstatements in the financial statements.

Wait, the question is about the purpose of tests of details. So the auditor is trying to get sufficient audit evidence to support something. Let me think about what that something is. The options that come to mind are related to financial statements being free from material misstatement. Because that's the main goal of a financial audit.

Looking at the options, option F is "The financial statements are free from material misstatement." That sounds right. Tests of details like account balances and transactions help the auditor gather evidence that supports the financial statements' accuracy, ensuring they're not materially misstated.

Option A talks about the planned level of assurance at the assertion level. Assurance levels are more about the overall audit risk and how it's managed, but I'm not sure if that's directly what tests of details are for.

Option B is about detection risk. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor's procedures won't detect a misstatement. Tests of details would affect detection risk because they're substantive tests. But the question is asking what the tests are designed to support, not what risk they affect.

Option C is about the effectiveness of the organization's risk management. That seems more related to management's responsibilities and perhaps internal audit, not directly what tests of details are for.

Option D mentions management's assertions about internal controls. Tests of details aren't primarily about internal controls; that's more tests of controls. So D might not be the right answer.

Option E is about future profitability. That's a forward-looking statement, and audits typically focus on past financial statements, not future ones. So E is probably not it.

Option F again is about financial statements being free from material misstatement. That aligns with what I remember about substantive tests.

Option G is about control risk, which ties back to tests of controls, not details.

Option H is about compliance with laws. That's more of a regulatory audit or a compliance audit, not the main focus of financial statement audits unless it's a specific compliance audit.

Option I is about the accuracy of financial reporting, which is similar to F. Wait, aren't F and I both about financial statements being correct? Hmm. Let me think. The question asks what tests of details support. Tests of details are substantive procedures that directly test account balances and transactions, which supports the financial statements being free from material misstatements. So F and I might be similar, but I think F is broader.

Option J is about the effectiveness of internal controls, which again is tests of controls, not details.

So putting it all together, the tests of details are designed to ensure that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. So the answer should be F.

The purpose of tests of details in an audit is to gather sufficient audit evidence to support the conclusion that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. These tests are substantive procedures that focus on account balances and transactions to detect any material errors or fraud. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While assurance levels relate to audit risk, tests of details specifically target financial statement accuracy, not assurance levels.
- **B**: Detection risk is influenced by tests of details, but the tests themselves are not designed to support this risk directly.
- **C**: Risk management effectiveness is not the focus of tests of details.
- **D**: Internal control assertions are evaluated through tests of controls, not tests of details.
- **E**: Future profitability is outside the scope of historical financial audits.
- **F**: This aligns with the purpose of tests of details, as they ensure financial statements are free from material misstatement.
- **G**: Control risk is assessed through tests of controls.
- **H**: Compliance with laws is more relevant to regulatory audits.
- **I**: While related, F is broader and more precise in describing the purpose of tests of details.
- **J**: Internal control effectiveness is evaluated through tests of controls.

Thus, the correct answer is **F**, as tests of details are designed to ensure the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

Answer: F
