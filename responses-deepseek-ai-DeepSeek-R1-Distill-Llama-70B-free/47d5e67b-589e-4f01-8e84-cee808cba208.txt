Question:

The owner of a large family estate decided to sell the property. The owner entered into a valid written brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. According to terms of the agreement, the broker promised to undertake best efforts to sell the estate for a purchase price of not less than $1,250,000. The contract also provided that the broker was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The brokerage agreement was effective for a period of two months. One month later, the broker notified the owner that she had found a buyer who wanted to purchase the property for $1,500,000. That same day, the broker handed the owner a real estate sales contract, signed by the buyer, in which the buyer agreed to pay $1,500,000 for the purchase of the estate. The owner investigated the buyer and discovered he had sufficient funds to purchase the estate. However, the owner changed his mind and decided not to sell the property. He told the broker that he would not sign the agreement. In addition, the owner told the broker that he was canceling their brokerage agreement because he was withdrawing the estate from the market. The owner also refused to pay the broker any commission. If the broker now sues the owner for breach of contract, which of the following, if anything, is the broker's proper measure of recovery?

Options:

A: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, plus punitive damages for breach of contract.
B: Nothing, because the owner has the right to withdraw the property from the market at any time.
C: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since all conditions precedent to the owner's duty to pay the commission were fulfilled when the broker produced a buyer who was ready, willing and able to perform.
D: The broker can seek recovery for any expenses incurred during the process of finding a buyer.
E: Nothing, because a condition precedent, namely the consummation of the sale and transfer of title, has failed to occur.
F: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the consummation condition to the owner's duty to pay the commission was excused by the owner's refusal without cause to accept the buyer's offer and perform the land sale contract.
G: Quantum meruit for the reasonable value for services rendered in obtaining a buyer for the property.
H: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the broker had obtained a buyer who was willing and able to purchase at a price higher than the minimum set in the brokerage agreement.
I: $62,500, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the original minimum sale price of the property for $1,250,000, since the broker had fulfilled her duty by finding a potential buyer.
J: A court injunction forcing the owner to complete the sale, thus entitling the broker to the full commission.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate brokerage question. Let me go through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is that an owner of a large family estate wants to sell and enters into a brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. The agreement says the broker will use best efforts to sell the estate for at least $1,250,000. The broker's commission is 5% of the gross sale price, but only after the sale is consummated and title is transferred. The agreement lasts two months.

So, one month in, the broker finds a buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. She presents a signed sales contract to the owner. The owner checks the buyer and sees they have enough funds, so the buyer is ready, willing, and able. But then the owner changes his mind and decides not to sell. He tells the broker he won't sign the agreement and is cancelling their brokerage agreement because he's withdrawing the property from the market. He also refuses to pay the commission.

Now, the broker is suing for breach of contract. The question is, what's the proper measure of recovery for the broker?

I remember that in real estate brokerage contracts, the broker typically earns their commission when they produce a buyer who is ready, willing, and able to purchase on the terms agreed upon. Once that happens, the owner is obligated to pay the commission, even if the sale doesn't go through because the owner backs out.

Wait, but the brokerage agreement here says the commission is paid upon the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. So does that mean that the broker only gets paid if the sale actually closes?

Hmm. So two possibilities: either the broker gets the commission when a suitable buyer is found, or only upon the sale closing. I think it depends on the terms of the contract.

In this case, the contract says the commission is paid "following the consummation of the sale." So that would mean that the condition is that the sale must actually happen before the commission is owed.

But wait, some jurisdictions have rules where if the broker finds a buyer who is ready and able, the commission is due regardless of whether the sale goes through, especially if the owner is the one who backs out without a valid reason. Because the broker has fulfilled their part of the contract by procuring a buyer.

So maybe the condition here is that the broker's performance was sufficient to trigger the commission, even if the sale doesn't close because the owner cancels.

Alternatively, if the contract explicitly requires the sale to be consummated, then maybe the broker isn't entitled to the commission. But that seems unfair because the broker did their job.

I think the key here is whether the contract's condition is a condition precedent. So, in this case, the commission is conditioned upon the sale being consummated. So if the sale doesn't happen, the condition isn't met, and the broker doesn't get paid. But wait, that might not be the case if the failure to close is due to the owner's own actions.

So, in contract law, if one party prevents the other from fulfilling a condition, then that condition is considered fulfilled. So, if the owner wrongfully refuses to go through with the sale, then the condition (consummation) is excused, and the broker can still recover the commission.

So in this scenario, the owner is the one who decided not to sell after the broker produced a buyer. Therefore, the owner's action prevented the consummation, so the condition is excused, and the broker can still claim the commission.

Let me look at the options. 

Option C says $75,000 (5% of 1.5M) because all conditions precedent were met when the broker produced a buyer. But wait, the condition was consummation, so this option might not be correct because it ignores that condition.

Option E says nothing because the sale wasn't consummated. But that doesn't account for the owner's action in preventing it.

Option F says the commission because the consummation was excused by the owner's refusal. That sounds right because the owner's action prevented the condition, so it's as if the condition was satisfied.

Option G is quantum meruit, which is about reasonable value of services, but the contract here specifies a commission, so specific performance or the commission would apply, not quantum meruit.

So between F and C. Option C says conditions were fulfilled when the broker produced the buyer, but the contract says the commission is upon consummation. So C's reasoning might not align with the contract terms. F's reasoning is about the condition being excused because the owner refused without cause.

So I think F is the correct answer. The broker can get the commission because the owner's refusal without cause excused the need for the sale to be consummated.

The brokerage agreement stipulates that the broker is entitled to a commission of 5% on the gross sale price, but only "following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title." This creates a condition precedent for the payment of the commission: the sale must be consummated. However, in contract law, if one party wrongfully prevents the fulfillment of a condition, that condition is considered excused. 

In this case, the broker produced a buyer who was ready, willing, and able to purchase the property for $1,500,000, fulfilling their obligation under the agreement. However, the owner decided not to sell and refused to sign the sales contract, thereby preventing the consummation of the sale. The owner's actions constitute a wrongful interference with the condition precedent, excusing the requirement for the sale to be consummated. As a result, the broker is still entitled to the commission.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** is incorrect because it ignores the condition precedent of consummation explicitly stated in the contract.
- **Option E** is incorrect because it fails to account for the owner's wrongful refusal to proceed, which excused the condition.
- **Option F** is correct because it recognizes that the owner's refusal without cause excused the condition of consummation, entitling the broker to the commission.
- Other options (A, D, G, H, I, J) are either inconsistent with the facts or fail to address the key legal issue.

Thus, the broker is entitled to the commission of $75,000 (5% of $1,500,000) because the owner's actions excused the condition of consummation.

**Answer: F**
