Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Piaget’s theory of cognitive development. Hmm, I remember Piaget talked about different stages children go through. Let me think... I think he proposed that children progress through a series of stages where their thinking and understanding develop.

Wait, the question is asking about the time span these stages cover. Oh right, Piaget's stages are from birth up until a certain age. I remember there being four stages, maybe? Let me see: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. 

So, sensorimotor is from birth to about 2 years old. Then preoperational is around 2-7, concrete operational is 7-11, and formal operational is from adolescence onwards. Oh wait, so the formal operational stage starts in early adolescence and continues into adulthood. So Piaget’s stages cover from birth all the way to adulthood. 

Looking at the options, the question is about the span of the stages. So the correct answer should say from birth through late adolescence or even into early adulthood? Let me see the options again.

Option J says from birth through late adolescence. Option D is from birth to early adulthood. Option H says throughout the lifespan. Oh, wait, does Piaget’s theory go beyond late adolescence? I think the last stage is formal operational, which starts around 12 and continues into adulthood. So the stages go from birth to early adulthood. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact end point. 

Wait, another angle: the term "late adolescence" might be up to around 18-19, while early adulthood is maybe 20s. So if the stages go into adulthood, then the correct option would be from birth through late adolescence or beyond. Let me look at the options.

Option J says from birth through late adolescence only. Option D is from birth to early adulthood only. Option H is throughout the lifespan. Oh wait, but Piaget's stages end in early adulthood. So H is wrong because he didn't cover the entire life span, just up to a certain point.

So between options J and D. I think Piaget's stages go from birth (sensorimotor) to formal operational stage, which starts in adolescence and continues into early adulthood. So the stages end in early adulthood, so the answer would be D: from birth to early adulthood only.

Wait, but option J is from birth through late adolescence only. So if the stages end in early adulthood, then D is correct. But maybe the option says early adulthood only, which might not be accurate because the last stage is part of adulthood.

Wait, let me think again. The formal operational stage begins around 11-15 and continues into adulthood, so the stages cover birth up to early adulthood. So the correct answer would be D. But wait, the question is about the description in Piaget’s theory. Alternatively, another possibility is that some sources say Piaget’s stages end at around age 15, which is late adolescence.

Wait, no, I think the formal operational stage is considered to last from about 12 and beyond, into adulthood. So the stages go from birth through early adulthood. So the correct option would be D: from birth to early adulthood only.

But another thought: the formal operational stage is the last one, and it's when people develop the ability to think abstractly. So the stages cover from birth (sensorimotor) until that point, which would be into early adulthood. Therefore, the answer is D.

Wait, but looking back at the options, is there an option that includes from birth through late adolescence? Because the formal operational stage starts in early adolescence and continues into early adulthood. So J says "from birth through late adolescence only"—if the stages go beyond late adolescence into early adulthood, then J isn't correct. So D would be correct.

Wait, the options are:

A: During adolescence only → No, starts earlier.

B: From birth to late childhood only → Late childhood is maybe 11-12, but stages go beyond.

C: During infancy only → No.

D: From birth to early adulthood only → This seems right.

E: From infancy through adolescence only → Ends at adolescence, but stages go into adulthood.

F: Early childhood to late adulthood → No, starts at birth.

G: Early childhood only → No.

H: Throughout lifespan → No, ends in early adulthood.

I: Adolescence to early adulthood → Misses the earlier stages.

J: From birth through late adolescence only → Ends at late adolescence, but the formal stage goes beyond, into early adulthood.

So, D is the correct answer. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because some sources might say the stages end at around 15, which is late adolescence. But I think the formal stage extends into adulthood, so D is correct.

Piaget’s theory of cognitive development describes four stages: sensorimotor (birth to 2 years), preoperational (2-7 years), concrete operational (7-11 years), and formal operational (adolescence and beyond). The formal operational stage begins in early adolescence and continues into adulthood, indicating that the stages span from birth to early adulthood. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, G, I**: These options are incorrect because they limit the stages to specific, narrower time frames that do not encompass the full span of Piaget’s theory.  
- **B, E, J**: These options stop at late childhood, adolescence, or late adolescence, but the formal operational stage extends into early adulthood.  
- **F, H**: These options extend beyond Piaget’s stages, which do not cover the entire lifespan or late adulthood.  
- **D**: This option correctly identifies the span of Piaget’s stages as from birth to early adulthood, aligning with the progression of the stages through the formal operational phase.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.
