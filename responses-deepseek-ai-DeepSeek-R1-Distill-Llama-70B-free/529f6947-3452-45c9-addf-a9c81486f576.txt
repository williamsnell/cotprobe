Okay, so I've got this question about bankruptcy and how much each creditor gets. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the question says that Bob has debts totaling $25,000. But when he went bankrupt, he only had $15,000 available to pay his creditors. I need to figure out how many cents on the dollar each creditor gets and then find out how much a specific creditor with a $4,500 claim would receive.

Hmm, I remember that in bankruptcy, when there's not enough money to pay all debts, creditors get a proportionate share based on what's available. So, the first thing is to determine what percentage each creditor gets.

The total debts are $25k, and the total available is $15k. So, the ratio would be 15,000 divided by 25,000. Let me do that calculation. 15/25 is the same as 3/5, right? 3 divided by 5 is 0.6. So that's 60% or 60 cents on the dollar.

Wait, but wait. Sometimes in these problems, if the total is less than the claims, each creditor gets a percentage. So yes, each creditor gets 60% of their claim. So that's 60 cents per dollar.

Now, the second part is how much a creditor with a $4,500 claim gets. If each gets 60%, then I multiply 4500 by 0.6. Let me do that. 4500 * 0.6. Well, 4000 * 0.6 is 2400, and 500 *0.6 is 300. So 2400 +300 is 2700. So that's $2,700.

Now I look at the options. Let me go through them.

Option A: 65 cents, $2925. That's more than 60, so probably not.

Option B: 66, 2970. Also higher. Not matching.

C: 80, 3600. Way higher.

D:75, 3375. No.

E:40, 1800. Too low.

F:55, 2475. Hmm, 55% is 2475, but our calculation was 60% which is 2700.

G:70, 3150. No.

H:60, 2700. That's exactly what I got. So this looks correct.

I:50, 2250. No, too low.

J:30, 1350. Also too low.

So the correct answer is H.

To determine how many cents on the dollar Bob has to pay each creditor and how much a creditor with a $4,500 claim receives, we start by calculating the proportion of total debts that can be paid. Bob's total debts are $25,000, and he has $15,000 available to pay creditors. The ratio of available funds to total debts is:

\[
\frac{15,000}{25,000} = 0.6 \, \text{(or 60 cents on the dollar)}.
\]

Next, we calculate the payment for a creditor with a $4,500 claim. Since each creditor receives 60% of their claim:

\[
4,500 \times 0.6 = 2,700.
\]

Thus, Bob pays 60 cents on the dollar, and the creditor with a $4,500 claim receives $2,700. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: 60 cents on the dollar, $2,700.**
