Question:

A 67-year-old man with Parkinson disease is admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia. The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?

Options:

A: Begin corticosteroid treatment
B: Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube
C: Administer influenza vaccine
D: Prescribe fludrocortisone
E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa
F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy
G: Initiate physical therapy
H: Obtain CT scan of the chest
I: Obtain a swallowing evaluation
J: Start patient on anticoagulant therapy

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a patient with Parkinson's disease. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The patient is a 67-year-old man admitted for pneumonia. His daughter reports increased lethargy over the past day and decreased ambulation for the past six months. He has times when his tremors get worse, but he still takes care of himself. His medical history includes hypertension, and his medications are hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa.

Looking at his vital signs, he has a fever of 38.9°C, which makes sense with pneumonia. His pulse is a bit low when supine (60) but goes up to 68 when standing, which might indicate some dehydration or maybe autonomic issues. Blood pressure is 100/60 supine and drops to 80/50 standing. That's a significant drop, so orthostatic hypotension. His BMI is 28, so he's overweight but not obese.

On physical exam, he looks ill and older than his age. He's lethargic but fully oriented. Chest has rhonchi in the right mid lung field, which aligns with the chest x-ray showing a right lower lobe infiltrate. Neuro exam shows masked facies, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity—classic Parkinson's signs. Gait wasn't assessed because he's probably too sick to get up.

They started IV antibiotics, which is appropriate for pneumonia. Now, the question is about the most appropriate step prior to discharge.

So looking at the options:

A: Corticosteroids. Maybe for inflammation, but not sure if needed here. He's improving with antibiotics, maybe no need unless it's a specific infection requiring steroids.

B: PEG tube. He's able to care for himself at home, so maybe he's eating okay. Unless he has dysphagia, but the question doesn't mention difficulty swallowing.

C: Influenza vaccine. That's a good idea for someone with chronic illness, but is it the most appropriate step before discharge? Maybe, but perhaps there's something more urgent.

D: Fludrocortisone. That's used for orthostatic hypotension. His BP dropped a lot when standing, so maybe he needs something for that. He's on levodopa and carbidopa, which can sometimes cause orthostatic hypotension, especially in Parkinson's patients who might have autonomic dysfunction.

E: Stop levodopa and carbidopa. That doesn't make sense. Those are his Parkinson's meds. Stopping them would worsen his symptoms.

F: Home oxygen. He had pneumonia, but unless he has severe hypoxia or chronic lung disease, maybe not necessary. His oxygen saturation isn't mentioned, so I'm not sure.

G: Physical therapy. Given that he has decreased ambulation over six months, maybe PT could help. But he's just getting over pneumonia, so maybe not the immediate step. Also, he's still able to care for himself, so maybe not urgent.

H: CT chest. The x-ray already showed the infiltrate, but if there were complications, maybe. But the question says appropriate IV antibiotics are started, so maybe no need unless there's no improvement.

I: Swallowing evaluation. Since he has Parkinson's, dysphagia is a risk. If he's having trouble swallowing, that could lead to aspiration pneumonia. But the question doesn't mention dysphagia symptoms. He's lethargic but oriented, and the daughter didn't mention eating issues.

J: Anticoagulant. No indication here, unless there's a clot, but nothing in the history suggests that.

So the main issues I see are his orthostatic hypotension (BP drops upon standing) and his Parkinson's management. The question is about prior to discharge, so looking for something that needs to be addressed before sending him home.

His medications include a diuretic (HCTZ) and a beta-blocker (atenolol). Both can contribute to orthostatic hypotension. So maybe adjusting those would help. But none of the options are about changing meds except D, which is fludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid used to increase blood volume and help with orthostasis.

Alternatively, another option is to increase salt intake or fluids, but that's not one of the choices.

So for the options given, D (fludrocortisone) might be the answer to address his orthostatic hypotension. But wait, another thought: the patient has a fever and pneumonia. His vitals include tachypnea (22/min) and fever. His BP is low, but maybe due to dehydration or the infection itself.

Alternatively, the orthostatic hypotension could be due to his Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's can cause autonomic dysfunction, leading to orthostatic hypotension. So managing that could be important to prevent falls, especially since he's still ambulating some.

So the question is, what's the best step before discharge. Since the patient is being treated for pneumonia and will be going home, ensuring that his orthostatic hypotension is managed would be crucial. So starting fludrocortisone (option D) would help with that.

Another option is to look at the medications. He's on HCTZ and atenolol, which can cause hypotension. Maybe adjusting the dose or stopping them could help, but that's not one of the options provided.

So between options, D seems plausible.

Wait, what about option I, swallowing evaluation? Parkinson's can cause dysphagia, leading to aspiration. Since he has pneumonia, maybe aspiration was the cause. If so, a swallowing eval would be important to prevent future episodes. But the question states that he's been admitted for pneumonia, and the chest x-ray shows an infiltrate, but it doesn't specify if it's aspiration pneumonia. The presence of rhonchi in the right mid lung field could be from infection, but aspiration would more likely affect the lower lobes or perhaps the upper lobes if he was lying down.

Alternatively, the patient's lethargy might contribute to dysphagia, so a swallowing evaluation could be important to prevent further aspiration events.

So perhaps option I is the better choice. Because if he has dysphagia, he's at risk for aspiration pneumonia, which can be life-threatening. So prior to discharge, ensuring he can swallow safely is crucial.

But the question says he continues to care for himself at home. So maybe he's managing his meals, but the lethargy over the past day could indicate that he's not eating well now. So maybe during the hospitalization, his nutrition or swallowing was compromised.

Alternatively, the patient's daughter didn't report any issues with eating, but that doesn't mean it's not a problem.

Given that, perhaps the best step is to assess his swallowing before discharge to prevent future aspiration. So option I.

But I'm a bit torn between D and I.

Wait, the patient's orthostatic hypotension is significant (BP drops from 100/60 to 80/50). That's a drop of 20 systolic. That's a problem because it can lead to falls. So managing that is important. But if he's about to go home, perhaps that's something that needs addressing.

So, which is more critical prior to discharge: managing orthostasis or assessing swallowing?

If the patient has a history of falls or near-falls, orthostasis would be a priority. But the question doesn't mention falls. However, he has decreased ambulation over six months, which might be due to Parkinson's progression but also could be related to fear of falling.

So, perhaps both are important, but which is more appropriate as a step prior to discharge.

The options are about what to do before discharge. So, for the orthostasis, maybe they can start fludrocortisone, which is a medication that can help increase blood volume and reduce the BP drop.

Alternatively, treating the orthostasis without meds could involve increasing salt intake, but that's not an option here.

So, considering all this, I'm leaning towards option I: obtain a swallowing evaluation.

But wait, the patient is being treated for pneumonia, which may have been caused by aspiration. So ensuring he can swallow safely is important to prevent recurrence.

Yes, that seems more critical, especially in a Parkinson's patient who might have silent aspiration. So option I would be the appropriate step.

The patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson’s disease admitted for pneumonia. His vital signs reveal orthostatic hypotension, with a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing, likely exacerbated by his medications (hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol) and Parkinson’s-related autonomic dysfunction. He also has decreased ambulation over the past six months and lethargy, but he continues to care for himself at home. The chest x-ray confirms a right lower lobe infiltrate, and he is being treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics.

When considering the options for the most appropriate step prior to discharge:

- **Option A (Corticosteroids):** Not indicated unless there is a specific need for reducing inflammation, which is not mentioned here.  
- **Option B (PEG tube):** Unnecessary since the patient is able to care for himself and there is no mention of severe dysphagia or inability to eat.  
- **Option C (Influenza vaccine):** While important for a patient with chronic illness, it is not the most urgent step prior to discharge.  
- **Option D (Fludrocortisone):** This medication could help manage orthostatic hypotension, which is a significant issue for the patient. However, addressing the root cause of orthostasis, such as adjusting medications or non-pharmacological interventions, might also be considered.  
- **Option E (Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa):** Incorrect, as these are essential for managing his Parkinson’s symptoms.  
- **Option F (Home oxygen therapy):** Not indicated unless there is severe hypoxia or chronic lung disease, which is not mentioned.  
- **Option G (Physical therapy):** While potentially beneficial for his mobility, it is not the most urgent step prior to discharge.  
- **Option H (CT scan of the chest):** Unnecessary since the chest x-ray already confirmed the infiltrate and antibiotics are effective.  
- **Option I (Swallowing evaluation):** This is critical because Parkinson’s disease increases the risk of dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia. Given his recent pneumonia and lethargy, assessing his swallowing function is essential to prevent future aspiration events and ensure safe oral intake.  
- **Option J (Anticoagulant therapy):** Not indicated as there is no evidence of thromboembolic disease.  

While orthostatic hypotension is a significant issue, the patient’s history of Parkinson’s disease and recent pneumonia raise a high suspicion of dysphagia, making a swallowing evaluation the most appropriate step prior to discharge to prevent further complications.
