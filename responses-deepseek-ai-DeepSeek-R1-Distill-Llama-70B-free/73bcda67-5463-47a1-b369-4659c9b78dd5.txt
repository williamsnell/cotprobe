Question:

The terrestrial planet cores contain mostly metal because

Options:

A: the core is the only part of the planet that can withstand the high pressure needed to contain metals.
B: metals were drawn to the core by the planet's magnetic field.
C: metals sank to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout.
D: metals are more resistant to heat and pressure, so they survived at the core while other materials melted away.
E: the entire planets are made mostly of metal.
F: radioactivity created metals in the core from the decay of uranium.
G: metals condensed first in the solar nebula and the rocks then accreted around them.
H: asteroids and comets delivered metals to the core during the early stages of the planet's formation.

Okay, so I've got this question about why the cores of terrestrial planets are mostly metal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that terrestrial planets like Earth, Mars, and Mercury have cores that are primarily made up of iron and nickel. But why is that the case? Let's look at the options.

Option A says the core is the only part that can withstand high pressure to contain metals. Wait, high pressure is a factor, but metals are actually denser, so maybe they settle rather than pressure keeping them there. Not sure yet.

Option B suggests metals were drawn by the planet's magnetic field. I think Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in the core. But the field is a result of the core being metallic, not the cause. So maybe B is not correct.

Option C states metals sank during a time when interiors were molten. Oh right! I remember something about differentiation. Early in a planet's life, when it's molten (like during the magma ocean phase), denser materials like metals would sink to the center, leaving lighter silicates near the surface. That makes sense.

Option D says metals are more resistant to heat and pressure, so they survived. But I think during the planet's formation, the metals melted along with other materials. It's more about density than resilience, so D doesn't seem right.

Option E claims the entire planets are mostly metal. No, that's not true. The mantles and crusts are silicate-based, so E is incorrect.

Option F talks about radioactivity creating metals in the core. Uranium decay does produce heat, but I don't think it creates metals like iron. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says metals condensed first in the solar nebula. I recall that in the nebula, heavier elements like metals would condense at higher temperatures. So maybe metal particles formed first, but how does that relate to the core? Maybe the metals accreted first, forming the core. But I'm not sure if this is the primary reason, or if it's more about differentiation after the planet formed.

Option H suggests asteroids and comets delivered metals. While impacts did bring materials, the core's composition is more about the planet's internal processes than external delivery. So H might not be the main reason.

Putting it together, the main reason is differentiation when the planet was molten, causing denser metals to sink. So the correct answer should be C.
</think>

The cores of terrestrial planets are primarily composed of metals like iron and nickel due to a process known as differentiation. Early in the planet's formation, the interior was largely molten, allowing denser materials such as metals to sink to the center while lighter silicate materials rose to the surface. This separation occurred during a phase when the planet's interior was molten throughout, making it possible for metals to settle at the core. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because the core's composition is not solely due to its ability to withstand pressure.  
- **B** is incorrect because the magnetic field is a result of the metallic core, not the cause of metals being there.  
- **C** is correct as it accurately describes the differentiation process during the molten phase.  
- **D** is incorrect because the resilience of metals to heat and pressure is not the primary reason for their presence in the core.  
- **E** is incorrect because the planets are not mostly metal; their mantles and crusts are silicate-based.  
- **F** is incorrect because radioactivity does not create metals like iron in the core.  
- **G** and **H** are less relevant, as the core's metallic composition is better explained by internal differentiation rather than external factors like early condensation in the nebula or delivery by asteroids.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
