Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the dissociation of N₂O₄ into NO₂. I'm a bit rusty on equilibrium problems, but I'll try to think it through.

The reaction is N₂O₄(g) ⇌ 2NO₂(g). The problem says that we start with 1 mole of pure N₂O₄, which then partially dissociates. The total pressure is 1 atm, and the temperature is 300 K. The equilibrium constant Kp is given as 0.174. The goal is to find the apparent molecular weight of the equilibrium mixture.

Hmm, apparent molecular weight. I remember that the apparent molecular weight (M) is calculated as the total moles of substance times the molar mass divided by the total moles of all substances present. Or wait, maybe it's (total mass) divided by (total moles). Yeah, that makes sense because molecular weight is mass per mole.

So the initial mass is 1 mole of N₂O₄. The molar mass of N₂O₄: nitrogen is 14, oxygen is 16. So that's 2*14 + 4*16 = 28 +64=92 g/mol. So initial mass is 92 grams.

Now, let me think about the dissociation. Let's denote the extent of dissociation as 'x'. So, if x is the fraction that dissociates, then:

Initially, we have 1 mole of N₂O₄. At equilibrium, the moles would be:

N₂O₄: 1 - x
NO₂: 2x

Wait, but since the reaction is in the gas phase and under pressure, maybe it's better to express in terms of partial pressures. Because Kp is given in terms of pressure.

Let me consider the total pressure. The total pressure is 1 atm, and it's a closed system, so the sum of partial pressures of N₂O₄ and NO₂ equals 1 atm.

Let me denote the partial pressure of N₂O₄ as P_N2O4, and NO₂ as P_NO2.

At equilibrium, P_N2O4 = (1 - x) * total pressure / total moles? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of mole fractions.

Wait, another approach: Let me let the change be based on the initial moles. Let me define the change as starting with 1 mole N₂O₄, which dissociates into 2 moles of NO₂. So, let’s say that 'x' is the mole fraction that dissociates. So:

Moles of N₂O₄ at equilibrium = 1 - x
Moles of NO₂ at equilibrium = 2x

But wait, in a gaseous system under certain pressure, the total moles would affect the pressure. But since pressure is given, perhaps using partial pressures is better.

Alternatively, since the system is at a constant volume, but I think using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, but since pressure is given, maybe I can use mole fractions.

Wait, another approach is to express the partial pressures in terms of mole fractions. The total pressure is 1 atm, so the sum of the partial pressures is 1 atm.

Let me use the variable 'x' as the degree of dissociation. So, the mole fraction of N₂O₄ would be (1 - x)/(1 - x + 2x) = (1 - x)/(1 + x). Similarly, mole fraction of NO₂ is 2x/(1 + x). Then, their partial pressures would be:

P_N2O4 = [(1 - x)/(1 + x)] * 1 atm

P_NO2 = [2x/(1 + x)] * 1 atm

Wait, but wait, the reaction is N₂O₄ ⇌ 2 NO₂, so the Kp expression is Kp = (P_NO2)^2 / P_N2O4.

So substituting the partial pressures:

Kp = [ (2x/(1+x))^2 ] / [ (1 -x)/(1+x) ) ]

Let me compute that:

Kp = [4x²/(1+x)^2 ] * [ (1+x)/(1 - x) ) ]

Simplify:

= [4x² (1+x)] / [ (1+x)^2 (1 - x) ) ]

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me do it step by step.

The numerator is (P_NO2)^2 = [2x/(1+x)]² = 4x²/(1+x)^2.

Denominator is P_N2O4 = (1 - x)/(1 + x).

So Kp = [4x²/(1+x)^2] / [ (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) ].

Which is [4x²/(1+x)^2] * [ (1+x)/(1 - x) ) ]

Simplify this expression:

The (1+x) in the denominator of the first term and the (1+x) in the numerator of the second term will cancel one (1+x) from the denominator.

So it becomes [4x² * (1+x) ] / [ (1+x)^2 (1 - x) ) ] ? No, wait, let's see: the denominator of the first fraction is (1+x)^2, the numerator of the second is (1+x). So when you multiply, it's (1+x) / (1+x)^2) = 1/(1+x).

So the expression becomes:

4x² / [ (1 + x)(1 - x) ) ]

Which is 4x²/(1 - x²).

So Kp = 4x²/(1 - x²) = 0.174.

So set up the equation: 4x² / (1 - x²) = 0.174.

I can solve for x.

Let me rewrite this: 4x² = 0.174 (1 - x²)

4x² = 0.174 - 0.174 x²

Bring all terms to one side:

4x² + 0.174 x² - 0.174 = 0

Combine like terms:

(4 + 0.174) x² - 0.174 = 0

4.174 x² = 0.174

x² = 0.174 / 4.174

Compute that: 0.174 / 4.174 ≈ 0.0417.

So x ≈ sqrt(0.0417) ≈ 0.204.

Let me check that calculation.

Wait, 0.0417 is approximately 1/24, and sqrt(1/24) is about 0.204, yes.

So x ≈ 0.204.

Now, what's the total number of moles at equilibrium?

Initially, 1 mole of N₂O₄. After dissociation, it's (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x moles.

So total moles = 1 + x ≈ 1 + 0.204 = 1.204 moles.

But wait, wait. Since the initial is 1 mole, but upon dissociation, each mole of N₂O₄ produces 2 moles of NO₂. So, for x moles dissociated, the total moles would be 1 - x + 2x = 1 + x.

Yes, that makes sense.

So total moles = 1 + x ≈ 1.204.

Now, the mass of the system hasn't changed because it's a dissociation. The initial mass was 1 mole of N₂O₄, which is 92 g. So the total mass is still 92 grams.

Apparent molecular weight (M) is total mass (m) divided by total moles (n).

So M = m / n = 92 g / 1.204 mol ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 92 divided by 1.204.

1.204 times 76 is around 91.5, because 1.2 *76=91.2. So 76 is close.

Wait, 76 * 1.204 = ?

76 * 1.2 = 91.2; 76 * 0.004 = 0.304. So total 91.504. Hmm, but 92 is the numerator. So 92 / 1.204 ≈ 76.4 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option G is 76.4. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation for x.

Alternative approach: Let me solve 4x²/(1 - x²) = 0.174.

Multiply both sides by (1 - x²):

4x² = 0.174 (1 - x² )

4x² = 0.174 - 0.174 x²

Bring terms together:

4x² + 0.174 x² = 0.174

4.174 x² = 0.174

x² = 0.174 / 4.174 = 0.041666...

x = sqrt(0.041666) ≈ 0.2041.

So that's correct.

So then total moles = 1 + x = 1.2041.

M = 92 / 1.2041 ≈ 76.4.

Yes, so the answer is option G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the dissociation equilibrium of N₂O₄ into NO₂:  
**N₂O₄ (g) ⇌ 2 NO₂ (g)**.  

### Step 1: Define the equilibrium concentrations  
Let the degree of dissociation be \( x \). At equilibrium:  
- Moles of N₂O₄ = \( 1 - x \)  
- Moles of NO₂ = \( 2x \)  
- Total moles = \( 1 - x + 2x = 1 + x \).  

### Step 2: Express partial pressures  
The partial pressures are proportional to mole fractions:  
- \( P_{\text{N}_2\text{O}_4} = \frac{1 - x}{1 + x} \cdot P_{\text{total}} \)  
- \( P_{\text{NO}_2} = \frac{2x}{1 + x} \cdot P_{\text{total}} \).  

Since \( P_{\text{total}} = 1 \, \text{atm} \), we have:  
- \( P_{\text{N}_2\text{O}_4} = \frac{1 - x}{1 + x} \)  
- \( P_{\text{NO}_2} = \frac{2x}{1 + x} \).  

### Step 3: Write the equilibrium constant expression  
The equilibrium constant is given as \( K_p = \frac{(P_{\text{NO}_2})^2}{P_{\text{N}_2\text{O}_4}} \). Substituting the partial pressures:  
\[
K_p = \frac{\left(\frac{2x}{1 + x}\right)^2}{\frac{1 - x}{1 + x}} = \frac{4x^2}{(1 + x)(1 - x)} = \frac{4x^2}{1 - x^2}.
\]  
Given \( K_p = 0.174 \), we solve:  
\[
\frac{4x^2}{1 - x^2} = 0.174.
\]  

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)  
Multiply through by \( 1 - x^2 \):  
\[
4x^2 = 0.174(1 - x^2).
\]  
Expand and rearrange:  
\[
4x^2 + 0.174x^2 = 0.174 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4.174x^2 = 0.174.
\]  
Solve for \( x^2 \):  
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.174}{4.174} \approx 0.0417 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x \approx \sqrt{0.0417} \approx 0.204.
\]  

### Step 5: Calculate total moles and apparent molecular weight  
- Total moles at equilibrium:  
\[
n_{\text{total}} = 1 + x \approx 1 + 0.204 = 1.204 \, \text{moles}.
\]  
- The total mass of the system is constant at \( 92 \, \text{g} \) (from 1 mole of N₂O₄ with molar mass \( 92 \, \text{g/mol} \)).  
- Apparent molecular weight:  
\[
M = \frac{\text{Total mass}}{\text{Total moles}} = \frac{92}{1.204} \approx 76.4 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]  

### Final Answer  
The apparent molecular weight of the equilibrium mixture is **76.4 g/mol**, which corresponds to option **G**.
