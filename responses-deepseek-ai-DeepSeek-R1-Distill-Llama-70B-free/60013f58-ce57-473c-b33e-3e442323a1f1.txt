Okay, so I've got this problem here about a medical ampule with dextrose, which is like a liquid, right? It's under certain conditions and then it's placed in a cylinder where it evaporates. I need to find the final quality of the water-vapor mixture and the heat transfer. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the ampule has dextrose at 1000 psia and 100°F with a volume of 0.3 in³. Then it's placed into a cylinder with a volume of 1 ft³, which is evacuated (vacuum), so no air or anything else is in there. When the ampule breaks, the liquid evaporates and fills the cylinder. The final temperature is 100°F, same as the initial temperature of the liquid. So, I guess the process is isothermal? Or maybe it's just reaching equilibrium at that temp.

Part a asks for the final quality of the water-vapor mixture. Quality is the ratio of vapor to the total mass, right? Or wait, no, quality (x) is usually the mass of vapor divided by the total mass of the mixture (liquid + vapor). So if the system is at 100°F and some pressure, the quality will tell us how much is vapor and how much is liquid.

Wait, but the cylinder's volume is 1 ft³. The ampule's volume is 0.3 in³. Let me convert these to consistent units. Since the cylinder is in ft³, maybe I should convert everything to feet.

So 1 ft is 12 inches. So 1 ft³ is (12 in)^3 = 1728 in³. The ampule is 0.3 in³, so the cylinder is much larger. When the ampule breaks, the liquid (water, I guess, since it's dextrose which is a sugar solution but maybe approximated as water) will evaporate into the cylinder. Since it's a vacuum, the only substance present is the vapor from the liquid.

Wait, but what's the initial state of the liquid? It's at 1000 psia and 100°F. So that's a high pressure. So when released into the cylinder, it will expand, but since the cylinder is at vacuum, the pressure will drop, and the liquid will vaporize. But since the final temperature is also 100°F, maybe it's reaching equilibrium at that temp.

I think I can model this as a rigid tank with a vacuum initially. Then the liquid is released, and the vapor fills the tank. So the final state is a mixture of vapor and possibly some liquid, depending on the pressure.

Wait, but at 100°F, what's the saturation pressure of water? I remember that at 100°F, the saturation pressure is higher than atmospheric. Let me think. At 100°C, it's 1 atm, but 100°F is lower. Let me look up the saturation pressure for water at 100°F. Wait, from steam tables, at 100°F, the saturation pressure is about 0.9496 psia. Oh wait, no, wait, 100°F is 37.78°C, and the saturation pressure at that point is about 1.9 kPa, which is roughly 0.276 psia. Hmm, but that seems low. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up units. Let me clarify: 1 atm is 14.7 psia. So 100°F is less than the boiling point at 1 atm, so the saturation pressure is lower than 14.7 psia.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me get the exact saturation pressure at 100°F. Let me recall that at 100°F, the saturation pressure (P_sat) is about 0.949 psia. No, wait, maybe I should remember that at 100°F, the pressure is around 0.949 psia. So that's the pressure at which water boils at 100°F.

But wait, the initial pressure in the ampule is 1000 psia. So when the ampule is broken, the liquid is at 1000 psia and 100°F. That's a subcooled liquid because at 1000 psia, the saturation temperature is higher than 100°F. Wait, no, let me check. At higher pressure, the saturation temperature is higher. So at 1000 psia, what's the saturation temperature? I think it's somewhere around 327°F or so. So if the liquid is at 100°F and 1000 psia, it's subcooled, so when released into the cylinder, it will flash into vapor, but since the cylinder is much larger, the pressure drops.

Wait, but then the vapor fills the cylinder, and the system reaches 100°F again. So perhaps the process involves the liquid evaporating until the pressure in the cylinder equals the saturation pressure at 100°F. Because at 100°F, any vapor present must be at P_sat = 0.949 psia. So the cylinder's final pressure would be 0.949 psia.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Find the mass of the liquid in the ampule.
2. Determine how much of it evaporates into the cylinder, considering the final state at 100°F and P_sat = 0.949 psia.
3. Calculate the quality of the resulting mixture.

First, find the mass of the dextrose solution. Since it's a liquid, and assuming it's water for simplicity (though dextrose has a higher molar mass, but maybe the problem treats it as water), the specific volume of liquid water at 100°F is needed. From steam tables, at 100°F, the specific volume v_f is about 0.01774 ft³/lbm. Wait, no, I think that's in cubic feet per pound mass.

Wait, let me correct. At 100°F, the specific volume of saturated liquid (v_f) is 0.01772 ft³/lbm. So the mass m = V / v.

Wait, but the ampule's volume is 0.3 in³. I need to convert that to cubic feet. 1 in = 1/12 ft, so 1 in³ = (1/12)^3 = 1/1728 ft³. So 0.3 in³ is 0.3 / 1728 ft³ ≈ 0.0001736 ft³.

So m = V / v_f = 0.0001736 ft³ / 0.01772 ft³/lbm ≈ 0.0098 lbm. So about 0.0098 pounds mass of water.

Now, when this water is released into the cylinder, it will vaporize and fill the cylinder. The cylinder's volume is 1 ft³. At 100°F, the saturation pressure is P_sat = 0.949 psia. So the specific volume of the vapor at 100°F is v_g ≈ 26.8 ft³/lbm.

Wait, no, let me check the steam tables again. At 100°F, P_sat is about 0.949 psia. The specific volume of saturated vapor v_g is indeed around 26.8 ft³/lbm.

So the mass of vapor that can exist in 1 ft³ at 100°F is m_vapor = V / v_g = 1 ft³ / 26.8 ft³/lbm ≈ 0.0373 lbm.

Wait, but the ampule only has 0.0098 lbm of water. So wait, that can't be right. Because 0.0098 lbm is much less than 0.0373 lbm. So all the water would evaporate, and the vapor would occupy the entire volume, but since the mass is less than what's needed to saturate the cylinder, perhaps the vapor is at a lower pressure?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The cylinder is initially evacuated, so when the ampule breaks, the liquid is released and starts to vaporize. The vapor fills the cylinder, but the final state is at 100°F. So the pressure in the cylinder must be the saturation pressure at 100°F, which is 0.949 psia. So the vapor in the cylinder will be at P = 0.949 psia and T = 100°F.

So the specific volume at this state is v_g = 26.8 ft³/lbm. So the mass of vapor in the cylinder would be m = V / v_g = 1 / 26.8 ≈ 0.0373 lbm.

But the ampule only has m = 0.0098 lbm. So that suggests that only part of the cylinder's capacity is filled by the vapor from the ampule. Wait, that can't be right. Because the vapor from 0.0098 lbm would have a specific volume of v = v_g * m = 26.8 * 0.0098 ≈ 0.2627 ft³. But the cylinder is 1 ft³, so that can't be. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the process. Let's think again: the ampule contains liquid at 1000 psia and 100°F. When released into the cylinder (vacuum), the pressure drops, and the liquid flashes into vapor. Since the cylinder's volume is much larger, the final pressure will be lower. But the final temperature is given as 100°F, so the final state is at T = 100°F, and P = P_sat at that T, which is 0.949 psia.

Wait, but if the final pressure is 0.949 psia, then the specific volume of the vapor is 26.8 ft³/lbm. So the total vapor mass that can exist in the cylinder at that state is m_total = V / v_g = 1 / 26.8 ≈ 0.0373 lbm.

But the ampule only has 0.0098 lbm of liquid. So when it vaporizes, it can only produce 0.0098 lbm of vapor. So in the cylinder, the vapor would have a mass of 0.0098 lbm, and the specific volume would be V/m = 1 / 0.0098 ≈ 102.04 ft³/lbm.

Wait, but that's the specific volume of the vapor. Now, at T = 100°F, what is the specific volume of saturated vapor? It's 26.8 ft³/lbm. So if the actual specific volume in the cylinder is 102.04, which is higher than v_g, that would mean that the vapor is superheated, not saturated. But the problem states that the final state is at 100°F, which is the saturation temperature at P_sat = 0.949 psia. So that would imply that the vapor is saturated, but in this case, the specific volume is higher, so maybe the state is superheated vapor?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently. The final state is at T = 100°F, which is the same as the initial temperature of the liquid. Since the cylinder is evacuated, when the liquid is released, it will vaporize, but the amount of vapor is limited by the mass of the liquid.

So the process is: mass m = 0.0098 lbm of liquid at 1000 psia, 100°F, which is subcooled. When released into the cylinder, it flashes into vapor, and the final state is at T = 100°F. So the vapor can't be superheated because it's at the saturation temperature. Therefore, the pressure in the cylinder must be P_sat at 100°F, which is 0.949 psia.

Wait, but if the mass of vapor is 0.0098 lbm, then the specific volume is V/m = 1 / 0.0098 ≈ 102.04 ft³/lbm. At T = 100°F, the saturated vapor has v_g = 26.8 ft³/lbm. So 102 is much larger than 26.8, which would mean that the vapor is at a lower pressure than P_sat, which can't be because at T = 100°F, the maximum pressure for saturated vapor is P_sat. So perhaps the vapor is at P_sat, but then the mass would have to be m = V / v_g = 1 / 26.8 ≈ 0.0373 lbm, but we only have 0.0098 lbm. So that suggests that the cylinder cannot reach P_sat at 100°F with the given mass.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the final state isn't at P_sat, but at a lower pressure where all the vapor is just from the 0.0098 lbm, but then the temperature would be lower. But the problem states that the final temperature is 100°F. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the process involves both vapor and liquid. So the ampule's liquid evaporates until the pressure in the cylinder equals P_sat at 100°F, and the remaining liquid stays as liquid. So the mass of vapor would be such that the specific volume of the mixture (vapor + liquid) gives a quality x.

Wait, so the final state is a two-phase mixture (saturated liquid and vapor) at T = 100°F. So the pressure is P_sat = 0.949 psia.

In that case, the total volume of the cylinder is V = 1 ft³. The total mass is m = 0.0098 lbm.

The specific volume of the mixture is v = V/m = 1 / 0.0098 ≈ 102.04 ft³/lbm.

At T = 100°F, the specific volume of saturated liquid is v_f = 0.01772 ft³/lbm, and v_g = 26.8 ft³/lbm.

The quality x is given by:

v = v_f + x*(v_g - v_f)

So:

102.04 = 0.01772 + x*(26.8 - 0.01772)

102.04 - 0.01772 ≈ 102.022

26.8 - 0.01772 ≈ 26.782

So x ≈ 102.022 / 26.782 ≈ 3.806. Wait, that can't be right because quality can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, that suggests that the specific volume is higher than v_g, which would mean that it's superheated vapor. But the problem states that the final temperature is 100°F, which is the saturation temperature. Therefore, the state must be either saturated vapor (x=1) or a mixture (x<1), but if v > v_g, then it's superheated.

But that contradicts the given final temp. So perhaps the assumption that all the liquid evaporates is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ampule's volume is 0.3 in³, which is about 0.3 * 2.1433e-5 cubic meters, but wait, I need to convert to cubic feet. Wait, 0.3 in³ = 0.3 * (1 in³) = 0.3 * (1/1728) ft³ ≈ 0.0001736 ft³.

At 1000 psia and 100°F, the specific volume v is found from the compressed liquid tables, since it's a subcooled liquid. So v ≈ 0.01774 ft³/lbm (same as at 100°F because liquids are incompressible). So mass m = 0.0001736 / 0.01774 ≈ 0.0098 lbm, as before.

When released into the cylinder, the liquid will vaporize until it reaches the saturation state at 100°F. So the vapor generated will be at P_sat = 0.949 psia, T=100°F. The mass of vapor is m_v = x * m_total, but I'm getting confused now.

Alternatively, the total mass in the cylinder is m = 0.0098 lbm. The cylinder's volume is 1 ft³. At T=100°F, if the vapor is saturated, then v_g =26.8 ft³/lbm. So the mass of saturated vapor in 1 ft³ would be m_sat_vapor = 1 / 26.8 ≈ 0.0373 lbm. But we only have 0.0098 lbm, so the vapor specific volume is v = V/m = 1 / 0.0098 ≈ 102 ft³/lbm. Since v > v_g, this is superheated vapor. But the problem says the final temp is 100°F, so that's impossible because superheated vapor would have a higher temperature.

Wait, so maybe the final state is a mixture of liquid and vapor at T=100°F. So the pressure is P_sat=0.949 psia. Let me compute the quality.

The specific volume of the mixture is v = V/m = 1 / 0.0098 ≈ 102.04 ft³/lbm.

At T=100°F, v_f = 0.01772, v_g=26.8.

So, using v = v_f + x*(v_g - v_f):

102.04 = 0.01772 + x*(26.8 - 0.01772)

102.04 - 0.01772 = x * 26.78228

102.02228 = 26.78228 x

x ≈ 102.02228 / 26.78228 ≈ 3.807. Which is greater than 1. But quality can't be more than 1, so this suggests that all the mass is vapor, but that would require v = v_g, which is 26.8. But here, v is 102, which is way higher. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the final state isn't at T=100°F but at a lower temperature. But the problem says it reaches 100°F, so that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the ampule is at 1000 psia and 100°F. The specific volume of liquid water at 1000 psia and 100°F can be found from the compressed liquid tables. Wait, is it different from v_f at 100°F? I thought for liquids, v is approximately v_f at the given temperature, regardless of pressure, because liquids are nearly incompressible. So maybe m = 0.0001736 ft³ / 0.01774 ft³/lbm ≈ 0.0098 lbm is correct.

So, in the cylinder, the mass is 0.0098 lbm, volume 1 ft³, T=100°F. So the state is determined by these parameters.

If I consider that the final state is superheated vapor at T=100°F, but that's not possible because at T=100°F, the vapor can only exist at P_sat = 0.949 psia, and above that, it's superheated. Wait, no
