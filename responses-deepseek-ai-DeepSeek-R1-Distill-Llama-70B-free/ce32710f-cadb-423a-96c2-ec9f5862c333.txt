Question:

Why is genetic drift less important in human evolution at present than it was twenty thousand or more years ago?

Options:

A: The human genome has fully adapted to current environmental pressures
B: Modern medicine has eliminated the effects of genetic drift
C: The rate of genetic drift is directly proportional to technological advancements
D: Humans have reached a genetic equilibrium where drift is no longer possible
E: Humans have developed immunity to genetic drift
F: Genetic drift is now counteracted by the influence of cultural evolution
G: Genetic mutations are less common in present-day humans
H: Genetic drift has increased over time
I: Human evolution has stopped
J: Populations are now larger and more connected, reducing the impact of genetic drift

Okay, so I've got this question about genetic drift and human evolution. Hmm, I remember that genetic drift is a mechanism of evolution, right? It's about random changes in allele frequencies in a population over generations. It can lead to loss of genetic variation or even fixation of certain alleles.

The question is asking why genetic drift is less important now in human evolution compared to twenty thousand years ago. So I need to think about what's changed in humans over that time, particularly in terms of population dynamics.

I think back to when humans were more fragmented. Twenty thousand years ago, humans were in smaller groups, maybe hunter-gatherer tribes or small communities. These small populations would be more susceptible to genetic drift because, in smaller groups, random events can have a bigger impact on allele frequencies. Like, if a natural disaster hits a small population, it could drastically change the gene pool.

But now, the human population is huge. There are billions of people, and we're much more interconnected. So the population size is way larger. I remember that genetic drift depends a lot on population size. The smaller the population, the more significant the drift. So if the population is larger, the effect of drift becomes weaker because the gene pool is more stable.

Looking at the options:

Option J says populations are now larger and more connected, reducing genetic drift. That makes sense because a larger, connected population would have less drift.

Other options don't seem right. Option A suggests the genome is fully adapted, but evolution is ongoing. Option B says medicine eliminated drift, which isn't true because medicine affects selection, not drift. Option C links drift to technology, which I don't think is direct. Option D talks about genetic equilibrium, which I don't recall being a thing. Option E, immunity to drift? No, that's not a concept I know. Option F says cultural evolution counteracts drift, maybe, but I'm not sure how directly that affects genetic drift. Option G suggests fewer mutations now, but mutation rates are probably similar. Option H says drift increased, which contradicts the premise. Option I claims evolution stopped, which is wrong.

So the correct answer should be J. Because larger populations mean less genetic drift.

Genetic drift is a mechanism of evolution that causes random changes in allele frequencies, particularly in smaller populations where such changes can have a significant impact. Twenty thousand years ago, humans existed in smaller, more fragmented groups, making them more susceptible to genetic drift. However, the human population has since grown exponentially, with billions of individuals who are now more interconnected. Larger populations reduce the impact of genetic drift because the gene pool is more stable, making random events less likely to significantly alter allele frequencies. 

Among the options provided, the most accurate explanation is that human populations are now larger and more connected, which diminishes the effect of genetic drift.

Answer: J
