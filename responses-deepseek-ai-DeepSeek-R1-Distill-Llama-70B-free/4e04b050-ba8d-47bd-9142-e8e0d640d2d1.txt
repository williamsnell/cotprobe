Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Mary Redmond buying a home. Hmm, let's see. She bought a home for $28,500 with 20% down. So first, I think I need to figure out how much she paid as a down payment and how much she financed.

20% of 28,500... let's calculate that. 20% is 0.2, so 0.2 * 28,500. Let me do the multiplication: 28,500 * 0.2. 28,500 times 0.2 is $5,700. So the down payment is $5,700.

That means the balance she has to pay is the total price minus the down payment. So 28,500 minus 5,700 equals... 22,800. So she's financing $22,800 over 10 years, which is 120 months.

Now, the problem says there's a financing charge of 7% per year on the unpaid balance. I think this is an annual interest rate, so each month, the interest would be a portion of that. Wait, but how is this applied? So each monthly payment includes both principal and interest, right?

Wait, but sometimes in these problems, the interest is calculated monthly, but here it's 7% per year. So I might need to calculate the monthly interest rate. Oh wait, 7% annually. So the monthly interest rate would be 7% divided by 12 months. Let me compute that: 7 / 12 is approximately 0.5833% per month.

But wait, the problem says the financing charge is added to each monthly payment. So perhaps each payment has 7% per annum on the unpaid balance. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

She's paying monthly, and each payment includes some principal and some interest. The interest part is calculated on the remaining balance each month. So it's an amortizing loan, I think. So each payment is part principal, part interest. But the total amount she has to pay each month would be the same, but the split between principal and interest changes each month.

The question is asking for the total payment due for the first month. So the first month's payment would consist of the interest on the initial balance plus the principal part.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me structure this step by step.

The loan amount is $22,800. The interest rate is 7% per year, so 0.7/12 per month, which is approximately 0.0058333 (since 7% is 0.07, divided by 12 is ~0.0058333).

The loan is for 10 years, so 120 months. But we're only looking for the first month's payment.

In an amortizing loan, each payment is calculated as:

Payment = (Principal * monthly_interest_rate) / (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate)^-number_of_periods)

But wait, but the question is about the total payment for the first month. Alternatively, perhaps it's just the interest for the first month plus the principal part.

Wait no, in the first payment, part of it goes to interest, and part to principal. So the total payment is the sum of those two.

So, for the first month, the interest portion would be the monthly interest rate times the initial principal. Then, the principal portion would be the total payment minus the interest. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total monthly payment first, knowing that each payment is the same, and then see what the first payment's components are.

Wait, but the problem is phrased a bit differently. It says that a financing charge of 7% per year of the unpaid balance is added to each monthly payment. Does that mean that each payment is equal to the principal part plus 7% per annum on the remaining balance?

Wait, that's a bit unclear. Let me read it again: "a financing charge of 7% per year of the unpaid balance is to be added to each monthly payment." So the monthly payment is the principal payment plus the financing charge (interest) on the unpaid balance.

But perhaps the way it's structured is that each payment is a fixed amount, where part goes to principal and part to interest. But if the interest is 7% per year on the unpaid balance, then each month's interest would be (7% / 12) times the current unpaid balance.

So, the first step is to calculate the total monthly payment, then break it down into interest and principal for the first month.

But maybe another approach is to compute the total payment each month, which is the same. So the formula for the monthly payment (M) on a fixed-rate loan is:

M = P * [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n – 1]

Where:
P = principal loan amount = $22,800
i = monthly interest rate = 7% per annum /12 = 0.07/12 ≈ 0.0058333
n = number of payments = 10 years *12 = 120 months

So plugging the numbers in:

M = 22800 * [0.0058333*(1+0.0058333)^120] / [(1+0.0058333)^120 – 1]

Hmm, but calculating (1 + 0.0058333)^120 might be a bit tricky without a calculator. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate this value.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making this more complicated. The question is just about the first month's payment, so maybe I can compute the interest for the first month and then the principal part.

Wait, the first month's interest would be 7% annual rate on the initial $22,800, so that's 0.07 * 22800 = $1,596 per year. Divided by 12 months, that's about $133 per month in interest. So the first month's payment would have $133 as interest. The rest would go to principal.

But the problem is that the total payment is the same each month. So if the interest is $133, then the principal part would be M - 133. But wait, how do I find M? Because M is the fixed amount she pays each month.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler, and the first payment consists of the interest for the first month plus the principal part. But without knowing M, that's tricky.

Wait, maybe the way the question is phrased, the 'financing charge' is 7% per annum on the unpaid balance, which is added to each payment. So perhaps each payment is equal to (7% of the current balance)/12 plus some principal amount.

But in that case, if each payment is just the interest plus principal, the principal amount would vary each month as the balance decreases. That doesn't sound like a fixed payment plan, which is typical for mortgages. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the first month's payment, which would be the interest for the first month on the $22,800 plus the principal part, which would be the total payment minus the interest.

Wait, but without knowing the total payment, I can't compute the principal part. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the monthly payment includes 7% per annum on the unpaid balance. So perhaps each payment is 7% of the current balance divided by 12. But that would mean that each payment is just the interest, and the principal remains the same, which doesn't make sense because then she'd never pay off the principal.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem says: "a financing charge of 7% per year of the unpaid balance is to be added to each monthly payment." So each monthly payment is the principal installment plus 7% per annum on the unpaid balance.

Wait, but 7% per annum is an annual rate. So each month, the financing charge is 7% /12 of the current balance. So the monthly payment would be the principal part plus the monthly interest.

But in that case, the principal part would decrease each month as the balance decreases. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the total monthly payment is equal to the principal amount divided by the number of payments (120 months) plus the interest on the current balance.

Wait, that would be a straight-line method, where each month's principal is the same, and interest is calculated on the remaining balance.

So let's try that. The principal each month would be 22,800 / 120 = $190 per month.

The interest for the first month would be 22,800 * (7% / 12) = 22,800 * 0.0058333 ≈ 133.

So the first month's payment would be 190 (principal) + 133 (interest) = $323.

Looking at the options, option F is $323.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the principal each month is 22,800 / 120 = 190. The interest is 22800 * 0.07/12 = 133. So the total payment is 323.

But wait, another approach is to calculate the monthly payment using the loan payment formula. Let me try that.

Using the formula:

M = P [ i (1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1 ]

Where P=22800, i=0.07/12, n=120.

Calculating i: 0.07 /12 ≈ 0.0058333.

Now, (1 + i)^n = (1.0058333)^120. Let me approximate this. Since 0.0058333 is 7% annual rate, monthly.

Alternatively, knowing that (1 + 0.0058333)^120 is approximately e^(0.07 *10) since continuous compounding approximation. e^0.7 ≈ 2.01375. But more accurately, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but I don't have one, so I'll proceed with an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

But perhaps I should proceed with the formula.

But without exact calculation, maybe I can estimate M.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is $323, as per the straight-line method, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but in reality, the correct approach would be to use the amortizing formula, where each payment is the same. So the first month's interest is 22800 * 0.07/12 = 133, and the principal part is M - 133.

But since M is the fixed payment, M must satisfy the equation where the present value of all payments equals 22,800.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to be solved with the straight-line method, assuming that the principal is paid in equal installments, and the interest is calculated on the current balance each month.

In that case, the first month's payment is 190 + 133 = 323, which is option F.

But wait, let me think again. If the loan is for 120 months, and each month's principal is 190, then over 120 months, the total principal paid would be 190*120=22,800, which matches the loan amount. But the interest would be added each month on the outstanding balance.

So the first month's interest is 22800 * 0.07/12 = 133. Then the principal is 190, so total payment is 323.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer would be F: $323.

Mary Redmond purchased a home for $28,500 with 20% down, which equals $5,700. The remaining balance to be financed is $22,800 over 10 years (120 months). The financing charge is 7% per year on the unpaid balance, which translates to a monthly interest rate of approximately 0.58333% (7% divided by 12).

The total monthly payment is calculated using the loan payment formula:

\[
M = P \frac{i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 22,800 \) (loan amount),
- \( i = \frac{0.07}{12} \approx 0.0058333 \) (monthly interest rate),
- \( n = 120 \) (number of payments).

However, the question specifically asks for the total payment due for the first month. In the first month, the interest portion is calculated on the initial unpaid balance:

\[
\text{Interest for the first month} = 22,800 \times \frac{0.07}{12} \approx 133
\]

The principal portion for the first month is:

\[
\text{Principal for the first month} = \frac{22,800}{120} = 190
\]

Thus, the total payment for the first month is:

\[
\text{Total payment} = \text{Interest} + \text{Principal} = 133 + 190 = 323
\]

This matches option F. Therefore, the total payment due for the first month is **$323**.
