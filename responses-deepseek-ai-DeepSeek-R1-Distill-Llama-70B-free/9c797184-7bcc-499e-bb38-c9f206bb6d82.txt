Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about an agreement between a widget manufacturer and a widget retailer. The agreement states that the manufacturer will sell, and the retailer will buy 10,000 widgets at $50 per 100. The delivery is supposed to happen with 1,000 widgets on the first day of each of the next 10 months. It also says that each monthly delivery is a separate contract. Payment is within 10 days of each shipment.

The question is asking how this agreement is best interpreted from the given options. The options are A through J, each representing a different type of contract.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that contracts can have different classifications. Let me think about each option and see which one fits.

Option A is a bilateral contract. A bilateral contract is where both parties make promises. Here, the manufacturer promises to sell and the retailer to buy, so it's bilateral in that sense. But the question is more about the structure of the agreement, not the type of promises.

Option B is a periodic contract. Periodic contracts are usually for ongoing services, like employment contracts where the term is weekly or monthly. Not sure if that's the case here; the deliveries are monthly but each is a separate contract.

Option C says 10 separate contracts. That seems to align with the agreement stating each monthly delivery is a separate contract. So each month's delivery is its own contract, making 10 in total over 10 months.

Option D is a contract of adhesion. That's a standard form contract where one party has no ability to negotiate terms. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option E is a conditional contract. That's where the obligations are dependent on a certain condition. The agreement here doesn't mention any conditions beyond the deliveries and payments, so maybe not.

Option F is a requirements-output contract. That's when one party agrees to buy all their needs from the other, or to sell all their output. The retailer here is agreeing to buy a fixed number, 10,000, so it's not based on their requirements or the manufacturer's output. So probably not F.

Option G is a divisible contract. That's where a contract is split into parts, and each part is treated as a separate obligation. Like if you have a contract to deliver 100 widgets each month for 10 months, each month's delivery could be a division. But wait, the question says each delivery is a separate contract, not that it's one contract with separate parts. So maybe G isn't correct.

Option H is a unilateral contract. That's where only one party makes a promise. Here, both are making promises, so it's not unilateral.

Option I is a void contract. That's when the contract is unenforceable from the start, maybe due to illegality. Nothing in the question suggests that, so I can rule that out.

Option J is an installment contract. Installment contracts involve multiple deliveries but under a single agreement. For example, buying a car in monthly payments. But the question states each delivery is a separate contract, so J might not fit because installment implies a single contract with multiple parts.

Putting it all together, the key part is that each monthly delivery is a separate contract. So the agreement isn't one big contract with multiple installments, but rather 10 individual contracts. So the best interpretation would be that it's 10 separate contracts, which is option C.

Wait, but I thought about option G being a divisible contract. Divisible contracts are sometimes called entire contracts that can be split. For example, in a shipment contract, each shipment is treated as a separate obligation. But the question says each delivery is a separate contract, which sounds more like multiple contracts rather than a single divisible one. So I think C is the right answer.

The agreement between the widget manufacturer and retailer specifies that each monthly delivery of 1,000 widgets is a separate contract. This indicates that the overall agreement is not a single contract with multiple parts or installments but rather consists of 10 distinct contracts. Each delivery is treated as an independent obligation, aligning with the interpretation of the agreement as 10 separate contracts.

Answer: C
