Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about fertilization reactions, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the acrosome and cortical reactions that happen right after fertilization. It's asking what these reactions ensure. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my biology class that when a sperm meets an egg, there are several steps involved. So first, the sperm has to penetrate the outer layers of the egg. I think the acrosome reaction has something to do with that. The acrosome is at the tip of the sperm head, right? When it releases enzymes, it helps the sperm get through the zona pellucida, which is the outer layer of the egg. So that's the acrosome reaction.

Then, once the sperm touches the egg's plasma membrane, the egg undergoes the cortical reaction. I remember that this involves the release of substances from the cortical granules in the egg. These substances change the zona pellucida, making it impenetrable to other sperm. So this is a mechanism to prevent polyspermy, which is when more than one sperm fertilizes the egg. That would be bad because it could lead to abnormal development.

Wait, so the acrosome reaction helps the sperm get into the egg, and the cortical reaction helps ensure that only one sperm can enter. So together, these reactions ensure that only one sperm fertilizes the egg.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: The zygote won't divide into two embryos, producing twins. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think twinning is more about whether the embryo splits, not directly related to these reactions. So maybe not A.

Option B: The sperm will not fertilize the egg. No, because the question is about after fertilization, so this doesn't make sense.

Option C: The sperm will fertilize the ovum. That's more about the process leading to fertilization, not the result of these reactions.

Option D: The sperm fertilizes multiple eggs. No, because each egg is usually fertilized by one sperm, but I'm not sure this is what the reactions are for.

Option E: The zygote begins to divide normally. I don't think the cortical reaction directly affects zygote division. It's more about preventing multiple sperm.

Option F: One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg. That sounds right because the cortical reaction blocks other sperm.

Option G: The ovum divides into two, producing twins. That's about embryo splitting, not these reactions.

Option H: The zygote divides abnormally. No, the reactions don't cause that.

Option I: Multiple sperms fertilize the egg. That's the opposite of what happens because of the cortical reaction.

Option J: The zygote won't begin to divide. No, the zygote should start dividing normally after fertilization.

So the correct answer should be F. These reactions ensure that only one sperm fertilizes the egg, preventing polyspermy.

The acrosome and cortical reactions are critical steps in the fertilization process. The acrosome reaction allows the sperm to penetrate the egg's outer layers, while the cortical reaction involves the release of substances from the egg that modify the zona pellucida, preventing additional sperm from entering. Together, these reactions ensure that only one sperm fertilizes the egg, preventing polyspermy and ensuring normal development.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** and **G** relate to twinning, which is unrelated to these reactions.
- **B**, **C**, and **D** describe scenarios before or unrelated to the reactions' purpose.
- **E**, **H**, and **J** pertain to zygote division, which is not directly affected by these reactions.
- **F** correctly identifies that these reactions ensure only one sperm fertilizes the egg.
- **I** is incorrect as the reactions prevent multiple fertilizations.

The correct answer is **F**.

Answer: F
