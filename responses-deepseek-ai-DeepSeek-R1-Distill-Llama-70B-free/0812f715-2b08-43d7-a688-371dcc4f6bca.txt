Question:

Let a undirected graph G with edges E = {<0,1>,<0,2>,<0,3>,<0,5>,<2,3>,<2,4>,<4,5>}, which <A,B> represent Node A is connected to Node B. What is the shortest path from node 0 to node 5? Represent the path as a list.

Options:

A: [0, 1, 3, 5]
B: [0, 2, 5]
C: [0, 3, 5]
D: [0, 2, 3, 5]
E: [0, 1, 2, 5]
F: [0, 3, 2, 5]
G: [0, 1, 5]
H: [0, 5]
I: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
J: [0, 2, 4, 5]

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 in this undirected graph. The graph has nodes connected by edges as given in the set E. Let me list out the edges again to make sure I remember them correctly.

The edges are: <0,1>, <0,2>, <0,3>, <0,5>, <2,3>, <2,4>, <4,5>. So each of these represents a direct connection between the two nodes.

Wait, so node 0 is connected to 1, 2, 3, and 5 directly. Oh wait, because <0,5> is one of the edges. So that means there's a direct edge from 0 to 5. If that's the case, then the shortest path would just be [0,5], right? Because that's a direct connection, so the path length is 1.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check the options again. Option H says [0,5], which would be the shortest possible path if that edge exists. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, maybe I should double-check the edges. Oh yes, E includes <0,5>, so that's definitely a direct edge. So the shortest path is just moving from 0 to 5 in one step.

So looking at the options, option H is [0,5], which should be correct. But wait, let me make sure none of the other options have a shorter path. Well, the path length here is 1. All other options have longer paths. For example, option B is [0,2,5], which is two steps, so longer than option H.

So yeah, the correct answer should be H.

The shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is directly via the edge <0,5>, resulting in the path [0,5].

Answer: H
