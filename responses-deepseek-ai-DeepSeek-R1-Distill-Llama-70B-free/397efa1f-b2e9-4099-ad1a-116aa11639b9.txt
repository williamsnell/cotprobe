Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about research methods, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking about a type of research where there's no manipulation done, and the variables are just measured, not manipulated. So, I'm trying to remember what I learned about different research designs. 

I remember that in experiments, researchers typically manipulate variables to see the effect. So any experimental research probably isn't the answer here because they involve manipulation. Let's look at the options.

Option A is Qualitative Research. Qualitative research focuses more on understanding concepts, thoughts, or experiences. It's often about exploring and getting in-depth insights rather than manipulating variables. But does it involve measuring variables without manipulation? I think it does because qualitative methods like interviews or observations don't usually involve changing variables.

Option B is Exploratory Research. This type is about exploring a topic to gain insights. It might involve asking questions to understand a problem better, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about not manipulating variables. It's more about the initial stages of research rather than the method of handling variables.

Option C is Longitudinal Research. Longitudinal studies involve studying the same subjects over a period of time. This could involve measuring variables at different points but doesn't necessarily mean there's no manipulation. Wait, no—longitudinal can be observational, where you just observe changes without interfering. So that might fit, but I'm not entirely sure if it's the best fit compared to other options.

Option D is True Experimental Research. In true experiments, variables are manipulated to see the effect. So this is definitely not the answer since the question specifies no manipulation.

Option E is Quasi-Experimental Research. Quasi-experiments also involve some manipulation but without full control over variables, like not having a random assignment. So again, manipulation is involved, so E isn't the answer.

Option F is Correlational Research. Correlational studies look for relationships between variables without manipulating them. The researcher measures variables as they are to see if there's a correlation. So this seems to fit the description because there's no manipulation—just measuring to find associations.

Option G is Developmental Research. Developmental studies look at changes over time, perhaps across different age groups. It's similar to longitudinal but might focus on developmental stages. I'm not sure if this necessarily involves manipulation, but it could be either way.

So, thinking back: the question is about research with no manipulation, just measuring variables. Correlational research (F) and qualitative (A) both don't involve manipulation. But the question is more about variables being measured, not manipulated, which is more of a quantitative approach. Qualitative might not even use variables in the same way. So correlational research is about measuring variables to find relationships without changing them. That makes F the correct answer.

Wait, but what about longitudinal? Longitudinal can be observational, so variables are measured over time without manipulation. So could that also fit? Hmm, but correlational is specifically about looking for relationships between variables without manipulation. So the best fit is F.

In research where there is no manipulation of variables and they are simply measured, the correct answer is **CORRELATIONAL RESEARCH**. This type of research focuses on identifying relationships between variables without altering them, fitting the description provided.

Answer: F
