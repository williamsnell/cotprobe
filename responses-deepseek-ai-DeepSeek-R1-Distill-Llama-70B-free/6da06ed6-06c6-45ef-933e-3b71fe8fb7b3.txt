Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about international law, specifically about treaties and whether they bind third states. Hmm, I remember from my studies that treaties are agreements between states, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details about third parties. Let me think through this.

The question is asking if treaties bind third states, which are non-state parties. So, the options are about whether treaties create obligations or rights for these third states, and whether consent is involved.

I recall the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) has something about this. I think it's Article 34 or 35. Oh right, Article 34 states that a treaty doesn't create obligations or rights for a third state unless that state has consented. So, unless the third state agrees, they're not bound.

Looking at the options:

Option A says treaties don't create obligations or rights without consent. That aligns with what I remember. So A seems correct.

Option B says they create both obligations and rights, which doesn't sound right because the default is that third states aren't bound unless they consent.

Option C says no rights even with consent. Wait, no, because if a third state consents, maybe they can have rights. So C is incorrect.

Option D says only obligations, but I think it's neither without consent, so D is wrong.

Option E says obligations without consent, which contradicts the VCLT, so E is incorrect.

Option F says only rights, which again, no, because rights would require consent too.

Option G says no obligations or rights even with consent. That can't be right because if the third state consents, then they can be bound. So G is wrong.

Option H says rights without consent, which isn't the case, so H is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is based on the principle that treaties do not impose obligations or create rights for third states without their consent, as outlined in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), specifically Article 34. This means that third states are not bound by a treaty unless they explicitly agree to it. 

Option A correctly reflects this principle, stating that treaties do not create obligations or rights for third states without their consent. All other options either incorrectly suggest that treaties bind third states without consent or misrepresent the conditions under which third states can be affected by a treaty.

Answer: A
