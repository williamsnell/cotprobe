Okay, so I've got this math problem here: estimate 711 plus 497. The question is asking the sum to be between which numbers, and there are several options to choose from. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, first, I need to add 711 and 497. But wait, the question says to estimate, so maybe I don't need the exact sum. Estimating usually involves rounding to make the calculation easier. So let me try rounding each number to the nearest hundred.

711 is close to 700, right? And 497 is almost 500. So if I round 711 down to 700 and 497 up to 500, that makes it easier. Then, adding 700 and 500 gives me 1,200. Hmm, but wait, that's a rough estimate. Let me check if I should adjust that.

Alternatively, maybe I should round 711 up to 700 (since 711 is just a bit over 700) and 497 up to 500. So again, 700 plus 500 is 1,200. But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. 711 is 700 plus 11, and 497 is 500 minus 3. So when I add them together, it's (700 + 500) + (11 - 3) = 1200 + 8 = 1208. Oh, so the exact sum is 1208.

But the question is about estimating, so the options probably give a range. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 2,000 and 2,200 – that's way too high. Our sum is 1,208, so no way.

Option B: 50 and 400 – too low.

Option C: 750 and 1,000 – our sum is 1,208, so above 1,000, so this isn't correct.

Option D: 1,500 and 1,700 – 1,208 is less than 1,500, so no.

Option E: 450 and 700 – too low.

Option F: 400 and 650 – also too low.

Option G: 1,300 and 1,500 – Hmm, 1,208 is below 1,300, so this isn't correct.

Option H: 500 and 750 – too low.

Option I: 1,700 and 1,900 – too high.

Option J: 1,050 and 1,300 – 1,208 falls into this range because 1,208 is greater than 1,050 and less than 1,300.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. 711 + 497. Let me add them exactly:

711
+497
= ?

Adding the units place: 1+7=8.

Tens place: 1+9=10, so carry over 1.

Hundreds place: 7+4=11, plus the carried 1 makes 12.

So the sum is 1208. Correct.

Now looking at the options again.

Option J is 1,050 to 1,300. 1208 is within that range, right? Because 1,050 is 1050, and 1,208 is between that and 1,300.

Wait, but let me check all options again.

Option A: 2000-2200 – no.

Option J: 1050-1300 – yes.

So the correct answer should be option J.

Wait, but wait another thought: Could I have made a mistake in the initial estimation? Because sometimes when you round, you might go too high or low. Let me see.

If I round 711 to 700 and 497 to 500, adding them gives 1200. But the actual sum is 1208, which is just a bit over. So the estimate is 1200, but the exact is 1208. So the range should include around 1200. Option J is 1050-1300, so 1208 is definitely in there.

So yes, the answer is option J.

To estimate the sum of 711 and 497, we can round the numbers to make the calculation easier. Rounding 711 to 700 and 497 to 500 gives us 700 + 500 = 1,200. However, the exact sum is calculated as follows:

```
  711
+ 497
------
= 1,208
```

The question asks for the range within which the sum falls. Among the given options, the range **1,050 and 1,300** (Option J) includes the exact sum of 1,208. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J
