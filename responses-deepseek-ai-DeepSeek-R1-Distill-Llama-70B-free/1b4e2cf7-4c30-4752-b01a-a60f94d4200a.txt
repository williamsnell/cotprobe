Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral of z squared divided by (z minus 5) dz, and the path is the circle where the absolute value of z is 2. Hmm, right. I remember from my complex analysis class that integrals like this often involve Cauchy's theorem or the residue theorem. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the function inside the integral is f(z) = z²/(z-5). The contour c is the circle |z|=2, which is a closed curve. I should check if this function is analytic inside and on the contour. Wait, analyticity is crucial here. So, the function f(z) has a denominator (z-5), which is zero when z=5. That's a singularity, specifically a simple pole since the denominator is linear.

Now, where is z=5 located concerning the contour |z|=2? The circle |z|=2 has a radius of 2, centered at the origin. The point z=5 is outside this circle because its magnitude is 5, which is greater than 2. So, the singularity at z=5 is outside the contour c.

Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic inside and on a closed contour, then the integral around that contour is zero. Since f(z) is analytic everywhere except at z=5, and z=5 is outside our contour, f(z) is analytic in the region enclosed by |z|=2. So, by Cauchy's theorem, the integral should be zero.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Another thought comes to mind: maybe I should try expanding the function or use the residue theorem. The residue theorem says that the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. But if there are no singularities inside, then the residue is zero, so the integral is zero. That aligns with Cauchy's theorem.

Just to double-check, let's think about Laurent series. The function f(z) = z²/(z-5) can be rewritten as f(z) = -z²/(5 - z) = -(z²)/(5(1 - z/5)) = -(z²/5) * [1/(1 - z/5)]. Since |z| <5 (because |z|=2 <5), the series expansion for 1/(1 - z/5) is 1 + z/5 + (z/5)^2 + ... So the function f(z) can be expressed as a power series with no negative powers of z. Therefore, the residue (the coefficient of 1/(z) ) is zero. So the integral is zero.

Hmm, but wait, another approach: maybe I can use substitution. Let me see. Let me set w = z -5, but I don't think that helps much here because the contour is |z|=2, which would translate to |w +5|=2, which is a circle of radius 2 centered at w=-5. But the point w=0 (since w= z-5, and z=5 is the singularity) is at w=0, which is outside the circle |w+5|=2. Because the distance from w=0 to the center at -5 is 5, which is greater than the radius 2. So again, the singularity is outside the contour, so the integral is zero.

So putting it all together, I think the integral is zero, which corresponds to option B.

To evaluate the integral $\int_c \frac{z^2}{z - 5} \, dz$, where $c$ is the circle $|z| = 2$, we analyze the function $f(z) = \frac{z^2}{z - 5}$. This function has a singularity at $z = 5$, which is a simple pole. The contour $|z| = 2$ is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, and the point $z = 5$ lies outside this circle since $|5| > 2$. 

By Cauchy's theorem, if a function is analytic inside and on a closed contour, the integral over that contour is zero. Here, $f(z)$ is analytic everywhere except at $z = 5$, and since $z = 5$ is outside the contour, $f(z)$ is analytic in the region enclosed by $|z| = 2$. Therefore, the integral is zero.

Additionally, using the residue theorem, the integral is $2\pi i$ times the sum of residues inside the contour. Since there are no singularities inside $|z| = 2$, the residue sum is zero, and the integral evaluates to zero.

Thus, the correct answer is:

B: 0

Answer: B
