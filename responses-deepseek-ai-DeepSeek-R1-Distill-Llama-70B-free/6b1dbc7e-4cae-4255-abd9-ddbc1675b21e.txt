Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about the standard enthalpy of formation of a compound called H3NSO2. I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

Alright, the problem says that the standard enthalpy of decomposition of H3NSO2 into NH3 and SO2 is +40 kJ per mole. Hmm. Wait, decomposition... so the reaction is breaking down into two other substances. So the reaction must be something like H3NSO2 decomposing into NH3 and SO2.

Let me write that out. The decomposition reaction would be:

H3NSO2(s) → NH3(g) + SO2(g)

And the enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH_decomp) is +40 kJ/mol. Since the enthalpy is positive, this is an endothermic reaction. That makes sense because breaking bonds requires energy.

But wait, the question is about the standard enthalpy of formation of H3NSO2. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I need to relate this decomposition reaction to the formation reactions of the individual substances.

Let me recall some standard enthalpies of formation. I think the standard enthalpy of formation for NH3 is negative because it's exothermic when nitrogen and hydrogen form ammonia. Similarly, SO2 is formed from S and O2, right? And for elements in their standard states, like N2, H2, S, and O2, their ΔHf° is zero.

So the decomposition reaction is the reverse of the formation of H3NSO2. Let me think: the formation of H3NSO2 would be from its elements. Let's write that formation reaction.

Formation reaction for H3NSO2 would be:

(1/2) N2(g) + (3/2) H2(g) + (1/2) S(s) + O2(g) → H3NSO2(s)

Wait, how did I get that? Because H3NSO2 has one N, three H, one S, and two O. So the elements would be N2 gas (so 1/2 mole), H2 gas (3/2 mole), S as a solid (1/2 mole), and O2 gas (1 mole, since two O atoms come from one O2 molecule). So that makes sense.

The ΔHf° for H3NSO2 is the enthalpy change when this reaction happens. So if I can find ΔHf° for H3NSO2, that's the answer.

Now, the decomposition reaction is the reverse. So the decomposition is H3NSO2 → NH3 + SO2. Let me write the formation reactions for NH3 and SO2, and then see how they relate.

Formation of NH3: (1/2) N2 + (3/2) H2 → NH3; ΔHf°(NH3) is a known value. I think it's about -46 kJ/mol, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should remember that, or perhaps I can figure it out from other data.

Formation of SO2: S(s) + O2 → SO2; ΔHf°(SO2) is another value. I think it's around -296 kJ/mol. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers, but I'll go with that for now, assuming the problem provides standard data.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the ΔHf° values for NH3 and SO2. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to use the given decomposition data and some other relationships. Let me think.

The decomposition reaction is H3NSO2 → NH3 + SO2; ΔH_decomp = +40 kJ/mol. Since decomposition is the reverse of formation, perhaps I can write the formation of H3NSO2 in terms of the decomposition.

Let me consider the enthalpy changes. The decomposition reaction has ΔH = +40 kJ/mol, which is endothermic. So the reverse reaction (formation of H3NSO2 from NH3 and SO2) would have ΔH = -40 kJ/mol.

Wait, no. Wait, the formation of H3NSO2 from its elements is different from forming it from NH3 and SO2. I need to relate these somehow.

Perhaps I should use Hess's Law. Let me try to break it down.

Let me write down each reaction's enthalpy.

1. Formation of NH3: (1/2)N2 + (3/2)H2 → NH3(g); ΔH1 = ΔHf°(NH3) = let's say X kJ/mol.

2. Formation of SO2: S(s) + O2 → SO2(g); ΔH2 = ΔHf°(SO2) = Y kJ/mol.

3. Decomposition of H3NSO2: H3NSO2(s) → NH3(g) + SO2(g); ΔH3 = +40 kJ/mol.

I need to find ΔHf°(H3NSO2), which is the enthalpy change for the reaction:

(1/2)N2 + (3/2)H2 + (1/2)S + O2 → H3NSO2.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the decomposition reaction in terms of the formation reactions.

Another approach: The decomposition reaction can be thought of as the sum of the reverse of the formation of H3NSO2 and the sum of the formation of the products.

Hmm, maybe I should write equations in terms of the desired formation reaction.

Let me denote the formation of H3NSO2 as reaction A:

A: (1/2 N2) + (3/2 H2) + (1/2 S) + O2 → H3NSO2; ΔH_A = ΔHf°(H3NSO2)

The decomposition reaction is the reverse of A, but wait, no. The decomposition is into NH3 and SO2, which are different from the elements. So maybe I need to consider the formation reactions of NH3 and SO2.

Wait, perhaps I can write the decomposition as the sum of two formation reactions minus the formation of H3NSO2.

Let me think: The decomposition reaction is H3NSO2 → NH3 + SO2. So in terms of enthalpy, it's the sum of the formation enthalpies of NH3 and SO2 minus the formation of H3NSO2.

Wait, no. Because the decomposition is H3NSO2 going to NH3 and SO2, which are products. So the enthalpy change for decomposition would be the sum of the heats of formation of the products minus the reactant.

Wait, no, more accurately, the enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the heats of formation of the products (each multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficient) minus the sum of the heats of formation of the reactants.

In this case, the decomposition reaction is H3NSO2 → NH3 + SO2.

So ΔH_decomp = [ΔHf°(NH3) + ΔHf°(SO2)] - [ΔHf°(H3NSO2)]

Because the reactant is H3NSO2, and the products are NH3 and SO2.

Wait, is that correct? Because for the reaction aA → bB + cC, the ΔH is [bΔHf(B) + cΔHf(C)] - [aΔHf(A)].

Yes, that's right.

So in this case, the reaction is 1 H3NSO2 → 1 NH3 + 1 SO2.

So ΔH_decomp = [1*ΔHf(NH3) + 1*ΔHf(SO2)] - [1*ΔHf(H3NSO2)].

We know ΔH_decomp is +40 kJ/mol.

So:

40 = [ΔHf(NH3) + ΔHf(SO2)] - ΔHf(H3NSO2)

We need to find ΔHf(H3NSO2), so rearranging:

ΔHf(H3NSO2) = [ΔHf(NH3) + ΔHf(SO2)] - 40

Now, I need the values for ΔHf of NH3 and SO2.

Wait, I should remember their standard values. Let me try to recall:

ΔHf° for NH3 is about -46 kJ/mol. For SO2, it's around -296 kJ/mol. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, I might be mixing up the values.

Wait, yes, let's confirm this. The standard enthalpy of formation for NH3 is -45.9 kJ/mol. Wait, or was it -46? Let's say approximately -46 kJ/mol. For SO2, it's approximately -296 kJ/mol. I think that's correct.

So substituting these numbers:

ΔHf(H3NSO2) = (-46) + (-296) - 40

Wait, wait, let me compute that. (-46) + (-296) = -342. Then subtract 40? No, wait the equation is [ (sum of products) - (reactant) ].

Wait the equation was ΔH_decomp = sum(products) - sum(reactants), but the reactant is H3NSO2, which is 1 mole, so sum(reactants) is ΔHf(H3NSO2).

Wait no, the formula we derived was:

40 = [ΔHf(NH3) + ΔHf(SO2)] - ΔHf(H3NSO2)

So solving for ΔHf(H3NSO2) gives:

ΔHf(H3NSO2) = [ΔHf(NH3) + ΔHf(SO2)] - 40

So substituting the numbers:

ΔHf(H3NSO2) = (-46) + (-296) - 40

Wait, no! Because the equation is 40 = [ (ΔHf_NH3 + ΔHf_SO2) ] - ΔHf_H3NSO2

So rearranged:

ΔHf_H3NSO2 = (ΔHf_NH3 + ΔHf_SO2) - 40

So, substituting:

= (-46) + (-296) - 40? Wait, no. That would be -46 -296 = -342, then minus 40 gives -382.

Wait, but wait, no, that can't be right. Because the equation is [sum of products] - [sum of reactants], which in this case is (Δf_NH3 + Δf_SO2) - (Δf_H3NSO2) = 40.

Wait, maybe I got the equation wrong. Let me rederive it.

The decomposition reaction is H3NSO2 → NH3 + SO2.

The standard enthalpy change for this reaction is given as +40 kJ/mol.

The formula for ΔH of a reaction is sum (Δf products) - sum (Δf reactants).

In this reaction, the reactant is pure H3NSO2, and the products are NH3 and SO2.

So, ΔH_decomp = [Δf(NH3) + Δf(SO2)] - [Δf(H3NSO2)]

We're given that ΔH_decomp is +40 kJ/mol.

So,

40 = [Δf(NH3) + Δf(SO2)] - Δf(H3NSO2)

We can rearrange this to solve for Δf(H3NSO2):

Δf(H3NSO2) = [Δf(NH3) + Δf(SO2)] - 40

So yes, that's correct.

Now, substituting the values.

Δf(NH3) is approximately -46 kJ/mol.

Δf(SO2) is approximately -296 kJ/mol.

So,

Δf(H3NSO2) = (-46) + (-296) -40

Wait, no. Because [Δf(NH3) + Δf(SO2)] is (-46 + (-296)) = (-342) kJ/mol.

Then subtract 40? Wait no, because it's [Δf_NH3 + Δf_SO2] - 40.

So,

Δf(H3NSO2) = (-342) - 40 = -382 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me check the arithmetic. -46 plus -296 is indeed -342. Then subtract 40 gives -382.

Looking at the options:

The options are:

A: -350 kJ/mol

B: -420

C: -400

D: -310

E: -365

F: -435

G: -280

H: -460

I: -330

J: -383

Hmm, option J is -383, which is very close to my calculated -382. But wait, perhaps the exact values of Δf for NH3 and SO2 are slightly different. For instance, if NH3 is -45.9 and SO2 is -296.1, then let's recalculate.

Let me use more precise numbers. Let me check exact values.

Standard enthalpy of formation for NH3 is about -45.9 kJ/mol.

For SO2, it's about -296.8 kJ/mol.

So, sum = (-45.9) + (-296.8) = -342.7.

Then subtract 40: -342.7 -40 = -382.7 kJ/mol.

So approximately -383, which matches option J.

Wait, but wait another thing. The decomposition reaction is written as H3NSO2 → NH3 + SO2; ΔH = +40 kJ/mol. So the calculation seems correct.

But let me make sure I didn't mix up the sign. Because when you reverse a reaction, the ΔH changes sign. So the formation of H3NSO2 would have a ΔH of -40 kJ/mol if the decomposition is +40. Wait, no, because the decomposition is the breakdown into products, which are not the elements.

Wait, no, because the decomposition is not into the elements, but into NH3 and SO2, which have their own Δf values. So the approach we took earlier is correct.

Alternatively, let's think about the overall process. The formation of H3NSO2 from elements is the reverse of decomposing into elements. But in this problem, it's decomposing into other compounds, so we need to account for their formation enthalpies.

Wait, maybe another approach would help confirm. Let me write all the reactions.

Reaction 1: Formation of NH3.

(1/2)N2 + (3/2)H2 → NH3; ΔH1 = Δf(NH3) = -45.9 kJ/mol.

Reaction 2: Formation of SO2.

S + O2 → SO2; ΔH2 = Δf(SO2) = -296.8 kJ/mol.

Reaction 3: Decomposition of H3NSO2.

H3NSO2 → NH3 + SO2; ΔH3 = +40 kJ/mol.

We need to find the ΔHf for H3NSO2, which is Reaction 4:

(1/2)N2 + (3/2)H2 + (1/2)S + O2 → H3NSO2; ΔH4 = ?

Now, to get Reaction 4, perhaps we can combine Reactions 1 and 2 and subtract Reaction 3.

Wait, let me think. Let me write Reaction 4 as the sum of Reactions 1 and 2, minus Reaction 3.

Wait, no. Because Reaction 3 is H3NSO2 → NH3 + SO2. So if I reverse Reaction 3, I get NH3 + SO2 → H3NSO2; ΔH = -40 kJ/mol.

Then, sum Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, which produce NH3 and SO2, and then Reaction 3 reversed, which consumes NH3 and SO2 to produce H3NSO2.

So overall, the sum would be:

Reaction 1: (1/2 N2 + 3/2 H2 → NH3; ΔH1 = -45.9)

Reaction 2: (S + O2 → SO2; ΔH2 = -296.8)

Reverse Reaction 3: (NH3 + SO2 → H3NSO2; ΔH = -40)

Adding them:

(1/2 N2 + 3/2 H2) + (S + O2) + (NH3 + SO2) → NH3 + SO2 + H3NSO2

Wait, but that's not right. Let's see:

Reaction 1 produces NH3.

Reaction 2 produces SO2.

Reverse Reaction 3 consumes NH3 and SO2 to produce H3NSO2.

So adding all three reactions:

Reaction 1 + Reaction 2 + Reverse Reaction 3:

(1/2 N2 + 3/2 H2) + (S + O2) → NH3 + SO2

NH3 + SO2 → H3NSO2

Overall:

(1/2 N2 + 3/2 H2) + (S + O2) → H3NSO2

Which is exactly Reaction 4, the formation of H3NSO2.

So the overall ΔH for Reaction 4 is ΔH1 + ΔH2 + ΔH_reverse3.

ΔH4 = (-45.9) + (-296.8) + (-40)

Wait, because ΔH_reverse3 is -40. So:

ΔH4 = (-45.9) + (-296.8) + (-40) = (-45.9 -296.8) = -342.7; then -342.7 -40 = -382.7 kJ/mol.

So that gives the same result as earlier, about -383 kJ/mol, which is option J.

So the correct answer should be J: -383 kJ/mol.

To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{H}_3\mathrm{NSO}_2$, we start with the given decomposition reaction:

\[
\mathrm{H}_3\mathrm{NSO}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{NH}_3 + \mathrm{SO}_2 \quad \Delta H_{\text{decomp}} = +40 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

The standard enthalpy of formation of a compound is the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For $\mathrm{H}_3\mathrm{NSO}_2$, the formation reaction is:

\[
\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{N}_2 + \frac{3}{2}\mathrm{H
