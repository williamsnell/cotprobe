Question:

Explain the mechanism of the genetic determination of sex in man .

Options:

A: The temperature during embryonic development determines the sex.
B: The presence of an X or Y chromosome in the mother determines the sex of the offspring.
C: The presence of the X chromosome determines the sex.
D: The sex is determined by environmental factors after birth.
E: The presence of two Y chromosomes determines that an individual will be male.
F: The presence of the Y chromosome determines that an individual will be male. Fertilization of the X-bearing egg by an X-bearing sperm results in a female offspring, and by a Y-bearing sperm results in a male offspring.
G: The number of chromosomes determines the sex.
H: The sex is determined by the mother's genetic contribution exclusively.
I: The presence of two X chromosomes results in a male offspring.
J: The size of the chromosomes determines the sex.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about how sex is determined in humans. I remember from my biology class that sex determination in mammals, including humans, is typically chromosomal. So the basics are that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and one pair determines sex.

Wait, right, the sex chromosomes. They're X and Y. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y (XY). So the sex of the offspring depends on which sex chromosome the father contributes because the mother always gives an X.

Oh, right, the father's sperm can carry either an X or a Y chromosome. So if the sperm is X, the baby will be XX (female), and if it's Y, the baby will be XY (male). So the presence of the Y chromosome determines maleness because that's where the genes for male development are, like the SRY gene.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says temperature determines sex. No, that's more about reptiles, like turtles, where incubation temperature decides sex. Humans don't do that.

Option B says the mother's X or Y determines the sex. Wait, the mother can't contribute a Y because her sex chromosomes are XX. So this option is incorrect because the mother doesn't have a Y to give.

Option C: Presence of X determines sex. Hmm, but both males and females have X. For example, males are XY, so presence of X doesn't alone determine female. So this doesn't seem right.

Option D: Environmental factors after birth. No, sex is determined at conception, not after birth. Environmental factors can influence gender identity, but not the biological sex.

Option E: Two Y chromosomes make male. Wait, humans with two Ys (like XYY) are still male, but the typical male has XY. So presence of two Ys isn't the determinant. It's the presence of at least one Y that matters.

Option F: This seems detailed. It says the presence of Y determines male. And explains that the egg (from mother) has X, and sperm can be X or Y. So if sperm is X, female (XX); if Y, male (XY). That sounds correct because the Y's presence triggers male development.

Option G: Number of chromosomes determines sex. No, humans have 46 chromosomes, same for both sexes. The difference is just in the sex chromosomes, not the count.

Option H: Mother's contribution only. No, because the father's sperm decides whether it's X or Y. So it's both parents contributing, but the father's determines the sex.

Option I: Two Xs make male. No, two Xs (XX) make female. So this is incorrect.

Option J: Size of chromosomes. No, the size isn't the factor, it's which chromosome (X vs Y) is present.

So the correct answer should be option F because it correctly explains that the Y chromosome determines male sex, and the process of fertilization with X or Y sperm from the father determines the offspring's sex.

The genetic determination of sex in humans is based on the presence of specific sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The sex of the offspring is determined by the father, as the mother always contributes an X chromosome during fertilization. The father's sperm can carry either an X or a Y chromosome. If the sperm contributes an X, the offspring will be female (XX). If it contributes a Y, the offspring will be male (XY). The presence of the Y chromosome, particularly the SRY gene it carries, is critical for male development. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Temperature determines sex in some reptiles, not humans.
- **B**: Incorrect. The mother only contributes an X chromosome, not a Y.
- **C**: Incorrect. Both males and females have an X chromosome; its presence alone does not determine sex.
- **D**: Incorrect. Sex is determined at conception, not by environmental factors after birth.
- **E**: Incorrect. Two Y chromosomes (e.g., XYY) are rare but still result in males; however, typical males have one Y.
- **F**: Correct. Explains that the Y chromosome determines male sex and describes the role of the father's sperm in sex determination.
- **G**: Incorrect. The number of chromosomes is the same in males and females; it is the specific sex chromosomes that matter.
- **H**: Incorrect. While the mother contributes an X, the father's contribution (X or Y) determines the sex.
- **I**: Incorrect. Two X chromosomes result in a female, not a male.
- **J**: Incorrect. The size of the chromosomes is irrelevant; it is the type of chromosome (X or Y) that determines sex.

The correct answer is **F**, as it accurately describes the mechanism of sex determination in humans.
