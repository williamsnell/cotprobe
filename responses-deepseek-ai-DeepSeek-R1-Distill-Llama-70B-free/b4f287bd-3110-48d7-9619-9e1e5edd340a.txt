Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the formulas yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

The problem is about a particle being projected horizontally. The velocity given is 1e4 m/s, and it's moving at right angles to a horizontal magnetic field. The magnetic field's induction is 4.9e-5 Wb/m². The particle carries a single electronic charge and stays in the same horizontal plane. We need to find its mass from the given options.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it experiences a force called the Lorentz force. The formula for that is F = q(v × B), and since the motion is perpendicular, the force is maximum, so F = qvB.

Wait, but wait. Because the particle is moving in a magnetic field, it should undergo circular motion, right? Because the force would act as a centripetal force. So in that case, the Lorentz force provides the necessary centripetal force to keep the particle moving in a circle.

Oh right, so the equation would be qvB = (mv²)/r, where r is the radius of the circular path. But wait, the question doesn't give us the radius. Hmm, maybe I don't need it. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the particle stays in the same horizontal plane. Oh, that's interesting. So maybe the magnetic force is vertical, providing the necessary centripetal force without affecting the horizontal motion. But wait, the particle is moving right in the horizontal direction, and the magnetic field is horizontal too. Oh wait, but the particle's velocity is at right angles to the magnetic field. So the magnetic field must be perpendicular to the velocity. So if the velocity is horizontal, the magnetic field must be vertical, or the other way around?

Wait, no. The problem says the particle's velocity is at right angles to the magnetic field. So if the magnetic field is horizontal, then the velocity is vertical? Or vice versa? Wait, no, the problem says the particle is projected horizontally. So velocity is horizontal. Therefore, the magnetic field must be vertical, because the velocity and magnetic field are at right angles.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the magnetic field is horizontal. Oh wait, let me check again. The question states: "a horizontal magnetic field of induction". So the B field is horizontal. And the particle is moving horizontally, right? So if the velocity is horizontal and the magnetic field is horizontal, but the velocity is at right angles to B. Oh, right, so the velocity and B are perpendicular.

Wait, but if both are horizontal, how can they be perpendicular? Oh, maybe the velocity is in one horizontal direction (like east), and the magnetic field is in another horizontal direction (like north), making them perpendicular. So the angle between them is 90 degrees.

So the force on the particle would be F = qvB sin(theta), which here is 90 degrees, so sin(theta) is 1. So F = qvB.

But since the particle is moving in a circular path in the horizontal plane, the magnetic force must be providing the centripetal force. So F = (mv²)/r, but perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, another thought. The radius of the circular path can be found from the equation r = mv/(qB). But again, the problem doesn't give r. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem doesn't ask for the radius or the trajectory; it just asks for the mass. So perhaps I can relate the variables without needing r.

Wait, the particle's path is a circle because the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity. So the centripetal acceleration is provided by the magnetic force.

So, setting the magnetic force equal to the centripetal force:

qvB = (mv²)/r

But wait, if we solve for r, it's r = mv/(qB). But without knowing r, how can we find m? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says the particle stays in the same horizontal plane. So perhaps the vertical motion is zero. Wait, but the particle is projected horizontally, so its initial vertical velocity is zero. But if the magnetic force is acting perpendicular to the velocity, which is horizontal, then the force would be vertical, causing it to move in a circular path in the horizontal plane. Wait, that makes sense. So the magnetic force acts as the centripetal force, keeping it moving in the circle.

But without knowing the radius, maybe we can find m in terms of the given quantities.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the relationship between the velocity, magnetic field, charge, and mass. Let me rearrange the equation.

From F = qvB = mv²/r → r = mv/(qB)

But if I solve for m, m = (qB r)/(v)

Wait, but I don't have r. Hmm. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: Since the particle moves in a circular path, the time period T of its motion is T = 2πr/v.

But again, without r, I don't see how to proceed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look back at the question. Oh, wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the radius or the time period. So perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, the problem states that the particle is projected horizontally and stays in the same horizontal plane. So perhaps the net vertical force is zero. But the magnetic force is vertical, so maybe the only force is the magnetic one, providing the centripetal acceleration.

Wait, but that doesn't help me directly find the mass. Let me think about the variables:

Given:
v = 1e4 m/s
B = 4.9e-5 T
q = e (charge of electron, but wait, the problem says 'single electronic charge', so q = 1.6e-19 C?)

Wait, but wait, the elementary charge is approximately 1.602e-19 C. So yes, q = 1.6e-19 C.

We need to find m.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Wait, the equation I have is qvB = (mv²)/r → m = (qvB r)/v² = (qB r)/v.

But still, I don't have r. Hmm. So maybe I need to find another relation.

Wait, perhaps the radius isn't needed because it's canceled out. Wait, maybe I can think in terms of angular frequency or cyclotron frequency.

Oh, right! The cyclotron frequency is ω = (qB)/m. So the angular velocity is independent of the radius and velocity. So maybe that's a way to find m.

But wait, we don't have ω given. Hmm. So maybe not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the units. The options are in kg, so I need to find m in kg.

Let me write down all the known quantities:

v = 1e4 m/s
B = 4.9e-5 T
q = 1.6e-19 C (assuming it's an electron charge)
We need to find m.

From the equation qvB = (mv²)/r → solving for m, m = (qB r)/(v)

But without r, I can't find m. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the fact that the particle stays in the same horizontal plane implies that it's moving in a circle in that plane, so the acceleration is horizontal. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe there's another way. Suppose the magnetic force provides the necessary centripetal force, so F = qvB = (mv^2)/r → so r = mv/(qB). But again, without r, can't compute m.

Wait, perhaps I can express m in terms of the other variables. Let's see.

Wait, the problem gives the velocity and B field, and the charge. So maybe solving for m using another relation. Wait, perhaps if I multiply both sides by r, I get m v = q B r. But I don't know r, so I can't compute m.

Wait, maybe the question expects me to use the relation m = (qB)/(v) * r, but without knowing r, I'm stuck.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a key insight. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "stays in the same horizontal plane." So the net force is only the magnetic force providing the centripetal acceleration, and there's no vertical motion. So the magnetic force is entirely in the vertical direction, providing the necessary centripetal force for circular motion in the horizontal plane.

Wait, but the velocity is horizontal, so the magnetic force (which is v cross B) would be vertical. So the centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r, and that's provided by the magnetic force.

So, F = qvB = m a = m (v² / r)

Again, same equation.

Wait, but I still don't have 'r' given. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the particle is moving in a circle, and perhaps the radius is determined by the Earth's magnetic field. No, the problem doesn't mention Earth's field; it's a given B.

Wait, maybe the particle is moving in a circular path, but since no other forces are acting (like gravity is negligible or perpendicular), the only force is the magnetic one.

Wait, but I'm still stuck because I don't have 'r' to find 'm'.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem doesn't require 'r' because it's asking for the mass, which can be found via another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula to use is m = (qB)/(v) * r, but without 'r', how?

Wait, another approach. Let me rearrange the equation to solve for m:

From F = qvB = mv² / r → m = (qvB * r) / v² = qB r / v

But without knowing r, I can't find m. So perhaps there's another way.

Wait, maybe I can find 'r' from the problem's context, but the problem doesn't give any more information. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me re-read the problem.

Ah! Wait, the particle is projected horizontally, and it's moving at right angles to the magnetic field. So the initial velocity is perpendicular to B.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the path or radius. So how can we find m without knowing r?

Hmm. Maybe the problem is assuming that the radius is such that the mass can be expressed in terms of the given quantities. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the only horizontal force is the magnetic force, which is providing the centripetal acceleration. So maybe the mass can be found using the equation m = (qB * r) / (v). But again, without r, this isn't possible.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I'm missing a formula. Let's think differently. Could the problem be using the relation for the radius of the path and perhaps the velocity and B field to find m indirectly?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the equation m = (qB)/(v) * r, but without r, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another formula. Oh, wait! The momentum p is m*v. In magnetic fields, the momentum can be related to the magnetic field and charge. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. The magnetic force is F = q(v × B). Since v and B are perpendicular, F = qvB. And this force provides the centripetal acceleration, so F = m*v²/r. So combining these:

q v B = m v² / r → m = (q B r) / v.

But again, without r, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is implying that the magnetic force is the only force acting, so the particle moves in a circle. But without knowing the radius or any time period, I can't find m.

Wait, perhaps the question is missing some information, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the relation where the radius is expressed in terms of m, but that still leaves m in the equation.

Wait, maybe I should think about the units. Let me plug in the numbers and see if I can get an expression.

Given: q = 1.6e-19 C, v = 1e4 m/s, B = 4.9e-5 T.

We have m = (q B r) / v.

But without r, can't compute. So perhaps the question is expecting me to express m in terms of other variables, but I don't see how.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the period of the circular motion. The period T is 2πr/v.

But again, without knowing T or r, I can't find m.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem expects me to use a different formula, perhaps involving the relation between charge, mass, velocity, and magnetic field without needing the radius.

Wait, another thought: The particle's path is circular, so the radius is determined by its momentum. The momentum p = m v. So p = q B r → r = p/(q B). But p is m v, so r = (m v)/(q B). 

Wait, but substituting this back into the equation for F, which is qvB = m v² / r → substituting r from here gives:

qvB = m v² / (m v/(q B)) → simplifies to qvB = (m v² * q B) / (m v) ) → qvB = qv B → which is just an identity, so it doesn't help find m.

Hmm. So maybe I need to think differently. Since the problem gives all the variables except m and r, perhaps I'm supposed to find m without knowing r, which suggests that r cancels out.

Wait, another approach. Let me rearrange the equation to solve for m.

From F = qvB = m v² / r → m = (q B r) / v.

But without r, I can't compute m. Unless I can express r in terms of known variables.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the particle travels in a circular path with radius determined by some other condition, but no, nothing else is given.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me think if I'm missing any fundamental concepts.

Wait, maybe the problem is testing the relation between charge, mass, velocity, and magnetic field in a different way. Let me think about the units again.

The units of B are teslas. And 1 tesla equals 1 kg/(C·s). So B has units of kg/(C·s).

So if I multiply B by q (C) and v (m/s), I get (kg/(C·s)) * C * (m/s) )= kg·m/s².

Which is force. So F = qvB has units of force.

But again, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to express mass as m = (q B)/(v) * r, but without r, I can't. So maybe the problem expects me to find the mass without knowing r, which doesn't seem possible unless there's a standard value or assumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is misprinted. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another thought: Since the particle is moving in the same horizontal plane, perhaps the vertical component of the magnetic force is zero, but that doesn't make sense because the force is perpendicular to velocity and B field, so it's vertical.

Wait, maybe the problem is implying that the particle is moving in such a way that the magnetic force is the only force acting on it, hence providing the centripetal force. So the equation is correct, but without knowing r, I can't find m.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options and see which units make sense. The options are:

A: 1e-18 kg (that's like the mass of a small grain of dust)

B: 2e-22 kg

C:8e-21

D:7.5e-20

E:6.4e-20

F:4.9e-5 kg (that's like a small insect)

G:5e-23

H:9.8 (units are m/s², probably wrong)

I:1.6e-19 kg

J:3.2e-19 kg

Wait, the charge is about 1.6e-19 C, and velocity is 1e4 m/s, B is 4.9e-5 T.

Let me try plugging in the values.

Suppose mass m is the unknown.

From the equation:

m = (q B r) / v.

But again, no r. So perhaps I'm supposed to find r in terms of m, but that's circular.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the relation for the radius and then find m from that. But without additional info, how?

Wait, another idea: Maybe the problem is considering that the particle is moving in a circle where the radius is such that the mass cancels out. But I'm not seeing how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the cyclotron frequency, which is f = (qB)/(2πm). But without knowing f, I can't find m.

Wait, unless the problem assumes that the period is related to something else, but no, nothing's given.

Wait, maybe I should make an assumption. Let's say that the radius is 1 meter. Then, m = (1.6e-19 C * 4.9e-5 T * 1 m) / 1e4 m/s.

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: 1.6e-19 *4.9e-5 = 7.84e-24.

Divide by 1e4 → 7.84e-28 kg. That's way smaller than any of the options. So maybe that's not the approach.

Alternatively, if the radius is, say, 1e4 meters (10 km), then m would be (1.6e-19 *4.9e-5 *1e4) /1e4 → (7.84e-20) /1e4 → 7.84e-24 kg. Still way too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of the equation again.

From F = qvB = mv²/r → rearrange to m = (qvB * r) / v² = (qB r)/v.

But without r, I can't find m. So perhaps the question expects to use another formula where r cancels out.

Wait, another approach: The kinetic energy (KE) of
