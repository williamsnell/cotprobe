Okay, so I have this Python question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again: Let x = 8. What is x >> 1 in Python 3? The options are A through J, each with different numbers.

Hmm, I remember that in programming, the >> operator is a bitwise operator. It's called the right shift operator. Right, so shifting bits to the right. But wait, how does that work exactly?

So when you right shift a number, each bit moves to the right by the specified amount. For example, if I have a binary number, say 1000, and I right shift by 1, it becomes 0100, which is 4. Wait, but wait, what about the sign bit? Oh right, but in Python, integers can be of arbitrary length, and I think for positive numbers, the sign bit isn't an issue because Python uses two's complement but doesn't have fixed-size integers like some other languages.

So x is 8. Let me write that in binary. 8 in binary is 1000. So if I do x >> 1, that's shifting right by 1 bit. So each bit moves to the right by one position. Let's see: shifting 1000 right by one would give 0100, which is 4 in decimal.

Wait, but let me think again. Does the right shift operator in Python do division by 2? Because shifting right by one is equivalent to dividing by 2 and taking the floor. But for positive numbers, it's straightforward. So 8 divided by 2 is 4, so x >>1 should be 4.

Looking at the options, option E is 4. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it: each right shift by 1 is the same as integer division by 2. So 8 >>1 is 8//2 =4. Yep, that makes sense.

I don't think I'm making a mistake here. So the correct answer is E.

To determine the value of `x >> 1` when `x = 8` in Python 3, we need to understand the behavior of the right shift operator (`>>`). The right shift operator moves the bits of a number to the right by the specified number of positions. For positive integers, this is equivalent to performing integer division by 2 for each shift.

- The binary representation of `8` is `1000`.
- Shifting `1000` right by 1 bit results in `0100`, which is `4` in decimal.
- This is consistent with the mathematical operation `8 // 2`, which also equals `4`.

Thus, the result of `x >> 1` is `4`.

The correct answer is **E: 4**.

Answer: E
