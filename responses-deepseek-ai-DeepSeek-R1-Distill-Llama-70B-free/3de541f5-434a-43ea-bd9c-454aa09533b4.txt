Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about group theory, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through. Let's break it down step by step.

The question presents two statements:

Statement 1: Every group of order p² where p is prime is Abelian.
Statement 2: For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.

And then there are options from A to J about the truth of these statements.

Alright, let's tackle Statement 1 first. So, the question is whether every group of order p squared is Abelian. I remember that a group of order p, where p is prime, is cyclic and hence Abelian. But what about p squared?

I think about the possible groups of order p². I remember that for abelian groups, the fundamental theorem says that every finite abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. So for p², the abelian groups would be the cyclic group of order p² and the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p (which is the same as the Klein four-group when p=2). But wait, what about non-abelian groups of order p²?

Wait, can a group of order p² be non-abelian? Let me recall. For a group to be non-abelian, it must have elements that don't commute. The order is p squared; p is prime. I think that all groups of order p² are actually abelian. Because if a group has order p squared, its center must be nontrivial. In fact, for a group of order p squared, the center is the entire group, making it abelian. Or wait, is that true?

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some concepts. Let me think again. The center of a group G, Z(G), is a subgroup. If G has order p², then by the class equation, the center must have order p or p². If the center had order p, then the quotient group G/Z(G) would have order p, which is cyclic. But if G/Z(G) is cyclic, then G is abelian. Wait, that would mean that if G has a center of order p, then G is abelian. So the only possibility is that G is abelian, because if the center were trivial, the class equation would require that the group has order dividing p(p−1), which isn't possible since p squared is larger than that for primes p>2. So for p=2, order 4, the Klein four-group is abelian, but can there be a non-abelian group of order p squared?

Wait, but when p=2, the dihedral group D4 has order 8, which is 2 cubed. So no, for order p squared, like 4, all groups are abelian. So statement 1 must be true. So Statement 1 is true.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. So for any prime p, a group of order p² must be abelian. Because if the group were non-abelian, then its center would be trivial. But for a group of order p², the class equation would have to have each conjugacy class size dividing p², and being a power of p. Since p is prime, the possible sizes are 1 and p. But the number of conjugacy classes of size 1 would have to be congruent to the group order modulo p. Let me think: the class equation is |G|=|Z(G)| + [G:C_G(g)] for each class.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that groups of order p² are abelian. Because any group of order p² is either the cyclic group of order p² or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p. Both of these are abelian. So yes, Statement 1 is true. So Statement 1 is true for any prime p.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of G is normal if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.

Hmm, Sylow theorems. I remember that Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other if there are multiple ones. So if a Sylow p-subgroup is unique, then it's normal. Because if it's the only one, it must be normal, since otherwise you can't conjugate it to another subgroup. So the 'only if' direction is clear: if it's normal, then it's unique. Because if it's normal, then all Sylow p-subgroups are in the same conjugacy class, so there can only be one.

Wait, no, Sylow's theorems say that all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, and if there's only one, it's normal. But the converse is, if a Sylow p-subgroup is normal, then it's the only one. So the statement is saying "if and only if", meaning both directions hold. So yes, that's correct. Because if a Sylow p-subgroup is normal, then it's the only Sylow p-subgroup. Conversely, if it's the only one, it's normal.

So Statement 2 is true in general, regardless of the prime p.

Wait, but wait, is there any case where this might not hold? Let me think. Suppose G has a normal Sylow p-subgroup. Then by Sylow's theorems, it's the only one. So yes, the statement holds for any prime p. So Statement 2 is always true.

So now, looking at the options:

Option E: Both true. So if both statements are true, the answer would be E. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, wait, the first statement: does it hold for all primes? Wait, no, wait, when p=2, the Klein four-group is abelian, and the cyclic group of order 4 is abelian. But what about p=2, is every group of order 4 abelian? Yes, because the quaternion group has order 8, which is 2 cubed, so no, groups of order 4 are abelian. So Statement 1 is true for all primes p. So Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true. So the correct option would be E: True, True.

Wait, but the options don't have E as the first choice. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option E says both statements are true, so E would be correct.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure about Statement 1. So, I thought that all groups of order p² are abelian. But does that hold for any prime p? For example, take p=3, so order 9. Are all groups of order 9 abelian? Yes. Because the only groups of order 9 are the cyclic group of order 9 and the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3, which is abelian. So yes, all groups of order p² are abelian.

So Statement 1 is true for all primes p, and Statement 2 is true for all primes p. Therefore, the correct answer is E: True, True.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A to J. Let me read the options as given.

Option E: Both statements are true.

So the correct answer would be E.

Statement 1: Every group of order \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is prime, is Abelian.  
This is true. For any prime \( p \), a group of order \( p^2 \) must be Abelian. The possible groups of order \( p^2 \) are the cyclic group of order \( p^2 \) and the direct product of two cyclic groups of order \( p \). Both of these groups are Abelian. Additionally, non-Abelian groups of order \( p^2 \) do not exist because the center of such a group must be nontrivial, and if the center has order \( p \), the quotient group \( G/Z(G) \) would be cyclic, implying \( G \) is Abelian. Thus, Statement 1 is true for all primes \( p \).

Statement 2: For a fixed prime \( p \), a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup of a group \( G \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \) if and only if it is the only Sylow \( p \)-subgroup of \( G \).  
This is also true. By Sylow's theorems, if a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup is unique, it is normal. Conversely, if a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup is normal, it must be the only one. This holds for any prime \( p \), as Sylow's theorems guarantee that all Sylow \( p \)-subgroups are conjugate, and uniqueness implies normality. Thus, Statement 2 is true for all primes \( p \).

Since both statements are true for all primes \( p \), the correct answer is:

**E: True, True.**
