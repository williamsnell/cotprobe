Okay, so Mrs. McCoy wants to buy beer, wine, and soda with $17 to maximize her utility. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that to maximize utility, she should allocate her money where she gets the highest marginal utility per dollar spent. So I need to calculate the marginal utility per dollar for each product.

First, let's list out the prices. Soda is $1 per large bottle. Beer is $2 for a six-pack, which means each six-pack costs $2. Wine is $4 per liter. So the prices are $1, $2, and $4 respectively.

Now, I need to look at the marginal utility for each unit of these products. The table gives the MU for each unit consumed. Let me write down the MUs and calculate the utility per dollar for each possible unit.

Starting with soda. The MUs are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 for the first through sixth units. Since each soda costs $1, the utility per dollar for each unit is the same as the MU because it's $1 per unit.

For beer, the MU starts at 50 for the first six-pack, then 40, 30, 20, 16, 12. Each six-pack is $2, so the utility per dollar is MU divided by 2. So first beer: 50/2=25 utils/$, second:40/2=20, third:15, fourth:10, fifth:8, sixth:6.

Wine's MUs are 60,40,32,24,20,16. Each liter is $4, so the utility per dollar is MU divided by 4. So first wine:60/4=15, second:10, third:8, fourth:6, fifth:5, sixth:4.

Now, I'll list the marginal utilities per dollar in order from highest to lowest to see the optimal purchasing order.

Let me list all possible units and their utility per dollar:

Soda:
1st:10
2nd:9
3rd:8
4th:7
5th:6
6th:5

Beer:
1st:25
2nd:20
3rd:15
4th:10
5th:8
6th:6

Wine:
1st:15
2nd:10
3rd:8
4th:6
5th:5
6th:4

Now, let's sort all these in descending order by utility per dollar:

1. Beer 1st:25
2. Soda 1st:10
3. Beer 2nd:20
4. Soda 2nd:9
5. Wine 1st:15
6. Beer 3rd:15
7. Soda 3rd:8
8. Wine 2nd:10
9. Beer 4th:10
10. Soda 4th:7
11. Wine 3rd:8
12. Beer 5th:8
13. Soda 5th:6
14. Wine 4th:6
15. Beer 6th:6
16. Soda 6th:5
17. Wine 5th:5
18. Wine 6th:4

Wait, did I get that right? Let me recheck. Oh, wait, I think I messed up the order. Let me make a list that includes all possible units with their utility per dollar, then sort them correctly.

Wait another approach: make a list of all possible units, each with their utility per dollar, then pick from highest to lowest until the budget is spent.

Let me try that.

List of units and their utility per dollar:

Beer:
1st:25
2nd:20
3rd:15
4th:10
5th:8
6th:6

Soda:
1st:10
2nd:9
3rd:8
4th:7
5th:6
6th:5

Wine:
1st:15
2nd:10
3rd:8
4th:6
5th:5
6th:4

Now, I'll sort all these in descending order:

1. Beer 1st:25
2. Beer 2nd:20
3. Beer 3rd:15
4. Wine 1st:15
5. Soda 1st:10
6. Beer 4th:10
7. Soda 2nd:9
8. Wine 2nd:10
Wait, no, wait. Let me list all and sort correctly.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to create a combined list:

25 (beer1), 20 (beer2), 15 (beer3), 15 (wine1), 10 (soda1), 10 (beer4), 10 (wine2), 9 (soda2), 8 (beer5), 8 (soda3), 8 (wine3), 7 (soda4), 6 (beer6), 6 (soda5), 6 (wine4), 5 (soda6), 5 (wine5), 4 (wine6).

Wait, let me make sure:

Beer1:25
Beer2:20
Beer3:15
Wine1:15
Soda1:10
Beer4:10
Wine2:10
Soda2:9
Beer5:8
Soda3:8
Wine3:8
Soda4:7
Beer6:6
Soda5:6
Wine4:6
Soda6:5
Wine5:5
Wine6:4

Wait, but when I list them, the order should be from highest to lowest. So the correct order would be:

25 (beer1)
20 (beer2)
15 (beer3)
15 (wine1)
10 (soda1)
10 (beer4)
10 (wine2)
9 (soda2)
8 (beer5)
8 (soda3)
8 (wine3)
7 (soda4)
6 (beer6)
6 (soda5)
6 (wine4)
5 (soda6)
5 (wine5)
4 (wine6)

Now, with $17, she needs to pick each unit in this order until she can't afford more.

Let's proceed step by step, adding each next highest utility per dollar until the total cost reaches 17.

Start with beer1: cost is $2. So spent $2, remaining $15. Total utility +=25.

Next, beer2: $2, total spent $4, remaining $13. Utility +=20.

Next, beer3: $2, spent $6, remaining $11. Utility +=15.

Next, wine1: $4, spent $10, remaining $7. Utility +=15.

Next, soda1: $1, spent $11, remaining $6. Utility +=10.

Next, beer4: $2, spent $13, remaining $4. Utility +=10.

Next, wine2: $4, but she only has $4 left. So she can buy this. Spent $17, done. Utility +=10.

Wait, but let's check how many units each product is.

Beer: 4 units (1,2,3,4) → 4 six-packs.

Wine: 2 units (1,2) → 2 liters.

Soda: 1 unit.

Wait, but that would be 4 beers, 2 wines, 1 soda. Let me check the cost: 4*2=8, 2*4=8, 1*1=1. Total 8+8+1=17. That matches.

So the combination is 4 six-packs of beer, 2 liters of wine, and 1 soda.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's look at the options:

Option J is 1 soda, 4 beers, 2 wines. Yes.

Wait, but let me check what each option says. Let's go through the options.

Option J: 1 soda, 4 six-packs beer, 2 liters wine. That's exactly what I have.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check because maybe I made a mistake in the order.

Wait, after buying beer1, beer2, beer3, wine1, soda1, beer4, wine2. Let me see if any other combination with higher utility is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps in the order, after buying beer3 and wine1, perhaps soda1 is next, which is $1, then beer4 is $2, then wine2 is $4. So total is 2+2+2+4+1+2+4=17.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any higher utility options. For example, after buying beer3 (15), the next options are wine1 (15) and soda1 (10). So yes, wine1 is next.

Then soda1 is 10, which is lower than beer4's 10. So the next step is to compare which to buy next between soda1 and beer4. Since both have utility per dollar 10, but soda1 is $1, beer4 is $2. So perhaps she can buy soda1 first because it's cheaper, allowing more purchases elsewhere.

Wait, but in the sorted list, soda1 is 10, same as beer4's 10. So perhaps she can buy both soda1 and beer4 at the same time. But since she's limited by money, she should buy the cheaper one first to maximize the number of units she can buy.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Maybe using a table to track possible expenditures.

Alternative approach: create a list of all possible next units sorted by utility per dollar, and pick the highest each time until the budget is exhausted.

Let me try that.

Budget: $17.

Initialize all counts to zero.

Step 1: Possible next units:

Beer1: 25 utils/$ → $2.

Choose beer1. Spent $2. Beer=1. Remaining $15.

Step 2: Next options:

Beer2:20, Beer1 is already bought. So next is beer2:20.

Buy beer2. Spent $4. Beer=2. Remaining $13.

Step3: Next options.

Beer3:15, wine1:15.

Which one to choose? Both have the same utility per dollar. But which one is cheaper? Wine1 costs $4, Beer3 costs $2. So she can buy Beer3 first because it's cheaper, allowing her to have more money left for other options.

So buy beer3. Spent $6. Beer=3. Remaining $11.

Step4: Next options.

Now, the next highest is wine1:15 utils/$, then soda1:10, beer4:10, wine2:10.

She can choose wine1 next. Buy wine1. Spent $10. Wine=1. Remaining $7.

Step5: Next options.

Now, soda1:10, beer4:10, wine2:10.

Again, same utility per dollar. Choose the cheapest first, which is soda1 ($1).

Buy soda1. Spent $11. Soda=1. Remaining $6.

Step6: Next options.

Now, beer4:10, wine2:10, soda2:9.

Buy beer4: costs $2. Spent $13. Beer=4. Remaining $4.

Step7: Next options.

Now, wine2:10, soda2:9, soda3:8, etc.

Wine2 costs $4. She has $4 left, so she can buy wine2.

Buy wine2. Spent $17. Wine=2. Done.

So the final purchases: 4 beers, 2 wines, 1 soda. That's option J.

Wait, but let me check if any other combination could yield higher utility. For example, what if she buys less beer and more wine or soda elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps buying an additional soda instead of wine2. Let's see.

At step7, she has $4 left. The options are wine2 (10 utils, $4) or soda2 (9 utils, $1) and soda3 (8, $1), etc.

If she buys soda2, she spends $1, remaining $3. Then she can buy soda3 for $1 (remaining $2), and soda4 for $1 (remaining $1), but then she can't buy anything else. Let's calculate the utility from that path.

Alternative approach after step6:

At step6, she has $4 left. Instead of buying wine2 for $4 (utility 10), she could buy soda2 ($1, utility9), soda3 ($1, utility8), soda4 ($1, utility7), and have $1 left which can't buy anything else since the next soda is soda5 which is $1 but only adds utility6, but she can't afford it because she only has $1 left after buying soda4.

So the utility from this path would be 9+8+7=24, plus the previous utility up to step6.

But if she buys wine2, she gets utility10. So 10 vs 24? Wait, no, because she can buy three sodas with the remaining $3: soda2 (9), soda3 (8), soda4 (7), totaling 24 utils, but that's more than the 10 from wine2. Hmm, so maybe that's a better option.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me recalculate.

At step6, she's spent $13, has $4 left. Let's see what she can buy:

Option A: Buy wine2 for $4 → utility10.

Option B: Buy soda2 ($1, utility9), soda3 ($1, utility8), soda4 ($1, utility7). Spent $3, remaining $1, which can't buy anything else. Total utility from this is 9+8+7=24.

So Option B gives higher utility (24) than Option A (10). So she should choose Option B.

Wait, so this changes the optimal choice. So let me recalculate.

So after step6, she has $4. She can buy soda2, soda3, soda4, which use up $3, leaving $1 unused.

So her total would be:

Beer:4, Wine:1, Soda:4 (soda1 to soda4).

Wait, no, soda1 was already bought in step5, so soda2,3,4 would be additional. So total soda would be 4.

Wait, but let me recount the steps.

Step1: beer1 → $2, total spent $2, beer=1.

Step2: beer2 → $4, beer=2.

Step3: beer3 → $6, beer=3.

Step4: wine1 → $10, wine=1.

Step5: soda1 → $11, soda=1.

Step6: beer4 → $13, beer=4.

Now, remaining $4. Instead of buying wine2, she buys soda2,3,4, which cost $3, leaving $1.

So her total would be:

Beer:4, wine:1, soda:4.

But wait, is that possible within the budget? Let's calculate the cost.

4 beers:4*$2=8

1 wine: $4

4 sodas:4*$1=4

Total:8+4+4=16, which is under $17. So she has $1 left, which she can't spend on anything because the next soda would cost $1, but she already bought 4. The next soda is soda5, which is 6 utils. Alternatively, is there any other product she can buy with $1? No, because beer is $2 and wine is $4. So she can't use the last $1.

So the total utility would be sum of all the MUs.

Let me calculate the total utility for this scenario.

Beer: first four units:50+40+30+20=140.

Wine: first unit:60.

Soda: first four units:10+9+8+7=34.

Total utility:140+60+34=234.

But wait, earlier when she bought wine2, the total utility would be:

Beer4:50+40+30+20=140.

Wine2:60+40=100.

Soda1:10.

Total:140+100+10=250.

Wait, that's higher. But in that case, she spent $2*4 (beer) + $4*2 (wine) + $1*1 (soda) = 8+8+1=17.

Wait, but in that case, soda is only 1 unit, whereas in the other scenario she has 4 sodas but less wine.

Wait, so 250 vs 234. So 250 is higher. So she should buy wine2 instead.

Wait, but earlier I thought buying sodas would give higher utility, but now the numbers show that wine2 gives higher total utility.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier in evaluating which option gives higher utility.

Wait, let me recalculate:

If she buys wine2, she gets 10 utils, but if she buys three sodas, she gets 9+8+7=24 utils. So 24 is higher than 10. But when considering the total utility, including previous purchases, which path gives higher overall utility.

Wait, but when she buys wine2, the total utility from wine is 60+40=100.

When she buys three sodas, the soda utility is 10+9+8+7=34.

So, 100 (wine) vs 34 (soda). But she can't have both because money is limited. She has to choose between spending $4 on wine2 or $3 on three sodas and leave $1.

So in the first case, she spends $4 on wine2: total utility from wine is 100, and soda is 10.

In the second case, she spends $3 on sodas 2,3,4: soda utility is 34, wine remains at 60.

So, 100+10=110 vs 34+60=94. So 110 is higher. So buying wine2 gives higher total utility.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So the initial approach was correct. So the optimal is to buy 4 beers, 2 wines, and 1 soda, which is option J.

Wait, but let me check the options again to see if any other option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option J: 1 soda, 4 beers, 2 wines.

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So the correct answer should be option J.
</think>

To maximize her utility with a budget of $17, Mrs. McCoy should allocate her spending based on the highest marginal utility per dollar for each beverage. The prices and marginal utilities (MU) for each beverage are as follows:

- **Soda**: $1 per bottle, MU: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5  
-
