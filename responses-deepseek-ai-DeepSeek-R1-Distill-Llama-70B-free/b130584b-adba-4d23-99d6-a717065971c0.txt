Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about legal processes, specifically regarding the termination of a parent's custody rights and welfare benefits. Hmm, I remember that in the U.S., certain governmental actions that deprive someone of a protected interest require due process under the law. 

The question is asking what type of process both of these terminations require. Let me break it down. 

First, termination of custody rights. I think that's a pretty serious thing because it involves a parent's right to their child, which is a fundamental right. So, the process must be more rigorous. I remember something about a hearing being required. Like, before the government can take away custody, they have to give the parent notice and an opportunity to be heard. So that points towards some kind of prior notice and a hearing.

Then, termination of welfare benefits. Welfare is a government benefit, so it's an entitlement. I think in cases where the government wants to stop benefits, they have to provide due process as well. The classic case here is probably Goldberg v. Kelly, where the Supreme Court ruled that before terminating welfare benefits, the state must provide timely and adequate notice, and an effective opportunity for the recipient to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally. So that sounds like a prior notice and some kind of hearing or opportunity to respond.

Wait, but in the case of welfare benefits, I think it's a bit different. Maybe it's not a full evidentiary hearing beforehand. Or is it? Goldberg v. Kelly required that before termination, the recipient gets notice and a chance to respond, but perhaps not a full-blown trial. Hmm, maybe it's more like a pre-termination hearing.

Wait, but the question is about what both processes require. So, I'm looking for a common element. 

Looking at the options, option C says prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing. Option H says prior notice and opportunity to respond. Option B says prior screening, notice, and opportunity to respond. Option A is prior screening by a neutral fact-finder. 

Wait, for custody termination, I think the process is more involved. It usually starts with a petition, maybe a preliminary hearing, and then a full trial where evidence is presented. So that would involve prior notice and an evidentiary hearing. 

For welfare benefits, under Goldberg, it's prior notice and an opportunity to respond, which might be a hearing but not necessarily as formal as a trial. So perhaps the welfare termination doesn't require a full evidentiary hearing beforehand but does require notice and a chance to respond. 

Wait, but the question is about what both require. So, if one requires a prior evidentiary hearing and the other requires prior notice and a chance to respond, the commonality is prior notice and some kind of opportunity to respond. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing. So, does welfare termination require an evidentiary hearing? Or just an opportunity to respond, which could be less formal?

I think in the case of welfare, the pre-termination hearing isn't a full evidentiary trial with all the trappings, but it's still a hearing where the recipient can present evidence. So perhaps the welfare termination requires a prior hearing, but maybe not as extensive as a trial. So both processes require prior notice and some form of hearing. 

Wait, but the question is about the type of process. So, for both, prior notice and an opportunity to respond would be the key. So looking at the options, H is prior notice and opportunity to respond. But wait, termination of custody rights would likely require a more formal process, perhaps an evidentiary hearing. So which options cover that?

Alternatively, both might require prior notice and an evidentiary hearing. So option C says prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing. Does welfare termination require that? Because Goldberg v. Kelly said that welfare recipients are entitled to a hearing, but I'm not sure if that's the same as an evidentiary hearing with the presentation of evidence. Maybe in the case of welfare, it's a less formal proceeding but still a hearing where evidence can be presented. 

So maybe both processes require prior notice and a prior evidentiary hearing. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Custody termination definitely requires a hearing with evidence. Welfare termination, according to Goldberg, requires timely and adequate notice and an effective opportunity to defend, which includes presenting evidence. So in both cases, it's prior notice and a hearing where evidence is presented. So that would be a prior evidentiary hearing. Therefore, the answer should be option C.

Wait, but another point: in some cases, like welfare, maybe it's just a hearing without all the formalities of an evidentiary trial. But the key is that both require some form of prior notice and some kind of hearing. So in the options, option C says prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing, which would apply to both. Option H is prior notice and opportunity to respond, which is more general. 

Alternatively, looking for the minimum that both require. So perhaps both require prior notice and an opportunity to respond, which would include presenting evidence, but maybe not a full blown evidentiary hearing with cross-examination. So maybe option H is the correct answer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. 

In the case of In re Gault (1967), the Supreme Court held that in juvenile delinquency proceedings, which can result in loss of liberty, the child is entitled to due process, including notice, opportunity to confront witnesses, and an attorney. But that's about liberty, not custody.

For custody termination, which is a parental right, the process is similar to a trial with evidence presented. So prior notice and an evidentiary hearing are required.

For welfare termination, the process is less formal but still requires prior notice and a hearing. So in both cases, prior notice is necessary, and an opportunity to respond, which in the case of custody would be a more formal hearing with evidence, and in welfare, perhaps a less formal one but still an opportunity to present evidence.

So the common elements are prior notice and an opportunity to respond, which includes presenting evidence. So looking at the options, option C says prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing. Option H is prior notice and opportunity to respond.

Wait, the question asks what both processes require. So if welfare requires prior notice and a hearing (which includes an opportunity to respond), and custody requires prior notice and an evidentiary hearing, then the commonality is prior notice and an opportunity to respond. Because welfare doesn't necessarily require a full evidentiary hearing, just an opportunity to respond, which could be less formal. So the answer would be option H: prior notice and opportunity to respond.

Alternatively, maybe both require prior notice and an evidentiary hearing, making option C correct. But I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, another angle: the due process clause requires that when the government seeks to deprive someone of a protected interest, the person must be given notice and, if requested, a hearing. So in both cases, the person is entitled to prior notice and a hearing. Whether the hearing is evidentiary might depend on the context.

But for termination of parental rights, the process is more stringent, requiring a higher standard of proof and a more formal hearing. Welfare termination requires notice and an opportunity to be heard, but perhaps not as formal.

So the common process would be prior notice and an opportunity to respond (option H). Because welfare termination doesn't require a full evidentiary hearing beforehand, but custody does. So the overlapping requirement is prior notice and opportunity to respond.

Wait, but if both require a prior hearing with evidence, then option C would be correct. Hmm, maybe I should think about the specific requirements.

In the case of welfare benefits, the pre-termination hearing is required, but it's not necessarily an evidentiary hearing in the same way as a trial. It's more of an opportunity to be heard, perhaps in a more informal setting. So maybe it's just prior notice and an opportunity to respond, not necessarily a full evidentiary hearing.

So, if that's the case, then the common element is prior notice and opportunity to respond, which is option H.

But wait, the question says both require what type of process. So maybe the answer is option C because both require prior notice and a hearing, which in both cases would include the presentation of evidence, making it an evidentiary hearing. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, looking for the correct answer, I think the correct process required for both is prior notice and an opportunity to respond, which includes a hearing where evidence can be presented. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought welfare termination required a pre-termination hearing with the opportunity to present evidence, which would make it an evidentiary hearing. So perhaps both do require prior notice and an evidentiary hearing, making option C correct.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but I think the key is that both require prior notice and a hearing where evidence can be presented. So the answer would be option C: prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing.

The question asks what type of process is required for both the termination of a parent's custody rights and the termination of welfare benefits. To answer this, it is important to analyze the due process requirements for each scenario:

1. **Termination of Custody Rights**: This involves a fundamental right—the parent's relationship with their child. As such, the process is rigorous and requires prior notice and an evidentiary hearing where evidence can be presented. This ensures that the parent has a full opportunity to defend their rights.

2. **Termination of Welfare Benefits**: While welfare benefits are an entitlement, the process is less formal than custody termination. However, due process still requires prior notice and an opportunity to respond, which includes a hearing where the recipient can present evidence. This was established in *Goldberg v. Kelly*, which mandated a pre-termination hearing.

The key commonality between the two processes is the requirement of prior notice and an opportunity to respond, which includes presenting evidence. While custody termination involves a more formal evidentiary hearing, welfare termination requires a less formal but still meaningful opportunity to be heard. Therefore, the process that satisfies both scenarios is **prior notice and opportunity to respond**.
