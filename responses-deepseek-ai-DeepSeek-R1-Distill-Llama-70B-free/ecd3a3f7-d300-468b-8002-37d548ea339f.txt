Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the psychological impact of physical deviation in adolescents. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is asking which option correctly describes the effect, so I need to think about what physical deviation might mean and how it affects teens.

Physical deviation probably refers to having a body that's different from what's considered normal or average. Like, maybe being much taller, shorter, heavier, or having some other physical difference. Adolescents are in a stage where they're really focused on fitting in with their peers, right? So any deviation might make them stand out, which could have psychological effects.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no impact. That doesn't seem right. I remember reading that body image issues are common in teens, so physical differences likely do have an impact.

Option B talks about superior athletic performance. Well, maybe if someone is taller or stronger, but not all physical deviations lead to that. Plus, the question is about psychological impact, not physical abilities.

Option C mentions heightened physical well-being. I'm not sure. If someone feels different, maybe they don't feel as well, especially if they're self-conscious.

Option D says it diminishes peer relationships. That's possible. If a teen is different, they might feel isolated. But does it diminish the importance of peer relationships, or does it affect their ability to form them? I'm not certain.

Option E is excitement. That seems off. Being different might cause anxiety, not excitement, unless it's a positive deviation like being exceptionally good-looking, but that's not always the case.

Option F is stress and anxiety. Yeah, that makes sense. Teens often face social pressure and might feel stressed if they don't conform physically. I think this is a strong candidate.

Option G is enhanced social acceptance. Maybe if the deviation is seen positively, but usually, deviations can lead to social issues like bullying or feeling excluded, so I don't think this is right.

Option H links to academic performance. I don't see a direct connection. Physical deviation might distract or cause stress, affecting school, but it's not necessarily a given, and the question is about psychological impact, not academic.

Option I says increased creativity. I'm not sure about that. Maybe some people channel their differences into creative outlets, but it's not a universal effect.

Option J is immediate popularity. That seems unlikely. Physical differences might make someone a target rather than popular.

So, putting it all together, the most plausible answer is F: Physical deviation can cause stress and anxiety in adolescents. That aligns with what I know about adolescent psychology and the challenges of body image.

F: Physical deviation can cause stress and anxiety in adolescents.
