Okay, so I've got this economics question here about reserve ratios and excess reserves. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me remember what I learned in class.

Alright, the question says that $1000 is deposited into a checking account, and as a result, the excess reserves increase by $700. I need to find the reserve ratio. Wait, what's the reserve ratio again? Oh right, it's the ratio of reserves to total deposits that a bank is required to hold. So it's the percentage of deposits that banks must keep in reserves rather than lend out.

So, the bank receives a new deposit of $1000. I think when a bank gets a deposit, it can choose to hold some as reserves and lend out the rest. But wait, the question says that excess reserves increase by $700. Excess reserves are the reserves the bank holds beyond what is required by the central bank.

Let me break it down. The total deposit is $1000. The required reserves would be based on the reserve ratio (let's call it r) multiplied by the deposit. So required reserves = r * 1000.

Now, the excess reserves are the total reserves minus the required reserves. But wait, in this case, the bank's total reserves after the deposit would be whatever they had before plus the new reserves from the deposit. Oh wait, no, the question is about the change in excess reserves when the deposit is made. So when the bank gets $1000, they have to set aside r*1000 as required reserves. The rest, which is (1 - r)*1000, can be used as excess reserves or loans.

Wait, actually, in this scenario, the $1000 is a new deposit, so the bank's reserves increase by the amount they decide to keep as reserves. But the question states that excess reserves increase by $700. So the increase in excess reserves is equal to the amount they didn't have to set aside as required reserves.

So the total new reserves from the deposit would be the required part plus the excess part. Wait no, the required reserves are the minimum they must hold. So when the bank receives $1000, they must hold r*1000 as required reserves. The rest, which is $1000*(1 - r), is what they can do with as they pleaseâ€”like lending or keeping as excess.

But according to the question, the excess reserves increased by $700. So the excess reserves added would be the part they choose to keep beyond the required. So that $700 must be the amount they kept as excess after setting aside the required.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the increase. The required reserves increase by r*1000, and the excess reserves increase by whatever is left. Or perhaps the $700 is the excess, so the required is 1000 - 700 = 300. So the required reserve is $300, which is r * 1000. Therefore, r = 300 / 1000 = 0.3, which is 30%.

Wait, but that would make the reserve ratio 30%, which is option F. But let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the increase in excess reserves is equal to the deposit minus the required reserves. So, Excess Reserves increase = Deposit - Required Reserves.

So, $700 = $1000 - (r * $1000). That would give r*1000 = $300, so again r=0.3, 30%.

But wait, let me think differently. When a bank receives a deposit, the total reserves increase by the amount of the deposit, right? Because the bank now has more money in its vault or at the central bank. But then, the required reserves increase based on the reserve ratio. The excess reserves are the total reserves minus required reserves.

So, the increase in reserves is $1000. The required reserves would be r multiplied by the new deposits, so r * 1000. The excess reserves increase would be the total added reserves (1000) minus the required part (r*1000). So:

Excess reserves increase = 1000 - (r*1000) = 1000*(1 - r).

But the question says the excess reserves increased by $700. So:

1000*(1 - r) = 700.

Divide both sides by 1000: 1 - r = 0.7.

So, r = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3, which is 30%.

So the reserve ratio is 30%, which is option F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach I've seen before is that the excess reserves are equal to the deposit multiplied by (1 - reserve ratio). So if excess reserves are $700, then 700 = 1000*(1 - r), which again gives r=0.3. So that's consistent.

Therefore, the correct answer should be F: 30%.

To determine the reserve ratio, we start by analyzing the given information:

1. A deposit of $1000 is made into a checking account.
2. Excess reserves increase by $700.

The reserve ratio (\(r\)) is the fraction of deposits that a bank is required to hold as reserves. When a bank receives a deposit, it must set aside \(r \times \text{deposit}\) as required reserves. The remaining amount, \((1 - r) \times \text{deposit}\), can either be lent out or held as excess reserves.

From the question, the increase in excess reserves is $700. This implies:

\[
\text{Excess Reserves} = \text{Deposit} \times (1 - r)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
700 = 1000 \times (1 - r)
\]

Dividing both sides by 1000:

\[
1 - r = 0.7
\]

Solving for \(r\):

\[
r = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3
\]

Thus, the reserve ratio is 30%.

The correct answer is:

**F: 30%.**
