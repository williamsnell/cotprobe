Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about criminal law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a man in his apartment late at night. Someone is buzzing his apartment repeatedly, but he doesn't answer because he's tired. Later, he hears his door being kicked in, and a man with a gun confronts him, demands cash, and then takes the money before fleeing. The police catch the perpetrator a few minutes later.

I need to determine which common law crimes the perpetrator has probably committed. The options are A through J, each listing different combinations.

First, I should recall the elements of the crimes mentioned in the options. Let's list the possible crimes: robbery, burglary, attempted murder, aggravated assault, trespassing, assault, armed robbery.

Starting with robbery. At common law, robbery is the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone's personal property from their person or presence, using force or threat of force, with the intent to permanently deprive. Here, the perpetrator used a gun to threaten the man, took the cash from the safe. So that fits robbery.

Next, burglary. Common law burglary is the unlawful entry into a dwelling of another at nighttime with the intent to commit a felony inside. The man was in his apartment, which is a dwelling. The perpetrator kicked in the door at night, so that's an unlawful entry. The intent upon entry was to commit a felony, which in this case would be robbery or larceny. So yes, burglary is present.

Attempted murder would require specific intent to kill. The perpetrator waved the gun and demanded money, but there's no mention of an intent to kill beyond the threat. Unless the acts indicate an intent to kill, but here it's more about getting money, so I don't think attempted murder applies.

Aggravated assault involves an intentional act that causes another to fear imminent harmful or offensive contact, done in a way that's likely to cause serious injury. Waving a gun could be assault, but I think robbery includes the assault element, so maybe it's not a separate charge.

Trespassing is entering someone's property without permission. Burglary includes trespassing as part of its elements, so it's a lesser charge included in burglary. So trespassing might not be a separate charge here.

Armed robbery is a specific type of robbery where a weapon is used. At common law, robbery can be considered as including the use of a weapon, but some jurisdictions might have it as a separate charge. However, in common law, I think it's just robbery, not necessarily a separate offense like 'armed robbery.'

So looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: Robbery and burglary. This seems to fit because both elements are present.

Option B: Adds attempted murder, which I don't think is there.

Option C: Includes trespassing, which is part of burglary, so probably not a separate charge.

Option D: Aggravated assault and robbery. The assault is part of the robbery, so maybe D is possible, but I think robbery itself includes the assault, so A is better.

Option E: Attempted murder and trespassing. Not applicable here.

Option F: Burglary and attempted murder. No, as discussed.

Option G: Robbery and attempted murder. No.

Option H: Robbery and assault. Assault is part of robbery, so perhaps H is possible, but I think A is better because burglary is a separate crime.

Option I: Trespassing and armed robbery. Again, trespassing is part of burglary, which is a more specific charge.

So the best answer seems to be A: Robbery and burglary.

The correct answer is A: Robbery and burglary.

The scenario involves the perpetrator unlawfully entering the man's apartment (a dwelling) at night with the intent to commit a felony (robbery), fulfilling the elements of burglary. Additionally, the use of a gun to threaten and take cash satisfies the elements of robbery. Other options either include crimes not supported by the facts (like attempted murder) or are redundant (like trespassing being part of burglary).

Answer: A
