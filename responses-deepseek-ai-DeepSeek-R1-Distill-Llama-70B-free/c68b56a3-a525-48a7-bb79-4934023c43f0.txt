Okay, so I have this tax question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that an individual paid taxes 27 months ago but didn't file a tax return for that year. Now, they want to file a claim for a refund of those federal income taxes. The question is asking about the time period within which they must file this claim after the taxes were paid. The options are A through J, each with different time frames.

Hmm, I remember that when it comes to tax refunds and filing claims, the IRS has specific rules about deadlines. I think the general rule is that you have three years from the date you filed your return or two years from when you paid the taxes, whichever is later. But wait, in this case, the person didn't file a tax return at all. So maybe the rules are a bit different.

Wait, so the person paid taxes but didn't file the return. So they might have overpaid and want their money back. Normally, if you file a return, the refund claim must be within 3 years after filing or 2 years after paying, whichever is later. But since they didn't file, maybe the time limit is based on when they paid the taxes.

I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules here. Let me think. If you don't file a return, the IRS can still assess taxes, but there's a statute of limitations. Oh wait, the statute of limitations for the IRS to assess taxes is generally three years after the due date of the return. But that's about when the IRS can come after you, not about when you can claim a refund.

Wait, there's also something about the look-back period for refunds. I remember that if you don't file a return, you have a limited time to claim your refund. I think it's three years from the date the return was due. So if the taxes were paid 27 months ago, that's a little over two years. So the three-year period would still be open.

But wait, the question is about the time after the taxes were paid, not the due date of the return. So if the taxes were paid 27 months ago, the three years from the payment date would be the cutoff. So the claim must be filed within three years after payment.

Looking at the options, option A is three years. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. What if the taxes were paid through withholding? Or if they were estimated taxes? Does that change anything? I think the rule is generally that you have three years from the date of payment or the due date, whichever is later, to claim a refund. But since no return was filed, maybe the clock starts when the payment was made.

Alternatively, I've heard that if you don't file a return, you have three years from the date you should have filed to claim the refund. So if the return was due, say, April 15th, and the payment was made around that time, then the three years would start from that April 15th. But in this question, the payment was 27 months ago, which is less than three years, so the person is still within the time frame.

Wait, but the question is about the time period after the taxes were paid. So if the payment was made 27 months ago, the claim must be made within three years of that payment date. So the answer is three years, which is option A.

I think that's right. So I'll go with option A.

The correct answer is A: Three years. The individual must file the claim for a refund within three years after the taxes were paid.
