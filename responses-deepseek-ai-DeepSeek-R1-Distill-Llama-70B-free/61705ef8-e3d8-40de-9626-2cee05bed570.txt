Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a gas expanding in a gas engine. The gas moves a piston in a cylinder and does 2000 ft-lb of work at a constant pressure of 3000 lb/sq ft. They want to know how much the volume changes. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when gas does work at constant pressure, the formula is work equals pressure multiplied by the change in volume. Oh right, the formula is W = PΔV. So the work done by the gas is equal to the pressure times the change in volume.

Wait, but let me make sure I get the units right. The work is given in foot-pounds (ft-lb), the pressure is in pounds per square foot (lb/sq ft). So when I multiply pressure (lb/sq ft) by volume (cubic feet), the result should be in lb·ft, right? Because (lb/sq ft) * ft³ = lb*(ft³/sq ft) = lb*ft. So the units match, which is good.

So the formula is ΔV = W / P. Because if W = PΔV, then ΔV is W divided by P. 

Given that, let's plug in the numbers. The work done W is 2000 ft-lb, and the pressure P is 3000 lb/sq ft. So ΔV = 2000 / 3000.

Wait, let me compute that. 2000 divided by 3000. Hmm, that's like 2/3. So 2/3 ft³. 

Looking at the options, E is (2/3) ft³. So the answer should be E.

Wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The formula is correct, right? Work at constant pressure is PΔV. So yeah, ΔV is Work divided by Pressure. 

Wait another thing, pressure is force per unit area. Work is force times distance. So pressure (force/area) times area times distance would give force times distance, which is work. Oh, right, because ΔV is area times distance, so PΔV becomes (force/area)* (area * distance) )= force*distance = work. So the formula makes sense.

So yeah, 2000 divided by 3000 is 2/3. So the volume change is 2/3 ft³. So the correct option is E.

To determine the change in volume when gas expanding in a gas engine does 2000 ft-lb of work at a constant pressure of 3000 lb/sq ft, we use the formula for work at constant pressure:

\[
W = P \Delta V
\]

Rearranging for \(\Delta V\):

\[
\Delta V = \frac{W}{P}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\Delta V = \frac{2000 \, \text{ft-lb}}{3000 \, \text{lb/sq ft}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\Delta V = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{ft}^3
\]

Thus, the change in volume is \(\frac{2}{3} \, \text{ft}^3\), which corresponds to option **E**.

Answer: E
