Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Maine's aphorism. Let me think through this step by step.

Maine's statement is that "the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract." I remember that this is from his work "Ancient Law." The question is about how this is often misunderstood.

First, I should break down what Maine meant. Status refers to a person's position in society based on birth, family, or other inherent factors. Contract, on the other hand, refers to relationships based on voluntary agreements and legal obligations. So Maine is talking about a historical shift from societies organized around status to those based on contractual relationships, which he sees as a mark of progress.

Now, the options given are about misunderstandings of this statement. Let me go through each option.

Option A: His concept of status is misrepresented. I'm not sure. Status is a key part of his theory, but the misunderstanding might not be about the concept itself but how it's applied or interpreted.

Option B: It is misinterpreted as a prediction. Hmm. Maine is making a historical observation, not predicting the future. So if people think he's predicting that all societies will move from status to contract, that's a misunderstanding. But I'm not certain if that's the main issue.

Option C: His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems. I don't think that's right. Maine's work was influential in Western legal thought, so this doesn't seem like a common misunderstanding.

Option D: It is incorrectly related to economic progression. Maybe. Economic factors are part of the shift, but I'm not sure if that's the main way people misinterpret it.

Option E: It is taken literally. Taking it literally would mean that all societies have moved completely from status to contract, which isn't the case. Maine was talking about a trend, not a complete shift.

Option F: His use of the word 'progressive' is often misconstrued. Progressive in this context probably means societies that are developing or advancing, but maybe people think it refers to modern progressive politics. That could be a misunderstanding.

Option G: His concept of 'contract' is often misinterpreted. Contract in legal terms is about voluntary agreements, but perhaps people misunderstand it as something else, like economic contracts only.

Wait, the question is about how the aphorism is misunderstood. I think the main issue is that people take it as a prediction about the future rather than a historical observation. Maine was describing the past movement, not saying that all societies must or will follow this path. So if someone reads it as a prediction, that's a misinterpretation.

So looking back at the options, Option B says it's misinterpreted as a prediction. That seems correct. Alternatively, Option E says it's taken literally. Taking it literally might mean they think every society moves entirely from status to contract without any remnants of status, which is also a misunderstanding.

Wait, but the question is about the way it's misunderstood, not just any misunderstanding. I think the more common misinterpretation is seeing it as a prediction about the future rather than a historical analysis.

So, I'm leaning towards Option B.

The correct answer is B: It is misinterpreted as a prediction.

Maine's statement describes a historical shift from societies based on status to those based on contract, not a prediction about future societal development. The misunderstanding arises when people interpret it as forecasting the future rather than analyzing the past.

Answer: B
