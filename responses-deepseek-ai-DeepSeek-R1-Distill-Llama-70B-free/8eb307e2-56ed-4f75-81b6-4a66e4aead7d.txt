Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and charged plates. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see if I can work through it step by step.

The question is about a square metal plate with an edge length of 8.0 cm. The total charge on it is 6.0e-6 C. They want the electric field just off the center of the plate, like 0.50 mm away. Oh right, and the charge is spread uniformly over the two faces. Hmm, I remember that for conducting plates, the charge resides on the surfaces, right? So if it's a metal plate, it's a conductor, so the charges would be on both surfaces.

Wait, wait. So the plate has two faces, and each face has half the total charge. Because the charge is spread over both. So each face would have 3.0e-6 C. Oh, right, because 6e-6 divided by 2 is 3e-6.

Now, the electric field due to an infinite charged sheet is given by E = σ/(2ε₀), where σ is the surface charge density. But wait, is that the case here? Because the plate isn't infinite, but it's square, 8 cm on each side. But if we're looking at a point very close to the center, maybe we can approximate the plate as being infinite in extent. Because near the center, the field from a finite square plate is similar to that of an infinite sheet, especially when the distance is small compared to the plate's size.

The distance given is 0.50 mm, which is 0.5e-3 meters. The plate is 8 cm, which is 0.08 meters on each side. So 0.5 mm is much smaller than 8 cm. So yeah, the approximation should hold. So we can treat it as an infinite sheet for calculating the electric field at that point.

So σ is the surface charge density. Since each face has charge 3e-6 C, the area of each face is length squared. The edge length is 8 cm, which is 0.08 meters. So area A = (0.08)^2 = 0.0064 m². So σ = Q/A = 3e-6 C / 0.0064 m². Let me calculate that.

3e-6 / 0.0064. Let's see, 3 divided by 6.4 is approximately 0.46875. So 0.46875e-6 C/m²? Wait, no, 3e-6 is 3 x 10^-6, divided by 6.4e-3 (since 0.0064 is 6.4e-3). So 3e-6 / 6.4e-3 = (3/6.4) * 1e-3 = approximately 0.46875 * 1e-3 = 4.6875e-4 C/m².

Wait, wait, no, because 0.0064 is 6.4e-3 m². So σ is 3e-6 C / 6.4e-3 m² = (3 / 6.4) * 1e-6 / 1e-3 = (0.46875) * 1e-3 = 4.6875e-4 C/m².

Wait, that can't be right because 1e-6 divided by 1e-3 is 1e-3. So 3/6.4 is about 0.46875, so 0.46875e-3 C/m², which is 4.6875e-4 C/m². Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the electric field for an infinite sheet is E = σ/(2ε₀). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, for a single sheet, the field is σ/(2ε₀). But wait, wait, no. Let me think again. No, wait: For a single infinite sheet with surface charge σ, the electric field is E = σ/(2ε₀) pointing away from the sheet (if σ is positive). But in this case, the plate has two sheets. Wait, no, the plate is a conductor. So the charge is on the two surfaces. Oh wait, no, no, the plate is a conductor, so the charge spreads out on both surfaces. So each surface has σ = 3e-6 C / (0.08 m)^2, as I calculated. So each face contributes an electric field.

Wait, but the point is just off the center, so in between the two faces? No, wait, the point is off the center—wait, no, the plate is a square, so maybe the point is near the center but off the plate. Let me think about the setup.

Wait, the plate is a square, with two faces. The charge on the top face and the charge on the bottom face. The point is at 0.50 mm from the center. Wait, the plate's thickness is negligible, so the center is in the plane of the plate. So the point is 0.50 mm away from the center, so 0.5e-3 meters away, perpendicular to the plate.

Wait, but the plate has two surfaces each with charge. Wait, no, wait, no. The plate is a conductor, so the charge is on the two surfaces. Each face has 3e-6 C. So when you are near the plate, the field from each face adds up.

Wait, for a single infinite sheet, the field is σ/(2ε₀) on each side. So for two sheets, each contributing σ/(2ε₀), but in the same direction because they're on opposite sides.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the plate is a single conductor with two surfaces, each carrying charge. So the point is just outside one of the surfaces.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The plate is a square, 8 cm edge, so each face is 8 cm x 8 cm. The plate's thickness is negligible, so it's like a flat sheet with two surfaces. When the charge is placed on the conductor, it resides on both surfaces. So each surface has half the charge, so 3e-6 C each.

Now, the point is just off the center, 0.5 mm away. So from the plate's center, moving 0.5 mm towards one face. Since the plate is a conductor, the electric field just outside each face is σ/(2ε₀), where σ is the charge per unit area on that face.

So each face contributes σ/(2ε₀) to the electric field at a point just outside that face. But wait, when you're near one face, the electric field from that face is σ/(2ε₀) pointing away, and the field from the other face is also σ/(2ε₀) but pointing toward? Or away?

Wait, no, because the other face is on the opposite side. So when you're just outside the top face, the top face's field is σ/(2ε₀) outward, and the bottom face's field at that point is σ/(2ε₀) inward, but wait, no. Wait, the bottom face is a sheet with positive charge, so the field it produces at the point just outside the top face would be pointing away from the bottom face, which would be toward the top face. So it would be in the opposite direction.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again. For a conducting plate with two surfaces each carrying charge, the field just outside one face is the sum of the field due to that face and the field due to the other face.

So for an infinite sheet, each face's field is σ/(2ε₀) pointing away (assuming positive charge). So for a point just outside the top face, the top face contributes σ/(2ε₀) upward, and the bottom face, which is at a distance d (the thickness of the plate, but since it's negligible, d approaches zero), so the bottom face contributes σ/(2ε₀) downward, because from the point's perspective, the bottom face is a sheet that's below it, so the field from the bottom face would point downward.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the point is just above the top face, then the bottom face is beneath the plate. So the field from the bottom face at that point would be in the same direction as the top face's field, because both are positive charges. Wait, no, wait. For an infinite sheet of positive charge, the field above the sheet is pointing away, i.e., upward, and the field below the sheet is pointing downward. But wait, no, for a single sheet, the field on both sides is σ/(2ε₀) pointing away on one side and toward on the other? No, no, wait: For an infinite sheet with positive charge, the electric field is pointing away from the sheet on both sides, each with magnitude σ/(2ε₀). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, I think that's a common misunderstanding.

Wait, wait, no. For a single infinite sheet with positive charge, the electric field on both sides is pointing away from the sheet, each with magnitude σ/(2ε₀). So the field just above the sheet is σ/(2ε₀) upward, and the field just below the sheet is σ/(2ε₀) downward. Wait, no, that can't be right because the field inside a conductor is zero, but this is just a single sheet, not a conductor.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as a non-conductor for a moment. Suppose I have an infinite sheet of charge with surface charge density σ. The electric field at any point near the sheet can be found using Gauss's law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that's a cylinder with its flat faces perpendicular to the sheet. The flux through the curved surface is zero because the field is radial and the curved area is parallel. So the flux is E * A for each end, so 2 E A = Q_enc / ε₀. But Q_enc is σ A, so 2 E A = σ A / ε₀ → E = σ/(2 ε₀) pointing away from the sheet on both sides.

Wait, so that's correct. So for a single sheet, the field on both sides is σ/(2 ε₀) away from the sheet. So for a conducting plate, which has two surfaces each with charge σ, what happens?

Wait, no, for a conducting plate, the charges reside on the two surfaces. So each surface has charge σ, and each contributes an electric field. So when you're just outside one face, the field from that face is σ/(2 ε₀) away, and the field from the other face is also σ/(2 ε₀) away, but in the same direction because the other face's field at that point is also outward.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Because the other face is on the opposite side. So if you're just outside the top face, the top face's field is pointing upward, and the bottom face's field at that point is pointing downward, because from that point's perspective, the bottom face is a sheet below it, so the field from the bottom face points downward.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the point is outside the top face. Let me try to visualize it.

Imagine the plate is lying in the xy-plane, centered at z=0. The top face is at z=+d/2, and the bottom at z=-d/2, where d is the plate's thickness. But since d is negligible, we can consider d approaching zero. So the point is at z=0.5 mm, which is just above the top face.

The top face has a charge σ, so the field it produces at the point is upward, E1 = σ/(2 ε₀).

The bottom face is at z=-d/2, and it has a charge σ as well. The electric field at the point due to the bottom face would be pointing downward, because the bottom face is below the point, so the field from a positive charge on the bottom face would point away from it, which is downward from the point's perspective.

So the total field at the point is E1 (upward) minus E2 (downward), but wait, E2 is the field from the bottom face at the point. Since the bottom face is at z=-d/2, the field it creates at z=0.5 mm would be in the negative z-direction.

So E_total = E1 (up) + E2 (down) → but E2 is negative in the upward direction. Wait, no, the field from the bottom face at the point is pointing downward, so it's subtracting from E1.

Wait, let me clarify: Each face's field at the point is σ/(2 ε₀), but in opposite directions. So E1 (from top face) is up, E2 (from bottom face) is down. So the net field is E1 - E2? But wait, since E2 is pointing down, it would subtract from E1.

Wait, but wait, no. Because E1 is up, E2 is down, so the net E is E1 - E2. But since both E1 and E2 are σ/(2 ε₀), their magnitudes are the same, so their directions determine the net.

Wait, that would mean that E_total = (σ/(2 ε₀)) [up] + (σ/(2 ε₀)) [down] → but that's zero? That can't be right.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply the field cancels out, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction.

Let me think again. The top face is at z=+d/2, with charge +σ. The point is at z=+0.5 mm, so just above the top face. The field from the top face at that point is pointing away from the top face, which is upward. The field from the bottom face (at z=-d/2) is pointing away from it, which at the point would be downward.

So the two fields are in opposite directions. So the net field is the difference between the two.

But wait, the distance from the bottom face to the point is (0.5 mm + d/2). But since d is negligible, approximately 0.5 mm. So the field from the bottom face at that point would be a bit less than σ/(2 ε₀) because it's further away. Wait, no, no, because when using the infinite sheet approximation, distance doesn't matter; the field is uniform and doesn't depend on distance.

Wait, but that's only true for an infinite sheet. Since the plate is finite but we're close to it, the infinite sheet approximation holds, so the field from each face is σ/(2 ε₀), regardless of distance. So each face contributes σ/(2 ε₀), but in opposite directions.

Wait, but that would mean that the net field is zero, which can't be right. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as each face contributing to the field in the same direction. Because the plate is a conductor, so the charges are on both surfaces. Wait, no, the point is just outside one face, so the field from that face is outward, and the field from the other face is inward. So their fields subtract.

Wait, let me think of a parallel plate capacitor. If I have two plates with charge +Q and -Q, the field between them is σ/ε₀, and outside, it's zero. But in this case, both faces have the same charge, so the fields would add outside.

Wait, no, in this problem, both faces have positive charge. So for a point outside the top face, the top face's field is outward (up), and the bottom face's field is also outward, which at that point would be downward because the bottom face is below the point.

So the net field would be E_top - E_bottom.

Wait, but both E_top and E_bottom are σ/(2 ε₀), but E_top is upward and E_bottom is downward, so their magnitudes subtract.

Wait, that would give a net field of zero, which doesn't make sense. So I must be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the plate as a single sheet with charge 2σ, but that doesn't seem right because each face has σ.

Wait, no, wait, no. The plate has two faces, each with charge σ. So the total charge is 2σ × area. So in our problem, total charge is 6e-6 C, so each face has 3e-6 C, which gives σ = 3e-6 / (0.08^2) as we calculated earlier.

But when considering the electric field at a point just outside one face, the field from that face is σ/(2 ε₀) away, and the field from the other face is also σ/(2 ε₀), but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but that would mean the fields cancel, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the plate as having both faces contributing to the field in the same direction. Because when you have a thick plate with charge on both faces, the fields from each face add up when outside the plate.

Wait, for example, imagine a thick plate with two charged surfaces. Each surface contributes E = σ/(2 ε₀) outward. So outside the plate, both surfaces contribute in the same direction, leading to a total E = σ/(ε₀).

But in our case, the plate is very thin, so the point is very close to the plate. But maybe the same logic applies.

Wait, no, because if the plate is thin, the two faces are very close together. So the point is just outside one face, the field from that face is σ/(2 ε₀) outward, and the field from the other face is also σ/(2 ε₀) outward, but because the other face is on the opposite side, the field at the point due to that face is pointing in the same direction as the first face's field.

Wait, but how? If the point is just outside the top face, the field from the top face is upward (away from it), and the field from the bottom face, which is a sheet below the point, would have a field pointing downward at the point. But wait, no, because the bottom face is positively charged, so the field it produces at the point would be away from it, which is downward from the point's perspective.

Wait, but that would mean that the two fields are in opposite directions. So E_top is upward, E_bottom is downward. So the net field is E_top - E_bottom.

But if E_top and E_bottom are both σ/(2 ε₀), then their difference would be zero, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the entire plate as a single entity. Since the plate's thickness is negligible, the charge is
