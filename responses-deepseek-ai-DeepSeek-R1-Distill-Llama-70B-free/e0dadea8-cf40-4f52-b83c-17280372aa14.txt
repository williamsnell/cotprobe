Question:

A furniture store had a truck that an employee of the store used to deliver furniture to the store's customers. One afternoon while the employee was driving the truck to deliver a chair to a customer, the employee negligently ran through a stop sign and hit a car. The driver of the car suffered a leg injury and succeeded in suing the furniture store, recovering $25,000. Assume that all of these events occur in a jurisdiction that has statutes permitting defendants to bring claims for contribution and indemnity. In the event that the furniture store brings suit against its employee (the truck driver) to recover for its losses, the furniture store will recover

Options:

A: $15,000, because the employee and the furniture store share 60-40 responsibility for the accident.
B: $25,000, unless the furniture store was fully insured against such losses.
C: nothing, because the furniture store should have maintained the truck in a safer condition.
D: $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident.
E: nothing, because the furniture store was primarily liable for the entire amount of damages.
F: $12,500, unless the furniture store had provided proper training to the employee.
G: nothing, because the employee was not acting negligently.
H: the full amount, only if the employee has sufficient personal insurance coverage.
I: $12,500, because the employer and employee bear equal shares of responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries.
J: nothing, because the employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about tort law, specifically dealing with employer liability and the ability to recover from an employee. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The scenario: A furniture store's employee was driving the company truck to deliver furniture. He ran a stop sign negligently and hit another car, injuring the driver. The driver sued the store and got $25k. Now, the store is suing the employee to get back the money they had to pay. The question is, will the store recover anything, and if so, how much?

First, I remember that in tort law, employers can be held vicariously liable for the actions of their employees if those actions occur within the scope of employment. So the store was sued because the employee was doing his job when the accident happened. That makes sense why the store had to pay $25k.

Now, the store is trying to get that money back from the employee. I think this has to do with indemnity and contribution. Contribution is about sharing the loss among those at fault, but indemnity is more about one party being held responsible and then seeking full reimbursement from another.

Wait, but wait. I think the general rule is that an employer is vicariously liable, which doesn't necessarily mean they were at fault themselves. So if the employee was negligent, the employer is liable, but the employer can seek indemnity from the employee. Or can they?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. I remember something about whether the employer can be indemnified by the employee. In some cases, if the employer's liability is based solely on the employee's actions (like respondeat superior), the employer can seek indemnity. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another point is that in some jurisdictions, the employer and employee might be considered jointly and severally liable. So the plaintiff can recover from either, but the employer might then seek contribution from the employee.

Wait, but the question is about the store suing the employee. So the store paid $25k to the injured driver, and now wants the employee to reimburse them.

I think the key here is whether the employer can recover from the employee. If the employer's liability is based on the employee's negligence within the scope of employment, the employer might be able to seek indemnity.

But wait, another angle: the doctrine of respondeat superior holds the employer liable for the employee's actions, but the employer isn't at fault. So the employer can seek full indemnity from the employee because the employee was the one at fault. So the store could recover the entire $25k from the employee.

But I also remember something about pro rata liability. If both the employer and employee are at fault, the loss would be split. But in this case, the employer wasn't at fault; the employee was. So the employer can get full indemnity.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the store will recover $25k because the employee was at fault. That aligns with what I was thinking.

Option B says $25k unless the store was fully insured. Wait, does insurance affect this? I don't think so. Whether the employer was insured doesn't change their right to indemnity. So B is incorrect.

Option J says nothing because the employee was within the scope. But that's about the initial liability, not the right to indemnity. So J is wrong.

Other options: A and F talk about shared responsibility, but the employer isn't at fault. So those are incorrect.

So the correct answer should be D.

The scenario involves a furniture store being held vicariously liable for an accident caused by its employee, who was driving the company truck within the scope of employment. The store paid $25,000 to the injured driver and is now suing the employee to recover this amount. The key legal principles here are respondeat superior, which holds employers liable for employees' actions within the scope of employment, and the employer's right to seek indemnity from the employee when the employer's liability arises solely from the employee's negligence.

In this case, the employer was not at fault; the employee's negligence caused the accident. Under the doctrine of indemnity, the employer can recover the full amount ($25,000) from the employee because the employer's liability was derivative of the employee's actions. Insurance status does not affect the employer's right to indemnity, and there is no indication that the employer shared fault. Therefore, the furniture store will recover the full $25,000 from the employee.

Option D correctly reflects this outcome.
