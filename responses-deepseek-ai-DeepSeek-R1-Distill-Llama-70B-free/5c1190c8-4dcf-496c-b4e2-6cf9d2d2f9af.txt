Question:

 If a global ban would not be effective in prohibiting genetic engineering that goes beyond eliminating obvious defects, then Singer suggests which "bolder" strategy?

Options:

A: none of the above
B: using a lottery system so everyone gets a fair chance at the benefits of genetic engineering
C: using sanctions and trade restrictions against countries that violate the ban
D: allowing genetic engineering only for medical purposes
E: promoting genetic engineering only for the wealthy
F: creating a global consensus on acceptable genetic engineering practices
G: developing a global regulatory body to monitor and control genetic engineering activities
H: implementing a global education program to convince people of the dangers of excessive genetic engineering
I: requiring genetic engineering for every newborn child
J: creating a world military that would enforce the ban with greater strength

Okay, so I've got this question about Peter Singer's views on genetic engineering. Hmm, let me think. The question is about what Singer suggests as a bolder strategy if a global ban isn't effective in prohibiting genetic engineering beyond just eliminating obvious defects. 

Alright, I remember that Singer has written about the ethics of genetic engineering. He's a utilitarian, so he probably considers the consequences of such actions. The question is about alternatives to a ban. So the options are from A to J.

The first option is A: none of the above. But I don't know yet. Let me go through the others.

Option B: Using a lottery system. I don't recall Singer suggesting that. It sounds more like a fairness measure, maybe to distribute benefits equally, but I'm not sure if that's his approach here.

Option C: Sanctions and trade restrictions. That's a possible strategy, but does Singer suggest that? I think he might be more in favor of regulation than punitive measures. Not sure yet.

Option D: Allowing only for medical purposes. That sounds familiar. Some ethicists argue that genetic engineering should be limited to treating diseases, not enhancing traits. But the question is about a bolder strategy when a ban isn't enough. So if the ban isn't effective, maybe allowing some uses but regulating them? I'm not certain if this is Singer's bolder approach.

Option E: Promoting it only for the wealthy. That doesn't sound right. Singer is concerned about equity, I think. He might oppose making it available only to the rich, as that would increase inequality.

Option F: Creating a global consensus on acceptable practices. This sounds plausible. Singer might support international agreements or ethical guidelines to ensure that genetic engineering is used responsibly. A consensus would mean that countries agree on what's acceptable, which could be more effective than a ban.

Option G: Developing a global regulatory body. That's another regulatory approach. It would monitor and control activities. I think this is a possible answer because Singer might advocate for oversight rather than a complete ban, which isn't working.

Option H: Implementing a global education program. Education is a tool, but is it the bolder strategy? Maybe, but I'm not sure if Singer emphasizes this as the primary approach.

Option I: Requiring genetic engineering for every child. That seems extreme and probably not Singer's suggestion. It raises ethical issues about choice and autonomy.

Option J: Creating a world military to enforce the ban. That sounds too aggressive and unlikely. Singer is more about ethical reasoning than military force.

Wait, the question states that the ban isn't effective, so Singer suggests a bolder strategy than the ban. So maybe instead of a ban, he proposes something else. I think Singer has talked about the need for regulation and ethical guidelines rather than outright bans. 

So looking back, option F is about creating a global consensus, which would involve agreeing on what practices are acceptable. That makes sense as a strategy to guide the use of genetic engineering without a ban. Alternatively, option G suggests a regulatory body, which is also a form of oversight.

I'm trying to remember what Singer actually said. From what I recall, Singer is critical of unregulated genetic engineering and suggests that we need international cooperation and regulation. So maybe option G, a global regulatory body, is the answer. Alternatively, option F is about consensus, which is more about agreement rather than enforcement.

Wait, the question says the ban wouldn't be effective, so maybe the alternative is not a ban but a different approach. Singer might argue that instead of trying to ban, we should regulate and have a framework. So a regulatory body would monitor and control, ensuring that genetic engineering stays within acceptable limits.

Alternatively, creating a consensus (option F) could be part of the process, but the actual mechanism might be a regulatory body. So I'm a bit torn between F and G.

Another angle: the question says the strategy is "bolder." Creating a global regulatory body might be more proactive and bold compared to just a consensus, which might be more about discussion.

So, I think the answer is G: developing a global regulatory body to monitor and control genetic engineering activities.

The question asks about Peter Singer's suggested "bolder" strategy if a global ban on genetic engineering beyond eliminating obvious defects is ineffective. Singer, a utilitarian, likely favors approaches that balance ethical considerations with practical regulation. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (none of the above):** Unlikely, as Singer does propose strategies for genetic engineering regulation.
- **Option B (lottery system):** Not aligned with Singer's emphasis on ethical and equitable solutions.
- **Option C (sanctions and trade restrictions):** Possible but less likely, as Singer may prefer cooperative regulation over punitive measures.
- **Option D (allowing only for medical purposes):** Plausible, as it aligns with restricting genetic engineering to therapeutic uses, but the question seeks a "bolder" strategy beyond such limitations.
- **Option E (promoting for the wealthy):** Contrary to Singer's concerns about equity and reducing inequality.
- **Option F (global consensus):** A possible approach, as Singer might support ethical agreements, but it may lack enforceability.
- **Option G (global regulatory body):** A strong candidate, as it represents a proactive, bold strategy to monitor and control genetic engineering activities.
- **Option H (education program):** Less likely as a primary strategy, though education could support other approaches.
- **Option I (requiring genetic engineering for all):** Extreme and unethical, unlikely to be Singer's suggestion.
- **Option J (world military enforcement):** Too aggressive and inconsistent with Singer's ethical reasoning.

Singer likely advocates for a regulatory framework to ensure responsible use of genetic engineering. A global regulatory body (Option G) is the boldest and most comprehensive strategy, as it provides oversight and enforcement, addressing the ineffectiveness of a ban.
