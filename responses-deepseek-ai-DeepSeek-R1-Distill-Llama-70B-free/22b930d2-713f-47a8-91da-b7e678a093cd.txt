Question:

An integer c is a common divisor of two integers x and y if and only if c is a divisor of x and c is a divisor of y. Which of the following sets of integers could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers?

Options:

A: {-10, -5, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10}
B: {-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6}
C: {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}
D: {-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6}

Okay, so I have this math problem here about common divisors of two integers. Hmm, I remember that a common divisor is a number that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. The question is asking which of the given sets could be all the common divisors of two integers.

Let me look at the options again. The options are A, B, C, D. Each is a set of integers. I think the key here is to remember some properties of common divisors.

Wait, I recall that the set of all common divisors of two numbers has to include 1 and -1 because 1 and -1 divide every integer. Also, if a number is a common divisor, its negative is also a common divisor. So the set should be symmetric around zero, I guess.

Another thing I remember is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) is the largest positive common divisor, and all other common divisors are its divisors. So the set of common divisors should include all divisors of the GCD.

Wait, but in the options, some include zero and others don't. Oh, wait, can zero be a common divisor? No, because division by zero is undefined. So any set that includes zero as a common divisor is invalid. Because, technically, zero can't divide any number. So I should eliminate any option that includes zero.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Includes 0. So that's invalid. So A is out.

Option B: Includes 0. So B is also out.

Option C: Doesn't have 0. So maybe C is a candidate.

Option D: Includes 0, so D is out.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The initial thought was that zero can't be a divisor, so any set containing zero can't be a set of common divisors. So that leaves only option C as a possibility.

Wait, but let me check each option again to be sure.

Option C is {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}.

So the positive divisors here are 1,2,3,6. The negatives are -1,-2,-3,-6.

So the GCD would be 6 because that's the largest positive one. So the set must include all divisors of 6, right? So the divisors of 6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. Which is exactly what option C has.

So that makes sense. So option C is a valid set of common divisors.

Option D includes zero, which is invalid, so D is out.

So the correct answer must be option C.

To determine which set could be the set of all common divisors of two integers, we analyze the properties of common divisors:

1. **Key Properties of Common Divisors**:  
   - A common divisor of two integers \(x\) and \(y\) must divide both \(x\) and \(y\) without leaving a remainder.  
   - The set of all common divisors must include \(1\) and \(-1\), as these divide every integer.  
   - If a number is a common divisor, its negative is also a common divisor. Thus, the set should be symmetric around zero.  
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) is the largest positive common divisor, and all other common divisors are divisors of the GCD.  
   - Zero cannot be a common divisor because division by zero is undefined.

2. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes \(0\), which is invalid because zero cannot be a common divisor.  
   - **Option B**: Also includes \(0\), so it is invalid for the same reason.  
   - **Option C**: Does not include \(0\), and the set \(\{-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6\}\) is symmetric around zero. The positive divisors \(\{1, 2, 3, 6\}\) are all divisors of \(6\), which would be the GCD. This set is valid.  
   - **Option D**: Includes \(0\), making it invalid.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   Option C is the only valid set, as it satisfies all the properties of common divisors and does not include \(0\).
