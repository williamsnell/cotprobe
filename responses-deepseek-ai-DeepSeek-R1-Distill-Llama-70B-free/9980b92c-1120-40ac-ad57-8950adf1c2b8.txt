Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a disk undergoing angular acceleration. I remember that rotational motion involves terms like angular displacement, angular velocity, and angular acceleration. Oh right, and linear quantities like distance traveled can be connected to the rotational ones.

The problem states: a disk with radius 0.1 meters is initially at rest, so its initial angular velocity must be zero. The angular acceleration is 2.0 rad/s². We need to find the total distance traveled by a point on the rim after 4.0 seconds. The options are A through J, with various distances.

Wait, the disk only rotates, so it's pure rotation, no translation. That means every point on the rim is moving in a circular path. The distance traveled by a point on the rim would be the arc length, right? Arc length is given by the formula s = rθ, where θ is the angular displacement in radians.

So first, I should probably find the angular displacement θ after 4 seconds. Since the disk starts from rest, the initial angular velocity ω₀ is zero. The angular acceleration α is given as 2 rad/s². I think the formula for angular displacement when initial velocity is zero is θ = (1/2)α t². Oh wait, yes, because angular displacement is the integral of angular acceleration over time. So θ = α t² / 2.

Let me plug in the numbers. α is 2 rad/s², and t is 4 s. So θ = (2 * (4)^2)/2. Wait, 4 squared is 16, multiplied by 2 is 32, divided by 2 is 16. So θ is 16 radians. Is that right? Let me double-check. Yeah, because θ = ½ α t². So ½ * 2 * 16 gives 16. Yep.

Now, the arc length s is rθ. The radius r is 0.1 m, so s = 0.1 m * 16 rad. That would be 1.6 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, J is 1.6 m. But wait, that's not one of the first options I thought of. Let me go through the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me see: J is 1.6 m. So that would be the answer, right? But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I mix up linear and angular stuff. Let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here.

Alternative approach: Maybe using the equation for linear distance when rotating. Since each point on the rim is moving in a circle, the linear speed is related to angular speed by v = rω. But since it's accelerating, the angular speed isn't constant. So perhaps I should compute the angular speed at time t, then find the average speed, but that might complicate things.

Wait, the angular displacement is 16 rad, so the arc length is 0.1 * 16 = 1.6 m. So J is the correct answer. But wait, let's check the options again. The options list J as 1.6 m. So that's the one.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 1.6 isn't one of the middle options. Oh well, the calculation seems straightforward. So I think the answer should be J.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of a disk undergoing angular acceleration. The disk has a radius of \( r = 0.1 \, \text{m} \), an angular acceleration of \( \alpha = 2.0 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \), and a time interval of \( t = 4.0 \, \text{s} \). The disk starts from rest, so its initial angular velocity is \( \omega_0 = 0 \).

### Step 1: Calculate angular displacement
The angular displacement \( \theta \) can be calculated using the formula for constant angular acceleration:
\[
\theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\theta = \frac{1}{2} (2.0) (4.0)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (2.0) (16) = 16 \, \text{radians}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate arc length
The total distance traveled by a point on the rim is the arc length \( s \), which is related to the angular displacement \( \theta \) and the radius \( r \) by:
\[
s = r \theta
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
s = (0.1) (16) = 1.6 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
From the given options, \( 1.6 \, \text{m} \) corresponds to option **J**.

Thus, the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk is **1.6 meters**.

Answer: J
