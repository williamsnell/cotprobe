Okay, so I've got this problem here about ethane gas and using the perfect gas law to find the pressure. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

First, the problem states that we have 10.0 moles of ethane (C₂H₆) in a volume of 4.860 dm³ at a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius. I remember that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So I need to find the pressure P. 

Wait, I should make sure all the units are compatible. The gas constant R has different values depending on the units. Let me recall. Oh right, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K when using atm for pressure, liters for volume, moles, and Kelvin for temperature. 

So, let's convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. 27°C is 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 K. That's approximately 300 K for simplicity, but maybe I should keep it at 300.15 for more accuracy. 

The volume is given in dm³. Oh wait, 1 dm³ is equal to 1 liter. So 4.860 dm³ is 4.860 liters. 

Now, plug the numbers into the ideal gas equation. 

P = nRT / V.

n is 10.0 mol, R is 0.0821, T is 300.15 K, V is 4.860 L. 

Calculating that: 

Multiply n, R, and T together. So 10 * 0.0821 * 300.15. Let me compute that step by step. 

10 * 0.0821 = 0.821. Then 0.821 * 300.15. Let me compute 0.821 * 300 = 246.3, and 0.821 * 0.15 is about 0.12315. Adding them gives 246.3 + 0.12315 = 246.42315. 

So nRT is approximately 246.423 atm·L.

Now divide by the volume: 246.423 / 4.860. Let me do that division. 

Let me see, 4.860 times 50 is 243. So 246.423 - 243 = 3.423. So 50 plus (3.423 / 4.860). 

3.423 divided by 4.860 is roughly 0.704. So total is about 50.704 atm. 

Looking at the options, option I is 50.7 atm, which matches closely. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Wait, 10.0 mol * 0.0821 = 0.821, correct. 0.821 * 300.15 = let me compute 0.821 * 300 = 246.3, and 0.821 * 0.15 = 0.12315. So total 246.42315. 

Then 246.42315 divided by 4.860. Let me compute this more accurately. 

4.860 * 50 = 243. So 246.42315 - 243 = 3.42315. 

3.42315 / 4.860 = let me do this division. 3.42315 ÷ 4.86. 

So 4.86 goes into 3.423 how many times? 0.7 times because 4.86 * 0.7 is 3.402. So 0.7, and the remainder is about 0.02115. 

So 50.7, which is option I. 

Alternatively, maybe I should compute using more precise values. Let me try using calculator-style steps. 

nRT = 10 * 0.0821 * (27+273.15) = 10 * 0.0821 * 300.15 = 10 * (0.0821 * 300.15).

Compute 0.0821 * 300.15. 

0.08 * 300.15 = 24.012, 0.0021 *300.15 = ~0.6303. So 24.012 + 0.6303 = 24.6423. 

Wait wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait no, because 0.0821 is 0.08 + 0.0021. So 0.08 *300.15 is 24.012, 0.0021 *300.15 is 0.630315. So adding them: 24.012 + 0.630315 =24.642315. 

Multiply by 10: 246.42315. 

Divide by 4.860: 246.42315 /4.860. Let me compute 4.86 * 50 = 243. Then subtract 246.42315-243=3.42315. 

Now, 4.860 * x =3.42315. x =3.42315/4.86 ≈0.704. So total is 50.704 atm. So 50.7 atm is the correct answer, which is option I. 

Looking back at the options, option I is 50.7 atm. So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or} \quad P = \frac{nRT}{V}
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- **Number of moles (\(n\))**: \(10.0 \, \text{mol}\)
- **Temperature (\(T\))**: \(27^\circ \text{C} = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K}\)
- **Volume (\(V\))**: \(4.860 \, \text{dm}^3 = 4.860 \, \text{L}\)
- **Gas constant (\(R\))**: \(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\)

### Step 2: Plug values into the equation
\[
P = \frac{nRT}{V} = \frac{(10.0)(0.0821)(300.15)}{4.860}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \(nRT\)
\[
nRT = (10.0)(0.0821)(300.15) = 246.42315 \, \text{L·atm}
\]

### Step 4: Divide by \(V\)
\[
P = \frac{246.42315}{4.860} \approx 50.704 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The calculated pressure is approximately \(50.7 \, \text{atm}\), which corresponds to **option I**.
