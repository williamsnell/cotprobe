Okay, so I've got this question about who is more likely to experience depression after a loss. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which group is more likely to feel depression after experiencing a loss. Loss here probably refers to something like the death of a loved one, a breakup, or another significant life event.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Have a strong social support network. Wait, I remember that social support is usually a protective factor. People with good support are less likely to feel depressed because they have others to turn to. So this might mean they're less likely to experience depression, not more. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: Have no previous history of mental health issues. Hmm, I think people without a history might be less likely to develop depression because they don't have a prior condition. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's the opposite—those with a history are more vulnerable. Wait, if someone has a history, they might be more at risk. So B says "no previous history," so they might be less likely. So B is probably not the correct choice.

Option C: Have not previously experienced depression. This is similar to B. If they haven't had depression before, maybe they're less likely this time. So this would mean C is not the right answer either.

Option D: Have a high income. High income usually means better resources—like access to therapy, better healthcare, etc. So higher income might reduce the risk of depression after a loss. So D is probably not the correct answer.

Option E: Have been married less than a year. Wait, so if someone's been married a short time, maybe they're in a newer relationship, but I'm not sure how that ties to depression after a loss. Unless the loss is of the spouse. If they were married a short time, maybe the loss is more sudden or unexpected, which could contribute to more severe grief. Or maybe not. I'm not certain about this one. I'll have to think more.

Option F: Are young survivors. Young people, like in their teens or twenties, might have less coping mechanisms or life experience to deal with loss. Or maybe older adults are more at risk because of other factors. Wait, I think that younger people might actually have more resilience, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's the opposite—like, the age could affect how they process grief. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the older you are, the more losses you've experienced, but that doesn't directly answer who is more likely to get depression. I'll need to come back to this.

Option G: Are in good health. Physical health can influence mental health. If someone is in good health, they might have better energy and resources to cope with loss. So G suggests they are less likely to get depressed, making G not the correct answer.

Now, thinking again about each option. The question is about who is more likely to experience depression after a loss. So we're looking for risk factors.

I remember that lack of social support is a big risk factor. So A is about having strong support, which would lower the risk. So A is not the answer.

Previous history of mental health issues, especially depression, makes people more vulnerable. So if you have a history (so options B and C are about not having), that would mean those without are less likely. So B and C are not correct.

High income (D) probably helps, so not the answer.

Option E: Married less than a year. If someone loses a spouse after a short marriage, maybe they didn't have as much time to build a support system or the loss is more shocking. Or perhaps it's about the circumstances of the loss. But I'm not sure if this is a significant factor compared to others.

Option F: Young survivors. I think that older adults might have more health issues or less social support, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, younger people might have more stress from other areas of life, making them more susceptible. Or maybe it's the opposite. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, I remember that younger people might have more intense emotional reactions but perhaps better resilience. Maybe older adults are more likely to experience depression after a loss because of things like isolation or more accumulated losses. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Alternatively, being young doesn't necessarily mean higher risk. I'm not too confident about F.

Wait, another angle: who is more likely. So factors that increase vulnerability. Let me think about what I've learned before. Risk factors for depression after loss include lack of social support, prior history of depression, traumatic losses, and maybe being female, but that's not an option here.

Wait, the question is about those more likely to experience depression after a loss. So among the options, which is a risk factor.

Looking again:

- E: Married less than a year. If someone's spouse dies after a short marriage, perhaps the relationship was still in the honeymoon phase, or maybe they haven't built a strong support network yet. Or perhaps the loss is unexpected. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: Are young survivors. Or maybe E.

Alternatively, maybe E is about being in a new marriage, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I remember that people with a history of depression are more likely to experience it again. So the correct answer would be those who have a previous history, but the options don't have that. Because the options are about who is more likely.

Wait, looking at the options, B says "Have no previous history of mental health issues." So if someone has a previous history, they are more at risk. So the correct answer would be someone without a history? No, wait, the question is about those more likely. So those who have a previous history are more likely. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options don't include having a previous history. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Strong social support → less likely

B: No previous mental health → less likely

C: Not previously experienced depression → less likely

D: High income → less likely

E: Married less than a year → ?

F: Young → ?

G: Good health → less likely

So the correct answer must be E or F, as the others are protective factors.

Between E and F.

I think that being young might not necessarily make someone more susceptible. Maybe older adults are more at risk, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: when someone is young and loses a parent, for example, they might be in a stage of life where they're building their own family, which could complicate things. Or perhaps young people have more responsibilities, making it harder to cope.

Alternatively, maybe being young doesn't directly correlate, but other factors do.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about other risk factors. People who experience sudden or unexpected loss are more at risk. But that's not covered in the options.

Another factor is the relationship to the deceased. Losing a spouse, child, or someone very close can have a bigger impact. But that's not in the options either.

The options given are about personal characteristics, not the nature of the loss.

So, of the options, the ones that indicate higher risk are those without support (but A is the opposite), with a history (but B and C are the opposite), etc.

Wait, perhaps F is correct. Young survivors might have more stressors. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

The question is about who is more likely to experience depression after a loss. So, the correct answer should be a risk factor, meaning something that increases the likelihood.

Looking at the options, A (strong support) is protective, so not a risk factor.

B and C indicate no previous issues, which would mean lower risk.

D (high income) is protective.

G (good health) is protective.

So the remaining options are E and F.

E is about being married less than a year. Maybe the loss of a spouse so soon could be traumatic, leading to more depression. But I'm not sure if that's a stronger factor than being young.

F: Are young survivors. I'm trying to remember if age is a factor. I think older adults might have more chronic illnesses, but perhaps they also have more coping mechanisms. Or maybe younger people have more responsibilities, making it harder to cope.

Alternatively, I've heard that the risk of depression can be higher in certain age groups, but I'm not certain about this.

Wait, I think that the absence of social support, previous history, and being female are more significant risk factors, but none of these are the options except perhaps E and F.

Alternatively, I might have to make an educated guess. Since the options are limited, I think that F: Are young survivors might be the answer, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: the answer might be E. Because if you've been married less than a year, the loss might be more unexpected or the relationship might have been more intense, leading to more severe grief.

Alternatively, I'm not certain, but considering the options, perhaps E is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not confident. I think I need to make a decision. Based on the options, I think the correct answer is E: Have been married less than a year.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again.

Another approach: the question is about experiencing depression after a loss. The people more likely would be those with less support, more stress, or previous vulnerabilities.

But in the options, only E and F are possible. I'm not sure, but perhaps F is the answer because younger people might have more life changes or stressors that make it harder to cope with loss.

Alternatively, perhaps being young isn't a significant factor. I'm stuck.

Wait, I think I remember that people who are younger are more likely to experience depression in general, but after a loss, it's the circumstances that matter more.

Hmm, maybe I should go with F: Are young survivors.

Wait, no, maybe the correct answer is E. Because if you're married less than a year, the loss of a spouse might be more shocking, as the marriage was still new. Or perhaps the support system as a married couple is still developing.

Alternatively, I'm not certain. I might have to pick F.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because being a young survivor, like losing a parent when you're young, can have a lasting impact. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, I think that F might not be correct because age alone isn't a strong indicator. Maybe E is more about the circumstances of the loss.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of what the correct answer usually is in such questions. I recall that factors like lack of social support, prior mental health issues, and being female increase the risk. Since those aren't options, perhaps the next best is F: young survivors.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the death of a spouse after a short marriage could mean that the person hasn't built a strong support network outside the marriage, leading to more isolation. That might contribute to depression.

So maybe E is the correct answer.

I'm torn between E and F, but I think I'll go with F: Are young survivors. But I'm not 100% sure.

The question asks who is more likely to experience depression after a loss, and the options provided are analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: Having a strong social support network is a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of depression. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option B**: Having no previous history of mental health issues suggests a lower risk of depression, making this option incorrect.  
- **Option C**: Not having previously experienced depression also indicates a lower risk, so this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option D**: Having a high income typically provides better access to resources like therapy and healthcare, reducing the risk of depression. Thus, this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option E**: Being married less than a year could imply a more sudden or unexpected loss, potentially increasing the risk of depression. This is a plausible answer.  
- **Option F**: Being a young survivor might involve more stressors or less coping experience, but age alone is not a strong indicator of depression after a loss. This is also a plausible answer.  
- **Option G**: Being in good health is a protective factor, reducing the risk of depression. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.  

After evaluating the options, the analysis narrows it down to **E** and **F**. While both could be risk factors, **E** (married less than a year) is considered the more likely answer because the sudden loss of a spouse in a new marriage could be particularly traumatic and isolating.  

Answer: E
