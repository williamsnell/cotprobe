The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The same gene that causes various coat patterns in wild and domesticated cats also causes the cross-eyed condition in these cats, the cross-eyed condition being slightly maladaptive. In a hypothetical environment, the coat pattern that is associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive, with the result that both the coat pattern and the cross-eyed condition increase in a feline population over time. Which statement is supported by these observations?

Options:

A: Genetic mutations causing the coat pattern are more likely to occur in this population.
B: Natural selection always results in the elimination of maladaptive traits.
C: Polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive, and should become less common in future generations.
D: This scenario disproves the theory of evolution.
E: The cross-eyed condition is actually an adaptive trait in this environment.
F: The coat pattern gene and the cross-eyed condition gene are separate and unrelated.
G: Phenotype is often the result of compromise.
H: Evolution is progressive and tends toward a more perfect population.
I: Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time.
J: The cross-eyed condition will eventually disappear from the population as it is maladaptive.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about genetics and natural selection, I think. Let me read it again.

The question says that the same gene causing various coat patterns in cats also causes them to be cross-eyed. And cross-eyed is slightly maladaptive. But in this hypothetical environment, the coat pattern associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive, so both traits increase in the population over time. The question is asking which statement is supported by these observations. The options are from A to J.

Alright, so I need to understand what's going on here. So, a single gene affects both coat pattern and eye alignment. When the coat pattern is beneficial, it's selected for, but the cross-eyed condition is a side effect that's slightly bad. But in this case, the good trait (coat pattern) is so advantageous that it outweighs the bad (cross-eyed).

Wait, so this is an example of a trade-off, right? Because having the gene gives a benefit but also a cost. But since the benefit is strong enough, the gene becomes more common despite the negative aspect.

So the question is about what this scenario supports. Looking at the options, I need to pick the correct one.

Looking at the options one by one:

A: Genetic mutations causing the coat pattern are more likely to occur in this population. Hmm, the question doesn't talk about mutation rates increasing, just selection. So probably not A.

B: Natural selection always results in the elimination of maladaptive traits. Well, in this case, the cross-eyed condition is maladaptive but it's increasing because it's linked to a beneficial trait. So B is not correct because selection doesn't always eliminate maladaptive traits if they're tied to something beneficial.

C: Polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive and should become less common. Wait, the scenario doesn't mention polygenic traits. It's a single gene causing two traits. So C is probably incorrect.

D: This scenario disproves the theory of evolution. Nope, it's actually an example of evolution in action via natural selection. So D is wrong.

E: The cross-eyed condition is actually an adaptive trait in this environment. No, because the question states it's slightly maladaptive. So E isn't correct.

F: The coat pattern gene and cross-eyed condition are separate and unrelated. No, the question says it's the same gene causing both. So F is wrong.

G: Phenotype is often the result of compromise. Oh, this seems right. Because the gene provides a beneficial coat pattern but also a less beneficial eye trait. So it's a compromise between the two effects. So G looks like a good candidate.

H: Evolution is progressive and tends toward a more perfect population. No, evolution doesn't aim for perfection; it's about fitness in the current environment. So H is incorrect.

I: Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes over time. Wait, but in this case, the maladaptive gene is increasing because it's linked to a beneficial trait. So I is incorrect.

J: The cross-eyed condition will eventually disappear as it's maladaptive. No, because it's linked to the adaptive coat pattern, so it's actually increasing, not disappearing. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer must be G. Because the phenotype combines the effects of the gene, leading to a compromise between beneficial and maladaptive traits.

The question describes a scenario where a single gene influences both a beneficial coat pattern and a maladaptive cross-eyed condition in cats. Despite the cross-eyed condition being slightly maladaptive, the coat pattern is highly adaptive in this environment, leading both traits to increase in the population. This situation illustrates a trade-off, where the benefits of the coat pattern outweigh the costs of the cross-eyed condition.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The question does not discuss mutation rates, only selection.
- **B**: Incorrect. Natural selection does not always eliminate maladaptive traits if they are linked to beneficial ones.
- **C**: Incorrect. The scenario involves a single gene, not polygenic inheritance.
- **D**: Incorrect. This scenario supports evolution, not disproves it.
- **E**: Incorrect. The cross-eyed condition is stated to be maladaptive, not adaptive.
- **F**: Incorrect. The traits are caused by the same gene, so they are related.
- **G**: Correct. The phenotype reflects a compromise between the adaptive coat pattern and the maladaptive cross-eyed condition.
- **H**: Incorrect. Evolution does not aim for perfection, only fitness in the current environment.
- **I**: Incorrect. The maladaptive gene is increasing due to its linkage with the adaptive trait.
- **J**: Incorrect. The cross-eyed condition is increasing, not disappearing.

The correct answer is **G**, as the scenario demonstrates that phenotypes often result from compromises between different effects of a gene.

Answer: G
