Okay, so I've got this question about car insurance and how much the insurance company will pay after an accident. Let me try to break it down.

So, Frank Lincoln's car had a blow-out, causing him to swerve and hit John Martin's car. Leon Taylor was a passenger in Martin's car and had medical expenses of $6,251. Mr. Martin's bills were $75. The question is about how much Lincoln's insurance will pay, and he has 5/10 bodily injury insurance.

Wait, I remember that bodily injury insurance is usually split into two parts. The first number is per person, and the second is per accident. So 5/10 would mean $5,000 per person and $10,000 per accident.

So in this case, there are two people injured: Leon Taylor and John Martin. Leon's expenses are $6,251, and John's are $75.

Now, per person, the insurance pays up to $5,000. So for Leon, his expenses are more than $5,000, but the insurance would only cover up to $5k. For John, his bills are $75, which is way below the $5k limit. 

So adding those up: $5,000 for Leon and $75 for John, totaling $5,075.

Wait, but the per accident limit is $10k. Since $5k plus $75 is only $5,075, which is well under $10k, the insurance will cover each person up to their individual limits.

So the total the insurance company pays is $5,075. Looking at the options, option G is $5,075. So that should be the correct answer.

I don't think there's any other factors here. It doesn't mention anything about property damage, just bodily injury. So it's all about the per person and per accident limits.

The question involves determining how much Frank Lincoln's 5/10 bodily injury insurance will pay after an accident. The 5/10 coverage means $5,000 per person and $10,000 per accident. In this case, Leon Taylor incurred $6,251 in medical expenses, but the insurance will only cover up to $5,000 for him. John Martin's medical bills were $75, which is below the $5,000 per person limit. Adding these amounts gives a total of $5,075, which is within the $10,000 per accident limit. Therefore, the insurance company will pay $5,075.

The correct answer is:

G: $5,075

Answer: G
