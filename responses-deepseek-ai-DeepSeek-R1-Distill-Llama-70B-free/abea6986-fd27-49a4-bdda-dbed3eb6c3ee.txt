Question:

Which of the following is not correct about economies of scale?

Options:

A: Economies of scale are associated with increases in production of output.
B: Economies of scale are associated with the rising or increasing portion of an average total cost (ATC) curve.
C: Economies of scale are associated with the declining or decreasing portions of the ATC curve.
D: Economies of scale result in decreases in per unit average cost.

Okay, so I have this question about economies of scale, and I'm trying to figure out which option is incorrect. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what do I remember about economies of scale? I think it's when a company increases its production and, as a result, the average cost per unit decreases. That makes sense because producing more can lead to lower costs due to things like bulk purchasing, better specialization, and more efficient use of resources.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Economies of scale are associated with increases in production of output. That sounds right because you need to produce more to get these economies. So A is correct.

Option B: Economies of scale are associated with the rising or increasing portion of an average total cost (ATC) curve. Hmm, wait. The ATC curve usually has a U-shape, right? It decreases initially as production increases, reaches a minimum, and then starts increasing. The decreasing part is where economies of scale happen. So if B says the rising part is associated with economies of scale, that doesn't sound right. That might be the incorrect option.

Option C: Economies of scale are associated with the declining or decreasing portions of the ATC curve. Yes, that matches what I was just thinking. So C is correct.

Option D: Economies of scale result in decreases in per unit average cost. Yes, that's the definition. So D is correct.

So the question is asking which option is not correct. Based on this, option B is incorrect because it's talking about the increasing part of the ATC curve, which would actually be a situation where diseconomies of scale are happening, I think. So B is the wrong statement.

The question asks which statement about economies of scale is incorrect. Economies of scale occur when increased production leads to lower average costs, typically represented by the declining portion of the average total cost (ATC) curve. 

- **Option A** correctly states that economies of scale are tied to increased production.  
- **Option B** incorrectly associates economies of scale with the rising portion of the ATC curve, which actually reflects diseconomies of scale.  
- **Option C** correctly identifies that economies of scale occur during the declining part of the ATC curve.  
- **Option D** correctly notes that economies of scale reduce per-unit average costs.  

Thus, the incorrect statement is **Option B**. 

Answer: B
