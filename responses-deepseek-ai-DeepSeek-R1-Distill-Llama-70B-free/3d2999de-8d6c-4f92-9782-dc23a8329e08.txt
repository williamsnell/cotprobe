Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about dividing a line segment into two parts by selecting a point at random. I'm supposed to assign a probability to the event that the longer segment is at least two times longer than the shorter segment. The options are from A to J, each with a different fraction.

Hmm. Let's break this down. Imagine a line segment of a certain length, say length L. I'll pick a point somewhere along this line, which divides it into two parts. Let's call the length of the shorter part 'x' and the longer part 'y', so x + y = L. But since the point is chosen randomly, I think the selection is uniform along the line. So any position is equally likely.

Wait, but when it's random, the position could be anywhere between 0 and L. So I can model this by considering a uniform distribution between 0 and L. Let's say the point is at position 'p' along the segment, so p can range from 0 to L. Then one part is of length p, and the other is L - p.

Now, the condition is that the longer segment is at least twice as long as the shorter one. So, mathematically, this means the longer part ≥ 2 * shorter part.

Let me think about how to express this. Without loss of generality, let's assume p is the length of the shorter segment. That would mean p ≤ L/2 because if p were more than L/2, then p would be the longer segment. Wait, no, actually, the longer segment is max(p, L-p), and the shorter is min(p, L-p). So the condition is that max(p, L-p) ≥ 2 * min(p, L-p).

Let me formalize this. Let me denote s as the shorter segment and l as the longer. So l ≥ 2s.

Since s + l = L, substituting l = L - s (since l is the longer part), we get L - s ≥ 2s → L ≥ 3s → s ≤ L/3.

Wait, that's interesting. So the shorter segment must be ≤ L/3 for the longer segment to be at least twice as long.

But wait, let's double-check that. Suppose the shorter segment is s, then longer is l = L - s. The condition is l ≥ 2s → L - s ≥ 2s → L ≥ 3s → s ≤ L/3. Yes, that's correct.

So the shorter segment must be ≤ L/3. That means that the point p (where the segment is split) must be in a region where the shorter segment is ≤ L/3.

But wait, the point p can be anywhere from 0 to L. The value of p can be either the shorter or longer segment, depending on where it is. So when p is near 0, p is the shorter segment, and L-p is longer. When p is near L, L-p is small (shorter) and p is longer.

So the condition that the shorter segment is ≤ L/3 would occur in two regions: one near 0 and one near L.

Let me visualize this. The line from 0 to L. The point p is chosen uniformly. The regions where the shorter segment is ≤ L/3 are p ≤ L/3 (on the left) and p ≥ 2L/3 (on the right). Because in the first case, p is the shorter, and in the second case, L-p is the shorter.

Wait, no, if p is near L, say p = 2L/3, then L-p = L/3, which is the shorter. So for points p ≥ (2L/3), L-p ≤ L/3. Similarly, points p ≤ L/3, then p is the shorter.

So the regions where s ≤ L/3 are p ∈ [0, L/3] and p ∈ [2L/3, L]. Each of these intervals has length L/3, so together their length is 2L/3.

But wait, the total possible p is from 0 to L, so the length is L. So the probability is the favorable length divided by total length.

So favorable length is 2*(L/3) = 2L/3. So probability is (2L/3)/L = 2/3.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because when p is in [0, L/3], the shorter segment is p, and the longer is L-p. So the condition is L-p ≥ 2p → L ≥ 3p → p ≤ L/3, which is exactly where p is.

Similarly, when p is in [2L/3, L], the shorter segment is L-p, which must be ≤ L/3. So L-p ≤ L/3 → p ≥ 2L/3. So yes, the points p where the condition holds are p ∈ [0, L/3] and p ∈ [2L/3, L], each of length L/3, so together 2L/3.

So the probability is (2L/3)/L = 2/3. So the probability is 2/3, which is option E.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is to model the problem as picking a point along a unit length for simplicity. Let L = 1, so p is between 0 and 1.

The shorter segment is min(p, 1-p). The longer is max(p, 1-p). The condition is max(p, 1-p) ≥ 2 * min(p, 1-p).

So when is this true? Let's consider two cases: p ≤ 1/2 and p > 1/2.

Case 1: p ≤ 1/2. Then shorter is p, longer is 1-p.

Condition: 1-p ≥ 2p → 1 ≥ 3p → p ≤ 1/3.

So in this case, p must be in [0, 1/3].

Case 2: p > 1/2. Then shorter is 1-p, longer is p.

Condition: p ≥ 2*(1-p) → p ≥ 2 - 2p → 3p ≥ 2 → p ≥ 2/3.

So in this case, p must be in [2/3, 1].

So the total favorable range is [0, 1/3] and [2/3, 1], each of length 1/3, so total 2/3.

Thus, the probability is 2/3, which is option E.

So the answer should be E.

To solve the problem, consider a line segment of length \( L \). A point \( p \) is chosen randomly along the segment, dividing it into two parts: one of length \( p \) and the other of length \( L - p \). The condition is that the longer segment is at least twice as long as the shorter segment, i.e., \( \text{max}(p, L-p) \geq 2 \cdot \text{min}(p, L-p) \).

### Step 1: Define the shorter and longer segments
Let \( s = \text{min}(p, L-p) \) and \( l = \text{max}(p, L-p) \). The condition becomes \( l \geq 2s \). Since \( s + l = L \), substituting \( l = L - s \) into the condition gives:
\[
L - s \geq 2s \implies L \geq 3s \implies s \leq \frac{L}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the favorable regions for \( p \)
The shorter segment \( s \) is \( p \) when \( p \leq \frac{L}{2} \), and \( L-p \) when \( p > \frac{L}{2} \). For \( s \leq \frac{L}{3} \), there are two cases:
1. **Case 1: \( p \leq \frac{L}{2} \)**  
   Here, \( s = p \). The condition \( p \leq \frac{L}{3} \) implies \( p \in [0, \frac{L}{3}] \).

2. **Case 2: \( p > \frac{L}{2} \)**  
   Here, \( s = L - p \). The condition \( L - p \leq \frac{L}{3} \) implies \( p \geq \frac{2L}{3} \), or \( p \in [\frac{2L}{3}, L] \).

Thus, the favorable regions for \( p \) are \( [0, \frac{L}{3}] \) and \( [\frac{2L}{3}, L] \), each of length \( \frac{L}{3} \). Together, the total favorable length is:
\[
\frac{L}{3} + \frac{L}{3} = \frac{2L}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability
The total possible range for \( p \) is \( [0, L] \), so the probability is the ratio of the favorable length to the total length:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Favorable length}}{\text{Total length}} = \frac{\frac{2L}{3}}{L} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that the longer segment is at least two times longer than the shorter segment is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
