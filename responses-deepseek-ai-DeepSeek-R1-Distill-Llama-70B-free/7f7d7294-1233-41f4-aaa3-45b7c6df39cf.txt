Okay, so I've got this question about the strategies used by the Conservative government in 1979 to reduce the power of the labour movement. I need to figure out which option wasn't one of their strategies. The options are A through I, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that the Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher came into power in 1979. Their main goal was to reduce the influence of trade unions and the labour movement, which were quite strong at the time. They implemented various laws and policies to achieve this.

Looking at the options one by one:

Option A: Making secondary action illegal. Secondary action refers to when workers in one industry support another industry's strike, like sympathy strikes. I think the Thatcher government did make this illegal. There was a law, maybe the Employment Act 1980, which restricted such actions. So A was a strategy they used.

Option B: Enforcing mandatory arbitration in all labor disputes. Mandatory arbitration means that disputes must go through a third-party arbitration process, which can prevent strikes. I'm not sure if they enforced this for all disputes. I think they might have promoted arbitration but didn't make it mandatory across the board. Or maybe they did for certain sectors. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one.

Option C: Banning political strikes not related to workers' conditions. Political strikes are those about broader political issues rather than workplace issues. I believe the government restricted strikes to those directly related to employment terms. So C was something they did.

Option D: Imposing restrictions on picketing. Yes, the laws introduced restrictions on picketing, like limiting the number of picketers and requiring notice. So D was part of their strategy.

Option E: Implementing a national minimum wage. Wait, I think the minimum wage was actually introduced later, maybe by the Labour government in 1999. The Conservatives in '79 were more about reducing union power, not setting wage floors. So E might not have been their strategy.

Option F: Making all strike action illegal. No, that's too extreme. They didn't ban all strikes, just restricted when and how they could happen. So F wasn't done.

Option G: Outlawing collective bargaining. No, collective bargaining wasn't entirely outlawed. They might have weakened it but didn't eliminate it. So G is incorrect as a strategy.

Option H: Replacing labour movement with government worker councils. I don't remember this happening. Unions were weakened, but not replaced by councils. So H isn't right.

Option I: Privatizing all industries. They did privatize many state-owned industries, which reduced union power because these industries were often heavily unionized. So I was a strategy they used.

Now, the question is which one was NOT a strategy. So reviewing, E and F and G and H and maybe B are possibilities.

Wait, the question is about what was NOT used. So E is implementing a national minimum wage. If that was introduced by a later Labour government, then the Conservatives didn't do that. So E would be the correct answer.

Other options: B, mandatory arbitration. I think they introduced some measures that encouraged arbitration, but not making it mandatory in all disputes. Or maybe they did. Alternatively, perhaps B wasn't a strategy, but I'm not certain. But I'm more confident about E not being a strategy because minimum wage was a later policy.

So the answer should be E.

The Conservative government of 1979, led by Margaret Thatcher, implemented several strategies to reduce the power of the labour movement. These included making secondary action illegal (A), banning political strikes unrelated to workers' conditions (C), imposing restrictions on picketing (D), and privatizing industries (I). However, implementing a national minimum wage (E) was not a strategy used by this government. This policy was introduced later by the Labour government in 1999. 

Answer: E
