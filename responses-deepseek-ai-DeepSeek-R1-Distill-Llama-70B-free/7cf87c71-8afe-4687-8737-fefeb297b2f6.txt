Okay, so I have this problem about calorimetry and the heat released when substances burn. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that when 120 mg of naphthalene (C10H8) is burned, the temperature rises by 3.05 K. Now, I need to find out how much the temperature will rise when 10 mg of phenol (C6H5OH) is burned under the same conditions.

Wait, I remember that in a bomb calorimeter, the heat released by the reaction is absorbed by the surrounding water, raising its temperature. The key here is that the heat absorbed (q) is equal for both reactions, right? Oh wait, no, wait. No, because the calorimeter's heat capacity is the same in both cases, so the temperature change should relate to the heat released by each substance.

But wait, the problem probably assumes that the calorimeter's heat capacity is constant, so the same q will lead to the same ΔT. Or maybe the other way around. Oh wait, no, the calorimeter's heat capacity (C_cal) is C_cal = q / ΔT. So if two experiments are done with the same calorimeter, then their q's are related by the ΔT's.

Wait, but the issue here is that we're dealing with two different substances. So first, I think we need to find the heat released per gram for naphthalene, then find the heat released per gram for phenol, and then see how much temperature rise that would cause in the calorimeter.

Wait, but how is the heat released related to the temperature change? Oh right, the formula is q = C_cal * ΔT. So for each reaction, the heat released (q) is the calorimeter's heat capacity multiplied by the temperature change.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. The heat released by the combustion of the substance is absorbed by the calorimeter (assuming it's the surroundings), so q_reaction = -q_calorimeter. But since the calorimeter is absorbing heat, q_calorimeter is positive, and q_reaction is negative, meaning the reaction is exothermic.

So, for the first reaction (naphthalene), the heat released is q1 = m1 * ΔH_combustion (but I think I might need to use the molar heat of combustion here). Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of calorimeter heat capacity.

The calorimeter's heat capacity (C_cal) can be determined from the first experiment. Then, in the second experiment, using that C_cal, I can find the ΔT when a different mass of phenol is burned.

Wait, but I don't have the heat of combustion values for either substance. Hmm, the problem doesn't provide them, so maybe I need another approach.

Oh, wait a second. The problem says "under the same conditions," which probably means that the heat capacity of the calorimeter remains the same. So the key is that the heat released by burning a mass of a substance is proportional to the temperature change, assuming the calorimeter's heat capacity is constant.

Wait, but no, because different substances have different heats of combustion. So the heat released per gram would vary. So I can't directly compare based on mass alone. Hmm, so maybe I need the molar heat of combustion for both compounds?

Wait, but I don't have those values given. So perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the heat released is proportional to the mass of the substance burned, but that doesn't make sense because different substances release different amounts of heat per gram.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem doesn't give any thermodynamic data, like ΔH combustion values for naphthalene or phenol. So how am I supposed to calculate it? Maybe the problem expects me to find the relationship between the two based on the masses and the given temperature change, but that doesn't seem feasible without knowing the ΔH values.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is implying that the total heat released (q) is the same in both cases, but that doesn't make sense because different masses and different substances would release different amounts of heat.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the calorimeter's heat capacity. If I can calculate C_cal from the first experiment, then I can find the heat released in the second experiment and then find the ΔT.

Wait, but how? Because in the first case, the heat released by burning naphthalene is absorbed by the calorimeter, causing the temperature to rise. So C_cal = q1 / ΔT1.

But I don't know q1. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the heat released per mole is the same? No, that can't be right because naphthalene and phenol have different molar heats of combustion.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is saying that the same calorimeter is used, so the same C_cal applies. Then, the heat released in each case is q = m * ΔH_combustion. So q1 = m1 * ΔH1, and q2 = m2 * ΔH2.

But without knowing ΔH1 and ΔH2, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem is implying that the ratio of the heat released is proportional to the masses, but that's only true if ΔH is the same, which it isn't. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just testing the relation between mass and temperature change, assuming the same calorimeter. But that can't be right because different substances have different heats of combustion.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me see if I can find a way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the heat of combustion per gram is the same for both substances. But that's not correct, but maybe it's a simplification for the problem. If that's the case, then the heat released would be proportional to the mass burned. Then, the temperature change would be proportional to the heat released, so ΔT = q / C_cal.

So for the first case: q1 = m1 * (ΔH per gram of naphthalene) → ΔT1 = q1 / C_cal.

For the second case: q2 = m2 * (ΔH per gram of phenol) → ΔT2 = q2 / C_cal.

But without knowing the ΔH per gram for each, I can't compare. So perhaps the question is incomplete.

Wait, maybe the question is assuming that the moles are the same, but the masses are different. No, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the calorimeter's heat capacity. The heat released by the reaction is absorbed by the calorimeter, so q = C_cal * ΔT.

So, for naphthalene: q1 = C_cal * 3.05 K.

But q1 is also equal to the heat released by burning 120 mg of naphthalene. So q1 = m1 * ΔH_combustion (naphthalene, per gram).

Similarly, for phenol: q2 = m2 * ΔH_combustion (phenol, per gram) = C_cal * ΔT2.

But without knowing the values of ΔH_combustion for each, I can't find ΔT2.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that both substances release the same amount of heat per mole? No, that's not realistic. Or maybe that the heat released per gram is the same? That also doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the problem states that all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise, and data is for 298.15 K. But I don't see how that applies here.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting a proportion based on the masses, assuming that the heat per mole is the same. But that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate using moles.

Wait, perhaps I should find the moles of each substance and see if that helps. Let's try that.

Naphthalene is C10H8. Its molar mass is (10*12.01) + (8*1.008) = 120.1 + 8.064 = 128.164 g/mol.

The mass used was 120 mg, which is 0.120 g. So moles of naphthalene = 0.120 g / 128.164 g/mol ≈ 0.000937 moles.

Phenol is C6H5OH, which is C6H5OH → molar mass is (6*12.01) + (5*1.008) + (16.00 + 1.008) → 72.06 + 5.04 + 17.008 ≈ 94.108 g/mol.

Mass of phenol is 10 mg = 0.010 g. Moles of phenol = 0.010 g / 94.108 g/mol ≈ 0.0001063 moles.

Wait, but without the ΔH combustion per mole, I can't proceed. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the heat released is proportional to the mass, which would be incorrect, but maybe that's what is intended.

So for naphthalene, 120 mg caused a 3.05 K rise. So 120 mg → 3.05 K.

What's the ratio of phenol's mass to naphthalene's mass? 10 mg / 120 mg = 1/12.

But if the heat released is proportional to mass (which it's not, but just for calculation's sake), then the temperature rise would be 3.05 K * (1/12) ≈ 0.254 K. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the options are way higher. So that approach must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the heat capacities. Wait, no, the calorimeter's heat capacity is the same in both cases. So the heat released (q) is C_cal * ΔT.

Wait, but the heat released in each case is different because the substances and masses are different. So, for naphthalene, q1 = m1 * ΔH1.

For phenol, q2 = m2 * ΔH2.

But since C_cal is the same, then q1/C_cal = ΔT1 and q2/C_cal = ΔT2.

So, (m1 * ΔH1) / C_cal = 3.05 K.

Similarly, (m2 * ΔH2) / C_cal = ΔT2.

But without knowing ΔH1 and ΔH2, I can't find ΔT2. So perhaps the problem is implying that the substances have the same ΔH per mole? If that's the case, then the heat released would be proportional to moles, not mass.

Wait, let's proceed with that assumption, even though it's incorrect in reality, perhaps it's what the problem expects.

So, moles naphthalene = 0.120 g / 128.164 g/mol ≈ 0.000937 mol.

Moles phenol = 0.010 g / 94.108 g/mol ≈ 0.0001063 mol.

If ΔH per mole is the same for both, then the heat released would be proportional to the moles.

So, the ratio of heat released would be moles_phenol / moles_naphthalene.

Which is 0.0001063 / 0.000937 ≈ 0.1135.

So, the temperature change for phenol would be 3.05 K * 0.1135 ≈ 0.346 K. But that's not an option either.

Hmm, this approach is not giving me any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about the same molar amount. But the masses are different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the same mass, but that's not what's happening here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is simply expecting me to use the ratio of the masses, assuming that the heat released per gram is the same, which as I thought earlier, is incorrect but perhaps intended.

So, 120 mg naphthalene → 3.05 K rise.

10 mg phenol is 1/12th the mass of naphthalene.

So, if the heat released is proportional to mass (which it's not, but for the sake of calculation), then the temperature change would be 3.05 K * (10/120) = 3.05 * (1/12) ≈ 0.254 K. But none of the options match this.

Wait, but looking at the options, the smallest is J:25.5 K. Hmm, that's much larger than 0.254. So maybe I'm way off.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the ratio. Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the calorimeter's heat capacity is determined from the first experiment, and then used to find the second.

Wait, but how? Because to find C_cal, I need q, which is m*ΔH, which I don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the heat of combustion for naphthalene, and I'm supposed to look it up, but the problem doesn't give any data.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the heat of combustion of naphthalene is around 51550 J/g (I'm not sure, but let me think). Wait, no, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps it's about 40 kJ/g? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is testing the understanding that the temperature change is proportional to the heat released, which is proportional to the mass times the heat of combustion per gram.

But without knowing the heat of combustion per gram of each substance, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to assume that the heat released per gram is the same for both substances, which would be incorrect, but perhaps for the sake of the problem.

So, if that's the case, then the heat released by naphthalene is q1 = 120 mg * (ΔH per gram), and the heat released by phenol is q2 = 10 mg * (ΔH per gram).

Then, since q = C_cal * ΔT, we can set up the ratio:

q1 / q2 = (C_cal * ΔT1) / (C_cal * ΔT2) ) = ΔT1 / ΔT2 = q1/q2.

Since q1/q2 = (120 mg)/(10 mg) = 12.

So, ΔT1 / ΔT2 = 12 → 3.05 K / ΔT2 = 12 → ΔT2 = 3.05 /12 ≈ 0.254 K.

But again, this isn't any of the options, so perhaps the assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps instead of assuming the same ΔH per gram, the problem expects me to use the same ΔH per mole. So, in that case, the heat released would be proportional to the number of moles.

So, for naphthalene, moles = 120 mg / molar mass.

Molar mass of naphthalene: C10H8 → 10*12.01 + 8*1.008 = 120.1 + 8.064 = 128.164 g/mol.

Moles = 0.120 g / 128.164 g/mol ≈ 0.000937 mol.

Phenol's molar mass: C6H5OH → 6*12.01 + 5*1.008 + 16.00 + 1.008 = 72.06 + 5.04 + 17.008 = 94.108 g/mol.

Moles phenol = 0.010 g / 94.108 g/mol ≈ 0.0001063 mol.

If ΔH per mole is the same for both, then the heat released would be proportional to moles.

So, q1 = n1 * ΔH, q2 = n2 * ΔH.

q1/q2 = n1/n2 = 0.000937 / 0.0001063 ≈ 8.81.

So, q1 = 8.81 * q2.

Since q = C_cal * ΔT, then:

q1 = C_cal * 3.05 → 8.81 q2 = C_cal * 3.05.

But q2 = C_cal * ΔT2 → substituting:

8.81 * (C_cal * ΔT2) ) = C_cal * 3.05 → 8.81 ΔT2 = 3.05 → ΔT2 ≈ 3.05 /8.81 ≈ 0.346 K.

Again, not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering moles, but I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the ratio based on the molecular formulas. Naphthalene is C10H8, phenol is C6H5OH. Maybe the heat of combustion relates to the number of carbons or hydrogens.

Wait, combustion reactions release heat based on the amount of CO2 and H2O formed. So, perhaps I can write the combustion reactions and calculate the moles of O2 used, then find the heat based on that. But that seems complicated without knowing the exact ΔH values.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat of combustion per mole is approximately proportional to the molecular weight. But that's a rough approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know the standard enthalpy of combustion for both substances. For example, the standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH°c) for naphthalene is about -5157 kJ/mol, and for phenol, it's about -3053 kJ/mol. But I'm not sure of the exact values, so this is risky.

Wait, let me try with these hypothetical values.

ΔH°c (naphthalene) = -5157 kJ/mol → per gram, it's 5157 kJ/mol / 128.164 g/mol ≈ 40.22 kJ/g.

ΔH°c (phenol) = -3053 kJ/mol → per gram, 3053 /94.108 ≈ 32.43 kJ/g.

So, for naphthalene, q1 = 0.120 g * 40.22 kJ/g = 4.826 kJ.

This heat is absorbed by the calorimeter, so q1 = C_cal * ΔT1 → 4.826 kJ = C_cal * 3.05 K → C_cal = 4.826 /3.05 ≈ 1.581 kJ/K.

Now, for phenol: mass = 0.010 g. So q2 = 0.010 g * 32.43 kJ/g = 0.3243 kJ.

Then, ΔT2 = q2 / C_cal = 0.3243 /
