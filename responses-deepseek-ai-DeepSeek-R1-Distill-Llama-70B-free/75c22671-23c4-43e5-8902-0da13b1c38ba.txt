Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a delivery truck that uses a flywheel for energy storage. Hmm, I remember flywheels store energy as rotational kinetic energy. The question is asking how long the truck can operate before needing to recharge. The flywheel is a solid homogeneous cylinder, which probably means I can use the standard moment of inertia formula for a solid cylinder.

Let me jot down the given data. The flywheel's weight is 1120 lb, and its diameter is 6 feet. Oh wait, I think weight in pounds can be converted to mass in kilograms because I'll need that for the moment of inertia. Wait, but maybe I can work in the English system since the power is given in horsepower. Hmm, but rotational energy formulas typically use SI units, so maybe I should convert everything to kilograms and meters.

Wait, the flywheel is charged up to 6000 revolutions per minute. I need to find its rotational kinetic energy. Then, with the power requirement of the truck, I can find the time it can run by dividing the energy by the power.

So steps:
1. Convert the flywheel's weight to mass.
2. Find the radius from the diameter.
3. Calculate the moment of inertia for a solid cylinder.
4. Convert 6000 rpm to radians per second to get angular velocity.
5. Compute the rotational kinetic energy (KE = ½ I ω²).
6. Convert the truck's power from horsepower to watts or equivalent.
7. Divide the KE by the power to get time in seconds, then convert to minutes.

Wait, let's get started.

First, weight is 1120 lb. Weight in pounds is a force, so to get mass in kg, I can use the conversion factor. I know that 1 pound-force is approximately 0.453592 kg·m/s². But wait, weight W = m * g, so m = W / g. But since the weight is in lb, I can convert lb to kg by dividing by the conversion factor. Oh wait, maybe I should use lb-mass instead. Wait, no, lb is a unit of force, so to get mass in kg, I need to divide by g in lb units.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. In the English system, weight W (lb) equals mass (lb) multiplied by g (32.174 ft/s²). So mass m = W / g. But wait, lb is a unit of force, so in the English system, weight W = m (in slugs) * g (ft/s²). So to convert lb (force) to mass in slugs, m = W / g. Then, to get kg, I have to convert slugs to kg. Oh wait, 1 slug is approximately 32.174 lb·s²/ft. Wait, this is getting messy. Maybe it's easier to convert weight (lb) to kg directly. Because 1 kg is about 2.20462 lb. So if I have 1120 lb, then mass m = 1120 / 2.20462 ≈ 508 kg. Wait, that makes sense. So I'll take m as approximately 508 kg.

Wait, but wait a second. The flywheel is a solid cylinder, so its moment of inertia I is (1/2) m r². So I need the radius. The diameter is 6 ft, so radius is 3 ft. I need to convert that to meters. 3 ft is 0.9144 meters. So radius r = 0.9144 m.

Next, the angular velocity ω. It's given as 6000 rpm. To convert to radians per second, I multiply by 2π/60. So ω = 6000 * (2π) / 60 = 6000 * π / 30 = 200π radians per second. Approximately 628.3185 rad/s.

Now, compute the moment of inertia I = 0.5 * m * r². Plugging in m ≈ 508 kg, r ≈ 0.9144 m.

I = 0.5 * 508 * (0.9144)^2. Let's calculate that step by step.

First, (0.9144)^2 = approx 0.8356 m².

So I = 0.5 * 508 * 0.8356.

Calculate 508 * 0.8356 first. 508 * 0.8 is 406.4, 508 * 0.0356 ≈ 18.09. So total ≈ 424.49 kg·m². Then multiply by 0.5: I ≈ 212.245 kg·m².

Now, rotational kinetic energy KE is (1/2) I ω².

So ω is 200π, so ω² is (200π)^2 = 40000 * π².

So KE = 0.5 * 212.245 * 40000 * π².

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 40000 * π². Pi squared is about 9.8696. So 40000 * 9.8696 ≈ 395,484.

Then 0.5 * 212.245 = 106.1225.

So KE ≈ 106.1225 * 395,484.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me compute 106.1225 * 395,484.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, let's compute 212.245 * 40000 = 8,489,800 (since 212.245 * 4e4 = 8,489,800). Then multiply by pi squared (approx 9.8696), and then multiply by 0.5.

Wait, no, the equation is (1/2) * I * ω². So I think the correct order is:

KE = 0.5 * I * (ω)^2.

So I have I = 212.245 kg·m², ω^2 = (200π)^2 = 40000 * π².

So KE = 0.5 * 212.245 * 40000 * π².

So 0.5 * 212.245 = 106.1225.

Then, 106.1225 * 40000 = 4,248,900.

Then multiply by π² (approx 9.8696): 4,248,900 * 9.8696 ≈ let's see.

4,248,900 * 9 = 38,230,100.

4,248,900 * 0.8696 ≈ let's compute 4,248,900 * 0.8 = 3,399,120.

4,248,900 * 0.0696 ≈ approx 295,877.

So 3,399,120 + 295,877 = 3,695, 0, wait, 3,399,120 + 295,877 is 3,694,997.

So total KE ≈ 38,230,100 + 3,694,997 = 41,925,097 joules. Approximately 4.1925e7 J.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me proceed.

Now, the truck's average power requirement is 10 hp. I need to convert that to watts because power is in watts. 1 hp is 745.7 W, so 10 hp is 7457 W.

Wait, but wait, the KE is the energy available, and power is energy per time. So time t = KE / power.

So t = 4.1925e7 J / 7457 W ≈ let's compute this.

Divide 41,925,097 by 7457.

Let me compute 7457 * 5,000 = 37,285,000.

Subtract that from 41,925,097: 41,925,097 -37,285,000 =4,640,097.

7457 * 600 = 4,474,200.

Subtract: 4,640,097 -4,474,200= 165,897.

7457 * 22 = approx 164,054.

So 5,000 + 600 +22 =5,622 seconds. And there's 1,843 left, which is negligible for approximation.

So 5,622 seconds. Now, converting to minutes: 5,622 /60 ≈93.7 minutes. Hmm, but looking at the options, option H is 94.2 min. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but I think I might have made a calculation mistake earlier. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, when I calculated I, the moment of inertia. m is 508 kg? Wait, 1120 lb divided by 2.20462 lb/kg is 508 kg yes. Radius 3 ft is 0.9144 m correct.

I = 0.5 * m r². So 0.5 * 508 kg * (0.9144)^2 m².

Yes, (0.9144)^2 is around 0.835. So 508 * 0.835 = 424. So I is 212 kg·m² correct.

ω = 6000 rpm. ω in rad/s is 6000 * 2π /60 = 200π rad/s correct.

So KE = 0.5 * 212 * (200π)^2.

Yes, (200π)^2 = 40000 π².

So KE = 0.5 * 212 *40000 * π².

Wait, 0.5 *212 =106, 106 *40000 =4,240,000. Then multiply by π² (~9.8696):

4,240,000 *9.8696 = let's compute 4e6 *9.8696 = 39,478,400. 240,000 *9.8696 = approx 2,368, 640. So total about 41,847,040 J.

Wait, I think I approximated it as 4.1925e7 earlier, which is the same as 41,847,000 J.

Then, power is 10 hp =7457 W.

Time t = 41,847,040 /7457 ≈ let me compute this more accurately.

Calculate 41,847,040 ÷7457.

Well, 7457 *5000=37,285,000. Subtract from 41,847,040: 4,562,040 left.

7457 *600=4,474,200. Subtract: 4,562,040-4,474,200=87,840 left.

7457 *11=82,027. Subtract: 87,840-82,027=5,813.

So total is 5000+600+11=5611 seconds, with about 5,813/7457 ≈0.78 seconds.

So total time is approximately 5611.78 seconds.

Convert to minutes: 5611.78 /60 ≈93.5296 minutes, approximately 93.53 minutes.

Looking at the options, H is 94.2 min, which is very close. So the answer is H.

Wait, but maybe I made an error in the weight to mass conversion. Let's double-check that.

Weight is 1120 lb. So mass m = weight / g. But wait, in the English system, weight (lb) = mass (slugs) * g (ft/s²). So m = W / g.

g is 32.174 ft/s². So m = 1120 lb /32.174 lb·s²/(ft·slug) → slugs.

Wait, that's the mass in slugs. Then to convert to kg, since 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft / g, but perhaps it's better to convert slugs to kg.

Wait, another approach: 1 slug = 14.5939 kg. Because 1 slug is the mass that accelerates 1 foot per second squared when a pound of force is applied. So m = 1120 lb /32.174 ft/s² = 34.814 slugs. Then 34.814 slugs *14.5939 kg/slug ≈ 508 kg. So same as before.

So mass is correct. Therefore, my earlier calculation should be correct, leading to approximately 93.5 minutes, which is closest to option H:94.2 min. So I would choose H.

To determine how long the truck can operate before needing to recharge, we analyze the energy stored in the flywheel and the power required by the truck. The flywheel is a solid homogeneous cylinder with a weight of 1120 lb and a diameter of 6 ft. It is "charged" to a top speed of 6000 revolutions per minute (rpm). The truck's average power requirement is 10 horsepower (hp).

### Key Steps:
1. **Convert weight to mass**:  
   Weight in pounds (lb) is a force, so mass \( m \) is calculated using \( m = \frac{\text{weight}}{g} \), where \( g \) is the gravitational acceleration. Converting 1120 lb to kg:  
   \[
   m = \frac{1120}{2.20462} \approx 508 \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Find the radius**:  
   The diameter is 6 ft, so the radius is \( r = 3 \, \text{ft} = 0.9144 \, \text{m} \).

3. **Moment of inertia**:  
   For a solid cylinder, the moment of inertia is:  
   \[
   I = \frac{1}{2} m r^2 = \frac{1}{2} (508) (0.9144)^2 \approx 212.245 \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

4. **Angular velocity**:  
   Convert 6000 rpm to radians per second:  
   \[
   \omega = 6000 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{60} = 200\pi \, \text{rad/s} \approx 628.32 \, \text{rad/s}.
   \]

5. **Rotational kinetic energy**:  
   The energy stored in the flywheel is:  
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} (212.245) (200\pi)^2.
   \]  
   Expanding \( (200\pi)^2 = 40000\pi^2 \), where \( \pi^2 \approx 9.8696 \):  
   \[
   KE = 0.5 \cdot 212.245 \cdot 40000 \cdot 9.8696 \approx 41,925,097 \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Convert power to watts**:  
   The truck's power requirement is 10 hp. Since \( 1 \, \text{hp} = 745.7 \, \text{W} \):  
   \[
   P = 10 \cdot 745.7 = 7457 \, \text{W}.
   \]

7. **Calculate operating time**:  
   The time the truck can operate is the energy divided by the power:  
   \[
   t = \frac{KE}{P} = \frac{41,925,097}{7457} \approx 5611.78 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]  
   Convert to minutes:  
   \[
   t = \frac{5611.78}{60} \approx 93.53 \, \text{minutes}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated time is **94.2 minutes**, which corresponds to **option H**.
