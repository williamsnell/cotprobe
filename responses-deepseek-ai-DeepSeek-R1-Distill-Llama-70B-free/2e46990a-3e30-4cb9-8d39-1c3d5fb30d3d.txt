Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the horsepower transmitted by a shaft. Hmm, the question gives me some parameters, and I need to compute the horsepower. Let me think about what I remember from my mechanics classes.

Alright, the shaft is rotating at 1100 rpm, and there's a force of 120 lbs along the axis. It's a multiple disc clutch with 12 steel and 10 brass discs. The outer and inner diameters are 10 inches and 8 inches, respectively. The coefficient of friction is 0.30.

Wait, multiple disc clutches... Right, the torque in such systems depends on the number of friction surfaces and the clamping force. Also, each pair of discs contributes to the torque. So I think each pair consists of a steel disc and a brass disc, but wait, actually, in a multiple disc clutch, each pair is a driving and driven disc. So the number of friction surfaces might be the sum of all possible contact areas between the discs.

Let me clarify: if there are 12 steel discs and 10 brass discs, how does that work? Oh wait, I think each steel disc alternates with a brass disc, but maybe the total number of pairs is different. Wait, no, the steel and brass are the two materials in contact. So the number of frictional surfaces is the number of pairs times 2, because each pair has two surfaces. Or wait, maybe the number of contact surfaces is the number of discs minus one if they're stacked alternately. Hmm, I might need to think differently.

Wait, no, for a multiple disc clutch, the number of friction interfaces is equal to the number of pairs of discs. So if there are N pairs, each contributing two frictional surfaces (like top and bottom?), but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, I remember that for multiple disc clutches, the torque is calculated based on the number of friction interfaces. Each pair of adjacent discs contributes two frictional surfaces. So if you have, say, 3 driving discs and 3 driven discs, arranged alternately, you have 5 interfaces? Or maybe 6? Wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, the number of frictional surfaces is equal to twice the number of pairs. Because each pair (steel and brass) has two surfaces in contact. So if there are 12 steel and 10 brass discs, that would mean... Let's see, the minimum of the two counts is 10, so maybe 10 pairs? Or perhaps the number of frictional surfaces is based on the number of discs. Wait, perhaps I should look at it as each steel disc is sandwiched between two brass discs, except the first and last. So the number of friction interfaces is (number of steel discs + number of brass discs - 1) * 2? Or maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the number of friction surfaces is the number of pairs multiplied by 2. Wait, perhaps each disc pair contributes two surfaces because each has an inner and outer face? Or each disc pair contributes one interface, but each interface has two sides, but since it's the same for both, perhaps it's just the number of interfaces.

Wait, no, maybe I should approach it differently. The torque in a disc clutch is given by the formula:

Torque (T) = (Number of friction surfaces) × (coefficient of friction) × (force) × mean radius

But wait, each friction surface is at a certain radius. So perhaps the mean radius is the average of the outer and inner radii for each disc.

Wait, the outer diameter is 10 inches, so outer radius is 5 inches. Inner diameter is 8 inches, so inner radius is 4 inches. So the mean radius for each disc would be (5 + 4)/2 = 4.5 inches. But wait, each disc has an outer and inner radius, but in a multiple disc setup, each additional disc is smaller than the previous? Or wait, no, all discs have the same inner and outer diameters? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the radius used is the mean of the outer and inner radii for each disc, so (10/2 + 8/2)/2 = (5 +4)/2 = 4.5 inches. So each frictional surface is at this mean radius.

Now, the number of frictional surfaces: for a multiple disc clutch, the number of friction surfaces is twice the number of discs. Wait, no. Wait, each pair of discs (say, a steel and a brass) contributes two surfaces? Or each disc contributes one surface, but since it's a clutch with multiple pairs, the number is higher.

Wait, another approach: the torque for a multiple disc clutch is given by T = μ * F * (R + r) * n, where n is the number of friction surfaces, and (R + r) is the sum of outer and inner radii, but wait, that might not be exactly right.

Wait, I think the formula is:

Torque T = (μ * F * n * (R² - r²)) / (2 * (R + r)) )

Wait, no, that's the formula for the axial force required in a conical clutch, maybe. Hmm, perhaps I should recall the correct formula for multiple disc clutches.

Wait, for a multiple disc clutch, the torque is T = μ * W * (R1 + R2) * N, where N is the number of frictional surfaces. Or maybe μ * W * (R1² - R2²) * N, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I think the torque for each disc is μ * F * r, where r is the radius at which the force is applied. But for a disc with inner radius r_i and outer radius r_o, the effective radius (mean radius) is (r_i + r_o)/2. So each disc contributes μ * F * (r_i + r_o)/2. And since each pair of discs (steel and brass) contributes two such surfaces, the total torque is μ * F * (r_i + r_o)/2 * number_of_surfaces.

Wait, perhaps the number of frictional surfaces is the number of pairs times 2. For example, if you have 12 steel and 10 brass discs, the number of pairs would be 10, because each steel must pair with a brass. So 10 pairs, each contributing two surfaces (since each pair has two sides, perhaps?), leading to 20 frictional surfaces.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let's think: each steel disc is in contact with two brass discs, except the end ones. So the number of frictional surfaces is (number of steel + number of brass) - 1, multiplied by 2? Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of frictional surfaces is the number of discs multiplied by 2, but that doesn't make sense because that would give 22*2=44, but that's probably too high.

Wait, perhaps the number of frictional surfaces is the number of pairs of discs. So if there are 12 steel and 10 brass discs, the number of pairs is 10, since the brass discs are fewer. Each pair would contribute two frictional surfaces, so number_of_surfaces = 10 * 2 = 20.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe I should look for another way. Another approach: in a multiple disc clutch, the number of frictional surfaces is twice the number of discs, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, for each pair of steel and brass discs, there are two surfaces in contact, so the number of surfaces is 2 per pair. So if there are 10 pairs, it's 20 surfaces.

Wait, another approach: the torque for a single plate clutch is T = μ * F * (R_mean), where R_mean is (R + r)/2. For multiple discs, each additional pair of discs adds another 2 * μ * F * R_mean. So for 12 steel and 10 brass discs, how many pairs are there? It should be 10 pairs, because you can't have more pairs than the smaller number of discs. So each pair contributes 2 frictional surfaces, so number_of_surfaces = 10 * 2 = 20.

Wait, but another thought: maybe each steel disc is paired with a brass disc, so if there are 12 steel and 10 brass, the number of pairs is 10, as each brass can pair with a steel, leaving 2 steel discs unpaired. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because you can't have a lone disc without a pair. Maybe the number of pairs is 10, giving 10 pairs of steel-brass, and 2 steel discs without a brass pair? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the number of pairs is 10, as there are 10 brass discs, each paired with a steel, leaving 2 steel discs unused, which isn't practical. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of pairs is determined by the number of discs, not the count per material. So if there are 12 steel and 10 brass, the total number of discs is 22. But then how are they arranged? Maybe the number of frictional surfaces is (number of discs - 1) * 2? That would be 21 * 2 = 42. But that seems high.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward with the assumption that the number of frictional surfaces is 2*(number of pairs). Let's say number of pairs is (n), so n = number of pairs. But how to find n? Alternatively, perhaps the number of frictional surfaces is (number of steel discs + number of brass discs - 1)*2. Hmm, 12 +10 -1 =21, times 2 is 42. That could be possible.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think of an example. If there are 2 steel and 2 brass discs, how many frictional surfaces are there?

In that case, the arrangement would be steel, brass, steel, brass. So each steel is between two brass, except the ends. So the number of frictional interfaces is 3: between steel 1 and brass 1, brass 1 and steel 2, steel 2 and brass 2. So 3 interfaces, each contributing two surfaces (each side of the disc), so total 6 surfaces. So for n pairs, it's (n+1) interfaces, each with two surfaces, so 2*(n+1) surfaces.

Wait, in the 2 steel and 2 brass case, n (number of pairs) would be 2, giving 2*(2+1) =6 surfaces. Which matches the example. So back to the problem: 12 steel and 10 brass discs. The number of pairs is 10, because the brass discs are fewer. So the number of interfaces is 10 +1 =11, each contributing two surfaces, so 22 surfaces.

Wait, no, in the 2 steel and 2 brass case, n_pairs is 2, but the number of interfaces is 3, which is n_pairs +1. So the number of friction surfaces would be 2*(n_pairs +1). In that case, for 10 pairs, it would be 2*(10+1)=22 surfaces. So the number of frictional surfaces is 22.

So now, each surface has an area, but perhaps more importantly, each contributes to the torque. So the torque T would be the sum of each surface's contribution.

Each surface's torque contribution is μ * F * r, where r is the mean radius for that surface. Wait, but all the surfaces have the same mean radius, assuming all discs have the same inner and outer diameters. So for each frictional surface, the torque contribution is μ * F * r_mean.

But wait, F is the axial force applied. In a multiple disc clutch, the same axial force F is applied across all the discs, so each disc carries a part of the total F. Or wait, no, in a multiple disc clutch, the total axial force F is the same across all the friction surfaces. So each surface has the same F acting on it.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each surface is in series, so the same F applies to each. So for each of the 22 surfaces, the torque is μ * F * r_mean. So total torque is 22 * μ * F * r_mean.

Wait, but that seems too much. Alternatively, maybe the torque is calculated per surface, and the total is the sum.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should find a formula. Let me try to recall. The torque for a multiple disc clutch is given by T = (μ * W * (R² - r²) * n) / (2 * (R + r))), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps the torque is T = μ * W * (R + r)/2 * N, where N is the number of frictional surfaces.

Wait, another approach. For a single disc, the torque is T = μ * F * (R² - r²)/(2r), but perhaps that's for a conical clutch. Hmm, getting myself more confused.

Wait, perhaps for a flat disc, the torque is T = μ * F * r_mean * number_of_surfaces, where r_mean is (R + r)/2, and number_of_surfaces is the number of frictional surfaces. So in this case, r_mean is (10/2 +8/2)/2 = (5 +4)/2=4.5 inches.

But wait, 10 inches is the outer diameter, so radius R is 5 inches. Inner diameter 8 inches, radius r is 4 inches. So mean radius is (5 +4)/2=4.5 inches.

So torque T = μ * F * r_mean * number_of_surfaces.

Now, μ is 0.3, F is 120 lbs, r_mean is 4.5 inches, number_of_surfaces is 22.

So T = 0.3 * 120 * 4.5 * 22.

Wait, let me compute that:

0.3 * 120 = 36.

36 *4.5 = 162.

162 *22 = let's compute 162 *20=3240, 162*2=324, total 3564.

So T=3564 inch-lbs.

But wait, the units. Torque is in inch-pounds, but we need to convert that to horsepower.

Horsepower is calculated using the formula:

HP = (Torque * RPM) / (5252)

But wait, torque needs to be in ft-lbs. So I need to convert the torque from inch-lbs to ft-lbs.

3564 inch-lbs divided by 12 is 297 ft-lbs.

So HP = (297 ft-lbs * 1100 RPM) / 5252.

Let me compute that:

297 * 1100 = 326700.

326700 / 5252 ≈ let's compute.

First, 5252 * 60 = 315120.

326700 - 315120 = 11580.

Now, 5252 * 2 = 10504, which is less than 11580.

So 60 + 2 = 62, remainder 11580 -10504=1076.

5252 * 0.2=1050.4, so 62.2 gives 5252*0.2=1050.4, so 1076-1050.4=25.6.

So approximately 62.2 HP.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E:50.25, or option I:65.42, or option J:55.17. Hmm, none of these are exactly 62.2. But I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the number of frictional surfaces is not 22. Maybe I overcounted.

Let me re-examine that part. The problem states 12 steel and 10 brass discs. So the number of frictional surfaces is 2*(12 +10 -1) = 2*21=42? Because each additional disc beyond the first adds two new surfaces.

Wait, in the earlier example with 2 steel and 2 brass discs, the number of surfaces was 6, which would be 2*(2+2 -1)=6. So yes, perhaps the formula is 2*(n_steel +n_brass -1). So for 12 steel and 10 brass, it's 2*(12+10 -1)=2*(21)=42.

So number_of_surfaces=42.

So then, let's recalculate.

Torque T = μ * F * r_mean * n_surfaces.

r_mean=4.5 inches.

T=0.3 *120 *4.5 *42.

Compute step by step:

0.3 *120=36.

36 *4.5=162.

162 *42= 162*40=6480, 162*2=324 → total 6804 inch-lbs.

Convert to ft-lbs: 6804 /12=567 ft-lbs.

Then HP= (567 *1100)/5252.

Compute 567 *1100: 567*1000=567000, 567*100=56700 → total 623700.

623700 /5252 ≈ let's compute.

5252 * 118 = 5252*100=525200, 5252*18=94,536 → total 525200+94536=619,736.

623700-619,736=3,964.

5252 * 0.75= about 3939.

So 118.75 → 5252 *0.75=3939, so 5252*118.75=619,736 +3939=623,675.

623,700 is 623,675 +25, so about 118.75 + (25/5252) ≈ 118.76.

So HP≈118.76.

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm. Maybe the approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for torque in multiple disc clutches is T= μ * W * (R² - r²) * n / (2r). Or perhaps T= μ * W * (R + r)/2 * n, where n is the number of frictional surfaces.

Wait, another formula I found online says that for a multiple disc clutch, the torque is T = (μ * W * n * (Do² - Di²)) / (4 * (Do + Di)), where n is the number of frictional surfaces.

Wait, let me try that. Do is outer diameter (10 in), Di is inner diameter (8 in), W is axial force (120 lbs), μ=0.3, n=number of frictional surfaces.

So T = (0.3 * 120 * n * (10² -8²)) / (4*(10+8)).

Compute numerator: 0.3 *120=36. 10²-
