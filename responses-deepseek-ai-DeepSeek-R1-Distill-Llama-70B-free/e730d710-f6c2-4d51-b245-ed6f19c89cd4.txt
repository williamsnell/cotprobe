Okay, so I've got this problem here about GNP and price indexes. Hmm, I need to find the current price index. Let me think about what I remember from my economics class.

Alright, the base year's GNP is $1000 billion. Since then, money GNP has increased by $500 billion. Wait, money GNP is the nominal GNP, right? So nominal GNP would be the base year's GNP plus the increase. Let me calculate that.

Base year nominal GNP is $1000 billion. It increased by $500, so current nominal GNP is 1000 + 500 = $1500 billion. Got that.

Now, the real GNP has increased by $250 billion. Oh wait, real GNP is in constant dollars, so it's adjusted for inflation. So the real GNP in the current year would be the base year's real GNP (which is the same as nominal in base year) plus 250. So 1000 + 250 = $1250 billion. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the base year's real GNP is $1000. Since then, real GNP has increased by $250, so current real GNP is 1000 + 250 = 1250 billion. Got it.

Now, the price index is calculated using the formula: nominal GNP = real GNP × price index. The price index in the base year is 100, right? So in the current year, the formula would be:

Nominal GNP = Real GNP × (Price Index / 100)

We can rearrange this to solve for the Price Index. So:

Price Index = (Nominal GNP / Real GNP) × 100

Plugging in the numbers I have:

Nominal is 1500, real is 1250. So:

1500 / 1250 = 1.2 → 1.2 × 100 = 120.

So the price index is 120. Let me check the options. Option E is 120. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the increase in nominal GNP is $500, which is from 1000 to 1500. Real increased by 250, from 1000 to 1250. So the price index is (1500/1250)*100 = 120. Yep, that's correct. So I'm confident the answer is E.

To determine the current price index, we start by calculating the current nominal and real GNP. The base year nominal GNP is $1000 billion, and since then, nominal GNP has increased by $500 billion, making the current nominal GNP:

\[
\text{Nominal GNP} = 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ billion.}
\]

Similarly, the base year real GNP is also $1000 billion (since real and nominal GNP are the same in the base year). Real GNP has increased by $250 billion, so the current real GNP is:

\[
\text{Real GNP} = 1000 + 250 = 1250 \text{ billion.}
\]

The price index is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Price Index} = \left(\frac{\text{Nominal GNP}}{\text{Real GNP}}\right) \times 100.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Price Index} = \left(\frac{1500}{1250}\right) \times 100 = 1.2 \times 100 = 120.
\]

Thus, the current price index is 120. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

E: 120
