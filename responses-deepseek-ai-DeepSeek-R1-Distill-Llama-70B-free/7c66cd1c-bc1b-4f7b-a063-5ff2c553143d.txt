Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem about α-thalassemia. Hmm, let me start by remembering what I know about thalassemia. I think α-thalassemia is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin production, specifically the α-globin chains. People can have different numbers of gene deletions, which affects the severity.

The couple comes in for counseling. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin and a single gene deletion. Wait, how many α-globin genes do we have? Oh right, each person has four α-globin genes—two on each chromosome 16, one from each parent.

So, if the woman has a single gene deletion, that means she has three functioning genes. Because normally, you have four, and one is missing. But wait, how does that affect her? Oh right, if you're missing one gene (like being αα-), you might be a carrier but usually don't have severe symptoms. Maybe that's why her hemoglobin is only minimally decreased.

The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion. Microcytic anemia is when the red blood cells are smaller than normal, which is common in thalassemia. Now, two-gene deletion can mean different things. If both deletions are on the same chromosome (cis), like both on the maternal chromosome, then he might have α--/α--, but wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, each chromosome has two α-globin genes. So if he's missing two, they can be in cis (both on one chromosome, meaning one chromosome has no α genes, and the other has two) or in trans (each chromosome missing one gene).

Wait, the question says the man has a two-gene deletion in trans. So one deletion on the maternal gene and one on paternal. So his genotype would be α-/α-. Because each of his chromosomes has one deletion. So for each chromosome, he has one α gene missing. So each parent passed him an α- (since each has a deletion on one of the two genes).

Wait, let me clarify. The woman has a single deletion, so her genotype is probably αα-/? Hmm, wait, each parent contributes one chromosome. So for the woman: she has a single gene deletion. So her genotype would be αα- / something. Wait, no—each of her two chromosomes (from mom and dad) has two α genes each. So if she has a single deletion, one of her four genes is missing. So her genotype is αα- / αα. Wait, no, perhaps it's αα- on one chromosome and αα on the other. Or wait, perhaps each chromosome has two α genes, and she's missing one. So if she has a single gene deletion, her genotype would be αα- / αα (since one of the two on one chromosome is missing). So when she has children, she can pass either an αα chromosome (with two genes) or an α- (with one gene missing) chromosome.

Wait, no, actually, each chromosome has two α-globin genes. So a single gene deletion on one chromosome would mean that chromosome has one gene instead of two. But wait, no, because each chromosome has two, so a single deletion would mean that one of the two is missing, so the chromosome now has one α gene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about this again. Each person has two copies of chromosome 16, each with two α-globin genes. So normally, four genes total. If someone has a single gene deletion, that means they have three α genes. So their genotype would be αα/α- (where α- indicates that one gene is missing on that chromosome). So each chromosome has two genes, but one has a deletion in one of them.

So the woman's genotype is αα/α- (since she has a single deletion). So when she produces eggs, each egg will have one of her two chromosomes. So each egg will either have the normal αα chromosome or the α- chromosome.

Wait, but how is that possible? Because each chromosome has two genes. So if she has a single gene deletion, that means one of the two genes on one chromosome is missing. So when she makes gametes, each gamete will have one of the two chromosomes. So her possible gametes are either the chromosome with both α genes (αα) or the chromosome with one α gene (α-). So each gamete has a 50% chance of being αα or α-.

Wait, but that's not quite right. Because when she makes gametes, each gamete gets one chromosome. So if her genotype is αα (with one gene missing on one chromosome), wait no, αα would mean both genes are present. Wait, perhaps her genotype is αα/α-? Or maybe another way. Maybe she has three α genes because one is missing. So in terms of the two chromosomes: one has two α genes (αα), and the other has one (α-), because one gene is deleted. So when she produces gametes, each gamete has a 50% chance of being αα (giving two α genes) and 50% chance of being α- (giving one α gene).

Now the man has a two-gene deletion, but in trans. So he's missing one gene on each chromosome. So his genotype is α-/α-. Because each of his two chromosomes has one gene missing. So each chromosome has one α gene. So when he produces sperm, each sperm will carry one of his two chromosomes, each with one α gene. So all of his sperm will carry α-.

Wait, if each of his chromosomes has one α gene missing (so each has one α gene left), then each sperm will have either one α gene (from one chromosome) or the other (but each is the same in this case because both have one α gene). So he can only pass on α-.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Each of his chromosomes has one α gene. So when he produces sperm, each sperm gets one of his two chromosomes, each of which has one α gene. So all his sperm are α-.

Wait, but each chromosome normally has two α genes. If he has two gene deletions in trans, meaning each of his two chromosomes has one deletion. So each chromosome has one α gene. So when he makes gametes, each gamete will have either one chromosome with one α gene or the other, but both are the same in this case. So all his gametes are α-.

So now, the woman can give either αα (50%) or α- (50%), and the man can only give α- (100%).

So when they have a child, the possible combinations are:

- Woman's αα + Man's α- → Child's genotype is αα/α- (but wait, each child has two chromosomes. The woman contributes one, the man contributes one.

So let's think in terms of the number of α genes each child has.

The woman's gamete possibilities:

- αα (two α genes on the chromosome)
- α- (one α gene on the chromosome)

The man's gamete possibilities:

- α- (one α gene on the chromosome)

So each child will get one chromosome from each parent.

So possible combinations:

1. Woman gives αα (two genes), man gives α- (one gene)
   → Child's genotype: αα (from mom) and α- (from dad)
   → Total α genes: 2 (from mom) +1 (from dad) = 3
   → So child has three α genes. What does that mean? Let me think.

2. Woman gives α- (one gene), man gives α- (one gene)
   → Child's genotype: α- and α-
   → Total α genes:1 +1=2
   → So child has two α genes.

Now, the question is about the percentage of offspring with a two-gene deletion. Wait, so two-gene deletion would mean they have two α genes missing, right? Or does it mean they have two deletions?

Wait, the question says the man has a two-gene deletion in trans. So he has two deletions, each on separate chromosomes. So each of his chromosomes has one deletion. So each child receives one chromosome from him, which has one deletion. So the child's other chromosome comes from the mother, which could have either two genes or one gene (if she gives the α- chromosome).

Wait, maybe the confusion is about what constitutes a two-gene deletion. Let me think: Each α-thalassemia deletion is a loss of one α gene. So a two-gene deletion would mean two α genes are missing (so the person has two less than normal, i.e., two missing). So the number of functioning α genes would be four minus two = two.

Wait, no. Because four genes are normal. If you have a two-gene deletion, you have two missing, so two functioning. So the child would have two functioning α genes.

Wait, but the man has two-gene deletions (so he has two α genes missing, total of two functioning). The woman has one gene deletion (so she has three functioning genes).

So when they have a child, the possible α gene counts are:

Case 1: Mother gives αα (two genes), father gives α- (one gene). So child has 2 +1 =3 functioning genes.

Case 2: Mother gives α- (one gene), father gives α- (one gene). So child has 1 +1=2 functioning genes.

Wait, but I thought the father can only give α- (one gene), because he has two deletions, each on separate chromosomes.

So the question is asking which percentage of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion. So having two functioning genes? Because a two-gene deletion would mean two are missing. So four minus two is two functioning.

So in case 1, the child has three functioning genes (so one deletion), and in case 2, two functioning genes (two deletions).

So the question is, what's the chance that the child has two deletions (i.e., two missing α genes, so two functioning).

So in case 2, that's when the child has two functioning genes. So the probability is the chance that the mother gives α- and the father gives α-.

The mother has a 50% chance of giving α- (since she has a 50% chance of passing that chromosome). The father always gives α-. So the chance is 0.5 * 1 = 0.5, or 50%.

Wait, wait, no. Because the woman's possible gametes are αα (50%) and α- (50%). The man's gametes are always α-.

So the possible combinations are:

- 50% chance the child gets αα (mom) and α- (dad) → total of 3 α genes → one deletion.

- 50% chance the child gets α- (mom) and α- (dad) → total of 2 α genes → two deletions.

So the percentage of offspring with two-gene deletions is 50%.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says the man's two-gene deletion is in trans (so each chromosome has one deletion). So when he contributes a chromosome, each has one deletion. The woman contributes either a normal chromosome (no deletions) or one with a deletion.

So when the child gets the woman's normal chromosome (αα) and the father's chromosome with one deletion (α-), the child's genotype is αα/α-. How many α genes? Each chromosome has two genes, but the father's is missing one. So wait, no, each chromosome has two α genes. So αα from mom and α- from dad would mean the child has three α genes in total (since the father's chromosome has one α gene, because one is deleted). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, each chromosome normally has two α genes. So if the father's chromosome has one deletion, it has one α gene. So when the child gets that, their genotype is:

From mom: αα (two genes on that chromosome)

From dad: α- (one gene on that chromosome)

So the child has a total of three α genes. Because 2 (from mom) +1 (from dad) =3.

In the other case, the child gets from mom α- (one gene) and from dad α- (one gene). So total of 2 α genes.

So 50% of the children will have two α genes (two deletions), and 50% will have three (one deletion).

So the question is, what's the percentage of their offspring that will have a two-gene deletion. So two missing α genes, which would mean two functioning. So the answer is 50%.

Looking at the options, option B is 50%. So the answer should be B.
</think>

To determine the percentage of offspring who will have a two-gene deletion, we analyze the genetic inheritance of α-thalassemia in this couple. α-thalassemia is caused by deletions in the α-globin genes, with each person normally having four α-globin genes (two on each chromosome 16). The severity of the condition depends on the number of deletions.

### Key Information:
1. **The Woman's Genotype**:
   - She has a single gene deletion, meaning she has three functioning α-globin genes.
   - Her genotype can be represented as **αα/α-**, where one chromosome has two functioning genes (αα) and the other has one gene missing (α-).
   - When producing gametes, there is a 50% chance of passing on the αα chromosome and a 50% chance of passing on the α- chromosome.

2. **The Man's Genotype**:
   - He has a two-gene deletion in trans, meaning one deletion on each chromosome (α-/α-).
   - Each chromosome has one functioning α-globin gene, so all his gametes will carry α-.

### Possible Offspring Genotypes:
- **Case 1**: The woman passes on αα, and the man passes on α-.
  - The child's genotype is **αα/α-**, with a total of three functioning α-globin genes (one deletion).
- **Case 2**: The woman passes on α-, and the man passes on α-.
  - The child's genotype is **α-/α-**, with a total of two functioning α-globin genes (two deletions).

### Probability of Each Case:
- The woman has a 50% chance of passing on αα and a 50% chance of passing on α-.
- The man always passes on α-.
- Therefore, there is a **50% chance** of the child inheriting two deletions (α-/α-) and a **50% chance** of inheriting one deletion (αα/α-).

### Conclusion:
The percentage of offspring who will have a two-gene deletion is **50%**.
