Okay, so I'm trying to solve this difference equation problem. The equation given is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = 3^n, with initial conditions y[-1] = y[-2] = 0. The method I'm supposed to use is the sum of the steady-state and homogeneous solutions. Hmm, I remember that's the standard approach for linear difference equations with constant coefficients.

First, I think I should find the homogeneous solution. That means solving the equation when the right-hand side is zero. So the homogeneous equation is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = 0.

To solve this, I need the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for a second-order homogeneous difference equation like this is typically r^2 - (5/6)r + (1/6) = 0. Wait, let me make sure. The coefficients are 1, -5/6, and 1/6 for r^2, r, and the constant term, respectively. So yes, that's correct.

Now I'll solve for r. Using the quadratic formula: r = [5/6 ± sqrt( (5/6)^2 - 4*(1)*(1/6) ) ] / 2.

Calculating the discriminant: (5/6)^2 = 25/36. 4*(1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3. So the discriminant is 25/36 - 2/3 = 25/36 - 24/36 = 1/36. Oh, that's a perfect square, so sqrt is 1/6.

So r = [5/6 ± 1/6 ] / 2. Let's compute both roots.

First root: (5/6 + 1/6) = 6/6 = 1. Divided by 2: 1/2.

Second root: (5/6 - 1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3. Divided by 2: (2/3)/2 = 1/3.

So the homogeneous solution is y_h[n] = A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.

Next, I need the particular (steady-state) solution, y_p[n], for the nonhomogeneous equation. The nonhomogeneous term here is 3^n. So I should try a particular solution of the form y_p[n] = C*3^n, where C is a constant to be determined.

Substituting y_p into the original equation:

y_p[n] - (5/6)y_p[n-1] + (1/6)y_p[n-2] = 3^n.

Plugging in y_p = C*3^n:

C*3^n - (5/6) C*3^{n-1} + (1/6)C*3^{n-2} = 3^n.

Let me factor out C*3^{n-2} from each term:

C*3^{n-2} [3^2 - (5/6)*3 + (1/6)] = 3^n.

Because 3^{n} = 3^{n-2} * 3^2, so 3^{n-2} is common.

So the equation becomes:

C * [9 - (5/6)*3 + (1/6)] * 3^{n-2} = 3^n.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express each term correctly.

C*3^n = C*3^{n}.

Similarly, (5/6) C*3^{n-1} = (5/6) C * 3^{n-1}.

And (1/6) C*3^{n-2} = (1/6) C * 3^{n-2}.

Wait, maybe it's easier to factor 3^{n} from each term. Let's see:

C*3^n = C*3^n.

-(5/6)C*3^{n-1} = -(5/6)C * 3^{n} / 3 = -(5/6)(C/3) 3^n.

Similarly, (1/6) C*3^{n-2} = (1/6) C * 3^{n} / 9 = (1/6)(C/9) 3^n.

So substituting back:

[C - (5/6)(C/3) + (1/6)(C/9)] 3^n = 3^n.

Divide both sides by 3^n:

C [ 1 - (5/6)(1/3) + (1/6)(1/9) ] = 1.

Let me compute the terms inside the brackets:

First term: 1.

Second term: (5/6)(1/3) = 5/(18).

Third term: (1/6)(1/9) = 1/(54).

So the equation becomes:

C [ 1 - 5/18 + 1/54 ] = 1.

Let me compute the expression inside the [ ]:

Convert to common denominator, which is 54.

1 = 54/54.

5/18 = 15/54.

1/54 = 1/54.

So 54/54 - 15/54 + 1/54 = (54 -15 +1)/54 = (40)/54 = 20/27.

Wait, 54-15 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yes, so 40/54 = 20/27.

So C*(20/27) = 1 → C = 27/20.

So the particular solution is y_p[n] = (27/20) 3^n.

Wait a minute, but wait. Let's double-check that substitution. I might have made a mistake in the substitution step.

Let me try another approach. Let me write y_p[n] = C 3^n.

Substitute into the equation:

y_p[n] - (5/6)y_p[n-1] + (1/6) y_p[n-2] = 3^n.

So,

C 3^n - (5/6) C 3^{n-1} + (1/6) C 3^{n-2} = 3^n.

Factor out 3^{n-2}:

3^{n-2} [ C 3^2 - (5/6) C 3 + (1/6) C ] = 3^n.

Wait, 3^{n} is 3^{n-2} * 9. So,

3^{n-2} [ 9C - (5/6)*3 C + (1/6) C ] = 9 * 3^{n-2}.

So,

[9C - (5/2) C + (1/6) C ] = 9.

Let me compute 9C - (5/2)C + (1/6) C.

Factor out C:

C [9 -5/2 +1/6].

Compute 9 in terms of sixths: 54/6.

5/2 is 15/6.

1/6 remains.

So:

54/6 -15/6 +1/6 = (54-15+1)/6 = 40/6 = 20/3.

So,

C * (20/3) =9 → C = 9 * (3/20) )= 27/20.

Yes, same result. So y_p[n] = (27/20) 3^n.

So the general solution is y[n] = y_p[n] + y_h[n] = (27/20)3^n + A (1/2)^n + B (1/3)^n.

Now, apply the initial conditions. Wait, the initial conditions given are y[-1] =0 and y[-2] =0. Hmm, but in difference equations, often initial conditions are given for n=0, n=1, etc. So maybe the equation is being considered for n >=0, but the initial conditions are given at n=-1 and n=-2. That might complicate things a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should adjust the indices to make it easier. Let me think about how to handle initial conditions at negative n.

Wait, perhaps I can shift the index. Let me let m = n + 2. Then when n = -2, m=0; n=-1 → m=1; n=0 → m=2, etc. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, I can compute y[-1] and y[-2] using the general solution and set them to zero.

So, the general solution is y[n] = (27/20)3^n + A (1/2)^n + B (1/3)^n.

We need to find A and B such that y[-1] =0 and y[-2] =0.

So let's plug in n=-1:

y[-1] = (27/20)3^{-1} + A (1/2)^{-1} + B (1/3)^{-1} =0.

Similarly, y[-2] = (27/20)3^{-2} + A (1/2)^{-2} + B (1/3)^{-2} =0.

Compute each term:

For n=-1:

3^{-1} =1/3.

(1/2)^{-1} =2.

(1/3)^{-1} =3.

So equation becomes:

(27/20)(1/3) + A*2 + B*3 =0.

Simplify 27/(20*3) → 9/20.

So 9/20 + 2A +3B =0 → equation (1): 2A +3B = -9/20.

For n=-2:

3^{-2}=1/9.

(1/2)^{-2}=4.

(1/3)^{-2}=9.

So equation:

(27/20)(1/9) + A*4 + B*9 =0.

27/(20*9) =3/(20).

So 3/20 +4A +9B =0 → equation (2):4A +9B= -3/20.

Now we have two equations:

Equation (1): 2A +3B = -9/20

Equation (2):4A +9B = -3/20

We can solve this system. Let's use elimination.

Multiply equation (1) by 2: 4A +6B = -18/20 = -9/10.

Subtract equation (2) from this:

(4A +6B) - (4A +9B) = (-9/10) - (-3/20).

So:

-3B = (-9/10 +3/20) = (-18/20 + 3/20)= (-15/20 )= -3/4.

So -3B = -3/4 → B= ( (-3/4) ) / (-3) )= 1/4.

Now substitute B=1/4 into equation (1):

2A +3*(1/4) = -9/20 → 2A +3/4 = -9/20.

Convert 3/4 to 15/20:

2A +15/20 = -9/20 → 2A = (-9-15)/20 = (-24/20 )= -6/5.

Wait, no: 2A= (-9/20 -15/20)= (-24/20)= -6/5 → A= (-6/5)/(2) = -3/5.

So A= -3/5 and B=1/4.

Wait, let me double-check the substitution:

From equation (1): 2A +3B = -9/20.

If B=1/4, then 3B=3/4=15/20.

So 2A = (-9/20 -15/20 )= (-24/20 )= -6/5 → A= (-6/5)/2 = -3/5.

Yes, correct.

So the general solution is:

y[n] = (27/20) 3^n + (-3/5)(1/2)^n + (1/4)(1/3)^n.

Which can be written as:

y[n] = (27/20)3^n - (3/5)(1/2)^n + (1/4)(1/3)^n.

Now, let's look at the options. Option C is y[n] = (27/20)3^n - (3/5)(1/2)^n + (1/4)(1/3)^n.

Option C matches exactly. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, I should double-check the other options to make sure. Let me glance through:

Option A has 26/20, which is 13/10, which doesn't match.

Option B has 27/20 2^n, which is different because our particular solution is 3^n.

Option C: yes, matches.

Option D has -3/4 instead of -3/5.

E: -2/5, no.

F: positive terms for (1/2)^n and (1/3)^n, which is wrong.

G: negative (1/3)^n, no.

H: -4/5, no.

I: -1/5, no.

J: denominator 19, no.

So the correct choice is option C.
</think>

To solve the given difference equation:

\[
y[n] - \frac{5}{6}y[n-1] + \frac{1}{6}y[n-2] = 3^n,
\]

with initial conditions \( y[-1] = y[-2] = 0 \), we use the method of solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.

### 1. Homogeneous Solution
The homogeneous equation is:

\[
y[n] - \frac{5}{6}y[n-1] + \frac{1}{6}y[n-2] = 0.
\]

The characteristic equation is:

\[
r^2 - \frac{5}{6}r + \frac{1}{6} = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
r = \frac{\frac{5}{6} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{6}}}{2}.
\]

The discriminant is:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{25}{36} - \frac{24}{36} = \frac{1}{36}.
\]

Thus, the roots are:

\[
r = \frac{\frac{5}{6} \pm \frac{1}{6}}{2}.
\]

This gives two solutions:

\[
r_1 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad r_2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

The homogeneous solution is:

\[
y_h[n] = A \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n + B \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n,
\]

where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants.

---

### 2. Particular Solution
The nonhomogeneous term is \( 3^n \). Assuming a particular solution of the form:

\[
y_p[n] = C \cdot 3^n,
\]

we substitute \( y_p[n] \) into the original equation:

\[
C \cdot 3^n - \frac{5}{6}C \cdot 3^{n-1} + \frac{1}{6}C \cdot 3^{n-2} = 3^n.
\]

Factoring out \( 3^{n-2} \):

\[
C \cdot 3^{n-2} \left[ 9 - \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{6} \right] = 3^n.
\]

Simplify the coefficients:

\[
9 - \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{54}{6} - \frac{15}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}.
\]

Thus:

\[
C \cdot \frac{20}{3} \cdot 3^{n-2} = 3^n.
\]

Dividing through by \( 3^{n-2} \):

\[
C \cdot \frac{20}{3} = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = \frac{27}{20}.
\]

The particular solution is:

\[
y_p[n] = \frac{27}{20} \cdot 3^n.
\]

---

### 3. General Solution
The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:

\[
y[n] = y_p[n] + y_h[n],
\]

\[
y[n] = \frac{27}{20} \cdot 3^n + A \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n + B \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n.
\]

---

### 4. Applying Initial Conditions
Using \( y[-1] = 0 \) and \( y[-2] = 0 \), we solve for \( A \) and \( B \).

For \( n = -1 \):

\[
y[-1] = \frac{27}{20} \cdot 3^{-1} + A \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-1} + B \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{-1} = 0.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{27}{20} \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 2A + 3B = 0,
\]

\[
\frac{9}{20} + 2A + 3B = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2A + 3B = -\frac{9}{20}.
\]

For \( n = -2 \):

\[
y[-2] = \frac{27}{20} \cdot 3^{-2} + A \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-2} + B \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{-2} = 0.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{27}{20} \cdot \frac{1}{9} + 4A + 9B = 0,
\]

\[
\frac{3}{20} + 4A +
