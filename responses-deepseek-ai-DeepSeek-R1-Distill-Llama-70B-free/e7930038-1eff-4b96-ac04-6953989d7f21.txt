Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Austin's theory of law. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember Austin was a legal philosopher. Let me think through this step by step.

The question asks which option lists the attributes of law according to Austin. The options are A through H, each with three terms. I recall that Austin's theory is part of what's called legal positivism. He had a specific definition of law that included certain key elements.

From what I remember, Austin defined law as a command from a sovereign, backed by a sanction. So the three main attributes would be command, sovereign, and sanction. Let me break that down:

1. **Command**: Law is a set of rules or directives that people are expected to follow. It's not just suggestions; they are mandatory.

2. **Sovereign**: The law comes from a sovereign authority. The sovereign is the highest power in the state, and the law emanates from this source. Austin emphasized that the sovereign is the one who makes the laws, and people are bound to obey them.

3. **Sanction**: The key part here is that laws are enforced with some kind of punishment or consequence if not followed. So, there's a sanction or penalty attached to non-compliance. This is what gives the law its binding force.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Command, sovereign, legal remedy. Wait, legal remedy is more about the means to enforce rights, not exactly the same as a sanction.

Option B: Command, sovereign, authority. Authority is related but broader. Austin's focus was on the source (sovereign) and the enforcement aspect (sanction), not just authority in general.

Option C: Command, sovereign, legal enforcement. Legal enforcement is close, but I think Austin's term was more specificâ€”sanction rather than just enforcement.

Option D: Command, sovereign, legal responsibility. Not sure about this. Legal responsibility is more about individual duties rather than the enforcement mechanism.

Option E: Command, sovereign, obedience by subject. Obedience is the result, but Austin's focus was on the threat of sanctions to ensure obedience, not just the obedience itself.

Option F: Command, sovereign, enforceability. Enforceability is a broader concept; again, Austin's specific term was sanctions.

Option G: Command, sovereign, sanction. This matches exactly what I was thinking. Command from a sovereign, with a sanction for non-compliance.

Option H: Command, sovereign, compliance. Compliance is similar to obedience, focusing on the result rather than the mechanism (sanction) that brings about that compliance.

So, the correct answer should be G. It includes all three elements as per Austin's definition: command, sovereign, and sanction.

The correct answer is G: Command, sovereign, and sanction. Austin's definition of law emphasizes that it is a command issued by a sovereign authority, enforced by sanctions for non-compliance.

Answer: G
