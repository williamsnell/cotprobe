Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about finding the mean velocity of a point's motion between two times, t=1 and t=10. The position of the point is given by the equations x = 2t, y = ln(t), and z = t². Hmm, I remember that velocity is related to the derivative of position with respect to time, but wait, mean velocity might be a bit different. Let me think.

Wait, mean velocity is the average velocity over a time interval. Oh right, average velocity is the total displacement divided by the total time. So I shouldn't be taking derivatives here, but instead looking at the change in position over the time interval.

But wait, the problem says 'mean velocity of motion'—so it's the average velocity vector. Or is it the magnitude of the average velocity? Hmm, the options are all numbers without direction, so probably the magnitude of the mean velocity.

Wait, but let me clarify. Mean velocity is generally a vector, but since the options are scalar, maybe they're asking for the magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps each component is being considered separately.

Wait, no. The mean velocity vector would be the displacement vector divided by the time interval. Then, the magnitude of that vector would be the scalar average speed. Or wait, no, average speed is different—it's the total distance traveled over time, whereas average velocity is displacement over time.

So, for this problem, since the motion is in three dimensions, the displacement vector from t=1 to t=10 is what I should compute, and then find its magnitude divided by the time interval (which is 9 seconds, since 10-1=9).

So let's outline the steps:

1. Find the position at t=1 and t=10 for each coordinate (x, y, z).
2. Subtract the initial position from the final position to get the displacement vector.
3. Compute the magnitude of this displacement vector.
4. Divide by the time interval (10-1=9) to get the mean velocity.
5. Choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let's compute each step.

First, find the position at t=1:

x(1) = 2*1 = 2
y(1) = ln(1) = 0 (since ln(1)=0)
z(1) = (1)^2 = 1

So position at t=1 is (2, 0, 1).

Next, position at t=10:

x(10) = 2*10 = 20
y(10) = ln(10) ≈ 2.302585 (I remember ln(10) is about 2.3026)
z(10) = (10)^2 = 100

So position at t=10 is (20, ≈2.3026, 100).

Now, displacement vector is final minus initial:

Δx = 20 - 2 = 18
Δy = 2.3026 - 0 = 2.3026
Δz = 100 - 1 = 99

So the displacement vector is (18, 2.3026, 99).

Now, the magnitude of this displacement vector is sqrt( (18)^2 + (2.3026)^2 + (99)^2 )

Let me compute each term:

18^2 = 324

2.3026^2 ≈ (approx 5.30) because 2.3^2 is 5.29, and 2.3026 is a bit more, so maybe around 5.304.

99^2 = 9801.

Now sum them up: 324 + 5.304 + 9801 = 324 +5.304 is 329.304; 329.304 +9801 = 10330.304.

So the magnitude is sqrt(10330.304). Let me compute that.

Hmm, sqrt(10330) is approximately... Let's see. 100^2 is 10,000. 101^2 is 10201. 102^2 is 10404. So 101^2 is 10201, which is less than 10330. The difference is 10330 - 10201 = 129. So 101 + (129)/(2*101 +1) approximately, using linear approximation. Wait, but maybe just a rough estimate.

Wait, 101.5^2 = (101 + 0.5)^2 = 101² + 2*101*0.5 + 0.5² = 10201 + 101 + 0.25 = 10302.25.

Hmm, 101.5^2 =10302.25, and our value is 10330.304. So 10330.304 -10302.25=28.054. So since 101.5 gives 10302.25, each additional 0.1 increases the square by about 2*101.5*0.1 + (0.1)^2 = approx 20.3 per 0.1. Wait, perhaps better to compute 101.5 + x, where x is small.

Let me compute (101.5 + x)^2 =10302.25 + 203x +x² ≈ 10330.304.

So, 10302.25 +203x ≈10330.304 → 203x≈28.054 → x≈28.054/203 ≈ 0.1382.

So sqrt(10330.304) ≈101.5 +0.1382 ≈101.6382.

Wait, but wait, that's not right because 101.5^2=10302.25, and 101.6^2=?

Let me compute 101.6^2:

101.6 *101.6 = ?

Well, (100 +1.6)^2 =100^2 + 2*100*1.6 +1.6^2=10000 + 320 +2.56=10322.56.

Hmm, 101.6^2=10322.56, which is less than 10330.304.

The difference is 10330.304 -10322.56=7.744.

So how much more beyond 101.6? Let's say each 0.1 adds about 20.32 to the square (since derivative is 2a, a=101.6, so 2*101.6=203.2 per 1 unit). So for 7.744, x≈7.744/203.2 ≈0.0381.

So approx 101.6 + 0.0381=101.6381. So about 101.638.

So the magnitude is approximately 101.638.

Then, the time interval is 10-1=9 seconds.

So mean velocity is displacement magnitude divided by time: 101.638 /9 ≈ let's compute that.

101.638 /9: 9*11=99, so 11.0 with a remainder of 2.638. 2.638/9≈0.293. So total is approximately 11.293.

Wait, wait wait, that can't be right. Because 9 times 11 is 99, 9*11.29= 101.61, which is close to 101.638. So 11.29 approx.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are:

A: 9.00

B: 12.50

C:13.00

D:15.00

E:14.20

F:10.00

G:7.75

H:8.50

I:9.75

J:11.25

Hmm, I'm getting approximately 11.29, which is close to 11.25, which is option J.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of displacement magnitude. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, wait a second. Oh no, wait, I think I messed up the components. Because the displacement vector is (18, 2.3026, 99), but earlier I might have added the squares incorrectly.

Wait, 18 squared is 324, yes. 2.3026 squared is about (using calculator) 2.3026^2 = approx 5.3019. And 99 squared is 9801.

So 324 +5.3019=329.3019; 329.3019 +9801= 11330.3019? Wait, that can't be right. Because 324+5.3 is 329.3, plus 9801 is 10,130.3, not 11,330. Oh wait, no, 9801 is nine thousand eight hundred one, so 329.3 +9801 = 10,130.3.

Wait, I think I had a mistake earlier. Oh no! I thought 99^2 was 9801, which is correct. So 18^2=324, 2.3^2≈5.3, and 99^2=9801. So sum is 324 +5.3 +9801 = 10,130.3 approximately.

So the square root of 10,130.3. Let me compute that.

What's the square of 100: 10,000. 100^2=10k. So 100.65^2= (100 +0.65)^2=100^2 + 2*100*0.65 +0.65^2=10,000 +130 +0.4225=10,130.4225. Oh wait, that's very close to 10,130.3.

So sqrt(10,130.3) is approximately 100.65.

Wait, wait, that makes more sense. Because 100^2=10,000, 100.65^2≈10,130.4225. So our displacement magnitude is about 100.65.

Then, the mean velocity is 100.65 /9 ≈ 11.1833.

Hmm, which is approximately 11.18, so about 11.18 units per second.

Looking at the options, J is 11.25, which is close. Let me check if I did the displacement correctly.

Wait, another approach: Compute each component accurately.

Compute the displacement:

Δx = 20-2=18

Δy= ln(10) - ln(1)= ln(10/1)=ln(10)=2.302585093.

Δz=100-1=99.

So, the displacement vector is (18, 2.302585093, 99).

Compute the magnitude squared: (18)^2 + (2.302585093)^2 + (99)^2.

Compute each term:

18^2 = 324.

(2.302585093)^2 ≈ let me compute that more accurately.

2.302585093 * 2.302585093.

Let me compute 2.3 * 2.3 =5.29.

But more accurately:

2.302585093^2 = (2 + 0.302585093)^2 = 4 + 2*(2)*(0.302585093) + (0.302585093)^2.

=4 + 1.2103... + 0.09167.

Wait, wait, 2*(2)=4, 2*(2)*(0.302585)= 1.21034. The last term: (0.302585)^2 ≈0.09167.

So 4 + 1.21034=5.21034; plus 0.09167=5.30201.

So approximately 5.30201.

Then 99^2=9801.

So sum is 324 +5.30201 +9801 = 324 +5.30201=329.30201; 329.30201 +9801= 10,130.30201.

So sqrt(10,130.30201) is exactly 100.65, since 100.65^2=10,130.4225, which is very close. The slight difference is due to rounding.

So sqrt(10,130.30201) ≈100.65.

So displacement magnitude ≈100.65.

Time interval is 10-1=9 seconds.

Mean velocity: 100.65 /9 ≈11.1833.

So approximately 11.183, which is about 11.18.

Looking at the options, J is 11.25, which is the closest.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the displacement magnitude. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute sqrt(10,130.30201) more accurately. Let me think: 100.65^2 is 10,130.4225, as I had earlier. Since 100.65^2 is 10,130.4225, which is just a little above 10,130.30201. So the actual square root would be a little less than 100.65.

Let me compute 100.65 - x, where x is a small number, such that (100.65 -x)^2 = 10,130.30201.

Expanding (100.65 -x)^2=100.65² - 2*100.65*x + x² =10,130.4225 - 201.3 x +x².

Set this equal to 10,130.30201.

So 10,130.4225 -201.3 x ≈10,130.30201.

Subtract 10,130.30201 from both sides: 0.12049 ≈201.3 x.

So x≈0.12049 /201.3 ≈0.000599.

So 100.65 -0.000599≈100.6494.

So sqrt(10,130.30201)≈100.6494.

So displacement is approximately 100.6494, and time is 9 seconds.

So mean velocity is 100.6494 /9 ≈11.1832.

Which is approximately 11.18.

Looking at the options, J is 11.25, which is 0.0668 higher.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately, using exact values.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact value without approximating.

Wait, but let me think differently. Let's compute each component exactly as possible.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is expecting an exact value, not an approximate. Let me see.

Wait, the displacement vector components are 18, ln(10), and 99. So the square of the displacement is (18)^2 + (ln(10))^2 + (99)^2 = 324 + (ln(10))^2 +9801.

So 324 +9801 =10125. Then add (ln(10))^2.

What's (ln(10))^2? Let me compute it accurately.

ln(10)=2.302585093.

So (ln(10))^2 = 2.302585093^2 = 5.3019026.

So total displacement squared is 10125 +5.3019026=10130.3019026.

So displacement magnitude is sqrt(10130.3019026).

Now, let me compute sqrt(10130.3019) precisely.

I can compute it using a calculator approach, but perhaps I can see that 100^2=10,000; 100.6^2= (100+0.6)^2=10000 + 120 +0.36=10120.36.

Hmm, 100.6^2=10120.36.

100.6^2=10120.36 <10130.3019.

What's 100.6 + x, where x is small, such that (100.6 +x)^2=10130.3019.

(100.6 +x)^2 =100.6^2 +2*100.6*x +x²=10120.36 +201.2 x +x².

Set equal to 10130.3019.

So 10120.36 +201.2 x ≈10130.3019.

Subtract 10120.36: 201.2 x ≈9.9419.

So x≈9.9419/201.2 ≈0.04937.

So 100.6 +0.04937≈100.64937.

So displacement magnitude is approximately 100.64937.

Divide by 9: 100.64937 /9=11.1832.

Which is approximately 11.1832, so about 11.18.

Looking at the options, the closest is J, 11.25, but that's 0.0668 higher. Hmm, maybe the approximation is causing this, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I'm supposed to find the magnitude of the average velocity vector, which is (Δx/Δt, Δy/Δt, Δz/Δt), and then find its magnitude.

Wait, no, the mean velocity is the displacement divided by the time interval. So yes, that's what I did. So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each component's average velocity and then find the magnitude.

Wait, but that's the same as displacement divided by time, so same result.

Wait, another approach: Compute each component's average velocity, then find the vector, and its magnitude.

Δx=18, Δt=9 → Vx=2.

Δy=ln(10)=2.302585093, so Vy=2.302585093/9≈0.255843.

Δz=99, so Vz=99/9=11.

So the average velocity vector is (2, 0.255843, 11).

The magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (0.255843)^2 +11^2).

Compute each term:

2^2=4.

0.255843^2≈0.0654.

11^2=121.

Sum:4 +0.0654=4.0654; 4.0654+121=125.0654.

sqrt(125.0654)= approx 11.184.

Which is the same as before. So 11.184 is the magnitude. So again, the closest option is J:11.25.

But none of the options exactly match 11.18, but J is 11.25, which is 0.0668 higher. Hmm, perhaps the options have rounded to two decimal places, but maybe the exact calculation would give something a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(125.0654).

Wait, but wait, 11.18^2=?

11^2=121.

11.18^2 = (11 +0.18)^2 =121 + 2*11*0.18 +0.18
