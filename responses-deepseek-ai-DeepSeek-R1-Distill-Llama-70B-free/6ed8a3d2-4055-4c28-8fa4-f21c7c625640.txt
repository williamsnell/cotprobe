Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this ethics question. Let's see what the question says. 

The scenario is that I receive a letter from the Ethics Committee asking for information about a former client who has filed a complaint against her current therapist. I stopped seeing this client over seven years ago. The question is about what I should do.

First, I need to recall the ethical guidelines related to confidentiality and handling client records. I remember that in many professional codes, like the APA or NASW, confidentiality is a big deal. But there are exceptions, especially when there's a legal or ethical obligation to disclose information.

So the options are A through H. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Cooperate by sending the client’s file. Hmm, but I haven't seen the client in seven years. Is it just about cooperation, or do I need consent? I think sending the entire file without consent might violate confidentiality.

Option B: Inform the Committee that the info is obsolete and I can't release it. Well, maybe the info isn't obsolete, but it's about whether I can release it without consent. So this might not be the right approach because the Committee might have a legitimate reason to ask.

Option C: Ignore the request. That doesn't seem right. As a professional, I should probably respond, even if it's to explain that I can't comply.

Option D: Cooperate without verification. That sounds risky. Without checking if the client has given consent, I might be breaking confidentiality.

Option E: Cooperate after confirming the client signed a release. This sounds more appropriate. If the client has given consent, then it's okay to share relevant info.

Option F: Cooperate without the client's consent. That would probably violate confidentiality unless there's an exception, like a court order. But the question doesn't mention that.

Option G: Refuse because it violates privacy. If the Committee has a legitimate need, maybe they have the authority to request it, so refusal might not be the best choice.

Option H: Say I deleted the file. That's probably not true unless I have a policy to destroy files after a certain period, but the question doesn't state that. Plus, seven years might still be within the retention period required by law or ethics.

So putting it together, the correct approach would be to check if the client has given consent. If she has, then share the relevant information. That points to option E.

The correct approach is to cooperate with the Ethics Committee's request by sending the information believed to be relevant to the case, but only after confirming that the client has signed a release. This ensures compliance with ethical obligations regarding confidentiality.
