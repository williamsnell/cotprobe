Okay, so I have this question about exercise and energy sources. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that when you exercise, especially at high intensity, your body uses different energy systems.

The question is asking about the energy released from high-energy phosphates, specifically ATP and phosphocreatine. I think these are the immediate energy sources. So when you start exercising, your body first uses ATP that's already stored. But wait, I also remember that ATP doesn't last very long because there's not much of it stored.

Wait, the options are from A to J. The question is about how long maximal exertion can be sustained by these high-energy phosphates. Maximal exertion means like a very intense, short burst of activity. I think the ATP-PC system is for quick, high-intensity efforts.

From what I learned, the ATP stores are very limited. They last maybe a few seconds. Phosphocreatine helps replenish ATP, but together, they can't sustain activity for more than around 10-15 seconds or so. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 10-15 seconds. Let me think again.

No, wait, another thought. The phosphocreatine system can sustain activity for maybe up to 30 seconds. Or perhaps a bit less. So maximal exertion, like sprinting, relies on this system. So if someone is doing a 100-meter dash, which takes about 10 seconds, that's covered by the ATP-PC system. But if the question is about maximal exertion, maybe it's a bit longer.

Wait, let me think about the energy systems. There's the ATP-PC system (immediate), then the glycolysis (which takes a bit longer, maybe 1-2 minutes), and then the aerobic system, which takes even longer and supports longer activities.

So the ATP and phosphocreatine together can't sustain more than maybe 10 seconds. But wait, I think I remember that the ATP stores are about 2-3 seconds. Phosphocreatine can extend that a bit. So combined, maybe 10 seconds? Or perhaps up to 30 seconds.

Looking at the options, the options are in seconds, minutes, etc. Let's see the options again:

A: 20-30 minutes. That's way too long, probably for aerobic.

B:1-2 seconds. That might be just the ATP, without PC.

C:10-15 minutes. Also too long.

D:30-40 seconds. Hmm, seems possible.

E:90-100 seconds. That's like 1.5 minutes, probably glycolysis.

F:50-60 seconds. Also longer.

G:70-80. Even longer.

H:5-10 seconds. That's in the ballpark.

Wait, but I thought phosphocreatine gives a bit more time. So maybe the total is more than just 5-10.

Wait, I think the ATP-PC system can last about 8-12 seconds. So maximal exertion can't be sustained beyond that. So the correct answer would be around 8-12, but the options don't have that.

Looking at the options again, the closest would be H: 5-10 seconds or D:30-40. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The ATP stores are enough for about 2-3 seconds. Then phosphocreatine takes over, which can last maybe another 6-8 seconds. So together, about 10 seconds. So the correct option would be H:5-10 seconds. But wait, I thought sometimes it's said to last up to 30 seconds. Or maybe that's when including some glycolysis contribution.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the systems. The ATP-PC is for high-intensity, short duration. So for something like a 10-second sprint, you're using ATP-PC. But if you go longer, like 30 seconds, maybe you start using glycolysis as well.

So maximal exertion, like all-out, can only be sustained for about 10 seconds using ATP and PC. So the answer would be H:5-10 seconds.

Wait, but the options have D:30-40 seconds. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the energy systems again.

The immediate energy sources (ATP and PC) provide energy for about 10 seconds maximum. So any activity beyond that, like 30 seconds, would start relying on anaerobic glycolysis. So the correct answer for the question is H:5-10 seconds.

The question asks about the duration that maximal exertion exercise can be sustained by the energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates, ATP and phosphocreatine. These compounds are part of the ATP-PC system, which is the immediate energy source for high-intensity, short-duration activities. 

ATP itself is stored in limited quantities and can sustain activity for about 2-3 seconds. Phosphocreatine helps replenish ATP, extending the duration slightly. Together, the ATP-PC system can support maximal exertion for approximately 8-12 seconds. Among the provided options, the closest match is **H: 5-10 seconds**, as it aligns with the understanding that the ATP-PC system is exhausted within this timeframe. Longer durations, such as 30-40 seconds, would require contributions from other energy systems like anaerobic glycolysis.
