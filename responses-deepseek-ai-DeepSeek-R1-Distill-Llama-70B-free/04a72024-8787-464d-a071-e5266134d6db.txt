Question:

A state enacted a statute making it illegal to knowingly sell, purchase, or in anyway distribute any form of tobacco to a minor. Violation of the statute was a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail. After the statute's enactment, a defendant sold a pack of cigarettes to a girl who was 17 years of age. Before selling the product to the girl, the defendant carefully examined the girl's driver's license, which indicated that she was, in fact, 17 years old. The defendant nevertheless made the sale because he erroneously believed the age of majority to be 17. The defendant is subsequently charged with violation of the statute, and his mistake is honestly held to have been made. Such a mistake should

Options:

A: not prevent his conviction, because the crime imposes absolute criminal liability.
B: result in his acquittal, because the girl presented a false identity.
C: not prevent his conviction, because he intentionally sold the cigarettes.
D: not prevent his conviction, because he had previous knowledge of the law.
E: result in his acquittal, because he did not possess the requisite mens rea.
F: not prevent his conviction, because the age of majority is 18, not 17.
G: result in his acquittal, because he took reasonable steps to ascertain the girl's age.
H: result in his acquittal, because he honestly made a mistake.
I: result in his acquittal, because the statute was not clearly defined.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with mistakes of fact and their impact on criminal liability. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about a statute that makes it illegal to sell tobacco to a minor. The punishment is a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail. The defendant sold cigarettes to a 17-year-old girl. He checked her driver's license, which showed she was 17, but he mistakenly thought the age of majority was 17, so he sold them anyway. Now, he's charged with violating the statute, and his mistake was honestly held. The question is whether this mistake should prevent his conviction.

First, I need to understand the elements of the crime here. The statute makes it illegal to sell tobacco to a minor. So the prohibited act (actus reus) is selling tobacco, and the mental state (mens rea) would be knowingly doing so to a minor. Wait, but does the statute require knowing that the person is a minor, or is it enough that the person is underage?

Looking at the statute, it says "knowingly sell, purchase, or distribute any form of tobacco to a minor." So the key word here is "knowingly." That suggests that the defendant must have known that the person was a minor. But wait, the defendant in this case did check the ID, which showed she was 17. However, he thought the age of majority was 17, so he didn't realize she was a minor. So he didn't know she was underage because of his mistake about the law.

Wait, but is that a mistake of fact or a mistake of law? Because he thought the age was different, that's a mistake about the law, not a fact. Because the law sets the age, so thinking the age is 17 when it's actually 18 is a mistake about the legal age, which is a mistake of law.

In criminal law, generally, a mistake of fact can provide a defense if it negates the required mens rea. But a mistake of law usually doesn't. So if the crime requires knowing that the person is a minor, and the defendant didn't know because he thought 17 wasn't a minor, that's a mistake about the law, not fact.

Wait, but the girl's age is a fact. The mistake is about the legal status based on age. So maybe it's a bit of both. Let me think again. The defendant's mistake is that he thought 17 was the age of majority, so he didn't think she was a minor. But the legal age is 18, so she is a minor. So his mistake is about the legal age, not about her actual age. He knew her actual age (17) from the ID, but thought that wasn't a minor.

So the issue is whether his mistake about the law (age of majority) affects the mens rea. The statute requires selling to a minor knowingly. If the defendant didn't know she was a minor because he thought 17 wasn't a minor, does that negate the mens rea?

But wait, the mens rea is about the act, not the law. So the crime is about knowingly selling to a minor, which is a factual circumstance. So if he didn't know she was a minor because of his mistake about the law, does that mean he lacked the requisite intent?

Alternatively, is the crime a strict liability offense? Because sometimes, in certain regulatory crimes like selling alcohol to minors, the mens rea is not required regarding the minor's age. But the statute here uses the word "knowingly," which suggests that it's not strict liability.

Wait, the statute says "knowingly sell... to a minor." So the defendant must know that the person is a minor. If he didn't know because he thought 17 wasn't a minor, then he didn't have the knowledge required. So his mistake would negate the mens rea.

But wait, is that a mistake of fact or law? Because the minor's age is a fact, but the legal age is a matter of law. His mistake is about the law, thinking that 17 is the age of majority. So he's mistaken about what the law considers a minor. So that's a mistake of law. But in criminal law, a mistake of law is generally not a defense, except in certain cases where the statute was not published or the person relied on official statements.

But here, the defendant's mistake is about the law itself, not about the facts. So even if he thought 17 wasn't a minor, if the law says it is, he's mistaken about the law, which doesn't excuse him. Because in such cases, the law doesn't require that he knows the legal definition; it's enough that he knows the factual circumstances that make the person a minor.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The required mens rea is knowledge that the person is a minor. The defendant knew the girl was 17, but thought that 17 was the age of majority, so he didn't think she was a minor. So he didn't have the knowledge that she was a minor. But does that matter?

Alternatively, does the statute require that he knew the person was under the legal age, regardless of his understanding of what that age is? So if he knew she was 17, and the law says minors are under 18, then he knew she was a minor, even if he mistakenly thought 17 was the age of majority. Because in reality, 17 is under 18, so she's a minor.

Wait, that's a different angle. If the defendant knew her age was 17, and 17 is below 18, then he knew she was a minor, regardless of his mistaken belief about the age of majority. Because the definition of minor is under 18. So regardless of his mistake, he knew she was 17, which is a minor. So he did have the knowledge. Therefore, his mistake doesn't negate the mens rea.

Wait, but that contradicts the initial thought. Let me think again. The statute requires selling to a minor knowingly. So, does the defendant need to know that the person is a minor (i.e., under 18), or does he just need to know their actual age, which would make them a minor under the law?

If the statute is written as "knowingly sells to a minor," then the defendant must know that the person is a minor. So if he thought that 17 was the age of majority, he didn't know she was a minor. Therefore, he lacked the mens rea, even though he knew her age was 17.

Alternatively, if the statute is interpreted as requiring knowledge of the age being under 18, then knowing the age is 17 would suffice. But that's a bit ambiguous.

I think the key here is that the statute requires "knowingly" selling to a minor. So the mens rea is about the minor status, not just the age. So if the defendant didn't know she was a minor (because he thought 17 was the age of majority), then he didn't have the required mens rea.

Wait, but that can't be right because then anyone who misunderstands the age could just claim they didn't know. So maybe the law doesn't require that level of knowledge. Instead, it's enough that the person is a minor, and the defendant knew their age, which would make them a minor. So the defendant knew she was 17, which under the law makes her a minor. Therefore, regardless of his misunderstanding about the age of majority, he knew she was a minor because he knew her age.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about how courts treat this. For example, in some cases, a defendant's mistake about the law (like the age of consent) doesn't negate the mens rea if the statute requires knowledge of the victim's age. So if the statute requires knowing the person is under a certain age, and the defendant knew the age but thought the law was different, that's a mistake of law, which doesn't help.

But in this case, the statute says "knowingly sell to a minor." So the mens rea is about the minor status, which is determined by law. So the defendant's mistake about the law (thinking 17 is the age of majority) means he didn't realize she was a minor, thus lacking the mens rea.

Wait, but that seems to conflate the issue. The minor status is a legal term based on age. So if the defendant knew her age was 17, and 17 is a minor, he knew she was a minor regardless of his misunderstanding of the law. Because the law defines a minor as under 18, so 17 is a minor. So he knew she was a minor because he knew her age, even if he thought 17 was the age of majority. That seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the mistake is about the law, so it's a mistake of law, which doesn't provide a defense. Because the defendant is responsible for knowing the law. So if he thought the age was 17, but the law says 18, he's mistaken about the law, which doesn't excuse him. So even if he didn't know she was a minor because of his legal misunderstanding, he's still guilty.

So the crime requires knowingly selling to a minor. The defendant knew the girl's age was 17, which is a minor under the law. Therefore, he knew she was a minor, regardless of his belief about the age of majority. So his mistake doesn't negate the mens rea.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if he thought 17 was the age of majority, he didn't think she was a minor. So he didn't know she was a minor, even though he knew her age.

But the law defines a minor as under 18. So if he knew she was 17, he knew she was a minor. His belief about the law (that 17 is the age of majority) doesn't change the fact that she is a minor. So he had the knowledge required.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about it another way. Suppose the law defines a minor as under 18. The defendant sells to someone he knows is 17. He thinks that 17 is the age of majority, so he doesn't think she's a minor. But in reality, she is a minor because 17 is under 18. So does he know she's a minor? He knows her age, which is 17, but he doesn't realize that 17 is a minor because of his misunderstanding of the law.

So the question is whether "knowingly" in the statute requires knowledge of her status as a minor (i.e., under 18) or just knowledge of her age.

If the statute requires knowledge that she is a minor, then his mistake about the law would mean he didn't have that knowledge. But if the statute requires knowledge of her age, then knowing she's 17 is enough, regardless of his beliefs about the law.

But the statute says "to a minor," which is a legal term. So the mens rea is about transferring to a minor, meaning he must know she's a minor. So if he didn't know because of a mistake about the law, he lacks the mens rea.

Wait, but that can't be right because then people could just claim they didn't know the law. So perhaps the better approach is that the defendant is responsible for knowing the law. Therefore, his mistake about the law doesn't negate the mens rea. So even if he thought 17 was the age of majority, he still knew she was 17, which is a minor under the law. Therefore, he had the mens rea.

Alternatively, maybe the crime is a strict liability offense, where the mens rea is only regarding the act of selling, not the minor's age. But the statute uses "knowingly," which implies intent regarding the sale to a minor.

Wait, the statute says "knowingly sell... to a minor." So the "knowingly" applies to both the act and the circumstance (that the person is a minor). So the defendant must know that he's selling to a minor. If he didn't know she was a minor because he thought 17 wasn't a minor, then he didn't have the necessary knowledge.

But is that a mistake of fact or law? His mistake is about the legal age, which is a matter of law, so it's a mistake of law. Mistake of law generally doesn't provide a defense unless certain exceptions apply. But if the mistake of law negates the mens rea, then it could be a defense.

Wait, but in this case, the mistake of law causes the defendant to not realize that 17 is a minor. So it's a mistake about the law that affects his understanding of the circumstances. So perhaps that's treated as a mistake of fact. Because he's mistaken about the legal classification of her age, which relates to a factual circumstance (her being a minor).

Alternatively, no, because the classification is a legal matter. So the minor status is determined by law, so his mistake is about the law, not the fact.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to find a similar example. For instance, in cases where the defendant mistakenly believes the age of consent is higher than it is, and they have sex with a minor. Courts generally hold that a mistake about the law (age of consent) is not a defense. So even if the defendant thought the age was higher, if the victim was under the actual legal age, the defendant can be convicted.

Applying that here, the defendant's mistake about the legal age of majority (thinking it's 17 instead of 18) wouldn't be a defense. Because he knew the girl's age was 17, which is under 18, making her a minor. Therefore, he knew she was a minor, regardless of his misunderstanding about the law.

Wait, but that would mean he did have the requisite mens rea, so his mistake doesn't prevent conviction. So looking at the options:

Option A says it doesn't prevent conviction because it's absolute liability. But the statute uses "knowingly," so it's not absolute liability.

Option C says it doesn't prevent conviction because he intentionally sold cigarettes. Well, that's true, but the issue is whether he had the mens rea regarding her being a minor.

Option E says it results in acquittal because he didn't have the requisite mens rea.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. If the statute requires knowledge that she's a minor, and he didn't have that knowledge because of a mistake about the law, then he lacks the mens rea, leading to acquittal (Option E). But if the law doesn't accept that excuse, then he's guilty.

But I think the general rule is that a mistake of law doesn't negate the mens rea unless it's a mistake about the law induced by an official statement, etc. So in this case, his mistake is about the law, so it doesn't negate the mens rea. Therefore, he's guilty because he knew her age, which made her a minor, regardless of his misunderstanding.

Wait, but he didn't know she was a minor; he thought she wasn't because of his mistake. So he didn't have the knowledge required. So in that case, his mistake negates the mens rea, leading to acquittal.

But that seems to go against the general rule that mistake of law isn't a defense. So maybe the correct approach is that the defendant must have knowledge of the minor's status, and his mistake about the law means he didn't have that knowledge. Therefore, his mistake would negate the mens rea, leading to acquittal, which would be Option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the crime is a strict liability offense, but the statute uses "knowingly," which suggests otherwise. So if the statute requires knowingly selling to a minor, and the defendant didn't know because of a mistake of law, then he lacks the mens rea. Therefore, Option E would apply.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another angle. The girl presented a valid ID showing she was 17. The defendant checked it and thought she was of age. So he took steps to verify, but his mistake was about the law. So is he excused because he took reasonable steps? That would relate to whether the offense allows for a defense of due diligence or mistake.

But I don't think so, because the statute requires knowingly selling to a minor. So if he didn't know she was a minor, regardless of the reason, he lacks the mens rea. So his mistake, even if honest, would negate the mens rea.

Wait, but that's only if the mistake is about the minor's age. If it's a mistake about the law, then it's a different story. So the defendant's mistake is about the law, not the facts. Therefore, it doesn't negate the mens rea.

So, for example, if he thought she was 18 based on her appearance and didn't check the ID, and she was actually 17, that's a mistake of fact, which might negate the mens rea. But in this case, he checked the ID and knew she was 17 but thought it was legal. So that's a mistake of law, which doesn't negate the mens rea. Therefore, he is guilty.

So the answer would be that his mistake doesn't prevent conviction. Now, looking at the options, which ones say that.

Option A: not prevent, absolute liability. But the statute isn't absolute liability because it uses "knowingly."

Option C: not prevent, because he intentionally sold. That's true, but the issue is the mens rea regarding the minor.

Option F: not prevent, because the age is 18. But that's just stating the law, not addressing the mistake.

Option G: acquittal because he took reasonable steps. But the statute requires knowledge, not just reasonable steps.

So perhaps the correct answer is A, but it's not absolute liability.

Wait, maybe the crime is a strict liability offense regarding the minor's age. But the statute says "knowingly," which would imply that it's not strict liability.

Alternatively, perhaps the crime is strict liability, and "knowingly" only applies to the act of selling, not the minor's age. So the defendant knowingly sold cigarettes, but the minor part is strict liability. In that case, his mistake wouldn't matter.

But that depends on how the statute is interpreted. If the "knowingly" applies to both the act and the minor's age, then it's not strict liability. If it only applies to the act, then the minor part is strict.

But the way the statute is phrased: "knowingly sell... to a minor." So the "knowingly" likely modifies the entire act, including the minor part.

So, going back, if the defendant didn't know she was a minor (due to a mistake of law), then he lacks the mens rea. So his mistake would prevent conviction, leading to Option E.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to summarize:

- The crime requires knowingly selling to a minor.

- The defendant knew the girl's age was 17.

- He thought 17 was the age of majority, so he didn't think she was a minor.

So, the question is: does his mistake about the law negate the required mens rea.

In most cases, a mistake of law doesn't negate the mens rea. But if the mistake causes the defendant
