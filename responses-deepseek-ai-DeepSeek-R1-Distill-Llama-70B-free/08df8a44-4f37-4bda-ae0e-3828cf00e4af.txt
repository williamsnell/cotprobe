Question:

How would Maslow differentiate between an individual who was motivated by lower needs and one who was motivated by self-actualization needs ?

Options:

A: Lower needs motivated people are externally driven, while self-actualizing people are internally driven
B: Those motivated by lower needs often experience anxiety and stress when their needs are not met, while individuals focused on self-actualization maintain a sense of peace and contentment regardless of circumstances.
C: People motivated by lower needs are self-centered and focused on satisfying their own needs, while those motivated by self-actualization are growth-oriented and concerned with the nature of the world and other people.
D: Individuals motivated by lower needs require external validation, whereas those motivated by self-actualization needs find satisfaction from within themselves regardless of external recognition.
E: People motivated by lower needs are always in a state of deficiency, while those motivated by self-actualization are always in a state of abundance
F: Individuals motivated by lower needs are more likely to conform to societal expectations, while those pursuing self-actualization needs are more likely to challenge norms and pursue unconventional paths.
G: Lower needs motivated individuals prioritize social status and material wealth, whereas those motivated by self-actualization prioritize personal growth and meaningful experiences.
H: People motivated by lower needs are more likely to be individualistic, while those motivated by self-actualization are more likely to be communal
I: People driven by lower needs seek to maintain their basic comfort and security, while those driven by self-actualization seek to fulfill their potential and purpose in life.
J: People motivated by lower needs are primarily concerned with avoiding pain and discomfort, while those motivated by self-actualization embrace challenges and discomfort as opportunities for growth.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Maslow's hierarchy of needs. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that Maslow's theory is about different levels of human needs, right? The lower needs are like the basic ones, and then higher ones are more about personal growth.

The question is asking how Maslow would differentiate between someone motivated by lower needs versus self-actualization needs. I think the lower needs include things like physiological needs (food, water), safety, love, and esteem. Self-actualization is the highest level, where people seek to fulfill their potential.

So, the options are A through J. Let me go through each option and see which one fits.

Option A: Lower needs are externally driven, self-actualizing internally. That makes sense because lower needs might be driven by external factors like environment or society (like needing a job for money), while self-actualization is about internal desires, like personal goals or passions. So this seems possible.

Option B: Lower needs people get anxious when their needs aren't met, while self-actualizers stay peaceful. I'm not sure. I think anxiety might be more about lower needs, but I don't recall if self-actualizers are always peaceful. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option C: Lower needs people are self-centered, self-actualizers are growth-oriented. Wait, I think self-actualization is more about personal growth, but I'm not sure about the self-centered part. Lower needs might be more about basic survival, which could be seen as self-centered, but I'm not sure if Maslow framed it that way.

Option D: Lower needs require external validation, self-actualization from within. That seems right because self-actualization is about internal satisfaction, but I'm not certain if lower needs specifically require external validation. Maybe more about external factors like job security.

Option E: Lower needs are deficiency, self-actualization abundance. I think Maslow talked about deficiency needs (D-needs) versus being needs (B-needs). So lower needs are D-needs, which are about avoiding deficiency, while self-actualization is about growth. So E might be correct, but the wording is "always in a state of abundance" which might not be accurate.

Option F: Lower needs conform, self-actualizers challenge norms. That sounds plausible because self-actualizers might be more individualistic and less concerned with societal expectations. So they might challenge norms more.

Option G: Lower prioritize status and wealth, self-actualization growth and experiences. That could be, but I'm not sure if lower needs are specifically about material wealth. Lower needs include safety and physiological, which are more basic than just wealth.

Option H: Lower needs are individualistic, self-actualization communal. Hmm, I think self-actualization might involve helping others, but I'm not sure if lower needs are more individualistic. Maybe lower needs are more about personal survival, which can be individual.

Option I: Lower needs seek comfort and security, self-actualization seek potential and purpose. This sounds accurate. Lower needs are about the basics (comfort, security), while self-actualization is about fulfilling one's potential and life's purpose.

Option J: Lower needs avoid pain, self-actualizers embrace challenges. I think this is also correct because self-actualizers see challenges as growth opportunities. Lower needs are about avoiding pain or discomfort, which ties into safety and security.

Wait, but let me think again. The main differentiation is the type of needs: lower are deficiency needs, higher are growth. So the answer should reflect that.

Looking back, option I says lower needs are about maintaining comfort and security, which are the lower needs. Self-actualization is about fulfilling potential, which is higher. So I think I is correct.

Option A was about external vs internal drive. That also seems correct because lower needs might be driven by external factors (like needing a job to pay bills), while self-actualization is internal (like wanting to create art).

Hmm, so which is more accurate according to Maslow? I think both A and I are correct points, but the question is about how Maslow differentiates.

Wait, Maslow's hierarchy is about the progression from lower (basic) to higher (self-actualization). Lower needs are about meeting basic requirements, while self-actualization is about personal growth beyond that.

Option I directly addresses the difference in what the needs are about: comfort/security vs fulfilling potential. So I think I is the correct answer.

Alternatively, option D talks about external validation. I'm not sure if that's a point Maslow emphasized. I think self-actualization is more about internal satisfaction, but lower needs might not necessarily require external validation.

So between A, I, and J. Option I seems more directly about the focus of the needs themselves, which is probably what the question is after.

To address how Maslow differentiates between individuals motivated by lower needs and those motivated by self-actualization needs, it's important to focus on the core distinctions in his theory. Maslow's hierarchy categorizes needs into lower (deficiency) needs and higher (growth) needs. Lower needs, such as physiological, safety, love, and esteem, are about meeting basic requirements for survival and comfort. In contrast, self-actualization, the highest level, involves personal growth, fulfilling potential, and pursuing purpose in life.

Option I aligns most closely with this distinction, as it highlights that individuals motivated by lower needs seek to maintain basic comfort and security, while those driven by self-actualization strive to fulfill their potential and purpose. This directly reflects Maslow's emphasis on the progression from basic, deficiency-based needs to growth-oriented, self-actualization needs.

While other options, such as A and J, also touch on relevant aspects like internal vs. external drive or embracing challenges, Option I provides the most precise and comprehensive differentiation based on Maslow's framework.
