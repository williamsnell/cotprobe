Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the total waste cost for producing a certain number of modules and determining which number of modules minimizes the waste cost. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details right. The company has a fixed waste cost of $12 for up to 20 modules. Beyond that, the waste cost increases according to the function 4*(p - 20)^2, where p is the number of modules produced in excess of 20.

So part (i) is asking for the total waste cost when producing 45 modules. Part (ii) asks for the number that minimizes the waste cost.

Let's tackle part (i) first. For 45 modules, the first 20 fall under the fixed cost. So the fixed cost is $12. The remaining modules are 45 - 20 = 25 modules. 

The cost for these excess modules is calculated using the given function: 4*(p-20)^2. Here, p is 45, so p-20 is 25. Plugging that in: 4*(25)^2 = 4*625 = 2500. 

So the total waste cost is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost. That's $12 + $2500 = $2512.

Now, looking at the options, option E says $2,512 and 20 modules. But wait, part (ii) is about the number that minimizes the cost. So I need to calculate that as well.

For part (ii), we need to find the number of modules p that minimizes the total waste cost. Let me think about how the cost behaves. 

The total cost function is: 
Total cost = 12 (for p â‰¤20) 
And for p>20, it's 12 + 4*(p-20)^2.

To find the minimum, I should look at the behavior of this function. Since the function for p>20 is a quadratic function opening upwards (because the coefficient 4 is positive), the minimum occurs where the function starts increasing, but wait, actually, the function is 12 plus a term that's 4*(p-20)^2. So the minimal point of this part is at p=20, where (p-20)=0, making the term zero. So the minimal total cost would be just 12 when p=20.

Wait, but that seems off because producing more than 20 increases the cost, so the minimal cost is at p=20. So the number that minimizes the cost is 20 modules.

Looking back at the options, option E is $2,512 and 20 modules. But wait, for part (i), we calculated 45 modules gives $2,512. So in the options, part (i)'s answer is $2,512, which is option E's first part, but part (ii)'s answer is 20 modules, which is option E's second part.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each one. The options are presented as (i) and (ii) together. So the correct combination should have total cost $2512 and number 20 for (ii). Let me look again:

Option E: $2,512 and 20 modules. So that fits.

But wait, wait a second. I thought the fixed cost was $12 for up to 20 modules. So if you produce exactly 20 modules, the cost is $12. But in part (i), when producing 45, the fixed cost is still $12, and the excess is 25, making the total $2512. So that's correct for part (i).

So the correct answer for (i) is $2512, and for (ii) it's 20 modules. Looking at the options, option E matches both parts.

To determine the total waste cost for producing 45 modules and the number of modules that minimizes the waste cost, we analyze the given cost structure:

1. **Fixed Cost**: The waste cost is fixed at $12 for up to 20 modules.
2. **Variable Cost**: For modules produced beyond 20, the waste cost increases according to the function \( 4(p - 20)^2 \), where \( p \) is the total number of modules produced.

---

### Part (i): Total Waste Cost for 45 Modules
- For \( p = 45 \), the first 20 modules fall under the fixed cost of $12.
- The remaining \( 45 - 20 = 25 \) modules incur a variable cost calculated as:
  \[
  4 \times (25)^2 = 4 \times 625 = 2500
  \]
- The total waste cost is the sum of the fixed and variable costs:
  \[
  12 + 2500 = 2512
  \]

Thus, the total waste cost for producing 45 modules is **$2,512**.

---

### Part (ii): Number of Modules That Minimizes Waste Cost
The total waste cost function is:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 
\begin{cases} 
12 & \text{for } p \leq 20 \\
12 + 4(p - 20)^2 & \text{for } p > 20 
\end{cases}
\]

- For \( p \leq 20 \), the cost is constant at $12.
- For \( p > 20 \), the cost increases quadratically as \( p \) moves away from 20. The minimum cost occurs at \( p = 20 \), where the variable cost term \( 4(p - 20)^2 \) is zero.

Therefore, the number of modules that minimizes the waste cost is **20 modules**.

---

### Final Answer
The correct option is **E: $2,512 and 20 modules**.
