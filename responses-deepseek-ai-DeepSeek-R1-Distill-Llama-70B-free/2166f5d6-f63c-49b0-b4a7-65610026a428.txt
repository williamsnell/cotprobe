Question:

A man owned land along the south side of a highway. To the south of the man's land was a lot owned by a woman who lived on it in a house. Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?

Options:

A: The man, because the easement was extinguished.
B: The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.
C: The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.
D: The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about easements, and I'm a bit rusty on my property law, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is that a man owns land on the south side of a highway. South of his land is a woman's lot where she lives in a house. Five years ago, the man gave the woman a right-of-way easement over his land. The reason was that it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was clearly marked, and the document was recorded promptly.

Then, three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. But the man never took possession of the house. Two years ago, the man sold the house to a purchaser with a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved in, a neighbor told him about the easement. He started using the path, but then the man put up a barricade, so the purchaser sued, claiming he has an easement.

The question is, who will prevail: the man or the purchaser?

Hmm. I remember that easements can be appurtenant or in gross. Appurtenant easements benefit another piece of land (the dominant estate) and are transferred with the land when it's sold. In gross easements are personal and don't automatically transfer.

In this case, the easement was for the woman's lot, so it's appurtenant. So when the woman sold her house to the man, the easement should have passed with the land, right? Because the easement is appurtenant to the land, it's a right that goes with the property, not the person.

Wait, but the man became the owner of the house. But when the man then sold the house to the purchaser, the question is whether the easement would transfer again. Since the easement is appurtenant to the land (the woman's lot, now owned by the man, then by the purchaser), the purchaser should have the easement, right?

But wait, the man didn't take possession of the house when he bought it from the woman. Does that affect anything? I don't think so. Possession isn't necessary for the transfer of the easement. The ownership is what matters.

Another point is that the easement was recorded. So when the purchaser bought the house, he would have had constructive notice because the easement was on record. If the purchaser did a title search, he should have found it. But the question says the purchaser didn't know about it until the neighbor told him two months later. But in real estate law, if it's recorded, you're charged with knowledge, regardless of actual notice.

So the man sold the house to the purchaser, and the easement was part of the property. Therefore, the purchaser has the easement by operation of law because it's appurtenant and was properly recorded.

Wait, but the man is the one who originally owned the land where the easement lies. So the man's land is the servient estate, and the woman's land was the dominant estate. When the woman sold her land (the dominant estate) to the man, the easement would have been extinguished if the same person owns both estates. Because when the dominant and servient estates are unified under one ownership, the easement is typically extinguished.

Wait, that's a key point. So when the woman sold her land to the man, the dominant estate (her land) and the servient estate (the man's land) became owned by the same person. So the easement would have ended at that point because the necessity for the easement no longer exists when the same person owns both.

But wait, no, the easement was created as an appurtenant easement, so even if the owner unifies the estates, does the easement automatically terminate? Or does it only terminate if the easement is no longer necessary?

Wait, I think when the dominant and servient estates come under the same ownership, the easement is extinguished. Because the whole point of an easement is that it benefits the dominant estate over the servient. If they're both owned by the same person, there's no need for the easement anymore, so it merges and the easement ends.

So in this case, when the woman conveyed her house (the dominant estate) to the man, the same person who owned the servient estate, the easement would have been extinguished. So when the man later sold the house to the purchaser, the easement was no longer in existence. Therefore, the purchaser wouldn't have the easement because it was already extinguished when the woman sold to the man.

Wait, but the man never took possession of the house. Does that matter? I don't think so because the transfer of ownership, not possession, affects the easement.

So if the easement was extinguished when the woman sold to the man, then when the man sold to the purchaser, there was no easement left to transfer. So the purchaser doesn't have the easement.

Wait, but the question says that after the purchaser moved in, he started using the path, implying that the easement was still there. But if the easement was extinguished earlier, then the purchaser has no right.

Alternatively, did the man, as the new owner of the dominant estate, somehow retain the easement? Or was the easement terminated upon the transfer?

I think the key is that when the dominant estate and the servient estate are under the same ownership, the easement is extinguished. So in this case, when the woman sold her house to the man, the dominant estate was now owned by the man, same as the servient estate. Therefore, the easement was extinguished.

So when the man later sold the house to the purchaser, the easement was no longer in place. Therefore, the purchaser doesn't have an easement.

But wait, another angle: what if the easement was intended to benefit the land regardless of who owns it. So when the woman conveyed her land to the man, the easement would still exist because it's appurtenant. But when the same person owns both, the easement can't exist because an easement requires two separate estates. So the easement would have been extinguished.

Alternatively, perhaps the easement continues even after the ownership is unified because it's a burden on the land. But I think the majority rule is that when the dominant and servient estates are under the same ownership, the easement is extinguished.

So if that's the case, then when the man sold the house to the purchaser, the easement was already gone. Therefore, the purchaser doesn't have it, and the man can block him.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: The man, because the easement was extinguished. That seems to fit.

Option B: The man, because the purchaser didn't have actual notice. But the easement was recorded, so the purchaser had constructive notice, but that's not the main issue here. The main issue is whether the easement was still in existence when the purchaser bought the house.

Option C: Purchaser because warranty deed. But a warranty deed warrants against defects, but if the easement was already extinguished, then the deed wouldn't include that easement.

Option D: Purchaser because easement was on record. But if the easement was extinguished before the sale, then the record wouldn't matter anymore.

So the key is whether the easement was extinguished when the woman sold to the man.

I think the answer is A: The man, because the easement was extinguished.

The question revolves around the fate of an easement after changes in ownership of the dominant and servient estates. Five years ago, the man granted the woman an appurtenant easement over his land to benefit her property. The easement was recorded, providing constructive notice to subsequent purchasers. Three years later, the woman conveyed her house (the dominant estate) to the man, who then sold it to the purchaser two years later. The purchaser later discovered the easement and began using it, but the man barricaded the path, leading to a lawsuit.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Nature of the Easement**: The easement was appurtenant, meaning it benefited the woman's land (the dominant estate) and burdened the man's land (the servient estate). Appurtenant easements typically transfer with the land when the dominant estate is sold.

2. **Effect of Unity of Ownership**: When the woman sold her house (the dominant estate) to the man, the same person owned both the dominant and servient estates. Under the majority rule, when the dominant and servient estates come under the same ownership, the easement is extinguished because the necessity for the easement ceases to exist.

3. **Subsequent Sale to the Purchaser**: After the easement was extinguished, the man sold the house to the purchaser. Since the easement no longer existed at the time of the sale, it could not have been transferred to the purchaser, regardless of the warranty deed or the easement's prior recording.

4. **Constructive Notice**: Although the easement was recorded, constructive notice only applies if the easement is still in existence. Once extinguished, the recording no longer affects the rights of subsequent purchasers.

Analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The easement was extinguished when the woman sold the dominant estate to the man, as the same person then owned both estates.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The issue is not whether the purchaser had actual notice but whether the easement was extinguished before the sale.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. A warranty deed does not restore an easement that has already been extinguished.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The recording of the easement is irrelevant once it has been extinguished.

The man prevails because the easement was extinguished when the dominant and servient estates came under the same ownership.

**Answer: A**
