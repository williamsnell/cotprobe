Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about determining the enthalpy of ethane at STP using bond energies. Hmm, I remember that bond energy is the energy required to break a bond. So, I think the enthalpy of formation is calculated by looking at the bonds broken and formed during the formation of the compound.

Wait, the problem says to assume the enthalpy of solid carbon and H2 gas is zero. So ethane is C2H6, right? The formation reaction would be something like 2 C(s) + 3 H2(g) → C2H6(g). 

I need to calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction. I think the process involves breaking the bonds in the reactants and forming the bonds in the products. So, for each molecule, I'll sum the bond energies and compare the reactants and products.

Let's see. The reactants are 2 moles of solid carbon and 3 moles of H2. Since solid carbon is in its standard state, its enthalpy is zero, so we don't need to consider its bonds. H2 has H-H bonds. Each H2 molecule has one bond, so each mole of H2 has bond energy of 104.2 kcal. But wait, in the reaction, we're breaking these bonds. So for 3 moles of H2, the total energy required would be 3 * 104.2 kcal. Because bond breaking is endothermic.

Now, the products are C2H6. Let's look at the bonds in ethane. Each ethane molecule has 6 C-H bonds. So per mole of ethane, that's 6 * 98.8 kcal. Because each C-H bond is 98.8. So for one mole of ethane, that's 6 * 98.8 = let's calculate that. 98.8 *6 is 592.8 kcal. Wait, and that's bond formation, which is exothermic, so it's a release of energy. 

But wait, ethane also has a C-C bond. Oh right, each C2H6 has one C-C single bond. So each mole of ethane has 1 C-C bond. So bond energy for that is 83.1 kcal. So for one mole, it's 83.1 kcal. 

So total bond energy for ethane (products) is 592.8 + 83.1 = 675.9 kcal. 

But wait, the reaction is 2 C(s) + 3 H2 → C2H6. So in the reactants, the H2 bonds are broken, which requires energy. Then, the C-H and C-C bonds are formed, which releases energy.

So the enthalpy change (ΔH) would be the sum of the energies of the broken bonds (reactants) minus the sum of the energies of the formed bonds (products). Because bond breaking is positive (energy in) and bond forming is negative (energy out).

So ΔH = [sum of bond energies broken] - [sum of bond energies formed].

Let me compute that.

Sum of bond energies broken: 3 moles of H2, each with 104.2. So 3 * 104.2 = 312.6 kcal.

Sum of bond energies formed: 6*(C-H) +1*(C-C) = 6*98.8 + 83.1 = 592.8 +83.1 = 675.9 kcal.

So ΔH = 312.6 - 675.9 = -363.3 kcal. Wait, negative? That would mean the reaction is exothermic, which makes sense because forming bonds releases energy.

But wait, the question says "determine the enthalpy of ethane at STP." Wait, the enthalpy of formation of ethane would be this ΔH value, right? Because the reactants have zero enthalpy.

So the enthalpy is -363.3 kcal. But wait, looking at the options, the choices are all positive except H, which is -19.9. Hmm, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I got the reaction backwards. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is the change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements. So the reaction is correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the bond energies. Let me double-check the bond energies from the table provided.

Looking back:

H-H bond is 104.2 kcal/mol.

C-H is 98.8.

C-C is 83.1.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, in the reaction, the carbon is solid. So the bonds in solid carbon aren't being broken, right? Because the problem states that the enthalpy of solid carbon is zero. So I don't need to consider any bonds in solid carbon, only the bonds broken in H2 and the bonds formed in ethane.

So the calculation seems correct: 3*104.2 = 312.6 (bonds broken) and 6*98.8 +83.1 = 675.9 (bonds formed). So ΔH is 312.6 - 675.9 = -363.3 kcal.

But looking at the options, I don't see -363.3. The options are A to J as listed.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recalculate.

H2 bonds: 3 moles * 104.2 = 312.6.

Ethane: 6 *98.8 = 592.8, plus 83.1 = 675.9.

312.6 - 675.9 = -363.3.

Hmm, none of the options match. Wait, maybe I should consider the reverse. Maybe the answer is positive. But why?

Wait, wait. The problem says 'determine the enthalpy of ethane at STP.' Wait, maybe it's the enthalpy of combustion? No, the question says it's the enthalpy of ethane, I think it refers to the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think: the formula for ΔH is [bond energies broken] - [bond energies formed]. Because bond breaking is endothermic (positive) and bond forming is exothermic (negative). So yes, 312.6 (bonds broken H2) minus 675.9 (bonds formed in ethane) is -363.3.

But the options don't have this. Let me see the options again:

Looking back:

Options:

A: 254.1

B: 532.7

C: 656

D:589.3

E:420.8

F:128.2

G:712.5

H: -19.9

I:675.9

J:343.4

Wait, option I is 675.9, which is the sum of the bonds in ethane. Hmm, but that's just the bond energies of ethane, not the enthalpy change. So I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait another approach: maybe the problem is considering the enthalpy of ethane as the bond dissociation energy, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's the reverse reaction, like decomposing ethane into C and H2.

Wait, no, the question is about the formation of ethane. So perhaps the correct approach is correct, but maybe I have the wrong numbers.

Wait, let me check the bond energies again.

The bond energies given:

H-H: 104.2

C-H: 98.8

C-C: 83.1

Yes, that's correct.

So sum for ethane: 6 *98.8 = 592.8, plus 83.1 gives 675.9. Then, the bonds broken in H2: 3 *104.2=312.6.

ΔH = 312.6 - 675.9 = -363.3.

Wait, but where is this value in the options? It's not there. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the question says "enthalpy of ethane" but actually refers to bond energy, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps they're asking for the bond energy of ethane, but the question clearly says "enthalpy of ethane at STP", which would be enthalpy of formation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider something else. Oh wait, maybe I should use the standard enthalpies of formation for elements as zero, which I did, but perhaps I should have considered the bond energies in the opposite way.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the stability of ethane, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the bonds in ethane as the sum of all bonds, which is 675.9, but that's the total bond energy. The enthalpy of formation is the difference between reactants and products.

Wait, maybe I have the formula reversed. Maybe ΔH is [bonds formed] - [bonds broken]. Let me think. Because when bonds are broken, energy is absorbed (positive), and bonds formed release energy (negative). So ΔH is (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed). Because:

ΔH = (energy required to break bonds) - (energy released when forming bonds)

So that's 312.6 - 675.9 = -363.3.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total bond energy of ethane as its enthalpy. So 675.9. So looking at the options, option I is 675.9. But that would be just the sum of the bond energies, not the enthalpy change.

Hmm, but why would the question be asking for the sum of bond energies as the enthalpy? That doesn't make much sense. The enthalpy of formation is the value we calculated, but since it's not present as an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of combustion, but that's not what it says. The question says 'enthalpy of ethane at STP' which probably refers to the standard enthalpy of formation.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of bonds. Let me recount. Ethane is C2H6.

Each molecule has a C-C single bond, and each C is bonded to 3 H's. So 6 C-H bonds per molecule.

So per mole, 6 moles of C-H bonds and 1 mole of C-C bonds. So yes, 6 *98.8 = 592.8 and 83.1 added gives 675.9.

Wait, but perhaps in the reaction, for 2 moles of C(s), we need to form C-C and C-H bonds. So perhaps the number of C(s) is involved. Wait, but the bond energies are per mole of bonds, so that's accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the enthalpy of formation, but the bond dissociation energy of ethane. But that's not what's being asked.

Alternatively, I might have mixed up the sign. If the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation, which is exothermic, so negative, but the options don't have -363.3. So perhaps I need to re-examine the bond energies.

Wait, looking back at the bond energies provided in the question. Let me make sure I didn't read any wrong.

The table says:

H-H 104.2

H-I 71.4

C-C 83.1

C-N 69.7

Cl-Cl 58.0

C-O 84.0

Br-Br 46.1

C-Cl 78.5

I-I 36.1

C-Br 65.9

C-H 98.8

C-I 57.4

N-H 93.4

O-O 33.2

O-H 110.6

N≡N 226

H-Cl 103.2

C=C 147

H-Br 87.5

C≡C 194.

Yes, those are correct. So I think my calculation is right, but perhaps the answer isn't among the options. That can't be, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the question is about the standard enthalpy of formation per mole of ethane. So perhaps I should check if the calculation is per mole. Yes, it is. So the value is -363.3 kcal per mole.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H: -19.9, which is way off. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of ethane formation requires 2 moles of C(s) and 3 moles of H2. So the enthalpy would be per mole of ethane, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each C in ethane has four bonds. Wait, no, I think I accounted for all the bonds correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy being the sum of the bond energies in the molecule. So ethane has 7 bonds (6 C-H and 1 C-C), totaling 675.9 kcal. So option I is 675.9. But that's just the sum of the bond energies, not the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but the question is about the enthalpy of ethane, not the enthalpy of formation. Hmm, perhaps the enthalpy of ethane is its heat of formation from elements in their standard states. So that's what I calculated as -363.3 kcal/mol.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total bond energy, which would be 675.9, which is option I.

Wait, the question says "determine the enthalpy of ethane at STP." Hmm, maybe "enthalpy" here refers to the total bond energy, which is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule. So that would be 6*(C-H) + 1*(C-C) = 675.9 kcal/mol. So option I.

But why would the question refer to bond energy as enthalpy? That's confusing. Because the enthalpy of formation is a different concept. Maybe the question is using the term "enthalpy" incorrectly, perhaps they mean the bond energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again. If I have 675.9, that's option I. But if I did the calculation correctly for the enthalpy of formation, it's -363.3, which isn't present. So perhaps the intended answer is option I, 675.9 kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option I.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's asking for the bond energy of ethane, which would be 675.9. So the answer would be I.

But I'm a bit confused because the terminology seems off. Enthalpy of ethane at STP would usually refer to its standard enthalpy of formation, which is exothermic. But that's not among the options except H, which is a small negative value.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have considered that each H2 molecule contributes 104.2 per mole of bonds. So 3 H2 molecules would be 3 * 104.2 = 312.6 kcal. Then, the bonds formed in ethane are 6 C-H (6 *98.8=592.8) plus 1 C-C (83.1) = 675.9. So ΔH is 312.6 - 675.9 = -363.3.

But -363.3 is not an option. Hmm. Maybe the question expects the sum of the bonds, which is option I: 675.9.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of H2 molecules. Wait, ethane has 6 H atoms, so 3 H2 molecules are needed. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should have considered the reaction as 2 C (graphite) → 2 C (in ethane). But no, the enthalpy of formation is based on elements in standard states.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of combustion, but the question doesn't say that. No, the question specifically says "enthalpy of ethane at STP," which refers to the standard enthalpy of formation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using different units. The bond energies are given in kcal per gram mole, so my calculation is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. The only option near 675 is option I:675.9.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the bond energies for breaking instead of forming. Wait, no, because the bonds in the products are formed, releasing energy.

I'm really not sure. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is I:675.9 kcal, which is the sum of the bond energies in ethane. So I'll go with that.

To determine the enthalpy of ethane (C₂H₆) at STP, we use the bond energy table and calculate the enthalpy of formation. The reaction for the formation of ethane from its elements is:

\[
2 \, \text{C(s)} + 3 \, \text{H}_2 \, \text{(g)} \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_6 \, \text{(g)}
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Bond Energies**:
   - **Reactants**:
     - H-H bonds in 3 moles of H₂: \( 3 \times 104.2 = 312.6 \, \text{kcal} \).
   - **Products**:
     - 6 C-H bonds in C₂H₆: \( 6 \times 98.8 = 592.8 \, \text{kcal} \).
     - 1 C-C bond in C₂H₆: \( 83.1 \, \text{kcal} \).
     - Total bond energy for C₂H₆: \( 592.8 + 83.1 = 675.9 \, \text{kcal} \).

2. **Enthalpy Change (ΔH)**:
   - ΔH is calculated as the energy required to break bonds (reactants) minus the energy released when bonds form (products):
     \[
     \Delta H = \text{Bonds Broken} - \text{Bonds Formed} = 312.6 - 675.9 = -363.3 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

3. **Interpretation**:
   - The
