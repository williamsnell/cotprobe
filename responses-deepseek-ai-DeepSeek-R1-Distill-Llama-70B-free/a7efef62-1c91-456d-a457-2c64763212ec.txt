Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about existential neurosis and logotherapy. I'm a bit rusty on these topics, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that existential neurosis is related to existential psychology. From what I've read before, existentialism deals with themes like meaning, purpose, and existence. So, existential neurosis probably has something to do with people feeling a lack of meaning or purpose in life.

I think Viktor Frankl is associated with logotherapy. If I recall correctly, Frankl was a Holocaust survivor and wrote "Man's Search for Meaning." In that book, he talks about how people need to find meaning in life even in the most dire circumstances. So logotherapy must be the approach he developed to help people find that meaning.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says existential neurosis is about the thrill of extreme sports. That doesn't sound right. Extreme sports are more about adrenaline, not existential issues.

Option B mentions extreme happiness. That's the opposite of what I was thinking. Existential neurosis should relate to negative feelings, not happiness.

Option C talks about logotherapy focusing on physical health. No, Frankl's work was psychological, not physical.

Option D says logotherapy is about interpreting dreams. That's more Freudian psychoanalysis, not logotherapy.

Option E links existential neurosis to physical inactivity. Doesn't fit with the psychological aspects I remember.

Option F describes heightened sensory perception and creativity. That sounds more like something related to art or maybe a different condition, not neurosis.

Option G says logotherapy is group therapy. I don't think so; logotherapy is more individual-focused, helping each person find their own meaning.

Option H states that existential neurosis involves a sense of meaninglessness, loneliness, etc., and logotherapy helps find purpose. This aligns with what I remember about Frankl's theories. So this seems correct.

Option I talks about excessive euphoria, which again is the opposite of what neurosis would imply.

Option J mentions a dietary regimen. No, that's unrelated to logotherapy.

So putting it all together, option H is the correct answer.

The correct answer is H because it accurately describes existential neurosis as a condition involving feelings of meaninglessness and logotherapy as a treatment aimed at helping individuals find life's purpose.

Answer: H
