Okay, so I've got this question about the Federal Reserve and money creation. Hmm, I remember that when the Fed increases bank reserves, it's usually part of monetary policy to influence the money supply. But the question is about what would diminish the potential amount of money created. I'm a bit rusty, so I need to think through this carefully.

The question asks, under what condition is the money creation potential reduced when the Fed boosts bank reserves. The options are A to E. Let me break it down.

I think about the money multiplier effect. The basic idea is that when banks have more reserves, they can lend more, which increases the money supply. But the actual multiplier depends on how much of those reserves the banks decide to keep as excess reserves versus lending out.

So if depository institutions (banks) decide to hold more excess reserves, they're not using those reserves to make loans. That means the money multiplier is smaller. Because each dollar that's held back as excess reserves can't be lent out and multiplied through the economy. So the potential money creation would be less than if the banks lent out a larger portion.

Looking at the options:

A: Public holds less cash. Wait, if people hold less cash, that means they're depositing more into banks. That could increase the money supply because banks have more deposits to lend out. So this might actually increase money creation, not diminish it. So A might not be the right answer.

B: The Fed decreases the money supply. Wait, the question says the Fed is increasing bank reserves. If the Fed is doing that, but then also decreasing money supply elsewhere, that might complicate things. Not sure about this one. Maybe it's a trick option. But the question is about what diminishes the potential, so maybe B isn't the main factor here.

C: Depositories hold less excess reserves. If they hold less, that means they're lending more, which would increase the money supply. So this would mean more money creation, not less. So C is the opposite of what we're looking for.

D: Velocity of money increases. Velocity is how often money is spent. If velocity increases, each dollar is used more, effectively increasing the money supply. So this would actually lead to more money creation, not less. So D isn't the answer.

E: Depositories hold more excess reserves. Oh right, as I thought earlier. If banks hold more excess reserves, they aren't lending as much. So each dollar of reserves doesn't get multiplied as much. So the potential money created is less. That makes E the correct answer.

So the correct answer should be E.

The question asks under what condition the potential amount of money created after the Fed increases bank reserves would be diminished. The key factor here is the behavior of depository institutions regarding their excess reserves. When the Fed increases bank reserves, the money creation potential depends on how much of those reserves banks choose to lend out rather than hold as excess reserves. If banks decide to hold more excess reserves, they are not using those reserves to make loans, which reduces the money multiplier effect and thus diminishes the potential money creation.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: If the public holds less cash, more money flows into banks, potentially increasing lending and money creation. This does not diminish money creation.
- **B**: The Fed decreasing the money supply is unrelated to the scenario where the Fed is increasing bank reserves. This is not the correct answer.
- **C**: If banks hold less excess reserves, they lend more, increasing money creation. This is the opposite of what the question asks.
- **D**: An increase in the velocity of money means each dollar is spent more frequently, effectively increasing the money supply. This does not diminish money creation.
- **E**: If banks hold more excess reserves, they lend less, reducing the money multiplier and diminishing the potential money creation. This is the correct answer.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.

Answer: E
