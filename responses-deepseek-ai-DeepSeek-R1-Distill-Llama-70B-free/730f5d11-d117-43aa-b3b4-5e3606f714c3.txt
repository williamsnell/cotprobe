Okay, let's tackle this insurance refund problem step by step. So, Mr. I.F. Sarbo bought a fire insurance policy for his home, paying an annual premium of $32 on July 17. Then, on September 22, he decided to cancel the policy. The question is asking how much refund he should get.

Hmm, I remember that when you cancel an insurance policy, you usually get a prorated refund based on the time you've already used. So the key here is to calculate how much of the policy term has passed and determine the refund accordingly.

First, I need to figure out the period between July 17 and September 22. But wait, how many days are there in each month? July has 31 days, August has 31, and September has 30. But wait, since the policy starts on July 17, I think we count from that day, including it, up to but not including the next day.

So let's break it down month by month. From July 17 to July 31: that's 31 - 17 = 14 days. Wait, no, because July 17 is day 1, so it's 14 days left in July after the 17th? Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. If you start on the 17th, then the days in July would be from the 17th to the 31st, inclusive. So that's 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. Oh right, because including both the start and end days.

Then, August has 31 days, and September 1 to September 22 is 22 days. So total days would be 15 (July) + 31 (August) + 22 (September) = 68 days.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because the policy is canceled on September 22, which is the end date. So the period covered would be from July 17 to September 22, which is 68 days. Or wait, does the cancellation date count as part of the period? Hmm, I think when you cancel on a certain day, you don't get charged for that day, but I'm not entirely sure. But in most cases, the refund is for the unused period, so the days from the start to the day before cancellation. So maybe it's up to September 21, but the question says he canceled on September 22. So perhaps the period covered is from July 17 to September 21, making it 67 days. But sometimes, companies might calculate based on full months or use a different method, but the question here seems to be expecting a daily proration.

Wait, let me double-check. The total policy term is annual, so 365 days. The premium is $32 per year. So each day's premium would be 32 / 365 dollars.

Let me calculate the number of days between July 17 and September 22. 

July 17 to July 31: that's 31 - 17 = 14 days, but since the 17th is day 1, it's 15 days (including both days).

August has 31 days.

September 1 to September 22 is 22 days.

So 15 + 31 + 22 = 68 days.

Wait, but if the cancellation is on September 22, does that day count as part of the coverage? Hmm, maybe the period covered is 68 days, and the refund is for the remaining days.

So total days in a year: 365.

Days used: 68.

Days remaining: 365 - 68 = 297 days.

So the refund would be (297 / 365) * 32.

Alternatively, sometimes companies might calculate it as the used days and charge for those, then refund the rest. So the amount charged would be (68 / 365) * 32, and the refund is the annual premium minus that.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, he paid $32, then canceled after 68 days, so he's entitled to a refund for the unused period. So the refund amount would be (unused days / total days) * premium.

So unused days: 365 -68 = 297.

So 297 / 365 = approximately 0.8137.

Multiply by $32: 0.8137 *32 ≈ 26.038.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are close to $26. Wait, the options are A:12, B:14.72, C:6.44, D:16.64, E:32, F:22.72, G:24, H:9.28, I:19.68, J:18.36.

Hmm, none of these are near 26. So I must have made a mistake in calculating the days.

Wait, perhaps the months are being considered in another way. Let me recount the days.

July: from the 17th to the 31st, inclusive. So that's 31 - 17 +1 = 15 days.

August: 31 days.

September: 1st to 22nd, inclusive. So 22 days.

Total: 15+31+22=68 days.

Wait, but maybe the policy is being considered as term from July 17 to July 17 next year, so the total days would be 365. But perhaps I should calculate the exact number of days between July 17 and September 22.

Wait, another approach: using date difference.

July 17 to September 22.

July has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31: 15 days.

Then August has 31, and up to September 22: 22 days.

So 15 +31+22=68 days.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different method, like counting the days from July 17 to September 22 as follows:

July: 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31 is 15 days.

August: 31 days.

September: 22 days.

So same as before: 15+31+22=68.

Hmm, but the options don't have a $26 option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the days. Maybe the months are being considered in another way, like 30 days each? No, that's not accurate because July and August have 31 days, September has 30.

Wait, let me check if I'm including or excluding the end date correctly. If the policy was canceled on September 22, does that mean that the coverage ended on September 21? Because you can't be covered on the day you cancel. So maybe the days used are 67.

Wait, let me recount:

July: 15 days (17 to 31 inclusive).

August: 31 days.

September: 1 to 22 is 22 days, but if the cancellation is on the 22nd, maybe the coverage ends on the 21st. So September would be 21 days.

So total days: 15 +31 +21=67 days.

Then, unused days: 365 -67=298.

Refund: (298/365)*32.

Calculate 298/365: Approximately 0.816.

32 *0.816= approximately 26.112. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the company calculates based on months instead of days. Let me think: from July 17 to September 22 is how many months?

July: from 17th to end: about 15 days, which is almost half a month.

August: full month.

September: 22 days, which is almost full month.

So perhaps the company charges for full months used.

In that case, how many full months have passed?

From July 17 to August 17: that's one full month.

Then August 17 to September 17: another full month.

Then from September 17 to September 22: 5 days, which they might not count as a full month.

So total of 2 full months and 5 days.

If the company charges per full month, then 2 months would be (2/12)*32= $5.333 per month, so 2 months would be ~10.666. But that's the amount he's used, so the refund would be 32 -10.666= ~21.333. But looking at the options, F is $22.72, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe they calculate the exact fraction of the year based on the days, but perhaps using a 360-day year for simplification. Let me try that.

360 days a year.

68 days used.

So used fraction: 68/360= 0.1889.

So used amount: 32 * 0.1889 ≈6.06. So refund would be 32 -6.06=25.94. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the company calculates based on exact days but rounds to the nearest cent. Let me calculate 68 days.

365 days.

68/365 = 0.1863 (approximately).

So the used amount is 32 * 0.1863 ≈5.97. So the refund is 32 -5.97=26.03.

Again, no option near $26.

Wait, perhaps the policy was canceled on September 22, so the coverage was up to September 21, making it 67 days.

67/365 = 0.1836.

Used amount:32 *0.1836≈5.875. So refund is 32 -5.875=26.125.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between the dates.

Wait, perhaps using another method: let's calculate the days from July 17 to September 22.

July has 31 days, so from July 17 to July 31 is 15 days (including 17th and 31st).

August has 31 days.

September 1 to September 22 is 22 days.

So 15 +31 +22 =68 days.

Wait, but perhaps the correct count is 67 days because when you cancel on the 22nd, the last day covered is the 21st. So 22 days in September would be up to the 22nd, but maybe you only get charged up to the 21st. So September would be 21 days, making total days 15+31+21=67.

So 67 days used.

67/365 = 0.1836.

Used premium:32 *0.1836 ≈5.875.

Refund:32 -5.875=26.125.

Still not matching any options. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is $19.68, option G is $24, etc. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the policy is considered as a 12-month policy, but the refund is calculated based on the short-rate method, which is more complex and might involve a penalty for early cancellation. The short-rate method refunds a proportionally smaller amount because it factors in acquisition costs.

The formula for short-rate refund is:

Refund = (Unexpired Percentage) * (Premium) - (Short Rate Factor * Premium)

But I'm not sure about the exact factors here. Alternatively, the short-rate method might be:

Refund = (Unexpired %) * (Premium) - (pro-rata for time covered) * something.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the proportion of the year that has passed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the policy is for 12 months, and the refund is based on the number of months lapsed, using a 360-day year, which is common in some calculations.

So let me try that.

From July 17 to September 22.

July 17 to August 17: 31-17=14 days, but using a 30-day month, that's 14/30 = 0.4667 months.

August: full month.

September 1 to September 22: 22 days. Assuming 30 days in September, 22/30=0.7333.

Total months: 0.4667 +1 +0.7333=2.2 months.

So 2.2 months out of 12.

Used premium: (2.2/12)*32 = (11/60)*32 = approximately 5.8667.

So refund would be 32 -5.8667≈26.1333.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the insurance company uses a different approach, like charging for the full month if any days in the month are used. So for example, if you cancel in September, they charge for the full month of September, regardless of the day.

So let's see:

July: started on 17th, so charge for July as a full month.

August: full month.

September: charged as full month? But he canceled on September 22, so perhaps they only charge for the days in September up to the 22nd, or charge the full month.

If they charge full months plus days, but perhaps they only charge for full months. So for any part of a month, they charge the full month.

In that case, from July 17 to end of July: charge 1 month.

August: charge 1 month.

September: since he canceled on the 22nd, they might charge for September as a full month.

So total months charged: 3 months.

3/12=0.25, so used premium is 32*0.25=8.

Refund is 32-8=24.

Looking at the options, G is $24.00. So that might be the answer.

But wait, why would they charge for September as a full month if he only used 22 days? Maybe because the policy was in effect for part of September, so they charge the full month. Alternatively, some companies might prorate the days in the last month.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the refund is calculated based on the number of full months remaining. So if the policy was canceled partway through a month, they might not refund for that month.

Wait, in that case, he's used July (full month), August (full), and part of September. So they might have charged for 2 full months and part of the third. But without knowing the exact company's method, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the company calculates based on the exact days and rounds to the nearest dollar or cent.

Wait, let me try another calculation. 68 days used.

32 * (68/365) = ?

Compute 68/365:

68 ÷ 365 = 0.1863 approximately.

32 * 0.1863 ≈5.962.

So the used amount is ~$5.96, so refund is 32 -5.96=26.04.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the policy is considered as 360 days instead of 365. Let's try that.

68 days /360 = 0.1889.

32 *0.1889≈6.04.

So refund would be 32-6.04=25.96. Still not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the policy is for 12 months, but the months are considered as 30 days each. So each month is 30 days, making 360 days a year.

So let's calculate the days in this way.

July 17 to July 31: 14 days (since 30-17+1=14? Wait, 17 to 30 is 14 days including both? Wait, no: from day 1 to day 30 is 30 days. So from 17 to 30 is 14 days (30-17+1=14? Wait, 17,18,...30: that's 14 days including both. Yes.

August: 30 days.

September: 1 to 22 is 22 days.

Total:14+30+22=66 days.

Wait, that's different. So 66 days.

66/360=0.1833.

So used premium:32 *0.1833≈5.866.

Refund:32 -5.866≈26.134.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: $12.00

B:$14.72

C:$6.44

D:$16.64

E:$32

F:$22.72

G:$24.00

H:$9.28

I:$19.68

J:$18.36

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done on a monthly basis, charging for full months, but refunding for extra days.

Wait, let's think: from July 17 to September 22.

July: 15 days (including 17 and 31).

August:31 days.

September:22 days.

Total:68 days.

So 68 days is about 2.23 months (since 68/30≈2.2667).

So if the company charges for 2 full months and part of the third.

So 2 months would be 2/12=1/6 of the premium: 32*(1/6)=5.333.

Plus the days in September:22 days.

So 22 days is 22/30 of a month: 0.7333.

So total used: 5.333 + (32*0.7333)=5.333 +23.466≈28.8. Wait, but that can't be right because the total premium is 32, and you can't have used more than that.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Each month is 1/12 of the premium.

So for each full month, it's 32/12 ≈2.6667 per month.

So for July: he started on the 17th, so for 15 days. Maybe they charge for half a month: ~1.3333.

August: full month: ~2.6667.

September: 22 days. 22/30≈0.7333, so 32/12 *0.7333≈(2.6667)*(0.7333)≈1.9567.

So total used:1.3333 +2.6667 +1.9567≈5.9567.

So refund is 32 -5.9567≈26.0433.

Again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a different method, like the 30-day month assumption.

Let me try that. So each month is 30 days.

July: from 17 to 30:14 days. So 14/30=0.4667 months.

August:30 days=1 month.

September:22 days=22/30≈0.7333 months.

Total:0.4667+1+0.7333=2.2 months.

So used premium: (2.2/12)*32= (11/60)*32≈5.8667.

Refund:32 -5.8667≈26.1333.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to calculate based on the number of months, but using exact days.

Wait, let me try calculating 68 days as a fraction of 365.

68/
