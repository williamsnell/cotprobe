Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a muon decaying. Hmm, I remember that muons are elementary particles, right? And they have a short lifetime, which is given here as 2e-6 seconds in their rest frame. Oh wait, but they're moving at a high speed, so I think I need to use special relativity here, specifically time dilation.

The question says the muon is created 100 km above the Earth and is moving towards it at 2.97e8 m/s. I need to find the altitude where it decays. So, the decay happens after a certain time as observed from Earth, but because the muon is moving fast, its own lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Or wait, no, actually, from Earth's frame, the muon's lifetime is longer. Because in their rest frame, it's 2e-6 s, but from Earth, it's dilated.

Wait, let me think. The proper time is the lifetime in the muon's rest frame, which is 2e-6 s. The Earth sees the muon's clock running slower, so the lifetime is longer. So the time experienced on Earth (the dilated time) would be gamma multiplied by the proper time.

Right, so I need to compute gamma first. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, what's the speed of light here? Approximately 3e8 m/s. Oh wait, the muon's speed is 2.97e8 m/s. So v is 0.99c, because 2.97e8 is 99% of 3e8. Because 3e8 times 0.99 is 2.97e8. So v = 0.99c.

So let me compute gamma. Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.99)^2). Let's compute (0.99)^2. That’s 0.9801. So 1 - 0.9801 = 0.0199. The square root of 0.0199 is approximately 0.141. So gamma is 1/0.141, which is roughly 7.09. Wait, more accurately, let me calculate it properly.

Wait, 0.0199 is 1.99e-2. The square root is sqrt(1.99e-2) = sqrt(0.0199). Let me compute that. I remember that sqrt(0.02) is about 0.1414. So 0.0199 is just a little less than 0.02, so sqrt(0.0199) is approximately 0.141, same as before. So gamma is about 7.09.

Wait, but let me be precise. Alternative calculation: (0.99)^2 = 0.9801. So 1 - 0.9801 = 0.0199. sqrt(0.0199) ≈ 0.141. So gamma ≈ 1/0.141 ≈ 7.09. So I'll take gamma as approximately 7.09.

Now, the lifetime from Earth's frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So t = gamma * t_0 = 7.09 * 2e-6 s = 1.418e-5 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that again. 7.09 * 2e-6 is 14.18e-6 s, which is 1.418e-5 seconds.

Now, the muon is moving towards Earth at 2.97e8 m/s. So the distance it covers before decaying is velocity multiplied by time. So distance = v * t.

Plugging in the numbers: 2.97e8 m/s * 1.418e-5 s. Let me compute this. 2.97e8 is 2.97 * 1e8, and 1.418e-5 is 1.418 * 1e-5.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.97 * 1.418. Let me compute that. 2.97 * 1.4 is approximately 4.158. And 2.97 * 0.018 is approximately 0.05346. So total is about 4.158 + 0.05346 = 4.21146. So approximately 4.21.

Now, multiplying the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-5 = 1e3. So 4.21 * 1e3 is 4210 meters. Because 1e3 is 1000, so 4210 meters is 4.21 kilometers.

Wait, but wait a second, the muon was created 100 km above Earth. So the distance it travels before decaying is 4.21 km. So the altitude where it decays would be 100 km minus 4.21 km, which is 95.79 km. But wait, none of the options are close to 95.

Hmm, that can't be right because the options are all under 15 km or so. Oh wait, no, I'm making a mistake here. Wait, the problem says to find the altitude at which it decays. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps I should consider the distance the muon travels in the lab frame, but maybe I'm forgetting something about length contraction.

Wait, no, because the muon's lifetime is longer in the Earth's frame, so it can travel a longer distance. So the calculation I did was correct, but the problem is that if the muon is moving at 0.99c and the lifetime is dilated, then the distance is v * t = 2.97e8 m/s * 1.418e-5 s ≈ 4.21e3 meters, which is 4.21 km. So the muon would decay after moving 4.21 km towards Earth, so its altitude would be 100 km - 4.21 km = 95.79 km. But none of the options are near 95. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute v = 0.99c. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.99)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9801) = 1/sqrt(0.0199). Let me compute this more accurately.

The square root of 0.0199 is approximately 0.141067. So gamma is 1 / 0.141067 ≈ 7.0888. Let me use more precise gamma, say 7.0888.

So t = gamma * t_0 = 7.0888 * 2e-6 s = 1.41776e-5 s.

Then distance is v * t = 2.97e8 m/s * 1.41776e-5 s.

Calculating that:

2.97e8 * 1.41776e-5 = ?

2.97 * 1.41776 = let's compute that. 2 * 1.41776 is 2.83552, and 0.97 * 1.41776 is approximately 1.375. So total is about 2.83552 + 1.375 ≈ 4.21052.

So 4.21052e3 meters, which is 4.21052 kilometers. So about 4.21 km.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near 4.21 km. Wait, looking at the options: A is 4.2, which is very close. But wait, the question is, what is the altitude where it decays?

Wait, wait, the muon is created at 100 km, and it travels towards Earth, so the decay occurs after moving 4.21 km downward. So the altitude is 100 km - 4.21 km = 95.79 km. But the options don't have that. So this must mean I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Oh! Wait, maybe the question is asking, from the Earth's frame, how far does the muon travel before decaying. But the options are about the altitude, so 4.2 km would be the distance from the point of creation, so the altitude would be 100 km - 4.2 km = 95.8 km, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the muon's lifetime in its own frame, so the distance would be shorter due to length contraction. Wait, no, because from Earth's frame, the muon's lifetime is longer, so it can travel further. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the velocity is 0.99c, so v = 0.99 * 3e8 m/s = 2.97e8 m/s. Then, gamma is 7.0888 as before.

So time in Earth's frame: t = gamma * t0 = 7.0888 * 2e-6 s ≈ 1.4177e-5 s.

Distance: v * t = 2.97e8 m/s * 1.4177e-5 s = (2.97 * 1.4177) * 1e3 m.

2.97 * 1.4177 is approximately 4.21, so 4.21e3 m = 4.21 km.

Wait, so if the muon was created at 100 km, and it travels 4.21 km towards Earth, it decays at 100 - 4.21 = 95.79 km. But the options don't have that.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says, "At what altitude in km does it decay?" So perhaps the answer is 4.21 km, but that's not one of the options. Wait, option A is 4.2, which is close. But why would the altitude be 4.2 km? That would mean it decayed 95.8 km below the starting point, but the starting point was 100 km above Earth's surface. So if it decayed at 4.2 km, that would mean it traveled 100 -4.2 = 95.8 km, which matches our calculation. So the altitude is 4.2 km above Earth's surface.

Wait, no, wait. If the muon is created 100 km above Earth and moves downward, then the altitude where it decays is 100 km minus the distance it traveled. So if it traveled 4.21 km, then the altitude is 95.79 km. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the muon's lifetime is measured in its own frame, and due to time dilation, the Earth observes a longer lifetime, allowing the muon to travel further. But perhaps I should consider length contraction from the muon's frame. Wait, no, in the muon's frame, the Earth is approaching at 0.99c, and the distance to Earth is contracted. So the distance would be shorter, so the Earth would reach the muon faster.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the distance in the muon's frame. Let's see: in the muon's rest frame, the lifetime is 2e-6 s. So the time available is 2e-6 s, and the Earth is approaching at v = 0.99c. But the distance between the muon and Earth is length-contracted. The proper length (from Earth's frame) is 100 km. So in the muon's frame, the distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 100 km * sqrt(1 - 0.99²) ≈ 100 km * sqrt(0.0199) ≈ 100 km * 0.141 ≈ 14.1 km.

So in the muon's frame, the Earth is approaching at 0.99c, and the distance is 14.1 km. So the time until the Earth reaches the muon is distance divided by speed: t = 14.1e3 m / (2.97e8 m/s) ≈ 4.76e-5 s. Wait, but the muon's lifetime is 2e-6 s, so 4.76e-5 s is longer than the lifetime. So the muon would decay before the Earth reaches it. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the muon doesn't reach Earth, which contradicts the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the two frames. Let me clarify:

In Earth's frame:

- Muon lifetime is dilated: t = gamma * t0 = 7.0888 * 2e-6 ≈ 1.4177e-5 s.

- Distance traveled: v * t = 2.97e8 * 1.4177e-5 ≈ 4.21e3 m = 4.21 km. So the muon decays 4.21 km below its starting point, so altitude is 100 km - 4.21 km = 95.79 km.

But the options don't have 95.79. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of gamma again. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.99c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9801) = 1/sqrt(0.0199).

Compute 0.0199: sqrt(0.0199) = let's compute it precisely.

We know that 0.141^2 = 0.019881.

So 0.141^2 = 0.019881, which is very close to 0.0199. So sqrt(0.0199) ≈ 0.141067.

So gamma ≈ 1 / 0.141067 ≈ 7.0888.

So that part is correct.

Then, t = gamma * t0 = 7.0888 * 2e-6 s = 1.41776e-5 s.

Distance: v * t = 2.97e8 m/s * 1.41776e-5 s = (2.97 * 1.41776) * 1e3 m.

Compute 2.97 * 1.41776:

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

1.41776 * 3 = 4.25328.

But since it's 2.97, that's 3 - 0.03.

So 1.41776 * 2.97 = 1.41776 * (3 - 0.03) = 4.25328 - (1.41776 * 0.03).

Compute 1.41776 * 0.03 = 0.0423328.

So 4.25328 - 0.0423328 = 4.2109472.

So the distance is 4.2109472e3 meters, which is 4.2109472 km.

So the muon travels approximately 4.21 km towards Earth, so the altitude is 100 km - 4.21 km = 95.79 km. But the options don't have 95.79 km. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the options are all much lower. Let me look again: A is 4.2, B is 7.5, etc. So maybe I should be calculating the distance the muon travels as observed from Earth, which is 4.21 km, so the altitude is 4.21 km above Earth, but that would mean it's at 4.21 km, but the starting point was 100 km. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking how far the muon travels, not the altitude. But the question says, "at what altitude does it decay." So the altitude should be 100 km minus the distance traveled, which is 95.79 km. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check the initial data.

The muon's lifetime is 2e-6 seconds. Speed is 2.97e8 m/s. Created at 100 km above Earth.

Wait, perhaps the calculation uses c as exactly 3e8 m/s, so 2.97e8 is 0.99c. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the time calculation. Let me compute t = gamma * t0.

Wait, t0 is 2e-6 s. Gamma is 7.0888. So 7.0888 * 2e-6 = 1.41776e-5 s.

Then, distance is v * t = 2.97e8 * 1.41776e-5.

Wait, 2.97e8 is 297,000,000 m/s. 1.41776e-5 s is 0.0000141776 s.

Multiplying these: 297,000,000 * 0.0000141776.

Let me compute 297e6 * 1.41776e-5.

Compute 297 * 1.41776 = ?

Let's compute 297 * 1.41776:

Break it down: 200 * 1.41776 = 283.552.

97 * 1.41776: Let's compute 100 * 1.41776 = 141.776, then subtract 3 * 1.41776 = 4.25328. So 141.776 - 4.25328 = 137.52272.

So total is 283.552 + 137.52272 = 421.07472.

So 421.07472e3 meters, which is 421.07472 km? Wait, no, because 297e6 m/s * 1.41776e-5 s = (297 * 1.41776) * 1e3 m.

Wait, 1e3 is 1000, so 421.07472 * 1e3 m = 421,074.72 meters, which is 421.07472 km. Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation said 4.21 km. Wait, no, I think I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 297e6 m/s = 2.97e8 m/s.

1.41776e-5 s is 1.41776e-5.

So 2.97e8 * 1.41776e-5 = (2.97 * 1.41776) * 1e8 * 1e-5 = (4.2109472) * 1e3 = 4.210
