Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: There are 72 students on the dance team, and 4 over 9 take tap lessons. I need to find out how many students take tap lessons from the given options.

Hmm, the phrase "4 over 9" is a bit tricky. I think it's referring to a fraction, like 4/9. So, maybe I need to calculate 4/9 of the total number of students, which is 72. That makes sense because the question is about dividing the students into groups based on the fraction that takes tap lessons.

Alright, so the formula here should be to multiply 72 by 4/9. Let me write that down: (4/9) * 72. 

Wait, how do I compute that? Maybe I can simplify it. Let me see, 72 divided by 9 is 8, right? Because 9 times 8 is 72. So, 72 divided by 9 is 8. Then, I multiply that result by 4. So 8 times 4 is 32. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 32. But wait, I feel like I've seen similar problems where sometimes "4 over 9" might mean something else, like 4 more than 9, but that doesn't make sense here because 4 over 9 is a common way to say the fraction 4/9.

Let me double-check my calculation. 4 divided by 9 is a fraction, and when I multiply it by 72, I'm finding a part of the whole. So 4/9 of 72 is indeed (4 * 72) / 9. Let's compute that step by step.

First, 72 divided by 9 is 8. Then, 8 multiplied by 4 is 32. So that's 32 students. But wait, looking back at the options, option A is 32, but I also see option G is 54 and others. Did I do something wrong?

Wait another thought: Maybe the question is phrased as "4 over 9", which could sometimes be interpreted as 4/(9), but perhaps I should make sure. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again: "4 over 9 take tap lessons." So yes, that's 4/9 of the total.

Wait, but wait a second. Another way to think about it: If 4/9 take tap, then perhaps the remaining 5/9 don't. But that shouldn't affect the calculation. Let me recalculate:

4/9 of 72 is (4 * 72) /9. Let's compute 72 divided by 9 first, which is 8. Then 8 times 4 is 32. So yes, 32. So the answer should be 32, which is option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because 32 isn't one of the higher options. Let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. Another way to look at it: Maybe "4 over 9" refers to the number of students taking tap lessons beyond a certain number. But that wouldn't make much sense because the total is 72, and 4 over 9 would be a smaller number than the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant that 4 out of 9 students take tap lessons. But that's the same as 4/9. So that's the same calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute it another way to confirm. Let's compute 4/9 of 72 directly.

4/9 * 72 = (4 * 72) / 9.

Calculate 4 times 72: that's 288. Then divide by 9: 288 /9 is 32. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be 32, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again: A is 32, which matches. So I think that's correct.

The problem states that there are 72 students on the dance team, and 4/9 of them take tap lessons. To find the number of students taking tap lessons, we calculate 4/9 of 72:

\[
\frac{4}{9} \times 72 = \frac{4 \times 72}{9} = \frac{288}{9} = 32
\]

Thus, 32 students take tap lessons. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

A: 32

Answer: A
