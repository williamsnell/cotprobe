Okay, so I've got this problem here about a Co-60 source in a hospital, and I'm supposed to find the rate of gamma rays incident on a patient. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the source is 3.0 x 10^14 Bq. Co-60 emits two gamma rays per disintegration, right? So each decay gives off a 1.1 MeV and a 1.3 MeV gamma. But wait, the problem is about the rate of gamma rays incident on the patient, so maybe I don't need to worry about the energy specifics, just the count.

The patient has an area of 0.30 m² and is located 4.0 meters from the source. So I think this is a problem involving the inverse square law for radiation. The flux (gamma rays per second per area) at the patient's location depends on the source strength and the distance.

Wait, but the source's activity is given in becquerels, which is disintegrations per second. Since each disintegration emits two gammas, the total gamma emission rate should be 2 times the activity. So the source emits 2 * 3.0e14 Bq = 6.0e14 gammas per second.

Now, the flux (phi) at a distance r is given by phi = S / (4 * pi * r²), where S is the number of gammas emitted per second. Because the source emits isotropically, the gammas spread out over a sphere of surface area 4πr².

So plugging in the numbers: r is 4.0 m. So r squared is 16 m². 4 * pi * 16 is approximately 4 * 3.1416 * 16. Let me calculate that. 4 * 16 is 64, 64 * 3.1416 is about 201.0619. So phi ≈ 6e14 / 201.0619 ≈ around 2.985e12 gammas per second per square meter.

Wait, the patient's area is 0.30 m². So the total gamma rate incident on the patient (let's call it R) would be phi multiplied by the area. So R = phi * area. That would be 2.985e12 * 0.30 ≈ 8.955e11 gammas per second. 

But wait, the question says the rate is X * 1e11 Bq. So X would be 8.955, so approximately 8.96. Looking at the options, option J is 8.95, which is really close. So I'm thinking J is the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the flux calculation.

So S = 3e14 Bq * 2 = 6e14 gammas/s.

Phi = 6e14 / (4 * pi * (4)^2) = 6e14 / (4 * pi *16) = 6e14 / (64 pi) ≈ 6e14 / (201.06) ≈ 2.984e12 gammas/m²s.

Multiply by area 0.3: 2.984e12 * 0.3 = 8.952e11. So X is 8.95, which matches option J.

I think I got it right. So the answer should be J.

To determine the rate of gamma rays incident on the patient, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Source Activity and Gamma Emission**: The Co-60 source has an activity of \( 3.0 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Bq} \). Since each disintegration emits two gamma rays (1.1 MeV and 1.3 MeV), the total gamma emission rate is:  
   \[
   S = 2 \times 3.0 \times 10^{14} = 6.0 \times 10^{14} \, \text{gammas/second}.
   \]

2. **Gamma Flux at the Patient's Location**: The flux (\( \phi \)) of gamma rays at a distance \( r = 4.0 \, \text{m} \) is given by the inverse square law:  
   \[
   \phi = \frac{S}{4 \pi r^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( S = 6.0 \times 10^{14} \) and \( r^2 = 16 \, \text{m}^2 \):  
   \[
   \phi = \frac{6.0 \times 10^{14}}{4 \pi \times 16} = \frac{6.0 \times 10^{14}}{201.0619} \approx 2.984 \times 10^{12} \, \text{gammas/second/m}^2.
   \]

3. **Total Gamma Rate Incident on the Patient**: The patient has an area of \( 0.30 \, \text{m}^2 \). The total gamma rate (\( R \)) incident on the patient is:  
   \[
   R = \phi \times \text{area} = 2.984 \times 10^{12} \times 0.30 \approx 8.952 \times 10^{11} \, \text{gammas/second}.
   \]

4. **Determine \( X \)**: The problem states that the rate is \( X \times 10^{11} \, \text{Bq} \). Comparing this to the calculated rate:  
   \[
   X \times 10^{11} = 8.952 \times 10^{11} \implies X \approx 8.95.
   \]

From the given options, the closest value to \( X = 8.95 \) is **J: 8.95**.

**Answer: J**
