Alright, so I've got this question about public goods, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, let's start by recalling what I remember about public goods. I think public goods have two main characteristics: non-rivalry and non-excludability. 

Non-rivalry means that one person's consumption doesn't reduce the availability for others. Like, if I watch a fireworks show, it doesn't stop you from watching it too. On the other hand, a private good, like a sandwich, is rival because once I eat it, no one else can.

Non-excludability means it's hard or impossible to prevent someone from using the good even if they don't pay for it. For example, national defense: if a country is protected, it's hard to exclude someone from that protection, whether they pay taxes or not.

Now the question is asking which statement is true about a pure public good. Let's look at the options.

Option A: The marginal cost of providing an additional unit to additional citizens is zero. Hmm, marginal cost here refers to the cost of adding one more person to benefit from the good. Since public goods are non-rival, adding another user doesn't cost more. So this sounds right. Like, broadcasting a radio show to an extra person doesn't cost anything extra.

Option B: Consumption depletes resources. No, that's more like a common resource, such as a fishery. Public goods aren't depleted when used, so B is probably wrong.

Option C: Only a limited number can consume at a time. That doesn't fit. Public goods can be consumed by many without reducing availability. So C is incorrect.

Option D: One more unit for some means less for others. That's the opposite of non-rivalry. So D is wrong.

Option E: Consumers can be excluded if they don't pay. Wait, no. Non-excludability means you can't exclude them. So E is incorrect because public goods can't be easily excluded based on payment.

Option F: Benefits can be privatized. I'm not sure. Sometimes companies can provide parts of public goods, but pure public goods are typically things like national defense, which the private sector can't fully provide. So maybe F is wrong.

Option G: Can't be divided into discrete units. That's more about indivisibility, which is part of public goods. But I'm not sure if this is the best answer. Like, some public goods can be divided, but others can't. Maybe it's not the defining feature.

Option H: Marginal cost is greater than zero. That would contradict non-rivalry. If the marginal cost is zero, as in A, then H is wrong.

Option I: Only those who pay can consume. That goes against non-excludability. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Always provided by government. I think some public goods can be provided by private organizations or NGOs, but often governments do it because of the free-rider problem. So J isn't necessarily true.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be A. It aligns with non-rivalry, where the marginal cost of adding another consumer is zero.

The correct answer is:

**A**

Explanation: A pure public good is characterized by non-rivalry and non-excludability. Non-rivalry means that the marginal cost of providing the good to an additional person is zero, as one person's consumption does not reduce the availability of the good for others. This aligns with option A, which states that the marginal cost of providing an additional unit of the good to additional citizens is zero. The other options either contradict the characteristics of public goods or are not universally true. 

Answer: A
