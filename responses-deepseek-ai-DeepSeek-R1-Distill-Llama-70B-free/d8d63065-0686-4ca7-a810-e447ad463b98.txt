Question:

A mechanic agreed in writing to make repairs to a landscaper's truck for $12,000. The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?

Options:

A: No, because the mechanic breached the original contract by demanding extra payment.
B: Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.
C: No, because the mechanic exploited the landscaper's immediate need for the truck.
D: No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.
E: Yes, because the final price is equivalent to the customary charge for such work.
F: No, because the original contract did not include the additional $2,000 payment.
G: Yes, because the landscaper agreed in writing to pay the additional cost.
H: Yes, because the mechanic completed the repairs as agreed.
I: Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.
J: No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is about a mechanic and a landscaper. They had a written agreement where the mechanic would repair the landscaper's truck for $12,000. The mechanic did the repairs properly, but when the landscaper tried to pay, the mechanic refused to give back the truck unless the landscaper agreed to pay an extra $2,000. Now, the customary charge for such repairs was $14,000, which is more than what they originally agreed on. The landscaper needed the truck urgently because of existing contracts, and there were no rental trucks available. So, the landscaper reluctantly agreed in writing to pay the extra $2,000, and then the mechanic delivered the truck.

The question is whether the mechanic can enforce this additional $2,000 promise from the landscaper.

Hmm, so I remember that in contract law, when one party tries to modify a contract by threatening to breach it unless the other party agrees to a change, that's called duress. Duress can make a contract unenforceable because it's considered coercion. So if the mechanic is withholding the truck (which is the landscaper's property) to force an additional payment, that might be duress.

Wait, but there's more. The original contract was for $12k, but the customary charge is $14k. So the mechanic's original agreement was below the usual rate. But that doesn't necessarily justify demanding more later. Because a contract is a binding agreement, so if the mechanic agreed to $12k, they can't just change their mind unless both parties agree.

So when the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless an extra $2k was paid, that's a problem. The mechanic was threatening to breach the contract (by not delivering the truck) unless the landscaper paid more. That sounds like duress because the landscaper had no choice but to agree due to the pressure.

But wait, what if the original contract didn't cover the actual costs, and the mechanic was trying to adjust it to the standard rate? Does that matter? I think not, because the contract was already made. If the mechanic underpriced the job, that's their mistake. They can't hold the truck hostage to get a better deal.

Another point is about consideration. For a contract modification to be enforceable, there usually needs to be new consideration. But in this case, the original contract was for repairs and return of the truck. The mechanic is just demanding more money to do what they were already supposed to do. So there's no new consideration here; the mechanic is just withholding performance to extract more payment, which is not allowed.

So looking at the options, the choices that talk about duress or undue influence might be the right answer. Let me go through the options:

Option A: No, because the mechanic breached the original contract by demanding extra payment. Well, the mechanic didn't breach yet; they just demanded more. But if they refused to perform without the extra, that could be a breach. But the question is about the enforceability of the additional promise.

Option C: No, because the mechanic exploited the landscaper's immediate need. That touches on duress or undue influence, but I'm not sure if that's the exact legal term here.

Option D: No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield. This sounds like duress. If the landscaper had no choice and was forced to agree, the promise wouldn't be enforceable.

Option J: No, because of undue influence. Undue influence usually involves a power imbalance or some form of pressure, but I think this is more about duress.

Wait, the key here is that the mechanic is using the threat of not delivering the truck, which the landscaper desperately needs, to get the extra money. So this is duress. Dures makes the contract voidable because the agreement was made under pressure, leaving the victim with no real choice.

So the answer would hinge on whether the additional promise was made under duress. If so, the mechanic can't enforce it.

Looking at the options, D and J are possibilities. D says the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat. That sounds exactly like duress. J is about undue influence, which I think is a different concept, more about relationships or pressure that's not involving a threat of breach.

So the correct answer should be D or C or J? Wait, I think the correct legal term here is duress, which would make the additional promise unenforceable. So the mechanic can't enforce the $2k.

So looking at the options again:

Option D: No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.

That fits because the mechanic's demand was wrongful (breach of contract) and the landscaper had no choice but to agree.

So the answer should be D.

The question revolves around whether the mechanic can enforce the landscaper's promise to pay an additional $2,000 for repairs. The original contract was for $12,000, but the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper agreed to the extra payment. The landscaper, needing the truck urgently and having no rental alternatives, reluctantly agreed in writing.

This scenario raises issues of duress and undue influence in contract law. The mechanic's demand for additional payment after completing the repairs constitutes a wrongful threat to withhold performance of the original contract. The landscaper, faced with no reasonable alternative and under significant pressure, was forced to agree to the extra payment. In contract law, such a promise made under duress is generally unenforceable because it lacks true consent.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** correctly identifies that the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat, which aligns with the concept of duress.
- Other options, such as **Option J** (undue influence), are less precise because undue influence typically involves a preexisting relationship or power imbalance, which is not clearly present here.

Thus, the correct answer is based on the principle of duress, making the additional payment promise unenforceable.

Answer: D
