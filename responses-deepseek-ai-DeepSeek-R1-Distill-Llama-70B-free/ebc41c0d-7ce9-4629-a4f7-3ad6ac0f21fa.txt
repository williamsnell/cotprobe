Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about weak convergence in Banach spaces. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question states: If H is a Banach space and {x_n} is a sequence in H, and x is in H, then x_n weakly converges to x if and only if two conditions hold. The first condition is that the norm of x_n is bounded. The second condition is that there's a dense subset M* in the dual space H*, such that for every f in M*, the limit of f(x_n) as n approaches infinity is f(x).

Wait, so the question is asking if this equivalence is correct. The options are to answer 1 for yes and 0 for no, but the options given are A through J, which are numbers, so I need to pick the corresponding option that represents 1 or 0.

Let me recall what weak convergence entails. In a Banach space, a sequence x_n converges weakly to x if for every continuous linear functional f in H*, the sequence f(x_n) converges to f(x). So that's the definition.

Now, the question is about an equivalence. It says that weak convergence is equivalent to two things: the norms of x_n are bounded, and for a dense subset M* of H*, the limit holds for all f in M*.

So the first part is about boundedness. I remember that in a Banach space, if a sequence converges weakly, then the norms are bounded. Oh right, because of the Uniform Boundedness Principle. So that's a theorem. That is, if x_n converges weakly, then ||x_n|| is bounded. So the forward direction holds: weak convergence implies ||x_n|| is bounded.

But here the question is about equivalence. So we need both directions. So the converse: if ||x_n|| is bounded and for a dense subset of functionals, the limit holds, then does x_n converge weakly to x?

Wait, I think that's true. Because if you have a dense set of functionals for which f(x_n) approaches f(x), and the norms are bounded, then by some theorem, maybe the denseness ensures that it holds for all functionals.

I recall something about the density of M* in H*. Since M* is dense, for any f in H*, you can approximate it with a sequence in M*. But wait, since H* is the dual space, the weak* topology is involved here. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the fact that if a set of functionals is dense in H*, then their action on x_n determines weak convergence. Because if for a dense set, the functionals evaluated on x_n converge to those on x, then for any other functional, which is a limit point of the dense set, the convergence should hold as well due to the boundedness of ||x_n||.

Wait, let's think about it. Suppose that M* is dense in H*. Then, for any f in H*, and any ε > 0, there exists an f_ε in M* such that ||f - f_ε|| is less than ε. Now, since ||x_n|| is bounded, say by some constant M, then |f(x_n) - f(x)| can be split using the triangle inequality:

|f(x_n) - f(x)| ≤ |f(x_n) - f_ε(x_n)| + |f_ε(x_n) - f_ε(x)| + |f_ε(x) - f(x)|.

We know that ||f - f_ε|| is small, so the first and third terms can be made small because the norms of x_n and x are bounded. The middle term goes to zero because f_ε is in M*, so f_ε(x_n) → f_ε(x). So putting this together, for any f, the limit holds, which means x_n converges weakly to x.

So yes, the equivalence holds. So the statement is correct, which would mean the answer is 1 (option H), but wait wait, looking at the options, the first part of the question says, "answer 1 for yes and 0 for no." So the answer should be 1 or 0. The options are labeled A to J with various numbers, but I need to pick the letter that corresponds to 1 or 0.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.0, and option H is 1.0. So if the answer is yes, it's 1, which is H.

Wait, but am I missing anything? Let me double-check. The two conditions are that the norms are bounded and that for a dense set M* in H*, the functionals applied to x_n converge to x. So the reverse direction is, if these two hold, then x_n converges weakly to x. I think that's right, based on the density argument and the boundedness ensuring that the convergence extends to all functionals.

So yes, the statement is correct. So the correct answer is 1, which is option H.

The question concerns the equivalence of weak convergence in a Banach space. Specifically, it asks whether the weak convergence of a sequence \( \{x_n\} \) in a Banach space \( H \) to an element \( x \in H \) is equivalent to two conditions: (1) \( \|x_n\| \) is bounded, and (2) for a dense subset \( M^* \subset H^* \), \( \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = f(x) \) for all \( f \in M^* \).

To analyze this, recall that weak convergence in a Banach space is defined as follows: \( x_n \rightharpoonup x \) if and only if \( f(x_n) \to f(x) \) for all \( f \in H^* \). The question is about the equivalence of this definition to the two given conditions.

1. **Forward Direction**: If \( x_n \rightharpoonup x \), then \( \|x_n\| \) is bounded due to the Uniform Boundedness Principle. This principle ensures that if a sequence converges weakly, its norms are bounded.

2. **Reverse Direction**: If \( \|x_n\| \) is bounded and \( \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = f(x) \) for a dense subset \( M^* \subset H^* \), then the convergence extends to all \( f \in H^* \). This follows because \( M^* \) being dense allows approximating any \( f \in H^* \) by a sequence in \( M^* \). Using the triangle inequality and the boundedness of \( \|x_n\| \), the convergence \( f(x_n) \to f(x) \) can be shown to hold for all \( f \in H^* \).

Thus, the equivalence holds: weak convergence of \( x_n \) to \( x \) is indeed equivalent to the two conditions stated in the question. Since the question asks for "1 for yes" and "0 for no," the correct answer is 1, which corresponds to option H.
