Okay, so I've got this problem about the van der Waals equation and calculating the constant b. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me the critical pressure (P_c) as 30 atm and the critical temperature (T_c) as 200°C. I remember that for the van der Waals equation, there are relations involving the critical constants. Oh right, the van der Waals constants a and b can be calculated using P_c and T_c.

Wait, the formula for a and b in terms of critical constants. Let me recall. I think the formulas are:

a = (3 (P_c) (R T_c)^2 ) / ( (P_c)^2 ) )? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the critical constants relate to a and b through equations. Let me think again.

Oh wait, more accurately, the van der Waals equation can be written in terms of the critical constants. The critical isotherm is where the inflection points coincide, leading to specific expressions. I think the formulas are:

P_c = (a)/(27 b²)
and
T_c = (8a)/(27 R b)

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. The van der Waals equation is [P + a(n/V)^2][V/n - b] = RT. So in terms of critical constants, there are specific expressions for a and b.

Wait, I think the correct relations are:

At the critical point, the first and second derivatives of P with respect to V (at constant T) are zero. Solving these leads to the expressions for a and b.

So the correct expressions are:

P_c = a/(27 b²)
T_c = (8a)/(27 R b)

So with these, I can solve for a and b given P_c and T_c.

But wait, the question only asks for b. So maybe I can express b in terms of P_c and T_c, using these two equations.

From the first equation, a = 27 P_c b².

Substituting into the second equation:

T_c = (8 * 27 P_c b² ) / (27 R b )

Simplify that. Let's see:

27 cancels out in numerator and denominator.

So T_c = (8 P_c b²) / (R b ) => T_c = (8 P_c b) / R

So solving for b:

b = (R T_c) / (8 P_c )

Ah, okay, that's a key formula. So once I compute that, I can find b.

Now, I need to plug in the values. But wait, what units are these in? The problem gives P_c in atm, T_c in Celsius. I need to make sure I'm using the correct units for R.

So, R is commonly 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). But temperature must be in Kelvin. So I'll convert T_c to Kelvin.

T_c is 200°C, so 200 + 273.15 = 473.15 K.

So plugging the numbers:

b = (R * T_c) / (8 * P_c )

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)
T_c is 473.15 K
P_c is 30 atm

Calculating numerator: 0.0821 * 473.15 ≈ let's compute that.

0.0821 * 473.15 ≈ 

Well, 0.08 * 473 = 37.84, and 0.0021 *473 ≈ 1 approx, so total about 38.84.

Denominator: 8 *30 =240.

So b ≈ 38.84 / 240 ≈ 0.1619 L/mol.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.162, which matches. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me check my calculation more precisely.

Compute 0.0821 * 473.15:

0.0821 * 473.15

Let me break it down:

473.15 * 0.08 = 37.852

473.15 * 0.0021 = ?

473.15 * 0.002 = 0.9463, and 473.15 *0.0001=0.047315 → total 0.993965.

So 37.852 + 0.993965 ≈ 38.845965.

Denominator: 8 *30 =240.

38.845965 / 240 ≈ 0.161858. So approximately 0.1619 L/mol.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.162 liter/mole, which aligns perfectly.

So the correct answer is E.

To calculate the van der Waals constant \( b \) for the given gas, we use the relationship derived from the critical constants \( P_c \) and \( T_c \). The formula for \( b \) is:

\[
b = \frac{R T_c}{8 P_c}
\]

### Step 1: Convert \( T_c \) to Kelvin
The critical temperature \( T_c \) is given as \( 200^\circ \text{C} \). Converting to Kelvin:

\[
T_c = 200 + 273.15 = 473.15 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Plug in the values
The gas constant \( R \) is \( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), \( P_c = 30 \, \text{atm} \), and \( T_c = 473.15 \, \text{K} \). Substituting these into the formula:

\[
b = \frac{(0.0821)(473.15)}{(8)(30)}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.0821 \times 473.15 \approx 38.845965 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
8 \times 30 = 240
\]

Now, divide:

\[
b = \frac{38.845965}{240} \approx 0.1619 \, \text{L/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The closest value to \( 0.1619 \, \text{L/mol} \) is \( 0.162 \, \text{L/mol} \), which corresponds to **option E**.

### Final Answer:
E
