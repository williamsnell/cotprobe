Okay, so I've got this question about banking and the money supply. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question says that a bank acquires an additional $1 of deposits, and there's no required reserve ratio. I need to figure out by how much the money supply could theoretically expand.

Wait, right, the required reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks must hold in reserves and can't lend out. So if there's no required reserve ratio, that means the bank can lend out all of its deposits, right?

I remember something about the money multiplier. Normally, the money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. But if the reserve ratio is zero, that would make the denominator zero, which would be undefined. Hmm, that's confusing. So without a reserve ratio, the multiplier wouldn't work the same way.

Oh wait, no required reserve ratio means the bank can lend out every dollar it receives. So when a bank gets $1 in deposits, it can loan all of it. But then, the person who borrows that $1 will deposit it into another bank, which can then loan all of it again. This creates a chain reaction.

So each time the money is loaned, it gets redeposited, and the process repeats. So the initial $1 deposit leads to more loans, each of which becomes a new deposit elsewhere. This process should theoretically continue indefinitely, right? Because there's no reserve requirement to limit the lending.

Wait, but in reality, there are things like currency leakage (people holding cash) and excess reserves, but the question is theoretical, so maybe we ignore those factors. So in theory, the money supply could expand infinitely because every dollar is lent out repeatedly without any reserves being held back.

But wait, does that make sense? Let me think again. If the bank has no reserve requirement, every deposit can be fully loaned. So the first $1 is loaned to someone, who deposits it into another bank. That bank then loans out the full $1 again. This would mean each dollar creates another dollar, leading to an infinite expansion. Because each new dollar is fully used each time.

So the money supply would increase by an infinite amount from that initial $1. Because each step adds another $1, infinitely. So the answer would be that the money supply could expand infinitely.

Looking at the options, option E is "Infinitely". So the correct answer should be E.

When a bank acquires an additional $1 of deposits and there is no required reserve ratio, the bank can lend out the entire $1. This loan is then redeposited into another bank, which can also lend out the full amount. This process repeats indefinitely, as there are no reserves being held back to limit lending. In a theoretical scenario where factors like currency leakage and excess reserves are ignored, the money supply could expand infinitely. 

Given the options, the correct answer is:

E: Infinitely

Answer: E
