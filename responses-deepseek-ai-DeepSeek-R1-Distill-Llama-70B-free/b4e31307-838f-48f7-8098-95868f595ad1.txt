Okay, so I've got this question here: "How many labeled trees are there on 6 vertices?" The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my combinatorics, but I remember something about trees and their counts. Let me try to think this through.

I recall that there's a theorem related to counting labeled trees. Oh right, it's called Cayley's formula. I think it states that the number of labeled trees on n vertices is n raised to the power of (n-2). So the formula would be n^(n-2). Let me make sure that's right. Wait, yes, I remember that from my graph theory class. So for each n, it's n^(n-2) trees.

So the question is about n=6. Plugging into the formula, that would be 6^(6-2) = 6^4. Let me calculate that. 6 squared is 36, so 6^4 is 36 * 36. Let me do the multiplication. 36 times 30 is 1080, and 36 times 6 is 216. Adding those together gives 1080 + 216 = 1296. Wait, that's 6^4 equals 1296.

Looking back at the options, option I is 1296. So the answer should be I.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I mix up the formula? I'm pretty sure it's n^(n-2). Let me think about a smaller n to confirm. Like n=3. 3^(1) is 3, and indeed, there are 3 labeled trees on 3 vertices. For n=4, it's 4^2=16. I think that's correct too. So applying it to 6, yes, 6^4 is 1296. So the correct option is I.

The number of labeled trees on \( n \) vertices is given by Cayley's formula, which states that the count is \( n^{n-2} \). For \( n = 6 \), this becomes \( 6^{6-2} = 6^4 \). Calculating \( 6^4 \), we get \( 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 1296 \). Among the provided options, the correct answer is 1296, which corresponds to option I.
