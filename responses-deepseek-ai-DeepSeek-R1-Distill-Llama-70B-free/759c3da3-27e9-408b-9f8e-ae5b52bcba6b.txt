Okay, so I have this economics question here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. It's about GNP, money quantity, and the price level. I remember from my studies that these concepts are related through the equation of exchange. Right, the equation is MV = PY. Where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Y is real GNP.

The question says that real GNP doubles. So Y becomes 2Y. And the quantity of money increases by 80%, so M becomes M plus 80% of M, which is 1.8M. Velocity is constant, so V doesn't change.

Wait, so plugging into the equation. Originally, it was MV = PY. So initially, M * V = P * Y.

After the changes, it's (1.8M) * V = P_new * (2Y).

I can rearrange this to solve for P_new. Let me write it out:

1.8M * V = P_new * 2Y.

Divide both sides by 2Y:

P_new = (1.8M * V) / (2Y).

But from the original equation, M*V = P*Y. So I can substitute that in. So M*V is equal to P*Y, so substituting into the equation for P_new:

P_new = (1.8 * (P*Y)) / (2Y).

Wait, the Y terms cancel out here because Y is in numerator and denominator. So P_new = (1.8 P ) / 2.

Calculate that: 1.8 divided by 2 is 0.9. So P_new = 0.9 P.

Oh wait, that would mean the new price level is 90% of the original. So that's a 10% decrease. But wait, let me double-check my steps because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the initial equation is MV = PY. After the change, M becomes 1.8M, Y becomes 2Y. So the new equation is 1.8M * V = P_new * 2Y.

I can rearrange this as P_new = (1.8M * V) / (2Y). Since MV = PY, substituting M*V with PY gives P_new = (1.8 PY) / (2Y). The Y cancels, so 1.8 P / 2 = 0.9 P. So yes, P_new is 0.9 P, which is a 10% decrease in the price level.

Wait, that's a 10% drop. So looking at the options, option B is a drop by 10%. But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. Did I mix up anything?

Wait, another way to think about it: The equation is PY = MV. So if M increases by 80% (to 1.8M) and Y doubles (to 2Y), then the right side becomes 1.8M * V. So the left side must also equal that. So PY = 1.8MV.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the equation is MV = PY. So if M increases by 80%, it's 1.8M. Y doubles, so it's 2Y. So 1.8M * V = P_new * 2Y.

Solving for P_new: P_new = (1.8M * V) / (2 Y). But since M V = P Y initially, so substitute M V with P Y.

So P_new = (1.8 P Y ) / (2 Y) ) â†’ Y cancels. So 1.8 P / 2 = 0.9 P. Yeah, so a 10% drop. So the price level decreases by 10%.

So the correct answer should be option B: The price level drops by 10%.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Because sometimes in these problems, it's percentage changes that matter. So the percentage change in P is (P_new - P)/P *100%.

So (0.9P - P)/P *100% = (-0.1)*100% = -10%. So yes, 10% decrease.

Looking back at the options, option B is "The price level drops by 10%." So the answer should be B.

To analyze the effect on the price level, we use the equation of exchange: 

\[
MV = PY
\]

where \(M\) is the money supply, \(V\) is the velocity of money, \(P\) is the price level, and \(Y\) is real GNP. The problem states that real GNP doubles (\(Y \to 2Y\)) and the money supply increases by 80% (\(M \to 1.8M\)), while velocity \(V\) remains constant.

### Step 1: Initial Equation
Initially, the equation is:

\[
M \cdot V = P \cdot Y
\]

### Step 2: After the Changes
After the changes, the equation becomes:

\[
1.8M \cdot V = P_{\text{new}} \cdot 2Y
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(P_{\text{new}}\)
Rearranging for \(P_{\text{new}}\):

\[
P_{\text{new}} = \frac{1.8M \cdot V}{2Y}
\]

Using the initial equation \(M \cdot V = P \cdot Y\), substitute \(M \cdot V\) with \(P \cdot Y\):

\[
P_{\text{new}} = \frac{1.8 \cdot P \cdot Y}{2Y}
\]

The \(Y\) terms cancel out:

\[
P_{\text{new}} = \frac{1.8P}{2} = 0.9P
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The new price level \(P_{\text{new}} = 0.9P\) represents a 10% decrease in the price level compared to the original price level \(P\).

### Step 5: Match with the Options
The correct answer is **B: The price level drops by 10%**.
