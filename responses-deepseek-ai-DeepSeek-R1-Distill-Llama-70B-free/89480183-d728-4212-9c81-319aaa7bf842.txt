Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, Mr. Kohlberg has a flower shop, and he starts the day with 152 roses. He sold 96 of them, and now he wants to split the remaining roses equally into 8 vases. I need to find out how many roses each vase will get.

First, I think I should figure out how many roses are left after he sold some. So, he started with 152 and sold 96. To find the remaining, I subtract 96 from 152. Let me do that calculation: 152 minus 96. Hmm, 152 - 90 is 62, and then subtract 6 more, so 62-6=56. So he has 56 roses left after selling.

Now, he wants to divide these 56 roses equally among 8 vases. So I guess I need to divide 56 by 8. Let me do that division. 8 goes into 56 how many times? Well, 8 times 7 is 56 because 8*7=56. So each vase would have 7 roses.

Wait, let me double-check that. He starts with 152, sells 96, which leaves 56. 56 divided by 8 is indeed 7. So each vase gets 7 roses.

Looking at the options, option H is 7. So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H.
