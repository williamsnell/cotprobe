Okay, so I have this problem where John has $200 earning interest at 5% for one year, and it's compounded quarterly. I need to figure out how much interest he would get without using a formula or a table. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times over the period. Since it's compounded quarterly, that means four times a year. So each quarter, the interest is calculated on the current amount, which includes the previously added interest.

The annual interest rate is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. But since it's compounded quarterly, I need to find the quarterly interest rate. I think you divide the annual rate by the number of periods. So 0.05 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 0.05 /4 equals 0.0125, which is 1.25% per quarter.

Now, the principal amount is $200. The time is one year, which is four quarters. So the formula I know is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but since I can't use the formula, I have to compute each quarter step by step.

Let me outline the four quarters:

Starting principal, P0 = $200.

After first quarter:
Interest = P0 * r = 200 * 0.0125 = $2.50.
New principal, P1 = 200 + 2.50 = $202.50.

Second quarter:
Interest = P1 * 0.0125 = 202.50 * 0.0125.
Let me calculate that. 200 * 0.0125 is 2.50, and 2.50 *0.0125 is 0.03125. So 2.50 + 0.03125 = $2.53125.
New principal, P2 = 202.50 + 2.53125 = $205.03125.

Third quarter:
Interest = 205.03125 * 0.0125. Let's see:
200 * 0.0125 is 2.50, and 5.03125 * 0.0125. Let me compute 5 * 0.0125 is 0.0625, and 0.03125 *0.0125 is 0.000390625. So adding those gives 0.0625 +0.000390625 = 0.062890625. So total interest is 2.50 +0.062890625 = $2.562890625.
New principal, P3 = 205.03125 + 2.562890625 = $207.594140625.

Fourth quarter:
Interest = 207.594140625 * 0.0125. Hmm, let's compute parts again. 200 *0.0125 is 2.50, 7.594140625 *0.0125. Let's break that down.
7 *0.0125 is 0.0875, 0.594140625 *0.0125. Let's compute 0.5 *0.0125 is 0.00625, 0.094140625 *0.0125. Wait, maybe it's easier to multiply 207.594140625 by 0.0125 directly.

Alternatively, 207.594140625 is the same as 207.594140625. Multiply by 1/80 (since 1/8 is 0.125, and 0.0125 is 1/80). So 207.594140625 divided by 80.

Let me compute 207.594140625 /80. 200/80 = 2.5, 7.594140625/80 = approx 0.0949275. So total interest is 2.5 + 0.0949275 = approximately $2.5949275.

Wait, but I'm probably making this more complicated. Maybe a better way is to compute 207.594140625 * 0.0125. Let's multiply 207.594140625 by 0.125, then divide by 10, because 0.0125 is a tenth of 0.125.

Wait, 207.594140625 * 0.125. Let me compute that. 200 *0.125 is 25, 7.594140625 *0.125 is approximately 0.9492675. So total 25 + 0.9492675 =25.9492675. Now divide by 10, so 2.59442675. So approximately $2.5944.

So the interest for the fourth quarter is about $2.5944.

Adding that to the previous principal: 207.594140625 + 2.5944 = 210.188540625.

So the total amount after one year is approximately $210.1885. 

Now, the question is about the interest earned, which is the final amount minus the principal. So 210.1885 - 200 = $10.1885. 

Looking at the options, option H is $10.19. That's very close, so I think that's the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should check each calculation step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate each quarter more accurately.

First quarter:
200 *0.05/4 = 200 *0.0125 = 2.50. So P1=202.50.

Second quarter:
202.50 *0.0125. Let me compute 202.50 * 0.01 = 2.025; 202.50 *0.0025=0.50625. So 2.025 +0.50625=2.53125. So P2=205.03125.

Third quarter:
205.03125 *0.0125. Let's break it down: 200 *0.0125=2.5; 5.03125 *0.0125. 5 *0.0125=0.0625; 0.03125 *0.0125=0.000390625. So 0.0625 +0.000390625=0.062890625. Total interest 2.5 +0.062890625=2.562890625. So P3=205.03125 +2.562890625=207.594140625.

Fourth quarter:
207.594140625 *0.0125. Let's compute 207.594140625 * 0.01 =2.07594140625; 207.594140625 *0.0025=0.51898535156. So add these: 2.07594140625 +0.51898535156=2.59492675781. So interest is approx $2.5949. Adding to P3 gives 207.594140625 +2.59492675781=210.1890673828. 

So the total interest is 210.1890673828 -200 =10.1890673828, which is approximately $10.19. So yes, option H is correct.

To calculate the interest John earns on his $200 investment at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded quarterly, we break the process into steps. The annual rate of 5% is divided by 4 to find the quarterly rate:  

\[
r = \frac{0.05}{4} = 0.0125 \, \text{(or 1.25% per quarter)}.
\]

The principal amount is $200, and the investment is compounded quarterly for 1 year (4 quarters). The interest and new principal are calculated for each quarter as follows:

1. **First Quarter**:  
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 200 \times 0.0125 = 2.50.
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Principal} = 200 + 2.50 = 202.50.
   \]

2. **Second Quarter**:  
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 202.50 \times 0.0125 = 2.53125.
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Principal} = 202.50 + 2.53125 = 205.03125.
   \]

3. **Third Quarter**:  
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 205.03125 \times 0.0125 = 2.562890625.
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Principal} = 205.03125 + 2.562890625 = 207.594140625.
   \]

4. **Fourth Quarter**:  
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 207.594140625 \times 0.0125 = 2.59492675781.
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Principal} = 207.594140625 + 2.59492675781 = 210.1890673828.
   \]

The total amount after 1 year is approximately $210.19. The interest earned is the difference between the final amount and the initial principal:  

\[
\text{Interest} = 210.19 - 200 = 10.19.
\]

From the given options, the closest match is **$10.19**, which corresponds to option **H**.

**Answer: H**
