Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about depreciation using the sum-of-the-years-digits method. Hmm, I remember that depreciation methods are ways to allocate the cost of an asset over its useful life. Sum-of-the-years-digits (SYD) is one of those methods. Let me think about how it works.

So, Mr. Casey bought office furniture for $725, and it's expected to have a salvage value of $25 after 10 years. The question is asking for the depreciation in the fourth year using SYD.

Wait, what's the SYD method again? Oh right, I think it's where you take the sum of the years, which is the sum from 1 to n, and then each year's depreciation is a fraction of the depreciable amount based on the year's position in that sum.

Depreciable amount is the cost minus salvage value. So that's $725 - $25 = $700. Got it.

The sum of the years for 10 years is calculated as n(n+1)/2. So 10*11/2 = 55. That's the total sum.

Each year's depreciation is (Depreciable amount) * (year's digit / sum). So for year 1, it's 10/55, year 2 is 9/55, and so on until year 10 is 1/55.

Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the first year uses the highest digit. So for each year, the numerator is the year's digit, which decreases each year. So for the fourth year, the digit is 7 (since 10,9,8,7,...). Let me double-check that.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the sum is from 1 to 10, so the digits are 10 down to 1. So the first year is 10/55, second 9/55, third 8/55, fourth 7/55. Oh, right, that makes sense. So each year, the numerator decreases by 1.

So the depreciation for year four would be (700) * (7/55).

Let me compute that. 700 multiplied by 7 is 4900. Divided by 55. Hmm, 55 times 89 is 4900- wait, 55*89 is 55*(90-1) = 55*90=4950 minus 55=4895. Oh wait, wait, 55*89=4895, but 700*7=4900. So 4900 divided by 55.

Let me do this division. 55 goes into 4900 how many times? 55 * 89 is 4895, as I said. So 4900 is 4895 +5. So 89 with a remainder of 5. So 89.09 approximately. Wait, but wait. Wait, 55 * 89 is 4895. 4895 +5 is 4900. So 5/55 is 1/11, which is approximately 0.0909. So 89.0909.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is $89.09. So that would be the answer, right?

But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Depreciation in year 4 is 700 * (7/55). 7/55 is 0.12727... So 700 * 0.12727 is 89.09. Yep, that's correct.

So the options are A:65.50, B:55, C:700, D:120.25, E:95, F:725, G:89.09, H:100, I:130.15, J:72.25.

So the correct answer should be G: $89.09.

To calculate the depreciation for the fourth year using the sum-of-the-years-digits (SYD) method, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine the depreciable amount**:  
   The cost of the asset is $725, and the salvage value is $25.  
   Depreciable amount = $725 - $25 = **$700**.

2. **Calculate the sum of the years**:  
   For an asset with a useful life of 10 years, the sum of the years is:  
   \[
   \text{Sum of years} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{10(10+1)}{2} = 55
   \]

3. **Determine the depreciation for the fourth year**:  
   In the SYD method, the depreciation for each year is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = \text{Depreciable amount} \times \frac{\text{Year's digit}}{\text{Sum of years}}
   \]  
   For the fourth year, the year's digit is 7 (since the digits decrease from 10 to 1 over 10 years).  
   \[
   \text{Depreciation for year 4} = 700 \times \frac{7}{55}
   \]  
   First, calculate \( \frac{7}{55} \approx 0.12727 \).  
   Then, multiply by the depreciable amount:  
   \[
   700 \times 0.12727 \approx 89.09
   \]

4. **Select the correct option**:  
   Comparing the calculated depreciation ($89.09) with the provided options, the correct answer is **G: $89.09**.
