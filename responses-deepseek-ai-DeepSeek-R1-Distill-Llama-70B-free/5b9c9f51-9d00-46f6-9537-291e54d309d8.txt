Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about act jure gestionis. I'm a bit rusty on my international law terms, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in international law, there's a distinction between acts jure imperii and acts jure gestionis. I think jure imperii refers to acts of state sovereignty, like diplomatic actions or military decisions. These are considered public acts and are typically not subject to the jurisdiction of foreign courts because of state immunity.

On the other hand, jure gestionis pertains to acts that a state does in its private capacity, more like commercial activities. For example, if a state engages in trade, buys or sells goods, or enters into contracts, those would be jure gestionis. These acts are more like what a private individual or company might do, so states might not get immunity in foreign courts for these actions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: All actions by the State in public capacity. That sounds more like jure imperii, not gestionis. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Conduct by officials in free time. That doesn't directly relate to the concept; it's about personal actions, which I'm not sure is either category. Maybe not the right choice.

Option C: Acts by States in a private capacity. That aligns with what I remember about jure gestionis. So C could be correct.

Option D: International treaties are jure gestionis. No, treaties are more about state sovereignty, so jure imperii. D is wrong.

Option E: Decisions by State courts. Courts making decisions are part of the state's public function, so jure imperii. Not E.

Option F: Legislative decisions. Those are definitely public acts, so jure imperii. F is out.

Option G: All purchases by the State. Purchasing could be either, but if it's for public functions (like military equipment), it's jure imperii. But if it's a commercial purchase, like buying goods to sell, it's jure gestionis. The option says "all purchases," which might be too broad. But sometimes, purchases for state functions are considered jure imperii, so G might not be entirely correct unless it's specifically commercial.

Option H: Diplomatic missions. That's a classic jure imperii act. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Military actions. Definitely jure imperii. I is wrong.

Option J: Acts by State corporations. State corporations can act in both capacities. If they're doing commercial activities, it's jure gestionis. But if their activities are governmental, it's jure imperii. So J is too broad, unless it's specified as commercial.

Wait, the question is about what defines act jure gestionis. The correct definition is that it's when the state acts in a private or commercial capacity, similar to a private individual. So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, let me double-check. Option G says all purchases are jure gestionis. If a state buys something for a public purpose, like military equipment, that's jure imperii. So G is not correct because it says "all purchases." Only commercial purchases are jure gestionis.

Looking back, option C says "undertaken by States in a private capacity," which fits. So the correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C. Acts jure gestionis occur when a state acts in a private or commercial capacity, similar to the actions of a private individual. This is distinct from acts jure imperii, which involve public sovereignty functions. Option C accurately captures this definition.

Answer: C
