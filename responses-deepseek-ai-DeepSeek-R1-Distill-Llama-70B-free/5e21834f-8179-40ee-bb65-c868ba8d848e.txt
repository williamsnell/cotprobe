Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about throwing a ball from a window that's 8 meters above the ground. The initial speed is 10 m/s at an angle of 20 degrees below the horizontal. I need to find how far horizontally from the window the ball will hit the ground, ignoring air resistance. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. I remember that projectile problems can be broken down into horizontal and vertical components. Since air resistance is ignored, the horizontal velocity should stay constant, and the vertical motion is affected by gravity.

Wait, the angle is below the horizontal. Oh, right, so the initial velocity has a downward component from the start. That might make the time the ball is in the air shorter than if it were thrown upwards.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial speed (v₀) = 10 m/s
- Angle (θ) = 20 degrees below horizontal
- Height (h) = 8 m (initial vertical position)
- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s² downward

I need to find the horizontal distance, which is the range. So the approach is to find the time the ball is in the air and then multiply by the horizontal velocity component.

First, let's find the initial velocity components. The horizontal component (v₀x) is v₀ * cosθ. The vertical component (v₀y) is v₀ * sinθ. But since the angle is below the horizontal, the vertical component will be negative because it's directed downward.

Calculating v₀x: 10 m/s * cos(20°). Let me compute that. Cos(20) is approximately 0.9397. So 10 * 0.9397 is about 9.397 m/s.

v₀y: 10 * sin(20°). Sin(20) is about 0.3420, so 10 * 0.3420 is 3.420 m/s. But since it's downward, it's -3.420 m/s.

Now, the vertical motion determines how long the ball is in the air. The vertical displacement (s) is the height from which it's thrown, but since it's below the starting point, the displacement will be -8 meters (because the ball ends up 8 meters below the starting point).

I can use the kinematic equation for vertical motion:

s = v₀y * t + (1/2) * a * t²

Where:
- s = -8 m (displacement)
- v₀y = -3.420 m/s
- a = g = 9.8 m/s² (but since it's downward, it's positive in the same direction as v₀y)
Wait, no. Let's clarify. The acceleration due to gravity is acting downward, which is the same direction as the initial velocity v₀y. So in the equation, the acceleration would be positive. So a = 9.8 m/s².

Plugging into the equation:

-8 = (-3.420) * t + 0.5 * 9.8 * t²

Let me write this equation correctly:

-8 = (-3.420)t + (4.9) t²

Rearranging:

4.9 t² - 3.420 t -8 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form at² + bt + c = 0. So a =4.9, b=-3.420, c=-8.

Wait, wait, no. Let me check:

The equation after bringing all terms to one side is:

4.9 t² -3.420 t -8 = 0

So a=4.9, b=-3.420, c=-8.

Wait, no, wait. Because when I move -8 to the right side, it becomes +8. Let me recompute.

Wait, the original equation is:

s = v₀y * t + 0.5 * a * t²

s is -8, v₀y is -3.420.

So:

-8 = (-3.420) t + (0.5)(9.8) t²

Which is:

-8 = -3.420 t +4.9 t²

Bringing all terms to the left:

4.9 t² -3.420 t + (-8 +8) → no, wait, wait.

Wait, it's easier to bring all terms to one side. Let's subtract the right side from both sides:

-8 - (-3.420 t) -4.9 t² =0 → -8 +3.420 t -4.9 t² =0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the equation easier:

4.9 t² -3.420 t +8 =0 → no, wait, because:

Wait, the equation is:

4.9 t² -3.420 t -8 =0.

Wait confusion arises. Let me re-derive.

s = -8 m = (v₀y) t + (1/2) a t²

v₀y = -3.420 m/s

a is 9.8 m/s² (since acceleration is downward, same direction as v₀y, so positive).

So:

-8 = (-3.420) * t + (0.5)(9.8) * t²

Which is:

-8 = (-3.420)t + 4.9 t²

Bringing all terms to the left:

4.9 t² -3.420 t +8 = 8 on the other side? Wait no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, original equation:

-8 = (-3.420) t +4.9 t²

Let me rearrange:

4.9 t² -3.420 t -8 = 0

Yes, that's correct.

So a=4.9, b=-3.420, c=-8.

Now, solving for t using quadratic formula:

t = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a)

Plugging in the values:

b² = (3.420)^2 = approx (3.42)^2. Let's compute 3.42 *3.42.

3*3=9, 3*.42*2= 2.52, 0.42^2= 0.1764. So 9 + 2.52 +0.1764= 11.6964. So b²≈11.6964.

Then, 4ac =4 *4.9*(-8) = 4*4.9=19.6; 19.6*(-8)= -156.8.

So the discriminant is b² -4ac = 11.6964 - (4*4.9*(-8)) → Wait, no. Because 4ac is 4*4.9*(-8) = -156.8. So in the discriminant, it's 11.6964 - (-156.8) → which is 11.6964 +156.8 = 168.4964.

So sqrt(168.4964) is approximately 12.98, since 12^2 is 144, 13^2 is 169. So sqrt(168.5) is just under 13, say about 12.98.

So t = [3.420 ±12.98 ]/(2*4.9) → denominator is 9.8.

So two solutions:

t = (3.420 +12.98)/(9.8) → (16.4)/9.8 ≈ 1.6735 seconds

t = (3.420 -12.98)/(9.8) → (-9.56)/9.8 ≈ -0.975 seconds.

Negative time doesn't make sense, so we take t≈1.6735 s.

Now, the horizontal distance is horizontal velocity multiplied by time.

v₀x = 9.397 m/s.

So distance x = v₀x * t ≈9.397 *1.6735.

Let me compute that.

9.397 *1.6 is approx 15.035.

9.397 *0.6735: Let's compute 9.397 *0.6 =5.638, 9.397 *0.0735≈0.691.

So 5.638 +0.691≈6.329.

Total x≈15.035 +6.329≈21.364 meters? Wait, that can't be right because the options are all below 15.

Hmm, wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere? Because the answer isn't among the options. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the quadratic equation. Let me recheck.

The equation was:

-8 = (-3.420) t +4.9 t²

Which becomes:

4.9 t² -3.420 t -8 =0.

So a=4.9, b=-3.420, c=-8.

Quadratic formula:

t = [3.420 ± sqrt( (3.420)^2 -4*4.9*(-8) ) ]/(2*4.9)

Compute discriminant again:

(3.420)^2 = 11.6964.

4*4.9*(-8) → 19.6*(-8)= -156.8.

So discriminant is 11.6964 - (4*4.9*(-8)) → 11.6964 +156.8 =168.4964.

Square root of 168.4964 → as before, around 12.98.

So t = [3.420 +12.98 ]/(9.8) → (16.4)/9.8≈1.6735 s.

t = [3.420 -12.98 ]/(9.8) → (-9.56)/9.8≈-0.975 s. Discard.

So time is correct.

v₀x is 10 * cos(20°). Let's compute that more accurately. Cos(20)= approx 0.9396926.

So v₀x=10 *0.9396926≈9.3969 m/s.

So x=9.3969 *1.6735 ≈ Let me calculate that precisely.

1.6735 *9.3969:

Let me compute 1.6735 *9 = 15.0615.

1.6735 *0.3969 → let's compute 1.6735 *0.3 =0.50205; 1.6735 *0.0969≈0.1622. So total ≈0.50205+0.1622=0.66425.

So total x≈15.0615 +0.66425≈15.7258 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest is J:14.2. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Because none of the options are near 15.7 m.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial velocity components. Let's double-check the angle.

Oh wait, the angle is below the horizontal, so the initial vertical component is downward, but when considering the displacement, it's actually adding to the distance the ball has to fall.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the initial vertical velocity as positive? Wait, no, because in the equation, the displacement is -8 m, and the initial velocity is downward, so it's negative. Oh wait, in my equation, s=-8, v₀y=-3.42, a=9.8 (positive).

Wait, but perhaps the acceleration should be -9.8? Because when I took downward as positive, the acceleration is positive. No, that's correct.

Wait, wait another approach. Perhaps I should model upward as positive. Let me try that.

Let me redefine the coordinate system with upward as positive.

So initial vertical velocity v₀y = -3.42 m/s (since it's downward).

Acceleration a = -9.8 m/s² (because gravity acts downward, which is negative in this system).

Displacement s = -8 m (since the ball ends 8 m below the starting point).

So the equation becomes:

s = v₀y * t + 0.5 * a * t²

So:

-8 = (-3.42) * t + 0.5*(-9.8) *t²

Which is:

-8 = -3.42 t -4.9 t²

Bring all terms to left:

4.9 t² +3.42 t -8 =0.

Wait, let me move everything to the left:

-8 +3.42 t +4.9 t² =0 → 4.9 t² +3.42 t -8 =0.

So a=4.9, b=3.42, c=-8.

Now, compute discriminant: b²-4ac = (3.42)^2 -4*(4.9)*(-8) → 11.6964 + 156.8 = 168.4964, same as before.

So sqrt(168.4964)=12.98.

So t = [-3.42 ±12.98 ]/(2*4.9) → denominator is 9.8.

So two solutions:

t = (-3.42 +12.98)/9.8 → (9.56)/9.8≈ 0.975 seconds.

t= (-3.42 -12.98)/9.8 → (-16.4)/9.8≈-1.673 s. Disregarded.

So time is about 0.975 seconds.

Now, compute x= v₀x * t.

v₀x was 10 * cos(20) ≈9.3969 m/s.

x≈9.3969 *0.975.

Compute 9.3969 *0.975:

0.975 is 1 - 0.025.

So 9.3969 *1 =9.3969

9.3969 *0.025=0.2349225.

So 9.3969 -0.2349225≈9.162 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:10.5, but no. Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 9.3969 *0.975.

Alternatively, 9.3969 *0.975 = ?

Let me compute 9.3969 * (975/1000) = (9.3969 *975)/1000.

But maybe an easier way: 9 *0.975 =8.775, 0.3969 *0.975≈0.3865.

So total ≈8.775+0.3865≈9.1615 m.

So about 9.16 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 9.2, which is very close. So probably the correct answer is B:9.2 m.

Wait, but earlier when I took downward as positive, I got a much larger x. What's the difference here?

Ah, I think I messed up the coordinate system earlier. Let me clarify.

In the first approach, I took downward as positive, so:

s (displacement) = -8 m (since it's going down from the window, which is 8 m high).

v₀y = -3.42 m/s (because initial velocity is downward, but in the coordinate system where downward is positive, that would actually be positive. Wait, no, no. Wait, if downward is positive, then the initial velocity is +3.42 m/s, because it's thrown downward. Oh wait, I think I messed up the signs in the first approach.

Ah, here's the mistake. In the first approach, when I took downward as positive, the initial vertical velocity should have been positive 3.42 m/s, not negative.

So let me re-calculate with correct signs.

First approach (corrected):

Take downward as positive.

v₀y = +3.42 m/s.

a = +9.8 m/s².

s = -8 m (since displacement is downward 8 m).

So equation:

s = v₀y t + 0.5 a t²

-8 =3.42 t +4.9 t².

Rearranged:

4.9 t² +3.42 t +8 =0 → No, because moving all to left:

-8 -3.42 t -4.9 t² =0 → 4.9 t² +3.42 t +8 =0.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the equation is:

-8 =3.42 t +4.9 t² → 4.9 t² +3.42 t +8 =0 → Quadratic equation: a=4.9, b=3.42, c=8.

Discriminant: (3.42)^2 -4*4.9*8 → 11.6964 - 156.8 = -145.1036.

Negative discriminant means no real solution, which can't be correct. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have s as +8 m? Because if I take downward as positive, the displacement is +8 m. Let me re-express.

Wait, no. The window is 8 m above the ground. So when the ball is released, it's at position 0. When it hits the ground, it's 8 meters below the starting point. So in a coordinate system where downward is positive, the displacement s is +8 m.

So equation becomes:

s= v₀y t +0.5 a t².

So 8 =3.42 t +4.9 t².

Which rearranges to 4.9 t² +3.42 t -8=0.

Wait, but that's the same equation as when I took upward as positive in the second approach. So it gives t≈0.975 s. Then the horizontal distance is 9.3969 *0.975≈9.16 m, which matches the second approach.

So earlier in the first approach, I had the initial velocity v₀y as negative, which was incorrect. It should have been positive because in that coordinate system, downward is positive.

So the correct time is approximately 0.975 seconds, leading to a horizontal distance of around 9.16 m, which is very close to option B:9.2 m.

Wait, but why the discrepancy in the two approaches? Because in the first approach, I incorrectly assigned the initial velocity as negative. Once corrected, both approaches yield the same time.

So the correct answer should be approximately 9.16 meters, which is closest to option B:9.2.

But wait, let me compute the exact value more accurately to see if it's exactly 9.2 or perhaps another option.

Compute t exactly:

t = [-3.42 + sqrt(3.42² +4*4.9*8)]/(2*4.9) →
