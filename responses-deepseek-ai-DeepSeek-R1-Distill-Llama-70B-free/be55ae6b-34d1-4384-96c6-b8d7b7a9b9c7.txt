Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. 

A boy is leaning over a railway bridge that's 49 feet high. He sees a train approaching at a uniform speed, and he tries to drop a stone down the funnel. He releases the stone when the engine is 80 feet away from the bridge. Then, he sees the stone hit the ground 3 feet in front of the engine. The question is, what's the speed of the train?

Hmm. So the boy is on a bridge, right? The bridge is 49 ft high. The train is approaching, and when the boy releases the stone, the train's engine is 80 ft away from the bridge. Then, the stone hits the ground 3 ft in front of the engine. So I need to find the speed of the train.

I think I should model this as a problem involving the motion of both the stone and the train. Since the stone is released, it's under the influence of gravity, so its motion is solely due to gravity. Meanwhile, the train is moving at a constant speed, so its motion is uniform.

Let me break it down. 

When the boy releases the stone, two things happen: 
1. The stone starts falling from the bridge towards the ground. Its initial vertical velocity is zero (since he just drops it), and it accelerates downward due to gravity.
2. The train is moving towards the bridge at a constant speed. The distance the train needs to cover until the stone hits the ground is 80 ft minus 3 ft, because the stone lands 3 ft in front of the engine. Wait, no, wait. Because when the stone is released, the engine is 80 ft away from the bridge. Then, during the time the stone is falling, the train is moving towards the bridge. But the stone hits the ground 3 ft in front of the engine. So the train's engine has moved some distance, and the stone has fallen 49 ft, landing 3 ft ahead of where the engine was when it started.

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram. Let me visualize it. At time t=0: the engine is 80 ft away from the bridge. The stone is released and starts falling. The stone takes some time t to reach the ground (49 ft below). During that same time t, the train moves from 80 ft away to a point where it's 3 ft beyond where the stone landed. Wait, no. Wait, the stone lands 3 ft in front of the engine's position at t=0. Or does it land 3 ft in front of the engine's position at time t?

Wait, the problem says: "sees the stone hit the ground 3 ft in front of the engine." So at the moment the stone hits the ground, the engine has moved to a position where the stone is 3 ft in front of it. So yes, the stone lands 3 ft in front of the engine at the time of impact.

So, the stone is dropped from 49 ft. It takes time t to fall. In that time, the train moves from 80 ft away to a point where it's 3 ft behind where the stone lands. So the distance the train covers in time t is (80 ft - 3 ft), because the stone is 3 ft ahead of the engine when it hits the ground.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. At t=0, engine is 80 ft away from the bridge. Stone is dropped. At time t, stone hits the ground 3 ft in front of the engine. So during time t, the engine has moved (80 ft - 3 ft) = 77 ft towards the bridge, and then 3 ft beyond? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait no, perhaps the engine moves towards the bridge, so the distance it covers is (80 - x), where x is the position where the stone lands relative to the bridge. Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's consider the positions.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me say that the bridge is at position x=0. So when the stone is released (t=0), the engine is at x = -80 ft (since it's 80 ft away from the bridge, approaching it). The stone is at x = 0, y = 49 ft.

The stone is subject to free fall, so its vertical position as a function of time is y = 49 - (1/2) g t². Wait, no, gravity is acting downward, so the vertical displacement would be y(t) = 49 - (1/2)g t²? Wait, actually, the correct equation should be h(t) = h0 - (1/2) g t², but I'm getting confused with signs. Alternatively, using y(t) = y0 - (1/2) g t², where y0 is 49 ft, and when the stone hits the ground, y(t) = 0.

So 0 = 49 - (1/2) g t². Solving for t: (1/2) g t² = 49 → t² = (2 *49)/g → t = sqrt(98/g).

But I'm more comfortable using feet and seconds. I remember that g is approximately 32 ft/s². So let's compute t.

t = sqrt(98/32) = sqrt(3.0625) = 1.75 seconds. Wait, because 32 * 3 =96, so 98/32 is 3.0625, whose square root is 1.75.

So the stone takes 1.75 seconds to hit the ground.

Now, during this time, the train is moving towards the bridge. The engine starts at x = -80 ft (80 ft from the bridge). Let the speed of the train be v ft/s. Then, in time t, the engine moves a distance of v * t.

But where is the stone when it hits the ground? The stone is at x=0, because it was dropped straight down from the bridge. Wait, no, the stone is dropped, so it's moving vertically, so it should land right below the bridge, at x=0. But the problem says the stone lands 3 ft in front of the engine. Wait, so perhaps I misunderstood the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the boy is not directly above the railroad tracks. Maybe when he drops the stone, it's not straight down but perhaps at an angle. Or maybe the bridge is over the tracks, so when the stone is dropped, it lands on the tracks. But then the train is approaching, so perhaps the stone doesn't land at the same point as the bridge. Hmm, no, the bridge is stationary, so the stone would land at the base of the bridge, which is 49 ft below. But the train is moving along the tracks towards the bridge.

Wait, the problem says that the stone hits the ground 3 ft in front of the engine. So when the stone hits the ground, the engine has moved to a position that's 3 ft behind where the stone landed. So, the stone is at x=0, and the engine is at x=3 ft when the stone hits the ground. Wait, no. Let me visualize this again.

At t=0: engine is at x=-80 ft, bridge is at x=0. Stone is dropped from x=0, y=49 ft.

At time t, stone hits ground at x=0, y=0. At the same time, the engine is at x = position where it's 3 ft behind the stone's landing point. So engine is at x=3 ft? No, wait, if the stone lands at x=0, then 3 ft in front of the engine would mean the engine is at x= -3 ft, because the stone is 3 ft ahead. Or perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the engine has moved from x=-80 to x = (stone's landing position minus 3 ft). But the stone's landing position is at x=0, so the engine is at x= -3 ft. That would mean the engine has moved 77 ft towards the bridge in time t.

Wait, but that would make the distance the train covers as 80 -3 =77 ft. So the train covers 77 ft in 1.75 seconds. So speed v = 77 /1.75 ft/s.

Wait, let me calculate that. 77 /1.75 = 44 ft/s. But that seems way too high because trains don't go 44 ft/s. Let me check my units.

Wait, 1 ft/s is approximately 0.6818 mph. So 44 ft/s * 0.6818 ≈ 30 mph. That's a more reasonable speed.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm getting the positions right. Alternatively, perhaps the stone lands 3 ft in front of the engine's position at time t. So the engine is moving towards the bridge, and when the stone hits the ground, the engine is 3 ft behind the point where the stone landed.

Wait, the stone lands at x=0, so the engine would be at x=3 ft, 3 ft behind the stone's landing point. Wait, no, if the engine is moving towards the bridge, which is at x=0, then when the stone hits the ground, the engine is at x= (distance covered) from its initial position. So initial position was x=-80 ft. So the engine moves to x = (-80) + v * t.

At the same time, the stone lands at x=0. The problem says the stone is 3 ft in front of the engine when it lands. So, the engine's position at time t is x_engine = (-80) + v * t. And the stone's position is x_stone = 0. The distance between them is 3 ft, so x_stone - x_engine = 3 ft.

So 0 - [ (-80) + v t ] = 3 → 80 - v t = 3 → v t = 77 → v = 77 / t.

We have t = 1.75 s, so v = 77 /1.75 = 44 ft/s. Now, convert that to mph.

Since 1 ft/s = 0.681818 mph, so 44 * 0.681818 = let's compute that.

44 * 0.681818... Let's see, 40 * 0.681818 = 27.2727, and 4 * 0.681818 ≈ 2.72727. So total approximately 27.2727 + 2.72727 ≈ 30 mph.

So the speed of the train is approximately 30 mph. Let me check the options, option C is 30 mph. So the answer should be C.

Wait, did I make any mistakes in the signs? Let me double-check.

The stone's position when it lands is x=0. The engine's position is x = -80 + v t. The stone is 3 ft in front of the engine, so the engine is 3 ft behind the stone. So, engine's position is x = 0 -3 = -3 ft. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the engine is moving towards the bridge, so it's going from x=-80 towards x=0. So when the stone is at x=0, the engine is at x = x_engine = -80 + v t. The stone is at x=0, so the distance between the engine and the stone is |x_engine - x_stone| = | (-80 + v t) - 0 | = |v t -80|. But the problem says this distance is 3 ft, with the stone being in front of the engine. So the engine is 3 ft behind the stone. So engine's position is 3 ft behind the stone's position, which is at x=0. So engine is at x=-3 ft. Therefore, the engine has moved from x=-80 to x=-3 ft. So the distance covered is 77 ft (from -80 to -3 is 77 ft). So that's correct.

But wait, the stone lands at x=0, so the engine is at x=-3 when the stone lands. So the distance covered by the engine is 77 ft, which is from -80 to -3, which is 77 ft. So v = 77 / 1.75 = 44 ft/s.

So 44 ft/s is the speed. To convert to mph: 44 * 0.681818 ≈ 30 mph.

So the answer is C: 30 mph.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of both the stone and the train. The stone is dropped from a height of 49 ft and takes time \( t \) to hit the ground. During this time, the train moves from 80 ft away to a point where it is 3 ft behind the stone's landing position. The goal is to determine the speed of the train.

### Step 1: Time for the stone to hit the ground
The stone is dropped from rest, so its vertical motion is governed by the equation:

\[
y(t) = y_0 - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

where \( y_0 = 49 \, \text{ft} \) is the initial height, \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( y(t) = 0 \) when the stone hits the ground. Solving for \( t \):

\[
0 = 49 - \frac{1}{2} (32) t^2
\]

\[
t^2 = \frac{98}{32} = 3.0625
\]

\[
t = \sqrt{3.0625} = 1.75 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Thus, the stone takes \( t = 1.75 \, \text{seconds} \) to hit the ground.

### Step 2: Distance traveled by the train
At \( t = 0 \), the train is 80 ft away from the bridge. When the stone hits the ground, the train is 3 ft behind the stone's landing position. Therefore, the train travels:

\[
\text{Distance} = 80 - 3 = 77 \, \text{ft}
\]

The speed of the train is then:

\[
v = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{77}{1.75} = 44 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 3: Convert speed to mph
To convert the speed from ft/s to mph, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{ft/s} = 0.681818 \, \text{mph} \):

\[
v = 44 \times 0.681818 \approx 30 \, \text{mph}
\]

### Final Answer
The speed of the train is approximately **30 mph**.
