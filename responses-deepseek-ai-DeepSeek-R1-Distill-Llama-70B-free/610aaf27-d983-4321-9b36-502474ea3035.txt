Okay, so I have this statistics problem here about waiting times for a roller coaster. The question says that the waiting times are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. There are 150,000 riders the first summer, and I need to find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders. The options are A through J, each giving different time intervals.

Hmm, let me think. Since the distribution is normal, the first thing that comes to mind is the 68-95-99.7 rule. That rule says that about 68% of data lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% within 2, and 99.7% within 3.

Wait, but the question is about 100,000 riders. Since there are 150,000 total, that's two-thirds, right? So approximately 66.66%. That's close to 68%, which is about one standard deviation.

So if I take one standard deviation from the mean, that should cover about 68% of the data. Let's calculate that. The mean is 35, standard deviation is 10. So one standard deviation below the mean is 35 - 10 = 25, and one above is 35 +10 =45. So the interval is 25 to 45 minutes. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Option D is 25.3 to 44.7. That's close. Why those specific numbers? Oh, wait, maybe it's using more precise z-scores. So perhaps not exactly 25 and 45, but something more precise.

Alternatively, maybe it's using the empirical rule but with more exact z-scores. Let me think: 68% is roughly 1 z-score. So the mean is 35, and with a z of 1, we have 35 ±10, which gives 25 to 45.

But wait, the options don't have that, except option D. So why does D have 25.3 and 44.7? Oh, perhaps because it's using 34.13% on each side? Wait, no, that would be for 68% in the middle. Wait, wait—wait, perhaps it's a two-tailed scenario where the middle 68% is between approximately 25.3 and 44.7. Let me think: for the 68% between, the z-scores would be approximately -1 and +1. So with a mean of 35, subtracting 10 gives 25, adding 10 gives 45. But perhaps the more precise values are 35 ± (Z * 10), where Z is 1. But wait, maybe it's more precise, like 1.0 exactly. So perhaps the exact calculation would give 25.0 and 45.0. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is about the shortest interval that captures 100,000 riders. So 100,000 is approximately 2/3 of 150,000. So that's about 66.66%. So the closest is the 68% interval. So, the interval should be around 25-45 minutes.

But looking at the options, option D is 25.3 to 44.7. That's the closest to 25-45. So that's probably the answer. But wait, why 25.3 and 44.7? Maybe because the exact z-score for 34% in each tail isn't exactly 1.0. Wait, wait, the z-score for 68% is approximately 1.0, but perhaps more precisely, it's 1.0 exactly. So 35-10=25, 35+10=45. So why is the option D 25.3-44.7?

Wait, maybe it's using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the shortest interval that includes 100,000 riders, which would mean the narrowest interval possible that still contains 2/3 of the data.

Wait, if the distribution is symmetric, the narrowest interval would be centered at the mean. So perhaps that interval is from 35 - x to 35 + x, such that the area under the curve is 2/3 (since 100,000 is 2/3 of 150,000). So using the normal distribution, I can find the x such that the probability within x minutes of the mean covers 2/3 of the riders.

To find this, I'd need to use the z-table or a calculator. The z-score for which the area between -z and +z is 2/3 (0.6667). Let me think, what z-score gives a cumulative probability of (1 + 0.6667)/2 = 0.83335. Looking at the standard normal table, what z gives around 0.8333?

Looking it up: The z-score for 0.83 is about 0.92, because:

- z=0.9 gives 0.8159

- z=0.91 gives approximately 0.8186

Wait, wait, perhaps I should be precise. Let me recall that z=0.95 gives 0.8241, and z=1.0 gives 0.8413.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for z is the probability that Z is less than z. So if I have a two-tailed probability of 0.6667, that means the area in the middle is 0.6667, so each tail is (1 - 0.6667)/2 = 0.16665.

So the CDF value we're looking for is 0.5 + (0.6667/2) = 0.5 + 0.3333 = 0.8333. So we need to find the z where Φ(z) = 0.8333.

From the standard normal table, let's see:

z=0.93: Φ(0.93)= approx 0.8233

z=0.94: approx 0.8269

z=0.95: 0.8297

z=0.96: 0.8325

z=0.97: 0.8353

z=0.98: 0.8385

z=0.99: 0.8413

Wait, but 0.8333 is between z=0.96 (0.8325) and z=0.97 (0.8353). Let me interpolate.

The difference between z=0.96 and z=0.97 is 0.8353 - 0.8325 = 0.0028.

We need Φ(z) = 0.8333, which is 0.8333 - 0.8325 = 0.0008 above 0.8325.

So the fraction is 0.0008 / 0.0028 ≈ 0.2857. So z ≈ 0.96 + 0.2857*(0.01) ≈ 0.962857. So approximately 0.963.

So the z-score is approximately 0.963. Then, the standard deviation is 10 minutes. So the interval is 35 ± (0.963 *10) = 35 ±9.63. That gives lower bound 35 -9.63 =25.37, upper 35+9.63=44.63. So approximately 25.4 to 44.6. Looking at the options, option D is 25.3 to44.7, which is very close. So option D would be the answer.

So the interval is about 25.3 to44.7 minutes, which captures approximately 66.67% of the riders, which is about the 100,000 riders. So the answer should be D.

The waiting times for the roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. The question asks for the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders out of 150,000, which corresponds to approximately 66.67% of the data. This is close to the 68% of data that lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean in a normal distribution.

Using the 68-95-99.7 rule, the interval for 68% of the data would typically be 1 standard deviation from the mean. However, since the question specifies 66.67%, a slightly more precise calculation is required. The z-score for the cumulative probability of 0.8333 (which corresponds to 66.67% in the middle) is approximately 0.963. Multiplying this z-score by the standard deviation (10 minutes) gives the interval:

\[
35 \pm (0.963 \times 10) = 35 \pm 9.63
\]

This results in the interval:

\[
25.37 \text{ to } 44.63 \text{ minutes}
\]

Among the given options, the closest match is **25.3 to 44.7 minutes**, which corresponds to option D. This interval captures approximately 66.67% of the riders, making it the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders.

**Answer: D**
