Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me about silicate minerals and the ions they're made of. Hmm, I remember that silicates involve silicon and oxygen, right? The question is asking about the electronic configurations of the Si^4+ and O^2- ions.

Wait, what do I know about ions and their electron configurations? I think when elements form ions, they gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable configuration, usually like the nearest noble gas.

So, silicon normally has an atomic number of 14. Its electron configuration is... let me think. Neutral silicon has electrons filled up to the third shell. The configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p². Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. For silicon, the ground state electron configuration is [Ne] 3s² 3p², right? Because the atomic number is 14, which is after neon (10), so 14-10=4 electrons in the n=3 shell.

Now, when silicon forms a +4 ion, it loses four electrons. So it would lose the 3p and 3s electrons, I suppose. Because the 3p has 2 electrons and 3s has 2, so together that's 4. So losing those would leave silicon as Si^4+ with a configuration of [Ne], which is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶. Because [Ne] is 10 electrons, and 14-4=10.

What about oxygen? Oxygen has an atomic number of 8. Neutral oxygen has an electron configuration of 1s² 2s² 2p⁴. When it gains two electrons to form O²⁻, it adds those electrons to the 2p orbital. So, 2p⁴ plus 2 electrons becomes 2p⁶. So the configuration would be 1s² 2s² 2p⁶.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Oxygen's neutral configuration is [He] 2s² 2p⁴. Adding two electrons would make it 2p⁶, so the O²⁻ ion would have the configuration [Ne], which is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶.

So putting it together, the Si^4+ ion has the configuration 1s²2s²2p⁶, and O^2- also has 1s²2s²2p⁶. Let me look at the options.

Option A says Si^4+ is 1s²2s²2p⁶ and O^2- is the same. That fits what I just thought. Option B has O^2- with 2p⁴, which would be neutral oxygen. No, that's not right. Option E has Si with 3s²3p²; that's for neutral Si, not the ion. Option F has both ions with 3p^6, but that's beyond the expected shells. Oh wait, no—Si^4+ would lose the 3s and 3p electrons, ending at 2p^6. So F's Si^4+ is 1s²2s²2p^6 3s^0 3p^6? No, that's not possible because 3p^6 would require more electrons than silicon has when it's +4. I think F is wrong.

So looking again, option A: both ions have 1s²2s²2p^6. That seems correct. Let me make sure. Si^4+ would have 10 electrons (since 14-4=10), which matches [Ne]. O^2- would have 8+2=10 electrons as well, which is [Ne], matching the same. So yes, option A is the right choice.

To determine the electronic configurations of the Si⁴⁺ and O²⁻ ions in silicate materials, we start by analyzing the electron configurations of their neutral forms and how they change when ions are formed.

1. **Silicon (Si):**  
   Neutral silicon has an atomic number of 14, with an electron configuration of:  
   \[ 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^2 \]  
   When silicon forms the Si⁴⁺ ion, it loses four electrons—specifically the two electrons from the 3s orbital and the two electrons from the 3p orbital. This leaves the configuration:  
   \[ 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 \]  
   This is the same as the noble gas neon ([Ne]).

2. **Oxygen (O):**  
   Neutral oxygen has an atomic number of 8, with an electron configuration of:  
   \[ 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4 \]  
   When oxygen forms the O²⁻ ion, it gains two electrons, which are added to the 2p orbital. This results in:  
   \[ 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 \]  
   This is also the same as the noble gas neon ([Ne]).

3. **Analysis of Options:**  
   - **Option A:** Si⁴⁺: \( 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 \), O²⁻: \( 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 \)  
     This matches the derived configurations for both ions.  
   - **Option B:** O²⁻ has \( 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4 \), which corresponds to neutral oxygen, not O²⁻.  
   - **Option E:** Si⁴⁺ retains 3s² 3p², which is incorrect because Si⁴⁺ loses all 3s and 3p electrons.  
   - **Option F:** Both ions are given as \( 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3p^6 \), which is incorrect because Si⁴⁺ does not have electrons in the 3p orbital.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately reflects the electronic configurations of Si⁴⁺ and O²⁻ ions.
