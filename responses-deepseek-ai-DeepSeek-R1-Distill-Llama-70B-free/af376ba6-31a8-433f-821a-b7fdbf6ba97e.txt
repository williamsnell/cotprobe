Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light reflection and refraction. Hmm, I remember that when light hits a boundary between two media, some of it reflects and some refracts. But wait, the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength. Oh right, this must be about interference of light waves.

The setup is white light incident normally on a puddle of water. On the water, there's a thin layer of oil. The oil has an index of refraction of 1.5, and the water is 1.33. So the layers are air (n=1), oil (n=1.5), then water (n=1.33). Wait, but usually when oil floats on water, the oil is less dense, but here oil's index is higher. Oh, but index isn't directly about density, it's about how much the light slows down.

Wait, the light is coming from air, hitting the oil first. So the first reflection is air to oil. Then the second reflection is oil to water. Both these reflections would interfere.

I think when light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of 180 degrees (like when going from air to water, which is higher n). But when it goes from higher to lower n, there's no phase shift. So for each reflection, I need to consider whether it's going to a higher or lower index.

First reflection: air (n=1) to oil (n=1.5). Since 1.5 >1, reflection causes a phase shift of 180 degrees.

Second reflection: oil (1.5) to water (1.33). Now, 1.33 < 1.5, so this reflection is going from higher to lower n. So no phase shift here.

Wait wait, but the second reflection is when the light goes through the oil and hits the water. So the transmitted light from air to oil goes through, then hits water. At that interface, the light is going from oil (1.5) to water (1.33). So the reflection here (second reflection) is from a lower index, so no phase shift.

So the two reflected waves are: the first reflection (phase shift 180) and the second reflection (no phase shift).

Wait, but wait. The second reflection is from the oil-water interface, but the wave that's reflected there has to travel back through the oil layer. So that might change things.

Wait, so the two waves that interfere are:

1. The wave reflected from the top surface of the oil (air-oil interface). This wave has a phase shift of 180 degrees.

2. The wave that goes through the oil, reflects off the oil-water interface, and comes back up. This second wave doesn't have a phase shift upon reflection. But it travels through the oil twice (down and back up), so the path difference is 2t, where t is the thickness of the oil.

But wait, the thickness is 500 nm. So 2t = 1000 nm.

Now, the condition for constructive interference (strong reflection) is when the path difference plus any phase shifts leads to the waves being in phase.

But wait, how does the phase shift affect this? The first wave has a phase shift of 180 degrees, and the second wave doesn't. So when considering interference, the effective path difference is 2t plus any phase shifts converted into a path difference.

Wait, another approach: the condition for constructive interference is when the total phase difference is an integer multiple of 2π.

The phase change upon reflection for each wave:

- First reflection (air-oil): 180 degrees (which is π radians).
- Second reflection (oil-water): 0 degrees.

So the total phase difference between the two waves is:

Phase difference = (2π/λ) * 2t * n_oil + (phase change difference)

Wait, phase change difference is π, because the first reflection has a phase shift of π and the second has none. So the net phase shift between them is π.

Wait, no. The first wave has a phase shift of π, and the second wave has none. So when they meet, the phase difference is π plus any from the path difference.

So the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference (after considering the medium) introduces a phase shift that, when added to the π shift, results in a multiple of 2π.

Wait, the path difference is 2t (since the wave goes down and up) multiplied by the refractive index of oil, because the light is traveling through the oil. So the physical path is 2t, but the optical path is 2t * n.

So the phase difference from the path is (2π/λ) * (2t * n) )

So the total phase difference is (2π/λ) * (2t n) ) + π.

For constructive interference, this should be equal to m*2π, where m is integer.

So,

(2π/λ) * (2t n) ) + π = 2π m

Divide both sides by π,

(2/λ)*(2 t n) ) + 1 = 2m

So,

(4 t n )/λ + 1 = 2m

We can rearrange for λ:

(4 t n)/λ = 2m -1

λ = (4 t n) / (2m-1)

We need to find the wavelength that satisfies this equation for some integer m.

Given t = 500 nm, n = 1.5.

Plug in the values:

λ = (4 * 500 nm * 1.5 ) / (2m -1 )

Calculate numerator:

4 * 500 = 2000. 2000 *1.5=3000. So,

λ = 3000 nm / (2m-1)

We are looking for λ in the visible spectrum, which is approximately 400 nm to 700 nm.

Let me compute possible m values:

For m=1:

λ = 3000/(2*1 -1) = 3000/1 = 3000 nm. That's way beyond visible (infrared), so not in options.

m=2:

λ=3000/(4-1)=3000/3=1000 nm. Still in IR, not visible.

m=3:

3000/(5) =600 nm. That's within visible (red).

m=4:

3000/(7)= approx 428.57 nm. Still visible (violet/blue).

m=5: 3000/(9)=333.33 nm. UV, not visible.

So the possible λ in the visible are 600 nm (m=3) and 428.57 nm (m=4). Let's see which of these is an option.

Looking at the options: A:750, B:350, C:450, D:650, E:550, F:500, G:600, H:400, I:700, J:800.

So 600 nm is option G, and 428.57 is around 430, which is close to option H (400) and C (450). Wait, but 428 isn't an option. So the possible candidates are 600 nm (option G) and 450 nm (option C). But wait, wait.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the condition. Because another thought: when the path difference is an odd multiple of half-wavelength, and considering the phase shifts, it can lead to constructive or destructive interference.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct condition is different.

Wait, another approach: the two reflected waves are wave 1 (reflected at air-oil) and wave 2 (reflected at oil-water, after traveling 2t in oil).

Wave 1 has a phase shift of π, and wave 2 has no phase shift. So the total phase difference between wave 1 and wave 2 is:

Δφ = (2π n t / λ)*2 + π

Wait, no. The path difference is 2t * n (because the light travels through oil twice, so 2t distance, each multiplied by n for optical path). So the phase shift from path is (2t * n) * (2π/λ) )

So Δφ = (4 π n t ) / λ  + π (because wave 1 has a phase shift of π relative to wave 2)

Wait, no, because wave 2 doesn't have a phase shift upon reflection, but wave 1 does. So the initial phase shift is π between them.

Thus, the total phase difference is (4 π n t )/λ  + π.

Constructive interference when Δφ = 2π m.

So,

(4 π n t )/λ + π = 2 π m

Divide both sides by π,

4 n t / λ + 1 = 2 m

So,

4 n t / λ = 2m -1

Which brings us back to the same equation as before.

So λ = (4 n t) / (2m-1 )

So for m=1: 3000/1 = 3000 nm → too big.

m=2: 3000/3=1000 nm → IR.

m=3: 3000/5=600 nm → option G.

m=4: 3000/7≈428.57 nm → not an option. So the possible visible wavelengths are 600 nm and 428.57 nm.

Looking at the options, 600 is there (G) and 450 is close to 428 (option C is 450, which is a bit higher). So which one is correct?

Wait, wait. The possible m values give λ=600 nm and ~428 nm. So 600 is in the options, but 428 isn't. So the correct answer would be 600 nm, option G. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A:750 nm

B:350 nm

C:450 nm

D:650 nm

E:550 nm

F:500 nm

G:600 nm

So 600 is an option, but what about 428 nm? There's option H:400 nm and B:350, C:450. 428 is closest to 450, but it's not exact. So perhaps the correct answer is 600 nm, which is present.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Because sometimes when both reflections cause a phase shift, or neither, it's constructive. Wait, in this scenario:

Wave 1: reflection at air-oil (high to low? No, air (1) to oil (1.5) → higher index, so reflection has phase shift of π.

Wave 2: reflection at oil-water (1.5 to 1.33) → higher to lower, so no phase shift.

So wave 1 has phase shift π, wave 2 has 0. So their phase difference is π plus any path difference.

But the path difference is 2t * n (since wave 2 travels through oil twice, which has higher n). So the path difference in terms of wavelength is (2t n)/λ. So the phase difference from the path is (2π)(2t n)/λ.

So total phase difference is:

Δφ = (4 π n t) / λ + π.

We set this equal to 2π m for constructive.

So,

(4 π n t) / λ + π = 2 π m

Divide both sides by π,

4 n t /λ + 1 = 2 m

So,

λ = (4 n t) / (2m -1 )

Which is what I had before.

So for m=3, λ=600 nm. This is in the options.

Another thing to check: is there any other possible condition? Like for destructive interference, but the question is about the most strongly reflected wavelength, which implies constructive interference.

So the answer would be G:600 nm.

Wait wait, but wait another thing. The condition when the waves interfere constructively is when the total phase difference is an integer multiple of 2π. So when (4 n t / λ) +1 = 2m.

But perhaps we can rearrange it as:

4 n t / λ = 2m -1 → λ = (4 n t) / (2m-1)

Now, possible m values.

m=1 → λ=3000 nm (IR)

m=2 → λ=1000 nm (IR)

m=3 → λ=600 nm (visible)

m=4 → λ= approx 428.57 nm (violet, visible)

m=5 → 3000/9= 333 nm (UV)

So the possible visible λ are 600 nm and ~428.57 nm.

Looking at the options:

Options are G:600, C:450, H:400.

So 428.57 is not an exact option. The closest is C:450. But 450 is not exactly that. So perhaps the strongest reflection is at 600 nm, since that's exactly in the options and it's a longer wavelength.

Wait, but why would 600 be the most strongly reflected? Because when the path difference and phase shifts result in constructive interference, that particular wavelength gets reinforced.

So in this case, the correct answer is G:600 nm.

But wait, the question says white light is incident. So all wavelengths are present, but the one that interferes constructively is the most strongly reflected. So 600 nm is the answer.
</think>

To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we analyze the interference of light waves reflected from the air-oil and oil-water interfaces. The setup involves a thin oil layer (index of refraction \( n = 1.5 \), thickness \( t = 500 \, \text{nm} \)) floating on water (\( n = 1.33 \)). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Phase Shifts Upon Reflection**:
   - At the air-oil interface (\( n = 1 \) to \( n = 1.5 \)), the reflection causes a phase shift of \( \pi \) (180°) because the light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index.
   - At the oil-water interface (\( n = 1.5 \) to \( n = 1.33 \)), there is no phase shift because the light reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index.

2. **Path Difference**:
   - The second reflected wave (from the oil-water interface) travels through the oil layer twice (down and back up), resulting in a path difference of \( 2t \). Since the light travels through a medium with refractive index \( n = 1.5 \), the optical path difference is \( 2t \cdot n \).

3. **Condition for Constructive Interference**:
   - The total phase difference between the two reflected waves is given by:
     \[
     \Delta \phi = \frac{4 \pi n t}{\lambda} + \pi
     \]
     where the first term accounts for the optical path difference, and the second term accounts for the phase shift of \( \pi \) at the air-oil interface.
   - For constructive interference, the total phase difference must equal an integer multiple of \( 2\pi \):
     \[
     \frac{4 \pi n t}{\lambda} + \pi = 2 \pi m
     \]
     Dividing through by \( \pi \) and rearranging gives:
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{4 n t}{2m - 1}
     \]

4. **Calculating Wavelengths**:
   - Substituting \( n = 1.5 \) and \( t = 500 \, \text{nm} \):
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{4 \cdot 1.5 \cdot 500}{2m - 1} = \frac{3000}{2m - 1}
     \]
   - For \( m = 1 \): \( \lambda = 3000 \, \text{nm} \) (infrared, not visible).
   - For \( m = 2 \): \( \lambda = 1000 \, \text{nm} \) (infrared, not visible).
   - For \( m = 3 \): \( \lambda = 600 \, \text{nm} \) (visible, red).
   - For \( m = 4 \): \( \lambda \approx 428.57 \, \text{nm} \) (visible, violet).
   - For \( m = 5 \): \( \lambda \approx 333.33 \, \text{nm} \) (ultraviolet, not visible).

5. **Selecting the Correct Answer**:
   - The visible wavelengths are \( 600 \, \text{nm} \) and \( 428.57 \, \text{nm} \). Among the given options, only \( 600 \, \text{nm} \) (option G) matches exactly. The other visible wavelength (\( 428.57 \, \text{nm} \)) is not listed.

Thus, the most strongly reflected wavelength is **600 nm**.
