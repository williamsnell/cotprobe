Question:

Wilshire Street is a public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for northbound traffic. Wilshire and Figueroa Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. A businessman was driving his car east on Figueroa Street and did not see the traffic light. He entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. A woman, in violation of statute, was proceeding south on Wilshire Street, and she entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck the businessman's car. The businessman suffered damages in the amount of $5,000. The woman, on the other hand, suffered damages in the amount of $1,000. The businessman brought suit against the woman to recover his damages. The woman denied liability and filed a counterclaim against the businessman for her damages. Both drivers were negligent with 30 percent of the negligence attributable to the woman and 70 percent of the negligence attributable to the businessman. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: "A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties. " Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?

Options:

A: The businessman recovers $1,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $900 from the businessman.
B: The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.
C: The businessman recovers $3,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $300 from the businessman.
D: The businessman recovers $800 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.
E: The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.
F: The businessman recovers nothing from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.
G: The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.
H: The businessman recovers $2,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $500 from the businessman.
I: The businessman recovers $3,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $600 from the businessman.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a traffic accident and determining the appropriate judgment based on the given statute. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on tort law, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the scenario. There are two drivers involved in an accident. The businessman was driving east on Figueroa Street and didn't see the traffic light. He entered the intersection when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound. So he ran a red light, which is definitely negligence on his part.

Then there's the woman who was driving south on Wilshire Street. Wait, but Wilshire is a one-way street designated for northbound traffic. So she was going the wrong way, which is a violation of statute. She also didn't look for cross traffic before entering the intersection and hit the businessman's car.

So both drivers were negligent. The question states that 30% of the negligence is attributable to the woman, and 70% to the businessman. 

The businessman's damages are $5,000, and the woman's are $1,000. 

The statute in the jurisdiction says that a failure to exercise ordinary care (which contributes to injury/damage) doesn't bar recovery, but damages are diminished proportionally based on the person's own negligence. Also, there's no set-off between the parties. 

Wait, so this sounds like a comparative negligence jurisdiction, but the exact rules can vary. The key points are:

1. Each party's damages are reduced by their percentage of fault.
2. There's no set-off; each party's recovery is independent of the other's.

So in this case, the businessman is suing the woman, and she's countersuing him.

Let me think about how the damages would be calculated.

For the businessman's claim against the woman:

- His total damages are $5,000.
- His own negligence is 70%, so his recovery is reduced by 70%.
- So he can recover 30% of $5,000 from the woman.
- 30% of 5,000 is $1,500.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, in some jurisdictions, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault. So if the plaintiff is 70% at fault, they can recover only 30% of their damages.

So the businessman's recovery from the woman would be (100% - 70%) of his damages. So 30% of $5,000 is $1,500. So he gets $1,500 from the woman.

Now, what about the woman's counterclaim against the businessman?

Her total damages are $1,000.
Her negligence is 30%, so her recovery is reduced by 30%.
She can recover 70% of her damages from the businessman.
70% of $1,000 is $700.

So the woman would recover $700 from the businessman.

Now, the statute says there's no set-off of damages. So each party's recovery is separate; they don't offset each other.

So the total judgment would be: the businessman gets $1,500 from the woman, and the woman gets $700 from the businessman.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option A: Businessman recovers $1,000, woman recovers $900. No, that doesn't add up with my calculations.

Option B: Businessman gets $5k, woman $1k. No, that ignores the comparative negligence.

Option C: Businessman $3,500 (70% of 5k?), woman $300. Wait, 30% of 1k is 300. Wait, but the businessman's recovery would be 30% of 5k, which is 1.5k, not 3.5k. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the statute says damages are diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the injured party.

So for the businessman, his damages are $5k, and he's 70% at fault. So his recovery from the woman is 5k minus (70% of 5k). So 5k * (1 - 0.7) = 1.5k.

Similarly, the woman's damages are $1k, and she's 30% at fault. So her recovery is 1k * (1 - 0.3) = 700.

So looking for an option where the businessman recovers $1,500 and the woman $700.

Looking at the options:

Option G: Businessman $1,500, woman $700. Yes, that's option G.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Options:

A: Biz 1k, woman 900.

B: 5k and 1k.

C: 3.5k and 300.

D: 800 and 0.

E: 5k and 0.

F: 0 and 1k.

G: 1.5k and 700.

H: 2k and 500.

I: 3k and 600.

So option G matches my calculation.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the statute. The statute says "damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured." So the person's own negligence reduces their recovery. So for the businessman, 70% negligence reduces his recovery by 70%, so he can recover 30% of 5k, which is 1.5k. The woman's 30% negligence reduces her recovery by 30%, so she can recover 70% of 1k, which is 700.

So the correct answer should be G.

But wait, another thought: some jurisdictions follow a "no set-off" rule, meaning that if both parties are suing each other, each claim is handled separately, and they don't offset each other's damages. So the businessman's recovery isn't reduced by the woman's claim, and vice versa.

In this case, each party's recovery is based on their own percentage of fault. So the businessman's claim against the woman is 1.5k, and the woman's claim against him is 700. So the net result is that the businessman would pay the woman 700, and she would pay him 1,500. So the net to the businessman is 800, but that's not how the question is framed. The question is about the appropriate judgment, not the net.

Wait, the question is asking for the appropriate judgment, so each party's recovery is independent. So the judgment would be that the businessman recovers 1.5k from the woman, and the woman recovers 700 from the businessman. So that's option G.

Wait a minute, but looking back, the initial description says that the woman entered the intersection when the light was green for northbound (Wilshire) and red for eastbound (Figueroa). So the woman was going south on a one-way northbound street, which is illegal. So she's clearly negligent. The businessman ran a red light, which is also negligent.

So both are at fault, with the businessman 70% and woman 30%. So each is liable to the other only for their percentage of fault.

Wait, no, wait. The statute says that each party's damages are diminished by their own percentage of fault, but the other party's percentage isn't directly subtracted. Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently.

Wait, the woman's total damages are $1k. She was 30% at fault, so her recovery from the businessman is 70% of 1k, which is 700.

The businessman's damages are 5k, but he was 70% at fault, so he can recover 30% of 5k from the woman, which is 1.5k.

So the answer should be G.

Looking back, the options:

G: The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.

Yes, that's correct.
</think>

The question involves a traffic accident where both drivers are found to be negligent. The businessman is 70% at fault, and the woman is 30% at fault. The jurisdiction follows a comparative negligence rule, where damages are diminished in proportion to the negligence of the injured party, and there is no set-off of damages between the parties.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Businessman's Claim Against the Woman**:
   - The businessman's total damages are $5,000.
   - His recovery is reduced by his 70% negligence, so he can recover 30% of $5,000.
   - Calculation: \( 0.30 \times 5,000 = 1,500 \).
   - Therefore, the businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman.

2. **Woman's Counterclaim Against the Businessman**:
   - The woman's total damages are $1,000.
   - Her recovery is reduced by her 30% negligence, so she can recover 70% of $1,000.
   - Calculation: \( 0.70 \times 1,000 = 700 \).
   - Therefore, the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.

3. **No Set-Off**:
   - The statute explicitly states that there shall be no set-off of damages. Each party's recovery is independent of the other.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The amounts ($1,000 and $900) do not align with the calculations.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It ignores the comparative negligence reduction.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The amounts ($3,500 and $300) do not match the calculations.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The amounts ($800 and $0) do not align with the calculations.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. It ignores the comparative negligence reduction.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The amounts ($0 and $1,000) do not match the calculations.
- **Option G**: Correct. The businessman recovers $1,500, and the woman recovers $700, consistent with the calculations.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The amounts ($2,000 and $500) do not align with the calculations.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The amounts ($3,000 and $600) do not match the calculations.

### Conclusion:
The appropriate judgment is that the businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.
