Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about natural selection, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think this through step by step.

The question is asking: Which is the smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts? The options are A through J, each describing a different biological concept.

First, I remember that natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution. It's the process where traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in populations over time. But the question is about the smallest unit where this selection happens.

I think back to what I learned in biology class. Natural selection acts on the variation present in a population. But the unit is about what it acts on directly. I recall that individuals don't evolve; populations do. However, selection happens on individuals because their traits determine their survival and reproductive success.

Wait, but the options include various terms like genome, genetic variation, phenotype, etc. So I need to distinguish between these.

So, natural selection operates on the phenotype. Because it's the physical traits that are expressed, like height, color, etc., which affect an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. The genotype (the genetic makeup) is what determines the phenotype, but selection itself is based on the expressed traits.

But wait, some sources say that natural selection acts on individuals. Because each individual's phenotype determines whether they survive and pass on their genes. So the unit of selection is the individual.

Looking at the options again:

Option G is "an individual's phenotype." Option D is "an individual's genetic makeup." So the confusion is between phenotype and genotype.

I remember that the process goes like this: Individuals have different traits (phenotypes) due to their genetic makeup. The environment selects for certain phenotypes, which in turn affects the genetics of the population. So selection is on the phenotype, but the effect is on the genetic makeup of the population.

Wait, but the question is about the unit upon which selection directly acts. So it's the individual's phenotype because that's what's being selected in terms of survival and reproduction.

But other options might say the individual's genetic makeup. Hmm. No, because selection isn't directly on the genes but on the expressed traits.

So, if the question is about the smallest unit, the individual is the level, and their phenotype is what's being selected.

Looking again, the options are:

A: individual's genome (genetic info, so genotype)
D: individual's genetic makeup (same as A?)
G: individual's phenotype.

So, the answer should be either G or D.

Wait, but sometimes people argue that selection acts on the individual as a whole, but the traits are the phenotype. So the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, maybe it's the individual as the unit, but the options don't have that. The options are about what is acted upon.

Another point: natural selection acts on the phenotype, but the effect is on the genotype frequency in the population. So the target is the phenotype.

So I think the correct answer is G: an individual's phenotype.

The smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts is the individual's phenotype. Natural selection operates based on the expressed traits of an individual, which determine their survival and reproductive success. While genetic makeup influences the phenotype, selection itself is directly on the phenotype because it is the physical traits that interact with the environment. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G: an individual's phenotype.

Answer: G
