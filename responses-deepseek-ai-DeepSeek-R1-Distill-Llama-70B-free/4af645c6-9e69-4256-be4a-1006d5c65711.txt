Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says a chemist has a saturated solution of CaSO4 in 0.0100 M Na2SO4. The Ksp of CaSO4 is 2.4 × 10^-5. I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions in this solution. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with solubility products, the key is understanding how the ions come from the solute and the solution.

So, CaSO4 is a sparingly soluble salt in water. When it dissolves, it dissociates into Ca²+ and SO4^2- ions. The dissolution equation would be CaSO4(s) ⇌ Ca²+(aq) + SO4^2-(aq). The solubility product, Ksp, is the product of the concentrations of these ions, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. So Ksp = [Ca²+][SO4^2-].

But wait, the solution already has Na2SO4. Sodium sulfate is a soluble salt, right? So it will completely dissociate into 2 Na+ ions and one SO4^2- ion. The concentration of Na2SO4 is 0.0100 M, so the SO4^2- concentration from this source would be 0.0100 M. Because for every mole of Na2SO4, we get one mole of SO4^2-.

Since the solution is saturated with CaSO4, the small amount that does dissolve will contribute a little more SO4^2- and some Ca²+. But the Na2SO4 contributes the majority of the sulfate ions. So the total [SO4^2-] is 0.0100 M plus the 's' from CaSO4. But wait, since CaSO4 isn't very soluble, the 's' (which is the solubility, or [Ca²+]) will be small compared to 0.0100. So maybe I can approximate [SO4^2-] ≈ 0.0100 M. That should simplify the calculation.

So, the Ksp expression is Ksp = [Ca²+][SO4^2-]. We know Ksp is 2.4e-5, and [SO4^2-] is about 0.0100 M. Let me plug that in. So 2.4e-5 = [Ca²+] * 0.0100. Solving for [Ca²+] would be 2.4e-5 divided by 0.0100.

Let me calculate that. 2.4e-5 divided by 1e-2 is the same as 2.4e-3. So [Ca²+] is 2.4 × 10^-3 M. Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check if that's one of them. Let me look: option D is 5.0e-3, B is 2.0e-3, H is 3.0e-3. Oh wait, I thought I got 2.4e-3, but that's not an option. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should not make the approximation. Let me think again. Let's let the solubility of CaSO4 be 's'. So [Ca²+] is 's', and [SO4^2-] is 0.0100 + s. Then Ksp = s*(0.0100 + s) = 2.4e-5. Since s is going to be small compared to 0.01, s is on the order of 1e-3 perhaps, so 0.01 + s ≈ 0.01. But just to check if the approximation holds, let me proceed.

So, Ksp = s*(0.0100 + s) ≈ s*(0.0100) = 2.4e-5. So s = 2.4e-5 / 0.0100 = 2.4e-3 M. So 0.0024 M. But looking at the options, option B is 2.0e-3. Hmm, but 2.4e-3 isn't an option. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, wait—no, the options don't have B as 2.4e-3. Let me look again. The options are:

A: 2.4e-5

B: 2.0e-3

C:1.2e-2

D:5.0e-3

E:8.0e-5

F:7.5e-4

G:1.0e-3

H:3.0e-3

I:6.0e-4

J:4.8e-5

So I don't see 2.4e-3 as an option. Hmm. So my initial approach must be wrong, or maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I got the units wrong. Or maybe I forgot the stoichiometry. Let me think again. The dissolution equation is CaSO4(s) ⇌ Ca²+ (aq) + SO4²− (aq). So each mole gives one mole of each ion. So that part is correct.

Wait, but in the solution, the sulfate comes from both Na2SO4 and CaSO4. But perhaps in the solution, the concentration of sulfate is 0.01 plus s, where s is the solubility of CaSO4. So the Ksp is s*(0.01 + s) = 2.4e-5.

But since s is small, s <<0.01, so 0.01 +s ≈0.01. So s ≈ 2.4e-5 / 0.01 = 2.4e-3. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equation without the approximation. Let me write it: s(0.01 + s) = 2.4e-5.

Expanding, it becomes 0.01 s + s² = 2.4e-5.

This is a quadratic equation: s² + 0.01 s - 2.4e-5 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, s = [-0.01 ± sqrt( (0.01)^2 + 4*(1)*(2.4e-5) ) ] / 2.

Let me compute the discriminant. (0.01)^2 is 1e-4. 4 *1*2.4e-5 is 9.6e-5. So sqrt(1e-4 +9.6e-5) = sqrt(1.96e-4). sqrt(1.96e-4) is sqrt(1.96)*1e-2. sqrt(1.96) is about 1.4, so 1.4e-2. So s = [ -0.01 ± 0.014 ] / 2.

We take the positive root: ( -0.01 +0.014 ) /2 → (0.004)/2 = 0.002, which is 2e-3. So s=2.0e-3 M. Oh wait, that's option B.

Wait a second—so without the approximation, the value of s is 2.0e-3. But earlier when I used the approximation, I got 2.4e-3. So that must mean that the approximation isn't accurate enough, and the exact calculation gives 2e-3, which is an option.

I think I made a mistake earlier in my initial approximation. So when I set s(0.01 +s) = 2.4e-5, I should have considered that s is not negligible compared to 0.01. Because 2.4e-5 is 2.4e-5, while 0.01 is 1e-2. So 2.4e-5 is 0.024% of 0.01, which is very small. So s would be very small, but perhaps my initial assumption was correct, but the calculation without the approximation gave 2e-3, which does match option B.

Wait, but let's recalculate the quadratic solution again to be precise.

Compute discriminant: b² -4ac → (0.01)^2 +4 *1 *2.4e-5 → 0.0001 + 0.000096 = 0.000196.

sqrt(0.000196) = sqrt(1.96e-4) = 0.014 (since 0.014^2 = 0.000196).

So s = [-0.01 ±0.014]/2.

Taking the positive root: (0.004)/2 = 0.002 M → 2.0e-3. So that's correct.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is 2.0e-3, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. When I took the approximation, I got 2.4e-3, but the exact solution is 2.0e-3. Why is that?

Because when I neglected s in the denominator, I assumed s was negligible compared to 0.01, but in reality, s is about 2e-3, which is 20% of 0.01. Oh, because 0.01 is 0.0100, so 0.002 is 20% of that. So the approximation isn't valid here. Hence, the exact solution is lower than the approximate.

So the correct answer is 2.0e-3 M, which is option B.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the dissolution of CaSO₄ in solution can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaSO}_4(s) \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+}(aq) + \text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq)
\]

The solubility product expression is:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{SO}_4^{2-}]
\]

Given that the solution already contains 0.0100 M Na₂SO₄, which completely dissociates to provide 0.0100 M SO₄²⁻, the total sulfate ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{SO}_4^{2-}] = 0.0100 + s
\]

where \(s\) is the solubility of CaSO₄ (i.e., the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions). Substituting into the \(K_{sp}\) expression:

\[
K_{sp} = s(0.0100 + s)
\]

Expanding and rearranging gives the quadratic equation:

\[
s^2 + 0.0100s - 2.4 \times 10^{-5} = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \(a = 1\), \(b = 0.0100\), and \(c = -2.4 \times 10^{-5}\), we calculate:

\[
\text{Discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac = (0.0100)^2 - 4(1)(-2.4 \times 10^{-5}) = 0.0001 + 0.000096 = 0.000196
\]

\[
\sqrt{\text{Discriminant}} = \sqrt{0.000196} = 0.014
\]

Substituting back:

\[
s = \frac{-0.0100 \pm 0.014}{2}
\]

Taking the positive root (since concentration cannot be negative):

\[
s = \frac{-0.0100 + 0.014}{2} = \frac{0.004}{2} = 0.0020 \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions is \(2.0 \times 10^{-3}\) M. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**B: \(2.0 \times 10^{-3}\)**.
