Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: Let F equal k times r to the power of n, multiplied by the unit radial vector r̂. I need to evaluate two surface integrals over a sphere S of radius a centered at the origin. The first integral is the flux integral of F dot n̂ ds, and the second is the integral of F cross n̂ ds. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, wait, let me make sure I understand the notation. F is given as F = k r^n r̂. So F is a vector field that depends on the radial distance r from the origin. The r̂ is the unit vector pointing radially outward, so F is radial and its magnitude depends on r^n. So F is proportional to r^n in the radial direction.

The surface S is a sphere of radius a, centered at the origin. So we're integrating over the surface of this sphere.

The first integral is the flux of F through S, which is ∫∫_S F · n̂ ds. The second is the integral of F × n̂ over the same surface, which is a vector surface integral, but the way it's written, maybe it's the magnitude or perhaps just one component? Wait, no, the question specifies it as ∫∫_S F × n̂ ds. Wait, but cross product of two vectors is another vector. So integrating that over the surface would give a vector result. However, looking at the options, the second part is a number, like 0 or pi, so maybe it's the magnitude or perhaps the integral is zero because of symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let's tackle each integral one by one.

Starting with the flux integral: ∫∫_S F · n̂ ds. Since S is a sphere centered at the origin, the normal vector n̂ at every point on S is just the radial unit vector r̂. So n̂ = r̂. Therefore, the dot product F · n̂ becomes (k r^n r̂) · r̂. But r̂ · r̂ is 1, so F · n̂ = k r^n * 1 = k r^n.

Now, since we're on the sphere of radius a, every point on the surface has r = a. So F · n̂ = k a^n. So the integrand becomes k a^n, which is a constant over the surface.

The surface integral of a constant over a sphere of radius a. The surface area of a sphere is 4πa². So the integral is (k a^n) * (4πa²) = 4πk a^{n+2}.

Wait, that would be for the flux if the integrand is constant. So the first part of the answer would be 4πk a^{n+2}. Let me check the options. Looking through the options:

Option G: 4πk a^n, 0. No, because a^{n+2} isn't matching. Option B says 4πk a^{n+2}, 0. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are written as: "Option B: 4πk a^n+2, 0". Oh, maybe that's a typo and it's 4πk a^{n+2}, 0. Because if the first part is 4πk a^{n+2}, then that would match.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake? Because F = k r^n r̂, so F · n̂ is k r^n. On the sphere, r=a, so F · n̂ = k a^n. So the flux is ∫∫ F · n̂ ds = ∫∫ k a^n ds. Since ds is the area element on the sphere. The surface area is 4πa². So the integral would be k a^n * 4π a² = 4πk a^{n+2}.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have a^{n+2} as the first term. Let me check again. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The flux integral is ∫∫ F · n̂ ds. F = k r^n r̂, and n̂ is r̂, so F · n̂ = k r^n. On the sphere, r = a, so this becomes k a^n. So the integral is (k a^n) multiplied by the surface area of the sphere, which is 4πa². So 4π a² * k a^n = 4πk a^{n+2}.

Looking at the options, I don't see any option with 4πk a^{n+2} as the first term. Wait, option B says 4πk a^n+2, which I think is a^{n+2}, right? It's written as a^{n+2}. So option B's first part is 4πk a^{n+2}, and the second part is 0.

What about the second integral, the cross product integral: ∫∫_S F × n̂ ds. Hmm, cross product of F and n̂. Since F and n̂ are both in the r̂ direction, their cross product would be zero. Because the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. So F is k r^n r̂, and n̂ is r̂, so F × n̂ = (k r^n r̂) × r̂ = 0. So the integral of zero over the surface is zero. So the second integral is zero.

So the first integral is 4πk a^{n+2}, and the second is 0. Looking at the options, option B is 4πk a^{n+2}, 0. But wait, looking back, option B is written as "4πk a^n+2, 0". Oh, maybe that's a typo and it's a^{n+2}.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: 4πk a^n+2, 0. So that's 4πk multiplied by a^{n+2}, yes. So the first answer is 4πk a^{n+2}, and the second is 0.

So the correct option would be B.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when integrating, especially with vector areas, the cross product can be interpreted as a surface element. But in this case, the problem specifically says ∫∫ F × n̂ ds. So since F is along r̂, and n̂ is r̂, their cross product is zero everywhere on the sphere. So the integral is zero.

So the first integral is 4πk a^{n+2}, second is 0. So the correct option is B. But let me check the other options to make sure.

Option G: 4πk a^n, 0. Hmm, that would be if the first integral were k a^n multiplied by 4π a^2? Wait, no, 4π a^2 is for the surface area. Wait, no: if F · n̂ is k a^n, then the integral is k a^n * 4π a², which is 4πk a^{n+2}.

So the first part of the answer is 4πk a^{n+2}, second part is 0. So option B matches this.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B says "4πk a^n+2, 0". Oh, that's 4πk multiplied by a^{n+2}, yes.

So the correct answer is option B.

To solve the problem, we evaluate the two surface integrals for the vector field **F = k r^n r̂** over a sphere **S** of radius **a** centered at the origin.

### 1. Flux Integral: ∫∫_S **F · n̂** ds
- The normal vector **n̂** on the sphere is the radial unit vector **r̂**. Thus, **F · n̂** simplifies to **k r^n**.
- On the sphere, the radial distance **r = a**, so **F · n̂ = k a^n**.
- The surface integral becomes **∫∫_S k a^n ds**, where **ds** is the surface area element. The surface area of a sphere is **4πa²**.
- Therefore, the flux integral evaluates to:
  \[
  \int\int_S F \cdot n̂ \, ds = k a^n \cdot 4πa² = 4πk a^{n+2}.
  \]

### 2. Cross Product Integral: ∫∫_S **F × n̂** ds
- The vector field **F** is radial (**F = k r^n r̂**), and the normal vector **n̂** is also radial (**n̂ = r̂**).
- The cross product **F × n̂** simplifies to **(k r^n r̂) × r̂ = 0**, since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero.
- Thus, the integral of **F × n̂** over the sphere is zero:
  \[
  \int\int_S F \times n̂ \, ds = 0.
  \]

### Matching with the Options
- The first integral evaluates to **4πk a^{n+2}**, and the second integral evaluates to **0**.
- Comparing with the given options, the correct choice is **B: 4πk a^{n+2}, 0**.
