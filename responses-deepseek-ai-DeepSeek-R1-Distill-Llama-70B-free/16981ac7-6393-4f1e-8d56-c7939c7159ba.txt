Okay, so I'm looking at this question about 19th-century scientific theories on race. The question is asking which idea wasn't considered in these theories. The options are A through J, each listing a different characteristic or concept.

First, I need to understand what these 19th-century theories were like. I remember that during that time, especially with the rise of scientific racism, various physical traits were used to categorize races and often to justify discrimination or hierarchy. So they looked at visible features to classify people into different races and sometimes linked those features to other attributes like intelligence or capability.

Looking at the options, most of them are physical traits. Let's go through each one:

A: Eye color. I think eye color was considered because it's a noticeable trait. People might have categorized races based on eye color, like blue eyes in some groups, brown in others.

B: Hair texture. Definitely, hair texture was a big one. They talked about different types like curly, straight, wavy, etc., and associated them with different races.

C: Bone density. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. Bone density is a more internal factor, not as visible. I don't recall historical theories focusing on it much. They were more into visible traits.

D: Height. Yes, height was used. I think some theories suggested that certain races were taller or shorter, which might have been linked to other supposed characteristics.

E: Skin color. This is the most obvious one. Skin color was a primary factor in racial classification. It's visible and was used extensively.

F: Evolution. Wait, evolution as a concept was around in the 19th century, especially after Darwin. But how does it relate here? I think some theories used evolutionary ideas to explain race, like different environments leading to different traits.

G: Brain size. Oh yeah, I remember phrenology and craniometry. They measured skull sizes and brain sizes, believing that larger brains meant more intelligence, and thus certain races were superior.

H: Blood type. Blood type is something I'm not sure about. I know blood types were discovered later, maybe early 20th century. So perhaps 19th-century theories didn't consider blood type as a racial trait.

I: Genetics. Well, the term genetics came later, but the idea of heredity was around. They didn't have the modern understanding, but they used hereditary concepts in their theories.

J: Muscle mass. Muscle mass would have been considered, I think, because it relates to physical strength, which was part of the racial stereotypes. Some races were seen as more athletic or stronger.

Wait, so the question is which was NOT considered. So I'm looking for the one that 19th-century race theories didn't focus on.

Bone density (C) and blood type (H) are the two that stand out as less likely. Blood typeâ€”I think Karl Landsteiner discovered the ABO blood types in 1901, so that's early 20th century. So 19th-century theories wouldn't have included blood type as a racial trait. Similarly, bone density isn't something they'd measure much back then; they focused more on external traits.

So between C and H. Which one is the answer?

The question is about which idea was NOT considered. So if blood type wasn't known until the 1900s, then 19th-century theories didn't consider it. So H: blood type would be the correct answer.

But wait, the options are A to J, and the question is which was not considered. So the answer should be H.

The question asks which idea was not considered in 19th-century 'scientific' theories on race. These theories often focused on visible physical traits and used them to classify races into hierarchies. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Eye color**, **B: Hair texture**, **D: Height**, **E: Skin color**, **G: Brain size**, and **J: Muscle mass** were all commonly used in racial classification during this period. 
- **F: Evolution** was also relevant, as theories often invoked evolutionary ideas to explain racial differences. 
- **I: Genetics** was not a term used at the time, but hereditary concepts were part of the discussion. 

**C: Bone density** and **H: Blood type** are less likely to have been considered. Bone density is an internal trait and not something 19th-century theories focused on. Blood type, however, was discovered in the early 20th century (by Karl Landsteiner in 1901), so it would not have been part of 19th-century racial theories.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: Blood type**, as it was not known or considered during this period.

Answer: H
