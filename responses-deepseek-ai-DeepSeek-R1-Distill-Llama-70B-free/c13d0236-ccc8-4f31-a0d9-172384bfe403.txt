Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the amount of oxygen in a container. Hmm, let's see. The container's volume is 0.2 cubic meters. The conditions are 70 degrees Celsius and 25 bars. Atmospheric pressure is 1 bar, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays into it yet.

Wait, the question is asking for the amount of oxygen in kilograms. I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Right, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, the pressure given is 25 bars, and the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar. Oh, maybe I need to calculate the pressure relative to atmospheric? Like, convert it to absolute pressure. Oh right, because sometimes when dealing with gases, you have to consider whether the pressure is absolute or gauge. Since the container is holding oxygen, I think it's under pressure, so maybe it's absolute. Or wait, is 25 bars the absolute pressure? Because 1 bar is atmospheric, and 25 would be way higher than that. So perhaps the 25 bars is the absolute pressure. So I can proceed with that.

So I need to find the number of moles of oxygen, n, and then convert that to mass. Oxygen's molar mass is 32 grams per mole, right? Because O2 is 2*16=32 g/mol.

So the steps would be:

1. Convert temperature to Kelvin. 70°C is 70 + 273.15 = 343.15 K.

2. Use the ideal gas law to find n: n = PV/(RT)

What's the value of R? I think R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but sometimes it's in different units. Alternatively, since pressure is in bars, maybe another value of R would be more convenient. Let me think. Because 1 bar·L = 100 J (since 1 bar is ~100 kPa, and 1 L·kPa is 100 J). Wait, 1 bar is 10^5 Pa, and 1 Pa·m³ is 1 J. So 1 bar·m³ is 1e5 J. So R in units of bar·L/(mol·K) is 0.08314. Oh wait, but our volume is in m³. So 0.2 m³ is 200 liters. Hmm, maybe it's easier to work in liters and bar units.

Wait, let me think again. Let's get the units right. Let me use R = 0.08314 L·bar/(mol·K). Because that might be easier since our volume would then be in liters.

So, volume V is 0.2 m³. To convert to liters, since 1 m³ = 1000 liters, 0.2 m³ is 200 liters.

So now P is 25 bar, V is 200 L, T is 343.15 K.

Then n = (25 bar * 200 L) / (0.08314 L·bar/(mol·K) * 343.15 K )

Calculate that. Let me compute the denominator first: 0.08314 * 343.15 ≈ let's see, 0.083 * 343 is about 28.5. So 25 * 200 is 5000. 5000 / 28.5 ≈ approximately 175.44 moles.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Denominator: 0.08314 * 343.15. Let me compute that.

343.15 * 0.08314. Let's do 343 * 0.08314.

0.08314 * 300 = 24.942, 0.08314 *43= approx 3.575. So total around 24.942 + 3.575 = 28.517.

So denominator is approximately 28.517.

So n = (25 * 200) / 28.517 = 5000 / 28.517 ≈ 175.4 moles.

Wait, let me do a more precise calculation.

5000 divided by 28.517. Let me compute 28.517 * 175 = 28.517 * 170 = 4847.89 and 28.517 *5=142.585. So total 4847.89+142.585=4990.475. So 28.517 * 175= ~4990.475, which is less than 5000.

The difference is 5000 - 4990.475=9.525. So 9.525 /28.517 is approximately 0.334. So n≈175.334 mol.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach. 5000 / 28.517.

But perhaps I should write it as 5000 ÷ 28.517 ≈ 5000 ÷28.5 ≈ 175.438. Let's say approximately 175.44 moles.

Now, each mole of O2 is 32 grams, so 175.44 mol * 32 g/mol = 5614.08 grams, which is 5.614 kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:4.234 kg

B:4.8354 kg

C:5.234 kg

D:5.8354 kg

E:6.234 kg

F:7.8354 kg

G:3.8354 kg

H:5.534 kg

I:6.8354 kg

J:7.134 kg

Hmm, my approximate calculation gave me about 5.614 kg, which isn't exactly any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the pressure given is gauge pressure, not absolute. Oh wait, the container's pressure is 25 bar, which is above atmospheric. So absolute pressure would be 25 bar plus 1 bar? Because sometimes, pressure is given as gauge (like relative to atmospheric). But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the problem says the container holds oxygen at 25 bars. So I think that's the absolute pressure. Because atmospheric pressure is 1 bar, but the container is pressurized, so 25 bar would be absolute. So gauge would be 24 bar, but perhaps the 25 bar is absolute. So I think the initial calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the oxygen is stored as a liquid, but no, 70 degrees Celsius is above the boiling point of oxygen, which is around -183°C, so it's definitely a gas.

Wait, maybe ideal gas law isn't accurate enough, and I should use the van der Waals equation. But that's more complicated, and I don't think the problem expects that.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the units when using R. Let me try using R in J/(mol·K) instead. So R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

So V is 0.2 m³, which is 0.2 m³ = 200 L, but in m³, it's 0.2.

Wait, no, wait, in SI units, the volume is in m³, pressure in Pascals. So let me try that approach.

So P is 25 bar. 1 bar is 1e5 Pascals, so 25 bar = 25e5 Pa.

V is 0.2 m³.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T is 343.15 K.

So n = PV/(RT) = (25e5 Pa * 0.2 m³) / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 343.15 K )

Compute numerator: 25e5 * 0.2 = 5e5 * 0.2? Wait, 25e5 is 2,500,000. 2,500,000 * 0.2 = 500,000.

Denominator: 8.314 * 343.15. Let's calculate that.

8.314 * 343 = Let's see: 8 *343 = 2744, 0.314*343≈107.722. So total ≈2744 +107.722=2851.722.

So denominator is approximately 2851.722 J/mol.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 8.314 * 343.15 is:

Let me compute 8 *343.15 = 2745.2, 0.314 *343.15 ≈ 107.7227. So total is 2745.2 + 107.7227 = 2852.923.

So denominator is about 2852.923 J/mol.

So n = 500000 / 2852.923 ≈ let's compute that.

500000 ÷ 2852.923. Let me see, 2852.923 × 175 = ?

Well, 2853 *175 = ?

2853 * 100 = 285300

2853 *70 = 199,710

2853 *5=14,265

So 285300 + 199710 = 485,010 +14,265=499,275. So 175 moles would give 499,275. Our numerator is 500,000. So the difference is 725.

725 / 2852.923 ≈ 0.254, so n≈175.254 mol.

So n≈175.25 mol.

Now, the molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol, so mass is 175.25 *32 = let's compute.

175 *32=5600, 0.25*32=8, so total 5608 grams, which is 5.608 kg.

Hmm, that's more precise. So approx 5.608 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:5.8354 kg, H:5.534 kg, or option B is 4.83 kg.

Wait, none of the options exactly match 5.608 kg. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of n.

Let me compute denominator R*T more accurately.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K)

T=343.15 K.

8.314 *343.15 = ?

Let me compute 8 *343.15 = 2745.2.

0.314 *343.15 = 0.3*343.15=102.945; 0.014*343.15≈4.8041. So 102.945 +4.8041=107.749.

So total R*T=2745.2 +107.749=2852.949 J/mol.

n = (25e5 Pa * 0.2 m³) / (2852.949 J/mol)

Numerator is 25e5 * 0.2 = 5e5 J.

So n=5e5 /2852.949 ≈ 175.25 mol.

Mass is 175.25 *32=5608 grams=5.608 kg.

Wait, but none of the options have 5.608. Let me look again.

Options are:

A:4.234 kg

B:4.8354 kg

C:5.234 kg

D:5.8354 kg

E:6.234 kg

F:7.8354 kg

G:3.8354 kg

H:5.534 kg

I:6.8354 kg

J:7.134 kg

Hmm, 5.608 is closest to option H:5.534 kg or D:5.8354. Wait, 5.608 is between 5.534 and 5.8354. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value of R. Let me check R in different units.

Wait, another approach: using R as 8.314 J/(mol·K) is correct. So perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: is the pressure in bar absolute or gauge? Because if the container is at 25 bar gauge, the absolute pressure is 26 bar. So perhaps I should recalculate with P=26 bar.

Let me try that.

If P=26 bar, then n= (26e5 Pa * 0.2 m³) / (8.314 *343.15 )

Numerator: 26e5 *0.2=5.2e5 J.

Denominator same as before: 2852.949 J/mol.

n=520000 /2852.949 ≈ 520000/2853 ≈ 182.23 mol.

Mass is 182.23 *32=5823.36 grams=5.823 kg. That's approximately 5.823 kg, which is close to option D:5.8354 kg.

Hmm, that's very close. But why would the pressure be 26 bar? The question says atmospheric pressure is 1 bar, but I'm not sure if the 25 bar given is absolute or gauge. If the problem states that the container holds 25 bars, it's more likely absolute than gauge. But maybe in some contexts, it's gauge.

Wait, the problem says the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar. So perhaps the pressure inside is 25 bar absolute. Because if it's 25 bar gauge, then absolute would be 26 bar.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether it's gauge or absolute. Hmm. Usually, when pressure is given without specifying, it's absolute. But sometimes, in engineering contexts, it's gauge. So this is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, if the pressure is 25 bar absolute, then n=175.25 mol, mass=5.608 kg.

Looking at the options, 5.608 is not present. But if it's 25 bar gauge, then absolute is 26 bar, leading to n=182.23, mass≈5.823 kg, which is close to option D:5.8354 kg.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a different R value. Let me try using R=8.3145 J/(mol·K).

Another thought: perhaps I should use the compressibility factor, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me re-calculate n using R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

n = (25e5 Pa * 0.2 m³) / (8.314 *343.15 )

Compute numerator: 25e5 *0.2 =5e5 J.

Denominator: 8.314*343.15=2852.949.

n=5e5 /2852.949≈175.25 mol.

Mass=175.25 *32=5.608 kg.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach uses pressure as absolute, and somehow I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question expects to convert pressure to atmospheres. Because sometimes R is given in terms of atm·L/(mol·K). Let me try that.

1 bar is approximately 0.98692 atm. So 25 bar is 25 *0.98692 ≈24.673 atm.

So P=24.673 atm.

Volume V is 0.2 m³ = 200 L.

R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T=343.15 K.

So n = (24.673 atm *200 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) *343.15 K )

Compute numerator: 24.673 *200=4924.6.

Denominator: 0.0821 *343.15≈28.16.

n=4924.6 /28.16≈174.8 mol.

Mass=174.8 *32=5.5936 kg, which is about 5.594 kg. Still not matching the options.

Wait, maybe using a more precise value for R. Let me use R=0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K).

n = (24.673 *200) / (0.082057 *343.15 )

Denominator: 0.082057 *343.15 ≈ let's compute.

0.082057 *300 =24.6171

0.082057 *43.15≈ 3.541.

So total denominator≈24.6171 +3.541=28.158.

Numerator:24.673 *200=4924.6.

n=4924.6 /28.158 ≈ 174.9 mol.

Mass=174.9 *32=5.5968 kg≈5.597 kg.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the initial pressure. If the container is at 25 bar absolute, but the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar, perhaps the pressure difference is 24 bar. But that doesn't make sense in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the ideal gas law in terms of kg, using m = (P M)/(R_T), where R_T is the specific gas constant for oxygen.

Wait, specific gas constant R is R (universal gas constant) divided by molar mass.

R_specific = R/M.

For oxygen, M=32 g/mol=0.032 kg/mol.

R_specific = 8.314 /0.032 ≈259.81 J/(kg·K).

So the ideal gas equation can be written as PV = m R_specific T.

So m = (P V) / (R_specific T).

Let's try that.

P=25 bar =25e5 Pa.

V=0.2 m³.

R_specific=259.81 J/(kg·K).

T=343.15 K.

So m = (25e5 * 0.2) / (259.81 *343.15 )

Compute numerator:25e5 *0.2=5e5.

Denominator:259.81 *343.15 ≈ let's compute.

259.81 *300 =77,943.

259.81 *43.15≈ let's compute 259.81 *40=10,392.4; 259.81 *3.15≈818.00. So total ≈10,392.4 +818=11,210.4.

Total denominator≈77,943 +11,210.4=89,153.4.

So m=5e5 /89153.4 ≈5.61 kg.

Again, same as before. So 5.61 kg, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option B is 4.8354 kg, which is lower than my calculation. Option H is 5.534 kg, which is close to 5.5 kg. So perhaps I made a mistake in the gas constant.

Wait, another thought: the gas constant R for O2 is 259.8 J/(kg·K). Let me verify that.

Yes
