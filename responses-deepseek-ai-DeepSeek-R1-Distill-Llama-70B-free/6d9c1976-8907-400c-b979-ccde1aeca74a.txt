Question:

Marx (and the classical school) held that a commodity's value is determined by the amount of homogenous labor enbodied in the commodity. How does he reconcile thiswith the varied skills and natural abilities of people?

Options:

A: Marx differentiates between skilled and unskilled labor by the duration of labor, not by the type or quality of the work.
B: Marx computes the value of skilled labor from training costs and measures it in terms of units of unskilled labor. He averages differences in natural abilities into the term 'socially necessary labor'.
C: Marx equalizes the value of all commodities by the average amount of labor, without considering individual skill differences.
D: Marx ignores the varied skills and natural abilities of people.
E: Marx believes that the value of a commodity is determined solely by the skill level of the labor.
F: Marx suggests that natural abilities are irrelevant, as all labor is inherently equal in the creation of value.
G: Marx treats the value of labor as a reflection of the social status of the laborer, rather than the labor itself.
H: Marx uses only the most skilled labor as a benchmark for determining the value of a commodity.
I: Marx attributes a fixed value to each type of labor regardless of skill level or natural ability.
J: Marx proposes that the market adjusts the value of commodities according to the rarity of the skills required to produce them.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Marx's theory of value. I remember that Marx is part of the classical school, which says that the value of a commodity is determined by the amount of labor embodied in it. But the question is about how he handles the differences in skills and natural abilities among workers.

Hmm, I think Marx must have a way to account for varying skills because not all labor is the same. Like, a skilled worker might produce more value than an unskilled one. But wait, how does that fit into the labor theory of value?

I recall that Marx talked about "socially necessary labor time." Oh right, that's the average time needed to produce a commodity under normal conditions. But that's more about efficiency, not skills. So how does he handle different skill levels?

Maybe Marx considers skilled labor as a multiple of unskilled labor. Like, an hour of skilled labor might count as more than an hour of unskilled. But where does that come from? Perhaps the cost of training or education. If a worker spent time learning a skill, that time translates into value.

So the idea is that skilled labor's value is calculated based on the time it took to acquire that skill, plus the labor time spent producing the commodity. So skilled labor is a form of stored labor, maybe. Therefore, Marx might convert skilled labor into units of unskilled labor by considering the training costs and then average out natural abilities under the term 'socially necessary labor.'

Looking at the options, option B says that Marx computes the value of skilled labor from training costs and averages differences in natural abilities into 'socially necessary labor.' That sounds right because it explains how he converts skilled labor into a standard unit.

Wait, let me check other options. Option A says he differentiates by duration, not type or quality. That doesn't seem right because it doesn't explain how skill is accounted for. Option C says he averages without considering skill, which doesn't fit. Option D says he ignores skills, which I don't think is correct. Option E focuses solely on skill, which isn't the case. Option F says all labor is equal, which contradicts because he must adjust for skills. Option G is about social status, which isn't related here. Option H uses the most skilled as a benchmark, not sure. Option I gives fixed values regardless of skill, which doesn't explain the differentiation. Option J talks about market adjusting based on skill rarity, which sounds more like supply and demand, not Marx's approach.

So, I think the correct answer is B because it directly addresses how Marx accounts for skills through training costs and averages natural abilities into socially necessary labor.

The correct answer is B. Marx addresses the variation in skills and natural abilities by considering skilled labor as a multiple of unskilled labor, calculated through the costs of training and education. He incorporates these differences into the concept of 'socially necessary labor,' ensuring that the value of commodities reflects an average of the labor required under typical conditions.

Answer: B
