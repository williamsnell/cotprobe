Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about what to do first when a cardiac arrest is confirmed. Hmm, I remember from my first aid training that there's a specific sequence of steps. Let me think through this.

The question is asking about the very first action. The options are A through J. I think the first thing you're supposed to do is call for help. Like, you can't do everything by yourself, right? So you need to get more people or emergency services involved.

Looking at the options, option A says to ensure the emergency team or services are called. That makes sense. Because even if you start CPR, someone else needs to call 911 or get the AED. I think in some protocols, if you're alone, you do 30 compressions first, then call. But wait, no, I think the first step after confirming cardiac arrest is to call for help.

Wait, no, wait. If you're in a public place, maybe you should call first. Or is it different if you're in a hospital setting versus outside? Hmm, the question doesn't specify the setting, so I guess it's a general situation.

Also, I remember the old steps were A-B-C, airway, breathing, circulation. But now it's C-A-B, starting with compressions. But that's after calling for help. So first, you call, then start CPR.

So in this case, the first action is to call the emergency services. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but what if you're in a hospital and the emergency team is already around? But the question says "following confirmation of cardiac arrest," so regardless, you'd need to alert others. So yeah, A is the correct first step.

Other options: B is using a defibrillator, which comes after. C is 30 compressions, which would be after calling. J is rescue breaths, which might be part of CPR but after starting compressions.

So the answer must be A.

The first action following confirmation of cardiac arrest is to ensure the emergency team or services are called. This step is crucial to summon help and resources, such as an automated external defibrillator (AED), which are essential for effective resuscitation. While actions like chest compressions and rescue breaths are critical, they follow the initial call for emergency assistance. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A

Answer: A
