Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about finding out what quantity of oxygen gas (O2) has nearly the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water (H2O). Hmm, right, I remember something about moles and Avogadro's number from my studies.

Wait, so the key here is that the number of molecules should be the same for both substances. That means the moles of O2 should equal the moles of H2O. Because, you know, one mole of any substance has Avogadro's number of molecules, right? So if they have the same number of moles, they have the same number of molecules.

First, I need to calculate the moles of H2O in 36.0 grams. To do that, I should find the molar mass of H2O. Let's see, hydrogen is about 1.008 g/mol each, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. So H2O would be 2*(1.008) + 16.00. Let me add that up: 2.016 + 16.00 is 18.016 g/mol. So the molar mass is approximately 18.016 g/mol.

Now, moles of H2O = mass / molar mass. So that's 36.0 grams divided by 18.016 g/mol. Let me do that division. 36 divided by 18 is 2. So 36.0 / 18.016 is a bit more than 2, perhaps around 2.00 moles. Wait, let me check with the exact calculation. 36 ÷ 18.016... 18 times 2 is 36, so 36/18.016 is 2. So approximately 2.00 moles of H2O.

Since the number of molecules is the same, O2 must also have 2.00 moles. Now, I need to find the mass of O2 that corresponds to 2.00 moles.

The molar mass of O2 is 32.00 g/mol because each O atom is 16.00 g/mol, and there are two in O2. So, 2 moles multiplied by 32.00 g/mol would be 64 grams. Wait, is that right? 2 * 32 is 64, yeah.

Looking at the options, option H is 64.0 grams. So that should be the answer.

Wait a minute, let me double-check. So 36 grams H2O is 2 moles. Then 2 moles of O2 is 64 grams. Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the quantity of oxygen gas (O₂) that contains the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water (H₂O), we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the molar mass of H₂O**:  
   - Hydrogen (H) has a molar mass of 1.008 g/mol, and oxygen (O) has a molar mass of 16.00 g/mol.  
   - Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1.008) + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.

2. **Determine the moles of H₂O**:  
   - Moles of H₂O = mass / molar mass = 36.0 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 2.00 moles.

3. **Since the number of molecules is the same, O₂ must also have 2.00 moles.**

4. **Calculate the mass of O₂**:  
   - Molar mass of O₂ = 2(16.00 g/mol) = 32.00 g/mol.  
   - Mass of O₂ = moles × molar mass = 2.00 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 64.0 g.

Thus, the quantity of O₂ that contains the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of H₂O is **64.0 grams**.

The correct answer is **H**.
