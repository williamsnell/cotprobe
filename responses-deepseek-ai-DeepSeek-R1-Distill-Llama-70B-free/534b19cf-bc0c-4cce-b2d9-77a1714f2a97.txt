Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a 12-ounce soft drink has 41 grams of sugar, and that's 14% of the normal daily allowance for sugar. They're asking approximately how many grams of sugar are recommended in the normal diet. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, alright. So the key here is that 41 grams represent 14% of the daily allowance. I need to find out what 100% of the allowance is.

Wait, so if 14% equals 41 grams, then 100% would be how much? I think I can set this up as a proportion or maybe use algebra.

Let me think in terms of equations. Let me denote the total daily allowance as X grams. So 14% of X is 41 grams. So mathematically, that would be 0.14 * X = 41.

Yes, that makes sense. So to find X, I need to divide both sides by 0.14. So X = 41 / 0.14.

Let me calculate that. 41 divided by 0.14. Hmm, I'm not a calculator, so I'll try to do this manually.

Wait, 0.14 times what gives 41. Let me think. 0.14 is the same as 14/100. So 41 divided by 0.14 is the same as 41 multiplied by (100/14).

So 41 * (100/14) = (41 * 100) / 14. Let's compute 41 * 100 first, which is 4100. Then divide by 14.

Dividing 4100 by 14... Let's see, 14 times 292 is 4088 because 14*290=4060, and 14*2=28, so 4060+28=4088. Subtracting that from 4100 gives 12 left. So 12 divided by 14 is approximately 0.857. So total is approximately 292.857 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 292.857. Let me check the options again. Option J is 293. So that's probably the right answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check my math to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another way to compute 41 divided by 0.14. Let me think in terms of decimals. 0.14 is 14 hundredths. So 41 divided by 0.14.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 4100 divided by 14, which is what I did before. Yes, same result.

So 4100 รท 14 = 292.857... which is approximately 293 grams. So the daily allowance is about 293 grams of sugar.

Looking back at the options, option J is 293. So that should be the correct answer.

The problem states that 41 grams of sugar is 14% of the daily allowance. To find the total allowance (X), we use the equation:

\[
0.14 \times X = 41
\]

Solving for X:

\[
X = \frac{41}{0.14} = \frac{41 \times 100}{14} = \frac{4100}{14} \approx 292.86
\]

Approximating, we get 293 grams. Among the options, J matches this value.

Answer: J
