Okay, so I have this psychology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about an employee expecting greater consistency in his boss's behavior than is actually there. So, the employee thinks the boss behaves more consistently than he really does. The question is asking which psychological concept explains this expectation.

The options are A through I, each corresponding to a different theory or bias. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these terms means.

Let me start by going through each option one by one.

Option A: Cognitive dissonance theory. I remember this has to do with the discomfort people feel when their beliefs or actions conflict. They try to reduce this discomfort by changing their behavior or attitudes. But does that relate to expecting consistency? Maybe not directly. I think it's more about internal conflict resolution.

Option B: Self-serving bias. This is when people attribute their successes to their own abilities and their failures to external factors. Like when you do well on a test and think you're smart, but when you do poorly, you blame the questions. Doesn't seem to fit here because it's about how people perceive their own outcomes, not others' consistency.

Option C: Self-verification theory. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think it's about how people seek information that confirms their self-concept. So if someone sees themselves as smart, they look for situations that make them feel smart. But how does this apply to the boss's behavior? Maybe if the employee has a certain image of the boss, they might seek to confirm that image, expecting consistency.

Option D: Social comparison theory. This is about how we evaluate ourselves by comparing to others. Like checking if you're doing better or worse than someone else. Not sure how that ties into expecting consistency in another's behavior. Maybe not the right fit.

Option E: Fundamental attribution bias. Oh yeah, this is when people overestimate the role of personality and underestimate situational factors in shaping behavior. For example, thinking someone is late because they're irresponsible, not because of traffic. So if an employee expects consistency, maybe they're attributing the boss's behavior to their character rather than varying circumstances, leading them to expect more consistent behavior than there is. That sounds plausible.

Option F: Actor-observer bias. This is when people explain their own behavior based on the situation but explain others' behavior based on their character. Like, if I'm late, it's because of traffic (situation), but if you're late, you're lazy (disposition). So this could relate, but I'm not sure it's the best fit for expecting consistency. It's more about how we attribute causes differently for ourselves vs others.

Option G: Hindsight bias. That's when, after an event, people think they would have predicted it. Like saying "I knew that would happen" after it did. Doesn't seem directly related to expecting consistency in behavior.

Option H: Overjustification hypothesis. This is about how external rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation. For example, paying someone to do a task they already enjoy might make them less interested in it. Not relevant here.

Option I: Self-perception theory. This suggests that people infer their own attitudes and emotions by observing their behavior. Like, if I see myself acting happy, I think I'm happy. Not directly about others' behavior consistency.

So, the main contenders seem to be options C, E, and maybe F.

The question is about expecting greater consistency than is warranted. So the employee is assuming the boss behaves consistently when perhaps the boss's behavior is more variable.

Fundamental attribution bias (E) makes people think others' behavior is due to their stable traits. So if the boss sometimes is nice and sometimes not, the employee might think the boss is a consistently nice person, not considering that situational factors (like stress) might cause variability. Wait, but the employee is expecting more consistency than there is. So perhaps the employee is attributing the boss's behavior to his character, thus expecting consistent behavior. For example, if the boss is sometimes harsh and sometimes lenient, the employee might think, "Oh, he's just having a bad day," but overall expects the boss to be consistently a certain way.

Alternatively, self-verification theory (C) is about how people seek to confirm their self-image. But in this case, it's about the employee's expectations of the boss, not the boss's own self-image. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, wait. Another angle: people tend to see others as more consistent than they are. There's a concept called the "consistency bias" or perhaps related to how we perceive others as having more consistent personalities than they do.

But looking back at the options, fundamental attribution bias is when you attribute others' behavior to their character rather than situations. So when the boss acts inconsistently, the employee (due to FAB) might not notice the inconsistency and instead thinks the boss has a consistent personality, thus expecting more consistency than exists.

Alternatively, another concept I recall is that people overestimate the consistency of others' behavior. I think this might be part of the fundamental attribution bias or perhaps another bias. But I'm trying to match it to the given options.

Wait, the question is about expecting consistency when it's not there. So the employee's expectation is that the boss is consistent, but the reality is more variable. So why does the employee hold that expectation?

One possibility is that the employee is using the fundamental attribution bias. They see the boss's behavior as reflecting his underlying traits, so they expect consistency because they think the boss's behavior is determined by his personality.

Alternatively, another possibility is the halo effect, but that's not one of the options here.

Wait, maybe it's the "overattribution" aspect of FAB. For example, if the boss sometimes yells and sometimes is calm, the employee might think the boss has a consistent personality (like being generally angry), not considering that external factors (like having a bad day) are influencing it.

So the employee expects consistent behavior because they attribute the boss's actions to his character, not situations. Hence, the expectation is due to the fundamental attribution bias.

Wait, but another angle is the "illusory consistency" or "implicit personality theory," which refers to the tendency to see others as more consistent than they are. But I'm not sure if that's covered by any of the options here.

Looking back, the options are E: fundamental attribution bias, which I think is the best fit. Because FAB explains why people perceive others as having consistent traits, leading to the expectation of consistent behavior.

So the answer should be E.

The question involves an employee expecting greater consistency in their boss's behavior than is actually present. The task is to identify which psychological concept best explains this expectation. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Option A: Cognitive dissonance theory**  
  This theory deals with the discomfort people feel when their beliefs or actions conflict, leading to attempts to reduce this discomfort. However, it does not directly explain the expectation of consistency in others' behavior.

- **Option B: Self-serving bias**  
  This bias involves attributing one's successes to internal factors and failures to external factors. It pertains to how people perceive their own outcomes, not others' consistency.

- **Option C: Self-verification theory**  
  This theory suggests that people seek information that confirms their self-concept. While it could apply if the employee has a preconceived image of the boss, it is less directly relevant to the expectation of consistency in the boss's behavior.

- **Option D: Social comparison theory**  
  This theory explains how people evaluate themselves by comparing to others. It does not address the expectation of consistency in another's behavior.

- **Option E: Fundamental attribution bias**  
  This bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate situational factors in shaping behavior. It explains why the employee might expect the boss's behavior to be consistent, attributing it to the boss's character rather than external circumstances. This is the most plausible explanation.

- **Option F: Actor-observer bias**  
  This bias involves explaining one's own behavior situationally and others' behavior dispositionally. While related, it does not specifically address the expectation of consistency.

- **Option G: Hindsight bias**  
  This bias involves believing, after an event, that one would have predicted it. It is unrelated to expectations of consistency.

- **Option H: Overjustification hypothesis**  
  This hypothesis concerns how external rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation. It is irrelevant to the question.

- **Option I: Self-perception theory**  
  This theory suggests that people infer their attitudes and emotions from their behavior. It does not pertain to expectations about others' behavior.

The best explanation is **fundamental attribution bias (E)**, as it accounts for the employee's expectation of consistency by attributing the boss's behavior to stable traits rather than situational factors.

Answer: E
