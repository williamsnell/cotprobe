Okay, so I have this economics question here about aggregate demand and the marginal propensity to consume. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there's $100 of new autonomous private investment added to the economy. And the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.90. I need to find out by how much the aggregate demand shifts to the right. Oh right, aggregate demand shifts because of changes in consumption and investment.

Wait, I remember something about the multiplier effect here. The multiplier effect is when an initial change in spending leads to a larger change in overall economic output. The formula for the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 minus MPC), right? So if MPC is 0.9, the denominator would be 1 - 0.9, which is 0.1. So the multiplier is 1 / 0.1, which equals 10.

But wait, the initial change here is investment, not consumption. Does that matter? I think all autonomous spending changes have a multiplied effect. So whether it's investment or consumption, the multiplier applies. So the initial $100 investment would lead to a multiplied increase in aggregate demand.

So the total change should be the initial investment multiplied by the multiplier. That's 100 * 10, which equals $1,000. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything.

Wait, the question is about the shift in aggregate demand. Aggregate demand includes consumption and investment. So when investment increases by $100, that directly adds to AD. Then, the induced consumption comes into play because of the MPC. So the total shift is the initial investment plus the additional consumption.

Alternatively, the initial investment causes increased income, which leads to more consumption. So the total effect is the multiplier times the initial change, which is 100 * 10 = 1000. So the aggregate demand shifts right by $1,000.

Looking at the options, option E is $1,000. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the question might be about the change in GDP, which would be the same as the change in aggregate demand in this context. So I think I'm right. The multiplier applies, so it's 10 times the initial investment.

The question involves determining how much aggregate demand shifts to the right when $100 of new autonomous private investment is added to an economy with a marginal propensity to consume (MPC) of 0.90. 

To solve this, we use the multiplier effect formula: 

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}}
\]

Given that the MPC is 0.90, the multiplier becomes:

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.90} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10
\]

The total change in aggregate demand is the initial investment ($100) multiplied by the multiplier:

\[
\text{Total Change in Aggregate Demand} = 100 \times 10 = \$1,000
\]

Thus, the aggregate demand shifts to the right by $1,000. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

E: $1,000
