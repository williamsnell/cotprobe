Okay, so I have this question about finding the variance of a random variable Z, which is the sum of X and Y. And the catch is that X and Y are not independent. Hmm, I remember that when variables are independent, their covariance is zero, but since they're not independent here, the covariance probably comes into play.

Wait, variance of a sum... I think the formula for Var(Z) when Z = X + Y is Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X,Y). Oh right, because variance doesn't just add directly unless they're independent. Because if they're independent, the covariance is zero, so Var(Z) becomes VarX + VarY. But here, they're dependent, so the covariance term is added twice.

Looking at the options. Let's go through them. Option A is VarX + VarY minus twice the expectation of the product of (X - E[X]) and (Y - E[Y]). Wait, but the covariance is exactly E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])], right? So option A is VarX + VarY - 2Cov(X,Y). That doesn't seem right because when variables are positively correlated, the variance of their sum should be larger than their individual variances. So subtracting covariance would make it smaller, which doesn't fit. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B is the absolute value of VarX minus VarY. That doesn't make sense for variance of a sum. Variance is about spread, not the difference between two variances.

Option C is VarX + VarY. That's the case when X and Y are independent, but since the question says they're not independent, this can't be right.

Option D is VarX + VarY + Cov(X,Y). Wait, no, the formula I remember includes twice the covariance. Oh wait, no, the formula is Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X,Y). So D is missing that factor of 2 in the covariance term, so D can't be correct.

Option E is the average of VarX and VarY. That doesn't sound right because adding two variables would generally increase the variance beyond the average.

Option F is VarX minus VarY plus 2E of the covariance term. That seems off because variance is a measure of spread, and subtracting variances doesn't make sense for a sum.

Option G is the product of the variances, which definitely isn't how variance works for sums.

Option H is VarX + VarY + 2E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y})]. Oh wait, that 2 times the covariance. Because E[(X - E[X})(Y - E[Y})] is exactly Cov(X,Y). So this would be VarX + VarY + 2Cov(X,Y), which matches what I was thinking earlier. So H looks correct.

Option I is similar to H but uses (X + E[X])... that seems wrong because the expectation terms should be subtracted, not added. So I is incorrect.

Option J is VarX + VarY - 2Cov(X,Y). Wait, that would be like when you have Z = X - Y, because then Var(Z) = VarX + VarY - 2Cov(X,Y). But in this question, Z is X + Y, so J can't be right.

So the correct answer should be H, which is option H.

To find the variance of the random variable \( Z = X + Y \) when \( X \) and \( Y \) are not independent, we use the formula for the variance of the sum of two random variables:

\[
\text{Var}(Z) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y) + 2\text{Cov}(X, Y)
\]

This is because the covariance term, \(\text{Cov}(X, Y)\), accounts for the dependence between \( X \) and \( Y \). If \( X \) and \( Y \) were independent, the covariance would be zero, and the formula would reduce to \(\text{Var}(Z) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)\). However, since the question specifies that \( X \) and \( Y \) are not independent, the covariance term must be included.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Subtracts \( 2\text{Cov}(X, Y) \), which would underestimate the variance for positively correlated variables. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Takes the absolute difference of variances, which is not relevant for the variance of a sum. Incorrect.
- **Option C**: Assumes independence (\(\text{Var}(Z) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)\)), but \( X \) and \( Y \) are dependent. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Adds \(\text{Cov}(X, Y)\) instead of \( 2\text{Cov}(X, Y)\). Missing the correct factor of 2. Incorrect.
- **Option E**: Averages the variances, which does not apply to the variance of a sum. Incorrect.
- **Option F**: Subtracts \(\text{Var}(Y)\), which is inconsistent with the formula for the variance of a sum. Incorrect.
- **Option G**: Multiplies the variances, which is not how variance works for sums. Incorrect.
- **Option H**: Matches the correct formula \(\text{Var}(Z) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y) + 2\text{Cov}(X, Y)\). Correct.
- **Option I**: Uses \((X + E[X])\) instead of \((X - E[X])\), which is incorrect. Incorrect.
- **Option J**: Subtracts \( 2\text{Cov}(X, Y)\), which applies to \( Z = X - Y \), not \( Z = X + Y \). Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{H}
\]
