Question:

Which of the following statements about proteolysis is correct?


Options:

A: Proteolysis does not involve enzymatic processes.
B: Proteolysis only occurs in animal cells.
C: All tissue proteins undergo catabolism at more or less the same rate.
D: The rate of tissue protein catabolism is more or less constant throughout the day.
E: Proteolysis can only occur in the presence of light.
F: Proteolysis is the process of protein synthesis, not breakdown.
G: All proteins are catabolised at the exact same time.
H: All proteins that are to be catabolised are tagged with the peptide ubiquitin.
I: Ubiquitin is only attached to proteins that are to be synthesized, not catabolised.
J: Lysosomal enzymes provide the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism.

Okay, so I have this question about proteolysis, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me go through it step by step.

Proteolysis, as I remember, refers to the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids. It's a process that's crucial for various cellular functions. Now, looking at the options:

Option A says proteolysis doesn't involve enzymes. That can't be right. I remember that enzymes, especially proteases, are key in breaking down proteins. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Only in animal cells. Wait, plants and other organisms also break down proteins, right? Like, cells in general, not just animals. So B is wrong.

Option C: All tissue proteins break down at the same rate. No, I think some proteins are more stable than others. For example, structural proteins might be broken down slower than enzymes, which have a faster turnover. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Rate is constant throughout the day. I think the rate varies based on factors like energy needs, hormones, etc. Like during fasting, protein breakdown increases. So D is wrong.

Option E: Needs light. Hmm, I don't recall light being a factor in proteolysis. Proteolysis happens in the dark too, like in cells all the time. So E is incorrect.

Option F: It's synthesis, not breakdown. Wait, no. Proteolysis is definitely the breakdown. F is wrong.

Option G: All proteins are broken down at the same time. That doesn't make sense. Some proteins are broken down while others are synthesized. Timing varies. So G is incorrect.

Option H: All to-be-catabolized proteins are tagged with ubiquitin. I think this is about the ubiquitin-proteasome system. So yes, proteins marked with ubiquitin are targeted for degradation. So H sounds correct.

Option I: Ubiquitin is for synthesis. No, it's the opposite. It tags proteins for breakdown. So I is wrong.

Option J: Only lysosomal enzymes do it. No, because the proteasome also breaks down proteins, and some might be processed in other ways. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H. Proteolysis involves the breakdown of proteins, and ubiquitin tagging is a key mechanism for marking proteins destined for catabolism, particularly through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the process or fail to account for the diversity and complexity of proteolysis.

Answer: H
