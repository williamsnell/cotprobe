Okay, so I have this question about osmotic work done by the kidneys. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question gives me some values, and I need to calculate the osmotic work. 

So, the problem states that the kidneys secrete 0.158 moles of Cl^- in a liter of urine. The concentration of Cl^- in plasma is 0.104 M, and in urine it's 0.158 M. The temperature is 37°C. I'm supposed to find the osmotic work done, and the options are from A to J, each with different cal values.

Wait, I remember that osmotic work is related to the transport of ions against their concentration gradient, which requires energy. The formula I think involves the concentration difference, the number of moles, and probably something with the gas constant and temperature.

Oh right, the osmotic work (W) can be calculated using the formula W = nRT ln(C2/C1), where n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and C2 and C1 are the concentrations after and before, respectively.

Wait, but wait. Since the concentration in urine is higher than in plasma, the kidney is excreting Cl^- into the urine. So the work done would be the energy needed to move it against the gradient. Hmm, but does that affect the formula? Or is it just the natural log of the ratio of the concentrations.

Wait, another thought: The osmotic work is the energy required to secrete the ions against the concentration gradient. So the formula is W = nRT ln(C_urine / C_plasma). Because the ions are moving from lower concentration (plasma) to higher (urine), so the work done is positive.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the formula. I think the formula is W = nRT ln(C2/C1), where C2 is the final concentration in the urine, and C1 is the initial in plasma. So that's correct.

Wait, but another point: the units. The gas constant R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but the answer options are in calories. Oh right, 1 cal is approximately 4.184 J. So I'll have to convert the units at the end.

So let me list the given data:

n = 0.158 moles (since it's 0.158 mol/L, and volume is 1 L, so n is 0.158 mol)
C_plasma = 0.104 M
C_urine = 0.158 M
T is 37°C, which is 310.15 K.
R = 8.314 J/mol·K

Plugging into the formula: W = nRT ln(C_urine/C_plasma)

Wait, but wait a second. Oh no, wait, does the formula use the ratio as final over initial? Because in the case of secretion, the ions are moving from plasma (lower conc) to urine (higher conc), so the ratio would be C2/C1 = 0.158/0.104.

Wait, but let me make sure. The formula for osmotic work is W = nRT ln(C2/C1), where C2 is the concentration in the urine (higher), C1 is plasma (lower). So the ratio is greater than 1, and the ln would be positive, so work is positive, which makes sense because the kidney is doing work to excrete against the gradient.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute the ratio: 0.158 / 0.104 = approximately 1.5192.

Then, ln(1.5192) ≈ let's see. Ln(1.6) is about 0.47, but 1.5192 is a bit less. Let me calculate it more accurately. I can use a calculator approach.

Wait, actually, ln(1.5192) is approximately 0.419.

Wait, let me think. I know that ln(1) = 0, ln(e)=1 (~2.718). Hmm, to calculate ln(1.5192) without a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that ln(1.5) is approximately 0.4055. 1.5192 is a bit higher than 1.5, so maybe around 0.417 or 0.418.

Let me proceed with an approximate value of 0.418 for ln(1.5192).

Now plug into the equation:

W = 0.158 mol * 8.314 J/mol·K * 310.15 K * 0.418

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate R*T: 8.314 * 310.15.

8 * 300 is 2400, but more accurately:

8.314 * 300 = 2494.2. 8.314 * 10.15 = let's see, 8.314 * 10 = 83.14, 8.314 * 0.15 = 1.2471. So 83.14 + 1.2471 = 84.3871.

So total R*T ≈ 2494.2 + 84.3871 ≈ 2578.5871 J/mol.

Wait, wait, no. R is 8.314 J/mol·K, and T is 310.15 K, so R*T is 8.314 * 310.15.

Let me compute 8 * 310 = 2480, 0.314 * 310 ≈ 97.34. So total R*T ≈ 2577.34 J/mol.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

8.314 * 310.15:

Let me compute 8 * 310.15 = 2481.2.

0.314 * 310.15 = let's calculate:

0.3 * 310.15 = 93.045.

0.014 * 310.15 = 4.3421.

So total 93.045 + 4.3421 = 97.3871.

So R*T = 2481.2 + 97.3871 = 2578.5871 J/mol.

Now, multiply by n and ln(C2/C1):

n is 0.158 mol.

So W = 0.158 * 2578.5871 * 0.418.

First, compute 0.158 * 2578.5871.

0.1 * 2578.5871 = 257.85871.

0.05 * 2578.5871 = 128.929355.

0.008 * 2578.5871 = 20.6286988.

Adding these: 257.85871 + 128.929355 = 386.788065. Plus 20.6287 is 407.41676 approx.

So 0.158 * 2578.5871 ≈ 407.41676 J.

Now multiply by 0.418.

407.41676 * 0.418.

Let's compute 400 * 0.418 = 167.2.

7.41676 * 0.418 ≈ 3.1 (since 7 * 0.4 is 2.8, and 0.41676 * 0.418 is about 0.174, so total 2.8 + 0.174 = ~2.974).

So total is approximately 167.2 + 3.1 = 170.3 J.

Wait, but more accurately:

Well, 407.41676 * 0.418.

Let me compute 407 * 0.4 = 162.8.

407 * 0.018 = approx 7.326.

So 162.8 + 7.326 = 170.126.

Then, the 0.41676 part: 0.41676 * 0.418 ≈ 0.174.

So total is approximately 170.126 + 0.174 = 170.3 J.

So W ≈ 170.3 J.

But wait, the options are in calories. So I need to convert J to cal.

1 cal = 4.184 J.

So 170.3 J / 4.184 J/cal ≈ 40.7 cal.

Wait, let me compute that.

170.3 / 4.184.

Hmm, 4.184 * 40 = 167.36.

So 40 calories would be 167.36 J.

170.3 - 167.36 = 2.94 J left.

2.94 / 4.184 ≈ 0.703 calories.

So total is approximately 40.703 cal.

Looking at the options, option J is 40.7 cal. That matches.

Wait, but let me recheck my calculations for any possible error.

Wait, let me recompute the ln(1.5192) correctly. Maybe I approximated it as 0.418, but perhaps it's more precise.

Let me compute ln(1.5192) more accurately.

I know that ln(1.5) is about 0.4055, ln(1.6) is about 0.4700.

The value 1.5192 is just a bit above 1.5. Let me use a calculator approach.

Compute using Taylor series or use a linear approximation between 1.5 and 1.6.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to note that 1.5192 is about 1.5 + 0.0192.

Compute ln(1.5 + x), where x=0.0192.

Using the expansion ln(a + x) ≈ ln(a) + x/(a) - (x^2)/(2 a^2) + ... 

So a = 1.5, x=0.0192.

ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

x/a = 0.0192/1.5 ≈ 0.0128.

x^2/(2 a^2) = (0.0192)^2 / (2*(1.5)^2) = (0.00036864) / (4.5) ≈ 0.0000819.

So ln(1.5192) ≈ 0.4055 + 0.0128 - 0.0000819 ≈ 0.4177.

So more accurately, it's about 0.4177, which is close to my initial approximation of 0.418. So that's correct.

Another point to check: Did I use the correct ratio in the logarithm? The formula is ln(C2/C1), which is correct because C2 is higher than C1, so the logarithm is positive, and work is done by the kidneys.

So with that, the calculation steps seem correct. So the work done is approximately 40.7 cal, which is option J.

But wait, let me double-check the initial formula. Another approach I've heard of is using the equation W = T (nF), where F is Faraday's constant, but I think that's for electrical work, not osmotic. Alternatively, another formula might involve the concentration gradient and volume, but I think the one I used is correct for osmotic pressure work.

Alternatively, some sources might use the formula W = nRT ln(V1/V2), but I think that's for when volumes change. No, in this case, it's about concentration, so the formula with the concentrations is appropriate.

Wait, another thought: The osmotic work done is the energy required to create the concentration gradient. So when the kidney excretes Cl^- into the urine, making the concentration higher than plasma, it's doing work against the gradient. The formula I used, W = nRT ln(C2/C1), should be correct.

So I think my calculation is correct, and the answer is option J:40.7 cal.

To calculate the osmotic work done by the kidneys in secreting 0.158 moles of Cl⁻ in a liter of urine at 37°C, we use the formula for osmotic work:

\[
W = nRT \ln\left(\frac{C_{\text{urine}}}{C_{\text{plasma}}}\right)
\]

### Given Data:
- **Number of moles (\(n\))**: \(0.158 \, \text{mol}\)
- **Concentration in plasma (\(C_{\text{plasma}}\))**: \(0.104 \, \text{M}\)
- **Concentration in urine (\(C_{\text{urine}}\))**: \(0.158 \, \text{M}\)
- **Temperature (\(T\))**: \(37^\circ \text{C} = 310.15 \, \text{K}\)
- **Gas constant (\(R\))**: \(8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}\)

### Step 1: Calculate the concentration ratio
\[
\frac{C_{\text{urine}}}{C_{\text{plasma}}} = \frac{0.158}{0.104} \approx 1.5192
\]

### Step 2: Compute the natural logarithm of the ratio
\[
\ln(1.5192) \approx 0.418
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \(RT\)
\[
RT = 8.314 \times 310.15 \approx 2578.59 \, \text{J/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \(nRT\)
\[
nRT = 0.158 \times 2578.59 \approx 407.42 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 5: Multiply by \(\ln(C_{\text{urine}}/C_{\text{plasma}})\)
\[
W = 407.42 \times 0.418 \approx 170.3 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 6: Convert energy from joules to calories
\[
1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J}, \quad W = \frac{170.3}{4.184} \approx 40.7 \, \text{cal}
\]

### Final Answer:
The osmotic work done by the kidneys is approximately **40.7 cal**, which corresponds to **option J**.
