Okay, so I've got this question about virtual memory systems that use pages. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, III are true. Let me think through each one.

Alright, statement I says the virtual address space can be larger than physical memory. I remember that virtual memory allows a system to use more memory than it physically has by using disk space as an extension. So when a program runs, it can access a larger address space than what's physically available. So I think statement I is true.

Statement II claims that programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution. Wait, no. Virtual memory systems use paging, which means that only parts of the program (like pages) need to be in main memory at any time. The rest can be on disk. So the entire program doesn't have to stay in memory; it can be swapped in and out as needed. So II is false.

Now statement III says pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Pages are usually fixed-size blocks, like 4KB or something, determined by the hardware or OS. They don't relate to the program's logic or structure, like functions or variables. So III is probably false. Semantic characteristics would be more about how the code is written, not how the memory is divided into pages.

So putting it together: I is true, II is false, III is false. So which options match that? Looking at the choices, option G says I only, which aligns with this. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is determined by evaluating each statement:

- **Statement I**: True. Virtual memory allows the virtual address space to exceed physical memory by using disk space as an extension.
- **Statement II**: False. Programs do not need to be fully resident in main memory; paging allows parts of the program to be swapped in and out.
- **Statement III**: False. Pages are fixed-size blocks and do not correspond to the program's semantic characteristics.

Only statement I is true, so the correct choice is **G: I only**.

Answer: G
