Question:

An owner of a pizza and Italian foods restaurant opens a new location on a street where another owner has a burger restaurant. It seems like business is slow for the pizza place owner and he eyes up his competitor, the burger man, as the reason. The pizza owner starts to make false statements about the burger restaurant and its inferior ingredients, which he says have been causing ptomaine poisoning in some of the customers. When burger joint owner loses customers and business income to pizza place owner, can he sue for conversion?

Options:

A: No, because conversion consists of appropriating another's real property.
B: No, because the burger owner failed to prove that the pizza owner's statements were false.
C: No, because there was no interference with his ownership or right of possession to his personal property.
D: No, because the pizza owner has the right to advertise his business as he sees fit.
E: No, because the burger owner did not suffer any physical harm or damage to his property.
F: Yes, conversion is an intentional tort and the pizza owner acted intentionally to convert and did convert part of the burger business.
G: Yes, because the pizza owner committed a tort of defamation, which is a form of conversion.
H: Yes, because the pizza owner's actions caused economic harm to the burger owner.
I: Yes, because the pizza owner violated the burger owner's right to a fair competition.
J: Yes, because the pizza owner interfered with his right of peaceful enjoyment and disrupted his business activities.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about conversion. Let me start by recalling what conversion is. From what I remember, conversion is a tort that involves the unauthorized interference with someone else's personal property, to the extent that the owner is deprived of their property. It's like when someone takes or destroys another person's property without permission, leading to the loss of use or value.

In this scenario, there's a pizza restaurant owner and a burger restaurant owner. The pizza place isn't doing well, so the owner starts making false statements about the burger place. He claims their ingredients are inferior and cause ptomaine poisoning. As a result, the burger place loses customers and income.

The question is whether the burger owner can sue the pizza owner for conversion. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should understand if the pizza owner's actions amount to conversion. Conversion typically applies to tangible personal property. So, for example, if someone takes your car or destroys your goods, that's conversion. But in this case, the pizza owner is making false statements that harm the burger restaurant's business. 

The burger owner lost customers and income, which relates to economic harm. But conversion is about interference with physical property, not economic interests. So I don't think conversion applies here because the pizza owner didn't interfere with the burger owner's physical property. Instead, he's harming their reputation and business through false statements.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because conversion involves real property. Wait, no, conversion is about personal property, not real. So A might be incorrect.

Option B says no because the burger owner didn't prove the statements were false. But the question states the statements are false, so B seems irrelevant to the issue of conversion.

Option C says no because there was no interference with ownership or possession of personal property. That makes sense because the burger owner's personal property (like the restaurant, equipment) wasn't interfered with physically.

Option D says no because of advertising rights. The pizza owner can advertise, but making false statements isn't just advertisingâ€”it's defamation. But does that relate to conversion? Probably not.

Option E says no because there's no physical harm or property damage. Conversion doesn't require physical damage, but it does require interference with personal property, which isn't the case here.

Option F says yes, considering conversion as an intentional tort affecting business. But conversion is specific to property, not just any business loss.

Options G to J discuss other torts like defamation and economic harm, which are relevant but not conversion.

So the correct answer should be C, because conversion requires interference with personal property, which didn't happen here. The pizza owner's actions might be defamation or tortious interference with business relations, but not conversion.

The correct answer is C. Conversion involves unauthorized interference with personal property, depriving the owner of its use or value. In this case, the pizza owner's false statements caused economic harm but did not interfere with the burger owner's physical property. Therefore, conversion does not apply.

Answer: C
