Question:

A rancher, being owner in fee simpleconveyed the property by warranty deed to a woman. The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman in the amount of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee will probably

Options:

A: succeed, because the mortgage was recorded immediately.
B: not succeed, because the quitclaim deed did not reference the mortgage.
C: succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.
D: succeed, because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.
E: not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.
F: succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.
G: not succeed, because the woman was still legally responsible for the mortgage debt.
H: not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
I: succeed, because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage by accepting the quitclaim deed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real property question. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario starts with a rancher who owns the property in fee simple. He conveys it to a woman using a warranty deed. Then, the woman gives her niece a mortgage on the ranch as security for a $500,000 loan. The mortgage was recorded immediately. 

Two years later, the woman conveys the ranch to a farmer using a quitclaim deed, and the deed doesn't mention the mortgage. Then, the woman defaults on the mortgage, and the niece sues the farmer in an in personam action to recover the mortgage debt. 

I need to determine whether the niece (the mortgagee) will succeed in this action against the farmer.

First, understanding the key concepts here. 

An in personam action is a personal action against a person, seeking a judgment against them, as opposed to an in rem action, which is against the property. So, the niece is trying to hold the farmer personally liable for the mortgage debt.

Mortgages are liens on the property. When a mortgagor (here, the woman) conveys the property, the mortgage lien typically stays with the property. So, the general rule is that when a property is sold, the buyer takes it subject to any existing mortgages unless they've somehow assumed the mortgage or agreed to pay it.

But here, the woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed conveys whatever interest the grantor has at the time, but it doesn't make any warranties. So, the farmer would take the property subject to any existing liens or encumbrances, like the mortgage. But does that mean the farmer is personally liable for the mortgage debt?

Wait, normally, when you take property subject to a mortgage, you're not personally liable for the debt unless you've explicitly assumed it. So, if the farmer didn't agree to take on the mortgage, he might not be personally liable. But the question is about the niece suing the farmer in personam, so she's trying to make the farmer liable for the debt.

The mortgage was recorded, so the farmer would have constructive notice of it when he took the quitclaim deed. But does that affect personal liability?

In the scenario, the woman defaulted, so the niece is looking for someone else to pay. The woman is the mortgagor and primarily responsible. But if the farmer took the property, perhaps he's responsible? But I thought that without assuming the mortgage, he isn't liable.

Wait, but the mortgage was already on the property when the farmer took it. If the farmer didn't pay, the niece could foreclose on the property. But suing the farmer in personam to recover the debtâ€”does that require the farmer to have assumed the mortgage?

Because without an assumption, the farmer's obligation is to the property, not personally. So the niece could foreclose, but perhaps can't go after the farmer personally unless he's somehow obligated.

Wait, but the niece is the one who loaned the money to the woman, and the mortgage was on the ranch. The ranch is now with the farmer. If the woman defaults, the niece can foreclose on the ranch, which is now owned by the farmer. But the question is about an in personam action, so the niece is trying to get a personal judgment against the farmer, not just take the property.

So, in that case, does the farmer have personal liability? Or is the farmer only liable up to the value of the property?

I think that when a grantee takes property subject to a mortgage, they don't become personally liable for the debt. Their liability is limited to the property. So, the mortgagee can foreclose on the property, but can't go after the grantee's other assets.

So, in this case, the niece can probably foreclose on the ranch, but if the ranch isn't enough to cover the debt, she can't go after the farmer personally unless he assumed the mortgage.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Succeed because the mortgage was recorded immediately. But recording just gives constructive notice. It doesn't create personal liability on the part of the farmer unless he assumed the debt.

Option B: Not succeed because the quitclaim deed didn't reference the mortgage. The absence of reference might mean the farmer didn't assume it, but the recording would still affect the property. But the question is about personal liability.

Option C: Succeed because implied delegation of duties. I'm not sure about that. I don't think an implied delegation happens just because the property was conveyed; the farmer would have to agree to take on the mortgage.

Option D: Succeed because the quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the woman had, but the mortgage is a lien on the property. So, the farmer takes the property subject to the mortgage, but does that mean he's personally responsible for the debt? I don't think so. The farmer's obligation is to the property, not the debt itself.

Option E: Not succeed unless the farmer had constructive notice. But the mortgage was recorded, so he would have constructive notice. But again, notice doesn't make him personally liable, just that he can't claim bona fide purchaser status without notice. So, the niece can enforce the lien against the property, but not get a personal judgment against the farmer.

Option F: Succeed because the niece is a third-party beneficiary. I don't see how the conveyance between the woman and the farmer makes the niece a third-party beneficiary. The mortgage is between the woman and the niece.

Option G: Not succeed because the woman is still responsible. This makes sense because the woman is the mortgagor. The farmer didn't assume the mortgage, so the primary liability is on the woman. So, the niece would first go after the woman, but if the woman defaults, maybe the farmer isn't liable.

Option H: Not succeed because the farmer didn't promise to pay. That seems correct. Without assuming the mortgage, the farmer didn't undertake any personal obligation to pay the debt. So, the niece can't get an in personam judgment against him.

Option I: Succeed because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility by accepting the quitclaim deed. I don't think that's the case. Accepting a quitclaim deed makes him take the property subject to the mortgage, but that's a lien on the property, not a personal debt.

So, the key here is that when the farmer took the quitclaim deed, he took the property subject to the mortgage lien, but he didn't personally assume the mortgage debt. Therefore, the niece can enforce the lien against the property, but can't hold the farmer personally liable unless he agreed to it.

Therefore, the niece's in personam action against the farmer would not succeed because the farmer didn't assume the mortgage. The correct answer would be either H or G.

Wait, let me think again. The niece is suing the farmer in personam, meaning she's trying to get a personal judgment against him. But if the farmer didn't assume the mortgage, he's not personally liable. The mortgagee's remedy is against the property, not the person unless there's an assumption.

So, the correct answer would be H: not succeed because the farmer didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt.

Another angle: when a property is transferred subject to a mortgage, the grantee (farmer) doesn't become personally liable. The debt remains with the original mortgagor (woman). Therefore, the niece can't go after the farmer personally. So, the answer should be H.

The question revolves around whether the niece, as the mortgagee, can succeed in an in personam action against the farmer to recover the mortgage debt. The key issue is whether the farmer, who took the property via a quitclaim deed, can be held personally liable for the mortgage debt.

1. **Mortgage and Property Transfer**: The woman conveyed the ranch to the farmer using a quitclaim deed, which transfers whatever interest the grantor has at the time but does not make any warranties. The mortgage, which was recorded, creates a lien on the property. When the farmer took the property, he did so subject to this lien.

2. **Personal Liability**: Generally, when a grantee takes property subject to a mortgage, they are not personally liable for the mortgage debt unless they explicitly assume it. The farmer did not assume the mortgage, as there is no indication in the facts that he agreed to pay the debt.

3. **In Personam Action**: The niece is bringing an in personam action, seeking a personal judgment against the farmer. However, without an assumption of the mortgage, the farmerâ€™s liability is limited to the property itself. The niece can enforce the lien by foreclosing on the property, but she cannot hold the farmer personally liable for the debt.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. Recording the mortgage provides constructive notice but does not create personal liability for the farmer.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The absence of a reference to the mortgage in the quitclaim deed does not affect the farmerâ€™s personal liability, as the mortgage is a lien on the property.
   - **C**: Incorrect. There is no implied delegation of duties; the farmer did not agree to assume the mortgage.
   - **D**: Incorrect. The quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage lien, but it also does not make him personally liable for the debt.
   - **E**: Incorrect. Constructive notice of the mortgage exists due to recording, but this does not establish personal liability.
   - **F**: Incorrect. The niece is not a third-party beneficiary of the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.
   - **G**: Correct. The woman, as the mortgagor, remains primarily liable for the mortgage debt. The farmer did not assume the mortgage and is not personally liable.
   - **H**: Correct. The farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt, and without an assumption, he cannot be held personally liable.
   - **I**: Incorrect. Accepting the quitclaim deed makes the farmer subject to the mortgage lien but does not imply personal responsibility for the debt.

5. **Conclusion**: The niece cannot succeed in her in personam action against the farmer because he did not assume the mortgage debt. The correct answer is **H**.

Answer: H
