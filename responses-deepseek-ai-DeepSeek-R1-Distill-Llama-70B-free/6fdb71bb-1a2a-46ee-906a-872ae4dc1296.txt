Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that a container weighs 3.22 lb-force when empty. When it's filled with water at 60°F, the total mass of the container and its contents is 1.95 slugs. I need to find the volume of the container in cubic feet. They also give the density of water as 62.4 lb-force per cubic foot. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. So I remember that weight and mass are related. Weight is the force due to gravity, so in the English system, weight (W) is mass (m) multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (g), which is 32.2 ft/s². So W = m * g. But wait, in this problem, the container's weight is given as 3.22 lb-force when empty. So that's the weight, not the mass. So I'll probably need to convert that to mass.

Wait, but the total mass when filled with water is given as 1.95 slugs. So that's the mass of the container plus the mass of the water. So maybe I can find the mass of the water by subtracting the empty container's mass from the total mass.

Wait, but the container's weight is given as 3.22 lb-force. Since weight W = m_container * g. So m_container = W_container / g. Let's plug in the numbers. W is 3.22 lb-force, and g is 32.2 ft/s². So m_container = 3.22 / 32.2. Let me compute that. 3.22 divided by 32.2. Let's see, 32.2 times 0.1 is 3.22. Oh wait, 32.2 * 0.1 is 3.22. So m_container is 0.1 slugs.

Wait, that's interesting. So the empty container's mass is 0.1 slugs. Then the total mass when filled is 1.95 slugs. So the mass of the water would be 1.95 - 0.1 = 1.85 slugs. That makes sense.

Now, the mass of the water is 1.85 slugs. I know that mass (m) is equal to density (rho) multiplied by volume (V). So m = rho * V. So I can solve for V: V = m / rho.

Wait, but wait. The density of water is given in lb-force per cubic foot, which is a unit of weight density, not mass density. Oh, right, because in the English system, density can be expressed in mass per volume (like slugs per cubic foot) or weight per volume (lb-force per cubic foot). So I need to make sure I'm using the correct units.

So if the density provided is weight density (rho_weight) = 62.4 lb-force/ft³, then I can find the mass from that. Alternatively, since I have the mass of the water, I can find the volume by using mass = (weight density / g) * V. Because mass density (rho_mass) is weight density divided by g. So rho_mass = rho_weight / g.

So let me clarify. Weight density is rho_weight = 62.4 lb-force/ft³. So the mass density is rho_mass = (62.4 lb-force/ft³) / (32.2 ft/s²) ) = (62.4 / 32.2) slugs per cubic foot.

Calculating 62.4 divided by 32.2. Let's see, 32.2 times 1.94 is about 62.4. Because 32.2 * 2 = 64.4, which is a bit higher. So 32.2 * 1.94 = 32.2*(2 - 0.06) )= 64.4 - (32.2 * 0.06). 32.2 * 0.06 is 1.932, so 64.4 - 1.932 = 62.468. Close enough, so rho_mass is approximately 1.94 slugs/ft³.

Wait, but maybe I can compute it exactly. 62.4 divided by 32.2. Let me do the division:

32.2 * 1 = 32.2 → 62.4 - 32.2 = 30.2 left. Bring down a zero, 302 divided by 32.2. 32.2 * 9 = 289.8, so 9 with a remainder of 12.2. So 1.9 something. So maybe approximately 1.94 slugs per cubic foot.

But perhaps I should keep more exact terms instead of approximating. Let's see, perhaps it's better to avoid approximating and use exact fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach it another way. Since the mass of the water is 1.85 slugs, and the density is 62.4 lb-force per cubic foot, I can find the volume.

Wait, because m = rho_mass * V. So V = m / rho_mass.

But rho_mass is rho_weight / g. So V = m * g / rho_weight.

Wait, let me think again. Because rho_mass = rho_weight / g.

So, rho_mass = 62.4 lb-force/ft³ / 32.2 ft/s² → which would give slugs per cubic foot.

So, rho_mass = (62.4 /32.2) slugs/ft³ ≈ 1.938 slugs/ft³.

So then, V = m_water / rho_mass = 1.85 / (62.4/32.2) = 1.85 * (32.2/62.4).

Let me compute this. 32.2/62.4 is approximately 0.51587.

So 1.85 * 0.51587 ≈ Let's compute 1.85 * 0.5 = 0.925. 1.85 * 0.01587 ≈ approximately 0.02934. So total ≈ 0.925 + 0.02934 ≈ 0.9543 cubic feet.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.955, which is very close to this value.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly. 32.2 divided by 62.4 equals (322/624) → simplifying, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 161/312. Let me compute 161 ÷ 312.

312 × 0.5 is 156, so 0.5 → remainder 5. So 0.5 + 5/312.

5/312 ≈ 0.01603. So 0.51603.

So 1.85 × 0.51603.

Compute 1.85 * 0.5 = 0.925.

1.85 * 0.01603 = approximately 0.02965.

Adding them together: 0.925 + 0.02965 = 0.95465, which is approximately 0.9547, so 0.955 when rounded to three decimal places. So that matches option A: 0.955.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: Since the mass of the water is 1.85 slugs, and the density is 62.4 lb-force/ft³, which is the weight density.

So, weight of the water is mass * g = 1.85 slugs * 32.2 ft/s² = approximately 1.85 *32.2.

1.85 *32 = 59.2, and 1.85 *0.2 = 0.37 → total 59.57 lb-force.

So the weight of the water is 59.57 lb-force.

Density of water is 62.4 lb-force/ft³, so volume = weight / density = 59.57 /62.4.

Compute 59.57 ÷ 62.4.

Approximately, 62.4 × 0.954 ≈ 59.56 (since 62.4 * 0.9 = 56.16; 62.4*0.05=3.12 → 59.28; 0.004 → 0.2496 → total 59.28 + 0.2496=59.5296). So 0.954 → 59.5296. But our weight is 59.57, which is a little higher. So let's compute 59.57 ÷62.4.

Let me compute 5957 ÷62400.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 59.57 /62.4.

Let me think: 62.4 × 0.954 is 59.5296. So 0.954 gives us 59.5296. The difference is 59.57 -59.5296 = 0.0404.

So how much more is needed? 0.0404 /62.4 ≈ 0.000648. So total is approximately 0.954 + 0.000648 ≈ 0.9546, so 0.9546, which is about 0.955 cubic feet.

So that confirms the earlier calculation.

So the volume is approximately 0.955 cubic feet, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. The weight of the empty container is **3.22 lb-force**. Using the relationship \( W = m \cdot g \), where \( g = 32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), the mass of the empty container is:
   \[
   m_{\text{container}} = \frac{W_{\text{container}}}{g} = \frac{3.22}{32.2} = 0.1 \, \text{slugs}.
   \]

2. The total mass of the container and water is **1.95 slugs**. The mass of the water is therefore:
   \[
   m_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{total}} - m_{\text{container}} = 1.95 - 0.1 = 1.85 \, \text{slugs}.
   \]

3. The density of water is given as **62.4 lb-force/ft³**, which is a weight density. To find the mass density, we divide by \( g \):
   \[
   \rho_{\text{mass}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{weight}}}{g} = \frac{62.4}{32.2} \approx 1.94 \, \text{slugs/ft}^3.
   \]

4. The volume of the water is calculated using the formula \( m = \rho \cdot V \), rearranged to \( V = \frac{m}{\rho} \). Substituting the values:
   \[
   V_{\text{water}} = \frac{m_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{mass}}} = \frac{1.85}{1.94} \approx 0.9547 \, \text{ft}^3.
   \]

5. Rounding to three decimal places, the volume is approximately **0.955 ft³**, which matches option **A**.

Thus, the volume of the container is **0.955 cubic feet**.
