Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about impeachment in the United States. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which statement about impeachment is not true. The options are A through D. I remember from my civics class that impeachment is a process outlined in the Constitution, so I should probably start by recalling what I know about that.

First, the grounds for impeachment. I think the Constitution says something like "high crimes and misdemeanors." So option A says that grounds include high crimes and misdemeanors. That sounds correct. Then option C mentions treason and bribery. Wait, the Constitution does specifically list treason and bribery as grounds, so C is also true. So A and C are both correct statements, meaning the incorrect answer can't be either of them.

Next, the process. I remember that impeachment starts in the House of Representatives. They have the sole power to impeach, which means bringing charges. So the House votes on whether to impeach. I think it requires a majority vote, not a supermajority. So option B says a majority vote is needed in the House to invoke charges, which sounds right. So B is a true statement.

Then, after the House impeaches, the case goes to the Senate for a trial. The Senate decides whether to convict and remove the official. I remember that the Senate requires a two-thirds majority to convict, which is more than a simple majority. So option D says a three-fourths vote is needed. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Three-fourths is 75%, which is higher than two-thirds (which is about 66.67%). So D is incorrect because it's three-fourths instead of two-thirds.

Wait, but let me make sure. The Constitution says that the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. And the standard is that a two-thirds majority is needed for conviction. So if the option says three-fourths, that's wrong.

So the question is which statement is not true. So the incorrect statement is D, because it's three-fourths instead of two-thirds.

Wait, let me check the options again. The question is which is not true about impeachment.

Option D: A three-fourths vote in the Senate is necessary to convict and remove from office.

Yes, that's incorrect because it's two-thirds, not three-fourths. So the false statement is D.

The question asks which statement about impeachment is not true. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Grounds for impeachment include "high crimes and misdemeanors." This is correct, as stated in the Constitution.
- **Option B**: A majority vote in the House is necessary to invoke charges of impeachment. This is correct, as the House requires a simple majority to impeach.
- **Option C**: Grounds for impeachment include treason and bribery. This is correct, as the Constitution explicitly lists these as grounds.
- **Option D**: A three-fourths vote in the Senate is necessary to convict and remove from office. This is incorrect because the Senate requires a two-thirds majority, not three-fourths, to convict.

The false statement is **D**.

Answer: D
