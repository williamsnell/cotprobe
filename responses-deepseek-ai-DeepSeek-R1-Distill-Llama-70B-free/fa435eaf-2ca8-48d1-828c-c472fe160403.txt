Okay, so I have this question about GDP deflator, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see, the question says that nominal GDP is $5000 and real GDP is $4000. I need to find the GDP deflator.

Hmm, I remember that the GDP deflator is a measure of the price level, kind of like the average price of all goods and services produced. But how exactly is it calculated? Oh wait, I think the formula is something like the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP, multiplied by 100 maybe?

Wait, right, the formula is GDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100. So in this case, nominal is 5000 and real is 4000. Plugging those in, 5000 divided by 4000 equals... let me calculate that. 5000 divided by 4000 is 1.25. Then multiply by 100, which gives 125. So the GDP deflator is 125.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Sometimes I get confused with the Consumer Price Index. Oh right, the CPI is different. The GDP deflator uses the same base year as the real GDP, so the formula should definitely be nominal over real times 100. So yes, 5000/4000 is 1.25, times 100 is 125. So the answer should be option B, which is 125.

The GDP Deflator is calculated using the formula:

GDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) × 100

Given that Nominal GDP is $5000 and Real GDP is $4000, the calculation is:

GDP Deflator = (5000 / 4000) × 100 = 1.25 × 100 = 125

Thus, the correct answer is:

B: 125
