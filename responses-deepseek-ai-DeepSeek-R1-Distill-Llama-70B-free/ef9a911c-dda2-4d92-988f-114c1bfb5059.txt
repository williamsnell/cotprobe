Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about when humans started controlling their food sources. The question is asking how long ago human groups began actively controlling their food by creating conditions for growth. Hmm, I think this is about the origins of agriculture.

I remember that the transition from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one that's more agricultural is a significant milestone. I think this happened during the Neolithic period. Wait, when was that? I recall that the Neolithic Revolution started around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. So that would place it within the past 12,000 years.

Wait, but let me think again. Some sources say that plant and animal domestication began around 12,000 years ago, specifically in the Fertile Crescent. So that would align with option A, which is within the past 12,000 years.

But wait, are there any earlier signs of controlled food production? Like, I've heard about evidence of early farming in places like the Levant around 13,000 years ago, but that's still within the 12,000-year timeframe if we're considering the past 12,000 years as the window. So I think the correct answer is A.

So looking at the options:
A: within the past 12,000 years
Yes, that's the one.

The question asks when humans began controlling their food sources through artificial production, which relates to the origins of agriculture. This transition, known as the Neolithic Revolution, occurred around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, specifically in regions like the Fertile Crescent. While there are earlier signs of domestication, they still fall within the 12,000-year window. Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
