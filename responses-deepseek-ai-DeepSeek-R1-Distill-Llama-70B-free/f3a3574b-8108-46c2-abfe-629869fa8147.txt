Okay, so I've got this question about the lac operon in E. coli, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let's try to think this through step by step. 

The question is about partial diploids and whether enzyme production is constitutive or inducible in each case. I remember that the lac operon is responsible for the metabolism of lactose in E. coli. It consists of several genes: the regulatory gene i, which produces the repressor, and the structural genes z, y, a, which are responsible for lactose metabolism. The operon is usually regulated by the presence of an inducer, like allolactose, which inactivates the repressor.

So, partial diploids have two copies of the operon—probably because they have an F' plasmid or something similar that carries a copy of the lac operon. Each copy might have different mutations. The key here is that the wild-type alleles are dominant over their mutant counterparts. 

The question gives three partial diploid scenarios, (a), (b), and (c), and I need to determine the outcome for each regarding enzyme production. The options are whether it's constitutive (always on) or inducible (needs the inducer). 

Let me tackle each case one by one.

Starting with part (a): The genotype is i+ o+ z- y- a- / i+ o c z+ y+ a+. Wait, wait—I think I might have misread that. Oh, right, it's written as i^+ o^+ z^- y^- a^- i^+ o^c z^+ y^+ a^+. Hmm, actually, maybe the notation is that each cell has two copies, like one from each parent. So the first part is the genotype of one chromosome, and the second is the other. Or maybe it's written as the two operons. Wait, the notation can be a bit confusing. Let me think: The first part is probably the genotype of one plasmid, and the second is the other. So, for (a), the two operons are:

Operon 1: i+ o+ z- y- a-
Operon 2: i+ o^c z+ y+ a+

Wait, what's o^c? Oh, right, o^c is a constitutive operator mutation. So the operator can't bind the repressor, meaning that the operon is always on, regardless of the repressor. 

Let me break down the alleles:

For each operon, the i gene is present. So the first operon has i+ (wild-type, produces repressor), and the second also has i+ (so both can produce repressor). Wait, but wait—no, wait, each operon is on a separate molecule, so each has its own i gene? Or is the i gene elsewhere? Wait, no, the lac operon's i gene is actually not part of the operon itself but is a regulatory gene. Wait, no—wait, no: the lac operon includes the structural genes z, y, a, and the regulatory region (o operator) and the promoter, but the i gene is a separate gene, not part of the operon. So, wait, in these partial diploids, each strain has a copy of the operon, but the i gene is present on both chromosomes, I think. Or is it that each partial diploid has one or two copies of the i gene?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: The i gene encodes the repressor. The wild-type i+ produces a functional repressor, whereas i- (mutant) doesn't. So, in the partial diploid, if any copy has i+, it can produce a repressor. Since the repressor is a protein that can act on any operon in the cell, it's a diffusible molecule.

So, for the cell to have the repressor, at least one of the i genes must be functional (i+). Because the wild-type allele is dominant, so if one is i+ and the other i-, the cell will produce repressor.

Wait, but the question says that the wild-type allele is dominant to its mutant homologue. So, in any case where a wild-type allele is present, it will dominate. So, for example, if a cell has i+ and i-, the i+ will produce repressor, which will affect both operons because the repressor acts on the operator regions.

Now, back to case (a): The two operons are as follows.

Operon 1: i+ o+ z- y- a-
Operon 2: i+ o^c z+ y+ a+

Wait, no, the i is not part of the operon, so probably each operon doesn't have its own i. Wait, no, the i gene is separate. So perhaps in the partial diploid, the cell has two copies of the operon, each on a different F plasmid or chromosome. But the i gene is present elsewhere, perhaps in the chromosome. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In E. coli, the lac operon is on the chromosome. When they talk about partial diploids, they're usually referring to having an F' plasmid that carries a lac operon. So the cell has its own chromosomal lac operon and another copy from the plasmid. So, for each gene in the operon, the cell has two copies. 

So for each of the operons (chromosome and plasmid), their i genes would be present. Wait, no, the i gene is not part of the operon. The operon includes the promoter, operator, and the genes z, y, a. The i gene is a regulatory gene located elsewhere on the chromosome. So, in a partial diploid, the cell has two copies of the operon (each with their own o, z, y, a), but the i gene is present in the chromosome. So, the cell's i gene would be the one determining whether repressor is made. Wait, but in the question, each partial diploid has two i alleles. So perhaps each operon includes the i gene? Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation. Let's look at the genotype given in part (a): i^+ o^+ z^- y^- a^- i^+ o^c z^+ y^+ a^+. So, this is written as two sets, each with i, o, z, y, a. So each operon has its own i gene. So each operon is like a separate entity, each with their own i, o, z, y, a. So the partial diploid has two copies of the operon, each including their own regulatory genes. So, in this case, the cell has two copies of the operon, each with their own i, o, z, y, a.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing because usually, the i gene is not part of the operon. Maybe the way the question is written, each operon has an i gene, but that's probably incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the i is a separate gene, and the question is listing the alleles of the cell for the i gene and the operon genes. Hmm, perhaps the way to interpret it is that the cell has two copies of the operon, each with their own o, z, y, a, and the i gene is present in both copies. Or perhaps it's a diploid for the entire operon, including the i gene. Wait, the question is about the lac operon, so I think the i gene is separate. So, perhaps the i is only present once, but the operon is diploid. Hmm, this is getting a bit muddled. Let me try to approach this differently.

Perhaps each partial diploid has two copies of the operon, each with their own operator and structural genes, but the i gene is present in the cell as a single gene. So, if the cell has i+, then the repressor is made, which affects both operons. Alternatively, if i is mutant (i-), then no repressor is made, and the operons are on constitutively, provided the operator is functional. No, wait, the operator's functionality also matters. If the operator is mutated (o^c), it can't bind repressor, so the operon is always on, regardless of the presence of repressor.

Wait, perhaps I should model each scenario step by step.

Let's take part (a): The two operons are:

Operon 1: i+ o+ z- y- a-
Operon 2: i+ o^c z+ y+ a+

Wait, but each operon has its own i? That can't be right because each cell would have only one i gene. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the cell has two copies of the operon (each with their own o, z, y, a), and the i gene is present as i+ (so the cell produces repressor).

Wait, perhaps each partial diploid has two copies of the operon, each with their own operator, but the i gene is a single gene; but in the question, the notation might be that each operon has an i, which I'm not sure is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the i is a separate gene, and the rest are the operon genes. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think of it another way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the genotype is written as the two alleles for each gene. So, for the i gene, the cell is i+/i+. For o, it's o+/o^c. For z, it's z-/z+. For y, y-/y+. For a, a-/a+.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the cell is diploid for the operon, but the i gene is a single gene; but wait, the i gene is regulatory and separate, so perhaps it's not part of the operon. Therefore, for the i gene, the cell is i+/i+ (homozygous) or i+/i- (heterozygous), etc.

Wait, perhaps in the question, the notation is for each operon. For example, in case (a), the cell has two operons. The first operon has i+, o+, z-, y-, a-. The second operon has i+, o^c, z+, y+, a+. So for each gene, the cell has two copies: i+ from both, o+ and o^c, etc.

Wait, but that would mean the cell has two i+ alleles, which would mean the repressor is made. So the repressor would be present and could bind to operators that are functional.

So, for each operon:

Operon 1: o+ (functional operator), so if repressor is present, it will bind and repress. If there's no repressor, it's on.

Operon 2: o^c is a constitutive operator, meaning it cannot be repressed. So this operon is always on, regardless of the presence of repressor.

But since the cell has two i+ alleles, the repressor is produced. So in the absence of inducer, the repressor is active and would bind to any functional operator.

So for operon 1: o+ is functional. Without inducer, the repressor is bound, so operon 1 is off.

Operon 2: o^c, so repressor can't bind. So operon 2 is always on.

But the structural genes in each operon: operon 1 has z-, y-, a- (all non-functional). So even if operon 1 is on, it can't produce functional enzymes because the genes are mutant. But operon 2 has z+, y+, a+ (all functional). So operon 2 is on, producing the enzymes.

So in this case, the cell would produce enzymes constitutively because operon 2 is always on, regardless of the presence of the inducer. So (a) would have constitutive synthesis.

Wait, but wait: the presence of inducer affects the repressor. So when inducer is present, it inactivates the repressor. So normally, without inducer, operon 1 is repressed (since o+ is functional and repressor is present), and operon 2 is on. When inducer is present, repressor is inactive, so operon 1 would be on, but its genes are non-functional. So overall, enzyme production is always on because operon 2 is always on. So (a) would be constitutive.

Moving to part (b): genotype is i- o+ z+ y+ a+ / i+ o+ z+ y- a-.

So for the i gene, the cell is i-/i+ (heterozygous). Since the wild-type i+ is dominant, the cell will produce repressor. So the presence of the i+ allele means that the repressor is present.

Now, the operons:

Operon 1: o+ (functional operator), z+, y+, a+.

Operon 2: o+ (functional), z+, y-, a-.

So, the repressor is present because i+ is functional.

In the absence of inducer, the repressor is active and binds to both operons' o+ operators, repressing them. So neither operon is expressed. When inducer is present, the repressor is inactivated, so both operons are expressed.

But wait, what about the structural genes? Let's see:

Operon 1: z+, y+, a+. So all functional. So when operon 1 is active, it can produce all the enzymes.

Operon 2: z+ (good), but y- and a- (non-functional). So operon 2 can produce beta-galactosidase (z), but not permease (y) or transacetylase (a). But since the question is about enzyme production in general, not specific enzymes, as long as any enzyme is produced, it counts. But the operon's regulation is what's being asked.

So the regulation here is that both operons are under the control of o+, which is functional. So without inducer, both are repressed. With inducer, both are induced. So enzyme production is inducible, meaning it only happens when the inducer is present. So (b) would be inducible.

Wait, but wait: the cell can produce enzymes only when the operon is active. Since both operons are under normal regulation (o+), the presence of inducer will turn both on. So enzyme production is inducible, not constitutive.

Wait, but what about if one operon is functional and the other isn't? Let me think: the cell has two operons. When inducer is present, both operons are on. But operon 1 has all functional genes, so enzymes will be produced. Operon 2 can't produce y and a, but z is functional. So beta-galactosidase is produced by both operons, but the other enzymes only by operon 1. So overall, the cell can metabolize lactose only when the inducer is present. So (b) is inducible.

Now, part (c): genotype is i+ o^c z+ y- a- / i- o+ z- y- a-.

So, first, the i gene: one i+ and one i-. Since i+ is dominant, the cell will produce repressor.

Looking at the operons:

Operon 1: o^c (constitutive), z+, y-, a-.

Operon 2: o+ (functional), z-, y-, a-.

Repressor is present because i+ is there.

So, operon 1's operator is o^c, meaning it's always on, regardless of repressor. So operon 1 is on. Operon 2's operator is o+, so when repressor is present, it's repressed. Without inducer, repressor is active, so operon 2 is off. With inducer, repressor is inactive, so operon 2 is on.

But let's look at the structural genes.

Operon 1: z+ (good), y- (no permease), a- (no transacetylase). So, operon 1 can produce beta-galactosidase but not the other enzymes. But the operon's regulation is constitutive, so it's always on.

Operon 2: z- (no beta-gal), y- and a- (no permease or transacetylase). So operon 2, even when on, can't produce any functional enzymes because all the structural genes are mutant.

So overall, enzyme production is determined by operon 1. Since operon 1 is always on, it produces beta-galactosidase constitutively. The other enzymes (y and a) are not functional in either operon, but the question is about enzyme production in general, not specific ones. Wait, but the lac operon includes z, y, a. So if any of these are functional and the operon is on, those enzymes are produced.

Wait, but the question is about the production of the enzymes as a whole. So, if at least one enzyme is produced constitutively, does that count as constitutive synthesis overall? Let me think.

In this case, operon 1 is on all the time, and it has a functional z gene. So beta-galactosidase is produced constitutively. The other enzymes (permease and transacetylase) are not produced because their genes are mutant. But the presence of beta-galactosidase alone would mean that some enzyme is being produced constitutively. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking whether the operon is inducible or constitutive in terms of being able to metabolize lactose, which requires all three enzymes. But the question is more about the production of the enzymes, not the functionality in lactose metabolism.

Wait, the question says, "whether enzyme production will result constitutively or inducibly." So, if any enzyme is produced constitutively, then the answer would be constitutive. Alternatively, if all enzymes are not produced unless induced, then it's inducible.

In this case, operon 1 is always on, producing beta-galactosidase (z+), but the other enzymes are not produced because their genes are mutant. So, enzyme production (for beta-gal) is constitutive. The other enzymes (y and a) are not produced at all. So, the cell is producing at least one enzyme constitutively, so overall, the answer for (c) would be constitutive.

Wait, but let me double-check. The operon 1 is on all the time, producing z, but the other operon is off because its operator is o+ and repressor is present (i+). So, in the absence of inducer, only operon 1 is on, producing beta-gal. When inducer is present, operon 2 is also on,
