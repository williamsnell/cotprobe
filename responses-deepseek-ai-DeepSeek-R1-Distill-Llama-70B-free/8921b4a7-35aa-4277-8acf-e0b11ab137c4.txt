Okay, so I have this question about homelessness in the United States in 2016. The options are from A to J, each with a different number. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that homelessness is a significant issue in the US, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. I think it's in the hundreds of thousands, but I'm not certain. Let me try to break this down.

I recall that around 2016, the number was somewhere around half a million people. Maybe a little more or less. So looking at the options, B is 500,000 and E is 600,000. Also, J is 550,000. So these are the closest ones.

Wait, I think the annual reports usually cite a figure around 550,000 on a given night. But sometimes the total number throughout the year can be higher because people move in and out of homelessness. However, the question asks about how many people were homeless in 2016, not specifying a particular time. But often, these statistics are point-in-time counts, like a single night.

I've heard that the official numbers from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are often around that 500k mark. But sometimes, in the mid-2010s, it was closer to 550,000. So J is 550,000. But I might be mixing up the exact years.

Alternatively, I remember that in 2016, the number was about 550,000 people. So that would point to option J. But another thought: sometimes, the numbers can vary depending on the source. Some might say it's higher, like 600,000, but I think HUD's annual report is the most reliable.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with another year. Let me think. In 2017, I think the number was around 554,000, so maybe 2016 was similar. If that's the case, then option J (550,000) would be the closest.

But wait, another angle: sometimes the numbers in the news or other reports might combine different categories, like chronic homelessness, families, etc., but the overall number is usually just under 600,000. So 550k makes sense.

Looking at the options again: B is 500k, E is 600k, J is 550k. I think the correct answer is J, 550,000.

The correct answer is J: 550,000.
