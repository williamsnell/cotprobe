Question:

A healthy 4-year-old girl is brought for a well-child examination. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border.

E: Atrial septal defect
F: Ventricular septal defect
G: Coarctation of the aorta
H: Mitral regurgitation
I: Aortic stenosis
J: Pulmonary stenosis

Okay, I need to figure out this heart murmur question. Let's start by reading the scenario carefully.

So, the patient is a healthy 4-year-old girl. She's here for a well-child exam, which suggests she's asymptomatic aside from maybe the findings on physical exam. 

On auscultation, there's a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border. Hmm, where is that? The upper left sternal border is where you typically hear aortic or pulmonary valve sounds. A systolic ejection murmur often points towards issues with the semilunar valves, like aortic stenosis or pulmonary stenosis. Or maybe something else causing increased flow, like a VSD.

Then, S2 is widely split and doesn't vary with respiration. Normally, S2 can vary with breathingâ€”inspiration increases venous return, which can affect the splitting. But if it doesn't vary, that suggests it's a fixed split. Fixed split S2 is a hallmark of an atrial septal defect (ASD). Because in ASD, there's increased flow through the pulmonary valve due to the left-to-right shunt, and the fixed nature is because the defect allows equalization of pressures between the atria, so respiration doesn't affect it as much.

Additionally, there's a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. The lower left sternal border is the tricuspid area. A mid-diastolic murmur there usually indicates increased flow across the tricuspid valve, which can happen if there's more blood flowing into the right ventricle. In the context of an ASD, the left-to-right shunt would increase flow through the pulmonary artery and the tricuspid valve, leading to that diastolic murmur.

Putting it together: the systolic ejection murmur could be from increased flow through the pulmonary valve (as seen in ASD). The widely split and fixed S2 adds up, and the diastolic murmur at the tricuspid area also fits with increased flow from the shunt.

Looking at the options:

E is Atrial septal defect. That fits. Let me think about other options just to be sure.

Option F is VSD. VSDs typically present with a holosystolic or pansystolic murmur, not just a systolic ejection. Also, S2 in VSD might not be as widely split unless there's significant pulmonary hypertension, which isn't indicated here.

Option J is Pulmonary stenosis. That would cause a systolic ejection murmur, but the S2 might be more narrowly split or maybe have a softer P2 if pulmonary artery pressure drops. Also, the mid-diastolic murmur isn't typical for pulmonary stenosis alone.

Option B: Tricuspid atresia. That's a cyanotic heart disease, and the child is described as healthy, so probably not cyanotic. Also, the murmurs would be different.

Option D: Tetralogy of Fallot. That's a cyanotic congenital heart defect with a harsh systolic ejection murmur due to pulmonary stenosis, and possibly a harsher holosystolic if there's a VSD component. Plus, the S2 might not be as split since TOF usually has a single S2 or reversed splitting.

Option E seems the best fit. The presence of a systolic ejection murmur (from increased pulmonary flow), fixed split S2, and a tricuspid diastolic murmur all point towards ASD.

The patient is a healthy 4-year-old girl with a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, a widely split and fixed S2, and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. These findings are characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD). 

- The systolic ejection murmur is due to increased flow through the pulmonary valve, a result of the left-to-right shunt in ASD.
- The widely split and fixed S2 is a hallmark of ASD because the defect allows equalization of pressures between the atria, making the splitting independent of respiration.
- The mid-diastolic murmur at the lower left sternal border indicates increased flow across the tricuspid valve, also consistent with ASD.

Other options such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) or pulmonary stenosis do not align with the combination of findings, particularly the fixed split S2. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is atrial septal defect.
