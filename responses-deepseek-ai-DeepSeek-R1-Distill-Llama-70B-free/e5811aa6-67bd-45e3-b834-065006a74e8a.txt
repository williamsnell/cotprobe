Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about a Gigabit Ethernet LAN and how many frames get destroyed due to noise. Hmm, I remember that Gigabit Ethernet has a speed of 1 Gbps, which is 10^9 bits per second.

The average frame size is given as 1000 bytes. Oh wait, I should probably convert that to bits because the transmission speed is in bits per second. Since 1 byte is 8 bits, 1000 bytes would be 1000 * 8 = 8000 bits per frame.

Now, the noise duration is 2 milliseconds. I need to find out how much data is transmitted in that time because any data being transmitted during the noise will be destroyed. Let me think about the steps:

1. Calculate the data rate in bits per second.
2. Convert the noise time from milliseconds to seconds.
3. Multiply the data rate by the time to get the total bits transmitted during noise.
4. Divide that by the frame size in bits to find the number of frames affected.

So, step by step:

Gigabit Ethernet is 1 Gbps, which is 1e9 bits per second.

The noise lasts 2 ms. To convert that to seconds, I divide by 1000. So 2 ms is 0.002 seconds.

Now, the amount of data sent during the noise is rate * time. So 1e9 bits/s * 0.002 s = 2e6 bits. Oh wait, 1e9 is 1,000,000,000. Multiply by 0.002 gives 2,000,000 bits.

Each frame is 8000 bits. So the number of frames is 2,000,000 bits / 8000 bits per frame. Let's do that division: 2e6 / 8e3 = 250 frames. 

So the answer should be 250 frames. Let me check the options. Option J is 250. So the answer is J.

To determine how many frames are destroyed due to noise in a Gigabit Ethernet LAN, we start by calculating the total amount of data transmitted during the noise duration and then divide by the frame size.

1. **Data Rate**: Gigabit Ethernet operates at \(1 \, \text{Gbps} = 10^9 \, \text{bits/second}\).
2. **Noise Duration**: The noise lasts \(2 \, \text{ms}\), which is \(0.002 \, \text{seconds}\) when converted to seconds.
3. **Data Transmitted During Noise**: The total data transmitted during the noise is:
   \[
   \text{Data} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 10^9 \, \text{bits/second} \times 0.002 \, \text{seconds} = 2 \times 10^6 \, \text{bits}.
   \]
4. **Frame Size**: Each frame is \(1000 \, \text{bytes}\), which is equivalent to \(1000 \times 8 = 8000 \, \text{bits}\).
5. **Number of Frames Destroyed**: The number of frames destroyed is:
   \[
   \text{Frames} = \frac{\text{Data}}{\text{Frame Size}} = \frac{2 \times 10^6 \, \text{bits}}{8000 \, \text{bits/frame}} = 250 \, \text{frames}.
   \]

Thus, the number of frames destroyed due to the noise is **250**.

The correct answer is **J**.
