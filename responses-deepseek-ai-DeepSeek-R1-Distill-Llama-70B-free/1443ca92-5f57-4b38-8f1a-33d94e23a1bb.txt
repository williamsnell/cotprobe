Okay, so I have this question about calculating the future value of an investment. Let me think through how to approach it. The question says that the principal is $1,000, the interest rate is 8% compounded annually, and the time is 3 years. I need to find the future value from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that compound interest is calculated using the formula FV = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but wait, since it's compounded annually, the n would be 1. So the formula simplifies to FV = P * (1 + r)^t. Right, because when it's annual, each year's interest is added once.

So breaking it down, P is $1,000, r is 8% which is 0.08, and t is 3 years. Let me plug these into the formula.

First, calculate (1 + 0.08) which is 1.08. Then raise that to the power of 3 because it's three years. Let me compute 1.08^3. Wait, what's 1.08 multiplied by itself three times?

Let me do it step by step. 1.08 * 1.08 is 1.1664. Then, multiply that by 1.08 again. So 1.1664 * 1.08. Let's calculate that. 

1.1664 * 1.08: Let's see, 1 times 1.1664 is 1.1664, and 0.08 times 1.1664 is 0.093312. Adding them together gives 1.1664 + 0.093312 = 1.259712. So 1.08^3 is approximately 1.259712.

Now multiply this by the principal, which is $1,000. So 1,000 * 1.259712 equals 1259.712. Rounding to two decimal places, that's $1,259.71.

Looking at the options, option E is 1259.71, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check each step. 

1.08^1 is 1.08. 1.08^2 is 1.08 * 1.08 = 1.1664. 1.08^3 is 1.1664 * 1.08. Let me recalculate that product.

1.1664 * 1.08:

1.1664 * 1 = 1.1664
1.1664 * 0.08 = 0.093312
Adding together: 1.1664 + 0.093312 = 1.259712. Yep, that's correct.

So 1000 * 1.259712 is indeed 1259.71, which is option E. I don't see any mistakes here. So I'm confident that E is the right choice.

To calculate the future value of a $1,000 investment with an 8% annual interest rate compounded annually over 3 years, we use the formula for compound interest:

\[
FV = P \cdot (1 + r)^t
\]

Where:
- \( P = 1000 \) (principal),
- \( r = 0.08 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( t = 3 \) (years).

First, calculate \( 1 + r = 1 + 0.08 = 1.08 \). Then, raise this to the power of 3:

\[
1.08^3 = 1.08 \cdot 1.08 \cdot 1.08 = 1.259712
\]

Now, multiply by the principal:

\[
FV = 1000 \cdot 1.259712 = 1259.71
\]

Thus, the future value of the investment is $1,259.71, which corresponds to option E.
