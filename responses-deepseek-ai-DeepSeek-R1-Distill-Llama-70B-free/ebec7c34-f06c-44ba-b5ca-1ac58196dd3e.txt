Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contracts, specifically in the context of attorney-client relationships. Hmm, I remember that contracts can be a bit tricky, especially when it comes to different types like express, implied, quasi, etc. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is asking: If a client accepts an attorney's services without an agreement on the fee amount, what kind of contract is that? The options are A through J, each representing a different type of contract or situation.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The client is accepting services, so there's some sort of agreement. But they didn't discuss or agree on the fee. So, what does that mean in terms of contract law?

I remember that contracts can be express or implied. Express contracts are where the terms are explicitly stated, either written or oral. Implied contracts are where the agreement is shown through actions or circumstances rather than explicit words.

In this case, there's no express agreement about the fee. So, does that mean it's an implied contract? Probably, because the client is accepting the services, implying that they agree to pay a reasonable fee even if they didn't discuss the exact amount.

Wait, but what kind of implied contract? There's implied-in-fact and implied-in-law. Implied-in-fact is based on the parties' conduct, like when you go to a doctor and they treat you, you imply you'll pay. Implied-in-law, or quasi-contract, is more about situations where one party is unjustly enriched, and the law imposes an obligation to pay, even if there was no actual agreement.

So here, the attorney and client have a relationship where the client is accepting services. There's no express contract about the fee, but the law would imply that the client should pay a reasonable amount. That sounds like an implied-in-fact contract because it's based on the mutual conduct of the partiesâ€”accepting services and providing them, respectively.

Looking at the options, E is implied-in-law (quasi-contract), H is implied-in-fact. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but could it be quasi-contract? No, because quasi-contract applies when there's no actual agreement, but one party benefits at the expense of the other. Here, both parties are acting in a way that shows mutual agreement to form a contract, just not about the fee. So it's more about the implied terms of the contract rather than a situation where the law steps in to create a contractual obligation where none existed before.

So yes, it's an implied-in-fact contract. Therefore, the correct answer should be H.

When a client accepts an attorney's services without an explicit agreement about the fee, the situation falls under an implied-in-fact contract. This type of contract is based on the conduct of the parties, where the client implicitly agrees to pay a reasonable fee for the services rendered, even though the exact amount was not discussed. This is distinct from an implied-in-law contract (quasi-contract), which applies in cases of unjust enrichment without mutual conduct indicating an agreement. Here, the mutual acceptance of services implies a contractual obligation, making the correct classification an implied-in-fact contract.

Answer: H
