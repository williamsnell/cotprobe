Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about whether pure capitalism is adaptable to changes in consumer tastes. Hmm, I remember that capitalism is an economic system where private entities own the means of production and make decisions based on supply and demand. 

In pure capitalism, the market is driven by the interactions of supply and demand without government intervention. So, if consumer tastes change, businesses would need to respond to stay competitive. They'd probably shift their production to meet the new demands. Otherwise, if they don't adapt, they might lose customers and face financial trouble.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one. Option A says pure capitalism adapts by adjusting production and resource markets. That makes sense because businesses adjust based on what consumers want. Option B claims it disregards changes in resource markets, which doesn't seem right because resource markets are part of the supply side, and capitalism does respond to those changes. Option C says it doesn't adjust production based on consumer tastes, which contradicts what I know because businesses in capitalism do change production to meet demand. Option D says it's immune to changes, which is definitely not true because adaptation is key in a capitalist system.

So the correct answer should be A. It's about how pure capitalism responds by adjusting production to match what consumers want and the resources needed for that.

The correct answer is A because pure capitalism adapts to changes in consumer tastes by adjusting production to meet new demands, ensuring businesses remain competitive.
