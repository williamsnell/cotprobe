Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the stability of different helium species. The question is asking whether He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ and He. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that helium is a noble gas, right? It's in group 18, so it's supposed to be pretty unreactive and doesn't usually form compounds because it has a full valence shell. But wait, in some cases, like under high pressures or in certain conditions, noble gases can form molecules or ions.

So, the question is about He₂ and He₂⁺. I think He₂ is a diatomic molecule. I've heard that He₂ is possible, but it's not very stable. It probably has a very weak bond because helium's filled shell makes it hard to form strong bonds.

Now, He₂⁺ would be an ion. So, how does that form? Well, maybe through ionization. If He₂ loses an electron, it becomes He₂⁺. But wait, ions can sometimes be more stable than their neutral counterparts if the bonding is better. But I'm not sure about this specific case.

I remember that diatomic ions can have different bond orders. Bond order is (number of bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2. For O₂, for example, the bond order is 2, which is strong. But for O₂⁻, it's lower. So how does this apply to helium?

Let me think about the molecular orbitals for He₂. Helium has two electrons in the 1s orbital. When they form He₂, each contributes two, so the bonding and antibonding orbitals would be filled. The molecular orbital configuration would be something like (σ2s)² (σ*2s)². So the bond order is (2-2)/2 = 0. Which means no bond, right? So He₂ is actually not bound—it doesn't form a stable molecule. So in reality, He₂ doesn't really exist under normal conditions because the bond is so weak. They might only form under high pressure or in specific situations.

Wait, but the question is about He₂⁺. So if He₂ has a bond order of zero, what about He₂⁺? He₂⁺ would have one less electron. So the configuration would be (σ2s)² (σ*2s)¹. So bond order is (2-1)/2 = 0.5. So a bond order of 0.5 is better than zero, which means there's a bit of bonding. So He₂⁺ should be more stable than He₂ because it has a higher bond order.

But wait, bond order isn't the only factor for stability. The overall energy of the molecule or ion matters. Also, comparing He₂⁺ to He (which is just a single atom). He is a monoatomic gas, so it's already in a very stable state. The He atom has a filled 1s orbital, making it very stable on its own.

So if He₂⁺ has a bond order of 0.5, that's a very weak bond. Might it be less stable than two separate He atoms? Because each He atom is stable on its own. If He₂⁺ has a lower bond energy than the energy required to break the atoms apart, it might not be stable compared to two He atoms.

Wait, but He₂⁺ has a bond, whereas He as single atoms don't. So in terms of stability, a bonded species is more stable than two separate atoms if the bond energy is positive. But with a bond order of 0.5, the bond is very weak. So maybe He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂, but less stable than He.

Wait, the question is whether He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂, and also whether it's more stable than He.

So, He₂ has bond order zero, so it's not even a real molecule. He₂⁺ has bond order 0.5, so it's a bit more stable than He₂. But compared to He, which is a single atom, very stable, He₂⁺ is probably less stable than He because even a weak bond might not compensate for the energy required to bring two atoms together. 

So, putting it all together: He is the most stable, followed by He₂⁺, which is more stable than He₂.

Wait, but the options are about which is more stable than the others. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: He₂+ is most stable among He, He₂, and He₂⁺.

B: He₂+ is more stable than He₂ but less than He.

C: All same.

D: He₂+ is least.

E: He and He₂ same, both more than He₂⁺.

F: He₂+ more stable than He but less than He₂.

G: He₂+ is less stable than both He₂ and He.

H: He₂+ and He₂ same, more than He.

I: He₂+ and He same, less than He₂.

So my conclusion is that He is the most stable, He₂⁺ next, and He₂ the least. So looking for which option says He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂, but less than He. That's option B.

But wait, is He₂⁺ more stable than He? Because He is a single atom with no bonds, but He₂⁺ has a weak bond. Maybe the bond isn't strong enough to make it more stable than two He atoms. 

Alternatively, maybe He is more stable than He₂⁺ because He₂⁺ has a higher energy state than He. Because forming He₂⁺ requires ionization, which would take energy. So He would be more stable than He₂⁺.

So the correct order is He is more stable than He₂⁺, which is more stable than He₂.

Wait, but earlier I thought He₂ has no bond (bond order 0), so He₂ is not stable. So He₂⁺ has a bond order of 0.5, so it's more stable than He₂, but He is more stable than He₂⁺.

So that makes option B correct: He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ but less stable than He.

Wait, but let me double-check. If He₂ doesn't exist because the bond order is zero, then He₂ is not a stable molecule. So He is more stable than He₂. And He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ but less than He.

So the correct option is B.

To analyze the stability of He, He₂, and He₂⁺, we consider their bonding and molecular orbital configurations:

1. **He (Helium)**: As a noble gas, helium is monoatomic and has a completely filled 1s orbital, making it highly stable. It does not form bonds under normal conditions due to its stable electronic configuration.

2. **He₂ (Diatomic Helium)**: When two helium atoms come together, the molecular orbital configuration is (σ2s)²(σ*2s)². The bond order is calculated as (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons) / 2 = (2 - 2) / 2 = 0. This indicates that He₂ has no net bond and is essentially not a stable molecule under normal conditions.

3. **He₂⁺ (Diatomic Helium Ion)**: If He₂ loses one electron, the molecular orbital configuration becomes (σ2s)²(σ*2s)¹. The bond order is (2 - 1) / 2 = 0.5. This means He₂⁺ has a weak bond, making it more stable than He₂ but still less stable than the monoatomic He, which is in a highly stable state.

### Stability Comparison:
- **He** is the most stable due to its filled valence shell and lack of need for bonding.
- **He₂⁺** is more stable than He₂ because it has a weak bond (bond order = 0.5), whereas He₂ has no bond (bond order = 0).
- **He₂** is the least stable as it does not form a significant bond.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. He₂⁺ is not the most stable; He is more stable.
- **B**: Correct. He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂ but less stable than He.
- **C**: Incorrect. The stabilities are not the same; He is the most stable, followed by He₂⁺, and then He₂.
- **D**: Incorrect. He₂⁺ is not the least stable; He₂ is.
- **E**: Incorrect. He and He₂ do not have the same stability; He is more stable than He₂.
- **F**: Incorrect. He₂⁺ is not more stable than He.
- **G**: Incorrect. He₂⁺ is more stable than He₂.
- **H**: Incorrect. He₂⁺ and He₂ do not have the same stability; He₂⁺ is more stable.
- **I**: Incorrect. He₂⁺ and He do not have the same stability; He is more stable.

### Final Answer:
**B**
