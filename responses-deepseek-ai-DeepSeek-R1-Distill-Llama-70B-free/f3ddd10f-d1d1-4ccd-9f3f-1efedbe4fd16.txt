Okay, so I have this question about why we can do things like dressing or tying knots even when our eyes are closed. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to think through this.

The question is about the organs involved in seeing, but when our eyes are closed, we can still perform these manual tasks. So it's not about seeing, obviously. But then, how do we manage without visual input?

I remember that the eyes have photoreceptors like rods and cones, right? But that's for seeing, so when they're closed, those aren't helping. So the answer probably isn't B.

The options given are various types of receptors. Let me list them out to remember. There's gustatory (taste), photoreceptors (vision), auditory (hearing), proprioceptors, thermoreceptors (temperature), nociceptors (pain), mechanoreceptors (touch/pressure), chemoreceptors (like for blood gas levels?), olfactory (smell), and baroreceptors (blood pressure).

Wait, the question is about performing manual tasks without seeing. So maybe it's about feeling or sensing the position of our body parts. Oh right, there's a term called proprioception. Proprioceptors are sensors in muscles, tendons, and joints that help us sense the position and movement of our body parts. So even without looking, I can tell where my hands are and how to move them because of these proprioceptors.

So the correct answer should be D: Proprioceptors.

Let me think if any other options could make sense. Mechanoreceptors are involved in touch, like when you feel something. But in tasks like tying knots, it's not just about feeling the object, but also about knowing where your hands are in space. So mechanoreceptors might help with the touch part, but without knowing the position, you couldn't coordinate the movements. So proprioceptors are more about the body position, which is crucial for these tasks.

Another option is G: Mechanoreceptors. Wait, but I think mechanoreceptors are more about the skin and external touch, while proprioceptors are internal, helping with movement and balance. So tying knots requires both, maybe, but the main reason you can do it without seeing is because you know where your hands are, which is proprioception.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is D.

When our eyes are closed, we can still perform manual tasks like dressing or tying knots because of the role of **proprioceptors**. These are specialized sensors located in muscles, tendons, and joints that allow us to sense the position and movement of our body parts. This sense of proprioception enables us to coordinate our movements without visual input. While mechanoreceptors contribute to touch and feeling objects, proprioceptors are specifically responsible for our awareness of body positioning, which is crucial for these tasks. 

Answer: D
