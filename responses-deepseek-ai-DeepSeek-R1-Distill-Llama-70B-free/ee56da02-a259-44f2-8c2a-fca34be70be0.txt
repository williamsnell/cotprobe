Question:

A woman had spent many years converting her back yard to an authentic Japanese-style garden. Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman?

Options:

A: The distributor's performance was not excused because of impossibility, and the woman can recover damages.
B: The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit.
C: Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.
D: The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, and the woman cannot seek restitution.
E: The distributor's performance was excused because of the supervening illegality, but the woman can seek restitution.
F: The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution.
G: Both parties are excused from performance because of the impossibility, and neither can recover from the other.
H: Both parties are not excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and either can recover from the other.
I: The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the scenario is.

So, there's a woman who really wants a specific type of cymbidium orchid from Japan for her garden. She contacts a distributor who has connections in Japan. They make a contract where the distributor agrees to get the plant, ship it to the US, and plant it in her garden for $5,000. She pays $1,000 upfront, and the rest $4,000 when it's planted. 

But then, two weeks later, the US government bans importing cymbidiums because of these beetles that are harming citrus plants. The distributor can't get the plant anymore. Now, the question is about the legal relationship between them. Do either of them have to fulfill the contract, or is it excused?

Hmm, I remember that contract law has certain doctrines that can excuse performance. The main ones I can think of are impossibility, impracticability, and frustration of purpose. Also, supervening illegality might be a factor here.

So, the contract was to import a plant. But after the contract was made, the government made it illegal. That's a change in the law that affects the contract. I think that's called supervening illegality. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, though.

Wait, wasn't there a case where a contract became illegal after it was made, and the parties were excused from performing? I think that's when the law changes, making the contract's subject matter illegal. So, if the law makes it impossible to perform, then neither party can be held to the contract.

In this case, the distributor was supposed to import the cymbidium, but now it's banned. So, it's impossible for him to perform because it's against the law. But is that considered impossibility or supervening illegality?

Wait, another thought: impossibility typically refers to when an unforeseen event makes performance physically or commercially impossible. Like, if a specific item is destroyed and can't be obtained. But here, it's not that the plant was destroyed; it's that the law now prohibits importing it. So maybe it's more about supervening illegality.

I think the rule is that if a contract becomes illegal after it's formed, the obligation is excused. So both parties are off the hook. But wait, what about the money already paid? The woman paid $1,000. Can she get that back?

I remember something about restitution. If the contract is rescinded because of impossibility or illegality, the party who has partially performed (like the distributor who took the $1,000) might have to return any payments made, based on the doctrine of unjust enrichment. So the woman could seek restitution of the $1,000.

Looking at the options:

Option C says both are excused and neither can recover from each other. But that doesn't account for the $1,000. The woman should get her money back, right?

Option E says the distributor's performance is excused due to supervening illegality, and the woman can seek restitution. That sounds right.

Wait, another angle: impossibility vs. illegality. The plant isn't destroyed, so it's not impossibility in the traditional sense. It's the law that makes it impossible. So maybe it's supervening illegality, which is a specific type of impossibility. But I think the outcome is similarâ€”performance is excused.

So, the key points are: after the contract, a law made performance illegal. So the contract is discharged. Both parties don't have to perform. But the woman can get her money back because the distributor didn't deliver.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: Distributor's performance excused due to supervening illegality, woman can seek restitution.

Option C: Both excused, neither can recover. But that would mean the woman can't get her $1,000 back, which doesn't seem right.

Option D: Distributor excused due to impossibility, woman can't seek restitution. But she should be able to get her money back.

Option F: Distributor excused due to impossibility, woman can seek restitution. But wait, was it impossibility or illegality? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another thought: in contract law, when the performance becomes illegal, it's treated as a supervening event that discharges the contract. So the parties are excused from performing. But regarding restitution, the party who has received payment (distributor) must return it because the consideration (the plant) wasn't provided.

So, the correct answer should be that the distributor's performance is excused due to supervening illegality, and the woman can seek restitution of the $1,000.

Looking at the options, E matches that. Option E says exactly that.

Wait, but let me check other options again. Option C says both are excused and neither can recover. So that would mean no restitution, which I don't think is correct. The woman should get her money back.

Another option is option B, which talks about waiting until performance is due. But the issue is that performance is impossible, so she can probably sue immediately.

Hmm, so I think the correct answer is E.

The scenario involves a contract where a distributor agrees to import a cymbidium orchid from Japan for a woman, but the U.S. government subsequently bans the importation of cymbidiums due to concerns about a type of beetle. This makes performance impossible. The legal issue revolves around whether the distributor's performance is excused and whether the woman can seek restitution for the $1,000 she already paid.

Key considerations include the doctrines of supervening illegality and impossibility. Supervening illegality occurs when a change in the law after the contract is formed renders performance illegal. This typically excuses the parties from performing the contract. Additionally, the doctrine of restitution allows the recovery of payments made where the agreed-upon consideration (here, the cymbidium) cannot be provided due to the impossibility of performance.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** suggests both parties are excused, and neither can recover from the other. However, this does not account for the $1,000 payment, which the woman should be able to recover.
- **Option E** states that the distributor's performance is excused due to supervening illegality, and the woman can seek restitution. This aligns with the principles of contract law, as the ban on importation excuses performance, and the woman is entitled to recover her payment.
- Other options either misclassify the reason for excusal (e.g., impossibility instead of illegality) or fail to address restitution.

Thus, the correct answer is that the distributor's performance is excused due to supervening illegality, and the woman can seek restitution of the $1,000.

**Answer: E**
