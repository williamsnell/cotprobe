Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the minimum delta-v required to transfer a satellite from Earth's heliocentric orbit to Venus's orbit. Both orbits are circular and coplanar, and we only need to consider the Sun's gravity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on orbital mechanics, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that transferring between two circular orbits usually involves Hohmann transfer orbits. The Hohmann transfer is the most efficient way in terms of delta-v because it uses an elliptical orbit that touches both the initial and target circular orbits. So I guess I should use that approach.

The initial orbit is Earth's, which I'll call r_e, and the target is Venus's orbit, r_v. I need to find the delta-v required at both perihelion and aphelion of the transfer orbit. Wait, no, perihelion would be the lower orbit, so since Venus is closer to the Sun than Earth, the transfer orbit's perihelion is at Venus's radius, and aphelion at Earth's? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, when moving from Earth to Venus, which is a lower orbit, the transfer would require moving to a lower orbit, so perhaps the Hohmann transfer would have its perihelion at Venus's orbit and aphelion at Earth's. Hmm, I think that's correct.

Wait, no, wait. The Hohmann transfer to go from a higher orbit to a lower one would involve an elliptical orbit where the perihelion is the lower orbit (Venus) and the aphelion is the higher orbit (Earth). So the satellite is moving from Earth's orbit to the transfer orbit, then to Venus's orbit.

Now, I need to calculate the delta-v at both ends. The total delta-v is the sum of the changes needed at both points.

So, the delta-v required is the difference between the satellite's current velocity in Earth's orbit and the required velocity in the transfer orbit at Earth's position (aphelion of transfer), plus the difference between the transfer orbit's velocity at Venus's position (perihelion) and Venus's own circular orbit velocity.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me clarify: at the point where the satellite is in Earth's orbit, it's moving with Earth's orbital velocity. To enter the transfer orbit, it needs to slow down because the transfer orbit's speed at aphelion is lower than Earth's circular speed. Then, when it reaches Venus's orbit (the perihelion of the transfer), it needs to slow down further to match Venus's circular velocity. Wait, no, when moving to a lower orbit, you actually speed up. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Let's get back to the physics. In a circular orbit, the velocity is given by v = sqrt(G*M/a), where a is the semi-major axis. So for Earth, v_e = sqrt(G*M/r_e), and for Venus, v_v = sqrt(G*M/r_v). Since r_v < r_e, v_v > v_e. So Venus's orbital speed is higher than Earth's.

But in the Hohmann transfer, the transfer orbit has a semi-major axis a_t = (r_e + r_v)/2. The velocity at perihelion (r_v) is v_p = sqrt(G*M*(2/(r_e + r_v))) * r_v / a_t. Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the velocities at the perihelion and aphelion of the transfer orbit.

Alternatively, the velocity in the transfer orbit at aphelion (r_e) is v_a = sqrt(G*M*(2/(r_e + r_v)) * (1/r_e)). Wait, perhaps I can recall the velocities at the points of the transfer orbit.

The formula for the velocity at a point in an orbit is v = sqrt(G*M*(2/r - 1/a)), where r is the distance from the Sun, and a is the semi-major axis of the transfer orbit.

So, at Earth's orbit (r_e), which is the aphelion of the transfer orbit, the velocity would be v_a = sqrt(G*M*(2/r_e - 1/a_t)). Similarly, at Venus's orbit (r_v), the perihelion, v_p = sqrt(G*M*(2/r_v - 1/a_t)).

But because a_t is (r_e + r_v)/2, we can substitute that in.

So, let me write down the initial and final velocities.

Earth's orbital velocity: v_e = sqrt(G*M/r_e).
Venus's orbital velocity: v_v = sqrt(G*M/r_v).

Transfer orbit at r_e (aphelion): v_e_transfer = sqrt(G*M*(2/r_e - 2/(r_e + r_v))).

Similarly, at r_v (perihelion): v_v_transfer = sqrt(G*M*(2/r_v - 2/(r_e + r_v))).

Then, the delta-v at Earth is the change from v_e to v_e_transfer. Since the satellite is moving from Earth's orbit to the transfer orbit, it needs to decelerate, so delta-v1 = v_e_transfer - v_e. Wait, no, wait. When moving to a lower orbit, you have to slow down to enter the transfer orbit. Wait, no, wait—no, when you're in a higher orbit and want to move to a lower one, you need to decrease your velocity so that your orbit's perihelion drops to the lower orbit. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, let's think about it. If you're in Earth's orbit and you want to transfer to Venus's orbit, which is closer, you need to slow down. Because, in circular orbit, a lower orbit has a higher velocity, but when you're moving to a lower orbit via Hohmann, I think you have to slow down first to get into the transfer orbit. Wait no, maybe that's not correct. Let me think.

Wait, no. When you're in a circular orbit, if you want to go to a lower orbit, you perform a burn that decreases your velocity. This causes you to fall into an elliptical orbit with a lower perihelion. Wait, but in the case of Earth to Venus, since Venus is lower, you might actually have to increase your velocity? No, that doesn't make sense because Venus is closer, so it's moving faster. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of energy.

The specific orbital energy (epsilon) is given by epsilon = - G*M/(2a). So for Earth, epsilon_e = -G*M/(2 r_e), and for Venus, epsilon_v = -G*M/(2 r_v). The transfer orbit has a semi-major axis a_t = (r_e + r_v)/2, so epsilon_t = -G*M/(2 a_t) = -G*M/(r_e + r_v).

Wait, but the energy in the transfer orbit is higher (less negative) than Earth's orbit because a_t is larger than r_v but smaller than r_e. Wait, no, a_t is (r_e + r_v)/2. So if r_e is larger than r_v, then a_t is between r_v and r_e. So the energy of the transfer orbit is more than Earth's (since a_t is less than r_e; wait, no, wait: for circular orbits, a larger radius means higher energy (less negative). So Earth's orbit has higher energy than Venus's. The transfer orbit has a semi-major axis a_t between r_v and r_e, so its energy is between that of Venus and Earth.

Wait, but in any case, the delta-v is the change in velocity needed to go from Earth's circular orbit to the transfer orbit at Earth's radius. So, at r_e, the satellite is moving at v_e = sqrt(G*M/r_e). The transfer orbit at r_e has a velocity v_a = sqrt(G*M*(2/r_e - 1/a_t)).

So delta-v at Earth would be the difference between v_e and v_a. But wait, which is bigger? Let me compute v_a.

v_a = sqrt( G*M (2/r_e - 1/a_t) )

Since a_t = (r_e + r_v)/2, substituting:

v_a = sqrt( G*M [ 2/r_e - 2/(r_e + r_v) ] )

= sqrt( G*M [ 2 ( (r_e + r_v) - r_e ) ) / ( r_e (r_e + r_v) ) ) ] )

Wait, simplifying:

2/r_e - 2/(r_e + r_v) = 2 [ (r_e + r_v) - r_e ] / [ r_e (r_e + r_v) ) ]

= 2 [ r_v ] / [ r_e (r_e + r_v) ) ]

So,

v_a = sqrt( G*M * 2 r_v / ( r_e (r_e + r_v) ) )

Similarly, v_e = sqrt( G*M / r_e )

So let's compute the ratio v_a / v_e.

v_a^2 = G*M (2 r_v) / [ r_e (r_e + r_v) ) ]

v_e^2 = G*M / r_e

So (v_a/v_e)^2 = (2 r_v) / (r_e (r_e + r_v)) ) * r_e / 1 )

= 2 r_v / (r_e + r_v )

So v_a = v_e * sqrt( 2 r_v / (r_e + r_v) )

Similarly, let's compute that expression.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe a better approach is to compute the actual velocities.

Wait, let's get the actual values for Earth and Venus.

Earth's average orbital radius is about 1 AU, which is approximately 1.496e11 meters.

Venus's orbital radius is about 0.72 AU, so 0.72 * 1.496e11 m = approximately 1.077e11 meters.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait: 0.72 AU is 0.72 times 1.496e11 m, which is 0.72 * 1.496e11 = approx 1.077e11 m, yes.

So r_e = 1.496e11 m, r_v = 1.077e11 m.

Then a_t = (r_e + r_v)/2 = (1.496e11 + 1.077e11)/2 = (2.573e11)/2 = 1.2865e11 m.

Now compute v_e = sqrt( G*M / r_e )

G is 6.6743e-11 N·m²/kg².

M (Sun) is approx 1.989e30 kg.

So v_e = sqrt( (6.6743e-11) * (1.989e30) / 1.496e11 )

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute numerator: 6.6743e-11 * 1.989e30 = approx 1.327e20.

Then divide by 1.496e11: 1.327e20 / 1.496e11 ≈ 8.88e8.

Square root of that is approx 2.98e4 m/s, which is about 29.8 km/s, which matches Earth's orbital velocity.

Similarly, v_v = sqrt( G*M / r_v ) = sqrt(6.6743e-11 *1.989e30 / 1.077e11 )

Compute numerator: same as before, 1.327e20.

Divide by 1.077e11: 1.327e20 / 1.077e11 ≈ 1.232e9.

Square root: approx 3.51e4 m/s, which is about 35.1 km/s, which is correct for Venus.

Now, v_a is the velocity in the transfer orbit at r_e (aphelion). Let's compute v_a.

v_a = sqrt( G*M * (2/r_e - 1/a_t) )

Compute 2/r_e: 2 / 1.496e11 ≈ 1.338e-11 m^-1.

1/a_t: 1 / 1.2865e11 ≈ 7.778e-12 m^-1.

So 2/r_e - 1/a_t ≈ 1.338e-11 - 7.778e-12 = 5.602e-12 m^-1.

Multiply by G*M: 6.6743e-11 * 1.989e30 = 1.327e20.

So 1.327e20 * 5.602e-12 = approx 7.43e8.

Then sqrt(7.43e8) ≈ 2.726e4 m/s, which is about 27.26 km/s.

So delta-v1 is the change from Earth's velocity (29.78 km/s) to transfer velocity at aphelion (27.26 km/s). So delta-v1 = 27.26 - 29.78 = -2.52 km/s. But since delta-v is the magnitude of change, it's 2.52 km/s. Wait, but wait: the direction matters. Because when moving to a lower orbit, you have to slow down, so the delta-v is in the opposite direction of the velocity, so it's a deceleration. But in terms of magnitude, it's 2.52 km/s.

Wait, but actually, the transfer orbit's velocity at aphelion is lower than Earth's circular velocity, so to get into the transfer orbit, the spacecraft needs to slow down. So yes, the delta-v is 2.52 km/s in the opposite direction, but the magnitude is what we're considering here.

Then, at the perihelion of the transfer orbit (r_v), the velocity in the transfer orbit is v_p.

Compute v_p = sqrt( G*M (2/r_v - 1/a_t) )

So 2/r_v = 2 / 1.077e11 ≈ 1.858e-11 m^-1.

1/a_t = 7.778e-12 m^-1.

So 2/r_v - 1/a_t = 1.858e-11 - 7.778e-12 = 1.080e-11 m^-1.

Multiply by G*M: 1.327e20 * 1.080e-11 ≈ 1.433e9.

sqrt(1.433e9) ≈ 3.787e4 m/s, which is 37.87 km/s.

But Venus's circular velocity is 35.1 km/s, so to enter Venus's orbit, the spacecraft needs to slow down from 37.87 km/s to 35.1 km/s. So delta-v2 = 35.1 - 37.87 = -2.77 km/s. Again, the magnitude is 2.77 km/s.

So total delta-v is the sum of the two: 2.52 + 2.77 = 5.29 km/s.

Wait, but looking at the options given, the options are in m/s and go up to 7100 m/s (option B). Let me convert 5.29 km/s to m/s: 5.29e3 m/s, which is 5290 m/s. Hmm, that's not one of the options. Wait, looking at the options:

Options:

A:5800, B:7100, C:5600, D:4900, E:6500, F:4500, G:3000, H:5275, I:6000, J:3800.

Wait, option H is 5275 m/s, which is close to 5290. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

First, compute a_t = (r_e + r_v)/2.

r_e = 1 AU = 1.496e11 m.

r_v = 0.72 AU = 0.72 * 1.496e11 ≈ 1.077e11 m.

So a_t = (1.496e11 + 1.077e11)/2 = (2.573e11)/2 = 1.2865e11 m.

Now, compute v_e = sqrt(G*M/r_e).

G*M = 6.6743e-11 * 1.989e30 = approx 1.327e20.

v_e = sqrt(1.327e20 / 1.496e11) = sqrt(8.88e8) ≈ 2.98e4 m/s (29.8 km/s).

v_v = sqrt(G*M/r_v) = sqrt(1.327e20 / 1.077e11) = sqrt(1.232e9) ≈ 3.51e4 m/s (35.1 km/s).

Now, v_a = sqrt( G*M (2/r_e - 1/a_t) )

Compute 2/r_e: 2 / 1.496e11 ≈ 1.338e-11.

1/a_t: 1 / 1.2865e11 ≈ 7.778e-12.

So 2/r_e - 1/a_t = 1.338e-11 - 7.778e-12 = 5.602e-12.

v_a = sqrt(1.327e20 * 5.602e-12) = sqrt(7.43e8) ≈ 2726 m/s. Wait, wait, 7.43e8 is 743,000,000. The square root is approx 27,260 m/s. Oh wait, wait, no: 27,260 m/s is 27.26 km/s. Right.

So delta-v1 = 29,800 - 27,260 = 2,540 m/s.

Then, compute v_p at r_v.

v_p = sqrt( G*M (2/r_v - 1/a_t) )

2/r_v = 2 / 1.077e11 ≈ 1.858e-11.

1/a_t = 7.778e-12.

So 2/r_v - 1/a_t = 1.858e-11 - 7.778e-12 = 1.080e-11.

v_p = sqrt(1.327e20 * 1.080e-11) = sqrt(1.433e9) ≈ 37,870 m/s.

Venus's velocity is 35,100 m/s, so delta-v2 = 35,100 - 37,870 = -2,770 m/s. The magnitude is 2,770 m/s.

So total delta-v is 2,540 + 2,770 = 5,310 m/s.

Wait, that's 5,310 m/s. Looking at the options, option H is 5,275 m/s,
