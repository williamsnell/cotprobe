Okay, so I have this problem about Mr. Beame who put $400 in a bank that pays 3% interest compounded semiannually. I need to find out how much interest he earned after 2 years. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times over the periods. Since it's compounded semiannually, that means twice a year, right? So each year, the interest is added twice.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, the principal P is $400. The annual interest rate r is 3%, which as a decimal is 0.03. It's compounded semiannually, so n is 2. The time t is 2 years.

So plugging in the numbers:
A = 400 (1 + 0.03/2)^(2*2)
Let me compute the inside first. 0.03 divided by 2 is 0.015. Then, 2 times 2 is 4, so it's raised to the 4th power.

So (1 + 0.015) is 1.015. Now, I need to compute 1.015^4. Hmm, calculating exponents step by step might help.

1.015^2 is 1.015 * 1.015. Let me compute that. 1.015 * 1.015:
Multiplying 1 * 1.015 is 1.015. Then, 0.015 * 1.015 is 0.015225. Adding them together gives 1.030225. So 1.015 squared is 1.030225.

Now, I need to square that again because the exponent is 4. So (1.030225)^2. Let's compute that:
1.030225 * 1.030225. Hmm, that's a bit tricky without a calculator, but let's approximate. 

1.03 * 1.03 is 1.0609. But since it's 1.030225, it's a little more. Let me do it more accurately.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. Let's let a=1.03 and b=0.000225.

So (1.03 + 0.000225)^2 = (1.03)^2 + 2*(1.03)*(0.000225) + (0.000225)^2.
1.03 squared is 1.0609.
2 * 1.03 * 0.000225 is 2 * 0.00023175, which is 0.0004635.
And (0.000225)^2 is really small, like 0.000000050625, which is negligible.

Adding them together: 1.0609 + 0.0004635 = approximately 1.0613635. So 1.030225^2 ≈ 1.0613635.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, I could use a calculator approach step by step. Let me compute 1.015^4 accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as e^(4 * ln(1.015)). But that might not be necessary. Let's see, perhaps I can compute 1.015^4 step by step.

1.015^1 = 1.015
1.015^2 = 1.030225
1.015^3 = 1.030225 * 1.015. Let me calculate that:
1.030225 * 1.015. Multiply as if they are whole numbers:
1.030225 * 1.015 = ?
Breaking it down:
1.030225 * 1 = 1.030225
1.030225 * 0.01 = 0.01030225
1.030225 * 0.005 = 0.005151125
Adding them together: 1.030225 + 0.01030225 = 1.04052725 + 0.005151125 = 1.045678375.

So 1.015^3 ≈ 1.045678375.

Now, 1.015^4 = 1.045678375 * 1.015.

Let me compute that:
1.045678375 * 1.015.

Breaking it down again:
1.045678375 * 1 = 1.045678375
1.045678375 * 0.01 = 0.01045678375
1.045678375 * 0.005 = 0.005228419375

Adding them together: 1.045678375 + 0.01045678375 = 1.05613515875 + 0.005228419375 = 1.061363578125.

So 1.015^4 ≈ 1.061363578125.

So now, the amount A is 400 * 1.061363578125.

Calculating that: 400 * 1.061363578125.

I can compute 400 * 1.06 = 424. Then 400 * 0.001363578125.

Wait, 1.061363578125 is 1.06 + 0.001363578125. So:

400 * 1.06 = 400 * 1 + 400 * 0.06 = 400 + 24 = 424.

400 * 0.001363578125 = let's compute 0.001363578125 * 400.

0.001 * 400 = 0.4
0.000363578125 *400 = 0.14543125.

So 0.4 + 0.14543125 = 0.54543125.

Adding to 424 gives 424 + 0.54543125 = 424.54543125.

So the total amount after 2 years is approximately $424.5454.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 400 * 1.061363578125 directly.

400 * 1 = 400
400 * 0.061363578125 = ?

0.06 *400 =24
0.001363578125 *400=0.54543125

So 0.061363578125 *400 =24 +0.54543125=24.54543125

So total A is 400 +24.54543125=424.54543125. So yes, that seems correct.

Now, the interest earned is the amount minus the principal. So 424.5454 - 400 = 24.5454 approximately.

Looking at the options, option G is $24.54, which matches this calculation. So the interest is $24.54.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any errors in the exponent calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for compound interest again.

Another way: the formula is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)

P=400, r=3%=0.03, n=2, t=2.

So nt=4, and r/n=0.015.

So (1.015)^4=?

We calculated that as approximately 1.061363578. So 400 * 1.061363578= 424.5454.

So interest is 24.5454, which is about $24.54. So option G is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should check using another method. Let's compute it step by step, compounding each period.

Each compounding period is 6 months, so each period's interest is 1.5% (since 3% per year, semiannual is 1.5% per period).

So for each period, the amount is multiplied by 1.015.

Over 4 periods (2 years), the amounts would be:

Period 1: 400 *1.015= 406.0
Period 2: 406 *1.015= 412.09
Period 3: 412.09 *1.015= let's compute that: 412.09 *1.015.

412.09 + 412.09 *0.015.

0.015 *412.09 = 6.18135, so 412.09 +6.18135=418.27135.

Period 4: 418.27135 *1.015.

Compute 418.27135 *0.015 = let's see.

0.01 *418.27135=4.1827135
0.005*418.27135=2.09135675
Adding: 4.1827135 +2.09135675=6.27407025.

So 418.27135 +6.27407025=424.54542025.

Which is the same as before. So the final amount is $424.5454.

Thus, the interest is 424.5454 -400=24.5454, which is $24.54, so option G.
</think>

To calculate the interest Mr. Beame earned after 2 years with $400 invested at 3% annual interest compounded semiannually, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 400 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.03 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 2 \) (compounded semiannually),
- \( t = 2 \) (time in years).

First, calculate the growth factor:

\[
1 + \frac{r}{n} = 1 + \frac{0.03}{2} = 1.015
\]

The total number of compounding periods is:

\[
nt = 2 \times 2 = 4
\]

Now, raise \( 1.015 \) to the power of 4:

\[
1.015^4 \approx 1.061363578
\]

Finally, calculate the total amount \( A \):

\[
A = 400 \times 1.061363578 \approx 424.5454
\]

The interest earned is the total amount minus the principal:

\[
\text{Interest} = A - P = 424.5454 - 400 = 24.5454
\]

Thus, the interest earned is approximately **$24.54**, which corresponds to option **G**.
