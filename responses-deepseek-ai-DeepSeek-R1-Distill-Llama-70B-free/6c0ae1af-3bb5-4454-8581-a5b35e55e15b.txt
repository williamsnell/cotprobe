Question:

A 54-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of fainting for 3 months. He also has had difficulty performing daily tasks because he is easily fatigued. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I
B: Left bundle branch block
C: Ventricular fibrillation
D: Third-degree atrioventricular block
E: Supraventricular tachycardia
F: Myocardial infarction
G: Right bundle branch block
H: First-degree atrioventricular block
I: Sinus bradycardia
J: Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II

Okay, so I need to figure out this medical question. Let's start by reading the problem carefully.

The patient is a 54-year-old man with episodes of fainting for three months and easy fatigue. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His vital signs are pulse 40/min, respirations 18, BP 138/85. Physical exam shows cannon a waves. The ECG shows P-wave rate 90/min, R-wave rate 40/min, and no relation between P and R waves.

Hmm, let me break this down. The fainting and fatigue could be due to a slow heart rate or poor cardiac output. His pulse is 40, which is bradycardia. Bradycardia can cause these symptoms.

He's had a previous MI, which might have caused some heart damage, possibly affecting the conduction system. So maybe he has some kind of heart block.

Looking at the ECG details: P-wave rate is 90, R-wave is 40. So atria are firing at 90 beats per minute, but the ventricles only 40. And there's no apparent relation between P and R waves. That makes me think there's a block in the electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles.

Cannon a waves are seen in the jugular venous pulse. They occur when the atria contract against a closed tricuspid valve. That happens when the atria and ventricles are out of sync, like in complete heart block or certain arrhythmias.

So the ECG shows P waves at 90 and R waves at 40. That suggests that the atria are depolarizing normally, but the ventricles are not responding in a 1:1 fashion. In fact, the ratio here is 90:40, which is about 9:4, but that's not a fixed ratio. If the block is third-degree, there's no association between P and R waves, which matches the description here.

Third-degree AV block (also called complete heart block) is when the electrical signals between the atria and ventricles are completely blocked. So the atria beat at their own rate (P-wave rate 90), and the ventricles have an escape rhythm, which is slower (R-wave rate 40). There's no connection between them, so they're independent.

So looking at the options:

Option D is third-degree AV block. That fits.

Other options:

A: Second-degree type I (Wenckebach) has progressive prolongation of PR intervals until a P is blocked. ECG would show some relation between P and QRS, but maybe with a pattern.

B: Left bundle branch block affects the QRS complex, making it wider, but the P and R rates would be the same.

J: Second-degree type II is when some P waves are not followed by QRS, but the PR intervals are constant when conducted. But in the question, there's no apparent relation, which suggests no association.

So the key here is that in third-degree AV block, there's no relation between P and QRS. So the diagnosis should be D.

The patient is a 54-year-old man with episodes of fainting, fatigue, and a history of myocardial infarction. His pulse is 40/min, and the ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Physical examination reveals cannon a waves, which are indicative of atrial contractions against a closed tricuspid valve, often seen in complete heart block.

The ECG findings suggest that the atria and ventricles are beating independently, with no electrical communication between them. This is characteristic of third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, where the atria depolarize at their own rate (90/min), and the ventricles follow an escape rhythm (40/min). The absence of any relationship between the P waves and R waves further supports this diagnosis.

Other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **A (Second-degree AV block, type I)**: This involves progressive prolongation of PR intervals until a P wave is blocked, which is not described here.
- **B (Left bundle branch block)**: This affects the QRS complex but does not explain the independent atrial and ventricular rates.
- **J (Second-degree AV block, type II)**: This involves intermittent blocking of P waves with constant PR intervals when conducted, which is not consistent with the "no apparent relation" described.
- **D (Third-degree AV block)**: Fits the clinical and ECG findings perfectly, as it involves complete blockage of electrical signals between the atria and ventricles.

Thus, the most likely diagnosis is **third-degree atrioventricular block**.

Answer: D
