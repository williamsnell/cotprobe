Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about length contraction in special relativity. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, they experience length contraction in the direction of motion from the observer's perspective.

Alright, the problem says: A rod measures 1.00 m in its rest system. How fast must an observer move parallel to the rod to measure its length to be 0.80 m? The options are from A to J, each a multiple of 0. something times c.

Wait, so the proper length (L0) is 1.00 meters. The observed length (L) is 0.80 m. I think the formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or was it L = L0 / gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor? Oh right, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so L = L0 / gamma would be the same as L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the equation I need is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). I can plug in the numbers I have. Let's write that down.

L = 0.80 m
L0 = 1.00 m

So,

0.80 = 1.00 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Divide both sides by 1.00, which doesn't change anything. So,

0.80 = sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Now I can square both sides to get rid of the square root.

(0.80)^2 = 1 - v²/c²
0.64 = 1 - v²/c²

Then, rearrange the equation:

v²/c² = 1 - 0.64
v²/c² = 0.36

Take the square root of both sides:

v/c = sqrt(0.36)
v/c = 0.6

So, v = 0.6c.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E is 0.60c. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Sometimes I mix up the formulas. Oh right, Lorentz contraction formula is correct. The observer is moving relative to the rod, so the rod's length is contracted. So yes, when the observer moves at 0.6c relative to the rod, the length is 0.8 times the proper length.

Another way to think: if the rod is moving at 0.6c relative to the observer, then the observer measures the length as shorter. So the speed is positive, and that fits with the calculation.

So I'm confident the answer is E.

To determine how fast an observer must move parallel to a rod to measure its length as 0.80 m when the rod's proper length is 1.00 m, we use the length contraction formula from special relativity:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( L_0 = 1.00 \, \text{m} \) (proper length of the rod),
- \( L = 0.80 \, \text{m} \) (observed length),
- \( v \) is the relative velocity between the observer and the rod,
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

Substituting the known values:

\[
0.80 = 1.00 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Divide through by 1.00:

\[
0.80 = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Square both sides:

\[
0.64 = 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36
\]

Take the square root of both sides:

\[
\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{0.36} = 0.6
\]

Thus:

\[
v = 0.6c
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **E: 0.60c**.
