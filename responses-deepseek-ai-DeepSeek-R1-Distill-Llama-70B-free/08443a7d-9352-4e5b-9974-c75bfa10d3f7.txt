Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about heat conduction through a copper kettle's bottom. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question gives me some specific details. The kettle's bottom is circular with a diameter of 6.0 inches and a thickness of 0.062 inches. It's placed over a gas flame. The average temperature of the outer copper surface is 214°F, and the water inside is boiling normally, which I think is 212°F. So the temperature difference is 214 - 212 = 2°F. That seems small, but maybe it's enough.

They also mention the thermal conductivity of copper is 2480 Btu/(ft²·hr·°F/in). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, I think it's Btu per square foot per hour per degree Fahrenheit per inch. Or maybe I should double-check the units. Oh right, because thermal conductivity (k) has units, and in this case, it's given as 2480 Btu/(ft²·h·°F/in). So the units are a bit tricky here.

The question is asking how much heat is conducted through the bottom in 5.0 seconds. Okay, so I need to calculate the heat transfer (Q) over time.

I remember the formula for heat conduction is Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / d. Where:

- Q is the heat conducted,
- k is the thermal conductivity,
- A is the area,
- ΔT is the temperature difference,
- t is the time,
- d is the thickness (or the distance the heat travels through the material).

Wait, let me make sure I have the formula right. Oh, right, the formula is Q = (k * A * (T2 - T1) * t) / d. So yeah, that's correct.

First, I need to calculate the area A. The bottom is circular with a diameter of 6 inches. So radius is 3 inches. Area is πr². Let me compute that:

r = 6 in / 2 = 3 in. Area A = π*(3)^2 = 9π square inches. But wait, the units for k are in feet, so I need to convert the area into square feet.

Hmm, 1 foot is 12 inches. So 1 square foot is (12 in)^2 = 144 in². So 9π in² is 9π / 144 = π/16 square feet. Let me approximate π as 3.1416, so π/16 ≈ 0.19635 ft². 

Wait, but hold on, because the thickness is given in inches, and the thermal conductivity is in ft², so maybe I should convert everything into consistent units. Let me outline all the steps again:

1. Calculate the area in square feet.
2. Calculate the temperature difference in °F.
3. Convert time into hours because the thermal conductivity is per hour.
4. Plug everything into the formula.

So, let's go step by step.

Area A: diameter is 6 inches, radius 3 inches.
A = π*(3 in)^2 = 9π in².
Convert to ft²: since 1 ft = 12 in, 1 in = 1/12 ft. So 3 in = 0.25 ft. So A = π*(0.25 ft)^2 = π*(0.0625) ft² ≈ 0.19635 ft².

Wait, no. Wait, 3 inches is 0.25 ft, so the radius is 0.25 ft. So area is π*(0.25)^2 = π*(0.0625) = approx 0.19635 ft². That's correct.

Temperature difference, ΔT: 214°F - 212°F = 2°F. That's straightforward.

Time is 5.0 seconds. Oh wait, the thermal conductivity is per hour, so I need to convert 5 seconds into hours. 

5 seconds = 5/(60*60) hours. Because 1 minute is 60 seconds, 1 hour is 60 minutes. So 5/(3600) ≈ 0.0013889 hours.

Thickness d is 0.062 inches. But since the other units are in feet, I should convert this to feet. 0.062 inches is 0.062/12 feet. Because 1 foot is 12 inches. 0.062 /12 = 0.0051667 feet. Wait, actually, no: wait, 1 inch is 1/12 ft, so 0.062 inches is 0.062 * (1/12) ft = 0.062/12 ≈ 0.0051667 ft.

Thermal conductivity k is 2480 Btu/(ft²·h·°F/in). Wait, that's an unusual unit. Oh, wait, no, wait, perhaps it's per inch? Because the formula uses thickness in inches? Or is the unit in terms of per inch? Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, the units for thermal conductivity can be expressed in various ways. The standard unit is Btu·in/(h·ft²·°F), but in this problem, it's given as 2480 Btu/(ft²·h·°F/in). So perhaps that's Btu per (ft²·h·°F·in). So when using the formula, the units would work out correctly.

Wait, let me think about the formula again. Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / d. The units of each term:

- k: Btu/(ft²·h·°F·in)
- A: ft²
- ΔT: °F
- t: h
- d: in

So when you multiply k * A * ΔT * t, the units become (Btu/(ft²·h·°F·in)) * ft² * °F * h. So the ft² cancels, °F cancels, h cancels, leaving Btu/(in). Then you divide by d (in inches), so the in in the denominator and the d (in inches) will cancel, leaving Btu.

Yes, that makes sense. So the formula will give Q in Btu.

So putting it all together:

Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / d

Plugging the numbers in:

k = 2480 Btu/(ft²·h·°F·in)
A ≈ 0.19635 ft²
ΔT = 2 °F
t = 5 sec = 5/(3600) h ≈ 0.0013889 h
d = 0.062 in

So let's compute each part:

First, multiply A and ΔT: 0.19635 * 2 = 0.3927.

Then multiply by t: 0.3927 * 0.0013889 ≈ 0.0005444.

Multiply by k: 2480 * 0.0005444 ≈ let's compute that.

2480 * 0.0005444. Let me do it step by step.

2480 * 0.0005 = 1.24. Because 0.0005 is 5e-4. 2480 *5e-4 = (2480 *5)/10000 = 12400 /10000=1.24.

Now, 0.0005444 is 0.0005 + 0.0000444.

So 2480 * 0.0000444 = ?

Well, 0.00004 is 4e-5. 2480 *4e-5 = (2480 *4)/100000 = 9920 / 1e5 = 0.0992.

And 0.0000044 is another 2480 *4.4e-6 = (2480 *4.4)/1e6. 2480*4=9920; 2480*0.4=992; so 9920+992=10912. 10912 /1e6=0.010912.

Wait, maybe an easier way is to compute 2480 * 0.0000444 = ?

0.0000444 is 4.44e-5.

So 2480 * 4.44e-5 = (2480 *4.44) / 1e5

2480 *4 = 9920
2480 *0.44= 2480*(0.4 +0.04)=992 +99.2=1091.2
So total is 9920 +1091.2 = 11011.2

Now divide by 1e5: 11011.2 /1e5 = 0.110112.

So 2480 * 0.0000444 ≈ 0.110112.

So the total from the 0.0005444 is approx 1.24 + 0.110112 = 1.350112.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original 0.0005444 is 0.0005 + 0.0000444, so when multiplied by 2480 gives us 1.24 (from 0.0005) plus 0.110112 (from 0.0000444), so total is 1.350112.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 2480 * 0.0005444 directly.

Let me compute 2480 * 0.0005444.

First, 2480 * 0.0005 = 1.24.

2480 * 0.0000444 = 0.110112, as before.

So total is 1.24 + 0.110112 ≈ 1.350112.

So now, that's (k * A * ΔT * t) = 1.350112.

Now, divide by d, which is 0.062 in.

So Q = 1.350112 / 0.062 ≈ let's compute that.

1.350112 ÷ 0.062.

Hmm. Let me calculate: 0.062 times 21 is 1.302. 0.062 *21=1.302. The number we have is 1.350112, which is 1.350112-1.302=0.048112 more than 21 times.

So 0.048112 / 0.062 ≈ 0.7758.

So total is 21 + 0.7758 ≈ 21.7758.

So Q ≈ 21.78 Btu.

Looking at the options, the choices are A:15, B:25, C:28, D:20, E:30, F:18, G:24, H:32, I:22, J:26.

So 21.78 is closest to 22, which is option I.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the steps.

Wait, let me recalculate the area. Oh wait, another approach: perhaps if I made a mistake in converting inches to feet.

Wait, the diameter is 6 inches. So radius is 3 inches. So area in square inches is π*(3)^2=9π in². To convert to square feet, since 1ft=12in, 1 square foot is 144 in². So 9π/144 = π/16 ≈ 0.19635 ft². That seems correct.

Time: 5 seconds is 5/(3600) hours ≈ 0.0013889 hours. Correct.

Thermal conductivity k is 2480 Btu/(ft²·h·°F·in). So when I plug into the formula, Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / d.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second, when I multiplied 2480 by 0.0005444, I got approximately 1.35. Then divided by 0.062, got 21.7758.

But let me compute 2480 * 0.0005444 more accurately.

0.0005444 = 5.444e-4.

So 2480 * 5.444e-4.

Let me compute 2480 * 5.444e-4 = 2480 * 5.444 / 10000.

Compute 2480 *5= 12400.

2480 *0.444= let's see, 2480*0.4=992, 2480*0.04=99.2, 2480*0.004=9.92.

So 0.4+0.04+0.004=0.444, so 992 + 99.2 +9.92= 1101.12.

So total is 12400 + 1101.12 = 13501.12.

Wait, no. Wait, 5.444 is 5 + 0.444. So 2480*5 =12400, 2480*0.444=1100.112.

So total 12400 + 1100.112 = 13500.112.

Wait, but wait, no: 2480 *5.444 is 2480*(5 + 0.444) = 2480*5 + 2480*0.444.

Which is 12400 + 1100.112 = 13500.112.

Then, 13500.112 / 10000 = 1.3500112.

So yes, that's correct. So 1.3500112 when divided by 0.062 is approx 21.7758 Btu.

Which is approximately 21.78 Btu, so closest to 22, option I.

Wait, but let me check if I missed any conversion factors. Hmm, perhaps I should check the units again.

Wait, the formula is Q = (k*A*ΔT*t)/d.

k is in Btu/(ft²·h·°F·in), A is in ft², ΔT in °F, t in h, d in inches.

So when multiplied, the units are:

(Btu/(ft²·h·°F·in)) * ft² * °F * h / in.

So ft² cancels, °F cancels, h cancels, in (from denominator) and in (from d) cancel, leaving Btu. So units are correct.

Yes, so the calculation should be correct. So the answer is I:22 Btu.
</think>

To calculate the heat conducted through the copper kettle's bottom, we use the formula for heat conduction:

\[
Q = \frac{k \cdot A \cdot \Delta T \cdot t}{d}
\]

Where:
- \( k \) is the thermal conductivity of copper, given as \( 2480 \, \text{Btu/(ft}^2 \cdot \text{h} \cdot ^\circ \text{F} \cdot \text{in)} \),
- \( A \) is the area of the circular bottom,
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference,
- \( t \) is the time in hours,
- \( d \) is the thickness of the copper bottom.

### Step 1: Calculate the area \( A \)
The diameter of the circular bottom is \( 6.0 \, \text{in} \), so the radius is \( 3.0 \, \text{in} \). The area in square inches is:

\[
A = \pi r^2 = \pi (3.0)^2 = 9\pi \, \text{in}^2
\]

Convert \( A \) to square feet (\( 1 \, \text{ft}^2 = 144 \, \text{in}^2 \)):

\[
A = \frac{9\pi}{144} = \frac{\pi}{16} \approx 0.19635 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

### Step 2: Determine the temperature difference \( \Delta T \)
The temperature of the outer surface of the copper is \( 214^\circ \text{F} \), and the boiling water is at \( 212^\circ \text{F} \). Thus:

\[
\Delta T = 214 - 212 = 2^\circ \text{F}
\]

### Step 3: Convert time \( t \) to hours
The time is given as \( 5.0 \, \text{seconds} \). Convert to hours (\( 1 \, \text{hour} = 3600 \, \text{seconds} \)):

\[
t = \frac{5.0}{3600} \approx 0.001389 \, \text{hours}
\]

### Step 4: Convert thickness \( d \) to feet
The thickness of the copper is \( 0.062 \, \text{in} \). Convert to feet (\( 1 \, \text{ft} = 12 \, \text{in} \)):

\[
d = \frac{0.062}{12} \approx 0.005167 \, \text{ft}
\]

### Step 5: Plug values into the formula
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
Q = \frac{k \cdot A \cdot \Delta T \cdot t}{d}
\]

\[
Q = \frac{2480 \cdot 0.19635 \cdot 2 \cdot 0.001389}{0.005167}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2480 \cdot 0.19635 \cdot 2 \cdot 0.001389 \approx 1.350
\]

Now divide by \( d \):

\[
Q = \frac{1.350}{0.005167} \approx 21.78 \, \text{Btu}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated heat conducted through the bottom of the kettle is approximately \( 21.78 \, \text{Btu} \), which is closest to option **I: 22 Btu**.
