Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about the acceleration due to gravity at a certain distance from the center of the Earth. Hmm, I remember that gravity decreases as you move further away from the Earth. The question is asking at what distance the acceleration due to gravity is half of what it is on the Earth's surface. 

Alright, I think I should start by recalling the formula for gravitational acceleration. I remember that near the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is g, which is approximately 9.8 m/s². But when you're at a distance r from the center, the formula changes. Oh right, Newton's law of universal gravitation says that the gravitational force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. So the acceleration, which is the force per unit mass on a test object, would be inversely proportional to r squared.

So the formula for acceleration due to gravity at a distance r is a = G*M/r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and r is the distance from the center.

On the Earth's surface, the acceleration is g = G*M/(R²), where R is the Earth's radius. So when we're at some distance r, the acceleration a is (G*M)/(r²) = (g R²)/r². 

The problem states that a is half of g, so (g R²)/(r²) = 0.5 g. Wait, the g cancels out, so R²/r² = 0.5. That means r² = 2 R², right? Taking the square root of both sides, r = R * sqrt(2). Because sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so r is about 1.414 times the Earth's radius.

Now I need to find the Earth's radius. I think the Earth's average radius is about 6.37 million meters, 6.37 × 10^6 m. So multiplying that by 1.414 gives me the distance from the center.

Let me calculate that. 6.37e6 m * 1.414. Let's see, 6 times 1.414 is about 8.484, and 0.37 * 1.414 is approximately 0.523. Adding them together gives roughly 9.007 × 10^6 meters. Hmm, wait, does that make sense? Because 6.37 * 1.414 is exactly what I need. Maybe it's better to compute it accurately.

Wait, 6.37 * 1.414. Let's compute 6 * 1.414 = 8.484, 0.37 * 1.414. Let me do 0.3 * 1.414 = 0.4242, 0.07 * 1.414=0.09998. Adding those, 0.4242 + 0.09998 = 0.52418. So total is 8.484 + 0.52418 = 9.00818. So approximately 9.008 × 10^6 meters.

Looking at the options, let me check each one:

Option D is 9.02 ×10^6 meters. That matches my calculation. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning. The formula I used was correct? Yes, because when you're at a distance r from the center, the gravitational acceleration is inversely proportional to r squared. So setting a = 0.5 g gives r = sqrt(2) R. 

Yes, I think that's right. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the distance from the center of the Earth where the acceleration due to gravity is half its value on the surface, we start with the formula for gravitational acceleration:

\[
a = \frac{G M}{r^2}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the Earth's mass, and \( r \) is the distance from the center of the Earth. On the Earth's surface, the acceleration is \( g = \frac{G M}{R^2} \), where \( R \) is the Earth's radius. At a distance \( r \), the acceleration becomes:

\[
a = \frac{g R^2}{r^2}
\]

The problem states that \( a = 0.5 g \), so:

\[
\frac{g R^2}{r^2} = 0.5 g
\]

Canceling \( g \) and rearranging gives:

\[
r^2 = 2 R^2 \quad \text{or} \quad r = R \sqrt{2}
\]

The Earth's radius is approximately \( R = 6.37 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \). Substituting this value:

\[
r = 6.37 \times 10^6 \times \sqrt{2}
\]

Since \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), we calculate:

\[
r \approx 6.37 \times 10^6 \times 1.414 = 9.008 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}
\]

This matches option D, \( 9.02 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \).
