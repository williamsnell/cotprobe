Okay, so I've got this insurance question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

Mr. Green is 35 and bought a new car. The car's symbol is 5, and it's kept in territory 06. He had one accident in the last three years. He's using the new car for business. The question is about the cost difference between a $50 deductible and a $100 deductible for collision insurance.

Hmm, I remember that deductibles affect the insurance premium. Usually, a higher deductible means lower premiums because the insured takes on more risk. But I'm not exactly sure how much the difference would be in this specific case.

I think I need to recall how insurance rates are calculated. Maybe there's a base rate for the car, and then adjustments based on territory, driving record, etc. Oh wait, the question doesn't give specific rates, so maybe it's referring to a standard calculation or a common practice.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the difference is based on the deductible levels. Like, the change from $50 to $100 deductible might reduce the premium by a certain percentage or a fixed amount. I'm not sure of the exact figures, though.

I remember that sometimes the insurance cost difference between deductibles can be around $20 to $40 per year, but I'm not certain. Let me think. If the deductible increases by $50, maybe the premium goes down by a certain amount. Like, for each $100 increase in deductible, the premium might drop by, say, $30 or $40.

Wait, but the options are A through J, and the possible answers are $65, $60, etc. So maybe the difference is $50? Or $40? Let me think about the factors that influence this.

Mr. Green's age is 35, which is probably considered a lower risk than a younger driver. The car symbol is 5, but I'm not sure how symbols translate to insurance costs. Territory 06â€”different territories have different rates based on accident rates, theft rates, etc. But again, without specific data, I can't calculate the exact impact.

He had one accident in three years, so that might increase his premium. But since the question is about the deductible difference, maybe the accident affects the base premium, but not the deductible difference. 

Wait, the question is about the difference in cost between the two deductibles. So regardless of other factors, the difference would be the same. So if the $50 deductible costs more than the $100, the difference is how much less the $100 deductible costs.

I think the key is that higher deductibles lower the premium. So the cost difference would be the amount saved by choosing the higher deductible.

But without the exact premium rates, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe the answer is a standard $30 or $40. Looking at the options, E is $25, I is $30, F is $40.

Alternatively, maybe the difference is $50. Because $100 minus $50 is $50, but that's the deductible, not the cost. The cost difference would be less. Because the higher deductible reduces the premium, but not by the full amount of the deductible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. Let's say the insurance company's cost for a $50 deductible is higher because they're taking on more risk. So when you increase the deductible, your premium goes down. The amount it goes down by is the difference.

But without knowing the exact rate, it's hard. Maybe the question expects me to know that the difference is typically around $30 or $40. Looking at the options, I think I've heard that a $50 increase in deductible might save around $40 per year. So perhaps the cost difference is $40, which is option F.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the difference is $30, which is option I.

Alternatively, some sources say that increasing the deductible by $50 could save about $20-$30. So maybe the answer is $25, which is option E.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: Let's say the base premium with $50 deductible is X. With $100, it's Y. The difference is X - Y. Typically, for collision coverage, each $100 increase in deductible might reduce the premium by about $20 to $40. So for a $50 increase (from 50 to 100), maybe the saving is $30. So the difference would be $30, which is option I.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another way is to recall if the standard difference is $50. But I think the correct answer is around $30. So I'll go with option I: $30.

The question involves determining the cost difference between $50 and $100 deductibles for collision insurance for Mr. Green, who uses his new car for business. Key factors include the car's symbol (5), territory (06), and Mr. Green's driving history (one accident in three years). 

Deductibles typically affect insurance premiums inversely: higher deductibles lower premiums because the insured assumes more risk. The exact cost difference depends on how much the premium decreases when switching from a $50 to a $100 deductible. While specific rates aren't provided, it's reasonable to estimate that the difference could range between $20 to $40 annually. 

Considering standard practices, a $50 increase in deductible might reduce the premium by approximately $30. Among the options, $30 (option I) aligns with this reasoning.

I: $30

Answer: I
