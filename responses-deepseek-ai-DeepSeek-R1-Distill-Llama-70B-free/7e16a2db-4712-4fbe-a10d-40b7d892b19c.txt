Okay, so I've got this problem here about producing sulfur-35 from chlorine using neutron irradiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we have a 1-cm cube of carbon tetrachloride, which is CCl4. The mass is given as 1.46 grams. The reaction provided is Chlorine-35 (^35_17Cl) reacting with a neutron to produce Sulfur-35 (^35_16S) and a hydrogen atom (^1_1H). The neutron flux is 10^9 cm^-2 sec^-1, and it's directed normally to one face of the sample. The absorption cross-section for chlorine is 33.8 barns, but the isotopic cross-section for the specific reaction is 0.19 barn. We need to calculate the number of ^35S atoms formed in 24 hours.

Wait, first, what's a barn? Oh right, a barn is a unit of area, 1e-24 cm². So cross-sections are in barns.

I think the approach here is to calculate the number of neutrons absorbed by the sample over time, which will determine the number of reactions, and thus the number of sulfur-35 atoms produced.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the number of chlorine atoms in the sample.
2. Determine the volume of the sample to find the number of target nuclei per cm³ (number density).
3. Use the neutron flux to find the neutron-induced reaction rate, considering the cross-section.
4. Multiply by time to get total reactions.

Wait, perhaps an alternative way is to compute the total number of targets (chlorine atoms), then find the reaction rate per second, then over 24 hours.

But wait, let me think. The neutron flux is given as 10^9 cm^-2 s^-1, normal to one face. But the sample is a cube of 1 cm, so it's 1 cm³. Wait, no, the flux is per square centimeter, so the sample's area matters. Hmm, maybe I should compute the total number of neutrons passing through the sample per second.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the effective area the flux is passing through. Since the flux is per cm², and the sample is 1 cm in each dimension. So the cross-sectional area is 1 cm². So the number of neutrons passing through per second is flux (n/cm²/s) multiplied by area (cm²). So 1e9 neutrons/s per cm² times 1 cm² gives 1e9 neutrons per second.

But wait, the sample is a cube, so the flux is through one face. So that's correct. So the total neutron flux through the sample is 1e9 neutrons per second.

Now, each neutron has a chance to interact with a chlorine nucleus. The reaction rate depends on the number of targets (chlorine atoms), the flux (neutrons/cm²/s), and the cross-section (cm²). So the formula for reactions per second is φ * N * σ, where φ is flux, N is number of targets, and σ is cross-section.

Wait, but σ is in barns, which is 1e-24 cm². So I need to convert that.

Wait, the cross-section given for the specific reaction is 0.19 barns. So maybe it's the cross-section for that particular reaction, not the total absorption. So the problem states that the total absorption cross-section for Cl is 33.8 barns, but the reaction's cross-section is 0.19 barn. So we use 0.19 barns for the calculation.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the number of moles of CCl4.
   Molar mass of CCl4 is 12.01 (C) + 4 * 35.45 (Cl) ≈ 12 + 141.8 = 153.8 g/mol.
   Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.46 g / 153.8 g/mol ≈ 0.00948 mol.

2. Each mole of CCl4 has 4 moles of Cl atoms. So moles of Cl = 0.00948 * 4 ≈ 0.0379 mol.

3. Number of Cl atoms = moles * Avogadro's number (6.022e23 atoms/mol).
   So 0.0379 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.28e22 atoms.

Wait, wait. Wait, the sample is a 1 cm³ cube. So the volume is 1 cm³. So the number of Cl atoms per cm³ is the total number divided by 1 cm³, so number density is 2.28e22 atoms/cm³.

But wait, actually, the sample volume is 1 cm³, so N (number of Cl atoms) is 2.28e22. So the total number of targets is 2.28e22.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the entire sample is 1 cm³, so the number of Cl atoms is that 2.28e22. So N is 2.28e22.

Now, the reaction rate R is given by R = φ * N * σ.

But wait, phi is per cm² per second. So what is the relation? Let me think. The flux phi is the number of neutrons passing through a cm² per second. The cross-section sigma is the effective area per target nucleus. So the reaction rate R is phi * N * sigma.

Wait, but wait, the formula is R = φ * N * σ. But the units need to check out.

Phi has units of neutrons/(cm²·s). Sigma is cm². N is number of targets. So R has units (neutrons/cm²/s) * (targets) * cm² = targets/s.

Yes, that makes sense. So each second, R targets are reacting.

So let's compute R:

Phi = 1e9 neutrons/(cm²·s)
Sigma = 0.19 barn = 0.19e-24 cm².
N = 2.28e22 atoms.

So R = 1e9 * 2.28e22 * 0.19e-24.

Let me compute that.

Compute each part step by step.

First, 1e9 * 2.28e22 = 2.28e31.

Then, 2.28e31 * 0.19e-24 = 2.28 * 0.19 * 1e7.

Wait, 0.19e-24 is 1.9e-25.

Wait, wait, 0.19e-24 = 1.9e-25.

Wait, 0.19 * 1e-24 = 1.9e-25.

So 2.28e22 * 0.19e-24 = 2.28 * 0.19 * 1e-2.

Wait, 2.28e22 * 0.19e-24 = 2.28 * 0.19 * 1e(22-24) )= 2.28*0.19 *1e-2 = (0.4332)*0.01= 0.004332.

Then multiplied by phi =1e9:

R= 1e9 * 0.004332 = 4.332e6 reactions per second.

Wait wait, wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, R = phi * N * sigma

= (1e9 neutrons/cm²/s) * (2.28e22 atoms) * (0.19e-24 cm²)

Compute the exponents first: 1e9 * 1e22 * 1e-24 = 1e(9+22-24)=1e7.

Then the coefficients: 1 * 2.28 * 0.19 = 0.4332.

So R = 0.4332 * 1e7 = 4.332e6 reactions per second.

Wait, that's 4.332e6 per second. Now we need to find the total number over 24 hours.

24 hours is 24 * 3600 seconds = 86400 seconds.

So total reactions = 4.332e6 * 86400 = ?

Compute that:

4.332e6 = 4,332,000

Multiply by 86,400:

Let me compute 4,332,000 * 86,400.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me compute in exponents:

4.332e6 * 8.64e4 = (4.332 * 8.64) * 1e10.

Compute 4.332 * 8.64:

4 *8=32, 4*0.64=2.56; 0.332*8=2.656; 0.332*0.64=0.2125. So adding up:

32 + 2.56 +2.656 +0.2125 = let's see:

32 + 2.56 is 34.56; +2.656 is 37.216; +0.2125 is 37.4285.

So approx 37.4285. So 37.4285e10 → 3.74285e11.

Wait, so the total number of reactions is about 3.74e11.

But wait, looking at the options, the closest is option A:5.55e11, but wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

First, moles of CCl4: 1.46g / 153.8 g/mol.

Wait, 153.8 grams per mole? Let me compute that again.

Carbon is about 12.01 g/mol, Cl is approx 35.45 g/mol each. So CCl4 is 12.01 +4*(35.45) = 12.01 + 141.8 = 153.81 g/mol.

So 1.46 g / 153.81 g/mol = approx 0.00948 mol.

Each mole of CCl4 has 4 moles Cl, so 0.00948 *4 = 0.03792 mol Cl.

Number of atoms = 0.03792 mol *6.022e23 atoms/mol = 0.03792 *6.022e23.

Compute 0.03792 *6.022:

0.03792 *6 = 0.22752, 0.03792 *0.022=0.000833. So total approx 0.22835.

So 0.22835e23 = 2.2835e22 atoms.

Wait, that matches my earlier calculation.

Then, R = phi * N * sigma.

Phi is 1e9 cm^-2 s^-1.

Sigma is 0.19 barn = 0.19e-24 cm².

So R = 1e9 * 2.2835e22 * 0.19e-24.

Compute this as:

(1e9) * (2.2835e22) = 2.2835e31.

Multiply by 0.19e-24: 2.2835e31 * 0.19e-24 = 2.2835 * 0.19 * 1e7.

2.2835 *0.19 = let's compute 2 *0.19 =0.38, 0.2835*0.19= approx 0.0538. So total 0.4338.

So 0.4338e7 → 4.338e6 per second.

Then, multiply by time in seconds. 24 hours = 24 *3600 = 86400 seconds.

So 4.338e6 * 8.64e4 = ?

Let me compute 4.338e6 * 8.64e4 = (4.338 *8.64) * 1e10.

Compute 4.338 *8.64.

4 *8=32.

4 *0.64=2.56.

0.338 *8=2.704.

0.338 *0.64=0.2163.

So adding these:

32 +2.56 =34.56.

+2.704 =37.264.

+0.2163=37.4803.

So 37.4803 *1e10 = 3.74803e11.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 3.14e11, which is close but not exactly. Did I make a mistake?

Hmm. Maybe I missed a factor somewhere. Let's recheck the calculations.

Wait, wait, the cross-section is given as the isotopic cross-section for the reaction, which is 0.19 barns. So perhaps that's correct. But wait, what about the neutron flux being the thermal flux. Oh, but the cross-section is given as 0.19 barn, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the total number of Cl atoms, but the neutron flux is only through one face. Wait, but the formula R=phi*N*sigma assumes that the flux is passing through the entire volume. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of the volume? Wait, the formula for reaction rate is R = φ * N * σ.

Wait, N is the total number of targets in the sample, which is correct. Because the flux is given per cm², and the sample is 1 cm³, so the total number of neutrons passing through the sample per second is phi * (1 cm²) *1 cm thick? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of neutron flux through the sample.

Wait, another approach: The reaction rate R is given by the product of the flux (φ), the number of target nuclei (N), and the cross-section (σ). So R = φ * N * σ.

Wait, another way: The flux is the number of neutrons per cm² per second. The sample's area is 1 cm², so the number passing through is 1e9 neutrons per second. But when these neutrons pass through the sample, each has a certain probability to interact, based on the cross-section and the number of targets.

The formula for the reaction rate is R = φ * N * σ. So yes, I think that's correct.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's phi multiplied by the number of targets per cm²? Hmm, perhaps not. Because phi is the number passing through a cm², and N is the number in the entire sample.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the number of targets per cm³ and then multiply by the volume. Let's see:

Number of Cl atoms per cm³: 2.2835e22 atoms in 1 cm³ → that's 2.2835e22 atoms/cm³.

The flux is 1e9 neutrons/(cm²·s).

The total reaction rate would be R = φ * (N_per_cm³) * σ * volume.

Wait, no, because R = φ * N * σ.

Wait, perhaps an alternative way: the flux is 1e9 neutrons per cm² per second. The sample is 1 cm thick, so the number of targets per cm² is N_per_cm² = (number of Cl atoms per cm³) * (1 cm) → 2.2835e22 atoms/cm².

Then, R = φ * N_per_cm² * σ.

So R = 1e9 * 2.2835e22 * 0.19e-24.

Compute that:

(1e9) * (2.2835e22) = 2.2835e31.

Multiply by 0.19e-24: 2.2835e31 * 0.19e-24 = 2.2835 * 0.19 * 1e7.

Which is the same as before, giving 4.338e6 per second, and total 3.748e11 after 86400 seconds. So this approach gives the same result.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option exactly at ~3.75e11. Let's check the options again.

Options:

A:5.55e11

B:1.96e11

C:1.23e11

D:2.89e11

E:7.22e11

F:3.68e11

G:1.09e11

H:4.87e11

I:3.14e11

J:2.45e11

Hmm, the closest is F:3.68e11 or I:3.14e11. Wait, but my calculation is 3.75e11, which isn't exactly one of the options. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of moles of Cl. Let me recalculate:

Mass of sample is 1.46g. Molar mass of CCl4 is 12.01 +4(35.45) =12.01 +141.8=153.81 g/mol.

Moles of CCl4: 1.46 /153.81 = approx 0.00948 mol.

Moles of Cl: 0.00948 *4 =0.03792 mol.

Number of Cl atoms:0.03792 *6.022e23 = ?

Compute 0.03792 *6.022e23.

0.03792 =3.792e-2.

3.792e-2 *6.022e23 = (3.792 *6.022) *1e21.

3.792 *6.022: let's compute that.

3 *6 =18.

3 *0.022=0.066.

0.792 *6=4.752.

0.792 *0.022=0.017424.

So adding:

18 +0.066=18.066.

+4.752=22.818.

+0.017424=22.835424.

So 22.835424e21 → 2.2835424e22 atoms.

So that part was correct.

Now, the reaction rate R = phi * N * sigma =1e9 *2.2835e22 *0.19e-24.

Compute 1e9 *2.2835e22 =2.2835e31.

2.2835e31 *0.19e-24 = 2.2835 *0.19 *1e7.

2.2835 *0.19: let me compute that again.

2 *0.19=0.38.

0.2835 *0.19: 0.2835*0.2 =0.0567, minus 0.2835*0.01=0.002835 → 0.0567-0.002835=0.053865.

So total is 0.38 +0.053865=0.433865.

So 0.433
