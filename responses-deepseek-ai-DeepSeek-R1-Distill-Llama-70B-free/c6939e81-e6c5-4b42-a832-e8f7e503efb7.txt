Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is: The value of the digit 5 in 24,513 is how many times the value of the digit 5 in 357? And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Alright, so I think I need to find the value of the digit 5 in each number and then see how many times greater one is than the other. 

Let me start with the first number, which is 24,513. I need to identify where the digit 5 is and determine its place value. So, breaking down 24,513 digit by digit:

- The digits are 2, 4, 5, 1, 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 24,513 is a five-digit number. Let me write it out: 2 (ten thousands place), 4 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 1 (tens), 3 (ones). So the 5 is in the hundreds place. 

Right, so the value of 5 in 24,513 is 5 times 100, which is 500. Okay, so that's 500.

Now, the second number is 357. Again, I'll break it down by place value. 3 is in the hundreds place, 5 is in the tens place, and 7 is in the ones place. So the digit 5 here is in the tens place. 

The value of 5 in 357 is 5 times 10, which is 50.

Now, the question is asking how many times the value of the first 5 is compared to the second. So I need to divide the first value by the second to find the factor.

So that's 500 divided by 50. Let me calculate that: 500 รท 50 equals 10. So the value is 10 times as much.

Looking back at the options, option F is 10. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. First number is 24,513, 5 is in the hundreds place, so 500. Second number is 357, 5 is in the tens place, so 50. 500 divided by 50 is indeed 10. Yep, that seems right.

The digit 5 in 24,513 is in the hundreds place, giving it a value of 500. The digit 5 in 357 is in the tens place, giving it a value of 50. To find how many times greater 500 is than 50, we divide 500 by 50, which equals 10.

Answer: F
