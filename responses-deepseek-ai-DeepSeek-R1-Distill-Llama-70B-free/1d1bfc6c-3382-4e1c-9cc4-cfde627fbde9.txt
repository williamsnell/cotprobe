Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a flying squirrel and air drag. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about the amount of air drag on an 0.8-N flying squirrel when it's dropping vertically at terminal velocity. The options are A through J.

First, I remember that terminal velocity is when the force of gravity pulling the object down is balanced by the force of air resistance (drag) pushing up. So at terminal velocity, the net force should be zero. That means the drag force must equal the weight of the squirrel.

Wait, the squirrel's weight is given as 0.8 N. So if the drag is equal to the weight at terminal velocity, the drag should be 0.8 N. That makes sense because if it's falling at a constant speed, the forces balance each other out.

Looking at the options, option C says 0.8 N. So that's probably the correct answer. But I should check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A: Dependent on wind speed. Well, drag does depend on factors like speed, but since the squirrel is at terminal velocity, the speed is constant. Any changes in wind might affect it, but the question is about the amount of drag at that moment, so I don't think wind speed affects the magnitude of the drag force once it's at terminal velocity.

Option B: Greater than 0.8 N. No, because if drag were greater, the squirrel would be decelerating, not moving at constant speed.

Option D: Temperature of air. Air density affects drag. Temperature changes air density, so drag would be dependent on that. Wait, but the question is about the current drag force, not what affects it. Oh, but wait, the question is phrased as "the amount of air drag...is". So is it asking for the magnitude or what factors it depends on?

Wait, reading the question again. It says, "The amount of air drag...is". So it's a statement about what the drag is. So the correct answer is that the drag equals the weight, which is 0.8 N. So the correct answer is C.

But wait, let's go back. The squirrel is at terminal velocity, so drag equals weight. So the drag is 0.8 N regardless of other factors unless those factors change the drag. But in the situation given, the drag is 0.8 N.

Now, looking at the other options for dependencies. The question is a bit ambiguous. Is it asking what the drag's magnitude is, or which factors affect it? Because the question says, "the amount of air drag...is", so it's about the magnitude.

So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question gives options where some are about factors (dependencies) and others are about the magnitude. Oh, but looking at the options again:

Option C is 0.8 N, which is a magnitude.

Options A, D, E, F, H, I, J are about dependencies.

Wait, but the question is "The amount of air drag...is". So the actual value is 0.8 N. So the correct answer is C.

So I think I'm confident now. The answer is C.

The question asks for the amount of air drag on a flying squirrel weighing 0.8 N when it is dropping vertically at terminal velocity. At terminal velocity, the downward gravitational force (weight) is exactly balanced by the upward air drag force, resulting in zero net force. Therefore, the magnitude of the air drag force must equal the weight of the squirrel, which is 0.8 N.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, E, F, H, I, J**: These options describe factors that could influence air drag, such as wind speed, temperature, orientation, etc. However, the question specifically asks for the amount of air drag, not the factors affecting it.
- **B**: If the drag were greater than 0.8 N, the squirrel would decelerate, which contradicts the condition of terminal velocity.
- **C**: This correctly states that the air drag equals the weight of the squirrel, which is 0.8 N at terminal velocity.
- **G**: If the drag were less than 0.8 N, the squirrel would accelerate downward, again contradicting the condition of terminal velocity.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the air drag equals the weight of the squirrel at terminal velocity.

Answer: C
