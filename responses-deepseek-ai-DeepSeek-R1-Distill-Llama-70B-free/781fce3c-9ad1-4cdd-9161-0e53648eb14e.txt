Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about retained earnings and reserves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work it out.

Alright, the question is asking what happens to the free amount if the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000. The current situation is:

- Reserved for contingencies: $25,000
- Reserved for plant expansion: $20,000
- Total reserves: $45,000
- Free retained earnings: $50,000
- Total retained earnings: $95,000

Wait, I think I remember that retained earnings can be divided into two parts: the amount that's been set aside as reserves (or appropriations) and the amount that's free, which the company can use for dividends or other purposes.

So total retained earnings equal the sum of all reserves plus the free retained earnings. Let me check: $45,000 (reserves) + $50,000 (free) equals $95,000 total. Yep, that adds up.

Now, the reserve for contingencies is going to increase by $10,000. That means they're taking more money out of the free retained earnings and putting it into reserves. Because when you increase a reserve, you're appropriating more funds from the free amount.

So originally, the contingencies reserve was $25,000. If it increases by $10k, it becomes $35,000. But wait, does that mean the free amount decreases by $10k?

Yes, because reserves come from retained earnings. So when you increase a reserve, you're moving money from free to reserved. So the free retained earnings would go down.

The original free amount was $50,000. Subtracting $10,000 would make it $40,000. So the new free retained earnings should be $40k.

Let me look at the options. Option A is $40,000. So that should be the answer.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not mixing things up. So if the reserve increases by 10k, the free amount decreases by 10k because you're reserving more. So yes, 50k minus 10k is 40k. That makes sense.

To determine the impact on free retained earnings when the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000, we analyze the given data:

- **Initial Reserves**:  
  - Reserved for contingencies: $25,000  
  - Reserved for plant expansion: $20,000  
  - Total reserves: $45,000  

- **Free Retained Earnings**: $50,000  
- **Total Retained Earnings**: $95,000  

When the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000, the new reserve for contingencies becomes $35,000. Since reserves are appropriated from free retained earnings, increasing the reserve reduces the free amount by $10,000.  

Thus, the new free retained earnings will be:  
$50,000 (original free retained earnings) - $10,000 (increase in reserve) = **$40,000**.  

From the options provided, the correct answer is **A: $40,000**.
