Question:

A very drunk man was sitting in a bar drinking. A businessman customer came and sat beside him. They did not know each other. The businessman had slightly grazed against the drunk man's body. "Man, are you trying to kill me or something?'' said the very drunk man. The businessman did not think anything of it, since he had barely grazed the drunkard. The drunk continued to bully the businessman, calling him made-up names, and saying things that were nonsensical to the businessman and to others at the bar who were listening to the drunk's boisterous and irrational rants. The drunk then took a gun out of his pocket and shot the businessman, killing him. At trial, the defense argued that the man could not form the specific intent to premeditate for first degree murder. Which of the following crimes is the defendant most likely guilty of under these facts?

Options:

A: Involuntary Manslaughter
B: Second Degree Murder
C: Voluntary Manslaughter
D: Aggravated Assault
E: Justifiable Homicide
F: First Degree Murder
G: Negligent Homicide
H: Self-Defense
I: Attempted Murder
J: Felony Murder

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically homicide. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a drunk man in a bar. A businessman sits next to him, and they accidentally touch. The drunk reacts aggressively, threatens, bullies, and eventually shoots the businessman, killing him. The defense is arguing that the man couldn't form the specific intent for premeditation needed for first-degree murder.

So, I need to figure out what crime the defendant is most likely guilty of. Let's break down the elements.

First, let me recall the different murder degrees. First-degree murder typically requires premeditation and deliberation—so planning and intent. Second-degree murder is murder without premeditation but with malice aforethought, which could include intent to cause serious bodily harm or extreme recklessness showing disregard for human life.

Voluntary manslaughter is when a killing happens in the heat of passion due to adequate provocation, which would reduce it from murder to manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter is when the death is caused by criminal negligence or during the commission of a low-level felony.

Looking at the facts, the drunk man was very intoxicated. He barely got touched by the businessman, which seems like minimal or no provocation. But he starts bullying, using made-up names, and then pulls out a gun and shoots. The key here is the state of mind.

The defense argues he couldn't form specific intent for premeditation. So, if he was too intoxicated, he might not have been able to plan or deliberate, which are specific intents. But does that mean he couldn't have malice aforethought for second-degree murder?

Wait, but in many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication can negate specific intent but not general intent. So, first-degree murder requires specific intent (premeditation), so if he was too drunk to form that, he can't be guilty of first-degree. But second-degree murder might still apply because it could be based on general intent or depraved heart (reckless disregard).

Alternatively, if the killing was in the heat of passion, it might be voluntary manslaughter. But was there adequate provocation? The drunk just got slightly grazed, so maybe that's not enough for a reasonable person to be provoked. So perhaps not voluntary manslaughter.

Involuntary manslaughter would be if the death was due to recklessness or during a misdemeanor. But the defendant here used a deadly weapon, so maybe it's more than that.

Wait, but if the defendant was so drunk that he couldn't form malice, then maybe the charge is reduced. Alternatively, felony murder—if the killing occurred during a felony like robbery or something, but I don't see a felony here. He just shot someone, so maybe not felony murder.

Another thought: depraved heart murder. That's a type of second-degree murder where the defendant acts with a depraved heart, showing extreme recklessness. So even without specific intent, if he acted with that kind of recklessness, second-degree murder would apply.

But wait, can intoxication negate depraved heart? I think depraved heart is a general intent crime, so voluntary intoxication might not negate it. So if he acted with extreme recklessness, even while drunk, he could be guilty of second-degree murder.

Alternatively, if he intended to kill, but due to intoxication, he couldn't form the specific intent for first-degree, but still had the general intent for second-degree.

Wait, but the question is about whether he could form specific intent. The defense is arguing he couldn't premeditate. So first-degree is out. But can he still be guilty of second-degree? Because second-degree murder doesn't require premeditation, just malice.

So, the options are between B (second-degree murder) and perhaps C (voluntary manslaughter) or A (involuntary). But the conduct here seems intentional—shooting someone. So involuntary manslaughter is unlikely because that's for unintentional killings caused by recklessness or negligence.

Voluntary manslaughter requires heat of passion, but the provocation here seems insufficient. So perhaps the correct answer is second-degree murder.

Wait, but some might argue that the defendant's actions were so reckless that they demonstrate a depraved heart, which is enough for second-degree murder.

Alternatively, if the defendant was so intoxicated that he couldn't form the intent to kill, maybe it's involuntary manslaughter. But here, he pulled out a gun and shot, which seems intentional. So even if drunk, the act was intentional, but perhaps the mental state is affected.

In many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication can reduce murder to manslaughter if it negates malice. But I think malice can be general intent, so maybe it doesn't negate it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the possibilities.

1. First-degree murder: requires premeditation and deliberation. If too drunk to form that, can't be guilty of this. So F is out.

2. Second-degree murder: requires malice aforethought, which can be express (intent to kill) or implied (intent to cause serious bodily harm, or depraved heart recklessness). If the defendant intended to shoot, even if drunk, he could have express malice. But does voluntary intoxication affect this?

In some states, voluntary intoxication can negate the specific intent for first-degree but not the general intent for second-degree. So if he intended to kill, even while drunk, he could have malice for second-degree. Alternatively, if he acted with depraved heart, that's another basis.

3. Voluntary manslaughter: heat of passion with adequate provocation. But the slight graze seems minor, so maybe not adequate. So probably not C.

4. Involuntary manslaughter: killing without intent but with criminal negligence. But here, the defendant used a gun, which is a deadly weapon, so maybe more than negligence. So probably A is out.

5. Felony murder: requires a felony, but the only felony is the murder itself. So J is probably not applicable.

So, putting it together, the defendant likely couldn't form the specific intent for first-degree, but may have acted with malice for second-degree. So the answer is B, second-degree murder.

The scenario involves a drunk man who, after minimal provocation, shoots and kills a businessman. The defense argues that the defendant could not form the specific intent required for first-degree murder due to intoxication. To determine the appropriate charge, the following analysis applies:

1. **First-Degree Murder**: This requires premeditation and deliberation, which are specific intents. Since the defense argues that intoxication prevented the defendant from forming these specific intents, first-degree murder is not applicable.

2. **Second-Degree Murder**: This requires malice aforethought, which can be express (intent to kill) or implied (intent to cause serious bodily harm or depraved heart recklessness). The defendant’s act of shooting the victim with a gun demonstrates intent to kill, satisfying express malice. Additionally, the reckless and aggressive behavior could support depraved heart murder. Voluntary intoxication does not negate general intent, so second-degree murder remains a viable charge.

3. **Voluntary Manslaughter**: This applies when a killing occurs in the heat of passion due to adequate provocation. However, the slight graze by the businessman does not constitute adequate provocation for a reasonable person, making this option unlikely.

4. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: This involves unintentional killings due to criminal negligence or during a misdemeanor. The defendant’s intentional act of shooting makes this option inapplicable.

5. **Felony Murder**: This requires a killing during the commission of a felony. Since no underlying felony is evident beyond the murder itself, this option does not apply.

Given the facts, the defendant’s actions align most closely with second-degree murder, as the killing was intentional and demonstrated malice aforethought, even if first-degree murder is precluded by the inability to form specific intent due to intoxication.

**Answer: B**
