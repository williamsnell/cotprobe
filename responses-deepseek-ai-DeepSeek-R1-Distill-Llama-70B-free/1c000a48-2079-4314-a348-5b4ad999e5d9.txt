Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

Alright, the problem says there are two rods, one made of brass and the other of steel. They have the same diameter, so their cross-sectional areas must be the same. The brass rod is 25 cm long, and the steel rod is 50 cm long. They're placed end to end and pinned between two rigid supports. The temperature then rises to 40°C. I need to find the stress in each rod.

Hmm, I remember that when materials are heated and constrained, they can't expand freely, so internal stresses develop. Since the rods are pinned rigidly, their expansion is constrained, leading to either compression or tension.

The Young's moduli given are 20e11 dyne/cm² for steel and 10e11 for brass. The coefficients of expansion are 1.2e-5 per °C for steel and 1.8e-5 for brass. Oh wait, wait, no, let me double-check. The question says steel's coefficient is 1.2e-5 and brass is 1.8e-5. Right, that's correct.

So, the setup is that both rods are heated, but because they're fixed, their total length can't change. So the change in length for each would have to be equal and opposite. Wait, no, because each expands, but together they can't expand beyond the original total length. So the system is trying to expand, but the supports prevent it, causing stress.

Let me think about the approach. I think I should calculate the change in length each rod would undergo if unconstrained, and then see how much they have to be compressed or stretched to fit back into the original total length. Since they're connected in series, their combined change in length would be the sum of each individual change.

Wait, but the supports are rigid, so the total length can't change. Therefore, the expansion of one must be compensated by contraction of the other. But wait, if both expand, how can that be? Because each rod's expansion would cause the total length to increase. But since the supports prevent that, each rod is under stress.

Hmm, perhaps each rod's attempted expansion causes strain, but since the supports are fixed, the total change is zero. So the sum of the changes in length of each rod must be zero.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the rods are placed end to end, their total length is 25 + 50 = 75 cm. When the temperature increases, each would expand, trying to make the total length longer. But the supports won't allow that, so each rod is under some stress.

Wait, but each rod would have a different expansion. Let me calculate the unconstrained expansion for each.

The formula for linear expansion is ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT, where α is the coefficient, L0 is the original length, and ΔT is the temperature change.

So for each rod:

Brass rod:
ΔL_brass = α_brass * L_brass * ΔT
= 1.8e-5 °C⁻¹ * 25 cm * (40°C)
= 1.8e-5 * 25 *40
Let me compute that: 25 *40 is 1000, so 1.8e-5 *1000 = 0.018 cm.

Steel rod:
ΔL_steel = α_steel * L_steel * ΔT
=1.2e-5 *50 *40
=1.2e-5 *2000
=0.024 cm.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. For the steel rod, 50 cm times 40°C is 2000 cm·°C, multiplied by 1.2e-5 gives 2000 *1.2e-5 = 0.024 cm.

Wait, but if both expand, the total ΔL would be 0.018 + 0.024 = 0.042 cm. But the supports don't allow this expansion, so the system must adjust. So the actual change in length for each rod must sum to zero. Therefore, one rod is under compression and the other under tension? Or maybe both under the same type of stress, but that doesn't make sense because their expansions are in the same direction.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as each rod being stretched or compressed so that their total change in length is zero. Let me denote the change in length of brass as ΔL1 and steel as ΔL2.

But in reality, without the constraint, each would expand by their respective ΔL. But with the constraint, the total ΔL_total = ΔL1 + ΔL2 = 0.

Wait, no. Because the supports are rigid, the total length can't change, so the sum of their changes must be zero. So ΔL1 + ΔL2 = 0.

But wait, without constraints, each would expand. So the system would try to expand, but the constraints prevent any expansion, so each rod is subject to strain that brings their expansion back to zero.

So the actual change in length for each rod is not ΔL_brass and ΔL_steel as calculated, but rather some strain due to stress.

Alternatively, maybe each rod's length change is such that the sum is zero.

Wait, let me think in terms of forces and displacements. Since both rods are connected, the forces must balance, but the displacements must add up to zero.

Each rod is under stress, so the strain in each would be related to the stress by Young's modulus. The strain is (change in length)/original length.

So for brass, strain ε1 = σ1 / E1.

For steel, strain ε2 = σ2 / E2.

But the total change in length is ε1 * L1 + ε2 * L2 = 0.

Because the supports prevent any overall change in length.

Wait, but the actual unconstrained expansion would have been ΔL1 + ΔL2, but the constraint requires that the sum of the changes due to stress equals the negative of that expansion.

Wait, perhaps I should model it like this: The system tries to expand by ΔL_total = ΔL_brass + ΔL_steel. But because the supports prevent expansion, each rod is under strain such that the sum of their compressed or stretched lengths cancels this expansion.

Alternatively, the total change in length after stress is applied would be zero: (ΔL_brass - δL_brass) + (ΔL_steel - δL_steel) ) = 0. Hmm, not quite sure.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think that the change in length due to temperature is ΔL, but due to stress, each rod's length changes by an amount δL = (σ * L) / E, where σ is the stress.

But since the supports prevent any overall change, the sum of the changes (ΔL_brass - δL_brass) + (ΔL_steel - δL_steel) ) = 0.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again.

When you heat the rods, each would expand by ΔL. But the constraint requires that the total expansion is zero. Therefore, the expansion from heating is countered by contraction from the stress.

So for each rod, the change in length from stress is δL = - (σ * L) / E.

So the net change for each rod is ΔL (from heating) + δL (from stress) = 0.

Wait, but that's not possible because each rod would have a different ΔL. So perhaps each rod's net change is zero. That can't be, because the rods have different lengths and different α.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the sum of the changes in length of each rod must be zero. So:

ΔL_brass + δL_brass + ΔL_steel + δL_steel = 0.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the rods are in series. So the total change in the system is the sum of each rod's change. Since the supports prevent any change, the sum must be zero.

So:

(ΔL_brass + δL_brass) + (ΔL_steel + δL_steel ) = 0.

But wait, no. Because the rods are connected end to end, the total change is the sum of each's change. So:

ΔL_total = (ΔL_brass - δL_brass) + (ΔL_steel - δL_steel ) = 0.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write the equations properly.

Let me denote:

For brass rod:
ΔL_brass = α_brass * L_brass * ΔT → expansion if unconstrained.

But due to stress, the actual change is ΔL_brass - (σ_brass * L_brass / E_brass) = 0?

Wait, no. Because when you apply stress, the rod's length changes. If the stress is tensile, the rod would elongate, but since the supports are preventing expansion, the stress would actually be compressive, causing the rod to contract.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the situation as each rod being subject to stress that causes a strain opposing their thermal expansion.

So the net change in each rod's length is zero. But that can't be, because the two rods have different expansion coefficients and lengths, so their ΔL would be different.

Wait, no. The total length of the system must remain the same, so the sum of the changes in each rod's length must be zero.

So:

ΔL_brass_actual + ΔL_steel_actual = 0.

But the actual change in each rod's length is due to both thermal expansion and the stress.

So for each rod:

ΔL_brass_actual = α_brass * L_brass * ΔT - (σ_brass * L_brass / E_brass)
ΔL_steel_actual = α_steel * L_steel * ΔT - (σ_steel * L_steel / E_steel )

And,

ΔL_brass_actual + ΔL_steel_actual = 0

So substituting:

[α_brass * L_brass * ΔT - (σ_brass * L_brass / E_brass)] + [α_steel * L_steel * ΔT - (σ_steel * L_steel / E_steel )] = 0

But wait, are the stresses in both rods the same? Hmm, since they are connected in series, the forces must be the same, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the strain is the same, but I think that's only for materials in series where the same force applies.

Wait, actually, since the rods are connected end to end and pinned, the forces in each must be equal in magnitude because they're part of the same system. So the force in the brass equals the force in the steel. Since the cross-sectional area is the same for both rods (same diameter), the stress (σ = F/A) would be the same for both. Is that correct?

Wait, no, because Young's modulus is different, so even if the strain is the same, the stress would differ. Alternatively, perhaps the strain isn't the same because the lengths are different. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the forces in both rods are the same. Since the system is in equilibrium, the tension (or compression) force in each rod must be equal. Because if one had a higher force, it would pull the other, causing acceleration, which isn't the case here.

So F_brass = F_steel = F.

Since the cross-sectional area A is the same for both rods, the stress σ = F/A is the same for both rods. So σ_brass = σ_steel = σ.

But wait, if that's the case, then the strain in each would be σ/E for each material.

So, ε_brass = σ / E_brass
ε_steel = σ / E_steel

Now, the total change in length must be zero, so:

ΔL_brass + ΔL_steel = 0.

Wait, no, because each rod's change in length is due to both thermal expansion and the strain from stress.

So for each rod, the actual change in length is:

ΔL_brass = α_brass * L_brass * ΔT + ε_brass * L_brass
ΔL_steel = α_steel * L_steel * ΔT + ε_steel * L_steel

But the sum must be zero:

ΔL_brass + ΔL_steel = 0

Substituting ε in terms of σ:

ΔL_brass = α_brass * L_brass * ΔT + (σ / E_brass) * L_brass
ΔL_steel = α_steel * L_steel * ΔT + (σ / E_steel) * L_steel

So,

[ α_brass * L_brass * ΔT + (σ * L_brass) / E_brass ] + [ α_steel * L_steel * ΔT + (σ * L_steel) / E_steel ] = 0

I can factor out σ:

σ [ (L_brass / E_brass) + (L_steel / E_steel) ) ] + [ α_brass L_brass ΔT + α_steel L_steel ΔT ] = 0

Solving for σ:

σ = - [ (α_brass L_brass + α_steel L_steel) ΔT ] / [ (L_brass / E_brass) + (L_steel / E_steel) ) ]

Wait, let me plug in the numbers to compute this.

Given:

L_brass =25 cm
L_steel=50 cm
ΔT=40°C
α_brass=1.8e-5 /°C
α_steel=1.2e-5 /°C
E_brass=10e11 dyne/cm²
E_steel=20e11 dyne/cm²

Compute numerator:

(α_brass L_brass + α_steel L_steel) ΔT
= (1.8e-5 *25 + 1.2e-5 *50 ) *40
Compute each term:
1.8e-5 *25 = 4.5e-4
1.2e-5 *50 = 6e-4
Sum: 4.5e-4 +6e-4=10.5e-4=1.05e-3
Multiply by 40: 1.05e-3 *40=4.2e-2

Denominator:

(L_brass / E_brass) + (L_steel / E_steel)
= (25 /10e11 ) + (50 /20e11 )
= (2.5e-12 ) + (2.5e-12 )
= 5e-12

So σ = - (4.2e-2 ) / (5e-12 ) = - (4.2e-2) / (5e-12 ) = -8.4e9 dyne/cm²

Wait, but that would give a stress of -8.4e9 dyne/cm², which is a compressive stress.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 0.84e9, which is much smaller. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Numerator:

α_brass * L_brass = 1.8e-5 *25 = 0.00045
α_steel * L_steel =1.2e-5 *50 = 0.0006
Sum: 0.00045 +0.0006 =0.00105
Multiply by ΔT=40: 0.00105*40=0.042

Wait, wait a second, earlier I thought 0.00105 *40 is 0.042, which is 4.2e-2. But wait, 0.00105 is 1.05e-3, times 40 is 4.2e-2, correct.

Denominator:

25 /10e11 = 2.5e-12
50 /20e11=2.5e-12
Sum:5e-12

So σ = - (4.2e-2) / (5e-12 ) = -8.4e9 dyne/cm²

Wait, but none of the options match this. The options are in the range of 0.3e9 to 2.5e9.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe I should model the problem differently.

Alternative approach:

Each rod is constrained, so when heated, each will develop a stress. Since the rods are connected in series, the force in each must be the same. Because they are connected end to end, the same force F is exerted on each rod. Because the supports are rigid, the total elongation due to temperature is zero.

So, the expansion of each rod is counteracted by compression due to the force F.

So, for each rod, the strain due to temperature is α * ΔT, and the strain due to stress is -F/(A E), because stress causes compression.

Wait, but the net strain for each rod must be such that the total length remains the same.

Wait, no, the net change in length of each rod is the sum of the expansion from temperature and the contraction from stress.

So for the brass rod:

ΔL_brass = (α_brass * ΔT * L_brass) - (F * L_brass)/(A * E_brass) )

Similarly for steel:

ΔL_steel = (α_steel * ΔT * L_steel) - (F * L_steel)/(A * E_steel) )

The sum of ΔL_brass and ΔL_steel must be zero:

[α_brass ΔT L_brass - (F L_brass)/(A E_brass) ] + [α_steel ΔT L_steel - (F L_steel)/(A E_steel) ] = 0

Let me factor out F/(A):

F/(A) [ L_brass / E_brass + L_steel / E_steel ] = ΔT ( α_brass L_brass + α_steel L_steel )

So, F/A = [ ΔT ( α_brass L_brass + α_steel L_steel ) ] / [ (L_brass / E_brass + L_steel / E_steel) ]

But F/A is the stress σ.

So,

σ = [ ΔT ( α_brass L_brass + α_steel L_steel ) ] / [ (L_brass / E_brass + L_steel / E_steel ) ]

Wait, but in this case, the stress would be positive, but in reality, since the rods are trying to expand, the stress would be compressive, so σ should be negative. Let me see.

Wait, let's compute the numerator and
