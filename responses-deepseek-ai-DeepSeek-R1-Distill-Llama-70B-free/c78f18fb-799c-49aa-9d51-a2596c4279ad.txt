Okay, so I've got this problem here about Susan Wane and Dolly Watson investing in a corkscrew factory. They each put in different amounts and are sharing the profits in a certain way. I need to figure out how the $24,200 profit gets divided between them.

Let me read the problem again. Susan invested $35,000, and Dolly invested $20,000. They decide to share the profits equally, but first, each gets 8% interest on their investment. The total earnings are $24,200. So I need to calculate each person's share after giving them their 8% interest and then splitting the remaining profit equally.

Wait, wait. So first, I think I need to calculate the interest each gets. Susan's investment is $35k. 8% of that is 0.08 * 35,000. Let me compute that. 35,000 * 0.08 is $2,800. Dolly's investment is $20k, so 0.08 * 20,000 is $1,600. So together, their interest is $2,800 + $1,600 = $4,400. 

Now, the total profit is $24,200. So after paying the interest, the remaining profit to be split equally would be 24,200 - 4,400 = $19,800. Because they share the remaining profit equally, each would get half of that. So 19,800 divided by 2 is $9,900 each.

Wait, no, wait. Because the problem says they share the profits equally after each receives 8% interest. So their total income each is the interest plus their share of the remaining profit.

So Susan gets her $2,800 interest plus half of $19,800, which is $9,900. Adding those together: 2,800 + 9,900 = $12,700. Dolly gets $1,600 interest plus $9,900, which totals 1,600 +9,900 = $11,500.

Wait, so Susan gets $12,700 and Dolly gets $11,500. Let me check the options to see which matches.

Looking at options:

Option J: Ms. Wane receives $12,700, Ms. Watson $11,500. That fits.

Alternatively, let me double-check the calculations.

Susan: 35k * 0.08 = 2,800. 
Dolly: 20k *0.08 = 1,600. 
Total interest: 4,400.
Profit after interest: 24,200 -4,400 =19,800. Split equally, so each gets 9,900.

So Susan's total: 2,800 +9,900=12,700. Dolly: 1,600 +9,900=11,500.

Yes, so the correct distribution is option J.

To determine the distribution of the $24,200 profit between Ms. Susan Wane and Ms. Dolly Watson, we first calculate the 8% interest on their respective investments:

- **Ms. Susan Wane's interest**:  
  \( 0.08 \times 35,000 = 2,800 \)  
- **Ms. Dolly Watson's interest**:  
  \( 0.08 \times 20,000 = 1,600 \)  

The total interest paid is \( 2,800 + 1,600 = 4,400 \). Subtracting this from the total profit leaves \( 24,200 - 4,400 = 19,800 \), which is to be split equally between the two partners. Each receives:  
\( 19,800 \div 2 = 9,900 \).

Adding the interest to their share of the remaining profit:  
- **Ms. Susan Wane's total**: \( 2,800 + 9,900 = 12,700 \)  
- **Ms. Dolly Watson's total**: \( 1,600 + 9,900 = 11,500 \)  

Thus, Ms. Wane receives $12,700, and Ms. Watson receives $11,500. This matches **Option J**.
