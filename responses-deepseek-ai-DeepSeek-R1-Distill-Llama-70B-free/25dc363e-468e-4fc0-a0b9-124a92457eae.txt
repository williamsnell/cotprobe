Okay, let's tackle this insurance premium problem. Hmm, Phil LeFranc bought two types of insurance: bodily injury and property damage. I need to find out the premium for each. 

First, I remember that insurance premiums are calculated by taking the base premium and multiplying it by some factors. Oh right, the total factors here are given as 1.37 for bodily injury and 1.10 for property damage.

So for the bodily injury coverage, the base premium is $101. I think I just multiply that by 1.37. Let me do that calculation: 101 * 1.37. Hmm, 100 * 1.37 is 137, and 1 * 1.37 is 1.37, so together that's 138.37. Okay, so the bodily injury premium is $138.37.

Now for the property damage, the base is $48 and the factor is 1.10. So 48 * 1.10. Well, 48 * 1 is 48, and 48 * 0.10 is 4.8. Adding those together gives 52.8. So the property damage premium is $52.80.

Looking at the options, the correct one should have $138.37 for bodily injury and $52.80 for property damage. Let me check the options again. Option A is exactly that. So the answer must be A.

1. **Bodily Injury Insurance**:
   - Base premium: $101
   - Total factor: 1.37
   - Calculation: \( 101 \times 1.37 = 138.37 \)
   - Premium: **$138.37**

2. **Property Damage Insurance**:
   - Base premium: $48
   - Total factor: 1.10
   - Calculation: \( 48 \times 1.10 = 52.80 \)
   - Premium: **$52.80**

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is **Option A**.
