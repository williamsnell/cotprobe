Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the system function H(jω) and the impulse response of a one-port network. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

Alright, the problem says that the input voltage is v_i(t) = 100 cos(ω_o t) volts. And the input current I_i(jω) is given as 100π [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] multiplied by (1 - j)/(2ω). Wait, so I need to find H(jω) which is V_i(jω)/I_i(jω).

Wait, right, in the frequency domain, H(jω) is the ratio of the voltage's Fourier transform to the current's Fourier transform. So H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω).

First, I need to find V_i(jω). The voltage is 100 cos(ω_o t). I remember that the Fourier transform of cos(ω_o t) is π [δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o)]. So scaling by 100, V_i(jω) would be 100 * π [δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o)].

Wait, no, the Fourier transform of cos(k t) is π [δ(ω -k) + δ(ω +k)] right? So yeah, that makes V_i(jω) = 100 * π [δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o)].

Now, the current I_i(jω) is given as 100π [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] * (1 - j)/(2ω). Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me parse that. So I_i(jω) is 100π multiplied by the sum of deltas, multiplied by (1-j)/(2ω).

So H(jω) = [V_i(jω)] / [I_i(jω)].

Substituting the expressions:

H(jω) = [100 π (δ(ω+ω_o) + δ(ω-ω_o)) ] / [100 π (δ(ω+ω_o) + δ(ω-ω_o)) (1-j)/(2ω) ) ]

Wait, the 100π cancels out top and bottom. Also, the delta terms are the same in numerator and denominator, so they should cancel as well, right? So H(jω) becomes 1 / [(1-j)/(2ω)].

Wait, because the denominator of I_i(jω) is (1-j)/(2ω) multiplied by the deltas, but since the numerator also has those deltas, they'd cancel out. So H(jω) = [1] / [(1-j)/(2ω)].

Which is 2ω / (1 - j). Hmm, I can write 1/(1-j) as (1 + j)/2 by multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + j).

So 2ω (1 + j) / 2 = ω (1 + j).

Wait, that would make H(jω) = ω (1 + j). Wait, but that doesn't look right. Because if H(jω) is ω(1 + j), then the impulse response would be the inverse Fourier transform of that.

Wait, the inverse Fourier transform of jω is something like a derivative in time. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω).

V_i(jω) = 100 π [δ(ω+ω_o) + δ(ω-ω_o)].

I_i(jω) = 100 π [δ(ω+ω_o) + δ(ω-ω_o)] * (1-j)/(2ω).

So H(jω) is [100 π ... ] / [100 π ... * (1-j)/(2ω) ) ].

Yes, so the 100π terms cancel, the delta terms cancel, leaving 1 / [ (1-j)/(2ω) ) ].

Which is 2ω/(1-j), as before.

Now, 1-j can be written as sqrt(2) e^{-j π/4}, because the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), and the angle is -45 degrees or -π/4 radians.

But maybe another approach is to rationalize the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + j):

H(jω) = [2ω (1 + j)] / [ (1-j)(1+j) ) ] = 2ω(1 + j) / (1 + 1) ) = (2ω (1+j)) / 2 ) = ω (1 + j).

So H(jω) = ω (1 + j) = ω + j ω.

Hmm, but this seems a bit strange because H(jω) is typically a transfer function that could correspond to a circuit, perhaps with inductors or capacitors. Let me think about the time domain.

The impulse response h(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω). So h(t) = (1/2π) ∫ H(jω) e^{jω t} dω.

H(jω) is ω (1 + j). Let's split it into two terms: H(jω) = ω + j ω.

So the inverse Fourier transform would be the sum of the inverse transforms of each term.

The inverse Fourier transform of ω is j d/dt δ(t), because F{ d/dt δ(t) } = j ω. So to get ω, maybe it's related to the derivative of the delta function. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that F{ u(t) } = 1/(jω) + π δ(ω), where u(t) is the unit step. Hmm, but that's the integral, not the derivative.

Wait, let me think again. The Fourier transform of the derivative of a function is jω F(ω). So if h(t) has a term like the derivative of delta, then its Fourier transform would involve jω.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of known transforms. Hmm, another approach: I can write H(jω) = (1 + j) ω.

So H(jω) = (1 + j) ω.

Wait, but this would imply that h(t) is (1 + j) times the inverse Fourier transform of ω.

The inverse Fourier transform of ω is ...? I think it's j times the derivative of the delta function. Because F{δ'(t)} = jω. So if I have ω, its inverse Fourier transform would involve δ'(t) multiplied by j.

Wait, no: F^{-1} { j ω } = δ'(t). So F^{-1} { ω } would be (1/j) δ'(t) ) = -j δ'(t).

So putting it together:

h(t) = F^{-1} { H(jω) } = F^{-1} { (1 + j) ω } = (1 + j) F^{-1} { ω }.

Which is (1 + j) * (-j δ'(t)).

So let's compute that:

(1 + j) * (-j) = -j (1 + j) = -j - j^2 = -j +1 (since j^2 = -1).

Wait, that gives 1 - j.

So h(t) = (1 - j) δ'(t).

But this seems a bit odd. Because δ'(t) is the derivative of the delta function, which is an impulse at t=0 but with a negative slope.

Wait, but looking at the options given, none of them seem to involve derivatives of delta. All the options have h(t) as delta(t) plus or minus some exponential. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about H(jω). Let me go back. Oh wait! Wait a minute, the H(jω) I found was H(jω) = (1 + j) ω. But perhaps I should have considered that the system's H(jω) is possibly in a different form.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have approached it differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I confused the input current expression. The given I_i(jω) is 100π [δ(ω +ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] multiplied by (1-j)/(2ω).

Wait, but in H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω), I substituted correctly, but maybe I should think in terms of the system's properties. Wait, is the system linear and time-invariant? I think so, as it's a one-port network.

Wait, perhaps I should compute H(jω) as V_i(jω) divided by I_i(jω), but using the given expressions.

V_i(jω) is 100 * π [δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o)].

I_i(jω) is 100 π [δ(ω+ω_o) + δ(ω-ω_o)] * (1-j)/(2ω).

So when I take the ratio, the [δ(ω +/- ω_o)] terms cancel, 100π cancels, so I get 1 / [ (1-j)/(2ω) ) ].

So that's 2ω / (1 - j). As before.

Hmm, so H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Wait, perhaps I can express this as H(jω) = 2ω (1 + j) / ( (1-j)(1+j) ) ) = 2ω (1 + j) / (2) ) → ω(1 + j).

Which brings me back to the same point.

Alternatively, maybe I can write H(jω) as 2ω (1 - (-j))^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H(jω) could be expressed as a Laplace transform, evaluated at s = jω.

Because the impulse response's Laplace transform is H(s), so if I can find H(s), then I can find h(t).

So, H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j) = 2ω e^{j π/4} / sqrt(2)}.

Wait, no, let me think again. 1 - j can be written as sqrt(2) e^{-j π/4}.

Because 1 - j has magnitude sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), and the angle is -45 degrees or -π/4 radians.

So 1/(1 - j) = (1/sqrt(2)) e^{j π/4}.

So H(jω) = 2ω * (1/sqrt(2)) e^{j π/4}.

Which simplifies to sqrt(2) ω e^{j π/4}.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(jω) in terms of a Laplace transform by substituting s = jω.

Wait, H(s) would then be 2s/(1 - j), but that seems a bit messy.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps I should consider that H(jω) is 2ω (1 + j)/2, as earlier, which is ω(1 + j).

But then how to get h(t) from that.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the time domain. Since the system is linear and time-invariant, the impulse response is the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω).

H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Wait, perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = 2ω e^{j π/4} / sqrt(2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can write H(jω) as 2ω (1 + j)/2.

Wait, 2ω/(1 - j) = 2ω (1 + j)/ ( (1 - j)(1 + j) ) ) = 2ω (1 + j)/2 = ω (1 + j).

So H(jω) = ω (1 + j).

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of this would be the sum of the inverse transforms of ω and jω.

We know that F^{-1} { ω } is j δ’(t), and F^{-1} { j ω } is -δ’(t).

Wait, no: let's think carefully.

The Fourier transform of δ’(t) is jω. So to get F^{-1} { jω } = δ’(t).

Similarly, F^{-1} { ω } would be (1/j) F^{-1} { jω } = (1/j) δ’(t) = -j δ’(t).

So H(jω) = ω + j ω = ω (1 + j).

So the inverse Fourier transform would be:

h(t) = F^{-1} { H(jω) } = F^{-1} { ω } + F^{-1} { j ω }.

Which is (-j δ’(t)) ) + (δ’(t)).

So h(t) = [ -j δ’(t) ) + δ’(t) ].

Hmm, but this gives h(t) in terms of derivatives of delta functions, which doesn't match any of the given options. All the options are combinations of delta(t) and exponential functions.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Because the options don't involve derivatives of delta.

Let me check my initial approach again. Maybe I made a mistake in computing H(jω).

Wait, perhaps I should compute H(jω) differently. Let me start over.

Given v_i(t) = 100 cos(ω_o t).

The Fourier transform of v_i(t) is V_i(jω) = 100 * π [ δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o) ].

The current I_i(jω) is given as 100 π [ δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o) ] multiplied by (1 - j)/(2ω).

So when I take H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω), I get:

[100 π (δ terms) ] / [100 π (δ terms) * (1-j)/(2ω) ) ]

So the 100π and δ terms cancel, leaving 1 / [ (1-j)/(2ω) ) ] = 2ω / (1-j).

So H(jω) = 2ω/(1-j).

Hmm, same as before. So maybe I should express this as a function that's easier to inverse Fourier transform.

Let me think: 2ω/(1-j) can be rewritten as 2 (jω)/(j(1-j)) ) → but not sure.

Alternatively, let's factor out j: 1 - j = j ( e^{-j π/4} sqrt(2) ) ).

Wait, perhaps I can write 1/(1-j) as (1 + j)/2, because (1-j)(1+j) = 2, so 1/(1-j) = (1 + j)/2.

So H(jω) = 2ω (1 + j)/2 = ω (1 + j).

Wait, so H(jω) = ω (1 + j).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = (1 + j) ω.

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of ω is related to the derivative of the delta function, but again, the options don't have derivatives. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait a minute. Perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that H(jω) is 2ω/(1-j). Let me re-examine the given I_i(jω):

I_i(jω) = 100 π [ δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o) ] * (1 - j) / (2 ω).

Wait, but the (1-j) is in the numerator, and it's multiplied by these delta functions. But when I compute H(jω) = V_i(jω)/I_i(jω), the V_i(jω) has deltas at ±ω_o, and I_i has the same deltas. So when I take the ratio, the deltas will be non-zero only at those frequencies, but elsewhere zero.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about evaluating H(jω) at ω = ω_o and ω = -ω_o, since the delta functions are zero elsewhere.

So for ω = ω_o, H(jω_o) = V_i(jω_o)/I_i(jω_o).

V_i(jω_o) is 100π * 2 (since δ(ω-ω_o) is 1 there, and δ(ω+ω_o) is 0 because ω is positive). Wait, no, at ω = ω_o, the δ(ω - ω_o) is 1, and δ(ω + ω_o) is 0. So V_i(jω_o) = 100 π * 1.

I_i(jω_o) is 100 π * (1 - j)/(2 ω_o).

So H(jω_o) = (100 π ) / [ 100 π (1 - j)/(2 ω_o) ) ] = (1) / [ (1 - j)/(2 ω_o) ) ] = 2 ω_o / (1 - j).

Similarly, at ω = -ω_o, H(jω) would be 2 (-ω_o)/(1 - j).

Wait, but when I take the inverse Fourier transform, I have to consider all ω. But perhaps using duality, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that H(jω) is a function that's non-zero only at ω = ±ω_o. But that seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the time domain.

If v_i(t) is 100 cos(ω_o t), then the current i_i(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of I_i(jω).

Given I_i(jω) = 100 π [ δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o) ] * (1 - j)/(2 ω).

But wait, the inverse Fourier transform of δ(ω ± ω_o) is e^{j ω_o t} / (2π). So:

i_i(t) = (100 π ) * (1 - j)/(2 ω) * [ δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o) ] → inverse Fourier is:

i_i(t) = 100 π * (1 - j)/(2) * [ e^{j ω_o t} + e^{-j ω_o t} ] / (2π) ) * something.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute i_i(t) as the inverse Fourier transform of I_i(jω).

I_i(jω) = 100π (1 - j) [ δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o
