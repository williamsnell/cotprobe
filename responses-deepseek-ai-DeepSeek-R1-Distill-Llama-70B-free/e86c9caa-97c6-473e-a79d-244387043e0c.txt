Okay, so I've got this logic question here about identifying the antecedent of a conditional proposition. Hmm, let me think. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is: "When the university raises tuition, then either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it." I need to find the antecedent of this conditional statement.

Wait, what's an antecedent again? Oh right, in logic, a conditional statement is usually in the form "If P, then Q," where P is the antecedent (the hypothesis) and Q is the consequent (the conclusion). So the antecedent is the part that comes before the "then."

Looking at the given sentence: it starts with "When the university raises tuition," which seems like the 'if' part. So the structure is "When P, then Q." That would mean P is the antecedent.

So in this case, P is "the university raises tuition." Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this.

Let me glance through the options:

Option B says "The university raises tuition." That sounds exactly like P. So that must be the antecedent.

Just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me double-check. The proposition is structured as a conditional where the first part is the condition. So yes, the antecedent is the condition part before "then."

The antecedent is the condition part of the conditional proposition, which is "the university raises tuition."

Answer: B
