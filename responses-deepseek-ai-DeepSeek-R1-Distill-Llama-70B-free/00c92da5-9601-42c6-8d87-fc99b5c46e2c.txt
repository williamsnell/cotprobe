Okay, so I've got this problem about a separately excited generator. Hmm, I remember that in such generators, the field excitation is separate from the armature. Oh wait, right, so the field winding is connected to a separate DC source. 

The question says the armature voltage is 150 V at 1800 rpm. And I need to find the no-load voltage when the speed changes. No-load voltage—wait, isn't that the induced voltage when there's no current flowing, so it should be the same as the generated EMF, right?

Oh right, for a generator, the induced voltage (E) depends on the magnetic flux, the number of conductors, the speed, and the number of poles. The formula is E = (φZN)/(60A), where φ is flux, Z is number of conductors, N speed in rpm, and A the number of parallel paths. 

But wait, when the speed changes and the field excitation is constant, the flux φ remains the same because the field current is the same. So E should be proportional to the speed N, right? Because all other factors (φ, Z, A) are constant.

So the initial E is 150 V at 1800 rpm. So when speed changes, E changes proportionally.

Part (a) speed increases to 2000 rpm. So the new E would be 150 * (2000/1800). Let me calculate that. 2000/1800 simplifies to 10/9, which is about 1.111. So 150 * 1.111 is 166.666... V. So approximately 166.7 V.

Part (b) speed reduces to 1600 rpm. So E is 150 * (1600/1800). 1600/1800 is 8/9, which is about 0.8889. 150 * 0.8889 is 133.333... V, so around 133.3 V.

Looking at the options, option E is 166.7 V and 133.3 V. So that's the one I need to choose.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. 2000/1800 is 10/9, correct. 150*(10/9) = 150*(1.111) = 166.666. Yes. And 1600/1800 is 8/9, so 150*(8/9)=133.333. Yep, so E is correct.

I think that's right. So the answer should be E.

To calculate the no-load voltage of a separately excited generator under constant field excitation, we use the relationship between the induced voltage \( E \) and the speed \( N \). Since the field excitation is constant, the magnetic flux \( \phi \) remains unchanged. The induced voltage is proportional to the speed, as \( E \propto N \). The formula for the induced voltage is:

\[
E = \frac{\phi Z N}{60A}
\]

Here, \( \phi \), \( Z \), and \( A \) are constants, so \( E \) varies directly with \( N \). Given the initial armature voltage (which equals the induced voltage at no-load) is \( 150 \, \text{V} \) at \( 1800 \, \text{rpm} \), we can calculate the new voltages for the given speed changes.

### Part (a): Speed increases to 2000 rpm
The new voltage is proportional to the new speed:

\[
E = 150 \times \frac{2000}{1800} = 150 \times \frac{10}{9} = 166.666\ldots \, \text{V} \approx 166.7 \, \text{V}
\]

### Part (b): Speed reduces to 1600 rpm
The new voltage is proportional to the new speed:

\[
E = 150 \times \frac{1600}{1800} = 150 \times \frac{8}{9} = 133.333\ldots \, \text{V} \approx 133.3 \, \text{V}
\]

### Final Answer
The no-load voltages for the two cases are approximately \( 166.7 \, \text{V} \) and \( 133.3 \, \text{V} \), which corresponds to **Option E**.
