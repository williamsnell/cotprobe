Question:

In a population of giraffes, an environmental change occurs that favors individuals that are tallest. As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to obtain nutrients and survive to pass along their genetic information. This is an example of

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about giraffes and natural selection. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that in a population of giraffes, there's an environmental change that favors the tallest individuals. Because of this, more of the tall giraffes can get nutrients and survive to pass on their genes. I need to determine what kind of selection this is.

Alright, I remember that natural selection can take different forms. Let me think about the types. There's stabilizing selection, which favors the average traits, making the population more uniform. Then there's directional selection, where a trait at one extreme becomes more common. Oh wait, and disruptive selection, which favors both extremes, creating two distinct groups.

In this case, the environment is favoring the tallest giraffes. So the population is shifting towards having taller individuals over time. That sounds like directional selection because it's moving the population in one direction—taller, in this case.

Wait, could it be sexual selection? No, sexual selection is more about traits that make an individual more attractive to mates, like peacock tails. Here, it's about environmental survival advantage, so probably not sexual selection.

Artificial selection is when humans intervene, like breeding for certain traits. But the question doesn't mention humans, so it's probably not A.

Founder effect and bottleneck effect are types of genetic drift, which involve random changes in allele frequencies due to small population sizes. This scenario is about selection, not random events, so those are out.

Intrasexual selection is a type of sexual selection where members of the same sex compete for mates—like male deer fighting. Again, the question is about survival based on height, not mating competition, so D might not be right.

Kin selection is about helping relatives, which doesn't apply here. So F is probably not the answer.

So putting it all together, the scenario describes directional selection because the environment is pushing the population to have a specific trait—taller giraffes. So the correct answer should be J: directional selection.

The question involves an environmental change favoring taller giraffes, leading to their increased survival and ability to pass on their genes. This scenario aligns with **directional selection**, where natural selection drives the population toward an extreme trait—in this case, taller individuals. Other options like stabilizing selection, disruptive selection, sexual selection, and genetic drift do not fit the described situation. Directional selection is the correct answer as it describes the shift in the population's traits in one direction due to environmental pressures.

Answer: J
