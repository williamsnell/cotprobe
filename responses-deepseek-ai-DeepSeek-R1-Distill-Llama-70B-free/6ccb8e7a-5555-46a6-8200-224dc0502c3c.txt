Okay, so I have this question about Captain Marvel's abilities, and I need to figure out which one isn't one of his powers. The options are A through J, each mentioning different traits from various figures. 

First, I remember that Captain Marvel, specifically the DC Comics version (who is also known as Shazam), gains his powers from various mythological and biblical figures. Each of his abilities comes from a different deity or hero. Let me try to list each one.

The name "Shazam" is an acronym from the initial letters of the gods who grant him his powers. Each letter stands for a different figure. I think it's S for the wisdom of Solomon, H for the strength of Hercules, A for the agility of Atlas? Wait, no, I might be mixing up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the acronym is S.H.A.Z.A.M. Each letter corresponds to a different figure. Let me break it down:

S - Strength of Hercules (or maybe Solomon? No, I think S is for Solomon's wisdom. Wait, no, I might be confused here.)

Wait, I think the breakdown is actually:

S - Strength of Hercules
H - Speed of Hermes? Or is it the wisdom of Solomon? Wait, no, the acronym letters are S, H, A, Z, A, M.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up each option and see which one doesn't fit.

The options are:

A: Strength of Hercules
B: Endurance of Atlas
C: Insight of Athena
D: Speed of Hermes
E: Courage of Achilles
F: Healing of Asclepius
G: Agility of Artemis
H: Wisdom of Solomon
I: Power of Apollo
J: Stealth of Hades

I remember that Shazam's powers come from six specific figures. The original six are Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury (Hermes in Greek). Wait, so let me see:

- Solomon: wisdom
- Hercules: strength
- Atlas: endurance
- Zeus: power (like lightning)
- Achilles: courage
- Mercury (Hermes): speed

So each of these corresponds to the letters S, H, A, Z, A, M? Wait, no, the name Shazam comes from the first letters: S (Solomon), H (Hercules), A (Atlas), Z (Zeus), A (Achilles), M (Mercury, or Hermes). So that's six figures.

So the powers are:

Strength of Hercules (A is correct)
Endurance of Atlas (B is correct)
Insight of Athena (C: Wait, Athena isn't in the original six. The wisdom comes from Solomon, not Athena. So C might be the wrong one.)
Speed of Hermes (D correct)
Courage of Achilles (E correct)
Healing of Asclepius (F: Asclepius isn't one of the sources. So F is not a power.)
Agility of Artemis (G: Artemis isn't one of the sources. So G is wrong)
Wisdom of Solomon (H correct)
Power of Apollo (I: Apollo isn't one of the six. So I is wrong)
Stealth of Hades (J: Hades isn't part of it. So J is wrong)

Wait, but in the original setup, Shazam's powers come from six gods, so any option beyond those six would be incorrect. So the question is which one is NOT an ability.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Strength of Hercules - Yes, that's from S.H.A.Z.A.M. (Hercules)
B: Endurance of Atlas - Yes (Atlas)
C: Insight of Athena - Athena isn't in the six, so this is not an ability.
D: Speed of Hermes - Yes (Hermes)
E: Courage of Achilles - Yes (Achilles)
F: Healing of Asclepius - No, Asclepius isn't part of it.
G: Agility of Artemis - No
H: Wisdom of Solomon - Yes (Solomon)
I: Power of Apollo - No
J: Stealth of Hades - No

But the question is which is NOT one of his abilities. So the correct answer would be any option that's not from the six.

In the options, A is correct, B correct, C incorrect, D correct, E correct, F incorrect, G incorrect, H correct, I incorrect, J incorrect.

So the question is which one is not an ability. The question gives ten options, but only six are correct. So the answer must be one of the incorrect ones.

Looking back, the options are:

Which is NOT one of his abilities.

So, the possible wrong ones are C, F, G, I, J.

Wait, but the choices are A to J. So in the options given, which one is not an ability.

Wait, I thought Shazam's wisdom comes from Solomon, not Athena, so option C is incorrect.

Similarly, the healing power isn't part of his abilities. So F is incorrect.

Wait, but in the original setup, does he have healing? I don't think so. His main powers are strength, speed, endurance, wisdom, courage, and the power of Zeus (lightning). So healing isn't part of it. So F is not an ability.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The six powers are:

1. Wisdom of Solomon: So H is correct.
2. Strength of Hercules: A is correct.
3. Stamina (Endurance) of Atlas: B correct.
4. Power of Zeus: which includes lightning and energy manipulation. So I (Power of Apollo) is not one of them.
5. Courage of Achilles: E correct.
6. Speed of Mercury (Hermes): D correct.

So any option not in these six is not an ability.

Looking at the options:

F: Healing of Asclepius. Asclepius is the god of healing, but Shazam doesn't have healing as one of his powers. So F is not an ability.

Similarly, C is Insight of Athena. Athena is the goddess of wisdom, but Shazam's wisdom comes from Solomon, not Athena. So C is also not an ability.

Wait, but the question is which one is NOT one of his abilities. So both C and F are correct in being not his abilities. But the options are from A to J, and the question is which is not an ability.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some details. Let me double-check.

In the classic Shazam (Captain Marvel), the powers are from six gods:

- S: Solomon's wisdom
- H: Hercules' strength
- A: Atlas' stamina
- Z: Zeus' power (lightning, energy)
- A: Achilles' courage
- M: Mercury's speed

So the six are: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, Mercury.

So the powers are:

- Wisdom (Solomon)
- Strength (Hercules)
- Stamina/Endurance (Atlas)
- Power (Zeus)
- Courage (Achilles)
- Speed (Mercury)

So any option that refers to a different deity's attribute is not part of his powers.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Insight of Athena. Athena is the Greek goddess of wisdom, but Shazam's wisdom comes from Solomon. So C is not one of his abilities.

Option F: Healing of Asclepius. Asclepius is the god of healing, which is not part of Shazam's powers. So F is also not an ability.

So both C and F are not abilities of Shazam. But the question asks which one is not, so perhaps only one is among the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: the strength of Hercules → Yes (S.H.A.Z.A.M. - H is Hercules)

B: the endurance of Atlas → Yes (A is Atlas)

C: the insight of Athena → No, because wisdom comes from Solomon.

D: the speed of Hermes → Yes (Mercury is Hermes in Greek)

E: the courage of Achilles → Yes

F: the healing of Asclepius → No

G: the agility of Artemis → No, because Mercury gives speed, not agility from Artemis.

H: the wisdom of Solomon → Yes

I: the power of Apollo → No, power comes from Zeus.

J: the stealth of Hades → No.

So the correct answer would be any of C, F, G, I, J. But the question is which is not an ability, so I need to pick the one that's listed as an option and is not part of the six.

Looking back at the question, the options are A-J, and the correct answer is the one that is not an ability.

So, the question is which is NOT one of his abilities.

So, for example, option F is the healing of Asclepius, which is not one of his powers.

Option C is insight of Athena, which is also not one of his powers.

So the question is, which option is not an ability. So both C and F are correct in being not abilities.

But wait, the question is multiple-choice, so only one option is correct as the answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the sources. Let me confirm.

In the classic version, Shazam's abilities are:

- Strength of Hercules
- Speed of Mercury (Hermes)
- Stamina of Atlas
- Power of Zeus
- Courage of Achilles
- Wisdom of Solomon

So, Asclepius is not part of it. So F is not an ability.

Athena is also not part of it, so C is not an ability.

But the options given are A-J, so perhaps the question is which is not an ability, and both C and F are correct. But since the options are single-choice, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps in some versions, Captain Marvel has the insight of Athena. Or maybe I'm confusing with another character.

Wait, I think in the original Fawcett Comics, Captain Marvel's powers come from six gods: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. So Athena is not part of it, making option C incorrect.

Similarly, Asclepius isn't part of it, making option F incorrect.

So both C and F are not abilities. But the options are A-J, so perhaps the intended answer is F.

Wait, the question is which is not one of his abilities. So perhaps the correct answer is F: the healing of Asclepius.

Because the other options, like C, might be tricking me. Wait, but Athena's insight isn't part of his powers. So C is also incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for which one is definitely not an ability. Since Asclepius is the god of healing, and Shazam doesn't have healing powers, F is the answer.

Alternatively, Athena isn't part of his powers, so C is also not an ability.

Wait, but the question is asking which is NOT one of his abilities. So if both C and F are not abilities, but the options only list one correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the Marvel Captain Marvel with DC's Shazam. Wait, the question says "superhero Captain Marvel". There are two main Captain Marvels: DC's (formerly Fawcett) and Marvel's (now known as Photon, but originally Captain Marvel as well).

Wait, DC's Captain Marvel is Shazam, who gains powers from the six gods. Marvel's Captain Marvel (like Carol Danvers) has different powers, including flight, strength, speed, etc., but not necessarily tied to mythological figures.

Wait, the question refers to "Captain Marvel", but in the context of the options given (Hercules, Hermes, etc.), it's more likely referring to the DC version, Shazam.

So, going back, the six powers are from S, H, A, Z, A, M. So none of the options beyond those six are correct.

So among the options, F: Healing of Asclepius is not one of his abilities.

Similarly, C: Insight of Athena is also not one of his abilities.

But the question is which is not an ability, so perhaps the answer is F.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of each option.

Option A: Strength of Hercules → Yes, from S.H.A.Z.A.M. So A is a correct ability.

Option B: Endurance of Atlas → Yes, from Atlas. So B is correct.

Option C: Insight of Athena → No, because insight comes from Solomon, not Athena. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Speed of Hermes → Yes, from Mercury (Hermes). So D is correct.

Option E: Courage of Achilles → Yes, from Achilles. So E is correct.

Option F: Healing of Asclepius → No, Shazam doesn't have healing powers. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Agility of Artemis → No, Mercury gives speed, not agility from Artemis. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Wisdom of Solomon → Yes, from S.H.A.Z.A.M. So H is correct.

Option I: Power of Apollo → No, power comes from Zeus. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Stealth of Hades → No, Shazam doesn't have stealth. So J is incorrect.

So the options that are not abilities are C, F, G, I, J.

But the question is asking which is not one of his abilities. So the correct answer would be one of these.

Looking back at the question, the options are A-J, and the correct answer is the one that's not an ability.

In the context of the question, perhaps the intended answer is F: the healing of Asclepius.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is C: the insight of Athena, since the wisdom comes from Solomon, not Athena.

Wait, but "insight" could be considered part of wisdom, which is from Solomon. So perhaps the question is trying to trick you into thinking Athena is the source, but it's actually Solomon.

So, the correct answer would be C: the insight of Athena.

But I'm a bit confused because both C and F are not abilities. However, the question likely expects one answer, so perhaps F is the intended answer because healing is a distinct power not associated with Shazam.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Marvel version of Captain Marvel, but I don't think so because the options are based on Greek mythology, which aligns more with DC's Shazam.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers. Her powers include flight, strength, speed, energy projection, etc. But she doesn't have abilities tied to mythological figures, so all the options would be incorrect. But that doesn't make sense because the options are all from mythology.

No, the question must be about DC's Shazam.

So, in that case, the answer is either C or F.

But I think the intended answer is F: the healing of Asclepius, because Shazam doesn't have healing powers. The wisdom comes from Solomon, so C's insight of Athena is not part of his abilities, but perhaps the question is more straightforward with F.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F because healing isn't part of his powers, while insight is a form of wisdom, which he does have, but from Solomon, not Athena.

Wait, but the question is about which is not an ability, so any of the options not from the six sources is correct. So both C and F are correct in being not abilities, but the question expects one answer.

I think I need to choose the option that's clearly not part of the six. Since Asclepius is not among the six, F is the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way: perhaps the answer is F because the others are all part of his powers except one.

Wait, let me count the options again. The six correct ones are A (Hercules), B (Atlas), D (Hermes), E (Achilles), H (Solomon), and I (Zeus). Wait, no, I is power of Apollo, which isn't correct. So perhaps I is incorrect.

Wait, no. The power comes from Zeus, not Apollo. So I is incorrect.

So, to sum up, the options that are not abilities are C, F, G, I, J.

But the question is which is not, so I have to pick one.

Looking at the options, F: the healing of Asclepius is not one of his abilities.

So I think the correct answer is F.

To determine which option is not one of superhero Captain Marvel's (Shazam) abilities, we analyze the powers he derives from the six mythological and biblical figures represented by the acronym **S.H.A.Z.A.M.**:

1. **S** - Wisdom of Solomon  
2. **H** - Strength of Hercules  
3. **A** - Stamina/Endurance of Atlas  
4. **Z** - Power of Zeus  
5. **A** - Courage of Achilles  
6. **M** - Speed of Mercury (Hermes in Greek mythology)  

Based on this, the abilities of Shazam include:  
- Strength of Hercules (A)  
- Endurance of Atlas (B)  
- Speed of Hermes (D)  
- Courage of Achilles (E)  
- Wisdom of Solomon (H)  

The following options are **not** part of Shazam's abilities:  
- **C: Insight of Athena** (wisdom comes from Solomon, not Athena)  
- **F: Healing of Asclepius** (Shazam does not have healing powers)  
- **G: Agility of Artemis** (agility is not one of his powers)  
- **I: Power of Apollo** (power comes from Zeus, not Apollo)  
- **J: Stealth of Hades** (stealth is not one of his abilities)  

Among these, **F: the healing of Asclepius** is the most clearly distinct and unrelated to Shazam's powers, as healing is not part of his abilities.  

**Answer: F**
