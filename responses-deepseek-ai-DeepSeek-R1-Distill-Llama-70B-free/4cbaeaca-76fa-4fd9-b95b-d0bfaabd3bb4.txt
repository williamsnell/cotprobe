Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

The problem states that there's a rigid tank containing 1 lbm of air and 0.2 lbm of saturated water vapor at 250°F. I need to find the volume of the tank and the total pressure of the air-vapor mixture. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

First, I should recall that when dealing with mixtures of gases, especially air and water vapor, we can treat them as ideal gases and apply Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. Dalton's Law says that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each component. So, P_total = P_air + P_vapor.

Wait, but wait. The tank is rigid, meaning its volume doesn't change. But the problem doesn't mention anything about the process being isothermal or isobaric, so maybe the temperature is given, which is 250°F. Hmm, I should convert that to Rankine because we're probably using the ideal gas law in English units. Right? So, 250°F is 250 + 459.67 = 709.67 °R.

Next, I need to find the volume of the tank. Since both air and water vapor are present, I can calculate the volume contributed by each and then add them, but wait, actually, since the tank's volume is the same for both, maybe I should find the volume using each and then see if they match. Or perhaps it's better to treat them together.

Wait, but the ideal gas law is PV = mRT. So for each component, I can write their own equation. But since the volume is the same for both, maybe I can find the total mass and use that to find V. Let me think.

Wait, but air and water vapor are both gases, so their specific gases have different R values. Oh right, the gas constant R is different for air and water vapor. So I need to compute the volume for each separately and then add them? Or wait, no. Since the volume is the same, maybe I can write the ideal gas equation for each, sum their pressures, but calculate their individual contributions to the volume.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the total mass as 1.2 lbm (1 of air, 0.2 of vapor), but wait no, because each has its own R. So I think the approach is to compute the volume for each component separately using their respective R values and then ensure that the volumes are the same because the tank is rigid. Wait, but that would require the pressures to add up in a certain way. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the volume using each component's mass, temperature, and R, and then equate them because the volume is the same. Let me try that.

Wait, no, because each component (air and vapor) contributes their own partial pressure, but the volume of the tank is the same for both. So for air: P_air * V = m_air * R_air * T. Similarly, for vapor: P_vapor * V = m_vapor * R_vapor * T.

Wait, that makes sense. So I can write for air: V = (m_air * R_air * T) / P_air. For vapor: V = (m_vapor * R_water_vapor * T) / P_vapor. Since V is the same, I can set them equal:

(m_air * R_air * T) / P_air = (m_vapor * R_water_vapor * T) / P_vapor.

But I don't know P_air or P_vapor yet. However, I know that the total pressure P_total = P_air + P_vapor.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe instead, I should calculate the volume contributed by each mass, considering their respective R values, and then sum them. Wait, no. Because both are in the same volume, so each contributes to the pressure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the volume using the sum of the moles or something. Wait, but I'm given masses, not moles.

Wait, maybe I should first find the moles of each. Because the ideal gas law can also be written as PV = nRT, where n is moles. So for each component:

n_air = m_air / M_air
n_vapor = m_vapor / M_vapor

M_air is the molecular weight of air, which is about 28.97 lbm/lbmol, and M_vapor for water is about 18.015 lbm/lbmol.

So, n_air = 1 lbm / 28.97 lbm/lbmol ≈ 0.0345 lbmol.
n_vapor = 0.2 lbm / 18.015 lbm/lbmol ≈ 0.0111 lbmol.

Then, the total moles, n_total = 0.0345 + 0.0111 ≈ 0.0456 lbmol.

If I use the ideal gas law for the total mixture, P_total * V = n_total * R_universal * T.

Wait, but R_universal is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R). So using that, I can compute V = (n_total * R_universal * T) / P_total. But I don't know P_total yet, so maybe that's not the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the volume for each component separately and then add them, but that doesn't make sense because the volume is the same. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Since both air and vapor are in the same volume and temperature, their partial pressures can be found by considering their own masses and R values.

So, for air:

P_air = (m_air * R_air * T) / V

Similarly, for vapor:

P_vapor = (m_vapor * R_water * T) / V

The specific gas constants R for air and water vapor are different. I think R_air is 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), but wait, sometimes it's given in terms of other units. Let me make sure.

Wait, in English units, R for air is 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), and R for water vapor is 85.78 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). I think that's correct.

So, P_air = (1 lbm * 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R)) * 709.67 R) / V

Similarly, P_vapor = (0.2 lbm * 85.78 ft·lbf/(lbm·R)) * 709.67 R) / V

Let me compute each numerator:

For air:

1 * 53.35 * 709.67 = Let's compute 53.35 * 700 is approximately 53.35 * 700 = 37,345. Then 53.35*9.67 ≈ around 516. So total around 37,861 ft·lbf.

Wait, more accurately:

53.35 * 709.67.

Let me compute 53.35 * 700 = 37,345.

53.35 * 9.67 = 53.35*(10 - 0.33) = 533.5 - 17.64 ≈ 515.86.

So total is 37,345 + 515.86 = 37,860.86 ft·lbf.

So P_air = (37,860.86) / V.

Similarly for vapor:

0.2 * 85.78 * 709.67.

First compute 85.78 * 709.67.

Again, 85.78 * 700 = 60,046.

85.78 * 9.67 ≈ 85 * 9.67 = 821.45, plus 0.78*9.67 ≈ 7.53, so total ≈ 829. So total is 60,046 + 829 ≈ 60,875.

Multiply by 0.2: 60,875 * 0.2 = 12,175 ft·lbf.

So P_vapor = (12,175) / V.

So total pressure P_total = P_air + P_vapor = (37,860.86 + 12,175) / V = (50,035.86)/V.

Wait, but I don't know V yet. Hmm. So how can I find V?

Wait, perhaps I can express V in terms of the total pressure. But I don't know P_total. Alternatively, maybe I can find V by considering the sum of the individual volumes if they were at their partial pressures. Wait, that might not help.

Wait, another approach: Since I have P_total = (50,035.86)/V, I can also compute the total pressure using the ideal gas law for the entire mixture. Let me think. The total mass is 1.2 lbm. Wait, but air and vapor have different R values, so I can't directly apply the ideal gas law to the total mass unless I find an equivalent R for the mixture.

Ah, right. The equivalent R for the mixture can be found by considering the mole fractions or mass fractions. But since we have the masses and molecular weights, maybe we can compute the mole fractions.

Wait, earlier I calculated the moles: n_air ≈ 0.0345 lbmol, n_vapor ≈ 0.0111 lbmol. So total moles n_total ≈ 0.0456 lbmol.

The mole fraction of air (chi_air) is 0.0345 / 0.0456 ≈ 0.756.

Mole fraction of vapor (chi_vapor) is 0.0111 / 0.0456 ≈ 0.243.

Then, the equivalent R for the mixture is R_mix = chi_air*R_air + chi_vapor*R_vapor. Wait, but wait, R for each gas is based on their molar masses. Alternatively, I think the correct approach is to find the mass-based R for the mixture using the mole fractions.

Wait, actually, the specific gas constant R is given by R = R_universal / M. So for each gas, R_air = R_u / M_air, and R_vapor = R_u / M_vapor.

So the mixture's R would be based on the mole fractions. Wait, maybe it's better to compute the apparent molecular weight of the mixture.

Wait, the apparent molecular weight M_mix can be found as 1/( (n_air/M_air) + (n_vapor/M_vapor) ) * (n_air + n_vapor). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, I think it's the harmonic mean based on moles.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The total moles are n_total. The mass is m_total = 1.2 lbm.

So M_mix = m_total / n_total = 1.2 lbm / 0.0456 lbmol ≈ 26.3158 lbm/lbmol.

Wait, that seems reasonable because air is about 29 and vapor is 18, so the mixture is somewhere in between.

Then, R_mix = R_u / M_mix. R_u is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Wait, no, R_u is 10.7316 for lbmol units, but when using R for mass units, it's R = R_u / M.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the units. The specific gas constant R for a substance is R = R_u / M, where M is molecular weight in lbm/lbmol. So for the mixture, R_mix = R_u / M_mix.

So R_mix = 10.7316 / 26.3158 ≈ 0.4078 psi·ft³/(lbm·R).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way to compute R for the mixture. Maybe I should use the mass fractions instead.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total pressure using the sum of the partial pressures, which we have as P_total = (50,035.86)/V.

But then, using the ideal gas law for the entire mixture, P_total * V = m_total * R_mix * T.

So substituting P_total from earlier, (50,035.86/V) * V = 1.2 lbm * R_mix * 709.67 R.

So 50,035.86 = 1.2 * R_mix * 709.67.

Solving for R_mix: R_mix = 50,035.86 / (1.2 * 709.67) ≈ 50,035.86 / (851.2) ≈ 58.8 ft·lbf/(lbm·R).

Wait, but earlier I thought R_mix would be around 0.4078 psi·ft³/(lbm·R). Hmm, there's a unit discrepancy here. Let me check the units again.

Wait, R in ft·lbf/(lbm·R) and R in psi·ft³/(lbm·R). I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, 1 psi = 144 psf = 144 lb/ft². And 1 ft·lbf is equivalent to 1 lb·ft.

Wait, perhaps I should convert R_mix into consistent units. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the volume by equating the two expressions for V from each component.

Wait, earlier I wrote V = (m_air * R_air * T) / P_air for air, and similarly V = (m_vapor * R_vapor * T) / P_vapor. Since V is the same, set them equal:

(m_air * R_air * T) / P_air = (m_vapor * R_vapor * T) / P_vapor.

Cancel T:

(m_air * R_air)/P_air = (m_vapor * R_vapor)/P_vapor.

=> (1 lbm *53.35)/(P_air) = (0.2 lbm *85.78)/P_vapor.

=> (53.35)/(P_air) = (17.156)/P_vapor.

So P_vapor = P_air * (17.156)/53.35 ≈ P_air * 0.3218.

So P_vapor ≈ 0.3218 P_air.

And since P_total = P_air + P_vapor = P_air (1 + 0.3218) = 1.3218 P_air.

So P_air = P_total / 1.3218.

Similarly, P_vapor = 0.3218 P_total.

Now, using the ideal gas law for air: P_air V = m_air R_air T.

So V = (m_air R_air T) / P_air.

Substituting P_air from above:

V = (1 lbm *53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R) *709.67 R) / (P_total / 1.3218).

So V = (53.35 *709.67 *1.3218) / P_total.

Compute numerator: 53.35 *709.67 ≈ 37,860 as before, times 1.3218.

37,860 * 1.3218 ≈ Let's compute 37,860 *1 = 37,860 and 37,860 *0.3218 ≈ 12,190. So total ≈ 50,050.

So V ≈ 50,050 / P_total.

Similarly, using the vapor equation: P_vapor V = m_vapor R_vapor T.

V = (0.2 lbm *85.78 *709.67) / P_vapor.

But P_vapor = 0.3218 P_total.

So V = (0.2 *85.78 *709.67) / (0.3218 P_total).

Compute numerator: 0.2 *85.78 = 17.156; 17.156 *709.67 ≈ 12,175. So numerator is 12,175.

So V = 12,175 / (0.3218 P_total) ≈ 12,175 / (0.3218 P_total) ≈ 37,860 / P_total.

Wait, but earlier I had V ≈ 50,050 / P_total. That's a problem because they should give the same V.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Because from air, V is 50,050 / P_total, and from vapor, it's 37,860 / P_total. That can't be right because V must be the same. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check the earlier steps.

Wait, I think I messed up when substituting P_air in the expression for V. Let me go back.

From the equality of V:

(m_air R_air T)/P_air = (m_vapor R_vapor T)/P_vapor.

Cancel T:

(1 *53.35)/P_air = (0.2 *85.78)/P_vapor.

So, 53.35 / P_air = 17.156 / P_vapor.

So, P_vapor = (17.156 /53.35) P_air ≈ 0.3218 P_air.

So P_total = P_air + 0.3218 P_air = 1.3218 P_air.

Thus, P_air = P_total / 1.3218.

Now, using the ideal gas law for air:

P_air V = m_air R_air T.

V = (1 *53.35 *709.67) / P_air.

Substituting P_air:

V = (53.35 *709.67) / (P_total / 1.3218) ) = (53.35 *709.67 * 1.3218) / P_total.

Compute numerator:

53.35 *709.67 = 37,860.86.

37,860.86 *1.3218 ≈ 37,860.86 *1.3 = ~49,200 and 37,860.86 *0.0218≈ 825. So total ≈ 50,025.

So V ≈ 50,025 / P_total.

Similarly, for vapor:

P_vapor V = m_vapor R_vapor T.

V = (0.2 *85.78 *709.67) / P_vapor.

But P_vapor = 0.3218 P_total.

So V = (12,175) / (0.3218 P_total) ≈ 37,860 / P_total.

Wait, so according to air, V is about 50,025 / P_total, and according to vapor, V is 37,860 / P_total. But these two can't both be true unless P_total adjusts to make them equal. But that's impossible unless both equations are consistent, which they aren't. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think: maybe I can find the total pressure using the sum of the partial pressures and then compute the volume.

Alternatively,
