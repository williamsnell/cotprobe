Question:

Mr. Johnson, who already has a $20,000 annual salary, has purchased land for $8,000 and a house on the land for $50,000. He expects to sell the property in ten years. For the first 3 years, Johnson expects rent income from the property to be $7,000 and expenses to be $2,700. For the next 7 years, revenue will be $10,000 and expenses, $3,500. Johnson will deduct a 2% depreciation allowance on the building from his taxable incomes. If Johnson sells this property after 10 years for $61,500, what percent of his $58,000 investment will he have gained or lost from the rental and sales incomes? The current interest rate is 7%. The tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary, are: Income Rate On the first $4,00033.44% = 0.3344 On the second $4,00037.84% = 0.3784 On the third $4,00041.36% = 0.4136 On the fourth $4,00044% = 0.44 On the fifth $4,00046.64% = 0.4664

Options:

A: 2.9%
B: 1.84%
C: -1.5%
D: 2.5%
E: 4.2%
F: 5.7%

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Mr. Johnson's investment. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

Mr. Johnson has a $20,000 annual salary. He bought land for $8,000 and a house on it for $50,000. So his total investment is $58,000. He plans to sell the property after 10 years. 

For the first 3 years, he expects rental income of $7,000 each year and expenses of $2,700. Then, for the next 7 years, the rent goes up to $10,000 a year with expenses of $3,500. 

He can deduct a 2% depreciation allowance on the building each year from his taxable income. So that's 2% of $50,000, which is $1,000 per year. 

When he sells the property after 10 years for $61,500, I think that's the selling price. He wants to know what percent gain or loss he made on his $58,000 investment, considering both the rental income and the sale proceeds. Also, the interest rate is 7%, which I think is the discount rate for the net present value calculation.

The tax rates are a bit complicated. They apply to his income from the rental and the sale, beyond his $20k salary. The rates are in brackets: the first $4k at 33.44%, next $4k at 37.84%, then 41.36%, 44%, and 46.64% for the fifth $4k. 

So, I think I need to calculate the net cash flow each year from the rental, after taxes and depreciation, and then the cash flow from the sale after 10 years, also accounting for taxes. Then, discount all these cash flows back to present value using the 7% interest rate and compare the total present value to the initial investment to find the percentage gain or loss.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, initial investment is $58,000 (8k land +50k house). He can't depreciate the land, only the building. So each year, depreciation is 2% of 50k, which is $1,000.

For each year, I'll calculate the rental income, subtract expenses and depreciation to get taxable income. Then apply the tax rates to that taxable income to find the taxes owed. Then, the net cash flow after taxes for each year would be (rental income - expenses) minus taxes, plus depreciation? Wait, no. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it affects taxable income but not cash flow. So the cash flow before tax is (rent - expenses), then subtract taxes on the taxable income (which is (rent - expenses - depreciation)).

So for each year, the process is:

1. Calculate rental income minus operating expenses: that's the cash flow before depreciation and taxes.
2. Subtract depreciation to get taxable income.
3. Calculate taxes on taxable income based on the given brackets.
4. Subtract taxes from the cash flow before depreciation and taxes to get net cash flow.

Wait, no. The cash flow from operations would be (rent - expenses) which is before depreciation. But depreciation is a non-cash expense, so the taxable income is (rent - expenses - depreciation). Then, the taxes are calculated on that taxable income. So the net cash flow is (rent - expenses) - taxes.

But wait, I think I might have that wrong. Let me think again. Cash flow from operations is usually calculated as EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) plus depreciation. But in this case, since we're calculating it for tax purposes, maybe it's different.

Wait, perhaps the cash flow is (rent - expenses) which is the pre-tax cash flow. Then, the taxable income is (rent - expenses - depreciation). Taxes are calculated on that. So the net cash flow after tax would be (rent - expenses) - (taxes on (rent - expenses - depreciation)).

Yes, that makes sense. Because the depreciation reduces the taxable income, which in turn reduces the taxes paid. So the cash flow is the pre-tax cash flow minus the taxes, but the taxes are based on a lower income due to depreciation.

So for each year, for the first 3 years:

Rental income: $7,000
Expenses: $2,700
Depreciation: $1,000

So, taxable income each year is (7,000 - 2,700 - 1,000) = $3,300

Now, applying the tax rates: the first $4k is taxed at 33.44%, etc. But taxable income is $3,300, so only the first bracket applies for the first $4k, but the income is less than that. Wait, no, the brackets are as follows: the first $4k of income beyond the $20k salary. Wait, wait, the question says: the tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20k salary.

Wait, so his salary is $20k. His total income from other sources (rental and sale) would be added to that. So the tax brackets apply to the sum of rental income and sale proceeds, beyond the $20k. Hmm, that complicates things because the sale is in year 10, so the taxable income from the sale would be in that year.

But wait, in each year, he has rental income. So each year, his total income is 20k + rental income. But when we calculate the taxes on the rental income, it's based on the brackets that apply to the amount beyond 20k. So, for each year, the taxable income from the rental is added to his salary, and the tax is calculated on that. But wait, the problem says the tax rates apply to the rental and sales income beyond the $20k salary. So the rental income is considered as additional income, and it's taxed according to those brackets.

Wait, maybe I need to model each year's taxable income as 20k + (rental income - expenses - depreciation). Then, the part of that which is above 20k is taxed according to the given brackets. But that's complicated because each year's taxable income would be 20k + (rent - expenses - depreciation). 

Wait, no. The way the question is phrased: "the tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary are..." So the rental and sales income are considered as income beyond the $20k, and the tax brackets apply to that amount. So for example, if rental income after expenses and depreciation is $3,300, then that $3,300 is taxed at the given rates. But I think the brackets are applied per each year's rental income and then the sale's gain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: each year, the rental income after expenses and depreciation is a certain amount, say X. That X is considered as income beyond the 20k, so it's taxed according to the given brackets. So for each year, we calculate the tax on X, which is the taxable rental income.

Wait, the problem says: "the tax rates applied to rental and sales income, above and beyond the $20,000 salary are:..." So the rental income and sales proceeds are the income that are subject to these tax brackets. So for each year, the rental income (after operating expenses and depreciation) is added to his salary to compute taxable income. But the brackets apply only to the amount above $20k. So, for example, if in a year, the rental after expenses and depreciation is $3,300, then his total taxable income is $23,300, and the amount above $20k, which is $3,300, is taxed according to the brackets.

So the first $4k is taxed at 33.44%, but since $3,300 is less than $4k, all of it is taxed at 33.44%. Similarly, in years where the rental income after expenses and depreciation is higher, more brackets would apply.

Wait, but looking at the numbers: for the first 3 years, the taxable income from rental is $3,300 each year. For the next 7 years, let's calculate that. 

In years 4-10: rental income is $10k, expenses $3.5k, so taxable income before depreciation is 10k - 3.5k = 6.5k, minus depreciation 1k, so 5.5k taxable income per year.

So, for each of these years, the taxable income is $5,500. Then, the first $4k is taxed at 33.44%, the next $1.5k (since 5.5k is 4k +1.5k) at 37.84%.

Wait, the brackets are:

- First $4k: 33.44%
- Next $4k: 37.84%
- Next $4k: 41.36%
- Next $4k:44%
- Next $4k:46.64%

So for a taxable income of $3,300, all taxed at 33.44%. For $5,500: first $4k at 33.44%, next $1.5k at 37.84%.

So the tax for each year would be calculated as follows.

Now, let's compute the taxes for each year.

First 3 years (year 1-3):

Each year: taxable income = $3,300.

Tax = 3,300 * 0.3344 = let's compute that. 3,300 * 0.3344 = 1,104.72. So taxes are $1,104.72 each year.

So the net cash flow after tax for each of the first 3 years would be:

Rental income - expenses = 7,000 - 2,700 = $4,300.

Then subtract taxes: 4,300 - 1,104.72 = $3,195.28 per year.

Wait, but wait. The $4,300 is the pre-tax cash flow, which is (rent - expenses). The taxable income is (rent - expenses - depreciation) = 3,300. So taxes are 1,104.72. Then, the net cash flow is (rent - expenses) minus taxes. So yes, 4,300 - 1,104.72 = 3,195.28.

So for each of the first 3 years, net cash flow is $3,195.28.

Now, years 4-10: 7 years.

Each year: rental income $10k, expenses $3.5k, depreciation $1k.

So taxable income = 10k -3.5k -1k = $5.5k.

Now, applying the tax brackets:

First $4k: 0.3344 → 4,000 *0.3344=1,337.6

Next $1.5k: 0.3784 →1,500 *0.3784=567.6

Total tax per year: 1,337.6 +567.6= $1,905.2.

So the cash flow before taxes is (10k -3.5k)=6.5k.

Then subtract taxes: 6,500 -1,905.2= $4,594.8 per year.

So for each of years 4-10, net cash flow is $4,594.8.

Now, after 10 years, he sells the property for $61,500. So the selling price is $61.5k. What's the tax on the sale?

Wait, the sale proceeds are $61.5k. The original cost was $58k ($8k land + $50k house). So the gain is 61.5k -58k=3.5k. But wait, land and building are separate. Land isn't depreciated, but the building is.

Wait, the building was $50k, and each year 2% depreciation is taken, so over 10 years, depreciation is 10 *1k=10k. So the book value of the building is 50k -10k=40k. The land remains at 8k.

So when he sells, the total cost basis is 8k (land) +40k (building) =48k.

So the selling price is 61.5k. So the gain is 61.5k -48k=13.5k.

So the gain on sale is $13,500. This gain is taxable. But how is it taxed?

I think the gain on real estate is taxed as capital gains. But the problem says that the sales income is subject to the same tax rates as the rental income, beyond the 20k salary.

Wait, but the problem says the tax rates apply to rental and sales income beyond the 20k salary. So the gain from the sale is $13.5k, which is added to his other income (which in year 10 would include the rental income for that year).

Wait, no. Wait, in year 10, he sells the property, so he would have rental income for that year, and the sale's gain. So his total income in year 10 is 20k (salary) + rental income (10k) - expenses (3.5k) - depreciation (1k) → 10k-3.5k-1k=5.5k, plus the gain on sale of 13.5k.

Wait, but wait: the gain on sale is 13.5k, which is a one-time income. So his total taxable income from all sources in year 10 is 20k (salary) + 5.5k (rental) +13.5k (gain) = 39k.

But according to the problem, the tax rates apply to the rental and sales income beyond the 20k. So the 5.5k rental income and 13.5k gain are the ones subject to the tax brackets. So the total subject to tax is 5.5k +13.5k=19k.

Wait, but that's more than the brackets. Let me see. The brackets are:

First $4k: 33.44%

Next $4k:37.84%

Next $4k:41.36%

Next $4k:44%

Next $4k:46.64%

So for $19k, the breakdown is:

- 4k at 33.44%

- 4k at 37.84%

- 4k at 41.36%

- 4k at 44%

- Remaining 3k at 46.64%?

Wait, wait, 4+4+4+4=16k, so 19k-16k=3k in the fifth bracket.

So the tax calculation would be:

4,000 *0.3344 = 1,337.6

4,000 *0.3784=1,513.6

4,000 *0.4136=1,654.4

4,000 *0.44=1,760

3,000 *0.4664=1,399.2

Adding these up:

1,337.6 +1,513.6=2,851.2

+1,654.4=4,505.6

+1,760=6,265.6

+1,399.2=7,664.8.

So total tax on the $19k is $7,664.8.

Wait, but is the gain on sale considered as part of the income subject to these brackets? Or is it treated differently? The problem says that the tax rates apply to rental and sales income beyond the 20k salary. So yes, the gain is part of that.

So in year 10, the net cash flow from the sale is the selling price minus the cost basis. But the cost basis is 48k (as calculated earlier), so selling price is 61.5k, so cash received is 61.5k, but the gain is 13.5k, which is taxable. So the after-tax cash flow from the sale would be 61.5k - (tax on 13.5k). Wait, no. Wait, the total gain is 13.5k, which is part of the income beyond the 20k, so the tax is calculated on the entire 19k (5.5k rental +13.5k gain). So the tax in year 10 is 7,664.8.

Wait, but the rental income in year 10 is 10k, expenses 3.5k, depreciation 1k, so taxable rental is 5.5k. Plus the gain of 13.5k, so total taxable income beyond 20k is 19k. So the tax is 7,664.8.

So the net cash flow in year 10 is:

Rental cash flow: (10k -3.5k) =6.5k

Plus sale proceeds:61.5k

Minus tax on the 19k:7,664.8

So total cash flow for year 10 is 6.5k +61.5k -7,664.8 = (6.5k +61.5k)=68k -7,664.8=60,335.2.

Wait, but wait: the sale proceeds are 61.5k, which includes the return of the cost basis (48k). So the cash flow from the sale is 61.5k (received) minus the tax on the gain. Alternatively, the gain is 13.5k, taxed at the applicable rate, so taxes paid on the gain would be part of the total tax for the year.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify.

In year 10, the cash flows are:

1. Rental income:10k, expenses:3.5k → cash flow from rental:6.5k.

2. Sale of property: sells for 61.5k. His cost basis is 48k (8k land +40k building). So the gain is 13.5k.

So the total cash flow from the sale is 61.5k received. But he has to pay taxes on the 13.5k gain, which is part of his taxable income.

His total taxable income in year 10 is 20k (salary) + (10k-3.5k-1k)=5.5k rental +13.5k gain → total 39k. But the tax brackets apply only to the 19k beyond the 20k (5.5k +13.5k=19k).

So the tax on the 19k is as calculated before, $7,664.8.

So the net cash flow for year 10 would be:

From rental:6.5k

From sale:61.5k

Minus taxes:7,664.8

So total:6.5k +61.5k =68k → 68k -7,664.8=60,335.2
