Question:

A company has a permit to mine for gold in a region of New Mexico for 3 years. Management is trying to decide how to finance the machinery. One option is to rent it for $130 per month over the three years. The deal includes the fuel needed to operate the equipment. The other option is to buy the equipment now and. it after three years. The machinery costs $11,500. There is a down payment of $2,500, so that the balance due will be $11,500 - $2,500 = $9,000. This balance will be covered by a 5(1/2)% loan to be paid in equal annual installments over 15 years. The annual fuel costs for the equipment would be $375. If the minimum attractive rate of return is 5%, at what resale value (end of third year) will both options be equally economical? Make all calculations to the nearest dollar.

Hmm, okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this kind of finance stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, so there's a company that has a permit to mine gold for three years in New Mexico. They need to decide how to finance the machinery. They have two options: rent it for three years or buy it now and then maybe sell it after three years. The question is, at what resale value will both options be equally economical, given a minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) of 5%.

Let me break down the details.

First, the renting option: it's $130 per month over three years, and that includes the fuel. So that's straightforward. Each month they pay $130, and that covers the equipment and fuel.

The other option is to buy the machinery. The cost is $11,500. They have to make a down payment of $2,500, so the balance is $9,000. This balance is covered by a loan at 5.5% interest, to be paid in equal annual installments over 15 years. Also, there are annual fuel costs of $375. So, if they choose to buy, they have these upfront and ongoing costs, but after three years, they can sell the machinery for some resale value, which we need to find.

The goal is to find the resale value that makes both options equally economical. So, the present worth (or net present value) of both options should be equal at the MARR of 5%.

I think the approach here is to calculate the present worth of each option and set them equal, then solve for the resale value. Let me outline the steps.

For the renting option:
- It's a monthly payment, $130, for 36 months. I can calculate the present worth of these payments using the present worth factor for a series (Uniform Series Present Worth). Since it's monthly, I might need to adjust the interest rate to a monthly rate or convert the payments to annual.

Wait, the MARR is given as 5% annually. So, for the present worth calculations, I should use 5% per year. But the rent is paid monthly. Hmm. So maybe I should convert the monthly payments to an equivalent annual payment first, then compute the present worth for three years.

Alternatively, I can compute the present worth using the monthly rate. Let me think. Since the payments are monthly, the interest rate per period is 5% divided by 12. So, 0.05/12 ≈ 0.0041667 per month. Then, the present worth of the rent payments would be the monthly payment multiplied by the present worth factor for an ordinary annuity (since payments are at the end of each month).

But wait, the period here is three years, or 36 months. So the number of periods is 36. So the present worth of the rent is 130 multiplied by the present worth of an annuity of 36 periods at 0.05/12 per period.

Alternatively, if I want to keep everything annual, I can calculate the equivalent annual cost of renting. But perhaps it's easier to compute the present worth directly in monthly terms.

But maybe I should just proceed with annual calculations since the other option has annual payments and the loan is over 15 years, which is an annual payment. Maybe converting everything to annual would make it easier.

Wait, the rent is $130 per month. So that's 130 * 12 = $1,560 per year. But for three years, we can model this as an annuity. So the present worth of the renting option would be the present worth of an annuity of $1,560 per year for three years at 5% interest.

Wait, but wait, the payments are monthly, so each year's payment is $1,560, but when calculating present worth, it's better to use the monthly rate and monthly periods. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the present worth of the renting option as a monthly annuity and the other option with annual payments, then compare both present worths, considering the resale value as a future value that needs to be discounted.

Let me structure this.

Option 1: Renting
- Monthly payment: $130 for 36 months. So the present worth (PW) is 130 * (P/A, i=0.05/12, n=36).

Option 2: Buying
- Initial down payment: $2,500 (immediate cost)
- Loan: $9,000 at 5.5% over 15 years. So annual payments are calculated as (9,000)*(A/P, 5.5%,15).
- Annual fuel cost: $375 per year for three years. So that's an annuity of 375 per year for three years at 5%.
- Resale value after three years: let's call this S. This is a future amount that needs to be discounted to present worth.

So the PW for buying is: initial down payment + PW of loan payments + PW of fuel costs - PW of resale value.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial down payment is a present cost. The loan is being taken, so the company is paying back the loan, but the $9,000 is a loan. So perhaps the initial outlay is $2,500 (down payment), and then the loan is $9,000. But when you take a loan, you receive $9,000 now, but have to pay it back over time. So for present worth purposes, the initial outlay is $2,500, and the loan payments are an annuity that you pay each year. But the loan payments are in the future, so their present worth is calculated as a series of payments. Similarly, the resale value is a future amount received, so it's a cash inflow that will be discounted.

So the present worth for buying is:

PW_buy = Down payment + PW of loan payments + PW of fuel costs - PW of resale value.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The initial cost is $2,500 (a cash outflow at time zero).

The loan gives them $9,000 at time zero, but they have to repay it over 15 years with annual payments. So the present worth of the loan is the present worth of the payments, but since they're receiving $9,000, it's a present value that's a benefit, but the payments are costs. Alternatively, perhaps the net present worth is to treat the $9,000 loan as a cash inflow, and then subtract the present worth of the loan payments. Because when you take a loan, you get the money now, but have to pay it back with interest.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this differently.

The total cost of buying is:

- Down payment now: $2,500 (cash outflow)
- Loan to be paid over 15 years: the annual payments are calculated as (9,000) * (A/P, 5.5%,15). The (A/P) factor gives the annual payment per dollar of loan.
- Fuel costs each year for three years: $375, so an annuity of 3 years.
- At the end of three years, they sell the equipment for S, which is a cash inflow.

So the present worth of all these cash flows should equal the present worth of the renting option.

So, let's break it down.

First, compute the present worth for renting.

Renting: $130 per month for 36 months. So that's an annuity of 36 periods. The interest rate is 5% per year, so monthly rate is 0.05/12 ≈ 0.00416667.

The present worth factor for an ordinary annuity (P/A, i, n) is [1 - (1 + i)^-n ] / i.

So P/A for 36 months at 0.05/12 is [1 - (1 + 0.05/12)^-36 ] / (0.05/12).

Let me calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the present worth using the formula:

PW_rent = 130 * [1 - (1 + 0.05/12)^-36 ] / (0.05/12)

But calculating that might be a bit tedious without a calculator, but perhaps I can find the present worth factor from tables or approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert the monthly payments to an annual equivalent. Since each year has 12 payments, the annual payment would be 130*12 = $1,560 per year. Then, the present worth would be the present worth of $1,560 per year for three years at 5% annual interest.

Wait, that might be simpler. Let's try that approach.

So, the present worth of renting is the present worth of an annual payment of $1,560 for three years, at 5% interest. The (P/A,5%,3) factor is [1 - (1.05)^-3 ] / 0.05 ≈ (1 - 0.8638)/0.05 ≈ 0.1362/0.05 ≈ 2.724.

So PW_rent = 1560 * 2.724 ≈ let's compute that.

1560 * 2.724: 1500*2.724 = 4086, 60*2.724=163.44 → total ≈ 4249.44. So approximately $4,249.44.

But wait, wait. Because the payments are monthly, not annual. So perhaps this approach is not accurate. Because the rental is paid monthly, which is more frequent than annual. So perhaps the present worth should be calculated with monthly periods.

But for the sake of time and simplicity, perhaps the problem expects us to treat the rent as an annual payment. Or, alternatively, perhaps the difference isn't too large, and we can proceed with this approximation.

Now, let's compute the present worth for the buying option.

PW_buy = Down payment + PW of loan payments + PW of fuel costs - PW of resale value.

Wait, the down payment is $2,500 at time zero. No discounting needed for that.

The loan is $9,000, which is taken at time zero, but must be repaid over 15 years with annual payments. So the annual payment (A) can be calculated as:

A = P * (i (1 + i)^n) / [(1 + i)^n - 1]

Where P = $9,000, i=5.5% per year, n=15.

So let's compute that.

i = 0.055, n=15.

(1 + 0.055)^15 ≈ Let me compute that. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that (A/P,5.5%,15) is the factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the annual payment as:

A = 9000 * 0.055 * (1 + 0.055)^15 / [ (1 + 0.055)^15 - 1 ]

But calculating (1.055)^15 without a calculator is difficult. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the (A/P) factor for 5.5% over 15 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that this calculation might be time-consuming, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the annual payment for a $9,000 loan at 5.5% for 15 years is approximately $830. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can find the present worth of the loan payments. Since the company is paying back the loan, those payments are cash outflows. So the present worth of the loan payments is the annual payment multiplied by the (P/A,5.5%,15) factor.

But wait, the MARR is 5%, and the loan interest is 5.5%. So perhaps this complicates things because the discount rate for present worth calculations is 5%, but the loan is at 5.5%. Hmm, but I think in this case, the MARR is 5%, so all cash flows are discounted at 5%.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. The loan's interest rate is 5.5%, which is the cost of borrowing. So the annual payments on the loan are based on 5.5%, but when calculating the present worth, we discount the cash flows at the MARR of 5%.

Wait, no. The loan payments are fixed amounts each year, determined by the 5.5% interest rate. So when calculating the present worth of those payments, we discount them at the MARR, which is 5%.

So, let me compute the annual payment first.

The formula for the annual payment (A) is:

A = P * (i * (1 + i)^n) / [ (1 + i)^n - 1 ]

P = $9,000
i = 5.5% = 0.055
n = 15 years

So,

(1 + 0.055)^15 = Let's compute this step by step.

1.055^1 = 1.055
1.055^2 ≈ 1.113
1.055^3 ≈ 1.113 * 1.055 ≈ 1.172
1.055^4 ≈ 1.172 * 1.055 ≈ 1.237
1.055^5 ≈ 1.237 * 1.055 ≈ 1.307
1.055^10 is approximately 1.307 * 1.307 ≈ 1.709 (since each 5 years doubles approximately)
Wait, but precise calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps using the rule of 78 or some other method, but I think it's better to proceed with an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a financial calculator approach.

But perhaps a better approach is to accept that without a calculator, it's challenging, but I can proceed with an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the present worth of the loan directly.

Wait, another approach: the present worth of the loan is the amount received now ($9,000) minus the present worth of the loan payments.

So, PW_loan = 9,000 - A * (P/A, MARR, 15).

Where A is the annual payment, and (P/A, 5%,15) is the present worth factor for an annuity of 15 periods at 5%.

Wait, but the loan is at 5.5%, which is higher than MARR of 5%, so the present worth of the loan payments will be higher than the loan amount, meaning that the net present worth of the loan is negative. But perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the loan as a series of cash outflows. So the present worth of the loan is the present worth of the annual payments, which are determined at 5.5% interest, but discounted at MARR (5%).

So, first, compute the annual payment A:

A = 9,000 * (0.055*(1+0.055)^15) / [ (1+0.055)^15 - 1 ]

Let me approximate (1.055)^15.

Let me compute it step by step:

1.055^1 = 1.055

1.055^2 = 1.055 * 1.055 ≈ 1.113025

1.055^3 ≈ 1.113025 * 1.055 ≈ 1.113025 + 1.113025 * 0.055 ≈ 1.113025 + 0.061166 ≈ 1.174191

1.055^4 ≈ 1.174191 * 1.055 ≈ 1.174191 + (1.174191 * 0.055) ≈ 1.174191 + 0.06463 ≈ 1.23882

1.055^5 ≈ 1.23882 * 1.055 ≈ 1.23882 + (1.23882 * 0.055) ≈ 1.23882 + 0.06814 ≈ 1.30696

1.055^10 is approximately (1.055^5)^2 ≈ (1.30696)^2 ≈ 1.70689

1.055^15 = 1.055^10 * 1.055^5 ≈ 1.70689 * 1.30696 ≈ Let's compute that:

1.70689 * 1.3 = approx 2.2186
1.70689 * 0.00696 ≈ approx 0.0119
So total approx 2.2186 + 0.0119 ≈ 2.2305

So (1.055)^15 ≈ 2.2305

So, numerator is 0.055 * 2.2305 ≈ 0.12267

Denominator is 2.2305 - 1 = 1.2305

So A = 9000 * (0.12267 / 1.2305) ≈ 9000 * (0.0996) ≈ 9000 * 0.0996 ≈ 896.4

So the annual payment is approximately $896.40.

Now, the present worth of these payments is A * (P/A,5%,15)

The (P/A,5%,15) is [1 - (1.05)^-15 ] / 0.05 ≈ (1 - 0.49717) / 0.05 ≈ 0.50283 / 0.05 ≈ 10.0566

So PW_loan_payments = 896.40 * 10.0566 ≈ Let's compute that:

896.40 * 10 = 8964

896.40 * 0.0566 ≈ 896.4 * 0.05 = 44.82, 896.4 * 0.0066≈5.917. So total ≈44.82 +5.917≈50.737

So total PW ≈8964 + 50.737≈9014.737

So the present worth of the loan payments is approximately $9,014.74.

But the company received $9,000 at time zero, so the net present worth of the loan is 9,000 - 9,014.74 ≈ -$14.74. So the loan effectively costs about $14.74 in present worth terms.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the present worth of the loan is the present worth of the $9,000 received minus the present worth of the payments made. So:

PW_loan = 9,000 - (A * (P/A,5%,15)).

We calculated A as approximately $896.40, and (P/A,5%,15) as 10.0566.

So PW_loan = 9,000 - (896.40 * 10.0566) ≈9,000 - 9,014.74≈ -14.74.

So the net present worth of the loan is approximately -$14.
