Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Cicero and philosophy. Hmm, I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman, right? He was quite influential in the development of Western philosophy. The question is asking about the most practical branch of philosophy according to him.

The options given are A through J, each representing a different branch. Let me think about what I know about Cicero's views. I recall that Cicero was a Stoic, but he also had eclectic tendencies, drawing from various schools of thought. Practical philosophy often relates to ethics and how to live a good life.

Wait, in Cicero's works, especially his writings on ethics, he focused a lot on moral duties and what's right. I think he emphasized the importance of understanding one's duties in society. He wrote about the importance of living virtuously and fulfilling one's responsibilities, which ties into moral philosophy.

So, the question is about the most practical branch. Practical philosophy usually deals with ethics, which is about how to act and live. So, among the options, A is moral duties. That makes sense because Cicero's works like "On Duties" (De Officiis) are all about that. He discusses what is honorable and what is expedient, but ultimately, the focus is on moral duties.

Other options: Epistemology is about knowledge, which is more theoretical. Logic and metaphysics are also more on the theoretical side. Rhetoric, while practical, is more about communication and persuasion, not exactly a branch of philosophy but a skill. Political theory is close, but the question is about the branch of philosophy, and Cicero's main focus was on ethics and duties.

So I'm leaning towards A: moral duties.
