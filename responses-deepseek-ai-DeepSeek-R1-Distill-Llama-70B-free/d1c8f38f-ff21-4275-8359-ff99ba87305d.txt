Okay, so I have this problem where Mr. Jackson bought his house in 1995 with a 30-year loan at 7.8% interest. His monthly payment was $1260. Now, in 2015, he wants to pay off the loan, and I need to find out how much he still owes. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the loan was taken in 1995, and it's a 30-year mortgage, which would typically end in 2025. But he's paying it off in 2015, so that's 20 years after taking the loan. Wait, no, wait. 2015 minus 1995 is 20 years, so he's making the payment after 20 years. So the loan has been active for 240 months (20 years * 12 months each).

I remember that to find the remaining balance on a loan, I can use the present value of an annuity formula. The formula for the remaining balance (also called the outstanding loan balance) after a certain number of payments is given by:

P = [ (r * (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1) ) ] * PV

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the formula for the remaining balance is similar to the present value of the remaining payments. So the formula would be:

Balance = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-m ) / r ]

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The present value (PV) of the loan when it was taken is the amount he borrowed. Now, after 240 payments, each of $1260, I need to find the remaining balance.

Alternatively, each payment is applied to interest and principal. But calculating each payment's principal and interest would be tedious, especially 240 times. So using the formula is better.

Wait, the formula for the remaining balance is the present value of the remaining payments. So, the remaining balance is equal to the present value of the future monthly payments, discounted at the monthly interest rate.

Yes. So the number of remaining payments is 30 years minus 20 years, which is 10 years, so 120 months. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the loan is for 30 years, so if he started in 1995, it's due in 2025. But he's paying it off in 2015, so that's 10 years left, right? So 10 years times 12 is 120 payments remaining.

No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, he's making payments for 20 years (240 months) already. So the remaining payments would be 30 - 20 = 10 years, which is 120 months.

So the remaining balance is the present value of those 120 monthly payments of $1260 each, at the monthly interest rate.

But wait, the annual interest rate is 7.8%. So the monthly rate would be 7.8% divided by 12. Let me calculate that. 7.8 divided by 12 is 0.0065, or 0.65% per month.

So the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of remaining payments.

So plugging in the numbers:

PMT = $1260
r = 0.0065
n = 120

Wait, but wait, the loan is being paid off now, so the remaining balance is the present value of the next 120 payments at the monthly rate.

So using the formula:

PV_remaining = 1260 * [ (1 - (1 + 0.0065)^-120 ) / 0.0065 ]

I can compute this step by step.

First, compute (1 + 0.0065)^120. Let me think, the exponent is 120, so that's a big number, but I can compute it as e^(120 * ln(1.0065)).

But perhaps using a calculator approach would be better. Alternatively, I can look up the present value factor for an annuity.

Alternatively, I can compute it manually.

Wait, let's compute (1.0065)^120. Hmm, 1.0065^120. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it, but maybe I should just proceed with the formula.

So let me compute the numerator and denominator.

First, (1 + 0.0065)^120 = (1.0065)^120. Let me compute this value.

Wait, 1.0065^120. Let me compute ln(1.0065) first.

ln(1.0065) ≈ 0.006471 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + x^3/3... for small x, but perhaps I can just remember that ln(1.0065) is approximately 0.00647.

Then, 120 * ln(1.0065) ≈ 120 * 0.00647 ≈ 0.7764.

So e^0.7764 ≈ 2.1738. So (1.0065)^120 ≈ 2.1738.

Wait, but that can't be right because (1 + 0.0065)^120 is about 2.17. But wait, 0.65% per month for 120 months (10 years) would accumulate to more than that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for compound interest: A = P*(1 + r)^n. So (1.0065)^120.

I can compute this step by step.

Another approach: Let me compute (1.0065)^12 first, which would be the yearly factor. (1.0065)^12 ≈ 1.0789 (since 0.65% *12 is 7.8%, and (1.0078) is about 1.079). So, (1.0065)^12 ≈ 1.079.

Then, (1.0065)^120 = [(1.0065)^12]^10 = (1.079)^10.

Now, 1.079^10. Let's compute that.

1.079^2 ≈ 1.079 * 1.079 ≈ 1.164.

1.079^4 = (1.164)^2 ≈ 1.354.

1.079^8 = (1.354)^2 ≈ 1.833.

1.079^10 = 1.079^8 * 1.079^2 ≈ 1.833 * 1.164 ≈ 2.134.

So (1.0065)^120 ≈ approximately 2.134.

So, back to the present value formula.

PV_remaining = 1260 * [ (1 - 1/2.134) / 0.0065 ]

Let me compute 1/2.134 ≈ 0.469.

So 1 - 0.469 ≈ 0.531.

Then, 0.531 / 0.0065 ≈ 81.692.

So PV_remaining ≈ 1260 * 81.692 ≈ ?

Compute 1260 * 80 = 100,800.

1260 * 1.692 = ?

1260 * 1 = 1260.

1260 * 0.692 = Let's compute 1260 * 0.6 = 756; 1260 * 0.092 = approx 115.92. So total 756 + 115.92 = 871.92.

So 1260 * 1.692 = 1260 + 871.92 ≈ 2131.92.

So total PV_remaining ≈ 100,800 + 2,131.92 = 102,931.92.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the present value should be higher, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check my calculations again. Because the options given are like in the 100,000s, but wait, the options are A:90,000; B:98,000; etc., up to J:150,000.

Wait, but my calculation gave me around 102,932, but none of the options match exactly. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A: 90000.00

B: 98000.00

C: 125678.90

D: 110000.00

E: 120000.00

F: 115245.67

G: 104761.48

H: 135000.00

I: 140000.00

J: 150000.00

Hmm, the closest to my approximate calculation is option G:104761.48, which is about 104,761.48. So perhaps that's the correct one.

But wait, perhaps my approximation of (1.0065)^120 being 2.134 is a bit off. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a financial calculator approach. Let me try to compute (1.0065)^120 more accurately.

Using the formula (1 + r)^n = e^(n ln(1 + r)).

So, ln(1.0065) = approximately 0.006471 (as earlier).

Multiply by 120: 0.006471 * 120 = 0.7765.

e^0.7765 ≈ 2.1742.

So (1.0065)^120 ≈ 2.1742.

So, 1/(1.0065)^120 ≈ 1/2.1742 ≈ 0.4599.

So 1 - 0.4599 = 0.5401.

Now, divide by r: 0.5401 / 0.0065 ≈ 83.093.

So the present value factor is approximately 83.093.

Then, PV = 1260 * 83.093 ≈ ?

Compute 1260 * 80 = 100,800.

1260 * 3.093 = Let's compute 1260 * 3 = 3780, 1260 * 0.093 ≈ 117.18.

So 3780 + 117.18 = 3897.18.

Total PV ≈ 100,800 + 3,897.18 ≈ 104,697.18.

Hmm, that's about 104,697.18, which is very close to option G:104761.48.

Wait, why is there a slight discrepancy? Oh, perhaps because my approximation of (1.0065)^120 as 2.1742 is accurate enough, but maybe my division in 0.5401/0.0065 is 83.093, but perhaps I should be more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise calculation.

Wait, let me compute 0.5401 divided by 0.0065.

0.5401 / 0.0065 = ?

Well, 0.0065 * 83 = 0.5395, which is just a bit less than 0.5401.

So 83 * 0.0065 = 0.5395.

0.5401 - 0.5395 = 0.0006.

So, 0.0006 / 0.0065 ≈ 0.0923.

So total is 83.0923.

So, 83.0923.

So, 1260 * 83.0923 = ?

Let me compute 1260 * 80 = 100,800.

1260 * 3.0923 = ?

Compute 1260 * 3 = 3780.

1260 * 0.0923 = ?

0.09 * 1260 = 113.4.

0.0023 * 1260 ≈ 2.898.

So 113.4 + 2.898 ≈ 116.298.

So 3.0923 * 1260 ≈ 3780 + 116.298 ≈ 3896.298.

So total PV ≈ 100,800 + 3,896.30 ≈ 104,696.30.

Hmm, so approximately $104,696.30, which is very close to option G:104761.48.

But why is there a slight difference? Maybe because the exact calculation uses more precise numbers. Let me check the exact value using the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the TVM (time value of money) formula.

The loan balance after 240 payments can be calculated using the present value of an annuity formula, where:

Balance = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-m) / r ]

Wait, no, that's the present value when you have m future payments. So in this case, the remaining balance is the present value of the next 120 payments, which is what I calculated earlier.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the number of payments. Wait, the loan was taken in 1995, so 20 years later is 2015. So the number of payments made is 240 (20 *12). So the number of remaining payments is 120.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

Balance = PV * (1 + r)^n - PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

Wait, no. Because the balance after n payments can be found using:

Balance = PV * (1 + r)^n - PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

Wait, but in this case, the original PV is the loan amount, which we don't know. Alternatively, maybe another approach would be better.

Wait, another formula for the remaining balance after k payments is:

Balance = P * (1 + r)^(k) - PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^k - 1 ) / r ]

But since we don't know P, perhaps we should use the fact that the monthly payment was determined based on the original loan amount.

Wait, perhaps I can find the original loan amount first, then compute the remaining balance after 240 payments.

Let me try that approach.

The original loan amount (P) can be found using the present value of an annuity formula:

P = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where PMT is $1260, r is 0.0065, and n is 360 months (30 years).

So,

P = 1260 * [ (1 - (1.0065)^-360 ) / 0.0065 ]

Compute (1.0065)^-360. Hmm, that's 1/(1.0065)^360.

Earlier, I approximated (1.0065)^120 ≈ 2.1742, so (1.0065)^360 would be (2.1742)^3 ≈ 10.24.

So (1.0065)^-360 ≈ 1/10.24 ≈ 0.09767.

So, 1 - 0.09767 ≈ 0.90233.

Then, 0.90233 / 0.0065 ≈ 138,748.

Wait, that can't be right because 138,748 * 0.0065 ≈ 902.

So, 0.90233 / 0.0065 ≈ 138,748.

So, P ≈ 1260 * 138,748 ≈ ?

Wait, no, wait, that would be a huge number. Wait, no, the denominator is 0.0065, so 0.90233 / 0.0065 is 0.90233 / 0.0065.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.90233 / 0.0065 = ?

Well, 0.0065 * 138,000 = 0.0065 * 138,000 = 897.

0.90233 - 0.0065*138,000 = 0.90233 - 0.897 = 0.00533.

So 0.00533 / 0.0065 ≈ 0.820.

So total is approximately 138,000 + 0.820 ≈ 138,000.82.

So, P ≈ 1260 * 138,000.82 ≈ ?

Wait, that can't be right because 1260 * 138,000 is way too big, in the hundreds of millions. That doesn't make sense. Clearly, I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. The original loan amount would actually be much lower, as the payments are monthly.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me compute (1.0065)^360.

Wait, (1.0065)^360 is the factor for 30 years of monthly compounding at 0.65% per month.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using natural logs.

ln(1.0065) ≈ 0.006471.

Multiply by 360: 0.006471 * 360 ≈ 2.329.

So, e^2.329 ≈ 10.03.

So, (1.0065)^360 ≈ 10.03.

Thus, (1.0065)^-360 ≈ 1/10.03 ≈ 0.0997.

So, 1 - 0.0997 ≈ 0.9003.

0.9003 / 0.0065 ≈ 0.9003 / 0.0065 ≈ 138,500.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make P = 1260 * 138,500 = 174,390,000, which is way too high for a house loan. Clearly, I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me get back to the initial approach. The original loan amount P is the present value of 360 monthly payments of $1260 at 0.65% per month.

So P = 1260 * [ (1 - (1.0065)^-360 ) / 0.0065 ]

But I think I'm miscalculating (1.0065)^-360.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator to compute it accurately. But since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can approximate it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the rule of 78 or other methods, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial approach where I calculated the remaining balance as the present value of the next 120 payments, which gave me approximately $104,696.30, which is close to option G:104761.48.

But perhaps the exact calculation would give a value like 104,761.48.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the remaining balance using the formula:

Balance = PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ] - (PMT * n)

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, the present value of the remaining payments is the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ann
