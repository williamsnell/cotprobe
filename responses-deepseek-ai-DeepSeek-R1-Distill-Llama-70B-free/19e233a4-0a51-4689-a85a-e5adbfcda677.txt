Question:

A resident in an exclusive residential area is a marine biologist. To aid in his study of sharks, he had a large tank built in his backyard in which he placed a great white shark. Aside from a smell that emanated from the tank, some neighbors were concerned and afraid to let their children outside for fear that they would wander onto the resident's property. In order to convince his neighbors that they had nothing to fear, the resident invited them over to view the shark tank. While a neighbor was standing near the tank, the shark splashed its tail, and the neighbor got very wet. The neighbor, who had a cold, developed bronchitis. If the neighbor sues the resident for damages incurred from being drenched by the shark and bases her suit on strict liability, she will most likely

Options:

A: not recover, because she suffered injury only because she had a cold and, therefore, was unusually vulnerable to harm from being splashed with water.
B: not recover, because the resident had taken all necessary precautions to ensure the shark could not harm anyone.
C: recover, because the resident intentionally placed the shark in an area where it could potentially harm others.
D: not recover, because the development of bronchitis was not a direct result of the resident's actions.
E: recover, because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals.
F: not recover, because she willingly chose to visit the resident's property and view the shark tank.
G: not recover, because she did not suffer the type of harm normally inflicted by a shark.
H: recover, because the smell from the shark tank was a nuisance.
I: recover, because the resident knowingly kept a dangerous wild animal in a residential area.
J: recover, because the resident failed to warn her of the potential risk of being splashed by the shark.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically strict liability. Let me break it down step by step to figure out the correct answer.

The scenario is about a resident who's a marine biologist and has a great white shark in a tank in his backyard. The neighbors are concerned, so he invites them over to show them the shark tank. While one neighbor is near the tank, the shark splashes its tail, getting her very wet. She had a cold and then developed bronchitis. Now she's suing the resident for damages under strict liability.

I remember that strict liability applies in certain situations, like when someone is keeping a wild or dangerous animal. The idea is that the owner is responsible for any harm caused by the animal, regardless of negligence, because such animals have inherent dangerous tendencies.

So the key here is whether a great white shark is considered a wild or dangerous animal subject to strict liability. I think great white sharks are definitely dangerous; they're predators and can cause serious harm. So the resident, keeping one in his backyard, might be strictly liable for any injuries caused by the shark.

Now, the neighbor got wet because the shark splashed her. She then developed bronchitis because she was already sick with a cold. So the question is whether the injury (bronchitis) is something the resident is strictly liable for.

In the options, I see that option E says, "recover, because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals." That sounds relevant. But wait, what about the fact that she was just splashed and got wet? Did the shark attack her, or was it just a splash?

Strict liability for wild animals usually applies when the animal's dangerous nature causes the harm. So, if the shark's action (splashing) is a natural behavior that led to her getting wet, which in turn caused her to get bronchitis, then the resident might be liable.

But another point is that the neighbor was on the resident's property with permission. Some might argue she willingly came, but strict liability doesn't depend on negligence or intent—it's about the type of animal and the foreseeability of the harm.

Option I says, "recover, because the resident knowingly kept a dangerous wild animal in a residential area." That's also a point, but I think the more precise reason would be the strict liability rule.

Wait, but does the harm have to be typical for the animal? Like, a shark is dangerous because it can bite, not necessarily because it can splash. So maybe the splashing isn't the kind of harm that strict liability covers. If the shark had bitten her, that's a clear case. But splashing leading to getting wet and then an illness—does that count?

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The strict liability rule applies when the animal's dangerous propensity causes the harm. A shark's dangerous propensity is its ability to bite and cause injury. Splashing water isn't part of that dangerous nature. So perhaps the injury here isn't the kind that strict liability covers.

Looking back at the options, option G says she didn't suffer the type of harm normally inflicted by a shark. That could be a reason for not recovering. But then again, the harm came from the shark's action, even if it's not the typical injury.

Alternatively, does the chain of causation matter? She got wet, which made her cold worse. Is that a foreseeable result of the shark's splashing? I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the strict liability for animals isn't just about attacks. It's about any harm caused by the animal's dangerous tendencies. So if the shark's movement (splashing) is part of its normal behavior, and that leads to someone getting wet and catching a cold, maybe that's within the scope of strict liability.

But I'm not certain. Let me consider the options again. Option E suggests she can recover because the possessor is strictly liable for all injuries caused by the wild animal. Option G is about not the typical harm.

I think the key is that the shark is a wild animal, so the resident is strictly liable for any harm it causes, regardless of whether it's the usual kind of injury. So even if the shark didn't bite, but its actions led to her getting wet and then sick, the resident is liable.

So the correct answer would be E. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The case might depend on whether the harm was a direct result of the animal's dangerous nature. Splashing is a natural behavior, but is it considered dangerous? Maybe not in the way that leads to liability. So perhaps she can't recover because the harm wasn't the kind that makes the animal dangerous.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions might hold that any injury caused by the animal, regardless of the type, makes the owner strictly liable. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, another thought: the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 507 says that the possessor of a wild animal is subject to strict liability for harm caused by the animal's dangerous tendencies. So, if the injury arises from those tendencies, then liability applies. So, if the shark's splashing isn't a dangerous tendency, then maybe not. But I'm not sure if splashing qualifies.

This is a bit tricky. I'm leaning towards E being the correct answer because it's the most direct application of strict liability for wild animals. However, I'm not entirely certain because the injury wasn't from an attack but from getting wet, which might not be considered a dangerous tendency of the shark.

The question revolves around whether the resident, who owns a great white shark, can be held strictly liable for injuries caused by the shark's splashing, which led to the neighbor developing bronchitis. Strict liability applies to the possessors of wild or dangerous animals for harm caused by the animal's dangerous tendencies, regardless of negligence. Great white sharks are inherently dangerous animals, and their dangerous tendencies include behaviors that could foreseeably cause harm.

In this case, the shark's splashing is a natural behavior, but the injury (bronchitis) resulted from the neighbor getting wet. The key issue is whether this harm is within the scope of the shark's dangerous tendencies. While sharks are dangerous due to their ability to bite, splashing is not typically considered a dangerous tendency. However, strict liability can apply to any harm caused by the animal, even if it is not the typical kind of injury associated with the animal.

Option E correctly states that the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused by the animals. This aligns with the principle that strict liability applies to any harm caused by the animal, regardless of whether it is the usual type of harm. Therefore, the resident is likely strictly liable for the neighbor's injuries.
