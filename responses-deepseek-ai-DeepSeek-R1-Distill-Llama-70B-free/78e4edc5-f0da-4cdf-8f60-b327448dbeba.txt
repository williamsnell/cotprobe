Okay, so I've got this gas problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me see... The question says that a gas occupies 1.0 liter at 27°C and 500 Torr pressure. Then, the temperature changes to 60°C and the pressure to 700 Torr. I need to find the new volume. Hmm.

Wait, I remember something about the combined gas law. Oh right, the formula is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2, right? Because it combines Boyle's and Charles's laws. Let me write that down: P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2. So I can solve for V2.

But wait, temperatures must be in Kelvin for this to work. Oh yeah, because you can't have zero in gas laws if using Celsius. So I need to convert 27°C and 60°C to Kelvin. How do I do that? Oh, add 273.15. So 27 + 273.15 is 300.15 K, and 60 + 273.15 is 333.15 K.

So plugging the values in. P1 is 500 Torr, V1 is 1.0 L, T1 is 300.15 K. P2 is 700 Torr, and T2 is 333.15 K. I'm solving for V2.

So rearranging the formula, V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1). Let me plug in the numbers. 

Wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. Yeah, V2 equals (P1 V1 T2) divided by (P2 T1). So substituting:

V2 = (500 Torr * 1.0 L * 333.15 K) / (700 Torr * 300.15 K).

Hmm, let's calculate that step by step. First, simplify the pressures: 500/700 is 5/7, which is approximately 0.714. Then, the temperatures: 333.15 / 300.15 is roughly 1.11.

Multiplying these together: 0.714 * 1.11 ≈ 0.792. So V2 is around 0.79 liters. Wait, but let me do the exact calculation without approximating to check.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately. Numerator: 500 * 1.0 * 333.15 = 500 * 333.15 = 166575. Denominator:700 * 300.15 = 210105.

So V2 = 166575 / 210105. Let me compute this division. 166575 ÷ 210105. I can simplify the numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 15. Let's see, 210105 ÷15 is 14007, and 166575 ÷15 is 11105. So now it's 11105 /14007.

Wait, maybe I can do this division. Let me see, 14007 times 0.8 is 11205.6, which is a bit higher than 11105. So perhaps 0.79? Let me compute 14007 * 0.79.

14007 * 0.7 = 9804.9. 14007 * 0.09 = 1260.63. Sum is 9804.9 +1260.63=11065.53. Our numerator is 11105, which is a bit higher. So the exact value is a little more than 0.79. Like, 0.792 or something. So approximately 0.79 liters.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.79. Option H is 0.89, which is higher. Wait, but wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute 166575 / 210105. Let's see, 210105 divided by 2 is 105052.5. 166575 is roughly 1.58 times 105052.5. Because 105052.5 * 1.5 is 157578.75. 157578.75 is less than 166575 by about 9000. So 9000/105052.5 is about 0.0857. So 1.5 + 0.0857 is 1.5857. So 1/1.5857 is approximately 0.63? Wait, no, wait that's not right.

Wait, maybe I should just do the division more accurately. 166575 ÷ 210105.

Let me compute 166575 ÷ 210105.

Well, 210105 goes into 166575 how many times? It's less than once. So 0. something.

We can write it as 166575 / 210105 = (166575 ÷ 15) / (210105 ÷15) ) = 11105 /14007 ≈ 0.792.

So approximately 0.792 liters, which is about 0.79 liters. So option A is 0.79, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options again. Option A is 0.79, which matches. So the answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

Rearranging for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{P_2 T_1}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- \( T_1 = 27^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_2 = 60^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 333.15 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 2: Substitute known values
- \( P_1 = 500 \, \text{Torr} \), \( V_1 = 1.0 \, \text{L} \), \( T_1 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_2 = 700 \, \text{Torr} \), \( T_2 = 333.15 \, \text{K} \)

\[
V_2 = \frac{500 \cdot 1.0 \cdot 333.15}{700 \cdot 300.15}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the calculation
- Numerator: \( 500 \cdot 333.15 = 166575 \)
- Denominator: \( 700 \cdot 300.15 = 210105 \)
- \( V_2 = \frac{166575}{210105} \approx 0.792 \, \text{L} \)

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated value of \( V_2 \) is approximately \( 0.79 \, \text{L} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
