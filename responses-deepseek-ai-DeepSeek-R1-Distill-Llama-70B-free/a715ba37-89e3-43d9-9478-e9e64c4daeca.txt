Question:

On day 1, Jackson, a merchant, mailed Sands a signed letter that contained an offer to sell Sands 500 electric fans at $10 per fan. The letter was received by Sands on day 3. The letter contained a promise not to revoke the offer but no expiration date. On day 4, Jackson mailed Sands a revocation of the offer to sell the fans. Sands received the revocation on day 6. On day 7, Sands mailed Jackson an acceptance of the offer. Jackson received the acceptance on day 9. Under the Sales Article of the UCC, was a contract formed?

Options:

A: No contract was formed because Sands accepted the offer after receiving the revocation
B: No contract was formed because the offer was not in writing
C: No contract was formed because the offer was not signed by Sands
D: A contract was formed on the day Sands received the offer
E: No contract was formed because Sands received the revocation of the offer before Sands accepted the offer
F: A contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands’ acceptance
G: A contract was formed on the day Sands received Jackson's revocation
H: A contract was formed on the day Jackson mailed the revocation
I: A contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance to Jackson
J: No contract was formed because the offer failed to state an expiration date.

Okay, so I have this question about contracts under the UCC Sales Article. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, Jackson is a merchant and he mailed an offer to Sands on day 1. The offer was to sell 500 electric fans at $10 each. The letter was signed and had a promise not to revoke, but no expiration date. Sands received it on day 3. Then on day 4, Jackson sent a revocation, which Sands got on day 6. Sands then accepted on day 7, mailing it, and Jackson got it on day 9.

The question is whether a contract was formed. The options are A through J, each with different reasons.

I remember that under the UCC, when dealing with merchants, offers can be firm for a certain period even without an expiration date. Firm offers are irrevocable for the time stated, or if no time is stated, they last for a reasonable time. But wait, the offer here did have a promise not to revoke, so maybe it's a firm offer.

Wait, the offer says it's a promise not to revoke, so that would make it a firm offer under UCC 2-205. So normally, an offer can be revoked unless it's a firm offer. Firm offers are irrevocable for the time stated, but if no time, then it's for a reasonable time. Since this offer didn't state an expiration, but promised not to revoke, perhaps it's considered firm with reasonable time.

But wait, the offer was made by a merchant, and the promise not to revoke would make it a firm offer. So the revocation would be ineffective if it's within that reasonable time. But what's the reasonable time? I think it's up to the time the offer would normally lapse, like if the offer is for a sale of goods, without a time, the reasonable time is what's usual for such transactions.

So Jackson sent the revocation on day 4, received on day 6. Sands received the offer on day 3, so the revocation came three days later. Depending on what's reasonable, maybe that's still within the time, but maybe not. Or perhaps the revocation was sent after the offer was already accepted.

Wait, but when does acceptance happen? Under UCC, acceptance is effective when the acceptor sends it (mailbox rule), but the revocation is effective when received. Because the revocation is a communication, which under UCC 2-206, revocation is effective when it's received. So if Sands accepted before the revocation was received, then the acceptance would be effective.

Wait, let's map out the timeline:

- Day 1: Offer mailed by Jackson.

- Day 3: Offer received by Sands.

- Day 4: Revocation mailed by Jackson.

- Day 6: Revocation received by Sands.

- Day 7: Sands mails acceptance.

- Day 9: Jackson receives acceptance.

Now, under UCC 2-206, an offer can be accepted by sending the acceptance, making it effective on dispatch. But revocation is effective when received.

So when Jackson sent the revocation on day 4, it was received on day 6. Sands, on day 7, after receiving the revocation on day 6, then accepted. Wait, no, because Sands sent the acceptance on day 7, but the revocation was received on day 6. So the revocation was received before the acceptance was sent.

Wait, but the offer was a firm offer with a promise not to revoke. So under UCC 2-205, a firm offer cannot be revoked during the period it's firm. So even if the offeror tries to revoke, it's ineffective if done during that period.

But the offer didn't specify an expiration date, so the firm offer would last for a reasonable time. What's reasonable? Well, for goods, it's typically not more than a few days unless specified otherwise. So let's say the offer was sent on day 1, received day 3. If the offer is firm, it's irrevocable for a reasonable time, say maybe a week. So the revocation was sent on day 4, which is within that reasonable time.

So Jackson's attempt to revoke on day 4 is ineffective because the offer was firm. Therefore, the revocation is not effective, and the offer remains open. Sands can still accept it.

Wait, but when did Sands accept? Sands accepted on day 7, which is after the revocation was received on day 6. But if the revocation was ineffective, then the offer was still open. So Sands' acceptance on day 7 would be effective, because the offer was still valid.

Wait, but the revocation was received on day 6. So on day 6, Sands knows that Jackson tried to revoke. But if the revocation is ineffective because it's a firm offer, then the offer remains open. So when Sands sends the acceptance on day 7, it's still valid.

Alternatively, maybe the revocation was sent after the offer was no longer firm. Let me think again. The offer was made on day 1, received day3. Without an expiration, the firm offer lasts for a reasonable time. So if the offeror tries to revoke within that time, it's ineffective. So if Jackson tried to revoke on day4, that's within the reasonable time, so the revocation is invalid. Therefore, the offer remains open until the reasonable time expires, which might be, say, a week. So if Sands accepted on day7, which is within the reasonable time, then the acceptance is effective.

Wait, but the revocation was sent on day4, received day6. So if the firm offer's reasonable time is, say, 10 days, then the revocation is still ineffective. So Sands' acceptance on day7 is still good.

Alternatively, perhaps the revocation is effective when sent, but no, under UCC, revocation is effective upon receipt. So if the revocation was received on day6, but the offer was still firm, then the revocation is ineffective.

So with that, the revocation doesn't terminate the offer. So when Sands sends the acceptance on day7, it's effective upon mailing, because under UCC, an acceptance is effective when sent (mailbox rule). So the contract is formed on day7 when Sands mailed the acceptance.

Looking at the options, option I says a contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance. That would be day7.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option I: A contract formed on day Sands mailed acceptance (day7).

Option F: Contract formed when Jackson received acceptance (day9).

Under UCC 2-206(1)(b), an order or acceptance sent by mail is effective on dispatch. So the contract is formed when Sands mailed it, day7.

So the correct answer would be option I.

But wait, let's make sure the offer was still open when Sands accepted. Since the revocation was ineffective because it was during the firm period, so yes, the offer was still open when Sands accepted on day7. Therefore, the contract was formed on day7.

Under the UCC Sales Article, the key issue is whether a contract was formed when Sands accepted Jackson's offer. Jackson's offer, mailed on day 1 and received by Sands on day 3, was a firm offer under UCC §2-205 because it included a promise not to revoke. Since the offer did not specify an expiration date, it remained open for a reasonable time. 

Jackson attempted to revoke the offer on day 4, but under UCC §2-206, revocation is effective upon receipt, which occurred on day 6. However, because the offer was a firm offer, Jackson's attempted revocation within the reasonable time was ineffective. Therefore, the offer remained open when Sands mailed the acceptance on day 7.

Under UCC §2-206(1)(b), an acceptance sent by mail is effective upon dispatch. Thus, the contract was formed on day 7, when Sands mailed the acceptance. This makes option I the correct answer.
