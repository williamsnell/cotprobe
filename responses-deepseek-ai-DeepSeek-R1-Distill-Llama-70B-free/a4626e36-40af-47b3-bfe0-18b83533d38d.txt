The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Because of a sudden and unanticipated severe shortage of heating fuel, the President has ordered all offices of federal executive agencies to be open only four days per week. The President's order allows an exception to the extent that emergency circumstances require different hours of operation (as in the case of federal hospitals). When Congress enacted the appropriations statute for operating all federal executive agencies, its members assumed that the offices of those agencies would be open five days per week, but Congress did not include such a requirement in its appropriations statute or in any other statute. Is the President's order constitutional?

Options:

A: Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.
B: Yes, because the President has the authority to modify operational days in case of emergencies.
C: No, because the President cannot change the operating days without a formal amendment to the appropriations statute.
D: Yes, because the appropriations statute does not specifically state the number of operational days.
E: No, because when they passed the statute appropriating monies for the operation of executive agencies, members of Congress assumed that those agencies' offices would be open five days per week.
F: No, because the President's order infringes on the rights of federal employees.
G: No, because the heads of the various executive agencies have final responsibility for the operation of those agencies' offices.
H: No, because a sudden and severe shortage of heating fuel does not constitute an emergency.
I: Yes, because the Constitution vests the President with plenary authority to direct the administration of all federal agencies in any manner the President deems expedient.
J: Yes, because the President's order still allows for exceptions in emergency circumstances.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically regarding the President's authority. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

The question is about whether the President's order to reduce federal office hours from five to four days a week is constitutional. The situation is that there's a sudden heating fuel shortage, so the President is ordering this change. Congress had assumed the offices would be open five days when they passed the appropriations statute, but they didn't include that requirement in any law.

So, I need to figure out if the President has the authority to make this change without Congress explicitly allowing it. I remember that the President is the head of the executive branch, so they have some management powers. But there's also the separation of powers and checks and balances to consider.

Looking at the options, let's think about each one. 

Option A says yes because it's about managing the executive branch and isn't prohibited by statute. That makes sense because the President's role includes overseeing federal agencies. If there's no law against it, maybe they can do it.

Option B mentions emergency authority, but the question says the shortage is sudden and severe, so maybe that's a valid reason. But does the President need a specific emergency power from Congress, or is it implied?

Option C argues that the President can't change it without amending the appropriations statute. But I don't think Congress needs to amend it; the President might have inherent authority to manage operations unless restricted.

Option D says yes because the statute doesn't specify the days. That seems plausible. If the law doesn't say anything about the number of days, the President can decide.

Option E says no because Congress assumed five days. But assumptions aren't the same as law. Congress's intent doesn't always control if they didn't write it into the statute.

Option F is about infringing on employees' rights. I don't think that's the main issue here; it's more about operational authority than individual rights.

Option G suggests that agency heads have final responsibility. But the President is their boss, so maybe they can override that.

Option H claims the fuel shortage isn't an emergency. But the question says it's severe, so I think that qualifies.

Option I states the Constitution gives the President plenary authority. That sounds too broad, as the Constitution doesn't explicitly grant that. It gives the President executive power, but with limits.

Option J says yes because there are exceptions allowed. That's about the order's flexibility, but that doesn't directly address the constitutionality.

So, the key points are: Does the President have the authority to manage the executive branch without Congressional interference when Congress hasn't explicitly prohibited it? I think the President does, based on their role as the executive. Also, the appropriations statute doesn't specify the days, so the President can adjust operations as needed.

Therefore, options A, B, D, I, J are possibilities. But I think A and D are the strongest. Since the statute doesn't prohibit it, the President's action isn't unconstitutional. So between A and D, A seems better because it's about management without prohibition.

Wait, but does the appropriations statute's silence imply that the President can manage as they see fit? I think so. So the answer would be A or D. But the question is about the constitutionality, so it's more about whether the President is overstepping.

Another angle is the Necessary and Proper Clause, which allows the President to take actions necessary to execute laws. Here, the President is managing the agencies within the appropriated funds, which is a necessary part of execution.

So yes, the order is constitutional because the President is managing the executive branch within their authority, and there's no law against it. So the correct answer should be A.

The President's order to reduce federal office hours from five to four days a week is constitutional. The President, as the head of the executive branch, has the authority to manage federal agencies unless explicitly prohibited by statute. In this case, Congress's appropriations statute does not specify the number of operational days, and the President's order is a valid exercise of their managerial powers. While Congress assumed a five-day workweek, assumptions not codified into law do not limit the President's authority. The President's action is consistent with their role in administering federal agencies and is not unconstitutional. 

The correct answer is:

A
