Okay, so I have this problem about bond yields, and I need to find the effective yield. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the bond is worth $1,000 and matures in one year. I bought it for $960. Wait, so I paid less than the face value. That means it's a discount bond, right? Because the purchase price is lower than the face value, which is usually paid at maturity.

The nominal annual interest rate is 6%. Oh, right, nominal interest is the coupon rate, the stated rate on the bond. But the question is asking for the effective yield, which I think is the yield to maturity or the effective annual rate. Since the bond is only for one year, maybe it's simpler.

So, effective yield would be the total return I get from this bond over the year. Let's break it down. I bought it for $960, and in a year, it matures at $1,000. So the gain is the difference between these two prices plus any interest I earn.

Wait, wait. The bond pays a nominal interest rate of 6% annually. So the coupon payment would be 6% of the face value. Face value is $1,000, so 6% of 1,000 is $60. So each year, I get $60 in interest. But wait, since it's maturing in one year, I get that $60 at the end of the year, along with the return of the principal.

But wait, no, wait. Because I bought it at $960. So the total amount at maturity is $1,000. So the profit comes from the $40 difference (1,000 - 960 = 40) plus the interest payment of $60. So total received at the end is $1,000, which includes the $60 interest. So the sum I get is $1,060 in total? Wait, no. Because when the bond matures, I get the face value, which is $1,000. But I also get the interest for the year, which is $60. So the total amount I'll receive is $1,000 + $60 = $1,060.

Wait, but I think the interest is paid annually, but since it's a one-year bond, I get the interest at the end. So yes, in total, I get $1,060 when the bond matures.

So the total return is $1,060, and I paid $960 for it. So the profit is $100, because 1060 - 960 = 100. Wait, no. Wait, 1060 - 960 is $100. So the profit is $100 on an investment of $960. So the yield would be (100 / 960) * 100 to get the percentage.

Let me calculate that. 100 divided by 960 is approximately 0.104166... So that's about 10.4166%. Rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, that's 10.4%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 10.4%. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The effective yield is the rate that would make the present value of the bond's cash flows equal to the purchase price. So the formula is:

Purchase Price = (Face Value + Interest) / (1 + r)

Because it's a one-year bond, so it's simple interest. So 960 = (1000 + 60) / (1 + r). Let me compute that.

So 1060 = 960 * (1 + r). Divide both sides by 960: (1060 / 960) = 1 + r.

1060 / 960 is approximately 1.104166... So subtract 1, and you get 0.104166..., which is 10.4166%. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 10.4%.

Yes, that confirms it. So the effective yield is 10.4%, which is option F.

To determine the effective yield of the bond, we calculate the total return on investment over the one-year period. The bond is purchased for $960, has a face value of $1,000, and pays a nominal annual interest rate of 6%. At maturity, the bondholder receives the face value ($1,000) plus the interest payment ($60), for a total of $1,060.

The profit is the difference between the total amount received ($1,060) and the purchase price ($960), which is $100. The effective yield is then calculated as:

\[
\text{Effective Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Purchase Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{100}{960} \right) \times 100 \approx 10.4166\%.
\]

Rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent, the effective yield is 10.4%. This matches option F.
