Okay, so I've got this problem about a shunt motor, and I need to find the horsepower output and efficiency. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electric motors, but let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let's read the problem again carefully. The motor is a 50-hp, 500-volt shunt motor. At no load, it draws a line current of 4.5 amperes. The shunt field resistance is 250 ohms, and the armature resistance is 0.3 ohms, excluding brushes. The brush drop is 2 volts. At full load, the line current is 84 amperes. I need to find the output horsepower and the efficiency.

Wait, so the motor is rated 50 hp, but that's probably the output at full load, right? Or is that the input? Wait, no, horsepower for motors usually refers to output unless stated otherwise. But in this problem, maybe I'm being asked to calculate the actual output and efficiency, considering the losses.

Efficiency (η) is the output power divided by the input power, right? So η = output / input.

But first, I think I need to find the output power at full load and then calculate the efficiency based on that.

Let me list the given data:

- Voltage (V) = 500 volts
- Rated power (maybe output?) = 50 hp (but we might need to calculate the actual output)
- No-load line current (I0) = 4.5 A
- Shunt field resistance (Rsh) = 250 ohms
- Armature resistance (Ra) = 0.3 ohms (brushes excluded)
- Brush drop (Vbrush) = 2 volts
- Full-load line current (Ifl) = 84 A

Wait, but in a shunt motor, the field current is the same as the shunt current. So to find the shunt current, I can use V divided by Rsh.

Shunt current (Ish) = V / Rsh = 500 V / 250 ohms = 2 A.

At no load, the line current is 4.5 A. Since the shunt current is 2 A, the armature current at no load (Ia0) is I0 - Ish = 4.5 - 2 = 2.5 A.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the line current is the sum of the shunt and armature currents, but in a shunt motor, the field is connected in parallel, so the line current is the sum of the shunt current and the armature current. So I_line = Ish + I_armature.

So no-load armature current Ia0 = I0 - Ish = 4.5 A - 2 A = 2.5 A.

Hmm, but no, wait, the shunt current is 2 A. So at no load, the line current is 4.5 A. So the armature current is 4.5 A - 2 A = 2.5 A. But that seems high for no load. Maybe that's correct, but let's proceed.

Now, at full load, the line current is 84 A. So the armature current Ifa = Ifl - Ish = 84 A - 2 A = 82 A.

Wait, that's a lot. So the armature current is 82 A at full load.

But in a shunt motor, the torque is proportional to the armature current, right? So the motor must be handling a lot more current at full load.

Now, I think the steps I should take are:

1. Calculate the input power at full load.
2. Calculate the output power, considering the losses.
3. Compute the efficiency as output / input.

Wait, but another approach is to calculate the total losses and subtract them from the input to get output.

But let me proceed step by step.

First, find the input power at full load. Input power (Pin) is V * Ifl. V is 500 V, Ifl is 84 A.

So Pin = 500 V * 84 A = 42,000 W.

But wait, that's 42 kW. The output should be in horsepower, so I'll need to convert later.

Next, compute the total losses. The losses in a motor include:

- Armature copper losses (I²Ra)
- Shunt field copper losses (Ish² Rsh)
- Brush drop losses (Ia * Vbrush)
- Friction and windage losses, and core losses, but these are often considered as part of the no-load losses.

Wait, so at no load, the armature current is 2.5 A. So the no-load losses (P0) would be the sum of the shunt loss, armature loss, and brush drop.

Wait, but no. At no load, the armature current is Ia0 = 2.5 A. So:

Shunt loss (Psh) = Ish² Rsh = (2)^2 * 250 = 4 * 250 = 1000 W.

Armature loss (Pa0) = Ia0² Ra = (2.5)^2 * 0.3 = 6.25 * 0.3 = 1.875 W.

Brush drop loss (Pbr0) = Ia0 * Vbrush = 2.5 A * 2 V = 5 W.

So total losses at no load (P0) = 1000 + 1.875 +5 = 1006.875 W.

But wait, the no-load input is V * I0 = 500 * 4.5 = 2250 W. So the no-load output is zero (since torque is zero), so the input is all loss, which is 2250 W. But according to my calculation, the sum of the losses is 1006.875 W. That's a discrepancy. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, right! Friction and windage, and iron losses. So when the motor is running at no load, even without output torque, it still has rotational losses (friction, windage) and possibly iron losses in the armature. So the difference between the no-load input (2250 W) and the calculated losses (1006.875 W) would be the rotational losses plus iron losses.

So, rotational losses (P_rot) = 2250 W - (1000 + 1.875 +5) W = 2250 - 1006.875 = 1243.125 W.

So at full load, the rotational losses are the same as at no load, since speed is roughly the same (shunt motors have almost constant speed). So we can use this P_rot in our full-load calculations.

Now, at full load, the armature current is 82 A. So let's compute the losses.

Shunt loss remains the same, 1000 W.

Armature loss (Pa) = Ia² Ra = (82)^2 * 0.3 = 6724 * 0.3 = 2017.2 W.

Brush drop loss (Pbr) = Ia * Vbrush = 82 * 2 = 164 W.

Rotational losses (P_rot) = 1243.125 W.

So total losses at full load (P_loss) = Psh + Pa + Pbr + P_rot.

So 1000 + 2017.2 + 164 + 1243.125 = let's compute step by step.

1000 + 2017.2 = 3017.2

3017.2 + 164 = 3181.2

3181.2 + 1243.125 = 4424.325 W.

Now, the total input is 42,000 W.

So the output power (Pout) = Pin - P_loss = 42,000 W - 4,424.325 W = 37,575.675 W.

Convert that to horsepower: since 1 hp = 746 W.

So 37,575.675 / 746 ≈ let me compute that.

37,575.675 ÷ 746 = let's see.

746 * 50 = 37,300. So 50 hp is 37,300 W. So 37,575.675 is 50.03 hp approximately? Wait, wait, but that can't be right because the losses are higher than I thought.

Wait, no, wait, 37,575.675 W is 50.03 hp. But wait, the given options have lower hp values, like around 47-52 hp. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let's double-check the numbers.

Wait, first, the input is 500 V * 84 A = 42,000 W, correct.

At full load, the losses are:

- Shunt loss: 2^2 * 250 = 1000 W, correct.
- Armature loss: 82^2 * 0.3. 82 squared is 6,724. 6,724 * 0.3 = 2,017.2 W, correct.
- Brush drop: 82 * 2 = 164 W, correct.
- Rotational losses: 1,243.125 W, correct.

So total losses: 1000 + 2017.2 = 3017.2; 3017.2 + 164 = 3181.2; 3181.2 + 1243.125 = 4424.325 W. So 4,424.325 W total losses.

So Pout = 42,000 - 4,424.325 = 37,575.675 W.

Convert to hp: 37,575.675 / 746 ≈ 50.35 hp.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that more accurately.

746 watts = 1 hp.

37,575.675 / 746 = ?

Let me compute this division.

746 * 50 = 37,300.

37,575.675 - 37,300 = 275.675.

So 275.675 / 746 ≈ 0.3696.

So total is approximately 50.3696 hp, say 50.37 hp.

But wait, looking at the options, some are close, like option J is 51.10 hp. Hmm, but perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the output is shaft power, so I should subtract all the losses from the input.

Wait, but I think I did that. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 42,000 W input. Losses are 4,424.325 W. So 42,000 - 4,424.325 = 37,575.675 W.

Yes, that's correct. So 37,575.675 W is about 50.37 hp.

But looking at the options, the closest is option J: 51.10 hp, but that's a bit higher. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational losses calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the no-load losses.

No-load input: V * I0 = 500 * 4.5 = 2250 W.

At no load, the losses are:

- Shunt loss: 2^2 * 250 = 1000 W.

- Armature loss: (2.5)^2 * 0.3 = 6.25 * 0.3 = 1.875 W.

- Brush drop: 2.5 * 2 = 5 W.

Sum: 1000 + 1.875 +5 = 1006.875 W.

So the rotational losses (P_rot) = no-load input - calculated losses = 2250 - 1006.875 = 1243.125 W. That seems correct.

So perhaps the output is indeed about 50.37 hp.

Now, let's compute the efficiency. Efficiency is output / input.

So η = (37,575.675 W) / (42,000 W) = 0.8945, or 89.45%.

Looking at the options:

Option H: 89.45%, 50.36 hp.

Wait, 50.36 hp matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait, 37,575.675 W is 50.37 hp, which is approximately 50.36 hp as in option H. And the efficiency is 89.45%, so option H is 89.45% and 50.36 hp.

Looking at the options:

H: 89.45%, 50.36 hp.

So that would fit.

But wait, let me check the other approach. Sometimes, in motor problems, the output is computed as (V - Ia Ra - brush drop) * Ia * efficiency factor? Wait, perhaps I'm confusing with another method.

Alternatively, perhaps the output can be computed as the armature power minus the losses.

Wait, the armature power is (V - Ia Ra - Vbrush) * Ia.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The armature input is V * Ia - Ia Ra (copper loss) - brush drop (Ia * Vbrush). So the armature output would be V * Ia - (Ia^2 Ra + Ia Vbrush).

Wait, but the total input to the motor is V * (Ish + Ia). The shunt loss is V * Ish, because Ish is V / Rsh.

Wait, maybe it's better to stick with the method I used earlier, calculating input and subtracting all losses.

But according to that method, the output is 50.37 hp, and efficiency is 89.45%. So option H.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, the output is about 50.37 hp, which aligns with option H's 50.36 hp, and the efficiency is 89.45%, which is exactly option H's first value.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To determine the horsepower output and efficiency of the shunt motor, the following steps were taken:

### Given Data:
- Voltage (\(V\)) = 500 V  
- Rated horsepower = 50 hp (likely output at full load)  
- No-load line current (\(I_0\)) = 4.5 A  
- Shunt field resistance (\(R_{sh}\)) = 250 \(\Omega\)  
- Armature resistance (\(R_a\)) = 0.3 \(\Omega\)  
- Brush drop (\(V_{brush}\)) = 2 V  
- Full-load line current (\(I_{fl}\)) = 84 A  

### Key Calculations:
1. **Shunt Field Current**:  
   \[
   I_{sh} = \frac{V}{R_{sh}} = \frac{500}{250} = 2 \, \text{A}
   \]

2. **No-Load Armature Current**:  
   \[
   I_{a0} = I_0 - I_{sh} = 4.5 - 2 = 2.5 \, \text{A}
   \]

3. **Full-Load Armature Current**:  
   \[
   I_{a} = I_{fl} - I_{sh} = 84 - 2 = 82 \, \text{A}
   \]

4. **Input Power at Full Load**:  
   \[
   P_{in} = V \cdot I_{fl} = 500 \cdot 84 = 42,000 \, \text{W}
   \]

5. **Losses at Full Load**:  
   - **Shunt Field Loss**:  
     \[
     P_{sh} = I_{sh}^2 \cdot R_{sh} = 2^2 \cdot 250 = 1000 \, \text{W}
     \]
   - **Armature Copper Loss**:  
     \[
     P_{a} = I_{a}^2 \cdot R_{a} = 82^2 \cdot 0.3 = 2017.2 \, \text{W}
     \]
   - **Brush Drop Loss**:  
     \[
     P_{brush} = I_{a} \cdot V_{brush} = 82 \cdot 2 = 164 \, \text{W}
     \]
   - **Rotational Losses**:  
     At no load, the rotational losses (\(P_{rot}\)) are calculated as the difference between the no-load input and the sum of the no-load shunt, armature, and brush drop losses:  
     \[
     P_{rot} = V \cdot I_0 - (P_{sh} + P_{a0} + P_{brush0})
     \]
     where:  
     \[
     P_{a0} = I_{a0}^2 \cdot R_{a} = 2.5^2 \cdot 0.3 = 1.875 \, \text{W}, \quad P_{brush0} = I_{a0} \cdot V_{brush} = 2.5 \cdot 2 = 5 \, \text{W}
     \]
     \[
     P_{rot} = 500 \cdot 4.5 - (1000 + 1.875 + 5) = 2250 - 1006.875 = 1243.125 \, \text{W}
     \]

   Total losses at full load:  
   \[
   P_{loss} = P_{sh} + P_{a} + P_{brush} + P_{rot} = 1000 + 2017.2 + 164 + 1243.125 = 4424.325 \, \text{W}
   \]

6. **Output Power**:  
   \[
   P_{out} = P_{in} - P_{loss} = 42,000 - 4424.325 = 37,575.675 \, \text{W}
   \]

7. **Efficiency**:  
   \[
   \eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} = \frac{37,575.675}{42,000} \approx 0.8945 \, \text{or} \, 89.45\%
   \]

8. **Horsepower Output**:  
   Convert \(P_{out}\) to horsepower:  
   \[
   \text{HP} = \frac{P_{out}}{746} = \frac{37,575.675}{746} \approx 50.36 \, \text{hp}
   \]

### Final Answer:
- **Efficiency**: 89.45%  
- **Horsepower Output**: 50.36 hp  

From the given options, the closest match is **Option H**.
