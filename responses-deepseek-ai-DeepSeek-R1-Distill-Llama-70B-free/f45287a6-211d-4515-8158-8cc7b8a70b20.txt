Okay, I need to figure out which of these options would most likely show examples of mitotic cell divisions. Hmm, I remember that mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells. It's common in areas where growth is happening because new cells are being produced.

So looking at the options, I should think about plant structures where cell division is active. Shoot tips, like the growing tips of stems or roots, are areas where a lot of growth occurs. Those areas have meristematic tissue, which is where mitosis happens frequently. So a longitudinal section of a shoot tip would probably show a lot of cells undergoing mitosis.

Wait, let me check the options. Option B is a longitudinal section of a shoot tip. That makes sense because shoot tips are where the plant grows taller, so they have a lot of dividing cells. Other options like muscle tissue (A) are from animals, and humans don't really do mitosis much except in specific tissues, and muscle cells are usually differentiated. So A might not show much mitosis.

Options C, E, F, and G are sections of other plant parts. A leaf vein cross section (C) or leaf cross section (E) might not have a lot of dividing cells since leaves are more about photosynthesis and are already developed. Similarly, a petal is part of a flower and probably not actively growing in terms of cell division. Seeds are also more about storing nutrients and maybe germinating, but I'm not sure if they have active cell division. 

Option H is an anther cross section. Anthers produce pollen, which involves meiosis because pollen is gametes. So H would show meiosis, not mitosis. So the correct answer should be B because shoot tips have meristematic cells actively dividing by mitosis.

To determine which option most likely provides examples of mitotic cell divisions, it's important to identify tissues or structures where active cell division occurs. Mitosis is common in areas of growth, such as meristematic tissues, which are found in shoot tips. A longitudinal section of a shoot tip (Option B) would reveal dividing cells because shoot tips are responsible for the growth of the plant, requiring frequent mitotic activity.

Other options are less likely to show mitotic divisions. For example:
- Muscle tissue (A) is from animals and typically consists of differentiated cells with little mitotic activity.
- Leaf veins (C), leaves (E), petals (F), and seeds (G) are more focused on functions like photosynthesis or nutrient storage, with limited cell division.
- Anthers (H) produce pollen, which involves meiosis rather than mitosis.

Thus, the best option is **B: longitudinal section of a shoot tip**, as it contains actively dividing meristematic cells undergoing mitosis.

Answer: B
