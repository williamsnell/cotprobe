Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about CSR outcomes according to Wood (1991). Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Wood's work.

I remember that CSR is about companies taking responsibility for their social and environmental impacts. But the question is specifically about the three outcomes as per Wood. I think Wood proposed a framework or model that categorizes CSR into different aspects.

Wait, I think Wood's model includes three main areas. I believe they are something like social policies, social programmes, and social impacts. Or was it something else? Let me try to remember. Oh right, Wood's 1991 paper discussed the different components of CSR, breaking it down into processes or outcomes.

So, the three outcomes he mentioned were probably social policies, which are like the rules or guidelines the company follows; social programmes, which are the actual initiatives or actions they take; and social impacts, which are the effects or results of those actions on society and the environment.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches these three. Let's go through them:

Option A: Social policies, Social responsibility, Social impacts. Wait, that includes social responsibility as a separate outcome, but I think the three outcomes are more specific than that. So maybe not A.

Option B: Social policies, Social evidencing, Social impacts. Evidencing doesn't ring a bell as one of the outcomes.

Option C: Social policies, Social audits, Social impacts. Audits are more like a process of checking, not an outcome.

Option D: Social policies, Social programmes, Social analysis. Analysis is part of assessing, not an outcome.

Option E: Social evaluations, Social programmes, Social impacts. Evaluations again are more about assessing than being an outcome.

Option F: Social policies, Social programmes, Social discussions. Discussions don't seem like an outcome.

Option G: Social policies, Social impacts, Social justice. Social justice is more of a goal than an outcome.

Option H: Social assessments, Social programmes, Social impacts. Assessments are evaluation tools, not outcomes.

Option I: Social planning, Social programmes, Social impacts. Planning is a process, not an outcome.

Option J: Social policies, Social programmes, Social impacts. Yes, this matches what I was thinking earlier. So J must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is based on Wood's (1991) identification of three outcomes of CSR, which are social policies, social programmes, and social impacts. These represent the guidelines, initiatives, and effects of CSR efforts, respectively.

Answer: J
