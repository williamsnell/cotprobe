Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about mercury barometers. Hmm, I've got to figure it out step by step. Let me think.

Alright, the question is about two mercury barometers. One has a cross-sectional area of 1 cm², and the other is 2 cm². The question is asking about the height of the mercury in the narrower tube compared to the wider one. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that barometers measure atmospheric pressure. The mercury barometer works by balancing the atmospheric pressure with the weight of the mercury column. Oh right, the basic principle is that the pressure exerted by the mercury column equals the atmospheric pressure.

So the formula for the pressure due to the mercury column is P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of mercury, g is gravity, and h is the height of the mercury. Oh wait, but wait—since the barometer is open to the atmosphere, the pressure inside equals the atmospheric pressure outside. So P equals the same for both barometers, assuming they're both measuring the same atmospheric pressure, right?

So let me think about the two barometers. One has area A1 = 1 cm², the other A2 = 2 cm². Since the pressure P is the same for both, P = ρgh. But wait, the formula I'm thinking of is P = (mass of mercury per unit area) * g, which is P = (ρ * h * A) * g / A. Oh wait, because the area is there in both mass and pressure. So maybe I should think in terms of the pressure equation.

Wait, pressure is force per area. The force exerted by the mercury column is due to gravity, so F = mass * g = (ρ * V) * g. Volume V is A * h, so F = ρ * A * h * g. Then pressure P is F/A, so P = ρgh. Oh, so the area A actually cancels out in the pressure equation. That means the height h of the mercury doesn't depend on the cross-sectional area of the tube. Because when you calculate P, the A cancels.

So both barometers, regardless of their tube areas, will have the same height of mercury. Because P is the same (assuming same atmospheric pressure), and since P = ρgh, h must be the same for both. 

Wait, but wait a second. Mercury is a liquid, and in a barometer, the tube is much longer than the height of the mercury. So the calculation I did holds because it's a matter of balancing pressure. So if the tube is narrower, the same pressure would support the same height because the area doesn't affect the height needed. Because P is ρgh, and h is determined by P. So the area of the tube doesn't change h.

So in this problem, the height of mercury in both barometers would be the same, regardless of the cross-sectional area. Because the formula P = ρgh doesn't involve the area. So the answer should be that the height is the same.

Looking at the options, option C says "the same", which should be the correct answer. So the narrower tube doesn't have a higher or lower mercury level; it's the same height as the wider tube because the pressure determines h, and the area cancels out.
</think>

The height of the mercury in a barometer is determined by the balance between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure exerted by the mercury column. The pressure \( P \) exerted by the mercury column is given by the formula:

\[
P = \rho g h
\]

where \( \rho \) is the density of mercury, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height of the mercury column. This equation shows that the height \( h \) depends only on the atmospheric pressure \( P \), the density of mercury \( \rho \), and gravity \( g \). The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the tube does not appear in this equation because it cancels out when deriving the pressure.

Since both barometers are measuring the same atmospheric pressure, the height \( h \) of the mercury will be the same in both tubes, regardless of their cross-sectional areas. Therefore, the height of the mercury in the narrower tube is the same as in the wider tube.

The correct answer is:

C: the same
