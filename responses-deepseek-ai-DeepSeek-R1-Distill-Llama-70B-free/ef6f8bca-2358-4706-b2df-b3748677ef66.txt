Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

An electron was accelerated through a potential difference of 1.00 ± 0.01 kV. What is the uncertainty of the position of the electron along its line of flight? The options are A to J.

Hmm, right. I remember that when a charged particle is accelerated through a potential difference, it gains kinetic energy. Oh wait, the potential difference here is 1.00 kV, which is 1000 volts. But there's an uncertainty of ±0.01 kV, so that's 1.00 ± 0.01 kV. I think the first step is to find the kinetic energy of the electron because of this acceleration.

Wait, the kinetic energy (KE) gained by an electron when accelerated through a potential V is given by KE = e * V, where e is the charge of the electron. Oh yeah, e is approximately 1.602 × 10^-19 coulombs. So KE = (1.602e-19 C) * (1000 V) = 1.602e-16 Joules. But wait, I'm not sure if I should consider the uncertainty in the voltage here. Oh, the question is about the uncertainty in position, so I think the uncertainty in the voltage will propagate into the uncertainty of the position.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how to calculate the uncertainty in position. I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Oh right, the principle states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is on the order of h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. So:

Δx * Δp ≈ h/(4π)

But I'm not sure if I can directly apply this here. Alternatively, maybe I should find the momentum of the electron first and then relate it to the position uncertainty.

Wait, the kinetic energy is related to momentum. The kinetic energy of the electron is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is the mass of the electron. So solving for p, p = sqrt(2m KE).

Let me compute that. Mass of the electron, m = 9.109e-31 kg. So plugging in, p = sqrt( 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-16 J ). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 2 * 9.109e-31 is about 1.8218e-30. Multiply that by 1.602e-16 gives 2.919e-46. The square root of that is sqrt(2.919e-46) ≈ 5.405e-23 kg m/s.

But wait, I'm not taking into account the uncertainty in the potential difference here. The potential has an uncertainty of ±0.01 kV, which is 10 volts. So the uncertainty in KE would be e * ΔV = 1.602e-19 C * 10 V = 1.602e-18 J. So the relative uncertainty in KE would be (1.602e-18)/(1.602e-16) = 0.01, or 1%. So the uncertainty in p would be about the same as the relative uncertainty in KE, since p is proportional to sqrt(KE). So Δp/p ≈ (ΔKE)/(2 KE) ) = 0.005, or 0.5% uncertainty in p.

Wait, but when I use the Heisenberg principle, I need the uncertainty in momentum. So maybe I can calculate Δp as some fraction of p. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as the uncertainty in the kinetic energy leading to an uncertainty in momentum, which in turn affects the uncertainty in position via the uncertainty principle.

Alternatively, I've heard that the uncertainty in position can be approximated using the de Broglie wavelength, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. The de Broglie wavelength λ is h/p. But that's more about the wavelength associated with the electron's motion, not directly the uncertainty in position.

Wait, but if I have the momentum p, then the uncertainty principle gives me Δx ≈ h/(Δp * 4π). Or maybe it's Δx = h/(4π Δp). So I need to find Δp, which is the uncertainty in momentum.

But how do I get Δp from the uncertainty in the potential difference? Since the potential difference affects the kinetic energy, which affects the momentum. So let's think about it step by step.

The potential V has an uncertainty ΔV. So the kinetic energy KE is eV, so ΔKE = eΔV. Then, since KE = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in KE relates to the uncertainty in p. Let's find that.

Let me define KE = p²/(2m). Taking differentials, ΔKE = (2p Δp)/(2m) ) = (p Δp)/m. So Δp = (m ΔKE)/(p).

But ΔKE is eΔV, so Δp = (m e ΔV) / p.

Wait, I can substitute p from earlier. Since p = sqrt(2m KE), which is sqrt(2m e V). So p = sqrt(2 m e V). Therefore, p is proportional to sqrt(V). So if V has a small uncertainty ΔV, the uncertainty in p would be (ΔV)/(2 sqrt(V)) ) times p. But I'm not entirely sure; perhaps I should proceed more carefully.

Let me compute p as a function of V. p = sqrt(2 m e V). Taking natural logs: ln p = 0.5 ln(2 m e) + 0.5 ln V. Differentiating both sides: (Δp)/p = 0.5 (ΔV)/V. So the fractional uncertainty in p is half the fractional uncertainty in V.

Since the potential has ΔV/V = 0.01/1.00 = 0.01 (1%), so Δp/p = 0.005 (0.5%). So Δp = 0.005 * p.

Wait, earlier I calculated p as approximately 5.405e-23 kg m/s. So Δp is 5.405e-23 * 0.005 = 2.7025e-26 kg m/s.

Now, applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Δx ≈ h/(4π Δp).

Plugging in the numbers, h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s. So:

Δx ≈ (6.626e-34) / (4 * π * 2.7025e-26 )

Let me compute the denominator: 4 * π ≈ 12.566. Multiply by 2.7025e-26: 12.566 * 2.7025e-26 ≈ 3.397e-25.

So Δx ≈ 6.626e-34 / 3.397e-25 ≈ approximately 1.95e-9 meters.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is 5.00e-9 m, option E is 1.22e-9, option A is 6.75e-10, etc. Hmm, my approximate calculation gives about 2e-9 m. But none of the options exactly match that. Wait, let me check my calculations more accurately.

Wait, let me recompute p. KE = eV = 1.602e-19 C * 1000 V = 1.602e-16 J.

p = sqrt(2m KE) = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-16 J).

Calculating inside the square root: 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-16 gives 2.919e-46. Square root is sqrt(2.919e-46) = sqrt(2.919) * 1e-23. sqrt(2.919) is approximately 1.708, so p ≈ 1.708e-23 kg m/s.

Wait, earlier I had 5.4e-23. Oh wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1.708e-23 is about 1.7e-23, not 5.4e-23. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Ah, yes, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me correct that.

So, p = sqrt(2 * m * KE) = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-16 J) = sqrt(2.919e-46 kg² m²/s²) = sqrt(2.919e-46) kg m/s = approximately 5.405e-23 kg m/s? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2.919e-46 under a square root would be sqrt(2.919) * 1e-23, which is around 1.708e-23, not 5.4e-23. Oh wait, I think I confused the exponents. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 2 * 9.109e-31 is 1.8218e-30. 1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-16 = (1.8218 * 1.602) * 1e-46. 1.8218 * 1.602 is about 2.919, so 2.919e-46. The square root of that is sqrt(2.919) * 1e-23, because sqrt(1e-46) is 1e-23. So sqrt(2.919) is about 1.708, so p ≈ 1.708e-23 kg m/s.

So earlier I must have made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps a miscalculation in exponents.

So now, the uncertainty in p, Δp, is 0.005 * p = 0.005 * 1.708e-23 = 8.54e-26 kg m/s.

Now, plug into Δx ≈ h/(4π Δp). h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So denominator is 4π * 8.54e-26 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 8.54e-26 ≈ 12.566 * 8.54e-26 ≈ 1.073e-24.

So Δx ≈ 6.626e-34 / 1.073e-24 ≈ approximately 6.17e-10 meters.

Wait, that's 6.17e-10 m. Looking at the options, option G is 3.09e-10 m, option A is 6.75e-10 m, which is close to my result. Hmm, but my calculation gives around 6.17e-10, and option A is 6.75e-10. That's pretty close. But wait, perhaps I made some approximations.

Wait, let me check more accurately. Let me compute Δx exactly.

Δx = h/(4π Δp) = 6.62607015e-34 / (4 * π * 8.54e-26)

Calculate denominator: 4 * π ≈ 12.566370614. Multiply by 8.54e-26: 12.566370614 * 8.54e-26 = (12.566370614 * 8.54) * 1e-26.

12.56637 * 8.54: Let's compute that.

12 * 8 = 96, 12 * 0.54 = 6.48; 0.56637 *8=4.53096, 0.56637 *0.54≈0.3059. So adding all parts:

Wait, perhaps better to compute 12.56637 * 8.54:

12.56637 * 8 = 100.53096

12.56637 * 0.54 = let's compute 12 * 0.54 = 6.48 and 0.56637 * 0.54 ≈ 0.3059, so total ≈6.48 + 0.3059 ≈6.7859.

So total is 100.53096 + 6.7859 ≈ 107.31686. So denominator is approximately 107.31686e-26, which is 1.0731686e-24.

So Δx = 6.62607015e-34 / 1.0731686e-24 ≈ let's compute that.

6.62607015e-34 / 1.0731686e-24 = (6.62607015 / 1.0731686) * 1e-10.

6.62607 / 1.0731686 ≈ approximately 6.176.

So Δx ≈ 6.176e-10 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.75e-10, which is close. But wait, perhaps because I approximated some steps, maybe the exact calculation would be a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately the value of p. Let's do that.

KE = eV = (1.602176634e-19 C) * (1.00e3 V) = 1.602176634e-16 J.

p = sqrt(2 * m * KE) = sqrt(2 * 9.1093837015e-31 kg * 1.602176634e-16 J).

Calculate 2 * 9.1093837015e-31 = 1.8218767403e-30.

Multiply by 1.602176634e-16: 1.8218767403e-30 * 1.602176634e-16 = let's compute that.

1.8218767403 * 1.602176634 ≈ 2.9213e0 (since 1.8 * 1.6 = 2.88, more accurately, 1.8218767 * 1.6021766 ≈ let me compute:

1.8218767 * 1.6021766:
Multiply 1.8218767 by 1.6021766:
≈1 *1.6021766 =1.6021766
0.8218767 *1.6021766 ≈ approx 1.3175 (since 0.8*1.6=1.28, 0.0218767*1.6≈0.034, so total ≈1.314)
So total ≈1.6021766 +1.314 ≈2.916.

So 1.8218767403e-30 * 1.602176634e-16 = 2.916e-46.

So p = sqrt(2.916e-46) = sqrt(2.916) * 1e-23. sqrt(2.916) ≈1.708, so p≈1.708e-23 kg m/s.

So Δp is 0.005 * 1.708e-23 = 8.54e-26 kg m/s.

Now, Δx = h/(4π Δp) = 6.62607015e-34 / (4 * π * 8.54e-26 )

Compute denominator: 4 * π ≈12.566370614.

12.566370614 * 8.54e-26 = let me compute 12.566370614 *8.54:

12 *8.54=102.48, 0.566370614 *8.54≈4.83, so total ≈102.48 +4.83≈107.31.

So denominator is 107.31e-26 = 1.0731e-24.

So Δx = 6.62607015e-34 / 1.0731e-24 ≈ (6.62607015 /1073.1) * 1e-10.

Wait, no: 6.62607e-34 / 1.0731e-24 = (6.62607 / 1.0731) ) * 1e-10.

Compute 6.62607 / 1.0731: Let's see, 1.0731 *6=6.4386, which is close to 6.62607. So 6.62607 /1.0731 ≈6.176.

So Δx≈6.176e-10 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.75e-10, which is close. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using exact values without approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the formula relating the uncertainty in position to the voltage uncertainty. Wait, I'm not recalling any direct formula, so perhaps I should stick with the approach I have.

Wait, but the options don't have 6.17e-10; the closest is option A at 6.75e-10, which is a bit higher, and option G is 3.09e-10, which is about half.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Δp. Let me think again. I had Δp = (m e ΔV ) / p.

Wait, earlier approach was using ΔKE = e ΔV, then using d(KE) = (p/m) dp, so Δp = (m ΔKE)/p = (m e ΔV)/p.

So Δp = (m e ΔV) / p.

Wait, let me compute this using exact values.

m = 9.1093837015e-31 kg.

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

ΔV = 0.01e3 V =10 V.

p = sqrt(2 m e V ) = sqrt(2 *9.1093837015e-31 *1.602176634e-19 *1e3 )

Wait, wait, V is 1e3 volts, right? So 2 m e V = 2 *9.1093837015e-31 *1.602176634e-19 *1e3.

Compute that:

2 *9.1093837015e-31 = 1.8218767403e-30.

Multiply by 1.602176634e-19: 1.8218767403e-30 *1.602176634e-19 = approx 2.921e-49.

Multiply by 1e3 (since V=1e3 V), 2.921e-49 *1e3 = 2.921e-46.

So p = sqrt(2.921e-46) = 1.708e-23 kg m/s, as before.

So
