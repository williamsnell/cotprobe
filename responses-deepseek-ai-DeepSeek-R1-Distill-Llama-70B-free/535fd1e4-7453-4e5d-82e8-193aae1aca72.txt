Okay, so I've got this problem here about a stereo purchase, and I need to find the finance charge on the installment plan. Let's see what the question says.

The cash price is $895. If I buy it on the installment plan, I have to pay 15% down and then 30 monthly payments of $29.42 each. I need to calculate the finance charge. Hmm, I remember that the finance charge is the extra amount you pay when you don't pay cash upfront. So it's like the total cost minus the cash price.

First, let's break down the payment. The down payment is 15% of $895. To find 15%, I can multiply 895 by 0.15. Let me do that: 895 * 0.15. Hmm, 900 * 0.15 is 135, but since it's 895, subtract 5 *0.15 which is 0.75, so 135 - 0.75 = 134.25. So the down payment is $134.25.

Now, the monthly payments are 30 of them at $29.42 each. So I need to find the total of these payments. 30 times 29.42. Let me calculate that. 30 * 29 is 870, and 30 * 0.42 is 12.6. So adding those together gives 870 +12.6 = 882.6. So the total of the monthly payments is $882.60.

Wait, but wait a second. The down payment is part of the total cost. So the total cost under the installment plan is the down payment plus the monthly payments. So that's 134.25 + 882.60. Let's add those: 134 + 882 is 1016, and 0.25 +0.60 is 0.85. So total is $1016.85.

The cash price is $895, so the finance charge is the total installment cost minus the cash price. So 1016.85 (total) minus 895 (cash). Let's subtract: 1016.85 - 895. Hmm, 1016 - 895 is 121, and 0.85 remains, so 121.85. So the finance charge is $121.85.

Looking at the options, option E is $121.85, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be E.

The finance charge is calculated by determining the total cost under the installment plan and subtracting the cash price. 

1. **Down Payment**: 15% of $895 is calculated as:
   \[
   895 \times 0.15 = 134.25
   \]

2. **Total Monthly Payments**: 30 payments of $29.42 each amount to:
   \[
   30 \times 29.42 = 882.60
   \]

3. **Total Installment Cost**: Adding the down payment and monthly payments:
   \[
   134.25 + 882.60 = 1016.85
   \]

4. **Finance Charge**: Subtracting the cash price from the total installment cost:
   \[
   1016.85 - 895 = 121.85
   \]

Thus, the finance charge is **$121.85**, which corresponds to option **E**.

Answer: E
