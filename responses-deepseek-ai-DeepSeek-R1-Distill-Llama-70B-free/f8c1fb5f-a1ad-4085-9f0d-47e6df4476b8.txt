Question:

A homeowner said to a roofer, "My roof leaks. I think the old tiles are cracked. If you will replace them with all new tiles, I will pay you $5,000. " The roofer replied, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule. " The homeowner then remarked, "That's all right, but let me know soon. " Three days later, the roofer drove his pickup truck to the homeowner's home and unloaded the materials and equipment needed to perform the roofing job. When the homeowner looked out his window and saw what was transpiring, he immediately ran outside and exclaimed, "Stop! The deal's off. I decided to repair the roof myself. "In an action by the roofer against the homeowner for breach of contract, which of the following would provide the roofer with his best theory of recovery?

Options:

A: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to reject the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.
B: The roofer can recover because the homeowner breached the contract by deciding to repair the roof himself.
C: A unilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule."
D: A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule. "
E: A bilateral contract was formed when the homeowner said, "That's all right, but let me know soon."
F: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a bilateral contract, and the roofer accepted the offer by purchasing the materials and equipment needed for the job.
G: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed for the job.
H: A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed to do the job.
I: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.
J: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a bilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer unloaded the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through it carefully.

The situation is about a homeowner and a roofer. The homeowner says his roof leaks because the old tiles are cracked and offers the roofer $5,000 to replace them with new tiles. The roofer replies, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule." The homeowner then says it's alright but to let him know soon. Three days later, the roofer shows up with his truck, unloads materials, and starts working. The homeowner sees this and tells him to stop, saying he's decided to do it himself.

The question is about the roofer suing for breach of contract. Which option gives the roofer the best chance to recover?

I remember that contracts can be unilateral or bilateral. Bilateral contracts involve mutual promisesâ€”each party makes a promise. Unilateral contracts involve one party making a promise in exchange for some action, not a promise to perform.

Looking at the initial offer: the homeowner says he'll pay $5,000 if the roofer replaces the tiles. That sounds like a unilateral contract because the homeowner is promising payment in exchange for the roofer's action (replacing tiles). The roofer's response was, "Sure, if I can clear my schedule." I think that's a bit ambiguous. Does that count as an acceptance?

Wait, in a unilateral contract, the acceptance is the performance, not a promise to perform. So if the offer is unilateral, the roofer's statement might not be enough to form a contract. Because he's saying he'll do it if he can clear his schedule, which is a conditional statement. That might be a counteroffer or just a statement of intent, not an acceptance.

Then the homeowner says, "That's all right, but let me know soon." So maybe the homeowner is giving the roofer time to decide, but the roofer hasn't definitely accepted yet.

Three days later, the roofer shows up and starts unloading materials. The homeowner then cancels. The issue is whether a contract was formed before the homeowner revoked the offer.

In unilateral contracts, the offer can be revoked any time before the offeree starts performance. Because the acceptance is the performance itself, the offeror can revoke the offer up until the point where the offeree begins performing.

Wait, but what if the offeree has started performance? If the roofer began unloading materials, has he started performance? If so, the offer might not be revocable anymore. Because under the doctrine of irrevocability, once the offeree begins substantial performance, the offeror can't revoke.

So the key here is whether the roofer had started performance when the homeowner revoked.

The roofer drove to the home and unloaded materials. That seems like he's started the job. So if the offer was unilateral, and the roofer started performance, the homeowner couldn't revoke the offer anymore.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. The initial offer was unilateral. So the roofer's actions would be the acceptance. But the roofer's initial response was just a statement about clearing his schedule. That might not be an acceptance yet. So maybe the offer was still open, and the roofer's arrival and unloading was the start of performance, which would be the acceptance.

So when the homeowner saw the roofer unloading, he tried to revoke. But if the roofer had already started performance, the offer can't be revoked. So the contract was formed, and the homeowner breached it.

Looking at the options now.

Option I says: The homeowner made an offer that was unilateral, and the roofer accepted by starting performance (unloading materials). So if the offer was unilateral and the roofer began performance, the contract is formed, and the homeowner can't revoke.

Option G says the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased materials. Hmm, but purchasing materials is preparation, not performance. So under the rule, it's when performance begins that the offer becomes irrevocable, not when preparation starts.

So if the roofer had started unloading (performance), then option I would be correct. Option I says the roofer accepted by starting performance, making the contract. So the homeowner can't revoke.

Option A says the roofer rejected the offer by starting performance, which doesn't make sense.

Option B says the homeowner breached, but it doesn't specify the contract type. But we need to see if a contract was formed.

Option C says a unilateral contract was formed when the roofer said "Sure...". No, because in unilateral contracts, the acceptance is performance, not a promise. So the roofer's statement was a promise, which would be a bilateral contract, but the offer was for a unilateral. So option C might be wrong.

Option D says a bilateral contract was formed when the roofer said that. Because in bilateral, both exchange promises. So the homeowner's offer was for a unilateral, but the roofer's response was a promise, which might have turned it into a bilateral. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the homeowner's offer was "I will pay you $5,000 if you replace the tiles." That's a unilateral offer because the roofer's acceptance is the act of replacing. The roofer's response was a conditional acceptance: "Sure, if I can clear my schedule." That sounds more like a bilateral contract because it's a promise to perform under a condition. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, maybe the initial offer was unilateral, and the roofer's response wasn't an acceptance but a statement. So the offer remained open, and the roofer's performance started three days later. At that point, he began performance, so the offer became irrevocable.

So option I would be correct because the offer was unilateral, and the roofer accepted by starting performance, making the contract. Then the homeowner's revocation was too late.

Looking back, the options:

Option I: Homeowner's offer was unilateral; roofer accepted by starting performance. So yes, that fits.

Option G: Offer became irrevocable when roofer purchased materials. But purchasing materials is not performance, so G is incorrect.

Thus, the best theory is option I.
</think>

The scenario involves a homeowner and a roofer negotiating a contract. The homeowner made an offer to pay $5,000 for the roofer to replace the roof tiles, which is best characterized as a **unilateral contract** because the homeowner's promise of payment was in exchange for the roofer's action (replacing the tiles). The roofer's response, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule," was not an acceptance but rather a conditional statement, leaving the offer open.

Three days later, the roofer arrived at the homeowner's house and began unloading materials, which constitutes the start of **performance**. Under the doctrine of unilateral contracts, the offer becomes **irrevocable once the offeree begins performance**. Therefore, when the homeowner attempted to revoke the offer at this point, it was too late, and a binding contract had already been formed.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** correctly states that the homeowner made a unilateral offer and the roofer accepted by starting performance (unloading materials). This aligns with the principle that performance, not a promise, constitutes acceptance in a unilateral contract.
- **Option G** incorrectly suggests that the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased materials. Purchasing materials is preparation, not performance, and does not make the offer irrevocable.
- Other options either mischaracterize the type of contract or fail to address the critical issue of when the offer became irrevocable.

Thus, the roofer's best theory of recovery is that the homeowner made a unilateral offer, and the roofer accepted by beginning performance, making the offer irrevocable.
