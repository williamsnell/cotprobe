Okay, so I've got this question about the MasterCard logo and the colors of its two circles. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that MasterCard is a well-known credit card company, and their logo is quite distinctive. I think it's been around for a while, so maybe I've seen it in various places like commercials, websites, or even on my own cards.

The logo, as I recall, has two overlapping circles. I'm pretty sure they're not just any random colors. Let me think about other credit card logos for comparison. Visa's logo is blue, I think, and maybe American Express has a centurion image. But MasterCard's is definitely the two circles.

Wait, I think one of the circles is red and the other is yellow. Or was it red and blue? Or maybe blue and green? I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should visualize the logo in my head. The circles overlap, and each has a solid color.

I've heard that MasterCard changed their logo a few years back, simplifying it. Before that, maybe the colors were different, but I think the main ones are red and yellow. Or wait, no, I'm getting that mixed up with another brand. McDonald's uses red and yellow, right? So that's probably why I'm confusing it.

Alternatively, I remember seeing the MasterCard logo on TV ads. The circles seem to be a bright red and a deep blue. Oh wait, no, that might be another company. I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, I think I've seen the logo where one circle is red and the other is blue. Like, the red is on one side and blue on the other, overlapping in the middle. That sounds familiar. Let me think about other clues. MasterCard's website or their brand guidelines—were the colors red and blue? I'm not entirely certain, but I'm leaning towards red and blue.

Looking at the options, option D is red and blue. So I'm guessing that's the correct answer. But wait, another thought—maybe the circles are yellow and red. Because I've seen some older logos with those colors. Or was that the original logo before they changed it?

No, I think the current logo uses red and blue. Because I remember when they rebranded, they went with those two colors. So yeah, I'll go with D: red and blue.

The MasterCard logo features two overlapping circles, and after considering various color combinations and recalling the brand's rebranding, the correct colors are red and blue.

Answer: D
