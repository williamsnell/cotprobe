Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the molar mass of a monoprotic weak acid. Hmm, let's see what I remember. Monoprotic acid means it donates one proton, right? So in reactions, it would react with a base in a 1:1 ratio. The question gives me some data: 26.3 mL of 0.122 M KOH is used to neutralize 0.682 grams of the acid. I need to find the molar mass of the acid.

Alright, let's break this down. Neutralization reactions between a monoprotic acid (HX) and a strong base like KOH would follow the equation: HX + KOH → KX + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of KOH used. Molarity is moles per liter, so multiplying volume (in liters) by molarity gives moles. The volume is 26.3 mL, which is 0.0263 liters. So moles of KOH would be 0.122 M * 0.0263 L. Let me calculate that: 0.122 * 0.0263. Hmm, 0.122 times 0.02 is 0.00244, and 0.122 times 0.0063 is about 0.0007686. Adding those gives approximately 0.0032086 moles of KOH.

Since the acid is monoprotic, the moles of acid should equal the moles of KOH used. So the acid also has 0.0032086 moles.

But wait, the mass of the acid is given as 0.682 grams. Molar mass is mass divided by moles. So I can find the molar mass by taking 0.682 grams divided by 0.0032086 moles.

Let me compute that. 0.682 / 0.0032086. Hmm, let's see. Maybe it's easier if I write it as 682 mg / 3.2086 mmol. Wait, no, grams to grams. So 0.682 divided by approximately 0.00321.

Calculating that: 0.00321 is about 3.21e-3. So 0.682 / 0.00321 = let's approximate. 0.00321 * 212 = 0.682. Because 0.00321 * 200 is 0.642, and 0.00321 *12 is about 0.0385. So 0.642 + 0.0385 is 0.6805, which is close to 0.682. So the molar mass is around 212 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 212 g/mol. So that's the answer.

To determine the molar mass of the monoprotic weak acid, we start by calculating the moles of KOH used in the neutralization reaction. The volume of KOH is 26.3 mL (or 0.0263 L), and its molarity is 0.122 M. Using the formula:

\[
\text{Moles of KOH} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume (in liters)} = 0.122 \times 0.0263 = 0.0032086 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Since the acid is monoprotic, the moles of acid required to neutralize the KOH are equal to the moles of KOH, i.e., 0.0032086 moles.

Next, we calculate the molar mass of the acid using the formula:

\[
\text{Molar Mass} = \frac{\text{Mass of Acid}}{\text{Moles of Acid}} = \frac{0.682}{0.0032086} \approx 212 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: 212 g mol⁻¹**
