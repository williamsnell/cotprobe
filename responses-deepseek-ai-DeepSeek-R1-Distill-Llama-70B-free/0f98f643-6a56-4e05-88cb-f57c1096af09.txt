Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to get a good grasp on Hardy-Weinberg stuff. But let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question is about blood types, specifically M, MN, and N. The population has 610 individuals. The gene frequencies are given: L^M is 0.62 and L^N is 0.38. I think I remember that in the MN blood group system, the M and N are alleles, right? So each person has two alleles, and there are three possible phenotypes: M (homozygous MM), MN (heterozygous), and N (homozygous NN).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Oh right, the M and N are codominant, so the heterozygote MN expresses both. So the phenotypes are determined by the alleles. Got it.

So, the problem must be using the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate the expected number of each phenotype in the population. Hardy-Weinberg equation is p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p is the frequency of one allele, q the other. Since there are only two alleles here, p + q should equal 1, which they do—0.62 + 0.38 = 1.0.

So first, I need to calculate the genotype frequencies. Let me jot that down.

p (L^M) is 0.62, and q (L^N) is 0.38.

The genotype frequencies would be:

- MM (homozygous M): p^2 → (0.62)^2
- MN (heterozygous): 2pq → 2*(0.62)*(0.38)
- NN (homozygous N): q^2 → (0.38)^2

Once I calculate these, I can multiply each by the total population (610) to get the number of individuals in each category.

Let me compute each part.

First, MM: 0.62 squared. Let me calculate that. 0.62 * 0.62. Hmm, 0.6 * 0.6 is 0.36, and then the extra 0.02 * 0.6 * 2 would be 0.024, and 0.02^2 is 0.0004. So total would be 0.36 + 0.024 + 0.0004 = approximately 0.3844. Wait, wait wait, maybe I should just do 62*62. 62*60 is 3720, 62*2 is 124, so 3720+124=3844. Then, since it's 0.62^2, that's (62/100)^2 = 3844/10000 = 0.3844. So MM is 0.3844.

Next, MN is 2pq. So 2 * 0.62 * 0.38. Let's compute that. 0.62 * 0.38 is... Let me think. 0.6 * 0.38 is 0.228, and 0.02 * 0.38 is 0.0076, so adding those gives 0.228 + 0.0076 = 0.2356. Then multiply by 2 → 0.4712. So MN is 0.4712.

Then NN is q squared: 0.38^2. 0.38 * 0.38. Calculating that: 38 * 38 is 1444, so (0.38)^2 is 0.1444.

Now, let's check if these add up to approximately 1. So 0.3844 + 0.4712 + 0.1444 = 0.3844 + 0.4712 is 0.8556, plus 0.1444 gives exactly 1. Perfect.

Now, multiply each by the population size, 610.

Starting with MM: 0.3844 * 610. Let me compute this.

0.3844 * 600 is 230.64, and 0.3844 *10 is 3.844. So 230.64 + 3.844 = 234.484. Since you can't have a fraction of a person, I think we round to the nearest whole number. So approximately 234. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 234 for M. Hmm, maybe I should recheck the multiplication.

Wait perhaps a better way is to compute 610 * 0.3844.

610 * 0.3 is 183, 610 *0.08 is 48.8, 610*0.0044 is approximately 610*0.004=2.44, and 610*0.0004=0.244. So adding those:

183 +48.8 =231.8; 231.8 +2.44=234.24; +0.244=234.484. So yes, 234.48, which would round to 234. But wait, when dealing with people, you can't have a fraction, so perhaps it's 234.

Wait, but let's proceed and see if the numbers in the options match.

MN is 0.4712 *610. Let's calculate that.

0.4712 * 600 = 282.72.

0.4712 *10=4.712.

So 282.72 +4.712=287.432. So approximately 287.43, so 287 when rounded.

NN is 0.1444 *610. Let's compute:

0.1 *610=61, 0.04*610=24.4, 0.0044*610≈2.684. So adding: 61 +24.4=85.4 +2.684=88.084. So approximately 88.08, which rounds to 88.

So the numbers are:

M:234, MN:287, N:88.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N. That's very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a small error in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

Let me compute 0.3844 * 610:

0.3844 * 610:

Break it down as 0.3 * 610 = 183.

0.08 *610 = 48.8.

0.0044 *610: 610 * 0.004 is 2.44, 610 *0.0004 is 0.244. So 2.44 + 0.244 = 2.684.

Adding all together: 183 +48.8 =231.8 + 2.684 =234.484.

So 234.484, which is 234 when rounded down, but sometimes when the decimal is .5 or more, you round up. Here it's .484, so 234.

Wait, but let me double-check with another approach. Perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm calculating.

Alternatively, 62^2 is 3844, so 0.62^2 = 0.3844.

So 0.3844 * 610.

Compute 3844 * 610, then adjust the decimal.

Wait, no, that's not needed. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 610 * 0.3844.

Alternatively, 610 * 0.3844 = 610 * (0.3 + 0.08 + 0.0044) = 183 + 48.8 + 2.684 = 234.484.

So yes, 234.484 people for M, which would be 234 when rounded.

MN: 0.4712 *610.

Compute this as 4712 * 610, then adjust decimals.

Wait, 0.4712 *610 = (0.4 *610) + (0.07 *610) + (0.0012*610).

0.4 *610=244.

0.07 *610=42.7.

0.0012 *610=0.732.

So 244 +42.7=286.7 +0.732=287.432. So 287.432, which would be 287.

NN: 0.1444 *610.

Compute as 1444 * 610, then adjust.

Wait, 0.1444 *610 = (0.1 *610) + (0.04 *610) + (0.0044*610) =61 + 24.4 +2.684= 88.084.

So 88.084 → 88.

So the numbers are M:234, MN:287, N:88.

Looking back at the options, option H is 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N.

Wait, but my calculation for M gives 234.48, which is 234.48. So that's 234 when rounded to the nearest whole number, but perhaps the question expects rounding up to 235 because 0.48 is almost half.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute more precisely.

Wait, 0.3844 *610: Let me do 610 * 0.3844.

Multiply 610 by 3844 (ignoring the decimal for a moment). Wait, that's a big number.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 610 * 0.38 = 231.8; 610 *0.0044=2.684. So 231.8 + 2.684 =234.484.

So 234.484, which is 234 when rounded down, 235 when rounded to nearest.

Wait, but 0.484 is less than 0.5, so it rounds down to 234.

Hmm. So according to that, the correct numbers would be 234, 287, 88.

Looking at the options, option H is 235, 287,88. Close but M is 235. But my calculation says 234. Maybe I made a mistake in the gene frequencies calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the initial computation.

p = 0.62, q=0.38.

p^2 = (0.62)^2 = 0.3844.

2pq = 2*(0.62*0.38) = 2*(0.2356) = 0.4712.

q^2= 0.38^2=0.1444.

Yes, that's correct.

So the numbers are 0.3844*610=234.484 →234.

0.4712 *610=287.432 →287.

0.1444*610=88.084 →88.

So the correct counts are 234 M, 287 MN, 88 N.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H: 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy in the M count? Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses rounding at each step, which could change the outcome.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question assumes that the sum of the three should be exactly 610, so after rounding each number, maybe the sum is slightly off, and they adjust.

Wait, let's sum 234+287+88.

234+287=521, +88=609. Oh wait, that's 609, but the population is 610. So perhaps there's a rounding adjustment.

So maybe one of the numbers is rounded up. Like, perhaps the M is 234.484 →234, which is 234, but if another category rounds up, the total would be 610.

Wait, MN is 287.432 →287, and N is 88.084 →88.

So 234 +287 +88 =609. So we are one short. So perhaps the 0.484 for M is rounded up to 234 +1=235, making the total 610.

Alternatively, perhaps the MN was 287.432 →287, but if it's 287.43, which is 287, but maybe one of the other numbers is rounded up.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculation was intended to have 235, 287, 88, which adds up to 235+287=522 +88=610 exactly.

So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of p^2.

Wait, 0.62 *0.62: 62 *62=3844, so 0.62 squared is 0.3844. Yes.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is considering different rounding rules, like rounding to the nearest integer at each step, which might cause a slight difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual calculation is 0.3844 *610 = ?

Let me compute 3844 *610 /10000.

Wait, 3844 *610 = ?

Compute 3844 * 600= 2,306,400.

Compute 3844 *10=38,440.

Add them: 2,306,400 +38,440=2,344,840.

Now, 2,344,840 divided by 10,000 is 234.484. So yes, same result.

So 234.484, which rounds to 234. So the M count is 234, MN 287, N 88. Sum is 609, so perhaps the question expects us to round one of them up to make 610.

Wait, perhaps the MN count is 287.432, which is 287.43, so could be 287 or 287. But when you add 234+287+88=609, so perhaps one of the numbers is rounded up by one to make the total 610.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct counts are 235, 287, 88. Let's see: 235 +287=522 +88=610.

So perhaps in the question, they rounded 234.48 up to 235.

So in that case, option H is correct.

Looking at the options, option H is: 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N.

So the correct answer would be option H.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate the expected number of individuals with M, MN, and N blood types in a population of 610. The allele frequencies are given as \( p = 0.62 \) (L\(^M\)) and \( q = 0.38 \) (L\(^N\)). The genotype frequencies are calculated as follows:

1. **MM (homozygous M):** \( p^2 = (0.62)^2 = 0.3844 \)
2. **MN (heterozygous):** \( 2pq = 2(0.62)(0.38) = 0.4712 \)
3. **NN (homozygous N):** \( q^2 = (0.38)^2 = 0.1444 \)

Next, we multiply these genotype frequencies by the total population size (610) to find the number of individuals for each phenotype:

1. **MM:** \( 0.3844 \times 610 = 234.484 \), which rounds to 234.
2. **MN:** \( 0.4712 \times 610 = 287.432 \), which rounds to 287.
3. **NN:** \( 0.1444 \times 610 = 88.084 \), which rounds to 88.

Adding these rounded values gives \( 234 + 287 + 88 = 609 \), which is one less than the total population of 610. To account for this discrepancy, we round the MM count up from 234 to 235, making the total \( 235 + 287 + 88 = 610 \).

Thus, the correct counts are 235 M, 287 MN, and 88 N. Comparing these values to the options provided, the closest match is **Option H: 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N**.

Answer: H
