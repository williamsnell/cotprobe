Okay, so I have this question about when the cyber-security discourse emerged. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the exact timeline, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is asking when politicians, academics, and others started taking cyber-security seriously. The options are from various decades.

First, I know that the internet as we know it today became more widespread in the 1990s, with the World Wide Web emerging around 1991. So maybe that's when people started talking about security more, right? But wait, wasn't there some earlier stuff?

I remember hearing about the first computer viruses and worms in the 1980s. Like, the Creeper virus in 1971, but that's more of an experimental thing. Then the Morris Worm in 1988, which was a big deal because it was one of the first major attacks on the internet. So that might have started getting some attention in the late 80s.

But when did it become a real discourse, like a serious topic in policy and academia? The 1990s probably saw more of that because the internet was expanding rapidly. Governments and companies were getting online, so they'd need to secure their systems. Maybe that's when it started being a major topic.

Wait, but the question is about when they began to talk seriously. So the 1980s had some incidents, but maybe the real shift came in the 90s. Like, the first firewalls and security measures started being developed then.

I think the term "cybersecurity" itself gained traction in the 90s. Before that, it was more about computer security in general. So the discourse as a coherent field probably started taking shape in the 1990s.

Looking at the options, D is 1990s. So I think that's the correct answer.

The cyber-security discourse began to take shape in the 1990s as the internet expanded and became more integral to society. This period saw increased awareness and the development of security measures, making it the time when the topic became a serious focus.

Answer: D
