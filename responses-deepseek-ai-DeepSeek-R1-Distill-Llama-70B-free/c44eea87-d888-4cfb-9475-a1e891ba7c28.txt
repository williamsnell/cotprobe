Question:

Consider the following code segment.

D: num1 < num2 && num1 < num3
E: num1 == num2 && num1 > num3
F: num1 < num2 || num1 < num3

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this programming logic question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a while loop that's controlled by a condition involving three variables: num1, num2, and num3. The loop runs as long as num1 is greater than num2 or greater than num3. So the condition is (num1 > num2 || num1 > num3). The body of the loop will execute if this condition is true.

The question is asking which option is sufficient to guarantee that the loop body will never execute. That means we need to find a condition where the while loop's condition is false from the start, so it doesn't run at all.

The variables num1, num2, and num3 are initialized to value1, value2, and value3 respectively. But we don't know their specific values, so we have to work with the conditions given in the options.

Let me think about when the while loop condition is false. The loop condition is (num1 > num2) OR (num1 > num3). For the entire condition to be false, both parts must be false. So:

- num1 > num2 must be false. Which means num1 <= num2.
- num1 > num3 must also be false. So num1 <= num3.

Both of these must be true simultaneously for the condition to be false, meaning the loop won't run.

So the condition that ensures the body is never executed is when num1 is less than or equal to both num2 and num3. So, num1 <= num2 AND num1 <= num3.

Now, looking at the options to see which one satisfies this.

Option A: num1 < num3. Well, that's only part of it. It doesn't say anything about num2. So even if num1 is less than num3, if num1 is greater than num2, the loop will run. So this doesn't guarantee the condition is false.

Option B: num1 == num3 && num1 > num2. Here, num1 is equal to num3, but greater than num2. So in this case, the condition (num1 > num2) is true, so the loop would run. So this doesn't help.

Option C: num1 > num2 || num1 < num3. That's a bit tricky. If num1 is greater than num2, the loop condition is true. So in cases where num1 is greater than num2, regardless of num3, the loop runs. So this condition is the opposite of what we want. So this isn't the right option.

Option D: num1 < num2 && num1 < num3. Wait, this looks good. Because if num1 is less than both num2 and num3, then num1 is definitely not greater than either. So the condition (num1 > num2 || num1 > num3) becomes false. So the loop won't execute. This seems like a correct answer.

Option E: num1 == num2 && num1 > num3. Here, num1 is equal to num2 and greater than num3. So the condition is num1 > num3 is true. So the loop runs. So this isn't the right option.

Option F: num1 < num2 || num1 < num3. This means that num1 is less than at least one of them, but not necessarily both. For example, if num1 is less than num2 but greater than num3, then the condition (num1 > num3) is true, so the loop runs. So this doesn't guarantee the condition is false.

Option G: num1 == num2 || num1 == num3. So num1 could be equal to either. But if num1 equals num2, but is greater than num3, then the loop condition is true. So this doesn't ensure the loop doesn't run.

Option H: num1 < num2. That only ensures that num1 is not greater than num2, but doesn't say anything about num3. So if num1 is greater than num3, the loop will run. So this isn't sufficient.

Option I: num1 > num2 && num1 > num3. This is the opposite; it's the condition where the loop will definitely run. So this is not correct.

So the correct option is D: num1 < num2 && num1 < num3. Because if num1 is less than both, the condition (num1 > num2 || num1 > num3) is false, meaning the loop body never executes.

To determine which condition guarantees that the loop body is never executed, we analyze the loop condition: `num1 > num2 || num1 > num3`. For the loop to not execute, both `num1 > num2` and `num1 > num3` must be false. This means `num1 <= num2` and `num1 <= num3` must both be true simultaneously.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A: `num1 < num3`**  
  This only ensures `num1 <= num3` but does not guarantee `num1 <= num2`. If `num1 > num2`, the loop will execute.  
  **Not sufficient.**

- **B: `num1 == num3 && num1 > num2`**  
  Here, `num1 > num2` is true, so the loop condition is satisfied, and the loop will execute.  
  **Not sufficient.**

- **C: `num1 > num2 || num1 < num3`**  
  If `num1 > num2` is true, the loop condition is satisfied, and the loop will execute. This does not guarantee the loop will not run.  
  **Not sufficient.**

- **D: `num1 < num2 && num1 < num3`**  
  This ensures `num1 <= num2` and `num1 <= num3`. Both parts of the loop condition are false, so the loop will not execute.  
  **Sufficient.**

- **E: `num1 == num2 && num1 > num3`**  
  Here, `num1 > num3` is true, so the loop condition is satisfied, and the loop will execute.  
  **Not sufficient.**

- **F: `num1 < num2 || num1 < num3`**  
  This ensures `num1 <= num2` or `num1 <= num3`, but not necessarily both. If `num1 > num3`, the loop condition is satisfied.  
  **Not sufficient.**

- **G: `num1 == num2 || num1 == num3`**  
  If `num1 == num2` but `num1 > num3`, the loop condition is satisfied, and the loop will execute.  
  **Not sufficient.**

- **H: `num1 < num2`**  
  This ensures `num1 <= num2` but does not guarantee `num1 <= num3`. If `num1 > num3`, the loop condition is satisfied.  
  **Not sufficient.**

- **I: `num1 > num2 && num1 > num3`**  
  This is the opposite of what we need. Both conditions for the loop to execute are satisfied.  
  **Not sufficient.**

### Conclusion:
The only condition that guarantees the loop body will never execute is **D: `num1 < num2 && num1 < num3`**, as it ensures both `num1 > num2` and `num1 > num3` are false.
