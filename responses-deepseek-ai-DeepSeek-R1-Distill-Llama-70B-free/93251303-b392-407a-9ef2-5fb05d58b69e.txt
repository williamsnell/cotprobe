Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Which of the following correctly illustrates why price (P) equals marginal revenue (MR) under perfect competition, and why price (P) is greater than marginal revenue under monopoly or imperfect competition? I. MR = P = demand on horizontal function for perfect competition. II. P > MR as downward sloping functions for imperfect competition. III. Demand and Price are represented as a vertical function for imperfect competition.

Options:

A: II and III, with the addition of IV. Demand and Price are represented as a downward sloping function for monopoly.
B: I, II and III, with the addition of IV. Demand and Price are represented as a horizontal function for perfect competition.
C: I and II.
D: I and III.
E: I, II, and III.
F: I only.
G: II only.
H: I and III, with the addition of IV. MR = P = demand on downward sloping function for monopoly.
I: III only.
J: II and III.

Okay, so I've got this question about economics, specifically about perfect competition and monopoly. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking why, under perfect competition, price (P) equals marginal revenue (MR), and why under monopoly or imperfect competition, P is greater than MR. There are three statements provided, I, II, and III, and I need to evaluate which are correct along with any additional statements they mention.

I remember that in perfect competition, firms are price takers. That means they can't influence the market price because there are so many firms producing a homogeneous product. So, for them, the demand curve is horizontal. Because of this, when they sell an additional unit, they don't have to lower the price for all units. Therefore, MR should equal P because each additional unit sold brings in the same revenue as the price. So statement I says MR = P = demand on a horizontal function. That sounds right.

Now, under imperfect competition or monopoly, the situation is different. Firms are price setters because they have market power. So their demand curve is downward sloping. When they sell an additional unit, they have to lower the price for all units, which means that MR is less than P. So statement II says P > MR as downward sloping functions for imperfect competition. That makes sense.

Statement III says that demand and price are represented as a vertical function for imperfect competition. Wait, vertical function? That doesn't sound right. I think in imperfect competition, the demand curve is still downward sloping, not vertical. A vertical demand curve would mean that quantity doesn't change with price, which isn't the case. So statement III must be incorrect.

Looking at the options, let's see. The answer must include correct statements I and II, but exclude III. So let me look at the options:

Option C is I and II. That seems correct. But wait, let me check all the options.

Option A: II and III, plus IV. But statement III is wrong, so A is out.

Option B: I, II, III plus IV. But III is wrong, so B is out.

Option C: I and II. Correct as I and II are right, III is wrong. So C is a possibility.

Option D: I and III. III is wrong, so D is out.

Option E: All three, but III is wrong.

Option F: Only I. That ignores II, which is correct.

Option G: Only II. That leaves out I, which is correct.

Option H: I and III plus IV. III is wrong, so H is out.

Option I: Only III. Wrong.

Option J: II and III. III is wrong, so J is out.

So the correct option is C: I and II. Looking back, the options are labeled A to J.

Wait, the options in the question are labeled A to J, but the possible answers are combinations of I, II, III, and sometimes IV. Let me re-express the options:

Option C says "I and II." So that would mean statements I and II are correct, which matches our conclusion.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

The question asks why price (P) equals marginal revenue (MR) under perfect competition and why P is greater than MR under monopoly or imperfect competition. 

- **Statement I**: Correct. Under perfect competition, firms are price takers with a horizontal demand curve. Since they cannot influence the market price, MR equals P.
- **Statement II**: Correct. Under imperfect competition or monopoly, firms face a downward sloping demand curve. To sell more, they must lower the price, making MR less than P.
- **Statement III**: Incorrect. Imperfect competition does not have a vertical demand curve; it has a downward sloping demand curve.

Evaluating the options, only **Option C (I and II)** includes the correct statements without including the incorrect ones.

Answer: C
