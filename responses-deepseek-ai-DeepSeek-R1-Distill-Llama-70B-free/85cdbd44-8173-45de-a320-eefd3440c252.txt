Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the percentage increase in Victoria's population over ten years. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the current population is 42,600, and ten years ago it was 30,000. I need to find the percent increase. Hmm, percentage increase... I remember that the formula for percentage increase is ((New Value - Original Value)/Original Value) * 100%.

So, applying that formula here, the new value is 42,600 and the original is 30,000. Let me subtract 30,000 from 42,600. That gives me 12,600. So the population increased by 12,600 over ten years.

Now, I need to divide this increase by the original value. So that's 12,600 divided by 30,000. Let me do that calculation. 12,600 รท 30,000 equals... Well, 30,000 goes into 12,600 0.42 times because 0.4 times 30,000 is 12,000, and 0.02 times 30,000 is 600, so together that makes 0.42.

Then, to get the percentage, I multiply by 100%, so 0.42 times 100 is 42%. So the percentage increase is 42%.

Wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 30,000 times 0.42 is indeed 12,600. Adding that to 30,000 gives 42,600, which matches the current population. So my calculation seems correct.

Looking at the options, option I is 42%, which should be the correct answer.

To calculate the percentage increase in Victoria's population, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Original Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Here, the new population is 42,600, and the original population is 30,000. The increase is:

\[
42,600 - 30,000 = 12,600
\]

Dividing the increase by the original population:

\[
\frac{12,600}{30,000} = 0.42
\]

Multiplying by 100% gives:

\[
0.42 \times 100\% = 42\%
\]

Thus, the percentage increase is **42%**, which corresponds to option I.
