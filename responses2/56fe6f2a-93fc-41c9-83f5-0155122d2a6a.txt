Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistics problem, and I need to figure out the probability of committing a Type I error when doing multiple hypothesis tests. Let me start by breaking down the question.

The question says: Suppose I did 10 independent tests, each testing H0: μ = 25 versus Ha: μ < 25, at a significance level α = 0.05. I need to find the probability of committing a Type I error and incorrectly rejecting the true H0 with at least one of the 10 tests.

Hmm, right. Type I error is when we reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true. So, the significance level α = 0.05 means that for each individual test, there's a 5% chance of a Type I error. But wait, if I'm doing multiple tests, what happens then?

I remember that when you perform multiple hypothesis tests, the probability of making at least one Type I error increases. This is because each test has a 5% chance, and with 10 tests, the chance of at least one error is higher.

Wait, how do I calculate that? Oh, right, it's 1 minus the probability of not making a Type I error in any of the tests. Because the probability of not making a Type I error in one test is 1 - α. So for multiple tests, it's (1 - α)^n, where n is the number of tests.

But wait, wait—because in this case, each test is independent. So the probability that none of the 10 tests make a Type I error is (1 - 0.05)^10. Then, the probability that at least one test makes a Type I error is 1 minus that.

So mathematically, that's 1 - (0.95)^10. Let me calculate that. 0.95^10 is approximately... Hmm, I might remember that 0.95^10 is about 0.5987. So 1 - 0.5987 is about 0.4013. So approximately 40.13%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 0.40. But let me double-check.

Wait, wait, the question is about the probability of incorrectly rejecting a true H0 with at least one of the 10 tests. So yes, that's the same as the probability of at least one Type I error across all tests. That's exactly what I calculated as approximately 0.40.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: for each test, the probability of a Type I error is 0.05. For 10 independent tests, the probability of at least one Type I error is 1 minus the probability that all 10 are correct.

So, 1 - (0.95)^10. Let's compute that more accurately.

Let me compute 0.95^10. I can use logarithms or approximate. 0.95^10 ≈ 0.59874. So 1 - 0.59874 = 0.40126, which is approximately 0.4013. So, about 40.13% chance.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.40. So the answer should be J.

The probability of committing a Type I error when testing 10 independent hypotheses at α=0.05 is calculated as 1 - (1 - α)^n, which is approximately 0.40. 

Answer: J
