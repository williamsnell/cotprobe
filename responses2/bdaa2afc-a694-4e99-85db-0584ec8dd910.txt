Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these distributions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem says: There's a device with three components. Each component has a lifetime with a given pdf. The question is about the probability that the device fails in the first hour. Oh, and the hint says that G(y) is the probability that Y is less than or equal to y, which is equal to 1 minus the probability that all three components fail after y. So, that sounds like it's using the complementary probability to find the failure probability.

First, I need to understand the pdf given. The pdf is f(x) = (2x)/(10^2) e^{-(x/10)^2}, where x is the lifetime in hours, and it's defined for 0 < x < infinity. Hmm, that looks a bit like the pdf of a normal distribution because of the exponent, but let me think more clearly. The general form of a normal distribution is (1/(σ√(2π))) e^{-(x-μ)^2/(2σ²)}, but this has a different structure. Wait, maybe it's a normal distribution scaled somehow.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Rayleigh distribution? Because the exponent has (x/10)^2, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a normal distribution. But regardless, I think the specific form of the pdf might not be crucial for solving the problem because the question is about the probability that all three components survive beyond a certain time, and then the failure happens in the first hour.

Wait, no, because the device fails when any component fails. So, the device fails if any of the three components fail. So, the probability that the device fails in the first hour is the probability that at least one component fails in the first hour.

Given that, the problem is to compute the probability that the device fails in the first hour. The hint says that G(y) is the probability that Y <= y, which is equal to 1 minus the probability that all three > y. So, G(y) = 1 - P(X1 > y, X2 > y, X3 > y). Because the components are independent, the joint probability that all three are greater than y is the product of each individual probability that each is greater than y.

So, the probability that the device fails in the first hour is P(X1 ≤ y, X2 ≤ y, X3 ≤ y) = 1 - P(X1 > y, X2 > y, X3 > y). So, to find this, I can compute 1 minus the product of the probabilities that each component survives beyond y, which is 1 - [P(X > y)]^3.

But wait, the question is about the device failing in the first hour. So, that's when the time is exactly 1 hour, but perhaps in the context of continuous distributions, it's about the probability that the time is less than or equal to 1, but I think the question is about the probability that the device fails in the first hour, meaning the time to failure is less than or equal to 1. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says, "the device fails with the failure of one of the components." So, the device fails when any component fails. So, the device fails in the first hour if any of the three components fails by time 1. So, the device is still operational if all three components are still working after 1 hour.

So, the probability that the device fails in the first hour is the probability that at least one component fails by time 1. So, the complementary probability is that all three are still working after 1 hour. So, P(failure in first hour) = 1 - P(all three > 1). Because if all three are working after 1 hour, the device is still operational. So, if any component fails before or at 1 hour, the device fails.

So, P(all three > 1) = [P(X > 1)]^3, since the components are independent. Therefore, P(failure in first hour) = 1 - [P(X > 1)]^3.

Now, I need to compute P(X > 1). Since the pdf is given, P(X > 1) is the integral from 1 to infinity of f(x) dx. Alternatively, since the hint says G(y) = P(Y <= y) = 1 - P(all three > y), that's G(y) = 1 - [P(X > y)]^3.

Wait, but in this case, G(y) is the CDF of the minimum of the three variables. Because the minimum of the three would be the first failure time. So, the CDF for the minimum, which is T = min(X1, X2, X3), is G(y) = 1 - [P(X > y)]^3.

So, G(y) = P(T <= y) = 1 - [P(X > y)]^3.

But in our case, the device fails when any component fails, which is the first failure time. So, P(T <=1) is the probability that the device fails in the first hour. So, P(T <=1) = G(1) = 1 - [P(X >1)]^3.

So, I need to compute P(X>1) first. Let's compute that.

The pdf is f(x) = (2x)/(10^2) e^{-(x/10)^2}.

So, f(x) = (2x/100) e^{-(x²)/100}.

Wait, perhaps a substitution would help. Let me let t = x/10. So, x = 10t, and dx = 10 dt.

So, f(x) = (2*(10t)/100) e^{-( (10t)^2 )/100} *10 dt.

Simplify this:

2*(10t)/100 = (20t)/100 = (2t)/10 = 0.2t.

e^{-(100 t²)/100} = e^{-t²}.

Multiply by 10 dt: So, f(x) = 0.2t * e^{-t²} * 10 dt = (2t) e^{-t²} dt.

Wait, but that's the same as the original function, so maybe substitution isn't helping much. Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be solved using substitution.

Wait, but maybe I can compute the integral of f(x) from 1 to infinity.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is a Rayleigh distribution, since the exponent is quadratic and the form is similar to the Rayleigh CDF. But the Rayleigh distribution has pdf (x/σ²) e^(-x²/(2σ²)), which is similar to our form. Wait, let me check:

In our case, f(x) = (2x/(10²)) e^{-(x/10)^2}.

So, 2x/(10^2) is 2x/100, which is 0.02x. The exponent is -(x^2)/(10^2) = -(x^2)/100.

So, it's similar to a Rayleigh distribution with scale parameter σ = 10, because the Rayleigh pdf is (x/σ²) e^{-x²/(2σ²)}.

Wait, let's see:

If σ = 10, then Rayleigh pdf is (x/(10)^2) e^{-x²/(2*(10)^2)} = (x/100) e^{-x²/200}.

But our function is (2x/100) e^{-x²/100}, which is double the x term. So, perhaps it's a scaled version. Alternatively, perhaps it's a modified normal distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is manageable. Let me try to compute P(X >1).

So, the integral from x=1 to x=∞ of f(x) dx.

f(x) is (2x/100) e^{-x²/100}.

So, ∫_{1}^∞ (2x/100) e^{-x²/100} dx.

Let me make a substitution: u = x²/100 → du = (2x/100) dx → du = (x/50) dx → dx = 50 du/x → but wait, maybe a better substitution.

Let me let u = x²/100 → du = (2x/100) dx → (2x/100) dx = du → so the integral becomes ∫_{u=1^2/100}^{u=∞} e^{-u} du.

Wait, that's right. Because when x=1, u= (1)^2/(100) = 1/100. And as x approaches infinity, u approaches infinity.

So, the integral becomes ∫_{1/100}^∞ e^{-u} du, which is [ -e^{-u} ] evaluated from 1/100 to ∞.

Which is [0 - (-e^{-1/100}) ] = e^{-1/100}.

So, P(X>1) = e^{-1/100}.

So, e^{-0.01} because 1/100 is 0.01. But wait, I thought earlier substitution was u = x²/100, which leads to du = (2x/100) dx. So, the integral is ∫ (2x/100) e^{-x²/100} dx from 1 to inf is equal to ∫ e^{-u} du from u=1/100 to infty, which is e^{-1/100}.

So, yes, P(X>1) = e^{-1/100}.

Now, the probability that all three components are greater than 1 is [e^{-1/100}]^3 = e^{-3/100}.

Therefore, the probability that the device fails in the first hour is 1 - e^{-3/100}.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because the device fails when any component fails. So, the probability that the device fails in the first hour is the probability that at least one component fails by time 1. But wait, I thought earlier that it's the complement of all three surviving beyond 1. But the correct way is that the probability that any component fails before or at time 1 is the same as 1 minus the probability that all three survive beyond 1.

So, yes, that's correct. So, P(device fails in first hour) = 1 - [P(X>1)]^3 = 1 - [e^{-1/100}]^3 = 1 - e^{-3/100}.

So, now I need to compute 1 - e^{-0.03}, because 3/100 is 0.03.

Calculating e^{-0.03} approximately: I know that e^{-x} can be approximated by 1 - x + x²/2 - x^3/6 + ... for small x.

So, e^{-0.03} ≈ 1 - 0.03 + (0.03)^2/2 - (0.03)^3/6.

Calculating each term:
0.03 is 0.03.
(0.03)^2 = 0.0009 → divided by 2 is 0.00045.
(0.03)^3 = 0.000027 → divided by 6 is 0.0000045.

So, e^{-0.03} ≈ 1 - 0.03 + 0.00045 - 0.0000045 ≈ 1 - 0.03 + 0.0004455 ≈ 0.9704455.

So, 1 - e^{-0.03} ≈ 1 - 0.9704455 = 0.0295545.

So, approximately 0.02955, which is about 2.955% chance.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: 0.02, or G: 0.03. Wait, 0.02955 is approximately 0.03, but the options are F: 0.02, G: 0.03.

Wait, but the options have 0.03 as G. So, 0.02955 is about 0.03, so the answer would be G: 0.03.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Because earlier, I thought that P(X>1) is e^{-1/100}, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me re-examine the integral. ∫_{1}^∞ (2x/100) e^{-x²/100} dx. Let me let u = x²/100, so du = (2x/100) dx. So, that's exactly the integrand. So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=1^2/100}^∞ e^{-u} du = ∫_{1/100}^∞ e^{-u} du = [ -e^{-u} ] from 1/100 to ∞ = 0 - (-e^{-1/100}) = e^{-1/100}.

Yes, so that's correct. So, P(X>1) is e^{-1/100}, which is e^{-0.01} ≈ 0.99005. Wait, wait a moment—that can't be right because e^{-0.01} is approximately 0.99005? Wait, no, wait. No, e^{-0.01} is approximately 0.99005? No, wait, wait, let me compute e^{-0.01} correctly.

Wait, e^0 is 1. e^{-0.01} is about 1 - 0.01 + (0.01)^2/2 - (0.01)^3/6 + ... So, 0.01 is 0.01, 0.0001/2 is 0.00005, and 0.000001/6 is ~0.0000001667. So, up to the second term, e^{-0.01} ≈ 1 - 0.01 + 0.00005 = 0.99005. So, P(X>1) = e^{-0.01} ≈ 0.99005.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because if the pdf is (2x/100) e^{-x²/100}, then as x increases, the pdf is e^{-x²/100}, which decreases exponentially. So, the probability that X>1 is e^{-1/100} ≈ 0.99005? That would imply a high probability, but that doesn't make sense because the pdf is decreasing and for x=1, the value is (2*1/100) e^{-1/100}, which is about 0.02 * e^{-0.01} ≈ 0.02 * 0.99005 ≈ 0.0198. So, the pdf at x=1 is about 0.02, and for higher x, it's much lower. So, the area under the curve from 1 to infinity would be a small value. Wait a second, I thought earlier that the integral of the pdf from 1 to infinity is e^{-1/100}, which is about 0.99005. But that can't be right because the pdf is being multiplied by x, so perhaps my substitution was correct, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me re-calculate the integral. The integral is ∫_{1}^∞ (2x/100) e^{-x²/100} dx. Let u = x²/100 → du = (2x/100) dx → (2x/100) dx = du → dx = 50 du/x. But wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, since u = x²/100 → x = sqrt(100 u) → dx = (1/(2 sqrt(100 u))) * 100 du → 50 / sqrt(100 u) du → 50/(10 sqrt(u)) du → 5/(sqrt(u)) du.

Wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating, but perhaps a better approach is to let t = x^2, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the integral numerically.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try a different substitution. Let u = x/10 → so x = 10u, dx =10 du. Then, the integral becomes:

∫_{x=1}^{x=∞} (2x/100) e^{-x²/100} dx → ∫_{u=1/10}^{u=∞} (2*(10 u)/100) e^{-( (10u)^2 )/100} * 10 du.

Simplify:

(20u/100) = (2u)/10 = 0.2u.

e^{-(100 u^2)/100} = e^{-u^2}.

Multiply by 10 du: 0.2u * e^{-u²} *10 du = 2u e^{-u²} du.

So, the integral becomes ∫_{1/10}^∞ 2u e^{-u²} du.

Let me make a substitution: let z = u² → dz = 2u du → 2u du = dz. So, when u=1/10, z= (1/10)^2 = 1/100.

So, the integral becomes ∫_{1/100}^∞ e^{-z} dz = [ -e^{-z} ] from 1/100 to ∞ → 0 - (-e^{-1/100}) = e^{-1/100}.

So, yes, that's correct. So, P(X>1) = e^{-1/100} → which is e^{-0.01} ≈ 0.99005. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the pdf is (2x/100) e^{-x²/100}, and at x=1, the pdf is (2/100) e^{-1/100} ≈ 0.02 * 0.99005 ≈ 0.0198. So, the pdf at x=1 is about 0.0198, which is quite high for a pdf, but the pdf decreases exponentially as x increases. So, the integral from x=1 to infinity would be the area under the curve, which would be e^{-1/100} since the substitution led us to that.

But wait, if e^{-1/100} is about 0.99005, then the probability that X>1 is 0.99005, which is a high probability, implying that the device fails with high probability, which can't be because the device fails when any component fails. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the interpretation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check again.

Wait, the integral ∫_{1}^∞ (2x/100) e^{-x²/100} dx. Let me set u = x²/100 → du = (2x/100) dx → (2x/100) dx = du → so the integral becomes ∫_{1/100}^∞ e^{-u} du → which is e^{-1/100}.

So, that's correct. Therefore, P(X>1) = e^{-1/100} ≈ 0.99005.

Wait, but that would mean that the probability that any component fails before time 1 is 1 - [e^{-1/100}]^3 → which is 1 - e^{-3/100} → which is approximately 1 - e^{-0.03} ≈ 1 - 0.97045 → 0.02955, which is about 0.03, so 3%.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.03, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 0.02

B) 0.03

C) 0.04

D) 0.05

E) 0.06

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options are:

A: 0.02

B: 0.03

C: 0.04

D: 0.05

E: 0.06

So, the correct answer is G:0.03.

Wait, but let me double-check. So, the probability that the device fails in the first hour is 1 - [e^{-1/100}]^3.

Since e^{-1/100} ≈ e^{-0.01} ≈ 0.99005.

So, [e^{-0.01}]^3 ≈ (0.99005)^3 ≈ 0.99005 * 0.99005 = 0.980199 * 0.99005 ≈ approximately 0.980199 * 0.99005 ≈ 0.9704.

Wait, wait a second. So, [e^{-0.01}]^3 ≈ e^{-0.03} ≈ 0.97045.

So, 1 - 0.97045 ≈ 0.02955, which is approximately 0.03. So, that's the correct answer.

So, the answer is G:0.03.
</think>

The problem involves a device with three independent components, each having a failure time described by the probability density function (pdf):

$$f(x) = \frac{2x}{100} e^{-x^2/100}.$$

To determine the probability that the device fails in the first hour, we first compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at \(x = 1\). The CDF is given by:

$$P(X > 1) = \int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx.$$

Using the substitution \(u = x^2/100\), we find:

$$\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{2x}{100} e^{-x^2/100} \, dx = \int_{1/100}^{\infty} e^{-u} \, du = e^{-1/100}.$$

Thus, the probability that one component fails before \(x = 1\) is \(e^{-1/100} \approx 0.99005\). The probability that all three components survive beyond \(x = 1\) is:

$$(e^{-1/100})^3 = e^{-3/100} \approx 0.97045.$$

Therefore, the probability that the device fails in the first hour is:

$$1 - e^{-3/100} \approx 1 - 0.97045 = 0.02955.$$

This value is approximately 0.03, so the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: G**
