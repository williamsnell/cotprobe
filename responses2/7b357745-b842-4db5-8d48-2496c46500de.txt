Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the rate of return on a preferred stock. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember that preferred stock has a fixed dividend rate, so the rate of return is based on that dividend relative to the price you paid for it.

The question says the preferred stock has a 5 and a half percent rate. Wait, that's the dividend percentage. The par value is $50, and it's selling for $52 and three-quarters. So the first thing I need to figure out is the annual dividend amount.

Okay, so the dividend rate is 5.5%. The par value is $50, so the dividend per year should be 5.5% of $50. Let me calculate that: 5.5% of 50 is 0.055 * 50 = $2.75 per year.

Now, the stock is selling for $52.75. To find the rate of return, I take the annual dividend and divide it by the current market price. So that's $2.75 divided by $52.75. Let me do that division. 2.75 / 52.75. Hmm, I can approximate this.

Let me think: 52.75 goes into 2.75 how many times? It's less than one, so 0.0523 approximately. Wait, maybe 0.0523 is about 5.23%, but wait, that's if I do it exactly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate it more precisely.

Wait, let me compute it properly. 2.75 divided by 52.75. Let's see, 52.75 is the same as 5275/100, so 2.75 is 275/100. So 275/100 divided by 5275/100 is 275/5275. Let me compute that fraction.

275 ÷ 5275. Let's see: 5275 ÷ 275. Hmm, 275 * 19 is 5225, which is close to 5275. So 19 * 275 = 5225. Then 5275 -5225 is 50. So 5275 is 19 and 50/275, which is 19.1818... So the reciprocal is 1/(19.1818) ≈ 0.05217. So 5.217%. Approximately 5.22%.

Wait, but the options don't have 5.22%, so I need to check. Let me look at the options again. The options are 4.5%, 4.8, 5.7, 5.5, 6, 5.2, 4.2, 5, 6.5,7.0.

Wait, I got approximately 5.22%, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rate is to be given to the nearest 1/10 percent, which is 0.1% increments. So 5.22% would round to 5.2%, which is option F. But wait, when I calculated it, I got 5.217, which is about 5.22%, so 5.2% is the closest.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes I might have messed up the calculation. Let me double-check. The dividend is 5.5% of $50, which is $2.75, correct. The price is $52.75. So $2.75 divided by $52.75. Let me do it more accurately.

Calculating 2.75 / 52.75:

Well, 52.75 is 5275 cents, and 2.75 is 275 cents. So 275 / 5275.

Dividing numerator and denominator by 25: 275 ÷25=11, 5275 ÷25=211. So 11/211. Let me compute that.

11 ÷ 211 ≈ 0.05217, which is 5.217%, which rounds to 5.2%. So the rate is approximately 5.2%, which is option F.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the required rate is 5.5% minus the market price effect. Wait, no, that doesn't apply here. The rate is based on the dividend divided by the price.

Another approach: Maybe the stock is selling at a premium, so the rate is lower than the dividend rate. So the rate is 5.2%, which is just under 5.22%, so 5.2% is correct.

Looking back at the options, F is 5.2%. So the answer should be F.

To calculate the rate of return on a preferred stock, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Rate of Return} = \frac{\text{Dividend per Period}}{\text{Current Market Price}}
\]

1. **Dividend Calculation**: The preferred stock has a 5.5% dividend rate with a par value of $50. Thus, the annual dividend is:
   \[
   5.5\% \times \$50 = \$2.75
   \]

2. **Market Price**: The stock is selling for \$52.75.

3. **Rate of Return Calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{\$2.75}{\$52.75} \approx 0.05217 \text{ or } 5.217\%
   \]

4. **Rounding**: Rounded to the nearest 1/10%, this is 5.2%.

5. **Answer**: The closest option is F: 5.2%.
