Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about variance decomposition analysis of vector autoregressions (VARs). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question lists four statements (i to iv), and I need to determine which are true. The options are combinations of these statements, so I need to evaluate each statement's validity.

Let me read each statement again:

i) Variance decompositions measure the impact of a unit shock to each of the variables on the VAR.

Hmm, I remember that variance decomposition breaks down the variance of each variable into shocks to each variable in the system. So a unit shock to each variable affects the variance of the system, and the decomposition tells how much each variable contributes. So statement i sounds correct.

ii) Variance decompositions can be thought of as measuring the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable.

Yes, that rings a bell. Decompositions usually show the percentage or fraction of the forecast variance that each variable's shocks contribute. So ii is correct.

iii) The ordering of the variables is important for calculating impulse responses but not variance decompositions.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Impulse responses are about the effect of shocks on the variables over time, right? But impulse responses usually involve the ordering of variables because you have to represent the system in a specific order. However, variance decomposition is about the sources of variance, not the timing of the shocks. So the ordering affects how you decompose the variance but not the impulse responses themselves. So statement iii is correct.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. Impulse responses are about the dynamic effects of shocks (like a shock to a specific variable) on the system. So the ordering is crucial because, in a VAR, variables are ordered in a way that reflects their impact. For example, if you have variables Y, X, Z, an impulse response to Y's shock will show how Y affects each variable over time.

But variance decomposition, on the other hand, is a static analysis. It shows how much each shock contributes to the variance of the entire system. So in that case, the ordering of variables might not matter for the decomposition. Because the variance is the sum of the shocks from all variables, regardless of their order. So when you do a variance decomposition, you don't need to specify the order of variables. So statement iii says that ordering is important for calculating impulse responses but not for variance decompositions. That's correct because impulse responses depend on the ordering (as it's the time series order) but variance decomposition doesn't need it.

iv) It is usual that most of the forecast error variance for a given variable is attributable to shocks to that variable.

I think this is true. In a VAR model, a variable is usually influenced a lot by shocks from itself. So its forecast error variance is dominated by the shocks to itself. But maybe not always, but generally, that's the case. So statement iv is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check each statement. Let's go through them again.

i: Correct, because each variable's shock contributes to the variance of the system, and decomposition breaks it down.

ii: Correct, because it's the proportion of forecast error.

iii: Correct, because impulse responses depend on ordering (as they're dynamic effects) but variance decomposition doesn't.

iv: Correct, because the variables are modeled as a system, so each variable's shock contributes a lot to its variance.

So all four statements (i, ii, iii, iv) are correct. But wait, let me check the options.

The options are A to J. Let me see:

Looking at the options:

A: (i), (ii) and (iv) only. So if i, ii, iv are correct, this would be A.

But wait, were any statements wrong? Let me think again.

Wait, statement iii: "The ordering of the variables is important for calculating impulse responses but not variance decompositions." Yep, that's correct. So iii is correct.

So all four statements are correct, meaning the correct answer would be option J: all four statements correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) only.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

The options are:

A: (i), (ii), (iv) only

B: (ii), (iii) only

C: (i), (ii) only

D: (ii), (iii), (iv) only

E: (ii), (iv) only

F: (i), (iii) only

G: (iii) and (iv) only

H: (i) and (iv) only

I: (i), (ii), and (iii) only

J: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)

So if all four are correct, the answer is J.

Wait, but I thought statement iii was correct. Let me think about it again.

In impulse responses, the ordering is important because you have to define which variable is which. For example, impulse responses show how each variable responds to a shock. So if you order variables as X, Y, Z, a shock to X will affect Y and Z in a certain way. But variance decomposition isn't about that. It's a static decomposition where you add up all the variances. So yes, ordering matters for impulse responses, not for variance decomposition.

So all the four statements are correct. Therefore, the correct answer is J.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think: in the variance decomposition, you don't care about the order of variables because it's a global measure. So iv says it's usual that most of the forecast error variance for a given variable is attributable to shocks to that variable. That's correct, because each variable is influenced by shocks to itself. So yes, iv is correct.

So all four statements are correct. Thus, the correct answer is J.

To determine which statements about variance decomposition analysis of VARs are true, let's evaluate each statement:

1. **Statement (i): Variance decompositions measure the impact of a unit shock to each of the variables on the VAR.**  
   This is correct. Variance decomposition breaks down the variance of each variable into contributions from shocks to each variable in the system.

2. **Statement (ii): Variance decompositions can be thought of as measuring the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable.**  
   This is correct. Variance decomposition often expresses the proportion of forecast error variance attributed to each variable's shocks.

3. **Statement (iii): The ordering of the variables is important for calculating impulse responses but not variance decompositions.**  
   This is correct. Impulse responses depend on the ordering of variables because they represent dynamic effects of shocks, which vary with the system's structure. However, variance decomposition is static and does not require ordering.

4. **Statement (iv): It is usual that most of the forecast error variance for a given variable is attributable to shocks to that variable.**  
   This is correct. In VAR models, each variable is influenced predominantly by shocks to itself, as the system is modeled in a way that reflects its interdependencies.

Since all four statements (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are true, the correct answer is:
