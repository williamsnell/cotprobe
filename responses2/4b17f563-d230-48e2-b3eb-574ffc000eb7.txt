Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about percent change in expenses for a retailer. Let me see what the question says.

In Canada in 2014, soybeans averaged $0.24 per pound. In 2015, it was $0.16 per pound. The retailer bought 20,000 pounds in 2014. I need to find the percent change in expenses from 2014 to 2015.

Hmm, percent change is calculated by (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value * 100%. So, let's break it down.

First, I'll calculate the total expense in 2014. That's the price per pound times quantity, which is 0.24 * 20,000. Let me do that math: 0.24 * 20,000 = 4,800 dollars.

Then, the expense in 2015 would be 0.16 * 20,000. That's 0.16 * 20,000 = 3,200 dollars.

Now, the change in expenses is 3,200 - 4,800 = -1,600 dollars. That's a decrease of $1,600.

To find the percent change, I take (-1,600) / (4,800) * 100%. Let's compute that. -1,600 divided by 4,800 equals -0.3333... So, multiplying by 100% gives about -33.33%.

Looking at the options, option G is –33%, which matches this calculation. So the correct answer should be G.

The percent change in expenses is calculated by:

\[
\text{Percent Change} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

**2014 Expenses:**
\[
0.24 \times 20,000 = 4,800 \text{ dollars}
\]

**2015 Expenses:**
\[
0.16 \times 20,000 = 3,200 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Change:**
\[
3,200 - 4,800 = -1,600 \text{ dollars (decrease)}
\]

**Percent Change:**
\[
\frac{-1,600}{4,800} \times 100\% = -33.33\%
\]

**Answer: G: –33%**

ANSWER: G
