Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the correct expression for the total number of cookies Paul ate over two weeks. Let me read it again.

Last week, Paul ate 2 cookies each day for 5 days. This week, he ate 2 cookies each day for 4 days. They're asking which expression represents the total number of cookies he ate in these two weeks. The options are A to I.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, last week, he ate 2 cookies a day for 5 days. So that's 2 multiplied by 5, which is 10 cookies. This week, it's 2 cookies a day for 4 days, so 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8 cookies. To find the total, I should add those two amounts together, so 10 plus 8 is 18 cookies.

Now, looking at the options. Let me evaluate each one:

Option A: (5+4) x2. That would be 9 x2 =18. That's correct, but wait, why is it adding 5 and 4 and multiplying by 2? Oh, because 5 is the number of days last week, 4 is the number of days this week, and each day he ate 2. So 5+4 is total days (9), multiplied by 2 is 18.

Option B: (2+5)+(2+4). That's 7 +6=13. That's wrong because that's adding the daily amounts instead of the total.

Option C: 2x (5+4). That's 2x9=18. That's correct because it's 2 cookies per day for (5+4) days, which adds up to 9 days, 2x9=18.

Option D: (2x5)x(2x4). That's 10x8=80. That's way too high because he only ate 10 and 8, not 10 and 8 multiplied.

Option E: 2x(5-4). That's 2x1=2. That's way too low.

Option F: (2+5)x(2+4). That's 7x6=42. That's way too high because he only ate 10 and 8.

Option G: 2x (5x4). That's 2x20=40. Also too high.

Option H: 2x5x4. That's 40. Again, too high.

Option I: 2x(4x5). That's 2x20=40. Same as above.

So both option A and C give the correct total of 18. Wait, but looking at the expressions, option C uses multiplication around the sum, which is the correct approach because the total days are 5+4. So option C: 2 multiplied by (5+4) equals 18, which is correct.

Wait, but looking again at option A: (5+4) is 9 days, times 2 is 18, which is correct. So both A and C are correct, but wait, I thought the question was asking for the expression that represents the total. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: (5+4) x2 → 9x2=18
B: (2+5)+(2+4) →7+6=13
C: 2x (5+4) →2x9=18
D: (2x5)x(2x4) →10x8=80
E: 2x(5-4) →2x1=2
F: (2+5)x(2+4) →7x6=42
G: 2x (5x4) →2x20=40
H: 2x5x4 →40
I: 2x(4x5)→40

So both A and C give 18. But wait, option A is (5+4) ×2, which is 9×2=18. Option C is 2×(5+4)=2×9=18. So both are correct. But wait, looking back, perhaps the question is which expression is correct, and both A and C are correct. But let's see the options again.

Wait, the problem says "the correct expression" but the options include both A and C as possible. Wait, but the options are A to I, and the correct answer is one of them. Wait, but looking at the options, both A and C would give the same result. Let me recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says the last week he ate 2 cookies each day for 5 days, this week 2 each day for 4 days. So total is 5×2 +4×2=10+8=18.

Looking at the options, which of these expressions would equal 18.

Option A: 5+4=9, multiplied by 2 →18.

Option C: 2 × (5+4)=2×9=18.

So both A and C are correct. But perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is correct. Wait, let me think about the structure of the expressions.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to add the two totals: (5×2)+(4×2) = 10 +8=18. So the expression is 5×2 +4×2. But looking at the options, none of them directly show that. So let's see if any of the options can be rewritten to match 10+8.

Looking at option F: (2+5)x(2+4)=7×6=42. That's way too high.

Option B: (2+5)+(2+4)=7+6=13. No.

Option D: (2×5) × (2×4)=10×8=80, way too high.

Option E: 2×(5-4)=2×1=2. No.

Option A: (5+4)×2 →9×2=18.

Option C: 2×(5+4)=2×9=18.

So both A and C are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a trick.

Wait, the question says: "which expression can be used to represent the total number of cookies Paul ate in these two weeks?" So the correct total is 18. Both A and C evaluate to 18, so they are both correct expressions.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only one of them is correct. Maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the options. Let me double-check each.

Option A: (5+4)*2 →9*2=18. Correct.

Option C: 2*(5+4)=2*9=18. Correct.

So both A and C are correct. But the options are presented as separate choices, so perhaps the answer is either A or C. But looking at the options, for the first week, it's 5 days, each day 2 cookies. Second week, 4 days, each day 2. So the total is 10 +8=18.

Looking at the options, both A and C are correct. Wait, but the user is to select one answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me reevaluate the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Wait, the problem is about the total number of cookies, which is (5×2)+(4×2)=10+8=18.

Looking at the options:

Which of the following expressions equals 18?

Option A: (5+4)*2 →9×2=18.

Option C: 2*(5+4) →2×9=18.

So both A and C evaluate to 18. But the question is asking for the expression that represents the total. Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is A, because in the first week, 5 days, each day 2, so 5×2=10. Second week, 4×2=8. So the total is 10+8=18. The expression would be (5×2)+(4×2)=10+8=18. But looking at the options, none of them directly show this. The only options that add up to 18 are A and C.

Wait, perhaps the expression is written differently. Let me check each option again.

Option A: (5+4)*2 →9×2=18.

Option C: 2*(5+4)=18.

So both are correct. But the user is to select one. Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is either A or C. But looking at the options, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, but in the given options, both A and C evaluate to 18, so perhaps the correct answer is both A and C. But since the options are separate, perhaps I'm to choose the correct one based on the structure of the expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the options are presented. Wait, the options are labeled A to I, and each is a separate option. So the answer is which option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is which expression represents the total. So, the correct expressions are both A and C. But the user might have options where only one is correct. But I think in the initial problem, the correct expressions are both A and C, but perhaps only one of them is listed as an option. Looking back, yes, option A is (5+4)x2, and option C is 2x(5+4). Both evaluate to 18. So both are correct. But perhaps the question expects the first expression, which is (5+4) multiplied by 2, which is 18.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the total to be expressed as (5+4)*2, which is option A.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to think that the total is (5×2)+(4×2) =10+8=18. So the expression would be 5×2 +4×2. But looking at the options, none of them show that. So perhaps the question is designed to have option A and C as correct, but since both are there, perhaps the correct answer is either. But the user is to select one option.

Wait, but in the given options, both A and C evaluate to 18, so perhaps the correct answer is both A and C. But since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is either. But the user is to select one, but the options may have both A and C as correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem is: last week, he ate 2 cookies a day for 5 days → 5×2=10. This week, 2 cookies a day for 4 days →4×2=8. Total is 10+8=18.

So the correct expression is either (5+4)*2 or 2*(5+4), which are both 18.

So both options A and C are correct.

But the options are presented as A to I, and the user must select one. Wait, but perhaps I'm supposed to choose the one that uses multiplication around the sum, which is more common, and that's option C: 2x(5+4).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm a bit confused because both are correct. Wait, but looking back, the problem says "which expression can be used to represent the total number of cookies Paul ate in these two weeks?" So the total is 18, and both expressions are correct.

Wait, but the user is to provide one answer, so perhaps the correct answer is either A or C, but since I can't choose both, perhaps I should pick one. Wait, but looking at the options again, the answer is option A and C. But perhaps the correct answer is both. But the user is to choose one, so perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another way. The total is 5×2 +4×2 =10+8=18. So, the expression would be (5×2) + (4×2) =18. But none of the options show that. So the options that represent this are A and C.

Wait, but perhaps the correct way is to add the two totals, so 5×2 +4×2, but since none of the options do that, perhaps the correct options are A and C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is (5+4)*2.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to represent the total is 5×2 +4×2 =10+8=18. So the expression is 10+8, but since that's not an option, perhaps the way the expressions are structured.

Wait, perhaps the correct expressions to choose are A and C, but since I can only pick one, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 5 days at 2 cookies is 10, 4 days at 2 is 8. Total is 18. Both A and C give 18, so both are correct. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C, but the options don't allow for that. Wait, but the user is to select one option, so perhaps the correct answer is both, but in the options, both A and C are present.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because the problem says "his total number of cookies", perhaps it's intended to represent the sum of both weeks.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are presented, the correct answer is both A and C, but since only one can be selected, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: (5+4)x2, which is 9x2=18. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused, but I think I should proceed by selecting option A as the correct answer.

The total number of cookies Paul ate is calculated by summing the cookies from both weeks. Last week, he ate 5 days × 2 cookies/day = 10 cookies. This week, he ate 4 days × 2 cookies/day = 8 cookies. Adding these together gives 10 + 8 = 18 cookies.

To represent this with an expression, we can either add the two totals (10 + 8 = 18) or use multiplication around the sum, as in 2 × (5 + 4) = 18. Both expressions correctly represent the total number of cookies.

Looking at the options, both A and C evaluate to 18. However, since only one answer can be selected, the most straightforward expression is (5 + 4) × 2, which is option A.
