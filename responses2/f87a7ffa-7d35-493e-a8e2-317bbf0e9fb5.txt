Question:

A common method for commercially peeling potatoes is to soakthem for 1 - 5 minutes in a 10 - 20% solution ofNaOH (molecularweight = 40.0 g/mole) at 60 - 88°C, and to spray offthe peel once the potatoes are removed from solution. As aneconomy measure, a manufacturer titrates theNaOH solutionwith standardized H_2SO_4 (molecular weight = 98.0 g/mole) at the end of each day to determine whether the solutionis still capable of peeling potatoes. If, at the end of oneday, he finds that it takes 64.0 ml of a 0.200 M solution ofH_2SO_4 to titrate a 10.0 ml sample ofNaOHsolution to neutrality, what concentration ofNaOHdid he find?

Options:

A: 2.56 M
B: 0.32 M
C: 0.16 M
D: 1.28 M
E: 5.12 M
F: 2.00 M
G: 4.00 M
H: 3.12 M
I: 1.92 M
J: 0.64 M

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titration and NaOH solution concentration. Hmm, I remember that titration involves adding a solution of known concentration to a solution of unknown concentration until the reaction is neutralized. Oh right, the NaOH and H2SO4 are reacting. Wait, NaOH is a strong base and H2SO4 is a strong acid, so they should neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio, right?

The problem says that at the end of a day, 64.0 ml of 0.200 M H2SO4 was used to titrate a 10.0 ml sample of NaOH solution. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the question is asking for the concentration of NaOH, not the original one. Or is it? Wait, no, the question is about the concentration of NaOH before titration. Wait, no, no. Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question is, "what concentration of NaOH did he find?" So the question is about the NaOH concentration before titration, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that after titrating, he found that. So maybe the question is about the concentration of NaOH before the titration. Or perhaps, the question is about the concentration after the titration. Wait, no, let's read the question again.

The question reads: "What concentration of NaOH did he find?" So I think the question is about the concentration of the NaOH solution before titration. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, because the titration is done after the solution is presumably not neutral. Oh wait, no, because the question says that he titrates the NaOH solution at the end of each day to determine whether the solution is still capable of peeling. Wait, that's confusing. So he's adding H2SO4 to the NaOH solution, and the amount of H2SO4 used will indicate how much NaOH was present.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of the NaOH solution before titration, perhaps? No, wait, no, the question is phrased as "what concentration of NaOH did he find?" So the answer would be the concentration of the NaOH solution before it was titrated. Because when you titrate, you're adding H2SO4 to neutralize the NaOH. But the question is about the NaOH's concentration.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think. The problem says that at the end of the day, he finds that 64.0 ml of 0.200 M H2SO4 titrates a 10.0 ml sample of NaOH solution. Oh wait, so after titration, the solution was made neutral. So the H2SO4 is the titrant. So the amount of H2SO4 used is 0.200 M * 0.064 L (since 64.0 ml is 0.064 L) = 0.0128 moles of H2SO4. But since the reaction is 1:1, that's equal to moles of NaOH in the sample.

But wait, the sample is 10.0 ml of NaOH solution. So the NaOH concentration is (moles)/(volume). So moles NaOH = 0.0128 mol. Volume is 0.010 L. So concentration = 0.0128 / 0.010 = 1.28 M. So that's option I, which is 1.92 M? Wait, no, option I is 1.92. Wait, no, wait, 1.28 is option D. Let me look at the options again.

Oh, the options are:

A: 2.56 M

B: 0.32 M

C: 0.16 M

D: 1.28 M

E:5.12 M

F:2.00 M

G:4.00 M

H:3.12 M

I:1.92 M

J:0.64 M

Wait, so I thought I got 1.28 M, which is option D. But wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it's a 1:1 neutralization with a strong base like NaOH. So the moles of H2SO4 equals the moles of NaOH.

Molarity of H2SO4 = 0.200 M, volume = 64.0 ml = 0.064 L.

Moles H2SO4 = 0.200 * 0.064 = 0.0128 mol.

Since it's a 1:1 ratio, moles of NaOH = 0.0128 mol.

Volume of NaOH sample is 10.0 ml = 0.010 L.

Concentration of NaOH = 0.0128 / 0.010 = 1.28 M. So that's D. But looking at the options, D is 1.28, which matches.

But wait, looking at the options, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate. Another way: 0.200 M * 0.064 L is 0.0128 moles of H2SO4. Since each mole of H2SO4 neutralizes one mole of NaOH, the NaOH has 0.0128 moles in 10.0 mL. 10.0 mL is 0.01 L. 0.0128 / 0.01 = 1.28 M.

Yes, so the answer should be D:1.28 M.

To determine the concentration of NaOH, we analyze the titration reaction between NaOH and H₂SO₄. NaOH is a strong base, and H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, so they react in a 1:1 molar ratio:

\[
\text{NaOH} + \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow \text{NaHSO}_4 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

The problem states that 64.0 mL of 0.200 M H₂SO₄ is used to titrate a 10.0 mL sample of NaOH solution. The moles of H₂SO₄ used are calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume (in liters)} = 0.200 \, \text{M} \times 0.064 \, \text{L} = 0.0128 \, \text{mol}
\]

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaOH in the 10.0 mL sample are also 0.0128 mol. To find the concentration of NaOH, we divide the moles by the volume of the sample (converted to liters):

\[
\text{Concentration of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Volume of NaOH sample (in liters)}} = \frac{0.0128 \, \text{mol}}{0.010 \, \text{L}} = 1.28 \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of NaOH is 1.28 M. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: 1.28 M**
