Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about population growth and demography. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the tendency for a population to keep growing long after replacement fertility has been achieved. The options are A to I, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to understand each term. Replacement fertility is when the average number of offspring a couple has equals the carrying capacity of the Earth, right? So if that's achieved, the population might stop growing because each couple has enough children to sustain the population. But the question is about cases where that doesn't happen. So it's after replacement fertility has been achieved but the population keeps growing.

What's the term for that? I remember hearing about different stages of population growth tied to fertility rates. There's the "reproductive phase" and the "post-reproductive phase." So when a population is in the post-reproductive stage, it's growing because the number of children per couple is above the replacement level.

I think one of the terms is "demographic transition." Let me think. The demographic transition is when a population moves from high birth rates to low birth rates as the reproductive age shifts. So, before the transition, there's high fertility (young people have many kids). After the transition, as people get older, they have fewer children. So during the transition period, the population starts growing because the number of births is above the replacement level. 

Looking at the options, I see "demographic transition" is option I. So that's probably the right answer. 

But wait, let me make sure. The other options: 
- A: homeostatic plateau - maybe refers to a stable population, but that's more about equilibrium.
- B: demographic imbalance - sounds like a state where there's too many or too few births, affecting population stability.
- C: population inertia - I'm not sure about this. Maybe it's about resistance to change due to inertia, but I'm not certain.
- D: demographic momentum - that's another term. I think it's about the tendency for a population to grow rapidly once it's in the post-reproductive stage. So it's a term used for when a population is in the transition, not just already there.
- E: rapid growth rate - that's describing a different aspect, like the speed of growth, not a state of the population's growth.
- F: zero population growth - that's when birth rates equal death rates, leading to no net population change.
- G: fertility transition - that's the point where fertility rates drop, which is part of the demographic transition.
- H: fertility momentum - no, that's a different concept, more about the accumulation of reproductive success.
- I: demographic transition - this is the right term as I thought earlier.

So, the correct answer should be I: demographic transition.

The correct answer is I: demographic transition.
