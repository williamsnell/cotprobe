Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer based on the passage provided. Let's start by reading the passage carefully.

The passage is about a Frenchman, Roland Doregelès, who has been around for 50 years, and the passage is from about 1965. The main event is a conversation between this person and Georges Clemenceau, the chief of the French newspaper. The conversation goes into detail about an announcement made by Paris regarding the start of the war on August 2, 1914. The person is shocked because they've heard that Paris is singing, as Clemenceau says.

I need to determine what Clemenceau inferred from this information. The options are A through J, each making a different inference.

Let me break down the passage. The person reached Georges Clemenceau's office, who then asked what Paris is saying. He was shocked, as he's been around for a long time. He was expecting a serious announcement, but instead, Paris is reacting with something lively—singing. So, Clemenceau must have noticed that Paris is not acting in a serious way. 

Option A says he had already started making strategies for the upcoming war. Well, the passage doesn't mention anything about Clemenceau planning the war. He was just informed of an unexpected reaction. So A might not be the right choice.

Option B is disagreement with the public's reaction to the war. The person is shocked but doesn't necessarily comment on the public's reaction. He might have been surprised, not necessarily opposed. So maybe B isn't the best fit.

Option C: unaware of the announcement until informed by the narrator. The passage states that the person reached Clemenceau's office and was shocked. There's no indication that Clemenceau had any knowledge of the announcement before being informed. So C probably isn't right.

Option D: grave doubts about France's ability to win a war against Germany. The passage mentions that Paris is reacting with joy, but it doesn't state whether the people in Paris have doubts or not. It's possible that Clemenceau was worried about Germany's ability to win, but the passage doesn't say so. So D might not be the correct inference.

Option E: was afraid of the upcoming war and its consequences. The passage says the person reached Clemenceau and was shocked. It doesn't explicitly state his fear, but the reaction to the war could make him anxious. So E might be a possibility.

Option F: was relieved. The passage says the person was shocked, not relieved. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: would one day serve as prime minister. The passage doesn't mention Clemenceau's political career, so G isn't supported.

Option H: believed war would bring economic prosperity. The passage doesn't mention the economic impact; it's about the reaction to the war. So H isn't inferred.

Option I: indifferent to reaction of Paris. The passage doesn't say that Clemenceau was indifferent. He was shocked, so I might think this is incorrect.

Option J: was disgusted. The passage says he was shocked and that Paris was reacting with joy. So he's probably not as disgusted as J suggests. So J is probably not correct.

So reviewing the options, the most probable inference is E: was afraid of the upcoming war and its consequences. The passage doesn't explicitly state his fear, but the shock and the reaction (singing) might make him anxious, hence the fear. Alternatively, some might think that the shock makes him wary, so E fits.

The passage describes a shocking event where the person reached Georges Clemenceau and was shocked by Paris's reaction. While the passage doesn't explicitly state that the person was afraid, the shock and the sudden reaction might make him anxious, leading him to infer that he was afraid of the war's upcoming consequences. 

Answer: E
