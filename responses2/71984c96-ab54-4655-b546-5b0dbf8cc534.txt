Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this problem. Let's see what information I have. The question is about calculating the list price and net price of dinette tables that Weiser Inc. is selling with a discount. The discount rate is 12 and a half percent. So, the discount is $21.90.

Wait, the discount is $21.90. So, the amount saved is $21.90, which is 12.5% of the list price. I think I should start by figuring out the list price first.

Let me denote the list price as LP. The discount is 12.5%, so 12.5% of LP equals $21.90. So, 0.125 * LP = 21.90. To find LP, I can divide both sides by 0.125. Let me calculate that.

21.90 divided by 0.125. Let me do the math: 21.90 รท 0.125. Hmm, 0.125 is 1/8, so 21.90 * 8 would be 175.20. Oh, so the list price is $175.20. That's option A's list price. But wait, I should check all the options to see which one has a list price of that. Let me make sure I got the calculations right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as percentage. 12.5% is a common fraction, so 12.5% is 1/8. So, the discount is 1/8 of the list price. So, list price is 8/1 times the discount. 21.90 * 8 is 175.20. Yep, that's correct.

So, the list price is $175.20. That's option A's list price. Now, I need to find the net price. The net price is the list price minus the discount. So, $175.20 minus $21.90 should give me the net price. Let's calculate that.

175.20 minus 21.90: 175.20 - 21.90. Hmm, 175 minus 21 is 154, and 0.20 minus 0.90 would be -0.70. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I should do it more accurately.

Let me subtract:

175.20
-21.90
--------
Let's subtract the cents first: 20 cents minus 90 cents. Can't do that, so borrow 1 dollar. That makes it 120 cents minus 90 cents, which is 30 cents. The dollars part: 175 becomes 174, minus 21 is 153. So, the net price is $153.30. Looking at the options, that's option A's net price.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the discount calculation. Alternatively, the net price can also be calculated by multiplying the list price by (1 minus the discount rate). Let me try that approach to double-check.

So, net price = LP * (1 - discount rate)
= 175.20 * (1 - 0.125)
= 175.20 * 0.875
Let me compute that. 175 * 0.875 is 175 * (7/8) = (175 *7)/8 = 1225/8 = 153.125. Then, 0.20 *0.875 is 0.175. So, adding 153.125 and 0.175 gives 153.30. So, that's correct. So net price is $153.30.

Looking at the options, option A is list price $175.20 and net price $153.30. That seems to match. But wait, I need to check if I read the discount correctly. The question says the discount rate is 12 and a half percent. So, 12.5%, which is 0.125 in decimal. So, the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is applied differently, but the way I approached it seems right. So, the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves calculating the list price and net price of dinette tables with a 12.5% discount of $21.90. 

1. **List Price Calculation**:  
   The discount is 12.5% of the list price.  
   \( 0.125 \times LP = 21.90 \)  
   \( LP = \frac{21.90}{0.125} = 175.20 \)  
   So, the list price is $175.20.  

2. **Net Price Calculation**:  
   Net price = List price - Discount  
   \( = 175.20 - 21.90 = 153.30 \)  
   Alternatively, using the formula:  
   \( Net\ Price = LP \times (1 - 0.125) = 175.20 \times 0.875 = 153.30 \)  

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Option A: List price $175.20, Net price $153.30.
