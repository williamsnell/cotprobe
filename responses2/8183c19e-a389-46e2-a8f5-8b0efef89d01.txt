Question:

Prior to the late 20th century the role of women in war had been neglected as an area of concern in security studies, for what reason?

Options:

A: Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security.
B: The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.
C: The role of women was given appropriate consideration; women have fulfilled many vital roles in the support of the dominant security system.
D: Women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to engage in anti-war or opposition movements, rendering their contribution to the study of warfare as marginal.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the role of women in warfare before the late 20th century, and how it was perceived in security studies. Hmm, let me think about this.

Wait, the question says that prior to the late 20th century, the role of women in war was neglected as a security concern. So why would that be? The options are A to D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says women didn't actively engage as combatants and thus gender or women's roles weren't important. But that doesn't sound right because the question is asking why women's role was neglected. If it's because women didn't actively engage, it would imply that the focus was on men, not women. But I think the neglect was because women didn't take the role seriously, not because they didn't participate. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B suggests that women's roles in violence were framed in terms of their effect on the state, not as individuals or women. So women's actions affected the state, like their roles in controlling the state or influencing it. But that doesn't directly explain why they were neglected. They could have been active, but the impact on state might have been a reason for neglect. So B might be about the impact, but the question is about neglect, so I'm not sure.

Option C says women were given appropriate consideration, fulfilled vital roles in supporting the security system. So if women were given attention and did important things, it wouldn't be neglected. That seems like the opposite of what the question states. The question is why they were neglected, so C would be the opposite. So probably not the answer.

Option D claims women are unsupportive of warfare and prefer anti-war or opposition movements. This seems like a strong point. If women didn't support warfare, their contributions wouldn't be considered in security studies. That makes sense because if women were not involved or didn't see the value in warfare, then it wouldn't be a concern. So D would explain why it was neglected.

Putting it all together, the question is why women's role in warfare was neglected. The correct answer is D because it suggests that women's involvement was either not recognized or wasn't supportive, meaning their contributions weren't counted. Option A says women didn't engage, but that would mean the focus was on men, not neglect. So the neglect would be due to women not supporting it, not because they didn't participate.

The question asks why women's role in warfare was neglected in security studies prior to the late 20th century. Option D, which states that women were unsupportive of warfare and preferred anti-war or opposition movements, directly explains this neglect. This is because if women's involvement was not recognized or not seen as favorable, their contributions wouldn't be counted in security studies. 

**Answer: D**
