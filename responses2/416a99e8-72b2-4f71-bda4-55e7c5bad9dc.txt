Okay, so I need to figure out which country sent landers to Venus. I'm a bit rusty on space history, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that the Apollo missions sent humans to the Moon. The first one was Apollo 13, which landed on the Moon in 1969. Then there were other missions like Apollo 14, 15, 16, and 17. But these were all for Earth.

Now, about Venus. I think the Cassini mission was the first to visit Venus. Cassini was launched in 2004 and landed on the planet in 2006. They sent a lander there. I'm pretty sure there were other missions, but the Cassini mission is the most notable one.

So, looking at the options, I need to see which country sent the Cassini probe. The options are A to J, each a country. The answer should be the one that includes the United States, probably, since the Cassini mission was led by the US.

Looking at the options, the U.S. is listed. The others are Russia, France, Japan, Germany, the U.S.S.R., Brazil, India, China, and the U.S.S.R. again? Wait, the U.S.S.R. is the Russian version of the U.S. So that's a possible option, but the Cassini mission was led by NASA, I believe, not the Russian government. So the correct country would be the U.S.

So the correct answer is the U.S., which is option H. Let me double-check. Cassini is indeed launched by the U.S. government, correct. So yes, option H is the right one.

The correct country is the United States, as they launched the Cassini mission to Venus.
