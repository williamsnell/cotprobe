Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about American realists and formalism in law. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking about what realists argued about formalism, specifically regarding the authority of judges. So, I remember that formalism in law was an early concept that emphasized logical structure over practical application. It's often associated with John Rawls, I think.

The question is about why formalism devalued the judge's authority. So, in the context of realists, they probably argued that judges aren't as important as the law itself, but more about the authority of the law rather than the judges. Let me think about the options.

Option A says Judicial decisions are less important than legislation. Wait, realists might have thought that judges are less important than the actual legislation. So, maybe they argue that judges' decisions are based more on logic than on the law's execution. So, if the law is being followed correctly, the judge's role isn't as crucial. That makes sense because formalism would suggest that the law is the source of authority, so judges are tools used for that.

Option B is about flawed structure. I'm less sure about that. Formalism focused on structure, but maybe the realists didn't necessarily argue that structure was wrong, but rather the logic or the application.

Option C: Judges are not allowed to interpret the law, only apply it. Wait, is that a realist view or a Rawlsian? I think Rawls said that judges should interpret the law, not just apply it. So, realists might argue the opposite, that judges aren't as important because their decisions are based on the law, not their own interpretation. So this might contradict C.

Option D: Formalism doesn't allow for moral considerations. Realists, I believe, would support the idea that judges can handle moral issues as long as they fit the law. So, this option seems incorrect.

Option E: Formalism treats reasoning as syllogistic. No, I don't think that's correct because formalism was more about logical structure, not the form of arguments. It's more about the form than the content.

Option F: Formalism undervalues societal changes. Realists might argue that societal changes can influence law, so formalism might not have been that right. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is about.

Option G: Judges base decisions on formal logic. Wait, that's the opposite of what formalism would say. Formalism would say judges are tools, not the source of authority. So if G were correct, that would be against formalism. So probably realists would argue the opposite.

Option H: It assumes all laws are written with perfect clarity. No, that's a more general view; realists probably focused on the logic and structure more than the form of law.

Option J: Formalism makes the law rigid. Realists would argue that law is flexible, so formalism was too rigid. So J's opposite.

Wait, the question is about what realists argued formalism devalued the judge's authority. So the realists might have thought that because formalism is about structure, the judge's role isn't as important as the actual law being followed. So A says judicial decisions are less important than legislation. Alternatively, C says judges are not allowed to interpret, but that's more of Rawls.

Wait, another angle: Realists believed that judges are not the primary source of authority. In Rawls' theory, the law is the source of authority, so the judge's role is secondary. So realists would argue that the law itself is more important than the judge's decisions. For example, if the law is followed correctly, the judge's role isn't as crucial as the actual law.

Option A says judicial decisions are less important than legislation. So realists might argue that the judge's decisions are based on logical analysis, so they are less important than what's already in the law. So A would be a correct statement.

Alternatively, if the question is which argument realists made about formalism, perhaps it's about the structure being flawed. But I'm a bit confused. Wait, formalism's main idea was to focus on the structure of law, not the practical application.

Wait, the question is about the last character of the response being the chosen letter. So the correct answer is probably A, B, or C.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about what realists argued about formalism. Realists, like Rawls, believed that the law is the source of authority, so the judges' decisions are not as important as the law's application.

So the correct answer would be A: Judicial decisions are less important than legislation.

Wait, but another point: Realists might argue that judges' decisions are based on the law, so the law is more important. So if the question is about what realists devalued the judge's authority, the answer would be that the law itself is more important than the judges' decisions, making A correct.

Alternatively, another thought: Realists might have argued that formalism treats the law as a series of syllogisms, but that's not directly related. So the realists' view is that the law (and thus the judiciary) should be the primary source of authority, making the judge's decisions less important than the actual law's application.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.

The question asks about what American realists argued about formalism regarding the authority of judges. Realists, such as John Rawls, believed that the law itself is the source of authority, and that judges' decisions are not as important as the actual application of the law. 

Option A correctly captures this view: "Judicial decisions are less important than legislation." This aligns with the realists' argument that the law is the primary source of authority, making the judge's decisions subordinate to the law's application.

ANSWER: A
