Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light passing through a crystal. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says a plane polarized light falls normally on a thin piece of quartz. The optic axis is on the surface. So, I remember that when light passes through a crystal with an optic axis, it can split into two components: E (extraordinary) and O (ordinary) with different refractive indices. Oh right, the indices are n_E and n_O. Here, n_E is 1.553 and n_O is 1.544.

The problem is asking for the thickness of the crystal such that the difference in phase between the E and O beams upon emergence is π radians. Wait, phase difference? So, phase difference is related to the optical path difference, right?

I think the formula for phase difference involves the difference in optical path lengths multiplied by some factor. Let me recall. The phase difference Δφ is given by 2π times the optical path difference divided by the wavelength in vacuum. Or wait, no: the optical path length is n * t, so the phase difference would be (2π/λ) * (n_E - n_O) * t. Because the E beam has a higher refractive index than the O.

Wait, let me get this straight. The phase difference Δφ is 2π (n_E - n_O) t / λ. Because each beam's phase depends on the product of the refractive index, thickness, and 2π/λ (since phase difference is (2π/λ) * (n * t)).

The question says the difference in phase is π radians. So, set Δφ = π.

So, π = (2π (n_E - n_O) t) / λ.

Wait, but wait, what's the unit of λ? The wavelength in vacuum, I think. Because the crystal's refractive indices are given, which are fractions of the speed of light in vacuum. Oh, right, because n = c/v_p, where v_p is the phase velocity. So, when light enters the crystal, the wavelength changes, but in terms of the formula, I think we're using the vacuum wavelength.

Wait, but in the formula, the phase calculation uses the wavelength in the medium, but wait, the refractive index comes into play for phase. Let me think again. The phase change upon entering the medium is (2π n t) / λ_0, where λ_0 is the wavelength in vacuum.

Wait, no. The phase change is (2π n t) / λ_0, because when light enters a medium, the wavelength λ_medium is λ_0 / n, so the number of wavelengths is λ_0/(n λ_0) ) = 1/n. So, each wavelength in the medium contributes 2π radians to the phase. So, phase change is (2π / λ_0) * n * t.

Wait, but the problem states that the light is plane polarized, but the crystal's optic axis is on the surface. Oh, maybe the problem is considering a uniaxial crystal. So, the phase difference is (2π)(n_E - n_O) t / λ_0.

Wait, but sometimes the formula is written as (2π n (n_E -n_O) t) / (λ_0), but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to get it right.

Wait, phase is φ = (2π/λ_0) * (n t) for each beam. So, the phase difference is (2π/λ_0) (n_E t - n_O t) ) = (2π t (n_E -n_O)) / λ_0.

So, the problem says the phase difference is π. So:

(2π (n_E - n_O) t ) / λ_0 = π

Divide both sides by π:

(2 (n_E - n_O) t ) / λ_0 = 1

So, t = λ_0 / (2 (n_E - n_O) )

Wait, but wait, what's the wavelength in vacuum? The given λ is 6 × 10^-5 cm. Wait, 6e-5 cm is 6e-7 meters or 6e-5 cm equals 6e-5 cm = 0.06 mm, no wait 6e-5 cm is 0.00006 meters, 0.06 mm. Let me make sure: 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 * 0.01 = 6e-7 m. So, λ_0 is 6e-7 m.

Wait, but what's the value of n_E - n_O? Here, n_E is 1.553 and n_O is 1.544. So, 1.553 minus 1.544 is 0.009. So, 0.009.

So, putting numbers in:

t = (6e-7 m) / ( 2 * 0.009 )

Compute denominator: 2 * 0.009 = 0.018.

So t = 6e-7 / 0.018 = (6/0.018) * 1e-7.

Wait, 6 / 0.018 = 6/(18/1000) ) = (6 * 1000)/18 = 6000/18 = 333.333...

So t = 333.333e-7 meters. Because 6e-7 / 0.018 = (6 / 0.018) * 1e-7. Wait, maybe I should compute 6e-7 divided by 0.018.

Let me compute 6 / 0.018 = 6 / (18e-3) )= 6/(1.8e-2) = 6 * (100/1.8) )= 6 * (55.5555...) = 333.333... So, 333.333e-7 meters.

Wait, 333.333e-7 m is 3.33333e-5 meters. Let me convert meters to mm: 1 m = 1000 mm, so 3.33333e-5 m = 0.0333333 mm.

Wait, but wait. The options given:

Looking back, the options are in mm, and the possible answers are A:0.031mm, B:0.03, C:0.032mm, D:0.035, E:0.028, etc.

So, 0.033333 mm is approximately 0.0333 mm. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 0.032 mm, and option B is 0.03 mm. Hmm, option B is 0.03, which is 0.03333... mm approximately 0.0333. So, 0.0333 is about 0.0333 mm, which is the same as 0.0333 ≈ 0.033 mm. So, but the options don't have 0.033; the closest is 0.032 (option C) and 0.033 (option H which is not listed). Wait, the options are A through J, and the given options are:

A: 0.031mm,

B: 0.03,

C: 0.032,

D: 0.035,

E: 0.028,

F: 0.029,

G: 0.034,

H: 0.033,

I: 0.036,

J: 0.037.

Wait, so 0.0333 is approximately 0.0333, which is 0.0333 mm.

Looking for options, the closest to 0.0333 is option H: 0.033mm. But wait, the problem says the phase difference is pi radians, which led us to t = λ_0/(2*(n_E -n_O)).

Wait, did I forget any factors? Let me double-check the formula.

Another approach: the phase change difference is given by 2π (n_E t - n_O t)/λ_0 = π.

So,

2π t (n_E -n_O) / λ_0 = π.

Divide both sides by π: 2 t (n_E -n_O) / λ_0 = 1.

t = λ_0 / (2 (n_E -n_O)).

Which is the same as before.

So, plugging in numbers: t= (6e-5 cm) / (2 * 0.009) cm.

Wait, wait! Wait a second, wait a second. Oh wait, wait, the wavelength is given as 6e-5 cm. So, is that in cm or meters? Because the problem says λ = 6e-5 cm.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the unit consideration. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, λ is given as 6 × 10^-5 cm, which is 6e-5 cm. So, 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 * 0.01 m = 6e-7 m, which is 6e-5 cm = 0.00006 m, which is 0.06 mm.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to keep the units in cm.

Wait, the given λ is 6e-5 cm. So, no need to convert to meters. Let me recompute.

Wait, the formula for the phase change difference is (2π/λ_0) * (n_E -n_O) * t = π. So,

(2π (n_E -n_O) t ) / λ_0 = π.

Divide both sides by π:

2 (n_E -n_O) t / λ_0 = 1.

So,

t = λ_0 / [2 (n_E -n_O) ].

n_E -n_O = 0.009.

So,

t = (6e-5 cm) / (2 * 0.009).

Compute denominator: 2 * 0.009 = 0.018.

t = 6e-5 / 0.018 cm.

Wait, 6e-5 divided by 0.018 is same as 6e-5 / 1.8e-2.

Which is (6 / 1.8 ) * 1e-3.

6/1.8 is 3.333..., so 3.333e-3 cm.

Wait, but that's 3.333e-3 cm, which is 0.03333 cm. Oh wait, because 1 cm is 10 mm, but wait, no, 1 cm is 0.01 meters, but more importantly, 1 cm is 0.001 m, but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, 1 cm = 0.01 meters = 0.1 mm. No, wait, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1 cm is 0.01 m. 1 mm is 0.001 m. So, 1 cm = 10 mm. So, 0.0333 cm is 0.0333 * 10 mm = 0.333 mm. Wait, but that's not matching the earlier calculation. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, 0.0333 cm is 0.0333 * 0.01 m = 0.000333 m. Hmm, perhaps not the most straightforward approach.

Wait, wait, let's compute it correctly.

t = (6e-5 cm) / (2 * 0.009) = (6e-5) / (0.018) cm.

Compute 6e-5 / 0.018 = (6 / 0.018 ) * 1e-5.

6 /0.018 = 333.333...

So, 333.333e-5 cm = 333.333e-5 cm.

But wait, 1 cm is 10 mm, so 333.333e-5 cm is 333.333e-5 * 10 mm/cm.

Wait, 333.333e-5 cm is 3.33333e-4 cm. 3.33333e-4 cm * 10 mm/cm = 3.33333e-3 mm.

That's 0.00333333 mm. That can't be right, because that's 0.00333 mm, which is even smaller than I thought.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me re-calculate everything in meters.

Wait, λ is 6e-5 cm, which is 6e-5 * 1e-2 m = 6e-7 m.

n_E -n_O = 0.009.

t = λ_0 / [ 2 (n_E - n_O) ]

t = (6e-7 m) / [ 2 * 0.009 ]

Compute denominator: 2 *0.009 =0.018.

So, t = (6e-7) / 0.018 m.

Compute 6e-7 / 0.018.

6e-7 is 0.0000006.

0.0000006 / 0.018 = 0.000033333... m.

Which is 3.33333e-5 m.

Convert meters to millimeters: 1 m = 1000 mm, so 3.33333e-5 m = 0.0333333 mm.

So, t is approximately 0.0333333 mm, which is about 0.0333 mm.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.032 mm, which is 0.032, and option H is 0.033 mm. So, our result is approximately 0.0333 mm, which is very close to 0.033 mm, which is option H.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A:0.031mm,

B:0.03,

C:0.032,

D:0.035,

E:0.028,

F:0.029,

G:0.034,

H:0.033,

I:0.036,

J:0.037.

So, 0.0333 is approximately 0.033 mm, which is option H.

But wait, no: 0.0333333... is 0.033333 mm, which is approximately 0.0333 mm. So, it's 0.0333 mm. Which is closer to H (0.033 mm) than to C (0.032 mm). But wait, 0.0333 is roughly 0.0333, so perhaps the answer is option C, because 0.033 mm is 3.3 mm, and 0.032 is 32 mm, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, 0.0333 mm is 0.0333 millimeters. Wait, no, scaling back units.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the initial calculation.

Wait, the problem says the crystal is cut so that the optic axis lies on the surface. Oh, wait, that's a key detail. I think that affects the refractive indices of the ordinary and extraordinary rays. Because, normally, if the optic axis is on the surface, the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices are different. Or perhaps that's a different scenario. Wait, is that relevant here?

Wait, the formula I used earlier assumes that n_E and n_O are the refractive indices of the extraordinary and ordinary rays, which are different. But if the optic axis is on the surface, there might be a different relation between the indices.

Wait, normally, the extraordinary refractive index n_O is given by n_O = sqrt( (n1^2 + n2^2) / 2 ), but when the optic axis is on the surface, perhaps the refractive indices are n1 and n2, and the ordinary index is n1. Wait, no, not sure. Let me think. Oh wait, in uniaxial crystals, the ordinary ray's refractive index (n_O) is different from the extraordinary's (n_E). But if the optic axis is on the surface, perhaps the ordinary ray is along the optic axis, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the ordinary and extraordinary indices are the same as if the optic axis was elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is correct regardless of the optic axis position. Wait, no, because if the optic axis is at the surface, the refractive index for the ordinary ray is the same as for the extraordinary. Or, perhaps, in that case, the ordinary and extraordinary indices are different. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think through.

In uniaxial crystals, the extraordinary index (n_E) is given by:

n_E = sqrt( (n1^2 + n2^2)/2 )

But when the optic axis is along the surface, the ordinary ray is along the optic axis (i.e., the extraordinary ray's refractive index depends on the surface). Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps when the optic axis is on the surface, the ordinary index is the same as the extraordinary index? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the same regardless of the optic axis's position, but when the optic axis is on the surface, perhaps the ordinary and extraordinary indices are different. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the setup again.

In the problem, the crystal is cut such that the optic axis lies on the surface. So, the optic axis is in the plane of the crystal. So, for an uniaxial crystal, the ordinary and extraordinary indices are different. But in this case, the surface is along the optic axis, so the extraordinary index would be the same as the ordinary index. Wait no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps in this scenario, the ordinary and extraordinary indices are the same as the indices of the crystal. No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the refractive indices are as given, n_E and n_O, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is correct regardless of the optic axis's position, but when the optic axis is on the surface, perhaps the refractive indices of the extraordinary and ordinary rays are the same as given, but that's not correct because they are different.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think again: The question gives that the crystal is cut with the optic axis on the surface. I think when the optic axis is on the surface, the extraordinary and ordinary indices are the same as given, or perhaps different. No, wait, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case where the optic axis is on the surface, the ordinary and extraordinary indices are the same as the given n_E and n_O. But that can't be right because they are different.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is correct, regardless of the optic axis's position. If that's the case, then the calculation I did earlier is correct, and the thickness is about 0.03333 mm, which is approximately 0.0333 mm, which is option H (0.033 mm) or option C (0.032 mm). Wait, 0.0333 is closer to 0.033, which is H, but perhaps the options are not precise.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me try again.

Wait, the given λ is 6e-5 cm. So, 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 cm = 6e-5 * 1e-2 m = 6e-7 m.

n_E = 1.553,

n_O =1.544.

So, n_E -n_O =0.009.

So, t = (6e-7 m) / [ 2 * 0.009 ].

Compute denominator: 2 *0.009=0.018.

t=6e-7 /0.018 m.

So, 6e-7 /0.018 = (6/0.018) * 1e-7.

6/0.018 = 333.333.

So, 333.333e-7 m = 3.33333e-5 m.

Wait, 3.33333e-5 m is 3.33333e-5 * 1000 mm = 0.0333333 mm.

So, t=0.0333333 mm.

Which is approximately 0.0333 mm. So, the options don't have 0.0333, but the closest is option H (0.033) and option C (0.032).

Wait, but 0.0333 is approximately 0.033, which is H. But my earlier calculation using the formulas gives t=0.03333 mm, which is approximately 0.033 mm.

So why are the options at 0.032 and 0.033? Hmm. Let me check any miscalculations I might have made.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-derive the phase difference.

The phase difference between E and O is given by:

Δφ = (2π/λ) * (n_E t - n_O t) - π.

Set Δφ = π:

(2π/λ) * (n_E t - n_O t) - π = π.

Adding π to both sides:

(2π/λ) * (n_E t - n_O t) = 2π.

Divide both sides by 2π:

(1/λ) (n_E t -n_O t) ) = 1.

So,

(n_E t - n_O t) / λ = 1.

t (n_E - n_O) ) = λ.

t = λ/(n_E - n_O).

Wait, wait, so in our case, λ is 6e-5 cm, and (n_E -n_O) is 0.009 cm.

So,

t = (6e-5 cm) / (0.009 cm).

Compute 6e-5 divided by 0.009.

0.009 is 9e-3.

6e-5 /9e-3 = (6/9) * (1e-5 /1e-3) ) = (2/3) * (1e-2) )= 2e-2 /3 = 0.00066666...

Wait, that's 0.00066666... cm.

Wait, that's 0.00066666 cm = 0.0066666 mm.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in the formula. Because in the derivation:

Δφ = 2π (n_E t - n_O t) / λ - π.

Set to π:

2π (n_E t -n_O t)/λ - π = π.

Add π to both sides:

2π(n_E t -n_O t)/λ = 2π.

Divide both sides by 2π:

(n_E t -n_O t)/λ =1.

Multiply both sides by λ:

n_E t -n_O t = λ.

t (n_E - n_O) = λ.

t = λ/(n_E -n_O).

Which is what I did earlier. So, substituting:

λ =6e-5 cm.

n_E - n_O =0.009 cm.

t= 6e-5 /0.009.

Compute 6e-5 /0.009.

0.009 is 9e-3.

6e-5 /9e-3 = (6/9) * (1e-5 /1e-3) )= (2/3) * (1e-2) )= 0.00066666... cm.

Wait, 0.00066666 cm is 0.0066666 mm.

Wait, that's way less than what I thought earlier. So, that would make t=0.0066666 mm, which is 0.0066666 mm.

Wait, but that can't be right, because 0.0066666 mm is 0.0066666 mm, which is 0.0066666 mm = 0.0066666 mm, which is 0.0066666 mm.

Wait, but that would be 0.0066666 mm, which is 0.0066666 millimeters, which is approximately 0.0067 mm.

Wait, but none of the options are near 0.0067 mm.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is t = (λ) / (n_E - n_O) ), but that can't be right because when the optical path difference is zero, the phase difference is zero, which would imply t=0.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the formulas. Let me think again.

Wait, the phase difference between E and O is given by:

Δφ = (2π/λ) (n_E t - n_O t) - π.

If Δφ = π, then:

(2π/λ) (n_E t - n_O t) - π = π.

Adding π to both sides:

(2π/λ)(n_E t -n_O t) = 2π.

Divide both sides by 2π:

(n_E t -n_O t)/λ = 1.

Multiply both sides by λ:

n_E t -n_O t = λ.

t (n_E -n_O) = λ.

t = λ / (n_E -n_O).

So, yes, that's correct.

So, plugging in:

λ=6e-5 cm,

n_E -n_O=0.009 cm.

So,

t=6e-5 /0.009 cm.

Compute 6e-5 /0.009.

0.009 =9e-3.

6e-5 /9e-3 = (6/9) * (1e-5/1e-3) )= (2/3) * (1e-2) )= 2e-2 /3 = 0.00066666... cm.

Wait, 0.00066666 cm is 0.0066666 mm.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are way smaller, and we're getting t=0.0066666 mm.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 * 10 mm/cm = 6e-4 mm.

Wait, because 1 cm = 10 mm, so 1 cm is 10 mm.

So, 1 cm =10 mm.

So, 1 mm = 0.1 cm.

So, 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 cm.

Convert to mm: 6e-5 cm =6e-5 *10 mm =6e-4 mm=0.0006 mm=0.0006 mm.

Wait, t=0.0006 mm.

But that's 0.0006 mm.

Wait, that's about 0.0006 mm, which is 0.0006 mm.

Wait, that's way too small. So, I think I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I confused cm and mm in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate:

t = (6e-5 cm) / (0.009 cm) = (6e-5) / (0.009) cm.

6e-5 is 0.00006.

0.00006 / 0.009 = 0.0066666...

So, 0.0066666 cm.

Wait, 0.0066666 cm is 0.066666 mm.

Ah, I see. I made a mistake when converting cm to mm earlier.

Because, 1 cm is 10 mm, so 0.0066666 cm is 0.0066666 *10 mm =0.066666 mm.

So, t=0.066666 mm.

Wait, that's 0.066666 mm.

But wait, the options don't have this value. They have 0.033 (option H) and 0.032 (option C). So, I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula is t = (λ) / (n_E -n_O) ).

But, wait, when the optic axis is on the surface, there's a different relation between the refractive indices. Let me check what the correct formula is.

Wait, after some research, I found that when the optic axis is on the surface, the ordinary and extraordinary indices are given by:

n_O = sqrt( (n1^2 + n2^2)/2 )

n_E = n2 ? Or something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

n_E^2 = (n1^2 + n2^2)/2

n_O = n2.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps when the optic axis is on the surface, the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices are the same as given by n1 and n2, which are different from the uniaxial case.

Wait, perhaps I should model this correctly.

Let me think about a uniaxial crystal where the optic axis lies on the surface. In this case, the extraordinary refractive index is given by:

n_E = sqrt( (n1^2 + n2^2)/2 )

where n1 is the refractive index along the optic axis, and n2 is the refractive index perpendicular to the optic axis.

Wait, but in this problem, the optic axis lies on the surface, so n1 is zero? No, wait. Wait, no, in a uniaxial crystal, the optic axis lies along the direction of maximum birefringence. When the optic axis lies on the surface, it's a bit different. Wait, perhaps in this case, the extraordinary refractive index n_E is the same as n2, and the ordinary refractive index n_O is the same as n1, which is zero?

No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in this scenario, the ordinary and extraordinary indices are the same as given, n1 and n2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the optic axis lies on the surface, the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices are the same as given, n1 and n2, which are different from the uniaxial case.

Wait, but in that case, the formula for the phase difference would still be as before, so t = λ/(n_E -n_O).

Wait, but perhaps in this scenario, the refractive indices are the same as given, so n1 and n2.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the scenario with the usual uniaxial crystal, but perhaps in this scenario, the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices are the same as given.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So, in that case, the formula t=λ/(n_E -n_O) remains valid.

So, in that case, the calculation is correct, and the thickness is 0.066666 mm.

Wait, but the options don't have this value, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is t = (λ)/(2(n_E -n_O)).

Because, sometimes, when using the formula for the phase difference, the extra factor comes from the wavevector.

Wait, but in this case, the problem doesn't involve any phase shift beyond the phase difference, so perhaps the formula is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

Let me think about the phase difference in a crystal. For a uniaxial crystal, the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices are different. The phase difference for ordinary and extraordinary rays is given by:

Δφ = (2π/λ) (n_O t - n_E t) - π.

Set Δφ = π.

So,

(2π/λ)(n_O t -n_E t) - π = π.

Adding π to both sides:

(2π/λ)(n_O t -n_E t) =2π.

Divide both sides by 2π:

(n_O t -n_E t)/λ =1.

Factor t:

t (n_O -n_E) = λ.

So,

t = λ/(n_O -n_E).

Wait, but earlier I had t=λ/(n_E -n_O). So, that's the same as t=λ/(n_O -n_E), just with a negative sign.

Wait, so if n_O >n_E, then t is positive.

In our case, n_O=1.553, n_E=1.544. So, n_O >n_E.

So, t=λ/(n_O -n_E).

Which is the same as earlier.

So, t=6e-5 / (0.009) cm.

Wait, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, no, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, no, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m. Wait, no, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of cm.

Wait, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, no, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, no, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, no, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, that's 0.00009 m, which is 0.009 m.

Wait, no, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, no, 0.009 cm is 0.00009 m.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to compute t=(6e-5 cm) / (0.009 cm)= (6e-5)/(0.009) cm.

= (6e-5) / (9e-3) cm.

= (6/9) * (1e-5/1e-3) cm.

= (2/3) * (1e-2) cm.

= (2/3) * 1e-2 cm.

= (2/3) * 1e-2 cm.

Wait, 1e-2 cm is 0.01 cm.

Wait, wait, no, 1 cm is 10 mm, so 1 cm is 10 mm.

So, 1e-2 cm is 0.1 mm.

Wait, so 0.01 cm is 0.1 mm.

So, (2/3)*0.1 mm = (2/3)*0.1= 0.066666... mm.

So, t=0.066666... mm.

Which is approximately 0.067 mm.

But the options don't have this value. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be t = lambda/(2*(n_O -n_E)).

Because in some cases, the phase difference is written as (2π/lambda)(n_O t -n_E t) = 2π.

Which would imply (n_O -n_E) t = lambda.

So, t= lambda/(n_O -n_E).

Wait, but in our case, the problem is that the crystal is cut with the optic axis on the surface, and perhaps the formula is t= (lambda) / (n_O -n_E) * 1/2.

Wait, perhaps the formula is t= (lambda) / (n_O -n_E) * 1/2.

Which would make t= (6e-5 cm) / (0.009 cm) * 1/2.

Wait, so 6e-5 /0.009 = (6/9) * (1e-5/1e-3) )= (2/3) * (1e-2) )= 2/3 *0.01= 0.006666... cm.

Then, multiply by 1/2: 0.006666... cm * 0.5 = 0.003333... cm.

Convert cm to mm: 0.003333 cm = 0.03333 mm.

Ah, so that's 0.03333 mm, which is approximately 0.0333 mm.

Which is option H (0.033).

So, the correct answer is option H.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the calculation was 0.06666 mm, but that must be wrong because of the factor of 1/2.

So, the correct calculation is t= (lambda)/(n_O -n_E) * 1/2.

Which gives t= (6e-5 cm)/(0.009 cm) * 0.5 = (0.5) (0.006666 cm) = 0.003333 cm = 0.03333 mm.

Which aligns with option H.

So, the answer is option H: 0.033 mm.

To determine the thickness of the crystal for the given phase difference, we use the formula:

\[
t = \frac{\lambda}{n_O - n_E} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 1: Identify Given Values
- Wavelength in cm: \(\lambda = 6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}\)
- Ordinary refractive index: \(n_O = 1.553\)
- Extraordinary refractive index: \(n_E = 1.544\)

### Step 2: Calculate the Difference in Refractive Indices
\[
n_O - n_E = 1.553 - 1.544 = 0.009 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the Formula
\[
t = \frac{6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}}{0.009 \, \text{cm}} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the Calculation
\[
t = \frac{6 \times 10^{-5}}{0.009} \cdot 0.5
\]

First, calculate the division:
\[
\frac{6 \times 10^{-5}}{0.009} = \frac{6}{9} \times \frac{10^{-5}}{10^{-3}} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10^{-2} = 0.006666 \, \text{cm}
\]

Now, multiply by \(0.5\):
\[
t = 0.006666 \times 0.5 = 0.003333 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 5: Convert to Millimeters
\[
t = 0.003333 \, \text{cm} \times 10 = 0.03333 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Step 6: Match with Options
The calculated thickness is approximately \(0.03333 \, \text{mm}\), which matches **Option H (0.033 mm)**.
