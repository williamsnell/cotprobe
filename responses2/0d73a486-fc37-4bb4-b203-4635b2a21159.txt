Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a 1000-gram mass sliding down an inclined plane. The plane is 81 centimeters long, and it takes 0.60 seconds to do this from rest. I need to find the force acting on it. The options are all in dynes, which I remember is a unit of force equal to 10^-5 newtons. 

Hmm, right. So, force is mass times acceleration, F = ma. But wait, this is a situation on an inclined plane. So I need to find the acceleration first.

Wait, the mass is 1000 grams. Oh, right, since 1 kilogram is 1000 grams, so 1000 grams is 1 kilogram. That’s easier.

The distance is 81 cm. Oh, I should convert that to meters for SI units. So 81 cm is 0.81 meters.

Time is 0.60 seconds. Since it's starting from rest, and assuming constant acceleration. So I can use the kinematic equation for motion under constant acceleration. The equation that relates distance, time, and acceleration is s = (1/2) a t². Yeah, that's because the initial velocity is zero.

Rearranging that equation to solve for acceleration 'a', I get a = (2s)/(t²). Plugging in the values: s is 0.81 m, t is 0.6 s.

Let me calculate that: 2 * 0.81 is 1.62. t squared is 0.6 squared, which is 0.36. So a = 1.62 / 0.36. Let me compute that. 1.62 divided by 0.36. Hmm, 0.36 goes into 1.62 how many times? 0.36 * 4 is 1.44, and 0.36*4.5 is 1.62. So a is 4.5 m/s².

Wait, that makes sense. So the acceleration is 4.5 m/s². Now, using F = ma, mass is 1 kg, so F = 1 * 4.5 = 4.5 Newtons. But wait, the options are in dynes. Oh right, 1 Newton is 10^5 dynes, so 4.5 N is 4.5 * 1e5 = 450,000 dynes. Looking at the options, option G is 450,000 dynes.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought about the inclined plane. Oh yeah, because when an object is on an incline, the acceleration is dependent on the component of gravity along the incline. But in this case, the mass is starting from rest, so the acceleration is due to gravity down the plane. But wait, the problem gives me the time and distance, so perhaps I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, the formula I used was correct for constant acceleration. So perhaps I'm right. Let me double-check the calculations:

s = 0.81 m, t=0.6 s.

a = 2s/(t²) = (2 * 0.81) / (0.6^2) = 1.62 / 0.36 = 4.5 m/s². So that's correct.

So F = m * a = 1 kg * 4.5 m/s² = 4.5 N.

Now, converting to dynes: 1 N = 10^5 dynes, so 4.5 N is 4.5e5 = 450,000 dynes. So the force is 450,000 dynes, which would correspond to option G.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: when dealing with inclined planes, the acceleration is a = g sin(theta), where theta is the angle of inclination. But in this problem, I don't have theta. So maybe this approach isn't necessary because the data directly gives the acceleration.

Alternatively, let me compute the acceleration again. Another way is to compute velocity first. Since it starts from rest, the average velocity is (0 + v)/2 = (v)/2. The distance s = average velocity * time. So average velocity is (v)/2. So s = (v/2) * t. So v = (2s)/t. Wait, that's the same as the earlier equation, so v = (2*0.81)/(0.6) = 2.7 m/s. Then acceleration is delta v / delta t = 2.7 m/s / 0.6 s = 4.5 m/s². Same result.

So yeah, acceleration is 4.5 m/s². Force is 4.5 N, which is 450,000 dynes. So the correct answer is G.

To determine the force acting on the 1000-gram mass, we start by calculating its acceleration using the kinematic equation for motion under constant acceleration:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

Rearranging to solve for acceleration \(a\):

\[
a = \frac{2s}{t^2}
\]

Given:
- \(s = 0.81 \, \text{m}\) (converted from 81 cm)
- \(t = 0.60 \, \text{s}\)

Substituting the values:

\[
a = \frac{2 \times 0.81}{(0.60)^2} = \frac{1.62}{0.36} = 4.5 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Next, using Newton's second law \(F = ma\), where \(m = 1 \, \text{kg}\) (since 1000 grams equals 1 kilogram):

\[
F = 1 \times 4.5 = 4.5 \, \text{N}
\]

To convert Newtons to dynes (1 N = \(10^5 \, \text{dynes}\)):

\[
4.5 \, \text{N} = 4.5 \times 10^5 = 450,000 \, \text{dynes}
\]

Thus, the force acting on the mass is **450,000 dynes**, corresponding to option **G**.
