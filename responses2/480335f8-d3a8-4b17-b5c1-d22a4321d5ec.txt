Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields. Hmm, let's see. Two charges are on an x-axis. I need to find the point where the net electric field is zero, other than infinity. 

The particles are fixed. Particle 1 has a charge of q1 = 2.1e-8 C at x=20 cm. Particle 2 is -4.00 q1, so that's q2 = -4 * 2.1e-8 C, which is -8.4e-8 C. Oh wait, wait, no, wait, 4 times 2.1e-8 is 8.4e-8, right? And since q2 is negative, it's - (4 * q1). 

So the positions are x=20 cm and x=70 cm. Wait, wait, but wait, the way the question is written, it's x=20 cm and x=70 cm. Oh, but wait, that's 50 cm apart. Wait, 20 to 70 is 50 cm. So the distance between them is 50 cm. 

I need to find a point along the x-axis where the electric field from both charges cancels out. So either to the left of both, between them, or to the right of both. Let's think about where that could happen.

The electric field is a vector, so direction matters. Let's consider the positions. Let me convert everything to meters to make the calculations easier. Because 20 cm is 0.2 m, 70 cm is 0.7 m. So the two charges are at 0.2 m and 0.7 m on the x-axis.

The electric field due to a point charge is given by E = k * q / r², and the direction depends on the sign of q. For positive charges, the field points away, for negative, towards them.

So for the point where the net E is zero, the fields from both charges must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Possible positions where this can happen: either between the two charges or outside. Let's see.

Between them: between 0.2m and 0.7m. Let's call the point x (between 0.2 and 0.7). So the distance from q1 is x - 0.2, and from q2 is 0.7 - x. 

The electric fields E1 and E2 must satisfy E1 = E2. But wait, because the fields would point in opposite directions in that region. So E1 (from q1, positive) points to the right (since q1 is positive, E is away from it), and E2 (from q2, negative) points to the left (since q2 is negative, E is towards it). So in the region between them, E1 and E2 are in opposite directions. So the net field E = E1 (right) + (-E2) (left) = 0. So E1 = E2 in magnitude.

So the equation is (k q1)/( (x-0.2)^2 ) = (k |q2| )/( (0.7 - x)^2 )

Because q1 is positive, so E1 is k q1/(r1^2) to the right. q2 is negative, so E2 is k q2/(r2^2) which is negative (since q2 is negative), so the equation becomes (k q1)/(x-0.2)^2 = (k * |q2| )/(0.7 - x)^2 )

Wait, since q2 is negative, but we're taking the absolute value for the magnitude, so the equation is:

q1/( (x - 0.2)^2 ) = |q2|/( (0.7 - x)^2 )

Because q2 is negative, but when squared, the signs cancel. So we can ignore the negative sign when squaring the distance.

Now, q2 is -4 q1. So |q2| =4 q1.

So substituting, we have:

q1/( (x-0.2)^2 ) = (4 q1) / ( (0.7 - x)^2 )

We can cancel q1 from both sides (assuming q1 is non-zero, which it is).

So 1/(x-0.2)^2 = 4/(0.7 - x)^2

Taking reciprocals:

(x-0.2)^2 = (0.7 - x)^2 /4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4 (x - 0.2)^2 = (0.7 - x)^2

Expand both sides:

Left side: 4 (x² - 0.4x + 0.04) = 4x² - 1.6x + 0.16

Right side: (0.7 - x)^2 = 0.49 -1.4x + x²

So equation becomes:

4x² -1.6x + 0.16 = 0.49 -1.4x + x²

Bring all terms to left:

4x² -1.6x +0.16 -0.49 +1.4x -x² =0

Simplify:

(4x² -x²) + (-1.6x +1.4x) + (0.16 -0.49) =0

3x² -0.2x - 0.33 =0

Multiply all terms by 100 to eliminate decimals: 300x² -20x -33=0. Wait, perhaps better to just solve the quadratic equation.

The quadratic is 3x² -0.2x - 0.33 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [0.2 ± sqrt( (0.2)^2 + 4*3*0.33 ) ]/(2*3)

Compute discriminant: (0.2)^2 is 0.04. 4*3*0.33 = 12 *0.33=3.96. So sqrt(0.04 +3.96) = sqrt(4) =2.

So x = [0.2 ±2 ] /6.

So two solutions:

(0.2 +2)/6 = 2.2/6 ≈ 0.3667 m, which is 36.67 cm.

(0.2 -2)/6 = (-1.8)/6= -0.3 m, which is -30 cm.

Wait, but the possible options: looking at the options, I see option C is -30 cm, option F is 30 cm, which is 0.3 m. Wait, no, 30 cm is 0.3 m. So x= 0.3667 m is 36.67 cm, which is about 36.67 cm, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, the options are:

A:10 cm

B:80 cm

C: -30 cm

D: -50 cm

E:40 cm

F:30 cm

G:50 cm

H:-20 cm

I:90 cm

J:60 cm

Wait, the x=36.67 cm is not an option. The closest is 30 cm (F) and 40 cm (E). Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, when we set up the equation, we assumed that the point is between the two charges. But perhaps the point is to the right of both, meaning x>0.7 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the point is between them, but let me check.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The electric field from q1 is to the right (positive), and from q2 (negative), to the left. So in the region between 0.2 and 0.7, the fields are in opposite directions, so they can sum to zero. So E1 (right) + E2 (left) =0. So E1 = E2.

So from the equation, we got x=36.67 cm and x=-30 cm.

Wait, x=36.67 cm is 36.67 cm, but the options don't have that. The options are 30 cm (F) and 40 cm (E). Hmm, maybe I should check whether x=-30 cm is possible.

Wait, x=-30 cm is at -0.3 m. Which is to the left of q1. So that would be outside both charges.

But let's think: in that region, both charges are on the x-axis. For x<0.2 m, q1 is positive, so E1 points to the right. q2 is at 0.7 m, so x is left of q2. The distance from q2 is (0.7 -x). So E2 is from q2 (negative) so E2 points towards q2, which is to the right (since q2 is at 0.7 m, and x is to the left of that). So E1 points right, E2 points right. So in that region, the two fields are in the same direction, so their magnitudes can't cancel. So their sum can't be zero (unless they are zero, but charges can't produce zero field if they are point charges). So the point can't be to the left of both.

The other possibility is to the right of q2, i.e., x>0.7 m.

In that region, E1 (from q1) is pointing away from q1, so to the right. E2 (from q2) is pointing towards q2, so to the left. So E1 is right (positive), E2 is left (negative). So to have E1 = E2 in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So the equation becomes (k q1)/(x-0.2)^2 = (k |q2| )/(x-0.7)^2 )

Because (x-0.7) is positive (since x>0.7), so (x-0.7)^2 is positive.

So:

q1/(x-0.2)^2 = (4 q1)/(x-0.7)^2 )

Again, q1 cancels.

1/(x-0.2)^2 = 4/(x-0.7)^2

Taking reciprocal:

(x-0.2)^2 = (x-0.7)^2 /4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4 (x-0.2)^2 = (x-0.7)^2

Expand both sides.

Left side: 4(x² -0.4x +0.04) =4x² -1.6x +0.16

Right side: x² -1.4x +0.49

Equation:

4x² -1.6x +0.16 = x² -1.4x +0.49

Bring all terms to left:

4x² -1.6x +0.16 -x² +1.4x -0.49 =0

Simplify:

(4x² -x²) + (-1.6x +1.4x) + (0.16 -0.49) =0

3x² -0.2x -0.33=0

Same quadratic as before. So same solutions, x= [0.2 ±sqrt(0.04 + 3.96)]/(2*3) → sqrt(4)=2 → x=(0.2 ±2)/6.

So x= (0.2+2)/6=2.2/6≈ 0.3667 m (36.67 cm), or x=(0.2-2)/6= (-1.8)/6= -0.3 m (–30 cm).

Wait, but wait, in this case, x>0.7 m, right? Because the point is to the right of q2. So x=36.67 cm is 0.3667 m, which is less than 0.7 m. So that's not possible in this scenario. So the only possible solution is x=-30 cm.

So, the point is at x= -30 cm, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another moment: when we assumed the point is to the right of q2, then the x is greater than 0.7 m. So the solution x=36.67 cm is less than 0.7 m, so it's not in this region. So the only valid solution is x= -30 cm, which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the possible options, option C is -30 cm, which is in the options. So the correct answer would be option C: -30 cm.

To determine the point on the x-axis where the net electric field is zero, we analyze the contributions from the two charges, \( q_1 = 2.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{C} \) at \( x = 20 \, \mathrm{cm} \) and \( q_2 = -4.00q_1 \) at \( x = 70 \, \mathrm{cm} \). The electric field due to a point charge is given by \( E = k \frac{q}{r^2} \), where \( r \) is the distance from the charge. The direction of the electric field depends on the sign of the charge.

### Key Observations:
1. **Positions of Charges**: The charges are located at \( x = 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( x = 0.7 \, \mathrm{m} \) on the x-axis.
2. **Electric Field Directions**:
   - For \( x < 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \), \( q_1 \) produces a field to the right (away from \( q_1 \)), and \( q_2 \) produces a field to the left (towards \( q_2 \)).
   - Between \( 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( 0.7 \, \mathrm{m} \), \( q_1 \) produces a field to the right (away from \( q_1 \)), and \( q_2 \) produces a field to the left (towards \( q_2 \)).
   - For \( x > 0.7 \, \mathrm{m} \), \( q_1 \) produces a field to the right (away from \( q_1 \)), and \( q_2 \) produces a field to the left (towards \( q_2 \)).

3. **Net Electric Field Zero Condition**: The net electric field is zero when the magnitudes of the fields from \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) are equal and opposite. This can occur either between \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) or outside both charges.

### Analysis Between \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \):
Between \( x = 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( x = 0.7 \, \mathrm{m} \), the fields are in opposite directions. The equation for equilibrium is:
\[
\frac{k q_1}{(x - 0.2)^2} = \frac{k |q_2|}{(0.7 - x)^2}
\]
Since \( q_2 = -4.00 q_1 \), \( |q_2| = 4.00 q_1 \). Substituting:
\[
\frac{q_1}{(x - 0.2)^2} = \frac{4 q_1}{(0.7 - x)^2}
\]
Canceling \( q_1 \) and taking reciprocals:
\[
(x - 0.2)^2 = \frac{(0.7 - x)^2}{4}
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
4(x - 0.2)^2 = (0.7 - x)^2
\]
\[
4x^2 - 1.6x + 0.16 = x^2 - 1.4x + 0.49
\]
\[
3x^2 - 0.2x - 0.33 = 0
\]
Solving the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{0.2 \pm \sqrt{(0.2)^2 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 0.33}}{2 \cdot 3}
\]
\[
x = \frac{0.2 \pm \sqrt{0.04 + 3.96}}{6} = \frac{0.2 \pm 2}{6}
\]
The solutions are:
\[
x = \frac{2.2}{6} \approx 0.367 \, \mathrm{m} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-1.8}{6} = -0.3 \, \mathrm{m}
\]
Since \( x = 0.367 \, \mathrm{m} \) is between \( 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( 0.7 \, \mathrm{m} \), this is a valid solution. However, \( x = -0.3 \, \mathrm{m} \) is outside both charges.

---

### Analysis Outside Both Charges:
Outside both charges, the fields from \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) must be in the same direction for their magnitudes to cancel. This can occur for \( x > 0.7 \, \mathrm{m} \) or \( x < 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \).

#### Case 1: \( x > 0.7 \, \mathrm{m} \)
For \( x > 0.7 \, \mathrm{m} \), the fields are in opposite directions, so this region is not where the net electric field is zero.

#### Case 2: \( x < 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \)
For \( x < 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \), both fields point to the left, so their magnitudes cannot cancel (unless they are zero, which is not the case here).

---

### Conclusion:
The only valid solution is \( x = -0.3 \, \mathrm{m} \), which corresponds to option **C: -30 cm**.
