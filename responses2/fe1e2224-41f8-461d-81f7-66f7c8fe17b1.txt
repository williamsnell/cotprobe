Okay, so I have this economics question about marginal cost, average variable cost, and average total cost. Hmm, let me think. I remember that MC, AVC, and ATC are important concepts in cost curves. 

The question is asking when MC equals AVC and ATC. Wait, that seems a bit strange because I think MC usually intersects these curves at different points. Let me recall, MC intersects the AVC curve at the minimum point of the AVC curve. Oh right, because MC is the derivative of the total cost curve, and it's equal to the change in total cost when you increase the quantity produced by one unit. 

So, at the point where MC equals the minimum of AVC, MC equals the AVC. But wait, what about ATC? Because ATC is the average of all costs, including fixed costs. So, when does MC equal ATC? I think that's when the MC is equal to ATC at the level of production where the marginal cost is equal to the average total cost. I remember that when MC is greater than ATC, the average total cost is increasing. Conversely, when MC is less than ATC, average total cost is decreasing.

Wait, but the question says MC equals both AVC and ATC. That seems impossible because, for the same level of output, the MC can't be both higher than and lower than the respective curves. So maybe I'm getting this wrong. Or perhaps the question is referring to the point where MC is equal to both average variable cost and average total cost, but that's only possible if the marginal cost is equal to the average variable cost, which is the minimum point. But then, ATC is equal to AVC plus (fixed cost per unit). So unless fixed costs are zero, which they aren't in most cases, ATC can't equal MC unless MC is at the minimum of both.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the graphs. The MC curve is U-shaped, right? It starts low, then increases as you produce more. The AVC curve is also U-shaped, but it's typically lower than MC because it's variable costs. The ATC curve is U-shaped but starts higher than MC because it includes fixed costs. Wait, no. Actually, when you have fixed costs, the ATC will always be higher than MC because fixed costs are spread out over all units.

Wait, let's draw it in mind. The MC curve starts at a low point, comes down, then goes up. The AVC curve is U-shaped but starts above MC. The ATC curve is U-shaped, but it's always above MC because it includes fixed costs which are spread out. So, the point where MC equals ATC would be at a certain level of output. But wait, when does MC equal ATC? Let me think. At the point where MC equals the ATC, the average total cost is minimized. Because if MC is above ATC, that means the average is increasing. If MC is below, average is decreasing. So, the minimum point of the ATC curve is where MC equals ATC. But in that case, does ATC equal MC at that point?

Wait, no. Let me think. The MC curve intersects the ATC curve at the minimum point of the ATC curve. Because at that point, the marginal cost is equal to the average total cost. Because if marginal cost is less than average total cost, the average total cost is decreasing. If MC is equal to ATC, then the average is at its lowest. So in that case, MC intersects ATC at the minimum point. But what about AVC? The MC curve intersects the AVC curve at the minimum point of the AVC curve. Because at that point, the marginal cost is equal to the average variable cost. So, in the case of MC intersecting both at their minimum points, that would happen when the marginal cost is equal to both the minimum of AVC and the minimum of ATC.

Wait, but can MC also equal both at their minimum points? Let me think about the relationship between MC and the curves. The MC curve is the derivative of the total cost function. The AVC and ATC are functions based on that. So, the point where MC equals the minimum of both would be where MC equals both the minimum of AVC and the minimum of ATC. But is that possible? Because the minimum of ATC is a higher point than the minimum of AVC, I think.

Wait, no. Because the minimum of ATC is lower than the minimum of MC. Because when you produce more, the fixed costs are spread out, so adding more units lowers the average total cost, which would be the minimum point of ATC. Meanwhile, the MC curve's minimum is at a lower level than the minimum of ATC. Because when MC is at its minimum, it's where the marginal cost is equal to the average variable cost, but the average total cost is higher because of fixed costs. Wait, or is that the other way around?

Wait, actually, when MC is equal to ATC, that's the point where the average total cost is minimized. Because MC is the derivative of total cost, and when it's equal to ATC, you have the minimum average total cost. So, that's the minimum point of ATC. Meanwhile, the MC curve's minimum is reached when it's equal to the average variable cost, which is lower than the average total cost because of the fixed costs. So, the MC curve's minimum is lower than the ATC's minimum.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the MC curve would cross the ATC curve at its minimum point, and the MC curve would cross the AVC curve at its minimum point. So, if the MC is equal to the minimum of both, that would be when both MC and ATC are at their minimum points (so, MC equals ATC) and MC equals the minimum of AVC. So in this case, MC would be equal to both, meaning that the options would refer to when MC is equal to both.

Looking back at the options, which one says that MC intersects both at their minimum points. Looking at the options:

Option H: MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points. So that's when both MC equals the minimum of AVC and the minimum of ATC. Wait, but isn't the MC's minimum point equal to the minimum of the ATC curve, not the AVC. So, perhaps that's not the case. Because the MC's minimum is the point where MC equals the minimum of the AVC curve. So, when MC is at the minimum of AVC, it's also the point where MC equals the minimum of ATC. Because if you're at the minimum of the MC, which is where MC equals the minimum of the AVC, then that is also the point where MC equals the minimum of the ATC.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the MC curve will touch the ATC curve at its minimum point. And the MC curve will touch the AVC curve at its minimum point as well. So, when MC is equal to both, that's when MC is at the minimum of both. So, in the question, when MC is equal to both, that's when MC is at the minimum of both curves. So, which option says that? Looking at the options:

H: MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points. So, that would be when MC equals both the minimum of AVC and the minimum of ATC. Which is the case in this scenario.

Wait but wait, the MC's minimum is where MC equals the minimum of the AVC. So, the point where MC hits the minimum of the ATC is the same as the point where MC hits the minimum of the AVC. So, if MC is equal to both, that's the case when MC is at the minimum of both. So, the correct answer is option H, because it's when MC is at the minimum of both curves, meaning that MC equals both the minimum of AVC and the minimum of ATC.

Looking back at all the options, option H says that. So, the correct answer is H.

The question asks when marginal cost (MC) is equal to both average variable cost (AVC) and average total cost (ATC). To determine this, we analyze the relationships between these costs:

1. **MC and AVC**: MC intersects the AVC curve at the minimum point of the AVC curve because, at this point, the marginal cost equals the average variable cost.
2. **MC and ATC**: MC intersects the ATC curve at the minimum point of the ATC curve because, at this point, the marginal cost equals the average total cost.
3. **MC and both AVC and ATC**: For MC to equal both AVC and ATC, MC must intersect both curves at their respective minimum points. This occurs when MC is at the point where it equals the minimum of both the AVC and ATC curves.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option H** states that MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points. This is correct because MC intersects the minimum of both curves at the point where MC equals both AVC and ATC.
