Okay, so I have this problem where the first term of a sequence is 1, and each next term is the sum of all the previous terms. I need to find the first term that exceeds 5000. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Let me try to write out the sequence to see the pattern. The first term is 1. So:

Term 1: 1

Term 2 is the sum of all previous terms, which is just term 1: 1. So term 2 is 1.

Term 3 is the sum of term 1 and term 2: 1 + 1 = 2.

Term 4 would be the sum of terms 1, 2, 3: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

Term 5 is sum of terms 1-4: 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8.

Wait, this looks familiar. 1, 1, 2, 4, 8... That's like powers of 2. Let me check:

Term 1 is 1 = 2^0
Term 2 is 1 = 2^0
Term 3 is 2 = 2^1
Term 4 is 4 = 2^2
Term 5 is 8 = 2^3
Term 6 would be sum of previous terms: 1 +1+2+4+8 = 16, which is 2^4.

So the pattern is that term n is equal to 2^{n-2} for n ≥ 2. Let me see: term 1 is 1, which is 2^{0} (since 2^(1-1) = 1). Term 2 is 2^{1-2} = 2^{-1} which is 0.5, but that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm off by one.

Wait, term 1 is 1, term 2 is 1 (which is 2^0, 2^(2-2) = 2^0 = 1), term 3 is 2^(3-2) = 2^1=2. Term 4 is 2^(4-2)=4, which is correct. So the nth term is 2^{n-2} for n≥2. So term n is 2^{n-2}.

Wait, but term 1 is 1, which is 2^{1-2} = 2^{-1}=0.5, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps the formula works for n ≥ 2. Alternatively, maybe the first term is 2^0=1, the second is 2^0, third is 2^1, fourth 2^2, etc. So term n is 2^{n-2} for n ≥2.

Wait, maybe let's check term 1: 2^0 =1, term 2: 2^0=1, term 3: 2^1=2, term4: 2^2=4, term5:2^3=8. Yes, that fits. So term n is 2^{n-2} for n≥2. So term n is 2^{n-2}.

But wait, let me compute term 6: sum of all previous terms up to term5 is 1+1+2+4+8 = 16. Which is 2^4 = 16. According to the formula, for term6: 2^{6-2} = 2^4=16. So yes, that works.

So the terms are:

n | term(n)
1 | 1
2 | 1
3 | 2
4 | 4
5 | 8
6 | 16
7 | 32
8 | 64
9 | 128
10| 256
11|512
12|1024
13|2048
14|4096
15|8192
16|16384

Wait, let me see, the sum up to term n-1 is the next term. So term n is 2^{n-2} for n>=2.

Wait, term n is equal to 2^{n-2}.

But for n=2, 2^{0}=1. Correct.

n=3: 2^1=2. Correct.

n=4: 2^2=4. Correct.

n=5: 2^3=8. Correct.

n=6: 2^4=16.

So, the nth term is 2^{n-2} for n >=2.

Wait, but when n=1, the term is 1, which is 2^0.

So the formula for term n is 2^{n-2} for all n >=1, except when n=1, 2^{n-2} is 2^{-1}=0.5, which doesn't fit. So perhaps the formula holds for n>=2, but for n=1, it's 1. Alternatively, perhaps the entire sequence can be written as 2^{n-2} for n>=1, but that would make term 1 1, term2 1, term3 2, etc.

Wait, perhaps term n is 2^{n-2} for n >=1, but when n=1, 2^{-1}=0.5, which isn't 1. So maybe my initial approach isn't correct. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Let me think of the terms again:

Term 1: 1

Term 2: sum of term1 =1

Term3: sum of term1 and term2 = 2

Term4: sum of term1, term2, term3=4

Term5: sum up to term4 =8

Term6: sum up to term5=16

So the pattern is:

Term(n) = 2^{n-2} for n >=2, and Term1=1.

Wait, let's see for n=2: 2^{0}=1. Correct.

n=3: 2^1=2. Correct.

n=4: 2^2=4. Correct.

So the formula works for n>=2.

But term1 is 1, which is 2^0 as well. So perhaps term(n) = 2^{n-2} for n>=1, since when n=1, 2^{-1}=0.5, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Because term1 is 1, which is 2^0, which is 2^{1-1}.

Wait, maybe the formula is term(n) = 2^{n-2} for n >=1, but term1 would have to be 2^{-1}=0.5, which doesn't fit. So the formula works for n>=2, but term1 is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is term(n) = 2^{n-2} for n>=2, but term1 is 1. So the sequence is 1,1,2,4,8,16,32,64, etc.

Wait, so the terms are 1,1,2,4,8,16,... which is 2^{0} for term1, 2^{0} for term2, 2^{1} for term3, 2^{2} for term4, etc.

So for term n >=2, term n is 2^{n-2}.

Wait, but for term2, 2^{0}=1, which is correct.

So for term1, it's 1, which is 2^{0}.

Wait, perhaps the formula is term(n) = 2^{n-2} for n=1 as well, but that would be 2^{-1}=0.5, which isn't correct. So perhaps the formula is that term(n) = 2^{n-2} for n >=2, and term1 is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire sequence is 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., which is 2^{n-2} for n >=1, but 2^{-1} is 0.5, which isn't correct. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait another approach: perhaps the sum of all previous terms is the next term. So term2 is sum of term1, which is 1. term3 is sum of term1 and term2: 1+1=2. term4 is sum of term1+term2+term3=1+1+2=4. term5: 1+1+2+4=8. So the pattern is each term is double the previous term.

Wait, term2 is 1, term3 is 2 (double of 1), term4 is 4 (double of 2), term5 is 8 (double of 4), and so on. So from term2 onwards, each term is twice the previous term.

So the sequence is 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, etc.

So the terms from term2 onwards are 1,2,4,8,16,32, etc. So term2 is 1 (2^0), term3 is 2 (2^1), term4 is 4 (2^2), term5 is 8 (2^3), etc.

So term n is 2^{n-2} for n≥2.

Wait, for term2 (n=2): 2^{0}=1 → correct.

Term3 (n=3): 2^{1}=2 → correct.

Term4 (n=4): 2^{2}=4 → correct.

So the nth term is 2^{n-2} for n≥2.

But term1 is 1, which is 2^0.

So, let's list the terms:

n | term(n)
1 | 1 → 2^0
2 | 1 → 2^0
3 | 2 → 2^1
4 | 4 → 2^2
5 | 8 → 2^3
6 |16 →2^4
7|32 →2^5
8|64 →2^6
9|128→2^7
10|256→2^8
11|512→2^9
12|1024→2^10
13|2048→2^11
14|4096→2^12
15|8192→2^13
16|16384→2^14

Wait, but term1 is 1, term2 is 1, term3 is 2.

So the terms after term1 are 1, 2,4,8,16, etc.

So what is the first term exceeding 5000?

Looking at the terms, let's see which term is the first to go beyond 5000.

Looking at the list:

n | term(n) | term(n) >5000?
---|-------|---
13 |2048 → 2048 <5000 → no
14 |4096 →4096 <5000 → no
15|8192 →8192>5000 → yes.

So the first term exceeding 5000 is term15, which is 8192.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 8192, which is term15.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 8192

B:10000

C:5001

D:8191

E:5120

F:5000

G:10240

H:4096

I:2048

J:5002

So the question is to find the first term exceeding 5000. So the terms after term14 (4096) are term15=8192, which is the first exceeding 5000.

So the answer should be option A:8192.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because in the initial approach, the terms after term1 are 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192, etc.

So term14 is 4096, term15 is 8192. So 8192 is the first term over 5000.

Wait, but checking the options, option A is 8192, which is correct.

Wait, but option G is 10240, which is way larger. So the first one over is 8192.
</think>

The sequence starts with 1, and each term is the sum of all previous terms. This results in powers of 2 beyond the first two terms. Specifically, term n is 2^(n-2) for n ≥ 2. The terms are:

1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, ...

We need the first term exceeding 5000. The term 4096 is term 14, and the next term, term 15, is 8192, which is the first exceeding 5000. 

Correct answer: A. 8192
