Question:

Late one evening a man was driving home from his job as a security guard at a jewefry store. As the man approached a railroad crossing he noticed that the barriers to the crossing were open. The man cautiously looked both ways for any train. Assuming that no train was coming, he proceeded across the railroad tracks. Suddenly, an oncoming train struck the man's car, completely demolishing it. The man was dead on arrival at the local hospital. Unknown to the man, the railroad crossing guard, in a drunken stupor, had fallen asleep at the barrier controls. He failed to see or hear the signals from the oncoming train that struck and killed the man. The railroad company was well aware of the crossing guard's alcoholism, but continued to employ him. However, two weeks after the accident occurred, the railroad company fired the crossing guard. The executor of the man's estate institutes a wrongful death action against the railroad company. During the trial, the attorney for the man's estate offered into proof the fact that the defendant railroad company dismissed the crossing guard shortly after the accident. Upon objection by the railroad company's attorney, the court should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, as the employee's dismissal was an admission that the railroad company was aware of the crossing guard's chronic alcoholism.
B: sustain the objection, as the dismissal is irrelevant to the case at hand.
C: sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible.
D: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is direct evidence of negligence.
E: overrule the objection, as an adoptive admission by conduct.
F: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is evidence of the railroad company's knowledge of the guard's incompetence.
G: sustain the objection, as the dismissal could unduly influence the jury.
H: sustain the objection, because the probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
I: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is circumstantial evidence of negligence.
J: sustain the objection, as the dismissal could be seen as an admission of guilt.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this wrongful death question. Let me read the scenario again to make sure I understand it.

A man is driving home from a security job and notices the railroad crossing barriers are open. He doesn't see a train and goes across. But then an oncoming train hits his car, killing him on arrival at the hospital. The man died, but the guard, who was drunk, fell asleep and missed the signals. The railroad company knew about the guard's problem but continued to use him. Two weeks later, the company fired the guard. The man's estate is suing the company, and the company's attorney is objecting. The question is about whether the dismissal evidence by the company is admissible.

I remember that a "subsequent remedy" is when a company fixes the problem before the fault comes to light. In this case, the guard fell asleep, so he didn't know about the signals. The company didn't know either. But they fired him anyway. I think the key here is whether the company's action is a constructive admission of negligence.

Wait, what's a constructive admission of negligence? Oh right, it's when the company's failure to act (failing to warn) directly caused the accident. So if the company failed to warn the guard because the guard was asleep, that might count.

But the company's reason for firing was unrelated to the guard's problem. The guard fell asleep, but the company didn't know. So maybe the firing was an admission of negligence. Alternatively, if the company wasn't aware of the guard's problem, firing was just an accident, so it's not constructive.

I think that a subsequent remedy is only admissible if the company's failure to warn caused the accident. But in this case, the company didn't warn, because the guard was asleep. So the firing was a mistake.

Wait, but the problem says the man's attorney is objecting to the dismissal evidence by the company. The question is whether the dismissal is admissible as evidence of negligence.

So if the railroad company failed to warn the guard, that's negligence. So the dismissal was an admission of that negligence. So the company's failure to warn (falling asleep) caused the accident, so the firing was a constructive admission. Therefore, the dismissal evidence is admissible.

So the answer would be D: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is direct evidence of negligence.

Another angle: is the dismissal evidence admissible as evidence of negligence? Yes, because if the company failed to warn, and that led to the accident, then the dismissals are evidence of that negligence.
</think>

The railroad company's dismissal of the guard is admissible as evidence of negligence because it directly indicates the company failed to warn the guard, leading to the accident. 

Answer: D: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is direct evidence of negligence.

**Answer:** D
