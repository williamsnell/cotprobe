Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.
"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity."

Okay, let me try to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The question is about comparing the sentiments expressed in a provided passage to those of various political parties. The passage is from the Populist Party Platform of 1892, written by William Jennings Bryan. So I need to match this to the options given, which are various candidates from different parties in different years.

First, I'll read through the passage to understand its content. The passage talks about the struggles of two major political partiesâ€”probably the Progressive and Populist parties. It mentions that both parties have been in power for more than a century, causing suffering and wrongs. The charge is that the controlling influences are allowing the existing conditions without any effort to stop them. They also propose ignoring almost all issues except one, which is to bring down the morale of the people by focusing on issues like the tariff, which is a tax on imports, and other things like the destruction of the economy to get reforms.

The passage continues by stating that the parties have agreed to ignore all issues except one, which is about losing control through their actions. They want to sacrifice the country to prevent corruption and give the public power. The aim is to restore the government to the people and ensure their safety and security.

Now, looking at the options, each option lists a candidate, their political party, and a year. The question is about which candidate's platform is similar to this passage, but I think the question is asking which candidate's platform matches the sentiments described in the passage.

Wait, the options are the same as the candidates and their years. So each option is a candidate, their political party, and a year. The question is about which candidate's platform is similar to the passage. But the passage is about the Populist Party of 1892. So looking at the options, the Populist Party would be option D, which is William Jennings Bryan, the Populist Party, 1896.

Wait, no. Let me check the options again. Looking at the options:

Option D: William Jennings Bryan, Populist Party, 1896

But the passage is from 1892. So the Populist Party of 1892 is option D? Or perhaps the question is about the sentiments of the passage compared to the candidates, regardless of the year.

Wait, the question says: "The sentiments expressed in the excerpt above about political parties are most similar to those expressed by"

So the options are the candidates and their respective years. The passage is about 1892, so perhaps the correct answer is the candidate who had their platform around that time.

Looking at the options, the only candidate with a year around 1892 is option D, which is 1896. Wait, no, looking again:

Wait, the options are:

A: 1912

B: 1860

C: 1996

D: 1896

E: 1964

F: 2016

G: 1932

H: 1829

I: 1968

J: 1972

So the passage is from 1892, so the candidate would have a year around that. Option D is 1896, which is about 4 years after 1892. So I'm a bit confused because the passage is about 1892, so the candidate's platform should be from 1892.

Wait, no, the question isn't about matching the year. It's about the sentiments expressed. So the sentiment is that of the Populist Party in 1892, which is option D. Because the options are each a candidate with a year, and the question is which candidate's platform is similar to the passage.

Alternatively, maybe the passage is from 1892, so the candidate would have been running in 1892. Looking at the options, do any of them have a year around 1892?

Wait, the options are each a candidate with their respective years. So the Populist Party of 1892 is option D. So that would make option D the candidate whose platform matches the sentiment described in the passage.

Wait, but the passage is about the 1892 Populist Party, so the correct answer is D. Alternatively, perhaps the passage is about the 1892 Populist Party, so the correct option is D.

Alternatively, maybe the passage is from 1892, so the correct answer is the candidate who had their platform in 1892, which would be option D.

Let me make sure. The passage says, "We charge that the controlling influences... permitted the existing conditions... They have agreed to ignore every issue but one. They propose to..., to..., to..., and to..., assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence..."

So the passage is about the 1892 Populist Party. So the correct answer is the candidate (D) who had the platform from 1892.

Wait, but looking at the options, the candidates are listed with their respective years. So the Populist Party was founded in 1892, and the passage is about that year. So the answer should be D, which is the Populist Party candidate from 1892.

The passage discusses the sentiments of the 1892 Populist Party, which corresponds to option D, William Jennings Bryan, Populist Party, 1896. However, the passage is about 1892, so the candidate whose platform is most similar is William Jennings Bryan from 1896. 

Answer: D
