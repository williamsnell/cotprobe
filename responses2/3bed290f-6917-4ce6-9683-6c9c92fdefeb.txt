Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here with three parts: converting metric measurements to imperial ones. I need to convert each part and then match the results to the given options. Let's take it step by step.

Part (a): Convert 678 cm to feet. Hmm, I remember that 1 cm is approximately 0.0328084 feet. So, I can multiply 678 by that conversion factor. Let me calculate that.

678 cm * 0.0328084 ft/cm = ?

Let me do the math. 678 times 0.03 is 20.34, but the exact figure is 678 * 0.0328084. Let me compute it accurately.

678 * 0.0328084: Let's break it down. 600 * 0.0328084 = 19.685064. Then 78 * 0.0328084 = let's see, 70 * 0.0328084 is about 2.296588, and 8*0.0328084 is 0.2624672. Adding those gives 2.5590552. Adding that to 19.685064 gives 22.2441192 feet. Wait, but wait, let me double-check because I might have made a miscalculation. Let me try another approach. I know that 1 inch is 2.54 cm, and 1 foot is 12 inches. So, 678 cm is how many inches first, then divide by 12 to get feet.

678 cm * (1 inch / 2.54 cm) = inches. 678/2.54 is approximately 266.929 inches. Then, divide by 12 to get feet: 266.929 /12 ≈ 22.244 feet. So, approximately 22.24 feet. Since the options have 21, 22, etc., I'll need to see which option has 22 feet. Looking at the options:

Option B: 22 ft
Option C: 19 ft
Option F: 23 ft
Others don't have 22, so probably 22 ft is the correct part here.

Wait, but another way: 1 cm is about 0.0328084 feet. So 678 * 0.0328084 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately. Let me do 678 * 0.0328084.

Calculating:

678 * 0.0328084 = ?

Let me do this step by step.

678 * 0.03 = 20.34
678 * 0.0028084 = let me compute 678 * 0.0028 = 1.8984, plus 678 * 0.0000084 = approximately 0.0057. So total is about 1.8984 + 0.0057 ≈ 1.9041.

Adding to the 20.34: 20.34 + 1.9041 = 22.2441 feet. So, approximately 22.244 feet. So, looking at the options, only option B and D have 22 ft.

Option B: 22 ft
Option D: 22 ft

Now, looking at the other parts to see which is correct.

Part (b): 316 liters to dry pints. I know that 1 liter is approximately 1.8168547 dry pints. So, 316 * 1.8168547 ≈ ?

Calculating:

316 * 1.8 = 568.8
316 * 0.0168547 ≈ let's compute 316 * 0.017 ≈ 5.372. So, approximately 568.8 +5.372 ≈ 574.172 dry pints. Looking at the options, which have around 575.12 or 574. Let's see:

Option B's part (b) is 575.12 pints. That's close to our calculation of 574.17. So option B's part (b) might be correct. Let me check the other options.

Option B's part (b) is 575.12. Option D's part (b) is 668 pints. That seems too high. So, perhaps option B is correct.

Part (c): 50 kg to pounds. I know that 1 kg is approximately 2.20462 pounds. So, 50 * 2.20462 = ?

50 * 2 = 100, 50 * 0.20462 = 10.231. So total is 110.231 pounds. Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: 110 pounds. That's very close. So, that's correct.

Now, let's check all the options to see if they match.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 22 ft, 575.12 pints, 110 pounds.

Wait, but I thought part (a) was 678 cm to feet, which is approximately 22.244 feet. So, looking at the options, the feet part in option B is 22, which is the closest. But wait, 22.244 is closer to 22 than 23. So option B's 22 ft is correct.

But the other parts: part (b) is 575.12, which matches option B's 575.12, and part (c) is 110 pounds, which is exactly option B.

So, option B seems to have all correct values.

The correct answer is option B, which provides the conversions as follows:

(a) 678 cm ≈ 22.24 feet  
(b) 316 liters ≈ 575.12 dry pints  
(c) 50 kg ≈ 110 pounds  

Thus, the final answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
