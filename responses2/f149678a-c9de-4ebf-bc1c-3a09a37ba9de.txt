Okay, so I've got this transformer problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The transformer has a 4,400-volt 60-cycle output. The core loss is 840 watts, and one-third of that is eddy current loss. So, first thing I need to do is find out the core loss at different voltages and frequencies.

Wait, I remember that transformer core losses are mainly due to eddy current loss and hysteresis loss. The problem says one-third is eddy current loss. So, 840 watts total, so eddy is one-third, which is 280 watts, and the rest (560) are hysteresis. But I think for this problem, the key is that the frequency affects hysteresis loss, but the problem says to determine the core loss in each case. Let me think about the dependencies.

Wait, but the problem is about different sources. So when it's connected to different sources, the voltage changes, so I need to find the new core loss. But what about the frequency? The initial problem says 60-cycle, but the sources are either 60 or 50 cycles.

Hmm, I think hysteresis and eddy current losses depend on the frequency and the material properties, but in this problem, perhaps the frequency is changing. Or maybe the transformer is operating at the same frequency as the source, but when the source's frequency changes, the hysteresis loss changes.

Wait, the question says 'determine the core loss in each case'. So perhaps each case is a different scenario, but the core loss formula would relate to the square of the frequency. Because I remember that hysteresis loss is proportional to f times current squared, and eddy current loss is proportional to f times current squared as well. Or is it that the product of frequency and current squared, but perhaps the current changes with frequency.

Wait, another approach: The transformer's voltage is given, and the frequency changes. So the current would change because for a fixed voltage, current is V/(impedance), which depends on the load. But without knowing the load, perhaps I can't find the exact current. Or maybe the problem is only considering the frequency changes, with the same voltage and frequency, but in each case, the frequency changes, and how it affects the core loss.

Wait, the problem says: "the core loss when the transformer is connected (a) to a 4,600-volt 60-cycle source..." So each part (a), (b), (c) is a different scenario. Let me think about each part.

Wait, so part (a) is 4600 V, 60-cycle. The initial transformer was 4400 V, 60-cycle with 840 W core loss, 280 W eddy. So for part (a), the voltage is higher. If the voltage remains the same, the current would change. But since the problem doesn't give any information about the load, maybe we need to assume that the current remains the same, but that doesn't make sense because higher voltage and same frequency would mean higher current. But the problem doesn't give any other information, so perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the transformer's voltage is fixed, but the frequency changes. So for each case, the frequency is given, and the transformer's core loss is calculated based on the new frequencies. But how?

Wait, but the transformer's core loss depends on frequency and current. So if the frequency changes, the hysteresis and eddy current losses change. But without knowing the current, how can I find the new current?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is perhaps in terms of the transformer's equivalent circuit. So for each case, the voltage is different, but the frequency is changed. So maybe the transformer's impedance changes, which affects the current. But the problem doesn't provide resistance values, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the transformer's frequency affects the core loss, but the problem gives the initial conditions. Let's think about each case.

Case (a): 4600 V, 60-cycle.

In the initial case, 4400 V, 60-cycle, with 840 W core loss, 280 W eddy. So the eddy loss is one third of 840. Now, when the voltage is increased to 4600 V, same frequency. So the current would change. But with the same frequency, the hysteresis and eddy losses would change.

Wait, but the problem says to determine the core loss for each case. So perhaps I can compute the new core loss based on the new frequency.

Wait, but how? Because without knowing the current, I can't compute the power. Alternatively, perhaps the frequency is the same, but the current changes, leading to a new core loss. But without knowing the current, perhaps I'm stuck. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says, for each case, determine the core loss. So for each part (a), (b), (c), the transformer is connected to a different source. So for each case, the source's voltage and frequency are different.

Wait, but in the initial condition, the transformer's core loss is 840 W, which includes eddy and hysteresis. The problem states that one-third is eddy, so 280 W eddy, 560 W hysteresis.

In each case, the source is either 4600 V,60-cycle or 4600 V,50-cycle (case a and b), or 4600 and 50 (case c), or 4400 and 50 (case c?).

Wait, the options are for each case:

(a) to 4600 V, 60-cycle

(b) to 4600 V,50-cycle

(c) to 4600 V,50-cycle

Wait, no—wait, the problem says:

(a) 4600 V,60-cycle

(b) 4400 V,50-cycle

(c) 4600 V,50-cycle

Wait, no, let me read the question again:

(a) to a 4,600-volt 60-cycle source,

(b) to a 4,400-volt 50-cycle source,

(c) to a 4,600-volt 50-cycle source.

Wait, so case (a) is 4600 V, 60-cycle.

Case (b) is 4400 V,50-cycle.

Case (c) is 4600 V,50-cycle.

So, for each case, the transformer is connected to a different source.

Hmm, but the transformer's core loss depends on both the voltage and frequency. Because the current is V/Z, which depends on both voltage and impedance Z. But without knowing the impedance (like resistance and reactance), I can't compute the current. So perhaps I'm missing some information.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the transformer's core loss is only due to the frequency-dependent losses, and the current remains the same. Is that possible? Or perhaps the problem is considering that the frequency is the same as before.

Wait, but the initial transformer was 60-cycle, so the problem is likely expecting us to compute the new core loss based on the new frequency, keeping the same voltage and frequency ratio, but the frequency changes.

Wait, but let's think about the transformer's core loss formula. The total core loss is the sum of eddy current loss and hysteresis loss. Both are frequency-dependent.

The eddy current loss is proportional to f times I² (where I is current), and hysteresis loss is proportional to f times I² (since hysteresis loss is I² f A, where A is the hysteresis constant).

Wait, actually, both losses are proportional to f times I². So the total core loss is proportional to f I².

In the initial condition, I_initial = V_initial / Z.

So for initial condition:

I_initial = 4400 V / Z.

For case (a): V_new =4600 V, same frequency (60-cycle), so I_new = 4600 / Z.

So, the ratio of I_new / I_initial = 4600 /4400 = (46/44) = 23/22 ≈ 1.045.

So, eddy current loss in case (a) would be (1.045)^2 * 280 W ≈ 1.092 * 280 ≈ 306.2 W.

Hysteresis loss would be (1.045)^2 * 560 W ≈ 1.092 * 560 ≈ 607.9 W.

So total core loss in case (a) is 306.2 + 607.9 ≈ 914.1 W.

Wait, but in the initial condition, core loss was 840 W. So the initial core loss is 840. So 840 = (f1 I1²) + (f2 I2²), but since f1 = f2, this makes the total core loss proportional to I².

Wait, but I think for the same voltage, the current increases with the square of the ratio of frequencies, but wait no. Because I = V/Z, and if Z doesn't change, I is proportional to V. So if you change the voltage, I changes.

So, for case (a), V is 4600 V, same frequency 60. So I is 4600 / Z_initial.

I_initial is 4400 / Z_initial. So I_new is (4600/4400) * I_initial ≈ 1.045 * I_initial.

So, the current increases by 4.5% (approximate).

So, eddy current loss in (a) is 280 * (1.045)^2 = 280 * 1.092025 ≈ 306. 280 * 1.092 is about 306. So 306 W.

Hysteresis loss is 560 * (1.092025) ≈ 560 * 1.092 ≈ 611.5 W.

Total core loss in (a) is 306 + 611.5 = 917.5 W.

Wait, but in the initial case, core loss was 840. So in (a), it's about 917.5 W.

Wait, but that's a significant increase. Let's double-check.

Wait, initial conditions: 4400 V, 60-cycle. Core loss 840 W, which is 280 eddy, 560 hysteresis.

So for (a), 4600 V, 60-cycle.

So, I_new = 4600 / Z_initial.

I_initial =4400 / Z_initial → I_new = (4600/4400) * I_initial → approx 1.045 * I_initial.

So, eddy_current_loss (ec) = 280 * (I_new / I_initial)^2 * eddy% → no, wait, since both losses are proportional to f * I². So, since the frequency is same, the ratio is (I_new / I_initial)^2.

So, (4600/4400)^2 = (46^2)/(44^2) = 2116/1936 = approx 1.092.

So eddy loss in (a) is 280 * 1.092 ≈ 306 W.

Hysteresis loss (h) is 560 * 1.092 ≈ 611.5 W.

Total = 306 + 611.5 = 917.5 W. So case (a) is about 917.5 W.

Looking at the options, let's check which option is close to that.

Looking at the options A to J, each option gives three values. Let me list them:

A: 900, 920, 930.

B:880,850,930.

C:905, 875, 955.

D:915,900,965.

E:910,890,950.

F:890,865,940.

G:895,905,975.

H:920,870,960.

I:907,904,980.

J:930,880,970.

Wait, none of the options exactly have 917.5. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check if I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the new core loss using the initial condition's data.

In the initial condition, core loss (CL) = 840 W, which is 280 eddy + 560 hysteresis.

Assuming the transformer's impedance Z is constant, then the current is I = V / Z. So, for the initial case, I_initial = 4400 / Z.

In case (a), V = 4600 V, so I_new = 4600 / Z.

So, the ratio I_new/I_initial = 4600 /4400 = 23/22 ≈ 1.04545.

So, eddy current loss in (a) is (280) * (1.04545)^2.

1.04545^2 is approximately 1.092.

So eddy_loss = 280 * 1.092 = 306.2 W.

Hysteresis loss is 560 *1.092= 611.5 W.

Total core loss is 306.2 + 611.5= 917.7 W.

So approx 918 W.

Looking at the options, none have exactly that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the transformer's frequency is considered when calculating the current, and the eddy current loss is based on the frequency.

Wait, another thought: The initial transformer has a frequency of 60 Hz, and for each case, the source frequency changes. So the eddy current loss is proportional to f * I².

In the initial case, f_initial = 60 Hz, and eddy_loss_initial =280 W.

In case (a), f_a =60 Hz, same as before. So eddy_loss_a =280 W.

Hysteresis loss_a would be h_a = I_a^2 * f_a * A, where A is hysteresis constant. But without knowing A, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the hysteresis loss is fixed? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the transformer's impedance Z is fixed, so I = V/Z.

So, for case (a):

I_a = V_a / Z =4600 / Z.

I_initial =4400 / Z.

So, I_a = (4600/4400) I_initial = (46/44) I_initial.

So, I_a = (23/22) I_initial.

Now, eddy loss in (a) is 280 W * (I_a / I_initial)^2.

Since I_a = (23/22) I_initial, (I_a/I_initial)=23/22.

(23/22)^2 = (529)/(484) ≈1.092.

So eddy_loss_a =280 * 1.092 ≈306.2 W.

Hysteresis loss in (a) is 560 W * (23/22)^2 ≈560 *1.092 ≈611.5 W.

Total core loss: 306.2+611.5=917.7 W.

Again, this gives about 918 W, which isn't exactly any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the transformer's frequency affects the current in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach for calculating the core loss.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula that the current is proportional to the square root of the frequency. Let me think.

In a transformer, current is I = V / Z, where Z is the impedance. The impedance Z is a function of the frequency and the reactance, which depends on the frequency.

Wait, but without any given data, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the frequency is the same as before, but the source's frequency is different, so the current changes. So for each case, the frequency is different, and the current is V/Z, so the I is different.

But the problem is about the core loss, which is based on the current and frequency. So for each case, I = V / Z, and the core loss is calculated as:

Eddy = f * I².

Hysteresis = f * I².

So total = 2f I².

But since I is V/Z, I can write this as 2f (V²/Z²) = 2f V² / Z².

But without knowing Z, this approach might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the transformer as being modeled by the formula that the current is proportional to sqrt(f), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the transformer's impedance in terms of frequency.

Wait, the impedance Z of a transformer can be approximated as Z = sqrt( (R^2) + (jωL)^2 ), but without knowing R and L, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the frequency is the same as before, but the source's frequency is different, leading to a different current.

Wait, but the problem says that for each case, the transformer is connected to a different source. So perhaps the voltage is fixed, but the frequency changes.

So for case (a), V=4600 V, f_a=60 Hz.

I_a =4600 / Z.

In the initial case, V=4400 V, f_initial=60 Hz.

I_initial=4400/Z.

So, I_a = (4600/4400) I_initial = 1.0909 * I_initial.

So, I_a = I_initial * (4600/4400) = I_initial * (23/22).

So, the current increases by a factor of 23/22.

So, the eddy current loss in case (a) is 280 W * (23/22)^2 ≈280 * (529/484) ≈280 *1.092≈306.2 W.

Hysteresis loss in case (a) is 560 W * (23/22)^2 ≈560 *1.092≈611.5 W.

Total core loss in case (a): 306.2 +611.5 =917.7 W.

Which is approximately 918 W.

Looking at the options, the closest is option (A) 900, (B) 880, etc.

But 917.7 is close to 920, which is in option H:920,870,960.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio.

Wait, let's compute (23/22)^2 = (529/484) =1.092.

So, eddy loss is 280 *1.092=306.2.

Hysteresis loss is 560 *1.092=611.5.

Total: 306.2+611.5=917.7.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the frequency affects the current in a different way, perhaps using the formula I = V / (Z), and Z is a function of the frequency. But without knowing the exact expression for Z, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the transformer's frequency in terms of the source's frequency. For example, if the source's frequency is 60 Hz, then the current is V/Z. If the source's frequency is 50 Hz, then the current is V/Z, but the same Z applies. So, the ratio of I_new to I_initial would be (V_new / V_initial) * (Z_initial / Z_new).

Wait, but without knowing Z_new, it's not possible.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the transformer's frequency is the same as the source's frequency. So for each case, the transformer's frequency is equal to the source's frequency.

Wait, but that's not the case. For example, in case (a), the source is 4600 V,60-cycle, so the transformer's frequency is 60, but the source's frequency is 60.

Wait, no. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the transformer's frequency is fixed, and each case is connected to a different source with the same transformer's frequency. So, for example, for case (a), the transformer's frequency is 60, but the source's frequency is 60. But that can't be, because the transformer's frequency is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the transformer's frequency as fixed, and each case is connected to a different source with the same transformer's frequency. Therefore, in case (a), the transformer's frequency is 60, and the source's frequency is 60, so the current is same as initial.

Wait, but initial case is 4400 V,60-cycle, and the transformer's frequency is 60-cycle. So perhaps case (a) is 4600 V,60-cycle, same transformer frequency. Then, perhaps the current would change because Z is fixed.

Wait, let's recalculate for case (a), assuming that the transformer's frequency is fixed at 60. So, Z is the same for both cases.

So for case (a):

V_a =4600 V.

Z is the same as Z_initial.

I_a = V_a / Z.

So, I_a = (4600 /4400) * I_initial = (23/22) I_initial.

So, eddy loss in (a) is 280 W * (23/22)^2.

Hysteresis loss in (a) is 560 W * (23/22)^2.

Total core loss is (280 +560) * (23/22)^2 =840 * (529/484) =840 *1.092≈921 W.

Hmm, 921 W.

Looking at the options, option H is 920,870,960. So 920 W is close.

But in our calculation, it's 921 W, which would be approximately 920 W.

So, option H is 920,870,960.

Wait, option H's first value is 920. So, is that the correct answer? But wait, I thought in case (a), the transformer's frequency is 60, same as the source, so the current would be higher, leading to higher core loss. So, 920 W is the closest option.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the power loss in each case.

Wait, another approach: The transformer's core loss is given by the product of the frequency and the square of the current. So, CL =f * I².

In the initial case, CL_initial=840 W = f * I_initial².

So, for case (a), CL_a = f * I_a².

But I_a = (4600/4400) I_initial.

So, CL_a = f * (4600/4400)^2 I_initial².

But I_initial² = CL_initial / f.

So, CL_a = f * (4600^2)/(4400^2) * (CL_initial / f).

The f's cancel.

So, CL_a = (4600^2)/(4400^2) * CL_initial.

Compute (4600/4400)^2 = (46/44)^2 = (23/22)^2 ≈1.092.

So, CL_a =1.092 * 840 ≈920 W.

Which is the same as before.

So, the core loss for (a) is approximately 920 W.

Looking at the options, option H is 920,870,960.

So, the answer is option H, which is (H) 920,870,960.

But wait, another way to think about the problem: Maybe the problem is considering the transformer's frequency in terms of the number of turns, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio. Let me confirm:

23/22 =1.04545.

So, 1.04545 squared is approximately 1.092, which is correct.

So, 840*1.092=920.

So, 920 W is the core loss for case (a).

Similarly, for case (b), which is 4400 V,50-cycle.

Wait, but in the problem, each case is a different source. So case (b) is 4400 V,50-cycle.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but the initial approach seems correct.

So, the answer is option H, which is (H) 920,870,960.

Wait, but another thought: Let me compute the transformer's voltage per turn for the initial case, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the transformer's frequency is treated as fixed, and the current is computed based on the source's frequency.

Wait, but in the initial case, the source is 60-cycle, and the transformer is designed to have 60-cycle. So, perhaps the current is same as before.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating this. The initial approach leads me to an answer that's not in the options, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternative approach: Maybe the problem is considering that the transformer's frequency is the same as the source's frequency, and the current is therefore the same as before. But that can't be, because the transformer's frequency is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the transformer's frequency is fixed, but the source's frequency is different, leading to a change in current, hence a change in core loss.

Wait, but in that case, the transformer's frequency is 60, and the source's frequency is 60, so the current is same as before. But that can't be, because the transformer's frequency is fixed.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering that the transformer's frequency is fixed, and the current is computed based on the source's frequency. So, for example, if the source's frequency is different, the current changes, and so does the core loss.

But how?

Wait, I'll think again: The transformer's frequency is fixed, say f = 60 Hz.

The source's frequency is different, say f_s = 60 Hz (same as transformer), so the current is same as before, so no change in core loss. That can't be.

Wait, no, if the source's frequency is the same as the transformer's frequency, then the current is same as before, so no change in core loss. So, how can I get a higher core loss?

Ah, perhaps if the source's frequency is different, the current changes, leading to a change in core loss.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula that the current is proportional to the square root of the frequency.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to apply that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula that the current is proportional to the square root of the frequency, leading to a change in current.

Wait, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier and the correct core loss is 917.7 W, which is approximately 920 W. So, the correct option would be option H, which starts with 920.

But looking at the options again:

H:920,870,960.

So, the answer is H.

But wait, I re-read the problem statement and the options, and I think I'm correct.

So, the answer is option H, which is (H) 920,870,960.
</think>

To determine the core loss for each case, we analyze the transformer's behavior and the given data. The transformer's frequency is fixed at 60 Hz, and the source frequency varies. The current in the transformer changes with the source frequency, leading to changes in the core loss. The core loss is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Core Loss} = f \cdot I^2
\]

where \( f \) is the frequency, and \( I \) is the current.

### Case (a): 4600 V, 60-cycle
1. **Initial Condition (4400 V, 60-cycle):**
   - The current is \( I_{\text{initial}} = \frac{4400}{Z} \), where \( Z \) is the impedance.
   - The eddy current loss is proportional to \( f \cdot I^2 \), and the hysteresis loss is also proportional to \( f \cdot I^2 \).

2. **Transformer Frequency (60 Hz):**
   - For the initial case, \( I_{\text{initial}} = \frac{4400}{Z} \).
   - For the new case, \( I_{\text{new}} = \frac{4600}{Z} \).
   - The ratio of currents is \( \frac{I_{\text{new}}}{I_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{4600}{4400} = \frac{23}{22} \approx 1.04545 \).

3. **Core Loss Calculation:**
   - The eddy current loss increases by \( (1.04545)^2 \approx 1.092 \).
   - The hysteresis loss increases by the same factor.
   - Total core loss: \( (280 + 560) \cdot 1.092 = 840 \cdot 1.092 \approx 920 \, \text{W} \).

### Case (b): 4400 V, 50-cycle
1. **Transformer Frequency (50 Hz):**
   - For the initial case, the current remains \( I_{\text{initial}} = \frac{4400}{Z} \).
   - For the new case, \( I_{\text{new}} = \frac{4400}{Z} \).
   - The ratio of currents is \( \frac{I_{\text{new}}}{I_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{4400}{4400} = 1 \).

2. **Core Loss Calculation:**
   - Total core loss remains the same as in case (a): \( 920 \, \text{W} \).

### Case (c): 4600 V, 50-cycle
1. **Transformer Frequency (50 Hz):**
   - For the initial case, the current remains \( I_{\text{initial}} = \frac{4400}{Z} \).
   - For the new case, \( I_{\text{new}} = \frac{4600}{Z} \).
   - The ratio of currents is \( \frac{I_{\text{new}}}{I_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{4600}{4400} = \frac{23}{22} \approx 1.04545 \).
