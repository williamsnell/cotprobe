Okay, so I need to figure out which of these sites has massive earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle around 3500 years ago. Hmm, let me think about each option one by one.

First, Caral comes to mind. I remember that Caral is a pyramid site, but I'm not sure about the earthworks. The question mentions concentric ridges in a semicircle. I think Caral is more known for its pyramid complex, but I'm not certain if it has these specific ridges. Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, Chichen Itza. I've heard a lot about that. It's famous for the Great Pyramid of Giza, but wait, the question is about earthworks with concentric ridges. I think Chichen Itza is associated with the pyramids, but do they have these concentric ridges? Or is it more about the pyramid's structure and the design of their elaborate structures? I'm not sure. I think Chichen Itza is more about the pyramids, so maybe not the answer.

Then there's the Parthenon. I know that the Parthenon has a lot of stone, but I don't recall specific earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle. The site is more about architecture and history, not as much as the pyramids. Plus, the question is about a site with such features, so maybe not.

Machu Picchu is another site I'm interested in. I think Machu Picchu is a modified version of an ancient ruin, so I'm not sure if it has the kind of earthworks described. Plus, I don't remember it featuring concentric ridges in a semicircle.

Then there's Angkor Wat. I'm pretty sure Angkor Wat is known for its massive stone structures, including the famous mausoleum of King Surya. I think they have elaborate stone carvings and perhaps some pyramids or other structures, but I'm not certain about concentric ridges in a semicircle. Maybe, but I'm not sure.

The Great Pyramids of Giza are ancient, but the question is about 3500 years ago, which is a very specific time frame. I don't recall them having such specific features, unless they were part of a complex, but I don't think that's the case.

Then there's the Colosseum. That's a Roman arena, so I don't think it has earthworks with concentric ridges or semicircles. It's more about the Roman engineering as a whole.

The Colosseum is a Roman structure, so that's probably not the answer.

The Great Pyramid of Giza is too old, around 2.5 million years ago, so that's way beyond the 3500-year timeframe.

The Colosseum is a Roman structure, not Egyptian or other ancient civilizations. So that's probably not the site.

The Great Pyramid of Giza is way too old, so that's not it.

The Colosseum is a Roman structure, so no.

The Great Pyramid is ancient, but it's too old.

So, the options left are Caral, Chichen Itza, Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat, and then maybe the Great Pyramid if I'm missing something, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, the question specifically mentions "centric ridges in a semicircle." Maybe that's a more specific feature. Which sites are known for such features?

Caral has a complex of pyramids, but I'm not sure about the ridges. I think Caral is known for its pyramid complexes, but do they have concentric ridges in a semicircle? I'm not certain. Alternatively, Chichen Itza is famous for its pyramid structures, but I don't think it's known for concentric ridges in a semicircle.

Wait, maybe the Colosseum is a Roman structure, but I don't see how it has concentric ridges. Or perhaps the Great Pyramid is part of a larger complex, but I don't think they have such features.

Let me think again. The question is about sites with concentric ridges in a semicircle. Concentric means same center or circles around the same center. A semicircle is half a circle.

I remember that Machu Picchu is a modified version of a site once believed to be an ancient ruin. I'm not sure about its structure. I don't think it has concentric ridges in a semicircle.

Wait, perhaps Chichen Itza's pyramids? I'm not sure about their design. Alternatively, maybe the Great Pyramid of Giza's design, but that's too old.

Wait, another thought: the Great Pyramid of Giza is part of the Great Pyramid complex, but perhaps it's part of a larger structure, but I don't think they have concentric ridges in a semicircle.

Wait, maybe the Colosseum is a Roman structure, but I don't think it has such features.

Hmm. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible sites. The only ones that are known to have such structures are the Colosseum, but that's a Roman one. The Great Pyramid is ancient. Chichen Itza is famous for the pyramids, but not sure if they have these concentric ridges.

Wait, perhaps the answer is Chichen Itza. I'm a bit confused because I thought Chichen Itza is more about the pyramids and their structures than having those specific ridges. Or perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, Caral might have such features.

Wait, I think Caral is known for having a central pyramid with layers, and maybe some concentric features. So, Caral is a possible candidate.

Alternatively, Machu Picchu is a modified site, but I don't think it's known for concentric ridges in a semicircle.

Let me think about the options again. The question is about a site with concentric ridges in a semicircle around 3500 years ago.

So, the possible sites are Chichen Itza, Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat, or maybe the Great Pyramid.

Wait, the Great Pyramid is too old, so no. So the options left are Chichen Itza, Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat.

Wait, another angle: the question says "concentric ridges in a semicircle." That could imply a circular pattern, but a semicircle is half a circle. So perhaps a semicircular pattern around a central point.

I think Chichen Itza is famous for its pyramids, and I think they have intricate carvings and structures, but I'm not sure about the concentric ridges. Alternatively, maybe the Great Pyramid of Giza is part of a complex with such features, but again, that's too old.

Wait, perhaps the answer is Chichen Itza, because it's famous for having the pyramids and their structures. Or perhaps it's Angkor Wat. I don't know.

Alternatively, another thought: the Colosseum isn't a site with concentric ridges. The Great Pyramid is too old.

Wait, the answer options are from A to J. Let me list the options again:

A: Caral
B: Chichen Itza
C: The Parthenon
D: Machu Picchu
E: Angkor Wat
F: The Great Pyramids of Giza
G: The Colosseum
H: Poverty Point
I: Gobekli Tepe
J: Stonehenge

So, from the list, the possible sites with concentric ridges in a semicircle are likely Chichen Itza, Machu Picchu, or Angkor Wat.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is Chichen Itza because it's known for the pyramids and their intricate designs. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the Great Pyramid of Giza is part of a complex, but I don't think they have concentric ridges in a semicircle.

So, among the options, the most plausible is Chichen Itza, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe Machu Picchu, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, another thought: the Great Pyramid of Giza is part of the Colosseum complex? No, the Colosseum is a Roman structure. So that's not it.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the time frame. The question is about 3500 years ago, which is around the time the Great Pyramid was built. But perhaps the answer is the Great Pyramid because it's the only one that's ancient, but the question is about a site with those specific features.

Wait, but the question specifies "concentric ridges in a semicircle." So, maybe the answer is not the Great Pyramid. Maybe it's Chichen Itza because the site is famous for its pyramids and their carvings.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Machu Picchu, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is Chichen Itza because it's known for the pyramids and their structures. But I'm not 100% certain about the concentric ridges.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the Great Pyramid of Giza, but that's too old. So, the options are narrowed down to B, D, or E.

Wait, maybe the answer is B: Chichen Itza, because that's the most famous site with pyramids and intricate carvings.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the most famous, but the question is about a site with concentric ridges in a semicircle. I don't think the Giza pyramids have such features, but perhaps the Colosseum has one. No, the Colosseum is a Roman structure and not a pyramid site.

So, considering all, I think the answer is B: Chichen Itza.
</think>

The correct answer is B: Chichen Itza. This site is renowned for its pyramids and intricate carvings, which may include the concentric ridges in a semicircle that date back to 3500 years ago. 

Answer: B
