Question:

A highway patrol officer stopped a driver for speeding and found that the person had a suspended license. He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?

Options:

A: Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.
B: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have the driver's consent to search the car.
C: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had the right to search the car for officer safety reasons.
D: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had a reasonable suspicion to search the car due to the driver's suspended license.
E: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the car after finding out about the suspended license.
F: No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.
G: Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.
H: Yes, the motion will be granted because the cocaine was found in a personal item, not in plain sight.
I: No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.
J: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have a warrant to search the jacket on the back seat.

Okay, let's try to figure out this law question. So, the question is about whether the highway patrol officer's search of a car should be suppressed because the driver has a suspended license. Hmm.

The facts are that the officer stopped the driver because of speeding and the driver had a suspended license. The driver moved for suppression of the cocaine, which he found in a zippered jacket on the back seat. So, the officer was supposed to search the car, but the driver wanted to suppress the evidence.

I remember that the Suppression Clause in the Fifth Amendment says you can't search for personal property without the officer's consent. But wait, the officer had a warrant for a search, right? He had to search the car because it was a vehicle for the officer's use. So, the officer's right to search applies here.

The officer's search was for a search warrant if there were no other exigent circumstances. The fact that the officer had a warrant for the search of the car makes me think that the officer didn't have to ask for a warrant for the search of the jacket. But wait, the search of the jacket was part of the search for the car, so perhaps the officer was required to have a warrant for that as well.

Wait, but the officer was able to obtain a warrant for the search of the car. So, the officer must have a warrant. So, the officer's search for the car is covered by the warrant. Therefore, the officer didn't need to have a warrant for the search of the jacket. So, the officer's search for the car is within the bounds of the Fourth Amendment, specifically the Suppression Clause. So, the search is allowed because the officer had a warrant.

So, the driver moved for suppression, but the officer's search was allowed because of the warrant. Therefore, the suppression motion is denied.

Looking at the options: option I says the motion will be denied because there's no expectation of privacy toward property, which makes sense. Option A suggests the search is necessary unless there are exigent circumstances, which I think is a variant of the Suppression Clause but not entirely correct because the officer's warrant would cover it. Option E talks about probable cause, but since the officer has a warrant, no probable cause is needed. Option C and D are about the officer's right to search. Option G suggests suppression because the item was personal, but I think that's not necessarily the case. Option H says no warrant was needed, which is incorrect because the officer had one. Option J is wrong because no expectation of privacy is needed.

So the correct answer is option I: No, the motion will be denied because there's no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car. Wait, but option E also says no because probable cause wasn't there. But the officer had a warrant, so no probable cause. So the reasoning in option I is correct because the officer's search is covered by the warrant, so suppression is denied. Option E is also correct in saying no probable cause, but I think the issue is more about the warrant issue. So, the court would hold the search is allowed, so the suppression motion is denied.

Wait, let me think again. The officer had a warrant for the search of the car. So the search was within the limits of the Fourth Amendment because of the warrant. So the officer's right to search applies, so the search for the car is allowed, and thus the suppression is denied, which is option I. Alternatively, option E is also correct, but the correct reasoning is based on the officer's own right to search, supported by the warrant. So the suppression motion is denied because the officer had a warrant, which is option I.

The correct answer is I: No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.
