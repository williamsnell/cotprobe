Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about migration trends. I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking about the tendency for migration to decrease with distance. The options are A to J, each describing different factors or concepts related to migration.

Hmm, I remember that migration refers to the movement of people from one place to another. There are different factors that affect how migration occurs. The options given include various concepts like push and pull factors, geographic isolation, gravity model, etc.

Let's break this down. The term "tendency for migration to decrease with distance" sounds like it's talking about how as you move further away, the likelihood of people migrating decreases. So, it's a pattern where the further you go, the less migration happens.

I think about the concept of the gravity model in geography. The gravity model is a way to predict the flow of people, goods, or other items between locations. It assumes that the flow between two places is proportional to the product of their populations and inversely proportional to the distance between them. So, the formula is something like: Flow = (Population1 * Population2) / Distance. This suggests that as distance increases, the migration tends to decrease because the product of the two populations divided by a larger distance would be smaller.

So, if the gravity model is the correct answer, then option H is probably the right choice. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something else.

Another thought: pull factors. Pull factors refer to the reasons why people migrate, such as job opportunities, education, etc. So that's more about the reasons behind it, not the trend itself. So maybe A or B are about factors, not the trend.

Push factors are about the reasons why migration is happening in the first place, like the need for work or education. So that's not the trend's tendency to decrease.

Geographic isolation – that's when people are not moving because they're separated by a large distance, but I'm not sure if that's a factor that leads to a decrease in migration. Maybe more about why people don't migrate, not the trend itself.

Push and pull factors relate to the reasons for and reasons against migration, so that's not directly the tendency.

Migration selectivity refers to why people choose certain areas over others, but again, not the trend of distance affecting it.

Friction of distance – that sounds like the idea that moving to a new place creates some resistance, like traffic, noise, or other costs. So as distance increases, this friction becomes more significant, leading to fewer people migrating. So friction of distance (option J) fits.

Wait, but I thought the gravity model is more fundamental. For example, the gravity model explains why the flow decreases with distance. So in that case, the answer should be H: gravity model.

But I'm a bit confused now because I remember that some textbooks say the gravity model is the primary tool for explaining migration patterns. So in that case, the trend would be called the gravity model.

Alternatively, maybe friction of distance is the term they're using in this question. Let me think. The question says the tendency is called. So, the term is either friction of distance (J) or gravity model (H).

Wait, another angle: the question is about the tendency. The phenomenon where migration decreases with distance is called what? That should be called the gravity model because it's a theoretical framework that explains why this happens.

Alternatively, friction of distance is a concept that might be used in explaining why some people don't move. But the term 'tendency' suggests it's a natural phenomenon, so the gravity model is more likely.

So, putting it together, the correct answer is H: gravity model.

The term "tendency for migration to decrease with distance" refers to a phenomenon where the likelihood of migration diminishes as the distance between locations increases. This is best explained by the gravity model, which predicts that migration flows are proportional to the product of populations and inversely proportional to distance. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: gravity model.
