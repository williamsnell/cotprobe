Okay, so I've got this question about the density of gallium and how it's used in a barometer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the question says that the density of liquid gallium is 6.09 g/cm³ at 35°C, and we need to find the height of a gallium column that would sustain 1 atm of pressure. Oh wait, barometers work by measuring pressure, so in this case, the pressure is 1 atm, which is the atmospheric pressure.

I remember that in a barometer, the pressure is supported by a column of fluid. The height of that column depends on the density and the gravitational acceleration. I think the formula is something like height equals pressure divided by density times gravity. Oh wait, more accurately, it's P = ρgh, so h = P/(ρg).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The standard barometer uses mercury because it's less dense than water, but in this case, it's gallium. So the same principle applies: the pressure of 1 atm must equal the pressure exerted by the gallium column.

So, 1 atm is the pressure. Density of gallium is 6.09 g/cm³. Oh, but I need to make sure about the units. Since the density is in g/cm³, and pressure is in pascals or something. Wait, no—probably the units will work out because when using the formula, the units will cancel appropriately.

But wait, let me think about the units. Let's see: pressure is given in atm. I know that 1 atm is 101325 Pascals. Density of gallium is 6.09 g/cm³. But for the formula, I need to convert all to SI units. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the conversion factor between bar and mmHg, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, another approach: since 1 atm is 101325 Pascals, and the pressure from the gallium column is P = ρgh. So we can write h = P/(ρg). But wait, the units for pressure and density will affect the result.

Alternatively, I can convert units to make it easier. Let's see. For the formula, maybe I should use pressure in Pascals, density in kg/m³, and g as 9.81 m/s².

So, density of Ga: 6.09 g/cm³. Let me convert that to kg/m³. Since 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³, so 6.09 g/cm³ is 6.09 * 1000 = 6090 kg/m³.

Pressure P is 1 atm, which is 101325 Pascals.

So, h = P/(ρg) → h = 101325 / (6090 * 9.81).

Let me calculate that.

First, compute the denominator: 6090 * 9.81. Let's see, 6000 *9.81 = 58860, 90 *9.81=882.9, so total is 58860 + 882.9 = 59742.9. So denominator is approximately 59742.9.

So h = 101325 / 59742.9 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 59742.9 times 17 is 59742.9 * 10=597429, 59742.9 *7=418,199.3 → 597429 + 418199.3=1,015,628.3. Hmm, wait, that's larger than 101325.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me compute 101325 ÷ 59742.9.

Wait, 59742.9 * 17 is 59742.9 *10=597,429; 59742.9 *7=418,199.3 → sum is 1,015,628.3. So 1.0156e6 is greater than 1.01325e5. So 17 is too big.

Wait, so let me try 17 times 59742.9 is 1,015,628.3. That's more than 101,325, so perhaps it's 17 times 5.97429e4. Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me try a better approach.

Let me compute 101325 ÷ 59742.9.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1e4 to make it easier: 1013.25 / 597.429 ≈ ?

Hmm, approximately 1.696.

Wait, because 597.429 * 1.696 = ?

Wait, 597 *1.7 is about 597 *1.6 = 955.2, 597 *0.1=59.7 → 1014.9. Oh wait, 597.429 * 1.697 ≈ 1013.25. Because 597.429 *1.697 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 101325 ÷ 59742.9 ≈ 1.697.

So h is approximately 1.697 meters, which is 1697 mm. Wait, because 1 meter is 1000 mm.

So the height would be about 1697 mm. Looking at the options, option G is 1697 mm Ga. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Did I make any mistake in the units?

Wait, density is 6.09 g/cm³. Let's convert that to kg/m³. Since 1 g = 0.001 kg, 1 cm³= (0.01 m)^3=1e-6 m³. So 6.09 g/cm³ = 6.09 * 1000 kg/m³ (because 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³). So 6.09 * 1000 = 6090 kg/m³.

g is 9.81 m/s².

So, h = P/(rho * g ) → 101325 / (6090 *9.81 ) → calculate denominator: 6090 *9.81 = ?

6090 * 10 is 60900, but 9.81 is 10 minus 0.19. So 60900 - (6090 *0.19). 6090 *0.1 = 609, 6090 *0.09=548.1 → 609+548.1=1157.1. So 60900 - 1157.1 = 59742.9. So denominator is 59742.9.

So 101325 ÷59742.9 = approximately 1.697, which is 1697 mm.

So the height is 1697 mm, which matches option G.

To determine the height of a column of gallium required to sustain 1 atm of pressure, we use the relationship between pressure, density, and gravity: 

\[
h = \frac{P}{\rho g}
\]

Here:
- \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pascals} \),
- \( \rho = 6.09 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 6090 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \),
- \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

### Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula
\[
h = \frac{101325}{6090 \times 9.81}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
\[
6090 \times 9.81 = 59742.9
\]

### Step 3: Perform the division
\[
h = \frac{101325}{59742.9} \approx 1.697 \, \text{meters}
\]

### Step 4: Convert meters to millimeters
\[
h \approx 1.697 \, \text{m} \times 1000 = 1697 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Final Answer
The height of the gallium column is approximately **1697 mm**, which corresponds to option **G**.
