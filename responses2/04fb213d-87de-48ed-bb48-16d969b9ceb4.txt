Okay, so I have this question about sunspots and solar cycles. Hmm, I remember that sunspots are those black areas on the Sun's surface, right? And the question is about when their number increases and what the period is called. Let me think.

I think the sun has a cycle related to these sunspots. I'm pretty sure it's a regular cycle, not something that changes every year. But wait, what's the exact number of years for this cycle? I remember hearing it's about 11 years. Oh wait, no, wait—maybe it's different. I recall that the solar cycle is about 11 years, but I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, no, another thought: the solar cycle I think is longer, maybe 11 years. But I also remember something about the number of sunspots increasing every 11 years. Or was it every 11 years? Oh, no, wait! I think the cycle is about 11 years. Because I've heard the term SolarCycle before, and it's around 11 years. So the number of sunspots goes up and down every 11 years.

Looking at the options, the choices are A:15, B:10, C:13, D:11, E:7, F:16, G:12, H:9, I:14, J:20. So D is 11, which I think is the correct answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the solar cycle is about 11 years, but maybe the number of sunspots increases more frequently. Oh wait, no—the cycle itself is the 11-year period. The number of sunspots increases every 11 years, but that's the cycle's duration. So the period they refer to is 11 years.

So the correct answer should be D:11.

The correct answer is D:11. Sunspots increase in number every 11 years, which is known as the solar cycle. 

Answer: D
