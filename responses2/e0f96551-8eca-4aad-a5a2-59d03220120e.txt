Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: "They call up more every day.
"Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
"But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie."
Du Fu, "Ballad of the Army Carts," ca. 750 C.E.

Okay, so I have this question about Tang society and gender relations, based on Du Fu's poem. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking which of the options correctly reflects the gender relations in Tang society as depicted in the poem. The options are A through H, and the correct answer must be one of them. I remember that Du Fu's poem is from 750 C.E., so the times are relatively ancient but specific to Tang society.

Looking at the poem, I see several mentions of soldiers and their training. The poem talks about military personnel, like the village headman tying bandannas and the mention of "garrisons in the west." It also mentions that the soldier tasks are not part of his duty. There's a part where the Shanxi soldiers were never sent home, and there's a demand for land tax from the District Officers, which seems to indicate that their labor was essential. 

One of the key points is when a son is born, he's considered unlucky. The poem says, "It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry and live with the neighbors next door." This suggests that sons might have a bad reputation, possibly because they're seen as having a tough time working, maybe because they're too strong or not nurturing. This could imply that sons are not as desirable as daughters.

Looking at the options:

A: Women in Tang society had limited roles outside the home. The poem doesn't directly state this, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The poem doesn't mention women working outside the home, but it does talk about military soldiers and the role of the soldier, so maybe this is not the main point.

B: Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas. The poem doesn't mention any changes in conscription practices; it's more about soldiers' tasks. So I don't think this is correct.

C: Agricultural work could be shared by women and men alike. The poem doesn't indicate that women worked on their own fields. It seems more like the soldier's role is the main focus, but maybe there were some women involved in agriculture, but the poem doesn't specify. Hmm, not sure.

D: Women were encouraged to become soldiers to fill conscription. The poem doesn't say anything about women entering the military; it's more about soldiers' tasks. So this might not be the case.

E: Traditional Chinese gender relations were reversed during Empress Wu Zetian's reign. Empress Wu's reign was later, and I think the Tang period started around 617, so Empress Wu's reign was from 618 to 622. The poem seems to show that daughters were seen as more desirable, which contradicts traditional gender roles. So this option is likely incorrect.

F: The birth of a daughter was seen as a misfortune. The poem says sons were considered unlucky, so this would fit. This seems like the correct answer.

G: Men were predominantly responsible for the household while women worked in the fields. The poem doesn't mention this; it's more about soldiers and their tasks, not household responsibilities. So this might not be correct.

H: Confucian relationships between husband and wife were still strong. The poem doesn't discuss anything about husband-wife relationships, so I don't think this is relevant.

So, the correct answer is F: The birth of a daughter was seen as a misfortune in Tang society.
