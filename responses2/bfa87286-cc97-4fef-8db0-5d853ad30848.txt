Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light traveling from water to diamond. Hmm, I remember that when light moves from one medium to another, it bends according to Snell's Law. Snell's Law is n1 * sin(theta1) = n2 * sin(theta2), right? 

The question says the angle of incidence is 13 degrees. The water has a refractive index n=1.33, and diamond is n=2.42. So I need to find the angle of refraction when light goes from water to diamond.

Let me write down what I know. n1 is 1.33, theta1 is 13 degrees. n2 is 2.42. I need to find theta2. So applying Snell's Law:

n1 * sin(theta1) = n2 * sin(theta2)

Which would be 1.33 * sin(13°) = 2.42 * sin(theta2). I need to solve for theta2.

First, calculate sin(13 degrees). I'm a bit fuzzy on exact values, but I think sin(10) is about 0.1736, and sin(13) would be a bit higher. Maybe around 0.2249? Or perhaps I should use a calculator for better accuracy. Wait, I don't have a calculator here, but I can estimate. Alternatively, I can just proceed symbolically for now.

So, 1.33 * 0.2249 ≈ 1.33 * 0.225. Let's calculate that: 1.33 * 0.2 is 0.266, 1.33 *0.025 is 0.03325. So total is about 0.266 + 0.03325 = 0.29925. So the left side is approximately 0.299.

So now the equation is 0.299 = 2.42 * sin(theta2). Let's solve for sin(theta2):

sin(theta2) = 0.299 / 2.42 ≈ 0.1235.

So what angle has a sine of about 0.1235? Thinking about sine values: sin(7 degrees) is about 0.12186, sin(7.2) is about 0.125. Wait, 0.1235 is between 7 and 7.5 degrees. Let me think more precisely.

Using a linear approximation: from 7° (0.12186) to 7.5° (0.126). Wait, wait, 7 degrees is about 0.12186, 8 degrees is about 0.13917. Wait, perhaps I should create a table.

Wait, let me think again: 7 degrees sin is approx 0.12186, 7.2 degrees is around 0.125. Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator. Alternatively, maybe I can think of when sin(theta) is 0.1235.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of small angles. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 0.299 / 2.42. Let me compute that division: 0.299 / 2.42. 2.42 goes into 0.299 about 0.1235 times. So sin(theta2) is approximately 0.1235.

Now, to find theta2, I'll need to take the inverse sine. I remember that sin(7 degrees) is about 0.12186. Let's compute how much more. Let's see, 0.1235 is 0.00164 more than 0.12186.

The derivative of sin(theta) is cos(theta), which at 7 degrees (0.122 radians) is cos(7°) ≈ 0.9925. So, the approximate change in theta (delta theta) corresponding to a change in sin(theta) of 0.00164 is delta theta ≈ (0.00164) / (0.9925) ≈ 0.00165 radians. Now, converting that to degrees: 0.00165 * (180/pi) ≈ 0.094 degrees. So theta2 is approximately 7 degrees plus 0.094, around 7.094 degrees. Wait, but that's about 7.1 degrees.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me check with some exact values. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach. Let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should think that 0.1235 is close to 7.1 degrees. Let me compute sin(7.1 degrees) to see if it's about 0.1235. So, sin(7 degrees) is 0.12186. 0.1 degrees: sin(7.1) is approximately sin(7) + (0.1 degrees in radians) * cos(7). 0.1 degrees is about 0.001745 radians. So cos(7) is approx 0.9925. So delta sin is 0.9925 * 0.001745 ≈ 0.001735. So sin(7.1) ≈ 0.12186 + 0.001735 ≈ 0.123595. That's very close to 0.1235. So theta2 is approximately 7.1 degrees.

Wait, but the options are given as numbers, not as angles. So looking back at the options, option C is 3.7, D is 5.6, H is 9.4, etc. Hmmm. Wait, 7 degrees isn't one of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check the initial steps.

Wait, n1 is 1.33, n2 is 2.42. Angle of incidence is 13 degrees.

Snell's law: n1 sin(theta1) = n2 sin(theta2)

So, 1.33 * sin(13) = 2.42 * sin(theta2)

Calculate sin(13): approximately 0.22495. So 1.33 * 0.22495 is approximately 0.2991.

So 0.2991 = 2.42 * sin(theta2). So sin(theta2) = 0.2991 / 2.42 ≈ 0.1235.

So, sin(theta2) is approximately 0.1235.

Wait, but I thought that 7.1 degrees has a sin of about 0.1235, but when I checked, I saw that 7.1 degrees gives sin approx 0.1236. So theta2 is approximately 7.1 degrees. Looking at the options, option F is 4.8, which is way too low. Option C is 3.7, which is even lower. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the sine value.

Wait, perhaps I should get a more accurate value. Let me compute 0.2991 divided by 2.42.

0.2991 / 2.42 → Let me compute this division accurately. 2.42 goes into 0.2991 how many times?

2.42 * 0.12 = 0.2904. Because 0.1 * 2.42 is 0.242, 0.02 * 2.42 is 0.0484 → 0.242 + 0.0484 = 0.2904.

So 0.12 is 0.2904. The remainder is 0.2991 - 0.2904 = 0.0087. So 0.0087 / 2.42 ≈ 0.00359.

So 0.12 + 0.00359 ≈ 0.12359. So sin(theta2) ≈ 0.12359.

Now, to find theta2, what angle has a sine of 0.12359. Let me think: sin(7 degrees) is about 0.12186, and sin(7.5) is about 0.1305. Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute using small angle approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the inverse sine function. Since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can think in terms of known values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator method.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it this way. Let me try to compute sin(7 degrees): 0.12186. Our value is 0.12359, which is about 0.00173 more than 0.12186.

The derivative of sin(theta) at theta=7 degrees (theta in radians) is cos(7 degrees) ≈ 0.992546. So, the change in sin(theta) is approximately the derivative times the change in theta (in radians). So, delta sin ≈ (d(sin θ)/dθ) * delta theta → delta theta ≈ delta sin / (d(sin θ)/dθ) )

So, delta theta (radians) ≈ 0.0017359 / 0.992546 ≈ 0.00175 radians.

Convert that to degrees: 0.00175 * (180/pi) ≈ 0.00175 * 57.2958 ≈ 0.100 degrees.

So, theta2 is approximately 7 degrees + 0.1 degrees, which is about 7.1 degrees.

Wait, but in the options, I don't see 7.1. Let me check the options again. The options are A:6.2, B:11.2, C:3.7, D:5.6, E:2.9, F:4.8, G:7.1, H:9.4, I:8.3, J:10.5.

Ah, option G is 7.1 degrees. So, the answer should be G:7.1 degrees.

But wait, let me make sure. Did I make any mistake earlier?

Wait, another approach: perhaps using a calculator would be better. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that light moving from water (n=1.33) to diamond (n=2.42) is going from a lower to higher refractive index, so the angle should be smaller, which aligns with our calculation (7.1 degrees) being smaller than 13 degrees.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for Snell's law. The angle of incidence is 13 degrees. So, sin(13) is approximately 0.22495.

So, 1.33 * 0.22495 = approx 0.2991

Then, 0.2991 / 2.42 = 0.12359.

Which gives sin(theta2) = 0.12359 → theta2 is approximately 7.1 degrees.

So the correct answer is option G, 7.1 degrees.
</think>

To determine the angle of refraction when light travels from water (n = 1.33) to diamond (n = 2.42) with an angle of incidence of 13°, we use Snell's Law:

\[
n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
\]

### Given:
- \( n_1 = 1.33 \)
- \( \theta_1 = 13^\circ \)
- \( n_2 = 2.42 \)

### Step 1: Calculate \( \sin(\theta_1) \)
\[
\sin(13^\circ) \approx 0.22495
\]

### Step 2: Apply Snell's Law
\[
1.33 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.42 \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
0.2991 = 2.42 \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( \sin(\theta_2) \)
\[
\sin(\theta_2) = \frac{0.2991}{2.42} \approx 0.12359
\]

### Step 4: Find \( \theta_2 \) using the inverse sine function
\[
\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.12359)
\]

Using a calculator or approximation:
\[
\sin(7^\circ) \approx 0.12186, \quad \sin(7.1^\circ) \approx 0.12359
\]

Thus, \( \theta_2 \approx 7.1^\circ \).

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option is **G: 7.1 degrees**.
