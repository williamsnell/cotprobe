Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it. The question is about calculating the change in mass (Δm) between the final and initial nuclei when a gamma ray is emitted. The reaction given is ^19_8O (excited state) decaying into ^19_8O (ground state) plus a gamma ray. The energy released is given as 1.06 × 10^8 kcal/mol.

Wait, the question is asking for the difference in mass in grams per mole. Hmm, I remember that mass and energy are related via Einstein's equation E=Δm c². So, I think this is about the mass defect involved in the decay process, which is related to the energy released.

So, the reaction is O^19 (excited) → O^19 (ground) + gamma ray. Since the gamma is a high-energy photon, it's emitted without changing the nucleus, so the mass of the products (the ground state and the gamma) would be a little less than the initial mass.

Wait, but the problem is about the mass difference per mole. Oh right, because when you calculate the mass defect, you multiply it by the number of moles to get the mass difference per mole.

So, the gamma ray has zero rest mass, but when it's emitted, the decay process itself must account for a mass loss. The energy released (ΔE) is given as 1.06e8 kcal/mol. So, that energy is converted into mass via E=mc².

But wait, I need to make sure the units are right. The mass difference (Δm) is in grams per mole. So, the steps I need are:

1. Convert the energy from kcal/mol to joules per mole.
2. Use E=Δm c² to find Δm in kg/mol.
3. Convert kg to grams.
4. Convert the result to grams per mole.

Let me go through each step.

First, the given energy is 1.06 × 10^8 kcal/mol. I need to convert this into joules. I know that 1 kcal = 4184 J. So, 1.06e8 kcal per mole × 4184 J/kcal. Let me calculate that.

1.06e8 × 4184 = Let's compute 1.06e8 * 4.184e3 = (1.06 *4.184) * 1e11.

Wait, 1.06 *4.184 is approximately 4.417. So 4.417e11 J per mole.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1.06e8 is 1.06 x 10^8, multiplied by 4.184e3 (since 4184 is 4.184e3). So 1.06e8 *4.184e3 = 1.06 *4.184=4.417, times 10^(8+3) =10^11. So 4.417e11 J/mol.

But wait, the mass defect comes from the energy released. So, the mass difference (Δm) is equal to E/(c²).

I remember that c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. So c squared is (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So, Δm = E / (c²) = (4.417e11 J) / (9e16 m²/s²) = (4.417e11) / (9e16) kg/mol.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so dividing by c² (m²/s²) gives kg/mol.

Let me compute that.

4.417e11 / 9e16 = (4.417/9) * 1e(11-16) )= 0.49078 * 1e-5 = 4.9078e-6 kg/mol.

Wait, 4.417 divided by 9 is approximately 0.4908. So, 0.4908e-5 kg/mol.

To convert this to grams per mole, I multiply by 1000, so 0.4908e-5 * 1000 = 0.4908e-2 = 4.908e-3 grams per mole.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting 4.908e-3 g/mol, but looking at the options, I see a positive value option B is -4.92e-3, and H is -5.92e-3, etc. So, but wait I'm getting a positive number. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is a decay, so the mass of the products is less than the reactant. So, the mass defect (Δm) is positive, as the reactant nucleus has more mass than the products.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the emission is of a gamma ray. So, in the reaction, the O^19_8 (excited) is going to O^19 (ground) plus a gamma. So, the mass of the O^19_8 (excited) is greater than O^19_8 (ground), because the excited state has a higher binding energy and perhaps more mass.

Wait, but wait: when atoms lose energy (like in decay), mass is lost as energy (mass defect). So, the difference in mass (Δm) is the mass of the products (ground state O and gamma) minus the reactant (excited state O). Oh, no: the decay would be:

O^19 (excited) → O^19 (ground) + gamma.

So, the reactant has a higher mass than the products. So, the mass difference is positive, which would mean Δm is positive. Because the reactant's mass is more than the products. So, Δm is positive.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking for the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei. Oh wait, the final is the ground state O, and the initial is the excited state O. So, the mass of the final (ground) is less than initial (excited). So the mass difference (Δm) is positive.

Wait, but I'm getting about 4.9e-3 grams per mole. Looking at the options, option C is 4.92e-3 g/mol, option B is -4.92e-3.

Wait, but wait the problem says to calculate Δm as the difference between final and initial. So, final is ground state, initial is excited. So, Δm = m_final - m_initial = negative. So, Δm is negative.

Wait, no. Because m_final is less than m_initial. So, m_initial - m_final is positive. But the question is about m_final minus m_initial, which is negative. So, the mass difference is negative.

Wait, the question says: Calculate Δm, the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei. So, the final is the ground state, the initial is the excited state. So, Δm = final - initial = m_final - m_initial = negative.

Ah, that makes sense. So in my calculation, I got a positive value for Δm, but the question is asking for final minus initial, so it's negative. So the correct value would be -4.92e-3 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option B is -4.92e-3. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I think I might have mixed up the initial and final.

Wait, the reaction is:

^19_8O (excited) → ^19_8O (ground) + gamma.

So, initial nucleus is excited O, final nucleus is ground O. So, Δm = m_final (ground O) - m_initial (excited O) = negative.

Right. So Δm would be negative, so the answer is option B.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, the energy released is 1.06e8 kcal/mol. So, that's the energy that's released into the gamma photon. So, the mass defect is E/(c²), which is 1.06e8 kcal/mol * 4184 J/kcal / (9e16 m²/s²).

Wait, let me recalculate that with more precision.

1.06e8 kcal/mol = 1.06 * 10^8 kcal/mol.

1 kcal = 4184 J. So:

1.06e8 * 4184 = 1.06e8 * 4.184e3 = (1.06 * 4.184) * 1e11.

Compute 1.06 *4.184:

1 *4.184 is 4.184.

0.06 *4.184 is 0.25104.

So sum is 4.43504.

So 4.43504e11 J per mole.

Divide by c²: 9e16 m²/s².

So, 4.43504e11 / 9e16 = (4.43504 / 9) * 1e-5.

4.43504 /9 is approximately 0.49278.

So, 0.49278e-5 = 4.9278e-6 kg/mol.

Convert to grams: 4.9278e-6 kg/mol * 1000 g/kg = 4.9278e-3 g/mol.

So, approximately 4.928e-3 g/mol.

But since the options have 4.92 ×10^-3, which is option C. But wait, the question is about the difference, which is final minus initial.

So, Δm is negative of that because it's ground minus excited. So the correct option is B, which is -4.92e-3.

Wait, but let me double-check the process to ensure I didn't get the sign wrong.

The mass of the initial nucleus (excited) is more than the final (ground) plus the gamma. So the mass defect is m_initial - m_final - m_gamma. But since m_gamma is negligible (it's a photon, no rest mass), m_initial ≈ m_final. So the mass defect is m_initial - m_final ≈ m_initial - m_final = delta m.

Wait, no, the gamma has no rest mass, so the mass change is m_initial (excited) - m_final (ground) = delta m. Since the excited state is heavier, delta m is positive.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between final and initial, which is m_final - m_initial = negative delta m.

I think I may have gotten confused. Let me rephrase.

The problem says the emission is of a gamma. So, the decay is:

Initial: O^19 (excited) → Final: O^19 (ground) + gamma.

So, the mass of the initial is more than the final (ground) plus the photon. So, m_initial > m_final + m_photon.

So, m_initial - m_final = delta m, which is positive.

But the question is asking for Δm = (final - initial) = m_final - m_initial = -delta m.

So, the answer is -4.92e-3 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option B is -4.92e-3 g/mol.

To calculate the difference in mass (Δm) between the final and initial nuclei for the emission of a γ ray, we use the relationship between energy and mass via Einstein's equation, \( E = \Delta m c^2 \). The process involves the following steps:

1. **Convert the energy from kcal/mol to joules per mole**:  
   The given energy is \( 1.06 \times 10^8 \, \text{kcal/mol} \). Since \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4184 \, \text{J} \),  
   \[
   1.06 \times 10^8 \, \text{kcal/mol} \times 4184 \, \text{J/kcal} = 4.435 \times 10^{11} \, \text{J/mol}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the mass defect (Δm) in kg/mol**:  
   Using \( \Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),  
   \[
   c^2 = (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta m = \frac{4.435 \times 10^{11} \, \text{J/mol}}{9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 4.927 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{kg/mol}.
   \]  
   Converting to grams:  
   \[
   \Delta m = 4.927 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{kg/mol} \times 1000 \, \text{g/kg} = 4.927 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

3. **Determine the sign of Δm**:  
   The reaction is \( ^{19}_8\text{O} \, (\text{excited}) \rightarrow ^{19}_8\text{O} \, (\text{ground}) + \gamma \). The initial nucleus (excited state) has a greater mass than the final nucleus (ground state) because the excited state has a higher binding energy and more mass. Thus, the mass of the initial nucleus is greater than the final nucleus, making \( \Delta m \) positive. However, the question asks for the difference between the final and initial nuclei, so \( \Delta m \) is negative.

4. **Final result**:  
   The calculated mass defect is \( 4.927 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol} \), but since the final nucleus has less mass, the difference is negative. Therefore, \( \Delta m = -4.927 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol} \).

Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is **B: -4.92 × 10⁻³ g/mol**.
