Okay, so I've got this problem here about signal decomposition. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The signal is given as x1(t) = cos(3πt) -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). And they want it expressed in terms of real exponentials. The question is asking for the values of B and E in the expression Real(A e^(jπ B t)) + Real(D e^(jπ E t)).

Hmm, I remember that any cosine can be written using Euler's formula. Cosine is the real part of a complex exponential. So, perhaps I can rewrite each term using that identity.

The general formula is: cos(θ) = (e^(jθ) + e^(-jθ))/2. So, applying this to each term.

First term: cos(3πt) can be written as (e^(j3πt) + e^(-j3πt))/2.

Second term: -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). Let's factor out the 4 first. So, -4 * [e^(j(5πt - 0.5π)) + e^(-j(5πt - 0.5π))]/2. Simplifying that, it becomes -2 [e^(j(5πt - 0.5π)) + e^(-j(5πt - 0.5π))].

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me double-check the coefficients. The first term is 1, the second is -4. So, the second term becomes -4*( (e^(j(5πt - 0.5π)) + e^(-j(5πt - 0.5π)) ) ) / 2. Which simplifies to -2 [ e^(j(5πt - 0.5π)) + e^(-j(5πt - 0.5π)) ].

So combining both terms, x1(t) becomes:

(1/2)(e^(j3πt) + e^(-j3πt)) - 2 [ e^(j(5πt - 0.5π)) + e^(-j(5πt - 0.5π)) ]

Wait, perhaps I should factor out the 1/2 from the second term. Let me make sure I'm doing that correctly.

So, the expression is:

x1(t) = [ (e^(j3πt) + e^(-j3πt)) ]/2 - 2[ e^(j(5πt - 0.5π)) + e^(-j(5πt - 0.5π)) ]

Let me factor out the 2 in the second term to make it easier. So, the second term can be written as 2 * e^(j(5πt - π/2)) + 2 * e^(-j(5πt - π/2)).

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's factor out the 2 from the entire expression. Let me see:

x1(t) = (1/2)(e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) + (-2)(e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} )

Alternatively, I can factor out 2 from the second term:

x1(t) = (1/2)(e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) + 2 [ -e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} - e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ]

But perhaps another way to write this. Let me think about the form they want. The expression given is Real(A e^{jπ B t}) + Real(D e^{jπ E t}).

Which means, each term is a real part of a complex exponential with some A and D, and frequencies B and E multiplied by π.

Wait, so each term in x1(t) is a sum of two cosine terms, each expressed as the real part of a complex exponential. So, perhaps I can rewrite x1(t) as a sum of two such terms.

So, let's write each term as Real(A e^{jπ B t}) and Real(D e^{jπ E t}).

Looking back, each cosine term is represented as Real of a complex exponential. So, let's see.

The first term is cos(3π t), which is Real(e^{j3π t} + e^{-j3π t}) / 2. But in the problem statement, the expression is Real(A e^{jπ B t} ), so the coefficient is A. So, perhaps in this case, A would be 1/2, but wait, no. Because the cos(3πt) can be written as Real(e^{j3π t} + e^{-j3π t}) / 2. So, if I'm to express it as Real( ... ), then perhaps each term requires a factor.

Wait, but the problem might be expecting it to be written as a sum of two real exponentials, each with their own coefficients. So, for each term, I can write it as Real(A e^{jπ B t}) and Real(D e^{jπ E t}).

So, for the first term, cos(3πt) = Real(e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) / 2. But in the problem's expression, it's Real(A e^{jπ B t}) + Real(D e^{jπ E t}).

Wait, perhaps I can factor 1/2 into one of the terms. Let me see.

Wait, for the first term, cos(3πt) can be written as Real( (e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) / 2 ). So, if I write this as Real( (e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) / 2 ), then each term in the sum would be (e^{j3πt}/2) and (e^{-j3πt}/2). So, A would be 1/2, B would be 3, and similarly for the second term.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the expression is Real(A e^{jπ B t}) + Real(D e^{jπ E t} ). So, if each term is a real exponential, perhaps each of these terms in x1(t) is a separate one. Alternatively, perhaps each term is being represented as a single exponential. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the original x1(t) can be rewritten as a sum of two terms, each being Real( A e^{jπ B t} ), and another term Real( D e^{jπ E t} ). So, each of these terms is a cosine expressed as a single exponential.

Wait, let me think. So, for each cosine term, I can express it as Real(A e^{jπ B t}) + Real(D e^{jπ E t} ), but that can't be right because each cosine can be written as the sum of two such terms. So, perhaps the problem is asking to express x1(t) as a sum of two real exponentials, each with their own coefficients and frequencies.

Wait, no. Looking back, the question says x1(t) is expressed as the sum of two real exponentials, each Real(A e^{jπ Bt}) and Real(D e^{jπ Et} ), multiplied by their respective coefficients. So, each term is a real exponential (not the sum of two exponentials). So, each term in x1(t) is of the form Real( A e^{jπ B t} ), and so on.

So, the first term is cos(3πt) = Real( e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt} ) / 2. So, this can be written as Real( (1/2) e^{j3πt} ) + Real( (1/2) e^{-j3πt} ), but that's two terms. So, perhaps the problem is considering each of these as separate terms, each with A and B. So, for cos(3πt), the coefficient is 1/2, and B is 3. But then the first part of x1(t) is that. The second term is -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π), which I can rewrite as Real( ... ).

Let me try rewriting each term:

First term: cos(3πt) = Real( (e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) ) / 2. So, if each Real( A e^{jπ B t} ) is each individual exponential, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps each term is represented as a single exponential, but that can't be right because a single cosine is a combination of two exponentials.

Wait, maybe the problem is to express each cosine term as Real( A e^{jπ B t} ), considering each term as a single exponential. Wait, but that's not correct because a cosine is a combination of two exponentials.

Wait, perhaps they're using a different approach. Let me think again: cos(θ) can be written as (e^{jθ} + e^{-jθ})/2. So, if each term is written as Real( (e^{jθ} + e^{-jθ}) / 2 ), then each term is a sum of two Reals, but in the problem's expression, they're using Real(A e^{jπ B t} ), which is a single exponential. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says x1(t) can be expressed as the sum of two Reals, each Real(A e^{jπ B t}), so each term is a single exponential. But that's not possible because a cosine is not a single exponential. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.

Wait, maybe the problem is to express each cosine term as Real( A e^{jπ B t} ), considering the amplitude and the phase. Because each cosine can be written as the real part of a complex exponential. So, cos(3πt) is the real part of e^{j3πt}, and similarly, the second term is the real part of e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)}.

But wait, the problem's expression is Real(A e^{jπ B t}) + Real(D e^{jπ E t} ). So, each term is a single exponential, but that's not possible unless they're combining the two exponentials into a sum. But that would be incorrect. Because each cosine requires two exponentials. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to express x1(t) as the sum of two real exponentials, each of which has a coefficient and a frequency. So, each term is Real(A e^{jπ Bt}), and the other term is Real(D e^{jπ Et}).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Let me compute each term:

First term: cos(3πt) = Real(e^{j3πt}) + Real(e^{-j3πt}) ) / 2. So, if I can write this as a single exponential, perhaps I'd need to factor in some other approach. Alternatively, perhaps they're considering the cosine as a single term, but with a specific exponent.

Wait, but the question explicitly says each term is expressed as Real(A e^{jπ Bt}), so perhaps the two terms in x1(t) must each be written as Real(A e^{jπ Bt}), but that's not possible because each cosine term is a sum of two exponentials. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the problem differently. The problem states that x1(t) can be written as the sum of two Real exponentials. Each Real( A e^{jπ Bt} ) is a single exponential, so perhaps each term in x1(t) is a different exponential. But that's not correct because each cosine is a combination of two exponentials.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the frequency of each cosine term in terms of the exponents in the problem. Let me think. The first term is cos(3πt), which is a cosine with frequency 3π. The second term is -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π), which can be rewritten as cos(5πt - 0.5π) multiplied by -4.

So, the frequency of the second term is 5π, but with a phase shift. So, the frequencies B and E would be 3 and 5, respectively. Because the exponents inside the exponentials are jπ Bt and jπ Et.

Wait, in the first term, the exponent is j3πt, so B is 3. In the second term, the exponent is j5πt, so E is 5. So, the answer would be B: [3,5].

Wait, let me double-check. The problem's expression is Real(A e^{jπ Bt}) + Real(D e^{jπ Et} ). So, each term is Real( exp(jπ Bt) * A ). So, the coefficients A and D are the amplitudes. For the first term, A would be 1/2 (from the first cosine term), because cos(3πt) = Real( e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt} ) / 2. So, the first term can be written as Real( (1/2) e^{j3πt} ), so A is 1/2, B is 3. Similarly, the second term is -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). Let me compute that.

Rewrite the second term: cos(5πt - 0.5π) can be written as cos(5πt - π/2). Using the identity cos(θ) = cos(θ - π/2), which is sin(θ), but perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, using Euler's formula again.

So, cos(5πt - π/2) = (e^{j(5πt - π/2)} + e^{-j(5πt - π/2)}) )/2. So, the second term is -4 times that, which is -2 [ e^{j(5πt - π/2)} + e^{-j(5πt - π/2)} ].

So, each term is Real( something ), so the entire x1(t) can be written as Real(A e^{jπ B t}) where A is 1/2 and B is 3, plus Real(D e^{jπ E t}) where D is -2 and E is 5, but wait, let me compute:

Wait, the second term is -2 [ e^{j(5πt - π/2)} + e^{-j(5πt - π/2)} ].

Which can be written as -2 e^{j(5πt - π/2)} -2 e^{-j(5πt - π/2)}.

But in the problem's expression, the second term should be Real( D e^{jπ Et} ), so D is -2, and E is 5, because 5πt is the exponent's argument, but wait, the exponent inside the exponential is j5πt... But in the problem, it's jπ E t, so E is 5. So yes, E is 5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. Each term in x1(t) is a cosine, which is expressed as Real( something ). So, the first term is Real( (1/2) e^{j3πt} ), so in the problem's expression, A is 1/2 and B is 3. The second term is Real( -2 e^{j(5πt - π/2)} ), but wait, that's not exactly in the form Real( D e^{jπ Et} ), because the exponent is j5πt. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the second term again.

Second term: -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π)

Using cosine's real part:

cos(5πt - 0.5π) = Real( e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ) / 2

So, multiplying by -4: 

-4 * [ (e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ) / 2 ] = -2 [ e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ) ]

But in the problem's expression, it's Real(D e^{jπ Et} ), which would be Real( D e^{j5πt} ) because E is 5. So, the second term is Real( something ), but in our case, it's the sum of two exponentials. So, perhaps the problem is not expecting that, but I think I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is trying to express each cosine as a single real exponential, but that's not correct. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, an alternative approach: perhaps each term can be written as a single exponential in terms of jπ Bt. Let me think. Let's think about putting each term into the form Real(A e^{jπ Bt} )

So, the first term is cos(3πt) = Real( (e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) )/2. So, to write each exponential as e^{jπ Bt}, perhaps shift the exponent.

Wait, the exponent in the problem is jπ B t. So, in the first term, the exponent is j3πt. So, to match jπ B t, B must be 3, and then the exponent inside the exponential would be j3πt, but the problem uses jπ B t. So, jπ B t is jπ * B * t = jπ*(3)*t. So, for B=3, jπ*B t = j3π t. So, the first term's exponential is e^{j3π t}.

So, Real( (e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) ) /2 can be written as Real(A e^{j3π t}), where A is 1/2. So, B is 3.

Then, the second term is -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). Let's compute this.

cos(5πt - 0.5π) = Real( e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ) / 2.

So, multiplying by -4: 

-4 * [ (e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ) / 2 ] 

= -2 * [ e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ) ]

= -2 e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} -2 e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)}.

But the problem's expression is Real( D e^{jπ Et} ), so the exponent is jπ E t. So, perhaps I can factor this term into something that includes jπ E t.

Wait, perhaps jπ E t is the same as jπ * E * t. So, in our case, E is 5, so jπ E t is j5π t. So, perhaps the problem is considering each cosine as a single exponential with E being the coefficient inside the exponent.

Wait, but in the second term, the exponent inside the exponential is j(5πt - 0.5π), which is j5π t - j0.5π. So, perhaps I can factor this as j5π t - j0.5π = j(5πt) - j(0.5π) = j(5πt - 0.5π).

But wait, I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this term as e^{j5π t} * e^{-j0.5π}.

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful either. Wait, perhaps I should accept that the first term is Real( (e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) )/2, which is Real(A e^{j3πt}) where A is 1/2. The second term is -2 [ e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ) ].

But in the problem's expression, each term is Real(D e^{jπ Et} ), so the exponents in the problem are jπ Et, which can be rewritten as jE t. So, E is 5, as the coefficient. So, the second term in x1(t) is Real( -2 e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} ), but that's not in the form Real( D e^{jπ Et} ), because the exponent inside the exponential is j5π t - j0.5π. So, unless I factor out the j, which would leave me with e^{-j0.5π} e^{j5π t}, but that's not the same as j5π t.

Wait, perhaps another approach: can I write each cosine term as a real exponential multiplied by a phase factor?

Wait, no, because Real( A e^{jθ} ) would give a cosine with some phase shift. But perhaps I can write the cosine as a real exponential with a different phase.

Wait, let me think. The first term is cos(3πt), which is equal to Real( e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt} ) / 2. So, if I can write this as Real( A e^{jBt} ), then the phase would be zero, but the amplitude is 1/2.

Wait, but in the problem's expression, the term is Real(A e^{jπ B t} ), so the exponents are jπ B t. So, perhaps I can shift the exponents by appropriate multiples. Let me try.

In the first term, the exponent is j3πt. To match jπ B t, I can write this as jπ (3) t. So, if B is 3, the exponent is jπ 3 t, so yes. So, for the first term, A is 1/2, B is 3.

In the second term, the exponent is j5π t - j0.5π. Wait, perhaps I can write this as j(5πt - 0.5π). But how does that fit into jπ E t? Well, E would be 5, because 5πt is part of the exponent. But the term is j(5πt - 0.5π) = j5πt - j0.5π. So, perhaps this can be written as e^{j5πt} multiplied by some phase. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out e^{-j0.5π} from the term j5πt - j0.5π. So, j5πt - j0.5π = j0.5π (10t - 1). Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as e^{j5πt} multiplied by e^{-j0.5π}.

So, j5πt - j0.5π = j5πt + (-j0.5π) = e^{-j0.5π} * j5πt. But that's not the same as e^{j5πt}, unless I can make some substitutions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: the second term is -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). Let's compute this in terms of exponentials.

cos(5πt - 0.5π) = [ e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ] / 2.

So, -4 cos(...) is -2 [ e^{j(5πt - 0.5π)} + e^{-j(5πt - 0.5π)} ].

But in the problem's expression, each term is Real( D e^{jπ Et} ), so the exponents are jπ Et. So, in the problem's terms, the exponents are jπ Et, which can be rewritten as jE t.

So, perhaps I can match the exponent in the problem's term to the exponent in the exponential.

Wait, but in the second term, the exponent inside the exponential is j5πt - j0.5π. So, j5πt is part of the problem's exponent, but j0.5π is a phase shift. So, perhaps I can write the second term as Real( D e^{jπ Et} ), where Et is 5t, and D is -2. So, the exponent is j5πt, but the problem includes j0.5π as a phase shift. So, perhaps the phase shift is incorporated into the D.

Wait, but that's not correct because the phase shift affects the amplitude of the real exponential. So, perhaps I can't separate the phase shift into the D.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shift is considered part of the real exponential. But that's not correct because a phase shift would change the amplitude of the real exponential.

Wait, perhaps the phase shift is incorporated into the amplitude. So, for example, the term e^{jθ} can be written as A e^{jφ}, where A is the amplitude and φ is the phase.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think: the first term is cos(3πt), which can be written as Real( (e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt}) ) / 2. So, that's two exponentials. But the problem requires each term to be a single real exponential.

Wait, but perhaps it's not necessary to represent each cosine as a single exponential. Instead, perhaps each cosine can be written as a single real exponential, but that's not correct because a cosine is a combination of two exponentials.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering each cosine as a separate term but rather each term is a single real exponential. So, perhaps each term is a real exponential with a certain frequency. Let me think.

Wait, for example, the first term is cos(3πt), which can be written as Real( e^{j3πt} + e^{-j3πt} ) / 2. But perhaps, in the problem's expression, each term is considered as a single real exponential, so the first term would have a frequency of 3π, but maybe the problem is considering the frequency as 3, without the π. But that doesn't make sense because the argument is 3πt.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the frequency as 3, but that's incorrect because the argument is 3πt. So, the frequency is 3, but the argument is 3πt, so the frequency is 3, but the argument is 3πt.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the notation where the exponent's coefficient is the frequency, so jπ B t represents a frequency of π B. So, in the first term, B is 3, so the frequency is 3. In the second term, the exponent is j5π t, so B is 5, so the frequency is 5. So, the frequencies would be B=3 and E=5.

So, in that case, the correct answer is B: [3,5], which matches option B.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is considering the exponent's coefficient as the frequency, so jπ B t has B as the frequency. So, in that case, the answer is correct.

So, to sum up: the first term is cos(3πt), which corresponds to frequency 3. The second term is cos(5πt - 0.5π), which corresponds to frequency 5. So, the correct answer is B: [3,5].
</think>

The correct answer is B: [3,5].

**Explanation:**

The given signal is \( x_1(t) = \cos(3\pi t) - 4\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \).

1. **First Term:** \( \cos(3\pi t) \) can be expressed using Euler's formula as:
   \[
   \cos(3\pi t) = \text{Real}(e^{j3\pi t} + e^{-j3\pi t}) / 2
   \]
   However, the problem expresses each term as a single real exponential. Thus, we identify the frequency as \( B = 3 \).

2. **Second Term:** \( \cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \) is rewritten using Euler's formula as:
   \[
   \cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) = \text{Real}(e^{j(5\pi t - 0.5\pi)} + e^{-j(5\pi t - 0.5\pi)}) / 2
   \]
   Again, the problem expresses each term as a single real exponential. The frequency in this term is \( E = 5 \), as the argument is \( j5\pi t \).

Thus, the frequencies \( B \) and \( E \) are 3 and 5, respectively.

The correct answer is B: [3,5].
