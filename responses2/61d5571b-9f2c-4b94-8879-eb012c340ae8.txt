Question:

What differences emerged with regard to theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic?

Options:

A: From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. The question of what should or what should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security.
B: The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.
C: The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.
D: Theorizing has parallel theoretical forms of knowledge based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about differences in theoretical thinking on both sides of the Atlantic, specifically between the US and Europe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about what differences emerged regarding theorizing. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: From a US perspective, it's common to think the main security voice is external. Then, questions about what counts as security, what should and shouldn't be considered, and conceptualizing security.

Option B: European schools are based on hegemonic knowledge, which is understanding mechanisms through material actions. So they focus on how things cause and affect each other.

Option C: Different knowledge forms relate to conflicting policy-conception. US political science uses problem-solving, while Europe uses critical studies.

Option D: Theorizing has parallel forms based on cause-and-effect. So both sides use empirically backed cause-effect models.

Wait, I remember some key concepts here. I think the US and Europe have distinct approaches to how knowledge is conceptualized and theorized. The US tends to focus on external factors as the main source of security, while Europe might emphasize cause and effect, looking at how things cause what. 

Option A says from the US perspective, they think external is the main voice. So that fits. Then what about what counts as security and how to conceptualize it. That's part of A. So A seems correct.

Option B talks about European schools on a hegemonic form. I'm not as sure about that. Maybe the European school is more about cause-effect, but I'm not certain if it's based on a hegemonic form or something else.

Option C is about conflicting policy conceptions. US uses problem-solving, Europe uses critical studies. That's another possible answer. So this option is about different knowledge forms in terms of policy understanding.

Option D says parallel forms based on cause-effect. So both use cause and effect. I think this is similar to option C, but perhaps more about how each side conceptualizes knowledge.

Wait, so I'm a bit confused between C and D. Let me think again. I remember that the US tends to focus on external factors as the primary cause, which is a problem-solving approach. The European schools, on the other hand, might be more about cause-effect, which is critical studies. So the theoretical forms might be different.

So, option C would be about conflicting conceptions of policy. Option D is about parallel forms based on cause-effect. Hmm. 

Wait, another angle: the question is about what differences emerge regarding theorizing on both sides. So perhaps A and C are about different approaches. But the options are A, B, C, D. So which is a correct answer.

Wait, I'm trying to remember. I think the US tends to focus more on external security, while Europe tends to look at cause-effect. So the question is about the differences in their theoretical approaches.

Looking back at the options, option A says that from a US perspective, the main security voice is external. So that's correct. Then, what about the rest of option A: the questions about what counts as security, how to conceptualize it. That seems to be about the conceptualization part.

Option C is about different forms of knowledge relating to conflicting policy conceptions. So maybe that's about how knowledge is conceptualized.

But I'm not sure which of A or C is the correct answer.

Wait, another approach: what are the main theories each side has. The US might lean more towards external factors, while Europe's theory is more about cause-effect. So the theoretical forms are different.

So, option D suggests parallel forms based on cause-effect. So that would be a correct answer if both sides use cause-effect.

Alternatively, option C is about policy conceptions. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure of the question. It's asking about differences in theorizing between the two sides. So perhaps the key is that the US approaches it as external, while Europe approaches it as cause-effect.

Looking at the options, option A talks about external from the US perspective, and mentions what counts as security and conceptualization. So that's about how the theories are framed.

Option C is about different forms of knowledge, relating to conflicting policy conceptions. So that's about how each conceptualizes knowledge.

Wait, but the question is about what differences emerged in theorizing. So perhaps the main point is that the US tends to focus on external factors, while Europe tends to use cause-effect.

So which option reflects that? Option A's first part is correct (US external). The rest of A is about what counts as security, conceptualization. So if both sides have different theories, perhaps A and C are correct, but the options are presented as separate.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D as separate choices. The question is which one is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the different forms of knowledge relate to conflicting conceptions of the relationship to policy. So the US uses a problem-solving approach, Europe a critical approach.

Oh, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think of another angle. The US is more concerned with external factors, so they focus on the need to protect against external threats. The European school, on the other hand, might focus more on internal mechanisms and cause-effect.

So, perhaps the key points are the focus on external vs internal. Looking back, the options:

Option A is correct in stating that from the US perspective, external is the main voice. Then, the question about what counts as security and how to conceptualize it would be part of that.

Option C is about different knowledge forms in terms of policy conceptions. So if the question is about the form of knowledge, then option C may be correct. But the question is about theorizing, so it's about the approaches to security.

Wait, the question is about the differences in theorizing, not just the form of knowledge. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the structure of the question again. The question is asking what differences emerge regarding theorizing on both sides.

So the US tends to focus on external factors, while Europe's theory is more about cause-effect.

So, for example, the US might look at threat sources as external, while Europe's approach is to look at internal mechanisms and cause-effect relationships.

So the key concept here is that the US and Europe have different focuses on what counts as securityâ€”external vs. internal.

Looking at the options, option A seems to cover that. It says that from a US perspective, the main voice is external. So that part is correct. Then, it also mentions what should and shouldn't be considered, which is about the focus. So that would be a part of theorizing.

Option C is about different knowledge forms, which are based on a conflicting approach to policy. So that's more about the conceptualization of knowledge.

Hmm, the question is about the differences in theorizing, which would involve the specific approaches each side takes. So perhaps option A is the correct answer because it's about the main focus (external vs internal) and the theoretical approaches they take.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the correct answer is C, but I'm a bit conflicted between A and C.

Wait, perhaps another way to approach it: the US tends to think in terms of external security, which is about protecting against threats from outside. The European school, perhaps, is more concerned with internal security and how things cause and affect each other. So the European approach uses cause-effect models, while the US uses a problem-solving approach.

So, looking at the options, option D says that theorizing has parallel theoretical forms based on cause-effect. So both sides use cause-effect. That might be correct.

Wait, no. I think the US uses a problem-solving approach, while the European uses cause-effect. So that would mean that the theoretical forms are different. So option D is about parallel forms.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because it's about the differing conceptions of how knowledge is applied to policy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the two sides have different ways of conceptualizing what knowledge means in the context of security.

Wait, I'm perhaps overcomplicating this. Let me try to think: US: external factors, problem-solving; Europe: cause-effect, critical studies. So the theories are different, not the conceptions of knowledge.

So the correct answer would be about the theoretical approaches. So option D says that both have parallel forms of knowledge based on cause-effect. That might be the case if both use cause-effect, but I think US uses problem-solving, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, option C is about different forms of knowledge, which relate to policy conceptions. So maybe the problem-solving is about practical actions, while critical studies are about understanding mechanisms.

Wait, but none of the options seem to directly state that. Let me look again.

Option A: From a US perspective, external is main, what counts as security, and conceptualization.

Option C: Forms of knowledge relate to policy conceptions, conflicting.

Hmm. So the question is about what differences emerged regarding theorizing, so the correct answer would be about the specific approaches.

I think option A is about the main focus (external vs internal) and the question of what counts as security. So that's part of the theorizing.

Option C is about different conceptions of policy. So perhaps that's more about the conceptualization of how knowledge is applied, rather than the approach to security.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the key difference is in how they conceptualize knowledge as applied to policy. So the US's approach is problem-solving, while Europe's is critical.

Alternatively, another approach: looking up what US and European security theories are known for.

US: Often focused on external threats, like cyberattacks, and uses theories like contingency planning and the need for security measures. Also, maybe they use problem-solving approaches for security.

European: They might focus more on internal mechanisms, like supply chain issues, and use cause-effect or critical studies.

So, the theories are different. The question is about the differences. So the correct option would be about the approaches.

So, looking at the options again, option A is about the main voice being external, which sounds correct. Then, it talks about the questions of what counts as security, and conceptualization. So that's about the approach to security.

Option C is about different forms of knowledge relating to policy conceptions. So perhaps the main focus is on the approach to security, not the conceptions of knowledge.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the different forms of knowledge relate to differing conceptions of policy. So for example, US uses problem-solving (pragmatic approach), while Europe uses critical thinking (deductive approach). So the knowledge forms are different.

Wait, but what do the options say? Option C says that the different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy. So that would imply that each has a different way of looking at how knowledge relates to policy.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C because it's about different conceptions of the policy relationship, which leads to differing knowledge forms.

I'm getting a bit tangled. Since I'm a bit stuck, I'll try to think about which option covers the main focus of the US versus Europe.

US: main focus on external. Europe: internal mechanisms.

So option A is correct in that sense, though it's not entirely about the conceptions of knowledge but about the main approach to security.

The question is about the differences in theorizing on both sides, so perhaps it's about the different theoretical approaches they take.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, but another thought: the question is about what differences emerged regarding theorizing, so the answer is about the approaches to security. So option A is about the main voice being external, which is a key difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it's about the differing conceptions of the relationship to policy.

Wait, but the question is about the theories, not the conceptions. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm really not confident. Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is C because the different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting approach to policy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick option A, as it's about the main focus of the US (external) versus Europe's internal approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it's about the different conceptions of how knowledge relates to policy.

After thinking, I think option A is correct because it discusses the main voice, which is a key difference. It also touches on what counts as security, which is a theoretical aspect. So that's probably the correct answer.
</think>

The question asks about the differences in theorizing between the U.S. and Europe regarding security. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A**: Suggests that from a U.S. perspective, the main voice of security is external. This aligns with the U.S. focus on external threats, while Europe might lean towards internal mechanisms. It also mentions questions about what counts as security and how to conceptualize it, which are key theoretical aspects. This option covers the main focus and theoretical approaches.

- **Option B**: Proposes that Europe is based on a "hegemonic form of knowledge," where knowledge is understood through material mechanisms. This is more about the methodology rather than the theoretical approaches, making it less relevant.

- **Option C**: Discusses differing forms of knowledge relating to policy conceptions, where the problem-solving tradition in the U.S. differs from critical studies in Europe. This focuses on the conceptualization of knowledge rather than the theoretical approaches to security.

- **Option D**: States that both have parallel theoretical forms based on cause-and-effect. While the U.S. uses problem-solving, the European approach is more causal, making this option incorrect.

After evaluating the options, **Option A** best captures the key differences: the U.S. focuses on external security, while Europe emphasizes internal mechanisms. It also touches on theoretical approaches, which align with the question's focus on theorizing.
