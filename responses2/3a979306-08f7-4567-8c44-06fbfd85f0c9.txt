Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Why are the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (C, H, O, N) of immense importance in living matter ?

Options:

A: These elements make up the majority of non-living matter.
B: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are the four most abundant elements in living organisms, make up about 99 percent of the mass of most cells, and can readily form covalent bonds by electron pair sharing.
C: These elements are rare and precious.
D: They are noble gases that are crucial for maintaining the structure of proteins.
E: These elements are responsible for the magnetic properties of living organisms.
F: These elements are heavy metals that are essential for building DNA and RNA structures.
G: These elements cannot form covalent bonds.
H: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are the only elements that organisms need for survival.
I: These elements are only important for their radioactive properties.
J: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are the only elements that can form ionic bonds.

Okay, so I have this question about why carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are so important in living matter. Hmm, let me think. I remember learning about the different elements and their roles in biology. 

The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option.

Option A says they make up the majority of non-living matter. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Non-living matter would be things like rocks or minerals, and I think those are made of different elements. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: These elements are the four most abundant in living organisms. Oh wait, that's correct. I remember that in humans, for example, oxygen and carbon are the main ones. And in other organisms, like plants, they play a big role. Also, they make up about 99% of the mass in cells. Oh, and they form covalent bonds via electron sharing. So B seems to cover all those points.

Option C: These elements are rare and precious. No, I don't think that's true. They're abundant in nature, like how water and oxygen are everywhere. So C is incorrect.

Option D: They are noble gases and crucial for protein structure. Wait, noble gases are group 18, not these. Proteins are made of amino acids, which have C, H, O, N. But I'm not sure if they're crucial for protein structure. I thought they're important for structure, but I'm not certain. Maybe D is wrong.

Option E: Magnetic properties. I don't think elements are magnetic. Magnetic properties are more about materials like iron or something, not the elements themselves. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Heavy metals for DNA/RNA. No, DNA and RNA are made of C, H, O, N, but they're not heavy metals. Like DNA is about 10-15 atomic mass units, not heavy. So F is wrong.

Option G: Can't form covalent bonds. No, I think all these elements can form covalent bonds. For example, carbon forms carbon dioxide, hydrogen forms methane, etc. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Only for radioactive properties. No, that's not right. Radioactivity is more about elements like uranium and thorium, not the actual elements like carbon.

Option I: Only for their radioactive properties. So I was just thinking, that's not correct. Radioactivity is due to certain elements, but the elements themselves aren't the reason.

Option J: Only for ionic bonds. No, ionic bonds are covalent. Wait, ionic bonds are when atoms lose or gain electrons to form cations and anions. Covalent bonds are when atoms share electrons. So J is incorrect because they form covalent bonds.

So reviewing the options, B seems correct. The elements C, H, O, N are the most abundant in living organisms, making up about 99% of cells. They form covalent bonds via electron sharing. So the answer should be B.

The elements carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N) are crucial in living matter because they are the most abundant in living organisms. They make up about 99% of the mass of most cells and form covalent bonds through electron pairing sharing. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as non-living matter is made of other elements.
- **Option B**: Correct, as it accurately describes their abundance and bonding properties.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as these elements are abundant, not rare.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as they are not noble gases.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as elements are not magnetic.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as DNA and RNA are not heavy metals.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as these elements can form covalent bonds.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as elements are not exclusively for radioactive properties.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as radioactive properties are not the sole reason for elements.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as ionic bonds are covalent.

The correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
