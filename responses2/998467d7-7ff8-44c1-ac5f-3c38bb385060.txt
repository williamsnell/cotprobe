Okay, so I've got this analogy question here. The question is about analogy between vision and hearing, and I need to pick the correct pair from the given options. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that vision involves the eyes, which are located in the occipital lobe. Hearing, on the other hand, involves the auditory system, which is in the temporal lobe. So for vision, the key structure is the occipital lobe, and for hearing, it's the temporal lobe. 

The analogy is "Vision is to hearing as..." so I need to find a pair where one part corresponds to the other. Looking at the options:

Option A: Parietal to frontal. I think parietal is involved in other senses, like touch and balance. Frontal lobe is for higher functions, like problem-solving and decision-making. Not directly related to vision or hearing.

Option B: Temporal to parietal. Temporal is for hearing, parietal for vision. That makes sense because they both are involved in sensory processing but for different senses.

Option C: Temporal to frontal. Temporal is for hearing, but frontals are more about processing information. Not a direct analogy.

Option D: Occipital to parietal. Occipital is the visual part of the eye, and parietal is for vision. So this is a correct pair.

Option E: Parietal to occipital. That's the reverse of D. Parietal is for vision, occipital for hearing. The analogy is about which is to which, so it's the same as D but reversed. Wait, looking back, the question is "as...", so the structure would be "Vision is to hearing as X is to Y." So if X is parietal and Y is occipital, then it's the same as D. So E is parietal to occipital, which would mean that vision is to hearing as parietal is to occipital. Wait, that's the same as D, because D is occipital to parietal. So E is the reverse. So for the analogy, the correct pair would have the same structure. So for example, A is parietal to frontal, which doesn't fit.

Wait, let me clarify. The analogy is Vision is to hearing as X is to Y. So the first pair is Vision (ocipital) to Hearing (temporal). So the second pair should be X (lobe) to Y (lobe). Let's look:

Option D: occipital is to parietal. So that's correct because vision and hearing are both in their respective lobes.

Option E: parietal is to occipital. That would mean that parietal is the equivalent for hearing, which isn't correct. So E is incorrect.

So the correct answer is D: occipital is to parietal.

The analogy compares vision and hearing, with vision involving the occipital lobe and hearing involving the temporal lobe. The correct pair is the one where the structures correspond to these functions. 

- **Option D**: Occipital lobe to parietal lobe correctly represents that both are involved in sensory processing but for different senses.

ANSWER: D
