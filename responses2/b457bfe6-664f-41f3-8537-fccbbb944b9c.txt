Question:

Juan rolls a fair regular octahedral die marked with the numbers 1 through 8. Then Amal rolls a fair six-sided die. What is the probability that the product of the two rolls is a multiple of 3?

Options:

A: \frac{2}{3}
B: \frac{1}{36}
C: \frac{1}{288}
D: \frac{3}{8}
E: \frac{1}{4}
F: \frac{1}{18}
G: \frac{5}{8}
H: \frac{1}{2}
I: \frac{1}{8}
J: \frac{1}{144}

Okay, so I need to find the probability that the product of Juan's and Amal's rolls is a multiple of 3. Let's break this down.

First, I know that a multiple of 3 means the product can be 3, 6, 9, etc. Since both dice are fair, I should calculate the probability step by step.

Let's think about Juan's die. It's an octahedral die with numbers 1 through 8. The probability that Juan rolls a number that's a multiple of 3 is the number of multiples of 3 divided by 8. Multiples of 3 between 1-8 are 3, 6. So that's 2 numbers. So Juan has a 2/8 chance, which simplifies to 1/4. Alternatively, the probability he doesn't roll a multiple of 3 is 6/8 or 3/4.

Similarly, Amal's die is a regular six-sided die. The numbers are 1 through 6. The probability that Amal rolls a multiple of 3 is the number of multiples of 3 in 1-6. That's 3 and 6, so 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3. Therefore, the probability she doesn't roll a multiple of 3 is 4/6 or 2/3.

Now, for the product to be a multiple of 3, at least one of the numbers must be a multiple of 3. So, the only way the product isn't a multiple of 3 is if neither roll is a multiple of 3. So, I should calculate the probability of that scenario and subtract it from 1.

So, the probability that Juan doesn't roll a multiple of 3 is 3/4, and the probability that Amal doesn't roll a multiple of 3 is 2/3. Since the rolls are independent, I multiply these probabilities: 3/4 * 2/3 = (3*2)/(4*3) = 6/12, which simplifies to 1/2.

Therefore, the probability that neither rolled a multiple of 3 is 1/2. So the probability that at least one did roll a multiple of 3 is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, I can calculate the favorable cases.

Total possible outcomes are 8 (Juan) * 6 (Amal) = 48.

The product is a multiple of 3 if either Juan's number is a multiple of 3, or Amal's, or both.

Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion:

Probability(Juan multiple of 3) + Probability(Amal multiple of 3) - Probability(both multiples of 3).

So, that's 2/8 + 2/6 - (2/8 * 2/6).

Calculating each term:

2/8 = 1/4, 2/6 = 1/3.

Multiplying 2/8 * 2/6 = (2*2)/(8*6) = 4/48 = 1/12.

So, adding: 1/4 + 1/3 = (3/12 + 4/12) = 7/12. Then subtract 1/12: 7/12 - 1/12 = 6/12 = 1/2.

So, same result. So the probability is 1/2, which is option G.

The probability that the product is a multiple of 3 is calculated by considering the cases where at least one roll is a multiple of 3. Using inclusion-exclusion, the probability is (2/8 + 2/6) - (2/8 * 2/6) = 1/2. 

Answer: G: 1/2
