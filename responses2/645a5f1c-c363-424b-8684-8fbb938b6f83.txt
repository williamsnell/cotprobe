Okay, so I've got this integral to solve. The question is about finding the value of the integral of the vector field A dot da over a closed surface S. The vector field A is given as x i minus y j plus z k. The surface S is defined by a cylinder with radius c, extending from z=0 up to z=d. The top and bottom of the cylinder are at z=d and z=0, respectively.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with integrals of vector fields over a closed surface, the Divergence Theorem might come into play. The Divergence Theorem relates the flux through a closed surface to the divergence of the vector field inside the volume. The theorem says that the integral of A · da over S is equal to the triple integral of the divergence of A over the volume enclosed by S.

So first, I should find the divergence of A. The divergence is the sum of the partial derivatives of each component with respect to x, y, and z respectively. So, let's compute:

A = x i - y j + z k.
div(A) = ∂(x)/∂x + ∂(-y)/∂y + ∂(z)/∂z.
Calculating each term: ∂x/∂x is 1, ∂(-y)/∂y is -1, and ∂z/∂z is 1. So 1 -1 +1 = 1. Oh, so the divergence of A is 1.

Wait, that's a constant. So the triple integral of the divergence over the volume would just be the volume of the region multiplied by 1, right? Because the divergence is 1 everywhere inside the volume. So the integral becomes equal to the volume of the cylinder.

What's the volume of a cylinder? It's πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Here, the radius is c, and the height is d (from z=0 to z=d). So the volume is πc²d.

So the integral of A · da over the closed surface S is equal to πc²d. Looking at the options, option A is πc²d. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check if I made any mistakes. 

Wait another thing, sometimes when you have a closed surface, you have to consider the orientation of the normals. But the problem says S is a closed surface, and the top and bottom are at z=d and z=0. So the normal vectors for the top face would point upwards (positive z), and for the bottom face, downwards (negative z). But when you apply the Divergence Theorem, the theorem accounts for the outward-pointing normals. So in this case, the top face's normal is upwards, and the bottom's is downwards. But the Divergence Theorem calculates the outward flux regardless of the direction. Wait, but does that affect anything here? Let me think. 

Wait, the divergence theorem says that the flux through the surface is the integral of the divergence over the enclosed volume. Since the divergence is 1, the integral is the volume. So regardless of the orientation of the normals, the theorem gives the same result because it's the net outward flux. So I think I didn't make a mistake in that part.

So the correct answer should be option A: πc²d.

To find the value of the integral $\int_S \mathbf{A} \cdot d \mathbf{a}$, we use the Divergence Theorem, which relates the flux through a closed surface $S$ to the divergence of the vector field $\mathbf{A}$ inside the volume $V$ enclosed by $S$. The theorem states:

$$
\int_S \mathbf{A} \cdot d \mathbf{a} = \iiint_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} \, dV
$$

### Step 1: Compute the Divergence of $\mathbf{A}$
The vector field is given as:
$$
\mathbf{A} = x \mathbf{i} - y \mathbf{j} + z \mathbf{k}
$$

The divergence of $\mathbf{A}$ is:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(-y) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z)
$$

Calculating each term:
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x) = 1, \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(-y) = -1, \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z) = 1
$$

Adding these together:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1
$$

### Step 2: Set Up the Volume Integral
The surface $S$ is a closed cylinder with radius $c$ and height $d$ (from $z=0$ to $z=d$). The volume enclosed by this cylinder is:
$$
V = \pi r^2 h = \pi c^2 d
$$

Since the divergence of $\mathbf{A}$ is 1, the integral of the divergence over the volume is:
$$
\iiint_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} \, dV = \iiint_V 1 \, dV = V = \pi c^2 d
$$

### Step 3: Conclusion
The value of the integral $\int_S \mathbf{A} \cdot d \mathbf{a}$ is equal to the volume of the cylinder, which is $\pi c^2 d$. This corresponds to option **A**.
