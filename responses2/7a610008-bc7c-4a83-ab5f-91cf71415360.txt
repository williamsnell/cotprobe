Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the work done by a force moving an object along a straight line. Hmm, work done by a force is one of those physics concepts I remember vaguely. 

The force given is F = 8i -6j +9k. Oh, right, that's a vector in three-dimensional space. And the object moves from the point (0,10,8) to (6,12,20) along a straight line. So, I think I need to compute the work done by that force over this displacement.

Wait, I remember that work done by a force is the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector. Oh right, W = F · d. 

But wait, I should make sure I'm getting the displacement correct. So, the initial position is (0,10,8) and the final is (6,12,20). So displacement vector d is the final minus initial. Let me calculate that.

d_x = 6 -0 =6
d_y=12-10=2
d_z=20-8=12
So, displacement vector d is 6i + 2j +12k.

Now, the force is F =8i -6j +9k. So, to find the work, I compute the dot product of F and d.

Dot product is (8)(6) + (-6)(2) + (9)(12). Let me compute each term:

8*6 is 48,
-6*2 is -12,
9*12 is 108.

Adding them up: 48 -12 is 36, plus 108 is 144. Oh, wait, 48-12 is 36, then 36 +108 is 144. So the work done should be 144 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 144 J. So the answer should be A.

Hold on, did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check. 

Displacement vector: (6,2,12) — correct. Force vector: (8,-6,9) — correct. Dot product: 6*8=48, 2*(-6)=-12, 12*9=108. Sum is 48-12=36 +108=144. Yep, that's right. So option A is correct.

To calculate the work done by the force **F = 8i - 6j + 9k** that moves an object along a straight line from point (0, 10, 8) to (6, 12, 20), we use the formula for work done by a force:

\[
W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d}
\]

where **d** is the displacement vector. The displacement vector is calculated as the final position minus the initial position:

\[
\mathbf{d} = (6 - 0)\mathbf{i} + (12 - 10)\mathbf{j} + (20 - 8)\mathbf{k} = 6\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{j} + 12\mathbf{k}
\]

Next, compute the dot product of **F** and **d**:

\[
\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d} = (8)(6) + (-6)(2) + (9)(12) = 48 - 12 + 108 = 144 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the work done is **144 J**, which corresponds to option **A**.
