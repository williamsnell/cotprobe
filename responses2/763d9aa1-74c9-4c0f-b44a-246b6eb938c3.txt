Alright, let me try to work through this question. So, the question is about the majority of Supreme Court justices and what characteristics they have. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Okay, first, I'll read the question again to make sure I understand it. The question is asking which statement is true about the majority of Supreme Court justices. The options are various statements about their backgrounds, political affiliations, terms, etc.

I remember that the Supreme Court consists of justices who are part of the majority of the court. They are appointed by the Senate and the House of Representatives, and they serve a term of nine or ten years. But I'm not sure about the specifics of their prior experience or political connections.

Looking at the options:

A: Have no prior judicial experience. Hmm. I think the majority are experienced, but I'm not certain. Maybe some have prior experience but not necessarily none.

B: Are appointed by presidents of the same political party. I don't think that's correct. The appointment is by the Senate and House, not necessarily the same party.

C: Have previously served as Vice President. I don't recall any Supreme Court justices having held that position. They're all in the Senate, except for some who do serve in higher positions, but that's unusual.

D: Are appointed by the Senate. Yes, the majority are appointed by the Senate, but I think they also serve by the House. So maybe not the only way they're appointed.

E: Nominated by the Speaker of the House. Wait, I think the majority is appointed by the Senate and the House. So they're both part of the process. Which option says that? Let me check the options again.

Wait, option E says "nominated by the Speaker of the House." That doesn't sound right because I don't think the majority is nominated by the House. I think the majority is appointed by both the Senate and the House. So E might not be correct.

F: Have a background in criminal law. I'm not sure if that's a characteristic of the majority. Some might have criminal law backgrounds, but it's not the primary reason for their role.

G: Stay on the court for only a decade. No, the majority serve for nine or ten years, not only a decade.

H: Are required to have a degree in constitutional law. I think many are law school graduates, but the majority aren't required to have a specific degree, like constitutional law. So H might not be correct.

I: Are required to retire at age 70. No, the majority serve for nine or ten years, which ends at around 79. So I don't think this is accurate.

J: Switch party affiliation during their term. I don't recall any Supreme Court justices changing their party before their term. They're all in the Senate, so they probably stick to the same party.

Wait, going back to option E: I think the majority are appointed by the Senate and the House, but the majority themselves are appointed by the Senate. So option E might not be correct. Because option E says they are "nominated by the Speaker of the House," which I don't think is correct.

Looking back, let me think again. Option E: "are nominated by the Speaker of the House." I thought the majority is appointed by the Senate and the House, but I might have gotten that wrong. Maybe the majority is both appointed by the Senate and the House. So option E might not be correct.

Wait, the majority are appointed by the Senate and the House. So option E is incorrect because it says they're nominated by the Speaker, which I don't think is correct. Option E is incorrect.

So the correct answer would be the one that's accurate about the majority's characteristics.

Option A: Have no prior judicial experience. I think the majority have some, but not necessarily no experience. Some might have been in law before serving on the court.

Option B: Appointed by the same political party presidents. No, appointments are by the Senate and House.

Option C: Have served as Vice President. No, I don't think any of them have.

Option D: Appointed by the Senate. Correct, majority are appointed by the Senate.

Option E: Nominated by the Speaker. No.

Option F: Criminal law background. Not a must.

Option G: Only ten years. No.

Option H: constitutional law degree. Not required.

Option I: Retire at 70. No.

Option J: Switch party. No.

So the correct answer is D: are appointed by the Senate. Because the majority are appointed by the Senate and the House. So the majority are both appointed by the Senate and the House. So the correct option is D.
</think>

The correct answer is D: are appointed by the Senate. The majority of Supreme Court justices are appointed by the Senate and the House of Representatives, and they serve a term of nine or ten years. They are not required to have a degree in constitutional law, nor are they required to have prior judicial experience. The majority is not required to retire at 70, and they are not required to switch parties. They are appointed by both the Senate and the House, not just the Speaker. Therefore, the correct statement is that they are appointed by the Senate.

Answer: D
