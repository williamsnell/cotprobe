Okay, so I've got this question about the DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with it, but I remember it's related to genetics. Let me think. The question is asking which chromosome has the deletion causing this syndrome.

Wait, I think this is a Mendelian disorder. Mendelian genetics, right? So, the genetic basis for certain disorders is often linked to specific chromosome numbers. I remember that some conditions are autosomal, meaning they affect a non-sex chromosome, but others are X-linked.

Wait, wait, DiGeorge and Shprintzen's syndrome is a condition with X-linked recessive inheritance. Oh right! I think it's inherited from the maternal side because I remember that autosomal disorders are usually X-linked, like colorblindness. So, the mother must have had a mutation.

Now, the question is about the chromosome. So, let's think about the options. The options are numbers 1 to 22. Wait, which one is linked to an X chromosome?

I think chromosome 13 is the X chromosome. Because chromosome 14 is the Y, so 13 is X. Oh wait, but the question is about the deletion. Wait, I might be mixing up autosomal and X-linked.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Autosomal recessive diseases are on the X, while X-linked are on the X. So, if this is X-linked, the mother must have inherited the X from her mom. So, does the X chromosome number refer to the X or the chromosome number in general?

Wait, the X chromosome is number 13. So, if someone has a mutation on that chromosome, it's their X. So, the question is about which chromosome has the deletion. So the correct answer should be 13. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option J is 13. So the correct answer must be J.

The DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. The X chromosome in question is number 13.
