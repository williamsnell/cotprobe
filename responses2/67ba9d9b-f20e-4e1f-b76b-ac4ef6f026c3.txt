Okay, so I have this physics problem here about waves in a medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says the medium has a relative permittivity of 25 and a relative permeability of 1. I need to find the phase velocity and the index of refraction. Oh right, I remember that both of these are related to the properties of the medium.

Wait, what's the formula for phase velocity again? Oh right, phase velocity v_p is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the square root of the relative permittivity. So v_p = c / sqrt(ε_r). Oh right, and the speed of light in a vacuum is like 3e8 meters per second, but sometimes it's 300 million or 3e8. So substituting ε_r =25, sqrt(25) is 5. So v_p would be 3e8 /5, which is 6e7 m/s. Wait, 3e8 is 300,000,000. Divided by 5 is 60,000,000, so 6e7 m/s. But looking at the options, let me see.

Wait, the options for phase velocity are given in 1e8 or 0.1e8. So 6e7 is 0.6e8. Let me look at the options. Option I: 0.2e8, no. Option D: 0.6e8, 5. Option F: 0.4e8,4. Option G is 1.2e8,12. Oh, so phase velocity is 0.6e8, which is 6e7. So looking for 0.6 and an option for index of refraction.

Wait, the index of refraction n is given by sqrt(ε_r * μ_r). Oh right, because n = c / v_p, and v_p is c/n. So n=sqrt(ε_r * μ_r). Here, μ_r is 1, so n is sqrt(25 * 1) = 5. So the index is 5. So the options must have 5 for the index.

Looking back, which options have 5 as the index of refraction? Option D has 5 as the index. So the phase velocity would be 0.6e8 m/s. So the correct answer should be option D: 0.6 ×10^8 m/s and index 5.

Wait, but let me double-check the formulas. Yes, phase velocity v_p = c / sqrt(ε_r μ_r) since both ε and μ are factors that affect the speed. But wait, wait, no: the index of refraction is n= sqrt(ε_r μ_r). So for n, since μ_r is 1, n is sqrt(25)=5. And phase velocity is v_p = c/(n). So 3e8 /5 = 6e7, which is 0.6e8. So options D is 0.6e8 and 5. So the answer would be D.

To solve the problem, we use the relationships for phase velocity and index of refraction in a medium. The phase velocity \( v_p \) is given by:

\[
v_p = \frac{c}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_r \mu_r}}
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, \( \varepsilon_r = 25 \) is the relative permittivity, and \( \mu_r = 1 \) is the relative permeability. Substituting the values:

\[
v_p = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{\sqrt{25 \times 1}} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{5} = 0.6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The index of refraction \( n \) is given by:

\[
n = \sqrt{\varepsilon_r \mu_r}
\]

Substituting \( \varepsilon_r = 25 \) and \( \mu_r = 1 \):

\[
n = \sqrt{25 \times 1} = 5
\]

From the options provided, the phase velocity is \( 0.6 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and the index of refraction is \( 5 \). The correct option is **D: 0.6 × 10⁸ meters/sec, 5**.
