Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Mayan art and iconography. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll recall what I know about Mayan culture. The Mayan people are known for their advanced art and their depiction of various deities and mythologies. I remember that their art often featured detailed depictions of natural elements and sometimes more abstract forms. So, the options given are A to I, each suggesting different themes.

Option A is about mutilation and violence. I don't think Mayan art is known for depicting such acts. They seem more about the divine and the natural world, not the killing or violence.

Option B is stars and comets. While Mayas did have a complex understanding of the cosmos, their art included detailed depictions of celestial bodies. But I'm not sure if they were depicted as comets, which are more modern and less Mayan.

Option C is infants and children. That doesn't ring a bell. The art wouldn't focus on young children or their physical forms, more on adults and their roles.

Option D is modern technologies. That doesn't make sense. Mayan art is ancient and wouldn't feature anything modern.

Option E is domesticated animals. I know that the Mayas created a complex system of animals, like chichuchuacans, which were used for worship and governance. So their art would include depictions of these domesticated animals, which makes this a strong candidate.

Option F is love and sex. While love was valued in Maya culture, the art itself is more about deities and mythological figures. I don't recall them specifically depicting sexual themes.

Option G is landscapes and sceneries. Yes, the Mayas did have a rich artistic style that included detailed depictions of landscapes. They created intricate drawings and paintings that represent vast, natural terrains and scenes.

Option H is everyday household activities. Mayan art might depict some household items, but it's not as central as other options. The focus is more on deities and mythological figures rather than practical daily life.

Option I is abstract geometric shapes. I believe the Mayas were known for using geometric patterns in their art, such as the use of polygons and symmetrical designs. Their art often featured abstract forms, so this could be a contender.

Now, let's think about the options. The question is asking which is prominently featured. I know that Maya art includes depictions of many natural elements and sometimes abstract shapes, but are there specific ones?

Looking again, option G (landscapes and sceneries) and option I (abstract geometric shapes) both are possible. But the question is about what's prominently featured. I think the Mayas did create elaborate depictions of landscapes, which would be option G. Also, their abstract art often uses geometric shapes, which is option I.

Wait, but I should narrow it down. Mayan art is more about mythological and deities, so the depictions might include scenes from various mythologies. But the options given don't include mythological themes, so I have to choose between G and I.

Hmm. I recall that Mayans had a rich understanding of the natural world, including elements like water, earth, and air. They created detailed depictions of natural landscapes, including landscapes and sceneries. So option G seems correct.

Alternatively, abstract geometric shapes are a common feature. But maybe the question is more about the specific elements depicted. The art wouldn't focus on modern technologies or everyday household activities, except perhaps domestic animals, which is E.

Wait, but the options are A to I, and the question is about what's prominent. So, the correct answer is likely G: landscapes and sceneries.

The correct answer is G: landscapes and sceneries. The Mayan art prominently features depictions of these elements due to their advanced understanding of the natural world, including intricate and detailed landscape scenes. 

Answer: G
