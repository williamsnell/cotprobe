Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state)."

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to recall what I know about the 1860 election and the political context.

First, the question refers to the election of 1861, not 1864, but I might have the dates a bit mixed up. Wait, no, the question says about 1864, but I think the main point is about Lincoln's election. I remember that in 1860, Lincoln won the presidency, and then the election of 1861 was the next step.

In 1861, Lincoln was elected as the 13th President. His campaign was pretty intense, especially in New Jersey, as the article mentions. The main issue was the Emancipation Proclamation and the Civil War. But the question is about why Radical Republicans opposed him in that election. Wait, no, the options are about why he was opposed in 1861, so maybe the question is about why he lost in 1861. But the options all refer to his actions during the election.

Wait, the article says "Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote was the third largest in the nineteenth century..." So, in the 19th century, 55% was third, surpassed by Jackson's 1828 and Grant's 1872. So, Lincoln's popular vote was third, meaning he won more than the others, but not the top three.

In 1861, Lincoln won the presidency, but in the election of 1861, he lost to Andrew Jackson. So, why did he lose that election? Because he ran against him. So, the question is about why the candidates were opposed in 1861, not about the 19th century.

So, the options are about why the radicals opposed Lincoln. Let's look at the options. The question is about the 1861 election. So, the options are about the reasons Lincoln was opposed in 1861.

Option B: The Radical Republicans disapproved of Lincoln's handling of the Civil War. That makes sense because in that election, Lincoln's handling of the Civil War (i.e., the Emancipation Proclamation) was a big part of the campaign. If the radicals didn't like his approach, they would oppose him. But wait, the options are about why he was opposed, not why he won.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about why he lost in 1861. So, the options are about Lincoln's actions in 1861. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about why Lincoln was opposed in 1861 because of his handling of the Civil War. So, if the radical Republicans didn't like how Lincoln was handling the Civil War, they would oppose him, even if he won.

But wait, the options are about the reasons for opposition. So, the options are:

A: Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.
B: The Radical Republicans disapproved of Lincoln's handling of the Civil War.
C: Lincoln's stance on the expansion of the Union was not aggressive enough for the Radical Republicans.
D: The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.
E: Lincoln's decision to suspend habeas corpus angered the Radical Republicans.
F: Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.
G: The Radical Republicans believed Lincoln was too sympathetic towards the Confederacy.
H: Lincoln's refusal to impose harsher punishments on the Southern states upset the Radical Republicans.
I: The Radical Republicans were against Lincoln's plan for the reintegration of the Southern states.
J: Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.

Hmm. The question is about why the Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861. So, which of these options relates to his actions or policies.

Option B says the radicals disapproved of his handling of the Civil War. That fits because in 1861, Lincoln's campaign centered on the Civil War. He was a proponent of the Civil War, as he called it the "War for the Union." His handling there could have been a point of contention among the radicals. So, if the radicals didn't like his approach, they would oppose him, even if he won.

Wait, but the question is about why he was opposed, not why he won. So, in 1861, Lincoln ran against Jackson, and he lost because he won fewer votes, but his campaign was more about the Civil War. So, the radical Republicans might have opposed him because they thought his approach was not acceptable. So, option B would explain that.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is about his failure in the 1860 election, but the question is about 1861, which is the next step after the 1860 election. But the 1860 election led to the 1861 election. So, the question is about why Lincoln was opposed in 1861. So, the candidate ran against him. The 1861 election was the next step.

So, in 1861, Lincoln's campaign was focused on the Civil War. The radicals might have opposed him because he didn't handle the Civil War properly. So, option B would make sense.

Wait, but the options are about why the radical Republicans opposed him in 1861. So, the answer could be B because the radicals didn't like his handling of the Civil War. But another thought: perhaps the radicals opposed him because he wasn't a proponent of the Civil War. So, the answer would relate to his actions in the election.

Looking at the options, option B is "The Radical Republicans disapproved of Lincoln's handling of the Civil War." That would make sense, because if the radicals opposed him, he's the one who's doing the handling.

Alternatively, option D says the radicals wanted immediate emancipation, but Lincoln refused. So, maybe the radicals opposed him because he didn't want immediate emancipation, which he did. Wait, but the radical Republicans were more focused on the Civil War. So, perhaps the issue is that he didn't handle the Civil War well, which the radicals thought was important. So, the answer would be B.

Wait, but another angle: the question is about why he was opposed in 1861. So, perhaps the answer is about the reasons for his defeat. For example, option G: Radical Republicans believed Lincoln was too sympathetic towards the Confederacy. But that might not be correct.

Wait, the 1861 election was the next step after the 1860 election. The 1860 election was won by Lincoln. In the 1861 election, Lincoln ran against Jackson. So, the question is about why Lincoln lost in 1861, but the options are about why the radicals opposed him in 1861.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the article says that Lincoln's handling of the Civil War was done without congressional oversight, which the radicals probably opposed. Because if the radicals were concerned about the effectiveness of the U.S. government, they might have opposed him if he didn't follow through.

So, option A says that Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight. That could be a point of contention for the radicals. If they thought that a U.S. Supreme Court decision was done without proper oversight, they might oppose him.

Alternatively, perhaps the radical Republicans were more focused on the Civil War's importance. So, perhaps the answer is B, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the article says that in 1861, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The popular vote in 1861 was third, surpassed by Jackson and Grant. So, in 1861, Lincoln won the presidency but lost the election because he lost the popular vote. So the ElectoCollegial landslide came because he won more states than the popular vote.

But the question is about why the radical Republicans opposed him in 1861. So, perhaps the answer is about why he lost the election despite winning the popular vote. That would relate to the issues of how he handled the Civil War, which the radicals probably opposed.

So, option B says the radicals disapproved of his handling. So, in 1861, Lincoln's handling of the Civil War (i.e., the Emancipation Proclamation) might have been seen as flawed or unacceptable by the radicals, leading them to oppose him in 1861.

Alternatively, option G says the radicals believed Lincoln was too sympathetic towards the Confederacy. But the 1861 election's result was decided by the popular vote, not the Civil War's outcome. So, perhaps the issue was more about the way he handled the Civil War, not his support for the Confederacy.

So, I think option B is the best fit. It directly relates to the issue that the radicals opposed: their handling of the Civil War.

The question asks why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in the 1861 election. The analysis focuses on the context and options provided.

1. **Option B**: This states that the Radical Republicans disapproved of Lincoln's handling of the Civil War. Since the 1861 election was the next step after Lincoln's victory in 1860, it was centered around the Civil War. The radicals likely opposed his approach to the Civil War, which would explain their opposition in 1861.

2. **Other Options**: Other options relate to different aspects of Lincoln's campaign, such as congressional oversight, the Civil War's handling, or the Civil Rights cause, but they do not directly address the specific context of the 1861 election.

Given the context of the 1861 election and the focus on the Civil War, **Option B** best explains why the Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln.
