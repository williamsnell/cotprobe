Okay, so I've got this division problem here: 123 divided by 8. I need to figure out what the quotient and remainder are. Let me think about how to approach this.

Hmm, division with remainders. I remember that when you divide a number by another, the remainder is what's left after you subtract the largest multiple of the divisor that's less than or equal to the dividend. So, 123 divided by 8.

Let me see, how many times does 8 go into 123? Well, 8 times 10 is 80, and 8 times 15 is 120. Oh wait, 8*15 is 120, right? Because 8*10 is 80, 8*5 is 40, so 80+40=120. So 15 times 8 is 120.

If I subtract that from 123, 123 minus 120 is 3. So the remainder would be 3. So the quotient is 15 and the remainder is 3. Looking at the options, that's option B: 15 remainder 3.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I could use another method, like repeated subtraction or multiplication. Let's try multiplication. 8 multiplied by 15 is indeed 120, which leaves 3 as the remainder. Yeah, that seems right.

Another way is to think about the place values. 8 goes into the hundreds place 80 times (but wait, 8*100 is 800, which is way larger than 123, so that's not right). Let me stick with the initial approach.

So, 8 * 15 = 120. 123 - 120 = 3. So remainder is 3. So the correct choice is option B.

The correct answer is the one where the quotient is 15 and the remainder is 3. This corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
