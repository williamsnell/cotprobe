Alright, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the teacher bought some folders, and I need to find the total number of red and blue folders she has. The question gives me two sets of data: the number of boxes and the number of folders in each box for both red and blue. 

First, I'll break down the information. For red folders, there are 5 boxes, and each box has 36 folders. So, I need to calculate the total red folders by multiplying 5 by 36. Let me do that: 5 times 36. Hmm, 5 times 30 is 150, and 5 times 6 is 30, so adding those together gives 180. So, red folders total 180.

Next, for blue folders, there are 6 boxes, each with 32 folders. I'll multiply 6 by 32. Let me see, 6 times 30 is 180, and 6 times 2 is 12. Adding those gives 192. So, blue folders total 192.

Now, I need to add the red and blue folders together to get the total. So, 180 (red) plus 192 (blue) equals 372. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 372 exactly. The options are A:460, B:340, C:500, D:520, E:600, F:440, G:275, H:550, I:420, J:380.

Looking at those, 372 is closest to which option? Let's see: A is 460, which is 88 more. J is 380, which is 8 less. So, 372 is just 8 less than 380. That's the closest option. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Red: 5 boxes *36 = 180. Blue:6*32=192. 180+192=372. So yes, 372 is correct. The options around this number are J (380) and A (460). Since 372 is 8 away from 380 and 88 away from 460, J is definitely the closest.

The correct answer is J:380.

The total number of red and blue folders is 372, which is closest to 380.
