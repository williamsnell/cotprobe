The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.

Alright, let's tackle this question. The question is about Lin Zexu's letter and which outcome followed its delivery. First, I need to understand the context.

Lin Zexu was a Chinese trade commissioner who wrote a letter to Queen Victoria in 1839. The letter criticized the opium trade, which is illegal and harmful. The main point was that China was importing harmful products to Britain, which was a violation of British law. So, the letter was delivered to Queen Victoria, and the question is about which outcome happened as a result of this delivery.

Looking at the options, I need to find which of these statements was a direct outcome of the letter being delivered. The options are A to J.

Option A: Expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory. That doesn't seem to be related. The letter was about the trade, not about expulsing people.

Option B: Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority. I don't think that's related. The letter was about the trade, not about Muslim minorities.

Option C: The British government compensated China for the damage caused by opium trade. The letter was about importing harmful products, so compensation seems unrelated.

Option D: China and Britain entered into a period of peaceful coexistence. That doesn't seem to be the case. The opium trade was a problem, so it would likely lead to conflict, not peaceful coexistence.

Option E: A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories. Wait, Lin Zexu was critical of the opium trade. He might have encouraged Britain to ban it. So E could be a possibility.

Option F: The British Crown ceded Hong Kong to China. The letter was about the opium trade, not Hong Kong.

Option G: Queen Victoria personally responded to Lin Zexu’s letter with a promise of change. The letter was addressed to Queen Victoria, so her personal response would be after delivery. So G is about a personal response, not a direct outcome of delivery.

Option H: Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West. The letter was about trade issues, not naval actions.

Option I: The British government issued a formal apology and stopped the opium trade. That sounds like the government's response to Lin Zexu's letter. So I could think that's a direct outcome.

Option J: The rise of a strong anti-opium movement in Britain. The letter was about the trade, so it might have inspired a movement.

Now, I need to figure out which of these is actually a direct outcome of the letter being delivered.

The letter's content was about promoting peace and reducing trade, which could have led to diplomatic efforts to prevent the opium trade. So the British government might have responded with an apology and new trade terms, which would be option I.

Alternatively, option E is the British government compensating for the damage, but that's more of a response than an outcome. The delivery itself likely led to a response, so I think option I is the correct answer.

Wait, but the letter was delivered to Queen Victoria. So the delivery is the letter, and the question is what happened as a result. So the delivery itself might have led to the government taking action. So I think the outcome is I: The British government issued a formal apology and stopped the opium trade.
