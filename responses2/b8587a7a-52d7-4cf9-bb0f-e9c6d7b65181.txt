Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Ashford's article. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking which paralysis Ashford's article addresses. The options are A through J, each describing a specific issue. I remember that a paralysis is a difficult or impossible situation, so Ashford must be talking about an impossible problem.

Looking at the options:

A: the daunting task of solving worldwide economic imbalance.
B: the impossibility of meeting everyone's basic needs.
C: having to give up so much of our own wealth in light of Singer's arguments.
D: having to choose between addressing immediate harm and addressing structural injustice.
E: reconciling conflict moral theories.
F: the difficult task of prioritizing multiple global issues.
G: the challenge of implementing sustainable solutions to poverty.
H: the sheer scope of global poverty.
I: the overwhelming responsibility of addressing world hunger.
J: the complexity of addressing environmental issues globally.

I think Ashford's article is about something impossible. Now I need to think about which of these options are about impossibilities. 

Option B talks about the impossibility of meeting everyone's basic needs. That sounds familiar from what I've read before. I recall that Ashford's article, "The Impossible," discusses the challenges of living in a world where basic needs are impossible to meet for all people. So that's a paralysis because it's practically impossible.

Let me think about the other options. Option A is about economic imbalance, which is a problem, but I'm not sure if it's called a paralysis. Option C is about wealth, but Singer's arguments might influence it, not necessarily the issue itself. Option D is about choosing between immediate harm and structural issues, which is more about decision-making than a paralysis. Option E talks about moral theories, which isn't the focus. Option F is about prioritizing issues, which is a problem but not a paralysis. Option G and H are about poverty and sustainabilityâ€”probably not the main issue. Option I is about world hunger, which is a specific problem but not the same as impossibility. Option J is about environmental issues, which is a global problem but not the hardest part.

So the best fit is B: the impossibility of meeting everyone's basic needs. That makes sense since Ashford's article likely explores how such a problem is impossible or extremely difficult to solve.

The correct answer is:

**B: the impossibility of meeting everyone's basic needs.**

The article discusses the challenges of meeting basic needs universally, highlighting the impossibility as a key issue. 

Answer: B
