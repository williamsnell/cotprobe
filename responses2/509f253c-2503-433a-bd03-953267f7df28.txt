Okay, so I have this question about Kim and Eric's bicycle riding. Let me try to figure it out. 

First, the question says Kim rode 135 miles over 9 weeks, and Eric rode 102 miles over 6 weeks. They both rode the same distance each week. I need to compare how many miles per week they rode.

Hmm, so I think I need to find the weekly mileage for each and then compare them. 

Let me start with Kim. She rode 135 miles in 9 weeks. To find out how much she rode each week, I divide 135 by 9. Let me calculate that: 135 รท 9. Oh wait, 9 times 15 is 135, so Kim rode 15 miles each week.

Now Eric: he rode 102 miles in 6 weeks. So his weekly mileage is 102 divided by 6. Let me do that division. 6 goes into 102 how many times? 6*17=102, so Eric rode 17 miles each week.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 6 times 17 is 102, yes. So Eric's per-week mileage is 17 miles. Kim's is 15. 

So now, comparing their weekly miles. Kim rode 15, Eric rode 17. So Eric rode more. How much more? 17 minus 15 is 2 miles. 

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are about who rode more. Let me check the options again. 

Option G says Kim rode 9 more miles per week than Eric. No, Kim only rode 2 more. So that's not right. 

Option E is Eric rode 17 more miles per week than Kim. Wait, no, Kim rode 15 and Eric 17. So Eric has 2 more. So option E is 17 more than Kim, which is opposite. So that's not correct.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read the options again. 

Option E: Eric rode 17 more miles per week than Kim. No, Kim rode 15, Eric 17, so Eric rode 2 more. So E is wrong. 

Option D: Kim rode 5 more than Eric. No, Kim rode 2, Eric 17. So D is wrong.

Option B: Kim rode 5 more than Eric. No.

Options A: Eric 7 more than Kim. No, Kim is 2.

Option C: Kim 3 more. No.

Option H: Kim 11 more. No.

Option I: Kim 15 more. No.

Option J: Eric 2 more than Kim. That's correct. Because Kim rode 15, Eric rode 17, so Eric is 2 more.

Wait, but looking back, option J says "Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim." Yes, that's correct because 17-15=2.

So the correct statement is option J. But wait, wait! Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

Wait, Kim: 135 miles over 9 weeks. 135 divided by 9. Let me calculate 9*15=135, correct.

Eric: 102 over 6 weeks. 6*17=102, correct.

So per week, Kim:15, Eric:17. So Eric has 2 more. So option J is correct.

The correct comparison is that Eric rode 2 more miles per week than Kim. 

Answer: J
