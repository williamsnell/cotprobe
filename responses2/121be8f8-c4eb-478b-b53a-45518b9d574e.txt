Question:

A motorist's negligent driving seriously injured another driver. The motorist was cited for traveling in the wrong lane and paid a fine. The motorist had a policy limit of only $15,000 for third party liability on his insurance policy. After furnishing the motorist's insurer with a full medical report, all medical bills, medical records, and other required proofs of damages, the injured claimant demanded the policy limits. The claimant gave notice that a bad faith claim would be filed if the policy limits were not paid immediately. The insurance company refused payment without explanation. A jury awarded the injured claimant $200,000. The injured claimant obtained a signed assignment from the negligent motorist giving to the claimant any rights that the motorist may have had against his insurer. Will the court likely compel the insurance company to pay the full amount of the jury verdict to injured person under these facts?

Options:

A: The court will not compel the insurance company to pay because the motorist was at fault, not the insurance company.
B: Bad faith is personal to the insured party and his insurer  the assignment was invalid, and the injured person has no claim to compel the insurer to pay.
C: The insurance company is liable to pay the full amount as they failed to act in good faith and fair dealing, regardless of the policy limit.
D: The insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implicit in every insurance contract and must pay the full amount of the judgment.
E: The injured person can only claim up to the policy limit from the insurer, and must seek the remaining amount from the motorist directly.
F: The injured party must enforce his entire judgment against the motorist and may never pursue the insurer for that amount.
G: The insurance company can only be compelled to pay if they were given a reasonable opportunity to settle the claim within the policy limits.
H: The policy limit is $15,000 and that is all that can be collected by the injured person  there is no action for bad faith on an insurance contract.
I: The insurance company can be compelled to pay the full amount only if they were given prior warning about the potential for a bad faith claim.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this torts question. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is a motorist who was negligent and seriously injured another driver. The motorist was cited for traveling in the wrong lane and paid a fine. His insurance policy has a policy limit of only $15,000 for third-party liability. The motorist provided a full medical report and all related documents to the injured claimant. The claimant demanded the policy limits to be paid immediately. The claimant gave notice that a bad faith claim would be filed if the limits weren't paid. The insurance company refused without explanation. The jury awarded the injured $200,000. The claimant got a signed assignment from the motorist, meaning the motorist has rights against the insurer.

The question is whether the court will compel the insurance company to pay the full amount of the judgment, which is $200k. The options are from A to I, with F, G, H, etc.

Let me think about the law. When an insurance company is sued under a policy limit, they're liable if they failed to act in good faith and met the "fair dealing" standard. The "fair dealing" rule compares the business opportunity of the claimant to the actual harm caused to the insured.

In this case, the insured (the injured claimant) received a full medical report and all required documents. The motorist was at fault because the claim was based on a wrong turn. The motorist gave notice that a bad faith claim would be filed if the policy limits weren't paid immediately. This notice suggests that the motorist intended the claim to be bad faith, which could be a red flag for the insurer.

The jury awarded $200k, which is way over the policy limit of $15k. The question is whether the insurance company must pay the full amount because of the bad faith notice.

So, the key here is the "good faith and fair dealing" rule. The insurance company is suing for breach of that covenant. The motorist gave a notice that the claim would be bad faith, which is a red flag. The standard requires that the offerer (insurer) must have a reasonable opportunity to settle if the condition isn't met. If the motorist was at fault and provided a notice of bad faith, the insurer might need to take action.

Looking at the options, option D says the insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and must pay the full amount. Option C says they're liable because they failed to act in good faith. Option A says the motorist was at fault, so the insurance isn't liable. But the question is about the insurance company, so A is probably not the answer.

Option F suggests the injured can only claim against the motorist, which doesn't fit the question since we're looking at whether the insurer must pay.

Option E talks about the policy limit, but the question is about whether the whole judgment must be paid. So E is the opposite of what's being asked.

Option B says the assignment is invalid. That might relate to whether the motorist's rights against the insurer are valid, but I'm not sure how that ties into the policy limit.

Option D seems to cover the breach of the covenant. If the motorist was negligent and gave notice of bad faith, that's a breach, so the insurance company must pay.

Option G talks about whether the policy limit is a barrier. But the policy limit is only a limit if the company failed to act in good faith. The notice is a clear breach, so the policy limit doesn't matter here.

Options C and D: The standard requires that the business opportunity be considered. If the motorist was negligent and could have reasonably expected the claim to be bad faith, then the insurer must act. Here, the motorist was at fault, so the insurer has a duty to act in good faith. The notice is part of that duty.

So if the motorist gave notice that bad faith would be filed, the company must act. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether the insurance company must pay the full $200k jury verdict under the "good faith and fair dealing" standard. The motorist was negligent and gave notice of a potential bad faith claim, indicating a breach of that covenant. The policy limit was $15,000, but the court must consider whether the notice was reasonable and whether the business opportunity outweighed the policy limit. The key here is that the notice constitutes a breach of the implied covenant, necessitating payment of the full judgment.

**Answer: D**
