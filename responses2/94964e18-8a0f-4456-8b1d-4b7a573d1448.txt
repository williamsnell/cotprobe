Okay, I'm trying to figure out the effect of a tax cut of $10 billion on savings, assuming a marginal propensity to consume (MPC) of 0.85. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that MPC is the proportion of additional income that people spend on consumption. So, if someone earns more, 85% of that income goes towards consumption, and 15% is saved. That 15% is the MPC, and the remaining 85% is the marginal propensity to save, which I think is denoted as MPS.

So, if the MPC is 0.85, the MPS must be 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. That means for every additional dollar earned, 15% is saved.

Now, a tax cut of $10 billion is an increase in disposable income. Since saving is a function of disposable income, the tax cut should directly increase savings. So the amount of saving would be 0.15 times the tax cut.

Let me calculate that: 0.15 * 10 billion = 1.5 billion.

Wait, but the question asks whether this change is inflationary or deflationary. A tax cut typically leads to increased consumption and hence higher overall economic activity, which is a positive sign for the economy. But how does that affect inflation?

I think the main factors are the MPC and the size of the tax cut. Since the MPC is 0.85, which is quite high, people are more likely to spend a larger portion of their income, so the effect on saving might be more pronounced. Also, the size of the tax cut is $10 billion, which is a significant amount. 

I remember that when taxes are cut, it leads to an increase in aggregate demand, which can stimulate economic growth. This can lead to higher income and then higher consumption, but it might not necessarily cause inflation. Inflation occurs when there's too much money supply relative to demand, which can happen if the economy is overheating or if there's a significant increase in spending.

However, in this case, the MPC is 0.85, so the multiplier effect might be less than 1, but wait, actually, the multiplier is 1/(1-MPC) = 1/(0.15) â‰ˆ6.67. So a $10 billion tax cut would increase total income by about $66.7 billion. But that's more about the increase in income, not directly about the effect on savings.

Wait, the question is about the effect on savings. So the initial tax cut increases disposable income by $10 billion, which leads to an increase in savings by 15% of that, which is $1.5 billion. So the change in savings is +1.5 billion.

But the question is about whether this is inflationary or deflationary. Since the MPC is 0.85, it's a high MPC but not 1. High MPC suggests that people save more, which can lead to increased income and then more spending. But does that cause inflation?

I think that a high MPC can lead to hyperinflation if the economy is too open to external shocks. But in this case, the tax cut is a policy change, not a shock. So it's more about the short-term effect. The tax cut would lead to increased consumption and saving, which can cause higher demand, but it's not clear if that's leading to inflation or deflation.

Wait, another angle: if the MPC is high enough, the increase in saving might actually cause the economy to expand, which could lead to higher demand and perhaps higher prices, but that's speculative. Alternatively, it might lead to higher income leading to higher consumption, which in turn could raise savings, but I'm not sure how that affects inflation.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the MPC and the tax cut interact leads to a multiplier effect that either increases or decreases the overall economic activity, but this isn't directly about inflation or deflation. Inflation is more about increases in prices, which would happen if demand exceeds supply. If the MPC is high, and the tax cut is a large enough amount, it might increase demand, but I'm not sure if that's inflationary or deflationary.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is specifically about the effect on savings. So the savings increase is directly due to the tax cut, which is $1.5 billion. The answer options are A: $1.5 billion, which seems to match that. But wait, the options include positive and negative values. Since the MPC is 0.85, the MPC is less than 1, so the MPC is 0.85, which is less than 1. The multiplier is 1/(1 - 0.85) = 6.67. So a $10 billion tax cut would lead to a $66.7 billion increase in total spending. But that's about the overall economy, not necessarily inflation or deflation.

Wait another thought: If the MPC is high, like 0.85, people spend most of their income, which can lead to more income and thus more consumption. But the question is about the effect on savings. So the tax cut leads to more savings because 15% is saved.

Wait, the options include positive and negative numbers. The way the question is phrased, it's asking what is the effect on savings, not the overall economy. So the answer should be the change in savings, which is +1.5 billion. Looking at the options, F is 0.15, which is 15%, but the question is about the amount, not the percentage. So the change in savings is $1.5 billion, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are A: $1.5 billion, which is exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the effect on savings of a $10 billion tax cut, we start by calculating the marginal propensity to save (MPS). Given that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.85, the MPS is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. This means 15% of the additional disposable income is saved.

A $10 billion tax cut increases disposable income by $10 billion, leading to a $10 billion * 0.15 = $1.5 billion increase in savings.

The question asks whether this change is inflationary or deflationary. A tax cut typically increases disposable income and, assuming the MPC is high but not 1, leads to increased spending and overall economic activity. However, the question focuses on the change in savings, not the overall economic impact. Therefore, the effect on savings is a $1.5 billion increase.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is **A: $1.5 billion**.
