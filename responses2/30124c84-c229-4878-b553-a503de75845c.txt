Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about average speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. The question says a car travels three segments of equal distance, each 20 miles. The speeds are 30 mph, 40 mph, and 50 mph for each segment respectively. I need to find the average speed for the entire trip. 

Right, average speed is total distance divided by total time. I remember that each segment has the same distance, but different speeds. So I can't just average the speeds—each segment takes a different amount of time, and I have to calculate the time for each part.

Let me jot down the details. Each segment is 20 miles. So there are three segments in total. I'll calculate the time taken for each segment by dividing the distance by the speed for that segment.

First segment: 20 miles at 30 mph. Time = distance/speed, so 20/30 hours. Let me compute that. 20 divided by 30 is 2/3 hours, which is approximately 0.6667 hours.

Second segment: 20 miles at 40 mph. Time is 20/40, which is 0.5 hours. That's 30 minutes.

Third segment: 20 miles at 50 mph. Time is 20/50, which is 0.4 hours. That's 24 minutes approximately.

Now, I need to add up all these times to get the total time. Let's add them up: 0.6667 + 0.5 + 0.4. Let me compute that. 0.6667 plus 0.5 is 1.1667, and plus 0.4 makes 1.5667 hours total.

The total distance is 20 + 20 + 20, which equals 60 miles. So average speed is total distance (60 miles) divided by total time (1.5667 hours).

Calculating that: 60 / 1.5667. Hmm, let me do this division. 1.5667 times 38 is approximately 60, because 1.5667 * 38 = 60.0006. So it's about 38.2 mph.

Looking at the options, option I is 38.2 mph. So the answer should be I.

To determine the average speed for the trip, use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.

1. Calculate time for each segment:
   - First segment: 20 miles / 30 mph = 2/3 hours ≈ 0.6667 hours.
   - Second segment: 20 miles / 40 mph = 0.5 hours.
   - Third segment: 20 miles / 50 mph = 0.4 hours.

2. Sum the times: 0.6667 + 0.5 + 0.4 = 1.5667 hours.

3. Total distance: 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 miles.

4. Average speed: 60 / 1.5667 ≈ 38.2 mph.

The correct answer is **I: 38.2 mph**.
