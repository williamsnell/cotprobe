Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about open systems models in public relations, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll try to remember what I know about open systems models in public relations. From what I recall, an open systems model allows for more transparency and communication between the organization and its publics. It's different from closed systems, which are more controlled and less transparent.

Looking at the options:

Option A: It discourages feedback from its publics. Wait, no. Open systems model should encourage more feedback because it's open, right? So A is probably not correct.

Option B: It aims at maintaining a static organizational environment. Hmm. Open systems could help in a more dynamic environment, but does it maintain a static one? I think it's more flexible. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C: It supports non-transparency and secrecy for organizational success. Wait, why would an open model support non-transparency? Open models are supposed to be transparent, so this seems contradictory. So C is probably false.

Option D: It emphasizes on controlling the public perception rather than adapting to it. No, I think the opposite. Open systems allow for more adaptability because they're transparent and can be adjusted more easily. So D doesn't sound right.

Option E: It adapts to changing organizational environments. That sounds familiar. Open systems models are designed to be flexible and responsive to changes because they're open, so this seems correct.

Option F: It promotes a one-way communication from the organization to its publics. Wait, open systems should have two-way communication, right? So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: It encourages the organization to work in isolation. No, that's the opposite of open systems. Open systems allow for collaboration and work together, so G is not right.

Option H: It focuses on removing communication barriers between its business divisions. Hmm, that sounds a bit like a closed model. Open systems allow for more communication, so H might not be accurate.

Wait, let me double-check. Open systems are more transparent, allowing for real-time communication and adjustments. They enable collaboration and adaptability, which are the traits of option E. So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E. Open systems models in public relations are designed to adapt to changing organizational environments by allowing real-time communication and flexibility, which means they are responsive to change and encourage collaboration.
