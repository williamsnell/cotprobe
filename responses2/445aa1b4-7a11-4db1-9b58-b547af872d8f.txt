Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about vitamin and mineral deficiencies in older people, and I need to figure out which option isn't a reason for increased risk. Let's break it down.

The question is asking which option is NOT a reason for higher risk. The options are A, B, C, D, and the answer should be one of these in the form of the letter.

First, I remember that vitamin and mineral deficiencies are often linked to aging. As people age, their bodies have less time to process nutrients properly. So, I think the key factors here are related to their health status and lifestyle.

Option A says low income leads to decreased ability to buy nutrient-rich foods. I know that in low-income countries, people might not have the funds to buy fresh foods, leading them to eat less. This could contribute to poor nutrition and deficiencies. So A is a reason, making it not the correct answer.

Option B: Decreased mobility and little time outdoors in the sun. I remember that older people are generally less mobile, so they might spend less time outdoors. Less exposure to sunlight means less rays of UV light, which can be harmful to vitamin D and minerals like calcium and iron. So B is a reason, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Decreased intrinsic factor in the stomach. Wait, the intrinsic factor is a part of the body's immune system. If it's decreased, the body can't fight infections well, but how does that affect vitamins or minerals? I'm not sure. I think intrinsic factor primarily affects the immune response to infections, not directly to nutrients. So this might not be a major reason for deficiencies.

Option D: High nutrient requirements for tissue turnover. I remember reading that older adults have higher needs for nutrients because their bodies are using them faster. They might not have as much time to maintain their levels, leading to deficiencies. So D is a reason, making it not the correct answer.

So putting it together: A, B, D are all reasons for increased risk. C is the one that's not a reason because it's about the immune system, not directly about nutrient intake.

The correct answer is **C**. Decreased intrinsic factor in the stomach does not directly contribute to increased risk of vitamin or mineral deficiencies. 

Answer: C
