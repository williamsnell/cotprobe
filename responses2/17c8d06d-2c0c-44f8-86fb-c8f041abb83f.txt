Question:

On November 1, Beeson contracted to purchase from Sloan for $250,000 certain property located in the City of La Mirada. In the contract of sale, Beeson and Sloan agreed that the property was to be used for the purpose of building a commercial shopping mall. The contract required Beeson to pay Sloan a deposit of $12,500, with the balance of the purchase price payable at closing a month later on December 1. On November 24, the city council rezoned the property so that it could be used only for single-family residential purposes. As a consequence, Beeson refused to honor the contract. Sloan now brings an action for specific performance arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer. Beeson argues that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because

Options:

A: legal title remained in Sloan.
B: The property's value decreased substantially due to the rezoning.
C: Sloan failed to disclose potential rezoning risks.
D: Beeson had not yet paid the full purchase price.
E: The contract was not legally binding.
F: Sloan assumed the risk.
G: equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.
H: Sloan would be unjustly enriched.
I: The city council's decision was unforeseeable.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, Beeson contracted to purchase a property from Sloan for $250,000. The property is supposed to be used for a commercial shopping mall. The contract requires Beeson to pay a deposit of $12,500, and the rest is due a month later on December 1. But then, on November 24, the city council reznoned the property, making it suitable for single-family residential. Beeson decided not to honor the contract because of this, and Sloan is suing for specific performance.

The question is about why Beeson would win the suit. The options are A to I. I'm trying to recall how contracts and equitable conversion work.

First, the contract was for a commercial mall, but the property was later used for single-family residential. The city council's decision affects Beeson's contract. So, when the property is used for a different purpose, the contract might be deemed invalid or subject to conversion.

I remember that when a contract is for a specific use, but the property becomes suitable for a different use, either the usage is still valid, or the contract is converted to a new one. Equitable conversion is a doctrine where the contract is modified to fit the new situation, and the party responsible for the old use can recover damages.

In this case, Beeson is suing for specific performance, which is about fulfilling the contract in full, not just meeting the conditions. However, if the contract is converted, maybe the answer lies in the doctrine of equitable conversion.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Legal title remained in Sloan. Probably not, because the property was used for a different purpose, which should affect the contract's validity.

Option B: Property's value decreased. But the contract's terms are about the purchase price, not the property's value. So, the value could change, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option C: Sloan didn't disclose the risk. The reznoning was a public decision, so if Sloan didn't inform Beeson, Beeson might have a claim based on lack of notice. That's a point towards the equitable conversion doctrine.

Option D: Beeson hasn't paid the full price yet. The deposit is $12,500, so he has to pay another $237,500 by Dec 1. If he hasn't, but the reznoning is a public decision, maybe the court is looking at whether he's bound to pay.

Option E: The decision was unforeseen. I'm not sure if that's the case here. The reznoning was on November 24, which is the day the contract was signed. So it's a timely decision.

Option F: Sloan assumed the risk. That doesn't make sense because the reznoning was a city decision, not Sloan's. Sloan is likely to be at fault because they didn't act in their own interest.

Option G: Equity relieves Beeson. That's about the contract being converted. If the contract is converted, equity would help Beeson if he doesn't pay.

Option H: Sloan is unjustly enriched. That doesn't seem right because Sloan is suing for specific performance, which might involve recovery of damages if the contract was converted.

Option I: The decision was unforeseeable. The decision was on November 24, same day the contract was signed. So it's a timely decision, so I think it's not E.

So, the key here is whether the contract was valid after the property was reznoned. If the property can be used for a different purpose, the contract may be converted, and the party with the old use can get damages.

Beeson is suing for specific performance because he didn't pay the full price. The court would need to decide whether the contract was valid after the rezoning. If the contract was converted, then the court would look to see if Beeson is liable based on the conversion doctrine.

Looking back, the options: C and G are about the issue of conversion. C is about Sloan not discarding the risk, G about equity relief.

In cases where a contract is for a certain purpose but the property is used differently, the contract may be deemed invalid, or be converted, and the original owner can recover.

In this scenario, since the reznoning is a public decision, the court might realize that the contract's validity was in question. If the contract is now for a different purpose, but the original contract was for commercial, that might be equitably convertible. So Beeson could sue under equitable conversion.

So, the reason Beeson would win is probably because the reznoning changes the contract's purpose, so it's converted. So the court would apply equitable conversion, and Beeson could get the loss, which is the value of the contract.

Looking at the options, option C is about Sloan not disclosing the risk. But if the contract was converted, perhaps the court would let Beeson recover the difference. Alternatively, option G is about equity relieving Beeson. Equity would help him if the contract is converted.

Wait, the options are:

C: Sloan failed to disclose potential risks. So, not providing notice could be a factor. If Sloan didn't disclose, Beeson's right to recovery is affected.

G: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain. So, if the contract is converted, the bad contract (previously) is covered by equity.

In the scenario, since the property is now for single-family, the contract is converted. If so, Beeson's loss is the difference between the original contract and the new one.

So, the court would likely apply the equitable conversion doctrine, and if the contract is converted, Beeson's loss comes from the value of the contract. So, the question is whether the court would let Beeson sue for that.

Looking at the options, if the court applies equitable conversion, G would be correct. 

Alternatively, if the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, it might find that Beeson is liable for the loss, which is the value of the contract.

Wait, but in this case, the contract was for commercial, but the property was used for residential. So, the contract might be deemed invalid or converted.

If the contract is converted, then the loss is the difference. So, the court might allow Beeson to sue for that.

So, the options are about why Beeson wins. If the court applies equitable conversion, G would be correct. If the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid and holds Beeson liable, then perhaps the loss is the amount Beeson hasn't paid, which is $237,500.

Alternatively, if the contract is valid as is, but the use is now single-family, perhaps Beeson is liable for the loss.

But I think the more likely scenario is that the contract is modified, so G would be correct.

Wait, another angle: If the contract is for a commercial mall but the property is now for single-family, the contract is for a different purpose. In some jurisdictions, this can be a case for equitable conversion. If the contract is converted, Beeson's loss is the value of the contract, which is part of the $250,000.

So, the correct option would be G: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.

Alternatively, if the court decides that the contract is invalid because the property is no longer suitable for the original use, the court might find that Beeson is legally responsible.

Wait, but the problem says that the contract requires Beeson to pay a deposit of $12,500, with the balance due a month later.

Under normal contract law, the contract is for a commercial use but the property is now for residential. So, the contract would need to be equitable converted. If that's the case, the contract's validity is questionable, so Beeson might have a claim for the loss.

So, the correct answer would be G: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain. But wait, I'm a bit confused because equity usually relates to the contract's validity.

Alternatively, perhaps the court would find that the contract is invalid because it's for a different purpose, so Beeson can sue for the loss.

Wait, the answer options: The question is why Beeson will win. He is suing for specific performance, which is more about recovery of money due to failure to fulfill a contract.

If the contract is converted, then the court might let Beeson recover the difference between the original contract and the new one. So, the loss would be $12,500 (the deposit) plus the remainder.

Wait, the deposit is $12,500. The total purchase price is $250,000. So if the property is now for single-family, the contract might be for a different purpose. So, the contract's validity is questionable, and the contract might be equitable convertible.

If the contract is converted, the party who had the original use (Beeson) can recover the loss. The value of the contract is the amount Beeson hasn't paid yet, which is $237,500.

Wait, but the options don't have an option about the contract being converted and Beeson getting the loss. So, the options are about the reason for Beeson's win.

Hmm. So, looking back at the options:

Option C: Sloan didn't disclose the risk.

Option G: Equity will relieve Beeson.

So, which is the answer? Let me think. The reznoning was a public decision. If the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, and holds Beeson responsible, he can sue for the lack of payment.

But the question is about which reason would make Beeson win.

Wait, another angle: Some jurisdictions allow the buyer to sue for the loss if the contract is equitable convertible. Because the contract is for a commercial use, but the property is now for single-family. So, the contract is converted.

In that case, the court would let Beeson recover the loss, which is the difference between the original contract and the new one.

So the loss is $12,500 (the deposit) plus the remaining $237,500. So, the total loss is $250,000. But that's the entire amount, so perhaps the equity would cover the entire loss.

Wait, but in the options, only G says equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain. So, perhaps the answer is G.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the court would find that the contract is invalid, so Beeson is responsible for the loss, which is the deposit plus the balance. So, the option that reflects that would be the reason for his win.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is likely based on the conversion of the contract and the recovery of the loss.

Wait, the options include G: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain. So, if the contract is converted, then the buyer's loss is covered by equity.

Alternatively, if the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, the loss is the full amount, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C: Sloan failed to disclose the risk.

Because if the contract is recognized as equitable convertable, then the buyer's loss is the value of the contract, which is the deposit plus the balance, i.e., $250,000.

But the options don't have an option that says "Beeson is liable for the entire purchase price." Hmm.

Wait, looking back, the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the court applies equitable conversion, and Beeson is liable for the loss, which is the difference between the original contract and the new one.

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the contract was converted, and thus, the loss is covered by equity (G).

Alternatively, if the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, then Beeson is responsible for the entire amount, but the option doesn't reflect that.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: Sloan failed to disclose potential risks.

If the property is now suitable for single-family, perhaps the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, so the buyer can sue for the loss. This might be because the seller didn't notice the change, so Beeson can recover the loss.

So, perhaps the court decides that the contract is invalid, and Beeson is responsible for the entire $250,000.

But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, so Beeson can sue for the loss.

Wait, but the question is why Beeson wins: because the court applies equitable conversion, so G.

Alternatively, if the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, then Beeson is liable for the entire amount, but that's not an option.

Wait, but the only option that relates to the contract being converted is C and G. So, which is the correct reasoning for Beeson's win.

If the contract is converted, then the buyer is liable for the loss. The loss is the difference between the original contract and the new one. So, the amount is $12,500 (deposit) + $237,500 (balance) = $250,000. So, if the court allows that, then the reason Beeson wins is that the contract was converted.

But the options don't have an option saying that. The options are about the reason for Beeson's win.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the contract was converted, and the only reason Beeson wins is because of the conversion (G). Or perhaps because the seller didn't disclose the risks (C). I'm a bit stuck.

Another angle: The contract was for commercial, but the property is now for residential. The city council's decision is a public decision. Under some jurisdictions, this can affect the contract's validity.

In such cases, the court might find that the contract is inequitable because the property is no longer suitable. If that's the case, Beeson could sue for the loss. However, if the court holds the contract valid, the loss is the deposit plus the balance.

But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer relates to the court's decision on the contract's validity, which would rely on whether the property can be used for the original purpose.

Wait, but the question is about why Beeson wins. If the court applies equitable conversion, then G would be correct. If the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, Beeson loses because he didn't pay, which is another option, but that's not listed.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct answer is likely G: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.

Because if the contract is converted, the buyer's loss is covered by the equity. So, the court would allow Beeson to recover the loss.

Alternatively, if the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, Beeson could be liable for the lack of payment, but the options don't have that.

Wait, but the options are:

A: legal title remains in Sloan.

B: property's value decreases.

C: Sloan didn't disclose risk.

D: Beeson hasn't paid.

E: decision was unforeseen.

F: Sloan assumes risk.

G: equity relieves.

H: Sloan unjustly enriched.

I: decision was unforeseen.

E was the day they signed, so it's a timely decision.

So, the court would likely find that the contract is inequitable because the property can't be used for the original purpose. So, the court might hold the contract invalid and allow Beeson to sue for the loss.

In that case, G would be correct.

Alternatively, if the court finds the contract valid, but the use has changed, Beeson might have to pay the full amount, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, if the contract is recognized as valid, but the use changed, the contract is converted, and the buyer is liable for the difference between original and new contract terms. But that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: The contract was for commercial, but the property is now for residential. So, the contract is for a different use. In some jurisdictions, this can be considered equitable conversion. Beeson could then sue for the loss.

So, the reason Beeson wins is G: equity will relieve him of a bad bargain.

Alternatively, if the court doesn't recognize the contract as valid, the loss is the entire amount, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, but the question says that the city council did rezone, but the contract is for commercial. So, perhaps the contract was for a different use, thus the court would find it inequitable and Beeson can sue for the loss.

In that case, the correct answer is G: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.
</think>

The question revolves around whether Beeson can recover specific performance under a contract that was initially for a commercial property but was later reznoned for single-family residential use. The key issue lies in the contract's validity and its conversion status.

Upon signing the contract, Beeson paid a deposit and the balance was due a month later. However, the property was later deemed unsuitable for the original use, leading the city council to reznoned it for residential purposes. This reznoning affected the contract's validity. Under equitable conversion doctrine, if the property can no longer be used for the original purpose, the contract is modified to fit the new circumstances. This allows the original buyer (Beeson) to recover the loss, which is the difference between the original contract terms and the new, revised terms.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Legal title remaining in Sloan is unlikely because the reznoning was timely and not a legal issue.
- **B**: Property's value decreasing is irrelevant since the contract's value is tied to the purchase price, not the property's value.
- **C**: Sloan failing to disclose risks is a potential issue, but the court's decision to modify the contract is more plausible.
- **D**: Beeson not having paid the full price is not the main issue here.
- **E**: Decision being unforeseen is unlikely since the reznoning was timely.
- **F**: Sloan assuming the risk is incorrect because Sloan was not at fault for the reznoning.
- **G**: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain is the correct reasoning. If the contract is equitable convertible, Beeson can recover the loss, which is the difference between the original and revised contract terms.
- **H**: Sloan unjustly enriched is incorrect because Sloan was at fault for the reznoning.
- **I**: The decision was unforeseeable is incorrect since the decision was timely.

The most plausible reasoning is **G**, as the equitable conversion doctrine allows Beeson to recover the loss due to the contract's modification after the reznoning.
