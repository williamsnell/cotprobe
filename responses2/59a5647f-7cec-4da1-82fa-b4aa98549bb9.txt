Okay, so I've got this problem here about MaxFlaumhad a note for $2400. He discounted it 30 days before it was due, and the bank paid him $2389. I need to find the discount rate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me understand what a discounted note is. When a note is discounted, the bank deducts a certain amount from the face value, and that discount is essentially the interest. The discount rate is the rate at which this discount is calculated.

The problem gives me the face value as $2400, the amount paid as $2389, and the time period as 30 days. I think I need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount would be the difference between the face value and what was paid. So, discount = $2400 - $2389 = $11.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. The bank pays the discount, so the amount paid is the face value minus the discount. So, the discount is $2400 - $2389 = $11. That makes sense. So, $11 is the discount.

Now, the question is asking for the discount rate. The discount rate is usually calculated as (discount / face value) * (360 / days). I remember that the bank uses 360 days for these calculations, not 365. So, that's a key point.

So, let me plug in the numbers. Discount rate = (11 / 2400) * (360 / 30). Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 360 divided by 30 is 12. So, 11 divided by 2400 is... let's see, 11 divided by 2400 equals approximately 0.00458333... So, that's about 0.458333%.

Then, multiplying that by 12 gives 0.00458333 * 12 ≈ 0.05499996, or approximately 5.5%.

Looking at the options, that's option F: 5(1/2)%, which is 5.5%. So, that should be the discount rate.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I got the formula reversed. Sometimes, people calculate it as (discount × 360) / (face value × days). Let me try that way.

Discount is $11, so 11 * 360 = 3960. Face value is 2400, days is 30. So, 2400 * 30 is 72000. So, 3960 / 72000 = 0.055, which is also 5.5%. Yep, same result.

So, the discount rate is 5.5%, which is option F. I think that's the correct answer.

The discount rate is calculated by dividing the discount amount by the face value and then adjusting for the time period using the 360-day basis. The discount is $11, so (11 / 2400) * (360 / 30) = 5.5%. 

Answer: F
