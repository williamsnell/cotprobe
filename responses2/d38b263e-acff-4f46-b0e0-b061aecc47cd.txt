Okay, so I've got this matrix multiplication question here. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step. The question says: Matrix A is 2x7 and matrix B is 7x5. They're asking what the dimensions of the product matrix AB are.

Hmm, I remember that when you multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix. That makes sense because each element in the resulting matrix is formed by the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second. So, for matrix A (which is 2x7) and matrix B (7x5), the multiplication should be possible since the number of columns in A (7) equals the number of rows in B (7). 

So the resulting matrix AB should have dimensions equal to the number of rows of A and the number of columns of B. That would be 2 rows (from A) and 5 columns (from B). Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, 2 rows by 5 columns? Or is it 2 rows by 7 columns? Wait no, no, no. Let me clarify. 

Matrix A has 2 rows and 7 columns. Matrix B has 7 rows and 5 columns. When you multiply them, the resulting matrix will have the same number of rows as A and the same number of columns as B. So it's 2 rows and 5 columns. So the dimensions would be 2x5.

Wait, but let's double-check. The first matrix has 2 rows and 7 columns. The second has 7 rows and 5 columns. The multiplication works because the inner dimensions match. So each element in AB is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements from the rows of A and the columns of B. So the resulting matrix will have 2 rows (from A) and 5 columns (from B). So the dimensions are 2x5.

Looking at the options, option F is 2x5, so that's the correct answer.

The dimensions of matrix A are 2 × 7 and matrix B are 7 × 5. When multiplying A and B, the resulting matrix AB will have dimensions equal to the number of rows of A and the number of columns of B. Therefore, AB is 2 × 5.

Answer: F
