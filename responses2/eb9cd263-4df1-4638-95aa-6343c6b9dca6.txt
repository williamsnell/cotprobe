Question:

After reviewing the end-user computing (EUC) policy of an organization, an internal auditor audits the actuarial function and notices that some minimum control requirements are missing. Which of the following is a risk of using potentially incorrect enduser developed files?

Options:

A: Inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning.
B: Management continues to incur additional cost because it takes more hours to do the tasks using EUC.
C: EUC systems are not compatible with other systems in the organization.
D: Management has to dedicate more resources to maintain EUC systems.
E: Management receives limited information for decision making due to a lack of flexibility in EUC files.
F: EUC files become obsolete quickly, requiring frequent updates.
G: Management experiences difficulty in tracking changes made to files in EUC systems.
H: Management is unable to respond to competitive pressures quickly.
I: Management places the same degree of reliance on the files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems.
J: EUC files lack proper security measures, risking unauthorized access.

Okay, so I have this question about end-user computing (EUC) policies and their risks. Hmm, I remember that EUC stands for end-user control requirements, which are guidelines that organizations must follow to ensure that data is handled securely by their end-users. These policies are usually created by internal auditors to make sure that users have the necessary access to their data.

The question says that an internal auditor checked the EUC policy and found that some minimum control requirements are missing. So, the problem is that the EUC doesn't have certain things, which might cause issues.

The question is about the risks of using potentially incorrect EUC files. So the options are A through J, each suggesting a different risk.

Let me go through each option. 

Option A: Inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning. I think accurate EUC files are crucial because they define what users can and can't do with their data. If the files are wrong, strategic planning might be flawed. So this sounds like a possible risk.

Option B: Management continues to incur additional cost because it takes more hours to do the tasks using EUC. Wait, if the EUC is supposed to be efficient, why would it take more time? Maybe the audit found some missing requirements, so the EUC is less efficient. If EUC isn't as efficient, maybe it's more costly in terms of time or resources. But wait, the question says the EUC has missing requirements, not that it's incomplete. So this seems like the opposite of what the issue is. The EUC is missing, meaning it's incomplete, not that it's more efficient. So this might not be a risk of using incorrect EUC files because the issue is the lack of requirements, not inefficiency.

Option C: EUC systems are not compatible with other systems in the organization. If the EUC is incompatible, that could cause problems when integrating with other systems. But the question is about using EUC files, not about compatibility. So this might be a separate risk, but I'm not sure if it's the main issue here.

Option D: Management has to dedicate more resources to maintain EUC systems. If the EUC is incorrect, maybe it's harder to manage. Maybe the system isn't as secure or functional, so maintenance might require more time or effort. That could be a risk. So this is possible.

Option E: Management receives limited information for decision making due to a lack of flexibility in EUC files. If the EUC isn't flexible, users have less control, so decisions might not be as informed. This could lead to poor decisions and increased costs. So this is a possible risk.

Option F: EUC files become obsolete quickly, requiring frequent updates. If the EUC is outdated, maybe it's not updated often. This could lead to outdated information, which in turn might require more updates, increasing costs. So this is a possible risk.

Option G: Management experiences difficulty in tracking changes made to files in EUC systems. If the EUC is incorrect, maybe it's hard to track changes because the controls aren't in place. This could lead to data loss or security breaches. So this is a possible risk.

Option H: Management is unable to respond to competitive pressures quickly. If the EUC is too restrictive, users might not be able to access certain data, so responding to changes or new threats could be harder. So this is a risk.

Option I: Management places the same degree of reliance on the files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems. Mainframe systems have been around longer, so they're more established. If EUC files are too rigid, they might not meet the same level of security or flexibility as mainframe systems, leading to decreased reliance. So this is a risk.

Option J: EUC files lack proper security measures, risking unauthorized access. This is a direct risk because if EUC files are incorrect, they might not have proper security features, leading to unauthorized access. So this is a possible risk.

So the question is asking which is a risk of using potentially incorrect EUC files. The issue is that the EUC is incomplete.

Looking at the options, so if the EUC is wrong, the system might be more vulnerable, harder to manage, less secure, etc.

Option A suggests that inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning. That makes sense because if the controls aren't defined correctly, the strategic planning would be wrong.

Option G suggests difficulty in tracking changes, which would happen if the controls are incomplete. So G is a possible risk.

Option D: More maintenance. If the EUC isn't working as intended, maintenance could be more time-consuming.

Option B says more cost because it takes more time. But I think the issue is the missing requirements, not inefficiency. So B might not be the right answer.

So the possible answers are A, G, D, J, E, F, H, I, or H?

Wait, the question is about the risk of using potentially incorrect EUC files. The issue is that the EUC is missing some requirements, so the controls are incomplete.

Option A: Inaccurate files lead to flawed strategic planning. That seems correct because if the controls are wrong, strategic planning would be flawed.

Option G: Management has difficulty tracking changes. Because the EUC is incomplete, it's harder to track changes, so management can't manage it as they usually do. So that's a risk.

Option D: More resources for maintenance. If the EUC isn't functioning, maybe it's more difficult to maintain, so D is a risk.

Option J: Same level of reliance. If the EUC is too restrictive, users might not be able to access data, leading to decreased reliance. So J is a possible risk.

So the correct answers would be among A, G, D, J, E, F, H, I, etc.

Wait, the question is about using potentially incorrect EUC files. The issue is that the EUC is missing some requirements.

So the options are about the consequences of incorrect EUCs.

Option A: Inaccurate files lead to flawed strategic planning. That's correct.

Option G: Management can't track changes. Correct.

Option D: More resources for maintenance. Correct.

Option J: Less reliance, worse for management. Correct.

So the question is about the 'risk of using potentially incorrect EUC files'. So all these options are possible risks. But the question is which is a risk, and the correct options would be the ones that are direct consequences.

Wait, the question is phrased as 'the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen'. So the answer should be one letter.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice question, and the options are A-J, each with a letter. So the user is to choose one letter as the answer.

Wait, the question is: Which of the following is a risk of using potentially incorrect EUC files? So the answer is one of the options from A to J.

Each option is a possible risk. The question is which is a risk, and the options are the possible choices.

But the user is to select the answer, and the answer should be one letter (A to J).

Wait, no, actually, the question is in the form of a multiple-choice question, where the options are letters A-J, and the user must select one letter as the answer.

Wait, no: the way the question is written, it's a single-choice question where the options are the letters, and the user is to pick which one is the correct answer.

Wait, wait, the actual question is: "Which of the following is a risk of using potentially incorrect enduser developed files?" and the options are A to J, each with a letter.

Wait, no, looking back, the user input is: the options are A to J, each as a separate option, and the user is to select the correct letter (A-J).

But the user's instruction says that the answer should be one letter (A to J), and the last character of the response must be the letter. So the user should select the correct letter as the answer.

So, the question is about identifying which of the given options is a risk. The answer is one letter (A-J) as the correct choice.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following is a risk", and the options are A-J, each with a letter. So the correct answer is one letter, and the user has to choose that.

But wait, the way the question is presented, it's a multiple-choice question, so the answer is one of the options.

Wait, no, the question is: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the user must select the correct answer, and the response ends with the letter.

Wait, for example, if the answer is option A, the response would be, say, "A".

But in the given question, the options are A-J, each being a separate choice.

So, the user should select one letter from A to J as the answer.

So the question is, which of the following is a risk (i.e., which one is correct), and the options are provided as A-J.

Wait, but the user is to write the answer as a letter (A-J), and the response should end with that letter. So the correct answer is the letter that is correct.

So, in the multiple-choice question, the correct letter is to be chosen as the answer.

So the correct answer is the letter corresponding to the correct risk.

So I need to find which of the options A-J is a correct risk.

Now, going back, the options are about risks of using potentially incorrect EUC files.

So, the correct answer would be one of the letters A to J. But looking at the options, the letters are A to J.

So, the question is, which of the following is a risk. So all the options are possible answers, each with a letter.

Wait, no. The options are A to J, each being a possible correct answer, but the correct letter is to be selected.

So the question is, which of the following (A-J) is a risk.

So the correct letter is the correct answer.

So, for example, if option A is correct, the answer is A.

So, the correct answer is one of the options A to J.

Wait, but in the question, the user is to select which letter (A to J) is the correct answer. So the correct letter is the option that is correct.

So the answer is the letter corresponding to the correct risk.

So, for example, if the correct risk is option D, the answer is D.

But I need to find which option (A to J) is correct.

So let's think again.

The question is: Which of the following is a risk of using potentially incorrect EUC files?

The options are A-J, each a possible answer.

So, we need to determine which letter is correct.

The correct option is the one that correctly identifies a risk associated with incorrect EUC files.

So, for example, option G: Management experiences difficulty in tracking changes made to files in EUC systems. That makes sense because if EUC isn't working as intended, tracking changes is harder. So G is a correct risk.

Option D: Management has to dedicate more resources to maintain EUC systems. Correct, because if the EUC isn't functioning, maintenance might require more time.

Option J: Management places the same degree of reliance on the files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems. If EUC is too restrictive, users might not have the same level of control, leading to decreased reliance. So J is a correct risk.

Option A: Inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning. Correct.

Option F: EUC files become obsolete quickly, requiring frequent updates. If EUC is outdated, they may not be updated, leading to outdated information. So F is a correct risk.

Option H: Management is unable to respond to competitive pressures quickly. If EUC is too restrictive, users can't access necessary data, so managing changes becomes harder. So H is a correct risk.

Option E: Management receives limited information for decision making due to a lack of flexibility in EUC files. If EUC is restrictive, users can't make changes as easily, so info is limited. So E is a correct risk.

Option C: EUC systems are not compatible with other systems. But the question is about EUC files, not their compatibility with others. So C might not be the correct risk.

Wait, the question is about EUC files, so C is about compatibility with other systems, which is a separate issue, not the EUC files themselves.

So, the correct options are A, E, F, H, J, and others.

Wait, but the question is asking which is a risk as a consequence of incorrect EUC files.

So, each of the options A to J is a possible risk. So the correct letter is the one that's correct.

But in this scenario, the options are all the possible incorrect EUC files. So the user is to select one correct letter.

But the options are A-J, each a different possible answer. So the correct letter is the one that is a correct risk.

So, for example, if the correct risk is option G, then the answer is G.

But the problem is that the question is presented as a multiple-choice question where the user must select one letter as the answer.

In the given scenario, the user is to choose which letter (A to J) is the correct answer.

So, the correct answer is the letter corresponding to the correct risk.

So, the question is, which of the options (A-J) is a correct risk.

So, for each option, I can assess whether it is a correct risk.

But I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

The question is about which of the following is a risk of using potentially incorrect EUC files. So, the correct answer is the letter that is correct.

Looking at the options, all are possible, but the correct one is the one that is a consequence.

So, for the purpose of this exercise, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The issue is that the EUC has missing requirements, leading to incorrect files. So the risks would be:

A: Incorrect files lead to flawed strategic planning. Correct.

G: Tracking changes is difficult. Correct.

D: More maintenance needed. Correct.

J: Same level of reliance. Correct.

E: Limited info. Correct.

F: EUC files become obsolete quickly. Correct.

H: Management can't respond quickly. Correct.

So all these are correct risks.

But the question asks which is one of the possible correct answers. So, perhaps the question is looking for the most likely correct answer, but without more context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of each option again.

Option A: Inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning. Yes, this makes sense because if the controls are wrong, the strategic planning is flawed.

Option E: Limited information for decision making. That makes sense because if EUC is too restrictive, users can't change data, so decisions are less informed.

Option F: EUC files become obsolete quickly. If EUC is outdated, it might require frequent updates. So this is a possible risk.

Option G: Difficulty in tracking changes. If EUC is incomplete, users can't track changes, leading to problems.

Option J: Same degree of reliance. If EUC is too restrictive, users might not need it as much, leading to decreased reliance.

So all these options are correct risks.

But the question is, which of the following is a risk? So any of these could be the correct answer.

But the user is supposed to choose one letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A because it's about strategic planning, which is a key area for EUC users. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, as it's about managing more resources.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

Which of the following is a risk: incorrect EUC files.

So, the correct answer is any one of these, but the options are about which is a risk.

So, for example, option A is a correct risk, option G is correct, etc.

But the question is, which one is the correct answer.

But in the given options, perhaps the correct letter is A, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but the question is asking for which option is a risk, and the possible answers are the letters. So the answer is the correct letter, which is one of A to J.

So, for example, if option A is correct, the answer is A.

But without knowing all the details, I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the correct answer is option A. Because incorrect EUC files can lead to flawed strategic planning, which is a major area. So, I'll go with A as the correct answer.
</think>

The question involves identifying a risk associated with using potentially incorrect end-user computed (EUC) controls. The issue is that the EUC policy is missing some requirements, leading to incorrect EUC files. The correct answer is the risk that aligns with the consequences of such an issue.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning. This is correct because incorrect EUC files can improperly guide strategic planning.
- **Option B**: Management incurs additional costs due to missing requirements. This is not a risk because the issue is the missing requirements themselves, not inefficiency.
- **Option C**: EUC systems are incompatible with other systems. This is a separate issue and not directly related to the incorrect EUC files themselves.
- **Option D**: More resources are needed for maintenance. This is correct, as incorrect EUC files may hinder maintenance.
- **Option E**: Limited information for decision-making. This is correct because incorrect EUC files may restrict access to necessary data.
- **Option F**: EUC files become obsolete quickly. This is correct if the EUC is outdated.
- **Option G**: Difficulty in tracking changes. This is correct because incorrect EUC files may prevent change tracking.
- **Option H**: Management can't respond quickly to changes. This is correct if the EUC is restrictive.
- **Option I**: Management can't respond to competitive pressures. This is correct if the EUC is too restrictive.
- **Option J**: Management can't track changes. This is correct because incorrect EUC files may prevent change tracking.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A**, as incorrect EUC files can lead to flawed strategic planning, which is a significant risk.
