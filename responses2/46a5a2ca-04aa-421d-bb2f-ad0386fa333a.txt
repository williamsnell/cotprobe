Okay, so I've got this math problem here: find the product of 0.07 multiplied by 5.8. I'm a bit nervous because I don't want to make a mistake, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that multiplying decimals can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down. Let me write it down: 0.07 times 5.8. Hmm, maybe I can ignore the decimals for a moment and just multiply the numbers as if they were whole. So 7 times 58. Wait, no, 0.07 is 7 hundredths, and 5.8 is 5 and 0.8. So 0.07 * 5.8.

Another approach is to think of 0.07 as 7 * 10^-2 and 5.8 as (58 * 10^-1). So multiplying them together would give 7 * 58 * 10^-3. Let me compute 7 * 58 first. 7 times 50 is 350, and 7 times 8 is 56. So 350 +56 is 406. So that gives me 406 * 10^-3, which is 0.406. Wait, but that's 0.406. Let me check again.

Alternatively, I can use standard multiplication. Let's do it the long way. 

0.07
×5.8
--------
Multiply 0.07 by 8: 0.56
Multiply 0.07 by 50 (which is 50.00) because 5.8 is 5 + 0.8, but wait, no, 5.8 is 5 + 0.8, so when you multiply by 5, it's 5.00, and by 0.8 it's 0.56. But perhaps a better way is to multiply 5.8 by 0.07.

Wait, maybe I should set it up properly. Let me add 0.07 four times: 0.07 +0.07 is 0.14, plus another 0.07 is 0.21, and another 0.07 is 0.28. Hmm, but that's when I'm adding 5 times. Wait, 5.8 is 5 + 0.8, so 0.07 *5 is 0.35, and 0.07 *0.8 is 0.056. Adding those together: 0.35 + 0.056 equals 0.406. Yes, that gives me the same result as before.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.406, which matches this calculation. Option B is 0.0406, which is ten times smaller—probably if I had missed a decimal place somewhere, like maybe a misplaced decimal point. Option C is 4.06, which is 10 times too big. Option D is 40.6, which is 100 times too big. So the correct answer should be A.

The product of 0.07 and 5.8 is calculated by considering their decimal places and performing the multiplication accurately. Multiplying 0.07 (which is 7 hundredths) by 5.8 (which is 5 and 0.8) gives 0.406. Checking the options, option A (0.406) matches this result.

Answer: A
