Question:

From laboratory measurements we know that a particular spectral line formed by hydrogen appears at a wavelength of 486.1 nanometers (nm). The spectrum of a particular star shows the same hydrogen line appearing at a wavelength of 485.9 nm. What can we conclude?

Options:

A: The star's brightness is fluctuating.
B: The star's size is increasing.
C: The star's size is decreasing.
D: The star's temperature is constant.
E: The star is getting hotter.
F: The star is not moving.
G: The star is rotating on its axis.
H: The star is getting colder.
I: The star is moving away from us.
J: The star is moving toward us.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about spectral lines and stars. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a particular spectral line from hydrogen appears at 486.1 nm in a laboratory. And in a star's spectrum, the same line is at 485.9 nm. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through a star's atmosphere, it's redshifted or blueshifted depending on the movement of the star relative to us.

Wait, redshift is when the wavelength increases, right? Because when something moves away, the light gets longer. Blue shift is when it approaches us, so the light gets shorter. Oh wait, no, if the star is moving away, it's redshifted. If moving towards us, it's blueshifted.

So in this case, the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted one. So the star must be moving toward us. Because when something moves toward us, the light it emits (rest wavelength) gets blueshifted, appearing shorter.

Looking at the options, option I is about the star moving away, which would be redshift. Option J is moving toward us, so that's what this case suggests. So the star is moving towards us.

Let me look at the options again.

A to J: The options are about brightness, size, etc. But the question is about the spectral line's shift. Brightness (luminosity) would affect the strength of the line, but the question doesn't mention anything about that. So the star's brightness isn't directly the reason here. So A is probably not correct.

What about the star's size? Well, the same spectral line doesn't directly tell us about size. The line's position depends more on the star's velocity. So B and C about size aren't directly supported by this info.

What about temperature? I'm not sure. Temperature affects the emitted spectrum but not the observed shift. Unless the star's atmosphere has something, but the question doesn't mention that. So D doesn't seem relevant here.

So the key is the spectral line shift. The star is moving toward us, so J would be the correct conclusion.

The question involves analyzing the shift in a hydrogen spectral line from hydrogen to determine the star's movement. The observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted wavelength, indicating a redshift. This occurs when the star moves away from the observer, causing the light to be redshifted. Among the options provided, only option **J** ("The star is moving toward us") correctly describes the situation based on the observed wavelength shift.

Answer: J
