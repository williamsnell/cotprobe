Question:

A 37-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 45 minutes after she was found unconscious on her apartment floor. Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work. On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours?

Options:

A: Pulmonary embolism
B: Acute liver failure
C: Myocardial infarction
D: Septic shock
E: Acute respiratory distress syndrome
F: Cerebral edema
G: Cerebral hemorrhage
H: Pancreatitis
I: Acute renal failure
J: Acute tubular necrosis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's break it down step by step. The patient is a 37-year-old woman who's been found unconscious on her apartment floor. Her coworkers are concerned that she didn't come to work. After arrival, she doesn't provide a history. Her measurements are 96 paces/min, 12 breaths/min, and BP 124/58 mmHg. The exam shows erythema, warmth, and induration in the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her creatine kinase is 10,300 U/L, which is elevated. Urine toxicology tests are positive for opiates and cocaine, and the urine has pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. 

So, the question is what condition is at increased risk for the next 24 hours.

Looking at the options, I think I need to consider each possibility.

First, her BP is 124/58. That's quite high, maybe leading to hypotension. But the creatine kinase is elevated, which is a marker for kidney function. High CK is often seen in people with kidney disease or kidney failure.

The patient is 37, which is on the younger end, so maybe she's an adult not in high risk for pre-existing conditions. Her blood pressure is high, which could indicate hypertension, but elevated CK might rule in something else.

Her exam findings are erythema, warmth, and induration, which is usually associated with edema. So she has edema. The urine is showing rare erythrocytes and pigmented casts. Erythrocytes are red blood cells, so the casts are red. Pigmented casts might indicate something else, maybe a cataract or a retinal issue. Or perhaps it's related to a kidney or liver condition.

The toxicology tests are positive foropiates and cocaine. That’s a red flag because these are commonly associated with liver issues. For example, opiates can cause nausea, dizziness, and sometimes lead to liver damage. So this patient has a history of opioid use, which is a serious condition.

The creatine kinase is 10,300 U/L, which is above the normal range. Normal CK is usually around 8,500-9,500 U/L, but elevated levels can indicate kidney disease or kidney failure. If CK is high and there's a history ofopiates and cocaine use, it's a classic sign of acute kidney injury or acute kidney failure.

In acute kidney injury, you might see increased kidney function and maybe signs of edema. But with CK elevation, it's more likely to be acute kidney failure. In AKI, you might see a lot of blood in the blood tests, but in this case, the urine has rare erythrocytes, which suggests a more acute situation.

So, the patient's elevated CK and recent use of opiates and cocaine indicate possible acute kidney injury or acute kidney failure. The other signs are edema (upper back and thighs) and rare erythrocytes, which could point towards a kidney issue.

Looking at the options, option E is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARTS), which is more about chest pain. Option J is tubular necrosis, which is more about internal bleeding. Option I is acute renal failure, which fits because CK is high and recent consumption is noted.

Other options: Acute liver failure (B) – but the patient's history ofopiates is a red flag, not liver issues. Cerebral edema (F) – that's a possibility, but the patient's CK and edema points more to kidney. Cerebral hemorrhage (G) is more severe and usually occurs with more systemic issues.

So the best option is J: Acute renal failure. The patient is at increased risk for acute kidney failure because of the high CK and recent opioid use. So the answer would be J.
</think>

The patient is at increased risk for acute renal failure due to her elevated creatine kinase (CK) level of 10,300 U/L, a significant marker of acute kidney injury or failure. Her history ofopiates and cocaine use further supports this diagnosis. Elevated CK and recent substance use are strong indicators of acute kidney disease. 

**Answer: J: Acute tubular necrosis**
