Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the net price for a speaker set after a trade discount. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that Handy Dandy Speakers is selling each unit to Tech High-Fi for $299.50 with a trade discount of 36%. I need to find out what Tech is paying for each set, which would be the net price after applying the discount. 

Hmm, trade discounts are usually subtracted from the list price. So I think I should calculate 36% of $299.50 and then subtract that from the original price to get the net price. Let me write that down.

First, I'll find 36% of 299.50. To calculate the discount, I can multiply 299.50 by 0.36. Let me do that. 299.50 multiplied by 0.36... 299.5 * 0.36. Let me see, 299.5 * 0.3 is 89.85, and 299.5 * 0.06 is 17.97. Adding those together gives 89.85 + 17.97 = 107.82. So the discount is $107.82.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.36 is 36%, so 299.5 * 0.36. Let me double-check the multiplication. Alternatively, I can do 299.5 * 36 and then divide by 100. Let's try that. 299.5 * 36. 

I'll break it down: 300 * 36 is 10,800. But since it's 299.5, that's 299.5 = 300 - 0.5. So (300 - 0.5) * 36 = 300*36 - 0.5*36 = 10,800 - 18 = 10,782. Then divide by 100 (because it's 36%), so 10,782 / 100 = $107.82. Okay, that matches my first calculation.

So the discount is $107.82. Now, to find the net price, I subtract this discount from the original price. The original price is $299.50. So, 299.50 - 107.82. Let me calculate that.

299.50 minus 107.82. Let's subtract step by step. 299.50 - 100 is 199.50. Then subtract 7.82 more: 199.50 - 7.82. Let's see, 199.50 - 7 is 192.50, then subtract 0.82: 192.50 - 0.82 is 191.68.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I do that right? Because 299.50 minus 107.82 equals 191.68. So the net price is $191.68. Let's check the options again. The options are A:251.55, B:215.64, C:391.82, D:299.50, E:191.68, F:383.64, G:89.70, H:107.82, I:179.70, J:239.60.

Looking at the options, E is 191.68. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes trade discounts can be calculated differently, like using net price formulas. Let me make sure I'm doing it right.

Another way to calculate the net price is to use the formula: Net Price = List Price * (1 - Discount Rate). So 299.50 * (1 - 0.36) = 299.50 * 0.64. Let me compute that.

299.50 * 0.64. Let me break it down. 299.50 * 0.6 is 179.70, and 299.50 * 0.04 is 11.98. Adding those gives 179.70 + 11.98 = 191.68. Yep, same result. So the net price is $191.68, which is option E. 

Wait, but I think I should double-check because sometimes people get confused between trade and cash discounts. Trade discounts are usually straightforward, but sometimes they might be compounded. But in this case, it's a single trade discount of 36%, so it's the same as what I calculated. 

So yes, the correct answer is E:191.68.

To determine the net price after a 36% trade discount, calculate 36% of $299.50 and subtract it from the list price. 36% of 299.50 is $107.82. Subtracting this from $299.50 gives $191.68. 

Answer: E: $191.68
