Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the period of a signal. The signal is given as x₁(t) = cos(3πt) -4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). Hmm, I need to find its period. I'm a bit rusty on my signal processing, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Wait, the period of a cosine function cos(ωt) is 2π divided by ω. So each term in the signal contributes to the overall period. But since it's a combination of two cosines, I have to think about the least common multiple (LCM) of their individual periods. Because the signal is a sum of two periodic functions, the total period is the LCM of their periods.

Let me break it down. The first term is cos(3πt). So ω is 3π. The period T1 is 2π/(3π) = 2/3. Oh wait, wait, no, 2π divided by 3π would be 2/3? Wait, 2π / (3π) is 2/3. Yeah.

The second term is 4 cos(5πt - 0.5π). So the frequency is 5π, so the period T2 is 2π/(5π) = 2/5. Wait, wait, no: 2π divided by 5π is 2/5. So T2 is 2/5.

Now I need to find the LCM of T1 and T2. So T1 is 2/3, T2 is 2/5.

Hmm, how do I find the LCM of two fractions? I remember that for fractions, the LCM is the LCM of the numerators divided by the GCD of the denominators. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, another approach is to find a common period that both T1 and T2 divide into without remainder.

Alternatively, think about it this way: the periods T1 and T2 must be such that there's a time T where both terms complete an integer number of cycles. So T must be a multiple of T1 and T2.

So T is the LCM of T1 and T2. Let me compute the values numerically.

T1 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 seconds.
T2 = 2/5 = 0.4 seconds.

What's the LCM of 2/3 and 2/5? Well, the LCM of two fractions a/b and c/d is LCM(a,c)/GCD(b,d). Or wait, no, another way: the LCM of two fractions is the smallest positive number that is an integer multiple of both. So perhaps I can find the smallest T such that T is a multiple of both T1 and T2.

So looking for T where T = k * T1 and T = m * T2 for integers k and m.

So, k*(2/3) = m*(2/5). Let's simplify that: (k/3) = (m/5), so 5k = 3m. Looking for integers k and m that satisfy this. The smallest such k and m would be k=3 and m=5, because 5*3=15 and 3*5=15. So the smallest T is (3 * 2/3) = 2, or (5 * 2/5) = 2. So T=2 seconds.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 2 is a multiple of both 2/3 and 2/5? Let's check. 2 divided by 2/3 is 3, which is an integer. 2 divided by 2/5 is 5, which is an integer. So yes, the LCM is 2.

Wait, but that would mean the period is 2, which is one of the options. Looking back, the options are A:3, B:4, C:0.5, D:3.5, E:1.5, F:1, G:5, H:2, I:2.5, J:6. So option H is 2.

Wait, but I thought the periods of the two terms were 2/3 and 2/5, which would have LCM 2. But wait, wait another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating T1 and T2.

Wait, another way: the periods are T1 = 2π/(3π) = 2/3, T2=2π/(5π)=2/5. So T1=2/3, T2=2/5.

Wait, let me compute 2/3 and 2/5. The LCM of 2/3 and 2/5.

Hmm, perhaps another method: find a common multiple. What's the LCM of 2/3 and 2/5? Another approach is to find the LCM of their denominators divided by their GCD.

Wait, actually, I think the formula is LCM(a/b, c/d) = LCM(a,c)/GCD(b,d). Because when you have fractions, the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

So, for 2/3 and 2/5:

a=2, b=3; c=2, d=5.

LCM(2,2)=2.

GCD(3,5)=1.

So LCM(2/3, 2/5)= 2 / 1= 2.

So the LCM is 2. So the period is 2. So the answer would be H:2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the two periods are 2/3 and 2/5. So 2 is the LCM. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another approach: think of the periods in terms of their fractions.

T1 = 2/3 seconds, T2=2/5 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps the periods are 2/3 and 2/5, so the combined period is the LCM of 2/3 and 2/5. Let me compute this.

We can write T as a fraction: T = a/(b) where a and b are integers. We need to find the smallest T such that T is a multiple of both 2/3 and 2/5.

So T must be equal to (2/3)*k where k is an integer, and also T must equal (2/5)*m, where m is an integer.

So (2/3)k = (2/5)m → (k/m) = (2/5)/(2/3) )= (2/5)*(3/2) = 3/5 → k = (3/5)m.

But since k must be an integer, m must be a multiple of 5. Let me set m=5, then k=3. So T= (2/3)*3=2. So yeah, T=2.

So the period is 2 seconds. So the correct answer is option H:2.

To determine the period of the signal \( x_1(t) = \cos(3\pi t) - 4\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \), we analyze each term individually and then find the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods.

1. **First Term**: \( \cos(3\pi t) \)  
   The period \( T_1 \) is calculated as:
   \[
   T_1 = \frac{2\pi}{3\pi} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

2. **Second Term**: \( 4\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \)  
   The period \( T_2 \) is:
   \[
   T_2 = \frac{2\pi}{5\pi} = \frac{2}{5} \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

3. **Finding the LCM of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \)**:  
   To find the LCM of \( \frac{2}{3} \) and \( \frac{2}{5} \), we use the formula for LCM of fractions:
   \[
   \text{LCM}\left(\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d}\right) = \frac{\text{LCM}(a, c)}{\text{GCD}(b, d)}.
   \]
   Here, \( a = 2, b = 3, c = 2, d = 5 \).  
   - \( \text{LCM}(2, 2) = 2 \)  
   - \( \text{GCD}(3, 5) = 1 \)  
   Thus, \( \text{LCM}\left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{5}\right) = \frac{2}{1} = 2 \, \text{seconds} \).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The period of the signal \( x_1(t) \) is the LCM of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), which is **2 seconds**.
