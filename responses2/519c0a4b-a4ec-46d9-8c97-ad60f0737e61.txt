Okay, so I've got this logic question here, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is asking me to translate the statement "If Eileen plays fiddle then Sherri sings" into predicate logic, and then choose the correct option from A to H.

Hmm. First, I need to understand the structure of the sentence. It's a conditional statement: if P then Q. In logic terms, that's P → Q. So I'm looking for the correct way to represent this.

The statement is about Eileen playing fiddle and Sherri singing. So let's break it down. The antecedent is "Eileen plays fiddle," and the consequent is "Sherri sings." 

Wait, but in predicate logic, especially when dealing with subjects and predicates, do I need to consider the subjects? Like, are Eileen and Sherri individual subjects, or are they objects? The question doesn’t specify, so I think I can assume that each is a distinct individual. So the statements would probably be about them as subjects.

So the antecedent is about Eileen playing fiddle. Let me denote:
- Let E(x) mean "x is Eileen."
- Let F(x) mean "x plays fiddle."
- Let S(y) mean "y sings."

So the antecedent is E(e) → F(e). Because Eileen is E, and she plays fiddle.

But wait, the options don't have E(e) as a predicate. Looking at the options, they all use lowercase letters for the subjects. So perhaps the predicates are about other people. Let's check the options.

Option F says Fe → Ss. Fe would be "Eileen sings," which doesn't make sense because the antecedent is about E playing fiddle, not E singing. So Fe is a predicate for E, which is not what we want.

Option H is eF ∧ Ss. Wait, eF would be "Eileen plays fiddle," and Ss is "Sherri sings." So eF ∧ Ss would mean Eileen plays fiddle and Sherri sings. But the original statement is a conditional, not a conjunction. So H isn't correct because it's an 'and' instead of an 'implies'.

Option D is eF → Ss. That would translate to "If Eileen plays fiddle, then Sherri sings," which is exactly the statement, so that seems correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact way the options are presented. Let me recheck the options.

Option A: Ss ∨ Fe → that would be "Sherri sings OR Eileen sings," which doesn't fit the original statement.

Option B: Fe ∨ Ss → "Eileen sings OR Sherri sings," which is a different statement. It's implying that either E or S sings, which is not the same as the implication.

Option C: Fe ∧ Ss → as I mentioned earlier, this is an 'and' statement, not an 'implies' one.

Option D: eF → Ss → same as what I thought, it's an implication.

Option E: Ss ∨ eF → same as A, same as OR, not the conditional.

Option F: Fe → Ss → which is the same as D but with the antecedent being about E. So it's "If Eileen sings, then Sherri sings," which is not the same as the original statement.

Option G: eF ∨ Es → "Eileen plays fiddle OR Eileen is E (which I don't think is correct)."

Option I: eS ⊃ Fe → "If E is S (which doesn't make sense here), then E plays fiddle." Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

So the correct translation should be "If Eileen plays fiddle, then Sherri sings." Which is eF → Ss. So the correct option is D.
</think>

The correct translation is "If Eileen plays fiddle, then Sherri sings." In predicate logic, this is represented as eF → Ss. Looking at the options, option D matches this structure.

Answer: D
