Okay, so I have this integral to compute: the double integral of xy² dA over a rectangle D where x ranges from 0 to 2 and y ranges from 0 to 1. Hmm, I've done some double integrals before, but not too many. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a double integral like this can be split into iterated integrals. So, I can integrate with respect to y first and then x, or vice versa. I think the rectangle is straightforward, so either order would work, but maybe integrating with respect to y first is easier since the integrand is in x and y².

So, setting up the integral: ∫ (x from 0 to 2) [ ∫ (y from 0 to 1) (xy²) dy ] dx. Yeah, that makes sense. Let's compute the inner integral first.

Wait, integrating xy² with respect to y. Since x is treated as a constant when integrating with respect to y, the integral becomes x * ∫ y² dy. The integral of y² is (y³)/3. So evaluating from 0 to 1: [ (1³)/3 - (0³)/3 ] = 1/3. So the inner integral is x*(1/3) = x/3.

Now, the outer integral becomes ∫ (x from 0 to 2) (x/3) dx. That simplifies to (1/3) * ∫ x dx from 0 to 2. The integral of x is (x²)/2. Plugging in 2: (2²)/2 = 4/2 = 2. Subtracting the lower limit (0), we get 2. So, (1/3)*2 = 2/3.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. So, the inner integral was ∫₀¹ xy² dy = x*(1/3). Then integrating x/3 from 0 to 2: (x/3) integrated is (x²)/(6). Evaluated at 2: (4)/6 = 2/3. So the result is 2/3.

Now, looking at the options, let's see: option G is 2.00000. Hmm, but 2/3 is approximately 0.66667. So that's option D?

Wait, wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me go through again.

Inner integral: ∫₀¹ xy² dy. x is constant, so ∫ y² dy = (y³)/3. Evaluated from 0 to 1: 1/3 - 0 = 1/3. So the inner integral is x*(1/3) = x/3.

Outer integral: ∫₀² x/3 dx. That's (1/3) ∫x dx. ∫x dx is (x²)/2. Evaluated from 0 to 2: (2²)/2 - 0 = 4/2 = 2. Multiply by 1/3: 2*(1/3)= 2/3. So 2/3 is about 0.66667. So the correct answer should be D: 0.66667.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip the order of integration or anything. Because sometimes the order matters, but in this case, the rectangle is aligned with the axes, so integrating with respect to y first is fine. Could I have swapped the order and gotten a different result? Let's see.

If I switch the order, x from 0 to 2, and y from 0 to 1. So the integral would be ∫₀² ∫₀¹ xy² dy dx. The inner integral is same as before, x/3. Then integrating x/3 from 0 to 2 gives 2/3. So same result. So no, the answer is 2/3, which is 0.66667, so option D.

The integral is computed by evaluating the inner integral first with respect to y, resulting in x/3, then integrating this with respect to x from 0 to 2, yielding 2/3 or approximately 0.66667. This corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
