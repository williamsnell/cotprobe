Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question to answer based on Sartre's philosophy. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about what happens if God doesn't exist, according to Sartre. The options are A through J.

First, I remember that Sartre is a key thinker in existentialism, particularly known for being a Plutarchian. He didn't believe in God as a superior being but rather in the existence of the universe. So, if God doesn't exist, that's a departure from Plutarchian thought.

Looking at the options:

A: Man is condemned to be free. Wait, Sartre's views are more about the moral and existential aspects. If God doesn't exist, does that mean man is free? I think in Plutarchian thought, God's existence isn't viewed as aWasabi principle but more as a way to explain existence. So maybe this is not the case.

B: Moral values still exist. Hmm, Sartre was critical of the idea that moral values are fixed. He argued that values are fluid and can change based on the situation. So if God doesn't exist, does that mean moral values remain? I'm not sure, but I think B might be incorrect because Sartre might have thought that the values themselves aren't static.

C: Morality is defined by society. Sartre did discuss how ethics are shaped by societal norms and values. If God isn't a force, maybe society's norms are more important. So C could be a possibility.

D: Man does not exist. Wait, Sartre doesn't believe in God as a superior entity. So he would not accept a divine being. But does that mean man doesn't exist? Or does he still think of some form of existence? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe D is not the right answer because he's rejecting the existence of God, but doesn't necessarily deny man's existence.

E: Anything is permissible. If God doesn't exist, does that mean moral guidelines change? I'm not sure. Maybe if God isn't there, the rules that bind us change. So perhaps E is the answer.

F: There is no purpose to life. Sartre did discuss the idea of the void, which affects the purpose. If God isn't present, does that mean there's no purpose? I think he might say that purpose is inherent in the void, so without God, there's no purpose. So F could be correct.

G: Humans are not responsible for their actions. Sartre rejected the idea that humans are responsible. Instead, he thought it's the universe's responsibility. So G might not be the right answer.

H: Life has no meaning. Well, Sartre's work includes discussions on life. If God isn't present, does that mean life doesn't have a purpose? I'm leaning towards that, but I'm not entirely certain.

J: Morals are subjective. Sartre was critical of the idea that morality is a universal set. He believed that morality is subjective and varies depending on the context. So J might not be correct.

Now, trying to piece this together. If God doesn't exist, what does Sartre say? He's rejecting the idea that God is a superior force. So he would likely say that man is not free, but the options don't directly say that. Looking at the options, A says man is free, which isn't exactly what he rejects. B says moral values are still there, but maybe he thinks they can change. C says morality is society's definition, which makes sense as he's more about the ethical framework being shaped by societal norms. D says man doesn't exist, but I think he doesn't, he just doesn't believe in a divine being. E says anything is permissible, which might change. F says no purpose to life, which I think he supports. G says humans are not responsible, which I think he rejected. H says life has no meaning, which I think he does. J says ethics are subjective, which aligns with his belief.

Wait, the question is, according to Sartre, if God does not exist, what happens. So, what does he say? He doesn't believe in a divine being, so he doesn't accept the idea that God is the reason for existence. He views the world as being governed by human choices and societal norms.

Looking for the answer that corresponds to his later thoughts. I think he would argue that without God, the moral systems and the idea of purpose in life are not fixed. So, if he's rejecting a divine cause, he would support the idea that life has no meaning. Or perhaps he's saying that the universe's purpose is up to the people and not God.

Wait, another angle: Sartre's "On Earth" discusses the void and the void as the source of purpose. If the void is empty (no God), does that mean there's no purpose? So F and H might be. But I'm not certain. Another thought: D says man doesn't exist. But Sartre doesn't accept a divine God, so he doesn't think man is free to exist. So D is probably not correct.

Alternatively, considering the options, I think the answer is E: anything is permissible. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, he might say that without God, the universe's rules change. So life's purpose is no longer tied to an external force. Maybe that's what E implies.

Wait, another point. If God doesn't exist, the idea that God is the reason for existence is gone. So, in his view, the universe's purpose is not fixed. So, perhaps life doesn't have a purpose, which would align with F and H. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think Sartre might argue that without a divine force, the universe's purpose is determined by human choice. So, life has no meaning because it's up to humans. So, F and H are both correct, but only one can be the answer.

Looking back at the options, E says anything is permissible. If the universe's purpose is up to humans, then perhaps it's permissible. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the universe isn't governed by any laws, then perhaps E is correct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about his later works. "On Earth" is more about the void and the irrational, while later works might differ. Alternatively, I think Sartre might not believe in the idea that anything is permissible. Instead, he believed that the universe's purpose is a human responsibility. So perhaps life has no meaning because it's not tied to an external force.

So, I think the correct answer is F: there is no purpose to life. Because without God, the universe's purpose isn't fixed, and it's up to humans. Alternatively, H: life has no meaning. Which one is it?

Wait, in "On Earth," Sartre discusses the void as the source of purpose. The void is without God. So, if the void is empty, then there is no purpose to life. So F and H are both in play. But which is the correct answer according to Sartre.

Alternatively, I think he would deny the idea that anything is permissible. Instead, it's up to the people. So, E says anything is permissible, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because if God doesn't exist, then the universe's purpose isn't fixed, so any rules would be up to humans. So, E says anything is permissible, which might be in contradiction with his earlier beliefs. But I think I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Another approach: look for Sartre's "On Earth." He says that the absence of a divine force (God) means that the universe isn't governed by any external force, so the purpose isn't fixed. Therefore, the idea that anything is permissible (E) isn't necessarily correct. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think Sartre rejects the idea that anything is permissible. He believes that the universe's purpose is a human responsibility. So, life has no meaning because it's not tied to an external force.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: there is no purpose to life. Because without a divine force, the universe's purpose isn't fixed, so there's no purpose.

Alternatively, the correct answer is E: anything is permissible. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: Sartre's work "On Earth" argues that the universe's purpose is a human responsibility. So, without God, humans are responsible for the universe's purpose. So, life has no meaning because it's not tied to an external force. So, F and H are both correct. But the options don't allow for multiple correct answers.

Looking back at the options, E is " anything is permissible." If the universe's purpose is up to humans, then perhaps E is correct. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: anything is permissible. Because without a divine force, the universe's rules change, so anything is permissible. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because Sartre didn't believe in the idea that anything is permissible. He thought the universe's purpose is up to the people. So, if that's the case, E is the answer.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: look for similar questions or think about the options.

The question is, if God doesn't exist, what does Sartre say.

I recall that in "On Earth," Sartre states that the absence of God means that the universe is not governed by an external force. So, the purpose isn't fixed. So, there is no purpose to life (F and H). But which one is it?

Wait, another thought: Sartre's later works, like "The World Within," discuss the idea that the universe's purpose is a human responsibility. So, if the universe's purpose isn't fixed, then life has no meaning (F and H). So, the correct answer is F or H.

But the options don't have a choice between them. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: man is free

B: moral values exist

C: morality is by society

D: man does not exist

E: anything is permissible

F: no purpose

G: humans are not responsible

H: life has no meaning

I: moral values come from nature

J: morals are subjective

So, H and F are both possibilities.

Wait, another angle: Sartre didn't believe in God as a superior force. So, if God doesn't exist, then the idea of a divine force (God) is gone. So, moral values aren't fixed, as before. So, B is incorrect.

So, if B is incorrect, then C is still possible. Wait, C says morality is defined by society. Sartre did believe in the idea that society defines morality. So, C is correct.

So, if C is correct, the answer would be C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if God doesn't exist, perhaps H is the answer.

I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to think of what Sartre said. He believed that the universe's purpose is a human responsibility. So, if God isn't there, humans are responsible for the universe's purpose. So, life has no meaning, because it's not tied to an external force. So, F and H.

But which one is the correct answer. The options are separate. So, perhaps the correct answer is H: life has no meaning.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I'm not fully recalling Sartre's exact statements. Another approach: think about what each answer implies about Sartre's view.

If the answer is E: anything is permissible, that suggests that the universe is governed by human laws, which contradicts Sartre's belief that the universe's purpose isn't fixed. So, E might not be correct.

If the answer is F: no purpose to life, that aligns with Sartre's view that the universe's purpose isn't fixed.

H: life has no meaning because it's not tied to an external force.

So, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, but I'm not certain. I think I'm making this too complicated. Let me try to recall Sartre's later works. In "The World Within," he discusses the void as the source of the universe's purpose. So, if the void is empty (no God), then there is no purpose to life. So F and H are both correct in this context, but the options don't allow multiple choices.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that "anything is permissible" is incorrect. Instead, the universe's purpose is a human responsibility, so life has no meaning (F and H). So, the answer would be E is incorrect.

Ah, perhaps the correct answer is E: anything is permissible. Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think I've heard that if God doesn't exist, according to Sartre, the universe is not governed by any external force, so the purpose isn't fixed. Therefore, life has no meaning. So, F and H.

But the options require choosing only one. So, perhaps the correct answer is F: there is no purpose to life. Or H: life has no meaning.

Wait, another thought. Sartre's "On Earth" argues that the absence of a divine force leads to the universe's purpose being up to the people. So, if that's the case, H would be the answer.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since Sartre's "On Earth" is about the void and the universe's purpose, perhaps the answer is E: anything is permissible. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. I'll try to think of the options again.

Option E: anything is permissible. If the universe's purpose is up to the people, then perhaps it's permissible. But I think Sartre's later works might differ. Alternatively, he might not believe in the idea that anything is permissible.

So, perhaps the correct answer is E: anything is permissible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the correct answer is H: life has no meaning. Because without God, the universe isn't governed by an external force, so the purpose is up to the people.

So, the answer is H.
</think>

According to Sartre, if God does not exist, the universe's purpose is not fixed and is a human responsibility. This means that life does not have a predefined purpose, as it is not tied to an external force. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: life has no meaning**

ANSWER: H
