Question:

A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain. She describes the pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. Over the past 9 days, she has had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She does not smoke. Her husband and children have had no recent illness. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Examination shows congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. There is tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus. The tympanic membranes are normal, and there is no erythema of the throat. Examination shows no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?

Options:

A: Escherichia coli
B: Staphylococcus aureus
C: Haemophilus influenzae type b
D: Mycoplasma pneumoniae
E: Neisseria meningitidis
F: Streptococcus pyogenes
G: Pseudomonas aeruginosa
H: Bordetella pertussis
I: Moraxella catarrhalis
J: Streptococcus pneumoniae

Okay, so I need to figure out the most likely organism causing the patient's symptoms. Let's break down the information provided.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain. The pain is 7/10 in intensity, which is quite severe. She's had nasal congestion, purulent discharge, sore throat, and a non-productive cough for the past 9 days. She doesn't smoke, which might rule out certain conditions, but other factors could still be at play.

Her exam findings are congested nasal mucosa with purulent discharge on the left. Tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination. Tympanic membranes are normal, no erythema of the throat, and no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. No cervical adenitis.

So, what's the likely cause? Let's go through each option.

Option A: E. coli. E. coli can cause a lot of things, including sinus infections. It's common and can lead to staphylococcal infections. But in this case, the patient has a more severe situation, so maybe not just E. coli.

Option B: Staph aureus. Staph aureus can cause streptococcal infections. But her symptoms are more towards a higher level, like a throat infection, but given her history, maybe not. Alternatively, her sinus problems might point towards a staph infection, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Haemophilus influenzae type b. This is a common cause of sinusitis, especially in children. It's a beta-lactamase inhibitor, so it's susceptible to infections. The patient has 9 days of sinusitis, which fits. But in the exam, she has conflit of antigens maybe? Or other signs.

Option D: Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This is a more severe form, like in respiratory infections. It can cause pneumonia. But the patient is young, 37, and doesn't smoke. Are Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases common in children? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option E: Neisseria meningitidis. This is a common cause of meningitis. She has a throat infection, but she's 37, so maybe it's a less severe case. However, the patient has 9 days of sinusitis, which might be more indicative of a bacterial infection rather than a viral one.

Option F: Streptococcus pyogenes. This is the common cause of streptococcal infections, which can range from mild to severe. Her sinusitis and throat infection, along with the 9-day history, might point towards streptococcal infection.

Option G: Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is a common cause of sinus infections and dyskeratosis. The patient's symptoms could fit, but I'm not sure if this is the most likely.

Option H: Bordetella pertussis. That's the common cause of whooping cough. She doesn't have any signs of that, like conflit of antigens unless she was exposed, which she's not. So probably not.

Option I: Moraxella catarrhalis. That's a fungal infection, perhaps. But her symptoms are more like bacterial.

Option J: Streptococcus pneumoniae. That's another possibility, more severe. But the patient's symptoms are 7/10, which is pretty high, so maybe not as severe as pneumonia.

Let me think about the signs. She has sinus congestion, purulent discharge, and a non-productive cough. That points towards a bacterial infection, maybe in the sinuses. Sinusitis is more likely to be caused by certain bacteria than by a virus like meningitis.

Streptococcus aureus is also a likely cause, but given the history of sinusitis and throat infection, it's more likely to be a bacterial infection.

Wait, in the exam, she has conflit of antigens? Or no transillumination. No transillumination suggests no fever in the maxillary sinus, which is a sign of a bacterial infection because viral infections would cause redness, but that's not the case here. And no conflit of antigens (like if it's a viral infection) would be a red spot. So, that's more consistent with a bacterial cause.

What about the 7/10 intensity? That's quite severe. Which bacteria are known for high-intensity sinusitis? Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause high-intensity sinusitis, but also, some other bacteria like Haemophilus are known for that. Wait, but in the patient's case, there's no mention of other signs like fever or chills. So, if it's high-intensity, perhaps Haemophilus or Mycoplasma.

Wait, but in the exam, the patient's maxillary sinus is tender but no transillumination. Tympanic membrane normal. So, no fever, no chills, just tender tissue. That's more consistent with sinusitis, which can be caused by either bacterial or viral infections.

Streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of sinusitis, but in the presence of sinus congestion, perhaps it's better to think about the other options.

Looking back, the options are E (Neisseria) and F (Streptococcus). Her symptoms may point towards either. Her 37-year-old without a cough that's 9 days, so perhaps it's a more severe bacterial infection.

Option E: Neisseria meningitidis is more commonly associated with meningitis, but since her symptoms are more like sinusitis, maybe.

Option F: Streptococcus pyogenes has a higher rate of severe infections, especially in children. Her age is 37, which is in the mid to young range, so maybe her infection is more likely to be a Streptococcus.

Alternatively, in a child, if the child is not a respiratory Eagle, but 37 is a typical age, perhaps it's in the early stages.

Wait, but the patient's symptoms are 7/10, which is high. How do the options compare? Let's think about what each would cause.

Streptococcus pyogenes: can cause a lot of different infections. Sinusitis, strep throat, etc. But in severe cases, it can lead to more serious complications, but perhaps in a 9-day course, it's more likely to be a strain that causes high-intensity sinuses.

Haemophilus: can cause sinusitis, and if it's causing a lot of nasal congestion, that's a likely cause.

Streptococcus aureus: can cause sepsis, but in a 37-year-old, not sure about that. But 9 days of sinusitis may be more indicative of a bacterial infection.

Alternatively, given that the patient's symptoms are 7/10, which is high, perhaps it's not a viral infection but a bacterial one, like a strain causing severe sinuses.

So, looking at the options, the best fit is F: Streptococcus pyogenes. Because even in children, especially if they have a history of sinusitis, that's a common cause.

Alternatively, I'm a bit torn between F and H. But H is a form of whooping cough, which isn't supported by the exam findings.

Wait, wait. The exam shows no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus. That's more consistent with a bacterial infection, since viral infections cause redness or flaky tissue. So, maybe it's a bacterial cause.

Also, the fact that the patient doesn't smoke, so Neisseria (option E) isn't ruled out, but is it more likely to be a bacterial infection than a viral one?

In a 37-year-old, the presence of sinus congestion and 7/10 intensity suggests a bacterial cause, particularly in a child. Streptococcus pyogenes is a likely candidate, especially in a high-intensity case.

So I'm leaning towards F: Streptococcus pyogenes.
</think>

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a 1-day history of severe facial pain, described as 7/10 intensity. Over the past 9 days, she has had sinus congestion, purulent discharge, a non-productive cough, and a history of nasal congestion and sinusitis. She does not smoke, and her exam findings include congestion, purulent discharge, tender palpation over the left cheek, no transillumination, normal tympanic membranes, and no erythema of the throat. The lungs are clear, and there is no evidence of cervical adenitis.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **E. coli (Option A):** While E. coli can cause sinus infections, the severity and specific presentation (7/10 intensity) of sinusitis suggest a more likely bacterial cause.
2. **Staph aureus (Option B):** Staph aureus can cause streptococcal infections, but her 9-day history of sinusitis and high-intensity symptoms are more consistent with bacterial infection.
3. **Haemophilus influenzae type b (Option C):** This is a common cause of sinusitis, particularly in children, but the patient's age and the need for a more severe bacterial infection may lean towards a different option.
4. **Mycobacterium pneumoniae (Option D):** This is a more severe form of respiratory infection, typically associated with pneumonia, which is less likely given her symptoms.
5. **Neisseria meningitidis (Option E):** While this is a common cause of meningitis in children, her symptoms are more consistent with bacterial infection rather than viral infection.
6. **Streptococcus pyogenes (Option F):** This is a common cause of sinusitis, including high-intensity cases, and is supported by the patient's age and history of sinusitis.
7. **Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Option G):** While pseudomonas can cause sinusitis, the patient's symptoms are more indicative of a bacterial infection.
8. **Bordetella pertussis (Option H):** This is a form of whooping cough, which is not supported by the exam findings.
9. **Moraxella catarrhalis (Option I):** This is a fungal infection, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms.

### Conclusion:
The most likely cause, given the patient's age, history of sinusitis, and the severity of her symptoms, is **Streptococcus pyogenes**. This is a common cause of bacterial sinusitis, particularly in children, and aligns with the findings of the exam.
