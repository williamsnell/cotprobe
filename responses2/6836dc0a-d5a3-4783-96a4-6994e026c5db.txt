Okay, so I've got this question about James Milford buying tea. He spent $348.88 at the price of $0.98 per kilogram. The question is asking how many kilograms he bought. Let me think about how to approach this.

Hmm, so I remember that to find out how many units you can get with a certain amount, you usually divide the total cost by the price per unit. So here, I should divide 348.88 by 0.98.

Wait, let me get that right. So the formula is: number of kilograms = total cost / price per kg. Yeah, that makes sense.

But calculating 348.88 divided by 0.98 might be a bit tricky. Maybe I can simplify it. Let me see, 0.98 is almost 1, so dividing by 0.98 is like dividing by something close to 1. Alternatively, I could multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals. So that would make it 34888 divided by 98.

Hmm, but that's still a bit messy. Maybe I can do some mental math here. Let me think about how many times 98 goes into 34888.

Wait, alternatively, I could approximate. 0.98 is 1 minus 0.02. So 348.88 divided by 0.98 is the same as 348.88 multiplied by (1 / 0.98). Which is approximately 348.88 multiplied by 1.0204, because 1/0.98 is about 1.0204.

So let me calculate that. 348.88 * 1.0204. Let me break that down. 348.88 * 1 is 348.88. Then 348.88 * 0.02 is 6.9776. And 348.88 * 0.0004 is 0.139552. Adding those together: 348.88 + 6.9776 = 355.8576, plus 0.139552 gives approximately 356. So around 356 kilos.

Looking at the options, option H is 356 kilos. So the answer should be H.

The correct calculation involves dividing the total amount by the price per kilogram. 

**Steps:**
1. Divide $348.88 by $0.98 to find the number of kilograms.
2. Alternatively, multiply by 1/0.98 (approximately 1.0204).
3. The result is approximately 356 kilos.

**Answer:**
H: 356 kilos
