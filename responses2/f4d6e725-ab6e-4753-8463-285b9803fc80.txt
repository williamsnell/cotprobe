Okay, so I have this question about the study of older adults and aging. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what this study is called. The options are A through J, all related to different fields like biology, psychology, etc. Let me think about what each term means.

I remember learning that there are specific areas within biology that deal with aging. Gerontology, I think, stands for the study of the physical and social conditions of the elderly. That makes sense because older adults obviously have different body systems, health issues, and social behaviors. So, the study of older adults would fall under gerontology.

Let me go through each option again to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option A is Gerodiversityâ€”does that relate to diversity, maybe among older adults? Not sure. Geropsychiatry is the study of aging in psychology, so that's more about the mental effects rather than the study itself. Geronutrition is about nutrition, but that's a field, not the study's name. Gerolinguistics is about language, which doesn't apply. Gerocology is the study of living organisms and their physical characteristics, but that's more general.

Germodynamics is a term I've heard before in biology, but I'm not sure if it's part of the standard gerontological terms. Geromathematics sounds like it's mixing math with gerontology. Gerodynamics sounds similar but I'm not certain. Geromicroscopy is microscopy focused on living organisms, which isn't exactly about aging.

Looking at option J, Geriatrics is the study of aging in children and young adults. So that's a subset, but the question is about older adults and aging in general. Geromenagement is about management of aging, which is a function rather than the study itself. Gerocology is about living organisms, which isn't specific to aging.

So, putting it all together, the correct term for studying older adults and aging is Gerontology. That's the one that directly relates to the study of the physical and social conditions of the elderly. The other options either pertain to specific areas within gerontology or don't fit the theme of the question.

The correct answer is **J: Gerontology**. Gerontology refers to the study of the physical and social conditions of the elderly, including older adults.
