Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about managers' duties. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully.

The question is about what managers are responsible for when it comes to the company. It says, "Managers are entrusted to run the company in the best interest of ________." Then it gives two blanks with different fillers.

The options are a bunch of letter combinations. I need to figure out the correct ones. I remember that managers are often called "shareholders" in some contexts, but wait, noâ€”shareholders are the owners of the company, and managers are the people running it. So the first blank can't be "Shareholders." That rules out options A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J which all start with Shareholders except J. Wait, no: looking at J, it says "Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence." Hmm, but wait, the second part is "Diligence." I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think. The first blank is about what the managers are best in. I think managers are best in the interests of stakeholders. Stakeholders include both shareholders and others like employees, customers, etc. So the first blank should be "Stakeholders," not "Shareholders." So looking at the options, B and D start with "Stakeholders" or "Stakeholders, Care and Skill, Diligence." Wait, no, the options are:

A: Shareholders, Diligence, Self-interest
B: Shareholders, Self-interest, Care and Skill
C: Stakeholders, Care and skill, Self-interest
D: Stakeholders, Diligence, Care and Skill
E: Customers, Care and Skill, Diligence
F: Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence
G: Shareholders, Self-interest, Diligence
H: Employees, Care and Skill, Diligence
I: Stakeholders, Self-interest, Diligence
J: Stakeholder, Care and Skill, Diligence

Wait, J says "Stakeholders" but it's written as "Stakeholder," I think. Because in English, "stakeholder" is the correct form. So J's first part is "Stakeholder." So J's first part is wrong. So the first part should be "Stakeholders."

So now, looking at the options, B and D start with "Stakeholders." So between B and D.

The second part of the question says: "Managers have a duty of ________ and of _______." So two more blanks. I need to figure out what those are.

I remember that managers have to act in the best interest of the company, but they also have other responsibilities. I think one of the duties is self-interest, but that doesn't sound right. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's "Diligence" and "Care and Skill." Or maybe "Diligence and Care and Skill." Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me think again. The first part: best interest of stakeholders. Now the second part, the duties. I think one of the duties is "Diligence" which means careful consideration and due diligence. Because without proper due diligence, managers can't make sound decisions. So that's one part: diligence.

The second duty might be about "Care and Skill." Because without proper care and skill, the company can't function effectively. For example, without the right people, good management, and necessary processes, the company might not survive.

So putting it together: the first blank is "Stakeholders," the second is "Diligence," and the third is "Care and Skill." Looking at the options, that's option D: Stakeholders, Diligence, Care and Skill.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me think of what each term means. "Stakeholders" are people or groups who have an interest in the company, which could be shareholders, employees, customers, etc. So managers run the company in the best interest of these stakeholders.

Diligence is the process of careful consideration and due care and attention to all matters involved. So that makes the second duty.

Care and skill refers to the proper care of the company and the necessary skills to manage it effectively. So yes, that fits.

Looking back at the options, option D is "Stakeholders, Diligence, Care and Skill." So that should be the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is D: Stakeholders, Diligence, Care and Skill.

**Explanation:**
Managers are responsible for running the company in the best interest of stakeholders, who include shareholders, employees, customers, etc. They also have duties of due diligence and care and skill, ensuring proper evaluation and effective management.
