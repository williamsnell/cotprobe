Okay, so I have this question about Horner's theory on motivations, specifically about the motive to avoid success. I remember that Horner's work is related to gender differences in motivation, so maybe she studied how women approach their successes and failures. 

The question is asking about the definition of this Motive to Avoid Success, and then how she studied it in women. The options are A, B, C, D, and E (but the options stop at D). 

So, Horner's theory, if I recall, has two main parts about women's motivations. One was about avoiding success in other areas and then moving into more challenging ones. The other part was about not seeking more success because it would lead to dissatisfaction with their partners. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says the motive is to avoid success in other pursuits to gain more in emotional or relational areas. That sounds familiar. She probably looked into women's reasons for not striving higher in their lives and how that affects their relationships.

Option B says women are less ambitious. That doesn't sound right. I think Horner's work was more about the broader motivations rather than just individual ambition differences.

Option C suggests success leads to negative results. I'm not entirely sure. I don't think that's a central part of her theory. Instead, she focused more on the avoidance aspect.

Option D claims women believe success is unattainable. That doesn't align with what I remember. Her main focus was on the avoidance of success and the impact on relationships, not about believing success is impossible.

So putting it together, the correct definition is option A. Horner studied why women avoid high-impact, emotionally demanding tasks and instead focus on more personal or relational successes. She also looked into how this affects their relationships, leading to the idea that success for one can be negatively impacting their partners.

The correct answer is A. According to Horner's theory, the Motive to Avoid Success refers to women's inclination to choose less emotionally fulfilling tasks over more ambitious or personal pursuits. She studied this behavior and its effects on relationships, which led to the development of her theories.
