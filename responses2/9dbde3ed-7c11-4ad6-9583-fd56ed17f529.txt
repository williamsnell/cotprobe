Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this logic question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it. The question is asking about a specific type of fallacy that happens when an arguer asserts that unidentified experts accept a claim. The options given are A through J, each a different fallacy, and I need to pick which one applies.

First, let me recall what each of these terms means. 

Option A: Snob appeal. That's when someone relies on the assumption that others are more intelligent or knowledgeable than they really are. It's about assuming the other person's level of understanding.

Option B: Appeal to popularity. This is when someone uses the fact that a person is popular or well-known to support their argument. It's about appealing to the popularity of the arguer.

Option C: Post hoc ergo propter hoc. This is Latin for "after this, therefore because of this." It's a logical fallacy where someone assumes that what happened in the past will continue in the future. It's used to dismiss something by saying it happened by chance.

Option D: Appeal to anonymous authority. This is when someone seeks to argue by citing an authority who is anonymous or unknown. It's not just about the authority being anonymous but also about the argument being based on them.

Option E: Straw man. This is when someone presents an argument in such a way that it doesn't support the original argument but instead presents a completely different, but mistakenly similar, argument. The person trying to make the original point is trying to confuse the audience.

Option F: Ad vericundiam. I'm not familiar with this term. I think it might be a typo or misspelling. Perhaps it's referring to "ad verification" or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a less common term, but I'm not sure. It might be a variant of another fallacy, like ad hominem, but not exactly.

Option G: False dichotomy. This is when the arguer presents two options that are actually only related in a way that makes one seem like the other, but they aren't. It's a type of logical fallacy where the options don't present a clear contrast.

Option H: slippery slope. This is when someone presents an argument that escalates to a bad outcome, assuming each step is manageable. It's about the moral or logical impossibility of avoiding a dangerous situation.

Option I: Ad hominem. This is when someone attacks the arguer's character, reasons, or reasoning, rather than addressing the content of the argument. It's a specific type of argumentation fallacy.

Option J: Appeal to tradition. This is when someone uses the belief or practice of another group as a basis for arguing their position. It's about citing the tradition of a culture or group as the source of their argument.

So, the question is: When a claim is supported only by asserting that unidentified experts accept the claim, what fallacy is committed?

Looking at the scenario, the arguer is saying that experts they don't know accept the claim. This is about citing the acceptability of the experts they don't recognize. This doesn't seem to fit the standard fallacies I'm familiar with. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the different types of fallacies. Let's go through them one by one.

Snob appeal (A) is about assuming others are smarter or more knowledgeable. Not directly related.

Appeal to popularity (B) is about using someone's status to support an argument. Again, not directly about the expert's identity.

Post hoc ergo propter hoc (C) is about assuming that past events will repeat in the future, which is a logical fallacy. Not relevant here.

Appeal to anonymous authority (D) is about using an unknown or anonymous person to support the argument. So, the arguer is attacking the expert by citing them as anonymous, but in this scenario, the expert is unknown but is being cited as an expert. So, doesn't fit D.

Straw man (E) is when someone misrepresents an argument to make it easier to attack. Not the case here.

Ad vericundiam (F) is unclear. Maybe it's a typo for "ad verification"? Or perhaps it's referring to something else, like "ad verification" which I'm not familiar with.

False dichotomy (G) would involve two options that are only related in a way that one seems like the other. So, if the arguer presents two options that are similar, but not opposites, it's a false dichotomy.

Slippery slope (H) is when someone assumes that because the first step is bad, all steps must be bad. So, if the arguer is presenting a chain of events that would lead to a bad outcome, that's slippery slope.

Ad hominem (I) is attacking the arguer's character or reasoning, not about the identity of the experts.

Appeal to tradition (J) is when someone uses the belief or practice of another group. So, if the arguer is talking about an expert from another culture, that's J.

Wait, the question is about when the arguer is asserting that unidentified experts accept the claim. So, the arguer is using the fact that experts (unknown to them) accept the claim. So, this is about attacking the expert by citing their lack of identity as a reason to accept the claim. That sounds like appeal to anonymous authority (D). Because the arguer is attacking the expert's identity by citing it.

So, the fallacy here is appeal to anonymous authority. So the correct answer would be D.
</think>

The question revolves around a scenario where an arguer asserts that unidentified experts accept a claim, thereby committing a specific fallacy. The analysis of each option reveals that the correct fallacy is appeal to anonymous authority (D), as the arguer is attacking the expert by citing their lack of identity as a reason to accept the claim.

**Answer: D: appeal to anonymous authority**
