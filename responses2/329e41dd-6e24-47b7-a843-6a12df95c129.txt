Okay, so I've got this problem here about a swimming pool with a dye, and I need to find the time it takes for the concentration of the dye to reach a certain level. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me read the problem again. The pool has 60,000 gallons of water. There's a dye that's been contaminated, weighing 5 kg. Oh wait, wait, the units here are a bit confusing. The dye is 5 kg, but the concentration is asked in 0.02 g per gallon. Oh, I think I need to convert that because 5 kg is a lot. Let me note that: 5 kg is 5000 grams. So the concentration we're looking for is 0.02 g/gal.

The filtering system removes the dye at a flow rate of 200 gallons per minute. So, every minute, 200 gallons are moved from the pool to the filter and back, right? So, the system is continuously removing dye from the pool.

I think this is a classic differential equations problem. It's about the concentration changing over time as the dye is being filtered out. The initial concentration is 5 kg / 60,000 gal. Wait, that's 5000 g / 60,000 gal which simplifies to 1/12 g/gal, which is about 0.0833 g per gallon. But we're looking for when it reaches 0.02 g/gal, which is less than the initial concentration, so it's going to take some time.

The formula for the concentration as a function of time when a substance is being continuously removed at a rate proportional to the concentration is C(t) = C0 * e^(-kt), where k is the flow rate divided by the volume. Let me make sure I have that right. So, the flow rate is 200 gal/min. The volume is 60,000 gal. So, the rate at which the dye is removed is 200 gal/min, but the concentration is in g/gal. So, the removal rate is 200 * C(t) g/min. 

Wait, but the units for flow rate are in gallons per minute, but the concentration is in grams per gallon. So, the total amount of dye removed per minute is 200 gal/min * C(t) g/gal = 200*C(t) g/min. So, the differential equation would be dC/dt = - (200 / V) * C, where V is the volume. Because the removal rate is 200/V fraction of the current concentration.

So, the equation is dC/dt = - (200/V) * C, with V=60,000. So, V=6e4 gal.

So, the solution to this differential equation is C(t) = C0 * e^(-kt), where k is 200/V. So, let me compute k.

k = 200 / 60,000 = 1/300 per minute. Hmm, that seems right because 200/60000 = 1/300.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a unit mistake. Because 200 g/min is the amount removed? No, wait. Wait, the flow rate is in gallons per minute, but the concentration is in grams per gallon. So, the total amount of dye removed per minute is 200 gal/min * C_current(gal^-1) g/gal = 200*C_current g per minute. So, the rate of change of concentration is - (200*C)/V per minute, because V is the volume. So, the correct differential equation is dC/dt = - (200 / V) * C.

Therefore, the solution is:

C(t) = C0 * e^(- (200/V) * t )

So, substituting the numbers:

C0 is the initial concentration. The initial concentration is 5 kg / 60,000 gal = 5000 g / 60,000 gal = 5/60 gal^-1 = 1/12 ≈ 0.083333 g/gal.

We're looking for the time when C(t) = 0.02 g/gal.

So, setting up the equation:

0.02 = (1/12) * e^(- (200/60000) * t )

Let me compute (200/60000). 200 / 60000 = 1/300 ≈ 0.0033333 per minute.

So,

0.02 = (1/12) * e^(- (1/300) * t )

Multiply both sides by 12:

0.02 * 12 = e^(-t/300 )

0.24 = e^(-t/300 )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(0.24) = - t / 300

So,

t = -300 * ln(0.24)

Compute ln(0.24). Let me calculate that. I know that ln(0.2) is about -1.6094, ln(0.24) is a bit more negative. Let me compute it accurately.

Alternatively, using calculator steps:

ln(0.24) ≈ -1.427.

Wait, let me compute ln(0.24) more accurately.

Using calculator steps:

e^-1.427 ≈ 0.24?

Wait, let me compute:

e^1 is about 2.718. e^1.427 is about 4.15, so e^-1.427 is 1/4.15 ≈ 0.2407. Close enough to 0.24.

So, ln(0.24) ≈ -1.427.

So,

t = -300 * (-1.427) = 300 * 1.427 ≈ 428.1 minutes.

Wait, 428.1 minutes is how many hours? 428 /60 ≈ 7.1333 hours.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.000 hours, D is 6.875, E is 8.255, F is 9.100, G is 7.136, H is 8.670, I is 5.320, J is 7.780.

So, 7.133 hours is closest to option G, which is 7.136. So, option G is the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial concentration is 5 kg / 60,000 gal = 0.0833333 g/gal.

At time t, the concentration is 0.02 g/gal.

So,

0.02 = (1/12) * e^(- (200/60000) t )

Which is 0.02 = (1/12) e^(- t/(300) )

Multiply both sides by 12:

0.24 = e^(-t/300 )

Take ln:

ln(0.24) = - t/(300)

So,

t = -300 * ln(0.24 )

Calculate ln(0.24):

Let me compute using calculator steps:

ln(0.24) = ln(24e-2) = ln(24) - 2*ln(10). ln(24) is about 3.178, ln(10) is about 2.3026.

So, 3.178 - 2*(2.3026) = 3.178 - 4.6052 ≈ -1.4272.

So, ln(0.24) ≈ -1.4272.

Thus,

t = -300*(-1.4272) = 300 * 1.4272 ≈ 428.16 minutes.

Convert to hours: 428.16 /60 = 7.136 hours. So, yes, option G: 7.136 hours.

So, the correct answer is G.

To solve the problem, we model the concentration of dye in the pool using a first-order differential equation. The initial concentration is 0.083333 g/gal, and we need to find the time when it reaches 0.02 g/gal. The flow rate is 200 gal/min, and the pool volume is 60,000 gal. The differential equation is:

\[
\frac{dC}{dt} = -\frac{200}{60000}C = -\frac{1}{300}C
\]

The solution is:

\[
C(t) = C_0 e^{-\frac{1}{300}t}
\]

Substituting \( C_0 = \frac{1}{12} \, \text{g/gal} \) and \( C(t) = 0.02 \, \text{g/gal} \):

\[
0.02 = \frac{1}{12} e^{-\frac{1}{300}t}
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
0.02 \cdot 12 = e^{-\frac{1}{300}t} \implies 0.24 = e^{-\frac{1}{300}t}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(0.24) = -\frac{1}{300}t \implies t = -300 \ln(0.24)
\]

Using \( \ln(0.24) \approx -1.427 \):

\[
t = 300 \cdot 1.427 \approx 428.1 \, \text{minutes}
\]

Converting to hours:

\[
t \approx 428.1 / 60 \approx 7.136 \, \text{hours}
\]

Thus, the time \( T \) is approximately **7.136 hours**, corresponding to option **G**.
