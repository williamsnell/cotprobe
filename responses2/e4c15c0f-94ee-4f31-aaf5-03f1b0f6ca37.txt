Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question says: A -10.00 diopters biconcave lens has 12 cm radii of curvature for either surface. What is the refractive index of the glass? The options are A to J, with various numbers between 1.3 and 2.1.

Hmm. I remember that the lens formula is related to the focal length, but wait, I think it's the lensmaker's equation that's more accurate for refractive indices. Oh right, the lensmaker's equation considers the curvature of the surfaces.

Wait, biconcave means both surfaces are concave. So each surface has a radius of curvature of 12 cm. But wait, since it's biconcave, I should be careful with the sign conventions for the radii here. Because for a biconcave lens, both surfaces are concave. The lens maker's equation might be different for concave as compared to convex. Let me recall the formula.

The lensmaker's equation is: 1/f = (n - 1) * [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

Wait, but wait. Let me get the exact formula right. I think it's (n-1) multiplied by the sum of (1/R1 and 1/R2), but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The general formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ] when the lens is convex. But for a biconcave lens, both R1 and R2 would be negative because concave surfaces have negative radii. So let me plug in the values correctly.

Wait, the first thing I need is the focal length. Because the diopter is the reciprocal of the focal length. So if the diopter is -10.00 (since it's a biconcave lens, the focal length should be negative), then the focal length f is 1/diopter, which is -1/10 m. Because 1 diopter is 1 m^-1. So f is -10 cm, which is -0.1 meters.

Wait, 1 diopter is 1 m^-1, so 1 diopter is 1 meter. Wait, no, wait. diopters are in units of 1/m. So, a lens that is -10 diopters would have f = -1/10 = -0.1 meters, which is -10 cm. Right.

So f = -10 cm, which is -0.1 m.

Now, the radii of curvature: each surface is 12 cm. Since they are concave, R would be negative. Let me write R1 and R2 as -12 cm each because both surfaces are concave. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if the lens is biconcave, each radius is positive, but wait, no. Wait, when you have a concave surface, the radius is positive. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me clarify: For a convex lens, each radius is positive. For a concave lens, each radius is negative. So yes, in this case, both R1 and R2 are negative because the lens is concave.

Wait, but in the lensmaker's formula, R1 and R2 are the radii of the first and second surfaces, regardless of whether they are convex or concave. So if the lens is biconcave, both are concave. So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = -12 cm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, I think that's not correct. Wait, the sign depends on the direction of the radius. But perhaps I should be using the formula correctly.

Wait, another approach: the lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ].

But wait, I think I should double-check. For a biconcave lens, the formula for the focal length is f = -n R / (n-1), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the lensmaker's equation correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the lens formula. The lens formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2) for a convex lens (R1 and R2 positive). For a biconcave lens, both R1 and R2 are negative, so 1/R1 and 1/R2 are negative. Let me plug in the values.

So, f = -0.1 m (since 10 diopters is 10 m^-1, f = 1/10 = 0.1 m, but since it's concave, f is negative: -0.1 m.)

So, 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ] for a double convex lens. For a biconcave lens, it's (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ) ]? No, wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify.

Wait, for a biconvex lens, both radii are positive, so R1 and R2 are +12 cm. So the equation becomes 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). Because the second term is subtracted.

For a biconcave lens, both R1 and R2 are negative. So 1/R1 and 1/R2 are negative. So the equation becomes 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2) = (n-1)( [1/(-12cm)] - [1/(-12cm)] ) = (n-1)( (-1/12) - (-1/12 )) = (n-1)(0) which can't be right. Wait that can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait a second. No, because in the case of biconcave, the surface radii are negative, so 1/R1 and 1/R2 are negative. So substituting:

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ] 
= (n-1) [ (1/(-12 cm)) - (1/(-12 cm)) ]
= (n-1) [ (-1/12) - (-1/12) ]
= (n-1) [ (-1/12 +1/12 ) ] 
= (n-1) * 0 = 0, which can't be right. That can't be correct, so I must have made a mistake in the formula. 

Wait no, I think I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me correct. The lensmaker's formula for a double convex lens is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). For a double concave lens, both surfaces are concave, so R1 and R2 are negative. Let me write R1 = -12 cm, R2 = -12 cm.

So substituting into the formula:

1/f = (n -1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

= (n-1) [ (1/(-12) cm) - (1/(-12 cm)) ]

= (n-1) [ (-1/12) - (-1/12) ] 

= (n-1) [ (-1/12 + 1/12) ]

= (n-1)(0) = 0.

Wait, that's not possible. So I must have the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I had the formula for a convex lens reversed. Let me think again. Wait, for a convex lens, the radii R1 and R2 are positive, so 1/R1 and 1/R2 are positive. Then 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). 

For a concave lens, both R1 and R2 are negative, so 1/R1 and 1/R2 are negative. Then, for a biconcave lens, 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2) 

= (n-1)( [1/(-12)] - [1/(-12)] )

= (n-1)( (-1/12) - (-1/12) )

= (n-1)( (-1/12 + 1/12) )

= (n-1)(0) = 0.

Wait, that again gives 1/f=0. Which would mean f is infinity, which is not possible. So perhaps the formula is incorrect for concave surfaces. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the focal length of a biconvex and biconcave lens differently.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for a biconcave lens as a double concave lens. Let's think about it: a double concave lens is the same as a single concave lens, but with both surfaces curved. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2). Let me try that.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me look up the formula again.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think differently. The lensmaker's equation for a lens made of a material with refractive index n is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ].

Wait, that can't be right because for a convex lens, both R are positive, and the formula gives 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 +1/R2). So for a convex lens, that's correct. But for a biconcave lens, both R1 and R2 are negative, so 1/R1 and 1/R2 are negative. So:

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ]

= (n-1) [ (-1/12) + (-1/12) ]

= (n-1)( (-2)/12 )

= (n-1)(-1/6 )

So 1/f = (n-1)(-1/6 )

But f is negative, so 1/f is negative. Let's plug in the value of 1/f.

We know the lens is a biconcave lens, so f is negative. The diopter is -10.00, so f = -0.1 m = -10 cm.

So 1/f = -10 cm^-1 = -0.1 m^-1.

Wait, but wait, 1/f in meters. Let me convert to meters.

f = -0.1 m. So 1/f is -10 m^-1.

So according to the equation:

-10 m^-1 = (n-1) [ (-1/12 m) + (-1/12 m) ]

= (n-1) [ (-2/12) m ]

= (n-1) ( -1/6 m )

So:

-10 = (n-1) * (-1/6 )

Multiply both sides by (-6):

-10 * (-6) = (n-1) * (-1/6 ) * (-6 )

60 = (n-1) * (1) 

So 60 = n-1

n = 61.

Wait, but that's a very high refractive index, over 60. But the options are up to 2.1, so that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm. Maybe I had the formula wrong. Let me try again. I think the formula for the lensmaker's equation for the biconcave lens is different. Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ]

But if R1 and R2 are both -12 cm, then:

1/f = (n-1) [ (-1/12) + (-1/12) ] = (n-1) * (-2/12) = (n-1)(-1/6 )

So 1/f = (n-1)(-1/6 )

We know that 1/f is negative, as f is negative.

So 1/f = - (n-1) (1/6 )

But since 1/f = -10 m^-1,

-10 = - (n-1) (1/6 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

10 = (n-1) (1/6 )

Multiply both sides by 6:

60 = n-1

So n=61. But the given options don't have n=61; the maximum is 2.1. So that can't be right. So I must have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the sign wrong. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, for a biconcave lens, each radius is negative. So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = -12 cm.

The lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n -1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ) ].

Wait, perhaps I should be subtracting R2 from R1. Let me see. The formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ].

Wait, but if R1 and R2 are both -12 cm:

1/R1 = (-1/12) cm^-1

1/R2 = (-1/12) cm^-1

So:

1/f = (n-1) [ (-1/12) - (-1/12) ]

= (n-1) [ (-1/12 + 1/12) ]

= (n-1)(0) = 0.

Again, that gives 1/f=0, which is impossible. So I'm clearly making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ] for convex lenses and 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ] for concave. No, wait that doesn't make sense. Let's think again.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Maybe the lens is biconcave, so each radius is 12 cm, but negative.

So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = -12 cm.

The lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ]

Wait, 1/R1 = (-1/12) cm^-1, same for R2.

So 1/f = (n-1) [ (-1/12) + (-1/12) ] = (n-1) [ (-2/12) ] = (n-1)(-1/6 )

Thus,

1/f = - (n-1)/6 

But f is -0.1 m (since 1 diopter is 1 m^-1, so -10 diopters is -0.1 m).

So,

-0.1 m^-1 = - (n-1)/6 

Multiply both sides by (-1):

0.1 = (n-1)/6 

Multiply both sides by 6:

0.6 = n-1 → n = 1.6

Wait, 1.6 is one of the options. Option F is 1.6. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check all the steps.

So, f= -0.1 m.

1/f = -10 m^-1.

The formula: 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ]

R1 = -12 cm = -0.12 m.

So 1/R1 = 1/(-0.12) = -8.333... m^-1.

Same for R2.

So 1/R1 + 1/R2 = (-8.333)+(-8.333)= -16.666 m^-1.

So,

1/f = (n-1) * (-16.666 )

We know 1/f is -10.

Thus,

-10 = (n-1)*(-16.666 )

Divide both sides by (-16.666):

(-10)/(-16.666) = (n-1)

10/16.666 ≈ 0.6.

So, n-1 = 0.6 → n = 1.6.

Which matches option F (1.6). So the correct answer is F: 1.6.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the lensmaker's equation, which relates the focal length of a lens to its refractive index and the radii of its surfaces. For a biconcave lens, both surfaces are concave, so the radii of curvature are negative. The formula is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert units
The diopter is given as -10.00, which means the focal length \( f \) is:
\[
f = \frac{1}{\text{diopter}} = \frac{1}{-10.00} = -0.1 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute values into the lensmaker's equation
The radii of curvature are \( R_1 = -12 \, \text{cm} \) and \( R_2 = -12 \, \text{cm} \). Converting these to meters:
\[
R_1 = R_2 = -0.12 \, \text{m}
\]

The reciprocals of the radii are:
\[
\frac{1}{R_1} = \frac{1}{-0.12} = -8.333 \, \text{m}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{-0.12} = -8.333 \, \text{m}^{-1}
\]

Adding these:
\[
\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} = -8.333 - 8.333 = -16.666 \, \text{m}^{-1}
\]

Substituting into the lensmaker's equation:
\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)
\]

\[
-10 = (n - 1)(-16.666)
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( n \)
Divide both sides by \(-16.666\):
\[
\frac{-10}{-16.666} = n - 1
\]

\[
0.6 = n - 1
\]

Add 1 to both sides:
\[
n = 1.6
\]

### Final Answer
The refractive index of the glass is 1.6, which corresponds to option **F**.
