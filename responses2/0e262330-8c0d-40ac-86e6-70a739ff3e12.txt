Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the UK Constitution, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking which statement best describes the UK Constitution. The options are A through J, each making a different claim about the constitution.

First, I need to recall what I know about the UK Constitution. I remember that the UK Constitution is the supreme law of the country, and it's the one that's written in English. It's also the most authoritative document in the country. So, the first thing that comes to mind is that the UK Constitution is the main source of power. That makes me think option I says something like that. Let me look at the options.

Option I says, "The UK Constitution's only source of power is that of the sovereign." Oh, that's interesting. So, it's talking about the UK's sovereignty as the sole source of power. I think that's correct because the UK is a republic, and the sovereign power means the people have the power to make laws.

Looking at the other options to see if any of them could also be correct. Option A says it's a direct copy of the US Constitution. I don't think so. The US Constitution is written in English too, but it's a different document and not the same as the UK's. Plus, the UK doesn't have a direct copy; it's codified and part of a larger document. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: "The UK Constitution is codified and contained in a single document." That sounds like it's referring to the Bill of Rights, which is part of the Bill of Rights Act. Wait, no, the Bill of Rights is part of the UK's framework, but the actual constitution itself is separate. So I think B is incorrect because the UK Constitution isn't codified into a single document. The Bill of Rights is part of the Bill of Rights Act, which is another document.

Option C: "The UK Constitution can be changed by a simple majority vote in Parliament." That doesn't ring a bell. I remember that the UK Constitution is the most accurate and widely recognized document, so changing it would require a very broad majority and probably a constitutional amendment. So this seems incorrect.

Option D: "The UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament." That doesn't make sense. The judiciary in the UK is supposed to be independent and not have the power to overturn parliamentary actions. In fact, the judiciary has the power to interpret the constitution and to hold the government accountable. So D is wrong.

Option E: "The UK Constitution's power is derived solely from Parliament." No, that's not right. The power comes from the sovereign, which includes the supreme law, the Bill of Rights, and so on. Parliaments have the power to make laws, but the power isn't solely derived from them. So E is incorrect.

Option F: "The UK Constitution's power is derived solely from Parliament." Wait, this is similar to E. No, same issue. It's not just from Parliament. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "The UK Constitution is based entirely on European Union law." I don't think so. The UK Constitution doesn't come from the EU. It's based on English law and its own civil and criminal code. So G is wrong.

Option H: "The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources." Wait, codified means it's part of a larger document. The UK Constitution is codified under the Bill of Rights Act, which is a separate document. So H is incorrect.

Option J: "The UK Constitution is based solely on common law." I don't believe that's correct. Common law is a subset of the UK's legal system, but the UK Constitution includes a lot more, including the Bill of Rights, civil law, criminal law, etc. So J is wrong.

So, reviewing all options, the only one that makes sense is option I. The UK Constitution's only source of power is the sovereignty of the people. That's a key point about the UK. So the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is I.

**Answer: I**
