Okay, so I have this question about the 1960s 'Batman' TV series and which guest villain wasn't actually a guest character. I remember that 'Batman' is a series where the main villain is Batman, but there are other characters who guest appear as antagonists or villains. The question is asking which one wasn't actually a guest. 

I think the main villain is Batman, but there are other characters like The Painter and The Librarian who guest as villains. Wait, did those characters appear in the 1960s series? I'm a bit hazy on that. Let me think. 

The Painter is a character who lived in the 1960s, right? He's a former artist and a street cleaner, I believe. He was a guest. The Librarian was another character from the 60s. She was a judge in the city and guest as a villain. So those two were there. 

Then there's The Squeegee Guy. I think he was a guest. He was a character in the show, and he was known for his role as a villain. So that's not the one. Wait, the options include him as F. The Chef, G. The Squeegee Guy. So the question is about the one who wasn't a guest. 

Wait, the options are A to J. So the question is asking which guest villain wasn't actually in the series. So we need to eliminate the ones that were guest villains. 

The main villain is Batman, but the question is about who wasn't a guest. So the other characters: The Painter, the Librarian, the Squeegee Guy, the Bookworm, etc.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to remember the main characters. The main villain is Batman, but there are other antagonists. The Squeegy Guy was a guest villain, right? He was a character in the show. So he was a guest. So the other options: The Painter, the Librarian, the Bookworm, the Jester, the Archer, the Gardener, the Plot, the Squeegee Guy, etc.

Wait, the question is about the one who wasn't a guest villain. So the Squeegy Guy was a guest, so F is out. The main villain is Batman, so I don't think he was a guest. The others: The Painter, the Librarian, The Bookworm, the Archer, etc. The Jester was in the show, but he was a helper, not a villain. So he was a guest but not a villain. So he wouldn't have been a guest villain. But wait, the question is specifically about guest villains, so if someone was a guest but not a villain, he wouldn't be a guest villain. So the Squeegy Guy was a guest villain, so he's not the one. 

Wait, the question is: "who was not a guest villain?" So the guest villain is Batman, but the others are the ones who were guest antagonists. So the answer is the one who was a guest but not an antagonist. 

So, The Painter was a guest, but he was an antagonist. The Librarian was a guest, antagonist. The Squeegy Guy was a guest and antagonist. The Bookworm was a guest, but was he an antagonist? I think the Bookworm was a guest but not an antagonist. He was a character in the show but didn't play a role as a villain. So the Bookworm was a guest but not a villain. So he wasn't a guest villain. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The main antagonist is Batman, but other characters took on antagonist roles. So the answer is the one who was a guest but not a villain. So the options are The Painter, The Librarian, The Squeegy Guy, The Bookworm, The Archer, The Jester, The Gardener, The Plot, and the Jester again. 

Wait, the Jester was a helper, not a villain. So if the question is about a guest who wasn't a villain, J is the answer. But I thought the Squeegy Guy was a guest villain. So perhaps I was wrong about that.

I think the correct answer is the Jester, because he was a guest but not a villain. So the Jester was a guest but didn't play a role as a villain. So he wasn't a guest villain. So the correct answer would be J, the Jester. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me try to remember. Alternatively, perhaps the Painter was a guest but not a villain, but wait, the Painter was a villain. So perhaps the Jester is the answer.

The Jester was the character who was a guest but not a villain. His role was as a helper, not as an antagonist. 

Answer: J
