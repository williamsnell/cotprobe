Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about whether treaties should assume a particular form. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. It's asking whether treaties need to be designated as such or not, and if they assume a form. The options are A through J, each with different statements.

I remember from my studies that treaties are usually considered as official agreements between states. The key here is the designations. Treaties are often classified as acts of war, treaties, or acts of peace. The classification isn't a strict binary; it's more about the form they take.

Option A says treaties don't need to be designated and must have a particular form. Wait, that doesn't seem right. I think some treaties require specific forms, like treaties of war, which have particular wording. Also, some might be acts of peace, which are more general.

Option B claims treaties should always be written in legal language regardless of form. That seems off. I remember that treaties can have a mix of legal and common language, but they aren't just written in legal language. Also, some might be in the form of treaties of war, which are more formal.

Option C suggests they should assume a particular form without any designation. That doesn't sound right either. Treaties can vary widely, so there's no one "particular form" they must follow unilaterally.

Option D says they should be designated as such and assume a particular form. That might make sense. Designations like "act of war" or "act of peace" guide their form and formality. So they have to be designated and follow a specific structure.

Option E says they don't need to assume a form or be designated. That doesn't fit because I've heard that some treaties are written in legal language and others are more formal. There's no such thing as a designation without a form.

Option F says they shouldn't be designated and assume a form. That doesn't sound correct because designations guide the form. So, if they aren't designated, they might not have a form.

Option G states designations are necessary, but they don't have to assume a particular form. But wait, designations do imply a form. So this might be incorrect because designations are part of their form.

Option H says they have to be designated as such regardless of form. Again, designations are part of their form, so this is contradictory.

Option I says they should be designated and assume a form. That makes sense because designations provide a framework, and assuming a form (like what kind of treaty) dictates how they're written.

Option J says they can assume any form but must be signed. That's incorrect because not all forms are legally binding. Also, designations are important to guide the form.

So, looking back, the correct answer should be I. Treaties should be designated as such and assume a particular form.

The correct answer is I. Treaties should be designated as such and assume a particular form.

**Answer: I**
