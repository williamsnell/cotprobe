Question:

The state registrar of elections refused to put a candidate's name on the ballot because the registrar believed that the candidate was not a resident of the state. The registrar contended that Article I, Section 2 of the U. S. Constitution specifically required a candidate for the House of Representatives "be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. " As a consequence, the candidate filed suit in state court against the registrar of elections seeking to have her name placed on the ballot. The state court ruled in her favor and determined that the candidate did, in fact, qualify as a resident of the state. The registrar appealed the decision to the state supreme court which, in turn, affirmed the lower court ruling. Thereafter, the candidate's name was placed on the ballot. After a hotly contested election, the candidate narrowly defeated the incumbent. However, at the time that the candidate was to be seated as a House member, the House of Representatives held hearings on her qualifications and eligibility. By a two-thirds vote, the House determined that the candidate was not a resident of the state at the time of her election and refused to seat her. The candidate then brought suit in federal district court against the Speaker and other officers of the House, seeking back pay and an order that she be seated in the House of Representatives. The defendants demurred, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer?

Options:

A: The suit should have been brought as an original action in the U. S. Supreme Court.
B: The federal court cannot intervene because it would disrupt the separation of powers.
C: Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are not empowered to render advisory opinions.
D: The candidate lacks standing to sue because she was never officially a member of the House of Representatives.
E: The case should have been filed in the state court where the original residency determination was made.
F: The federal court lacks jurisdiction because the House of Representatives has exclusive authority to determine the qualifications of its members.
G: The case is moot because the term of office for which the candidate was elected has already ended.
H: There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.
I: The candidate's claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
J: The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about the Supreme Court's decision regarding the candidate's case. The main issue is whether the Supreme Court (the defendant) can grant a demurrer after the House of Representatives has already taken action.

First, I remember that the U.S. Constitution has something about judicial review. The 13th Amendment, I think, allows the Supreme Court to review judicial actions but not necessarily every action. Oh wait, no, the 13th Amendment specifically allows the Court to review the highest court's decisions, like the Supreme Court, but not every state court. So, if a state court ruled the candidate's residency, the Supreme Court can't just look at that state court's decision as the final word. They can only review those cases that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over.

Looking at the options, option A says the suit should be brought as an original action in the Supreme Court. But wait, I thought Supreme Court can't do that. The 13th Amendment prohibits the state courts from reviewing the Supreme Court's decisions. So Option A is suggesting that, which would be against the 13th Amendment. So A might not be correct.

Option B says the federal court can't intervene because it disrupts the separation of powers. Oh, right, the 13th Amendment prohibits the federal courts from reviewing state court decisions. So the Supreme Court can't do that either, so B says the federal court can't, which would be correct. But the question is about the Supreme Court's demurrer. Option B is about the federal court's jurisdiction, which isn't directly relevant to why the Supreme Court can't grant a demurrer.

Option C says the Supreme Court isn't empowered to render advisory opinions under Article III. I'm not sure about this one. Article III is about the power of the Supreme Court, which includes the power to declare war, as long as it's not for a war of convenience. So, the Supreme Court is empowered to make its own rulings, but not to give advice. So C might not be correct. The Supreme Court can't grant a demurrer because it's not a matter of jurisdiction, but this is about the original question.

Option D says the candidate lacks standing because she wasn't a member at the time. Wait, when she filed the suit, she was a candidate for the House. The House had a two-thirds vote saying she wasn't a resident at the time. But the Supreme Court now is sitting on a determination that the House made before she could even get to the Supreme Court. So, the resident determination was made when she was in her seat, not when the original suit was filed. So the resident issue is only relevant when she's a candidate now. So standing is about being eligible, but the original residency was after she was a candidate, so she wasn't eligible at the time she was a candidate. So D says she lacks standing because she wasn't a member at the time of the election. Wait, but she was a candidate in the election, so she was eligible. Unless the issue was about whether she was a candidate for the House of Representatives, but the original test was about residency.

Wait, but the question is about the Supreme Court's ability to grant a demurrer. So the Supreme Court's individual decisions are about the original state court's case. So the resident issue was when she was a candidate, but the Supreme Court's case was about her eligibility at the time of her election. So, if she wasn't a resident at the time of her election, then standing is an issue. But in this case, the House had a two-thirds vote saying she wasn't a resident. But her election was after the House's vote. So the resident issue was about her eligibility when she was a candidate, but the Supreme Court's case was about her eligibility when she was a member of the House of Representatives. So the resident determination was made when she was a member, not when she was a candidate. So standing is whether she was eligible when she was a candidate. But the original resident determination was made when she was in her seat. So the resident issue is about eligibility at the time of the election, which is after she was a member. So the resident issue was when she was a member, not when she was a candidate. So, standing applies when she's a candidate. So, if she wasn't a resident at the time she was a candidate, then she lacks standing. But the original residency was about when she was a member, not when she was a candidate. So D says she lacks standing because she wasn't a member at the time of the election. Wait, but the election was after she was a member. So the resident issue is about her eligibility at the time of the election, which was when the House had already made a two-thirds vote saying she wasn't a resident. So, standing would require that she was a resident at the time of the election. If she wasn't, she's not a candidate at that time, so the case is moot. But if the House had a two-thirds vote, but she wasn't a member at the time of the election, then she didn't even be a candidate at that time. So the resident issue was when she was a member, not when she was a candidate. So the original residency was when she was a member, not when she was a candidate. Therefore, standing applies when she's a candidate, which she wasn't at the time of the election. So D says she lacks standing because she wasn't a member at the time. But her election happened after she was a member. So the resident issue was at the time of the election, so she wasn't a member then. So she wasn't a resident at the time of the election, so standing is an issue. But the question is about the Supreme Court's ability to grant a demurrer. So the resident determination was made when she was a member, but the Supreme Court's decision was based on her election status. So the resident issue is not relevant anymore because she wasn't a member when the original suit was filed. So the resident determination is irrelevant because the election happened after she was a member. So, for the Supreme Court to grant a demurrer, the issue must be one of jurisdiction. The question is whether the Supreme Court can review the House's election decision.

The 13th Amendment prohibits the federal courts from reviewing the decisions of state courts. So the Supreme Court can't render a declaration that the House member was not a resident as final. So if the Supreme Court is reviewing a case that was decided by a state court, they can't do that. So the Supreme Court's original decision was a state court decision. The state court ruled her not a resident, and the Supreme Court can't grant a demurrer because it's not a matter of state jurisdiction. So the Supreme Court (defendant) can't do that because it's not a state court case. So option B says the federal court can't intervene, but that's not correct because the Supreme Court can only review state court decisions. So the Supreme Court can't grant a demurrer because it's not the same as a state court decision. So option B is incorrect.

Wait, the question is about the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer. So the key point is about whether the Supreme Court can review a state court's decision. The 13th Amendment says the federal courts can't review state court decisions. So the Supreme Court's original decision by the state court can't be reviewed by the Supreme Court. So the candidate's case can't be dismissed by the Supreme Court because it's not a state court case. So the Supreme Court can't grant a demurrer because it's not a matter of state jurisdiction. So the argument is that the Supreme Court can't do that, which is option B. Wait, but option B says the federal court can't, but that's incorrect because the Supreme Court can only review state court decisions. So the correct answer is B because it's about the 13th Amendment which prohibits the federal courts from reviewing state court decisions. So the Supreme Court can't grant a demurrer because it's not a state court case.

The Supreme Court's inability to grant a demurrer in this case stems from the constitutional prohibition of the 13th Amendment, which prohibits federal courts from reviewing the decisions of state courts. Specifically, the Supreme Court cannot render advisory opinions or declare a case ruled by a state court because those decisions are not within the purview of federal jurisdiction. In this scenario, the state court ruled the candidate's residency, and the Supreme Court is now reviewing the merits of the case. Since the decision was made by a state court, the Supreme Court cannot grant a demurrer as it is not a matter of state jurisdiction. 

The correct answer is:

**B: The federal court cannot intervene because it would disrupt the separation of powers.**
