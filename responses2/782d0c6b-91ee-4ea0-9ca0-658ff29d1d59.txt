Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Which of the following is (are) true about virtual memory systems that use pages?
I. The virtual address space can be larger than the amount of physical memory.
II. Programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution.
III. Pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program.

Options:

A: I and III
B: None of the above
C: All of the above
D: I and II and not III
E: I, II and III
F: III only
G: I only
H: II and III
I: I and II
J: II only

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about virtual memory systems using pages are true. There are three statements, I, II, and III. Let me think through each one.

Statement I: The virtual address space can be larger than the physical memory. Hmm, I remember that virtual memory allows programs to access memory that's physically not there. So the virtual address space would be much larger than the physical memory. For example, if you have 1GB of physical memory, the virtual address space is much bigger, like 40GB or something. So I think I is true.

Statement II: Programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution. Wait, programs do run on physical memory, but in a virtual memory system, I think they can be kept in RAM (resident) or swapped out to disk if necessary. So just because I'm on a virtual address space doesn't mean I can't run the program from main memory. So II is false. For example, a program might run in RAM, then swap to the disk if needed. So II is not necessarily true.

Statement III: Pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program. No, that doesn't sound right. In page-based memory systems, each page is identified by an address, not by semantic. The address is the main part. So pages are just like any other memory address. So III is false. So a program's pages are just their location in memory, not tied to what the program does.

So evaluating each statement:

I: True
II: False
III: False

Looking at the options, the question is which of the following are true. So the correct answer would be only statement I is true.

Looking at the options:

A: I and III → both wrong
B: None of the above → not correct since I is true
C: All of the above → III is wrong
D: I and II and not III → II is wrong, III wrong
E: I, II and III → all wrong
F: III only → wrong
G: I only → correct
H: II and III → wrong
I: I and II → II wrong
J: II only → wrong

So the correct answer is G: I only.

The correct answer is G: I only.
