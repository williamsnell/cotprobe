Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the horsepower needed to drive a load. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on my mechanical engineering, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the load is being driven at 1750 RPM and requires a torque of 60 lb. ft. I remember that power in a driven system is calculated using the formula Power = Torque × RPM, but I'm not sure about the units. Oh wait, torque is in lb. ft, RPM is revolutions per minute, and power is usually in horsepower.

Wait, no, wait. Horsepower is a unit of power, and the formula for power is work done divided by time. Since torque is force times radius, and RPM relates to the speed, I think the formula is Torque (in lb. ft) multiplied by RPM, but then divided by some conversion factor to get horsepower because the units don't match.

Let me think: 1 horsepower (hp) is equivalent to 550 foot-pounds per second (ft-lbs/s). So, I need to convert the power from the given units (lb. ft and RPM) into horsepower.

So the formula I think I need is Horsepower = (Torque (lb. ft) × RPM) / 550.

Wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. Oh right, the formula is Power (hp) = (Torque (lb. ft) × RPM) / 33000. Because 1 hp is 550 ft-lb/s, and 1 revolution per minute is 60 RPM, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of converting the units correctly.

Wait, no. Let's approach it step by step.

Power (in ft-lb/s) is Torque (lb. ft) × RPM (since torque is force times radius, and RPM is the number of rotations). But wait, RPM is per minute, so to get per second, we divide by 60.

So, power in ft-lb/s is Torque (lb. ft) × RPM / 60.

Then, to convert that to horsepower, divide by 550 (since 1 hp is 550 ft-lb/s).

So putting it together: Power (hp) = (Torque × RPM) / (60 × 550).

Wait, let me write that formula again. 

Power (hp) = (Torque (lb. ft) × RPM) / (60 × 550)

Because:

Torque × RPM gives us ft-lb per minute. Because torque is lb-ft, RPM is per minute, so ft-lb × RPM = ft-lb per minute.

Then, to get it in ft-lb per second, divide by 60.

Then, to convert from ft-lb per second to horsepower (which is in ft-lb per second), we divide by 550.

So the formula is:

Power = (60 lb. ft × 1750 RPM) / (60 × 550)

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

Numerator: 60 × 1750 = 105,000

Denominator: 60 × 550 = 33,000

So Power = 105,000 / 33,000 ≈ 3.1818 horsepower.

Wait, that's about 3.18 hp. But looking at the options, the closest option is A:15 hp, which is way higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another approach: Maybe the formula is (Torque × RPM) / 550, which would be (60 × 1750)/550.

Let's compute that:

60 × 1750 = 105,000

Divide by 550: 105,000 / 550 = 190.909... approximately 191 horsepower. That's way higher than the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I remembered the formula wrong. Let me check another way. 

I think the correct formula is: Horsepower = (Torque (lb. ft) × RPM) / (550 × 60). Wait, no, I think I confused it. Let me think again.

I know that 1 horsepower is 550 foot-pounds per second. So if I have a power in foot-pounds per minute, that's 60 times per second.

So if I have torque (lb. ft) × RPM = (ft·lb) × (revolutions per minute). To get per second, divide by 60. Then, convert to horsepower by dividing by 550.

So the formula is: (Torque × RPM) / (60 × 550).

Wait, let me try that again.

Power in hp = (Torque (lb-ft) × RPM) / (550 × 60)

Wait, but that would be (60 × 1750) / (550 × 60). The 60s would cancel, so 1750 / 550 = 3.1818... which is about 3.18 hp. Hmm, but none of the options are that low. The options start at 5 hp.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is (Torque × RPM) / 550, without dividing by 60.

Wait, let's think about this: Torque in lb-ft, speed in RPM. So the power in ft-lb/s is Torque × RPM, but divided by 60 because RPM is per minute.

So Power (ft-lb/s) = (Torque × RPM) / 60.

Then, to convert to horsepower, divide by 550:

Horsepower = [(Torque × RPM) / 60] / 550 = (Torque × RPM) / (60 × 550) = (60 × 1750) / (60 × 550) = 1750 / 550 ≈ 3.18 hp. 

But that's not matching the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look it up in my notes.

Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula because the correct formula is (Torque × RPM) / 550. Because, 550 ft-lb per second is 1 hp. So the correct formula is Power (hp) = (Torque (lb-ft) × RPM) / 550.

Wait, no, because then 60 × 1750 divided by 550. Let's compute that.

60 × 1750 = 105,000.

105,000 / 550 ≈ 190.909 hp. That's way higher than the options.

Wait, but that's not one of the options provided. The options are all around 5 hp. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (Torque × RPM) / (33000), and 33000 is 550 × 60. Let me try that.

60 × 1750 = 105,000.

105,000 / 33,000 ≈ 3.18 hp. Still same result.

Wait, but none of the options are that low. The options start at 5 hp. So this suggests that perhaps the question is using a different unit.

Wait another thing: sometimes, people confuse RPM with angular velocity in radians per second. Let me think. Oh wait, RPM is revolutions per minute, not radians per second. So the formula is correct.

Wait, unless the question is talking about the torque in other units. Like, maybe the torque is given in kilopound feet or something. Let me recheck the question. 

The question says torque is 60 lb. ft. So unit is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the units differently. Let me think: 1 horsepower is 550 lb-ft per second.

So, the power is 60 lb-ft × 1750 RPM.

But RPM is per minute. So 1750 RPM is 1750 revolutions per minute, which equals 1750/60 revolutions per second.

So 60 lb-ft × (1750/60) rev/s = 60 × (1750/60) = 1750 lb-ft·rev/s.

But 1 revolution is 1 lb-ft (about), so 1750 lb-ft·rev/s equals 1750 lb-ft·ft/s? Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, 1 revolution is 2π radians, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, 1 revolution = 1 foot-lb? No, that's incorrect. Wait, 1 foot pound is the work done when you apply a force of 1 pound to move an object 1 foot. So 1 lb-ft is 1 ft·lb. But in terms of torque and RPM, the power is Torque × RPM.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the power in foot-pounds per second, then divide by 550 to get horsepower.

So, power in ft-lb/s is Torque × RPM / 60.

So that's 60 × 1750 / 60 = 1750 ft-lb/s.

Then, power in horsepower is 1750 / 550 ≈ 3.18 hp.

But that's not any of the options. The options start at 5 hp. So I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (Torque × RPM) / (550 × RPM) ) → No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think about the basic units.

Power (in hp) = (Torque (lb-ft) × RPM) / (550 × 1) → Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Power (hp) = (Torque (lb-ft) × RPM) / (550 × 60) → Because 550 is for 1 hp in ft-lb/s, and 60 for RPM to seconds.

Wait, let me try that.

(60 × 1750) / (550 × 60) = 1750 / 550 = 3.18 hp. Again, same result.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me think in terms of the formula. I think the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( Torque (lb-ft) × RPM ) / (550 × 60) → which is ( Torque × RPM ) / 33,000. Let's compute that.

60 × 1750 = 105,000.

105,000 / 33,000 ≈ 3.18 hp. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the RPM is in revolutions per minute, but when calculating power, sometimes it's expressed as radians per second. Let me try that.

RPM is 1750, so in radians per second, that's 1750 × (2π) / 60.

Wait, but that would change the calculation.

Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let's try.

RPM = 1750 → Angular velocity ω = 1750 × 2π rad/min = 1750 × 2π / 60 rad/s.

Power is Torque × ω.

So 60 lb-ft × ω (rad/s) → convert to ft.lb/s.

So 60 × (1750 × 2π / 60) = 60 × (1750 × 2π) / 60 → the 60s cancel, so 1750 × 2π ft.lb/s.

But 1 hp is 550 ft.lb/s. So power in hp is (1750 × 2π) / 550.

Let me calculate that.

2π ≈ 6.2832. So 1750 × 6.2832 ≈ 1750 ×6=10500, 1750×0.2832≈500. So total about 11,000.

11,000 / 550 = 20. So 20 hp.

Ah! So 20 hp. Which is option B.

Wait, but why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought of RPM as per minute, but if I convert it to radians per second, which is the correct way to compute angular velocity for power, I get a different result. So that's why I was getting confused.

So the correct formula is to convert RPM to radians per second and then compute power as (Torque × angular velocity) / 550 (conversion to hp).

Wait, why did the first approach give me 3.18 hp, and this approach 20 hp? The difference must be because of unit conversion.

So the correct approach is to convert RPM to radians per second. Let me clarify:

1 revolution per minute = (2π radians) / 60 seconds.

So 1750 RPM = 1750 * (2π) / 60 = (1750 * 2π) / 60 rad/s.

Then, power (ft-lb/s) = Torque (lb-ft) × ω (rad/s) → 60 × [ (1750 × 2π) / 60 ] = 60 × 1750 × 2π /60 = 1750 × 2π ≈ 1750 ×6.2832 ≈ 10997.4 ft-lb/s.

To convert to horsepower, divide by 550: 10997.4 /550 ≈ 19.996 hp, which is approximately 20 hp. So the correct answer is 20 hp, option B.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the unit conversion.

Alternatively, another approach to compute the power in horsepower is:

Power (hp) = ( Torque (lb-ft) × RPM ) / (550 × 60) → as earlier.

But this gives (60 × 1750) / (550 ×60) )= 1750/(550) ≈3.18 hp. Which is not in the options. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because when using RPM in revolutions per minute, the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = ( Torque (lb-ft) × RPM ) / (550 × 60) → which is (60 × 1750)/(550 ×60) = 1750/550 ≈3.18 hp. But as I found, this approach is incorrect.

So the correct way is to convert RPM to radians per second, which is:

RPM = 1750 → ω = 1750 × (2π)/60 = (1750 × 2π)/60.

Then, power = Torque × ω → 60 × (1750 × 2π)/60 → 60/60 ×1750 ×2π → 1750 ×2π ft-lb/s.

Power in hp is (1750 ×2π)/550 ≈ (1750 ×6.28319)/550 ≈ (10997.4)/550 ≈20. So 20 hp.

So the correct answer is B:20 hp.
</think>

To determine the horsepower required to drive the load, we use the relationship between power, torque, and rotational speed. The formula for power in horsepower is:

\[
\text{Power (hp)} = \frac{\text{Torque (lb-ft)} \times \text{RPM}}{550 \times 60}
\]

### Step 1: Plug in the values
- Torque = 60 lb-ft
- RPM = 1750

\[
\text{Power (hp)} = \frac{60 \times 1750}{550 \times 60}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the equation
The 60 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:

\[
\text{Power (hp)} = \frac{1750}{550}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the result
\[
\text{Power (hp)} \approx 3.18 \, \text{hp}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the result
The calculated power of approximately 3.18 hp does not match any of the provided options. This suggests a possible misunderstanding of the formula. 

### Step 5: Re-evaluate the formula using angular velocity in radians per second
To accurately compute power, we must convert RPM to radians per second:

\[
\text{Angular velocity} = \text{RPM} \times \frac{2\pi}{60}
\]

\[
\text{Angular velocity} = 1750 \times \frac{2\pi}{60} = \frac{1750 \times 2\pi}{60} \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate power using angular velocity
\[
\text{Power (ft-lb/s)} = \text{Torque (lb-ft)} \times \text{Angular velocity (rad/s)}
\]

\[
\text{Power (ft-lb/s)} = 60 \times \frac{1750 \times 2\pi}{60} = 1750 \times 2\pi \, \text{ft-lb/s}
\]

\[
\text{Power (ft-lb/s)} \approx 10997.4 \, \text{ft-lb/s}
\]

### Step 7: Convert to horsepower
\[
\text{Power (hp)} = \frac{\text{Power (ft-lb/s)}}{550}
\]

\[
\text{Power (hp)} = \frac{10997.4}{550} \approx 20 \, \text{hp}
\]

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **B: 20 hp**.
