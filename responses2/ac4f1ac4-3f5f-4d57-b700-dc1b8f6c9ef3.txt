Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, the question is about what leads to a decrease in the money supply. I remember that the money supply is influenced by several factors, like the Federal Reserve actions.

Option A is the Fed lowering the discount rate. I think when the discount rate goes down, it makes it easier for banks to borrow from the Fed. That usually increases the money supply because more loans are available. So A would increase the money supply, not decrease it.

Option B is the Fed selling government securities in the secondary market. Selling these securities would reduce the amount of money banks have because they're taking money out when they sell them. This makes the money supply decrease because banks are holding onto more cash and less securities. So B could lead to a decrease.

Option C is the government spending less. If the government spends less, that would decrease the total money supply because more money is being saved or used elsewhere. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. When the government spends less, it affects the overall economy, but does it directly affect the money supply? Or is it more about private sector behavior? I think this could lead to a decrease in the money supply, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option D is the Fed lowering reserve requirements. Lowering these makes it easier for banks to lend more, which would increase the money supply. So D would increase, not decrease.

Wait, let me think again. Let's go through each option more carefully.

A: Lowering the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges banks for loans. Lowering it makes borrowing cheaper, so banks can lend more, leading to an expansion of the money supply. So A would increase, not decrease.

B: Selling government securities. When the Fed sells securities, they take cash from banks and sell them. This means banks have less money to lend out, so the money supply decreases. That makes sense. So B would lead to a decrease.

C: Government spending less. If the government spends less, that would reduce the total money in the economy. But does this directly lead to a decrease in the money supply? Well, other factors like the Federal Reserve's actions might influence it, but in this scenario, the question is about the Fed's actions. So perhaps this option is a bit tricky. If the Fed is selling more securities, it's affecting the money supply. But if the Fed is spending less, that's more of a fiscal policy, which is a bit outside the Fed's control in this question. Because the Fed's options are A, B, D. So D is the Fed's action. So if the Fed lowers reserve requirements, it's affecting the money supply. So maybe C is not directly under Fed's control, so the question is about Fed's actions. So C might not be the right answer.

Wait, the question is which of the following would lead to a decrease, based on Fed's actions. So, C is the government spending less, which is a fiscal policy, not a Fed action. So in the context of the question, which is Fed's actions, C is not directly a Fed action. So the options are A, B, D. So only A, B, D are Fed's actions.

So the options are just A, B, D. So C is not a Fed action, so it's not an option. Therefore, in the context of the question, which only considers Fed's actions, C is not a choice.

So, the correct options are A, B, D.

But wait, the question is which leads to a decrease. So B and D are likely.

Wait, D is lowering reserve requirements. Lowering reserve requirements make it easier for banks to lend, so yes, that would increase the money supply. So D would increase.

B: Selling government securities reduces the amount of money held by banks because they sell securities, so they canâ€™t lend that money, leading to a decrease in the money supply.

So the correct answer should be B. Because selling the securities takes money from the banking system, reducing the monetary base.

Wait, but another thought: the Federal Reserve's actions can also affect the money supply. For example, if the Fed sells government securities, it reduces the amount of cash in the economy, which would cause the money supply to decrease. That makes sense.

So the options are A, B, D.

So the correct answer is B.

To determine which factor leads to a decrease in the money supply, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A: The FED lowers the discount rate.**  
  Lowering the discount rate makes it easier for banks to borrow from the FED, increasing the money supply. This option increases the money supply, so it is not correct.

- **Option B: The FED sells government securities in the secondary market.**  
  Selling government securities reduces the amount of money banks have because they transfer cash to the Fed. This action decreases the money supply, making this option correct.

- **Option C: The federal government spends less money.**  
  Spending less is a fiscal policy (fiscal policy), not a Fed action. Since the question focuses on Fed actions, this option is not relevant.

- **Option D: The FED lowers reserve requirements.**  
  Lowering reserve requirements make it easier for banks to borrow, increasing the money supply. This option increases the money supply, so it is not correct.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **Option B**, as selling government securities reduces the money supply by decreasing the amount of money banks have available for lending.

**ANSWER: B**
