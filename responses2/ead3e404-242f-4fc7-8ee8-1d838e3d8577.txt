Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about Danny's Furniture purchasing furniture on June 8th with some discount terms. They paid on June 22nd, and we need to find out how much was due.

First, I remember that the terms are (3/15), (n/30). The way that works is that if you pay within 15 days, you get a 3% discount. If you don't, the full amount is due by the 30th day. So the discount period is up to 15 days after the purchase date.

The furniture was bought on June 8th. They paid on June 22nd. Let me calculate the number of days between June 8 and June 22. June has 30 days, so from June 8 to June 22 is 14 days. Wait, wait, because June 8 to June 22 is 14 days. Wait, no, if you count from June 8 to June 22, that's 14 days. Because June 8 is day 0, June 9 is 1, and so on up to June 22 being day 14.

Wait, actually, maybe I should count each day. Let me think again. June 8 is the purchase date. June 9 is 1 day, 10 is 2, 11 is 3, 12 is 4, 13 is 5, 14 is 6, 15 is 7, 16 is 8, 17 is 9, 18 is 10, 19 is 11, 20 is 12, 21 is 13, 22 is 14. Oh wait, that's correct. So 14 days passed. Since the discount is 15 days, 14 is within the 15-day window. So they can take the 3% discount.

So the discount is 3% of $1,426. Let me calculate that. 3% is 0.03. So 1426 * 0.03 = 42.78. So the discount is $42.78.

But wait, sometimes they round to the nearest cent, but since the question gives options with two decimal places, I think that's acceptable. So the amount due is the total minus the discount.

Total is 1426. Subtract 42.78, which gives 1383.22. Let's see if that's one of the options.

Looking at the options, option C is $1,468.22. Wait, that's not matching. So maybe I made a mistake?

Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait a minute, maybe I got the discount term wrong. Sometimes discount terms are phrased as '3/15' meaning 3% for 15 days, but sometimes it's 3% for the first 15 days after purchase. So if you pay on June 22, which is 14 days after purchase, you can take the discount.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the discount is per item, but in this case, it's a set, so the discount is applied to the total.

So the amount due would be 1426 * (1 - 0.03) = 1426 * 0.97.

Let me calculate that: 1426 multiplied by 0.97.

Hmm, 1426 * 0.97. Let me break it down.

1426 * 0.97 = 1426 * (1 - 0.03) = 1426 - (1426 * 0.03).

1426 * 0.03 is $42.78. So 1426 - 42.78 is 1383.22. So the amount due is $1,383.22.

Looking at the options, option C is $1,468.22. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, maybe the discount is 3% every 15 days. Wait, no. The terms are (3/15) n/30, which is 3% for 15 days, not every 15 days. So if you wait 15 days, you get the discount. So if you pay on June 22, that's 14 days after purchase, so you can take the 3% discount.

Wait, so the amount due would be 1426 * 0.97 = 1426 - 42.78 = 1383.22, which is $1,383.22. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 1,400

B:1,350

C:1,468.22

D:1,410.70

E:1,395.14

F:1,426

G:1,383.22

H:1,375.80

I:1,450.22

J:1,382.58

Wait, G is $1,383.22. Oh! So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but why is the initial thought that I was getting 1383.22, which is option G. So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The correct answer is G, $1,383.22. 

The furniture was purchased on June 8th with terms (3/15), (n/30). This means a 3% discount is available if payment is made within 15 days of purchase. Danny's Furniture paid on June 22nd, which is 14 days after the purchase date, thus within the 15-day window and qualifies for the 3% discount. 

The total purchase price is $1,426. The discount amount is calculated as 3% of $1,426, which is $42.78. Subtracting this discount from the total gives $1,426 - $42.78 = $1,383.22. This matches option G.

Answer: G
