Okay, so I have this question about the covariance function of a Poisson process. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says: Let {N(t), t ∈ [0, ∞)} be a Poisson process with rate λ = 4. I need to find the covariance function C_N(t1, t2) for t1, t2 in [0, ∞), and then evaluate C_N(2, 4). The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that the covariance function for a Poisson process is related to the covariance of the counts over two time intervals. The Poisson process is a counting process where the number of events in any interval of length t has a Poisson distribution with parameter λt.

The covariance function C_N(t1, t2) for a Poisson process is given by Cov(N(t1), N(t2)). I think the formula for this is λ multiplied by the minimum of t1 and t2. Or wait, maybe it's λ multiplied by the minimum of t1 and t2 if t2 is greater than t1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, let me think more carefully. The covariance between N(t1) and N(t2) depends on whether t2 is larger than t1. Because if t2 is before t1, the covariance is zero. If t2 is after t1, the covariance is λ times (t2 - t1). Oh wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the formula.

The formula for covariance in a Poisson process is Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = λ * min(t1, t2) when t2 > t1, but in general, Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = λ min(t1, t2) if t2 >= t1. Wait, no, that's not quite correct. Let me think again.

Another approach: The covariance can be expressed as the expectation of the product minus the product of expectations. So Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = E[N(t1) N(t2)] - E[N(t1)] E[N(t2)].

For a Poisson process, the expectation E[N(t)] is λ t. So E[N(t1)] = λ t1 and E[N(t2)] = λ t2. So the product is λ² t1 t2.

Now, what is E[N(t1) N(t2)]? For a Poisson process, the covariance between counts over non-overlapping intervals is zero, but if the intervals overlap, it's not zero. Specifically, if t1 < t2, then the count over [0, t2] can be considered as N(t1) + N([t1, t2]). So the covariance would be Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = Cov(N(t1), N(t1) + N([t1, t2])) = Cov(N(t1), N(t1)) + Cov(N(t1), N([t1, t2])).

Since Cov(N(t1), N(t1)) is the variance, which is λ t1. And Cov(N(t1), N([t1, t2])) is zero because the interval [t1, t2] is after t1, so the counts in [0, t1] and [t1, t2] are independent. So the total E[N(t1) N(t2)] is λ t1 + λ t2.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no—the expectation E[N(t1) N(t2)] is equal to λ t1 + λ t2 because when t1 < t2, the counts over [0, t1] and [t1, t2] are independent. So E[N(t1) N(t2)] = E[N(t1)] E[N(t2)] + Cov(N(t1), N(t2)).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct this. The formula is:

E[N(t1) N(t2)] = E[N(t1)] E[N(t2)] + Cov(N(t1), N(t2)).

But wait, that's not right. Because if t1 < t2, then N(t1) and N(t2) are not independent. So, in that case, E[N(t1) N(t2)] = E[N(t1)] E[N(t2)] + λ (t2 - t1) [since when t2 > t1, the covariance is λ (t2 - t1)].

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The covariance between N(t1) and N(t2) when t2 > t1 is λ (t2 - t1). Because the number of events in [0, t1] and [t1, t2] are independent, so their covariance is zero. Therefore, Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = Cov(N(t1), N(t1) + N(t2 - t1)) = Cov(N(t1), N(t1)) + Cov(N(t1), N(t2 - t1)) ). The second term is zero because the intervals are non-overlapping. So this becomes λ t1 + 0 = λ t1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if t2 > t1, the covariance should be λ(t2 - t1).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try a different approach. I remember that for a Poisson process with rate λ, the covariance function is Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = λ min(t1, t2) when t2 >= t1. Or is it λ * min(t1, t2) regardless of which is larger?

Wait, let me think with an example. Suppose t1 = 2 and t2 = 4. Then the covariance should be Cov(N(2), N(4)).

Since 2 < 4, the count in [0,4] can be thought of as N(2) + N(2,4). And N(2,4) is independent of N(2), so their covariance is zero. Therefore, Cov(N(2), N(4)) = Cov(N(2), N(2) + N(2,4)) = Var(N(2)) + Cov(N(2), N(2,4)).

But Cov(N(2), N(2,4)) is zero because the intervals don't overlap. So Cov(N(2), N(4)) = Cov(N(2), N(2)) + 0 = Var(N(2)) = λ * 2.

Wait, no, because Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = λ min(t1, t2) only when t2 >= t1. So in this case, min(2,4)=2, so Cov is λ * 2. So since λ is 4, 4*2=8.

Wait, so the answer should be 8? Looking at the options, option E is 8. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait another second. Another approach: the covariance function for a Poisson process is Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = λ min(t1, t2) when t2 >= t1. So when t2 > t1, it's λ (t2 - t1), which when t1 =2 and t2=4, would be 4*(4-2)=4*2=8. So yes, that matches.

So the covariance function is λ min(t1, t2) when t2 >= t1. So C_N(2,4) is 8. So the correct option is E:8.
</think>

The covariance function for a Poisson process with rate λ = 4 is given by Cov(N(t1), N(t2)) = λ min(t1, t2) when t2 ≥ t1. For t1 = 2 and t2 = 4, min(2, 4) = 2, so Cov(N(2), N(4)) = 4 * 2 = 8.
