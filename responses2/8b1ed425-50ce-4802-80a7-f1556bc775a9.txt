Okay, so I've got this Python question here. Let me think about it step by step. The question says, "Let l = [1,2,3,4]. What is sum(l) in Python3?" Then it gives me multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, right. Summing a list in Python. I remember that you can use the sum() function for that. So the list l is [1,2,3,4]. So I need to sum all the elements in this list.

Wait, what does the sum function do? Oh right, it takes an iterable (like a list) and returns the sum of its elements. So for l, summing would be 1+2+3+4.

Let me calculate that. 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10. So the sum should be 10.

Looking at the options, option B is 10. So the correct answer should be B.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The list is straightforward, and summing each element gives me 10. So yeah, B is the right choice.

The sum of the list [1,2,3,4] is calculated as follows:

sum([1,2,3,4]) equals 10.

The correct answer is:

B: 10

Answer:
B
