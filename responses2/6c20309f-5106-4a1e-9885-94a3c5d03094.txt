Question:

To preserve the appearance and accessibility of its capitol building, a state enacted a law prohibiting "the display of any sign on any portion of the public sidewalk surrounding" the building. A group of five demonstrators who wanted to protest inadequate state funding for children's services applied for a permit to march single file on the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building. Each demonstrator planned to carry a two-foot-square sign that would read, "Our lawmakers do not care about our children." The group's permit application was denied pursuant to the state law, and the group has filed an action challenging the law's constitutionality. Should the court uphold the law's constitutionality?

Options:

A: Yes, because the prohibition against the display of signs is necessary to maintain the aesthetic appeal of the capitol building.
B: No, because the prohibition violates the demonstrators' right to peaceful protest.
C: Yes, because the prohibition against the display of signs is a reasonable restriction in a non-public forum.
D: No, because the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.
E: No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.
F: Yes, because the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is reasonable.
G: No, because even though the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is more restrictive than needed to serve a legitimate government interest. government interest.
H: No, because the prohibition against the display of signs is a violation of the demonstrators' freedom of speech.
I: Yes, because even though the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is necessary to serve a compelling public interest.
J: Yes, because the sidewalk around the capitol building is private property, and the prohibition against the display of signs is a reasonable restriction.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the court should uphold the law's constitutionality. The state law prohibits the display of any sign on any portion of the public sidewalk around the capitol building. The demonstrators applied for a permit, and their application was denied. Now, they're challenging the law's constitutionality, and the question is whether the court should affirm it.

Let me start by breaking down the key elements here. The law is about displaying signs on sidewalks. The sidewalk is a public forum, so that's a key point. Right, because public forums are places where people can gather and express their opinions without fear of blocking others' paths or being restricted by law. So, the display of signs on the sidewalk is a common activity there.

Now, the state law prohibits signs on public sidewalks. So, the problem the court is trying to solve is whether this prohibition is necessary, or if it's overreaching into the realm of private property. Because if the sidewalk is a public forum, then the display of signs is inherently a permissible activity. For example, at a public gathering, people can have signs they want without any restrictions.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the law is necessary for aesthetic appeal. That's true, but the question is whether the law is constitutional. The law's being necessary is a matter of reasonableness, not necessarily the constitutionality. So A doesn't directly address constitutional issues unless it's presented as a reasonableness issue.

Option B: The prohibition violates the demonstrators' right to peaceful protest. That's about the right to express their demands peacefully. But this is more about the right to protest than about the law's constitutionality. The law's constitutionality is about whether the law is necessary and whether the exercise of the right is justified.

Option C: The prohibition is a reasonable restriction in a non-public forum. Hmm, but the sidewalk is a public forum. So, this is saying the law is necessary because it's in a public setting. But constitutional issues are more about reasonableness, not necessity.

Option D: The law isn't narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. But again, this is about reasonableness. The law's constitutionality is about whether the exercise of the right is necessary and justified, not whether it's narrowly tailored.

Option E: The sidewalk isn't a public forum, and the law isn't narrowly tailored. Wait, the sidewalk is a public forum. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The sidewalk isn't a public forum, and the law isn't narrowly tailored. Also incorrect because the sidewalk is.

Option G: The law is too restrictive. But that's about whether the law is necessary, not about whether it's narrowly tailored.

Option H: The law is a violation of the demonstrators' freedom of speech. But again, freedom of speech is an individual right. The law's constitutionality is about whether the exercise of the right is necessary and justified, not whether it's an overreach.

Option I: The law is necessary for a compelling public interest. Again, this is about reasonableness, not about the constitutionality of the law.

Option J: The sidewalk is private property, so the law is unreasonable. But the sidewalk is a public forum, so that's not the case. The law is about displaying signs on the sidewalk, which is a public activity. So the sidewalk is a public forum, so J is incorrect.

So looking at all the options, the key point is whether the law is applicable to a public forum. Since the sidewalk is a public forum, and therefore displaying signs on it is allowed, the prohibition is unnecessary. So the court should uphold the law as it's being applied to a public setting. 

So the correct answer is E: No, because the sidewalk is a public forum, and the law isn't narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Wait, no. Let me read the options again.

Wait, option E says: "No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest." Hmm, that seems to suggest that the law is not narrowly tailored, which would make it unconstitutional. But the law is about displaying signs on a public forum, which is allowed, so the law is unnecessarily broad. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is whether the law is too restrictive, but the reasonableness of the restriction is the key. The law is being applied to a public forum, so it's applicable, and the restriction is reasonable. So the court should uphold it because the sidewalk is a public forum, and the restriction is reasonable.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer should be E if the reasoning is that the sidewalk is a public forum, so the law is necessary, but the problem is that the law is not narrowly tailored. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: The law is about displays on sidewalks, which are public. So, the law is applicable. The problem is whether the law is necessary. The fact that the sidewalk is a public forum supports the law's need. But the way the options are set up, the law's constitutionality depends on whether it's necessary and whether it's narrowly tailored.

Wait, the law's constitutionality is about whether the exercise of the right is necessary and whether it's narrowly tailored. So the fact that the sidewalks are public supports the necessity, but whether the law is narrowly tailored is another matter.

Looking again, the question is about whether the court should uphold the law's constitutionality. So, the court would find the law's constitutionality if it's necessary and not overly broad.

So, the law is necessary because it's on a public forum. The court should find it's not too narrowly tailored because the sidewalks are public. So the right of the demonstrators is to display their signs on a public forum, so the law is necessary and not overly restrictive.

So looking at the options, I think option E is about the sidewalk being a public forum and the law not being narrowly tailored. But option E says the law is not narrowly tailored. Alternatively, option H says the law is a violation of freedom of speech, but that's not about the law's constitutionality.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the law is being applied to a public forum, so it's necessary. But the fact that the sidewalk is a public forum supports the law's necessity, so the court should uphold it. So the correct answer would be E if the reasoning is that the sidewalk is a public forum, and the law isn't narrowly tailored.

Wait, no. The correct reasoning is that the sidewalk is a public forum, so the law is applicable, and the restriction is necessary. The court should uphold the law as it's being applied to a public forum, making it necessary, and the restriction is reasonable.

Looking at the options, which one states that the sidewalk is a public forum and the law is not narrowly tailored. That would be option E. Because E says: "No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest."

But I'm a bit confused because the law's necessity is due to the sidewalk being a public forum, making it necessary, but the reasonableness is about whether the restriction is appropriate. So I think the court should uphold the law because the sidewalks are public, making it necessary and the restriction is reasonable.

Wait another angle: the fact that the sidewalk is a public forum supports the law's necessity, but the law isn't narrowly tailored. So the court should uphold it because it's necessary and the restriction is reasonable.

But the options are confusing. Let me think again.

The law's constitutionality hinges on whether the restriction is necessary and whether it's narrowly tailored. Since the sidewalk is a public forum, the restriction is necessary, but the reasonableness is about whether the display of signs is a reasonable activity on a public forum.

In this case, since the sidewalk is a public forum, the display of signs is permissible, so the court should uphold the law as it's being applied to a public setting, making it unnecessary and the restriction is reasonable.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is E: No, because the sidewalk is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.

Wait, but E says it's not narrowly tailored. So the court's reasoning would be that the law isn't narrowly tailored—meaning that the restriction is too broad—and thus the law is unconstitutional.

But wait, the key is that the sidewalk is a public forum, so the display of signs is permissible. Therefore, the court should uphold the law because the restriction is necessary and not overly restrictive.

So the correct answer is E: No, because the sidewalk is a public forum, and the law is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.

Wait, but that seems contradictory because if it's a public forum, it's necessary, but the court would have to determine if the restriction is narrowly tailored. If the restriction is not narrowly tailored, then it's constitutional.

So the correct reasoning is that the restriction is not narrowly tailored, so the court should uphold it. Therefore, the answer should be E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I don't think so. J says the sidewalk is private property, which is not correct.

Another approach: The state law is about displaying signs on a sidewalk. The sidewalk is a public forum. The law's purpose is to prohibit displaying signs on it. The question is whether this is necessary, and if it's narrowly tailored.

Since the sidewalk is a public forum, the display is permissible, so the law is unnecessary. Therefore, the court should uphold it because it's being applied to a public forum, making it necessary and not overly restrictive.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says the law is unnecessary. Instead, let's see:

Option E says the sidewalk is a public forum, and the law is not narrowly tailored. So the court says no because the law isn't narrowly tailored, meaning that it's not too broad, so the restriction is unnecessary.

So, putting it all together, the court should uphold the law as it's being applied to a public forum, making it unnecessary and not overly restrictive, so the restriction is not narrowly tailored.
</think>

The court should uphold the law's constitutionality because the sidewalk in question is a public forum. Displaying signs on it is inherently permissible, as it is a common activity in public settings. The law's purpose is to prohibit this activity, but since it is applicable to a public forum, the restriction is unnecessary. The court should find the law's restriction not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest, as it is inherently necessary to maintain the aesthetic appeal of the capitol building, which is a public property. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.
