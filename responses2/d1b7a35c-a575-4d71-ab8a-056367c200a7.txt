Question:

Osgood is the record owner of Desertacre, a 100- acre tract of farmland in California's Coachella Valley. Osgood inherited the property from his father and farmed the land until 2006, when he reached the age of 70. He then decided to retire and move to Scottsdale, Arizona. At that time, Osgood conveyed Desertacre to Cutler "for his use during his natural life. "After taking possession of the property, Cutler executed a mortgage on Desertacre in the amount of $100,000. In 2009, Osgood died and in his will, the testator devised Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre. The will provided that Desmond and Deirdre took Desertacre "subject to Cutler's mortgage. "At the time of Osgood's death, Desertacre had a market value of $300,000. When Desmond learned of the devise, he was hesitant about taking title to Desertacre because he did not want to incur any indebtedness. Assume that Culter is still alive and in possession of the tract. With respect to the mortgage, Desmond will be

Options:

A: liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.
B: liable for the mortgage, because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.
C: not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.
D: not liable, because he did not personally grant the mortgage.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read it carefully.

So the facts are: Osgood owns Desertacre, a 100-acre tract. He inherited it from his father, and he farmed it until 2006 when he reached 70. Then he decided to move to Scottsdale. When he died in 2009, he left Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with Deirdre as a remainder, and it was subject to Cutler's mortgage. Cutler is still alive and owns the property.

The question is about whether Desmond is liable for the mortgage based on Osgood's will and the conveyance.

Hmm. Let me think about what Osgood did when he died. He left Desertacre to his son, and it was subject to a mortgage. At the time of his death, the property's market value was $300k, but the mortgage was on $100k.

Wait, so the mortgage was created when Osgood conveyed the land. But when does the mortgage take effect? I think the mortgage on the land would take effect from the date it's created. So if Osgood conveyed the land to his son with a mortgage, that mortgage would start to run from that moment, right?

But Osgood died before the mortgage was fully established. So the mortgage is created after his death, so by 2009, the mortgage would have been in effect on Desertacre. So when Osgood died, at the time of the will, the mortgage was still applicable.

Now, when Osgood died, he left Desertacre to his son with a mortgage. But the mortgage was created at the time of conveyance, not when Osgood died.

Wait, so the timing is important. When Osgood died, the mortgage would have been in effect. So the mortgage on the property is active from that point. Since the son took the land, the mortgage would apply to the property.

But wait, the question is about whether the mortgage is in effect when the son takes title. Or does the mortgage start at the time it's created, regardless of when he took the property.

I'm trying to recall the law on conveyances and mortgages.

When a person dies and leaves a deed to their children, the deed's terms usually take effect from the date the deed is executed. So if Osgood died and left the deed to his son, the terms would be in effect when he received the property.

But the mortgage was created at the time Osgood conveyed the property. So the mortgage was created when he gave the property to his son. So it would start to apply when he received it, but the will says it's subject to the mortgage when he dies.

Wait, but when he dies, the mortgage would have been in effect, so when the son takes the property, the mortgage would still be active.

So when Osgood dies, the mortgage is still active because the deed was executed when he died. The deed's terms take effect when the deed is executed.

Wait, no. The conveyance (deed) is between Osgood and his son. The deed's terms are in effect when it's performed. So the mortgage was created when Osgood conveyed the land to his son, so the mortgage would start to apply from that time. But Osgood died before that, so the mortgage would still apply.

So when Osgood dies, the mortgage is still active. So when the son takes the land, does the mortgage still apply? I think so, because the mortgage is recorded when it was created, regardless of when the deed is executed. So the mortgage is active through the life of the property.

But wait, another angle: the will states that the land is subject to Cutler's mortgage. But if the mortgage was created when Osgood conveyed the land, and the will says "subject to the mortgage," that's part of the conveyance.

So the deed includes a mortgage. So the mortgage would apply to the land as it would be when it's conveyed. But does the mortgage start to take effect right when the deed is received by the grantor?

Wait, the mortgage is a legal obligation created when the deed is executed. So when Osgood gave the deed to his son, the mortgage was created, so it started to apply from that point.

So when Osgood dies, the mortgage is still active. So when the son takes the property, the mortgage would still apply. Therefore, the son, who took the property after the mortgage was created, is liable for it.

But wait, another thought: the will says that the testator (Osgood) devised the property subject to the mortgage. So the devisee is his son, and the remainder is Deirdre. So the mortgage is part of the conveyance to the son.

Wait, but in property law, if a person dies and leaves a deed to their children, the terms of the deed take effect from the date the deed is executed, not from when the person dies. So the mortgage was created when Osgood gave the deed to his son, so the mortgage would be active when the son received the property.

So because the son received the deed, the mortgage is in effect at the time of his taking.

But wait, the answer options are about whether the son is liable. So in this scenario, the son took the property, and the mortgage was created when he received it. So the mortgage is in effect when he took it.

Wait, but the options suggest that the answer is about whether he is liable. So the options are A and B.

Option A says he's liable because he's the devisee under Osgood's will. Option B says he's liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.

But I thought the will said that the property was devised subject to the mortgage. Since this is a will, the testator's intent is to give the property to his son with the mortgage. So the son is the devisee, and the mortgage was created when he received the property. So he is the devisee, and thus is liable for the mortgage.

Wait, but that would suggest that he is liable. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the mortgage was created when Osgood conveyed the property, but the deed may have been executed later.

Wait, the will says that Osgood gave the property to his son, and that the property was devised subject to the mortgage. So the mortgage was part of the conveyance. So the son is the devisee, and thus he is liable for the mortgage.

Wait, but what about the time when the mortgage was created versus when the deed was executed. The mortgage was created when Osgood gave the deed (so at the time of his death) to his son. So the mortgage is in effect when the son received the property.

So the son would be the devisee, and thus would be liable for the mortgage.

Wait, but wait the options. The options are A and B. Let me look again.

Option A: liable because devisee under Osgood's will.

Option B: liable because devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.

Wait, but the term of the will says that the devisee is his son, so the son is the devisee. So he's liable.

So the correct answer would be that he is liable. So either A or B? Because both involve being the devisee.

Wait, the options are:

A: liable because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.

B: liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.

Hmm. Oh wait, but the will says that the mortgage was devised, so the property is subject to it. So the mortgage is in effect when the son takes title.

Therefore, the son is the devisee and must be liable for the mortgage. So the correct answer would be A or B?

Wait, but wait. The will says that Osgood's will devised the property subject to the mortgage. So the mortgage is part of the conveyance. So when the son received the property, the mortgage was in effect. So the son is the devisee and must be liable.

Alternatively, the question is about whether he is liable, so the answer would be A or B.

Wait, the options are A: he's the devisee, B: it's devised subject to the mortgage.

But wait, the will says that the property was devised subject to the mortgage. But the mortgage is created when the deed is executed, which is when Osgood dies. So the mortgage is in effect when the son takes the property.

So the son is the devisee and is liable for the mortgage. So the answer would be A or B.

Wait, but wait. The options are:

A: liable because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.

B: liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.

Hmm. So A and B both seem correct in a way, but let's think more carefully.

Wait, the will says that Osgood left the property to his son, with the mortgage. So the son's title is subject to the mortgage. So if the son takes title, he must pay off the mortgage. So he's liable.

But does the fact that the mortgage was created when he died affect this? Or is the mortgage created when the deed is executed, which is when he dies.

Wait, the mortgage was created when Osgood conveyed the property to his son. So when he died, the mortgage was active. So when the son took the property, the mortgage was still active.

So the son is the devisee, so he's liable.

So the answer would be A or B?

Wait, the options are about whether he is liable. Option A states he is the devisee under Osgood's will. Option B says the property was devised subject to the mortgage.

But the test is whether he is the devisee. Because if he is the devisee, then he's liable.

But I'm a bit confused. The will explicitly says that the property was devised subject to the mortgage. So the mortgage is part of that devise. Therefore, the son is the devisee and must be liable.

But wait, the question is about the mortgage, not the devise. So if the property is subject to a mortgage, then the mortgage is a legal obligation, and the grantor's heirs are liable.

Alternatively, the mortgage was created when the deed was executed, so the mortgage is in effect when the son takes title.

So, the son is the devisee, so he's liable for the mortgage. So the answer is A: he's the devisee under Osgood's will.

But wait, the options are A and B.

Wait, the options are:

A: liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.

B: liable for the mortgage, because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.

Hmm. Both options are about being the devisee or the property being devised subject to the mortgage.

Wait, but the will specifically says that the property is devised subject to the mortgage. So the devisee is his son. So the son is the devisee, so he is liable for the mortgage.

So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I thought that option B is about the devisee being the remainder holder. Hmm, no, option B says the property was devised subject to the mortgage, meaning that the mortgage is in effect. So the devisee is the son, who would have the right to take the property. So he's the devisee, which makes him liable for any mortgages on the property.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is A: he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will, so he's liable for the mortgage.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the conveyance. The will says that Osgood's will devised the property subject to the mortgage. So the mortgage was part of the conveyance. Therefore, the son is the devisee, and thus liable.

So the answer is A. But wait, looking back at the options, the options are A and B. Let me think of a different approach.

The question is about whether the mortgage is active when the son takes the property. The mortgage was created when Osgood conveyed the property to his son, so it's active when he received it. Since he took the property, the mortgage is active, so he's liable. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, the option B says the property was devised subject to the mortgage. The testator's intent is to devise the property subject to the mortgage. So the son is the devisee, which makes him liable.

Wait, but the options are about the outcome of the mortgage. So the answer is A: he is the devisee under Osgood's will, so he's liable.

So the correct answer would be A.

The question revolves around determining whether Desmond is liable for the mortgage created by Osgood's will. Here's the analysis:

1. **Osgood's Will and Conveyance**: Osgood inherited the property and left it to his son, Desmond, with a mortgage. The mortgage was created at the time of conveyance, not when Osgood died. Desmond took the property in 2009, at the time of Osgood's death.

2. **Mortgage Timing**: The mortgage was active from the time it was created, which was when Osgood conveyed the property to his son. Since Desmond took the property after the mortgage was created, the mortgage remains in effect.

3. **Deed Terms and Liability**: The will explicitly states that the property was devised subject to the mortgage. This means the mortgage is part of the conveyance to Desmond. As the devisee, Desmond is liable for any mortgages on the property.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A**: Correct. Desh is the devisee under Osgood's will, making him liable for the mortgage.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The property was devised subject to the mortgage, not that the devisee is the remainder holder.
   - **C and D**: Incorrect. There is no assumption of the mortgage, and there is no need for Desmond to assume it.
   - **E (Last Character)**: Not applicable, as the question requires selecting only one option.

ANSWER: A
