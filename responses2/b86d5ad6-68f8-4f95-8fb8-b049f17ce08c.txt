Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a 0.3 M acetic acid solution. The problem gives me the Ka value as 1.8 × 10^-5. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely in water. 

Wait, I need to find the pH. The pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration, right? So, I'll have to find [H+] first. For weak acids, I think I should use the approximation where x is much smaller than the initial concentration, but I'm not sure if that applies here because the solution isn't too dilute yet. The concentration is 0.3 M, which isn't super dilute, but maybe the assumption holds.

The dissociation of acetic acid is CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.
The initial concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.3 M, [H+] = 0, [CH3COO^-]=0. 

At equilibrium, [CH3COOH] = 0.3 - x, [H+] = x, [CH3COO^-]=x. 

The expression for Ka is (x^2)/(0.3 - x) = 1.8e-5. Since x is small compared to 0.3, 0.3 - x ≈ 0.3. So I can approximate: x² / 0.3 = 1.8e-5. 

Multiply both sides by 0.3: x² = 0.3 * 1.8e-5. Let's calculate that. 0.3 * 1.8 is 0.54, so 0.54e-5 is 5.4e-6. So x² = 5.4e-6 → x = sqrt(5.4e-6). 

What's the square root of 5.4e-6? Well, sqrt(5.4) is about 2.324, and sqrt(1e-6) is 1e-3. So x ≈ 2.324e-3 M. So [H+] is approximately 2.3e-3 M. 

Taking the negative log: pH = -log(2.3e-3). Let's compute that. Log(2.3) is about 0.36, so log(2.3e-3) is log(2.3) + log(1e-3) = 0.36 -3 = -2.64. So pH = -(-2.64) = 2.64. Hmm, that's approximately 2.64.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.63, which matches. But wait, another thought—could I have made an approximation that's not valid here? Because when [H+] is 2.3e-3, which is about 1/43. So the approximation x << 0.3 holds because 2.3e-3 is much smaller than 0.3. So that's fine.

Wait, wait—another approach. Let me set up the quadratic equation without approximation. So x^2 = (1.8e-5)(0.3 - x). Expanding: x² = 5.4e-6 - 1.8e-5 x. Bring all terms to one side: x² + 1.8e-5 x -5.4e-6 =0. Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=1.8e-5, c= -5.4e-6.

Discriminant D = (1.8e-5)^2 +4*1*5.4e-6. Let's compute that:

(1.8e-5)^2 = (3.24e-10) → 3.24e-10

4ac =4*1*5.4e-6=21.6e-6=2.16e-5.

So D=3.24e-10 + 2.16e-5 → 2.160324e-5.

Square root of D: sqrt(2.160324e-5) → approximately 4.647e-3 (since sqrt(2.25e-5)=0.004743, which is close to 4.7e-3).

So x = [ -1.8e-5 ±4.647e-3 ] / 2.

We take the positive root because x is positive. So (-1.8e-5 +4.647e-3)=approx 4.63e-3. Divide by 2: x≈2.315e-3. So about 2.315e-3, which matches our initial approximation. 

So [H+] is 2.3e-3, pH is 2.64. Looking back, option B is 2.63. So the answer should be B.

To find the pH of a 0.3 M acetic acid solution, we start by recognizing that acetic acid is a weak acid with a dissociation constant \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \). The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:
- \([\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = 0.3 - x\)
- \([\text{H}^+] = x\)
- \([\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = x\)

Using the \( K_a \) expression:
\[
K_a = \frac{x^2}{0.3 - x}
\]

Since \( x \) is small compared to 0.3, we approximate \( 0.3 - x \approx 0.3 \), giving:
\[
x^2 \approx 0.3 \cdot 1.8 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Calculating:
\[
x^2 = 0.54 \times 10^{-5} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \sqrt{5.4 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 2.324 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, \([\text{H}^+] \approx 2.324 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\). The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log{[H^+]} = -\log{(2.324 \times 10^{-3})}
\]

Breaking this down:
\[
\log{(2.324 \times 10^{-3})} = \log{(2.324)} + \log{(10^{-3})} \approx 0.365 - 3 = -2.635
\]
\[
\text{pH} = -(-2.635) = 2.635
\]

This value is approximately 2.64. Comparing with the options, the closest match is **B: 2.63**. 

For validation, the quadratic equation approach was also used:
\[
x^2 + 1.8 \times 10^{-5}x - 5.4 \times 10^{-6} = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula, the positive root is:
\[
x = \frac{-1.8 \times 10^{-5} + \sqrt{(1.8 \times 10^{-5})^2 + 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 5.4 \times 10^{-6}}}{2}
\]
\[
x \approx 2.315 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

The pH remains approximately 2.63, confirming the result.
