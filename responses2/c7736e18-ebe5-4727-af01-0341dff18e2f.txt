Okay, so I have this logic question here, and I need to figure out the correct translation into predicate logic. Let me read it again: "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on predicate logic, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I think I should identify the main terms. Leroy is a person, and the statement is about his "badness." So, Leroy being bad is a predicate, maybe Bx, where x is Leroy. Then, DJ Khaled shouting his name is another predicate, maybe Sy, where y is DJ Khaled.

The phrase "only if" in logic means that if the first condition is true, the second must also be true. So, "A only if B" translates to A → B. Wait, no—wait, I'm mixing up. Oh right, in logic, "if A then B" is A → B. So, "A only if B" would mean A is the result only when B occurs, which is the same as A → B.

Wait, let's think again. The structure is "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." So, if Leroy is bad (Bx), then DJ Khaled must shout his name (Sy). So, Bx → Sy.

Looking at the options, option C is Bx → Sy, which matches this structure. So, C seems correct.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not getting the direction wrong. Let me think about it differently. "Only if" is a bit tricky. Let's say, "I will go only if I finish." That's a conditional: I will go → I finish. So, same structure: condition A only if condition B is A → B.

Another example: "I will study only if I get a good grade." So, study → grade.

So, in the question, Leroy being bad (Bx) is the condition, and DJ Khaled shouting (Sy) is the condition. So, if Leroy is bad, then DJ Khaled must shout. So, Bx → Sy is correct.

Looking at the options again:

A: Sy ≡ Bl — That's an equivalence, meaning symmetric. Not sure that's applicable here.

B: Sy ⊃ Bl — This would mean if DJ Khaled shouts, then Leroy is bad. That's the opposite of what we need. Because the statement says Leroy is bad only if DJ shouts. So, bad → shout. So B is not correct.

C: Bx → Sy — This is what I thought earlier. So that's correct.

D: Bl ⊃ Sk — Wait, this is about Leroy being bad and DJ shouting. That doesn't fit. The original statement is about Leroy being bad, not about DJ shouting.

E: Bx ≡ Sy — Equivalence again, but that's not the same as implication. So, no.

F: Sk ⊃ By — Not relevant, since the speaker is Leroy, not DJ.

G: Sk ⊃ Bx — DJ Khaled shouting → Leroy is bad. Again, opposite of what we need.

H: Sk ≡ Bl — Again, DJ shouting and Leroy being bad.

I: By ≡ Sk — Similar to G and H, not relevant.

J: Bl ≡ Sk — Again, DJ shouting implies Leroy is bad.

So, the correct answer is C: Bx → Sy.

The correct translation is C: Bx → Sy.
