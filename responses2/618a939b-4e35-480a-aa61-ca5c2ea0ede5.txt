Okay, so I've got this question about inductive reactance. I remember from my physics class that inductors store energy in a magnetic field when current flows through them. But wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, inductive reactance, or XL, is calculated using the formula XL = 2πfL, where f is the frequency and L is the inductance.

The question gives me a coil with 20 millihenries. Oh, milli is 1e-3, so that's 0.02 henries. Then, the frequency is 60 cycles per second, which is the standard frequency for AC power systems—like the standard household frequency.

So plugging into the formula: XL = 2 * pi * f * L. Let me compute that. Let's see, 2 * π is approximately 6.283. Multiplying that by 60 gives 6.283 * 60. Let me calculate that: 6*60 is 360, 0.283*60 is about 16.98, so total is about 376.98. Wait, no, wait, 2π is about 6.283. So 6.283 *60 is 376.98, but wait, wait, no, no. Wait, no, 2π times 60 is 2 * 3.1416 *60. Oh wait, 2 * 3.1416 is about 6.2832. Multiply by 60: 6.2832 *60 = 376.992. So that's 376.992. Multiply that by L, which is 0.02 H.

So 376.992 * 0.02 is let's compute that. 376.992 * 0.02 is the same as 376.992 divided by 50. Let's compute 376.992 divided by 50. 50 *7 is 350, so 376.992-350 is 26.992. 26.992 divided by 50 is 0.53984. So total is 7.53984 ohms, approximately 7.54 ohms.

Wait, but let me check again. Oh wait, wait, no, wait, 2 * pi * f is 6.2832 *60= 376.992. Then multiplied by L=0.02 H. So 376.992 *0.02 = 7.53984 ohms. So approx 7.54 ohms.

Looking at the options, option B is 7.5 ohms, and option F is 6.5. So the closest is B. So the answer should be B.

To determine the inductive reactance (\(XL\)) of a coil with 20 millihenries (\(L = 0.02 \, \text{H}\)) connected to a 60 Hz power supply, the formula \(XL = 2\pi fL\) is used. Substituting the values:

\[
XL = 2 \times \pi \times 60 \times 0.02
\]

First, calculate \(2\pi \times 60\):
\[
2\pi \approx 6.2832 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6.2832 \times 60 = 376.992
\]

Next, multiply by the inductance (\(0.02 \, \text{H}\)):
\[
376.992 \times 0.02 = 7.53984 \, \Omega
\]

This approximates to \(7.54 \, \Omega\). Among the given options, the closest value is **7.5 ohms** (option B).

Answer: B
