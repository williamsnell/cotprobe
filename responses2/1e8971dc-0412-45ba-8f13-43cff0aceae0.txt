Okay, so I have this question about metabolic pathways and their standard free energy changes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives two reactions involving α-D-glucose. I need to compare their standard free energy changes, ∆G°, at 25°C and determine which is more efficient.

First, I remember that the standard free energy change (ΔG°) is related to the spontaneity of a reaction. A negative ΔG° means the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions, which is what we want for efficient utilization. So the reaction with the more negative ΔG° is more efficient.

The two reactions are:

(a) α-D-glucose → 2 ethanol + 2 CO₂(g)
(b) 6 O₂(g) + α-D-glucose → 6 CO₂(g) + 6 H₂O(l)

The given values are:
- CO₂(g) = -94.26 kcal/mol
- H₂O(l) = -56.69 kcal/mol
- Ethanol (1M) = -43.39 kcal/mol
- ΔG°_fin (for reaction a) is not given, but I think the question is asking about the ΔG° for each reaction.

Wait, the question says "which process represents the more efficient utilization of α-D-glucose?" So I think each reaction's ΔG° is the key. Because the more negative the ΔG°, the more efficient.

But wait, I'm not given the ΔG° for reaction (a). Oh wait, looking back at the problem statement, the values are given as:

CO2(g) = -94.26, H2O(l) = -56.69, ethanol = -43.39, ΔG°_fin for reaction (a). Wait, no, the question says the values are CO2(g)= -94.26, H2O(l)= -56.69, ethanol (1M)=-43.39, and the glucose for (b) is -219.22.

Wait, no, the question says for reaction (a), the ΔG°_fin is given as a value? Let me check the question again.

Oh wait, the question says: "the values are CO2(g) = -94.26, H2O(l) = -56.69, ethanol (1 M) = -43.39, α-D-glucose = -219.22."

Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the question lists the ΔG of each substance. Let me read it again.

The values are:

CO2(g) = -94.26 (so per mole)
H2O(l) = -56.69
ethanol (1M) = -43.39
α-D-glucose = -219.22.

Wait, but the question is about the standard free energy change for each process. Each reaction's ΔG° would be calculated based on the substances involved.

Reaction (a) is the breakdown of glucose into ethanol and CO₂. So the formula would be:

1 mole of glucose → 2 moles ethanol + 2 moles CO₂.

So for each mole, the reaction produces ethanol and CO₂.

The standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is the sum of the ΔG° of products minus the reactants. Since glucose is the reactant, its ΔG is subtracted. Ethanol and CO₂ are products; their ΔG is added.

So reaction (a): 

ΔG°_a = [2 * (-43.39) + 2 * (-94.26)] - [1 * (-219.22)]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, standard Gibbs free energy change is calculated by ΔG°_products - ΔG°_reactants for the reaction.

Because ΔG° for the reaction is sum of products minus sum of reactants.

So for reaction (a):

Reactants: 1 mole glucose. So ΔG°_reactants = (1 * (-219.22)).

Products: 2 ethanol and 2 CO2. So sum is (2*(-43.39)) + (2*(-94.26)).

So,

ΔG°_a = [ (2*(-43.39)) + (2*(-94.26)) ] - [ (-219.22) ]

Let me compute that.

Calculating the products:

2*(-43.39) = -86.78
2*(-94.26) = -188.52
Sum: -86.78 - 188.52 = -275.30

Now subtract the reactant's ΔG: which is (-219.22). So:

ΔG°_a = (-275.30) - (-219.22) = (-275.30) +219.22 = -56.08 kcal/mol.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me check the signs again.

Wait, no, because the formula is sum of products minus sum of reactants. So:

ΔG°_products = 2 * (-43.39) + 2 * (-94.26) = (-86.78) + (-188.52) = -275.30.

ΔG°_reactants = 1 * (-219.22) = -219.22.

So ΔG°_a = (-275.30) - (-219.22) = -56.08 kcal/mol.

Hmm, okay. So reaction (a) has a ΔG° of about -56.08 kcal/mol.

Now reaction (b): 6 O2 + glucose → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O.

So the formula is:

1 mole glucose → products are 6 CO2 and 6 H2O.

So ΔG°_b is [6*(-94.26) + 6*(-56.69)] - [1*(-219.22)]

Calculating:

6*(-94.26) = -565.56
6*(-56.69) = -340.14
Sum products: (-565.56) + (-340.14) = -905.70

Reactants: 1*(-219.22) = -219.22

So ΔG°_b = (-905.70) - (-219.22) = (-905.70) + 219.22 = -686.48 kcal/mol.

Wait, that's a big negative number. So reaction (b) has a much more negative ΔG° than reaction (a).

Wait, that can't be right. Because a high ΔG° is bad for the reaction, but I think I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another way: the reaction (b) is the conversion of glucose to CO₂ and H2O. But according to the numbers, that's a much more negative ΔG° than reaction (a). So reaction (b) would be more efficient.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me double-check.

Reaction (a): glucose → ethanol + 2 CO₂.

Products: 2 ethanol (each -43.39) and 2 CO₂ (each -94.26).

So 2*(-43.39) = -86.78; 2*(-94.26) = -188.52 → sum is -275.30.

Reactants: 1*(-219.22) → so ΔG°_a = (-275.30) - (-219.22) = (-56.08) kcal/mol.

Reaction (b): 6 O2 + glucose → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O.

Products: 6*(-94.26) = -565.56; 6*(-56.69) = -340.14 → sum is -905.70.

Reactants: glucose (-219.22).

ΔG°_b = (-905.70) - (-219.22) = (-686.48) kcal/mol. Oh wait, but that's a very negative number.

So reaction (b) has a much more negative ΔG° than reaction (a). So reaction (b) is more efficient.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because reaction (a) is a breakdown of glucose into ethanol and CO2. That's a more complex process, perhaps with less efficiency. Reaction (b) is the complete breakdown of glucose into CO2 and H2O; this is a much more complex and less efficient path.

But regardless, the question is to compare ΔG° for each reaction.

So the values are:

Reaction (a): ΔG° = -56.08 kcal/mol.

Reaction (b): ΔG° = -686.48 kcal/mol.

Which is more efficient? The one with the lower (more negative) ΔG° is more efficient.

Reaction (b) has a much more negative ΔG°, so it's more efficient.

So, the correct answer would be reaction (b) is more efficient.
</think>

To determine which reaction represents the more efficient utilization of α-D-glucose, we compare the standard free energy changes (ΔG°) for the two reactions. A more negative ΔG° indicates a more efficient reaction, as it is more spontaneous.

### Reaction (a):
The reaction is:

\[
\alpha\text{-D-glucose} \rightarrow 2 \text{ethanol} + 2 \text{CO}_2(g)
\]

The ΔG° for this reaction is calculated as follows:

1. **Products**:  
   - Ethanol: \( 2 \times (-43.39) = -86.78 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)  
   - CO₂: \( 2 \times (-94.26) = -188.52 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)  
   - Total for products: \( -86.78 + (-188.52) = -275.30 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)

2. **Reactants**:  
   - α-D-glucose: \( -219.22 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)  

3. **ΔG° for reaction (a)**:  
   \[
   \Delta G^\circ_a = (-275.30) - (-219.22) = -56.08 \, \text{kcal/mol}
   \]

### Reaction (b):
The reaction is:

\[
6 \text{O}_2(g) + \alpha\text{-D-glucose} \rightarrow 6 \text{CO}_2(g) + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
\]

The ΔG° for this reaction is calculated as follows:

1. **Products**:  
   - CO₂: \( 6 \times (-94.26) = -565.56 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)  
   - H₂O: \( 6 \times (-56.69) = -340.14 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)  
   - Total for products: \( -565.56 + (-340.14) = -905.70 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)

2. **Reactants**:  
   - α-D-glucose: \( -219.22 \, \text{kcal/mol} \)  

3. **ΔG° for reaction (b)**:  
   \[
   \Delta G^\circ_b = (-905.70) - (-219.22) = -686.48 \, \text{kcal/mol}
   \]

### Comparison:
- Reaction (a) has a ΔG° of \( -56.08 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
- Reaction (b) has a ΔG° of \( -686.48 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  

Reaction (b) has a much more negative ΔG°, indicating that it is more efficient for the utilization of α-D-glucose.
