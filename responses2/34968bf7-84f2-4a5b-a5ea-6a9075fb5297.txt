Alright, I've got this multiple-choice question about Lenin's contributions to Marxist economic theory. Let me think through it step by step.

The question asks what Lenin contributed. The options are A through J. I'll try to remember key points from my studies.

First, I recall that Lenin was a major figure in Marxist theory, especially in how he presented it. The key here is to pick the correct term from the options.

Option A: Expansion of the welfare state. I'm not sure. The welfare state was a part of the Soviet system, but I think Lenin was more about the theoretical expansion rather than the actual implementation. Also, they were Soviet, and the question is about his economic theory.

Option B: Concept of historical materialism. That rings a bell. I believe Lenin introduced historical materialism as part of his Marxist analysis, focusing on the history of production.

Option C: Theory of the permanent revolution. I'm not certain about this one. There's also a theory called the "new revolution," but I'm not sure if that's what Lenin developed. It might be more about the attempt to explain how revolutionary movements happen.

Option D: Five-year plans. That's probably part of the Soviet economic plan, not his main economic theory contribution.

Option E: Class struggle. That's a central concept in Marxist economics, so this is a strong candidate. Lenin was known for his emphasis on class struggle.

Option F: Imperialism. That's more about the Cold War's impact, not his economic theory.

Option G: Abolition of capitalism. I don't think that's accurate. Lenin's position was more about socialism and class struggle rather than eliminating capitalism.

Option H: Communism. That's more of a political movement, but I'm not sure if it's what Lenin did. I think he was part of Marxist theory, but communism was a later concept.

Option I: Dictatorship of the proletariat. That doesn't fit because Lenin was pro-classical, not dictatorial about the class.

Option J: Labor theory of value. That was developed by Dickhwald, not Lenin.

So, narrowing it down, B and E are strong. Let me think again. The concept of historical materialism (B) is definitely correct because Lenin was a proponent of it. Class struggle (E) is also a key term, but the question is about what he contributed specifically to economics. 

Wait, the question is about his economic theory. So, what did he do in that area? I think he was a proponent of historical materialism, which deals with the history of production and class struggle. He also might have emphasized the role of class in economic development, which ties into class struggle.

Alternatively, class struggle is a central Marxist concept, but the term 'concept' in option E might be more accurate for what he contributed. Also, I remember that the theory of the permanent revolution is more about the idea that class struggle leads to revolutionary changes, but maybe that's more of a theory than his direct contribution to economic theory.

So, the correct answer is E: Concept of class struggle. Because that's the essence of what he contributed.

The correct answer is **E: Concept of class struggle**. Lenin was a key proponent of Marxist economics, particularly emphasizing class struggle as a central concept. This aligns with his approach to understanding economic development through the lens of historical materialism and class interests.
