Okay, so I've got this physics problem about mirrors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. So the question is about a diverging mirror, and I need to find the focal length. Alright, let's start.

The setup: An object is placed 10 cm in front of a diverging mirror. The image appears 2 cm behind the mirror. So, wait, diverging mirrors are also called concave mirrors, right? And those mirrors have a focal length that's negative because they diverge light. And the image is virtual and upright, I believe.

I remember that for mirrors, whether concave or convex, we can use the mirror equation. The formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. But wait, I have to make sure about the signs. Since the image is virtual, the image distance v is negative. And the object distance u is positive because it's in front of the mirror.

So the object is at u = +10 cm. The image is 2 cm behind the mirror. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the image is virtual, so it's on the same side as the object, but in front of the mirror. Wait, no, wait. For mirrors, the image is always virtual, upright, and on the same side as the object. Wait no, actually, for a diverging mirror, all images are virtual and behind the mirror. Oh wait, no, wait, for a diverging mirror (concave), objects placed within the focal length produce virtual images on the same side as the object. Wait, no, wait, no! I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. For a concave mirror, the focal point is inside the mirror. So if the object is placed within the focal length, the image is virtual and located on the same side as the object. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think I've got it wrong. Let me think again. For a concave mirror, if the object is placed at a distance less than the focal length, the image is virtual and located on the same side as the object, but that's not possible because that would mean the image is in front of the mirror. Wait, no, wait, actually, if the object is within the focal length, the image is virtual and appears on the opposite side, but beyond the focal point. Or is it on the same side as the object?

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram in my mind. For a concave mirror, the focal point is in front of the mirror. If the object is placed closer to the mirror than the focal length, the image is formed behind the focal point, but on the same side as the object. Wait, no, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think about the mirror equation again.

The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. The sign conventions are important here. For a diverging mirror, the focal length f is negative. Also, for a virtual image, the image distance v is negative because the image is behind the mirror.

Wait, so object distance u is 10 cm, positive. Image distance v is -2 cm, because it's behind the mirror, so negative. So applying the formula:

1/f = (1/v) + (1/u) → 1/f = (-2 cm)⁻¹ + (1 cm⁻¹).

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly. 1/f equals 1/v plus 1/u. So 1/f = (1)/(-2) + (1)/(10).

Compute that. 1/(-2) is -0.5, and 1/10 is 0.1. So adding them gives (-0.5) + 0.1 = -0.4. So 1/f = -0.4. So f is negative. 1/f equals -0.4, so f is -2.5 cm? Wait, wait.

Wait, let me calculate it again. 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. u is 10 cm positive, v is -2 cm. So 1/v is 1/(-2) = -0.5. 1/u is 1/10 = 0.1. Sum is (-0.5) + 0.1 = -0.4. So 1/f = -0.4. Therefore, f = 1/( -0.4 ) = -2.5 cm. So f is -2.5 cm. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: -2/5 cm → that's -0.4 cm.

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check the numbers. So u is +10 cm, v is -2 cm.

So 1/f = 1/(-2) + 1/(10) → -0.5 + 0.1 = -0.4 → 1/f = -0.4 → f = -2.5 cm. Oh wait, but 2.5 is 5/2. So f is -5/2 cm. Looking at the options, option D is -5/2 cm. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the sign for v. Because sometimes I get confused about whether the image is in front or behind. Oh! Wait, in the mirror equation, the image distance is positive if it's on the same side as the object, which is the case when the object is between the mirror and the focal point. But when the object is beyond the focal point, the image is behind the mirror, so v is negative. So in this case, u is positive, v is negative. So correct.

So 1/f = (1/(-2 cm)) + (1/10 cm) → (-0.5) + 0.1 = -0.4 → f = -2.5 cm, which is -5/2 cm. So the correct answer is option D.

To determine the focal length of the diverging mirror, we use the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u}
\]

### Step 1: Assign signs based on conventions
- For a diverging mirror, the focal length \( f \) is negative.
- The object distance \( u \) is positive because it is placed in front of the mirror.
- The image distance \( v \) is negative because the image is virtual and located behind the mirror.

### Step 2: Plug in the values
- Object distance: \( u = +10 \, \text{cm} \)
- Image distance: \( v = -2 \, \text{cm} \)

Substitute these into the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{-2} + \frac{1}{10}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( 1/f \)
\[
\frac{1}{f} = -0.5 + 0.1 = -0.4
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( f \)
\[
f = \frac{1}{-0.4} = -2.5 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 5: Express \( f \) as a fraction
\[
f = -\frac{5}{2} \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The correct answer is \( -\frac{5}{2} \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to option D.
