Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question says that two numbers add up to 19 and their product is 70. I need to find these two numbers from the options given.

Hmm, let me think. So, if I call the two numbers x and y, then I know that x + y = 19 and x * y = 70. I'm trying to find x and y that satisfy both equations.

Maybe I can list the pairs of factors of 70 because the product is 70. Let's see, 1 and 70, 2 and 35, 5 and 14, 7 and 10. Oh wait, but since the sum is 19, I should check each pair to see if their sum is 19.

Let me go through them:

1 and 70: 1 +70 =71, which is way more than 19. So no.
2 and 35: 2+35=37, still too big.
5 and 14: 5+14=19. Oh! That adds up. So the numbers are 5 and 14.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other pairs. What about higher factors? Like 7 and 10: 7+10=17. That's less than 19. So the only pair that adds up to 19 is 5 and 14. Looking at the options, option A is 5 and 14. So the answer should be A.

The two numbers are 5 and 14, as they add up to 19 and multiply to 70.
