Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this psychology question about which controversy a psychologist focusing on whether development occurs in stages would be interested in. Let me think step by step.

The question is asking about the main controversies in development theory. The options are A to I, and the correct answer is one of them.

First, I remember that development theory has several key debates. One major one is about whether development is stable or changes continuously over time. I think I read about that. It's called the stability versus change debate. I recall that some theories, like behaviorism, which focuses on observable behavior, argue that development is stable. Others, like psychoanalysis, emphasize that processes aren't stable because they involve unconscious factors. So the debate is about whether change is inevitable or not.

Looking at the options, option B is "stability versus change." That sounds right because the question is about whether development occurs in stages, which implies change over time. 

Other options: option A talks about rationality and irrationality, which is more about cognitive processes and perhaps more related to psychology's focus on human behavior and perception, not the developmental stages.

Option C is about cognition vs behavior. That's more about how people process information, which might be related but perhaps not the main focus of developmental stage debates.

Option D is qualitative vs quantitative data. That's more about research methods rather than the theory itself.

Option E is conscious vs unconscious. That's about individual differences and influences, which is part of the broader development theory but not the primary focus.

Options F to I are about various other theories, like nature vs nurture, individual vs societal influences, etc. But the question is about whether development occurs in stages, which is a specific debate about change and stability.

So I think the correct answer is B, stability versus change.
