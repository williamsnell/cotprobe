Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about backgammon. The question is asking how many players backgammon is played with. The options are from A to J, with letters ranging from Seven to Six. 

First, I remember that backgammon is a board game that typically involves more than one player. I think it's a two-player game because I've heard it's played between two people. But I'm not entirely sure. I should probably think about the rules and common play styles to be certain.

Backgammon is often played with two players, one using the home board and the other the away board. Each player has a set of pieces, usually seven. The game involves moving pieces forward on the board, which is divided into a grid. Players take turns rolling dice and moving their pieces. The goal is to be the first to reach the end of the board without going over.

I don't recall any versions of backgammon with more than two players. Most variants might involve more players, but the basic game itself is for two. So, looking at the options, the only two-player option is I: Four. The other options are 7,8,9,10,11,3,5,6, etc. 

Wait, some sources might mention that in some variants it's played with more than two, but the standard game is two. So I think the correct answer is I: Four.
