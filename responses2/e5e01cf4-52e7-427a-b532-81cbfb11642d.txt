Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. A car starts from rest and uniformly accelerates to a final speed of 20.0 m/s in 15.0 seconds. I need to find out how far it travels during this time. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from school that when something starts from rest and accelerates uniformly, it's a uniformly accelerated motion. So, the initial velocity is zero. The formula I think is for distance when acceleration is constant. Oh right, the formula is s = ut + 0.5*a*t². Since u is zero, that simplifies to s = 0.5*a*t².

But wait, I don't have the acceleration. Oh, right, I can find acceleration using the formula v = u + at. Since it starts from rest, u is zero, so v = at. So, acceleration a is v/t. Let's plug in the numbers. v is 20 m/s, t is 15 s. So a = 20 / 15. Let me calculate that: 20 divided by 15 is approximately 1.333... m/s².

Wait a second, 20 divided by 15 is 4/3, which is about 1.333 m/s². Got it. Now plug a back into the distance formula. So s = 0.5 * (4/3) * (15)^2. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 15 squared is 225. Then, 4/3 multiplied by 225. Let's see, 4 times 225 is 900, and divided by 3 is 300. So 0.5 * 300 is 150. Oh wait, so s is 150 meters. Looking at the options, option J is 150 m.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: maybe using the average velocity method. Since it starts from rest, the average velocity is (0 + 20)/2 = 10 m/s. Then distance is average velocity multiplied by time, so 10 * 15 is 150 m. Yep, same result. So I'm confident it's 150 meters, which is option J.

To determine how far the car travels, we use the kinematic equation for uniformly accelerated motion starting from rest:

\[
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
\]

Since the car starts from rest (\(u = 0\)), this simplifies to:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2}at^2
\]

First, calculate the acceleration \(a\). Using the equation \(v = u + at\) (where \(v = 20.0 \, \text{m/s}\) and \(t = 15.0 \, \text{s}\)):

\[
a = \frac{v}{t} = \frac{20.0}{15.0} = 1.333 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Now substitute \(a\) and \(t\) into the distance formula:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1.333 \cdot (15.0)^2
\]

Calculate \(15.0^2 = 225\). Then:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1.333 \cdot 225 = 0.5 \cdot 300 = 150 \, \text{m}
\]

Alternatively, using the average velocity method: the average velocity is \(\frac{0 + 20.0}{2} = 10.0 \, \text{m/s}\), and the distance is:

\[
s = 10.0 \cdot 15.0 = 150 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the car travels 150 meters, corresponding to option **J**.

**ANSWER: J**
