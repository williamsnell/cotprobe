Question:

7.4-11. Some dentists were interested in studying the fusion of embryonic rat palates by a standard transplantation technique. When no treatment is used, the probability of fusion equals approximately 0.89 . The dentists would like to estimate $p$, the probability of fusion, when vitamin A is lacking.
(a) How large a sample $n$ of rat embryos is needed for $y / n \pm 0.10$ to be a $95 \%$ confidence interval for $p$ ?

B: 50
C: 45
D: 40
E: 30
F: 55
G:  $38$

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this statistics problem. So the question is about determining the sample size needed for a confidence interval around the proportion p. Let's see.

The problem states that when no treatment is used, the probability of fusion is 0.89. The dentists want to estimate p when vitamin A is lacking. The given confidence interval they want is y/n ± 0.10, and they need a 95% confidence interval. So I need to find the sample size n that satisfies this.

I remember the formula for the confidence interval for a proportion is based on the normal approximation, especially when np and n(1-p) are both greater than 5. But wait, the question doesn't specify that, so I'll proceed with the formula.

The margin of error (E) is given as 0.10. The confidence level is 95%, so the z-score (z*) for a two-tailed test is 1.96. The sample proportion p is 0.89 in the absence of treatment, but when vitamin A is lacking, that's the p we're trying to find. However, since we're calculating the required sample size for a desired margin of error, p can be approximated as p̂ = 0.89.

The formula for the margin of error for a proportion is E = z* * sqrt( p̂(1 - p̂) / n ). We can rearrange this formula to solve for n.

So plugging in the values: E = 0.10, z* =1.96, p̂=0.89.

So 0.10 = 1.96 * sqrt(0.89 * 0.11 / n )

First, square both sides to eliminate the square root:
(0.10)^2 = (1.96)^2 * (0.89*0.11)/n
0.01 = (3.8416) * (0.0979)/n
Wait, let me calculate that correctly. 0.89 * 0.11 is 0.0979.

So 0.01 = 3.8416 * 0.0979 / n

Multiply 3.8416 by 0.0979. Let me compute that.

3.8416 * 0.0979 ≈ 0.3771 (since 3.8 * 0.097 is about 0.3706, but more accurately, 3.8416 * 0.0979 = let me compute it step by step.

0.0979 = approx 0.0979.

3.8416 * 0.0979:

Multiply 3.8416 × 0.0979. Let me break it down:

3.8416 × 0.09 = 0.345744

3.8416 × 0.0079 = 0.03034624

Adding them together: 0.345744 + 0.03034624 = 0.37609024.

So 0.01 = (3.8416 * 0.0979) / n → 0.01 = 0.37609024 / n

Wait, no, wait. The equation is 0.01 = (3.8416 * 0.0979) / n → 0.01 = 0.37609024 / n.

Wait, but that would mean n = 0.37609024 / 0.01 → n ≈ 37.609. That's about 38. So n is approximately 38.

Looking at the options, option G is 38. So the answer should be G.

To determine the required sample size \( n \) for the confidence interval \( \hat{y}/n \pm 0.10 \) to be 95% for estimating \( p \), we use the formula for the margin of error:

\[
E = z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 0.10 \)
- \( z^* = 1.96 \) (for 95% confidence)
- \( \hat{p} = 0.89 \) (from no treatment)

Rearranging for \( n \):
\[
n = \frac{z^*^2 \cdot \hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{E^2}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
n = \frac{1.96^2 \cdot 0.89 \cdot 0.11}{0.10^2}
\]

First, calculate \( 1.96^2 = 3.8416 \), then \( 0.89 \cdot 0.11 = 0.0979 \). Thus:
\[
n = \frac{3.8416 \cdot 0.0979}{0.01} = \frac{0.37609024}{0.01} = 37.609024
\]

Rounding up, \( n \approx 38 \).

From the options, the correct answer is G: 38.
