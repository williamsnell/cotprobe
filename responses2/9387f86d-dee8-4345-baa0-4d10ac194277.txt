Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the standard free energy of a reaction. Hmm, right, I remember that free energy, or Gibbs free energy, is involved in determining the spontaneity of a reaction. The question is asking about the oxidation of glucose, which I think is a complex reaction, but the question gives me specific values for each substance's free energy of formation.

Wait, let me think. The reaction given is the oxidation of glucose: C6H12O6(s) + 6 O2(g) → 6 CO2(g) + 6 H2O(l). And they want the standard free energy change for this reaction.

Oh right, I remember that the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for a reaction is calculated using the standard free energies of formation (ΔGf°) of the products minus the reactants. The formula is ΔG° = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants).

Given values:
- ΔGf° for glucose (C6H12O6) is -218 kcal/mol.
- ΔGf° for O2 is 0 because it's an element in its standard form. Wait, wait, is it zero? Because when you form an element in its standard state, its free energy change is zero. Yes, I think that's correct.
- ΔGf° for CO2 is -94.0 kcal/mol.
- ΔGf° for H2O(l) is -57.0 kcal/mol.

So the reaction is: glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water.

So for each substance, I need to calculate their contribution to the ΔG.

Glucose is reactant, so it's subtracted. Water is a product, so it's added. Let's see:

Products: 6 CO2 and 6 H2O. So their ΔGf° are 6*(-94) and 6*(-57).

Reactants: glucose (C6H12O6) and O2. So their ΔGf° are (-218) and 0.

Wait wait, but wait, oxygen is O2, so its ΔGf° is 0. So O2 isn't contributing in that calculation.

So compute all the products first:

6 CO2 → 6*(-94) = -564 kcal.
6 H2O → 6*(-57) = -342 kcal.
So total products: (-564) + (-342) = -906 kcal.

Now the reactants:

Glucose: -218, O2 is 0. So total reactants: (-218) + 0 = -218.

Wait wait, no, the formula is Σ (products) minus Σ (reactants). So:

ΔG° = [ (-906) ] - [ (-218) + 0 ] → So that's (-906) - (-218) = (-906) + 218 = (-688) kcal.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔG° = [sum of products' ΔGf] - [sum of reactants' ΔGf]

So products: 6 CO2 and 6 H2O.

Sum of products: (6 * -94) + (6 * -57) → ( -564 ) + ( -342 ) → -906.

Reactants: 1 glucose and 6 O2.

For O2, ΔGf is 0. So sum is (-218) + 0 → -218.

So ΔG° = (-906) - (-218) = -906 + 218 = -688.

Looking at the options, option B is -688, so that's the answer.

To determine the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the oxidation of glucose, the reaction is:

\[
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6(s) + 6 \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 6 \text{CO}_2(g) + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
\]

The formula for calculating ΔG° is:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \sum \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \sum \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]

### Given values:
- ΔGf° for glucose (\(\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6\)) = -218 kcal/mol
- ΔGf° for oxygen (\(\text{O}_2\)) = 0 (element in standard state)
- ΔGf° for carbon dioxide (\(\text{CO}_2\)) = -94.0 kcal/mol
- ΔGf° for water (\(\text{H}_2\text{O}\)) = -57.0 kcal/mol

### Calculation:
1. **Products**:  
   - 6 \(\text{CO}_2\) → \(6 \times (-94.0) = -564.0\) kcal  
   - 6 \(\text{H}_2\text{O}\) → \(6 \times (-57.0) = -342.0\) kcal  
   - Total for products = \(-564.0 + (-342.0) = -906.0\) kcal  

2. **Reactants**:  
   - 1 \(\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6\) → \(-218.0\) kcal  
   - 6 \(\text{O}_2\) → \(6 \times 0 = 0\) kcal  
   - Total for reactants = \(-218.0 + 0 = -218.0\) kcal  

3. **ΔG°**:  
   \[
   \Delta G^\circ = (-906.0) - (-218.0) = -906.0 + 218.0 = -688.0 \text{ kcal/mol}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The standard free energy change for the reaction is \(-688\) kcal/mol, which corresponds to option **B**.
