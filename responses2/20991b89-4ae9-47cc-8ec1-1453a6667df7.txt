Question:

A longshoreman fell to his death through an open hatch on the deck of a ship. The longshoreman was an employee of a company that had contracted with the ship's owner to load and unload the ship. The fall occurred at night, when loading work was over for the day, and there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch. A negligence action was filed against the ship's owner for the death of the longshoreman. In that action, the owner has moved for summary judgment and has provided unrebutted evidence that it is customary for the crews of ships to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ships. How should the court respond to the motion?

Options:

A: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner is liable if the hatch was left open irresponsibly.
B: Grant the motion, because the custom should be considered conclusive on the issue of negligence.
C: Grant the motion, because it is customary for the crews to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ship.
D: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch.
E: Deny the motion, because the probability of serious injury caused by falling down an open hatch clearly outweighs the burden of keeping the hatch closed.
F: Grant the motion, as the longshoreman was an employee of a different company and the ship's owner can't be held responsible for his whereabouts.
G: Deny the motion, because the ship's owner should have ensured that all hatches were closed after the longshoremen had left the ship.
H: Grant the motion, because there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch.
I: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.
J: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is irrelevant to the issue of negligence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this negligence question. Let me read it again.

The scenario is a longshoreman who fell to death through an open hatch on a ship. He was an employee of a company that contracted with the ship's owner to load and unload the ship. The fall happened at night when loading was done, and he wasn't near the hatch. The owner is suing, and the court is considering moving for summary judgment. The owner's evidence says that it's customary for the crew to open hatches after longshoremen leave. I need to determine what the court should do.

Hmm, the key points are: the fall is at night, crew opens hatches for ventilation after longshoremen leave. The owner is suing for negligence.

I remember that in summary judgment, the standard is to determine if the plaintiff is likely to have suffered harm. If it's not likely, the case goes to trial.

The short-handing rule comes to mind. The short-handing rule states that if a company's employees can reasonably keep the vessel closed after they leave, the court should not find the employees liable for their own actions. But if the employees are operating under the custom of opening hatches after leaving, that could be a breach of that custom.

So, in this case, the longshoreman fell while the hatch was open. If the crew is expected to keep it closed after they leave, that's a breach of their duty. Even if it's not the fault of the owner, maybe the owner's negligence is justified because the longshoreman's actions were not reasonable given the crew's usual behavior.

Looking at the options, option C says the owner should win because they're customary. Option G suggests the owner should win because the short-handing rule applies.

Wait, but the owner's motion is against the defendant. The issue is whether the owner's action is relevant. The question is whether the crew's custom should be considered a defense to negligence.

In some cases, if a company's employees have a duty to keep the vessel closed after they leave, and the fall occurred while the hatch was open, the court might find that the fall was negligent because the crew wasn't responsible for the fall after leaving.

So, for example, if the owner is the vessel's contractor, then the short-handing rule applies. The owner has no duty to keep the hatch closed after longshoremen leave. The fall was a fall from an open hatch, so the owner's negligence is justified because they weren't responsible for keeping the hatch closed.

Alternatively, option G says the owner should win because the short-handing rule is relevant. But I think the owner's motion is based on their own evidence that the crew opens hatches after leaving, which could be a defense.

Wait, the question is about the owner's motion. The owner's evidence is that it's customary for the crew to open hatches after longshoremen leave. So the owner is arguing that the crew's duty to keep the hatch closed after leaving is a standard that should be considered part of the case. 

But the short-handing rule says that if the company's employees keep the vessel closed after they leave, then the owner isn't liable for their negligence. However, if the owner's own negligence is not covered by the short-handing rule, then maybe the rule applies.

Wait, but in this case, the fall was due to the crew's improper handling of the hatch, but the owner is trying to argue that their own negligence isn't the issue because the crew's duty was a standard.

I'm a bit confused. The short-handing rule would say that if the company's employees are expected to keep the vessel closed after leaving, then the owner isn't liable for their actions during the time the hatch is open. However, if the owner's own negligence is not relevant, then the court would consider the short-handing rule.

Alternatively, if the owner's own negligence is not part of the short-handing rule's application, then the court would find the crew's duty as a defense. But I think the short-handing rule is more about whether the employees are responsible for their actions, not their own.

Wait, the short-handing rule is about whether the company's employees' actions are reasonable under their usual operations. So if the owner's own actions (like keeping the hatch closed) are not relevant, then the short-handing rule applies.

But in this case, the owner's motion is that the hatches are opened for ventilation after longshoremen leave. So the crew's duty is to keep them closed after they leave. The fall happened while the hatch was open, so the owner's negligence in keeping it closed is not relevant because the crew was expected to do it.

Wait, no. The owner is suing for the longshoreman's negligence, not for the crew's duty. So the question is, was the longshoreman's fall a negligent action because the crew was not keeping the hatch closed after they left.

So the court would assess whether the crew's duty to keep the hatch closed after leaving was a standard. If the owner is arguing that the crew's duty is a standard, then the owner can bring the suit on negligence, but the short-handing rule may not directly apply unless the owner's own negligence is not relevant.

Wait, the short-handing rule is about whether the company's employees were reasonably kept closed after leaving. If the owner's actions (like not keeping the hatch closed) are not relevant, then the short-handing rule doesn't apply, and the court would find that the crew was negligent.

So the owner's motion is based on their evidence that it's customary for the crew to open hatches after the longshoremen leave. That could be a defense because the crew's duty is to keep the hatch closed after leaving. So the owner is arguing that their own negligence (keeping it open) is not relevant, hence the crew's duty is a standard that should be considered.

Thus, the court should find that the owner's claim is based on the short-handing rule, and the crew's duty is a standard. Therefore, the court would grant the motion because the short-handing rule applies, and the owner is not liable for their own negligence.

Wait, but the owner is trying to argue their own negligence isn't relevant. So the court would look at whether the short-handing rule applies. If it does, then the owner's own actions are not relevant, so the fall was a fall from an open hatch, which would be considered negligent. But if the owner's actions are not part of the short-handing rule, then the crew's duty as a standard applies.

Wait, I think the short-handing rule is about whether the employees' actions were reasonable under their usual operations. So if the crew is expected to keep the hatch closed after leaving, then the owner's actions (keeping it open) are not reasonable, hence negligent.

So the owner's motion is based on their evidence that the crew is expected to keep the hatch closed after leaving. So the court should find that the owner's claim is based on the short-handing rule, and thus, the owner is liable because their own actions were not reasonable under the short-handing rule.

Wait, but the option C says the owner should win because they're customary. Option G says the owner should win because the short-handing rule is relevant.

Hmm. The short-handing rule is about whether the employees are responsible for their actions, not their own. So if the owner's actions are not part of the short-handing rule, then the rule doesn't apply, and the court would look at the crew's duty as a standard.

In this case, the owner's motion is that the crew's duty is a standard, so the owner is arguing that their own negligence isn't relevant. Therefore, the court would find that the crew was negligent because they were not keeping the hatch closed.

So the court should grant the motion because the owner is trying to argue that their actions (keeping the hatch closed) are not relevant, making the crew's duty a standard that applies. Therefore, the court would find that the owner is at fault for their own negligence.

Wait, no. The owner is suing for the longshoreman's negligence, not for the crew's duty. So the fact that the owner is bringing the suit is about the longshoreman's actions. The court needs to determine if the longshoreman's actions were negligent.

The short-handing rule says that if the company's employees keep the vessel closed after leaving the ship, the owner isn't liable for their actions. But if the owner's actions (keeping the hatch open) are not relevant, then the rule doesn't apply, and the crew's duty as a standard applies.

So the owner's claim is based on their own negligence, but they are bringing the suit on the longshoreman's negligence. So the court should assess if the fall was a fall from an open hatch, which would be negligence.

In this case, the fall occurred at night when the crew was open the hatch. So the owner's own negligence in keeping it closed is not relevant because the crew's duty to keep it closed is a standard.

Therefore, the court should find that the owner is not liable because the crew's duty is a standard, and the fall was a fall from an open hatch, making the owner's actions not relevant.

Wait, but the owner's motion is that they should win because the short-handing rule is relevant. So maybe the court considers the short-handing rule as applicable, and thus the owner isn't liable.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

The short-handing rule says that if the company's employees keep the vessel closed after they leave, the owner isn't liable for their actions during the time the hatch is open. But if the owner's own actions (like keeping the hatch closed) are not relevant, then the short-handing rule doesn't apply, and the court should find that the crew was negligent.

So the owner's motion is based on their own actions, but the court uses the short-handing rule to determine if the crew was negligent.

Therefore, the court should grant the motion because the owner is bringing the suit on the longshoreman's negligence, and the short-handing rule applies if the owner's actions are not relevant. So the court would find the owner is not liable and grant the motion.

Wait, but the options are about what the court should do. The options are about whether the owner is liable or not, and whether the short-handing rule applies.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Grant the motion, because it is customary for the crews to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ship.

This is about the custom making the crew negligent.

Option G: Deny the motion and submit to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch.

Option H: Grant the motion, because there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch.

Hmm. The correct approach would be that the owner's motion is based on their own actions (keeping the hatch closed) and is not relevant under the short-handing rule, so the court should find that the crew was negligent. Therefore, the court should grant the motion.

But the options are about what the court should do. So which option is that?

Option C says the court should grant the motion because the short-handing rule applies. So if the owner's actions aren't relevant, then the short-handing rule doesn't apply, and the crew's duty is a standard.

Wait, but if the owner's actions are not part of the short-handing rule, then the court should find the crew's duty as a standard.

So the court should grant the motion because the owner is bringing the suit on the longshoreman's negligence, and the short-handing rule applies, making the owner not liable. Therefore, the court would grant the motion because the owner's actions are not relevant, and the short-handing rule makes the crew negligent.

Looking at the options, option C says the court should grant the motion because the short-handing rule applies. So if the short-handing rule is relevant, the owner isn't liable.

But another option is option G, which says the court should deny the motion and have the jury decide. That would be if the short-handing rule isn't applicable, and the owner's actions are not relevant, so the court doesn't have to follow the short-handing rule.

Wait, the short-handing rule is about whether the employees were responsible for their actions. If the owner is bringing the suit on the longshoreman's negligence, the court would look at the short-handing rule to determine if the crew's duty is a standard.

So, if the owner's actions (keeping the hatch open) are not relevant, then the court should find the crew was negligent. So the court would grant the motion because the owner is bringing the suit on the longshoreman's negligence, and the short-handing rule applies, making the owner not liable.

So the court should grant the motion, and the court's instruction would be to grant the motion because the short-handing rule applies.

Looking at the options, option C says that. Option C: Grant the motion, because it is customary for the crews to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ship.

But what about option G? Option G says the court should deny the motion and submit to the jury with the standard that the owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch.

No, because the court should assess the short-handing rule. Unless the owner's actions are not relevant, the court wouldn't follow the short-handing rule.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck between options C and G.

Another angle: the short-handing rule is about the company's employees' duty to keep the vessel closed after leaving. If the owner is bringing the suit on the longshoreman's negligence, the court must consider the short-handing rule. So the court should find that the crew was negligent, and thus, the motion should be granted.

So the court would grant the motion because the owner is trying to argue their actions aren't relevant, making the short-handing rule apply, and the crew's duty is a standard.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C. Because according to the short-handing rule, the owner isn't liable for their own actions, which are not relevant. So the court should grant the motion because the short-handing rule applies.

Wait, but the owner's motion is about the crew's duty to keep the hatch closed. So if the crew's duty is a standard, then the owner is arguing that their actions (keeping the hatch open) are not relevant, hence the fall was a fall from an open hatch, which would be negligence.

So the court should find the crew's duty as a standard applies, so the owner isn't liable, and the motion should be granted.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

The question involves a negligence action against a ship owner for the death of a longshoreman who fell from an open hatch at night. The crew was expected to keep the hatch closed after the longshoreman left, and the owner is suing based on this custom. The short-handing rule applies, which states that if a company's employees keep the vessel closed after leaving, the owner is not liable for their actions during the time the hatch is open.

The longshoreman's fall occurred at night, when the crew was operating under the custom of keeping the hatch closed after leaving. The owner's motion is based on their evidence that the crew's duty was a standard, making their actions relevant. The court should determine whether the short-handing rule applies and whether the owner's actions are relevant.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C**: Correct. The court should grant the motion because the short-handing rule applies, and the crew's duty to keep the hatch closed after leaving constitutes a standard that the owner is liable for. The owner's actions (keeping the hatch open) are not relevant, so the court should find the crew negligent.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. The court should follow the short-handing rule rather than denying the motion. The owner's actions (keeping the hatch open) are not relevant, so the court should not follow the short-handing rule.

Thus, the court should grant the motion because the short-handing rule applies, and the owner is not liable for their actions.
