Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about economics and resources. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question asks which of the options is an example of capital as an economic resource. Hmm, I remember that capital refers to resources used in production that are held for future use, not immediately consumed.

Looking at the options:

A: A barrel of crude oil. That's a liquid resource. I think oil can be used in production, like making cars or chemicals, so it's capital.

B: A music concert ticket. That's something you pay for to watch a concert. It's a resource you might have, but it's not something you own or use up; it's a ticket you pay for, not something you use in your own production.

C: A valuable painting. Art can be capital, but it's more like a capital asset that could be sold or used in art. But the question is about resources, so maybe it's not the best fit.

D: An apartment for rent. Rent is an input, but it's cash, so it's more of an immediate resource, not capital.

E: A bushel of wheat. That's a tangible product, used in farming. It's a resource you can use in production, so it's capital.

F: A pot of homemade soup. That's something you make at home, perhaps for yourself. It's not something you invest in for production, so maybe not capital.

G: A share of corporate stock. That's ownership in a company, which is capital. But the question is about an example of capital as an economic resource, not ownership itself. So maybe this isn't the best fit.

H: A university degree. That's a skill or education you gain, which can be used in various jobs, hence capital.

I: A cement mixer. That's an input in construction, so it's capital.

J: A registered nurse. That's a profession, not a resource. It's someone you hire, so it's a service, not capital.

So the options that fit are A, E, H, I, and G. But wait, the question is asking which is an example. So all those except B and F are examples. But the question is about which is an example, so any of these would be correct. Wait, but looking back, the options are individual choices, so which one is correct in the context of the question.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice but only one option is correct. Let me see the options again. The options are A through J, each being a possible answer.

Wait, the options are in the list, and the question is which one is an example. So the correct answer should be one of the choices. The options are A to J, each a single option. So each of the listed is a possible example.

Wait, but the question is structured as "Which of the following is an example..." So only one of the options is correct.

So I need to pick one.

Looking back, the options in the list are the choices A to J, each being a possible example. So the correct answer is any of the listed except B and F.

Wait, the options are A: a barrel of crude oil; E: a bushel of wheat; H: a university degree; I: a cement mixer; G: a share of corporate stock.

So which of these is a capital resource? All except B and F are capital. But the question asks which is an example, so any of these is correct.

Wait, but the question is probably looking for one correct answer, so perhaps the best fit is something like a university degree, as in option H, which is a stock or ownership, but maybe the question is looking for something more tangible.

Alternatively, the question is about a resource used in production, not ownership. So the options that are tangible resources used in production are better. So A (crude oil), E (wheat), H (degree), I (mixer), G (share).

But looking at the options, the question is about an example, so any of these would be correct. But in the given options, perhaps the best fit is H: a university degree.

Wait, but let me think again. The question lists each option as a possible answer, and the correct answer is one of them. So which one best fits the definition of capital.

Capital resources are those that are used in production and can be stored or repurposed. So options like a university degree (H) is capital as it's an input that can be used elsewhere, like in a business. A barrel of oil (A) is also a resource that can be used in production. A university degree (H) is more like an asset, but it's investment capital.

Wait, but the question is about an example, so any of these is correct. But looking at the options, the question is in the format where only one is correct. So perhaps the best match is G: a share of corporate stock, which is capital ownership, but maybe the question is looking for a more tangible example.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is G, because a share is an ownership stake, but perhaps the question is looking for something that's a resource you own and use, so it's more like capital as a resource in the sense of the input in production.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answers are A, E, H, I, G. But the question only has one correct option. So looking back, the way the question is phrased, it's asking which is an example of capital as an economic resource. So each of these options is a correct example, but the question is expecting one letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G: a share of corporate stock, because it's a form of ownership that's considered capital. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, E: a bushel of wheat is a resource you can use in production. So that's a good example.

I'm a bit confused because several options are correct. But in the context of the question, perhaps the best fit is E: a bushel of wheat. Because it's a tangible resource used in production, whereas G is ownership. So the answer would be E.

The question asks which option is an example of capital as an economic resource. Capital refers to resources used in production that are held for future use. Analyzing the options:

- **A**: A barrel of crude oil is a liquid resource used in production.
- **E**: A bushel of wheat is a tangible resource used in farming.
- **H**: A university degree is an investment capital used in business.
- **I**: A cement mixer is an input used in construction.
- **G**: A share of corporate stock is ownership capital, but the question focuses on tangible resources.

The best example is **E: a bushel of wheat**, as it is a resource used in production. 

Answer: E
