Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this wave properties question. Let's see, the question is about what happens when a wave moves from shallow to deep water. I remember that waves have certain characteristics like frequency, wavelength, and speed. 

I think when a wave moves from a shallow area to a deeper area, the water becomes denser. The speed of the wave should increase because the deeper water is more dense, which affects the wave's speed. Wait, but how does speed relate to other properties like wavelength and frequency?

Hmm, I recall that the speed of a wave is given by the formula v = f * λ, where f is frequency and λ is wavelength. So if the speed increases, but what happens to frequency or wavelength?

Oh wait, in shallow water, the wave tends to have a higher frequency and a shorter wavelength. For example, if it's a wave moving from a calm sea to a stormy one, the waves become more frequent (higher frequency) and their wavelength shortens. But when moving into deep water, the situation changes. In deep water, the effect might be different. I think in deep water, the wave's frequency remains the same because the medium is so dense, but the wavelength increases. Let me think about the example of a wave moving from shallow to deep water: in shallow water, the wave has a longer wavelength and lower frequency. As it moves into deep water, the wavelength becomes longer because the wave's speed increases, but frequency doesn't change. So the wavelength increases and speed increases.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the effect on the medium. So when moving into deep water, the speed increases. Because the speed is higher, and if the frequency doesn't change, the wavelength must increase. So in shallow water, the frequency is higher and the wavelength is shorter. When moving to deep water, the speed increases, and the wavelength increases as well, but frequency remains the same.

Let me check the options. The options are A to J. Looking at option D: frequency increases, wavelength doesn't change, speed increases. Wait, but in my scenario, the frequency doesn't change, the wavelength increases, and speed increases. So that would be option D.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Let me correct. Oh, wait, when moving to deep water, the frequency remains the same because the medium is denser. So in shallow water, the wave has a longer wavelength and lower frequency. As it moves into deep water, it becomes a long wavelength and the same frequency, but the speed increases because the medium is denser. So the speed increases, wavelength increases, frequency remains the same.

Looking at the options:

Option D: frequency increases, wavelength does not change, speed increases. No, wait, frequency doesn't increase. So that can't be D.

Wait, let me go through each option.

Option A: frequency doesn't change. Well, no, in this case frequency would remain same, because the medium is denser, so the frequency doesn't change. But the wavelength increases and speed increases. So this would be correct. Let's see the options again.

Wait, option A: frequency same, wavelength increases, speed increases. That matches what I was thinking. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. When moving from shallow to deep water, what happens to the speed and wavelength and frequency? I think in deep water, the water is denser, so the wave speed increases. Also, the frequency remains the same because the wave's energy is conserved. So the wave changes from a longer, lower-frequency wave to a shorter, higher-frequency wave? Wait, no, because in shallow water, the wave has a longer wavelength and lower frequency. So when it moves to deep water, the wavelength becomes shorter (so higher frequency) and the speed increases. So in deep water, speed increases, wavelength decreases, frequency same.

Wait, so in the question, the wave is moving from shallow to deep. So in shallow: higher frequency, shorter wavelength. In deep: same frequency, longer wavelength, higher speed. So that would mean when moving to deep water, the wavelength increases, speed increases, and frequency remains same. But looking at the options, which one matches this.

Looking at the options, let's look at option A: frequency does not change, wavelength increases, speed increases. That matches.

So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that when moving to deep water, the wave's speed increases. So in the initial scenario, moving into deep water, would the wave have higher speed. So the options that have speed increasing would be A and E. Wait, option E says speed doesn't change, which is wrong because in deep water the speed increases.

So among A and D. Wait, no. Option D says frequency increases, which is incorrect. So the correct answer must be A.

Wait, but wait, another thought. In shallow water, the wave's velocity is lower. As it moves to deeper water, the velocity (speed) increases. So when moving from shallow to deep, the wave's speed increases, the wavelength increases, and the frequency remains the same.

So option A says frequency doesn't change, wavelength increases, speed increases. That's exactly what happens.

So the answer should be A.

When a wave moves from shallow water to deep water, the following changes occur:

1. **Frequency**: The frequency of the wave remains the same because the medium becomes denser, and the wave's energy is conserved. Thus, the frequency does not increase.

2. **Wavelength**: The wavelength of the wave increases in deep water. This is because, in shallow water, the wave has a shorter wavelength and lower frequency, while in deep water, the same energy is spread out over a longer wavelength.

3. **Speed**: The speed of the wave increases in deep water. This is due to the denser water, which exerts a greater restoring force on the wave, causing it to move faster.

Among the options provided, the correct choice is **A: frequency does not change, the wavelength increases, and the speed increases**.
