Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Federal National Mortgage Association, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that there's a term called "Fannie Mae" which stands for Federal National Mortgage Association. I've heard this mentioned a lot in the context of housing during the housing market crash. So the question is asking by what nickname this association is known. The options given are A to I, with the last letter being the chosen answer.

Looking at the options:
A: Feddie Mac
B: Fannie Mac
C: FedNat
D: Federal Mae
E: FEMA
F: FedMort
G: Frankie Mae
H: Freddie Mac
I: Morty

I know that Fannie Mae is definitely one of the names associated with this association. So I can eliminate some options. Option B is Fannie Mac, which directly gives me that.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let's go through them. Option C is "FedNat," which I think is a nickname or an alternative name, but I'm not sure. Option D is "Federal Mae." I'm not sure what that stands for. Maybe it's a typo for "Fannie Mae"? Option E is "FEMA," which I think stands for Federal Expression of Mortgage Act, which is a different association. Option F is "FedMort," which doesn't ring a bell. Options G, H, I don't seem to be related to Fannie Mae.

So, the correct nickname is Fannie Mac, which is option B. I think I've heard that name before, so that's the right answer.

The correct answer is B: Fannie Mac.
