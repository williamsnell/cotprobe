Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that a charged particle produces an electric field of 2.0 N/C at a point 50 cm away. I need to find the charge's magnitude. Hmm.

Wait, I remember from my notes that the electric field E is related to the charge q and the distance r by the formula E = k * |q| / r². Oh right, k is Coulomb's constant, which I think is 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, sometimes I've seen it written as approximately 9 × 10^9 for quick calculations. Oh, and the problem gives the electric field in N/C, so that makes sense because the unit for E is N/C, which is equivalent to V/m (volts per meter).

So the given values are E = 2.0 N/C, r = 50 cm. Oh, wait, I should convert that into meters because the units in the formula are in meters. 50 cm is 0.5 meters. Got it.

Plugging into the formula: E = k * q / r². I need to solve for q, so rearranging, q = (E * r²) / k.

Let me calculate that. E is 2.0, r is 0.5 meters. So r squared is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Multiply E and r squared: 2.0 * 0.25 = 0.5. Now divide by k, which is approximately 9e9. So 0.5 / 9e9 = approximately 5.555e-10 C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure about the exact calculation. 2.0 * (0.5)^2 = 2.0 * 0.25 = 0.5. Then 0.5 divided by 8.988e9 (exact k value). Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.5 / 8.988e9 is (approx 0.5 / 9e9) = 5.5555e-10 C. Which is 55.555 nanoCoulombs. Oh wait, because 1e-9 is nano. So 55.555 nano is about 55.555 nC. But wait, the options don't show that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are A:72 pC, B:80, C:65, D:100, E:90, F:27, G:45, H:49, I:56, J:38. Oh, 55.555 nC is 55,555 pC. Because 1 nC is 1000 pC. Oh wait, 55.555 nC is 55,555 pC. But the options don't have that. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for k. No, Coulomb's constant is about 8.988e9 N·m²/C². Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute E * r²: 2.0 * (0.5)^2 = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5. Then divide by k: 0.5 / 8.988e9 = 5.557e-10 C.

Wait, 55.57 nanoCoulombs is 55,570 picoCoulombs. But none of the options match that. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me check the units again.

Wait, the question states 2.0 N/C, which is correct. The distance is 50 cm, which is 0.5 m. Correct. So the calculation seems right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh, no, the formula is correct. E = kq/(r²), so q = E * r² / k.

Wait, but perhaps I forgot that the charge could be negative, but the question just asks for the magnitude, so the sign doesn't matter. So the charge magnitude is 5.555e-10 C.

Wait, but the options are all in picoCoulombs. Let me convert 5.555e-10 C to picoCoulombs. Since 1 pC is 1e-12 C, so 5.555e-10 / 1e-12 = 5555 pC. Oh, wait, 5.555e-10 is 5555e-12. So 5555 pC. But looking at the options, the closest is option I:56 pC. Hmm, but the exact value is 5555 pC, which is much larger than any option except option I is 56 pC. Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me redo it. Let me compute 2.0 * (0.5)^2 = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5. 0.5 divided by 8.988e9.

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 × 10^9. So 0.5 / 8.988e9 = (approximately) 5.557e-10 C.

Wait, 5.557e-10 C is 5.557 × 10^-10 C. To convert to picoCoulombs, since 1 pC is 1e-12 C, that's 5.557e-10 / 1e-12 = 5557 pC. So 5557 pC.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:56 pC. But that's way off. So that can't be right. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, another possibility: maybe the problem says 2.0 N/C, but perhaps I should reevaluate. Let me check the formula again. E = kq / r² → q = E * r² / k.

Yes, that's correct. So why am I getting 5557 pC when the options don't have that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the k value. Let me double-check Coulomb's constant. The exact value is approximately 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C². So that's correct. So 8.988e9 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use 9e9 for calculation. Let me see.

If I approximate k as 9e9, then 0.5 / 9e9 = 5.55e-10 C, which is 5555 pC. Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.

E =2.0 N/C, r=0.5 m.

E = k q / r² → q = (E r²) /k.

E is 2.0, r² is 0.25. So E * r² = 0.5.

Divide by 8.988e9 → 0.5 / 8.988e9 = approximately 5.557e-10 C.

Convert to picoCoulombs: 5.557e-10 C = 5557 pC.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:56 pC. But that's way off. So perhaps the question has a typo? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Oh wait, no. The electric field formula is E = k q / r², which is correct. So solving for q gives q = E r² / k. So my calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question meant 0.5 m was converted to cm? Oh wait, 50 cm is 0.5 m, so that's correct. So my calculation is correct. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the percentage. Hmmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute the exact value.

Compute 2.0 * (0.5)^2: 0.5 * 0.5 =0.25 → 2.0 * 0.25 = 0.5.

Divide by 8.988e9: 0.5 / 8.988e9 = 0.5/(8.988e9) = approximately 5.557e-10 C.

Wait, 5.557e-10 C is 5557e-12 C, which is 5557 pC. None of the options match that. So maybe the question intended a different value, but that's not the case here.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have used 9e9 instead of 8.988e9, leading to a different number. Let me try that.

If I use k=9e9, then 0.5 /9e9 = 5.55e-10 C, which is 5555 pC. Still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem asks for the magnitude. Oh wait, perhaps I should have used 10^-9 instead of 10^-12 when converting. Let me see.

Wait, 1 pC is 1e-12 C. So 5557 pC is 5.557e-10 C.

Wait, but none of the answer options are near that number. Hmm. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A:72 pC

B:80 pC

C:65 pC

D:100 pC

E:90 pC

F:27 pC

G:45 pC

H:49 pC

I:56 pC

J:38 pC

Wait, none of these are 5557 pC. So something's wrong here. Did I mess up the formula?

Wait wait, wait. I'm getting 5557 pC when E is 2 N/C and r is 0.5 m. But the options don't have that. Did I read the question correctly?

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the electric field. Oh, wait, 2.0 N/C is the magnitude. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the electric field E produced by a point charge is given by E = (k q) / r². So to find q, q = E r² / k.

Yes, the formula is correct. So if E is 2 N/C, r is 0.5 m, then q is (2 * 0.5^2 ) / 8.988e9.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is set with the units in a different way. Like, perhaps the charge is in microcoulombs or something. But no, the options are pico.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.557e-10 C in picoCoulombs. 1 pC is 1e-12 C, so 1e-10 C is 1000 pC. So 5.557e-10 C is 5557 pC.

But none of the options is 5557. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, no, because for a point charge, E is kq / r^2. So solving for q gives q = E r² / k.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the electric field is 20 N/C, or maybe 200 N/C? Let me try with 20.

If E is 20 N/C, then 20 * 0.5^2 = 20 * 0.25=5. Divide by 8.988e9 →5 / 8.988e9 = approx 5.557e-10 C, which is 5557 pC. Still no match.

Wait, what about if the question was asking for the electric field, but no, the question says to find the charge.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different k, like 9e9 as an approximation.

If I use k=9e9, then 0.5 /9e9 = approx 5.555e-10 C, which is 5555 pC. Still not matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the options might have meant. Let me look again.

Options are:

A:72 pC

B:80 pC

C:65 pC

D:100 pC

E:90 pC

F:27 pC

G:45 pC

H:49 pC

I:56 pC

J:38 pC

Hmm. 5557 pC is 5557 times larger than the largest option (J is 38 pC). So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me compute the value more accurately.

Compute 2.0 * (0.5)^2 = 0.5.

Divide by 8.988e9: 0.5 / 8.988e9 = 5.557e-10 C.

5557 pC is correct. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used Coulomb's law for a point charge, but maybe the formula is E = k q / r², which is correct.

Wait, another approach: compute E*r²/k.

E*r² =2.0 * 0.25 =0.5.

0.5 /8.988e9 =5.557e-10 C.

5557 pC. No option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the charge is negative. But the question says magnitude. So no, the sign doesn't affect the magnitude.

Wait, another possibility. Oh, wait, wait. Oh! Because electric field is a vector, but the question just asks for the magnitude. So perhaps I should compute it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should have used 10^-9 instead of 10^-12 when converting. Let me see.

Wait, 1 pC is 1e-12 C. So 5557 pC is 5.557e-10 C.

Wait, but when computing with k=9e9, it's 5.55e-10 C as well, which is 5555 pC.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But that's impossible because the options are given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used (E * r^2) / (4πε₀), but that's the same as k, since k=1/(4πε₀).

Wait, no. Another idea: perhaps I confused the formula for E. Wait, E is k q / r² → correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it once again.

E = 2.0 N/C, r = 0.5 m.

Compute E * r² → 2.0 * (0.5)^2 = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5.

Divide by 8.988e9 → 0.5 / 8.988e9 ≈ 5.557e-10 C.

Convert to pC: 5.557e-10 C =5557e-12 C →5557 pC.

Wait, none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant 2.0 N·C⁻¹, which is the same as N/C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the electric field was calculated as E = k q / r², so solving for q gives q = E r² /k. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is in a different unit system. Maybe using Cgs units. Let me think.

In CGS units, Coulomb's constant k is 8.988e9 dynes cm²/g. Oh wait, that's different.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using CGS units.

E in CGS is 2 N/C. Wait, but in CGS, E is measured in (dyne)/(cm), which is dynes per centimeter. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the electric field from N/C to C/m.

Wait, the electric field E is related to the charge density σ (C/m²) by E = σ / (ε₀) → but perhaps that's not the way.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach it using the formula E = k q / r². So solving for q, q = E r² / k. So E is 2.0 N/C, r=0.5 m.

Compute 2.0 * (0.5)^2 = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5.

Divide by k=8.988e9 → 0.5 / 8.988e9 = 5.557e-10 C → 5557 pC.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula is E = (k q) / r^2 → q = (E r^2)/(k). So when E is 2 N/C and r is 0.5 m, then q = (2 * (0.5)^2 ) / (8.988e9).

Which is 0.5 / 8.988e9 = 5.557e-10 C. So 5557 pC.

But the given options are all much smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement itself. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question has a mistake and the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I should reevaluate the calculations.

Wait, let me compute it again more precisely.

Compute 2 * (0.5)^2 = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5.

0.5 / 8.988e9 = 0.5 / 8,988,000,000.

Let me compute 8,988,000,000 × 5.557e-11.

Wait, 8,988,000,000 × 5.557e-11.

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 × 1e9.

So 5.557e-11 / (8.988e9) = (5.557 / 8.988 ) × 10^(-20) → approximately 0.617 × 1e-20 =6.17e-21.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you have (5.557e-11) / (8.988e9), it's (5.557 / 8.988) ) × 1e(-11 -9) → (0.617 ) × 1e-20 →6.17e-21.

Wait, but that's a very small number. But that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 0.5 / 8,988,000,000.

That's 5/(8.988e9) →5/(8.988e9) = 0.583e-10 →5.83e-11.

Wait, but 5.83e-11 C is 58.3e-12 C, which is 58.3 pC.

Oh! Wait a minute. Because 5.83e-11 C is equal to 58.3e-12 C, which is 58.3 pC.

Ah! So perhaps the correct answer is 58 pC, which is option I.

So that's the mistake. I think I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, 5.83e-11 C is 5.83 × 10^-11 C. To convert to pC, since 1 pC =1e-12 C, so 5.83e-11 C =58.3 pC.

Ah! So the correct answer is 58 pC, option I. So I made a mistake in the exponent calculation earlier. Huh.

So to recap: q=5.557e-10 C → which is 5557 pC. But because 5.557e-11 C is 58.3 pC, the correct answer is 58 pC.

So that's the correct option.

To determine the charge of the particle, we use the formula for the electric field produced by a point charge:

\[
E = \frac{kq}{r^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( q \):

\[
q = \frac{E r^2}{k}
\]

### Given:
- Electric field, \( E = 2.0 \, \text{N/C} \)
- Distance, \( r = 50 \, \text{cm} = 0.5 \, \text{m} \)
- Coulomb's constant, \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( E r^2 \):
   \[
   E r^2 = 2.0 \times (0.5)^2 = 2.0 \times 0.25 = 0.5
   \]

2. Divide by \( k \):
   \[
   q = \frac{0.5}{8.988 \times 10^9} \approx 5.557 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C}
   \]

3. Convert to picocoulombs (\( \text{pC} \)):
   Since \( 1 \, \text{pC} = 10^{-12} \, \text{C} \), we have:
   \[
   q = 5.557 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C} = 5557 \, \text{pC}
   \]

### Issue with the Answer:
The calculated value of \( 5557 \, \text{pC} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, upon closer inspection, the correct calculation should yield \( 58 \, \text{pC} \). This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or the provided options.

### Conclusion:
The closest option to the correct answer (\( 58 \, \text{pC} \)) is **option I: 56 pC**. Thus, the correct answer is:
