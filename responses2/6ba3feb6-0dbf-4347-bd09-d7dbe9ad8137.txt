Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Stevenson's primary aim in his paper. Hmm. I'm not entirely sure about the context, but I remember that Stevenson is a philosopher known for his work on moral philosophy, especially moral theories like deontological ethics. 

Wait, the question is a bit tricky because it's phrased as a direct question about Stevenson's paper's primary focus. But I don't have the exact text of the paper. So I'm going to have to rely on what I know about his main works.

I think Stevenson wrote a lot on moral theories, and one of his famous works is "Theories of Morality" or something like that. From what I recall, in "Theories of Morality," Stevenson explores different moral theories. He probably discusses how morality is about rightness and wrongness, but not the soft versus hard morality. 

Looking at the options:

A: provide an account of what makes right actions right. That sounds like he's talking about the criteria for rightness, like something that justifies an action. Maybe deontological ethics where actions are right based on their form, not their content.

B: establish which things are good in themselves. That might be more about the nature of goods, like what makes something good. But I'm not sure if Stevenson was the one who established that, or if it's another philosopher.

C: develop a theory of good moral character. This seems to be about the character or the moral qualities, like being just or right in one's actions. Deontological ethics focuses on moral character rather than the consequences, so maybe that's more about the moral character than the rightness of an action itself.

D: make ethical questions clear. That might relate to how he presented his theories, making them clear and accessible. He's known for his clear writing style.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Stevenson's "Theories of Morality" is one of the foundational texts. He discusses various moral theories, including deontological, Utilitarian, and Keglesworth's sense of rightness. 

In his work, he might aim to provide a clear account of different moral theories. So option D would be about making ethical questions clear. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the primary aim.

Alternatively, option A is about what makes actions right, which ties into deontological ethics. Stevenson's aim might be to clarify the criteria for rightness. Option C seems to focus on moral character, which is more about the character's rightness rather than the actions' rightness.

Wait, another angle: I think Stevenson's main aim was to present and evaluate various moral theories, making the ideas clear and accessible. So option D might be the answer, as it's about making ethical questions clear.

But I'm also thinking that option A is more about the criteria for rightness. If Stevenson wanted to explain why certain actions are right, he'd focus on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the primary aim is to clarify ethical questions, making them clear and distinct. So I'm between options A and D.

I think I should recall that Stevenson's work was about moral theories, and he aimed to make them clear and accessible. So option D, making ethical questions clear, would be the primary aim.

The primary aim of Stevenson's paper is to make ethical questions clear and accessible. This aligns with his work in presenting and evaluating moral theories, aiming to clarify the criteria for right actions and the nature of moral goods.
