Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cone clutch. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is asking me to evaluate the force on the spring of a cone clutch. Wait, wait, actually, I think I remember that a cone clutch applies torque, not a force. Oh wait, no. Wait, the spring is part of the clutch mechanism. So the spring provides the torque, and the force is related to the torque and the spring's properties. 

The given data: torque is 2000 lbs-in. Mean diameter is 18 inches. Clutch angle is 10 degrees, and coefficient of friction is 0.30. 

I think the formula for the torque transmitted by a cone clutch is T = (F * D * μ * cos(φ)) / (2 * sin(α)), where F is the force, D is the mean diameter, μ is the coefficient of friction, φ is the friction angle, and α is the clutch angle. Wait, I'm not sure about that formula. Alternatively, another formula I've seen is T = (F * D * μ * sin(φ)) / (2 * sin(α)). Hmm, I might be getting this mixed up.

Wait, I think φ is the angle between the friction surfaces, which is equal to α, the clutch angle. Because the friction angle φ is equal to the clutch angle α. Because for a cone clutch, the friction angle φ is equal to the angle of the cone's sides. So φ is equal to α. So that might simplify things.

So if φ = α, then the formula simplifies. Let me try to recall.

Another approach: the torque transmitted by a cone clutch is given by T = (F * D * μ * sin φ) / (2 * sin α). Wait, but if φ equals α, then it's T = (F * D * μ * sin α) / (2 * sin α) = (F * D * μ) / 2. So T = (F D μ)/2. 

Wait, that makes sense because if φ is equal to α, the sine terms cancel out, and you get a simpler formula. So then, solving for F, F = (2T) / (D * μ). 

Let me check the units to make sure. T is in lb-in. D is in inches, μ is unitless. So F would be in lb. That makes sense.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I got the formula correctly. Because sometimes I've seen it as T = (F * D * μ * cos α) / (2 * sin α). But that would be if φ is something else. No, wait, when φ equals α, it's T = (F * D * μ) / (2). So that formula would be correct.

So using that, let's plug in the numbers.

T = 2000 lbs-in.

D = 18 inches.

μ = 0.30.

So F = (2 * T) / (D * μ) = (2*2000)/(18 * 0.30).

Calculate denominator: 18 * 0.30 =5.4.

So numerator is 4000.

4000 /5.4 = ?

Let me calculate that. 5.4 goes into 4000 how many times.

5.4 * 740 = 5.4 *700 = 3780; 5.4 *40=216. 3780+216=3996. So 5.4 *740=3996, which is close to 4000. The difference is 4. So 740 + (4/5.4) = 740 + ~0.740=740.740 approximately.

Wait, so 740.74 approximately. Hmm, the options are A to J, with some around 85-250. So 740 seems way too high. That can't be right. Did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check the formula for the torque in a cone clutch. Another approach: I think the correct formula is T = (F * D * μ) / (2 * sin α). Wait, no, if α is the angle of the cone, then sin α is involved. Wait, let's get this right.

Wait, I think the correct formula is T = (F * D * μ) / (2 * sin α). Wait, but if φ is equal to α, then earlier I thought T = (F * D * μ) / (2). But that doesn't include sin α in the denominator. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is T = (F D μ sin φ) / (2 sin α). Since φ is the friction angle, which is α. So, T = (F D μ sin α) / (2 sin α) )= (F D μ )/ 2. So that's the same as before, leading to the same F.

Wait, but then why am I getting such a high number for F? The answer options are much lower. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the torque as T = (F * D * μ) / (2 * sin α). So then, solving for F: F = (2T sin α) / (D μ).

Wait, but if I have F = (2T) / (D μ) * (1 / sin φ ), but φ = alpha.

Wait, perhaps I need to write down the correct formula.

After some research (in my mind), I recall that the torque transmitted by a cone clutch is given by T = (F * D * μ) / (2 * sin α). Because the friction angle φ is equal to α, so the sine of φ is sin α. So substituting φ=α, the formula simplifies to T = (F D μ) / (2 sin α). 

Wait, now I'm a bit confused. Let me see an example. Suppose the friction angle is 10 degrees. If I have a torque of 2000 lb-in, what is the force?

Wait, but in the formula, F = (2T sin α) / (D μ). Let me plug in the numbers.

T=2000, D=18, μ=0.3, α=10 degrees.

So sin(10) is approximately 0.1736.

So F = (2 * 2000 * 0.1736) / (18 * 0.30).

Calculate numerator: 2 * 2000 =4000; 4000 * 0.1736= 694.4.

Denominator: 18*0.30=5.4.

So 694.4 /5.4 ≈ 129.35 lb.

Looking at the options, option C is 128.6, which is very close to this calculation. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but why did I get a different number earlier when I thought the formula was different? Because earlier I tried using T = (F D μ ) / 2, which would give F= (2T)/(D μ) = (4000)/(18 *0.3)= 4000/(5.4)=740.74, which is way too high. So I must have been using the formula wrong.

Ah, I see. So the correct formula is T = (F D μ) / (2 sin α). Therefore, the correct calculation gives F≈129.35, which is option C.

To evaluate the force on the spring of a cone clutch, we start by identifying the formula that relates the torque transmitted (T), the force (F), the mean diameter (D), the coefficient of friction (μ), and the clutch angle (α). The key relationship is:

\[
T = \frac{F \cdot D \cdot \mu}{2 \cdot \sin \alpha}
\]

Rearranging for \( F \):

\[
F = \frac{2T \cdot \sin \alpha}{D \cdot \mu}
\]

### Given Data:
- Torque, \( T = 2000 \, \text{lb-in} \)
- Mean diameter, \( D = 18 \, \text{in} \)
- Coefficient of friction, \( \mu = 0.30 \)
- Clutch angle, \( \alpha = 10^\circ \)

### Calculation:
1. Convert \( \sin \alpha \) to decimal:
   \[
   \sin(10^\circ) \approx 0.1736
   \]

2. Substitute the values into the formula for \( F \):
   \[
   F = \frac{2 \cdot 2000 \cdot 0.1736}{18 \cdot 0.30}
   \]

3. Simplify the numerator:
   \[
   2 \cdot 2000 \cdot 0.1736 = 694.4
   \]

4. Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   18 \cdot 0.30 = 5.4
   \]

5. Divide to find \( F \):
   \[
   F = \frac{694.4}{5.4} \approx 129.35 \, \text{lb}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated force is approximately \( 129.35 \, \text{lb} \), which matches closely with option **C: 128.6 lbs**.
