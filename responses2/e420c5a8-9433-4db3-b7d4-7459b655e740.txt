Question:

A race car attempting to jump a series of 8 buses is set up on a flat track with a ramp at the end. Engineers assigned to the project have determined that, in order to jump the buses, the car must reach a velocity of 130 km/h. If the distance of the track is 50m, at what rate must the car accelerate to reach this velocity?

D: 20 m/s^2
E: 17 m/s^2
F: 15 m/s^2
G: 7 m/s^2
H: 13 m/s^2
I: 18 m/s^2

Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Okay, the question is about a race car jumping buses on a flat track with a ramp at the end. The engineers say the car needs to reach a velocity of 130 km/h to jump the buses. The track is 50 meters long, and I need to find the rate at which the car must accelerate.

Hmm, wait, what do I know about acceleration and velocity? Oh right, acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes over time. Since the car starts from rest (assuming it's starting from a stop) and needs to reach a certain velocity, the formula for acceleration is a = (v_f - v_i) / t. But wait, I don't know the time here. The problem doesn't give the time, so I must be missing something.

Wait, no, the question is asking for the rate of acceleration, which is acceleration. Oh right, acceleration is a vector; in this case, it's the rate at which velocity increases. So, I think I need to convert the velocity from km/h to m/s because the distance is given in meters and acceleration is in m/s², which are compatible units.

Let me do that conversion. 130 km/h to m/s. I remember that to convert km/h to m/s, you divide by 3.6. So, 130 / 3.6. Let's compute that. 130 ÷ 3.6. Well, 3.6 times 36 is 129.6, so 36 times 3.6 is 129.6, which is very close to 130. So, 130 ÷3.6 is approximately 36.111 m/s. Let me compute more accurately: 3.6 * 36 = 129.6, so 130 -129.6 is 0.4. So 0.4 /3.6 = 0.111... So, 36.111 m/s. Let's just say approximately 36.11 m/s for calculation.

Now, the formula for acceleration when starting from rest (v_i=0) is a = (v_f - v_i)/t → a = v_f / t. But wait, I don't have time, so I must think differently. Oh wait, the problem says the distance is 50m. Oh, right! So maybe I can use the equation of motion that relates acceleration, distance, and velocity. The equation is v² = u² + 2as, where u is initial velocity (0 here), a is acceleration, s is distance, and v is final velocity.

So substituting the known values: (36.11)^2 = 0 + 2*a*50. Let me compute 36.11 squared. 36 squared is 1296. 0.11 squared is about 0.0121. The cross term is 2 * 36 * 0.11 = 7.92. So, (36 + 0.11)^2 ≈ 36² + 2*36*0.11 + 0.11² = 1296 + 7.92 + 0.0121 = 1303.9321. So approximately 1303.93 m²/s².

Now, plug into the equation: 1303.93 = 2 * a *50. So, 1303.93 = 100 *a → a ≈ 13.0393 m/s². So approximately 13 m/s².

Looking at the options, option H is 13 m/s², so that's probably the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me redo the calculation properly. Let me compute 130 km/h to m/s. 130 divided by 3.6. 3.6 × 36 = 129.6. 3.6 × 36.111 = 130. So, 130 /3.6 is 36.111 m/s. Correct.

Then, using v² = 2as: (36.111)^2 = 2 * a * 50 → 1303.93 = 100a → a ≈13.04 m/s². So about 13 m/s². So option H is correct.

To determine the acceleration required for the race car, we start by converting the target velocity from km/h to m/s. Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{km/h} = \frac{1}{3.6} \, \text{m/s} \), we find:

\[
130 \, \text{km/h} = \frac{130}{3.6} \, \text{m/s} \approx 36.11 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Next, we use the kinematic equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \), where \( u = 0 \, \text{m/s} \) (initial velocity), \( v = 36.11 \, \text{m/s} \) (final velocity), and \( s = 50 \, \text{m} \) (distance). Substituting these values:

\[
(36.11)^2 = 2a(50).
\]

Calculating \( (36.11)^2 \):

\[
36.11^2 \approx 1303.93 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]

Thus:

\[
1303.93 = 100a \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx 13.04 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 13 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which corresponds to option H.
