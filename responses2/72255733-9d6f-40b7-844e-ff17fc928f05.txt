Question:

Summer, a single individual, had a net operating loss of $20,000 three years ago. A Code Sec. 1244 stock loss made up three-fourths of that loss. Summer had no taxable income from that year until the current year. In the current year, Summer has gross income of $80,000 and sustains another loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock. Assuming that Summer can carry the entire $20,000 net operating loss to the current year, what is the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year?

Options:

A: $20,000 capital loss.
B: $30,000 ordinary loss.
C: $40,000 capital loss.
D: $40,000 ordinary loss.
E: $30,000 capital loss.
F: $35,000 ordinary loss.
G: $50,000 capital loss.
H: $20,000 ordinary loss.
I: $50,000 ordinary loss.
J: $35,000 capital loss.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tax question about Code Sec. 1244 stock losses. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Summer had a net operating loss (NOL) of $20,000 three years ago. Three-fourths of that loss was from Code Sec. 1244 stock. So, 3/4 * 20,000 is 15,000. That means she had a $15,000 Code Sec. 1244 loss three years ago. And she had no taxable income from that year until now.

In the current year, she has $80,000 of gross income. She also has another loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock. The question is about how much of this current year's loss she can deduct, and what type of loss it is.

The question says she can carry the entire $20,000 NOL from the previous year forward. So, she can use that $20,000 to offset her current year's losses.

Now, the current year's loss is $80,000 plus another $50,000, totaling $130,000. But she can only deduct up to her current year's losses, which are $130,000. However, she can only carry forward her previous year's NOL of $20,000 if it's appropriate.

Wait, but there's more. The way NOLs work is that you can carry them forward as a deduction against taxable income. So, her total deduction for the current year would be the $20,000 NOL plus the current year's losses. But wait, no, because her current year's losses are $80,000 plus $50,000, which is $130,000. But she can only use $20,000 from the NOL. So, her deduction would be $20,000 plus the current year losses that she can offset.

Wait, no. Let me think again. She can only carry forward her previous year's NOL if it's appropriate. So, the previous year's NOL of $20,000 can be carried forward to the current year as a deduction. So, her current year's losses are $130,000, but she can only deduct $20,000 of that. The rest would be carried as a capital loss because she can't carry them forward beyond the NOL deduction.

Wait, but wait, she has another loss this year of $50,000. So, she has $50,000 of current year losses, and $130,000 in total. But she can only carry forward $20,000 of the previous year's NOL.

So, the total deductions for the current year would be $20,000 (carry forward) plus $50,000 (current year loss), totaling $70,000. But wait, that's not right because the $20,000 is a deduction, and the $50,000 is a loss, so the total would be $70,000. But can she deduct $50,000 on ordinary loss because it's a separate loss? Hmm.

Wait, no. Because she can only carry forward up to the $20,000 she can use. So, the $20,000 is a deduction, and the $50,000 is a loss. So, she can only deduct $20,000 for the NOL, and then the $50,000 is a loss that can be carried forward as a capital loss because it's not part of the NOL deduction. So, the total capital loss she can deduct is $50,000. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, the NOL she can use is $20,000, which she can carry forward. So, the current year's losses are $50,000 (a loss) plus $80,000 (a gain?), wait no, no, wait. No, Summer has $80,000 of gross income this year, but no other income. So, the $80,000 is income, so she can't use it to offset the $50,000 loss. So, the $50,000 loss is a current-year loss that can't be offset by current-year income; it has to be carried forward.

Wait, but wait: she has a current-year loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock. So, that's a loss. She can carry that forward as a capital loss because she can't offset it with her current-year income. But her previous year's NOL of $20,000 can be used to offset this year's losses.

So, the total amount she can deduct this year is $20,000 (from previous year's NOL) plus $50,000 (from current year's loss), totaling $70,000. The $50,000 is a capital loss.

Wait, but how does that work? Because she can only carry forward $20,000 of her previous year's NOL. So, she can use $20,000 of her current-year loss to offset that. Then, the remaining $50,000 is a capital loss that she can't offset because it's not part of her current-year income.

Wait, no. The $20,000 she can carry forward. So, in the current year, she has $50,000 of loss. So, she can only use $20,000 from the NOL to offset, but the $50,000 is a loss. So, she can't use the $20,000 to offset the $50,000 loss. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me approach this differently. When she can carry forward previous year's NOL, that NOL can be used to offset this year's income or current-year losses. So, in this case, her previous year's NOL of $20,000 can be used to offset this year's $80,000 income and the $50,000 loss.

Wait, but she can't offset the $50,000 loss with income. The $50,000 loss is a loss, so she can't offset it with her income. So, the $20,000 NOL can be used to offset her current year's income, which is $80,000. She would have $80,000 - $20,000 = $60,000 taxable income, which is possible.

But the $50,000 loss is a loss that can't be offset by her income, so she has to carry that forward as a capital loss. Therefore, the total capital loss she can deduct is $50,000.

Wait, but wait. The $20,000 NOL she can carry forward is $20,000. So, she can't use the entire $20,000 to offset the $50,000 loss. So, the $20,000 can be used to offset $20,000 of this year's income, which is $80,000. So, her taxable income would then be $80,000 - $20,000 = $60,000. But the loss she has this year is $50,000, which can't be offset by her income, so she has to carry that forward as a capital loss.

So, the total amount she can deduct is $20,000 (carry forward) and $50,000 (current year loss that's a capital loss). So, her total deduction is $70,000.

But wait, the question is about the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss she can deduct. So, the NOL is a capital loss because it's on Code Sec. 1244. The $50,000 loss is also a capital loss.

Wait, but wait, is the $50,000 a capital loss or an ordinary loss? Because she's using her previous-year NOL to offset this year's income, the $50,000 loss is a capital loss because it's not related to current income. So, Summer can only carry forward $20,000 of the NOL, and the remaining $50,000 is a capital loss.

So, the total capital loss she can deduct is $50,000, making option D the correct answer. Because she can carry forward $20,000 and the $50,000 loss is a capital loss.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is about the amount and character of the loss she can deduct for the current year. So, she can deduct $20,000 as a capital loss, and the $50,000 is a capital loss as well. So, her total capital loss is $70,000, but the question is about what she can deduct as a single amount. Wait no, the question says, "the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year?"

Wait, no, the options are individual amounts. So, she can deduct a total of $70,000, but the options are individual amounts. But the options don't have a '70,000' option. Let me check. The options are A to J, with options like $20K, $30K, etc. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, no. The question is about the character of the loss she can deduct. She can use her previous-year NOL of $20,000 to offset the current year's income. So, the $20,000 is a capital loss. The $50,000 loss is also a capital loss. So, the total capital loss she can deduct is $70,000. But the options don't have that. Oh wait, perhaps the options are only about the character and the amount, not the total. Let me read the options again.

The options are A through J, each with a single amount: like A is $20,000 capital, etc. The question is asking for the amount and character of the loss she can deduct.

Wait, but the options don't have a combined figure. So perhaps the answer is that she can deduct a total of $70,000, but the options are individual. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that she can only use her NOL to offset the current year's income, and the rest of the current year's loss is carried forward.

Wait, let me think again.

She had a net operating loss of $20,000 three years ago. Three-fourths of that was from Code Sec. 1244 stock: 15,000. So, she used her previous year's NOL of $20,000 to offset her current year's income. So, she can deduct $20,000 in capital loss because it's from previous year's NOL. Then, her current year's losses are $80,000 (income) and $50,000 (loss). But the $50,000 loss is a current-year loss on code 1244, which she can't offset with her current-year income, so that must be carried forward as a capital loss.

Wait, but does she have any other current-year losses? She has $50,000 on code 1244. So, she can't offset that with her income; so she has to carry that forward as a capital loss. So, her total capital loss is $20,000 (from NOL) plus $50,000 (carryforward) = $70,000.

But the options don't have a $70,000 option. So perhaps the question is only about the character and the amount of the loss she can deduct, not the total. Let me read the question again.

The question is: "What is the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year?"

The options are A to J, each with a single amount, either capital or ordinary. Wait, no, the options are all specific, meaning each option is a single amount, not a combination. So, perhaps the correct answer is that she can deduct a total of $20,000, but that's only part of it. Or perhaps the answer is $50,000 because that's the amount she can carry forward, which is a capital loss.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what she can deduct. She can carry forward $20,000 of her NOL. So, in her current year, she can only deduct that $20,000 as a capital loss because she used it to offset her income. The $50,000 loss on Code Sec. 1244 can't be offset by her current-year income, so it must be carried forward as a capital loss.

So, the total capital loss she can deduct is $20,000 + $50,000 = $70,000. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is only asking about the amount she can deduct, but the options don't have the total. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options A to J are each single amounts. So, perhaps the question is about the maximum she can deduct. Wait, no, maybe the question is trickier.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The code 1244 stock is a short-term loss, right? Because the NOL is three-fourths of the $20,000, which is 15,000. Three-fourths is 75% of 20k, which is 15k. So, her previous year's NOL is $15,000, which is a short-term loss because it's for a single stock. So, she can carry that forward as a short-term loss.

But in the current year, she has a $50,000 loss on code 1244. Since it's for a single stock, it's a short-term loss as well. So, she can carry forward that as a short-term loss.

Wait, but wait. The previous year's NOL was three-fourths of the $20,000, which was $15,000. So, she can carry that $15,000 as a short-term capital loss to the current year. Then, the current year's loss of $50,000, which is a short-term loss, can be carried forward as a short-term loss.

But wait, in the current year, Summer has $80,000 income. So, she can't use that to offset the $50,000 loss, because that's a loss. So, she can't carry it forward as a capital loss. Wait, but the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss, so she can carry it forward as a short-term loss.

Wait, but her previous year's NOL was $15,000, which she can use to offset her current-year losses. So, she can use $15,000 of the $80,000 income to offset that. So, her taxable income would be $65,000 (80k -15k=65k). But the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss that can be carried forward as a short-term loss because it's a short-term stock loss.

Wait, but wait, the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss because it's on Code Sec. 1244, which is a short-term stock. So, she can carry that forward as a short-term loss.

But the question is about the current year's loss. So, she can only carry forward her previous year's NOL of $15,000 as a short-term capital loss, and the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss that can be carried forward, but she can't use it to offset income because she's already used her income.

Wait, no, she can't offset the $50,000 loss with her income. So, the $50,000 loss can't be offset by income, so she must carry that forward as a short-term loss.

So, in the current year, she can deduct $15,000 as a short-term loss, but the question is about the total she can deduct for the current year.

Wait, but the question is about the amount and character of the code sec. 1244 loss that she can deduct for the current year. So, she can't use the $20,000 NOL because it's for code sec. 1244, which is a short-term stock. The $15,000 NOL can be carried forward as a short-term loss. The current year's loss of $50,000 is a short-term loss as well, so she can carry that forward as a short-term loss.

Wait, but Summer's current year's loss is $50,000. So, if she can't carry that forward because it's not part of the NOL deduction, then she can’t offset it with her income. So, she must carry that forward as a short-term loss.

But wait, the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss. So, she can carry it forward to the next year as a short-term loss. But in the current year, she can't use that $50,000 loss to offset her taxable income because she only has $80,000 and the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss, so she can't use that $50,000 to offset her income. So, she must carry that as a short-term loss.

Wait, but in the current year, she can only carry forward her previous year's NOL of $15,000, because that was a short-term loss. So, the $50,000 loss can't be offset by income; it must be carried forward as a short-term loss.

But wait, she can carry forward the $50,000 loss because it's a short-term loss. So, in the current year, she can't use that $50,000 loss to offset her income; it must be carried forward as a short-term loss.

So, the total amount she can deduct for the current year is: $15,000 (from previous year's NOL) and $50,000 (current year's loss). So, the total is $65,000, but the question is about the character and amount of the loss she can deduct.

Wait, no. The question is asking for the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss she can deduct for the current year. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me read it again.

"Summer, a single taxpayer, had a net operating loss of $20,000 three years ago. Three-fourths of that was on Code Sec. 1244 stock, so $15,000 of that loss is on code sec. 1244 stock. Three years ago, she had a $20,000 NOL, which she carried forward. This year, she has a $50,000 loss on code sec. 1244 stock."

So, the question is, what can she deduct for the current year. She can use her previous year's $15,000 NOL to offset this year's income. Then, she has a $50,000 loss on code sec. 1244, which is a short-term loss. So, she can carry that forward as a short-term loss.

But wait, is the $50,000 loss on code sec. 1244 a capital loss or a short-term loss? Because the $50,000 loss is on code sec. 1244, which is a short-term stock. So, the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss. So, she can carry that forward as a short-term loss.

Wait, but the question is about the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year. So, she can't deduct the $50,000 loss because she can't offset it with her income. So, she can't deduct that, so the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss that can't be offset by income, so she has to carry that forward as a short-term loss.

Wait, but the question isn't about whether she can deduct that loss. It's about the amount and character of the loss she can deduct for the current year. So, she can't use the $20,000 NOL because it's a Code Sec. 1244 loss, which is a short-term stock. So, she can only use $15,000 of her NOL to offset this year's income. Then, the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss and can be carried forward.

Wait, but Summer's current year's loss is $50,000. So, if she can't carry that forward because it's not part of the NOL deduction, then she can’t offset it with her income. So, she must carry that forward as a short-term loss.

But the question is about the character and amount of the loss she can deduct for the current year. So, she can't deduct the $50,000 loss because she can't offset it. So, she can only deduct the $15,000 NOL that's on code sec. 1244. But the question is about the amount and character of the loss she can deduct, not the NOL.

Wait, no, the question is specifically about the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss she can deduct. So, she can't deduct the $50,000 loss because it can't be offset by income. But she can deduct the $15,000 NOL because that's a short-term loss and can be used to offset income. But the question is asking about the Code Sec. 1244 loss, not the NOL.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently: Summer can carry forward her previous year's NOL of $20,000, which is a short-term loss (since the NOL was for one stock, and the NOL was $15,000, three-fourths of the $20,000). So, she can use that $15,000 to offset this year's income. Then, her current year's loss is $50,000 on code sec. 1244, which is a short-term loss. So, she can carry that forward as a short-term loss because it's a short-term loss.

Wait, but if she can carry that forward, she can't use it to offset her current-year income. So, the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss. So, she can carry that forward as a short-term loss. So, the total capital loss she can deduct is $50,000, which is a short-term loss.

But the question is about the character and amount of the loss she can deduct. So, she can deduct $50,000 as a short-term loss. So, the correct answer is option D: $50,000 short-term loss.

Wait, but earlier I thought that she could only use $15,000 of her NOL to offset this year's income, and the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss that can be carried forward. So, she can't offset the $50,000 loss with her income, so she must carry that forward as a short-term loss. So, the answer would be D: $50,000 short-term loss.

Wait, but let me check another angle. The previous year's NOL of $20,000 was $15,000 on code sec. 1244. So, she can carry that $15,000 as a short-term capital loss to the current year. Then, the current year's loss is $50,000 on code sec. 1244, which is a short-term loss. So, she can carry that forward as a short-term loss.

Wait, but the question is about the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss. So, she can't deduct the $50,000 loss because she can't offset it with her income. So, the $50,000 loss is a short-term loss that can't be offset by income, so she can't use that to offset her income. Therefore, the $50,000 loss can't be offset by income, so it has to be carried forward as a short-term loss.

Therefore, the amount she can deduct is $50,000, a short-term loss. So, the correct answer is D: $50,000 short-term loss.
</think>

Summer had a net operating loss (NOL) of $20,000 three years ago, with three-fourths ($15,000) on Code Sec. 1244 stock. She carried this NOL forward to the current year. This year, she has a $50,000 loss on Code Sec. 1244 stock, which is a short-term loss.

### Analysis:
1. **Previous Year's NOL**: Summer used her $15,000 NOL from Code Sec. 1244 stock to offset this year's income. This $15,000 can be used to offset her taxable income, but it cannot offset this year's $50,000 loss.

2. **Current Year's Loss**: Summer has a $50,000 loss on Code Sec. 1244 stock, which is a short-term loss. Since it cannot be offset by her taxable income, she must carry this loss forward to the next year as a short-term loss.

3. **Character of the Loss**: The $50,000 loss is a short-term loss because it is related to a single stock.

### Conclusion:
Summer can deduct a total of $50,000 as a short-term loss for the current year because she cannot offset this year's $50,000 loss with her income.

ANSWER: D
