Question:

A landowner was the record owner of a 30-acre orchard outside the city. The landowner lived in a farmhouse on the orchard and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the orchard directly to the west was a 10-acre vineyard that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. A four-lane highway adjoined the orchard directly to the east. The farmer discovered that the southern portion of the orchard was rarely used by the landowner for any of the landowner's farming activities and found a convenient gravel road leading from the vineyard across the orchard all the way to the four- lane highway. The farmer used this road adversely and openly for the entire 20-year prescriptive period, and in doing so, the farmer has acquired a prescriptive easement over the roadway across the orchard. Thereafter, the farmer conveys the vineyard to a buyer in fee simple. The deed recited that "the grantor hereby conveys the vineyard, together with an easement for the right of way across the orcharX, to the grantee. "After the buyer took possession of the vineyard, the landowner brought an appropriate action to prevent him from using the roadway across the orchard. The issue that will determine the outcome of this suit is whether

Options:

A: the easement was appurtenant.
B: the roadway was necessary for the farmer's use of the vineyard.
C: easements can be reserved to third parties.
D: the buyer had knowledge of the easement prior to purchasing the vineyard.
E: the description in the farmer's deed to the buyer was adequate to identify the portion of the orchard that the farmer used as a roadway.
F: the farmer had the right to transfer the easement to the buyer.
G: the landowner had given express permission for the roadway to be used.
H: the buyer will make excessive use of the roadway.
I: the farmer used the roadway continuously for the required prescriptive period.
J: the deed mentioned the easement specifically.

Okay, so I have this property law question here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about easements and their application. The scenario is that a landowner owns an orchard and a vineyard. The orchard is adjacent to a vineyard, which is owned by a farmer in fee simple. There's a four-lane highway next to the orchard, and the landowner used the property to raise produce. The farmer found a gravel road connecting the vineyard to the orchard and used it against the landowner for 20 years. Now, he sells the vineyard to a buyer and has a deed that says he conveys the vineyard together with an easement for the right of way across the orchard to the buyer. 

The question is asking about the outcome of a suit initiated by the landowner. The options are about whether the easement is appurtenant, if the road was necessary for the farmer's use, whether third parties can have easements reserved, etc. I need to choose which fact determines the outcome.

Let me break down the key points.

1. The landowner lives on the orchard and uses it for farming. The vineyard is adjacent but isn't part of the landowner's. The farmer found a gravel road from the vineyard to the orchard. The landowner used this road for 20 years.

2. The farmer used this road in a way that's adverse to his interests. So, maybe he's imposing his right of passage, making the orchard unusable for farming or other activities.

3. The deed conveys the vineyard and an easement for the right of way across the orchard to the buyer. So, the easement is for the right of way over the existing road leading to the orchard.

Now, the question is about the nature of the easement.

The options are about the easement being appurtenant, necessity of the road, third party easements, etc.

Appurtenant easements are those that are specifically used by the owner. The landowner's land uses the road for farming and other activities, so it's naturally an easement. The road connects the vineyard and the orchard, which are both parts of the landowner's property. So, the easement is appurtenant because it's used by the landowner.

Option A says the easement was appurtenant. That sounds correct because the landowner's use of the road for farming and other activities would make it an easement for the landowner.

Option B says the road was necessary for the farmer's use. The farmer used the road for 20 years, so it's necessary. But the question is about the easement's nature, not its necessity.

Option C talks about third parties having easements. But here, the easement is specifically with the landowner, so it's not a third party's. So, C is probably not correct.

Option D: The buyer had knowledge of the easement. The deed says so, so D is correct but not the issue here.

Option E: The description in the deed was adequate. The deed explicitly says the grantor conveys the vineyard and the easement. So E is correct.

Option F: The landowner gave express permission. The question says he discovered the road was rarely used, so he didn't have express permission. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The landowner gave express permission. Again, no, because he didn't get permissionâ€” he found the road and used it.

Option H: The buyer makes excessive use. The landowner's use was adverse, but it doesn't say the buyer made excessive use. So H is not relevant here.

Option I: The landowner used the road continuously. The question says he used it for 20 years, but it's a prescriptive period. Prescriptive often refers to a continuous use, so I think the landowner used it for the required time, making it appurtenant.

Option J: The deed mentions the easement. Yes, it does.

So, the question is which fact determines the outcome. The key is whether the easement is appurtenant. Because if the easement is appurtenant, it's part of the landowner's use, so the landowner can't just use the road for personal enjoyment. If the easement was appurtenant, then the landowner's use would negate the easement.

Wait, but the landowner's actions are adverse. That might affect the enforceability of the easement. But the question is about whether the easement is appurtenant. So the correct answer is A, because the easement is naturally part of the landowner's land use.

So, among the options, A and E are correct. But in the question, the options are each separate. Let me see the options again:

The question is asking about the outcome, so the fact that determines the outcome. The question is about whether the easement is appurtenant. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but the options are separate, so the correct answer is A: the easement was appurtenant.

Alternatively, the question is about the nature of the easement. The key is whether the road is appurtenant, meaning it's part of the landowner's use. The correct answer is A because it's part of the landowner's use, so the easement is appurtenant.

So the correct answer is A.

The question revolves around determining the nature of an easement in a property law context. The landowner uses the road for farming and other activities, making it an appurtenant easement. The key issue is whether the easement is appurtenant, which is essential for its enforceability.

1. **Option A**: The easement was appurtenant. This is correct because the landowner's use of the road for farming and other activities makes it naturally an appurtenant easement.

2. **Option E**: The description in the deed was adequate to identify the portion of the orchard that the farmer used as a right-of-way. This is correct as the deed explicitly conveys the easement.

The question asks which fact determines the outcome of the suit. The nature of the easement (whether it is appurtenant) is central to determining enforceability. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: A**
