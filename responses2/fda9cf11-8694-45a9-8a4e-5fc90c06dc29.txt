Okay, so I need to figure out which option corresponds to Sinnott-Armstrong's focus on moral obligations. I remember that Sinnott-Armstrong is a philosopher known for his work on moral responsibility and obligation. His main book is "Moral Obligation: An Analysis of the Concept of Moral Responsibility."

Looking at the options, they range from educational institutions to societies, including humans. The question is about the moral obligations of these entities. From what I recall, his work delves into how people are obligated to act in certain ways, whether it's by law, nature, or societal expectations.

Option A is educational institutions. While they are involved in the moral obligations of people, I think his focus is more about the obligations of individuals rather than institutions. I don't remember him specifically addressing educational institutions in the same way as he does with individuals.

Option B is environmental entities. That's about nature and the environment, which isn't the same as what he's studying. His work is more about the obligations of people to act in certain ways, not the entities themselves.

Option C is animals. Again, that's about the moral obligations of living beings, which is a different domain. Sinnott-Armstrong's work seems to concentrate more on human behavior and obligations, not animals.

Option D is governments. That's a possibility, but I think the main focus of his work is on the obligations of individuals rather than the government's role in moral obligations. His work is more about the individuals' duties than the role of the institutions they're part of.

Option E is corporations. Similarly, corporations are businesses, not individuals, and his focus is on the individuals' obligations, not the corporations'.

Option F is families. Families are human groups, but again, his work is about individuals' moral obligations, not the groups themselves.

Option G is religious groups. Similar reasoning applies; he's more concerned with individuals than groups.

Option H is technology companies. The same as above; focus is on individuals, not the entities themselves.

Option I is societies. The moral obligations of societies would involve the collective behavior and the norms that define it, which is a broader topic. I'm not sure if he's the main focus there.

Option J is individuals. This seems like the correct answer because Sinnott-Armstrong's work is centered around the moral obligations of people, not the entities like institutions, companies, etc.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be J: individuals.

The correct answer is J: individuals.
