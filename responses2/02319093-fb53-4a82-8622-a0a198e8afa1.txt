Okay, so I have this question about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think about what I remember from my psychology class.

CBT is a therapeutic approach, right? It's been around for a while, especially since the 70s and 80s. I remember it's all about changing negative thinking and behaviors. The main idea is to identify and challenge negative thoughts, then replace them with more realistic and positive ones.

Looking at the options, the question is asking what the goal is. Let's go through each option:

A: Enhance physical strength. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I don't think CBT focuses on physical abilities; that's more about exercise or strength training. Also, CBT is about behavior, not necessarily physical performance.

B: Reward good behavior. No, that's more about rewards, like praise or points. CBT isn't about rewarding good behavior; it's about correcting bad ones.

C: Develop artistic skills. That's definitely not it. I don't recall CBT being tied to art or drawing.

D: Increase emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is a different construct. While CBT does work on emotions, the question is about a specific goal for CBT. I think the primary goal is about behavior change, not emotional intelligence.

E: Maximize athletic performance. That's more about exercise and training. CBT isn't about physical performance; it's about behavioral changes.

F: Improve memory retention. Again, that's a cognitive function. CBT doesn't directly teach how to remember information; it's more about reorganizing thoughts.

G: Achieve stoic wisdom. Stoicism is about managing emotions, maybe. But CBT is more about behavioral changes, not about being mentally tough in a specific way.

H: Promote spiritual growth. That's a broader goal. CBT's primary focus is on behavioral changes, not spirituality.

I: Build grit. Grit is about perseverance, persistence. CBT isn't about that; it's about behavioral changes to stay motivated.

So, after going through each option, I think the correct answer is E, because CBT works on behavioral changes, not necessarily physical performance. It's about correcting negative thoughts and behaviors to improve overall well-being.
