Okay, so I've got this physics question here about spring scales and sonic motion detectors. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. The question is about what's measured by the slope of a graph where net force is on the y-axis and acceleration on the x-axis.

Wait, I remember from my physics classes that when you plot force vs. acceleration, the slope should give you something important. Oh right, Newton's second law says F = ma, so F is equal to mass times acceleration. But in this case, the axes are F (net) and a (acceleration). So the equation would be rearranged to find m, which is mass.

So the equation would be a = F/m, which can be rewritten as F = m * a. So when you plot F vs. a, the slope is F/m. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. The equation is F = m*a. If you solve for m, it's m = F/a. Wait, no, because F = m*a → m = F/a. So the slope would be F divided by a. Oh wait, no, if the graph is F on y and a on x, then the slope would be (change in F)/(change in a). From F = m*a, for a given mass, changing a would cause a proportional change in F. So the slope would actually be m, the inertial mass. Because F = m*a → m = F/a. So for each a change, F changes by m times that change. So the slope is F over a, but wait, in the graph, the y is F, x is a. So slope is ΔF / Δa. But F is m*a, so ΔF = m * Δa. So when you take ΔF/Δa, it's m. So the slope is the mass. So the slope gives the inertial mass.

Wait, but the options have "Inertial mass" as option A. So the slope is the inertial mass. So the question is asking which quantity is directly measured by the slope.

Looking at the options, D is velocity, E is weight, F is friction. Let me think. The options are A through J, so what's the correct answer.

Wait, I recall that sometimes when you plot F vs. a, the slope is mass. That's because a = F/m. So if you plot F on y and a on x, the slope would be F divided by a, but F = m a, so substituting gives m = F/a. Wait, no, no. Wait, F = m a → a = F/m. So a is dependent on F. So when you plot F (y) vs a (x), the slope is the change in F divided by the change in a. Let me think in terms of actual math. The equation is F = m*a. So if you plot F (y) against a (x), the graph would be a straight line passing through the origin, with slope m. So in this graph, the slope is m, the mass. So the mass is directly measured by the slope.

So among the options, the correct answer must be D: Velocity. Wait, no. The options are the quantities, not the variables. Wait, the question is which quantity is directly measured by the slope.

Wait, the slope is the mass. So looking at the options, which one is mass? Let me check the options again.

Options: A is inertial mass, D is velocity. Wait, the options are labeled A to J. So the question is, which of these quantities is directly measured by the slope.

Wait, the slope is the inertial mass (m), so the correct answer is option A. Because the slope represents m, the inertial mass, which is the quantity being directly measured.

Wait, but wait another thought. The options have other terms, like weight, which is a force. Oh, but the slope is F/m, and F is weight (since weight is the force due to gravity). So weight would be F. But in the graph, the slope is F/m, which is the mass, so F is weight. So wait, in the graph, the y-axis is weight, and the x-axis is acceleration. So the slope is weight divided by acceleration. But acceleration is a. So weight is m a, so m = weight/ a. So the slope in the F vs a graph is m.

So the slope is m, which is inertial mass. So the correct answer is A: Inertial mass.

The question involves determining which quantity is directly measured by the slope of a graph where the net force is plotted on the y-axis and acceleration on the x-axis. The equation of motion is given by Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), where \( F \) is the net force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration. Rearranging this equation gives \( m = \frac{F}{a} \). 

When plotting a graph with \( F \) on the y-axis and \( a \) on the x-axis, the slope is calculated as \( \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta a} \). Substituting \( F = ma \) into this expression shows that the slope is indeed equal to the mass \( m \), which is the inertial mass. 

Among the options provided, the inertial mass is directly measured by the slope of the graph. Therefore, the correct answer is:
