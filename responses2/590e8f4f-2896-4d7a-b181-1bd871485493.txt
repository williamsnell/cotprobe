Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to raise the phasor (8.66 + j5.0) to the second and fifth powers. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Wait, phasors... right, they're complex numbers in polar form, represented as V ∠ θ, where V is the magnitude and θ is the angle in degrees. So first, I should probably convert this complex number into polar form to make raising it to powers easier.

The complex number is 8.66 + j5.0. To find its magnitude, I remember the formula is the square root of (real part squared plus imaginary part squared). So, √(8.66² + 5²) = √(75 +25) = √100 = 10. Oh, that's nice and clean. So the magnitude is 10.

Now, the angle θ. Since it's in the first quadrant (real positive, imaginary positive), the angle is arctangent of (5/8.66). I think 5/8.66 is approximately 0.577. Oh wait, I recall that arctan(1/√3) is 30°, and √3 is approximately 1.732. So 0.577 is 1/√3, so θ is 30 degrees. So the phasor is 10∠30°.

Now, when you raise a phasor to a power, like n, the magnitude becomes (original magnitude)^n, and the angle becomes original angle multiplied by n.

So for the second power (n=2): magnitude is 10^2 = 100. Angle becomes 30° * 2 = 60°. So that's 100∠60°. Converting this to rectangular form if needed, but the options are in polar. So that's 100∠60°, which is 100*cos60° + j100*sin60°. Cos60 is 0.5, and sin60 is about 0.866. So 50 + j86.6. But the options are written in phasor notation, so 100∠60° is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option J says 100∠60° and 100,000∠150°. Let's see what the fifth power would be for the same phasor. So for n=5: magnitude is 10^5 = 100,000. Angle is 30° *5=150°. So 100,000∠150°. So that would be option J's second part.

Wait, but wait, the question says to raise it to the second and fifth powers. So the phasor is first raised to the second power, giving 100∠60°, and then the same phasor (so 8.66+j5.0) is raised to the fifth power, giving 100,000∠150°.

Looking at the options, option J is 100∠60° and 100,000∠150°. So that seems to match. But wait, let me check the options again.

Option J: 100∠60° and 100,000∠150°. So that's correct. But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure that the phasor is correctly raised to the second and fifth powers.

Wait, no—wait, the phasor (8.66 + j5) is the same as 10∠30°. So when you raise it to the second power, the magnitude is 10^2=100, angle 60°, which is 100∠60°, which is option J's first part. When you raise it to the fifth power, magnitude 10^5=100,000, angle 150°, which is option J's second part.

So the answer would be option J.

To solve the problem, we start by converting the phasor \(8.66 + j5.0\) into polar form. The magnitude is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(8.66)^2 + (5.0)^2} = \sqrt{75 + 25} = \sqrt{100} = 10
\]

The angle is:

\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{5.0}{8.66}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = 30^\circ
\]

Thus, the phasor is \(10 \angle 30^\circ\).

Next, we raise this phasor to the second and fifth powers:

1. **Second power (\(n=2\)):**
   - Magnitude: \(10^2 = 100\)
   - Angle: \(30^\circ \times 2 = 60^\circ\)
   - Result: \(100 \angle 60^\circ\)

2. **Fifth power (\(n=5\)):**
   - Magnitude: \(10^5 = 100,000\)
   - Angle: \(30^\circ \times 5 = 150^\circ\)
   - Result: \(100,000 \angle 150^\circ\)

Comparing these results with the options provided, option J matches both parts of the solution: \(100 \angle 60^\circ\) and \(100,000 \angle 150^\circ\).

**ANSWER: J**
