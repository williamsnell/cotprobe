Okay, so I have this quadratic expression: -2x² -20x -53. I need to write it in the form a(x + d)² + e. Hmm, I remember this is about completing the square. Let me think about how to do this step by step.

First, the standard form is a(x - h)² + k, but in this case, it's a(x + d)² + e. So, the sign inside the square matters. Since the original expression is -2x², I can factor that out first. 

Let me write that down: -2x² -20x -53. Factoring out -2 from the first two terms:

-2(x² + 10x) -53. Wait, is that right? Because if I take -2 from -20x, I get 10x, right? So the expression becomes -2(x² + 10x) -53.

Now, I need to complete the square inside the parentheses. The coefficient of x is 10. Half of 10 is 5, and squaring that gives 25. But I don't have 25 inside the parentheses yet. So I need to add and subtract 25 inside the parentheses.

Wait, but since it's multiplied by -2 outside, adding 25 inside will actually subtract twice that amount because of the coefficient. Let me think: if I have -2(x² +10x +25 -25), that's the same as -2[(x² +10x +25) -25]. But since we have to keep the expression equivalent, the -2 should distribute.

Wait, maybe I should handle it step by step. So starting from:

-2(x² +10x) -53.

To complete the square, the expression inside is x² +10x. The square completion requires adding (10/2)² = 25. But since we're adding 25 inside the parentheses, we have to subtract 2*25 outside to keep the value the same. Wait, wait, no. Because the parentheses are multiplied by -2 outside.

Wait, let's clarify. The expression is -2(x² +10x) -53. Adding 25 inside the parentheses is equivalent to adding -2*25 to the whole expression because of the factor of -2. So to balance, I should subtract 2*25.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Let me add and subtract 25 inside, but considering the coefficient.

So, -2(x² +10x +25 -25) -53. This can be rewritten as -2[(x+5)^2 -25] -53. Because x² +10x +25 is (x+5)^2.

Wait, actually, that's correct. So I have:

-2[(x+5)^2 -25] -53.

Now, distribute the -2 across the terms inside the brackets. So:

-2*(x+5)^2 + (-2)*(-25) -53.

Calculating that: -2(x+5)^2 +50 -53.

Simplify the constants: 50 -53 is -3.

So, the expression becomes -2(x+5)^2 -3.

Now, comparing to a(x + d)^2 + e, we can see that a is -2, d is 5, and e is -3.

So the sum a + d + e is (-2) +5 + (-3) = (-2 +5) =3, then 3 + (-3)=0.

Wait, that's zero. Let me double-check.

Another way: The original expression is -2x² -20x -53.

Completing the square:

-2(x² +10x) -53.

x² +10x: half of 10 is 5, square is 25.

So, add and subtract 25 inside the parentheses:

-2[(x² +10x +25) -25] -53.

Which is -2[(x+5)^2 -25] -53.

Multiply out: -2(x+5)^2 + 50 -53.

Which simplifies to -2(x+5)^2 -3.

So a=-2, d=5, e=-3.

Sum: (-2) +5 + (-3) = 0.

So the answer should be option A: 0.

The expression is rewritten by completing the square:

-2x² -20x -53 becomes -2(x + 5)² - 3.

Thus, a = -2, d = 5, e = -3.

The sum a + d + e is (-2) + 5 + (-3) = 0.
