Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cell potential. Hmm, let me think. The reaction given is Ni + Sn²+ → Ni²+ + Sn. I'm a bit rusty on electrochemistry, but I'll try to recall.

Wait, the cell reaction is about oxidation and reduction. I remember that in such reactions, one species is oxidized, and the other is reduced. Let me write down the half-reactions.

The reactants are Ni (metal) and Sn²+ (ions). The products are Ni²+ and Sn (metal). So, maybe Ni is oxidized and Sn²+ is reduced.

Oxidation is loss of electrons. So Ni → Ni²+ would be oxidation because it's losing electrons. But wait, wait. The reaction as written is Ni + Sn²+ → Ni²+ + Sn. So, looking at the metals: Ni goes from 0 to +2, so that's oxidation. Sn²+ goes from +2 to 0, which is reduction. Oh wait, but in the reaction, Sn²+ is on the reactant side and Sn is on the product side. So the Sn²+ is reduced to Sn.

So the oxidation half-reaction is Ni → Ni²+ + 2e⁻. And the reduction half-reaction is Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn.

Wait, but I need to balance these. The number of electrons must be the same in both half-reactions. So that's correct; one electron is lost in the oxidation and one is gained in the reduction.

Now, to find the cell potential, I'll use the standard reduction potentials. I remember that standard reduction potentials are given for the reduction of each species.

Wait, what are the standard reduction potentials for Ni²+ and Sn²+?

Wait, the standard reduction potential for a species is the potential it has when it's reduced to its elemental form. So for Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni(s), the E° is something. Similarly for Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn(s).

I think I remember the approximate values. Let me recall. For example, I know that Sn²+ has a higher reduction potential than Ni²+. So Sn²+ is more likely to be reduced than Ni²+.

Wait, let's get the exact values from memory. I remember that the standard reduction potential for Sn²+ is around +0.137 V, and for Ni²+ it's about +0.152 V? Or wait, maybe I got them mixed up.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. I think the correct standard reduction potentials are:

Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn(s): E° = 0.13 V (about 0.130 V)
Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni(s): E° = 0.152 V (Wait, but wait a second, no. I think I might have gotten that wrong. Because actually, I think Ni has a higher reduction potential than Sn. Let me think again.)

Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the values. Let me think. The more positive the E°, the higher the tendency to be reduced. So Sn²+ has a higher E° than Ni²+?

Wait, but I think the actual values are:

Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn(s) has E° of about 0.130 V.

Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni(s) has E° of about 0.152 V. Wait, that can't be, because 0.152 is higher than 0.130, which would mean Ni²+ is a better oxidizing agent. But earlier I thought that Sn²+ is more likely to be reduced, but maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, no. Because the actual data I have in my notes (like in textbooks) says:

E°(Sn²+/Sn) = 0.13 V

E°(Ni²+/Ni) = 0.152 V.

Wait, no, wait, that can't be right because 0.152 is higher than 0.13. So Ni²+ has a higher E° for reduction than Sn²+.

But wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because if Ni²+ has a higher E°, it's a stronger oxidizing agent. So in the cell, the species with higher E° will be reduced, and the other will be oxidized.

So, in our cell, the two species are Ni and Sn²+. So for the reaction, the one with the higher E° will be the one being reduced. Since Ni²+ has a higher E°, it will be the reduced species. So our reaction is correct as before.

So the cell reaction is oxidation of Ni to Ni²+ and reduction of Sn²+ to Sn.

So the cell potential (E°cell) is E°cathode - E°anode.

Wait, the cathode is the reduction (where reduction happens), the anode is oxidation (so the reverse of the reduction).

So the cathode is the Sn²+ → Sn reaction, which has E°cathode = 0.13 V.

The anode is the Ni → Ni²+ reaction, which is oxidation. So the E° for anode is the opposite of its reduction potential. Because the anode is undergoing oxidation, its potential is the reverse of the reduction.

Wait, no, in terms of cell potential calculation, the formula is E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode, but wait, no, more accurately, the E°cell is E°cathode minus E°anode, but E°anode is for the anode's reduction potential, so since the anode is acting as anode (oxidation), we have to subtract its E° (as a reduction potential) from the cathode's.

Wait, better to think in terms of the two half-reactions and their E°.

So, the overall cell reaction is:

Ni(s) + Sn²+(aq) → Ni²+(aq) + Sn(s)

Which can be written as:

Reduction (cathode): Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn(s), E°cathode = 0.13 V

Oxidation (anode): Ni → Ni²+ + 2e⁻, E°anode = -0.152 V (because it's the reverse of the reduction, so its E° is negative when considering the anode as a reduction potential).

Wait, but wait, the standard formula for cell potential is E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode, where E°anode is the E° for the anode's reduction potential.

So E°cell = 0.13 - (0.152) = 0.13 - 0.152 = -0.02 V.

Wait, that can't be right because that would mean a negative cell potential, which would imply the reaction is not spontaneous. But the question says to find the cell potential and predict the direction of the reaction—so I need to calculate the E°cell, and then determine if it's spontaneous (positive, so E°cell positive).

Wait, but wait: let me recalculate.

Wait, I'm getting E°cell = 0.13 V (cathode) - 0.152 V (anode's E°, but since the anode is undergoing oxidation, its E° is subtracted as is. So 0.13 - 0.152 = -0.02 V.

Negative cell potential. So the reaction is not spontaneous as written. But wait, the cell potential being negative means the reaction would not proceed as written. So the spontaneous direction would be the reverse: Sn²+ is reduced and Ni is oxidized.

Wait, but wait, the alternative reaction is when E°cell is positive. So if E°cell is negative, the cell reaction is non-spontaneous in the forward direction.

So the question is asking for the cell potential and the direction of the spontaneous reaction.

Wait, but first, let me recheck the E° values. Because I might have confused them. Let me look up the standard reduction potentials.

Wait, I remember that Sn²+ + 2e⁻ → Sn has E° = 0.13 V. And Ni²+ + 2e⁻ → Ni is about 0.152 V. Wait, that can't be. Because 0.152 is higher than 0.13, so Ni²+ is a better oxidizing agent than Sn²+.

So in the cell, the higher E° species (Ni²+) is the one being reduced, and the lower E° species (Sn²+) is the one being oxidized.

So the cell reaction proceeds as written, but the E°cell is 0.13 - 0.152 = -0.02 V. So the cell potential is negative, which means the reaction as written is non-spontaneous. So the reverse would be spontaneous.

Wait, but wait, the cell potential is negative, which means the cell doesn't proceed as written. So the reaction as written is not spontaneous under standard conditions, and the reverse would be spontaneous.

But wait, the question is about the cell potential and the direction of the spontaneous reaction. So the cell potential is -0.02 V, which is answer F or G or so. Looking at the options, F is -0.01, G is -0.02. So in my calculation, I get -0.02 V, which would be option G.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the E° values because maybe I mixed up the numbers. Another source says that the standard reduction potential for Sn²+ is approximately +0.13 V, and for Ni²+ is +0.152 V. Wait, that can't be. Because that would mean Sn²+ is a better oxidizing agent than Ni²+.

Wait, but I'm probably mixing up the E° values in the problem. Let me think: perhaps the correct E° values are:

E°(Sn²+/Sn) = +0.13 V

E°(Ni²+/Ni) = +0.152 V

Wait, that would mean that Ni²+ is a better oxidizing agent, so it should be reduced. So the cell reaction is correct, and the E°cell is E°cathode - E°anode = 0.13 - 0.152 = -0.02 V. So the cell potential is -0.02 V, which would correspond to answer choice G (since F is -0.01 and G is -0.02).

But wait, another way to think: the cell reaction is written as:

Ni(s) + Sn²+ → Ni²+ + Sn(s)

Which is oxidation of Ni and reduction of Sn²+.

In terms of E°cell, the formula is E°cathode (reduction) minus E°anode (oxidation, which is the reverse of its reduction). So since the anode is undergoing oxidation, its E° for the anode is subtracted. But wait, the E°anode as written in the cell is the E° for the reduction, so when the anode is acting as anode (oxidation), the E° for the anode is subtracted.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E°cell = E°cathode (reduction) - E°anode (reduction), but for the anode, since it is oxidized, the E° is subtracted. So in that case, E°cell = 0.13 V (Sn²+ reduction) - 0.152 V (Ni²+ reduction) = -0.02 V.

So the cell potential is negative, so the reaction as written is not spontaneous. The spontaneous direction would be the reverse reaction: Sn²+ + Ni → Sn + Ni²+.

Wait, but the problem also asks for the direction of the spontaneous reaction. So the spontaneous reaction is the opposite of the written cell reaction.

But wait, the question is: 'find the cell potential for the cell whose reaction equation is... and predict the direction of the spontaneous reaction.'

So when the cell potential is negative, the reaction as written is not spontaneous. So the spontaneous reaction is the reverse.

But wait, the reaction as written is the one that produces electrons (spontaneous). So the reverse reaction would be non-spontaneous, but the spontaneous direction is the reverse.

Wait, no. The spontaneous reaction is the one where the cell potential is positive. So if E°cell is negative, the reaction as written is non-spontaneous, so the reverse is spontaneous.

So in this case, the reaction as written is not spontaneous. So the spontaneous reaction is the reverse: Sn²+ + Ni → Sn + Ni²+.

But the cell potential is negative, so the cell can't spontaneously proceed as written. So the cell potential is negative, and the spontaneous direction is the reverse.

But the question is about the cell potential (so the value) and the direction of the spontaneous reaction.

So according to the calculation, E°cell is -0.02 V, which is option G.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option G is -0.02 volts. So the correct answer would be G.
</think>

To determine the cell potential and the direction of the spontaneous reaction for the given reaction equation, **Ni + Sn²+ → Ni²+ + Sn**, we analyze the half-reactions and standard reduction potentials.

### Step 1: Identify the Half-Reactions
- **Reduction (Cathode):** Sn²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Sn(s), with E°(Sn²+/Sn) = +0.13 V (standard reduction potential).
- **Oxidation (Anode):** Ni → Ni²⁺ + 2e⁻, which is the reverse of the reduction reaction for Ni²⁺. The E° for the oxidation (reverse of reduction) is -0.152 V.

### Step 2: Calculate the Cell Potential
The cell potential is given by:
\[
E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = 0.13 \, \text{V} - 0.152 \, \text{V} = -0.02 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the Cell Potential
A negative cell potential (-0.02 V) indicates that the reaction as written is non-spontaneous under standard conditions. The spontaneous direction is the reverse of the reaction.

### Step 4: Match with the Options
The calculated cell potential is **-0.02 V**, which corresponds to **option G**.

### Final Answer:
The cell potential is **-0.02 volts**, and the spontaneous reaction direction is the reverse of the given reaction.
