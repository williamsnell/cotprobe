Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the minimum of the function f(x, y) = 2x -5y, subject to the constraint x² + y² = 144. Hmm, that sounds like a Lagrange multipliers problem, or maybe I can use some geometric approach since the constraint is a circle.

Wait, the constraint is a circle centered at the origin with radius 12 because 144 is 12 squared. So the points (x, y) lie on this circle. The function f(x, y) is a linear function, so it represents a family of lines. I need to find where this function is minimized on the circle.

I remember that the extrema of a linear function on a circle occur where the gradient of the function is parallel to the gradient of the constraint. Alternatively, using the method of Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of f and the constraint should be proportional.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian L is f(x, y) minus lambda times the constraint. So,

L = 2x -5y - λ(x² + y² - 144)

To find the extrema, take the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and λ, and set them to zero.

Partial derivative with respect to x:
dL/dx = 2 - 2λx = 0 → 2 = 2λx → λx =1 → x = 1/λ.

Partial derivative with respect to y:
dL/dy = -5 - 2λy = 0 → -5 = 2λy → y = -5/(2λ).

Partial derivative with respect to λ:
dL/dλ = -(x² + y² -144) = 0 → x² + y² =144 (which is our original constraint, so it's redundant here).

Now, from the first two equations, we can find x and y in terms of λ. Let's see, x =1/λ and y = -5/(2λ). 

Since x and y are related to λ, substitute these into the constraint equation:

x² + y² = (1/λ)² + [ (-5/(2λ)) ]² = 144

Compute that: (1)/(λ²) + (25)/(4λ²) = 144.

Combine the terms: [4 +25]/(4λ²) =144 → 29/(4λ²) =144 → 4λ² =29/144 → λ² =29/(4*144) → λ² =29/(576) → λ = ±√(29/576) → λ = ± (√29)/24.

So now, λ is either positive or negative. Let's take λ positive first: λ = √29/24.

Then, x = 1/λ = 24/√29.

Similarly, y = -5/(2λ) = -5/(2*(√29/24)) )= -5/( (2√29)/24 )= -5*(24)/(2√29) )= -5*12/√29 = -60/√29.

Wait, wait, let me recheck that calculation for y. 

Wait, y= -5/(2λ), and λ is √29/24. So substituting, 2λ is 2*(√29/24) = √29/12. So y = -5/(√29/12) = -5*12/√29 = -60/√29.

Alternatively, I can rationalize the denominator, but perhaps it's not necessary right now.

So, x =24/√29, y= -60/√29.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check the signs. Wait, no, because when we considered the partial derivatives, x is 1/λ, which is positive if λ is positive. Similarly, y was -5/(2λ), which would be negative if λ is positive.

Alternatively, if λ is negative, then x would be 1/λ, which would be negative, and y would be -5/(2λ), which would be positive if λ is negative. Let's see both possibilities.

Wait, but the function f(x, y) =2x -5y. So, let's evaluate f for both possible (x, y) combinations.

Case 1: x=24/√29, y= -60/√29.

f = 2*(24/√29) -5*(-60/√29) = (48 +300)/√29 = 348/√29.

Case 2: x= -24/√29, y= 60/√29.

f = 2*(-24/√29) -5*(60/√29) = (-48 -300)/√29 = -348/√29.

Which is smaller? Well, negative 348 over something positive is negative, so it's less than zero. So the minimum is case 2.

Wait, but let me compute 348/√29. What is √29 approximately? Around 5.385. So 348 /5.385 ≈ 348 ÷5.385 ≈ 64.86. So 348/√29≈64.86, so case 1 gives f≈64.86, case 2 gives f≈-64.86.

Wait, but wait, no, because 348 divided by 5.385 is approx 64.86. So case 1 is positive, case 2 is negative, so the minimum is -64.86.

But wait, the options given are integers. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute √29: 5.385164807134504.

So 348 divided by 5.385 is approximately 348/5.385 ≈ 64.86. So 348/√29 ≈ 64.86, so 348/√29 is about 64.86, so case 1 is positive, case 2 is negative 64.86.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A:50

B: -64.62

C:144

D:200

E:0

F:-72

G:72

H:-50

I:-200

J:-144

So -64.62 is an option, B.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the gradient approach. Let's try that.

The gradient of f is (2, -5). The gradient of the constraint function g(x,y) =x² + y² -144 is (2x, 2y). For the gradients to be parallel, we have 2 = λ*(2x) and -5 = λ*(2y).

So 2 = 2λ x → λ x =1 → x =1/λ.

Similarly, -5 = 2λ y → y = -5/(2λ).

Substitute into the constraint: x² + y² = (1/λ)^2 + (25)/(4λ^2) = (4 +25)/(4λ²) )=29/(4λ²) = 144.

So 29/(4λ²) =144 → 4λ²=29/144 → λ²=29/(576) → λ= ±√29/24.

So λ is either positive or negative. Let's take λ positive first.

So λ=√29/24.

Then x=1/λ=24/√29.

y= -5/(2λ)= -5/(2*(√29/24)) )= -5*(24)/(2√29)= -60/√29.

So f(x,y)=2x -5y= 2*(24/√29) -5*(-60/√29)=48/√29 + 300/√29=348/√29.

Which is about 348/5.385≈64.86.

Case when λ is negative, λ=-√29/24.

Then x=1/λ= -24/√29.

y= -5/(2λ)= -5/(2*(-√29/24) )= -5*(-24/(2√29)) )= 60/(2√29)=30/√29.

Wait no, wait:

Wait, let's compute y correctly.

Wait, y= -5/(2λ).

If λ is negative, let's say λ=-√29/24.

So y= -5/(2*(-√29/24)) )= -5/( (-2√29)/24 )= -5 * (24)/( -2√29 )= -5 * (-12)/(√29 )= 60/√29.

Wait, that can't be right because if λ is negative, 2λ is negative. Wait, let me recompute.

Wait, if λ is negative, then 2λ is negative. So y= -5/(2λ) = -5/(2λ). Since λ is negative, 2λ is negative, so -5 divided by negative is positive.

So y would be positive in that case. Let me re-examine:

If λ is negative, then λ = -√29/24.

So 2λ = -2√29/24 = -√29/12.

So y= -5/(2λ) = -5/( (-√29/12) )= -5 * ( -12/√29 )= 60/√29.

So y=60/√29.

So now, f(x, y) =2x -5y.

x= -24/√29, y=60/√29.

So f= 2*(-24/√29) -5*(60/√29) = (-48 -300)/√29 = -348/√29.

Which is approximately -64.86.

So the function f can take two values: approx +64.86 and -64.86.

Which is the minimum? The negative one. So the minimum is approximately -64.86.

Looking at the options, B is -64.62, which is close but not exact. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute 348/√29 more accurately.

√29 is approximately 5.385164807.

So 348 divided by 5.385164807.

Let me compute 5.385164807 * 64 = 5.385164807 *60=323.11, 5.385164807*4=21.540659228 → total 323.11+21.54≈344.65.

5.385164807 *64.86 = Let's see. 64.86 *5=324.3, 0.385164807 *64.86≈24.86. So total approx 324.3+24.86=349.16. Hmm, our numerator is 348, which is a bit less than 64.86, so 64.86 is an overestimate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 348 ÷5.385164807.

Let me compute 5.385164807 *64=344.65, as before.

348-344.65=3.35.

So 3.35/5.385164807 ≈ 0.62.

So the total is approximately 64.62.

Wait, wait, 64 + 0.62=64.62.

So 348/5.385164807 ≈64.62. So f= -348/√29≈-64.62.

Ah, so the minimum is approximately -64.62, which matches option B.

To find the minimum of \( f(x, y) = 2x - 5y \) subject to the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 144 \), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is:

\[
L = 2x - 5y - \lambda(x^2 + y^2 - 144)
\]

Taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero:

1. \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 2 - 2\lambda x = 0 \) ⟹ \( \lambda x = 1 \) ⟹ \( x = \frac{1}{\lambda} \)
2. \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = -5 - 2\lambda y = 0 \) ⟹ \( \lambda y = -\frac{5}{2} \) ⟹ \( y = -\frac{5}{2\lambda} \)
3. \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = -(x^2 + y^2 - 144) = 0 \) ⟹ \( x^2 + y^2 = 144 \)

Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\lambda} \) and \( y = -\frac{5}{2\lambda} \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = 144 \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{5}{2\lambda}\right)^2 = 144
\]

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda^2} + \frac{25}{4\lambda^2} = 144
\]

\[
\frac{4 + 25}{4\lambda^2} = 144 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{29}{4\lambda^2} = 144
\]

\[
4\lambda^2 = \frac{29}{144} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda^2 = \frac{29}{576} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \pm \frac{\sqrt{29}}{24}
\]

For \( \lambda = \frac{\sqrt{29}}{24} \):

\[
x = \frac{24}{\sqrt{29}}, \quad y = -\frac{60}{\sqrt{29}}
\]

\[
f(x, y) = 2x - 5y = \frac{48}{\sqrt{29}} + \frac{300}{\sqrt{29}} = \frac{348}{\sqrt{29}} \approx 64.86
\]

For \( \lambda = -\frac{\sqrt{29}}{24} \):

\[
x = -\frac{24}{\sqrt{29}}, \quad y = \frac{60}{\sqrt{29}}
\]

\[
f(x, y) = 2x - 5y = -\frac{48}{\sqrt{29}} - \frac{300}{\sqrt{29}} = -\frac{348}{\sqrt{29}} \approx -64.86
\]

The minimum value is approximately \(-64.86\), which is closest to option **B: -64.62**.
