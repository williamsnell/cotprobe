Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem to solve. Let me read through it again. The question is about calculating the change in entropy when a sample of nitrogen gas undergoes a reversible adiabatic expansion. The gas starts at a certain state and ends at another, and I need to find the entropy change.

Hmm, right, entropy change for a process depends on the type of process. Oh wait, the problem says it's a reversible adiabatic expansion. Adiabatic means no heat exchange with the surroundings, so Q=0. And for a perfect gas, there are some equations I can use.

Wait, entropy change for an ideal gas can be calculated using ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1) + nR ln(V2/V1) or something like that. Or alternatively, using S = S(T) + S(V) for an ideal gas, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Another formula I remember is ΔS = Q_rev / T. Since it's adiabatic, Q_rev is zero, so does that mean ΔS is zero? Oh wait, wait. Because in an adiabatic process, Q is zero, so the change in entropy would be zero only if the process is reversible and the gas is ideal. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, for an ideal gas, the entropy change can be expressed as ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCv ln(T2/T1) or another form. Alternatively, using the equation for entropy change in terms of temperature and volume.

Wait, when a gas undergoes a reversible process, the entropy change can be calculated using ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). Also, since it's a perfect gas, we can use the ideal gas law. But what about the process being adiabatic? Oh, right, because Q=0, the first law of thermodynamics says ΔU = Q + W. But since Q=0, ΔU = W. But for entropy, in a reversible adiabatic process, the change in entropy is zero because dS = (δQ_rev)/T and δQ_rev is zero. So that would imply that the total entropy change is zero. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the gas is expanding. If the process is adiabatic, but the gas is expanding, the temperature must be dropping, so perhaps there's a change in entropy.

Wait, let me clarify. For a reversible adiabatic process of an ideal gas, the change in entropy is zero because the entropy change is given by ΔS = (Q_rev)/T, and since Q_rev is zero, ΔS is zero. Because the process is reversible, the system and surroundings exchange infinitesimal amounts of heat, but the total entropy change remains zero. So the entropy of the gas doesn't change during this process.

But wait, the question says the volume doubles. So as the gas expands, its volume increases, which for an ideal gas, if temperature drops, the entropy change would come from the temperature and volume terms.

Wait, but if the process is adiabatic and reversible, then yes, the change in entropy is zero. Because for a reversible adiabatic (isentropic) process, ΔS = 0.

But wait, is that always the case? Or is it for specific types of processes. Oh, right, for any isentropic process (adiabatic and reversible), the entropy change is zero. So in this case, the entropy change is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Let me consider the general formula for entropy change when a gas undergoes a process. The entropy change of an ideal gas is given by ΔS = n [ Cv ln(T2/T1) + R ln(V2/V1) ].

For an adiabatic process, Q = 0. The first law says ΔU = Q + W, but W is the work done on the system, so for expansion, W is positive if work is done by the system. Wait, but in an adiabatic process, W = -ΔU, so if the gas expands, ΔU is negative, but W is also negative (since work done by the system is positive W).

But how does this affect the entropy change? Since the process is reversible, the entropy change is determined by the formula I mentioned earlier. And because the process is isentropic, the entropy change is zero.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: for the entropy change, in a process, it's given by:

ΔS = n [ Cv ln(T2/T1) + R ln(V2/V1) ]

But in a reversible adiabatic process, does this expression hold? Because for an adiabatic process, W = -ΔU. So for an ideal gas, the work done is W = n Cv (T2 - T1)/(1-γ) for a reversible adiabatic process.

But since ΔU is n Cv (T2 - T1), and W = -ΔU, that's consistent.

But in terms of entropy, since the process is reversible, the entropy change is zero.

Wait, but the process is adiabatic but not necessarily isothermal. So the temperature changes, even though no heat is exchanged. So the entropy change would be the sum of the two terms.

Wait, but in the case of a reversible adiabatic process, the entropy doesn't change, so ΔS=0.

But wait, the question is about the entropy change when the gas doubles its volume in such a process. So the total change is zero.

So the answer should be zero, but wait, looking at the options, option F is zero.

Wait, but wait another thought. Oh, wait, the initial state is 14g of nitrogen at 298 K and 1 bar. The volume doubles, so the process is expansion. But for an adiabatic reversible process, the system's entropy doesn't change. So the entropy change is zero.

Wait, but wait, another point: for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible adiabatic expansion, the entropy change is zero. Because the process is isentropic.

So the correct answer would be zero, which is option F.

But wait, am I missing something? Because sometimes for a process where the system is expanding, but the environment is doing work, the entropy of the system changes. But since the process is adiabatic, the system can't exchange heat, so the entropy change is zero.

So the change in entropy is zero, so the answer is F.

Wait, but another way to think: the entropy change of the gas is zero because it's a reversible process. So the correct answer would be F.

Looking at the options: F is 0.

So why would the question say "doubles its volume in an adiabatic reversible expansion"?

Wait, if the process is isentropic, the entropy doesn't change. So the change in entropy is zero. So the answer is F.

Wait, but wait a moment. Wait, another thought: entropy is a state function. So the change in entropy depends only on the initial and final states, not the path taken. So regardless of the process, as long as the initial and final states are the same, the change in entropy is the same.

So in this case, the initial state is fixed (mass, volume, etc.), and the final state is the same (same mass, same volume). So the change in entropy is zero. So the correct option is F.

Wait, but wait, what if the process is adiabatic and reversible, but not isentropic? No, no, that's not possible. An adiabatic reversible process is isentropic.

So, the correct answer is F, 0.

To determine the total change in entropy for a sample of nitrogen gas undergoing a reversible adiabatic expansion, we analyze the process as follows:

1. **Key Concepts**:  
   - For an ideal gas, the entropy change is given by:  
     \[
     \Delta S = n \left[ C_v \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) + R \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) \right]
     \]  
   - In a reversible adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged (\(Q = 0\)), so the first law of thermodynamics (\(\Delta U = Q + W\)) implies that the work done (\(W\)) is equal to the change in internal energy (\(\Delta U\)).  
   - For an ideal gas, the entropy change in a reversible adiabatic process is zero (\(\Delta S = 0\)) because the system's entropy remains constant.

2. **Application to the Problem**:  
   - The gas undergoes a reversible adiabatic expansion, doubling its volume.  
   - Since the process is adiabatic, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, and the total entropy change is zero (\(\Delta S = 0\)).  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   - The entropy change for the gas during this process is zero because the process is isentropic (reversible and adiabatic).  
   - Therefore, the correct answer is **F: 0 J/K**.
