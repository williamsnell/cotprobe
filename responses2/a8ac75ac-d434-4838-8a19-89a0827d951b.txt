The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Consider the ABO blood group locus in humans, which has six (6) alleles reported for it, of which three are most prominent, I^A, I^B andi. The I^A and I^B alleles are both dominant toiandcodominantto each other. A woman of blood group O marries a man who has blood group B. There are four children in the family: a son and daughter of blood group O; a daughter who has A blood type; and a son who has B blood type. One of the children is adopted. Which child is the adopted child?

Options:

A: the daughter of blood group O
B: The son with A blood type
C: the son of blood group O
D: the daughter who has blood group A
E: None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred
F: The daughter with AB blood type
G: the son who has B blood type
H: The son with AB blood type
I: The daughter with B blood type
J: The child with a rare blood type not listed

Okay, so I've got this genetics question about the ABO blood group locus. Hmm, I need to figure out which child was adopted. Let me read through the question again.

So the question says that the woman has blood group O, which I think means she has the genotype ii. Her husband has blood group B, so his genotype must be I^A I^B because B is the dominant allele. 

Now, their kids have some specific blood types: two children are O (one son and one daughter), one has A, another has B. Wait, but wait—two O's in the children, one A, one B. Oh, but there are four children, including an adopted one. So, maybe the children are the ones, and the adopted child is the other one?

Wait, wait, the setup says there are four children: two O, one A, one B. Oh, wait, that can't be right because 2 +1 +1 =4. Wait, but the wording says "four children: a son and daughter of blood group O; a daughter who has A blood type; and a son who has B blood type." So that's 2 O, 1 A, 1 B. Then there's a fourth child, possibly an adoptive child. So one of the four is adopted, meaning three are children and one is the adopted. Or wait, maybe the four are the children, including the adopted, but the question is which is the adopted. So the question is asking which child is adopted, but in the options, the adopted could be a child of a certain type.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the possible blood types of the children. The kids are O, O, A, B. So the possible blood types are O, A, B. But according to the question, the family has two O children, one A, one B. So total four children: two O, one A, one B.

Wait, but then why is one of the children an adopted one? The question says four children: a son and daughter O; daughter A; son B. So that's two O, one A, one B. So the fourth child must be an adoptive one. So the adopted child would have a type not present in the four described. Wait, but the question is about the adopted child's blood type.

Wait, but the question says "Which child is the adopted child?" So, the four children are two O's, one A, one B. But the question is about which child is adopted. So in this case, the only one left is the fourth, which is the adopted one. So the adopted child would be of a type not present in the other three. But wait, the other three are O, A, B.

So the fourth child is the adopted one. So what's their blood type? Let's think about the parents' genotypes. The woman is O (so ii), the man is B (I^A I^B). So possible combinations.

The woman is ii (so both alleles are i). The man is I^A I^B.

So possible children:

Each child gets one allele from each parent. So for the mother, each child has an i from her (since she is ii). For the father, each child gets either I^A or I^B.

So the children's blood types are O (ii + I^A) is O (since ii is O, and I^A is dominant, but O is O, so I^A doesn't show), wait no. Wait, blood group is determined by the ABO system.

Wait, the ABO system works as follows: ii is O, I^A is A, I^B is B, and I^A I^B is AB.

So when the mother is ii (O), the father is I^A I^B (B). So the possible gametes from the mother are O (since she can't contribute any A or B; she's ii). The gametes from the father can be I^A or I^B.

So each child gets I^A or I^B from the father, and O from the mother.

So the blood types are:

If child has I^A: A (A).

If child has I^B: B (B).

If child has I^AB: AB (AB).

So the possible children are O, A, B, AB.

In the family, the four children are two O, one A, one B. Wait, but that's three children—wait no, wait: the two O's are from the mother, the A is the A child, and the B is the B child. So that's three children. So the fourth child must be the adopted one. So the fourth child's genotype is i I^A (O), i I^B (B), or i I^AB (AB). So their blood types would be O, B, or AB.

But wait, the question says the father is B (I^A I^B), so the children's blood types are A, B, AB, or O.

Wait, all children must have either A, B, or AB? Because the mother is ii (O), and father is I^A I^B.

So the children would be O (O from mother, I^A or I^B from father), A (I^A), B (I^B), or AB (I^A and I^B).

So in the family, four children: two O, one A, one B. So the fourth child must be AB (because the other two possibilities are O and B). So the only child not in the four is AB.

Wait, so the fourth child is AB. So the adopted child is the one with AB blood type. So looking at the options, the adopted child is the one who is the fourth, which would be the one with AB.

Looking at the options:

E is "None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred"

Wait, but the question is asking which child is adopted. So the fourth child is the adopted one. But the options don't have an 'unknown' option, but E is "None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred." Because the question says four children: O, O, A, B. So the fourth is the adopted one. So the answer would be E, since the four children are O, O, A, B. The fourth is the adopted one, so E says none are adopted, which would mean the correct answer is E: the adopted child is the one with AB, but the question is asking which child is the adopted one. But wait, the question is asking which child is the adopted. Wait the question says, "Which child is the adopted child?" So the four children include the adopted one, so the adopted child is the one with AB. So the answer would be E, because the other three are O, A, B, the fourth is the adopted.

Wait, but the options are A to J. Let me look again.

Options:

A: the daughter of O.

B: son with A.

C: son O.

D: daughter A.

E: None of the children are adopted; mutation occurred.

Wait, the family has four children: two O, one A, one B. So the fourth is the adopted. So E says none are adopted, which would be incorrect. So the correct answer is E because the adopted is the fourth child, which is AB. So E is the correct choice.

Alternatively, the question might be worded as, "which is the adopted child?" So the four are the children, and the adopted is one of them. The fourth is the adopted. But the question is about the adopted child, which would be the one with AB blood type. So the correct answer is E because none are adopted, but the fourth is the one with AB. But the question is asking which child is the adopted. But the four children are: O, O, A, B. So the fourth is the adopted. But the options don't have another option for the fourth child. The options are A to J, with E being none are adopted, and the others are specific types.

Wait, looking at the options, E is "None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred." So, the family has four children, including one who is the adopted. So the adopted is the fourth child, which is of AB type. So the correct answer is E, because the adopted is the fourth child, who is AB.

Wait, but the options are about which child is the adopted. So the question is: Which child is the adopted? So the adopted is the fourth, which is the one with AB, so the correct answer is E.

The question involves determining which child is adopted based on the blood group genotypes of the family members. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Parents' Genotypes**:  
   - The woman is blood type O (ii), meaning she cannot contribute A or B alleles.  
   - The man is blood type B (I^A I^B), meaning he can contribute I^A or I^B alleles.  

2. **Possible Children**:  
   - Each child inherits one allele from the mother (O) and one from the father (I^A or I^B).  
   - Possible blood types: O (if I^A is dominant), A (I^A), B (I^B), or AB (I^A and I^B).  

3. **Given Children**:  
   - Two children are O (one from each parent, as the mother is O and the father contributes I^A or I^B).  
   - One child has blood type A (I^A).  
   - One child has blood type B (I^B).  

4. **Fourth Child**:  
   - The fourth child must have blood type AB (I^A and I^B) since the other possible blood types (O, A, B) are already accounted for by the given children.  

5. ** adopted Child**:  
   - The question specifies that one of the four children is adopted. The fourth child, with blood type AB, is the adopted child.  

6. **Answer Analysis**:  
   - The options provided include E, which states, "None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred." However, since the fourth child is indeed adopted (of blood type AB), none of the children are adopted. Therefore, option E is correct because it correctly identifies that no children are adopted, and the mutation occurred.  

ANSWER: E
