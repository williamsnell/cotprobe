Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out if the argument is valid using indirect truth tables. Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The argument given is:

1. E ⊃ (F ∨ ~G)
2. F ⊃ (~E ∨ ~G)
3. ~(E ≡ F)

And the question is whether this argument is valid. If it's invalid, I need to find a counterexample from the options A to G.

First, I should probably write down the premises and the conclusion. Wait, actually, in this case, the conclusion isn't explicitly stated. The premises are the three statements, and the conclusion would be the negation of the third premise, right? Or wait, maybe the argument is structured in such a way that the conclusion is the negation of the assumption. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Looking at the premises, the third one is ~(E ≡ F), which is equivalent to saying that E and F are not equivalent. So the premises are the first two implications and that E and F are not equivalent. The argument is probably trying to derive that, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is to show that the premises lead to a contradiction, implying the argument is invalid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The structure of the argument is: premises 1 and 2, and premise 3, and the conclusion would be the negation of premise 3. Or maybe the conclusion is a tautology that can be derived from the premises, which would imply the argument is valid.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is whether the argument is valid, so I need to see if the premises necessarily lead to the conclusion. If I can find a scenario where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

So, to approach this, I'll try to construct a truth table for the premises and see if there's any case where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Alternatively, perhaps the premises lead to a contradiction, which would make the argument invalid.

Wait, the third premise is ~(E ≡ F), which is the same as saying E and F are not both true or both false. So E and F can't be equivalent. So either E is true and F is false, or E is false and F is true.

Let me list the possible truth values for E, F, and G and see if I can find a scenario where premises 1 and 2 are true, and the conclusion is false. Wait, actually, the conclusion isn't given as a premise here. Or wait, perhaps the conclusion is derived from the premises.

Wait, maybe I should parse the argument correctly. The premises are:

1. E → (F ∨ ~G)
2. F → (~E ∨ ~G)
3. ~(E ≡ F)

And the conclusion (if it's a syllogism) would be E → ~G or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the argument is to show that the premises entail the conclusion, which is the negation of the third premise.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is to show that the premises lead to the conclusion that E and F are not equivalent, but that's already given as premise 3. So, I'm a bit confused. Maybe the argument is structured as:

Premise 1: E → (F ∨ ~G)
Premise 2: F → (~E ∨ ~G)
Premise 3: ~(E ≡ F)
Conclusion: ?

Wait, no. Wait, maybe the argument is that the premises (1 and 2) along with premise 3 lead to a conclusion. But in the problem statement, the user didn't provide the conclusion. Hmm, that's odd. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, and perhaps the original problem is to determine whether the premises are consistent, which would imply the argument is valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is to determine if the premises are sufficient to derive the conclusion, which is the negation of premise 3.

Wait, maybe the argument is: the premises are E → (F ∨ ~G), F → (~E ∨ ~G), and ~(E ≡ F), and we need to determine if this leads to a contradiction. If it does, then the argument is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it differently. Let's see if we can find a scenario where all three premises are true, but the conclusion is false. But wait, the conclusion isn't given, so maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, wait, perhaps the argument is to show that the premises lead to an impossible situation, making the argument invalid. So, if I can find a scenario where premises 1, 2, and 3 are all true, but the conclusion is also true, then the argument would be valid. But if I can find a scenario where premises are true, but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

Wait, I think I'm getting myself stuck. Perhaps I should proceed step by step. Let's assume that the conclusion is ~ (E ≡ F) (i.e., the third premise) and that the argument is to show whether it's valid. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is to show that the premises entail the conclusion that E and F are not equivalent, but that's already given.

Wait, maybe the problem is to determine whether the premises are consistent. If the premises are consistent, the argument is valid. So, let's construct the truth table.

The premises are:

1. E → (F ∨ ~G)
2. F → (~E ∨ ~G)
3. ~(E ≡ F)

Let me write down all possible truth values for E, F, G. Since there are three variables, there are 8 possible cases.

But perhaps I should find a case where premises 1 and 2 are true, and premise 3 is also true. Wait, no, because the third premise is ~(E ≡ F), which is the same as (E ∧ F) → False. So, it's equivalent to saying that E and F cannot be both true or both false. So, either E is true and F is false, or E is false and F is true.

So, let me approach this by considering the possibilities.

Case 1: E is true, F is false.

Since E is true, premise 1 becomes E → (F ∨ ~G). Since E is true, F ∨ ~G must be true. F is false, so for F ∨ ~G to be true, ~G must be true. So, G is false.

Now, look at premise 2: F → (~E ∨ ~G). F is false, so the implication is automatically true, regardless of the right side.

So, in this case:

E = T, F = F, G = F.

Now, let's check premise 3: ~(E ≡ F).

E is T, F is F. So E ≡ F is equivalent to (E ∧ F) or (~E ∧ ~F). In this case, E is T and F is F, so E ≡ F is false. Thus, ~ (E ≡ F) is true. So, premise 3 is true.

So, in this case, all three premises are true. So, the argument would be valid because the premises are consistent.

Wait, but the question is to determine if the argument is valid. So, if all premises can be true at the same time, the argument is valid. But if there's a case where the premises are all true and the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

But wait, the conclusion isn't given. Maybe the conclusion is the negation of premise 3, which is E ≡ F. Wait, no, premise 3 is ~(E ≡ F), so the negation would be E ≡ F. So, perhaps the argument is to show whether the premises entail that E ≡ F is true.

Wait, but in this case, the premises are E → (F ∨ ~G), F → (~E ∨ ~G), and ~(E ≡ F). So, in the case where E is T, F is F, G is F, the premises are all true, and E ≡ F is false. So, in that scenario, the premises are true, but the conclusion (E ≡ F) is false. So, that would make the argument invalid.

Wait, but the problem is whether the argument is valid. So, if in any scenario the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

In this case, yes, because in that scenario, premises are true, and the conclusion (E ≡ F) is false. So, the argument is invalid. So, the counterexample is when E is true, F is false, and G is false (since in this case, G is F, so if E is T, F is F, G would be F? Wait, let me check.

Wait, in case 1: E=T, F=F, G=F. So, premise 3 is ~(E ≡ F). Since E=T and F=F, E ≡ F is F, so the negation is T. So, premise 3 is true.

So, in this case, premises are true, and conclusion (E ≡ F) is false. So, the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when E is true, F is false, G is false. Wait, no, in this case, G is F, which is false. So, E is true, F is false, G is false.

Looking at the options, option E says: Invalid. Counterexample when E is false, F is true and G is false. No, that's not matching. Option D says: Valid. So that can't be.

Wait, but in the scenario I just thought of, E is true, F is false, G is false. Let me see if any of the options match this.

Looking at the options:

A: E=true, F=false, G=true → doesn't match because G is false.

B: Valid → no, because there's a counterexample.

C: E=true, F=false, G=true → no, G is true in this scenario, which is different.

D: Valid. No counterexample found → no, because I found a counterexample.

E: Invalid. Counterexample when E is false, F is true and G is false → no, because our E is true.

F: Invalid. Counterexample when F and G are true and E is false → no.

G: Invalid. Counterexample when E and F are true and G is false → no, because E is true, F is false.

Wait, none of the options match the scenario I just found. Did I make a mistake in my analysis?

Hmm, maybe I should check again. Let me go through the scenario again.

Case where E=T, F=F, G=F.

Premise 1: E → (F ∨ ~G). E=T. F=F, G=F → F ∨ ~G is F ∨ T (since ~G is T). So F ∨ T is T. So premise 1 is T.

Premise 2: F → (~E ∨ ~G). F=F. ~E=F. ~G=T. So, F → (F ∨ T) → F → T, which is T.

Premise 3: ~(E ≡ F) → T, since E=T, F=F → E≡F is F, so negation is T.

So all premises are T, and the conclusion (E≡F) is F. So, in this scenario, premises are true, and the conclusion is false. So the argument is invalid.

But looking at the options, none of them state this scenario. Let me look again at the options:

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when E is false, F is true and G is false → no, E is true here.

Option A: Invalid. Counterexample when E is true, F is false and G is true → no, because G is false.

Option C: Invalid. Counterexample when E and G are true and F is false → E and G are both true, but F is false. So, in this case, E=T, G=T, F=F.

Wait, that's a different case. Let me see if that's a possible scenario.

In this scenario: E=T, G=T, F=F.

Check premises:

Premise 1: E → (F ∨ ~G). E=T. F=F, G=T. So F ∨ ~G is F ∨ F (since ~G is F). So F ∨ F = F. So premise 1 becomes T → F → F is T.

Wait, no: T → F is F. So premise 1 is F.

Ah, right. So in this case, premise 1 is F, so the entire argument can't be valid. So, this is another counterexample.

Wait, so in this scenario, E=T, G=T, F=F.

Premise 1: E=T, F=F, G=T. So F ∨ ~G is F ∨ F (since ~G is F). So F ∨ F is F. So premise 1 is E→F → F, which is F.

So premise 1 is false, so the argument is invalid in this case as well.

So, perhaps any case where E and F are not equivalent (i.e., E=T, F=F) and G is whatever, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the counterexample is when E=T, F=F, and G=F, which I initially found. So the counterexample would be when E and F are not equivalent, and G is such that it doesn't affect the premises.

Wait, but the problem is that the user didn't state the conclusion. So perhaps the entire argument is about whether the premises lead to a contradiction, making it invalid.

Wait, perhaps the argument is to show that the premises lead to a contradiction. Let me see.

Wait, let's try to derive the conclusion from premises 1, 2, and 3. If I can do that, then the argument is invalid.

The conclusion would be the negation of premise 3, which is E ≡ F.

But wait, premise 3 is E ≡ F, its negation is E ≡ F. So, perhaps the argument is to show that premises 1, 2, and 3 together lead to the conclusion that E ≡ F is false.

Wait, but that can't be right because premise 3 is E ≡ F, and the conclusion would be its negation. So, if the premises include premise 3, and we're to derive its negation, that would make the argument invalid.

But the problem is, how can we derive E ≡ F from premises 1 and 2, given that premise 3 is E ≡ F?

Wait, perhaps I should try to derive E ≡ F from premises 1 and 2.

Wait, let me try that.

Premise 1: E → (F ∨ ~G)

Premise 2: F → (~E ∨ ~G)

I need to see if E ≡ F can be derived from these.

Let me assume E and F are equivalent, i.e., E ≡ F. Then, E and F are both true or both false.

Case 1: E=T, F=T.

From premise 1: E=T → (F=T ∨ ~G). So F ∨ ~G must be T. Since F is T, this is true.

From premise 2: F=T → (~E ∨ ~G). So ~E ∨ ~G must be T. Since E=T, ~E=F. So F ∨ ~G must be T. F is T, so it's true.

So in this case, premises 1 and 2 are satisfied.

Case 2: E=F=F, F=F.

From premise 1: E=F=F → (F=F ∨ ~G). Since F=F, F ∨ ~G is true (since F is F, regardless of G).

From premise 2: F=F=F → (~E ∨ ~G). So ~E ∨ ~G must be T. E=F=F → ~E is T. So regardless of G, this is true.

So in this case, premises 1 and 2 are satisfied.

So, from premises 1 and 2, E≡F can be derived. Because in both cases (E=F or E=T), the premises are satisfied.

Wait, but that would mean that premises 1 and 2 imply E≡F, which is premise 3. So, if premises 1 and 2 imply premise 3, then the argument premises (1,2,3) are inconsistent, making the argument invalid.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Let me see:

If premises 1 and 2 imply E≡F, then adding premise 3 (which is E≡F) would lead to E≡F being true, which would mean that the premises are inconsistent. So, the argument would be invalid because premises 1 and 2 imply premise 3, which is given as valid, leading to a contradiction.

So, in this case, the argument is invalid because the premises are contradictory.

Therefore, the counterexample would be any scenario where premises 1 and 2 are true, leading to E≡F being true. So, whenever E≡F is true, the premises 1 and 2 are true.

Looking at the options, which scenario makes this possible.

Looking at the options:

Option G: Invalid. Counterexample when E and F are true and G is false.

Wait, in that case, E=T, F=T, G=F.

Check premises 1 and 2.

Premise 1: E=T → (F=T ∨ ~G). F=T is T, so F ∨ ~G is T. So premise 1 is T.

Premise 2: F=T → (~E ∨ ~G). So ~E is F (since E=T), ~G is T (since G=F). So F ∨ ~G is T. So premise 2 is T.

So, in this scenario, premises 1 and 2 are true, E≡F is true (since E=F). So the argument's premises (1 and 2) lead to premise 3, hence making the argument invalid.

So the counterexample is when E and F are both true, and G is false.

Looking at the options, option G says: Invalid. Counterexample when E and F are true and G is false.

So, the correct answer should be option G.
</think>

The argument is invalid because the premises imply the conclusion (E ≡ F). A counterexample is when E and F are both true, and G is false. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G: Invalid. Counterexample when E and F are true and G is false.
