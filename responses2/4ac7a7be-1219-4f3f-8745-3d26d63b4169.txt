Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about economics and noneconomics arguments in capitalism. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking for the major noneconomic argument against pure capitalism. The options are A through J, each with a different point. From what I remember, noneconomic arguments are those that don't directly affect economics but are important for the functioning of the economy or society as a whole.

First, I need to recall the main noneconomic principles. Let's think about each option.

Option B: Capitalism ensures job security. I'm not sure about this one. Job security is a common argument in socialism, but is it a noneconomic argument in capitalism? I think in capitalism, there are various issues like unemployment, lack of job security, especially for low-skilled workers. So maybe B is correct.

Option C: Capitalism fosters cultural diversity. I've heard that capitalism can sometimes lead to more globalization and international trade, which can promote cultural exchange. So maybe this is a noneconomic argument.

Option A: Capitalism results in single authority. That's a pretty strong noneconomic argument. In a socialist system, there's a central authority, whereas capitalism has multiple levels of government. This raises concerns about accountability and governance structures.

Option E: Capitalism encourages moral responsibility. This feels like a noneconomic argument because it's about personal behavior and ethics, which are not directly tied to the economic system.

Option F: Capitalism provides a platform for technological innovation. This seems like a strong noneconomic argument because without a strong economic foundation, innovation is harder to achieve.

Option G: Capitalism leads to wealth equality. That's an economic argument, so it's not the answer.

Option H: Capitalism improves international relations. Again, this is more about politics and diplomacy, not directly about the economy.

Option I: Capitalism enhances individual creativity. Creativity is a personal trait, and while it's valued, it's not a noneconomic argument.

Option J: Capitalism supports sustainable environmental practices. This is an economic concern but part of sustainability, which is a noneconomic argument.

So, the main noneconomic arguments I can think of are about the system's structure and its impact on society.

Looking back, the question asks for the "major" noneconomic argument. So, which of these is the most prominent or impactful?

Option E: Capitalism encourages moral responsibility. This is a significant argument because it reflects the ethical considerations within capitalism, which are not directly part of the economy but affect people's behavior.

Option B: Job security is a common social argument, but perhaps E is more about the broader societal impact, which is a noneconomic argument.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn between E and B. Let me think again. Job security is a social issue, but the question is about the noneconomic argument. The noneconomic argument is about the societal impact, whereas E is about the personal behavior.

I think among the options, E is a strong noneconomic argument because it's about how capitalism affects people's behavior beyond just the economy.

Alternatively, maybe B is correct because it's about job security, which is a social issue that arises from the lack of job security in capitalism. But the question is about noneconomic arguments, which are not economic issues but societal ones.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. The noneconomic arguments often include things like meritocracy, moral responsibility, individualism, and so on.

Wait, the question is about the major noneconomic argument. The options are:

A) Capitalism results in single authority
B) Job security
C) Foster cultural diversity
D) Personal freedom
E) Moral responsibility
F) Technological innovation for tech
G) Wealth equality
H) International relations
I) Creativity enhancement
J) Environmental sustainability

So, the main noneconomic arguments I've heard about are about individualism, meritocracy, cultural diversity, and moral responsibility. 

So, what's the 'major' one? Let me think. The question is about a major noneconomic argument. 

Option E: Capitalism encourages moral responsibility. This is a noneconomic argument because it's about personal behavior. It's a concern within capitalism, but it's not an economic issue.

Option B: Job security is a social issue, but perhaps it's considered a noneconomic argument because it's more about the consequences of capitalism rather than the system itself.

Wait, I think I learned that in capitalism, the lack of job security is a social problem, but the main noneconomic argument from a societal perspective is about individualism. So maybe E is more about the ethical behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I know that in capitalism, individual freedom is a noneconomic argument. Option D is personal freedom. But personal freedom is a weak noneconomic argument, perhaps.

Wait, no. More correctly, personal freedom is a social issue, not a noneconomic one. Noneconomic arguments are more about the system's impact beyond economics.

So, looking at the options, the main noneconomic argument is probably E: encourages moral responsibility. Because it's about people's ethical behavior, which is a noneconomic argument.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: think about what a noneconomic argument would entail. It's about societal structures or behaviors, not economic ones. So, the options that are about how people behave ethically, their personal freedoms, etc., are noneconomic.

Looking at the options again:

E: encourages moral responsibility. This is a noneconomic argument because it's about what people should do, beyond the economy.

B: Job security is a social issue, so perhaps not a noneconomic argument in the economic sense.

So, the correct answer is E: Capitalism encourages moral responsibility.

The major noneconomic argument against pure capitalism is the one that reflects societal behavior and ethical considerations beyond economic systems. Among the options, the argument of encouraging moral responsibility (Option E) is the most relevant as it pertains to personal ethics and behavior, which are not directly tied to the economy but have significant societal impacts.

Answer: E
