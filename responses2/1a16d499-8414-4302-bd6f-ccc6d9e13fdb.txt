Okay, so I have this question about audits and what could raise a question about possible illegal acts. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists 10 options, from A to J. I need to pick which one is a likely candidate for raising a question about illegal acts during an audit. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The entity has been consistently late in paying its taxes for the year. Hmm, that sounds like good financial reporting. Being late in paying taxes is a common fiscal responsibility and usually indicates proper accounting. I don't think it's a red flag for illegal acts. So probably not A.

Option B: The entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year. Oh wait, large checks to cash would mean they're using more cash than they should, like for business expenses. That's a red flag. It might indicate inefficient use of cash or possible fraud, especially if it's in large amounts. This could definitely raise questions about illegal acts.

Option C: The entity has a high turnover rate for its CFO position. High turnover could mean they're changing their approach, which is a good thing. It shows they're focused on improving their services. Not something that would raise illegal acts. So probably not C.

Option D: The entity was a campaign contributor to several local political candidates. campaign contributions are a big deal. They can affect financial statements, and if they're a contributor, it might be seen as manipulating revenue or financial reporting. This is a red flag. So D could be a candidate.

Option E: Material internal control weaknesses previously reported to management were not corrected. If the controls aren't corrected, it's a serious issue. Internal controls can be a red flag because they indicate management's concern but not necessarily illegal. Unless the controls are so flawed that they're risky, but I don't think this directly raises a question about illegal acts. So E might not be the answer.

Option F: The entity has made several large donations to non-profit organizations. This is about transparency and giving to public entities. It's a standard practice and doesn't necessarily indicate illegal behavior. So probably not F.

Option G: The entity's financial statements show a consistent decrease in revenue over the year. A decline in revenue could be a red flag because it might indicate poor financial management or potential fraud. It's more about financial reporting than illegal acts, unless it's a significant drop that's managed improperly.

Option H: The entity has recently changed its accounting firm multiple times. This could be seen as a management concern to adjust their approach. But unless it's a recent change that's highly concerning, it might not raise illegal acts. For example, maybe they switched to a new firm only to find it too costly or not effective. But that's more about management procedures than illegal acts.

Option I: The entity has a significantly higher expenditure on office supplies than usual. Expenditures are a normal business expense. If it's way higher, it could be a red flag. It's just a matter of financial reporting and not illegal behavior. So I don't think I is the answer.

Option J: Related party transactions, although properly disclosed, were pervasive during the year. This indicates that the entity is affecting their own accounts, like in gardening. This is about proper disclosure and could affect the entity's financial statements. It's more a matter of integrity than anything illegal. So J is probably not the right answer.

So now, reviewing the options, the most likely candidates are B, D, G, or F.

Wait, F was about donations. That's a bit unusual. If they donate money to non-profits, it's transparency and not illegal. So F doesn't seem like it would raise a question about illegal acts.

Between B, D, G, and E. Well, E talks about internal controls. If they had control issues not corrected, they might have management concern. But that's more about management's management and not necessarily illegal. So E is less likely.

So B, D, G, and maybe E are candidates.

Wait, another angle: material internal control weaknesses. If they're not corrected, it's a problem. But if the controls are improperly implemented, that's a red flag. Unless it's something like a new accounting method that's not considered risky, but I'm not sure.

Wait, also, for a material weakness, management might have been concerned that they could lead to fraud or emergencies. So if the controls are not corrected, it's a problem. But in this case, the question is about what would raise a question about illegal acts. So if controls are wrong but not corrected, that's a problem with management's approach, not necessarily illegal behavior.

Wait, but looking at E: management hasn't corrected any material internal controls. So that's a problem. So if E is the case, management is concerned, but E doesn't point to illegal acts. So the question is which is more likely to raise a question about illegal acts.

So, the question is about which audit finding would raise a question about illegal acts. So perhaps the answer is D: campaign contributions.

But wait, campaign contributions are more about financial reporting and transparency, not necessarily illegal. But companies can have donations to political candidates, which is a legitimate business practice if done properly. So if they do that, it might not indicate a problem.

But if a company is making a lot of donations, that could be a red flag. For example, if they're inconsistent. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at the options again. Let's think about each one.

D: Large checks to cash. That's a clear indication of expense management. If the company is using cash for business purposes, that's a red flag. It's more about standard business practices, but if the amount is inconsistent, that could be a problem.

E: If internal controls were recently changed and not corrected, that's a problem. It's about management's concern but not necessarily illegal behavior.

So perhaps the best candidates are D and E. But I'm to choose between all options.

Alternatively, think about which of these could indicate that the company is manipulating their financials. For example, if an entity has a history of large checks to cash, that's a red flag because it's inconsistent and could indicate poor management.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think of each option again.

Option B: Large checks to cash. That's a clear financial management issueâ€”using cash for business purposes. If you're using cash for stuff like office supplies, you can't use it for other things. So that's a red flag. But if the company is using cash for business expenses, that's normal. It's a red flag but not necessarily illegal.

Option D: Making large donations to non-profits. That's transparency and proper business practice. If a company is consistently donating money to candidates, it's a matter of good business conduct.

Option G: Decrease in revenue. That's a problem if the company is underreporting. It could indicate poor financial management.

Option E: Internal control weaknesses not corrected. That's a problem but not directly about illegal acts. It's more about management's concern.

So which of these is more likely to raise a question about illegal acts?

If the entity is reporting a decrease in revenue, that's a problem. It could be due to good management, or it could be due to fraud. But because the question is about what would raise a question, perhaps it's about a more serious issue.

Wait, but the question is about which would raise a question about illegal acts. So the most likely is the one that indicates something is wrong or unusual.

So the options are B, D, G, and E.

Wait, but I'm trying to think about which of these could be related to illegal acts. Let's see.

If the entity made several large checks to cash, that would be a bad practice. So the entity is using cash for business expenses, which is bad. So that's a red flag, but not illegal.

D: Large donations to non-profits. That's a good business practice, but if done improperly, maybe it's a problem. For example, if it's a big expense and they don't know how much, it could be a red flag.

Wait, but the question is about illegal acts. So making a large donation could be a problem if it's not properly disclosed. But if the entity is properly disclosed, it's okay.

Alternatively, making a lot of office supplies. That's a significant expense. If the company is spending more on office supplies than usual, that could be a red flag. But is that an illegal act? Probably not, unless it's a misuse of funds.

Alternatively, if the entity is changing its accounting firm recently, that's a good thing. management might have concerns about the new firm. But management's recent change isn't necessarily a red flag for illegal acts.

So, which of these is the most likely to raise a question? Probably D: making large checks to cash, because it's a clear financial management issue. It's inconsistent with proper business practices, which is a red flag but not necessarily illegal.

Wait, but some companies do this. For example, they might have to use cash for some expenses, but that's not necessarily a problem.

Alternatively, if the entity is making a lot of donations, it's a good business practice, but if they're not, that's a problem. However, the question is about illegal acts, not just business practices.

Hmm. Another angle: during an audit, which of these findings would raise a question? Like, if a company is consistently late in paying taxes, that's a matter of proper accounting. Tax payments are normal and not illegal.

So the most likely is either D or E.

Wait, E is about internal control weaknesses not being corrected. If the internal controls are not effective, it's a problem. But it's not directly about illegal acts. So perhaps E is not the answer.

So, between B and D: B is about using cash for business expenses, which is a red flag but not illegal. D is about large donations to non-profits, which is good business conduct unless they're inconsistent.

But the question is about what would raise a question about illegal acts. So, if the entity is making a lot of large checks to cash, that's a red flag. It's inconsistent with proper business practices. So that would raise a question.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option B: Several large checks to cash. That's bad because they're using cash for business expenses. It's inconsistent with proper accounting because they shouldn't be using cash for business; it's a mistake in their accounting.

Option D: Large donations. That's a good business practice, but if they're doing it improperly, it could be a problem. But in that case, it's not illegal; it's just bad business.

So, the question is about illegal acts. Making a lot of checks to cash could indicate that they're not managing their cash properly, which could be a red flag but not necessarily illegal.

But if the entity is making a lot of office supplies, that's a big expense. If they're overextending, that's a problem but not illegal.

Wait, perhaps D is more indicative of a problem. Let me think: if an entity is consistently making large checks to cash, that's a bad practice. For example, if they're using cash for business expenses, that's inconsistent with proper accounting. That's a red flag. So that would raise a question about possible illegal acts.

Alternatively, E: if internal controls are not corrected, it's a problem. But that's more about management than illegal acts.

Hmm. So I'm leaning towards option B and D being possible.

But the question is which one is more likely to raise a question about illegal acts.

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. The options are about what would raise a question. So, which of these would raise a question about whether the entity was doing something illegal.

For instance, making a lot of office supplies is a straightforward business expense, which is normal and not illegal. So E, which is about internal controls, is not the issue.

So the options left are B, D, G, and E.

Wait, going back, I think the correct answer is D: the entity was a campaign contributor. But wait, campaign contributions are more about transparency, not necessarily illegal.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option.

The question is which of these would raise a question about illegal acts.

If the entity is making large checks to cash (B), that's a bad accounting practice, indicating a potential problem. So that could raise a question.

If the entity is making a lot of office supplies, that's a normal expense and not illegal.

D: making a lot of donations to non-profits. If done properly, it's okay. But if they're not, that's a problem. But again, not illegal.

Wait, but if the entity is making a lot of office supplies, that's a problem because it's a significant expense. But is that considered illegal? I don't think so. It's a standard expense. Unless it's a misuse, but that's not indicated here.

Alternatively, if the entity is not correcting internal controls, that's a problem. But that's not about illegal acts.

So, perhaps the answer is B: making several large checks to cash. Because that's a clear indication of poor bookkeeping and inconsistency with normal business practices, which could be a red flag but not necessarily illegal.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about which finding would raise a question about illegal acts. So making a lot of office supplies is a problem, but not illegal. But the options B and D are the ones about financial management.

So the correct answer is either B or D. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, the question is about which of the following would raise a question concerning possible illegal acts. The other options are about internal controls, which don't directly indicate illegal acts.

So I think the correct answer is B: the entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year. That's a clear indication of poor bookkeeping, which could be a red flag, but not illegal.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've heard of companies having issues with that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: recent changes in accounting not corrected, which is a problem but not about illegal acts.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Let me think of the options again.

The question is which of the following, discovered during an audit, most likely would raise a question concerning possible illegal acts.

So, the options are all possible findings, and we have to pick the one that is a red flag for illegal.

If the entity is making large checks to cash, that's a red flag. It's inconsistent with proper business accounting.

So option B would raise a question.

Alternatively, if the entity made large office supplies, that's normal but could be a red flag if they're overextended.

So, I'm not sure. But I think the answer is D: the entity was a campaign contributor. No, campaign contributions are more about transparency and not illegal.

Wait, perhaps another approach: think about each option and what it suggests.

Option E: management hasn't corrected internal controls. That's a problem, but not illegal.

Option B: This suggests poor bookkeeping, which is a red flag but not illegal.

Option D: Making large donations to non-profits. If done properly, it's okay. If not, it's a problem. But again, it doesn't raise a question about illegal acts.

Wait, but maybe making a lot of office supplies is a problem because it's a significant expense. But is that illegal? I don't think so. So not the answer.

Alternatively, making a lot of office supplies would be a problem because it's a significant expense, but that's not illegal.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the actual auditing process: which of these would raise a red flag.

If an entity consistently pays taxes late, that's a problem, but not illegal.

If they make a lot of office supplies, that's a problem but not illegal.

If they make a lot of donations, that's a problem but not illegal.

So the correct answer is the one that's more obviously an issue, but not necessarily illegal.

But the options are: I think the answer is D: the entity was a campaign contributor to several local political candidates during the year.

Wait, campaign contributions are probably not illegal. So it's not the right answer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. I think I'll have to make a call. The likely answer is D because it's about financial reporting, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the question is about illegal acts. So perhaps the correct answer is E: management hasn't corrected internal controls. But that's a problem, not a question about illegal acts.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of each option again.

Another angle: which of these would indicate that the company is manipulating their finances in some way that could be illegal.

Making a lot of office supplies would be a problem in financial reporting, but not illegal. So E is not the answer.

So back to B and D.

Option B: large checks to cash. It's a red flag, but not illegal.

Wait, perhaps making large office supplies is a red flag. But the options don't include that.

So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the correct answer is D: the entity was a campaign contributor. Because that's about transparency, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: recent changes not corrected. But that's not about illegal.

Wait, I'm really not certain. I think the answer is B, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps D.

Wait, another approach: the options that are about internal controls are E, which is a problem but not about illegal acts. So the answer can't be E.

The options that are about financial reporting are B, D, G.

So which of these is more likely to raise a question about illegal acts.

I think the answer is B: making several large checks to cash. Because it's a clear indication of poor accounting and financial management, which could be a red flag, but not directly illegal.

Alternatively, D: making large donations is a problem but not illegal.

Alternatively, E is about internal controls, which is a problem but not illegal.

So now, I think the correct answer is B: because it's a clear financial management issue, which is a red flag. But I'm not sure it's illegal.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the correct answer is E: because management hasn't corrected internal controls, which is a problem but not illegal.

Wait, the question is about illegal acts. So, perhaps the correct answer is D: because the company is a candidate for political donations, which is a red flag but not illegal.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. I think I'll have to pick between B and D.

Between B and D, I think B is more likely to raise a question about illegal acts because it's about financial management, which can be seen as a red flag but not illegal.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's about transparency, which is a red flag but not illegal.

Wait, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is D. Because a lot of donations could be a problem if they're inconsistent or misused.

Wait, no. Campaign contributions are standard and not illegal. So option D is not the answer.

Hmm. I think I'm going to have to choose the answer as B: the entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year.

Because it's a clear financial management issue that could indicate a problem, but not directly illegal.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: the entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year**. This is because the practice of using cash for business expenses is inconsistent with proper accounting standards and could indicate a lack of accountability, which is a red flag but not directly illegal. The other options either pertain to internal control issues (E) or financial reporting concerns (B, D, G) and do not raise a question about illegal acts. 

ANSWER: B
