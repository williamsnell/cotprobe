Okay, so I've got this second-order boundary value problem to solve. The equation is y'' minus 2y' plus 2y equals zero, and the boundary conditions are y(0) equals 0 and y(pi/2) equals 1. I need to find y(pi/4). Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for linear homogeneous differential equations like this, we can solve it using the characteristic equation method. The standard approach is to find the roots of the characteristic equation. 

So the differential equation is y'' - 2y' + 2y = 0. Let me write the characteristic equation. That would be r squared minus 2r plus 2 equals zero. So, r² - 2r + 2 = 0.

To solve for r, I can use the quadratic formula: r = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2. Because the discriminant is b² - 4ac, which in this case is (−2)^2 which is 4, minus 4*1*2, which is 8. So 4 minus 8 is -4. So the square root of -4 is 2i. 

So the roots are (2 ± 2i)/2, which simplifies to 1 ± i. Oh, wait, complex roots. So the general solution for such a case is y(t) = e^(at) multiplied by (C1*cos(bt) + C2*sin(bt)), where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. Here, a is 1, and b is 1. So the general solution should be y = e^t (C1 cos t + C2 sin t).

Now, I need to apply the boundary conditions to find the constants C1 and C2.

The first condition is y(0) = 0. Let's plug t=0 into the general solution. e^0 is 1, cos(0) is 1, sin(0) is 0. So y(0) = 1*(C1*1 + C2*0)= C1. And that's equal to zero. So C1 must be zero. 

So now the solution simplifies to y = e^t (0 + C2 sin t) = C2 e^t sin t. But wait, let me check that. Oh wait, no, because I thought the general solution is y(t) = e^(at) (C1 cos(bt) + C2 sin(bt)). So with a=1 and b=1, it's e^t (C1 cos t + C2 sin t). Then, because C1 is zero, it becomes C2 e^t sin t. 

But wait, let me think again. The initial condition was y(0)=0. So when t=0, the function is zero. So, yes, that's why C1=0.

Now, the second condition is y(pi/2)=1. So let's plug t=pi/2 into our current solution. 

y(pi/2) = C2 e^(pi/2) sin(pi/2). Sin(pi/2) is 1. So y(pi/2) = C2 e^(pi/2) * 1 = C2 e^(pi/2). And this equals 1. So C2 = 1 / e^(pi/2).

Wait, but let me make sure. So C2 = 1 / e^{pi/2}.

So the particular solution is y(t) = (1 / e^{pi/2}) e^t sin t. Because C2 is 1/e^{pi/2}, so when multiplied by e^t, it becomes e^{t - pi/2}.

But wait, another way to write that is e^{(t - pi/2)} sin t. Alternatively, perhaps factoring e^{-pi/2} into the exponent: y(t) = e^{t - pi/2} sin t. Or e^{(t - pi/2)} sin t.

So, now I need to find y(pi/4). Let's compute that. 

y(pi/4) = e^{(pi/4) - (pi/2)} sin(pi/4). 

Simplify the exponent: pi/4 - pi/2 is equal to -pi/4. So the exponential part is e^{-pi/4}. 

Sin(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, which is approximately 0.7071.

So y(pi/4) = e^{-pi/4} * sqrt(2)/2. 

Wait, let me calculate that. What's the value of e^{-pi/4}? Pi is approximately 3.1416, so pi/4 is about 0.7854. e^{-0.7854} is approximately 0.4558. 

So y(pi/4) = 0.4558 * 0.7071.

Let me calculate that: 0.4558 * 0.7071. Let me do 0.45 * 0.7071. 0.45 times 0.7 is 0.315, 0.45 * 0.0071 is about 0.003195. So 0.315 + 0.003195 is about 0.318195. But wait, the actual calculation is 0.4558 * 0.7071.

Alternatively, 0.4558 * 0.7071. Let me compute 0.4 * 0.7 = 0.28, 0.0558 * 0.7 = ~0.03906, 0.4 * 0.0071 ~0.00284, and 0.0558 * 0.0071 ~0.000396. Adding these gives 0.28 + 0.03906 = 0.31906; plus 0.00284 is 0.3219; plus 0.000396 is about 0.3224. So approximately 0.322.

Looking back at the options, option G is 0.275, H is 0.322, so H is 0.322. So the answer is H.

To solve the boundary value problem, we first find the general solution using the characteristic equation. The roots are complex, leading to a solution of the form:

y(t) = e^t (C1 cos t + C2 sin t).

Applying the boundary condition y(0) = 0 gives C1 = 0. The second condition y(π/2) = 1 yields C2 = e^{-π/2}.

The specific solution is y(t) = e^{t - π/2} sin t.

Finally, substituting t = π/4 gives y(π/4) = e^{-π/4} * sin(π/4). Calculating this numerically leads to approximately 0.322.
