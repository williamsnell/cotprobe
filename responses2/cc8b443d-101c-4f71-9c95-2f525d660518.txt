Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about what happens when inventories decrease unexpectedly. 

I remember that inventory turnover is a key concept here. It's about how often businesses sell and replace their stock of goods. If inventories are decreasing, that means the company is selling more products than it's producing, right? So the rate at which inventory is used is higher than normal.

Wait, if the company is selling more than it's producing, that means its output is probably not keeping up as quickly. Because if production is supposed to match output, but they're selling more, they might need to slow down production. So production should start to fall. That would mean that output is not increasing as planned; it's beginning to decrease. 

Looking at the options, option D says output to slow down. Option B says output to fall. Which one is correct? Well, if output is decreasing, that's a negative trend, which could lead to a recession. But the question is about what's expected. 

Another angle: when inventories drop, it's a signal that demand is increasing. Or maybe the economy is overheating. But I think the main point is about production. If the company is using up more inventory, it might not need to produce as much, so production starts to slow down. 

Wait, but sometimes companies might ramp up production if demand increases, but in this case, it's an unplanned decrease. So the initial effect is likely a slowdown in production. So option D seems right. 

I'm a bit confused about options E and F. E is demand to decrease, which doesn't fit because a decrease in inventories would mean more production. F is saving to fall, which doesn't directly follow. 

So putting it together, the correct answer should be D: output to slow down.

The correct answer is D: output to slow down.
