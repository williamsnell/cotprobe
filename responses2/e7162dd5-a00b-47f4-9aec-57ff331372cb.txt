Okay, so I've got this question about a Gigabit Ethernet LAN and frames getting destroyed. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about computer networks, specifically Ethernet LANs.

From what I remember, in a LAN, data is transmitted over a single physical connection between two or more computers. The key here is that all data is sent in chunks called frames. Each frame has a header and a data section. The header is usually 8 bits, which is pretty standard.

The question says the average frame size is 1000 bytes. Wait, but the LAN is a Gigabit Ethernet, which I think has a speed of 1 Gbps, right? So that's 1000 bits per second. Wait, but wait, the frame size is 1000 bytes. Oh, wait, wait, because bits and bytes are related. One byte is 8 bits. So 1000 bytes would be 8000 bits. But wait, in a Gigabit Ethernet, the data transfer rate is 1000 bits per second. So if each frame is 8000 bits, how long does that take to send?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. A Gigabit Ethernet is 1000 bits per second. So, the time for a frame to be transmitted is the number of bits in the frame divided by the speed. The frame size is 1000 bytes, which is 1000 * 8 = 8000 bits. So time per frame is 8000 bits / 1000 bits per second = 8 seconds per frame.

Wait, but the question says a noise of 2ms occurs. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the time to send a frame is 8 seconds, which is way longer than 2ms. Unless I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames lost due to the noise. So maybe it's the number of frames that can't be sent before the noise propagates and affects the network.

Wait, another thought: in a network, if a signal goes through a certain distance, it might cause a bit flip or other errors, but perhaps this is about the time it takes for the signal to reach a point where there's a jammer or something, causing frames to be lost. Or maybe it's a question about the time frame during which frames can't be sent because of the noise.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that each frame has a certain transmission time, and the noise causes a delay that affects how much data can be sent in the time before the noise propagates. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how much time there is for frames to be sent without interference, and then how much data can be sent in that time. But the problem states that the noise occurs on the LAN, but doesn't specify for how long. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "If a noise of 2ms occurs on the LAN, how many frames are destroyed?" Wait, 2ms? That's very short, but the transmission time is 8 seconds. So perhaps the noise is causing a frame to be lost when the signal has to go through the network and reach a point where there's a problem. Or maybe it's about the time it takes for a frame to be sent, and the noise causing a collision, leading to frames being lost.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the time it takes for the noise to affect the network and how much data can be sent in that time. But the time is given as 2ms. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the time it takes for a frame to be sent, and the noise causes the frame to be lost if it takes longer than the noise's effect. But that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe the noise is causing a frame to not be transmitted if it's too long, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. Maybe it's about the number of frames lost due to a 2ms delay. For that, perhaps the time delay is 2ms, and the transmission time per frame is 8 seconds. So the number of frames that can't be sent in that time would be the integer division of 8 seconds by 2ms, but wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me think in terms of data. If each frame takes 8 seconds to send, and the noise occurs for 2 ms, perhaps the frames can't be sent during that 2ms. But that would mean only 0 frames are lost, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of frames lost when a signal is delayed. So considering that the frame takes 8 seconds, and the noise lasts for 2ms, the frames can't be sent in that 2ms. So the number of frames lost would be 8 seconds / (2ms per frame). But wait, 8 seconds is 8000 milliseconds, so 8000 / 2 = 4000 frames. But that's way higher than any of the options given. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the frames are lost if the data can't be sent within the 2ms delay. For that, the number of frames that can't be sent in 2ms is 8 seconds / 2 ms. But wait, that would be 8000 frames. None of the options is that high. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Another thought: perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can be sent in the time it takes for a signal to travel from one end of the network to the other, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the maximum number of frames that can be in transit at the same time, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should try to think of the time it takes for the first frame to be sent, and then see when the 2ms occurs. Oh wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent before the noise causes a collision, leading to frames being lost.

Wait, let's think about signal propagation time and transmission time. The transmission time for a frame is 8 seconds. The propagation delay (distance-dependent delay) is the time it takes for the signal to reach the end of the network. But if a frame is sent, it takes 8 seconds to arrive. But if the network is 1000 meters (which is about 324 yards), and the speed is 1 Gbps, the propagation delay is (distance * speed) / (2*10^9). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the speed of light is about 2.1e8 m/s, but in a 1000-m Ethernet, the propagation delay would be (1000 meters) / (2.1e8 m/s) = approximately 4.76e-6 seconds, which is about 4.76 microseconds.

So the total time for a frame to go from start to end is the propagation time plus the transmission time. The propagation time is about 4.76 microseconds, and the transmission time is 8 seconds. So the total is about 8.0000476 seconds.

But the question says a noise of 2ms occurs. So perhaps the noise is in the network, causing a delay that affects the frames. Or perhaps the noise is a jammer that disrupts the transmission.

Wait, maybe the scenario is that all the frames have to wait for 2ms before they can be sent. So the number of frames that can't be sent during that time is 8 seconds / 2 milliseconds. Wait, but 2 milliseconds is 0.002 seconds. So 8 / 0.002 is 4000 frames. But that's not an option except maybe E:125, but wait 4000 is not an option. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the frames are sent in chunks, and the time for each frame is 8 seconds, but if the network is 8000 bits, but in 2ms, how many frames can't be sent. Wait, 8 seconds is 8000 ms. So 8000 ms divided by 2 ms per frame would be 4000 frames. But the options don't have 4000. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the signal is too long. So if the network is 1000 meters, and the propagation delay is 4.76 microseconds, but the noise occurs for 2ms. So during that time, how many frames can't be sent.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the transmission time is longer than the noise. So if the frames take 8 seconds to send, and the noise lasts for 2ms, then the number of frames that can't be sent is (8 sec) / (2 ms) = 4000, which again isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the time it takes for the 2ms to cause a frame to be lost. For example, if a frame is sent, and the signal takes 2ms to reach the other end, then during those 2ms, any frames sent before that are lost, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the network is only 1000 meters, so the propagation delay is 4.76 microseconds, and the time for a frame to be transmitted is 8 seconds. So a 2ms noise could cause the frames sent in the first 2ms to be lost. But that would mean 8 seconds / 2 ms = 4000 frames. But 4000 isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the right way.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about how data is sent. Each frame takes 8 seconds to send. If a noise lasts for 2ms, perhaps the frames that are sent in the 2ms time are lost. So the number of frames that can't be sent is (2ms) / (8000 bits per frame) * (1 frame per 8 seconds). Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent within the 2ms delay. So the number of frames is 2ms divided by the time taken per frame. But wait, the frame takes 8 seconds to send, so even in 2ms, you can't send any frame. So that gives zero frames, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the way.

Another angle: maybe the question is about the number of frames that can be sent in the 2ms time. So 2ms is 2e-3 seconds. The transmission rate is 1000 bits per second. So in 2ms, how many bits can be sent? 1000 * 2e-3 = 2 bits. How many frames is that? Each frame is 8000 bits. So 2 bits / 8000 bits per frame = 0.00025 frames, which is about 0. So no frames are lost. But that doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent during the 2ms. But that would be zero.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the propagation delay. The propagation delay is 4.76 microseconds (as calculated earlier), which is 4.76e-6 seconds. So during the 2ms noise, the frames sent in the first 4.76e-6 seconds would be lost. So the number of frames lost is (2e-3) / (4.76e-6) = approximately 420 frames. But the options don't have 420. So that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the signal is too long. So if the network is 1000 meters, the propagation delay is 4.76 microseconds. The noise lasts for 2ms. So the number of frames that can't be sent is (2ms) / (4.76e-6) = approximately 420, which is still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of frames lost due to the 2ms delay. So each frame takes 8 seconds to send, and the noise lasts for 2ms. So the number of frames that can't be sent during the 2ms is 8 seconds / (2ms) = 4000. But this is way higher than any of the options, except maybe none of them? But the options don't have 4000. So perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the transmission time is longer than the noise. So if the network is only 1000 meters, the propagation delay is 4.76 microseconds. The noise is 2ms, which is much longer than the propagation delay. So the frames sent before the noise occurs are lost. But that's the same as the 420 frames.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the data transfer rate and the frame size.

The network speed is 1 Gbps (1000 bits per second). Each frame is 1000 bytes, which is 8000 bits.

Time per frame = 8000 bits / 1000 bits/sec = 8 seconds per frame.

The noise is 2ms. So during the 2ms, how many frames can't be sent? Well, the frames are sent at 8000 bits per 8 seconds. So in 2ms, the number of bits sent is 1000 bits (since 1 Gbps is 1000 bits/sec). So 1000 bits / 8000 bits per frame = 0.125 frames. So 0 frames, perhaps. So none are destroyed.

But that's not matching any options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent before the 2ms of noise occurs. So the first 2ms of the network's operation is the noise. Any frames sent before that are lost. So how many frames can be sent in 2ms?

2 milliseconds = 2e-3 seconds.

Transmission rate is 1000 bits/sec, so data sent in 2e-3 seconds is 1000 * 2e-3 = 2 bits.

Each frame is 8000 bits. So 2 bits / 8000 bits per frame = 0.00025 frames. So 0 frames. So answer is 0, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the frames are sent in chunks, so the 8 seconds is the time per frame. But if the network is only 1000 meters away, the propagation delay is 4.76 microseconds. So the total time per frame is 4.76e-6 sec + 8 sec ≈ 8.000000476e-03 sec.

Wait, but the question is about a single frame. So perhaps the transmission time is 8 seconds, and the question is about how many frames can't be sent before the 2ms noise occurs. So if the noise occurs for 2ms, how many frames can't be sent in that time. So 8 seconds / 2ms = 4000 frames. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time it takes for a frame to be transmitted. So if the frame takes 8 seconds to send, and the network is 1000 meters, the propagation delay is 4.76 microseconds. So the total time is 8 seconds plus 4.76 microseconds. So the transmission starts at t=0 and ends at t=8s. So any frames sent before t=2ms are lost. So how many frames can be sent in 2ms? Since each frame takes 8 seconds to send, no frames can be sent in 2ms. So 0 frames.

But the options don't have 0. So perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent during the time the network is in transit. Or perhaps it's about the number of frames that can't be sent because of the 2ms.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters away and the 2ms is the propagation delay. So the frames sent before the 2ms of propagation delay are lost. So the number of frames is 2ms / (4.76e-6 sec) = about 420 frames. But that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the data transfer rate. The data transfer rate is 1 Gbps. Each frame is 1000 bytes, which is 8000 bits.

So the number of frames that can be sent per second is 1 Gbps / (8000 bits/ frame) = 1000000000 / 8000 = 12500 frames per second.

So in 2ms, which is 0.002 seconds, the number of frames sent is 12,500 * 0.002 = 25 frames.

Wait, this would be if the frames are sent continuously. But if each frame takes 8 seconds to send, then during the 2ms of the noise, any frames sent before that are lost. So the number of frames that can't be sent is 0.002 seconds * 12,500 frames/sec = 25 frames.

Wait, but that's not in the options. The options are 750, 500, etc. So perhaps I'm considering the wrong frame size. Let me double-check.

If frame size is 1000 bytes = 8000 bits. So data send rate is 1000 * 1000 bits = 1e6 bits per second? No, wait, 1 Gbps is 1e9 bits per second. So 1e9 bits/second divided by 8000 bits per frame = 1e9 / 8000 = 12500 frames per second.

So in 2 ms, it's 2e-3 seconds. So number of frames sent is 12500 * 2e-3 = 25 frames. But that's 25 frames, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters away, and the 2ms is the time it takes for the network to reach the point where the signal is lost. So the frames sent before the network is 1000 meters away are lost. So the frames sent in the first 1000 meters (4.76 microseconds) are lost. So the number of frames is (4.76e-6 sec) / (8 sec/ frame) = 4.76e-10 frames. That's practically zero.

But again, that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of frames that can't be sent due to the 2ms. So each frame takes 8 seconds. So the number of frames that can't be sent in 2ms is the integer part of 8/(2e-3) = 4000. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent in the time it takes for the signal to reach a certain point. So for example, if the signal takes 2ms to reach a point, then any frames sent before that are lost. So the number of frames is (2e-3) / (8e-3) ) frames? Wait, 2e-3 is the time to reach a point. Each frame takes 8e-3 seconds to reach that point. So the number of frames that can't be sent is 2e-3 / 8e-3 = 0.25 frames. So 0 frames, which is not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters, and the frames are sent in chunks that take 2ms. So the frames that are sent first can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters, and the 2ms is the time for the signal to reach the first frame. So the number of frames that can't be sent is (2ms) / (4.76e-6 sec) ) = approximately 420 frames.

But again, none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the propagation delay. Let me recalculate that.

Propagation speed in a 1000-meter Ethernet network is 2.1e8 meters per second. So the propagation delay is (1000 meters) / (2.1e8 meters per second) ) = 1000 / 210,000,000 = 4.7619e-6 seconds, which is 4.76 microseconds. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Let's think about the number of frames that can't be sent during the 2ms. So each frame takes 8 seconds. So the number of frames that can't be sent is 2 ms / 8 s = 0.25. But that's not an integer, so perhaps the question is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters, and the 2ms is the time for the signal to reach the end of the network. So the frames sent on the way can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters. So how many frames can't be sent is the number of frames that are sent before the 2ms. So the number of frames is (2 ms) / (time per frame). Wait, time per frame is 8 seconds. So (2e-3) / (8e-3) ) = 0.25 frames, which is 0.25 frames, which is 0.25 * number of bits? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters, and the 2ms is the time for the signal to reach the first frame. So the number of frames that can't be sent is 2 ms / (time to send the first frame). But the time to send the first frame is 8 seconds. So 2 ms is 0.002 seconds, which is much less than 8 seconds, so the number of frames that can't be sent is 0. So perhaps the answer is zero, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The question says a noise of 2 ms occurs. So perhaps the frames that are sent before the noise are lost. So how many frames can be sent before the 2 ms of noise occurs?

Each frame takes 8 seconds to send. So the frames sent before the 2 ms would have to be sent in the first 2 ms. But 8 seconds is way longer than 2 ms. So no frames can be sent before the 2 ms. Thus, the answer is zero.

But the options don't have zero. So perhaps I'm missing a critical aspect of the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the frames are sent in chunks, and each chunk is sent in 2 ms. So the number of chunks is 2 ms / (time per frame). But the time per frame is 8 seconds, so 2 ms is much less than 8 seconds, so no chunks can be sent. So again, zero frames.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters, and the 2 ms is the time for the signal to reach a point where the frames are sent. So the frames are sent in 2 ms, but each frame takes 8 seconds to reach that point, so the frames can't be sent. So the number of frames that can't be sent is 2 ms / (time per frame). But time per frame is 8 seconds, so 2 ms is 0.002 seconds, which is way less than 8 seconds, so no frames can be sent before the 2 ms. So again, zero.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for an alternative approach or perhaps think that the number of frames that can't be sent is 2 ms divided by (8000 bits per frame) * (1 frame per 8 seconds). So 2e-3 / (8000) * (8) = (2e-3 *8) /8000 = (1.6e-2)/8e3 = 1.6e-5 frames. Which is approximately 1.6e-5, which is negligible. So zero frames.

But again, the options don't have zero. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the data transfer rate. The network is 1 Gbps, which is 1e9 bits per second. Each frame is 1000 bytes, which is 8000 bits. So the number of frames per second is 1e9 /8000 = 12500 frames per second.

So in 2 ms, which is 0.002 seconds, the number of frames sent is 12500 * 0.002 = 25 frames.

Hmm, that's 25 frames. But the options are 750, 500, etc. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters away. So the frames sent on the way would be lost. So how many frames can't be sent before the 2 ms of noise occurs? Well, each frame takes 8 seconds to send, so the frames sent on the way can't be sent. So the number of frames that can't be sent is (2 ms) / (time per frame). But time per frame is 8 seconds, so 2 ms is 0.002 s, which is much less than 8 s. So no frames can be sent on the way before the 2 ms noise occurs. So zero.

But again, the options don't have zero. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters, and the 2 ms is the time for the signal to reach the end of the network. So the frames sent on the way can't be sent. So the number of frames that can't be sent is (2 ms) / (time per frame). But time per frame is 8 seconds, so 2 ms is 0.002 s, which is much less than 8 s. So no frames can be sent on the way, so zero.

But I'm getting the same answer every time, which is zero, but it's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent before the noise occurs. So the frames sent before the 2 ms of noise occur. Each frame takes 8 seconds to send, so any frames sent before the 2 ms would be lost. So the number of frames that can't be sent is (2 ms) / (8 seconds) = 0.25 frames. So 0.25 frames, but that's not an integer, so perhaps the answer is 0 frames.

Wait, but the options are 750, 500, 250, 100, 60, 20, 10, 5, 3, 2. So perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent during the 2 ms noise period. So the frames that are sent during the 2 ms period are lost. So the number of frames that can't be sent is 2 ms * (how many bits per frame) / (data rate). But wait, the data rate is 1 Gbps, so 1e9 bits per second. Each frame is 8000 bits. So the number of frames per second is 1e9 /8000 = 12500 frames per second.

So in 2 ms, the number of frames sent is 12500 * 0.002 = 25 frames. So 25 frames are sent in 2 ms, meaning 25 frames can't be sent because they were sent before the 2 ms noise occurs. So the answer should be 25 frames, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the frames are sent in chunks, so the first two frames are sent in 2 ms. So the number of frames that can't be sent is 25 - 2 = 23, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe the frames are sent in chunks of 2 ms, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of frames that can't be sent because the network is 1000 meters away, and the 2 ms is the time for the signal to reach the first frame. So the number of frames that can't be sent is (2 ms) / (time per frame) * (number of bits per frame). But time per frame is 8 seconds, so 2 ms is 0.002 s. So 0.002 s / 8 s = 0.00025. Multiply by 8000 bits, gives 0.00025 * 8000 = 2 bits. So 2 bits can't be sent, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of frames that can't be sent in the 2 ms period because each frame takes 8 seconds. So the number of frames that can't be sent is 2 ms / (8 seconds) = 0.25 frames. Multiply by 8000 bits per frame, gives 2000 bits. So 2000 bits can't be sent in 2 ms. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let's recalculate:

Each frame is 8000 bits.

Data rate is 1 Gbps = 1e9 bits per second.

Time per frame is 8000 bits / 1e9 bits/sec = 0.008 seconds, which is 8 milliseconds, not 8 seconds. Oh, that's a mistake I made earlier. So the time per frame is 8 milliseconds, not 8 seconds. That changes everything.

So the data transfer rate is 1 Gbps = 1e9 bits per second. Each frame is 8000 bits. So the number of frames per second is 1e9 /8000 = 12500 frames per second.

So in 2 milliseconds, the number of frames sent is 12500 * 0.002 = 25 frames.

So 25 frames are sent in 2 milliseconds. So the number of frames that can't be sent is 25 frames.

But the options are 750, 500, 250, 100, 60, 20, 10, 5, 3, 2.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the time per frame is 8 milliseconds, not 8 seconds. So the data transfer rate is 1 Gbps = 1e9 bits per second. Each frame is 8,000 bits.

So the number of frames per second is 1e9 /8e3 = 1e9 / 8e3 = 1e6 /8 = 125,000 frames per second.

So in 2 milliseconds, the number of frames sent is 125,000 * 2e-3 = 250 frames.

Ah! So 250 frames. So the answer is 250 frames, which is option C.

So I must have made a mistake earlier by calculating the time per frame as 8 seconds. Let me correct that.

So the time per frame is 8 milliseconds, not 8 seconds.

So data transfer rate is 1 Gbps = 1e9 bits per second.

Each frame is 8000 bits.

Number of frames per second: 1e9 / 8000 = 1e9 /8e3 = 1e6 /8 = 125,000 frames per second.

In 2 milliseconds, 125,000 * 0.002 = 250 frames.

So the number of frames that can't be sent is 250 frames.

So the correct answer is 250 frames, which is option C.

The question involves calculating the number of frames that can't be sent during a 2 ms noise period in a Gigabit Ethernet network. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Frame Size and Transmission Time**:
   - Each frame is 1000 bytes, which is 8000 bits.
   - The data transfer rate is 1 Gbps (1000 million bits per second), or 1000,000,000 bits per second.
   - The time per frame is calculated as 8000 bits / 1000,000,000 bits/sec = 0.008 seconds (8 milliseconds), not 8 seconds.

2. **Frames per Second**:
   - Number of frames per second = 1000,000,000 bits/sec / 8000 bits/frame = 125,000 frames/sec.

3. **Frames Sent in 2 ms**:
   - In 2 ms, the number of frames sent = 125,000 frames/sec * 0.002 s = 250 frames.

4. **Frames That Can't Be Sent**:
   - Since 250 frames are sent during the 2 ms noise, these are the frames that can't be sent because they were transmitted before the noise.

**Answer**: 250 frames, which is option C.
