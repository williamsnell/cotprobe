Question:

Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length. The tension in the string is increased until a new set of standing waves is produced. Will the wavelength of the new standing waves be greater than or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves?

Options:

A: The wavelength will be greater, because the tension in the string varies inversely with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.
B: Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.
C: The wavelength cannot be determined without more information about the properties of the string and the wave generator.
D: Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.
E: Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.
F: Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.
G: The wavelength will be less, because the tension in the string varies inversely with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.
H: The wavelength will be greater, because the increased tension in the string will cause an increase in the wave speed, resulting in a longer wavelength.
I: The wavelength will remain the same, because the tension in the string does not affect the wavelength.
J: The wavelength will be less, because the increased tension in the string will cause a decrease in the wave speed, resulting in a shorter wavelength.

Alright, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about standing waves and how changing the tension affects the wavelength. Hmm, I remember that standing waves are produced when two waves interfere with each other, right? So, the key here is the wave speed and how that relates to the wavelength.

Okay, the setup is a 100-Hz generator producing standing waves on a string. Tension is increased to a new situation, and we need to figure out if the wavelength increases, decreases, or stays the same.

I think the main formula here is the relationship between wave speed, tension, and linear mass density. Oh right, the formula is v = sqrt(T/μ), where v is the wave speed, T is tension, and μ is linear mass density. So, if the tension increases, what happens to the wave speed? It should increase because if T goes up, the square root goes up. So v increases.

Now, how does wave speed relate to wavelength? Oh, right, the relationship is v = λ * f. Because wave speed equals wavelength multiplied by frequency. So if v increases, and assuming the frequency f stays the same (since the generator's frequency hasn't changed), then λ must increase as well. Because to get a higher v, either λ or f has to go up. Since f is fixed, λ must be larger.

Wait, but wait. The question says the frequency is 100 Hz, and when the tension is increased, the frequency remains the same. So f doesn't change. So v must increase because T has increased. So v = λ * f. If f is the same, λ = v/f. So if v increases, λ increases.

So the new wavelength will be longer than before. So the wavelength is greater.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones match my reasoning.

Option A: Wavelength greater because tension varies inversely with wave speed, which varies inversely with wavelength. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that. So, v is inversely proportional to wavelength because v = λ f. So if v increases, wavelength must increase. But why does tension vary inversely with wave speed? Oh wait, tension is in the numerator of v's formula. So tension increases, v increases. So when tension increases, v increases, which leads to longer wavelength. So option A's reasoning: tension (T) varies inversely with wave speed (v) because v = sqrt(T/mu), and mu is probably constant if the string's tension is the only thing changing. Wait, the question says tension is increased, so perhaps mu is fixed as well. So if mu isn't changing, then T and v are directly proportional. But if both T and mu are changing, maybe it's more about the product.

Wait, but the question is about when the tension is increased. So let's assume the linear mass density (mu) remains the same. So then T increases, so v increases. Then, since v = λ f, and f is the same, λ must increase.

So looking at the options, the options that relate to wavelength increasing are options B, D, E, F, I, J.

Option E says: "Less, because tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength." Wait, that can't be right because if tension increases (v increases), and v = λ f, and f remains same, so λ must increase. So E's reasoning is wrong.

Option I: Wavelength greater because tension increases causing a higher wave speed, longer wavelength. That fits. So option I is correct.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option I: The wavelength will be greater, because tension increases (v increases), which causes the wavelength to increase. So yes, that's correct.

Other options: Option H says tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies directly with wavelength. That can't be right because if T increases, v increases (so if my reasoning is correct, and if the product of T and mu is what affects v, then when T increases, v increases, which increases lambda). So H is wrong.

Option B: Less, because tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies directly with wavelength. No, that's wrong. Because T increasing leads to v increasing, which leads to lambda increasing. So B is incorrect.

Option D: Greater, because tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies inversely with wavelength. No, because that would make v increase, which would cause lambda to increase. So D's wording is wrong.

Option F: Greater, because tension varies directly with wave speed, which varies inversely with wavelength. No, because if T increases, v increases, which makes lambda increase, so inversely with wavelength (since if v increases, lambda decreases). So F is wrong.

Option G: Wavelength less, because T varies inversely with v, which varies directly with wavelength. No, that would mean as T increases, v decreases, which would mean lambda decreases. Contradicts our reasoning.

Option C: Can't determine without more info. No, we can determine it because the key variables are T increasing, which affects v, which affects λ.

Option E: Less, because T increases, wave speed increases, and lambda is longer. No, no, because the reasoning is v increases, so lambda increases. So E is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option I. Or wait, looking again, wait the options:

Option I: The wavelength will be greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if wave speed v = λ f. If v increases, λ increases. So the reasoning in the option is that v varies directly with λ (since v = λ f). But that's not correct. Because if v increases, and f is the same, λ must increase.

Wait, the option says: "the tension in the string varies directly with wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength." So, tension increases → v increases → v and λ are inversely related (since v = λ f → λ = v/f). So when v increases, λ increases. So the option is correct in that the reasoning is that v increases, causing λ to increase. So the conclusion is that the wavelength is greater, so option I is correct.

Wait, looking at the options again, option I says that the wavelength is greater because tension increases, causing higher wave speed, which leads to longer wavelength. That makes sense. So yes, option I is the correct answer.

To determine whether the wavelength of the new standing waves increases or decreases when the tension in the string is increased, we analyze the relationship between wave speed, tension, and wavelength. The key formulas are:

1. **Wave speed**: \( v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \), where \( T \) is tension and \( \mu \) is the linear mass density.
2. **Wave speed and wavelength relationship**: \( v = \lambda f \), where \( \lambda \) is wavelength and \( f \) is frequency.

When the tension \( T \) is increased while the frequency \( f \) remains constant, the wave speed \( v \) increases because \( v \propto \sqrt{T} \). Substituting \( v = \lambda f \) into this, we find that \( \lambda \propto v \), meaning the wavelength increases as \( v \) increases.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The reasoning provided is flawed. The wavelength increases, not decreases, because \( v \) increases.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The reasoning is incorrect. Tension increases, not decreases, and \( v \) increases.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While more information is needed, we can determine the wavelength change based on the given relationships.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The reasoning is incorrect. Tension increases, not decreases, and \( v \) increases.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The reasoning is incorrect. \( v \) increases, not decreases, and \( \lambda \) increases.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The reasoning is incorrect. \( v \) increases, not decreases, and \( \lambda \) increases.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The reasoning is incorrect. \( v \) increases, not decreases, and \( \lambda \) increases.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The reasoning is incorrect. \( v \) increases, not decreases, and \( \lambda \) increases.
- **Option I**: Correct. The reasoning is accurate. Tension increases, causing \( v \) to increase, which results in a longer wavelength.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The reasoning is incorrect. \( v \) increases, not decreases, and \( \lambda \) increases.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The reasoning is incorrect. \( v \) increases, not decreases, and \( \lambda \) increases.

### Conclusion:
The wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater than the original wavelength because increasing tension leads to an increase in wave speed, which results in a longer wavelength.
