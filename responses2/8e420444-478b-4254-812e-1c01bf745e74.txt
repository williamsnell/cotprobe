Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about finding the mass of an object when a force is applied and an acceleration is measured. Hmm, I remember from my classes that there's a formula related to force, mass, and acceleration. Oh right, Newton's second law of motion.

Newton's second law is F equals mass times acceleration, right? So, F = ma. I think I should be using that to find the mass. Wait, but wait, the units here are in dynes and centimeters per second squared. I should make sure about the units because sometimes they mix up different units.

Wait, I've heard that in cgs units (centimeters, grams, seconds), the unit of force is the dyne. And the acceleration is in cm/s². But wait, in SI units, the force would be in Newtons, and acceleration in m/s². Oh but here, since the question gives the force in dynes and acceleration in cm/s², I think the formula should work as long as I'm consistent with the units. Or maybe I need to convert them somehow.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the units. Let me think again. The formula F = ma is correct. Here, F is in dynes, m is in grams, and a is in cm/s². So, if I plug in the numbers, F is 2000 dynes, a is 500 cm/s², and m is what I'm solving for.

Wait, that would be m = F / a. So, 2000 divided by 500. Let me compute that. 2000 / 500 equals 4. So, m is 4 grams. Wait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake here because sometimes when using different units, the conversion factors can come into play. Oh, wait, no, wait. Because in the cgs system, 1 gm is 1 gram, 1 cm is 1 centimeter, and 1 s is 1 second. So, the units match up. So, the formula F = ma is applicable here, and the units are compatible.

So, when I calculate m = F / a, and F is 2000 dynes, a is 500 cm/s², then m should be 4 grams. Looking at the options, option F is 4 gm. So, that's the answer.

To determine the mass of the object, we use Newton's second law of motion, \( F = ma \), where \( F \) is force, \( m \) is mass, and \( a \) is acceleration. Rearranging the formula to solve for mass: \( m = \frac{F}{a} \).

Given:
- Force (\( F \)) = 2000 dynes
- Acceleration (\( a \)) = 500 cm/s²

Plugging in the values:
\[
m = \frac{2000 \text{ dynes}}{500 \text{ cm/s}^2} = 4 \text{ grams}
\]

The correct option is **F: 4 gm**.

Answer: F
