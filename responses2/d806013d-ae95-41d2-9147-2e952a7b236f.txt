Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive isotopes. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows first-order kinetics, so the number of atoms over time depends on the half-life. The problem says there are two isotopes, A and B. A's half-life is 3 days, and B's is 6 days. Initially, there are twice as many A atoms as B. The question is, when will the ratio of A to B be reversed? Oh wait, reversed ratio—like, when the number of B atoms becomes larger than A again. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the initial number of A atoms as 2N and B as N. So, A_initial = 2N, B_initial = N. 

The number of atoms for each isotope over time can be described by the formula N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / half-life).

So for A: N_A(t) = 2N * (1/2)^(t/3)
For B: N_B(t) = N * (1/2)^(t/6)

I need to find the time t when the ratio N_A(t)/N_B(t) is equal to its initial ratio, but wait, the initial ratio was 2:1. So when is that ratio reversed? Wait, perhaps the question is asking when the ratio of A to B becomes 1 again. Because initially, A is twice as much, and we're looking for when it becomes 1 (so A and B are equal), but wait no, because the ratio being reversed might mean the ratio flips. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, the problem says, "the ratio of the number of atoms of A to B will be reversed." So initially, the ratio A:B is 2:1. So reversed would mean 1:2. So when N_A(t)/N_B(t) becomes 1/2, because that's the opposite of 2. So that's when A is half of B. So when N_A(t)/N_B(t) = 0.5.

Wait, or perhaps the problem is about when the ratio is reversed in terms of which is bigger. So initially, A is bigger. We're looking for when A is smaller than B again, but their ratio is 1:2. So N_A(t) = (1/2) N_B(t).

So set up the equation:

(2N) * (1/2)^(t/3) ) / ( N * (1/2)^(t/6) ) ) = 0.5

Simplify this equation. Let's compute the ratio.

First, 2N / N is 2. So that's a factor outside. The exponents: (1/2)^(t/3) divided by (1/2)^(t/6) equals (1/2)^(t/3 - t/6) ) = (1/2)^(t/6). Because when you divide exponents with same base, you subtract the exponents.

Wait, wait, let's correct that. The division of two exponents with same base (like 1/2) would be (1/2)^(a - b), where a is t/3 and b is t/6.

So, exponent is (t/3 - t/6) = (2t/6 - t/6) = t/6.

So the ratio becomes:

2 * (1/2)^(t/6) = 0.5.

So, 2 * (1/2)^(t/6) = 1/2.

We can write this as (1/2)^(t/6) = (1/2) / 2 = 1/4.

Because 2*(1/2)^(t/6) = 0.5 → (1/2)^(t/6) = 0.5 / 2 = 0.25, which is 1/4.

So (1/2)^(t/6) = (1/2)^2.

Since the bases are same, exponents must be equal.

t/6 = 2 → t = 12 days.

Wait, wait, but the options don't have 12. Let me check the options again. The options are A through J, numbers like 15, 18, 12, etc.

Wait, option C is 12.0. So that's the answer. So the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay of isotopes A and B, where A has a half-life of 3 days and B has a half-life of 6 days. Initially, there are twice as many atoms of A as B. We need to determine the time when the ratio of the number of atoms of A to B is reversed, meaning A becomes half the number of B.

Let the initial number of A atoms be \( 2N \) and B atoms be \( N \). The number of atoms over time is given by:

\[
N_A(t) = 2N \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/3}, \quad N_B(t) = N \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6}.
\]

The ratio \( \frac{N_A(t)}{N_B(t)} \) is:

\[
\frac{N_A(t)}{N_B(t)} = \frac{2N \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/3}}{N \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6}} = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6}.
\]

We seek the time \( t \) when this ratio equals 0.5 (reversing the ratio from 2:1 to 1:2):

\[
2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6} = 0.5.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6} = \frac{0.5}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2.
\]

Equating the exponents:

\[
\frac{t}{6} = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 12 \, \text{days}.
\]

Thus, the time when the ratio of A to B is reversed is 12 days. Among the options, the correct answer is:
