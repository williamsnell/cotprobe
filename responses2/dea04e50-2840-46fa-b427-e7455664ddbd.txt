Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spinning sphere and applying a friction force to bring it to rest. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on rotational dynamics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

So the sphere has a moment of inertia I = 0.06 kg·m². Initially, it's spinning with angular speed ω = 20 rad/s. The goal is to bring it to rest by applying a frictional force of 2.0 N at a distance of 0.30 m from the center. I need to find the time it takes for the sphere to stop.

Wait, I remember that torque is involved here. Torque relates to angular acceleration. But wait, friction is a bit tricky because it's a force, so I think torque is force multiplied by the radius (distance from the axis). Oh right, because torque τ = r × F, and since it's perpendicular, it's just τ = F * r.

So the frictional force is 2.0 N, and the radius is 0.30 m. So τ = 2.0 N * 0.30 m = 0.6 N·m.

Now, using Newton's second law for rotation, torque equals moment of inertia times angular acceleration (τ = I * α). But wait, since the sphere is slowing down, the angular acceleration will be negative (deceleration). So α = τ / I. Let me compute that.

I is 0.06 kg·m². So α = 0.6 / 0.06 = 10 rad/s². But since it's slowing, α is negative, so α = -10 rad/s².

Wait, but actually, the torque might be causing deceleration. So the angular acceleration is in the opposite direction. But for the purposes of magnitude, I can just take the absolute value.

The sphere is coming to rest, so the angular acceleration is negative. So α = -10 rad/s².

Now, angular velocity as a function of time is ω(t) = ω_0 + α * t. We need ω(t) = 0.

So 0 = 20 + (-10)*t → 20 = 10 t → t = 2 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that the only factor here? Because the sphere is also rotating, and torque is causing a deceleration. But wait, when you apply a torque, the angular deceleration is directly influenced by the torque and the moment of inertia. So the earlier calculation should hold.

Wait, but I feel like I might be missing something about the friction. Maybe the friction force is causing a torque that opposes the motion, which is what we accounted for. So the calculation should be straightforward.

So the time is 2 seconds. Looking back at the options, option D is 2 s. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, let me double-check. Let's rederive:

Torque τ = F * r = 2.0 * 0.30 = 0.6 N·m.

Moment of inertia I = 0.06 kg·m².

Torque = I * α → α = τ/I = 0.6 / 0.06 = 10 rad/s². But since the torque opposes the rotation, α is negative → α = -10.

Initial ω = 20 rad/s. Final ω = 0.

So 0 = 20 + (-10) t → t = 2 s. That's correct.

To determine the time it takes for the sphere to come to rest, we analyze the rotational dynamics. The sphere has a moment of inertia \( I = 0.06 \, \text{kg·m}^2 \) and an initial angular speed \( \omega_0 = 20 \, \text{rad/s} \). A frictional force \( F = 2.0 \, \text{N} \) is applied at a distance \( r = 0.30 \, \text{m} \) from the axis of rotation, resulting in a torque \( \tau = F \cdot r = 2.0 \cdot 0.30 = 0.6 \, \text{N·m} \).

Using Newton's second law for rotation, \( \tau = I \cdot \alpha \), where \( \alpha \) is the angular acceleration, we calculate:

\[
\alpha = \frac{\tau}{I} = \frac{0.6}{0.06} = 10 \, \text{rad/s}^2.
\]

Since the sphere is decelerating, the angular acceleration is negative: \( \alpha = -10 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \).

The angular velocity as a function of time is given by:

\[
\omega(t) = \omega_0 + \alpha \cdot t.
\]

To come to rest (\( \omega(t) = 0 \)), we solve:

\[
0 = 20 + (-10) \cdot t \implies t = 2 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Thus, the time it takes for the sphere to come to rest is \( 2 \, \text{s} \), corresponding to option D.
