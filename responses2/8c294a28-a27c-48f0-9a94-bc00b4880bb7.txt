Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychological testing reports and ethics. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking what a psychologist is ethically bound to include in their report. The options are from A to I, with F and H being about potential pathologies and data inclusion respectively.

First, I remember that psychological testing reports are a part of a therapeutic process. The key here is the ethical standards. The report should protect the client's rights. So, including personal opinions or assumptions seems unethical because it could infringe on their autonomy.

Option B says the preferred treatment plan. That sounds ethical because it's about the client's best interests, not their personal beliefs. But wait, I think there's more to it. The report should be based on objective data, not subjective opinions.

Option C talks about data interpretations and limiting circumstances. That makes sense because the report should explain the data and any constraints in the testing process, ensuring objectivity.

Option D says only results supporting the initial hypothesis. That's not correct because it ignores other findings, which are just as important. You can't base the report solely on what fits your hypothesis.

Option E includes positive results and findings. While this is good, it's too restrictive. It doesn't cover all findings or consider the limitations of the test.

Option F is about pathologies. That's unethical because it could lead to potential health issues. The report should focus on measurable outcomes and not speculate too much about the client's condition.

Option G is a detailed history of past evaluations. Including this could add unnecessary weight, especially if the test hasn't been done yet. It's better to focus on the current data.

Option H says only data with independent evidence. That's not accurate because the report needs to include findings that can be corroborated by other tests. Without this, it's risky.

Option I is about data relevant to the case, which is too vague. It doesn't specify what needs to be included.

So, putting it all together, the report must be ethical. It should include objective data, interpretations, and limiting circumstances. So the correct answer is C.

The correct answer is **C: interpretations of the data and limiting circumstances involving the test administration**. This is because psychological testing reports should be ethically conducted, focusing on objective data, interpretations, and contextual information to protect the client's autonomy and ensure objectivity.

Answer: C
