Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron accelerated through a potential difference and finding its final speed. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the potential difference Δϕ is 100 kV. Oh wait, 100 kV is 100,000 volts. Right. The electron is accelerated from rest, so its initial speed is zero. And it gains energy equal to eΔϕ. Oh, right, because when a charge moves through a potential difference, the work done on it is eΔϕ, which equals its kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy here is K = eΔϕ.

Wait, but I think I should double-check that. The formula for kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But the energy here is eΔϕ. So setting them equal: (1/2)mv² = eΔϕ. Since the electron is the one, its mass is the electron mass m_e, and e is the elementary charge.

So I need to solve for v. Let me write down the equation:

(1/2) m_e v² = e Δϕ.

I can solve for v by rearranging:

v = sqrt( (2 e Δϕ) / m_e )

I remember that e is 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, m_e is 9.109 x 10^-31 kilograms, and Δϕ is 100,000 volts. Wait, but wait a second, that's the potential difference, so the energy is e times that. So plugging in the numbers:

But wait, let me compute the right-hand side step by step.

First, compute 2 e Δϕ. So 2 * 1.602e-19 C * 1e5 V.

Wait, 1e5 is 100,000. Let me compute 2 * 1.602e-19 * 1e5.

2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19. Multiply by 1e5: 3.204e-19 *1e5 = 3.204e-14.

So numerator is 3.204e-14 J.

Denominator is m_e, which is 9.109e-31 kg.

So v² = (3.204e-14) / (9.109e-31) ≈ ?

Let me calculate that division.

Wait, 3.204e-14 divided by 9.109e-31.

3.204e-14 / 9.109e-31 = (3.204 /9.109) * 1e17.

3.204 /9.109 is approximately 0.351.

So 0.351e17 = 3.51e16.

So v² = 3.51e16 m²/s².

Taking square root: v = sqrt(3.51e16) = sqrt(3.51) * 1e8.

What is sqrt(3.51)? Well, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, and sqrt(3.51) is a bit higher. Let's compute 1.874^2. (1.875)^2 is 3.515625, so 1.874 squared is 3.51. So sqrt(3.51) ≈ 1.874.

So v ≈ 1.874e8 m/s. Wait, but wait, looking at the options.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.88e8. That matches. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait—did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check the calculation again. Oh wait, wait a second, the electron's charge is e, which is 1.602e-19 C. Potential difference is 100,000 V, which I multiplied correctly.

Wait, 2 e Δϕ: 2 * 1.602e-19 * 1e5 = 3.204e-14 J. That's correct.

Divide by m_e: 9.109e-31 kg. So 3.204e-14 / 9.109e-31 equals approximately 3.51e16 (as before). Square root is 1.874e8 m/s, which is about 1.87e8 m/s. So option H is 1.88e8, which is the closest. So that's the answer.

To determine the final speed of an electron accelerated through a potential difference of Δϕ = 100 kV, we use the relationship between energy and kinetic energy. The energy gained by the electron is given by:

\[
K = e \Delta \phi
\]

where \( e \) is the elementary charge (\( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \)) and \( \Delta \phi \) is the potential difference (\( 100,000 \, \mathrm{V} \)). The kinetic energy is also expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( K \), we solve for the final speed \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = e \Delta \phi
\]

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 e \Delta \phi}{m_e}}
\]

Substituting the known values:
- \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (electron mass),
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \),
- \( \Delta \phi = 100,000 \, \mathrm{V} \),

we calculate:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 (1.602 \times 10^{-19}) (100,000)}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}}
\]

First, compute the numerator:

\[
2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \times 100,000 = 3.204 \times 10^{-14} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Then, divide by the electron mass:

\[
\frac{3.204 \times 10^{-14}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}} \approx 3.51 \times 10^{16} \, \mathrm{m^2/s^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v \approx \sqrt{3.51 \times 10^{16}} \approx 1.874 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s}
\]

This value is closest to option **H (1.88 × 10⁸ m/s)**. Therefore, the final speed of the electron is:
