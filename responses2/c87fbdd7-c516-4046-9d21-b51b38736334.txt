Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the problem is about titration. Great, I remember that titration involves reacting acids with bases. The question says that a 50 ml solution of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) contains 0.490 grams of H2SO4. Then, this acid solution is titrated against a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution of unknown concentration. The titration uses 12.5 ml of the acid to neutralize 20.0 ml of the base. I need to find the concentration of the NaOH solution. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, let's think about the steps involved. First, I probably need to find out the concentration of sulfuric acid, which I can then use in the stoichiometric calculation with the NaOH to find its concentration.

Wait, sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. Oh right, that's because it can donate two protons. So, each mole of H2SO4 can provide two moles of H+ ions. But wait, when it reacts with NaOH, which is a strong base, it's a 1:1 reaction. So the neutralization would be H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O. Or wait, is it 1 mole of H2SO4 reacting with 2 moles of NaOH? Let me think. 

The reaction is H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O. Yes, that's correct. So one mole of H2SO4 reacts with two moles of NaOH. 

Wait, but first step: find the concentration of H2SO4 in the solution. The solution is 50 ml, and it has 0.490 grams of H2SO4.

Molar mass of H2SO4: H is about 1, S is 32, O is 16. So H2SO4 is (2*1) + 32 + (4*16) = 2 +32 +64=98 g/mol.

So moles of H2SO4 = mass / molar mass = 0.490 g / 98 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.490 divided by 98 is 0.005 moles. Oh wait, 98 * 0.005 is 0.49. So 0.005 moles.

Now, the volume is 50 ml, which is 0.05 liters. So the concentration of H2SO4 is moles/volume. So 0.005 mol / 0.05 L = 0.1 M. Wait, that's 0.1 M H2SO4.

But wait, when it reacts with NaOH, the H2SO4 is providing 2 H+ ions per molecule. So when it's neutralized, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with two moles of NaOH. So the moles of NaOH needed will be twice the moles of H2SO4.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is 1 mole H2SO4 → 2 moles NaOH because each H2SO4 provides two H+ ions, which react with two NaOH (each NaOH provides one OH-). So the mole ratio is 1:2.

So moles of H2SO4 = 0.005 mol. So moles of NaOH required = 0.005 * 2 = 0.01 mol.

But wait, how much NaOH was used? The volume used was 12.5 ml. So the concentration of NaOH is moles/volume. Moles of NaOH is 0.01, volume is 0.0125 L (since 12.5 ml is 0.0125 L).

So concentration = 0.01 mol / 0.0125 L = 0.8 M.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, none seem to have 0.8 M. Hmm, let me check.

The options are A:0.125, B:0.088, C:0.225, D:0.250, E:0.160, F:0.200, G:0.175, H:0.150, I:0.098, J:0.300.

Wait, none of these are 0.8 M. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake with the moles. Let's go back.

Wait, the sulfuric acid is H2SO4. So each mole provides 2 H+ ions. So when it reacts with NaOH, which provides 1 OH-, each H+ reacts with an OH-.

So 1 mole of H2SO4 needs 2 moles of NaOH.

So moles of NaOH = 2 * moles of H2SO4. So moles of H2SO4 is 0.005 mol. So NaOH is 0.01 mol.

Volume of NaOH used is 12.5 mL, which is 0.0125 L.

So concentration is 0.01 / 0.0125 = 0.8 M. But that's 0.8 M. None of the options are that. Hmm.

Wait the options don't have 0.8. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait another thought: maybe I didn't account for the dilution correctly. Oh wait, no, because the 12.5 mL is the volume of NaOH used in the titration. The question says 12.5 mL of the acid solution was used. Oh wait wait, no, wait. Wait the problem says: "12.5 ml of the acid solution was required to neutralize 20.0 ml of the base."

Wait, so in the titration, 12.5 mL of H2SO4 was used to neutralize 20.0 mL of NaOH.

Wait, wait a minute. Because the ratio is 1:2. So for every 1 mole of H2SO4, you need 2 moles of NaOH.

So moles of H2SO4 used in the titration is (12.5 mL / 50 mL) * 0.490 g.

Wait, because the concentration of the acid solution is 0.1 M. Wait, earlier, I calculated the concentration of H2SO4 as 0.1 M. But wait, wait no: the concentration of the acid solution is 0.1 M? Or was it 0.1 M?

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, I thought the concentration of H2SO4 is 0.1 M. Let me recheck that.

The problem states that the acid solution is 50 mL, contains 0.490 g H2SO4. So first, calculate the moles.

Molar mass of H2SO4 is 98 g/mol. So 0.490 g / 98 g/mol = 0.005 mol. 0.005 mol in 0.050 L (50 mL) means 0.1 M. So yes, 0.1 M H2SO4.

So when you titrate 12.5 mL of this 0.1 M H2SO4 to find out how much NaOH is needed, let's compute that.

The moles of H2SO4 in 12.5 mL is 0.1 M * 0.0125 L = 0.00125 mol. Since each mole of H2SO4 requires 2 moles of NaOH, then you need 0.00125 * 2 = 0.0025 mol NaOH.

The volume of NaOH used is 20.0 mL, which is 0.020 L. So the concentration of NaOH is 0.0025 mol / 0.020 L = 0.125 M.

Oh wait, 0.125 M is option A.

But wait, wait, let me make sure. Let's step through it again.

1. Calculate moles of H2SO4 in 50 mL:

0.490 g / 98 g/mol = 0.005 mol.

2. Concentration of H2SO4: 0.005 mol / 0.050 L = 0.1 M.

3. Now, in the titration, 12.5 mL of 0.1 M H2SO4 is used. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.1 M * 0.0125 L = 0.00125 mol.

4. Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed: 0.00125 * 2 = 0.0025 mol.

5. Volume of NaOH used is 20.0 mL = 0.020 L.

6. Concentration of NaOH: 0.0025 mol / 0.020 L = 0.125 M.

So option A is 0.125 M. But looking at the options, A is 0.125. So the correct answer would be option A.

To determine the concentration of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, we start by analyzing the given data and applying stoichiometric principles.

1. **Calculate the moles of H₂SO₄ in the 50 mL solution:**
   - The molar mass of H₂SO₄ is 98 g/mol.
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = mass / molar mass = 0.490 g / 98 g/mol = 0.005 mol.

2. **Determine the concentration of H₂SO₄:**
   - The solution volume is 50 mL (0.050 L).
   - Concentration of H₂SO₄ = moles / volume = 0.005 mol / 0.050 L = 0.1 M.

3. **Relate the moles of H₂SO₄ to the moles of NaOH:**
   - The reaction between H₂SO₄ and NaOH is:  
     \[
     \text{H₂SO₄ + 2 NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2 H₂O}
     \]
   - From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH.
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ used in the titration = (12.5 mL / 50 mL) * 0.005 mol = 0.00125 mol.
   - Moles of NaOH required = 2 * moles of H₂SO₄ = 2 * 0.00125 mol = 0.0025 mol.

4. **Calculate the concentration of NaOH:**
   - The volume of NaOH used is 20.0 mL (0.020 L).
   - Concentration of NaOH = moles / volume = 0.0025 mol / 0.020 L = 0.125 M.

Thus, the concentration of the NaOH solution is **0.125 M**, which corresponds to option A.
