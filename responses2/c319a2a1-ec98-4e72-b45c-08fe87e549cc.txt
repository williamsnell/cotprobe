Question:

Cobb Inc.'s inventory at May 1 consisted of 200 units at a total cost of $1250. Cobb uses the periodic inventory method. Purchases for the month were as follows: Date No. of Units Unit cost Total Cost May 4 20 $5.80 $116.00 May 17 80 $5.50 $440.00 Cobb sold 10 units on May 14 for $120. What is Cobb's weighted average cost of goods sold for May?

Options:

A: $60.20
B: $58.10
C: $63.50
D: 65
E: $61.20
F: $64.00
G: $62.50
H: $67.50
I: $66.20
J: $62.10

Okay, so I have this question about Cobb Inc.'s inventory and weighted average cost of goods sold. Hmm, let's see what I can do. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

Alright, the problem says that on May 1, Cobb Inc. had 200 units in inventory costing $1250. So the beginning inventory is 200 units at $6.25 each because 1250 divided by 200 is $6.25. Wait, waitâ€”no, 1250 divided by 200 is actually 6.25, right? So each unit was $6.25.

Then, purchases for the month were on May 4 and May 17. On May 4, they bought 20 units at $5.80 each. Let me calculate the total cost: 20 * 5.80 = $116.00. On May 17, they bought 80 units at $5.50 each. So 80 * 5.50 is $440.00. 

So total cost of purchases is 116 + 440 = $556.00. The total units purchased are 20 + 80 = 100 units. 

Now, the next part is about the sale. On May 14, they sold 10 units. The question is asking for the weighted average cost of goods sold for May. Oh wait, but wait, do I need to calculate the cost of the goods sold, or the average cost per unit? Because the period method typically uses the average cost to calculate the cost of goods sold and ending inventory.

Wait, but the question specifically says "weighted average cost of goods sold for May." Hmm, maybe I should think about which method to use. The periodic inventory method typically uses either FIFO, LIFO, or weighted average. Since the question refers to the "weighted average cost," I think they are asking for the weighted average cost of the goods sold.

Wait, but wait, how is the goods sold calculated? Because the initial inventory is 200 units at $6.25 each. Then they purchased 100 units (20 +80) at varying prices. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. If they bought 20 May 4 and 80 May 17, that's 100 units. So the total inventory after purchases is 200 + 100 = 300 units. 

Wait, but the problem says the period method, so the cost of goods sold is based on the average cost of all units available for sale during the period.

So, the total cost of all units is the beginning inventory plus purchases. The beginning inventory was 200 units at $6.25, so that's $1250. The May 4 purchase is 20 units at $5.80, which is $116, and May 17 is 80 units at $5.50, which is $440. So total cost is 1250 + 116 + 440 = 1250 + 556 = $1806. 

The total units available for sale are 200 + 20 + 80 = 300 units. So the average cost per unit is total cost divided by total units. So 1806 / 300. Let me calculate that.

Dividing 1806 by 300: Well, 300 * 6 is 1800, so 1806 / 300 = 6.02. So the average cost per unit is $6.02. 

Now, since they sold 10 units on May 14, the cost of goods sold is 10 * 6.02 = $60.20. So the answer should be option A, $60.20. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The initial inventory was 200 units at $6.25, then they added 100 units (20+80). So total is 300 units. 

Wait, but I just did the average cost correctly. So 1806 / 300 is 6.02. Multiply by 10 units sold: 10 *6.02 = 60.20. Yes, so option A is correct.

To determine Cobb Inc.'s weighted average cost of goods sold for May, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of goods available for sale:**
   - **Beginning inventory:** 200 units at $6.25 = $1250.
   - **May 4 purchase:** 20 units at $5.80 = $116.
   - **May 17 purchase:** 80 units at $5.50 = $440.
   - **Total cost:** $1250 + $116 + $440 = $1806.

2. **Determine the total number of units available for sale:**
   - **Beginning inventory:** 200 units.
   - **May 4 purchase:** 20 units.
   - **May 17 purchase:** 80 units.
   - **Total units:** 200 + 20 + 80 = 300 units.

3. **Calculate the weighted average cost per unit:**
   - **Total cost / Total units = $1806 / 300 = $6.02 per unit.**

4. **Calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS):**
   - **Units sold:** 10 units.
   - **COGS = Units sold * Weighted average cost per unit = 10 * $6.02 = $60.20.**

The correct answer is **$60.20**.
