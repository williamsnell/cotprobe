Okay, so I have this logic question here, and I need to figure out the correct symbolization of the sentence. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The sentence is: "If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier." 

Hmm, I remember that in logic, when we have a sentence of the form "If P, then Q," it's written as P → Q. So P is the antecedent, and Q is the consequent. 

In this case, the antecedent is "Beth rides her bike," which I'll probably represent with a letter. Let's see, the options are A through H. The sentence starts with "If Beth rides her bike," so maybe B is the letter for that. The consequent is "she gets to work earlier," which I'll represent with W. So the structure would be B → W. 

Looking at the options, option B is B ⊃ W. That seems right because it translates the English sentence into an implication. 

Wait, let me double-check the other options. Option A is W ∨ B, which is an OR statement, meaning either W or B is true. That doesn't seem right because the original sentence is about a conditional, not a disjunction. 

Option C is B ∨ W, same as A but with OR. No, that's not it. 

Option D is ¬B → W. So if Beth doesn't ride her bike, she gets to work earlier. That doesn't fit, because the original says if she rides her bike, then she works earlier. So the reverse isn't implied unless it's a biconditional. 

Option E is W → B. That would mean if she works earlier, she rode her bike. But the original says the converse. So that's not correct. 

Option F is ¬W → B. If she doesn't work earlier, then she didn't ride her bike. Again, the opposite implication is not implied. 

Option G is B ≡ ¬W. That's a biconditional, meaning Beth rides her bike iff she doesn't work earlier. That seems too strong and not what the original says. 

Option H is B ≡ W. That would mean they are equivalent, both happening at the same time, which doesn't fit the conditional structure. 

Option I is B & W, which is an AND statement, meaning both conditions are true. But the sentence doesn't state that both are true, just that if one, the other follows. 

So the only option that correctly captures the conditional structure is option B: B ⊃ W. That must be the right answer. I think I'm confident in that choice.

The correct symbolization is option B: B ⊃ W, which accurately represents the conditional relationship in the given sentence.

Answer: B
