Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the factors that contributed to the revival of natural law in the 20th century. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I remember that natural law is a concept from ancient philosophy, where laws are derived from reality and not human-made. In the 20th century, there was a lot of social and political change, so I'm guessing some of these factors might have played a role in reviving this idea.

Looking at the options, I see A to H. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The end of the Cold War. That sounds like a big deal. The Cold War ended in 1947, so maybe that led to more international cooperation. But does that directly relate to natural law? I'm not sure. I think natural law was more about philosophical foundations rather than just global cooperation, but maybe it did play a role in that cooperation.

Option B: The Bolshevik Revolution. That was in 1917, but that's in the early 20th century. The question is about the 20th century. So probably not the answer.

Option C: International recognition of human rights. Wait, natural law was more about the idea of laws being based on reality rather than human rights. So if human rights were recognized, that might have influenced how natural law was perceived. But I'm not sure how that directly caused the revival of natural law.

Option D: The invention of the Internet. That's a tech term, and I don't think it directly relates to natural law. The internet is more about information and communication, not necessarily the philosophical underpinnings of law.

Option E: The rise of Fascism. Fascism is more about authoritarianism and social repression. I don't think it would revitalize natural law, which is a more foundational concept.

Option F: The rise of Communism in China. Communism is a political system, and while it led to significant change, does it directly relate to natural law? I don't think so. Natural law was more about philosophy and ancient principles, not necessarily current political systems.

Option G: Depression of the 1930s. The depression was a social issue that led to increased social and political change. But does it have anything to do with natural law? Maybe it contributed to societal progress, but not directly to the revival.

Option H: The advent of the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution brought about industrialization and mass production, which might have led to changes in social and economic systems. But again, not directly to natural law.

Wait, so let me think again. The question is which factor significantly contributed to the revival. The 20th century saw a lot of major events. The end of the Cold War (A) was a big deal because it led to increased international cooperation and perhaps more open societies. I've heard that natural law was a foundational concept that was gaining more traction. Maybe the Cold War's end boosted international relations, leading to more open societies where natural law could be upheld.

Alternatively, the invention of the Internet (D) doesn't fit. The 1930s depression (G) and the rise of Communism (F) are more about social and political changes that might have influenced the political climate but not directly the revival of natural law.

So I think the correct answer is A, the end of the Cold War. It's because in the 20th century, there was a lot of international cooperation, leading to the establishment of more open societies. This allowed for the natural law to be reinterpreted and perhaps even reasserted in new contexts.

The correct answer is **A: The end of the Cold War**. The end of the Cold War in the 20th century led to increased international cooperation and a more open societal climate, which supported the revival of natural law by fostering a more open and cooperative society.
