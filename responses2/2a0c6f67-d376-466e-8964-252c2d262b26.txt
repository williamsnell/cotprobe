Okay, so I have this question here: "What percent is 131 of 42?" And I need to choose the correct percentage from the options given. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that to find what percentage a number is of another, I use the formula: (part/whole) * 100%. Here, the part is 131 and the whole is 42. So, plugging the numbers in, it would be (131/42) * 100%.

Wait, let me calculate that. 131 divided by 42. Hmm, 42 times 3 is 126, so 42*3=126. Subtract that from 131: 131-126=5. So 3 and 5/42. Wait, but that's just the division part. Let me calculate it more accurately.

5 divided by 42 is approximately 0.119047619. So adding that to 3 gives me about 3.119047619. Now, multiply by 100% to get the percentage. 3.119047619 * 100 â‰ˆ 311.9047619%.

Looking at the options, I see that option J is 311.9%, which is very close to my calculation. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine what percent 131 is of 42, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}}\right) \times 100\%
\]

Here:
- Part = 131
- Whole = 42

Calculating:
\[
\frac{131}{42} \approx 3.1190
\]
\[
3.1190 \times 100\% \approx 311.9\%
\]

Comparing with the options, the closest match is **J: 311.9%**.

Answer: J
