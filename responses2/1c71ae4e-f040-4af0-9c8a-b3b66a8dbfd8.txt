Question:

A woman inherited her father's farm when he died testate. Prior to her father's death, the woman had already taken over the operations on the father's farm due to his declining health. Recently, the woman had granted a coal company rights to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm. Their agreement stipulated that the coal company would pay the woman a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted. In addition, the coal company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace top soil on the surface of the land. After the coal company commenced its strip-mining operations, the woman noticed that the company was not filling in the excavated area as previously agreed. However, because the company paid the woman all the coal royalties from the strip mining, she did not voice any objection regarding its failure to replace the top soil. Two years later, the coal company had now completed its strip-mining operation under its arrangement with the woman. The coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property would be an example of a (an)

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question. Let's read through it carefully. 

The scenario is about a woman who inherited her father's farm and had already taken over the farm operations. She then granted a coal company a rights to extract coal from underneath the farm via royalty. But the company didn't fill in the area as the agreement said, yet she didn't object because she received all the royalties. Now, two years later, the company completed, and the question is about what the company's right to strip-mine coal would be an example of.

The options are various real estate terms. Let me try to recall each term and see which fits.

First, I'll list the options:

A: Constructive trust
B: easement appurtenant
C: servient estate
D: voluntary waste
E: license
F: easement in gross
G: tenancy in common
H: profit-a-prendre (which I think is wrong, maybe a typo)
I: adverse possession
J: easement by necessity

Let me think about each term.

A Constructive Trust: This is when a person creates a trust with another, with the intent to transfer certain property to the grantee, like a will. It's a type of estate, but I'm not sure how it fits here.

Easement Appurtenant: This is an easement that is in direct possession of the owner. Like the land grants a easement to a person who's already on the land, so they can use it. It's attached to the land, not in the way of it.

Servient Estate: This is a type of estate where the grantor has a duty to perform on behalf of the grantee. It's more about the estate's role in the grant, like a grantee's estate, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Voluntary Waste: This is when the grantor doesn't have the intention to exercise the right, but does so anyway. It's a type of waste. But here, she had the right to extract and the company didn't fill in, but she didn't object. So she might have intended to do it, but it wasn't done. So it's a voluntary waste. But wait, the question is about her right to strip-mine, so the grantor's right to do it.

Wait, but the question is about the company's right to extract coal. So the company's right was granted. So the issue is whether the company's right is a type of estate or a different concept.

Easement in gross: This is a type of easement that's on the land without any attached property. The grantor has the right to use the land, and the grantee uses it. It's a type of easement.

Profit-a-prendre: I think this is a more modern term, meaning "profit and a prendre," which is a type of estate. It's a form of alienation of property where the owner grants the right to use the land with the expectation of profit.

Easement by necessity: This is when a feature of land is essential to the survival of a particular organism, so the owner has a right to use it. Like a river that flows through a forest because it's necessary for the forest's survival.

Now, going back to the question. The woman granted the coal company a right to extract coal, which is a royalty. But the company didn't dig the hole, but she didn't get any notice, so she didn't object. So she intended to fill in the area, but didn't. However, she received all the royalties.

So the question is about the company's right to extract coal. So the company's right is a type of estate. But wait, the company's right is a right to extract, which is a type of right granted to the person who owns the land. So for the company to have the right, it must be attached to the land or something. 

Wait, when the woman granted the company a rights, she must have attached it to her ownership. So as a grantor, she has the right to extract, and it's her property. But perhaps the company's rights are in a different state.

Wait, the company's right to strip-mine would be a right of the grantee, but if the grantee didn't perform, but she didn't object, that's a voluntary waste. But the question is about the company's right, not the woman's. So the company's right is what's being asked.

Wait, no. The question is about the company's right to extract, so that's a right of the grantee. But the grantee can't have a right to extract if, for example, the land is already subject to a right of the grantee or if the grantee's rights are in a different state.

Wait, perhaps the company's right is a constructive trust or an easement, etc.

Wait, if the company's right was granted, but the grantee didn't perform the required action, but didn't object, that's a voluntary waste. So the company's right is a voluntary waste.

But the options are about what the company's rights example. Let's check the options.

The options are: E is a license, which is for someone to use their own property. But that's not relevant here.

Looking at the options, I think the company's right is not a license. How about the tenancy in common? But tenancy in common is for joint ownership, not for granting rights. So that's probably not.

Easement appurtenant: This is when the grantor has the right to use the land, and the grantee has the right to use it. So the company's right to extract would be easement appurtenant to the land, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The woman granted the company a right, which is the royalty. So the company's rights would be a right of the grantee. But when the grantee doesn't perform the required action, but doesn't object, that's a voluntary waste. So the company's right is a voluntary waste.

But looking at the options, I'm looking for what the company's right would be. So the company's right is a right of the grantee, but the grantee's right is a voluntary waste, which is a type of waste. But the options don't have a term for that. Wait, let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are: E is license, D is voluntary waste, J is easement by necessity.

So the company's right is a voluntary waste because the grantee didn't exercise the right but didn't object either. So the company's right is a voluntary waste.

Wait, but the options don't have a term for voluntary waste. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

D: voluntary waste
E: license

So in the options, D is voluntary waste. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but the question is about the company's right, which is a type of estate, not a waste. So maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the company's right is a right of the grantee. So, the grantee has a right to extract, and she didn't perform the action, but she didn't object. That's a voluntary waste. So the company's right is a voluntary waste.

Wait, but the options don't have a term for voluntary waste. Let me check: Yes, option D is voluntary waste.

So the correct answer should be D: voluntary waste.

But wait, no. Because the question is about the company's right. The woman granted it, so the company's right is an easement appurtenant to her property. Because the woman grants a right of the grantee, which is easement appurtenant.

Wait, but if she granted it as royalty, that's a right of the grantee. So the company's right is an easement appurtenant to her land because she's the right holder.

Wait, but if the company's right is an easement appurtenant, then option B is the answer. But why would the company receive all royalties without filling in the area?

Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me restate: The woman granted the company a right to extract coal. The company didn't dig the hole. However, she didn't object. So the company's right was granted, and she didn't perform, but she didn't object. That's a voluntary waste.

But the question is about the company's right. So the company's right is a right of the grantee, so it's a voluntary waste because the grantee didn't perform the right but didn't object either.

Alternatively, perhaps the company's right is the easement appurtenant, but that's not the case because the grantee has the right, but in this scenario, the grantee didn't perform the action but didn't object.

Wait, maybe the company's right is an easement appurtenant to the land, but in this case, the grantee has the right, so perhaps the company's right is an easement appurtenant because the grantee has the right to use land, which in turn appurtenant to the company's extraction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the terms again.

Easement appurtenant: The grantee has the right to use the land, which is attached to the land.

Easement by necessity: The land is used because it's essential for the survival of a particular organism.

Voluntary waste: The grantee has the right but doesn't perform, doesn't object.

So the question says the company didn't perform the extraction and didn't object, so it's a voluntary waste.

But wait, the company's right is the right to extract, which is an easement appurtenant to the land. Because the grantee has the right to use the land, and that's the easement appurtenant to the company's right.

Wait, but the company is the one that extracted, so the company's right is in the company's hands. So perhaps the company's right is a license, but that's for another type of right.

Wait, no, the company is the extractee; the grantee has the right to extract. So the grantee's right is an easement appurtenant.

Wait, perhaps the company's right is an easement appurtenant because the grantee has the right to use the land, which is the company's property.

But the question is about the company's right, which is the grantee's right. So the company's right is in the grantee's possession, but that's not an estate. So perhaps the company's right is not an estate but a right of the grantee.

Wait, but the options don't have a term that describes the grantee's right as a voluntary waste. Let's look again.

The options are:

A: constructive trust
B: easement appurtenant
C: servient estate
D: voluntary waste
E: license
F: easement in gross
G: tenancy in common
H: profit-a-prendre
I: adverse possession
J: easement by necessity

So the correct answer is D, voluntary waste. Because the grantee didn't perform the right but didn't object either, which is a voluntary waste.

Alternatively, the company's right is an easement appurtenant because the grantee has the right to use the land, which is part of the company's land.

Wait, no. The company's rights are in the grantee's property. So the grantee has the right to extract, which is an easement appurtenant to her land. So the company's right is an easement appurtenant because the grantee has the right, but the question is about the company's rights.

Wait, perhaps the company's right is not an easement but a license or a different type of right.

But, the options don't have a term that describes the grantee's right as a voluntary waste. The correct term in the options is D, voluntary waste.

So the answer is D: voluntary waste.

The question involves determining the type of estate or right applicable to the company's rights to extract coal from the woman's property. The key points are:

1. The woman granted a right to extract coal to the company via royalty. 
2. The company failed to fill in the excavated area but did not object, indicating a voluntary waste.
3. A voluntary waste occurs when the grantor does not intend to exercise the right but does so anyway.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Constructive trust** — This involves a grantor creating a trust for a grantee, which is unrelated to the company's rights.
- **B: Easement appurtenant** — This refers to a right of the grantor to use the land, which is not relevant here.
- **C: Servient estate** — This is a type of estate where the grantor has a duty to perform, but it's not a relevant term here.
- **D: Voluntary waste** — This describes a situation where the grantor does not intend to exercise the right but does so anyway. This fits the scenario described.
- **E: License** — This is for someone to use their own property, not applicable.
- **F: Easement in gross** — This is a type of easement not attached to the land, which is not relevant.
- **G: Tenancy in common** — This describes joint ownership, not relevant.
- **H: Profit-a-prendre** — A modern term for a type of estate, but not listed.
- **I: Adverse possession** — Incorrect terminology.
- **J: Easement by necessity** — This describes a feature of land essential to survival, not relevant.

The correct term for the company's right, which is a voluntary waste, is **D: voluntary waste**.

ANSWER: D
