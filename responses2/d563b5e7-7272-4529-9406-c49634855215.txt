Okay, so I have this question about converting a decimal number to hexadecimal. The number is 231 in decimal, and I need to find out which option it corresponds to among the given choices. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I remember that hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, which means each digit represents a value from 0 to 15. But wait, in hexadecimal, the digits above 9 are represented by letters. So, A is 10, B is 11, C is 12, D is 13, E is 14, and F is 15. Right.

So, to convert 231 into hexadecimal, I should divide the number by 16 and keep track of the remainders. Each remainder will correspond to a hexadecimal digit, starting from the least significant digit.

Let me start dividing 231 by 16. 16 times 14 is 224, which is less than 231. Subtracting that, 231 minus 224 is 7. So the first remainder is 7, which is the least significant digit. Now, I take the quotient, which is 14, and divide that by 16. 16 goes into 14 zero times, so the next remainder is 14. In hexadecimal, 14 is represented by 'E'. So the next digit is E.

Putting those together, the hexadecimal number is E7. Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, no. Let me go through it step by step again because sometimes I might mix up the order.

Wait, 231 divided by 16 is 14 with a remainder of 7. So the first digit (rightmost) is 7 (7 in hex is 7). Then, take 14 divided by 16. 14 divided by 16 is 0 with a remainder of 14. 14 is E, so the next digit is E. So reading from the remainders, the number is E7. Looking back at the options, option I is E7, which would be correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me add E7 in hex to decimal to see if it equals 231. E is 14, 7 is 7. So 14*16^1 + 7*16^0 = 14*16 is 224, plus 7 is 231. Yes, that's correct. So the hexadecimal is E7.

Looking at the options again: E is option I, which is E7. So the answer should be option I.

To convert the decimal number \( 231_{10} \) to hexadecimal, perform the following steps:

1. Divide \( 231 \) by \( 16 \). The quotient is \( 14 \) with a remainder of \( 7 \). The remainder \( 7 \) is the least significant digit (rightmost).
2. Divide the quotient \( 14 \) by \( 16 \). The quotient is \( 0 \) with a remainder of \( 14 \). The remainder \( 14 \) is represented as \( E \) in hexadecimal.
3. The hexadecimal number is formed by reading the remainders from last to first, giving \( E7_{16} \).

Verifying by converting \( E7_{16} \) back to decimal:
\[
E \times 16^1 + 7 \times 16^0 = 14 \times 16 + 7 = 224 + 7 = 231_{10}
\]

The correct hexadecimal representation is \( E7_{16} \), which corresponds to option I.
