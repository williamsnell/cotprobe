Okay, so I have this question about trends in food commodities on a global scale, specifically involving rising incomes and urbanization. Let me try to break this down.

The question is asking which food category is expected to rise because of these factors. The options are various types of food commodities. I remember that the options include meat, dairy, grains, oils, fruits, nuts, beans, sugars, herbs, and vegetables. 

Rising incomes would probably mean more resources and investment in food production. Urbanization suggests more people living in cities, which might consume more fresh, seasonal produce. Also, the shift towards urbanization could lead to more demand for organic, fresh foods.

Looking at the options, the first category that comes to mind is fruits and vegetables. In urban areas, people often buy fresh produce because it's more nutritious and lower in calories. This would increase the demand for fruits and vegetables, which are a staple in many cuisines and could be a major food category.

Herbs and spices are also influenced by urbanization and rising incomes, as people might want more natural and flavorful options. However, the question is about which is rising due to these trends, and fruits and vegetables are more directly tied to the consumption patterns and urban demands.

So the answer would be D: Fruits and vegetables.

Answer: D
