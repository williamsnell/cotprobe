Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about average speed. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that the first half of the distance between two points is covered at a speed of v1 = 10 mi/hr, and the second half is covered at v2 = 40 mi/hr. I need to find the average speed for the entire trip. Oh wait, average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? Oh right, because average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean; it's total distance over total time.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the first half is distance, and the second half is another distance. Let me think about this. Let's denote the total distance as D. So the first half is D/2, and the second half is also D/2. Got it.

Now, for each half, I need to calculate the time taken. Time is distance divided by speed. So for the first half, time t1 would be (D/2) divided by v1, which is 10 mi/hr. So t1 is (D/2)/10 = D/(20). Similarly, the second half is D/2, so time t2 is (D/2)/40 = D/(80).

So total time is t1 + t2, which is D/20 + D/80. Let me calculate that. To add them, I can find a common denominator. D/20 is 4D/80, so adding D/80 gives 5D/80, which simplifies to D/16 hours.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Because 1/20 is 4/80, so 4/80 D + 1/80 D is 5/80 D, which is 1/16 D. So yes, total time is D/16 hours.

Now, average speed is total distance divided by total time. The total distance is D, and the total time is D/16.

So average speed = D / (D/16) = 16 D / D = 16 mi/hr.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because average speed is 16, but wait, let me think again. Wait, no, wait, because if the speeds are different for each half distance, the average speed is not simply the arithmetic mean. Oh, right, because the time spent at each speed is different.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's 16 mi/hr. Let me see the options. Looking at the options, option A is 16 mi/hr. So that's the answer. But wait, let me think again to make sure I didn't make any mistake in calculations.

Wait, let's approach this using another method. Let's assume the total distance is 100 miles. Wait, why 100? Because 10 and 40, perhaps it's easier if I choose a distance that is a multiple of both speeds. Or maybe it's better to pick a distance that is manageable. Wait, perhaps 100 mi is a good choice because 10 and 40 are factors.

So, if the total distance D is 100 miles, then each half is 50 miles.

Time for first half: 50 miles / 10 mi/hr = 5 hours.

Time for second half: 50 miles /40 mi/hr = 50/40 = 1.25 hours.

Total time is 5 + 1.25 = 6.25 hours.

Average speed = total distance (100 miles) / total time (6.25 hours) = 100 / 6.25 = 16 mi/hr.

So that confirms it. The average speed is 16 mi/hr, which is option A.

To determine the average speed for the entire trip, we calculate the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is the sum of the two halves, each being \( \frac{D}{2} \). The time taken for each half is the distance divided by the respective speed. 

1. For the first half (\( \frac{D}{2} \)) at \( v_1 = 10 \, \text{mi/hr} \):
   \[
   t_1 = \frac{\frac{D}{2}}{10} = \frac{D}{20} \, \text{hours}.
   \]

2. For the second half (\( \frac{D}{2} \)) at \( v_2 = 40 \, \text{mi/hr} \):
   \[
   t_2 = \frac{\frac{D}{2}}{40} = \frac{D}{80} \, \text{hours}.
   \]

3. Total time:
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{D}{20} + \frac{D}{80} = \frac{4D}{80} + \frac{D}{80} = \frac{5D}{80} = \frac{D}{16} \, \text{hours}.
   \]

4. Average speed:
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{16}} = 16 \, \text{mi/hr}.
   \]

Thus, the average speed for the entire trip is \( 16 \, \text{mi/hr} \), which corresponds to option A.
