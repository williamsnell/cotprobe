Okay, so I've got this problem here about discounts and proceeds. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says there's a draft for $350 dated October 15, due in 60 days. It's being discounted on November 12 at 5% with a collection fee of (1/5)%.

Wait, so I'm a bit confused about what each term means. Let me break it down. The draft is a draft, which is a promissory note, I think. It's dated October 15, so that's the date it was made. The due date is 60 days from October 15. Then it's being discounted on November 12. So, the seller discounts it, and the buyer pays at that time. The discount rate is 5%, and there's a collection fee which is 1/5% â€” so 0.2%.

Okay, so I need to calculate the proceeds the buyer gets. The proceeds would be the amount the buyer actually receives after the discount and collection fees are deducted.

First, I need to find out how many days are between October 15 and November 12. Let me count those days.

October has 31 days, so from October 15 to the end of the month is 31 - 15 = 16 days. Then November 12 is 12 days into November. So total days between October 15 and November 12 is 16 + 12 = 28 days. Wait, but the due date is 60 days from October 15, so that's 60 days. So if the discount is on November 12, then the time the buyer is paying is 28 days, and the remaining time until due is 60 - 28 = 32 days.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the discount is applied on the date it's being discounted. So the seller pays at November 12, but the collection fee is applied on the notional amount, not on the discount. So the proceeds would be the amount the seller gets, which is the face value minus the discount and collection fee.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the present value when it's discounted.

The formula for discounting a bill is: Proceeds = Face value * (1 - (Discount rate * Time)) 

But wait, the collection fee is also a percentage. So the total discount is the discount plus the collection fee. So perhaps I should first calculate the discount amount, then add the collection fee, and then subtract that total from the face value.

Let me think. The discount rate is 5%, and the collection fee is 1/5% (which is 0.2%).

So the total discount and collection fee would be 5% + 0.2% = 5.2%.

So the proceeds would be 350 * (1 - 5.2% ). Let me compute that: 5.2% is 0.052.

So 1 - 0.052 = 0.948.

350 * 0.948 = ?

Let me do that calculation. 350 * 0.948: 350 * 0.9 = 315, 350*0.048=16.8. So 315 +16.8=331.8. Wait, that doesn't match any option. Hmm, wait, but maybe I'm not considering the time correctly.

Wait, perhaps the time is not the same as 60 days. Because the discount is applied on the due date, which is 60 days from October 15. So the time from today (discounting) to the due date is 60 days. But the discount is applied at November 12, which is 28 days before due.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact number of days between the discount date and due date.

Wait, from October 15 to November 12: October has 31 days, so 15 to 31 is 16 days. November has 12 days up to the 12th, which is 12 days. So 16+12=28 days. So the time from the discount date (Nov 12) to due date is 60 -28 = 32 days. Because 60 days is the total time from October 15 to due.

Wait, no: 60 days from Oct 15 is the due date. So the due date is 60 days from Oct 15. The discount is on Nov 12, so the time left until due is 60 - (number of days from Oct 15 to Nov 12). So let's calculate that.

From Oct 15 to Nov 12: Oct has 31-15=16 days (including Nov 12? Wait, no: because from Oct 15 to Nov 12 is 17 days? Let me count:

- Oct 15 to Oct 31: 16 days (including 15 and 31)
- Nov 1 to Nov 12: 12 days.

So total is 16+12=28 days. So the time from discount to due is 60-28=32 days.

So the time for discounting is 32 days.

So the discount amount is Face value * (Discount rate) * (Time / 360) ??? Or is it based on actual days?

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the discounting. Let me think again.

The formula for a discounted bill is: Proceeds = Face * (1 - (Discount rate * Time)), using 360 days for the denominator.

Wait, but I think the time is in days. So let me compute the discount amount.

The discount rate is 5%, so 0.05.

The time is 32 days.

So discount amount is 350 * 0.05 * (32/360)

Wait, 32/360 is 8/90, which is approximately 0.088889.

So 0.05 * 0.088889 = 0.00444445.

350 * 0.00444445 = 1.55555875.

So discount is approximately 1.5556.

Plus the collection fee of 0.2%. So total discount is 1.5556 + 0.002*350 = 0.7.

Wait, wait, collection fee is 0.2% of the face value. 0.2% of 350 is 0.7, so 0.7.

So total discount is 1.5556 + 0.7 = 2.2556.

Proceeds = 350 - 2.2556 = 347.7444.

So approximately $347.74, which is option D: $347.74.

Wait, but looking at the options, D is $347.74. So that would be the answer.

To calculate the proceeds, we first determine the time from the discount date (November 12) to the due date (October 15 + 60 days). The due date is November 12, and the time remaining until the due date is 60 - 28 = 32 days. The discount rate is 5%, and the collection fee is 0.2% of the face value.

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - Face value: $350
   - Discount rate: 5% (0.05)
   - Time: 32 days
   - Discount amount: \( 350 \times 0.05 \times \frac{32}{360} = 350 \times 0.004444 = 1.5556 \)

2. **Calculate the collection fee:**
   - Collection fee: \( 0.002 \times 350 = 0.7 \)

3. **Total discount and collection fee:**
   - Total discount: \( 1.5556 + 0.7 = 2.2556 \)

4. **Proceeds:**
   - Proceeds: \( 350 - 2.2556 = 347.7444 \)

The proceeds are approximately $347.74.
