Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it says. Hmm, it's about determining the percentage of KCl in a soil sample. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

So, the sample weighs 0.4210 grams. When they dig it out, a mixture of KCl and NaCl is found, weighing 0.0699 grams. Then, from the KCl, they precipitated 0.060 grams of AgCl. Got it. I need to find the percent of KCl in the soil.

Wait, I remember that AgCl is a common precipitate when KCl reacts with AgNO3. Oh right, that's a double displacement reaction. So the AgNO3 would react with KCl to make AgCl precipitate and KNO3 solution, which is clear. 

Let me jot down the reaction. The balanced equation should be AgNO3 + KCl → AgCl↓ + KNO3. Yup, that's right. So the moles of AgCl precipitated will be equal to the moles of KCl in the soil sample, assuming all of the KCl reacts.

So first, I'll calculate the moles of AgCl. The molar mass of AgCl is (Ag is about 107.87 g/mol, Cl is 35.45 g/mol). Adding them up, that's 107.87 + 35.45 = 143.32 g/mol. 

The mass of AgCl is 0.060 grams. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.060 / 143.32. Let me calculate that. 0.060 divided by 143.32 is approximately 0.000419 moles. Hmm, that's a small number because AgCl is a heavy salt.

But wait, each mole of KCl produces one mole of AgCl. So the moles of KCl should be the same as the moles of AgCl. So moles of KCl = 0.000419 mol. Wait, but let me check the exact calculation. Maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, wait, 0.060 grams divided by 143.32 g/mol. Let me compute that more accurately.

143.32 * 0.000419 = let's see, 0.060 / 143.32 = 0.000419 approximately. So yes, about 0.000419 moles of KCl.

Now, the total soil sample is 0.4210 grams. So the percentage of KCl is (moles of KCl * molar mass of KCl) / total mass of soil * 100%. 

The molar mass of KCl: K is about 39.10 g/mol, Cl is 35.45. So 39.10 + 35.45 = 74.55 g/mol.

So the mass of KCl is moles * molar mass = 0.000419 mol * 74.55 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.000419 *74.55 is approximately 0.0313 grams. Wait, let me do it more precisely. 

74.55 * 0.000419 = 

74.55 * 0.0004 = 0.02982, and 74.55 * 0.000019 = approx 0.001416. Adding them gives 0.031236 grams.

So the mass of KCl is about 0.031236 grams.

Now, the percentage is (0.031236 g) / (0.4210 g) * 100%. Let me compute this.

0.031236 /0.4210 = approximately 0.07414. Multiply by 100 gives about 7.414%.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.41%, so that's the answer.

To determine the percent of KCl in the soil sample, we start by analyzing the reaction between KCl and AgNO₃. The reaction is:

\[
\text{AgNO}_3 + \text{KCl} \rightarrow \text{AgCl} + \text{KNO}_3
\]

From the problem, 0.060 g of AgCl is precipitated. The molar mass of AgCl is calculated as:

\[
\text{Ag} = 107.87 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{Cl} = 35.45 \, \text{g/mol}, \quad \text{Molar mass of AgCl} = 107.87 + 35.45 = 143.32 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The moles of AgCl precipitated are:

\[
\text{Moles of AgCl} = \frac{\text{Mass of AgCl}}{\text{Molar mass of AgCl}} = \frac{0.060}{143.32} \approx 0.000419 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of KCl in the soil sample are also 0.000419 mol. The molar mass of KCl is:

\[
\text{K} = 39.10 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{Cl} = 35.45 \, \text{g/mol}, \quad \text{Molar mass of KCl} = 39.10 + 35.45 = 74.55 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The mass of KCl is:

\[
\text{Mass of KCl} = \text{Moles of KCl} \times \text{Molar mass of KCl} = 0.000419 \times 74.55 \approx 0.031236 \, \text{g}.
\]

The total mass of the soil sample is 0.4210 g. The percentage of KCl in the soil is:

\[
\text{Percentage of KCl} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of KCl}}{\text{Total mass of soil}} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.031236}{0.4210} \right) \times 100\% \approx 7.41\%.
\]

From the options provided, the closest value is **7.41%**, which corresponds to option **C**.
