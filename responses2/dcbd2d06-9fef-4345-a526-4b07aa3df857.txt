Okay, so I've got this question here about which person was not alive during the 20th century. The options are Sigmund Freud, Ulysses S. Grant, Mark Twain, and Thomas Edison. Hmm, let me think through each of them one by one.

Starting with Sigmund Freud. I remember that Freud was a famous psychologist, but I think he died in the early 1900s. Like, he died in 1922. So definitely not alive during the 20th century. But wait, wait, the question is about people not alive in the 20th century. So if someone died before 1900, they weren't alive during the 20th century. So Sigmund Freud is definitely out.

Next, Ulysses S. Grant. I'm not as familiar with this guy, but I think he was a U.S. general. I believe he served in World War I in Europe. He died in 1945, which is definitely in the 20th century. So he was alive then, so the answer isn't him.

Mark Twain, also known as Samuel E. Morse. He was an author, writer, and humorist. I think he wrote a lot, including "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" again. He died in 1914, which is in the late 19th century. So he was alive in the 20th century. So not the answer.

Lastly, Thomas Edison. I know he was a very influential inventor. He was born in 1847 and died in 1931. He worked until the late 20th century. So during the 20th century, he was definitely alive. So he's not the one who was not alive in the 20th century.

Wait, but the question is which was NOT alive in the 20th century. So the question is, which one was not alive then. So the answer would be Sigmund Freud because he died before the 20th century, while the others were alive during it.

So the correct answer is A: Sigmund Freud.
