Okay, so I've got this projectile motion problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking at what angle to the horizontal should an ideal projectile be launched so that its horizontal displacement (range) is equal to its maximum vertical displacement. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember that in projectile motion, the range R is given by (v² sin(2θ))/g, where v is the initial velocity, θ is the launch angle, and g is acceleration due to gravity. And the maximum height H is (v² sin²θ)/(2g). Oh right, those are the standard formulas.

So the problem says R equals H. That means (v² sin(2θ))/g = (v² sin²θ)/(2g). Oh wait, the v squared and g terms are on both sides, so they might cancel out. Let me write that down.

R = H
(v² sin(2θ))/g = (v² sin²θ)/(2g)
Divide both sides by (v²/g) to eliminate it:
sin(2θ) = (sin²θ)/2
Hmm, sin(2θ) is 2 sinθ cosθ, right? So substituting that in:
2 sinθ cosθ = (sin²θ)/2
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:
4 sinθ cosθ = sin²θ
Hmm, let's rearrange this. Bring everything to one side:
4 sinθ cosθ - sin²θ = 0
Factor out sinθ:
sinθ (4 cosθ - sinθ) = 0
So, sinθ = 0 or 4 cosθ - sinθ = 0.

Sinθ = 0 would imply θ is 0 or 180 degrees, which isn't a projectile motion scenario because it would just go straight up and down. So we can ignore that solution.

So we have 4 cosθ - sinθ = 0 → 4 cosθ = sinθ → sinθ = 4 cosθ. Dividing both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ isn't zero, which would again give θ=90 degrees, which isn't a solution here because sinθ would be 1, but let's see):
tanθ = 4 → θ = arctangent of 4.

Wait, so arctan(4) is the angle. Now, looking at the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are A: tan–1 4, B:60°, C:cos–1 (1/g), D:45°, E: sin–1 4, F:90°, G: tan–1 (1/g), H: cos–1 4, I: sin–1 (1/g), J:30°.

So option A is tan⁻¹4, which is exactly what I found. Let me see if any other options might be equivalent or if I made a mistake.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the algebra?

Original setup: R = H → (v² sin 2θ)/g = (v² sin²θ)/(2g). Cancel v²/g from both sides: sin2θ = (sin²θ)/2.

Yes, that's correct. Then, sin2θ is 2 sinθ cosθ, so 2 sinθ cosθ = (sin²θ)/2 → 4 sinθ cosθ = sin²θ → sinθ (4 cosθ - sinθ)=0 → sinθ=0 or 4 cosθ = sinθ → tanθ=4.

Yes, that seems right. So the angle is arctan(4), which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second, could the angle be something else? Maybe I should check with specific values. Let's say θ is arctan(4), so sinθ = 4/sqrt(17), cosθ=1/sqrt(17) (since tanθ=4, so opposite 4, adjacent 1, hypotenuse sqrt(1+16)=sqrt(17)).

Then, sinθ is 4/sqrt(17), cosθ is 1/sqrt(17).

Check R: (v² * 2*(4/sqrt(17)) * (1/sqrt(17)) ) /g → (v² * 8/(17)) /g → 8v²/(17g)

H: (v² ( (4/sqrt(17))² ) )/(2g) → v² (16/17)/(2g) → (16v²)/(34g) → 8v²/(17g). Yep, same as R. So correct.

So the answer is A.

To determine the angle at which an ideal projectile should be launched so that its horizontal displacement (range) equals its maximum vertical displacement, we analyze the given conditions:

1. The range \( R \) of a projectile is given by:
   \[
   R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
   \]
   where \( v \) is the initial velocity, \( \theta \) is the launch angle, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

2. The maximum height \( H \) of the projectile is given by:
   \[
   H = \frac{v^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}
   \]

3. The problem states that \( R = H \), so:
   \[
   \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} = \frac{v^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}
   \]

4. Simplify by canceling \( v^2 \) and \( g \) from both sides:
   \[
   \sin(2\theta) = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{2}
   \]

5. Use the double-angle identity \( \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) \):
   \[
   2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{2}
   \]

6. Rearrange and solve for \( \theta \):
   \[
   4\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) = \sin^2(\theta)
   \]
   \[
   \sin(\theta)(4\cos(\theta) - \sin(\theta)) = 0
   \]

7. Since \( \sin(\theta) = 0 \) corresponds to a launch angle of \( 0^\circ \) or \( 180^\circ \), which are not practical for projectile motion, we discard this solution. Instead, we solve:
   \[
   4\cos(\theta) = \sin(\theta)
   \]
   \[
   \tan(\theta) = 4
   \]

8. Therefore, \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(4) \), which corresponds to option A.

9. Verification: Substituting \( \tan(\theta) = 4 \) into the expressions for \( R \) and \( H \) confirms that they are equal.
