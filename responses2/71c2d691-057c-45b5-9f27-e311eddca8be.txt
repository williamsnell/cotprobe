Okay, so I have this question about banking and reserve systems. Let me try to figure it out.

The question is asking when excess reserves increase in the banking system. Excess reserves are the amount of reserves banks hold beyond what's required by the central bank, right? So, if they have more reserves than they're supposed to, that's when excess occurs.

The options are A through J, each a different scenario. I need to pick which one leads to an increase in excess reserves.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The reserve ratio is decreased. The reserve ratio is how much of deposits banks keep as reserves. If it's decreased, banks keep less of their deposits. That means they can lend more, so they'll have more excess reserves because they're holding less. So this could increase excess reserves. So A might be correct.

Option B: The discount rate is decreased. The discount rate is the interest rate the central bank charges banks for loans. Lowering it would make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the central bank. So they'd borrow more from the Fed, which would mean more loans, more reserves, less excess reserves. So B would decrease excess, not increase. So B is not correct.

Option C: The Fed reduces the amount of money in circulation. If the Fed sellsTreasury securities to banks, that reduces the money supply because the banks are taking money out of the economy to sell the securities. This would reduce the money supply, which usually leads to higher interest rates because there's less money for borrowing. But how does that affect reserves? Well, when the Fed sells securities, they take money out of the economy, so banks don't have as much reserves because they don't need as much money for their operations. Wait, but if the Fed reduces the money supply, that's a negative for the economy, but does it directly increase or decrease excess reserves? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: when the Fed sells securities, more reserves are taken out, which reduces the amount of excess reserves because the banks can't lend as much. So C would lead to a decrease in excess reserves, not increase. So C isn't the right answer.

Option D: The discount rate is increased. Higher discount rates make it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed. So banks would borrow less from the Fed, meaning they'll have less excess reserves because they're not lending as much. So D would cause a decrease in excess, not increase. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The checking deposits increase. More deposits mean more money in circulation. Higher deposits could mean more money banks have to hold as reserves, but depends on the reserve ratio. If the reserve ratio is kept the same, and deposits go up, the required reserves would increase, leaving more excess. But the question doesn't specify the reserve ratio. If the reserve ratio is kept same, then increasing deposits would increase excess. But if the reserve ratio is decreased, then the excess would go down. So E depends on the reserve ratio. The question is about when excess increases, not when it decreases. So if the reserve ratio hasn't changed, E could cause excess to increase, but the question is about when excess is INCREASED. So E is a possibility, but not necessarily the case unless the reserve ratio is kept the same. Without info, it's unclear. So E might not directly cause an increase in excess.

Option F: Checking deposits decrease. Less money in circulation. So if deposits are lower, banks can't lend as much. But again, without knowing the reserve ratio, we can't tell. But since the question is about when excess increases, F is a possible case if the reserve ratio is kept the same. But because the question is about causing an increase, F might be a possibility, but the question is about which option necessarily leads to an increase.

Option G: The Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks. As I thought earlier, selling these reduces the money supply. More reserves are taken out, so the banks have less excess reserves. So G is not the right answer.

Option H: The interest rate on loans is increased. Higher interest rates make it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed. So they'd borrow less, which would mean less excess reserves. So H would decrease excess, not increase. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The Fed buys Treasury securities from commercial banks. Buying these adds money into the economy. More reserves are being put into the system, which would free up more for lending. So banks can lend more, so their excess reserves would increase. So I would think this is correct. So I is the correct option.

Option J: The reserve ratio is increased. If the central bank increases the reserve ratio, banks have to hold more reserves for each deposit. So if they have the same amount of deposits, their reserves increase, so excess reserves decrease. So J causes a decrease in excess, not increase. So J is incorrect.

So looking back, the options that would increase excess reserves are A and I.

Wait, let me double-check.

Option A: reserve ratio decreased. So the Fed is making banks hold less. So when the reserve ratio is lower, the required reserves are less. So banks can lend more, meaning excess reserves increase. That makes sense.

Option I: Fed buys Treas. So they take money from banks, reducing their reserves. Wait, no, when the Fed buys securities, it's giving the banks cash (they sell T-bills, which are short-term government debt). So the banks have to hold more reserves because they now have more money to hold. So this would increase their reserves, but reserves are fixed based on the reserve ratio. Wait, if the Fed buys more, the banks' reserves increase. But if the reserve ratio is higher, banks have to hold more of their deposits. So increasing reserves and higher required reserves would lead to less excess. Hmm, no, I think I'm mixing up.

Wait, let me think again. When the Fed buys securities, the banks have more reserves because they receive cash. So for example, if the Fed buys a bank's security, the bank has more reserves. But the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks keep as reserves. So if the Fed buys more, the banks have more reserves, but they might have to hold more of their deposits as reserves.

Wait, let's take an example: Suppose a bank has $100 in deposits. The reserve ratio is 10%, so they must keep $10 as reserves and can lend $90. If the Fed buys $10 from the bank, the bank's reserves become $20, and their deposits are still $100, so the required reserves would be 10% of $100, which is $10. So the bank can only lend $90, but now the reserves are $20. So the excess reserves would now be $10. Wait, no, that can't be right because the required reserves are fixed at 10%. So when the Fed buys, the reserve ratio doesn't change. So the reserve ratio is, say, 10%, so the bank must keep $10. Whether the Fed buys $10 in cash, the bank's reserves go from $10 to $20, but required reserves still at 10% is $10. So the excess reserves would be $10 again. So buying more doesn't change the excess. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's think differently. The reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that the banks keep as reserves. If the Fed buys from a bank, the bank's reserves increase by the amount bought. So, say, a bank has $100 in deposits and $10 as reserves. They sell T-bills for $10, so now they have $110 in deposits, but they still have $10 in reserves. So the required reserves (10%) would be $10. So the excess is $10. So, in this case, buying from the bank increases the number of reserves but doesn't change the required reserves, so the excess remains the same.

Wait, but if the Fed buys more, like $20, then the bank's reserves go from $10 to $30. Required reserves are $10, so excess becomes $20. So that increases excess reserves.

So in this case, buying more money into the economy increases the money supply, which in turn allows the banks to lend more, increasing their excess reserves.

Therefore, option I is correct because when the Fed buys Treas, it increases reserves, allowing banks to lend more and increase excess reserves.

So the options that lead to an increase in excess reserves are A and I.

Wait, but the question is about when excess increases. So in the options, which one causes this.

So the options are:

A: Reserve ratio decreased. So lower required reserves. Thus, more excess.

I: Fed buys from banks. So they add more money into the system, allowing banks to lend more, so excess increases.

So both A and I would cause excess to increase.

But the question is asking "will increase if"... So either A or I would be correct.

Wait, but the question is about the scenario when excess increases. So let's see the options.

Looking back, the correct scenarios are either A or I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that when the Fed buys Treas, it's adding to the money supply. So when the money supply increases, it can lead to more lending, which would increase excess reserves.

So, the correct options are A and I.

But the options are single-select, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine.

The question is asking which one is a condition that leads to excess increasing.

So which of the options, when true, leads to that.

So looking again:

A: Reserve ratio decreased. So required reserves are lower. So more excess.

I: Fed buysTreasury. More money in the system, allowing more lending, so excess increases.

So both A and I make excess increase.

But the question is, which of the options is correct.

Wait, but the options are a list of possible conditions, and only one is correct.

Is that possible? Because both A and I seem correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about option I.

Wait, when the Fed buys from banks, the banks' reserves increase, which could allow more lending. However, the reserve ratio (the fraction each bank holds as reserves) remains the same. So if the required reserves are fixed, but the reserves have increased, then the excess is fixed.

Wait, no, because the required reserves are based on the reserve ratio and the deposits. So if the Fed buys more, the reserve ratio is unchanged, so required reserves are same. So for example, if a bank has $100 in deposits and the reserve ratio is 10%, they keep $10 as reserves. If the Fed buys $20, the bank's reserves become $30, but the required reserves are still $10. So excess is $20.

So that's an increase in excess.

So in this case, buying more money increases the money supply, allowing more lending, which increases excess reserves.

So both A and I would cause excess to increase.

So the options are A and I. But in the given choices, the options are separate, so the answer is either A or I.

Wait, but the options are all separate. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check each option again.

Option G: The Fed sells Treas to banks.

When the Fed sells Treas (takes cash), the banks have less reserves. So they have to hold more reserves than before, which would decrease excess. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Interest rate is increased. Higher interest rates make it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed, so they lend less, so excess decreases. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Fed buys Treas. As discussed, this increases reserves, allowing more lending. So excess increases. So I is correct.

Option A: Reserve ratio decreased. Lower required reserves, so more excess. So A is correct.

So both A and I are correct. But looking back at the question, it's a multiple-choice with options A through J. So perhaps the question is structured such that only one option is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking about option I.

Wait, when the Fed buys from a bank, the bank's reserves increase, which allows them to lend more. So the excess reserves increase.

But does it depend on the reserve ratio? Let's say the reserve ratio is 10%, and the bank has $100 in deposits.

If the Fed buys $10, the bank's reserves go to $20. But required reserves are 10% of $100, which is $10. So the excess is $10.

If the Fed buys $20, reserves go to $30, excess is $20.

So in both cases, excess increases.

So option I is correct.

So if the Fed buys from banks, more money in the economy, allowing more lending, thus increasing excess.

So the correct answers are A and I.

But wait, the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, reviewing the options:

The question is, "Excess reserves in the banking system will increase if...".

So both A and I cause excess to increase.

But in the options, I is an option. So either I is correct, or both A and I are correct.

Wait, but the question only gives one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again.

Another approach: excess reserves are deposits - required reserves.

So excess = deposits - (reserve ratio * deposits).

So if the reserve ratio decreases, (reserve ratio * deposits) decreases. So excess increases.

If the Fed buys, the required reserves are (reserve ratio * deposits). So if the Fed buys, the required reserves stay same, but deposits remain same, so excess remains same? Or does the required reserves stay same because the reserve ratio is fixed?

Wait, no, the required reserves are based on the reserve ratio and the deposits. So if the reserve ratio remains same, and deposits increase due to Fed buying, then required reserves remain the same.

Wait, no, because if the Fed buys, it's not changing the reserve ratio. So if the reserve ratio is, say, 10%, and deposits are $100, required reserves are $10. If the Fed buys $10, then reserves are $20, but required reserves are still $10. So excess is now $10. So if the Fed buys, the required reserves remain the same, but the actual reserves increase. So excess increases.

So in that case, option I is correct.

So now, the question is which of the options A or I is correct.

Wait, but the question is about when excess increases. So both A and I cause excess to increase.

But perhaps the question is structured such that only one option is correct. Wait, perhaps I missed some other factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fed buying reduces the reserve ratio, but that's not part of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: reserve ratio decreased.

I: Fed buys.

So both cause excess to increase.

But the question is in a multiple-choice context where only one answer is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the effect of buying on excess reserves.

Wait, another point: when the Fed buys from the banks, banks' reserves increase. But the reserve ratio is fixed, so required reserves are fixed. So, for example, if a bank has $100 deposits and required reserves are 10%, they have to hold $10, but if they receive $10 from the Fed, their reserves become $20, but required reserves are still $10. So the excess is $10 more.

Thus, when the Fed buys more, the excess increases.

So in that case, option I is correct.

So the correct options are A and I.

But since the question asks for when excess increases, both A and I could be correct. However, the way the options are structured, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the options.

Wait, the question is about when excess increases. So in the options, the correct answers would be A and I.

But in the provided options, each is an option, so the correct answer should include either A or I.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting I as the correct answer, because when the Fed buys, it directly increases reserves, which allows for more lending, which increases excess.

So I think the correct answers are A and I.

But the options are separate, so I might have to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer depends on the reserve ratio.

Wait, let me think: when the Fed buys, the required reserves are fixed. So if the reserve ratio is fixed, the required reserves (which is a percentage of deposits) don't change. So if the Fed buys, the reserves increase, but the required reserves stay the same, so excess increases.

So, option I is correct.

Therefore, the correct answers are A and I.

But looking back, the question is a single choice, so perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look at some other sources or think about similar questions.

Wait, I recall that when the Fed buys the banks' reserves, it increases the money supply, which allows the banks to lend more, thus increasing excess reserves. So option I is correct.

So, depending on the scenario, either A or I is correct.

But the question is a single answer. So in the options, the correct answers are A and I.

Wait, but in the given options, each is a separate option. So if the question is structured with options A through J, each a possible single correct answer, then perhaps the correct answer is either A or I.

Wait, but the options are single letters. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the effect of the reserve ratio.

Wait, another approach: when the Fed buys Treas (option I), the Fed is buying from the banks, adding to their reserves. So for example, if a bank had $100 in deposits, and the reserve ratio is 10%, they must hold $10 as reserves, allowing them to lend $90. If the Fed buys $10, the reserve becomes $20, but required reserves are still $10. So excess is $10. So, yes, excess increases.

So option I is correct.

Therefore, the correct answers are A and I.

Wait, but the question is a single-answer multiple-choice. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe the correct answer is I.

Wait, the question is which option leads to an increase in excess reserves.

So, the correct options are A and I.

But the way the options are presented, perhaps in the given problem, only option I is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, and I misread option A.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I.

So, to sum up:

When the Fed buys from banks (option I), it adds to the reserve ratio? Or does it?

Wait, no, the reserve ratio is fixed. So, for example, if a bank has $100 deposits and the reserve ratio is 10%, they must hold $10. If the Fed buys $10, the bank's reserves become $20, but required reserves are still $10. So excess is $10.

Thus, option I is correct because it increases the money supply, allowing more lending, which increases excess reserves.

Therefore, the correct answer is I.

But I'm a bit unsure about option A.

Wait, option A: reserve ratio is decreased.

So for example, if reserve ratio is 10%, and it's decreased to 5%, the required reserves are now 5% of deposits, which is lower.

So excess is more because required reserves are lower.

So, yes, option A is correct.

So, the question is, when does excess increase?

Both options A and I would cause excess to increase.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is I.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and I. But in the given options, perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, perhaps I should pick I as the correct answer.

But I'm not 100% confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering that buying a bank's Treas doesn't change the required reserves, but increases the reserves, thus allowing more lending.

So, in that case, option I is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is I.

But wait, the question is about when excess increases. So, the correct answer is I.

So, I think I'm confident that option I is correct.
</think>

To determine when excess reserves in the banking system increase, let's analyze each option:

### Option A: The reserve ratio is decreased.
- The reserve ratio determines the fraction of deposits that banks must hold as reserves.
- If the reserve ratio decreases, the required reserves (a percentage of deposits) become smaller.
- This allows banks to lend more, increasing their excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario leads to an increase in excess reserves.

### Option B: The money supply is increased.
- The money supply is directly related to the reserves held by banks.
- If the money supply increases, it would require banks to hold more reserves (due to the reserve ratio).
- This would decrease excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario does not lead to an increase in excess reserves.

### Option C: The required reserves are decreased.
- The required reserves are calculated as a percentage of deposits.
- If the required reserves decrease, it means banks hold less of their deposits as reserves.
- This would allow banks to lend more, increasing their excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario leads to an increase in excess reserves.

### Option D: The central bank increases the reserve ratio.
- A higher reserve ratio means banks hold a larger percentage of their deposits as reserves.
- This reduces the amount of money available for lending, decreasing excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario does not lead to an increase in excess reserves.

### Option E: The reserve ratio is increased.
- If the reserve ratio is increased, banks have to hold a larger fraction of their deposits as reserves.
- This reduces the amount of money available for lending, decreasing excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario does not lead to an increase in excess reserves.

### Option F: The Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks.
- Selling Treasury securities reduces the reserves held by banks.
- This allows banks to lend more, increasing their excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario leads to an increase in excess reserves.

### Option G: The Fed buys Treasury securities to commercial banks.
- Buying Treasury securities increases the reserves held by banks.
- However, the reserve ratio remains unchanged, so the required reserves stay the same.
- This would decrease excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario does not lead to an increase in excess reserves.

### Option H: The Fed increases the interest rate.
- Higher interest rates make it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed.
- This reduces the amount of money available for lending, decreasing excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario does not lead to an increase in excess reserves.

### Option I: The Fed buys Treasury securities to commercial banks.
- Buying Treasury securities increases the reserves held by banks.
- The reserve ratio remains unchanged, so the required reserves stay the same.
- This increases the excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario leads to an increase in excess reserves.

### Option J: The Fed decreases the interest rate.
- Lower interest rates make it easier for banks to borrow from the Fed.
- This reduces the amount of money available for lending, decreasing excess reserves.
- **Conclusion**: This scenario does not lead to an increase in excess reserves.

### Final Conclusion:
Both **Option A** and **Option I** lead to an increase in excess reserves. However, since the question requires selecting a single answer, **Option I** is the most appropriate choice.

ANSWER: I
