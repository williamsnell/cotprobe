Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because ionic bonds have always been a bit tricky for me. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about forming an ionic molecule AB. It says that an electron from atom A donates to atom B. So that's a typical ionic bonding scenario. The ionization potential of A is 5.5 eV, and the electron affinity of B is 1.5 eV. Oh, wait, ionization potential is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom, so lower it is, the harder it is to ionize. Electron affinity is the energy gained when an electron is added to an atom, so positive means it's favorable, negative would mean it's unfavorable.

But wait, for the formation of the ionic bond, the energy released should be more than the energy required. Because that's how bonds form energetically. So the reaction would be A losing an electron (becoming A+) and B gaining an electron (becoming B^-). The energy involved is the ionization potential of A and the electron affinity of B.

So the overall energy change for the bond formation is (Ionization energy of A) + (Electron affinity of B), because A loses an electron which is -5.5 eV, and B gains an electron (+1.5 eV). So the total energy is -5.5 + 1.5 = -4 eV. That's negative, meaning the bond is stabilized.

But wait, I'm not sure if I'm thinking about the signs correctly. The ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron, so it's positive. Electron affinity is the energy gained when an electron is added, so it's positive as well because energy is gained.

So the system's overall energy change for the bond is (Ionization energy of A) + (Electron affinity of B). If this is negative, the bond is favorable. So in this case, -5.5 +1.5 = -4 eV, which is favorable.

But how does that relate to the bond's size? Oh, right, the larger the ion, the smaller the bond length. Because ions with bigger atoms are farther apart. So for a bond to form, the ions must be close enough for the attractive forces to overcome the repulsive forces.

Wait, the question is about the maximum size of A^+ that would lend itself to a stable bond. So it's about the ionic radius. The radius of the ions affects the bond strength. The bigger the ion, the smaller the bond length, and the more stable the bond.

So the problem is, given that the ion B^- has a radius of 0.20 nm, what is the maximum size of A^+ that would form a stable bond.

Hmm. So the ions in the bond would be A^+ and B^-. The radius of A^+ must be less than the radius of B^- because otherwise, the ions would be too big and the repulsive forces would dominate, making the bond unstable.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum size of A^+ that would allow a stable bond. So what determines the maximum size? Well, the ionic radius of A^+ should be close to the radius of B^-. Because if A^+ is larger, it would repel B^- more, making the bond weaker. So to form a stable bond, the A^+ should be as big as possible but not bigger than the B^-.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The more the ions are close, the more the bond is stable. So if A^+ is too big, it would start to repel B^-, making the bond weaker. So the maximum size of A^+ is when it's as big as B^- but just under it.

Wait, but what's given is the radius of B^-. Oh, the problem states that the ion B^- has a radius of 0.20 nm. So the maximum size of A^+ would be just under 0.20 nm.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: 0.10 nm
B: 0.25 nm
C: 0.36 nm
D: 0.15 nm
E: 0.40 nm
F: 0.22 nm
G: 0.30 nm
H: 0.12 nm
I: 0.20 nm
J: 0.16 nm

So the maximum size of A^+ that would still form a stable bond would be just less than 0.20 nm. So the options that are less than 0.20 are options A (0.10), D (0.15), H (0.12), I (0.20), and J (0.16). But wait, option I is 0.20, which would be equal to B^-'s radius. But if A^+ is equal to B^-'s radius, would that cause a strong repulsion? Or would it just barely bind?

Wait, let's consider the concept of ion size. In ionic bonding, the bond is more stable when the ions are close. If they are larger, the repulsion becomes significant. So the maximum size of A^+ is just under the B^-'s radius. But the given options don't have an option just less than 0.20 nm, but the closest is option I (0.20) and J (0.16). Wait, no, the B^- has radius 0.20, so the A^+ can't be larger than that. So the maximum A^+ size would be just below 0.20 nm.

Looking at the options, none of the options are 0.20 nm except option I (0.20). But wait, in the options, I see option I is 0.20, and J is 0.16 which is less. So wait, if the maximum size of A^+ is just under 0.20, then which option is the largest? Let's see:

Options less than 0.20: 0.16 (J), 0.15 (D), 0.12 (H), 0.10 (A), 0.16 (J), 0.22 (F) is larger than 0.20, but that's not possible because B^- is 0.20. So the only options that are under 0.20 are A, D, H, J, and F (but F is 0.22, which is larger than B's 0.20).

Wait, no. The options are A through J, with I being 0.20, J being 0.16. So looking at the options:

Which is the largest value less than 0.20? The options are 0.20 (I), 0.22 (F), 0.25 (B), etc. So 0.20 is the only one under 0.22, but the maximum possible for A is just under 0.20. So the largest possible option is 0.16 (J). Wait, but that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the reasoning wrong. Let me think again. The radius of the ions in the bond determines the bond strength. If the ion A^+ is larger than B^-, the repulsion becomes significant, making the bond weaker. So to form a stable bond, A^+ must be smaller in size than B^-. So the maximum size of A^+ that would form a stable bond is just less than B^-'s radius.

So in this case, B^- has a radius of 0.20 nm. So the maximum size of A^+ would be just under 0.20 nm. Looking at the options, the only option under 0.20 is 0.16 nm (J), 0.15 (D), etc. But wait, 0.16 is less than 0.20, so that's possible. But wait, perhaps the maximum is the size of B^-, but that would be a 1:1 ion pair, which might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the ions' radii, but I think that's not right.

Wait, no, in ionic bonding, the bond is more stable when the ions are as close as possible. So the maximum size of A^+ would be when it's just less than the radius of B^-, but not larger. So the largest possible is just under 0.20 nm.

Looking at the options, the largest possible is option J (0.16), but wait, no. Because 0.16 is less than 0.20, so that would be possible. But wait, the question is about the maximum size. So the maximum possible A^+ size would be when it's just under 0.20, but in the options, the largest such option is J (0.16), which is not the maximum possible. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum radius of A^+ is when the bond is just stable—meaning, when the Coulombic attraction is sufficient to overcome the repulsion. So the radius is determined by the balance between attraction and repulsion.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum size of A^+, implying that if it's too big, the bond might not be formed. So the maximum is when it's just the right size.

Wait, but the problem gives the radius of B^- as 0.20 nm. So if A^+ is 0.20 nm, it would just be the same as B^-'s radius. That would mean that the ions are in contact, but would that be enough for a stable bond? Maybe not, because if they are the same size, the repulsion would be maximum, making the bond weaker. So the maximum size of A^+ would be just under 0.20 nm. But the options don't have any option under 0.20 except the largest under is 0.16 nm, which is J.

Wait, but J is 0.16, which is smaller than 0.20. So the largest possible is 0.16 nm. So the correct answer would be the option that's just under 0.20 nm, which is not present. So perhaps the answer is the one that is the largest below 0.20, which would be J (0.16) or I (0.20), but I is equal, which is same size as B^-, which might not be stable.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the maximum size is when A^+ is as large as possible without the ions overlapping, which would be just under 0.20 nm. But looking at the options, the largest possible that is less than 0.20 is J (0.16 nm). Because 0.20 is the only option that is equal to B^-'s radius, and that might not form a stable bond.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum size of A^+ that would lend itself to a stable bond. So the maximum possible is the size where the ions are just touching each other (equal in size). If they are larger than that, the ions would repel more, leading to a weaker bond. So the maximum size of A^+ is 0.20 nm, which is option I. But wait, option I is 0.20 which is the same as B^-'s radius. So that would mean the ions just touch, but is that a stable bond? It depends on the balance.

Wait, perhaps the ion size affects the Coulombic attraction. The Coulombic attraction increases as the ions get closer. So the maximum size would be when the Coulombic attraction is sufficient. But without knowing the specific values of the ion charges, it's hard to say.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is, given that the radius of B^- is 0.20 nm, what's the maximum size A^+ can be for a stable bond. So the maximum size is when the ions are as close as possible. So the maximum would be just under 0.20 nm.

But the options don't have anything under 0.20 except J (0.16) and I (0.20). So I is equal, so it's not possible. The next option is J (0.16), which is under. So the maximum size is 0.16 nm, which is option J.

Wait, no. Oh wait, the question is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The question is about the maximum size of A^+ that would lend itself to a energetically stable bond. So the maximum size would be the size where the bond just forms, which is when the ions are as close as possible. That would be when the radius of A^+ is just less than B^-'s radius. So the maximum size of A^+ is just under 0.20 nm.

Looking at the options, the largest such option is J (0.16), which is under 0.20. So the answer would be J.

To determine the maximum size of A⁺ that would lend itself to the formation of an energetically stable bond with B⁻ (given that B⁻ has a radius of 0.20 nm), we must consider the relationship between ion size and ionic bonding. The bond is more stable when the ions are close to each other, and the repulsive forces between them dominate if the ions are too large. 

The formation of the ionic bond between A⁺ and B⁻ involves the release of energy from the electron transfer (ionization of A⁺) and the gain of energy from the electron affinity of B⁻. The overall energy change for the bond is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \text{Ionization energy of } A⁺ + \text{Electron affinity of } B⁻
\]

Here, the ionization energy of A⁺ is 5.5 eV, and the electron affinity of B⁻ is 1.5 eV. Thus, the overall energy change is:

\[
\Delta E = -5.5 \, \text{eV} + 1.5 \, \text{eV} = -4 \, \text{eV}
\]

A negative ΔE indicates a stable bond. However, the key factor here is the relative sizes of the ions. The bond is more stable when the ions are as close as possible, meaning A⁺ should be smaller than B⁻ to avoid repulsive forces that would weaken the bond. The maximum size of A⁺ corresponds to the point where the ions are just about to repel each other, which is when A⁺ is slightly smaller than B⁻.

Given that B⁻ has a radius of 0.20 nm, the maximum size of A⁺ that would form a stable bond would be just under 0.20 nm. Among the provided options:

- **A: 0.10 nm**
- **B: 0.25 nm**
- **C: 0.36 nm**
- **D: 0.15 nm**
- **E: 0.40 nm**
- **F: 0.22 nm**
- **G: 0.30 nm**
- **H: 0.12 nm**
- **I: 0.20 nm**
- **J: 0.16 nm**
- **K: 0.18 nm** (not listed)

The largest value under 0.20 nm is **J: 0.16 nm**. This is the maximum size of A⁺ that would lend itself to a stable bond, as larger sizes would lead to repulsive forces that destabilize the bond.
