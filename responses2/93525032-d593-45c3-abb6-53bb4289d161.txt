Okay, so I need to figure out by how much investment must rise to bring about a $300M change in income, given that the MPC is 0.75. Hmm, I remember something about the multiplier effect from economics. Let me think.

The MPC is the marginal Propensity to save, right? So it's the fraction of additional income that people choose to save. The remaining fraction is consumed, which affects the multiplier. Oh wait, the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 - MPC). So if MPC is 0.75, then 1 - 0.75 is 0.25. So 1 / 0.25 is 4. That means each dollar of investment leads to a $4 increase in final income, because the multiplier is 4.

Wait, but the question is how much investment is needed to get a $300M change in income. So if the multiplier is 4, then investment needed = change in income / multiplier. That would be 300M / 4. Let me calculate that. 300 divided by 4 is 75. So the investment needs to rise by $75M.

Looking at the options, option E is $75M. So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is the one that, when multiplied by the MPC, increases income by $300M. The multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC) = 1/(0.25) = 4. So investment needed is 300M / 4 = 75M. This matches option E.

Answer: E
