Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics question about ideal gases and their temperature changes during expansion. Hmm, let me think. The question says, "Does an ideal gas get hotter or colder when it expands according to the law pV² = Const?" And there are options from A to J. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I need to break it down.

Wait, the expansion law is given as pV² equals a constant. So pV² = k, where k is a constant. I remember that for an ideal gas, the state is defined by PV = nRT, so pressure times volume equals nRT. But how does this relate to temperature changes during expansion?

In this case, the expansion is governed by the equation pV² = const. So, when the gas expands, its volume increases. I'm trying to figure out how pressure and temperature change under this condition.

Let me start with the ideal gas law. PV = nRT. So, if the volume increases, and if pressure decreases, temperature might change. But here, the expansion is governed by pV² = const. So, if V increases, what happens to p?

From pV² = k, if V increases, then p must decrease. Because if V² is increasing, then p must be decreasing to keep the product constant. So, p is inversely proportional to V squared.

But how does this affect temperature? Let's see. Using PV = nRT, I can solve for T: T = PV/(nR). Since p is inversely proportional to V², let's express p as k/(V²). So,

T = (k/(V²)) * V/(nR) ) → because PV is (k/(V²)) * V.

Simplify that: (k/(V²)) * V = k/(V). So,

T = (k)/(nR V) → T = (k)/(nR V) → T = (k)/(nR V) = (k/(nR)) * (1/V)

Wait, that means temperature is inversely proportional to V. So as V increases, T decreases. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options except maybe C or E or something else.

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me go step by step. The given condition is pV² = constant. So, p = k/(V²). Substitute this into the ideal gas equation.

PV = nRT → (k/V²) * V = nRT → (k/V) = nRT → T = k/(nR V).

So, yes, T is inversely proportional to V. So, as the volume increases, T decreases. So the gas cools down.

Wait, but what's the direction of the temperature change? The gas expands, so the volume increases. Since T = k/(nR V), increasing V decreases T. So the temperature decreases, meaning the gas gets colder.

Looking at the options, option E says it gets colder, but that's only under low pressure. Wait, but in this equation, p is k/(V²), so as V increases, p decreases, which aligns with the expansion. So the temperature trend is T = k/(nR V), so yes, T decreases. So the gas cools.

Wait, but wait another thing. I might have gotten the substitution wrong. Let me think again. If pV² =k, then V is equal to (k/p)^(1/2). So, V is proportional to 1/√p. So when V increases, p must decrease.

In the ideal gas law, PV = nRT → T = (PV)/(nR) → but since V is increasing, and pressure is decreasing, what's the net effect on T?

Wait, I need to find how T changes when V increases. Let's find dV/dT and see. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the chain rule.

Since pV² = k → p = k/(V²). So T = PV/(nR) = (k/V²) * V/(nR) = k/(nR V). So T = k/(nR V) → T is inversely proportional to V. So, as V increases, T decreases. So the temperature of the gas decreases, meaning it gets colder.

So the gas's temperature decreases. Looking at the options, option E says, "it gets colder, but only under low pressure." Does that fit?

Wait, when the gas expands, the pressure decreases. For the equation pV² = k, as V increases, p decreases. So in the expansion, the pressure is getting lower. So the expansion is under low pressure conditions, so option E says it's only under low pressure. So E would be correct.

Wait, but another thought: for the equation pV² = k, when V increases, pressure decreases. So the expansion is happening under conditions where the pressure is lower, which is what option E refers to. So the correct answer would be E: it gets colder, but only under low pressure.

Looking at the options, E is correct. So the answer should be E.

To determine whether an ideal gas gets hotter or colder during expansion under the law \( pV^2 = \text{const} \), we analyze the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature. The ideal gas law is \( PV = nRT \), where \( n \) is the number of moles and \( R \) is the gas constant. From \( pV^2 = k \), we find \( p = \frac{k}{V^2} \). Substituting this into the ideal gas law gives:

\[
PV = nRT \implies \frac{k}{V^2} \cdot V = nRT \implies \frac{k}{V} = nRT \implies T = \frac{k}{nRT}.
\]

Thus, the temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the volume \( V \), i.e., \( T \propto \frac{1}{V} \). As the gas expands (volume \( V \) increases), the temperature \( T \) decreases. Therefore, the gas cools down.

Furthermore, from \( pV^2 = k \), we see that the pressure \( p \) decreases as the volume \( V \) increases. This corresponds to expansion under low-pressure conditions. Hence, the gas gets colder, but only under low pressure.

The correct answer is **E: it gets colder, but only under low pressure**.
