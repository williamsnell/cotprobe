Okay, so I've got this question about Edith Calder's weekly earnings. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says Edith earns a weekly salary of $80, plus a 5% commission on her sales over $1,000. Last week, her sales were $1,354.20. I need to find her total earnings for the week and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, her base salary is $80. That's straightforward. Then, she makes a commission on sales that exceed $1,000. So, I need to calculate how much she earned from those sales.

Her total sales were $1,354.20. The sales target for commission is over $1,000, so the amount she qualifies for commission is the amount above $1,000. Let's calculate that: $1,354.20 minus $1,000 equals $354.20.

Now, she gets a 5% commission on that $354.20. To find the commission, I multiply $354.20 by 5%. Let me do the math.

5% is the same as 0.05. So, 354.20 * 0.05. Let's see, 350 * 0.05 is 17.5, and 4.20 * 0.05 is 0.21. So adding them together, 17.5 + 0.21 equals $17.71.

Wait, no, that's 354.20. Let me do that again. 354.20 * 0.05. 350 is 17.5, and 4.20 is 0.21. So 17.5 + 0.21 is 17.71, yes. So the commission is $17.71.

Now, her total earnings are the base salary plus the commission. So that's $80 + $17.71. Let me add that. $80 plus $17 is $97, and then plus 0.71, making $97.71.

Looking at the options, let me check. The options are from A to J. The numbers are A: $100.71, B: $88.50, C: $17.71, D: $1,354.20 (which is her sales, not her earnings), E: $80.00 (base salary), F: $85.00, G: $90.21, H: $135.42, I: $97.71, J: $82.71.

So the correct calculation gives me $97.71, which is option I. Wait, but let me double-check my commission calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

She sells $1,354.20, which is more than $1,000. So, the amount above is $354.20. 5% of that is 0.05 * 354.20 = 17.71. So yes, that's correct. Her total is 80 + 17.71 = 97.71. So the answer should be I: $97.71.

Edith's total earnings are calculated by adding her base salary of $80 to a 5% commission on her sales over $1,000. Her sales were $1,354.20, so the amount exceeding $1,000 is $354.20. The commission is 5% of $354.20, which is $17.71. Adding the base salary, her total earnings are $80 + $17.71 = $97.71. 

The correct answer is I: $97.71.
