Alright, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about Tom and Jerry entering into a contract where Tom agrees to sell Jerry $1,000 worth of heroin, which is illegal. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I should recall what each term means. A contract is a legally binding agreement between two parties. Now, the question is about the type of contract here.

Tom is selling heroin, which is illegal. But the contract itself, being between two people, would normally be a bilateral contract, meaning both parties are legally responsible. So that might be option E, but wait, let me think.

Wait, sometimes in contracts, especially those involving illegal goods, the terms might be considered as express or implied. So, if Tom agreed to sell heroin, even though it's illegal, that's an express contract. Express contracts are when the terms are clearly written and agreed upon, regardless of whether the goods are legal or not.

Looking at the options again, D is an express contract. So if Tom agreed to sell, that's an express contract. But wait, option A is a quasi contract. Quasi contracts are a type of express contract that arises when direct legal causation isn't present. But here, since it's an explicit contract between two people, it's more likely an express rather than quasi.

Wait, but sometimes if the contract is illegal, does it fall under quasi? No, because quasi contracts don't have to be illegal. So, the correct classification here is an express contract.

So the options: D is the correct answer. The other options don't fit as well. For example, a unilateral contract is one-sided, which isn't the case here. A bilateral contract is two-way, but it's not just about the contract being express; it's more that the terms are clear. So D would be the right choice.

The correct answer is D: express contract.
