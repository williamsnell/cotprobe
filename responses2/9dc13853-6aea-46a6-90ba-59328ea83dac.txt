Okay, so I've got this fluid dynamics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about the flow speed of an ideal fluid in a pipe that splits into three paths. 

Alright, first, I remember from my physics classes that when a fluid flows through a pipe and splits into multiple paths, certain laws apply. Oh wait, maybe it's the continuity equation that's relevant here. Because continuity equation deals with the conservation of mass in fluid flow. Yeah, right, the continuity equation says that the mass flow rate is constant along the pipe, assuming the fluid is incompressible and the density doesn't change. Since it's an ideal fluid, we can ignore viscosity and density changes, so it's straightforward.

The continuity equation in fluid dynamics is basically the principle that the volume flow rate stays constant. So, for the flow before splitting into three paths, the volume flow rate (Q) is equal to the sum of the volume flow rates of each of the three paths after splitting.

Wait, what's the volume flow rate formula again? Oh right, it's the product of the cross-sectional area and the velocity. So Q = A * v. And since the pipe has a radius Q, the initial cross-section area is πQ². The velocity is V, so the initial volume flow rate is πQ² * V.

After splitting, each path has a radius of Q/2. So the cross-sectional area for each small pipe would be π*(Q/2)². Let's calculate that: π*(Q²/4) = πQ²/4. Since there are three such paths, the total cross-sectional area after splitting is 3*(πQ²/4) = 3πQ²/4.

Wait, but the volume flow rate should be the same as before, right? Because the fluid isn't leaving or entering the system, it's just splitting into three paths. So the initial Q (volume flow rate) equals the sum of the Q's after splitting.

So initial Q = πQ² V. After, each after path is A * v = (πQ²/4) * v', where v' is the velocity in each path. Since there are three paths, total Q after is 3*(πQ²/4) * v'.

So setting them equal: πQ² V = 3*(πQ²/4)*v' → Simplify both sides. 

Divide both sides by π Q². That leaves V = (3/4) v'. So solving for v', multiply both sides by 4/3 → v' = (4/3) V. 

Wait, so the velocity in each path is (4/3) V? But wait, that can't be right because the velocity is inversely proportional to area. Because the area of each small pipe is smaller. Let me think: if the area is (Q/2)^2 = Q²/4, which is a quarter of the original cross-sectional area. So each path has 1/4 area, and three paths make 3/4. So the total area after is 3*(1/4) = 3/4 of the original. So the total flow rate is 3/4 of the original, so each path's flow speed must be higher than V by a factor that inversely relates to the area. 

Alternatively, the area is A_initial = π Q². After splitting, each A is π (Q/2)^2 = π Q² /4. Three paths, so 3*(π Q²/4) = 3π Q²/4. So the total area after is 3/4 of the original area. 

Because the total flow rate is conserved, initial Q is the same as the sum of the Q's after. So Q_initial = 3 Q_after. So each Q_after is Q_initial /3. But Q_after is A_after * v_after. So v_after = Q_after / A_after. 

Substituting, v = (Q_initial/3) / (3*(A_initial/4) ))? Wait, let me clarify:

Original Q is π Q² V. After, each v is v', and A is π (Q/2)^2 = π Q² /4. So Q_after = A * v' = (π Q²/4) * v'. Since there are three paths, total Q_after is 3*(π Q²/4)*v' = (3 π Q² /4) v'. 

But since Q_initial = Q_after, we have π Q² V = (3 π Q² /4) v'. 

Divide both sides by π Q² → V = (3/4) v'. So v' = (4/3) V. 

So each path has a flow speed of (4/3)V. Looking at the options, option A is 4/3 V. So the answer should be A.

To determine the flow speed through each of the three separate paths, we apply the principle of conservation of mass in fluid dynamics, known as the continuity equation. The continuity equation states that the volume flow rate remains constant across the pipe before and after splitting. 

The initial volume flow rate is given by:

\[
Q_{\text{initial}} = \pi Q^2 V
\]

After splitting into three paths, each with radius \( Q/2 \), the cross-sectional area of each small pipe is:

\[
A_{\text{small}} = \pi \left(\frac{Q}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi Q^2}{4}
\]

Since there are three such paths, the total cross-sectional area after splitting is:

\[
A_{\text{total}} = 3 \cdot \frac{\pi Q^2}{4} = \frac{3\pi Q^2}{4}
\]

The volume flow rate after splitting is the sum of the flow rates through each of the three paths. Let \( v' \) be the flow speed in each path. Then, the total volume flow rate after splitting is:

\[
Q_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{total}} \cdot v' = \frac{3\pi Q^2}{4} \cdot v'
\]

Since the volume flow rate is conserved, the initial flow rate equals the total flow rate after splitting:

\[
\pi Q^2 V = \frac{3\pi Q^2}{4} \cdot v'
\]

Simplifying:

\[
V = \frac{3}{4} v' \quad \Rightarrow \quad v' = \frac{4}{3} V
\]

Thus, the flow speed through each of the three paths is \( \frac{4}{3} V \). Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

A: \( \frac{4}{3} V \).
