Options:

A: mistakes in translation of structural genes.
B: mistakes in DNA replication.
C: translocations and mistakes in meiosis.
D: recombination at fertilization.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about genetic variation and evolution. Hmm, I remember that evolution involves changes in genetic material over time, and diversity comes from various sources. The question is asking which of the options is NOT a source of variation that contributes to evolution.

The options are A to D. Let me think about each one.

Option A: Mistakes in translation of structural genes. Wait, translation is the process where mRNA is translated into proteins. Structural genes are parts of the DNA that code for proteins, right? So mistakes in translating these would mean errors in protein production. But wait, is that variation? Or is that just a decrease in protein diversity? Because if the gene is right, the proteins would be same. But if the gene is incorrect, it might produce a different protein. But wait, that's about mutations, not genetic variation as in variation in the organism itself. Oh, the question is about sources of genetic variation, not mutations. So maybe A is not the correct answer because it's more about a change in protein rather than variation in the organism.

Option B: Mistakes in DNA replication. DNA replication involves copying the DNA, and sometimes errors occur. This leads to mutations, which are changes in DNA sequences. These mutations can lead to new traits, right? So this is a source of variation. So B is a source, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Translocations and mistakes in meiosis. Translocations are when two different chromosomes exchange parts, leading to new chromosomes. These can cause genetic variation because the new chromosomes might carry different genes. Also, mistakes during meiosis (like genetic recombination during gamete formation) lead to new combinations of alleles. So C is definitely a source, so it's not the answer.

Option D: Recombination at fertilization. Recombination refers to crossing over during meiosis. If during fertilization, homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, this can lead to new combinations of alleles. When a sperm and egg combine, this recombination creates new genetic variations. So D is a source of variation, so it's not the right answer.

So putting it all together, A is the one that's not a source of variation. Because mistakes in translation would affect the proteins produced, not the variation in the organism's DNA itself. It's more about the proteins being different, not the genetic variation. So the correct answer should be A.

The question asks which option is NOT a source of genetic variation contributing to evolution. Genetic variation can arise from errors in DNA replication, translocations, recombination, and mistakes in translation.

- **Option A**: Mistakes in translation of structural genes affect the production of proteins. This does not directly contribute to genetic variation in the organism, as it results in differences in protein products rather than variation in DNA sequences.
- **Option B**: Mistakes in DNA replication lead to mutations, which are variations in DNA sequences. These mutations can introduce new traits, making this a valid source of variation.
- **Option C**: Translocations and errors during meiosis lead to genetic variation by creating new chromosomes or altering existing ones. This is a recognized source of variation.
- **Option D**: Recombination during fertilization by homologous chromosomes results in new genetic combinations, which is a valid source of variation.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as it pertains to protein variation rather than genetic variation in the organism.

**Answer**: A
