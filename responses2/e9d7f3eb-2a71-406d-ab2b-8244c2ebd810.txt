The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.… It is always the people who toil that pay.
—Calvin Coolidge, "Economy in the Interest of All," June 30, 1924

Okay, I need to figure out which of the given presidents would align with Calvin Coolidge's sentiments from his 1924 essay. Let me start by recalling what Coolidge wrote. He talks about how the government's power to impose taxes is tied to the ability of the people to work. He mentions that if taxes aren't necessary and public policy isn't followed, the government becomes a tyrant. He also notes that without proper property taxes, people lose freedom, which is a key point.

So Coolidge is promoting a system where the government doesn't burden the citizens as much as they might, relying instead on the citizens' own resources and the public's ability to function. He's advocating for a more equitable system where the government's role is limited, and instead, the people's contributions are more emphasized.

Looking at the options, I need to see which presidents had a similar stance. Let me go through each one:

A: Dwight Eisenhower. He was a key figure in the Cold War. He was known for his ten-year primesularity, and during the Cold War, he led the U.S. in both war and peace. But I'm not sure if his policies were all about tax abusers. He had a lot of war stuff, so probably not aligned with Coolidge's views.

B: John F. Kennedy. He was a civil rights leader, helped end slavery, and was a Republican. He did some work in the 1960s with the civil rights movement. Coolidge was more about the role of taxes, not so much about civil rights. He was also in the 20th century, so maybe he had differing views. Probably not the best fit.

C: Lyndon B. Johnson. He was the first 43rd President, known for his conservative policies, particularly in the 60s. He was involved in the Cold War and had a lot of economic policies. He was also a civil rights leader. His views were more on the left, maybe more about social programs than taxes. His approach was different; he focused on equality, social welfare, and the economic policies of the 60s. So, not sure if he was as cautious about taxes as Coolidge.

D: George W. Bush. He was a former president with a lot of conservative policies, including tax cuts. Bush was known for his economic policies, like tax cuts and deregulation. But he's also a president, so he's been in office for a long time. However, during his tenure, he was involved in various issues, but I'm not sure if he aligned as strictly with Coolidge's tax restrictions view. He's more on the progressive and economic side. So maybe less aligned.

E: Ronald Reagan. He's a big economic reformer, like Coolidge. He was the CEO of the World Bank and a prominent figure in the post-WWII economy. His main focus was the economic model, trying to make the U.S. a major economic power. He was a proponent of economic growth and has been known to be anti-福利, but I'm not sure if he's as cautious about the role of the government in imposing taxes. He might have been more on the economic and anti-poverty side, which Coolidge's views might have been against. So maybe not the best fit.

F: Bill Clinton. He's a former president, but I'm not sure about his political stance. She's involved in various issues, including the war on drugs, which is a serious issue. However, I'm not certain if her views align with Coolidge's. She's a conservative, but I don't know if she's as cautious about the role of taxes.

G: Barack Obama. He's a modern-day president, former 43rd. He's known for his progressive policies, including tax cuts. He's been a strong advocate for social welfare and has been a vocal proponent of the economy. His stance might align with Coolidge's views, especially regarding taxes. He's been a proponent of progressive taxation and has emphasized that the government plays a lesser role. So this could be a candidate.

H: Franklin D. Roosevelt. He's the father of the Cold War, known for his economic policies, including massive welfare programs and the Great Depression prevention plan. His role was more on the national welfare side, and he was known for his progressive taxation policies. He was a proponent of the "free turkey" approach, which was a form of progressive taxation. Coolidge's views were about the role of the government in imposing taxes, so if Roosevelt was promoting progressive taxation, then maybe he's aligned with Coolidge. He was also a leading conservative, with policies like the New Deal and anti-war activism.

I: Jimmy Carter. He was a former president, but he was known for his tough stance, like the "no kid in the country" policy and his economic policies, including stimulus packages and tax cuts. He was a proponent of progressive taxation, which aligns with Coolidge's view. He was also a strong advocate for the public welfare and social programs.

J: Richard Nixon. He was a leading U.S. czar in the Cold War. He was known for his anti-war policies, like the war on religion and very conservative views. He also had policies that were more on the environmental side, like the Little House in the Hill. His views were more aligned with the New Deal and anti-war. So probably not the same as Coolidge.

Looking back at the options, the best fit would be someone whose stance was similar to Coolidge's. Coolidge's main point was that if the government imposes taxes without rational reasons, it becomes a tyrant. He believed that the people's own resources (like property and income) should be the primary sources of revenue, not the government imposing taxes. So who was advocating for this?

Barack Obama, as a modern-day president, would have policies that support progressive taxation, which is a key alignment with Coolidge. He also supports social welfare and the middle class, which are important in his view.

Franklin D. Roosevelt was a big proponent of progressive taxation, as he implemented the "Great Depression prevention" program and other progressive policies. So he's aligned with Coolidge's stance.

Jimmy Carter was also a proponent of progressive taxation and support for the middle class, aligning with Coolidge's views.

But the question is which of the given presidents would share Coolidge's sentiments. So all of the above (Barack Obama, Frank Roosevelt, Jimmy Carter) might be possible.

Wait, let's think again. Coolidge's ideas were about the role of the government in imposing taxes. He said that if taxes aren't necessary or sound public policy is not followed, the government becomes a tyrant. So he's concerned that the government doesn't use its tax power to serve the people effectively.

In the given options, the ones who advocate for progressive taxation would align.

Barack Obama: Known for progressive taxation, as he's a proponent of the "free turkey" approach.

Franklin Roosevelt: He was a proponent of progressive taxation, as he implemented various welfare programs and tax cuts.

Jimmy Carter: He was a proponent of progressive taxation and anti-inequality.

So all three of these would align. But let's look at the options again.

Wait, the question is asking which of these presidents would be most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments.

Wait, according to what I remember, Coolidge's views were that the government shouldn't impose taxes based on urgent necessity or sound public policy. Instead, the people's own resources should be utilized for public purposes. So, he was against the idea of imposing taxes on people unless it's necessary and justified by public policy.

So, the correct answer would be the one who is a proponent of progressive taxation and aligns with this view.

Looking at the options, the three that are proponent of progressive taxation are:

Barack Obama,

Franklin Roosevelt,

Jimmy Carter.

Wait, but let's think about each:

Barack Obama is a modern president. He is known for his progressive policies, including progressive taxation on Social Security, and he's been a strong advocate for the middle class.

Franklin D. Roosevelt was a leading conservative, known for progressive taxation, anti-war policies, and anti-福利.

Jimmy Carter was a Cold War leader. He was a proponent of progressive taxation and the middle class.

So, any of these three would align with Coolidge's view.

But the question is about a single answer. Wait, looking at the options, there are multiple possible correct answers, but the user is asking which of the provided presidents would be most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments.

Wait, but let's check the options again:

Options:

A: Dwight D. Eisenhower — probably not, because he was more about war and the Cold War.

B: John F. Kennedy — was a civil rights leader and perhaps more focused on social welfare.

C: Lyndon B. Johnson — more on civil rights.

D: George W. Bush — more on economic policies, perhaps more progressive.

E: Ronald Reagan — proponent of economic growth, anti-福利.

F: Bill Clinton — perhaps more on drug war.

G: Barack Obama — modern, proponent.

H: Franklin D. Roosevelt — classic proponent.

I: Jimmy Carter — classic proponent.

J: Richard Nixon — opposed to war, anti-war.

So, in the options, the three that are most aligned with Coolidge's view would be:

Barack Obama,

Franklin D. Roosevelt,

Jimmy Carter.

But the question is asking which of the following would be most likely. Since all three are possible, but the options are single choice, perhaps the answer is not among the options.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which of the provided presidents would share Coolidge's sentiments. So, the correct answer would be any of the three. But looking back, perhaps one of them is the right answer.

Wait, the options are multiple choice, but the user is asking to pick one. Looking again, perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, the correct answer is B, John F. Kennedy. Wait, no, because JFK was a civil rights leader. He was proponent of the "people in power" model and anti-war, anti-fairness. So his views are more aligned with Coolidge, but not sure.

Alternatively, I think that the answer is B. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about each option in terms of their policies.

Barack Obama: Proponent of progressive taxation, as he's been a strong advocate for the middle class and social programs. He's been a leading president, so he's a modern version of Coolidge's proponent.

Franklin Roosevelt: Known for progressive taxation, as he implemented the "Great Depression prevention" program and other progressive measures.

Jimmy Carter: He was a proponent of progressive taxation and the middle class, as he had a lot of progressive policies.

So all three would align with Coolidge's views.

But the question is about the correct answer. Since the user is asking which of the following would be most likely, perhaps the answer is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the options provided in the question are all given. So, the correct answer is probably B, John F. Kennedy? Or one of the others.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the exact content of Coolidge's essay.

In "Economy in the Interest of All," he talks about the role of the government in imposing taxes. He argues that if the government imposes taxes without rational reasons, it becomes tyrant-like. He emphasizes that the people should use their own resources for public purposes, like taxes.

So, candidates who are for progressive taxation and support the middle class (or the people's own resources) would align.

So, the correct answer would be the person who is a proponent of progressive taxation.

The options are:

B: John F. Kennedy — known for civil rights, which is different.

C: Lyndon B. Johnson — civil rights, earlier.

G: Barack Obama — modern.

H: Franklin D. Roosevelt — proponent.

I: Jimmy Carter — proponent.

So, all three are proponent.

But in the context of the question, which of the following would share Coolidge's sentiments.

Wait, but the question is for a quiz, so only one answer is correct. Let me think again.

Perhaps the answer is B, because JFK was a civil rights leader who didn't align with the progressive taxation view, but maybe he's a proponent of social welfare.

Wait, but the question is about the sentiments of Coolidge, which are about the role of taxes, not social welfare.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the essay is about the role of the government in imposing taxes. Coolidge's key point is the necessity of the tax and sound public policy. He argues that if the tax is imposed without rational reasons, it's a tyrant.

So, the correct answer would be the one who supports progressive taxation and avoids imposing taxes on the people as a burden unless justified.

So, any of the three (Barack Obama, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jimmy Carter) would be correct. But the options given are:

A: D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Wait, no, the options are the letters A through J, numbered 1 to 11.

Looking back, option H is Franklin D. Roosevelt.

So, the correct answer is H, because he's a modern progressive politician, proponent of progressive taxation.

Wait, but the original prompt says "which of the following presidents would be most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments?"

So, all three are correct, but since the options are given as A to J, and the question is to pick one, perhaps the answer is B, which is John F. Kennedy.

Wait, no. I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach.

The answer choices are:

A: Dwight D. Eisenhower

B: John F. Kennedy

C: Lyndon B. Johnson

D: George W. Bush

E: Ronald Reagan

F: Bill Clinton

G: Barack Obama

H: Franklin D. Roosevelt

I: Jimmy Carter

J: Richard Nixon

The correct answer is the one who is proponent of progressive taxation, and aligned with Coolidge's view.

So, the correct answer is H, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Because he's known for progressive taxation and anti-inequality.

Alternatively, I'm not sure because I might be conflating the specifics.

Wait, actually, I think the correct answer is B, John F. Kennedy. No, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The key point Coolidge made is that the government shouldn't impose taxes on people unless it's justified by public policy. So, the era where the government used its tax power for the people's benefit.

In that context, all modern-day leaders would support progressive taxation, which is Coolidge's view.

So, the answer is likely H, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in the essay, Coolidge is concerned about the government imposing taxes without a solid reason, like the "people in power" model. So, the modern leaders are proponent of that.

So, the correct answer is H, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Wait, but in the given options, that's option H.

But wait, the options are A to J, each being a single president.

So, the correct answer is H, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

But wait, let me confirm. The options include H as Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Yes, so H is the answer.
</think>

The question asks which of the given presidents would align with Calvin Coolidge's sentiments, who viewed the government's role in imposing taxes as a means to serve the people without unnecessary burden or sound public policy. Coolidge emphasized the importance of the "people in power" model and the use of taxes for the public good, advocating against the use of taxes to impose burdens on the people.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Dwight D. Eisenhower** - He was a key figure in the Cold War and focused on war and security, not aligning with Coolidge's views.
- **B: John F. Kennedy** - A civil rights leader, he opposed the "people in power" model and anti-war policies, differing from Coolidge.
- **C: Lyndon B. Johnson** - A conservative, proponent of social programs, but not aligned with Coolidge's tax focus.
- **D: George W. Bush** - A former president with progressive policies but not a modernist aligning with Coolidge.
- **E: Ronald Reagan** - A proponent of economic growth and anti-fairness, opposed to Coolidge's tax approach.
- **F: Bill Clinton** - A former president with controversial policies, not directly tied to Coolidge.
- **G: Barack Obama** - A modern-day president with progressive taxation and middle-class policies, aligning with Coolidge.
- **H: Franklin D. Roosevelt** - A leader in the 1930s with progressive taxation, anti-inequality, and support for the public welfare, aligning with Coolidge.
- **I: Jimmy Carter** - A Cold War leader with progressive policies, aligning with Coolidge.
- **J: Richard Nixon** - A conservative, opposed to war and anti-福利, not aligned with Coolidge.

Both **H: Franklin D. Roosevelt** and **G: Barack Obama** and **I: Jimmy Carter** align with Coolidge's views on progressive taxation and the "people in power" model. However, since the question asks for a single answer, the most modern and direct alignment with Coolidge's principles is **H: Franklin D. Roosevelt**, as he was a proponent of progressive taxation and the middle class in the 1930s.

ANSWER: H
