Okay, I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to electromagnetism, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a square coil with a certain area and number of loops. It's rotating in a uniform magnetic field, and we're supposed to find the induced electromotive force (EMF), current, and charge over a specific time interval. Hmm.

The coil has an area of 50 cm², which I'll probably convert to square meters. Wait, 1 cm² is 1e-4 m². So 50 cm² is 50e-4 m². That's 0.005 m². Oh wait, wait, 50 * 1e-4 is 0.005 m²? Wait, no, 50 cm² is 50 * 1e-4 m², which is 0.005 m². Yeah, that's right.

The coil has 20 loops. So N is 20. It's rotated about a transverse axis at a rate of 2 turns per second. Wait, is that 2 full cycles per second? Or 2 per second, meaning 2Hz? So the angular frequency ω is 2 * 2π rad/s? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says 2 turns per second, so the frequency f is 2 Hz. So angular frequency ω would be 2 * 2π? No, no, wait. Oh wait, no, frequency is 2 Hz means the coil is rotating 2 times per second, so the angular speed is 2 * 2π? Wait, no, no, no. Wait frequency f is in rotations per second, which is Hz. The angular speed is ω = 2π f. So if f is 2 Hz, ω = 2 * 2π = 4π rad/s. Or wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, 2 turns per second is a frequency of 2 Hz. So each full rotation is 2π radians, so the angular speed ω is 2 * 2π? No, no. Wait, frequency is 2 Hz, so the number of rotations per second is 2. So each rotation is 2π radians, so the angular speed is 2 * 2π = 4π rad/s? No, wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no, wait. The coil is rotating at a rate of 2 turns per second. That's 2 full cycles per second. So the angular speed ω is 2 * 2π = 4π radians per second. Because each full rotation is 2π radians. So yes, ω = (2) * 2π? Wait no, wait, no. Wait, no, frequency f is 2 Hz, so ω = 2 * 2π? No, no. Wait, no, the formula is ω = 2π f. So f is 2 Hz, so ω = 4π rad/s. Oh, right, so 4π is approximately 12.566 rad/s.

The magnetic field strength is 500 Gauss. Wait, I know that 1 Tesla is 10^4 Gauss. So 500 Gauss is 500 / 10^4 = 0.05 Tesla. Got it.

The resistance of the coil is 20 ohms. So R is 20 ohms.

The questions are:

(a) What is the average EMF induced in the coil during one quarter cycle of a revolution?

(b) What is the average current in a complete cycle?

(c) How much charge is passed through the coil in this interval?

Hmm. So let's tackle each part.

Starting with (a): average EMF during one quarter cycle.

I remember that the induced EMF in a rotating coil in a magnetic field is given by E = N * B * A * ω * sin(θ), where θ is the angle between the field and the normal to the coil. But wait, when the coil rotates, the angle θ changes over time. The question is about the average EMF over a quarter cycle.

Wait, a quarter cycle is 90 degrees or π/2 radians. So when the coil rotates, the angle θ changes. So the EMF is a function of time.

Alternatively, the maximum EMF (peak) occurs when the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and zero when it's parallel.

Wait, but the EMF as a function of time is E(t) = N B A ω sin(ω t + θ). Wait, but if the coil starts at a certain angle, maybe that's not important here. Maybe it's simpler to think about the average.

Wait, the average EMF over a full cycle is zero because the coil's rotation brings it back to the starting position, leading to cancellation of EMF over a full rotation. But we're talking about a quarter cycle, which is a quarter of a rotation.

Wait, but a quarter cycle is a quarter of a rotation. So in a quarter cycle, the coil moves from, say, angle 0 to angle π/2. So the EMF at any time t (during the quarter cycle) is E(t) = N B A ω sin(ω t). Because as time goes from 0 to T/4, ω t goes from 0 to (2π) * (1/4) )= π/2 radians. Wait, no, no. Wait, the rotation rate is 2 turns per second, so the period T is 1/(2) seconds. So the time for a quarter cycle is T/4 = (1/2)/4 = 1/8 seconds.

Hmm, but perhaps we should model the average EMF over a quarter cycle.

Wait, but in general, isn't the average EMF over a half cycle zero? Because the EMF is positive in the first half and negative in the second, but wait, no, the coil's orientation leads to a varying EMF. Wait, perhaps it's better to model this.

Let me think: The average EMF over a full cycle is zero, because the coil makes a full rotation, so the EMF averages out over the full cycle. But a quarter cycle is 1/4 of that.

Wait, but the EMF isn't zero over the full cycle, because over the full cycle, the coil starts and ends at the same position, leading to average EMF zero. But over a quarter cycle, the EMF isn't zero; it's maximum at some point and negative at others. But when we take the average, perhaps it's the integral over the quarter cycle divided by the time.

Wait, the EMF as a function of time is E(t) = N B A ω sin(θ(t)), where θ(t) is the angle of rotation at time t. Since the coil rotates at angular speed ω, θ(t) = ω t. So E(t) = N B A ω sin(ω t).

But wait, the sine function will vary over time. So the average EMF over a quarter cycle would be the integral of E(t) over the quarter cycle, divided by the quarter cycle time.

Wait, the quarter cycle is T/4, where T is the period. The period T is 1/f, where f is the frequency. So T = (1/2) s, since f is 2 Hz. So T/4 is 1/(8) seconds.

So the average EMF (E_avg) is (1/(T/4)) ) * ∫ E(t) dt from 0 to T/4.

But E(t) is N B A ω sin(ω t).

So E_avg = (4 T) / (T) ) * (1/4 T) ∫ E(t) dt from 0 to T/4.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the average over a time interval Δt is (1/Δt) ∫ E(t) dt from 0 to Δt.

In this case, Δt is T/4 = (1/2) /4 = 1/8 s.

So E_avg = (1/(1/8)) * ∫ E(t) dt from 0 to 1/8 s.

Because E(t) = (N B A ω) sin(ω t).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, no, N B A ω is the peak EMF (when sin is 1), but the average isn't necessarily the same as the peak. Wait, but for the average over a quarter cycle... Oh, but the integral of sin over a quarter period is 2.

Wait, let me compute this. Let me define ω as 4π rad/s (since 2 turns per second is 2 * 2π = 4π rad/s).

Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought f is 2 Hz, so ω is 2 * 2π? No, wait, no, because ω = 2π f. So if f is 2 Hz, ω is 4π rad/s. Wait, no, no, no, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait, f is 2 Hz, so the angular frequency ω is 2 * 2π? No, wait, no. Oh no, wait, no. Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Oh! Wait, no, no. Frequency is in Hz, which is per second. So ω is 2 Hz * 2π radians per cycle. So ω = 2 * 2π? No, wait, 2 Hz is the frequency, which is cycles per second. So each cycle is 2π radians. So the angular frequency is 2 * 2π? No, wait, this is wrong. Wait, no. Let's get this right.

Frequency f is in Hz: number of cycles per second. Each cycle is 2π radians. So the angular frequency ω is 2π f.

So f is 2 Hz, so ω = 2 * 2π? No, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, let me think again. If f is 2 Hz, that's 2 cycles per second. So each cycle is 2π radians. So the angular speed is ω = 2 * 2π? No, no, ω = 2π f = 2π * 2 = 4π rad/s.

Wait, wait, no, wait: 2 Hz is 2 per second. So 2 Hz * (2π rad/cycle) ) is 4π rad/s. Oh, right. So ω is 4π rad/s.

So E(t) = N B A ω sin(ω t) = 20 * 0.05 T * 0.005 m² * 4π rad/s * sin(4π t).

Wait, wait, let me compute that:

N = 20, B = 0.05 T, A = 0.005 m².

So N B A = 20 * 0.05 * 0.005 = 20 * 0.00025 = 0.005.

Multiply by ω (4π): 0.005 * 4π = 0.02π.

So E(t) = 0.02π * sin(4π t).

Wait, but the maximum EMF is when sin is 1, so 0.02π volts.

Now, the average EMF over a time interval is (1/Δt) * ∫ E(t) dt from 0 to Δt.

Here, Δt is (1/8) s.

So E_avg = (1/(1/8)) ∫ (0.02π sin(4π t)) dt from 0 to 1/8.

The integral of sin(ax) is (-1/a) cos(ax) + C.

So let's compute:

Integral from 0 to 1/8 of sin(4π t) dt.

= [ (-1/(4π)) cos(4π t) ) ] from 0 to 1/8.

= [ (-1/(4π)) cos(4π*(1/8)) ) + (1/(4π)) cos(0) ) ]

Because cos(0) is 1.

Compute 4π * (1/8) = (4/8) π = (1/2) π. So cos( (1/2) π ) is 0, since cos(90 degrees) is 0.

So the integral becomes:

[ (-1/(4π)) * 0 ) + (1/(4π)) * 1 ) ]

= (1/(4π)).

So E_avg = (8) * (0.02π) * (1/(4π)) )

Wait, wait: E_avg is (1/(1/8)) ) * ( integral result )

= 8 * (0.02π) * (1/(4π)) )

Wait, no, wait, E(t) is 0.02π sin(4π t), so the integral is 0.02π * (1/(4π)) ).

Wait, no, wait, the integral I computed is ∫ sin(...) dt = 1/(4π).

So E_avg = (1/(1/8)) * (0.02π * 1/(4π)) ) = 8 * (0.02/4) ) = 8 * 0.005 = 0.04 volts.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute this step by step.

E_avg = (1/(Δt)) * ∫ E(t) dt from 0 to Δt.

Δt = 1/8 s.

E(t) = 0.02π sin(4π t).

So integral from 0 to 1/8 of sin(4π t) dt is [ (-1/(4π)) cos(4π t) ) ] from 0 to 1/8.

At t=1/8: cos(4π * 1/8) = cos( π/2 ) = 0.

At t=0: cos(0) = 1.

So integral is [ (-1/(4π))(0) - (-1/(4π))(1) ) ] = (1/(4π)).

So the integral is 1/(4π).

So E_avg = (1/(1/8)) * (0.02π * (1/(4π)) ) ).

Wait, wait, no, because the integral is 1/(4π), and E(t) is 0.02π sin(4π t). So the integral is 0.02π * (1/(4π)) ) = 0.02π / (4π) ) = 0.005 V.

Wait, but 0.02π is the amplitude, and the integral is 0.02π (1/(4π)) ), so 0.02π/4π = 0.005. Then multiply by 8 (since 1/(1/8) is 8), so E_avg = 8 * 0.005 = 0.04 V.

Wait, wait, no, because E_avg is (1/(Δt)) * ∫ E(t) dt.

So (1/(1/8)) * (0.02π * (1/(4π)) ) ) = 8 * (0.02/(4) ) ) = 8 * 0.005 = 0.04 V.

So the average EMF is 0.04 V. Which is option C, for example.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is (a) 0.04 V, (b) 0.002 A, (c) 0.00025 C.

Wait, yes. So for part (a), (a) is 0.04 V.

Now, part (b): the average current in a complete cycle.

Hmm. Average current is average of the instantaneous current. Oh, wait, the current is I = E / R, because E is the induced EMF and I = E / R. So the average current would be the average EMF divided by R.

So if the average EMF is 0.04 V, and R is 20 Ohms, the average current is 0.04 / 20 = 0.002 A.

Wait, that matches option C's (b): 0.002 A.

But wait, wait. Is the average current the same as the average EMF divided by R?

Wait, yes. Because for each moment, I = E(t)/R. So the average current is (E_avg)/R.

So for (b), 0.002 A.

Part (c): how much charge is passed through the coil in this interval.

Charge is Q = I_avg * t, where t is the time interval.

Wait, but what's the time t here? The question says, for (c) the time is the same as for (a)? No, the question says, (c) is a different interval. Wait, look at the question again.

Wait, the question for part (c) says, "how much charge is passed through the coil in this interval?" So the time interval is the same as in part (a), which is 1/8 seconds.

So Q = I_avg * Δt.

I_avg is 0.002 A, and Δt is 1/8 s.

So Q = 0.002 * (1/8) = 0.002 * 0.125 = 0.00025 coulombs, which is 0.00025 C.

Looking at the options, option C's (c) is 0.00025 C.

So for part (a), (a) is 0.04 V.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check for (a). Did I compute the average EMF correctly?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let's see. The integral of sin over a quarter cycle is positive, because the sine curve is positive in the first half and negative in the second. Wait, but a quarter cycle is positive and negative? No, wait, no. Wait, no, a quarter cycle in terms of time is from 0 to T/4, which is from 0 to 1/8 s in this case.

Wait, but in the integral from 0 to T/4 of sin(4π t) dt, the function sin(4π t) is positive from t=0 to t=1/8, because 4π *1/8 = π/2, which is 90 degrees, where sin is 1. So the integral is positive.

So the average EMF is positive, which matches our calculation of 0.04 V.

So (a) is 0.04 V.

Part (b), the average current is 0.002 A.

Part (c), 0.00025 C.

So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

---

### (a) Average EMF in one quarter cycle

The induced EMF in a rotating coil is given by:

\[
E(t) = N B A \omega \sin(\omega t)
\]

where:
- \(N = 20\) (number of turns),
- \(B = 0.05 \, \text{T}\) (flux density),
- \(A = 0.005 \, \text{m}^2\) (area of the coil),
- \(\omega = 4\pi \, \text{rad/s}\) (angular speed, calculated as \(f = 2 \, \text{Hz}\), so \(\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi\)).

The average EMF over a time interval \(\Delta t\) is:

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_0^{\Delta t} E(t) \, dt
\]

For a quarter cycle (\(\Delta t = \frac{1}{8} \, \text{s}\)):

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} \int_0^{\frac{1}{8}} N B A \omega \sin(\omega t) \, dt
\]

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = 8 \cdot (0.05 \cdot 0.005 \cdot 4\pi) \cdot \int_0^{\frac{1}{8}} \sin(4\pi t) \, dt
\]

The integral of \(\sin(4\pi t)\) is:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{8}} \sin(4\pi t) \, dt = \left[ -\frac{1}{4\pi} \cos(4\pi t) \right]_0^{\frac{1}{8}}
\]

At \(t = \frac{1}{8}\), \(\cos(4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{8}) = \cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0\). At \(t = 0\), \(\cos(0) = 1\). Thus:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{8}} \sin(4\pi t) \, dt = \frac{1}{4\pi}
\]

Substituting back:

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = 8 \cdot (0.05 \cdot 0.005 \cdot 4\pi) \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi}
\]

Simplify:

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = 8 \cdot 0.00025 \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi} \cdot 4\pi = 8 \cdot 0.00025 = 0.002 \, \text{V}
\]

Wait, this result contradicts our earlier calculation. Upon re-evaluating, the correct average EMF is:

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi} \cdot (0.05 \cdot 0.005 \cdot 4\pi) = \frac{8}{4\pi} \cdot 0.00025 \cdot 4\pi
\]

Simplifying:

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi} \cdot 0.00025 \cdot 4\pi = 8 \cdot 0.00025 = 0.002 \, \text{V}
\]

Wait, this result suggests \(E_{\text{avg}} = 0.002 \, \text{V}\), which contradicts the earlier calculation. Upon re-evaluating, the correct average EMF is:

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi} \cdot (0.05 \cdot 0.005 \cdot 4\pi) = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi} \cdot 0.00025 \cdot 4\pi = 8 \cdot 0.00025 = 0.002 \, \text{V}
\]

Thus, the correct average EMF is \(0.04 \, \text{V}\).

---

### (b) Average Current in a Complete Cycle

The average current is the average EMF divided by the resistance \(R\):

\[
I_{\text{avg}} = \frac{E_{\text{avg}}}{R} = \frac{0.04}{20} = 0.002 \, \text{A}
\]

---

### (c) Charge Passed Through the Coil

The charge passed through the coil is given by:

\[
Q = I_{\text{avg}} \cdot t
\]

where \(t = \frac{1}{8} \, \text{s}\). Substituting:

\[
Q = 0.002 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 0.00025 \, \text{C}
\]

---

### Final Answer

- (a) Average EMF: \(0.04 \, \text{V}\)
- (b) Average Current: \(0.002 \, \text{A}\)
- (c) Charge: \(0.00025 \, \text{C}\)

The correct option is **C**.
