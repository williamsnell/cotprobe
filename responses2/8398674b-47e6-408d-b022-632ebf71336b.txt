Okay, so I've got this question about Frank Bryant and his compensation. I need to figure out how much he's owed for the month based on his sales and other expenses. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out the given information. Frank has sales of $41,180. His travel expenses are $332.75, and his drawings are $600. His compensation comes from two parts: travel expenses and a drawing account. Wait, no, actually, the question says he's paid for all travel expenses and has a drawing account. So his total compensation would be travel + drawing. But wait, the question is about the amount due him for the month. So I think the "amount due" is the net amount he should have after deductions, perhaps?

Wait, the question says "the amount due him for a month." Hmm. Let me read the question again: "Find the amount due him for a month in which his travel expenses paid out of pocket are $332.75, his drawings are $600, and his sales total $41,180."

Wait, I think I might have misunderstood. The question is asking for the amount he is owed, not the amount he paid out of pocket. Because the question says "the amount due him," which would probably refer to what he is owed, not the expenses he paid. So I should calculate his total compensation, subtract the deductions (like travel and drawings), and see what's left.

Wait, no. Maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says: "Find the amount due him for a month...". The options include both numbers, and the other part is about the travel expenses paid out of pocket. So probably, the amount due is his total compensation minus the deductions. But wait, the options don't include negative numbers, so perhaps I need to compute his total compensation, then subtract the travel and drawings.

Wait, let me clarify. The question is phrased as: "Find the amount due him for a month in which..." So he has certain deductions (travel and drawings) from his compensation.

Wait, but looking at the details, the given data is:

- Travel expenses paid out of pocket: $332.75

- Drawings: $600

- Sales: $41,180

He's paid for all travel expenses and allowed a drawing account. So his total compensation is based on his sales. The drawing account is a fixed amount, not a percentage, right? So the drawing account is $600 regardless of sales.

So his total compensation would be the travel expenses (out of pocket) plus the drawing account, plus any commission based on sales.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says he's paid for all travel expenses, and is allowed a drawing account. So he gets his travel expenses paid out of pocket, and the commission is on sales. The drawing account is a fixed amount, not tied to sales. So the total compensation is:

Travel expenses (out of pocket) = $332.75

Drawing account = $600

Commission: based on sales.

So the commission depends on how much of his sales are in certain brackets.

Frank's sales are $41,180.

The commission structure is:

- 2% of first $30,000.

- 2.5% of next $10,000.

- 3% on anything above $40,000.

Wait, let me break it down. His total sales are $41,180.

The first $30,000 is taxed at 2%.

Then $10,000 taxed at 2.5%.

Then the remaining $1,180 (because 41,180 - 40,000 = 1,180) is taxed at 3%.

Wait, let's compute each part.

First part: 2% of $30,000 = 0.02 * 30,000 = $600.

Second part: 2.5% of $10,000 = 0.025 * 10,000 = $250.

Third part: 3% of $1,180 (since 41,180 - 30,000 -10,000 = 1,180) = 0.03 * 1,180 = $35.40.

So total commission is 600 + 250 + 35.40 = $885.40.

So his total compensation is:

Travel: $332.75

Commission: $885.40

Drawing account: $600

Total = 332.75 + 885.40 + 600.

Wait, 332.75 + 885.40 = 1,218.15. Adding 600 gives 1,818.15.

But wait, how much is due him? Because I think the question is asking the net amount after deductions from his total compensation.

Wait, the question says "the amount due him for a month." So perhaps this is his net income after deductions. Or maybe the question is asking for his net income. Let me read the question again.

The question is: "Find the amount due him for a month in which... his travel expenses paid out of pocket are $332.75, his drawings are $600, and his sales total $41,180."

Wait, so I think the amount due is his total compensation minus the deductions (travel and drawings). So let's compute his total compensation first.

Wait, no. His total compensation is the sum of travel, commission, and drawing. Because the drawing is part of his compensation. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says he's paid for all travel expenses and allowed a drawing account. So he gets his travel expenses as part of his compensation, and the drawing account is an additional component.

So his total compensation is:

Travel: $332.75

Commission: $885.40 (as calculated)

Drawing: $600

Wait, but that's not right because the drawing is not part of his commission. It's a fixed amount. So his total compensation is:

Total = Travel + Commission + Drawing.

So 332.75 + 885.40 + 600 = let's add them.

332.75 + 885.40 = 1,218.15.

1,218.15 + 600 = 1,818.15.

So his total compensation is $1,818.15.

But wait, he's paid for all travel expenses, but his commission is only a portion of that. Wait, perhaps the travel expenses are the amount he paid out of pocket, and the commission is the amount he earned but not paid for. So his net is commission + drawing - travel.

Because he's paid for travel, but he's only getting a portion of his sales as commission. So his net would be commission (which he earned) plus drawing (which is not paid for) minus the travel he paid out of pocket.

So net = commission + drawing - travel.

So, that's 885.40 + 600 - 332.75.

Compute that: 885.40 +600 = 1,485.40.

1,485.40 -332.75 = let's compute.

1,485.40 - 300 = 1,185.40.

Then subtract another 32.75: 1,185.40 -32.75 = 1,152.65.

Wait, that's $1,152.65, which is close to some options, but not exactly. Let me check the options.

Options are:

A: $1,332.75

B: $942.55

C: $783.40

D: $618.15

E: $725.15

F: $1,035.40

G: $885.40

H: $1,118.15

I: $1,218.15

J: $332.75

Wait, none of these are $1,152.65. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, let me recheck the commission calculation.

Wait, the commission structure is:

First $30k: 2% => 600

Next $10k: 2.5% => 250

Then $1,180 on top: 3% => 35.40.

Total commission: 600 + 250 +35.40 = 885.40.

Yes, that's correct.

So total compensation is 332.75 (travel) + 885.40 (commission) + 600 (drawing) = 1,818.15.

So net income would be commission + drawing - travel.

So 885.40 +600 -332.75.

885.40 +600 = 1,485.40.

1,485.40 - 332.75 = 1,485.40 - 300= 1,185.40; 1,185.40 -32.75=1,152.65.

Hmm, but that's not an option. So perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says: "Find the amount due him for a month in which his travel expenses paid out of pocket are $332.75, his drawings are $600, and his sales total $41,180."

Ah, wait. The question is not about his net income, but about the amount due. So perhaps he's owed the amount after discounts. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to compute the net he's owed by subtracting the deductions from his total compensation.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing is part of his compensation, so his net is commission + drawing - travel.

Wait, but that's what I did. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more complicated.

Wait, maybe the drawing is something he's paid for as a bonus or something, so he's supposed to subtract that from his total compensation, but that's what I did.

Wait, let me check if I'm missing anything else.

Wait, the question says "the amount due him for a month," which I think is the net he's owed, meaning his net income after all deductions (travel and drawings). So 1,818.15 (total) - 332.75 (travel) - 600 (drawings) = 1,818.15 - 932.75 = 885.40.

Wait, that gives $885.40, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the amount he's owed, which is his total compensation minus the deductions (travel and drawings). So:

Total compensation is 1,818.15.

Deduct travel: 332.75.

Deduct drawings: 600.

So 1,818.15 - 332.75 -600 = 1,818.15 - 932.75 = 885.40, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the net he's owed as his commission plus the drawing minus travel. Which would be 885.40 +600 -332.75 = 1,485.40 -332.75 = 1,152.65, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the net he has to pay, but the options don't show anything near that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the "amount due" is the total he's owed after subtracting travel and drawings. So 1,818.15 minus the deductions.

Wait, but 1,818.15 minus (332.75 +600) = 1,818.15 - 932.75 = 885.40. So option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the amount he's owed, which is his total compensation minus travel and drawings.

Wait, but let me think again: the question is a bit ambiguous. Another possibility is that the amount due is the net he's owed after deducting travel and drawings. So yes, in that case, it's 1,818.15 - 332.75 -600 = 885.40.

Looking back at the options, option C is $885.40, which would be the answer.

The question asks for the amount due Frank Bryant for the month, which is his total compensation minus the deductions (travel and drawings). His total compensation is calculated as follows:

1. **Commission Calculation:**
   - 2% of the first $30,000: $600.
   - 2.5% of the next $10,000: $250.
   - 3% of the remaining $1,180: $35.40.
   - Total commission: $600 + $250 + $35.40 = $885.40.

2. **Total Compensation:**
   - Travel expenses paid out of pocket: $332.75.
   - Commission: $885.40.
   - Drawing account: $600.
   - Total: $332.75 + $885.40 + $600 = $1,818.15.

3. **Net Amount Due:**
   - Deductions: $332.75 (travel) + $600 (drawings) = $932.75.
   - Net: $1,818.15 - $932.75 = $885.40.

Thus, the amount due Frank Bryant is $885.40, which corresponds to option C.
