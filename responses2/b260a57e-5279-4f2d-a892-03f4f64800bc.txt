Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see. The problem states that there's a seal over a circular hole in the side of an aquarium tank. The hole has a diameter of 1 cm, so that's 0.01 meters. The water level is 1 m above the hole, which I think means the height is 100 cm. The tank is on a smooth plastic surface, so probably friction is negligible.

When the seal overcomes the pressure, it causes the water to spill out. But the question is about the force the attendant needs to apply to stop the tank from moving. Hmm. So I remember that when a liquid is flowing out of a hole, Bernoulli's equation or Torricelli's law might come into play. But wait, this is about stopping the tank, so maybe it's more about the force due to the water's resistance, like an impulse or something.

Wait, the tank is on a smooth surface. So if the tank is about to spill, the water's pressure would push it back. But the problem is asking about the force needed to prevent it from moving. So maybe it's the force required to stop the tank from moving. Or perhaps the force that would counteract the movement once the water starts spilling.

I think this is a problem involving the force needed to stop the tank. So when the water starts spilling, the tank would start moving back. The attendant must apply a force to stop it. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the system here.

The tank is on a smooth surface, so friction is zero. But once the water starts spilling, the tank might exert a force on the water, which in turn exerts an equal and opposite force on the tank (Newton's third law). But wait, the water would start to spill, so the tank might be applying a downward force on the water, which is the opposite of the water's reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the tank's motion is due to the water's pressure. The water pressure at the hole creates a force, which might cause the tank to move. But how? It's in the tank, so if the pressure causes it to accelerate, the attendant would need a force to stop it.

Wait, but the tank's motion depends on the force from the water. The water's initial velocity as it exits the hole can be calculated using Torricelli's law. Torricelli's formula says that the speed v = sqrt(2gh), where g is 9.8 m/s² and h is the height of the water. Here, h is 1 m.

So v = sqrt(2 * 9.8 * 1) = sqrt(19.6) ≈ 4.427 m/s.

But the tank is on a smooth surface, so friction is zero, so once the water starts spilling, the tank would start moving due to the initial acceleration. But wait, does the tank's movement cause any force on the water beyond the initial pressure?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just about the force that the water exerts on the tank, which would be the force required to stop the tank from moving. But that doesn't quite make sense because the water is pushing down on the tank.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the pressure exerted on the tank. The pressure at the hole is P = rho * g * h, where rho is the density of water (1000 kg/m³), and h is 1 m. So P = 1000 * 9.8 * 1 = 9800 Pa.

The force exerted by the water on the hole would be force = P * A, where A is the area of the hole. The hole is circular with diameter 1 cm, so radius is 0.5 cm, which is 0.005 meters. Area A is πr² = π*(0.005)^2 ≈ 0.0000785 m².

So force on the hole is 9800 * 0.0000785 ≈ let's calculate this. 9800 * 7.85e-5 = 9800 * (7.85e-5) = 0.77, approximately 0.77 N. So about 0.77 N.

Wait, but that's the force on the hole. But the question is about the force the attendant must apply to stop the tank. So if the tank is moving, the force would have to counter the momentum change. Alternatively, perhaps it's the force that the water exerts on the tank, which would be equal to the momentum change over time, but that's more about impulse.

Wait, but when the seal causes the water to spill, the tank might start moving. The force needed to stop it would be the force that the water exerts on the tank. But wait, the water is exerting an equal and opposite force on the tank. But the tank is on a smooth surface, so maybe the force due to the water's pressure (the force from the hole) is what the tank needs to apply force against.

Alternatively, the tank's motion is due to the water's pressure, and the force required to stop it would be the force that the water's pressure exerts on the tank. But wait, that's just the force from the hole. But the tank's motion might have a momentum, and the force would change its momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the force is the pressure multiplied by the area, but that's the force on the hole, which we calculated as about 0.77 N.

Wait, looking at the options, 0.77 N is close to option H (0.78 N). So that's one possibility.

But let's think again. When the water flows out, the tank might start moving because it's in contact with the water. The force that the water exerts (the force on the tank) would be the force that's equal and opposite to the force the tank exerts on the water. So the tank's force is equal to the force from the hole. So the force needed to stop the tank would be equal to the force the water exerts on the tank, which is 0.77 N.

But wait, another approach: the water's force on the tank is due to the pressure at the hole. So the pressure is P = rho g h. The force is P * A (area of the hole). So F = 1000 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s² * 1 m * π*(0.005 m)^2.

Wait, let's compute it again. 

P = 1000 * 9.8 * 1 = 9800 Pa.

A = π*(0.005)^2 = π*(0.000025) )= 0.0000785398 m².

F = 9800 * 0.0000785398 ≈ 0.77 N.

So about 0.77 N. So the force the attendant must apply to stop the tank would be this, so option H is 0.78 N.

But wait, another thought. The problem is about a circular hole. The tank is on a smooth surface, so perhaps once the water starts spilling, the tank's mass is moving, and the attendant needs to apply a force to prevent that movement.

Wait, but the tank is on a smooth surface, so if it's moving, any external force would cause it to accelerate. So the force needed to stop it would be the force exerted by the water, which is about 0.77 N. So the answer is H.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 0.78 N, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer is H.

To determine the force the attendant must apply to stop the tank from moving after the seal overflows, we analyze the situation using principles of fluid dynamics and Newton's laws. The tank is on a smooth plastic surface, so friction is negligible. The water flows out of a circular hole with diameter 1 cm (radius 0.5 cm) and is 1 m above the hole. The tank's mass and smooth surface imply that the force required to stop it is due to the pressure exerted by the water on the hole.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Pressure at the Hole**:  
   The pressure \( P \) at the hole is given by \( P = \rho g h \), where \( \rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) (density of water), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( h = 1 \, \text{m} \).  
   \[
   P = 1000 \times 9.8 \times 1 = 9800 \, \text{Pa}.
   \]

2. **Area of the Hole**:  
   The hole is circular with diameter 1 cm (radius \( r = 0.5 \, \text{cm} = 0.005 \, \text{m} \)).  
   \[
   A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.005)^2 = 0.00007854 \, \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Force Exerted by Water on the Hole**:  
   The force \( F \) exerted by the water on the hole is \( F = P \times A \).  
   \[
   F = 9800 \times 0.00007854 \approx 0.77 \, \text{N}.
   \]

4. **Force to Stop the Tank**:  
   The force exerted by the water on the tank is equal to the force it exerts on the tank due to Newton's third law. Since the tank is on a smooth surface, the attendant must apply a force of approximately \( 0.77 \, \text{N} \) to stop it from moving.

### Conclusion:
The force required to stop the tank is approximately \( 0.78 \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
