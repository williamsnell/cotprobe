Okay, I'm looking at this question about a passage from a French newspaper. The passage mentions the mobilization for war in 1914, specifically mentioning it was called "The First Day of Mobilization." The person in the passage is Roland Doregelès, and he talks about the reaction in Paris and the impact on Georges Clemenceau.

The question asks what Doregelès inferred about the reaction in Paris. The options are about the emotions felt in Paris towards the mobilization. 

So, the passage says that the First Day of Mobilization will be on Sunday, August 2, 1914. It's an announcement to a million Frenchmen, so it's a significant event. The person in the passage mentions that Paris was "singing," which I think refers to the mobilization's impact or the mood of the people there. 

Looking at the options, I need to see which option aligns with this. The options are about the emotions in Paris. The first part of the passage says, "It was an announcement to a million and a half Frenchmen." So, that's a large group, which is a classic mobilization, often called a "day of resistance."

Roland Doregelès, the person recalling this, talks about the reaction in Georges Clemenceau's office. He says the reaction was great enthusiasm. Wait, no, looking again: the passage says, "I burst into the office of Georges Clemenceau, our chief. "What is Paris saying?" he asked me. "It's singing, sir!" "It will be all right then[," Clemenceau replied." Oh, so Clemenceau says it's singing, which might indicate a positive reaction. 

But wait, the passage also says, "What is Paris saying?" It's singing, sir. So, maybe the reaction was positive, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the person who's recalling the event, Roland Doregelès, says that the mobilization was greeted with great enthusiasm, but I'm a bit confused because the passage also mentions "great sorrow all across Europe" in option E. 

Wait, the passage says it was greeted with great enthusiasm. Alternatively, the person in the passage is saying the reaction was great enthusiasm. But the question is about what Doregelès recalled, so I think the correct inference is that the reaction was great enthusiasm. Looking at the options, option J says "gained with great enthusiasm in Paris," which matches. Alternatively, option I says fear and apprehension, which doesn't fit.

Wait, wait. Let me go through the options again. The passage says, "It was an announcement to a million and a half Frenchmen. … War! … Dead tired but exhilarated, I got back to [my newspaper's office] and burst into the office of Georges Clemenceau, our chief. "What is Paris saying?" he asked me. "It's singing, sir!" "It will be all right then[," Clemenceau replied."

So, Clemenceau says it's singing, which might imply a positive reaction. So, the reaction in Paris was positive. 

Looking at the options:

A: great sorrow — no, the passage says it's singing.
B: fear and apprehension — no.
C: great skepticism — no.
D: indifference — no.
E: great sorrow all across Europe — the passage says it's greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris, not sadness.
F: indifference — no.
G: great skepticism — no.
H: great enthusiasm — yes, this seems correct.
I: fear and apprehension — no.
J: great enthusiasm in Paris — yes, this matches.

So, the options are E and J. Wait, the passage says the reaction was great enthusiasm. So, the answer is J because it's in Paris. Alternatively, option E is about Europe, but the question is about Paris. 

Wait, the question is about what Doregelès inferred, which is about the reaction in Paris. So, the options are:

E: great sadness all across Europe — no, because the passage says it's singing.
J: great enthusiasm in Paris — yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be J.
