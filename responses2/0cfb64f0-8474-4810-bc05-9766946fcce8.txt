Okay, so I have this question about the wavelength of a tuning fork. Let me think about how to approach it. The question says the tuning fork has 440 cycles per second, which I remember is the frequency. So frequency (f) is 440 Hz maybe.

Wait, the question is about the wavelength. I remember the formula c = fλ, where c is the speed of sound, f is frequency, and λ is wavelength. Oh, but wait, I think the speed of sound varies depending on the medium. Since this is a tuning fork, it's probably in air, so the speed of sound in air is approximately 343 meters per second. Or wait, sometimes people use 340 m/s for easier calculations. I'm not sure, but I'll go with 340 m/s for now.

So the formula rearranged to solve for wavelength is λ = c/f. Let's plug in the numbers. The frequency is 440 Hz, so f=440. So λ = 340 m / 440 Hz. Let me calculate that. 340 divided by 440 is... let me see, 340/440 simplifies to 34/44, which is 17/22. 17 divided by 22 is approximately 0.7727 meters. Hmm, that's about 0.77 meters. Wait, but the options are all in feet. Oh, right, I need to convert meters to feet. I remember that 1 meter is approximately 3.28084 feet. So 0.7727 meters times 3.28084 feet/meter. Let me calculate that.

0.7727 * 3.28084 ≈ Let me do it step by step. 0.7 * 3.28 is about 2.296. 0.07 *3.28 is about 0.2296. And 0.0027 *3.28 is about 0.008856. Adding those together: 2.296 + 0.2296 = 2.5256, plus 0.008856 is about 2.5344 feet. So approximately 2.53 feet.

Looking at the options, choice G is approximately 2.5 ft. So the answer should be G.

To determine the wavelength of a standard 440 Hz tuning fork, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of sound in air (approximately \( 340 \, \text{m/s} \)) and \( f \) is the frequency. Plugging in the values:

\[
\lambda = \frac{340}{440} \approx 0.7727 \, \text{meters}
\]

Converting meters to feet (1 meter ≈ 3.28084 feet):

\[
0.7727 \times 3.28084 \approx 2.53 \, \text{feet}
\]

The closest option to this value is **2.5 ft**.
