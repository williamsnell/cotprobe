Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: e^x + x - 2 = 0. I need to find the number of real solutions in the interval [0,1], which is k, and the number of solutions that aren't in [0,1], which is n. Then I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that e^x is an increasing function. So, let's consider the function f(x) = e^x + x - 2. I'm looking for where f(x) equals zero. 

First, I'll plug in the endpoints to see the behavior.

At x=0: f(0) = e^0 + 0 - 2 = 1 + 0 -2 = -1. So f(0) is negative.

At x=1: f(1) = e^1 + 1 - 2 ≈ 2.718 + 1 - 2 ≈ 1.718. So f(1) is positive.

Since f is continuous (as it's composed of continuous functions), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one solution between 0 and 1. But wait, is that the only solution?

I should check if the function is monotonic. The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = e^x + 1. Since e^x is always positive, f'(x) is always greater than 1. So f is strictly increasing everywhere. That means it can cross zero only once. So k=1.

Now, what about the solutions outside [0,1]? Let's see. For x < 0, let's pick x=-1. f(-1) = e^(-1) + (-1) - 2 ≈ 0.368 - 3 ≈ -2.632. That's negative. So at x=-1, f is negative.

What about x very large? As x approaches infinity, e^x dominates, so f(x) goes to infinity. So f(x) is increasing, starts negative at x=0, becomes positive at x=1, and then keeps increasing. So for x < 0, f(x) is negative, and for x >1, it's positive. So, the only solution is between 0 and 1. So n, the number of solutions not in [0,1], is zero.

Wait but wait, let me think again. Because for x <0, f is negative, and for x >1, it's positive. So no solution elsewhere. So n=0.

So k=1, n=0. Looking at the options, option A is k=1 and n=0. That's correct.

The function \( f(x) = e^x + x - 2 \) is monotonically increasing since its derivative \( f'(x) = e^x + 1 \) is always positive. Evaluating \( f(x) \) at the endpoints of the interval [0,1]:
- \( f(0) = -1 \) (negative)
- \( f(1) = e - 1 \) (positive)

By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is exactly one solution in [0,1], so \( k = 1 \). For \( x < 0 \) and \( x > 1 \), \( f(x) \) remains negative and positive, respectively, with no additional solutions. Thus, \( n = 0 \).

The correct option is **A: k = 1 and n = 0**.
