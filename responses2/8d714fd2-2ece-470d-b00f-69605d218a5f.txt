Okay, so I've got this question about neurotransmitters. Hmm, I remember learning a bit about them in my biology class. Let me think. The question is asking what happens to neurotransmitters once they've done their job. The options are A to J, each describing a different process.

First, what do neurotransmitters do? I recall that they're chemicals that help transmit signals between neurons. So when a neuron fires, it sends a signal through a neurotransmitter. These neurotransmitters then signal to the next neuron. So I think they're acting as messengers.

The options: Let's go through each one.

Option A: Diffuse away and are exhaled. Wait, neurotransmitters are usually secreted by neurons. But once they're secreted, do they stay in the blood? Or do they get eliminated? I'm not sure. Some neurotransmitters can't be broken down by the body, so they might accumulate in the blood. But I think they're excreted through the kidneys or something. So maybe A is not correct because they don't diffuse away and are not excreted, but perhaps they don't do all that. Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Option B: Converted into cellular energy. No, neurotransmitters are stored in the cell membrane, not broken down into energy. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Replicate to enhance the initial signal. Hmm, neurotransmitters are made in the brain and diffused to the rest of the body. They don't replicate, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Destroyed. I don't think neurotransmitters are broken down. They're stored in the neurons and the blood, so they stay active. So D is probably not correct.

Option E: Released into the bloodstream. Yes, neurotransmitters are secreted into the blood, which makes sense because they need to get to the next neuron. So E sounds correct.

Option F: Used to build new synapses. I'm not sure. When neurons connect, they form synapses. Do neurotransmitters help in this process? I think neurotransmitters are involved in strengthening connections, but the actual building of synapses might involve other factors. So F might not be the main function of neurotransmitters once they've done their job.

Option G: Remain active indefinitely. I don't think so. They do degrade over time, especially if they're not used. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Stored in the nucleus. No, neurotransmitters are in the neurons' nuclei, not the nucleus as a whole. So H is wrong.

Option I: Deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action. Yes, because neurotransmitters are constantly being broken down. For example, the enzyme NMDH breaks them down. So I is correct.

Option J: Bond permanently. That's more like synapses, which are connections between neurons. neurotransmitters don't stick bonds permanently; they can be broken down. So J is incorrect.

So looking back, E and I are possibilities. The question is about what happens after they've done their job. Do they get eliminated or destroyed?

Wait, the process of neurotransmitter release is part of their function. They're secreted, but do they ever get broken down? I think they are broken down by enzymes, which is I. Or maybe they're excreted, which is E. But which one is correct.

In the context of neurotransmitters, once released into the blood, they are not broken down. So E is correct. But wait, some neurotransmitters are stored in the blood, and others are excreted. So maybe E is about being released, not necessarily their breakdown.

Wait, the question is about what happens once they've done their job. Do they get excreted or are they broken down? I think that once they're released into the blood, they're not broken down, so E is correct.

But wait, some neurotransmitters might be stored elsewhere. So the final step after their job is done might involve them being broken down. So I is correct.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. neurotransmitters are secreted into the blood, so they are released. But they are also broken down by enzymes. So both E and I are parts of the process.

Wait, the question is about what happens once they've done their job. Do they get eliminated or are they broken down? So if their job is to signal, perhaps they get excreted. But the body has mechanisms to break them down, like reuptake enzymes.

So the correct answer should be E, because neurotransmitters are released into the bloodstream, and I is about deactivation. But the question is about what happens after they've done their job. So when they 'do their job', are they released, and possibly broken down.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The term 'done their job' implies that once the signal is sent, the neurotransmitter is released. So option E says they're released into the bloodstream, which is correct.

Alternatively, option I says they're deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action. That's also correct because they're constantly being broken down.

So the question is, do neurotransmitters get eliminated or are they just released?

In the context of the question, the correct answer is E because once they've done their job, they're released. Or maybe I is correct because they're broken down.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the functions. Once a signal is sent, the neurotransmitter is released into the blood. But the body also breaks it down, so it's excreted. So the correct answer would be E because they are released into the bloodstream, and I because they are deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action. But the question asks what happens 'once they have done their job', which might mean that they're released.

Wait, another approach: what's the last step in neurotransmitter release. They are released into the blood, so E is correct. But at the same time, they are broken down by enzymes, which is I.

So which option is the correct answer?

The options are E and I.

Looking at the options, the question is about what happens once they have done their job. So do they get released, or are they broken down?

In the context of the question, the correct answer is E. Or I, because the question is about their 'job' done, which is their release, but maybe the question is more about their function and what's left.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct answer is E because they are released into the bloodstream, which is their final step in signaling.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I because they are broken down.

Wait, let me think about how neurotransmitters work. Once a signal is sent, the neurotransmitter is released into the blood. But the body has enzymes that break them down, so they are excreted. So the correct answer is E because they are released into the bloodstream. But the question is about what happens 'once they have done their job', which might mean that they're released.

Wait, another angle: the function of neurotransmitters. Once they've sent a signal, the neurotransmitter is released into the blood. But at the same time, they are broken down. So the 'job' done is their release, but their mechanism of breaking down is another process.

So the answer would be both E and I, but the options don't have both. So perhaps the correct answer is E, since the question is about what happens once they've done their job. Or maybe I is correct because they're deactivated.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. But looking at the options:

E: Neurotransmitters are released into the bloodstream.

I: Deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action.

The question is about what happens once they have done their job. So their job is to be released. So E is correct.

Wait, but I think that the body depletes them, so they are broken down. So I is correct as well.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because once the neurotransmitter has done its job (released into the blood), it is excreted there. But the body also breaks them down. So perhaps both E and I are correct, but the options don't allow multiple correct answers. So perhaps the correct answer is E, as the question is about what happens once they've done their job, implying that they're released.

The question asks what happens to neurotransmitters once they have "done their job." Transmitters are chemical signals that help neurons communicate. Upon activation, neurotransmitters are secreted into the blood and released into the bloodstream. However, the body continuously breaks them down, primarily through enzymes like NMDH, which are part of option I. This process ensures that neurotransmitters are not permanent. 

Option E suggests that neurotransmitters are released into the bloodstream, which aligns with the release mechanism but does not account for their eventual breakdown. Therefore, the correct answer is that neurotransmitters are released into the bloodstream (E), as this is their final step in signaling.

Answer: E
