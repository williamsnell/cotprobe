Okay, so I've got this gas problem to solve. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. The question gives me a sample of neon gas, and I need to find its pressure using the ideal gas law. Right, the formula is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but wait. Neon is a noble gas, right? So it's a monatomic gas, but maybe that doesn't matter here. Let's see, the given data is: mass is 255 mg, volume is 3.00 dm³, temperature is 122 K. Oh, and I need to calculate the pressure in atm.

First, I need to find the number of moles (n) of neon. Since the mass is given, I can use the molar mass of neon. Neon's atomic weight is about 20.18 g/mol. So, n = mass / molar mass. The mass is 255 mg, which is 0.255 grams. So n = 0.255 g / 20.18 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.255 divided by 20.18. Hmm, 20.18 is roughly 20, so 0.255/20 is about 0.01275. But more precisely, let me do it accurately. 0.255 / 20.18 = approximately 0.012636 mol.

So n ≈ 0.012636 mol.

Next, the volume V is given as 3.00 dm³. Wait, I remember that 1 dm³ is 1 liter, so that's 1 L. But wait, the units for R should be in terms of L·atm/(mol·K), right? Because the ideal gas constant R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using atm and liters.

Wait, but wait, the value of R can vary based on the units. Oh, wait, in the problem, I should use R in L·atm/(mol·K). So R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). 

Temperature T is 122 K. So plugging into PV = nRT, I can solve for P. So P = (nRT)/V.

Let me plug in the numbers:

n = 0.012636 mol,
R = 0.0821,
T = 122 K,
V = 3.00 L.

Calculating nRT first: 0.012636 * 0.0821 * 122.

Let me compute that step by step.

0.012636 * 0.0821 = 0.001038. 

Then multiply that by 122: 0.001038 * 122 ≈ 0.1267 mol·K·L? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think again. No, wait, nRT is (0.012636 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (122 K). The K cancels out, correct.

So 0.012636 * 0.0821 = let me calculate that. 0.012636 * 0.08 = 0.00101088, 0.012636 * 0.0021 = 0.0000265356. Add them up: 0.00101088 + 0.0000265356 ≈ 0.001037416.

Then multiply by 122: 0.001037416 * 122 ≈ 0.1267 atm·L.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.001037416 * 122 = let's compute that. 0.001 *122 = 0.122; 0.000037416 *122≈0.00456. So total approx 0.12656 atm·L. So that's nRT.

Now, P = (nRT)/V = 0.12656 / 3.00 = 0.042186 atm. Hmm, that's about 0.0422 atm. But wait, looking at the options, A is 4.20e-2 atm, which is 0.042 atm. So that's close to what I got.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

n = 255 mg / 20.18 g/mol = 0.255 g / 20.18 g/mol = 0.012636 mol.

nRT = 0.012636 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 122 K.

0.012636 * 0.0821 = let me compute that more accurately.

0.012636 * 0.08 = 0.00101088.

0.012636 * 0.0021 = 0.0000265356.

Adding those gives 0.001037416.

Multiply by 122: 0.001037416 * 122. Let's compute 0.001037416 * 120 = 0.12449, and 0.001037416 *2=0.002074832. Sum is 0.12449 + 0.002074832 = 0.1265648 atm·L.

Then P = 0.1265648 / 3.00 = 0.042188 atm. Which is approximately 0.0422 atm. Looking at the options, option A is 4.20e-2 atm, which is 0.0420 atm. Close enough, considering possible rounding.

Wait, but the options are all starting with 5e-2 or similar, except option A is 4.20e-2, so 0.042 atm. So the correct answer should be A: 4.20e-2 atm.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I made a mistake in the units. Because 1 mole of neon would occupy a certain volume. Let me think again. No, wait, the volume is 3.00 dm³, which is 3 liters, so that's correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when using the gas law, you have to be careful about pressure units and such. But in this case, we're using the perfect gas law, so R is correct in terms of units.

Wait, another way to compute nRT: let's see. n=0.012636 mol. R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). T=122 K.

nRT = 0.012636 * 0.0821 * 122.

Let me compute each step again.

0.012636 * 0.0821 = 0.001037416.

0.001037416 * 122 = let's compute 122 * 0.001037416 = 0.126565472.

So that's correct.

Then P = 0.126565 / 3.00 = 0.042188 atm. So about 0.0422 atm. So the closest option is A: 4.20e-2 atm, which is 0.0420 atm. So that's our answer.

Wait, but let me check if I used the correct R value. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), yes. And all other values are correct. So yes, the answer should be A.

To calculate the pressure of the neon gas using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), the following steps were taken:

1. **Determine the number of moles (\(n\)) of neon**:  
   The mass of neon is given as \( 255 \, \text{mg} = 0.255 \, \text{g} \). The molar mass of neon is \( 20.18 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   \[
   n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{0.255}{20.18} \approx 0.012636 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Convert the volume (\(V\)) to liters**:  
   The volume is given as \( 3.00 \, \text{dm}^3 \), which is equivalent to \( 3.00 \, \text{L} \).

3. **Use the ideal gas law**:  
   The temperature (\(T\)) is \( 122 \, \text{K} \), and the gas constant (\(R\)) is \( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \). Substituting into the equation \( P = \frac{nRT}{V} \):  
   \[
   P = \frac{(0.012636)(0.0821)(122)}{3.00}.
   \]

4. **Calculate \( nRT \)**:  
   First, calculate \( nR \):  
   \[
   nR = (0.012636)(0.0821) \approx 0.001037416 \, \text{L·atm/K}.
   \]  
   Then multiply by \( T \):  
   \[
   nRT = (0.001037416)(122) \approx 0.126565 \, \text{L·atm}.
   \]

5. **Solve for pressure (\(P\))**:  
   \[
   P = \frac{nRT}{V} = \frac{0.126565}{3.00} \approx 0.042188 \, \text{atm}.
   \]

6. **Round to the nearest option**:  
   The calculated pressure, \( 0.0422 \, \text{atm} \), matches closely with option \( A: 4.20 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{atm} \) (which is \( 0.0420 \, \text{atm} \)).
