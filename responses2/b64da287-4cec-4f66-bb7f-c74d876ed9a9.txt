Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about neutralizing a calcium hydroxide solution with hydrochloric acid. I need to find out how many milliliters of a 0.125 normal (N) HCl solution are required. Oh wait, normality... Right, normality (N) is a measure of concentration used in acid-base reactions. I remember that normality is equivalent to molarity multiplied by the number of equivalents per mole.

So, the equation given is Ca(OH)₂ reacting with HCl. I think the reaction is between a metal hydroxide and a strong acid. I remember that the general reaction for such a neutralization is:

Ca(OH)₂ + 2 HCl → CaCl₂ + 2 H₂O

Wait, let me make sure. Calcium hydroxide is a strong base, so it'll react with an acid. Each molecule of Ca(OH)₂ provides two OH⁻ ions. HCl provides H⁺ ions. The reaction should produce Ca²⁺, Cl⁻, and water.

So, for each mole of Ca(OH)₂, you need two moles of HCl to neutralize it completely. Because each Ca(OH)₂ gives two OH⁻, so you need two H+ from HCl to neutralize them.

Now, I need to find the normality of the Ca(OH)₂ solution to figure out how much HCl is needed.

Wait, normality is calculated as the number of equivalents per liter of solution. For a solution of a base, the equivalents are the moles multiplied by the number of OH⁻ ions per mole. So, for Ca(OH)₂, each mole gives 2 equivalents of OH⁻. Because each Ca(OH)₂ is equivalent to 2 OH⁻.

So, first, calculate the equivalents of Ca(OH)₂ in the solution.

The mass given is 1.48 grams of Ca(OH)₂. I need to find the moles of Ca(OH)₂. The molar mass of Ca(OH)₂ is ... Let me calculate that. Calcium is about 40.08 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydroxyl is 17 (since O is 16 and H is 1). Wait, wait. No, wait, Ca(OH)₂ has formula: Ca is 40.08, each OH is 17 (16+1), so two of them. So, 40.08 + 2*17 = 40.08 +34=74.08 g/mol.

So moles = mass / molar mass = 1.48 g / 74.08 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1.48 /74.08 ≈ 0.01995 moles. Let me compute it exactly. 74.08 * 0.02 is 1.4816. Oh, that's almost exactly 1.48 grams. So 0.02 moles of Ca(OH)₂.

But wait, each mole of Ca(OH)₂ gives 2 moles of OH⁻. So the equivalents of OH⁻ is 0.02 moles * 2 = 0.04 equivalents.

Now, since the reaction is 1 mole Ca(OH)₂ → 2 moles HCl, the equivalents of HCl needed would be 0.04 equivalents * 2 = 0.08 equivalents of HCl.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so each HCl gives one H+ equivalent. So the equivalents of HCl needed is 0.08 equivalents, which is the same as 0.08 moles of HCl.

Wait no, wait. Normality is equivalent per liter. So the normality (N) is calculated as equivalents per liter.

So, for the Ca(OH)₂ solution:

Moles of Ca(OH)₂ = 1.48 g / 74.08 g/mol = 0.02 mol.

Each mole of Ca(OH)₂ gives 2 mol OH⁻, so equivalents of OH⁻ = 0.02 * 2 = 0.04 equivalents.

Each equivalent of Ca(OH)₂ reacts with 2 equivalents of HCl. So equivalents of HCl needed = 0.04 * 2 = 0.08 equivalents.

But HCl is a strong acid, so each mole provides one equivalent. Therefore, the moles of HCl needed are 0.08 moles.

Now, the normality of HCl is given as 0.125 N. Normality (N) is equivalent per liter, so N = equivalents / liters. So the volume (V) in liters is equal to equivalents / N.

So volume (liters) = 0.08 equivalents / 0.125 N.

Compute that: 0.08 / 0.125 = 0.64 liters. To convert to milliliters, multiply by 1000: 0.64 L * 1000 = 640 ml.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 640 ml. So the answer should be D.

Wait, let me go through each step again to be sure.

1. Molar mass of Ca(OH)₂: 40.08 + 2*(17) = 74.08 g/mol. Correct.

2. Moles of Ca(OH)₂: 1.48g /74.08 g/mol = approx 0.02 mol. Correct.

3. Each mole Ca(OH)₂ contributes 2 OH⁻ ions: 0.02 * 2 = 0.04 equivalents of base.

4. Reaction is 1 mole base : 2 moles HCl. So equivalents of HCl needed = 0.04 * 2 = 0.08 equivalents.

5. Since HCl is a strong acid, equivalents = moles. So 0.08 moles HCl.

6. Normality of HCl is 0.125 N, so normality is N = Eq/L.

7. So volume (L) = Eq / N = 0.08 / 0.125 = 0.64 L = 640 mL.

Yes, so the correct answer is D:640 mL.

To determine how many milliliters of a 0.125 N HCl solution are required to neutralize a 1.48 g solution of Ca(OH)₂, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the molar mass of Ca(OH)₂**:  
   The molar mass is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of Ca(OH)₂} = 40.08 \, (\text{Ca}) + 2 \times (17 \, (\text{OH})) = 74.08 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

2. **Determine the moles of Ca(OH)₂**:  
   Using the given mass of Ca(OH)₂:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ca(OH)₂} = \frac{1.48 \, \text{g}}{74.08 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.02 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the equivalents of OH⁻ ions**:  
   Each mole of Ca(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻ ions:  
   \[
   \text{Equivalents of OH⁻} = 0.02 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.04 \, \text{equivalents}.
   \]

4. **Determine the equivalents of HCl required**:  
   The reaction between Ca(OH)₂ and HCl is:  
   \[
   \text{Ca(OH)₂ + 2 HCl → CaCl₂ + 2 H₂O}.
   \]  
   From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Ca(OH)₂ reacts with 2 moles of HCl. Therefore, the equivalents of HCl required are:  
   \[
   \text{Equivalents of HCl} = 0.04 \, \text{equivalents of Ca(OH)₂} \times 2 = 0.08 \, \text{equivalents}.
   \]

5. **Convert equivalents of HCl to moles**:  
   Since HCl is a strong acid, equivalents of HCl equal moles of HCl:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.08 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

6. **Calculate the volume of 0.125 N HCl solution required**:  
   Normality (N) is defined as equivalents per liter. Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Volume (L)} = \frac{\text{Equivalents}}{\text{Normality}} = \frac{0.08 \, \text{equivalents}}{0.125 \, \text{N}} = 0.64 \, \text{L}.
   \]  
   Converting to milliliters:  
   \[
   \text{Volume (mL)} = 0.64 \, \text{L} \times 1000 = 640 \, \text{mL}.
   \]

Thus, the required volume of 0.125 N HCl solution is **640 mL**. The correct answer is **D: 640 mL**.
