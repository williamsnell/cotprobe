Question:

You are a consultant asked to design an intervention program in a recently integrated housing project where antagonism and hostility between old and new residents are extremely high. The goal is to improve relations through contact. You would be more likely to facilitate that goal if you could arrange interactions that provide opportunities

Options:

A: for each group to reinforce their own positive traits without considering the other
B: where old and new residents are separated during most interactions
C: which encourage residents to ignore each other's presence
D: which provide an open airing and all-out discussion about what each group believes to be the negative crits of the other
E: which make explicit the status hierarchy chat is implicit in the interactions between the wo groups
F: that allow residents to vent their frustrations without any moderation
G: where residents can engage in competitive activities to establish dominance
H: for each group of residents co disconfirm negative traits of the other group
I: that involve only the leaders of each resident group in discussions

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about designing an intervention program for a housing project where old and new residents have high antagonism and hostility. The goal is to improve contact between them.

Let me read the question again. The key points are: they want to foster better relations through contact. The issue is high antagonism and hostility, so the program should help reduce those tensions.

Looking at the options, each is a different approach to achieving that goal. I need to figure out which strategy would be most effective.

Option A says to have each group reinforce their positive traits without considering the other. That doesn't seem right because the problem is high hostility, so maybe they don't want to reinforce negatives. Plus, the goal is to improve relations, so focusing on positives might not address the issues.

Option B suggests separating old and new residents during interactions. That could help because if they're not interacting, the hostility might decrease. But wait, what if they're just sitting apart? It depends on how they interact when they do meet. Maybe they can be more exposed to each other's perspectives.

Option C talks about encouraging residents to ignore each other's presence. That might lead to more direct interaction, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. It could make communication easier, but I'm not certain if it's the most effective method for addressing hostility.

Option D is about providing open discussions about the negative criteria of the other group. This sounds promising. If residents can talk about the other group's negative points, it might help them see each other's perspectives, which can lower hostility. It's about dialogue and understanding.

Option E says to make the status hierarchy implicit. Like, everyone knows who is who without talking about it. This could reduce tension because it might make it harder to hide negative traits. But does it directly address hostility or just make interactions more neutral?

Option F is about allowing residents to vent frustrations without moderation. This could help by giving them space to express their issues. But does it address the underlying problem of hostility or just the surface level frustration?

Option G suggests they engage in competitive activities to establish dominance. That might foster competition, which could escalate tensions rather than reduce them.

Option H is about co-disconfirming negative traits. So, if the other group's negative points are revealed, it could deepen the negativity. Not sure about that.

Option I involves only leaders in discussions. That might not be effective because the leaders might not address the issue of differing groups.

So, the question is about improving relations through contact. If I think about strategies that encourage interaction and dialogue, option D seems the best. Open discussions allow residents to express their concerns and hear others' points, which can help bridge the gap in hostility. It's about fostering understanding and empathy, which is crucial for reducing antagonism.

Comparing to other options, option B might lead to more exposure if they do separate interactions, but that's not suggested by the question. Option E is about making interactions more neutral, which might prevent hostility, but it's not about facilitating open dialogue.

Option D's approach is more about the participants creating the environment where their perspectives are heard and considered, which directly addresses the hostility.

The correct answer is D. This option emphasizes open dialogue, allowing residents to express their concerns and hear others' perspectives, which directly addresses the hostility and fosters better relations through contact.

**Answer: D**
