Question:

A college admissions officer is interested in comparing the SAT math scores of high school applicants who have and have not taken AP Statistics. She randomly pulls the files of five applicants who took AP Statistics and five applicants who did not, and proceeds to run a t-test to compare the mean SAT math scores of the two groups. Which of the following is a necessary assumption?

Options:

A: The population of SAT scores from each group is not normally distributed.
B: The SAT scores from each group are unrelated.
C: The mean SAT scores from each group are similar.
D: The SAT scores from each group are skewed.
E: The population variances from each group are known.
F: The population of SAT scores from each group is normally distributed.
G: The population variances from the two groups are unequal.
H: The population variances from each group are unknown.
I: The population variances from the two groups are equal.
J: The population variances from each group are estimated.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about statistics, specifically about the SAT math scores and a t-test. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a college admissions officer wants to compare SAT math scores between two groups: those who took AP Statistics and those who didn't. She randomly selected five applicants from each group and ran a t-test. The question is asking which of the options is a necessary assumption for this t-test.

Let me think about what a t-test requires. I remember that the t-test is used to determine if there's a significant difference between the means of two groups. Now, the main assumptions for a t-test are usually that the data is approximately normally distributed, especially when the sample sizes are small. Oh wait, but wait—another thing I recall is that the variances of the two groups should be equal, especially for the independent samples t-test. Oh wait, is that right? Or maybe not—depends on the specific version of the t-test. There's the independent samples t-test with equal variances and unequal variances (pooled vs. separate variances), and each has its own assumptions.

So, the question is about which assumption is necessary here. Let's look at the options.

Option A: The population of SAT scores from each group is not normally distributed. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. The t-test assumes normality, especially with small sample sizes. But since in this case, the sample size is 5 in each group (so n=5 for each), which is small, the assumption of normality might be violated. However, I'm not sure if that's a necessary assumption or just a possible issue. I think the main assumption is about the normality of the data, but I'm not certain.

Option B: The SAT scores from each group are unrelated. That doesn't make sense. I think that's not a statistical assumption. The t-test is about means, not about independence between variables. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The mean SAT scores from each group are similar. Again, that's not a necessary assumption. The t-test doesn't assume the means are similar; it's about whether the differences are statistically significant. So C is not a correct assumption.

Option D: The SAT scores from each group are skewed. Skewness refers to the distribution being asymmetrical. If the data is skewed, it can affect the normality assumption. But the main assumption is about normality, not specifically the skew. So D is not a necessary assumption unless the data is definitely skewed, which we don't know.

Option E: The population variances from each group are known. Well, the t-test usually uses the sample variances, not the population. So E is incorrect. We don't know the population variances, it's more about the sample variances.

Option F: The population of SAT scores from each group is normally distributed. Oh yes, that's a key point. The t-test assumes that each group's population is normally distributed, especially when the sample size is small (like 5 here). If the populations are not normal, the t-test might not be valid. So F is a necessary assumption.

Option G: The population variances from the two groups are unequal. Well, that's a different assumption, usually checked with Levene's test or the F-test. This isn't a necessary assumption of the standard independent samples t-test, which assumes equal variances. So G is incorrect.

Option H: The population variances from each group are unknown. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If the population variances are unknown, that's the usual case. So H is incorrect because the t-test uses sample variances, not population ones.

Option I: The population variances from the two groups are equal. Again, this is the assumption of equal variances in the t-test. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The population variances from each group are estimated. That makes sense because the t-test uses the sample variances as estimates of the population variances. So J is correct because this is how the test is conducted, but it's not a necessary assumption. The equal variances are an additional assumption.

So, putting it all together, the necessary assumption is that the populations are normally distributed. So the correct answer should be F.

The necessary assumption for the t-test in this scenario is that the populations of SAT scores from each group are normally distributed. This is because the t-test relies on the normality of the data, especially when sample sizes are small. 

Answer: F
