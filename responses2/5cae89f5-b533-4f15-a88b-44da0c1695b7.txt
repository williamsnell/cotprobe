Question:

In multiprogrammed systems it is advantageous if some programs such as editors and compilers can be shared by several users. Which of the following must be true of multiprogrammed systems in order that a single copy of a program can be shared by several users?
I. The program is a macro.
II. The program is recursive.
III. The program is reentrant.

Options:

A: I and III only
B: II and III are true but not necessary for sharing a program
C: None of the statements must be true
D: II and III only
E: I only
F: I, II, and III all must be true
G: I and II only
H: II only
I: The program is non-recursive and reentrant
J: III only

Okay, so I have this question about multiprogrammed systems and whether a program can be shared among users. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given statements must be true for a multiprogrammed system to allow a program to be shared by several users. The options are I, II, III, etc. The statements are about the program being a macro, recursive, or reentrant.

Wait, multiprogrammed systems mean that more than one program can run simultaneously, right? And in such systems, they use a shared memory model, allowing programs to share files or code. But for that to work, the program must be able to be paused and resumed normally. Oh right, that's called being reentrant. So a reentrant OS can handle multiple execution frames in a single program.

Now, the question is about which statements must be true for a program to be shared. Let's look at each statement.

Statement I: The program is a macro. Microprocming systems, where each program runs independently, don't need a macro. They can just execute each line of the macro as needed. So a macro isn't a must for sharing in multiprogrammed systems. So I don't think I is necessary.

Statement II: The program is recursive. Recursion is when a function calls itself. In a multiprogrammed environment, recursion is a problem because it can lead to stack overflow, especially for large programs. So if a program is recursive, it might not be feasible to run it concurrently or share it. So II probably isn't necessary.

Statement III: The program is reentrant. Recempt is about a program that can resume after a break. So if a program is reentrant, it can be paused and continued after a short break, allowing it to be shared with other processes. That definitely makes sense for multiprogrammed systems because it allows sharing without blocking each other.

So the only statement that must be true is III. Looking at the options, that's option J: III only.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The question is which must be true for a single copy to be shared by several users. So if a program is reentrant, it can be paused and resumed. That makes it possible. So the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J: III only.
