Okay, so I've got this question about mercury barometers. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says there are two mercury barometers. One has a cross-sectional area of 1 cm², and the other is 2 cm². The question is about the height of the mercury in the narrower tube. The options given are A to J, with various ratios and other possibilities.

Hmm, I remember that barometers measure atmospheric pressure by the height of the mercury column. The height depends on the pressure. The formula I recall is something like P = ρgh, where P is pressure, ρ is density, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height.

Wait, but in the case of a mercury barometer, the cross-sectional area of the tube doesn't directly affect the height of the mercury column, right? Because the pressure is the same in both tubes. Oh wait, no, the cross-sectional area might relate to the volume of mercury, but the height itself is determined by pressure. Because pressure is force per unit area, so if the area changes, the height would change inversely. 

Let me think again. Since pressure is the same, P = ρgh. Suppose the area is A. The volume of mercury is A * h. If the area changes, the volume changes, but the height depends on pressure and density. So if the area in the narrower tube is smaller, what happens to the height? 

Wait, the cross-sectional area of the tube doesn't change the pressure. The pressure is determined by the atmospheric pressure. So the height should remain the same, regardless of the cross-sectional area. Because pressure depends on the height (and the column's area) but if the area changes, the same pressure would result in the same height. 

Wait, let me get this straight. The pressure in the tube is equal to the atmospheric pressure. The pressure is given by P = (ρ g) h, where h depends on the height. So if the area of the tube changes, the volume (A * h) would change, but the pressure remains the same because pressure is the same in both tubes. So h would stay the same. 

So the height of mercury in the narrower tube would be the same as the taller tube. So the answer should be option C: the same.

Wait, but what about if the cross-sectional area of the tube changes but the pressure is the same? Using P = ρgh, since P is same as the atmospheric pressure, h must be same regardless of cross-sectional area. So the height is same. So the correct answer is C.
</think>

The height of the mercury column in a mercury barometer is determined by the atmospheric pressure and the density of mercury, according to the formula \( P = \rho g h \), where \( P \) is pressure, \( \rho \) is density, \( g \) is acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is height. The cross-sectional area of the tube does not directly affect the height of the mercury column because the pressure remains the same in both tubes. Therefore, the height of the mercury in the narrower tube would be the same as in the wider tube.

Answer: C
