Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the domestication of cattle. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question asks where and how long ago cattle were domesticated. The options are A to J, each giving a location and a time period. I remember that domestication of animals is a big topic in history. Cows were domesticated in the past, but where exactly?

I think the first domesticated animals were herbivores. Maybe something like sheep or chickens. They were domesticated in ancient Mesopotamia, which is modern-day parts of today's Near East. But when did that happen? I recall that the earliest domesticated animals were around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. So like, maybe around 6,000 years ago, not 10,500. Wait, I'm a bit confused between 5,000 and 10,000.

Wait, the options have '10,500' and '3,500' as possibilities. Another thought: the domestication of humans was around 6,000 years ago. So the earliest domesticated animals would have been around the same time because the animals were already there. So maybe the first domesticated animal was around 6,000 years ago. That would fit with options like C, G, F, or J.

Looking at the options again:

A: sub-Saharan Africa, 10,500 years ago — that's a long time ago, maybe too late.
B: Western Europe, 3,500 years ago — that's pretty early. But domesticated animals in the Paleolithic period would have been around 3-4,000 years ago, so perhaps that's too early.
C: Middle East, 10,500 years ago — wait, that's the same time as A? Or maybe not. Because the domestication of animals is a separate event from the domestication of humans. So, maybe it's not 10,500 years before the hominins. So perhaps the first domesticated animals were around 6,000 years ago.
G: Middle East, 6,500 — that's about the same ballpark as I thought.
F: South America, 6,500 — also around 6,500. But the options list each with specific numbers.

Wait, I remember that the earliest domesticated animals, like sheep, were domesticated around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago in Mesopotamia. So the correct answer would be either C, G, or F.

Looking at the options, F is South America, 6,500 years ago. G is Middle East, 6,500. C is Middle East, 10,500.

Wait, but the question is about the first time humans domesticated the animals. So that would be around 6,500 years ago in the Middle East. So the correct answer would be option G, which is "in the Middle East, about 6,500 years ago." Option C is 10,500 which seems too late, perhaps the time when the first herbivores were domesticated, not the animals.

Wait, another thought: the domestication of the first herbivore, maybe sheep, was around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago in the middle east. So about 6,500 years ago would make sense. So the options are C and F.

Between C and F, looking at the options, which one is correct. The options are:

C: Middle East, about 10,500 years ago

F: South America, about 6,500 years ago.

Wait, but I thought that the earliest domesticated animals were around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. So perhaps the correct time is about 6,500, which would make option F correct.

But I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the earliest domesticated animals were around 6,000 years ago in the Middle East. So perhaps the correct answer is option G. Wait, but I'm looking at the options again.

Wait, the question is about where and how long ago. So it's about the time when the first domesticated animals were domesticated, not when humans became domesticated. So the correct time would be around 6,500 years ago.

So looking at the options, F is South America, 6,500. C is the Middle East, 10,500. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think the correct answer is that the first domesticated animals were in the Middle East, around 6,500 years ago. So option G is correct.

The question asks where and how long ago cattle were first domesticated. Cows were domesticated in ancient Mesopotamia, around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. This aligns with the timeframe in the Middle East, as option G (Middle East, about 6,500 years ago) matches this timeline. Other options, such as C (10,500 years ago), F (6,500 years ago), and J (7,500 years ago), either refer to incorrect time periods or locations. Therefore, the correct answer is G.

**Answer: G**
