Question:

Stress Inoculation Training involves both skills training and modification of maladaptive cognitions. Which of the following steps is incorrectly defined by a young inexperienced therapist:

Options:

A: SKILLS REHEARSAL→ practicing the newly acquired skills in real or imagined situations
B: PRACTICE→ applying learned skills in controlled, non-threatening situations
C: COGNITION PREPARATION→ education on how faulty cognitions prevent adaptive coping
D: SKILLS ACQUISITION→ learning relaxation, self-statements, escape routes not necessary with rehearsing them
E: PRACTICE→ applies learning to real or imagines situations done on a gradual basis
F: SKILLS ACQUISITION→ learning and rehearsing new skills relaxation, self-statements, escape routes
G: COGNITION PREPARATION→ learning how to identify and correct maladaptive thought patterns
H: COGNITION PREPARATION→ understanding how adaptive coping mechanisms can be hindered by correct cognitions

Okay, so I've got this question about Stress Inoculation Training. Hmm, I remember it's a method involving both skill training and modification of maladaptive cognitive functions. The question is asking which step is incorrectly defined by a young inexperienced therapist. Let me think through each option.

The options are A to H, and I need to find the incorrect step. Let me try to recall what Stress Inoculation Training entails.

Option A: SKILLS REHEARSAL. That's about practicing newly acquired skills in real or imagined situations. I think that's a part of stress prevention, so this seems correct.

Option B: PRACTICE. This is applying learned skills in controlled, non-threatening situations. Oh wait, I think I heard that practice is a step in the STI process—like perhaps it's when they actually use the skills in a controlled environment, not wild. So this seems correct.

Option C: COGNITION PREPARATION. This is about education on how faulty cognitive functions prevent adaptive responses. I remember that this step involves teaching how to recognize and correct negative thoughts. So this sounds right, so C is correct.

Option D: SKILLS ACQUISITION. This is about learning relaxation, self-statements, and escape routes not being necessary with rehearsing them. Wait, no, I think the idea is that you have to actually practice them. Because without practice, you might not learn the techniques. So if someone says that they can learn these without practice, that's incorrect. So D seems wrong.

Option E: PRACTICE. This is applying learned skills in real or imagined situations done gradually. Wait, isn't practice done in controlled situations? Or is it done on gradual basis? Or maybe E is correct because it's the gradual application. So I'm not sure about E yet.

Option F: SKILLS ACQUISITION. This is learning and rehearsing new skills with relaxation, self-statements, escape routes. Wait, I think I've heard that during skill acquisition, you have to practice them in controlled settings, not just rehearsing. So F might be incorrect if it says you can learn without practice, which contradicts what I know. So F could be the wrong step.

Option G: COGNITION PREPARATION. This is about learning how to identify and correct maladaptive thought patterns. That sounds correct because once they know how to identify these thoughts, they can modify them.

Option H: COGNITION PREPARATION. This is about understanding how adaptive coping mechanisms can be hindered by correct cognitions. That also sounds correct because if you know that your thoughts are causing a problem, you can adjust strategies.

So putting it all together:

D says that skills acquisition doesn't require practice. That's incorrect because you have to practice them, especially in controlled situations. So D is the incorrect step.

E: Practice is applying learned skills on a gradual basis. I think that's correct. They do practice them slowly to avoid overloading the brain. So E is correct.

So the incorrect step is D.

The incorrect step is D. Skills acquisition does not require practice. Instead, practice is essential, especially in controlled settings, to ensure effective learning. 

Answer: D
