Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the worldwide prevalence of obesity. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'm a bit rusty on my public health stats, but I remember that obesity is a major health issue. I think it's associated with several conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and higher mortality rates. But how common is it globally?

I remember hearing that the World Health Organization (WHO) reports some stats. I think around 25% of the global population is considered overweight or obese. Wait, but wait—could that be the percentage of people, or maybe the percentage of adults? Because I'm not sure if it's including children. Let me think: the WHO says that about 27% of the global population is considered overweight or obese. But 27% is a bit high. I remember hearing that in some contexts, it's broken down into adults and children. Maybe it's higher for children, like around 15-16% or so.

Looking at the options, option E is 40%, which seems high. Maybe that's the global prevalence including everyone, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, the WHO estimates that around 25-30% of the global population is overweight. Let me check this again. Oh, I think I might have confused it with another metric. Another thought: some sources say that the prevalence of obesity in the world is around 25-30%. So, looking at the options, E is 40%, which is higher than that. Hmm.

Alternatively, I think the World Health Organization's global prevalence of obesity is about 25%–27%. So looking at the options, E is 40% which is higher than that. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the percentages. Let me think again. Oh, wait, I think the correct answer is around 25-30%, so the closest option would be B:20% or D:15% or others. Wait, none of the options are 25-30%. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options:
A: 30%
B:20%
C:13%
D:15%
E:40%
F:35%
G:10%
H:11%
I:25%
J:39%

Wait, E is 40%, which is higher than the 25-30% range. Maybe the question is referring to adults only? Or perhaps it's a different definition. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbers.

Another angle: perhaps the global prevalence is about 25-30%, so the closest option would be E is 40%, which is too high. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the prevelance among adults, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the percentage with another metric like the prevalence of obesity in specific regions.

Wait, maybe I should think about the numbers more precisely. I think the World Health Organization reports that the global prevalence of obesity is around 25-30%, meaning that 25-30% of the global population is considered overweight or obese. So looking at the options, E is 40% which is higher than that. That's conflicting. So perhaps the correct answer isn't E.

Wait, let me check another source. Another source I recall says that the global prevalence of obesity is about 25-30%, so the options don't have that. The options given are A:30% (which is the upper end of the range), then others lower. So if the correct answer is 25-30%, which is 30% being the upper bound, then option A is 30%, which would be the correct choice. But wait, I thought the upper end is 30%, so the choice would be A:30%.

Wait no, perhaps it's lower. Another source says the prevalence is about 25%, so perhaps the correct answer is E:40% is too high, but if the correct is around 25-30%, then among the options, the closest is E at 40%, which is higher, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 25%, which is option I.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The WHO says that around 27% of the global population is considered overweight or obese. So 27% is the figure. But the options don't have 27%. The closest is A:30%, but that's a bit higher than the actual 27%. So perhaps the correct answer is A:30% as it's the closest option to the actual 27% figure.

Wait, but another source I recall says the global prevalence is about 25-30%. So perhaps the correct answer is 25, which is option I:25%. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different definition or region. But in the absence of more specific data, I think the answer is around 25-30%, so the closest option would be E:40%—wait no, 40% is higher than 30%.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E:40%, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the percentage with the fraction of people with high blood pressure or other complications. But no, the question is about obesity prevalence.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual figure is around 25%, making option I:25% correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because the options don't include 25%. Let me look again. The options are:

A:30%
B:20%
C:13%
D:15%
E:40%
F:35%
G:10%
H:11%
I:25%
J:39%

So the options are 30, 20, 13, 15, 40, 35, 10, 11, 25, 39%. So the closest to the 25-30% range would be 25% itself, which is option I. So if the actual figure is around 25%, then option I is correct.

But wait, another thought: some sources might consider the global prevalence of obesity as 25-30%, but perhaps the exact number is around 25%, which would make option I correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the WHO's estimate is 27%, but that's not an option. So the options are either 25% or 30%. So perhaps the answer is 25%, which is option I.

Wait, but wait, I might have gotten the numbers wrong. Let me try to confirm. Oh right, the WHO reports that the global prevalence of obesity is about 27.5%. So that's about 27.5%. Looking at the options, the closest is 30% (A) and 25% (I). So 27.5 is closer to 25 than 30, but that's not exactly correct. Alternatively, perhaps the options had a typo, but assuming the options are correct as given, the closest to 27.5 is 30%, so A is 30%. Wait, but that's 2.5% higher. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 25%, but if the actual figure is around 27.5%, then 25% is lower, but perhaps the question expects the higher end.

Alternatively, another source says that the prevalence is around 25%, so the correct answer could be 25%, which is option I. So I'm a bit torn.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact numbers. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that as of 2023, the prevalence of obesity globally is estimated to be approximately 27.5% of people who have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. So the global prevalence is about 27.5%. Among the options, A is 30%, which is the closest to that. So the correct answer would be A:30%.

The question asks for the worldwide prevalence of obesity, and the options provided are A to J with varying percentages. To determine the correct answer, it is important to recall that the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 27.5% of the global population has a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, indicating obesity. Among the given options, the closest value to this estimate is 30% (Option A). While 25% (Option I) is also a plausible estimate, it is slightly lower than the WHO's reported figure. Therefore, the best choice is A:30%.

Answer: A
