Okay, so I've got this problem here: (6^83 + 8^83) mod 49. Hmm, mod 49. I'm a bit rusty on modular arithmetic, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with exponents modulo a number, especially when the exponent is large, Fermat's Little Theorem might come into play. Wait, but 49 is 7 squared, not a prime. Oh right, Euler's theorem applies when the base and modulus are coprime. Let me check if 6 and 49 are coprime. 49's prime factors are 7, and 6 doesn't have 7 as a factor, so yes, they are coprime. Similarly, 8 and 49 share no common factors, so they are coprime too.

Euler's theorem says that if a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ is Euler's totient function. For 49, φ(49) is 49 * (1 - 1/7) = 42. So, φ(49) is 42. That means 6^42 ≡ 1 mod 49 and 8^42 ≡ 1 mod 49.

So, 6^83 can be written as 6^(42*1 + 41) = (6^42)^1 * 6^41. Since 6^42 ≡1 mod 49, this becomes 1 * 6^41 mod 49. Similarly, 8^83 = 8^(42*1 + 41) = (8^42)^1 * 8^41 ≡ 1 * 8^41 mod 49.

So now I need to compute 6^41 mod 49 and 8^41 mod 49.

Wait, but 41 is still a big exponent. Maybe I can find a pattern or a smaller exponent. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute these exponents modulo 49 using repeated squaring or some other method.

Let me try computing 6^k mod 49 for some k and see if there's a pattern.

Alternatively, maybe I can find 6^41 mod 49 by breaking it down into smaller exponents.

Wait, another approach: using the fact that 6 and 8 are both congruent to -1 mod 7. Let me think about that. Hmm, 6 mod 7 is -1, and 8 mod 7 is 1. So, 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, and 8 ≡ 1 mod 7.

Wait, but we're dealing with mod 49, which is 7^2. Maybe I should consider using Euler's theorem more carefully.

But perhaps better to compute 6^42 mod 49 is 1, as per Euler's theorem. So 6^41 is equal to 6^(-1) mod 49. Because 6*6^41 =6^42=1 mod49, so 6^41 is the inverse of 6 mod49.

Similarly, 8^42=1 mod49, so 8^41 is the inverse of 8 mod49.

So, let's find the inverse of 6 mod49 and the inverse of 8 mod49.

Calculating inverse of 6 mod49: find x such that 6x ≡1 mod49.

Let me try 6 * x mod49 =1.

6*8=48, which is -1 mod49. So 6*(-8) ≡1 mod49. So 6*41=246. 246 divided by 49: 49*5=245, so 246=49*5 +1 → 246 ≡1 mod49. So 6*41=246 ≡1 mod49. So inverse of 6 is 41 mod49.

Similarly, for 8: find y such that 8y ≡1 mod49.

Let me try 8*31=248. 248 mod49: 49*5=245, 248-245=3 → 3. Not 1. Next, 8*25=200. 200 mod49: 49*4=196 → 200-196=4. Not 1. 8*22=176. 176-49*3=176-147=29. Not 1. 8*24=192. 192-49*3=192-147=45. Not 1. 8*26=208. 208-49*4=208-196=12. Not 1. 8*27=216. 216-49*4=216−196=20. Not 1. 8*28=224. 224-49*4=224−196=28. Not 1. 8*29=232. 232−49*4=232−196=36. Not 1. 8*30=240. 240−49*4=240−196=44. Not 1. 8*31=248 →3 as before. 8*32=256. Let's compute 256 mod49. 49*5=245, 256-245=11. Not 1. 8*33=264−49*5=264-245=19. Not 1. 8*34=272−49*5=272-245=27. Not 1. 8*35=280−49*5=280-245=35. Not 1. 8*36=288−49*5=288-245=43. Not 1. 8*37=296−49*6=296-294=2. Not 1. 8*38=304−49*6=304-294=10. Not 1. 8*39=312−49*6=312-294=18. Not 1. 8*40=320−49*6=320-294=26. Not 1. 8*41=328−49*6=328-294=34. Not 1. 8*42=336−49*6=336-294=42. Not 1. 8*43=344−49*7=344-343=1. Oh! So 8*43=344 ≡1 mod49. So inverse of 8 is 43 mod49.

So, 6^41 ≡41 mod49, and 8^41≡43 mod49.

Now, the original expression is (6^83 +8^83) mod49.

Which is equal to (6^41 *6^42 +8^41 *8^42) mod49.

But 6^42 is (6^42) ≡1 mod49, similarly 8^42≡1 mod49. So, this becomes (6^41 *1 +8^41 *1) mod49 = (41 +43) mod49.

41 +43 = 84. Now, 84 mod49: 49*1=49, 84-49=35. So 84≡35 mod49.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the computations. Because 6^83 can be written as 6^(42+41) = (6^42)(6^41) ≡1*41=41 mod49. Similarly, 8^83 = (8^42)(8^41) ≡1*43=43 mod49. So 41+43=84, mod49 is 35. So the answer is 35, which is option C.

The problem requires computing (6^83 + 8^83) mod 49. Using Euler's theorem, since φ(49) = 42, and both 6 and 8 are coprime to 49, we have 6^42 ≡ 1 mod 49 and 8^42 ≡ 1 mod 49. Thus, 6^83 ≡ 6^(42*1 +41) = (6^42)(6^41) ≡1*6^41 mod49. Similarly, 8^83 ≡8^41 mod49. 

Next, find the inverses of 6 and 8 modulo 49. The inverse of 6 is 41, and the inverse of 8 is 43. Therefore, 6^41 ≡41 and 8^41≡43 mod49. Adding them gives 41+43=84, which mod49 is 35.
