Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about strings and vibrations. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about a string, right? 

The problem says a string that's 100 centimeters long has a frequency of 200 vibrations per second. And the question is asking what the frequency would be if the string is the same tension but 50 centimeters long. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when you change the length of a string under tension, the frequency changes in a particular way. Oh right, it's because the frequency of a vibrating string is related to its length, tension, and linear mass density. But wait, the tension is the same in both cases, so that part might cancel out. 

The formula I recall is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ), where f is frequency, L is length, T is tension, and μ is linear mass density. Since the tension is the same for both strings, the frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the length. So f1/f2 = sqrt(L2/L1).

Wait, let me make sure. Let me think: if the string is shorter, it vibrates faster. So if the original is 100 cm and becomes 50 cm, which is half as long, the frequency should double, right? Because the frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the length. So if L halves, sqrt(L) halves, so 1/(sqrt(L)) doubles. So f doubles.

So in this case, the original frequency is 200 vibrations per second. So the new frequency should be 200 * 2 = 400 vibrations per second. Let me check the options. Option C is 400vps.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Oh wait, the formula is f is proportional to 1/sqrt(L), so if L is halved, f doubles. So yeah, that's correct.

The frequency of a string is inversely proportional to the square root of its length when the tension and linear mass density are constant. Since the string is halved in length, the frequency doubles. The original frequency is 200 vibrations per second, so the new frequency is 400 vibrations per second. 

Answer: C: 400vps
