Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about whether treaties should assume a particular form. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question is asking about the form that treaties should assume. The options are A to J. Let me read them again:

A: Treaties do not need to be designated as such, but must always assume a particular form.
B: Treaties should always be written in legal language, regardless of their form.
C: Treaties should always assume a particular form, no matter how they are designated.
D: Treaties should always be designated as such, but do not need to assume a particular form.
E: Treaties do not have to assume a particular form or designated as such.
F: Treaties should not be designated as such, and do not need to assume a particular form.
G: Treaties do not need to be designated or assume a particular form, but must always be ratified by the legislative body.
H: Treaties have to be designated as such, no matter what form they assume.
I: Treaties should always be designated as such and assume a particular form.
J: Treaties can assume any form, but must always be signed by the heads of states.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure about all the legal terms, but I'll try to think about it. I remember hearing about the concept of treaties needing to be signed by certain institutions, like the heads of state. Also, I think there's something about designations and forms.

Wait, the question is about whether treaties should assume a particular form. So, perhaps the answer relates to how treaties are structured. I remember that treaties are supposed to be written in legal language, so that's option B. But wait, option B says they should always be written in legal language, regardless of their form. So that's about the writing style, but not necessarily the form itself.

Looking at option A: Treaties do not need to be designated, but must assume a particular form. That suggests no designation is needed, which doesn't seem right because I think designations are important. 

Option C says treaties should assume a particular form, no matter how they're designated. So regardless of how they're written (like in international or domestic), they have to have a specific form. That could be correct, but I'm not sure if designations are part of the form.

Option I, which is exactly what I thought, says they should be designated as such and assume a particular form. That seems to fit because designations (like the form of the treaty) are necessary, and they must assume a specific form, such as the one recognized by the states.

Option E says they don't have to assume a particular form or be designated. That seems incorrect because I believe designations and forms are part of the treaty's structure.

Option J is also about designating and assuming a form, but it says they can assume any form and must be signed. Wait, does a treaty need to be signed by states? I think so. So J might be incorrect because designations and forms are important, and they must be signed.

So going back to options, I think the correct answer is I. Treaties should always be designated as such and assume a particular form. Because designations are necessary for the treaty to be effective, and they must have a specific form. Also, I think they have to be signed by the states, which is part of designating and assuming the form.

The correct answer is **I: Treaties should always be designated as such and assume a particular form**. Treaties require designations to ensure they are recognized and effective, and they must assume a specific form to be legally valid. Designations are necessary to fulfill their obligations and ensure they are signed by states, aligning with international legal standards. 

**Answer: I**
