Alright, so I've got this economics question in front of me. Let me read it again.

The question is about the drawbacks of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap. The options are A to D. I need to choose the correct answer based on what I know about fiscal policy.

First, I remember that when the economy is in a recession, it's because of a negative demand situation—so aggregate demand is low. To stimulate it, the government uses fiscal policy, which involves changing aggregate demand through spending and taxation. There are two main tools: government spending (like infrastructure or education) and tax cuts.

The main idea is that increasing government spending or cutting taxes can boost demand, making the economy more active and thus less recessionary. But the question is about the drawbacks—what happens when you try to close the gap with fiscal policy.

Looking at the options:

A: Unemployment will rise. Hmm, when the economy is struggling, it might lead to higher unemployment as more people are needed for jobs. That sounds plausible because businesses need workers. So, A could be a possible drawback.

B: Taxes have to be raised. That's one of the tools. If the government is closing the gap by increasing spending, they might raise taxes to keep the same level of spending. So, raising taxes could be a way to close the gap, not a drawback. Therefore, B isn't a drawback but a tool, so probably not the answer.

C: The equilibrium price level will rise. If aggregate demand increases, the price level tends to go up. This is a natural outcome because more demand leads to higher prices. So, C is a possible drawback in the sense that higher prices might not be desirable, but it's not a drawback per se in effecting the economy. It's a consequence.

D: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If the economy is struggling and wants to stimulate it, the government would increase spending. So if they're closing the gap, they would want to increase spending, not cut it. Cutting spending would be the opposite of the intended policy. So D seems like a wrong option.

So, the options that are drawbacks are A and C. Let's think deeper.

When the economy is struggling, the government may raise taxes to reduce the deficit. Because if you spend more, you have to cover the increased spending with lower taxes. Alternatively, they might increase spending, which could lead to higher prices.

Wait, but the question is about the drawbacks of using fiscal policy to close a recession. So the problem is that when you try to close the gap, you might face issues. So, for example, higher taxes (B) could lead to decreased government spending, which might not be enough to close the gap. Or higher spending (D) is the solution, not a drawback.

But the question is about what's a drawback. So options A and C.

A says unemployment will rise. If the economy is struggling, more people are likely to be unemployed or underpaying. So that's a drawback.

Alternatively, if the government cuts spending (D), that's an opposite action. So D is not a drawback.

So the drawbacks of fiscal policy to close a recession would be things like higher taxes or higher unemployment. The question asks for a drawback, so which one is right.

Wait, also, in the context of closing the gap, are there other factors? For example, higher taxes can lead to lower demand, thus less demand for goods and services, which could lead to lower employment, higher unemployment, and possibly rising prices.

Alternatively, if the government cuts spending, it's the opposite action, so they wouldn't be closing the gap, but just reducing it.

So, the drawbacks would include things like higher taxes (since that's a way to address the demand gap) or perhaps higher unemployment (which is a side effect but also a drawback).

But the question is about the drawback. Which of these is a drawback.

Another angle: when you have a recessionary gap, the government uses fiscal tools. One of the common methods is expansionary policy, which includes increasing government spending and/or cutting taxes. Cutting taxes (D) is an option, but it's the opposite of what the question is about. The question is about closing the gap, so D is an action not a drawback.

So the drawbacks would include things like higher taxes (B) or higher unemployment (A).

Wait, but in reality, if the government is cutting taxes, it's a way to reduce the tax deficit, thereby addressing the recession. So that's not a drawback.

So the drawbacks of using fiscal policy would be things like higher taxes (since you have to raise them to cover the spending), which might cause higher prices (C), but they could also cause higher unemployment (A). Both are drawbacks.

But the question asks for a drawback, so maybe the correct answer is A: unemployment will rise.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

When the economy is in a recession, the government wants to stimulate it. To do that, they can either increase spending or cut taxes. Both are tools. Cutting taxes (D) is a way to close the gap by increasing spending. So D is not a drawback.

If the government cuts taxes, that's a tool to close the gap, not a drawback. So the drawbacks would be the opposite actions. For example, increasing taxes (B) would make the economy worse, so it's a drawback.

So the drawbacks would be things like raising taxes (B) or higher prices (C). But the question is which of the options is a drawback.

Wait, the question is about the drawbacks of using fiscal policy to close the gap. So using fiscal policy to close the gap implies that the solution is to either increase spending or lower taxes.

But the question is about the drawbacks—so when you close the gap, you have to face these issues.

So, if you try to close the recession with fiscal policy, you might have to cut taxes (D), which is an action, not a drawback.

So the drawbacks would be things like raising taxes (B) and/or higher prices (C).

But in the options, C is that prices will rise. So, if the economy is struggling, an increase in demand would push prices up.

So, the correct answer is A: unemployment will rise, and C: prices will rise.

But the question is about the drawback of using fiscal policy to close the gap. So which of these is a drawback.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because when the economy is struggling, you might have to cut jobs, leading to higher unemployment.

Alternatively, higher taxes might lead to lower demand, causing more people to stay in lower-paying jobs, leading to higher unemployment.

So, the drawbacks would include both higher taxes and higher unemployment.

But among the options, A and C are possible.

Wait, the question is about the drawback of using fiscal policy to close the gap. Using fiscal policy to close a recession usually involves increasing spending or cutting taxes. Cutting taxes is a tool, not a drawback.

Thus, the drawbacks would include things like higher taxes (B) and higher prices (C).

Looking at the options, which of these is an option. So the options are:

A: Unemployment will rise.

B: Taxes will have to be raised.

C: Price level will rise.

D: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut.

So, when the government is closing a recession, they might have to cut taxes (D) to prevent the deficit from increasing. But that's not a drawback, it's the opposite. So the drawback would be not cutting taxes, which is not an option.

Alternatively, they might have to raise taxes, which would lead to higher prices and possibly higher unemployment.

So, the drawbacks would include C and A.

But the question is which is a drawback. The question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer is likely to be either A or C.

Wait, the question is about one drawback. The options are A and C.

Wait, the process: when the economy is in a recession, the government is typically trying to stimulate it. To do this, they might increase government spending (like building highways, schools, etc.), which would lead to higher demand, leading to higher prices (C), higher employment (lower unemployment, as more people are employed), and more people employed, which would lead to lower unemployment (A). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, cutting taxes would lead to lower demand, which would reduce employment. So, if the government is closing the gap, they might cut taxes, but that's an action, not a drawback.

So, the drawback would be that when you try to close the gap, you have to pay higher taxes (so option B is raising taxes), which would make demand worse. So, higher taxes would cause people to spend less, hence lower demand, leading to lower real GDP, higher unemployment, and higher prices. So, the drawbacks are B and C.

But the question is about the drawback of using fiscal policy to close the gap. So, using the policy would involve cutting taxes (D), which is not a drawback. So the drawback would be either B or C.

Wait, if the government is trying to close the gap, they might have to raise taxes to cover the budget deficit. So that's a drawback because the demand is insufficient, so higher taxes would prevent that deficit. So, option B.

Alternatively, another point: in the short term, if the economy is in a recessionary gap, the government might cut taxes to increase government spending, which would lead to higher demand and higher prices. So, in that case, the prices would rise (C).

So, the drawbacks of using fiscal policy would include both higher taxes and higher prices. But the question is about which one is a drawback.

Wait, the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer is one letter. So the options are A, B, C, D.

Let me think again about the options:

A: Unemployment will rise.

B: Taxes will have to be raised.

C: Price level will rise.

D: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut.

So, when the government uses fiscal policy to close the gap, they might have to cut taxes (D) to prevent the budget deficit from causing a recession. But that's not a drawback because it's the opposite action. So the actual drawback is not cutting taxes, but other things.

Alternatively, if the government is closing the gap, they might have to raise taxes (B) to reduce the budget deficit. So, when you close the gap, you have to raise taxes, leading to higher prices. So, the drawback would be that higher taxes (B) would have to be raised, leading to higher prices and higher unemployment.

Alternatively, if they cut government spending (D), that's not closing the gap, but trying to address it, so it's not a drawback. So the answer would be A or C.

Wait, when the economy is in a recession, the demand is low. To stimulate demand, the government can either increase government spending or lower taxes.

If they increase spending, they might need to cut taxes to avoid the budget deficit. But this is a way to close the gap, not a drawback.

So, the drawbacks would be:

- If you try to close the gap by increasing spending, you might have to cut taxes (D) or raise taxes (B). Cutting taxes (D) is an action, not a drawback. Raising taxes (B) would be a drawback, as it would lead to higher prices and higher unemployment.

- If you try to close the gap by cutting taxes, you might be increasing demand, but cutting taxes could be a way to address the deficit, so that's not a drawback.

So the drawback would be rising taxes (B) or rising prices (C).

But the options are A, C, B, D.

Wait, the process: when the economy is in a recession, the government uses fiscal policy to close it. So, if they cut taxes (D), that's not opening the gap; it's a way to close it. So D is not a drawback. The drawbacks are things like raising taxes (B), which would prevent the gap from closing, leading to higher prices and higher unemployment. So, the answer would be either A or C.

Alternatively, when you close the gap with fiscal policy, you might have to raise taxes (B) to prevent the deficit, which is a drawback because it would cause the economy to be worse off. So, the answer is B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think of an example. Suppose the economy is struggling, demand is low. The government decides to spend more. To do that, they might have to cut taxes to avoid running out of revenue. So, cutting taxes (D) is not a drawback. The problem is that if you cut taxes, demand could be insufficient, leading to lower real GDP, higher unemployment, and higher prices. So, the drawbacks would be higher prices (C) and higher unemployment (A). But the question is about which is a drawback.

Alternatively, when you try to close the gap, you might have to raise taxes (B) to prevent the government from spending more than it can afford, which would prevent the deficit and help the economy recover. So, option B is a drawback.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. When the economy is in a recession, the government's main tools are fiscal policy: increase spending or cut taxes. Cutting taxes (D) is a way to close the gap but doesn't cause a drawback. The drawbacks would be things like higher taxes (B) or higher prices (C).

The question is about one drawback. The options are A and C.

Wait, the process: when you try to close the recession, you might have to raise taxes. So, for example, if the government is cutting taxes to close the gap, but that's not a drawback. Alternatively, if the government cuts taxes, it would reduce the deficit, so that's not a drawback. So, the drawbacks would be that in order to close the gap, you have to raise taxes (B) or that higher taxes would lead to higher prices (C).

But the question is about the drawbacks of using fiscal policy to close a recession. So, the way the government uses fiscal policy to close the gap is by cutting taxes, but that's not an drawback. Cutting taxes is the opposite. So, the drawbacks are when you try to close the gap, you have to pay higher taxes (so option B is a drawback), which would lead to higher prices (option C), which is also a drawback.

But the question is about the drawback of using fiscal policy. So, using fiscal policy to close the gap implies that you are cutting taxes (D), which is not a drawback. So the drawback would be something else.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it in terms of the options.

The options are:

A: Unemployment will rise.

B: Taxes will have to be raised.

C: The equilibrium price level will rise.

D: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut.

The question is about the drawbacks of using fiscal policy to close a recession.

So, if the government is closing the gap, they might have to cut taxes (D), which is a way to close the gap but not a drawback. Alternatively, if they cut taxes, it's because they're trying to close the gap, but that's not a drawback. So, the drawbacks would be things like raising taxes (B) or higher prices (C).

But the question is about the 'drawback' of using fiscal policy. So, in this context, using fiscal policy to close the gap would require that you cut taxes, but that's not an issue. The drawbacks would be the consequences like higher prices and higher unemployment.

So, the drawbacks are both B and C, but the options are limited.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what happens when you use fiscal policy. If you cut taxes (D), that's cutting the tax deficit, so you're not closing the gap, which is the opposite of what you want. So, the actual drawback is that the government isn't closing the gap because they have to cut taxes, which is not a drawback. So, the drawback is the consequences that occur because you're trying to close the gap: higher taxes, leading to higher prices and higher unemployment.

So, the correct answer is either A or C. But I'm not entirely sure which one is the correct answer.

Alternatively, another approach: as the economy is in a recessionary gap, the government wants to increase spending. They can do this by increasing government spending, which would lead to higher demand. However, to avoid the deficit, they might have to cut taxes (D). Cutting taxes is a tool to close the gap, not a drawback. The drawbacks would be the economic consequences of cutting taxes, such as higher prices (C) and higher unemployment (A).

So, the answer would be A: unemployment will rise, or C: prices will rise.

But the options are exclusive. So, which one applies here?

Wait, if the economy is in a recession, and the government wants to stimulate it, they can either increase government spending or cut taxes. If they increase spending, they might have to cut taxes to prevent the budget deficit, which is a way to close the gap. But that's not a drawback. Alternatively, if they cut taxes, they're not closing the gap but trying to address it, so that's not a drawback either.

So, the drawbacks would be that without cutting taxes, the demand is insufficient, leading to higher prices and higher unemployment.

So, the drawbacks of using fiscal policy to close the gap would be higher taxes (B) and higher prices (C). But the options are A, C, B, D.

The question asks for a drawback of using fiscal policy. So, the answer would be either A or C.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider the basic principles.

When the economy is in a recession, the government uses fiscal policy to stimulate it. The two main tools are:

1. Increase government spending (G) or investment (I) leading to higher demand.

2. Cut taxes (T) to reduce the deficit.

If the government cuts taxes (D), that's a way to close the gap, not a drawback. So, the actual drawbacks are things that happen as a result of trying to close the gap.

So, the consequences would be:

- Higher taxes (B) as the government can't spend the increased amount, leading to lower demand and more people working less, higher unemployment, and higher prices.

- Higher prices (C) because demand is lower.

So, the answer options are A and C. Which one is a drawback.

The question is about the drawback of using fiscal policy to close the gap. So, using fiscal policy to close a recession would require you to have to cut taxes (D) to prevent the deficit, which is an action, not a drawback. So, the drawbacks would be the consequences of that: higher taxes and higher prices.

But the question is about what is a drawback of using fiscal policy. So, the answer is either A or C.

Wait, another angle: when the economy is in a recession, the government can use fiscal policy to stimulate demand. This could involve increasing government spending, which would require cutting taxes to prevent the budget from running into a deficit. But that's a tool, not a drawback. The drawbacks would be the economic impacts, such as higher prices and higher unemployment.

So, the drawbacks are higher prices (C) and higher unemployment (A).

But the question is about the drawback, so the answer is either A or C.

Wait, in the options, A is "unemployment will rise," which is a result of the government trying to stimulate demand through cutting taxes (D), but that's not a drawback. The drawback is that the government can't spend the increased amount, leading to higher taxes and higher prices.

Wait, but the question is about the drawback of using fiscal policy. So, in that context, the answer would be the consequences, like higher prices and higher unemployment.

But the options are A, C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A: unemployment will rise. Because if the government cuts taxes, people might have less work, leading to higher unemployment.

Alternatively, the correct answer is C: prices will rise.

Because when government spending increases, demand goes up, leading to higher prices.

But I'm not sure which is the correct answer based on the options.

After some thinking, I think the correct answer is A: unemployment will rise.

Wait, but when the government cuts taxes, it's an action to address the deficit. So, it's not a drawback. Therefore, the drawback must be higher prices and higher unemployment.

But since the options are A and C, and the question is about one, perhaps the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, I think the correct answer is A: unemployment will rise.

Because, when the economy is in recession, the government tries to stimulate it. They can do this by increasing government spending, which would require cutting taxes to prevent the budget from running into a deficit.

But if they cut taxes, that would mean lower demand. So, in that scenario, the demand is insufficient, so people are forced to work less, leading to higher unemployment.

So, the answer is A: unemployment will rise.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck because I'm not entirely sure whether the drawbacks are higher taxes or higher prices. But since the options are A or C, and the question is about one, perhaps the answer is A.
</think>

The question asks about the drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recession. When the economy is in a recessionary gap, the government aims to stimulate it by increasing demand. This can be achieved through either increasing government spending or cutting taxes.

1. **Increasing Government Spending (G):** If the government increases its spending, it may face a deficit. To address this, it can cut taxes, which reduces the budget deficit and allows the government to spend more. However, cutting taxes is not a drawback; it's a tool to close the gap.

2. **Cutting Taxes (T):** Cutting taxes is a way to reduce the government deficit. However, it is not a drawback because it's the opposite action of closing the gap. The consequences of cutting taxes are higher taxes (B), leading to higher prices (C), and higher unemployment (A).

3. **Consequences of Cutting Taxes (B):** If the government cuts taxes to close the gap, it leads to higher taxes, which in turn increases demand. This results in higher prices (C) and higher unemployment (A).

4. **Consequences of Increasing Spending (G):** If the government increases spending, it may face a deficit. To address this, it can cut taxes, which reduces the budget deficit. However, cutting taxes is not a drawback; it's a tool to close the gap. The consequences of increasing spending are higher taxes (B), leading to higher prices (C), and higher unemployment (A).

5. **Unemployment (A):** If the government cuts taxes, it leads to higher demand, which may reduce people's job opportunities. This leads to higher unemployment (A).

6. **Higher Prices (C):** If the government cuts taxes, it leads to higher demand, which may increase prices (C). This is a consequence of the gap-closing process.

7. **Higher Taxes (B):** If the government cuts taxes, it leads to higher demand, which may lead to higher taxes (B). This is a consequence of the gap-closing process.

After considering all the options and the consequences of cutting taxes, the drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recession is higher taxes (B) and higher prices (C). However, since the question asks for one specific answer, the correct choice is **A: Unemployment will rise**. This is because when the government cuts taxes, it leads to higher demand, which may reduce people's job opportunities, leading to higher unemployment (A).

ANSWER: A
