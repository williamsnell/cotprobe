Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electron diffraction. Hmm, I need to find the speed an electron must be accelerated to have a wavelength of 100 picometers. Right, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is involved here. Oh wait, de Broglie's equation is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum. Momentum is mass times velocity, so p = m*v.

Wait, yeah, the formula is lambda = h/(mv). Oh, but wait, I need to make sure about the units. Right, the wavelength is 100 pm, which is 100 picometers. That's 100e-12 meters. Planck's constant, h, is usually given as 6.626e-34 J·s. The mass of an electron is about 9.109e-31 kg. Hmm, let's plug those numbers in.

So, lambda = h/(mv). Rearranging, v = h/(m*lambda). Let me compute that. Let me plug the numbers in step by step.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
m = 9.109e-31 kg
lambda = 100e-12 m

So v = (6.626e-34) / (9.109e-31 * 1e-2)  because 100e-12 is 1e-10, wait no, wait. Wait, 100 pm is 100 x 1e-12 meters, which is 1e-10 meters. Oh wait, no, 1e-12 multiplied by 100 is 1e-10? No, wait, 100e-12 is 1e-10? Because 100 is 1e2, so 1e2 * 1e-12 is 1e-10. So 1e-10 meters.

So denominator is 9.109e-31 kg * 1e-10 m = 9.109e-41 kg·m.

Wait, let me compute that denominator: 9.109e-31 * 1e-10 is 9.109e-41.

So v = 6.626e-34 / (9.109e-41) = ?

Calculating 6.626e-34 divided by 9.109e-41.

First, 6.626 / 9.109 is approximately around 0.726.

Then, the exponents: 1e-34 divided by 1e-41 is 1e7. So 0.726e7, which is 7.26e6 m/s.

Wait, but that gives approximately 7.26e6 m/s. Looking at the options, option F is 7.27e6 m/s. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, sometimes I get confused about the exponents. Let me double-check.

h = 6.626e-34
m*lambda = 9.109e-31 * 1e-10 = 9.109e-41

So 6.626e-34 / 9.109e-41 = (6.626 /9.109) * 1e7.

6.626 divided by 9.109... Let me compute that more accurately. 9.109 is about 9.109. So 6.626 ÷9.109 ≈ 0.726 approximately.

So 0.726e7 is 7.26e6 m/s. So about 7.26e6 m/s, which is 7.27e6 when rounded. So option F matches that.

Wait, but the options are:

A: 9.45e6
B:4.89e6
C:3.14e6
D:5.38e6
E:12.67e6
F:7.27e6
G:6.22e6
H:10.33e6
I:8.11e6
J:11.00e6

So F is 7.27e6, which is the value I got. So the correct answer should be F.

To determine the speed at which an electron must be accelerated to have a wavelength of 100 pm, we use the de Broglie equation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}
\]

Rearranging for velocity \(v\):

\[
v = \frac{h}{m \cdot \lambda}
\]

### Given:
- Wavelength: \(\lambda = 100 \, \text{pm} = 100 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)
- Planck's constant: \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)
- Mass of an electron: \(m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\)

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
v = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1 \times 10^{-10}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1 \times 10^{-10} = 9.109 \times 10^{-41}
\]

Now, divide:

\[
v = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{9.109 \times 10^{-41}} = \left(\frac{6.626}{9.109}\right) \times 10^{7}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{6.626}{9.109} \approx 0.726
\]

Thus:

\[
v \approx 0.726 \times 10^{7} = 7.26 \times 10^{6} \, \text{m/s}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:

\[
v \approx 7.27 \times 10^{6} \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Conclusion:
The speed of the electron is approximately \(7.27 \times 10^{6} \, \text{m/s}\), which corresponds to option **F**.
