Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: A disk of radius 0.1 meters is initially at rest and undergoes an angular acceleration of 2.0 radians per second squared. We need to find the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk in 4.0 seconds. The options are from A to J, with various numerical values.

Hmm, okay. So, angular acceleration. I remember that angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity. Since the disk starts from rest, the initial angular velocity is zero. Angular acceleration (α) is 2.0 rad/s².

Wait, the disk's radius is 0.1 m, so the linear distance a point on the rim travels would be the arc length, right? Arc length s is given by s = rθ, where θ is the angular displacement in radians.

So, the key is to find θ after 4 seconds and then multiply by the radius to get the distance.

But wait, I need to calculate the angular displacement θ. Since the disk starts from rest, the initial angular velocity ω₀ is zero. So, I think the formula for angular displacement when starting from rest is θ = 0.5 * α * t². Because when you integrate angular acceleration over time, the initial velocity is zero.

Yes, because angular displacement θ = (1/2) α t² + ω₀ t. Since ω₀ is zero, it's just (1/2) α t².

So plugging in the numbers: α is 2.0 rad/s², time t is 4.0 seconds.

θ = 0.5 * 2.0 * (4)^2.

Let me calculate that. 4 squared is 16. 0.5 * 2 is 1. So 1 * 16 is 16 radians. So θ is 16 radians.

Now, the distance traveled is the arc length s = r * θ. The radius r is 0.1 m, so s = 0.1 * 16 = 1.6 meters.

Looking at the options, option J is 1.6 m, right? So the answer should be J.

Wait, but hold on, did I consider everything correctly? Because sometimes when you calculate angular displacement, especially in such problems, you might have to make sure the units are right. But here, everything's in meters and seconds, so I think it's fine.

Another way to think: angular acceleration is 2 rad/s²; over 4 seconds, the average angular velocity would be (0 + 2*4)/2 = 4 rad/s. So, average velocity is 4 rad/s. Multiply by time: 4 rad/s *4 s=16 rad. Same result. So yes, the distance is 16 * 0.1 = 1.6 m.
</think>

To determine the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk, we calculate the angular displacement and then use the arc length formula. The disk starts from rest, so the initial angular velocity is zero. The angular acceleration is given as \( \alpha = 2.0 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \), and the time is \( t = 4.0 \, \text{s} \).

The angular displacement \( \theta \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\theta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2.0 \cdot (4.0)^2 = 0.5 \cdot 2.0 \cdot 16 = 16 \, \text{radians}
\]

The linear distance traveled by a point on the rim is the arc length \( s \), given by:

\[
s = r \cdot \theta
\]

where \( r = 0.1 \, \text{m} \) is the radius of the disk. Substituting the values:

\[
s = 0.1 \cdot 16 = 1.6 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk is \( 1.6 \, \text{m} \).
