Hmm, okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about two statements related to machine learning models. Let's see, I need to figure out which option is correct. 

The question has two statements: Statement 1 and Statement 2. I'll have to evaluate each one to determine if they're true or not.

Statement 1 says, "Besides EM, gradient descent can be used to perform inference or learning on Gaussian mixture model." From what I remember, EM and gradient descent are both optimization methods used for parameter estimation. Gaussian mixture models involve finding parameters that maximize the likelihood, which is a typical problem that can be solved using EM. So EM is definitely used. But does gradient descent alone do the same? I think yes, because gradient descent is another optimization technique. So Statement 1 is asserting that besides EM, which is true, gradient descent is also used. So Statement 1 is true. 

Now Statement 2: "Assuming a fixed number of attributes, a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier can be learned in time linear in the number of records in the dataset." Hmm. Bayes optimal classifier is one that achieves the best possible performance given the training data. It's based on the posterior probabilities. Now, linear time in the number of recordsâ€”so O(n) time. 

Wait, Gaussian-based methods often involve computing means and variances. For example, in a Gaussian Naive Bayes model, each feature is assumed to be Gaussian distributed. If the number of features is fixed, then for each data point, you process each feature. But if the number of records is n and the number of features is k, the time complexity would be O(nk). If k is fixed, then it's O(n), which is linear. So assuming a fixed number of attributes (features) would make the time linear. So Statement 2 is true.

So both statements are true, which would make option C the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: Statement1 T, Statement2 P
B: S1 P, S2 F
C: T, T
D: S1 F, S2 P
E: F, F
F: S1 P, S2 P
G: T, F
H: P, P
I: F, T
J: S1 P, S2 T

So C is correct. So the answer is option C.

The two statements are both true. Statement 1 uses gradient descent alongside EM for Gaussian mixture models, and Statement 2's time complexity is linear with fixed attributes. Thus, both are true.

Answer: C
