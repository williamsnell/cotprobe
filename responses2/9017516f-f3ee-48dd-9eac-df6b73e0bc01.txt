Okay, so I've got this question about S corporation taxation, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again.

The question says that the sole shareholder contributed equipment with a fair market value of $20,000 and a basis of $6,000, subject to $12,000 liability. I need to determine the amount of gain the shareholder must recognize. The options are A through J, with various amounts.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on corporate tax rules, but I'll try to remember. I think in an S corporation, distributions are taxed as long-term capital gains, right? Because unlike pass-through corporations where distributions are ordinary income, S corporations pass their income to shareholders as gains.

So, the first thing I should calculate is the gain. Gain is usually calculated as the adjusted basis minus the adjusted fair market value (AFM V) of the property received. But wait, I think the standard for S corporation gain is that the value of the contribution is treated as the AFM V. 

Wait, no, I'm mixing up a few points. Let me think again. In S corporations, the shareholder's basis is adjusted against the contributed property. So, the basis is $6,000, and the FMV is $20,000. So the basis is lower than FMV, which means the shareholder has a gain. So the gain would be FMV minus basis, which is $20,000 - $6,000 = $14,000.

Wait, but some sources say that in S corporations, the gain isn't taxed unless it's over the basis. Oh, right, the gain is calculated as the FMV minus the basis. If the basis is less than FMV, it's a gain. So here, the gain would be $14,000.

Wait, but then there's the liability part. Liabilities are treated differently. I remember that S corporations don't have a basis limit on the liabilities. So the shareholder's basis is subject to the liability, but the gain is calculated based on the FMV.

Wait, so the basis is $6,000, and the FMV is $20k. The gain is $14,000. But the basis can't be negative, but here it's $6k, which is positive.

Wait, but the options are about the gain, so the answer would be $14,000. Looking at the options, option F is $14,000.

Wait, but wait another moment. Some sources say that the gain is calculated as the adjusted basis minus the adjusted fair market value. Or maybe it's the other way around? No, wait. If FMV is higher than basis, the gain is FMV - basis. So yes, $14k.

But wait, another point: in S corporations, the shareholder's basis is subject to the liability. The basis can't go below the amount owed, but in this case, the basis is $6k, and the liability is $12k. So the shareholder's basis is $6k, which is less than the liability. So the liability can be recovered, but the basis doesn't have to be less than the liability. Wait, no, the basis is the cost basis. I think the basis can't exceed the liability because the shareholder can't have a basis higher than the liability. Wait, no, actually, the basis is the amount the shareholder paid. The liability is the amount they are owed. So the basis must not exceed the liability because the basis is the amount you paid, and the liability is the amount you're owed. So if you paid $6k and are owed $12k, the basis can't be more than $12k. Wait, that makes sense because the shareholder can't have a basis higher than what they are owed, otherwise, it's a negative basis, which is possible in some situations but not in S corporations. Wait, but does S corporations allow negative basis? Or is the basis limited to the liability?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. In S corporations, the basis is subject to the liability. The basis is the cost basis. So the basis can't exceed the amount owed by the shareholder. So if the basis is $6,000 and the liability is $12,000, the basis is within the liability. So the gain is $14,000. Therefore, the correct answer would be $14,000, which is option F.

Wait, but wait again. Another part of the question: is there any other factor I'm missing? For example, any taxes on the liability? Or is the question only asking about the gain?

The question says, "What amount is the gain, if any, that the shareholder must recognize." So the focus is on the gain, which is just the FMV minus basis. So that's $14k.

So I think the correct answer is F: $14,000.

The question involves calculating the gain recognized by a sole shareholder in an S corporation who contributed equipment with a fair market value (FMV) of $20,000 and a basis of $6,000, subject to a $12,000 liability. 

In S corporations, distributions are taxed as long-term capital gains. The gain is calculated as the FMV minus the basis, regardless of the liability. Here, the FMV is $20,000 and the basis is $6,000, resulting in a gain of $14,000. 

The liability does not directly affect the gain calculation in this context. The basis ($6,000) is within the liability ($12,000), so no further adjustments are needed. 

Thus, the correct answer is **F: $14,000**.

Answer: F
