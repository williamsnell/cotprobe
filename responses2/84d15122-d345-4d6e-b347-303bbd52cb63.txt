Okay, so I have this question about Anscombe's critique of Butler. Hmm, I remember that Anscombe is a philosopher who wrote about Kant, so it's a bit technical. The question is about what Anscombe criticizes Butler on regarding a certain concept. The options are A to J, each tying to different ideas like freedom, pleasure, ethics, moral truth, etc.

Wait, I think I remember that Anscombe was particularly critical of Kant's concept of "identity" and "self." But I'm not entirely sure about the exact points. Let me think. Oh right, Anscombe, in his work "The Thought of John Stuart Mill" and "The Thought of Kant," discussed the differences between Mill's and Kant's views. 

I believe he pointed out that Kant's concept of the "self" is too simplistic because it's based on the idea that the self is an objective entity. But that might relate to the self in general, not specifically identity. Alternatively, I think he criticized the notion of "identity" as too subjective because the self is a singular entity but the world is diverse. 

Wait, the options are A to J. Let's look at each.

Option I: "the concept of 'identity' is too subjective." That sounds familiar. Anscombe argued that the self is too subjective, so identity is part of that. 

Option J: "the concept of 'self' is ill-defined." That also rings a bell. He thought the self is too complex and that the concept of identity is flawed because it's too subjective.

Wait, but the question is about Butler. Did Anscombe critique Butler specifically on a certain point? Or is the question a general one about Anscombe's views? Because the options are about concepts, so perhaps it's a general point.

Alternatively, I'm trying to recall if there's a specific point about identity or self in Butler's work that's being criticized by Anscombe.

Wait, in the paper, Anscombe compares Kant's "identity" with Mill's. He says that Mill's concept is too simplistic because it assumes identity as an objective entity, whereas Kant's is about the individual's own identity, which is too subjective. So, the idea of identity is subjective, which is what he's saying.

So, if the question is about Butler, perhaps the options are about different concepts. Wait, the question is about what Butler is criticized for, but the options are about concepts that are wrong. Alternatively, the question is about what Anscombe is criticizing Butler on.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.

The question is: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, the answer is a letter, like A to J, and the last letter of the response is the chosen one.

But the question is asking, what does Anscombe criticize Butler on regarding a certain concept. So, the options are the concepts being criticized.

Wait, no, the question is about a point that Butler was criticized for. Or is it that the question is giving a list of possible points and we have to choose the one Anscombe criticized Butler on?

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased is that the last character is the letter chosen, which is the answer. So the question is, which of the options (A to J) is the one that Anscombe criticizes Butler on.

Wait, perhaps the options are all possible concepts that Butler was criticized on, and the question is which one Anscombe is pointing out.

Alternatively, the question is about a specific concept.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

Option I: the concept of "identity" is too subjective. So, Anscombe is saying that identity is too subjective, which he argues against. So, perhaps in his critique, he says that the self is too subjective, which would be option I.

Option J: the concept of "self" is ill-defined. That would align with the same point, as the self is subjective.

Wait, but the question is about Butler. How does that fit in?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concept of identity. Or the concept of self.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the concept of "ought" which is incoherent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concept of " pleasure" being unclear.

Wait, I'm not remembering exactly. I think that in the paper, Anscombe argues that Kant's concept of "identity" is too simplistic because it's based on an objective idea, making the self too subjective. So, the concept of identity is too subjective.

Alternatively, I think that the concept of identity is too subjective.

So, the options are:

A: freedom is too simplistic.

B: pleasure is unclear.

C: labeling oneself is absurd.

D: moral truth is a contradiction.

E: we can't distinguish between good and evil.

F: consciences are fallible.

G: moral obligations are incoherent.

H: moral obligations are incoherent.

Wait, options H and G are the same. But the question is, what is the correct answer.

Wait, I think I read that in the paper, he argues against the idea that the self is an objective entity. So, he says that the self is too subjective, and thus the concept of identity is too much of a subjective thing.

So, the correct answer is I: the concept of "identity" is too subjective.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is "the concept of 'identity' is too subjective."

So that's one possibility. Alternatively, option J: "the concept of 'self' is ill-defined." I'm not sure which one is correct.

Wait, I think in the paper, he argues against the idea that the self is an objective entity. So, he points out that the self is too subjective, which is about the concept of identity.

Wait, but the question is about Butler. So, perhaps the answer is about the self.

Wait, but the question is, what does Anscombe criticize Butler on regarding a certain concept.

Wait, perhaps the answer is about the concept of "moral truth." But I don't remember that.

Alternatively, perhaps the concept of 'identity' is too subjective.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to remember the exact point from the paper.

In "The Thought of Kant," Anscombe compares the concept of identity in Kant's philosophy with Mill's. He says that Mill's concept is too simplistic because it assumes that identity is an objective entity, whereas Kant's concept is about the individual's own identity, which is too subjective.

So, the idea of identity is too subjective, which is option I.

Alternatively, he argues against the idea that the self is an objective entity, which would be option J.

Wait, the options are A to J. The question is what he criticizes Butler on regarding "a certain concept."

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, the answer is a letter, like I or J, but the question is about what he criticizes Butler on.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are not about concepts but about Butler's work. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concept of 'identity.' So, the answer is I.

But I'm a bit confused because I'm not certain which one, but based on what I remember, the answer is likely I or J.

Wait, the question is about Butler. So, perhaps the answer is about the self being ill-defined, which is option J.

Wait, but I think he's criticizing Butler's concept of identity. So, the correct answer is I.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. I think the answer is I, the concept of identity is too subjective.

Alternatively, the answer is J, the concept of 'self' is ill-defined.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about how the answer is presented. The options are A-J, and the last letter is the letter chosen. So the answer is a letter, like I or J.

Wait, the answer is option I: the concept of "identity" is too subjective.

Alternatively, another possibility: the concept of 'ought' is incoherent. But I think that's option G, but the question is about Butler.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option I, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option J.

Wait, this is a bit tricky. I think I'm going to go with option I, because in the paper, he's discussing identity as subjective, which is about the self.
</think>

The correct answer is I: the concept of "identity" is too subjective. Anscombe argues that the self is too subjective, which relates to the concept of identity. 

Answer: I
