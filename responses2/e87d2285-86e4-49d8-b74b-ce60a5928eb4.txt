Question:

A healthy 4-year-old girl is brought for a well-child examination. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border. S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration. A soft mid-diastolic murmur is heard along the lower left sternal border. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Mitral valve prolapse
B: Tricuspid atresia
C: Transposition of the great arteries
D: Tetralogy of Fallot
E: Atrial septal defect
F: Ventricular septal defect
G: Coarctation of the aorta
H: Mitral regurgitation
I: Aortic stenosis
J: Pulmonary stenosis

Okay, so I just came across this medical question, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question is about a healthy 4-year-old girl with a well-child visit. She has a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border. Additionally, there's a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left. No other abnormalities are noted. The options are various heart conditions, and I need to determine which is the most likely diagnosis.

First, I remember that ejection murmur (EM) is one of the early signs of a heart issue, especially in children. The grade 2/6 suggests a significant valve problem, which could be a serious issue. Systolic murmur can come from different sources: aortic, ventricular, or heart valves.

The first thing that comes to mind is an aortic stenosis. But wait, a stenosis would cause a more regular ejection murmur, perhaps with a regular rhythm. The question mentions a grade 2/6, which is high, so that's probably a valve issue or a heart defect.

Looking at the options, the possible ones are A: Mitral valve prolapse, B: Tricuspid atresia, C: Transposition of the great arteries, D: Tetralogy of Fallot, E: Atrial septal defect, F: Ventricular septal defect, G: Coarctation of the aorta, H: Mitral regurgitation, I: Aortic stenosis, J: Pulmonary stenosis.

I should think about what each of these conditions looks like in the context of the ejection murmur.

Mitral regurgitation is when the left atrium empties into the left ventricle. The ejection murmur here is usually a regular, high-pitched, and somewhat regular. But the question says it's along the sternal border, so that might not fit.

Atrial septal defect (option I) is a small hole in the atrium between the two atria. The ejection murmur in this case might be a regular murmur, but the description here involves the sternal border, which points to stentors or aneurysms near the heart.

Transposition of the great arteries (option C) involves the aorta and pulmonary artery switching places. That could cause a murmur, but the ejection is along the sternal border, which I think is more indicative of a stenosis or an aneurysm.

Aortic stenosis (option I) is a narrowed part of the aorta. The ejection murmur would be high-pitched, regular, and usually has a regular rhythm. However, the grades here are 2/6, which is high, so maybe this isn't from a stenosis.

Wait, but the ejection is along the sternal border. That makes me think of a stenosis, particularly coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation refers to a narrowed aorta that curves back, causing a stenosis. The sternal border is often the site of a stenosis or a curved aorta.

Alternatively, an aortic septal defect (like option I) might have a sternal border, but I think it's more about a stenosis.

Another possibility is a ventricular septal defect (option F), which causes a murmur that's more regular and has a normal rhythm. But the grades are high, so not sure.

Wait, the first murmur is along the upper left sternal border. I think that's a sternal stenosis or aneurysm, which could be coarctation. The second murmur is mid-diastolic, lower left. That could be a regurgitation, but I think that's more with the left ventricle. Or perhaps it's a valve issue.

Wait, but the first murmur is a large ejection. High grade 2/6 suggests a significant heart defect. So, in children, maybe a coarctation of the aorta (G) or an aortic septal defect (I) could cause that.

But I think the primary ejection is along the sternal border, which is more indicative of a stenosis. So, coarctation of the aorta (G) would have a sternal border, as the aorta is narrowed, causing a stenosis.

Another point to consider: the second murmur is along the lower left, which is the same region as the first. Could this be a stenotic aorta? Or maybe it's a problem with the aorta, like a septal defect.

Wait, but when you have a stenosis, the ejection is high-pitched and regular. But in this case, the ejection is along the sternal border, which is more suggestive of a stenosis.

So, the options are G (coarctation) or I (aortic septal defect). The question doesn't mention any specific location besides the sternal border.

Wait, what's a coarctation? It's when the aorta curves back, causing a stenosis. So, the aorta is narrowed, which would create a stenotic effect, leading to a high ejection.

Alternatively, a septal defect would cause a murmur but wouldn't cause ejection along the sternal border.

Another point to think about: the ejection along the sternal border is more indicative of a stenosis than a septal defect. Because in a septal defect, the ejection would be more regular.

So, if option G is coarctation, that would create a stenosis, leading to the ejection along the sternal border.

So, the most likely diagnosis is G: Coarctation of the aorta.

The patient is a healthy 4-year-old girl with a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left. The ejection murmur is high-pitched and regular, which is inconsistent with a normal murmur. The absence of other abnormalities suggests a serious heart condition. 

The sternal border ejection is characteristic of a stenosis or aneurysm, particularly coarctation of the aorta (G). Coarctation involves a narrowed aorta, causing a stenosis and high-pitched ejection. In contrast, aortic septal defect (I) typically causes a regular murmur, not along the sternal border. 

Given the high grades of the ejection murmur and the sternal border, the most likely diagnosis is **G: Coarctation of the aorta**.

Answer: G
