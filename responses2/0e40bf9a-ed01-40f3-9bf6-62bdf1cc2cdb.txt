Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that X and Y are random variables with certain expected values and variances. Specifically, E(X) is 312, var(X) is 6, E(Y) is 307, and var(Y) is 8. The question is asking for the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y. The options are A through J, each with different expected values and variances.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the expected value and variance of sums of random variables, there's some basic rules I need to apply. Let me try to recall them.

First, the expected value (mean) part. I think the expected value of the sum of two random variables is just the sum of their expected values. So E(X + Y) should be E(X) + E(Y). Let me plug in the numbers: 312 + 307. Oh wait, 312 plus 307 is 619. So the expected value of X + Y is 619. Looking at the options, options C, H, I, J, and F have this expected value of 619. The others have 307 or 312, which I think is the individual expected values of X or Y, not the sum.

Now, the variance part. I remember that variance has some rules when you have sums. For variance, if you have two independent random variables, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances. But wait, the question doesn't mention anything about independence. So do I need to assume independence? Or does the problem give enough information?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about X and Y being independent. So I can't assume that. But wait, the question is about the expected value and variance of X + Y without any other information. Hmm. Oh wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the variance of X + Y is actually Var(X) + Var(Y) plus 2 times the covariance between X and Y. So Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2 Cov(X,Y). But the problem doesn't provide the covariance. So without knowing Cov(X,Y), I can't compute the variance of X + Y.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the variables are just given with their E and var values. But no covariance is given. So this raises a question: are we supposed to know that the covariance is zero because variables are independent, but that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the question is assuming that X and Y are independent, but that's not stated either.

Wait, but in the options, the variance of X + Y is either 6, 14, 8, 10, or 14. Hmm, without knowing the covariance, I can't compute the exact variance. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me go back to the question.

Wait, the problem says that var(X) is 6 and var(Y) is 8. So Var(X + Y) = 6 + 8 + 2*Cov(X,Y). But without Cov(X,Y), I can't compute the exact value. So how do I proceed? Because without that information, like the covariance, I can't get the variance of X + Y.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have a correct variance. Because if X and Y are independent, then Cov(X,Y) is zero, so Var(X+Y) would be 6+8=14. And 14 is an option (H and J). But other options don't have that. Alternatively, if X and Y are dependent, Cov could be something else, but without knowing, I can't proceed.

Wait, but the question is about the expected value and variance. Since the expected value can be uniquely computed (as 619), but the variance depends on the covariance. But wait, the problem doesn't provide any covariance. So perhaps the variance is not uniquely determined.

Wait, but wait again. Let me reread the question. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake. The question says "the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y." But perhaps the problem is that X and Y are independent. Or perhaps it's a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistyped, and it's supposed to say that X and Y are independent.

Wait, but the question doesn't state that. So perhaps the problem is that we can't compute the variance without knowing the covariance, but that doesn't make sense because the options don't include a correct option based on that.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go back to the problem statement.

The variables are X and Y. E(X)=312, var(X)=6. E(Y)=307, var(Y)=8. So E(X+Y) is 312 + 307 = 619. That's correct, so the expected value is 619. So any option that has E(X+Y) not 619 can be eliminated. Looking at the options, options A, B, F have E=307 or 312, which is individual, so they are incorrect. So only C, H, I, J, and G are left.

But the variance part is the issue. If I can't compute it because I don't know the covariance, but the options don't have a correct variance. So perhaps in this case, the answer is that there's insufficient information, which would be option G. But let me think again.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is a trick. Oh, wait, wait. No, the question is about X + Y, and the variables are given with E and var. But the question doesn't specify anything about X and Y being independent. So the variance of X + Y is Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2 Cov(X,Y). But since Cov(X,Y) is not provided, we can't determine the exact variance. So perhaps the correct answer is that the variance is unknown, so we can't answer. But looking at the options, perhaps the variance is 14, which is an option (H), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the problem assumes that X and Y are independent, but that might be an assumption not given. Alternatively, perhaps the question is written wrong, and the variables are independent. But the problem says nothing about that.

Wait, but in the options, the variance of X + Y is either 6, 14, 8, 10, or 14. Wait, wait, looking at the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, let me list them:

A: E=307, var=10

B: E=307, var=6

C: E=619, var=14

D: E=619, var=7

E: E=312, var=14

F: E=312, var=8

G: Insufficient info.

H: E=619, var=8

I: E=619, var=6

J: E=619, var=10

So none of the options have E=619 except C, H, I, J, and G. So if we can't compute the variance, the correct answer would have E=619, but the variance is not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but without the covariance, we can't compute the variance of X + Y. So the variance of X + Y is Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2*Cov(X,Y). But without Cov(X,Y), we can't find it. So unless Cov(X,Y) is zero, the variance can't be determined.

Wait, but in the absence of any information about covariance, perhaps the answer is that it's insufficient, which is G. But I'm not sure because other options don't fit that scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that X and Y are independent, so Cov(X,Y) is zero. Then the variance would be 6 + 8 = 14. Then, the variance of X + Y is 14. So then, looking at the options, H and J have E=619 and var=8, and I and J have var=6 and var=10. Wait, but 14 isn't one of the options for variance. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but wait. No, the options for variance are 6, 8, 10, 14. So if the covariance is zero, then variance is 14, but 14 is an option (H and J). But without the covariance being zero, that's not possible. So perhaps the intended answer is that the variance is 14, but I'm not sure how that comes into play.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the covariance is given as zero. But no, the problem doesn't state that. So I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The problem statement says that X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 312, var(X) = 6, E(Y) = 307, var(Y) = 8. But nothing about dependence or covariance. So the variance of X + Y is Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2*Cov(X,Y). Without Cov(X,Y), we can't compute the exact variance.

But the options don't include any variance that is 14 (which would be if Cov is zero) or any other number. So perhaps the correct answer is that the variance is 14 and E is 619, but the variance is not among the options. But looking again, option H has E=619 and var=8, and option J has var=10. Neither is 14.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, no, Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2 Cov(X,Y). So unless Cov is given, I can't compute this. So without knowing Cov(X,Y), I can't find the variance of X + Y. So the variance is unknown.

Wait, but the problem is multiple-choice, and the options don't have an option with E=619 and Var=14. So perhaps the answer is that the variance is unknown, and thus option G is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is the only one that says there's insufficient information. So perhaps that's the intended answer. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects variance to be 14, but that would require Cov(X,Y) = 0.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that. So I'm a bit torn.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is written incorrectly and the covariance is zero. Then, the variance would be 6 + 8 =14, which is option H. But in that case, the correct expected value is 619, which is in option C. So option C would be E=619 and Var=14. So the answer would be C, but that's only true if Cov(X,Y)=0.

But the problem doesn't state that. So perhaps it's a trick question where the assumption is that Cov(X,Y)=0, but that's an assumption not given. So the problem is perhaps a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the answer that the expected value is 619, but the variance is 14, so option C. But without the covariance, it's impossible to say. So perhaps the intended answer is C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check: Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2 Cov(X,Y). So if the Cov is zero, it's 6+8=14, which is an option. So if that's the case, the answer is C. But if the Cov is not zero, then the variance is higher. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is C, because that's the only option with E=619.

Wait, but why would the answer be H or J? Because maybe the problem assumes that X and Y are independent, so Cov is zero, and thus the variance is 14. So perhaps the correct answer is C: E=619, Var=14. But that's only correct if Cov=0, which isn't stated.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to say that X and Y are independent. But since the problem doesn't say that, I can't assume that.

Wait, but looking at the options, the variance of X + Y is either 6, 8, 10, 14. So if the variance is 14, it's an option. So perhaps the answer intended is that the variance is 14, making option H correct.

Wait, but the expected value is 619, which is in C, H, I, J, and G. So without more information, I can't say for sure. So perhaps the correct answer is that the expected value is 619 and the variance is 14, making option C correct. But that's only if Cov is zero, which isn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to accept that without covariance, the variance can't be computed, so the correct answer is G. But that's not among the options except for G, which says 'insufficient information.'

Wait, but looking back, the options for E are 307, 312, or 619. So the only E that's 619 is C, H, I, J. So the only possible correct E is 619, so the correct answer must have E=619, which is options C, H, I, J, or G.

So the variance must be 14, which is in H and J. So the correct option is C (E=619, Var=14) if Cov=0. But without that, I can't know.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is to find E(X+Y) and Var(X+Y). The expected value is 619 (C, H, I, J, G), and the variance is 14 (H and J). So since Var(X+Y)=14 is an option, perhaps the intended answer is H or J. But without knowing Cov, I can't compute this. But the problem might be assuming independence, which is a common assumption unless stated otherwise.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state independence. So perhaps the intended answer is that the variance is 14, so the correct option is H. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is testing knowledge that if two variables are independent, Cov=0, so Var(X+Y)=14. So the correct answer is H: E=619, Var=8. Wait, no, 6+8 is 14, not 8. So H has Var=8, which would require Cov= - (8-14)/2 = -3, which isn't stated. So no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the problem. The problem says 'random variables' with E(X)=312, var(X)=6, E(Y)=307, and var(Y)=8. So E(X+Y) is 312 + 307 = 619, which is correct. The variance is Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2 Cov(X,Y) = 6 + 8 + 2 Cov(X,Y) = 14 + 2 Cov(X,Y). But since Cov is unknown, we can't compute it. So the variance of X + Y is unknown.

But the options don't have a variance of 14 + 2 Cov. So perhaps the correct answer is G: insufficient information.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is the only option that says 'insufficient information' to answer. So perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because the problem is about X and Y, but without knowing their covariance, the variance of their sum can't be determined. So in that case, the correct answer is G.

So the answer is G: Insufficient information to answer this question.
</think>

The expected value of \( X + Y \) is calculated as \( E(X) + E(Y) = 312 + 307 = 619 \). The variance of \( X + Y \) requires knowing the covariance between \( X \) and \( Y \), as it is given by \( \text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y) + 2\text{Cov}(X, Y) \). Since the covariance is not provided, the variance of \( X + Y \) cannot be determined. Therefore, the correct answer is that there is insufficient information to answer this question.
