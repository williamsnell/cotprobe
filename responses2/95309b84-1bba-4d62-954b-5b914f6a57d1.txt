Question:

A chef owned a summer cottage on the lake. In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the chef entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the chef proceeded to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant. Shortly after the assistant took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the assistant's property. The assistant's strongest argument in an action against the neighbor for removal of the barriers, which are obstructing his access to the property, would be that

Options:

A: the neighbor's sand business constitutes a misuse of the easement.
B: the chef's improvements to the roadbed grant him additional rights to the easement.
C: the chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could "tack on" their successive use periods.
D: an easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.
E: the assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded.
F: because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement.
G: the assistant has a legal right to improve the easement for his own use.
H: the assistant is entitled to compensation for the damage caused by the neighbor's sand business.
I: the assistant can claim ownership of the easement due to his long-term use of the property.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about easements, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think this through carefully. Let's start by breaking down the facts.

The scenario is about a chef who owns a summer cottage on a lake. He agreed with a neighbor to grant him a right-of-way over a strip of land. The land is 30 feet wide and a quarter of a mile long along the eastern margin. The chef used this right-of-way to pave the road, making it easier for motor vehicles, but then later the neighbor started a sand business which needed heavy hauling. This destroyed the asphalted road. Ten years later, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant. The assistant then built wooden barriers to block access to his property. Now, the question is about the strongest argument the assistant can make against the neighbor's barriers.

The options are A to I, each suggesting a different legal principle. So I need to determine which of these applies to the situation.

First, let's understand the legal concepts involved. An easement is a conveyance that grants someone the right to use another's land. There are two main types: easements on land (appurtenant) and easements on water (easements at sea). This one seems to be an easement on water since it's a lake and the right-of-way is along the eastern margin, which is probably along the shore.

The initial grant is to the chef. The neighbor granted him a right-of-way. But the neighbor, in writing, granted it. So the easement is recorded with the grantor (chef) as the owner. That's important because if it's unrecorded, it's not a valid easement.

The chef then used this right-of-way to pave the road. Now, the neighbor's sand business required heavy hauling, which destroyed the asphalt. So the road was damaged, and the neighbor's business was affected. The neighbor then erected wooden barriers to obstruct the access to the assistant's property.

The next part is about the legal arguments. The assistant is suing the neighbor for the obstruction of access. We need to figure out which argument the strongest one would be.

Let's go through the options:

A: The neighbor's sand business constitutes a misuse of the easement. Misuse would mean the neighbor used the easement improperly. But the neighbor only used the easement to pave the road, not to use the land for sand business. So maybe not misuse, since the business was on the land, but the easement was granted for road purposes. So maybe not.

B: The chef's improvements grant him additional rights. But the improvements were for the road. The neighbor's business was on the land, not on the road. So the easement is on the land, the improvements were on the road. So B might not apply.

C: The chef and assistant could tack on their successive use periods. Tack-on refers to using subsequent periods after the easement is in place. But the easement was granted before the neighbor's sand business. The neighbor's business happened a few years later. So when the neighbor started the business, was there a period of use for the easement? If the easement was recorded, the grantor (chef) has a right of use. But since the neighbor's business was after the grant, I don't think the easement period was tacked on. So maybe C isn't applicable.

D: The easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege. Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Appurtenant easements are usually in the land, where the easement is tied to the land. The question is about the property transfer. But the neighbor's sand business is on the land, which was part of the tenement. The transfer of possession would affect the easement. But I'm not sure if it's about appurtenant easements. Maybe not D.

E: The assistant is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded. Wait, but the easement was recorded with the neighbor's grant, right? So the grant was to the chef, which was recorded, so the easement is valid. But the neighbor's business was after the grant. So if the neighbor's business was on the land, which was part of the easement's dominant tenement, then the easement is still valid. But the question is about the obstruction caused by the neighbor's business, which is a separate entity. So maybe E isn't the strongest argument. The neighbor's business was on the land, so the easement is still valid. The obstruction by the business might not be a separate event affecting the easement, because the easement was recorded and is valid.

F: Because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement. Hmm. Prescriptive easements are created when the use is continuous and the same person uses it for a continuous period, which triggers the prescriptive right. Implication refers to the easement being created by the land's condition or implied by the use. So in this case, the neighbor's sand business was on the land. The neighbor's business made the land impregnable, which could have created a prescriptive easement. But the grant was to the chef, not the neighbor. So if the neighbor created the easement by implication, but the grantor is the chef, then this might not apply. The grant was to the chef, but the neighbor's business could have implied the easement. But since the grant was to the chef, who is the owner, it's unclear if the neighbor's business created the easement. So perhaps F isn't correct.

G: The assistant has a legal right to improve the easement for his own use. Wait, the easement is already recorded. The grant was to the chef, so improvement of the easement would be the chef's use. The assistant is a successor to the easement. So perhaps the chef could tack on the use periods, but the question is about the assistant's rights. Alternatively, the assistant's rights depend on whether he has a right of use.

H: The assistant can claim ownership of the easement due to his long-term use. Since the easement is an appurtenant easement, transfer of ownership would pass the easement. The assistant used the property for a long time, so he has the right. So H might be a strong argument.

I: The assistant can claim ownership due to long-term use. That is, the easement is appurtenant, so transfer of ownership passes the easement. So the assistant can use the easement. So I is also a possible argument.

Wait, so looking back, options D and I are both about the easement. Let me think again.

The question is about the strongest argument. The key here is whether the easement was recorded or not. The grant was to the chef, but the neighbor's sand business was after that. Since the grant was recorded, the easement is valid. Now, the neighbor's business was on the land, but it's not the same as the easement. The neighbor's business created the impregnable barrier, but the easement was already in place. So the neighbor's business is on the land, but the easement is already there. So when the neighbor built barriers, he wasn't using the easement; he was using the land. So the neighbor's business doesn't affect the easement. Therefore, the neighbor's actions don't negate the easement. So the obstruction by the business doesn't affect the easement. So the strongest argument would be about the easement's validity and whether the transfer of ownership passes it.

Now, the question is about the legal principle. If the grant was to the chef, and he's the owner, then if the neighbor's business didn't use the easement, but the easement is valid, then the neighbor's business doesn't affect the easement. So the obstruction by the neighbor's business is a separate issue. But the question is about the strongest argument against the neighbor's barriers.

Wait, the question is about the strongest argument the assistant can make against the neighbor for removal of the barriers. So the barriers were built after the neighbor's business. So the barriers were built on the land, which was impregnable, so the neighbor's business was on the land, which was not used for the easement. So the barriers didn't affect the easement.

So the neighbor's business is on the land, which was the dominant tenement. So the neighbor's business didn't use the easement. Therefore, the neighbor's business doesn't negate the easement. So the barriers were built on the land, but the easement is still there.

So the strongest argument would be about the appurtenant easement. The transfer of ownership of the dominant tenement passes the easement. The assistant's ownership of the property is a right of use, so he can use the easement. So option H is about the assistant's right to use the easement.

Alternatively, if the neighbor's business was a separate use, but the easement was already in place. So the neighbor's business doesn't affect the easement.

So the assistant's strongest argument is that he has a right of use, which passes the easement. So the answer is H.
</think>

The strongest argument the assistant can make against the neighbor for removing the barriers is that he has a legal right to use the easement. Since the easement is appurtenant and tied to the dominant tenement, the transfer of ownership passes the easement. The assistant, as a successor to the property, has the right to use the easement. 

ANSWER: H
