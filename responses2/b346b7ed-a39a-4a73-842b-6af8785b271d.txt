Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about anthropoidea, hominidae, and hominoidea. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out by going through each term step by step.

First, I remember that these terms are part of分类学, specifically the classification of primates. I think the hierarchy of primates is something like: Primates are divided into several orders, each containing various families, species, and subspecies. The term "anthro" comes from "anthropos," meaning "human," and it refers to primates that are related to humans. So, Anthropoidea would be the group of primates that include humans and their immediate ancestors.

Now, hominidae. I think this group includes humans and all of our immediate ancestors, which are the hominid family. So, hominid families include humans, our great apes (like our forefathers, which are in the hominid family), and our immediate ancestors like our hominins (like our apes). So, hominidae would include all humans, the great apes, and their ancestors.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how hominidae is structured. The hominid family is the basis, so hominidae would be all descendants, including humans and their direct ancestors. So, the correct description would include all humans, the great apes, and their immediate ancestors like our modern apes.

Now, hominoidea. I'm less sure about this. I think hominoidea refers to the older, more primitive group of primates. They are the ones that lived before humans and were not closely related to humans. So, they would be the group that includes primate species like primates, lemurs, taxons, and other primates.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard hominoidea referred to as the "other species" or "non-hominid" group. So, hominoidea would be the group that includes species that are not closely related to humans, like the New World monkeys (like gorillas, chimpanzees) and the Old World monkeys (like lemurs, taxons).

Looking back at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: Anthropoidea are the primitive primates. Hominoidea are the tailed anthropoids. Hominidae includes gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan. Hmm, wait. I thought hominidae includes all great apes, including humans. So A's description about hominidae including great apes makes sense. But about hominoidea, it says tailed anthropoids, which doesn't sound right. Also, the term "tailed" might not be correct; I think it's more about the type of primate, not tail structure. So I'm not sure about this option.

Option B: Anthropoidea are higher primates excluding humans. Hominoidea consists of lesser apes and gibbons. Hominidae includes all great apes. So, this option is saying that Anthropoidea are higher than humans (like primates, apes, etc.), which is correct. Hominoidea includes gibbons, which are Old World monkeys, which aligns with what I thought. Hominidae includes great apes, which is correct. So B seems correct so far.

Option C: Anthropoidea include all extinct primate species. Hominoidea are arboreal. Hominidae consists of new world monkeys and humans. Hmm. I think Anthropoidea includes all, including extinct species, but I'm not sure if it includes all. Also, hominoidea being arboreal might be incorrect because, historically, primates were more arboreal. Also, hominoidea being arboreal doesn't seem right. Plus, I thought hominoidea was about the non-hominid group, which includes lemurs and others, not just arboreal. So I'm leaning against C.

Option D: Anthropoidea are suborder of primates excluding prosimians. Hominoidea includes all non-ape. Hominidae is restricted to African apes. Not sure about this. I think anthropoidea includes all except humans, but D says they exclude prosimians. I think prosimians are included in anthropoidea but not in hominidae. Also, hominoidea includes non-ape, which would include many species, not just African ones. So D might not be correct.

Option E: Anthropoidea encompass all primates. Hominoidea refers to lesser apes and tarsiers. Hominidae includes modern and extinct monkeys. Wait, I'm not sure about hominoidea. Earlier, I thought hominoidea is older group, not including tarsiers. Also, I'm not so sure about "tarsiers" being part of hominoidea. So E seems incorrect.

Option F: Anthropoidea are lower primates. Hominoidea are small apes. Hominidae includes fossil apes. Wait, lower primates are primate order, not the suborders. Also, hominoidea including small apes (like small apes are not tarsiers or lemurs). So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Anthropoidea are New World monkeys. Hominoidea are Old World monkeys. Hominidae includes gibbons. Well, New World monkeys are part of hominidae, and Old World are a hominid group. Hominidae includes the Old World monkeys as well. So G seems correct.

Option H: Anthropoidea are the branch of primates including lemurs and lorises. Hominoidea are large-bodied. Hominidae consists of all modern and extinct monkeys. I think hominidae includes lemurs and others, and hominoidea are the older group. Also, hominoidea includes lemurs, which are large-bodied. So H's description seems correct.

Option I: Anthropoidea are higher primates. Hominoidea is great apes and man. Family Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. This seems correct because higher primates would include humans, and hominoidea includes primates, including humans. Hominidae would include humans and their ancestors. So I is correct.

Option J: Anthropoidea are subgroup of primates that are neither monkeys nor apes. Hominoidea includes bipedal. Hominidae group composed of modern humans and Neanderthals. I'm not sure about this one. Anthropoidea as subgroup that's neither monkeys nor apes? That doesn't seem right. Also, hominoidea would be the older group, which includes apes and lemurs. So J is probably incorrect.

Looking back, options B, G, and I seem correct.

Wait, but I need to figure out which one is the correct answer. Let me read each term again.

Anthropoidea: All primates except humans, including lemurs, taxons, etc.

Hominidae: All humans, great apes, and their ancestors.

Hominoidea: All non-human primates, including lemurs and others.

So let's check each option again:

Option B:
Anthropoidea = higher primates excluding humans. Correct.
Hominoidea consists of lesser apes and gibbons. Wait, hominoidea includes lemurs and others, not just gibbons. Also, the term "lesser apes" might be a mix. Alternatively, perhaps the option is correct in saying hominidae includes all great apes.

Wait, option B says hominidae includes all great apes, which is correct. So B is possible.

Option I: Anthropoidea are higher, hominoidea is great apes and man. Family Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. That makes sense because higher includes humans, and Hominidae includes all humans and their ancestors.

But let me look back at the options.

Wait, the correct definitions I know are:

Anthropoidea are the most modern and primitive primates, including lemurs, horse sharing, etc. Hominidae includes humans and all of their immediate ancestors. Hominoidea are the older group, including lemurs and other primates.

So, the correct option would be one that defines these terms correctly.

Looking at the options again:

Option I: Anthropoidea are higher primates. Correct, as higher primates include humans. Hominoidea includes great apes and man. Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. That seems accurate.

Option B: Anthropoidea are higher except humans. Correct. Hominidae includes all great apes. That's correct. Hominidae includes humans.

Wait, the option says "Hominidae includes all great apes, including humans and their immediate ancestors." That's correct. So, option B and I seem correct.

Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive, so only one is correct.

Wait, I remember that Hominidae includes humans, not just great apes. So the option where hominidae includes all great apes is correct, which is option B.

Hmm, but another thought: the hominid family is the basis for hominidae. So, hominidae includes humans and great apes.

So, the correct option should have hominidae correctly described.

Looking back, option I says hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. That's correct.

But looking at the other options, option B's hominidae includes all great apes, which is correct. So both B and I seem correct.

Wait, but the options are options A to J, each is an independent choice. So I need to find which one accurately describes the terms.

Wait, perhaps only one option is correct.

Let me go through each option again:

Option I: Anthropoidea are higher, hominidae family includes great apes and modern man. Hominidae includes fossil and modern humans. That's correct.

Option B: Anthropoidea are higher (excluding humans). Hominidae includes all great apes. Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

But let's think about the other options, like option G: Anthropoidea include New World monkeys, which are part of hominidae. Hominoidea includes Old World monkeys. So G is correct.

So now I'm confused because multiple options might be correct. But the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct definitions are:

Anthropoidea: All primates except humans.

Hominidae: All humans, Great Apes, and their ancestors.

Hominoidea: All non-human primates, including lemurs and others.

Looking at the options, which one correctly describes these.

Option I says:

Anthropoidea are higher primates. Correct.

Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. Correct.

Hominidae has hominidae including all great apes. Correct.

So option I is correct.

Option B:

Anthropoidea are higher except humans. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

So B is also correct.

So the problem is that the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, the right definitions must be:

Anthropoidea: The most primitive and modern primates, including lemurs and others.

Hominidae: All humans, great apes, and their ancestors.

Hominoidea: The older group, which includes lemurs, taxons, etc.

So, looking at the options, option I says: Anthropoidea are higher primates. Correct.

Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes, including humans and their ancestors. Correct.

So option I is correct.

What about option B?

Anthropoidea are higher except humans. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes, which is correct.

So option B is correct as well.

Wait, perhaps the options are structured so that more than one option is correct, but in reality, only one is. So I need to check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, option I says:

Anthropoidea are higher primates. Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. Hominidae includes all great apes. So option I is correct.

Option B: Anthropoidea are higher except humans. Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

So both I and B are correct? But the options are single-choice.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the correct definitions are:

Anthropoidea: All primates except humans.

Hominidae: Humans, great apes, and their ancestors.

Hominoidea: All non-ape primates, including lemurs and others.

So, which option correctly reflects this?

Looking at option I:

Anthropoidea are higher primates. Correct.

Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

So I is correct.

Option B: Anthropoidea are higher except humans. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

Wait, but both B and I are correct?

No, because in the options, each is a separate choice, so only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definitions. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the terms. Hominoidea is the older group, including lemurs and others, and hominidae includes humans and great apes.

So, all right, in the options, which one correctly describes the terms.

Option I: Correct, because Anthropoidea are higher primates (including humans), Hominidae includes fossil humans and modern humans, and includes all great apes.

Option B: Correct, because Anthropoidea are higher except humans, Hominidae includes all great apes.

Wait, but why would both B and I be correct? Because each option is a separate possibility.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the terms are mutually exclusive. Wait, no, the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, let me think again.

The options are:

I: Anthropoidea higher, hominidae includes fossil, hominidae includes all great apes.

So, correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is B, because I'm not sure if 'higher primates including humans' is accurate.

Wait, perhaps the correct definitions are:

Anthropoidea: the most modern primates, including lemurs, etc.

Hominidae: includes humans and all great apes.

Hominoidea: older group, including lemurs and others.

So, looking at the options again.

Which option correctly describes these?

Option I says:

Anthropoidea are higher primates. Correct.

Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

So option I is correct.

Option B says:

Anthropoidea are higher except humans. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

So both I and B are correct. But that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about the correct definitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, which is the one that correctly describes all three terms.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option I: Anthropoidea are higher primates. Hominoidea is the family that includes fossil men and modern man. Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man, and all great apes.

Yes, that's correct.

Option B: Anthropoidea are higher except humans. Correct. Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct. Hominoidea includes all non-ape, including lemurs, etc. Wait, but none of the options mention hominoidea in B, so perhaps B is correct.

Wait, the question is about the definitions of these three terms, and each option defines two or three of them.

So, each option is a combination of three terms, but the correct combination is only one.

Looking for the correct definitions:

Anthropoidea: All primates except humans.

Hominidae: All humans, great apes, and their ancestors.

Hominoidea: All non-ape primates, including lemurs and others.

So, which option correctly describes these.

Looking at option I:

Anthropoidea are higher primates. Correct.

Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

So I is correct.

Option B:

Anthropoidea are higher except humans. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

So B is also correct.

Hmm. So the issue is that both I and B are correct. But since the options are exclusive, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that combines all three correct.

Option I includes:

Anthropoidea: higher primates. Correct.

Hominidae: includes fossil men and modern man. Correct.

Hominidae: includes all great apes. Correct.

So option I is correct.

But I'm not certain because option B also seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall the correct definitions.

Anthropoidea: The most modern and primitive group of primates, including lemurs, horse sharing, etc. They are the ones that include humans and the ancestors.

Hominidae: All humans, the great apes, and their ancestors.

Hominoidea: The older group of primates, including lemurs and others.

So, the correct option must have all three correctly described.

Looking at option I:

Anthropoidea higher primates. Correct.

Hominidae includes fossil men and modern. Correct.

Hominidae includes all great apes. Correct.

So option I is correct.

But wait, in the options, option I's hominidae includes fossil men and modern, which is correct.

So the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but the options are as I listed, so I think the correct answer is option I.
</think>

The correct answer is **I**.

**Explanation:**

The question asks for the correct definitions of anthropoidea, hominidae, and hominoidea. Here's how each option is evaluated:

1. **Option I:**
   - **Anthropoidea are higher primates.** Correct, as higher primates include humans.
   - **Hominidae includes fossil men and modern man.** Correct, as hominidae includes humans and their ancestors.
   - **Hominidae includes all great apes.** Correct, as hominidae encompasses humans and the great apes.

2. **Option B:**
   - **Anthropoidea are higher primates excluding humans.** Incorrect, as higher primates include humans.
   - **Hominidae includes all great apes.** Correct, as hominidae includes humans and the great apes.
   - **Hominidae includes all great apes.** Correct, as hominidae encompasses humans and the great apes.

3. **Option G:**
   - **Anthropoidea are New World monkeys.** Correct, as New World monkeys are included in anthropoidea.
   - **Hominidae are Old World monkeys.** Incorrect, as hominidae includes humans and the Old World monkeys.
   - **Hominidae includes gibbons.** Incorrect, as hominidae includes humans and the Old World monkeys.

4. **Option H:**
   - **Anthropoidea are the branch of primates including lemurs and lorises.** Incorrect, as anthropoidea includes lemurs and humans.
   - **Hominino includes lesser apes.** Incorrect, as hominoidea includes lemurs and humans.
   - **Hominidae includes lemurs.** Correct, as hominidae includes lemurs.

5. **Option J:**
   - **Anthropoidea are the subgroup of primates that are neither monkeys nor apes.** Incorrect, as anthropoidea includes humans and the other primates.
   - **Hominino includes bipedal.** Incorrect, as hominoidea includes primates, not bipedal animals.
   - **Hominidae includes fossil apes.** Correct, as hominidae includes fossil apes.

After evaluating each option, only **Option I** correctly describes all three terms. It accurately defines anthropoidea as higher primates, hominidae as the family of humans and great apes, and hominoidea as the older group of primates, including lemurs and others.

ANSWER: I
