Question:

Which of these explains why t should be used instead of z for inference procedures for means.

Options:

A: The use of t instead of z is simply a convention in statistics, with no mathematical reason.
B: The Central Limit Theorem applies to means but not proportions.
C: We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal. Means are not.
D: We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.
E: We use t for means because the sampling distribution of sample means is approximately normal, but that is not the case for proportions.
F: When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.
G: The Central Limit Theorem applies to proportions but not means.
H: We use t for means because it provides a more accurate estimate of the population mean.

Okay, so I have this question about why we use the t distribution instead of the z distribution when doing inference procedures for means. I remember that when the sample size is small, especially if the population isn't normally distributed, we use t. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact reasoning.

Let me think about the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Oh right, the CLT says that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution. But wait, if the population is already normal, then the sampling distribution is exactly normal. So when the sample size is small (like less than 30), we don't rely on the CLT, and thus the z distribution is used.

So why t distribution? Oh, because the t distribution accounts for the extra variability in the sample standard deviation. Unlike the z, which uses the population standard deviation, the t distribution has heavier tails, which account for the uncertainty in estimating the population standard deviation from the sample. The t distribution is more about the uncertainty in the sample mean's precision. So when the sample size is small, using t is safer because it's more likely to capture the true population mean.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B says CLT applies to means but not proportions. That's right. The CLT applies to the sampling distribution of the mean, not the proportion. So for proportions, we have the normal approximation, but for means, we rely on the t-corrected standard error because we don't know the population variance.

Option D and E talk about proportions. D says the t is used because proportions are approximately normal. That's not right. The sampling distribution of proportions is approximately normal when np and n(1-p) are both large, but that's a different scenario. For means, it's the CLT that allows us to use the normal approximation (but for small n, we use t instead of z).

Option G says CLT applies to proportions but not means. That's correct, because the CLT applies to the distribution of the sample mean, not the proportion.

So the question is about why t is used for means. Let's see the options. The correct reasoning is that for small samples, the CLT doesn't apply, so the t distribution is used because it's more robust, accounting for the variability in the sample standard deviation. So the correct reasoning is in option D: we use z for proportions because the sampling distribution is normal, but not for means.

Wait, option B says the CLT applies to means but not proportions. That's a correct statement, but it's about whether we can use CLT. The question is about why t is used. So the reason is that when using z, we need the CLT, but when using t, it's because of the uncertainty in estimating the standard deviation. So the reasoning is about the t distribution's use because of the uncertainty in the standard deviation, which is why option D is correct because it says we use z for proportions (so that's correct) but not for means. Because for the means, when the sample is small, the t distribution is used because it accounts for the extra variability. So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D: We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.

Option B is correct but not the reasoning for using the t distribution. Option D correctly states why the t distribution is used for means, as it accounts for the uncertainty in estimating the standard deviation, which is not the case for proportions.
