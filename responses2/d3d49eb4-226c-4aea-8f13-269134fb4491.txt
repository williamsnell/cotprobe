Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about allele frequency and how it changes when immigrants come into a population. Hmm, I remember something about the concept of allele frequency change after immigration. 

The setup says the initial frequency of allele S is 0.65 in a population of 100. Then, one new immigrant with S is 0.85 comes in every generation. We need to find the new frequency after one generation. Wait, but wait—what's the generation rate here? Oh, the question says one new immigrant per generation, so each generation, one immigrant arrives.

Wait, but the options are all pretty close, so maybe I need to calculate step by step. Let me think about how allele frequencies change when new immigrants come in.

So, the initial population has 100 individuals, right? So, the number of S alleles initially is 0.65 * 100 = 65. The other alleles are 35. But when a new immigrant comes, we have to consider that they have a certain allele frequency, which is 0.85 in this case. So the new immigrant contributes S alleles as 0.85.

Wait, but when the immigrant is added, how does that affect the overall population? Do we have to consider their contribution to the gene pool? Oh, because the new immigrant is a single individual, the population size stays the same (assuming no deaths or other factors), but the allele frequency changes because of the addition.

Wait, the initial population is 100, so the number of new S alleles from the immigrant is 1 (the immigrant) multiplied by 0.85 (the S frequency). So, 1 * 0.85 = 0.85 S alleles added. But wait, the immigrant is just one person, so the total number of individuals remains 101 after adding them, but the question says one new immigrant per generation. Wait, wait, no—wait the question says the rate is one new immigrant per generation. So each generation, one new person comes in. So the population increases by one each generation.

Wait, but the question asks for the frequency after one generation. So the population would go from 100 to 101 after adding one new immigrant. But wait, perhaps we should model this for one generation, considering that the new immigrants add S alleles, and the existing population's alleles stay the same except for the new immigrants.

Wait, no—wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's model this properly.

In the initial population (generation 0), there are 100 individuals. 65 are S, 35 are other alleles. Now, a new immigrant (generation 1) with 0.85 S comes in. So that's 1 person, 0.85 of whom are S. Wait, but 0.85 is the frequency, so the number of S alleles in the immigrant is 0.85 * 1 (since one person). So 0.85 S alleles. So the total number of S alleles after adding this immigrant would be the original 65 plus 0.85. Wait, but that would be fractional, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps the immigrant's S frequency is 0.85. So, if the immigrant is 1 person, the number of S alleles would be 1 * 0.85 = 0.85. But this is a fractional S allele—does that make sense? Or maybe I should think of it as the proportion of the population that has S. Alternatively, perhaps the way to model this is to calculate the new allele frequency considering the addition of the new immigrant.

Wait, another approach: the frequency of S after immigration can be calculated using the formula for introducing new alleles. The formula I remember is:

In a population of size N, the new frequency (p_new) after introducing a new allele is given by (p * N + s * 1) / (N + 1), where p is the initial frequency and s is the frequency of the new allele. Wait, but that might not be exactly right. Or perhaps the formula is:

p_new = (p * N + s * 1) / (N + 1)

Assuming that N is the initial population size, and s is the frequency of the new immigrant. So in this case, N is 100, p is 0.65, and s is 0.85.

So plugging the numbers in: (0.65 * 100 + 0.85 * 1 ) / (100 + 1) = (65 + 0.85)/101 = 65.85 / 101.

Let me compute that. 65.85 divided by 101. 101 goes into 658 how many times? 6 times 101 is 606. So 6*101=606, 7*101=707. Wait, 658 is less than 707, so 658-606=52. So 658.85? Wait, wait, 65.85 is 6585/100. Hmm, perhaps I should do it step by step.

65.85 / 101: Let's compute this. Let's see, 101 * 0.65 = 65.65. So 0.65 would give 65.65. But we have 65.85, which is 0.20 more. So 0.65 + (0.20/101) ≈ 0.65 + 0.00198 ≈ 0.65198. Approximately 0.652.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.652. So the answer would be C.

But wait, wait another thing. The initial population is 100, so the number of S alleles is 65. Then, 100 people have 65 S. Then, 1 new person comes in with 0.85 S. So the new S count is 65 + (1 * 0.85) = 65.85. The population is 101. So 65.85 / 101 = 0.65198, which is 0.652 approximately.

So the answer should be C.
</think>

To calculate the new frequency of allele S after one generation, we use the formula for introducing new alleles into a population:

\[
p_{\text{new}} = \frac{p \cdot N + s}{N + 1}
\]

Where:
- \( p \) is the initial frequency of allele S (\( p = 0.65 \)),
- \( N \) is the initial population size (\( N = 100 \)),
- \( s \) is the frequency of the new immigrant with allele S (\( s = 0.85 \)).

Plugging in the values:

\[
p_{\text{new}} = \frac{0.65 \cdot 100 + 0.85}{100 + 1} = \frac{65 + 0.85}{101} = \frac{65.85}{101} \approx 0.65198
\]

This rounds to approximately \( 0.652 \).

Thus, the frequency of allele S after one generation is **0.652**.
