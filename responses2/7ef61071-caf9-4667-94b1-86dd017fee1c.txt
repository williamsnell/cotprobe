Okay, so I have this question about the last character of the answer in an out-of-character exercise like sprinting. Hmm, I remember that in exercise physiology, fibres are categorized based on their properties. I think they're called 'type' fibres, like Type I, Type II, etc.

Wait, the question is about the last character of the answer. The options are all different types of fibres. Let me think about the types. I recall that the fibres are classified into different types based on their properties. There are several types, such as Type I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX. 

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact order and which ones are associated with certain types of exercise. Sprinting, I think, is a type I exercise. Let me think. Sprinting involves a lot of high-intensity activity, which probably involves a lot of type I fibres. Because type I fibres are known for their high intensity and high power output. They are often associated with activities like high-intensity interval training or sprinting.

So the first type of fibres to fatigue in a sprint would be type I. Let me look at the options. Option J is Type I fibres. Are any of the other options related to that? The question is about the first to fatigue, so it's type I.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused about the order. Are there any other fibres that might be involved in sprinting? For example, does the order change with different exercise types? I think sprinting is a type I exercise, so the fibres involved are type I. But I'm not entirely sure if there are any other types. Alternatively, maybe some fibres can be used in other types of exercises.

Oh, right, in some cases, the same type of fibres can be used in different exercise types. But the question is about the first to fatigue in a sprint, which is type I. So the correct answer should be J: Type I fibres. That's the first type to fatigue in sprinting.

Wait, but let me think again. I remember that sprinting is actually a type I exercise, so the same fibres as type I. Also, I think that in some contexts, the first few fibres to fatigue in sprinting are Type I, which are the strongest. So I'm pretty confident that answer is J.

The correct answer is **J: Type I fibres**. Sprinting is a type I exercise, and the first type of fibres to fatigue in such an activity are type I. 

Answer: J
