Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The problem says:

"A mass of 100 grams stretches a spring 5 centimeters. If the mass is set in motion from its equilibrium position with a downward velocity of 10 cm/s, and if there is no damping, determine when does the mass first return to its equilibrium position."

Hmm. So I'm supposed to find the first time the mass returns to equilibrium after being set in motion. I remember this is a simple harmonic motion problem, right? Without damping, so it's just a pure oscillation.

Wait, let me think. The mass is 100 grams, which is 0.1 kilograms. It stretches the spring 5 cm, which is 0.05 meters. So when it's stretched 5 cm, the spring force equals the weight of the mass. Maybe I can find the spring constant first.

Oh, right! Hooke's Law says F = kx. Here, F is the force, which is mg. So F = m * g. So k = F/x = m g / x.

Let me calculate that. m is 0.1 kg, g is 9.8 m/s², and x is 0.05 m. So k = (0.1 kg * 9.8 m/s²) / 0.05 m. Let's compute that.

0.1 * 9.8 is 0.98, divided by 0.05 is 19.6 N/m. So k is 19.6 N/m. Got it.

Now, when the mass is released from equilibrium with an initial velocity, that's the angular frequency part. The formula for angular frequency ω is sqrt(k/m). Wait, but wait, I think there's a mistake. The angular frequency for a mass-spring system is ω = sqrt(k/m). But wait, sometimes I've seen it written as sqrt(k/m), yes. So let me compute that.

k is 19.6, m is 0.1. So ω² = 19.6 / 0.1 = 196. So ω is sqrt(196) which is 14 rad/s. Wait, that seems high. Because 19.6 divided by 0.1 is 196, so sqrt(196) is 14. So the angular frequency is 14 rad/s. That's correct.

Now, the motion is simple harmonic. The displacement as a function of time is given by x(t) = A sin(ω t + φ), but since it's set from equilibrium with a downward velocity, I think the initial conditions can be used to find the phase.

Wait, but wait. At t=0, the mass is at x=0 (equilibrium), and the velocity is 10 cm/s. So x(0)=0, and the velocity v(0) = 10 cm/s. Hmm.

So let's model this. The displacement is x(t) = A sin(ω t + φ). At t=0, x=0, so A sin(φ) = 0. So either A is zero (which it's not, since there's displacement) or φ is an integer multiple of π.

Wait, more accurately, when x=0, the sine function is zero, so φ must be either 0 or π. But wait, the velocity is 10 cm/s downward. Let me compute v(t) as the derivative of x(t).

v(t) = dx/dt = A ω cos(ω t + φ). At t=0, v=10 cm/s. So 10 = A ω cos(φ). 

But x(0) = A sin(φ) =0, so sin(φ)=0. So φ must be 0 or π. Let's see. Then, what's the velocity.

If φ is 0: then cos(0)=1, so v = A ω. So 10 = A * 14. So A = 10 /14 = 5/7 meters. Or 7.14 cm? Wait, no, wait. Wait, units here need to be consistent. Let me check: x is 5 cm, which is 0.05 m. So the velocity when x=0 is 10 cm/s, which is 0.1 m/s.

Wait, so let me recompute. m is 0.1 kg, g is 9.8 m/s². So k = m g / x = (0.1 *9.8)/0.05 = (0.98)/(0.05) = 19.6 N/m. Then ω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(19.6 / 0.1) = sqrt(196) =14 rad/s.

So ω is 14 rad/s.

Now, when x =0, the displacement is zero. So the amplitude is determined by the initial velocity. Because, in SHM, the maximum velocity occurs at x=0, which is called the equilibrium point.

Wait, no. Actually, the maximum velocity occurs at the equilibrium position because the displacement is zero, so the velocity is maximum. So, the amplitude A is the maximum displacement from equilibrium multiplied by the angular frequency? Wait, no. Wait, the maximum velocity is A ω. Because velocity is dx/dt = A ω cos(ω t + φ). The maximum of cos is 1, so max velocity is A ω.

In this case, the initial velocity is 10 cm/s, which is 0.1 m/s. So, 0.1 = A *14 → A= 0.1 /14 = 1/(140) meters, which is 1 cm? Wait that can't be right: 1/140 m is 0.00714 meters, which is 7.14 mm, not 1 cm. Oh wait, wait, 0.1 m/s divided by 14 rad/s gives A = 0.1 /14 = 0.00714 m, which is 7.14 mm. Wait, but that's a very small amplitude. Hmm.

Wait, but the mass is stretched 5 cm from equilibrium, so maybe the amplitude is larger. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The maximum velocity is A ω, and that's given as 10 cm/s (0.1 m/s). So A = 0.1 /14 = 0.00714 m or 7.14 mm. So that's correct. So the maximum velocity is 10 cm/s, which occurs at x=0.

Wait, but the initial displacement is zero, so the maximum velocity is achieved at equilibrium. So the amplitude is 7.14 mm. So that's the maximum displacement.

Wait, but the question is about when the mass first returns to equilibrium. So, the first time it's back at x=0, which is when sin(ω t) is zero. Because x(t) = A sin(ω t). So x(t) =0 when sin(ω t) =0. So the solutions are ω t = n π, where n is integer. The smallest positive time is when n=1, so t = π/(ω) = π/(14) seconds. So that's the time when it first returns to equilibrium.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the initial conditions. Because the mass is released from equilibrium with an initial velocity downward. So at t=0, x=0, v=10 cm/s. So yes, the equation x(t) = A sin(ω t) would be correct, because at t=0, it's zero, and the velocity is A ω cos(0) = A ω, which is 0.1 m/s. So A is 0.1/14 meters, which is about 7 mm. So yes, the first time it returns to equilibrium is at t=π/(14) seconds. Looking at the options, option J is π/14 s. So the answer should be option J.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. So, ω is 14 rad/s, correct. So the period is 2π/14 = π/7 s? No, no, the period is 2π divided by ω. So T = 2π/14 = π/7 s. But the question is about the time to first return to equilibrium, which is half the period? No, wait, no. Because in SHM, the mass passes through equilibrium every half period. Wait, no, actually, the time between two consecutive passages through equilibrium is the period. So the time to reach equilibrium again after starting from equilibrium is half the period? Wait, no. Wait, once you pass equilibrium, you have to go to the other side, so that's a full period. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing this.

Wait, in SHM, the mass passes through equilibrium once every half period. So the first time it returns to equilibrium is after a time of one half period.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me imagine the motion. When you release the mass from equilibrium with velocity v, it will move downward. It passes through equilibrium at t=0, and the first time it comes back is after a full period. Because, the period is the time to complete a full oscillation—so after one full period, the mass returns to the starting point, which is the equilibrium position. So the time to first return is the period. But wait, the options include π/14, which is half the period (since half period is π/7, which is about 0.448 s, and π/14 is about 0.224 s. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because once you pass equilibrium, you have to go to the other side, so that's a full period.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think about the phase. When you have x(t) = A sin(ω t + φ). At t=0, x=0, so sin(φ) must be zero, so φ=0 or π. Then the velocity is v(t) = A ω cos(ω t + φ). At t=0, v=10 cm/s, which is positive (downward). So, v = A ω cos(φ). If φ=0, then cos(0)=1, so v = A ω = 10 cm/s. So A= 10/(ω) = 10/(14) = 5/7 m = 714 mm? Wait, no, 10 cm/s is 0.1 m/s, so A is 0.1 / 14 = 0.00714 m.

So the displacement is x(t)=0.00714 m sin(14 t). We need to find when x(t) is zero again. So 0.00714 sin(14 t) =0. So sin(14 t) =0. So 14 t = n π. So t= n π/(14). The first positive time is when n=1: t= π/(14) s. So that's option J.

So the correct answer is J: π/14 s.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the mass-spring system using simple harmonic motion principles. The mass stretches the spring 5 cm (0.05 m) under gravity, and the spring constant \( k \) is calculated using Hooke's law:

\[
k = \frac{mg}{x} = \frac{(0.1 \, \text{kg})(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2)}{0.05 \, \text{m}} = 19.6 \, \text{N/m}.
\]

The angular frequency \( \omega \) is then determined by:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{19.6}{0.1}} = \sqrt{196} = 14 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

The mass is released from equilibrium with an initial velocity of \( v_0 = 10 \, \text{cm/s} = 0.1 \, \text{m/s} \). The displacement as a function of time is given by:

\[
x(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi),
\]

where \( A \) is the amplitude and \( \phi \) is the phase constant. At \( t = 0 \), \( x(0) = 0 \), so \( \sin(\phi) = 0 \), implying \( \phi = 0 \) or \( \pi \). The initial velocity is:

\[
v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = A \omega \cos(\omega t + \phi).
\]

At \( t = 0 \), \( v(0) = 0.1 \, \text{m/s} \), so:

\[
0.1 = A \cdot 14 \implies A = \frac{0.1}{14} \approx 0.00714 \, \text{m}.
\]

The displacement equation becomes:

\[
x(t) = 0.00714 \sin(14t).
\]

To find when the mass first returns to equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), we solve:

\[
0.00714 \sin(14t) = 0 \implies \sin(14t) = 0.
\]

The smallest positive solution is when \( 14t = \pi \), so:

\[
t = \frac{\pi}{14} \, \text{s}.
\]

This corresponds to option **J**. The mass first returns to equilibrium at \( t = \pi/14 \, \text{s} \).
