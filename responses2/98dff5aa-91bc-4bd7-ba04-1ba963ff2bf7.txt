Question:

Are Python variable names case-sensitive?

Options:

A: Yes
B: It's machine-dependent
C: No
D: It's operating system-dependent

Okay, I need to figure out whether Python variable names are case-sensitive. I remember that in some programming languages, like C or Java, variable names are case-sensitive. But I'm not sure about Python.

So, I'll think about the basics. In Python, variables are just names. Does the case matter? Like, in C, a variable named 'a' is different from 'A'. But wait, have I heard of any case-sensitive rules in Python?

I think I've seen some examples where the case affects whether a variable is valid or not. Or maybe it's not the case in Python. Let me think. Oh wait, in Python, variables are case-insensitive in terms of naming conventions. So, you can have variables named 'MyVar', 'myVar', 'mYVar'… etc. That's different from other languages.

So, in Python, variable names are case-insensitive. That means the case doesn't affect whether the variable is valid or not. So, the answer should be No, which would be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. What about keywords or reserved words? Like, if the name is a keyword, does case matter? I think in Python, variable names can't be reserved keywords because that's how it's supposed to work. So, for example, 'if' is a keyword, and you can't use it as a variable name. So, the case doesn't matter for keywords either.

So, the case is irrelevant for variable names. So, the correct answer is No, which is option C.

Looking back at the options:

A: Yes → Incorrect, because case doesn't matter.

B: It's machine-dependent → Not relevant here.

C: No → Correct, because case-insensitive.

D: It's operating system-dependent → No, case is not system-dependent.

E: None of the above → No, because C is correct.

F: Only in Python 2 → No, case is a Python feature.

G: Only for certain variable types → No, case doesn't depend on the type.

H: It depends on the coding environment → No, it's more about the language.

I: Only in Python 3 → No, same reasoning as E.

J: It depends on the Python version → No, same as E.

So the correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C: No, because Python variables are case-insensitive in naming.
