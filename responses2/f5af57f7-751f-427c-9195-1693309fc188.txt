Okay, so I have this question about prima facie duty. Hmm, I remember from my law class that prima facie means "to the point." So it's something that seems right, maybe, but I'm not totally sure what it exactly entails. The question is asking which option correctly describes what a prima facie duty is.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each one. Option A says the act seems right, even if it's a bit vague. That sounds similar to prima facie, right? Because it's considered right but not certain. Option B says it tends to be right, but other factors outweigh it. Oh, but I think prima facie is more about the immediate impression, not about other considerations. 

Option C says the act is right. That sounds more like a rule of reason, like a right action. But I think prima facie is more about the apparent rightness, not necessarily the actual rule. 

Option D says it's the first thing an agent should do, higher than other considerations. Wait, I'm not sure about that. I thought prima facie is about the admissibility of an action, not necessarily about being the first thing to do. Like, maybe it's similar to an intention or a right conduct, rather than the agent's obligation.

So, putting it together: prima facie duty is about an action being right, even if it's not certain. So option A says it's right despite being possibly illusory. That fits. Option B talks about being outweighed by others, which might be more about common law principles, like the rule of reason. So A is the correct choice.
