Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says, let M be equal to 4a squared minus 2b squared plus a. Then j is the value of M when a is 5 and b is 3, and k is the value when a is -1 and b is 4. Then I have to calculate j plus 2k. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one based on my calculations.

Hmm, so first, I think I should compute M for a=5 and b=3 to get j. Then do the same for a=-1 and b=4 to get k. Then multiply k by 2 and add j to it. Let's take it step by step.

Starting with a=5 and b=3. Let's plug those values into the equation M=4a² - 2b² + a.

Calculating each term:
- 4a²: 4*(5)^2. 5 squared is 25, times 4 is 100.
- -2b²: -2*(3)^2. 3 squared is 9, times 2 is 18, so negative 18.
- a: 5.

Adding them up: 100 - 18 +5. Let me compute that. 100 minus 18 is 82, plus 5 is 87. So j is 87.

Wait a second, let me double-check that calculation. 5 squared is 25, 4*25 is 100. 3 squared is 9, 2*9 is 18, so 2b² is 18, but it's negative, so that term is -18. Then plus a is 5. So 100 -18 is 82, plus 5 is 87. Yes, that's correct.

Next, calculate k when a is -1 and b is 4. So plugging into M again.

Each term:
- 4a²: 4*(-1)^2. (-1) squared is 1, times 4 is 4.
- -2b²: -2*(4)^2. 4 squared is 16, times 2 is 32, so negative 32.
- a: -1.

Now adding them: 4 -32 + (-1). Let me compute that. 4 minus 32 is -28, plus (-1) is -29. So k is -29.

Wait, let me verify each step. (-1)^2 is indeed 1. 4*1 is 4. 4 squared is 16, times 2 is 32, so -2b² is -32. a is -1. So 4 -32 is -28, plus (-1) is -29. Yes, that seems right.

Now the next step is to compute j + 2k. We have j as 87 and k as -29.

So 2k is 2*(-29) which is -58.

Then j + 2k is 87 + (-58). That's the same as 87 - 58.

Calculating that: 87 minus 50 is 37, minus 8 more is 29. So j + 2k equals 29.

Looking at the options, B is 29. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me recheck each part.

Calculating j:

a=5, b=3:

4*(5)^2 = 4*25=100.

-2*(3)^2 = -2*9= -18.

a=5.

Adding: 100 -18 +5= 87. Correct.

Calculating k:

a=-1, b=4.

4*(-1)^2 =4*1=4.

-2*(4)^2 =-2*16= -32.

a=-1.

Adding: 4 -32 -1= -29. Correct.

So 2k is 2*(-29)= -58.

j +2k: 87 + (-58)= 87-58=29. Which is option B.

I think that's correct. So the answer is B.
</think>

The value of M when a=5, b=3 is 87 (j=87), and when a=-1, b=4 is -29 (k=-29). Calculating j + 2k: 87 + 2*(-29) = 87 -58 =29. So the answer is B.

**Answer: B**
