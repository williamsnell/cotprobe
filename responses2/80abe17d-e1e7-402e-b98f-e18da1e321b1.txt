Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about cycads. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about an unusual feature that makes cycads stand out among seed plants. The options are A to J. I remember that cycads are also called leaf-carrying plants. They're known for being able to reproduce on their leaves, not on soil. So, I'm looking for the option that describes a feature that's unique to them.

Looking at the options:

A: They have flowers that bloom for several years before producing seeds. Wait, aren't cycads self-pollinating? Or do they have a different reproductive method? I think some plants come back to the soil to produce seeds, but I'm not sure if that's the main feature of cycads.

B: Unique leaf structure. Cycads have waxy leaves that help them survive in cold climates. So maybe that's a feature, but isn't that a specific adaptation rather than a general feature that makes them stand out?

C: Survive in extremely cold climates. Cycads are known for their cold-resistance, so this could be a correct feature, but again, is it the main feature that makes them exceptional?

D: Large seeds. Cycads produce large seeds, but I'm not sure if that's their main distinguishing feature.

E: Seeds can remain dormant for centuries. I remember reading that cycads can store seeds for years, which is a unique feature. This option E seems to fit because their seeds can stay dormant for a long time, which is unusual among many plants.

F: Move leaves towards the sun. I don't recall anything about that. Cycads' leaves might be different, but I don't think they move towards the light.

G: Form motile sperm in pollen tubes. Cycads produce large seeds, but I don't think they form sperm. They might have different reproductive cells.

H: Photosynthesize at night. Cycads are photosynthetic, but that's more about their ability to convert light into energy, not a unique feature.

I: True secondary growth. I'm not sure, because I thought cycads are a type of woody plant, so they might not have secondary growth.

J: Only capable of asexual reproduction. No, I remember that many seed plants can reproduce asexually, including cycads. So J is incorrect.

So, the best options are E and maybe another. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about an unusual feature. I think E is a correct answer because I remember that cycads can store seeds for many years, which is a feature that's not common. The other options don't seem to capture the unique aspect. So, the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: They produce large seeds. Cycads are known for their ability to store seeds for centuries, which is a unique feature among seed plants. Other options either describe general characteristics that are not exclusive to cycads or are not unique. 

Answer: E
