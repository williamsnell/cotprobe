Okay, so I've got this question here about compressing gas, and I need to figure out the pressure required. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about compressing 5 liters of gas at 1 atm pressure to 1 liter at a constant temperature. Hmm, pressure and volume relation, right? I remember something about the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But wait, since the temperature is constant, the ideal gas law simplifies a bit. Oh yeah, Charles's Law comes into play here, which says that volume and pressure are inversely proportional when temperature is constant. So, P1 * V1 = P2 * V2.

Let me write that down. Initially, the volume is 5 liters, pressure is 1 atm. We want to find the new pressure when the volume is 1 liter. So plugging into the equation: 1 atm * 5 L = P2 * 1 L.

Wait, so multiplying 1 atm and 5 liters, that gives 5 atmÂ·L. Then, solving for P2: P2 = (1 atm * 5 L) / 1 L = 5 atm. So, the new pressure should be 5 atm.

Looking at the options, option C is 5 atm, which makes sense. Let me double-check. If the volume decreases by a factor of 5, the pressure increases by the same factor, assuming temperature is constant. So 1 atm * 5 =5 atm. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be C.

To determine the pressure required to compress 5 liters of gas at 1 atm to 1 liter at constant temperature, we use the relationship \( P_1V_1 = P_2V_2 \). 

Initial conditions:
- \( V_1 = 5 \, \text{L} \), \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm} \)

Final conditions:
- \( V_2 = 1 \, \text{L} \), \( P_2 = ? \)

Plugging into the equation:
\[
1 \, \text{atm} \times 5 \, \text{L} = P_2 \times 1 \, \text{L}
\]

Solving for \( P_2 \):
\[
P_2 = \frac{1 \, \text{atm} \times 5 \, \text{L}}{1 \, \text{L}} = 5 \, \text{atm}
\]

The correct pressure is 5 atm, which corresponds to option C.
