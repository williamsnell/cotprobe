Question:

Assume that some function, K = F (i) is the cost of the production and marketing of a product, and the total cost (K) is solelydependantupon the number of items produced, whereistands for the number of items produced. Then, the average rate of change in cost = {change in total cost / change in number of items) ; (\DeltaK/\Deltai) = [{F(i_2) - F(i_1)} / {i_2 - i_1}]. Suppose the production and marketing cost of a pair of compasses is K = F (i) = 3\surdi . When O \leqi\leq 250. What then, is the average rate of change in cost, (a) fromi= 25 toi= 100 ? (b) fromi= 25 toi= 225 ?

A: $.15 per unit from 25 to 100 items, $.20 per unit from 25 to 225 items
B: $.10 per unit from 25 to 100 items, $.30 per unit from 25 to 225 items

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about average rate of change in cost for producing a pair of compasses. The function given is K = F(i) = 3√i, where K is the cost and i is the number of items produced. The question is asking for the average rate of change in cost from i=25 to i=100 and then from i=25 to i=225. 

Hmm, average rate of change is basically the change in K divided by the change in i, right? So for part (a), from 25 to 100, I need to compute [F(100) - F(25)] / (100 - 25). Let's compute F(100) first. 

F(100) is 3 times the square root of 100. The square root of 100 is 10, so 3*10 is 30. Then F(25) is 3 times the square root of 25. The square root of 25 is 5, so 3*5 is 15. So the change in K is 30 - 15, which is 15. Then the change in i is 100 - 25 = 75. So the average rate is 15 / 75. Let me calculate that: 15 divided by 75 is 0.2. Wait, 15 divided by 75 is 0.2, or 20 cents per unit? Because 0.2 dollars is 20 cents. So that's 20 per unit. 

Wait, but the options are in dollars, so 0.20 is $0.20. So for part (a), the average rate is $0.20 per unit.

Now part (b) is from i=25 to i=225. So F(225) is 3 times sqrt(225). The square root of 225 is 15, so 3*15 is 45. F(25) is still 15. So the change in K is 45 - 15 = 30. The change in i is 225 - 25 = 200. So the average rate is 30 / 200. Let me compute that. 30 divided by 200 is 0.15. So that's $0.15 per unit.

Looking at the options, option I says from 25 to 100 it's 20 per unit, and from 25 to 225 it's 15 per unit. So that's option I: I: $.20 per unit from 25 to 100 items, $.15 per unit from 25 to 225 items.

The average rate of change in cost is calculated by dividing the change in total cost by the change in the number of items. For the function K = 3√i:

(a) From i=25 to i=100:
- F(100) = 3 * 10 = 30
- F(25) = 3 * 5 = 15
- Change in K = 30 - 15 = 15
- Change in i = 100 - 25 = 75
- Average rate = 15 / 75 = 0.20 or $0.20 per unit.

(b) From i=25 to i=225:
- F(225) = 3 * 15 = 45
- Change in K = 45 - 15 = 30
- Change in i = 225 - 25 = 200
- Average rate = 30 / 200 = 0.15 or $0.15 per unit.

Comparing these results to the options, the correct answer is:

I: $.20 per unit from 25 to 100 items, $.15 per unit from 25 to 225 items.
