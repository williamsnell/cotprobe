Question:

Following their law school graduation party, a graduate and his roommate were driving home in an automobile that was owned and operated by the graduate. As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving "at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. "The complaint is

Options:

A: admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.
B: inadmissible, because it is considered hearsay.
C: admissible as a declaration against interest.
D: admissible, because the graduate consented to its use.
E: inadmissible, because the roommate is not a party to the lawsuit.
F: inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.
G: admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.
H: admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
I: admissible as an admission.

Okay, so I have this question here about hearsay exceptions and whether a statement offered in evidence is admissible. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The scenario is about a graduate and his roommate who got into an accident involving a graduate's car and a motorcycle. The graduate was driving while the motorcycle rider was injured. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motorcycle over the speed limit, and the roommate sued him for operating his motorcycle negligently while driving through a red light. The roommate settled out of court and then tried to go to trial against the rider. However, the roommate testified that he saw the rider drive through a red light and then swerved into the graduate's car. The rider countered by offering the roommate's complaint, which alleged that the graduate was driving at a high speed. 

The question is whether this statement offered is admissible. The options are A to I. 

So, first, I need to recall the hearsay rule exceptions. Hearsay is any statement made to convince the court of fact, except for specific exceptions. The common hearsay exception includes things like truth and exception, comparative effect, and necessity. 

Looking at the options:

A: Admissible under former testimony exception. That would be the truth and exception rule. The graduate might have admitted his speed, but the roommate offered evidence that says the graduate was driving fast. Wait, but this is using the "excess speed" to claim the graduate was speeding. But wait, in this case, the graduate is the party, so the gambling exception or the truth exception? The gamble exception is about the statement being made with the intent to make a bet, but the graduate might not have intended to bet. The truth exception applies when the statement is true. But the statement is about the graduate's speed, which is true, but the statement is offered in response to the roommate's testimony. So has the graduate offered the evidence that he was driving too fast? If the graduate admitted it, the roommate could use that as truth and exception. But the question is, did the graduate make that statement? The scenario says the graduate was driving and the graduate's car collided. The graduate is the party, but I don't know if he said anything about the speed. The statement was offered by the rider as a rebuttal to the roommate's testimony. So the graduate might not have made a statement in front of the court, but the roommate offered evidence that the graduate was driving too fast. If that's the case, and the statement was made in evidence (as a statement offered by the roommate), then it's a hearsay.

B: Inadmissible because it's hearsay. That would be the case if the statement is hearsay. But the statement is about the graduate's speed, which is probably true. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

C: Admissible as a declaration against interest. A declaration against interest is used when the statement is about an action taken or omitted to avoid a particular result, and the statement is made by the declarant in good faith to avoid liability. I'm not sure if this applies here. The statement was offered to rebut the roommate's testimony about the graduate's speed. If the rider claims the graduate was driving too fast, perhaps because of the accident, then this might be a statement against interest. But I'm not certain. Maybe it's more about comparative effect or the necessity rule.

D: Admissible because the graduate consented to its use. The business records exception allows a court to admit a statement made by a party if it was made under the consent of the party or of a third party. The graduate could have consented to the statement. But I don't have enough information to say whether the graduate consented. The scenario doesn't specify that. So I can't confirm this.

E: Inadmissible because the roommate is not a party. The roommate offered evidence, so the statement is in evidence. Hence, the roommate isn't a party here. So E is not correct.

F: Inadmissible because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise. If the settlement was part of a compromise, then it's not a valid settlement. But the question states that the roommate reached an out-of-court settlement and dismissed the lawsuit against him, implying that the settlement was valid and the statement is part of the evidence. So F is probably incorrect.

G: Admissible under the business records exception. If the statement was made under the consent of the graduate, then G would apply. But the scenario doesn't provide any indication of the graduate's consent. So G is not the right answer.

H: Admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. This is used when the statement was made in the past and is inconsistent with evidence. The statement is about the graduate's speed. If the statement is made before the accident and contradicts the accident, it could be prior inconsistent. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, let me think again. The statement is offered against the graduate's claim of excessive speed. If the graduate admitted the speed, then the statement would be hearsay, but it's presented as a statement against interest. Or perhaps it's a declaration against interest if the graduate is not the declarant.

Wait, the statement is offered by the rider as a rebuttal to the roommate's testimony. So the statement is made by the rider against the graduate. If the statement is against interest, that would be when the declarant is not the party, but here the graduate is the party. Alternatively, if the statement is a statement against interest, maybe the graduate is the declarant.

Wait, no. The statement is by the rider, not the graduate. So it's a statement by a third party. So business records exception wouldn't apply. Therefore, options G and H are unlikely.

Looking back, the exception that comes to mind is the "excess speed" in the case of comparative effect. But wait, in this scenario, the exception might be the "admissibility of comparative effect," which is used when a party has the opportunity to inform the court about the statement. But the scenario doesn't state that. So perhaps the statement is hearsay.

Wait, the first hearsay exception is the "admission of a statement." So if the graduate admitted that he was moving too fast, the statement would be admissible under the "admission of a statement." But in the scenario, the statement was offered by the roommate against the graduate. So the graduate might not have made the statement, but the roommate offered a statement to the court. Therefore, the statement is being offered by a third party, so it's not "admission of a statement" unless the graduate made it. So if the graduate didn't make the statement, it's not admissible by the "admission of a statement" exception.

Another exception is the "truth and exception" rule. If the statement is true and the statement is offered in evidence, it might be admissible. The statement is about the graduate's speed, which was a fact that could be true. But the statement is offered in response to the roommate's testimony, so the statement is hearsay because it's being offered for the first time. So unless the statement is true and meets the exception, it's not admissible.

Wait, but the statement is about the graduate's speed. Suppose the graduate did not make the statement, but the roommate offered it. So the statement is hearsay. Unless the statement was made by the graduate, which the scenario doesn't say. So, if the graduate didn't make the statement, and the statement is hearsay, then the exception would require the graduate to have made it.

But the question is whether the statement is hearsay. So if it's hearsay, then it's inadmissible unless one of the exceptions applies. So, in the context, since the statement is offered in the court's evidence, it's hearsay. So unless one of the exceptions applies, it's inadmissible.

Looking at the options, the only one that seems to apply is the "admission of a statement" if the graduate had made the statement, which it doesn't seem to. The "excess speed" might be a hearsay issue, but perhaps it's about comparative effect. Alternatively, the "admissibility of comparative effect" could apply if the graduate can show that the comparative effect applies. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The statement is a statement about the graduate's speed, which is a fact that the graduate may have made. So if the graduate admitted that he was speeding, then that's a statement that can be admitted as true. But in this case, the statement was offered by the roommate against the graduate. So the graduate didn't make the statement. Therefore, unless the graduate's statement was admitted, the statement is hearsay.

So the only exception I can think of is the "admission of a statement," which would require the graduate to have made the statement. Since he didn't, it's not admissible under that. Therefore, the statement is hearsay and inadmissible unless another exception applies.

Looking back, the question is about whether the statement is admissible. So unless one of the exceptions applies, it's inadmissible. So the options are:

A: Admissible under former testimony exception. But the former testimony exception requires the statement to be true. If the graduate admitted the speed, that's not about hearsay. Unless the statement is true, but it's hearsay because it's offered for the first time. So A is not applicable.

B: Inadmissible because it's hearsay. That's a possibility.

C: Admissible as declaration against interest. As a declaration against interest, the statement would be made by the declarant, and it's against a particular interest. The statement here is about the graduate's speed, which is a fact, but I'm not sure if it's against interest. The statement is made to show that the graduate was speeding, which may be a defense. But I'm not certain if that's the case.

D: Admissible, because the graduate consented. If the graduate said he was speeding, then the statement was admitted. But the scenario doesn't say that the graduate made the statement. So D is not applicable.

E: Inadmissible because roommate isn't a party. But the roommate is offering evidence, so he's not a party. So E is incorrect.

F: Inadmissible because the suit dismissed as part of a compromise. The scenario says the roommate dismissed the lawsuit, so F is incorrect.

G: Admissible under business records exception. The business records exception applies if the statement was made by a third party and the court had the consent of the other parties. Since the statement is against interest, and the graduate is the party, I think the business records exception might not apply.

H: Admissible as prior inconsistent statement. This is used when the statement is made before evidence and is inconsistent with it. Here, the statement is offered in evidence. So H is incorrect.

So the only option left is B: inadmissible because it's hearsay. Because the statement is hearsay since it's offered for the first time, and unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible.
</think>

The statement offered by the roommate is hearsay because it is being offered for the first time in court. Hearsay requires the statement to be true and offered for the first time, and the statement in question is about the graduate's speed, which could be true. The statement is admissible only if one of the applicable hearsay exceptions applies. However, the statement is not admitted under the "admission of a statement" exception, as the graduate did not make it. Therefore, it is inadmissible under the hearsay rule.

ANSWER: B
