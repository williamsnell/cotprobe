The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A builder wanted to have security systems installed in a series of homes he was building. He contacted several companies and asked them to submit bids for the installation work. An alarm company decided to submit a bid and, in turn, requested bids from several wholesalers for the burglar alarms it planned to use if it was awarded the job. A supplier submitted a bid to the alarm company that the latter used in computing the bid that it was preparing for the builder. On September 1, the alarm company sent the builder its bid, in which it proposed to install the security systems for $100,000. On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms to them. On September 11, the builder sent the following fax to the alarm company: "I hereby accept your offer to install the security systems for $100,000. "The alarm company had to pay another wholesaler $10,000 above the price quoted by the supplier for the burglar alarms. As a result, the alarm company advised the builder that the total price for the job would have to be increased to $10,000. The builder replied that he would hold the alarm company to the initially agreed price of $100,000. The alarm company installed the security systems, but the builder has not yet paid them anything. In an action by the alarm company against the builder for services rendered, the alarm company will probably be able to recover

Options:

A: The cost of the alarms from the second supplier, because they were an unforeseen expense.
B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated changeof circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.
C: only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.
D: only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.
E: $100,000, because that was the original agreed price, regardless of changes in circumstances.
F: $90,000, because the alarm company had to pay an additional cost.
G: $100,000, because that was the contract price.
H: Nothing, because the builder did not agree to the new price.
I: $100,000, plus damages for the builder's delay in payment.
J: $110,000, because the supplier's inability to supply burglar alarms was unforeseen.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with implied contracts, price changes, and recoveries. I need to figure out the right answer from options A to J. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the scenario carefully. A builder wants security systems installed. He calls several companies. An alarm company asks for bids, and the alarm company sends a bid of $100,000. The supplier of the alarm company says they won't be able to supply the alarms, so the alarm company resubmits a new bid, this time from a second supplier, but this time the price is $10,000 less. Wait, no, the supplier notified the builder that they can't supply, so the builder is forced to pay another $10,000. So the supplier is $10,000 cheaper than the initial $100,000? Or wait, the supplier is the one who was called back, so the supplier's price is $10,000 less than the original quote? Hmm, wait, the initial quote was $100,000, and the second quote is $10,000 less, so $90,000? Or wait, the initial quote is from the alarm company, which is $100,000. The supplier (the one who submitted the second bid) is $10,000 cheaper, because they couldn't supply, so the second supplier is now $10,000 cheaper. So $90,000.

Then the builder is forced to pay the supplier $10,000 more than the original quote. So, in total, the builder is paying $100,000 plus $10,000, which is $110,000. Wait, but wait, the supplier's price was $100,000, and the builder paid $10,000 more, making it $110,000. So the builder is paying more than what was initially quoted.

Now, the builder's action is against the alarm company. The question is, what can the alarm company recover? So, the alarm company had to pay another $10,000 because the supplier couldn't supply. But when the supplier couldn't supply, the builder was forced to pay an extra $10,000. So the total payment was $110,000, which is $10,000 more than what was quoted.

So, the issue is about whether the builder can recover from the alarm company. When a company is in a contract and changes the price unexpectedly, the contract law often determines the remedy based on whether the contract was quantitatively certain at the time it was made. So, the initial contract was for $100,000, which was fixed. But now, the price went up because the supplier couldn't supply, which was a change in circumstances.

In contract law, if the parties have a contract that's quantitatively certain at the time the contract was made, any subsequent changes that affect the price are a breach of contract. But here, the change was unforeseen because the supplier couldn't supply. So, at the time the contract was made, the price was fixed. Now, the price went up because the supplier couldn't supply. So the contract becomes subject to change, and that's an unforeseen change.

So, the rule here is that when a contract is quantitatively certain at the contract's date and subsequent changes are unforeseen, the contract becomes unenforceable and the remedy is based on quantum meruit. Quantum meruit says that the contract price is the price at which the goods could have been sold, and any price that is higher is invalid.

Wait, but the initial contract was for $100,000, but now the price increased to $110,000. So, the original contract was for $100,000. But the supplier couldn't supply, so the builder had to pay $110,000. So, the contract's price went up because of that unforeseen change.

So, the rule is that the contract price is the price at which the goods could have been sold, so the contract is for $100,000. But now, because of the change, the price is $110,000. So the contract is unenforceable, and the remedy is based on quantum meruit. So the remedy is to recover the price at which the goods could have been sold, which was $100,000, plus any additional damages.

Wait, but wait. The price went up by $10,000, so the total is $110,000. So, the contract's price was $100,000, but the actual price is $110,000 because of the change. So, the contract was unenforceable, and the remedy is $100,000 plus any damages, which would be $110,000. Wait, but quantum meruit says that the price is the price at which the goods could have been sold, which was $100,000. So, the remedy is $100,000 plus any additional damages.

But wait, another possibility. Alternatively, the contract is for $100,000. If the price goes up, it's a breach because the contract price is fixed. The remedy would be the higher price. So in this case, the builder is paying $110,000, which is higher than the original contract price. So the remedy would be $110,000. But wait, that doesn't seem right because quantum meruit states that the remedy is the price at which the goods could have been sold, which was $100,000.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The original contract was for $100,000. But because the supplier couldn't supply, the price went up to $110,000. So the contract was for $100,000, but the actual price is higher. So the contract is unenforceable. So, the remedy is based on the contract's price, which was $100,000, plus any additional costs. But wait, the contract's price was $100,000, but the actual price is $110,000. So, the price went up by $10,000. So, the builder is paying $110,000. So, the remedy would be $100,000 plus any additional damages.

Wait, but quantum meruit says that the remedy is the price at which the goods were to be sold. So, the original price was $100,000, but the actual price is $110,000. So, the remedy is $100,000 plus any additional damages. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option F says $90,000 (but wait, that doesn't make sense, because the original quote was $100,000, and the second was $90,000). Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the correct answer elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: the contract was for $100,000, which was fixed. However, because the supplier couldn't supply, the price went up to $110,000. So, under contract law, because the contract was unenforceable due to an unforeseen change, the remedy is based on the contract's price. The contract's price was $100,000, but the actual price is $110,000. So, the remedy is $110,000.

But wait, another point: when the contract is for a fixed price, and the price changes due to unforeseen circumstances, the remedy is the contract price, because any increase is a breach. So, the remedy is $100,000. But wait, but the builder is paying $110,000, so perhaps quantum meruit says that the price is the price at which the goods could have been sold, which is the original $100,000. So, the remedy is $100,000.

Wait, but the options don't have $100,000 as the correct answer. Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option F: $90,000. Because the alarm company had to pay an additional cost.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the facts again. The supplier was unable to supply, so the builder had to pay an additional $10,000. So the total was $110,000. The contract was for $100,000. So, the contract price was $100,000, but the actual price is $110,000 due to the change.

Under contract law, when a contract was made for a fixed price, and subsequent changes occur, the remedy depends on whether the contract is quantitatively certain at the time it was made. If it's not, the contract becomes unenforceable, and the remedy is based on the contract's price. So here, the price was fixed, but it's now higher. So the contract is unenforceable, and the remedy is $100,000, but the actual payment is $110,000. Hmm, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the contract is for $100,000, which is fixed. The price increased because of the change, which is a change in circumstances. So, the remedy is $100,000 plus any additional damages. But looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are A: the second supplier's cost, B: $110k, etc.

Wait, another approach: the supplier couldn't supply, so the builder had to pay $10,000 more. But the contract was for $100,000. So, the total was $110,000. So, the builder paid more than the contract price. So, the remedy would be the contract price plus any additional costs.

But in some jurisdictions, when the price increases due to unforeseen circumstances, the contract is unenforceable, and the remedy is the contract price plus any damages. So, the remedies would be $100,000 plus any additional damages.

But looking at the options, option F is $90,000. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The supplier's price was $100,000, and the second quote was $90,000 because the supplier couldn't supply. So, the second supplier is $10,000 cheaper. So, the total was $110,000.

Wait, but in the scenario, the supplier's price was $100,000. The builder paid $10,000 more because the supplier couldn't supply. So the builder paid $110,000. So, the price went up to $110,000 because of the change in circumstances. So, the contract was unenforceable.

So, the remedies are the contract price plus any additional damages. But the contract was for $100,000, so the builder should get $100,000 plus any additional costs.

Wait, but the options don't include $100,000 as a possible outcome. Let me look at the options again.

Option F says $90,000, but that's from the second supplier's quote. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the builder is entitled to the original price plus the extra $10,000, which is $110,000. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the contract was for $100,000, but because the price went up, the remedy is $110,000. So, the builder should get that. But none of the options say that.

Looking at the options again:

A: The cost of the alarms from the second supplier because they were an unforeseen expense. Wait, but the second supplier's cost was $90,000, not $100,000. So this is not correct.

B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated change. So, that could be a possibility. Because the price went up due to an unforeseen change, the remedy is $110,000.

But I also think that quantum meruit applies because the contract was for a fixed price, and the price went up due to an unforeseen change.

Wait, let's think about the distinction between quantum meruit and commercial frustration. Quantum meruit applies when the contract was fixed, and the change is unforeseen. Commercial frustration applies when the contract is variable, and the change is unforeseen.

In this case, the contract was for a fixed price of $100,000. Suppose the change is an unforeseen change, then quantum meruit applies.

So, the remedy would be the contract price ($100,000) plus any additional damages. But wait, so the builder paid $110,000, which is $10,000 over the contract price. So, under quantum meruit, the remedy is the contract price, which is $100,000. Or would it be the actual price, $110,000?

Wait, quantum meruit says that the remedy is the price at which the goods could have been sold, which was the contract's price, $100,000. But in this case, the builder paid more than that, so the actual payment is $110,000. So, the remedy is $110,000. But this is the total payment, not just the extra.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the builder can recover $100,000 plus any damages, but I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the builder can recover $100,000 because that was the contract price, regardless of the change. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's consider each option.

Option A: The cost of the alarms from the second supplier because they were an unforeseen expense. The second supplier is $90,000, which isn't the original quote. So this doesn't fit. So, probably not A.

Option B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated change. Hmm, that could be correct because the price went up, which is an unanticipated change. So, under quantum meruit, the remedy is $110,000.

Option C: only in quantum meruit. Because the contract was unenforceable. But quantum meruit's remedies are the contract price plus damages, not the actual price. So, if the contract's price was $100,000, the remedy would be $100,000, but the builder paid more, so the actual payment is $110,000, which would be the correct remedy.

Wait, but quantum meruit's rule is that the contract price is the amount the goods could have been sold for. So, the price was $100,000, so the remedy is $100,000. But the builder paid $110,000, which is more than that. So, the correct remedy would be $110,000.

Wait, but this brings me back to the options. Option B says $110,000 because of the change. Option F says $90,000 because the supplier couldn't supply.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: $90,000, the second supplier's cost. But that's not correct because the second supplier's quote was $90,000, not the original.

Wait, another angle: The contract price was $100,000, but because the supplier couldn't supply, the price increased to $110,000. So, the builder paid $110,000, which is the actual price. So, the remedy is $110,000.

But in that case, that's option B. But wait, why is that so? Because the price went up, and the change was unforeseen, so quantum meruit applies, and the remedy is the contract price, which was $100,000. But in reality, the builder paid $110,000, which is the actual price.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding quantum meruit. Let me think again. Quantum meruit says that a party can recover the price at which the goods could have been sold, regardless of subsequent price increases. So, the price at the time the contract was made was the correct remedy. So, the contract was for $100,000, so the remedy is $100,000. But since the builder paid $110,000, perhaps they are entitled to the $100,000 plus any additional damages.

Wait, but I'm getting myself into a knot. Let me try to go through the options again.

The question is about the remedy when a contract's price changes due to unforeseen circumstances.

Option B says $110,000 because of the change.

Option F: $90,000 because the supplier couldn't supply.

But the correct answer is likely B: because the price went up, which is an unanticipated change, so the remedy is $110,000.

Wait, another thought: the contract is for $100,000, but because the price went up, the contract is unenforceable, and the remedy is the contract price, which was $100,000. But the builder actually paid $110,000, so the actual payment is the remedy. So, the correct answer would be B: $110,000 because of the change.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure because I've heard that quantum meruit applies when the price change is unforeseen, and the remedy is the contract price. So, if the contract was for $100,000, the remedy is $100,000. But the builder paid $110,000, which is more than the contract price. So, perhaps the correct remedy is $110,000.

So, the correct answer is option B. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've read that the remedy is the contract price, which was $100,000, but the actual payment is higher, so the remedy is $100,000 plus any damages. But the options don't have an option that says $100,000 plus damages.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: $90,000 because the second supplier couldn't supply.

But that doesn't make sense because the second supplier's quote was $90,000, which was $10,000 less than the original. So, that's an unfavorable change, but the second quote is $90,000, which is $10,000 less than $100,000.

But the issue is whether the change is an unforeseen change. The supplier couldn't supply, so the price went up. So, the change is an unforeseen change because the supplier couldn't supply. So, under quantum meruit, the remedy is the contract's price, which was $100,000. But the actual payment is $110,000, which is higher than the contract price.

So, the correct remedy is the contract price, which was $100,000, but the actual payment is $110,000. So, the builder is entitled to $110,000, which is option B.

Alternatively, wait, no. Because in the case of quantum meruit, the remedy is the contract's price, which was $100,000, regardless of the subsequent price increase. So, the builder is entitled to $100,000.

But the actual payment is $110,000, which is higher than the contract price. So, that's an increase. So, the correct remedy would be the contract price plus any additional costs. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: $110,000 because of the change. Because the change is an unforeseen change, so the remedy is the price at which the goods could have been sold, which was $100,000. But the actual payment is $110,000, which is higher. So, perhaps the correct remedy is $110,000.

I think the correct answer is B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated change.

Wait, but wait. Another point: If the contract is for a fixed price and then the price increases due to an unforeseen change, the contract becomes unenforceable, and the remedy is the contract's price. So, the contract's price was $100,000. Therefore, the remedy is $100,000. But the actual payment is $110,000. So, the correct remedy would be $100,000 plus any additional damages. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: $90,000 because the supplier couldn't supply.

But no, that's not correct because the second supplier's quote was $90,000, which is $10,000 less than the original, but that doesn't affect the remedy.

So, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize.

The contract was for $100,000. The supplier couldn't supply, so the price went up to $110,000. Under quantum meruit, the remedy is the contract's price, which was $100,000. But the actual payment is $110,000, which is higher. So, the correct remedy is $100,000 plus any damages, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the builder is entitled to $100,000 plus any additional costs, but since that's not an option, the correct answer must be B: $110,000 because of the change.

Wait, but that can't be right because the contract's price was $100,000, so the remedy should be $100,000, not $110,000.

Hmm, I'm not sure. But I think the correct answer is B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated change.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: $90,000 because the supplier couldn't supply.

But no, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options provided.

The correct answer is likely B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated change.

Because the price went up due to an unanticipated change, which is a reason for the remedy being the increased price.

Wait, but quantum meruit says the remedy is the price at which the goods were to be sold, which was the original $100,000. So, the correct remedy is $100,000. But the actual payment is $110,000, which is more. So, perhaps the correct answer is B because the change is an unanticipated change, and the remedy is the increased price.

Wait, no, quantum meruit says the remedy is the price at which the goods were to be sold, which was the original $100,000. So, the correct remedy is $100,000.

But the actual payment is $110,000, which is more. So, the correct answer is B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: Let's think about the case in the question.

The alarm company's price was $100,000. When the price went up to $110,000, the contract is unenforceable, and the remedy is the contract price plus any additional costs.

So, the correct remedy is $100,000 plus damages, but the options don't have that.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B: $110,000 because of the change.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the builder is entitled to $100,000 because that was the original price, despite the change. But that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated change.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated change**. 

**Explanation:**
- The builder was initially quoted a price of $100,000 for the security system.
- When the supplier couldn't supply the alarm company, the price increased to $110,000 due to an unanticipated change.
- Under quantum meruit, the remedy is based on the price at which the goods could have been sold, which was the original fixed price of $100,000.
- Therefore, the builder can recover the original price of $100,000 plus any additional costs, even though the actual payment was $110,000.

ANSWER: B
