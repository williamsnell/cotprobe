Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question says that Field and Co. bought 100 dolls at $3.25 each. So, the total cost for all the dolls is 100 multiplied by 3.25. Let me calculate that: 100 * 3.25 equals $325. Right?

Then, they sold 25 of these dolls for $6 each. So, the revenue from those 25 dolls is 25 * 6. That's 150 dollars. So, the revenue from the first batch is $150.

Now, the question is about the minimum retail price for the remaining dolls so that the average retail markup is 35%. I'm a bit confused about what exactly the average markup refers to here. I think markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So, maybe the markup percentage is 35%, which would be the markup relative to the cost.

Wait, let me clarify. The markup is 35%, which I believe is the markup on the cost. So, if the markup is 35%, then selling price is cost plus 35% of cost. Alternatively, it's sometimes expressed as (Selling Price / Cost) - 1 = 35%. Let me think about this.

So, for the markup percentage, the formula would be:

Markup Percentage = (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost * 100%

Which would mean Selling Price = Cost * (1 + Markup Percentage)

But wait, the term "average retail markup" could be interpreted in different ways. Another way to look at it is the markup on the cost. So, if the markup is 35%, then each doll's selling price should be 35% higher than its cost.

But wait, the problem states that the average markup is 35%, but the question is about the minimum retail price for the remaining dolls. So, perhaps the markup is based on the cost, and the remaining dolls are sold at a price that gives an average markup of 35% across all 100 dolls.

Alternatively, perhaps the markup is based on the selling price. That might be a different approach. But I think markup is usually on the cost. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, first, let's calculate the cost per doll. Each doll was bought at $3.25. The markup is 35%, so the selling price for each doll should be 3.25 * (1 + 0.35). Let me compute that:

3.25 * 1.35 = ?

Hmm, 3.25 * 1 = 3.25, 3.25 * 0.35 = 1.1375. Adding them together: 3.25 + 1.1375 = 4.3875. So, approximately $4.39 per doll. But wait, I think that's the selling price with 35% markup. But the question is about the minimum retail price for the remaining dolls to achieve an average markup of 35% across all units.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let's think again. The average markup is 35%, but the markup could be on the cost or on the selling price. If the markup is on the cost, then the selling price is cost plus 35% of cost. Alternatively, if the markup is on the selling price, then cost is selling price minus 35% of selling price, which would be selling price * (1 - 0.35) = cost.

Wait, perhaps the markup is calculated as (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price = 35%. So, that would be the markup on the selling price, which is different from markup on the cost.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of the definition. Markup is usually a percentage added to the cost. So, markup on cost is Selling Price = Cost * (1 + Markup%). Markup on selling price is Selling Price * (1 - Markup%) = Cost.

But I'm not entirely sure, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the markup is based on the cost, as that's the standard way to calculate markup.

So, if the markup is 35% on cost, then each doll's selling price should be 3.25 * 1.35, which is approximately $4.3875, so $4.39. But wait, that's for each doll.

But the question is about the minimum retail price for the remaining dolls. So, perhaps the markup is 35% on the cost, and the remaining dolls are sold at that price. But I need to check whether this would make the average markup 35% across all 100 dolls.

Wait, but the first 25 dolls were sold at $6 each. Let me check what markup that gives for those. The cost for each doll is $3.25, so markup is $6 - $3.25 = $2.75. So, markup percentage is 2.75 / 3.25 = approximately 83.85%. That's a high markup.

But the problem states that they want the average markup to be 35%. So, if the markup is 35%, then the selling price of the remaining dolls should be at 3.25 * 1.35 = about $4.39. But wait, that would lower the selling price. But why would they charge lower than the current selling price?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the markup. Maybe the markup is based on cost, and the markup percentage is 35% for all. So, all 100 dolls would be sold at 3.25 * 1.35, but the first 25 were sold for $6 each, which might not align with that.

Wait, perhaps the markup is calculated on cost, and the average markup across all units is 35%. So, the markup for each unit is 35%, so all units are sold at 3.25 * 1.35 = $4.3875. But the first 25 were sold at $6. So, that would mean that the average markup is now higher than 35%, which doesn't fit the problem statement.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me read the question again: "the average retail markup is 35%." So, perhaps the markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost, and when averaged across all units, the markup is 35%. So, the markup for all 100 dolls is 35% of their cost, but their costs are the same, $3.25 each.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because markup is the same per unit. So, each doll's markup is 35% of cost.

Wait, but the markup for the first 25 dolls was actually higher than that. So, perhaps the issue is that the first 25 were sold at a higher markup, so the rest need to be sold at a lower markup to bring the average down to 35%.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum retail price for the remaining dolls to have an average markup of 35% across all 100.

So, perhaps the idea is that each doll's markup (S - C)/C is 35%, so S = C * (1 + 0.35) = 3.25 * 1.35 = $4.3875. So, each doll should sell for about $4.39.

But wait, the first 25 were sold for $6 each, which is higher than $4.39. That seems to suggest that the markup would be higher than 35% if they sold them at $6. Wait, but that's not correct because the markup is (S - C)/C. So, if they sold each doll at $6, then markup is (6 - 3.25)/3.25 = 2.75 / 3.25 = 0.846, which is 84.6%. So, that's way higher than 35%.

But the question is about the remaining dolls. So, the remaining dolls are 75 in total (since 100 -25=75). The markup for these would have to be such that the average markup across all 100 is 35%. So, the average markup is calculated across all units.

Let me think in terms of total markup. Let's denote the selling price of the remaining dolls as P. So, the first 25 sold at $6. The remaining 75 at P.

Each doll's markup is (S - C). So, for the first 25: 6 - 3.25 = 2.75. For the remaining 75: P - 3.25.

The total markup across all 100 dolls would be 25 * 2.75 + 75*(P - 3.25).

The average markup would be (25*2.75 + 75*(P -3.25)) / 100 = 35% of the cost per doll. Wait, but the cost per doll is 3.25. So, 35% markup is 0.35 * 3.25 = 1.1375. So, each doll's markup is 1.1375. So, for the remaining dolls, each should have a markup of 1.1375, meaning P = 3.25 + 1.1375 = 4.3875, which is about $4.39.

But wait, the first 25 were sold at a markup of 84.6%, which is way higher than 35%. So, if the remaining 75 are sold at 35% markup, their selling price is $4.39 each.

But wait, the question is about the minimum retail price for the remaining. So, perhaps they can be sold at a lower price, but that would lower the average markup. But the problem says that the average markup is 35%, so that might mean that the markup is 35% of cost.

So, let me approach it differently. The total markup for all 100 dolls should be 35% of (100 * 3.25) dollars.

Wait, no. The markup is usually a percentage of the cost. So, for all 100 dolls, the total markup would be 100 * (3.25 * 0.35) = 100 * 1.1375 = $113.75.

The total markup across all 100 dolls is the sum of the markup on each doll. So, for the first 25, the markup is 25 * (6 - 3.25) = 25 * 2.75 = 68.75.

So, the remaining 75 dolls must provide a markup of 113.75 - 68.75 = 45.

So, their total markup should be 45 dollars. Since they are 75 units, the average markup per doll is 45 / 75 = $0.60.

So, the markup per doll is 0.60, which is 18% of the cost. So, the selling price would be 3.25 + 0.60 = $3.85.

Wait, but that's lower than the initial 3.25. But that can't be right because the first 25 were sold at a higher price, implying a higher markup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

The total markup across all dolls is 100 * 3.25 * 0.35 = 350 * 0.35 = $113.75.

The first 25 dolls sold at $6 each have a markup of 6 - 3.25 = 2.75, so 25 * 2.75 = 68.75.

The remaining 75 dolls must have a total markup of 113.75 - 68.75 = 45.

So, 45 is the total markup for 75 dolls. So, each doll's markup is 45 /75 = 0.60.

So, the selling price is cost + markup: 3.25 + 0.60 = $3.85.

But wait, if I charge $3.85 for the remaining 75 dolls, that's lower than their cost. That doesn't make sense for a selling price. Unless the dolls are sold at a discount, but in the context of retail, this might not be practical. But perhaps the problem allows it.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the markup is based on the selling price. Let me try that approach.

If the markup is based on selling price, then markup percentage is 35% on the selling price. So, markup = 0.35 * S.

So, S - C = 0.35 * S → S - 0.35 S = C → 0.65 S = C → S = C / 0.65 → 3.25 / 0.65 = 5. So, the selling price would be $5.00.

Wait, but then the first 25 dolls were sold for $6, which implies a markup of 2.75, which is 2.75 / 3.25 = 84.6%, which is way higher than 35% on the cost.

But if the markup is based on selling price, the markup for the remaining dolls would have to be 35% of their selling price. So, the markup for the remaining dolls is 0.35 * S, and the markup is S - 3.25.

So, for the remaining dolls, 0.35 S = S - 3.25 → 3.25 = 0.65 S → S = 3.25 / 0.65 = 5.00. So, the selling price would have to be $5.00.

But the first 25 dolls were sold for $6, which is 6 - 3.25 = 2.75 markup. So, if the markup is 35% on the selling price, then 2.75 would have to be equal to 0.35 * 6. Let's check: 0.35 * 6 = 2.10, which is less than 2.75. So, this doesn't match.

So, perhaps the markup is based on cost. In that case, each doll's markup is 35% of its cost. So, for the remaining dolls, S = 3.25 * 1.35 = $4.39. But wait, the first 25 were sold for $6, which is higher than $4.39.

Wait, but that can't be because the average markup is supposed to be 35% across all. Let me recalculate.

If all dolls are sold at 35% markup, then each doll's selling price is 3.25 * 1.35 = 4.3875, so about $4.39.

The first 25 were sold for $6, which is higher than this. So, to get the average markup down to 35%, the remaining dolls would need to be sold at a lower markup than 35%.

Wait, but how can that be? If the markup is 35% of cost, then all dolls should be sold at the same price. So, if the first 25 are sold at a higher price, that would change the average.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the markup is 35% on cost, but the average is calculated across all 100, which is not 35% but the average of the individual markup percentages.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Total markup across all dolls is 100 * 0.35 * 3.25 = 350 * 0.35 = 113.75.

First 25 dolls have a markup of 25*(6-3.25) = 25*2.75=68.75.

So, remaining 75 dolls must contribute 113.75 -68.75=45. So, total markup for 75 dolls is 45. So, each doll's markup is 45/75=0.60. So, selling price is 3.25+0.60=3.85.

So, the remaining dolls would be sold at $3.85 each.

But let's check if that makes sense. If they are sold at $3.85, the markup is 0.60, which is 16.67% of the cost (0.60 /3.25 = 0.1846 ≈18.46%). So, the markup is lower than 35%. That would lower the average markup.

But the question says the average markup is 35%. So, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the average markup is calculated as the average of all individual markup percentages.

Wait, that's another possibility. So, each doll's markup is (S - C)/C, which is the markup percentage. The average of all these percentages across 100 dolls is 35%.

So, the sum of all (S_i - C)/C for i from 1 to 100 is 35.

But C is the same for all, so sum (S_i - C)/C = 35 → sum (S_i - C) = 35 C.

Which can be rewritten as sum S_i - 100 C = 35 C → sum S_i = 135 C.

So, the average selling price is 135 C / 100 = 1.35 C.

Which for C=3.25 is 3.25 *1.35=4.3875, which is about $4.39.

Wait, so each doll's selling price is 4.39, so the markup is 1.1375, which is 35% of cost.

But the first 25 were sold for $6, which is higher than $4.39. So, that suggests that the markup on the cost is lower for the first 25, which would lower the average.

But the problem states that the average markup is 35%. So, perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the average markup is 35%, which is the markup on the cost. So, each doll's markup is 35% of its cost, so all are sold at 3.25 * 1.35 = $4.39.

But the first 25 were sold at $6, which is higher than $4.39. So, that would mean the markup is higher than 35% for those. But the problem says that the average markup is 35%, which suggests that the markup is 35% for all, but that can't be because the first 25 were sold at a higher markup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the average markup across all 100 is 35%, which would require that the markup of the remaining dolls is lower than 35% of their cost, but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the markup is calculated based on the selling price, and the average markup is 35% of the selling price.

Wait, that would be a different approach. Let me try that.

If the markup is 35% of the selling price, then for each doll, S = C / (1 - 0.35) = C / 0.65 ≈ 5. So, $5.00.

But then the first 25 dolls were sold at $6, which is higher than $5, so the markup would be higher than 35% on the selling price.

Wait, but the problem states that the average markup is 35%, so perhaps the markup is 35% on cost, and the average markup across all dolls is 35% on cost, which would require all dolls to have the same markup percentage.

Wait, that doesn't make sense either because the first 25 were sold at a higher markup.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it step by step.

Total cost for 100 dolls: 100 * 3.25 = $325.

Total markup across all dolls should be 35% of the total cost. So, total markup is 325 * 0.35 = $113.75.

The first 25 dolls were sold at $6 each, so their total revenue is 25 *6 = $150. Their total cost is 25*3.25= $81.25. The markup for these is $150 -$81.25 = $68.75.

So, the remaining 75 dolls need to provide a markup of 113.75 -68.75 = $45.

So, the total markup for the 75 dolls is $45. So, the average markup per doll is $45 /75 = $0.60.

The markup is S - C, so $0.60 = S - 3.25 → S=3.85.

So, the remaining dolls should be sold at $3.85 each.

Wait, but that would mean that each doll's markup is 0.60, which is 18% of the cost. So, the markup percentage is 18% of cost, which is lower than 35% of cost. So, the markup is lower than 35%, which would lower the average.

But the problem says that the average markup is 35%. So, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the markup is calculated as 35% of the selling price. Let's try that.

So, markup is 35% of S, so S = C / (1 - 0.35) = C / 0.65 ≈5 per doll.

So, each doll should be sold at $5.00.

But then, the first 25 dolls were sold at $6, which is higher than $5, so the markup is (6-5)=1, which is 20% of the selling price. That would be lower than 35%, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the markup is 35% of the cost, and the markup for the remaining dolls is 35% of their cost as well. So, their selling price would be 3.25 *1.35 = $4.39. Then, the first 25 dolls are sold at $6, which is a markup of 84.6%, which is higher than 35%. So, how can the average markup be 35%?

Wait, maybe the problem is about the average markup percentage, not the absolute markup. So, the markup for each doll is 35% of their cost.

But the first 25 dolls were sold at a higher markup, which would mean their markup percentage is higher than 35%, which would make the average higher than 35%, which isn't what the problem says.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the markup is 35% of the selling price, and the average markup across all dolls is 35% of the selling price.

Wait, that's another approach. So, the markup is 35% of the selling price, which would be the same for all dolls. So, S = C / (1 - 0.35) = C / 0.65 ≈5 per doll.

So, each doll is sold at $5.00, with a markup of 35% of the selling price.

But then, the first 25 were sold at $6, which is 10% markup on the cost (6 -3.25=2.75; 2.75/3.25=84.6%). That's inconsistent with the markup method.

Alternatively, perhaps the markup is 35% of the cost, and the first 25 were sold at a higher markup, which would lower the average.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of it in terms of the average markup.

The problem states that the average markup is 35%, so the average markup across all 100 dolls is 35%.

So, the total markup is 35% of total cost, which is 325 *0.35=113.75.

Total markup from first 25 dolls is 68.75; so, the total markup from the remaining 75 is 113.75-68.75=45.

So, average markup for the remaining is 45/75=0.60.

So, each doll's markup is 0.60, which is 18% of cost. So, selling price is 3.25 +0.60=3.85.

So, the remaining dolls are sold at $3.85 each.

But, in this scenario, the markup for the first 25 dolls is 2.75, which is 84.6% of cost, which is much higher than 35%. So, the average markup would be 35% for the remaining dolls, but 84.6% for the first 25 dolls. So, the overall average would be higher than 35%.

But the problem states that the average markup is 35%, so perhaps this is not the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the markup is 35% of the selling price, but the first 25 are sold at a higher markup, which causes the average to drop.

But without more information, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the remaining dolls to be sold at $5.00 each, which is 35% of the cost, and the first 25 are sold at a higher markup, but the problem doesn't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the markup is 35% of the cost, but the first 25 were sold at a different markup, which affects the overall average.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the average markup is 35% of the selling price, which is 3.85 *0.35=1.35, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of it another way.

The total markup across all dolls is 113.75.

First 25: 68.75.

Remaining 75: 45.

So, average markup for the remaining is 45/75=0.6. So, selling price is 3.25 +0.6=3.85.

So, the answer is option C: $3.85.

Wait, but that can't be right because the markup is 35% of cost. Wait, 3.85 is 3.25 *1.20, so markup is 0.60, which is 18% of cost. So, the markup is lower than 35%.

So, the average markup across all dolls would be lower than 35%, but the problem says the average is 35%.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is that the total markup is 113.75, first 25 contribute 68.75, remaining 75 contribute 45. So, average per doll 45, so selling price 3.85. So, the answer is C: $3.85.
</think>

The remaining dolls should be sold at a price that ensures the average markup across all 100 dolls is 35%. The total markup required is calculated as follows:

- Total markup for all dolls: 100 × 3.25 × 0.35 = $113.75.
-Markup for the first 25 dolls: 25 × (6 - 3.25) = $68.75.
- Markup for the remaining 75 dolls: $113.75 - $68.75 = $45.
- Selling price for the remaining dolls: (45 / 75) + 3.25 = $5.00.

However, considering the markup calculation based on cost, the remaining dolls should be sold at $3.85 each to achieve an average markup of 35% across all dolls. 

ANSWER: C
