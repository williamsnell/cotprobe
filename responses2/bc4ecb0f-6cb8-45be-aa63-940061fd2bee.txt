Okay, so I've got this question here about multiplication and addition. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that Katie is going on vacation for 3 weeks and wants to find out how many days she'll miss by multiplying 5 by 3. But she needs another way to express that same multiplication. The options are A to J, each with different expressions.

Hmm, wait, the initial part says she's finding the number of days of work she'll miss by multiplying 5 × 3. So 5 times 3 is 15, so she's thinking about 15 days of work. But she wants another way to express this. So which expression is equal to 5 × 3?

I remember that multiplication can be represented in different ways, like repeated addition. So 5 × 3 would be the same as adding 5 three times or adding 3 five times. Let me look at the options.

Option A is 5+3+3, which is adding 5 once and 3 twice. That's 5 + 3 +3 = 11, which is not 15. So A is wrong.

Option B is 3+3+3, which is three 3s added together. That equals 9, not 15. So B is also incorrect.

Option C is 5×5, which is 25. That's more than 15. So C is out.

Option D is 5×3×3. Oh wait, that's 15 ×3 which is 45. That's way too big, so D is not it.

Option E is 5×2×3. That's 10×3 which is 30. No, that's higher than 15.

Option F is 5+5+5, which is three 5s added. 5+5+5 is 15. That's exactly what we need. So F seems correct.

Option G is 5+5+5, same as F, so G is same as F. So it's correct.

Option H is 3×4+5. Let's compute that. 3×4 is 12, plus 5 is 17. Not 15.

Option I is 3+5, which is 8. No.

Option J is 3×3×3, which is 27. No.

Wait, so F and G are the same. So the correct answer is F or G. But since both are the same, probably F is the direct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck. The question is asking for another way. So F is 5+5+5, which is 15, same as 5×3. So F is correct. G is the same as F, so they're both correct, but perhaps the options are to choose one, so F is the right choice.

The correct answer is F, as 5+5+5 equals 15, which is the same as 5×3. G is identical to F, so both are correct. However, F is the most straightforward expression.

Answer: F
