Okay, so I've got this audit question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the auditor's objective when testing details for sales. Specifically, the objective is to detect overstatement. So, the auditor wants to check if there's any overstatement in the sales figures, meaning they want to see if sales figures are higher than they actually are. 

I remember that in auditing, when testing accounts, auditors often trace transactions from one journal to another to see if there's any discrepancies. The goal is to catch if the accounts have been overstated.

So, the question is asking from which source the transactions should be traced to detect overstatement in sales. Let me look at the options:

A: Customer's purchase orders to the sales journal. Hmm, I don't think this is the right approach because the customer's orders might be recorded later, but it's unclear if that's the point of tracing.

B: Shipping documents to the cash receipts journal. That seems off. Shipping documents are probably for the customer, so maybe the cash receipts would receive the products, and shipping documents would be separate. Tracing from shipping to cash receipts might not help detect overstatement in sales.

C: Cash receipts to shipping documents. No, this doesn't make sense. Cash receipts are where the company receives money, and shipping documents are sent to customers. Tracing from cash receipts to shipping might not show if sales are overstated.

D: Sales journal to cash receipts. Oh, this looks promising. If the sales are recorded in the sales journal and then the cash receipts are recorded, if the sales are overstated, the cash receipts would be too. So this would help spot overstatements.

E: Sales journal to shipping documents. Wait, shipping documents are separate. If the sales are in the sales journal, and shipping documents are separate, tracing this might not catch any variance in sales. It's more about tracking inventory or cash, not sales.

F: Shipping documents to sales journals. That's the reverse of E. If shipping documents are sent to the sales journal, it's unclear how this would help detect overstatement in sales.

G: Customer's purchase orders to cash receipts. Again, this is about customer orders, not sales. It's more about tracking the customers' transactions, not the sales figures.

H: Cash receipts to customer purchase orders. Same issue as G; this is about receiving money for customer orders, not sales.

I: Shipping documents to customer orders. This seems contradictory. If shipping documents are sent to customer orders, that might not be right because shipping documents are for customers, not for the company's sales.

J: Customer's purchase orders to shipping documents. This is about sending documents to customers, which is the opposite of what we're looking for. We need to see if the company's sales are overstated, so we'd trace from sales journals to cash receipts, not the other way around.

So, the correct approach is to go from the sales journal (where sales are recorded) to the cash receipts journal (where cash is received). This way, if the sales were overstated, the cash receipts would have been recorded as a lower amount than they should be. Therefore, option D is the right choice.

The correct answer is D: Sales journal to the cash receipts journal.
