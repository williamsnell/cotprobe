Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the resistance of an electric toaster. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the toaster takes a current of 5 amperes when connected to a 120-volt circuit. I remember from my classes that there's a formula that relates voltage, current, and resistance. Oh right, Ohm's Law!

Wait, what's Ohm's Law again? Oh right, it's V equals I multiplied by R, right? So V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. Oh, wait, but that's V = I * R, so to find R, I need to rearrange it. So R equals V divided by I. Oh yeah, R = V/I.

So the voltage here is 120 volts, and the current is 5 amperes. Plugging those numbers in, R would be 120 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 120 รท 5 is 24. So the resistance should be 24 ohms.

Now looking at the options, option C is 24 ohms. So that's the answer. Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake? Because sometimes when you're dealing with electrical appliances, they have specific power ratings. Oh, maybe I should check if the toaster's power is within a standard range. Oh, wait, power is I squared times R, or V squared over R. Let me see, 5 squared is 25, times 24 is 600 watts. That seems high for a toaster, but I guess it's a common household item. Or maybe it's a different power source? Oh wait, the voltage given is 120 volts. If the resistance is 24, the power would be 5^2 * 24 = 600 W. That's 600 W, which is 600 joules per second. That's a lot, but maybe it's a higher power device. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the power using V^2 / R. 120 squared is 14400. Divided by 24 is 600 W. Same result. So that seems correct.

So the resistance is definitely 24 ohms, so option C is the correct answer.

To determine the resistance of the electric toaster, we use Ohm's Law, which states \( V = I \times R \). Rearranging for resistance, \( R = \frac{V}{I} \). Substituting the given values, \( R = \frac{120 \, \text{V}}{5 \, \text{A}} = 24 \, \text{ohms} \). 

Looking at the options, the correct answer is **C: 24 ohms**.
