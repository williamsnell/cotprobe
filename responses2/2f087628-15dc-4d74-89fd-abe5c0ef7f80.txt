Okay, so I've got this economics question here about market failures and positive externalities. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says, "When the production or consumption of a good creates a positive externality, it is deemed a market failure because at the market quantity..." And then they give options A to J. I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that a positive externality is when someone benefits from someone else's action beyond what is accounted for in the market. Like, if someone gets a job, they might get a bonus, which is a positive externality. So, in such cases, the market doesn't capture all the benefits.

Now, I also recall that market failures occur when the private benefits don't match the social benefits. The main failure types are overproduction (too much) and underproduction (too little). So, in the case of a positive externality, society is better off because of the good's production, but the market isn't reflecting that because it only considers private benefits.

Wait, the question is about why it's a market failure. The key here is that the private benefits are less than the social benefits. So, the market isn't producing the socially optimal quantity because it doesn't account for the external benefits.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are about how private and social benefits compare. Let me break it down.

Option A: Society produces too little. That's more of a market failure scenario, but A is the opposite of the cause. So probably not the answer.

Option B: the social benefits exceed private. That makes sense because the market isn't producing enough because the social benefits are more than what's private. So this could be the correct answer.

Option C: Marginal social benefit exceeds marginal social cost. Hmm, I think that's about efficiency. So if the market produces where the private marginal benefit equals private marginal cost, but in this case, the social benefits are higher. So maybe C is about marginal costs, which is a different aspect.

Option D: marginal private benefit exceeds social cost. Oh, wait, no. The question is about positive externality, so the social benefits are higher. So D is about private benefits over social costs, which is correct because the market is not producing enough.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Positive externality means that the social benefit of producing the good is higher than what the market accounts for. So, for example, if a factory emits noise that affects people, the factory's private benefit is the profit from production, but the social benefit includes the cost of the noise (like health issues) that society benefits from. So, the market (the factory) only considers the private benefits, not the social costs.

So in the case of a positive externality, the social marginal benefit is higher than the private marginal benefit. So when the market produces the quantity where the private marginal benefit equals the private marginal cost, it's producing less than the socially optimal level.

But the question is asking why it's deemed a market failure. The correct reason is that the social benefits exceed the private ones.

Looking at the options again, option B says "the social benefits exceed the private benefits." That's correct because the market isn't producing the quantity where social benefits equal costs.

Wait, but another point: in option D, it's about the marginal private benefit (MPB) exceeding the marginal social cost (MSC). Because in market equilibrium, MPB = MSC. But that's when there are no externalities. With externalities, the market's MPB is lower than the social MPB. So to get the socially optimal quantity, you'd set MPB = MSC, which includes the external benefits.

So, for a positive externality, the social marginal benefit (SMB) is greater than the private marginal benefit (MPB). So the market's MPPB is less than SMB. Hence, the market won't produce at the SMB point because the market's MPB is lower.

So the reason for the market failure is that the social benefits (SMB) are higher than the private benefits (MPB). So the correct statement is that the social benefits exceed the private ones, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D says that the MPB exceeds the social cost. Hmm, no, because if the externality is positive, the social cost would be less than the private cost. Or perhaps I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, let me clarify:

- Positive externality: The good benefits society beyond what's private. So the social marginal benefit (SMB) is higher than the private marginal benefit (MPB).

- Negative externality: The good harms society, so the social marginal cost (SMC) is higher than the private marginal cost (MPC). So the market's MPC is lower, leading to overproduction.

So, in a market failure with positive externality, the social MB is higher than the private MB. So the market's MPPB is lower than SMB.

Therefore, the reason for the market failure is that the social benefits (SMB) exceed the private benefits (MPB). So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me recall the question again. It's about why it's a market failure. The answer is when the market doesn't produce the social optimum. So in this case, the market isn't producing where the social benefits equal the costs because the private benefits don't include the external benefits. So the market produces where private MPPB equals private MPPC (because private MPPB is less than social MPPB), leading to underproduction.

But the question is about the characteristics of the market failure. So the correct reason is that the social benefits exceed the private benefits. So option B is correct.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

A: Society produces too little. That's about quantity. So not the cause of the market failure, but the result.

B: social benefits exceed private. Correct.

C: marginal social benefit exceeds marginal social cost. That relates to efficiency, not the cause of the market failure.

D: marginal private benefit exceeds marginal social cost. Hmm, perhaps that's another way to look at it. Wait, if the private benefits (MPB) exceed the social marginal cost (SMC), then the market would produce where MPB equals SMC. But in the case of positive externality, the market's MPB is less than the social MB, which is higher. So, the market would produce where the private MPB is less than the social MB. So that's equilibrium at the private MPPB. But social MB is higher, so the market isn't producing the right quantity.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the two concepts. Let me think about the definition of the externality.

In a market failure with a positive externality, the social marginal benefit exceeds the private marginal benefit. So the question is which option reflects that.

Looking back at the options, option B says "the social benefits exceed the private benefits." That's correct because the market's private benefits are less than the social benefits. So the market fails to produce at the socially optimal level because it's underproducing.

So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

When a good creates a positive externality, it benefits society beyond what is captured in the market. This leads to a market failure because the private benefits of production or consumption do not account for the external benefits. The correct reason for this market failure is that the social benefits exceed the private benefits. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. This describes an overproduction scenario, not a market failure caused by externalities.
- **Option B**: Correct. This directly states that social benefits exceed private benefits, which is the defining characteristic of a market failure due to positive externalities.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This refers to efficiency, not the cause of market failure.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While true in some contexts, it does not capture the essence of the market failure caused by externalities.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. This describes an overproduction scenario, not a market failure.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. This relates to private costs and benefits, not the externality aspect.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. This is the reverse of the correct scenario.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. This describes an underproduction scenario, not a market failure.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. This refers to private costs and benefits, not the externality issue.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. This describes an overproduction scenario, not a market failure.

The correct answer is that the social benefits exceed the private benefits, which is captured by **Option B**.
