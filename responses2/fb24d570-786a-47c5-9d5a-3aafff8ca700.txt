Okay, so I've got this question about when an element ejects a beta particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear chemistry, but let me think this through.

Beta decay, right? I remember that beta particles are emitted when a neutron in a nucleus converts into a proton, emitting an electron and a neutrino. So that's a positive change in the atomic number. Let me clarify: The process is something like a neutron turning into a proton and emitting a beta particle. 

Wait, let me think about the nuclear notation. A neutron is represented as a 'n' or 'n' in the nucleus. When a neutron turns into a proton, that's a change in the atomic number. Because protons are in the nucleus and affect the atomic number. So if a neutron turns into a proton, the atomic number increases by one. Because the number of protons (which is the atomic number) goes up by one.

So the element ejecting a beta particle is undergoing beta decay. For example, carbon-14 undergoes beta decay to become nitrogen-14. Carbon-14 has atomic number 6, and nitrogen-14 has atomic number 7. So the atomic number increases by 1. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be C: increases by 1. Let me look at the options again. Option C is increases by 1. That fits. 

Wait, what about other possibilities? Could it be something like increasing by 3? I don't think so because in beta decay, it's just a single proton conversion. There's no possibility of multiple protons or something. 

What about if it's the atomic number changing by 3? Maybe in some other type of decay, but beta decay is specifically about a single proton change. So no, it's not that. 

So the main point is that when a beta particle is emitted, the atomic number increases by 1. So the correct option is C.

When an element ejects a beta particle, it undergoes beta decay, where a neutron in the nucleus converts into a proton and emits a beta particle. This change increases the atomic number by one, as the number of protons (which defines the atomic number) increases. 

The correct answer is **C: increases by 1**.

Answer: C
