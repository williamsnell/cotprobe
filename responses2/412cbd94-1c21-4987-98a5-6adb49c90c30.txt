Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the net cost of a $120 television set that's discounted by 30% and then 20%. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to calculate the first discount. The TV is $120, and it's discounted by 30%. I remember that to find a percentage discount, you multiply the original price by the discount rate. So 30% of 120 would be 0.30 * 120. Let me do that math: 0.3 * 120 equals 36. That means the first discount is $36. 

Wait, no, wait. So if the TV is $120, then 30% off would reduce the price. So I subtract the discount from the original price. So $120 minus $36 is $84. So after the first discount, the price is $84.

Now, the second discount is 20% on the new price. So I need to calculate 20% of $84. 0.20 * 84. Let me compute that: 0.2 * 80 is 16, and 0.2 * 4 is 0.8, so total is $16.80. 

Wait, but wait again. So the second discount of 20% is applied to the already discounted price of $84. So I subtract $16.80 from $84. Let me do that: 84 minus 16.80 equals $67.20. 

Hmm, wait another thing. Maybe I should think of it in a different way. Sometimes, discounts are applied sequentially, so the second discount is based on the new price. So perhaps another approach is to calculate the total discount as a combined percentage. 

Alternatively, I could calculate the combined discount. The first discount is 30%, so 70% remains. Then the second discount is 20%, so 80% remains. So the overall remaining percentage is 70% * 80% = 56%. So 56% of the original price. 

Let me calculate that. 56% of $120 is 0.56 * 120. Hmm, 0.5 * 120 is 60, and 0.06 * 120 is 7.2, so total is 67.20. That's the same result as before. So the net cost is $67.20.

Looking at the options, option J is $67.20, which matches. So the correct answer should be J.

The net cost of the television after successive discounts is calculated by first applying a 30% discount, reducing the price to $84, and then applying a 20% discount, which brings the final price to $67.20. This matches option J.

Answer: J: $67.20
