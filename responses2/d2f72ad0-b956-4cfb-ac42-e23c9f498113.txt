Okay, so I've got this question about a diffraction grating and resolving a sodium doublet. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the sodium doublet has wavelengths at 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm. Oh wait, sodium's doublet is usually around that range, I think. Then it mentions that the diffraction grating is blazed for the second order. And the question is about how many lines the grating needs to have to resolve the doublet. The options are from A to J, each with varying numbers.

Wait, I remember that in a diffraction grating, the condition for constructive interference is usually d*sin(theta) = m*lambda, where d is the grating spacing, m is the order, and lambda is the wavelength. But when the grating is blazed, they're probably making it such that each line is at a slightly different angle to maximize the number of lines. Or maybe using a setup where the maximum diffraction order is achieved with the most intensity of the spectral lines. I'm a bit hazy on the specifics here.

Resolving power is about the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced spectral lines. The resolving power R can be calculated using the formula R = m * N, where m is the order and N is the number of lines. Wait, but for resolving a doublet, R is about (lambda1)/(delta lambda), where delta lambda is the line spacing. So in this case, the doublet is at 589.0 and 589.6, so delta lambda is 0.6 nm.

Wait, the formula for resolving power (RN) is RN = m * (N + 1) * (lambda_max)/(delta lambda). But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to use the formula for resolving more accurately. The resolving power R is given by R = (m * lambda_max) / (delta lambda). Oh wait, no, more accurately, R = (lambda_max) / (delta lambda). Because when you have a doublet, the resolving power is determined by the maximum wavelength between the two lines. Since the doublet is a pair of closely spaced lines, R is roughly lambda_max divided by the line spacing (delta lambda). Wait, no, the line spacing is delta lambda, and the maximum wavelength in the doublet is lambda_max, so R would be lambda_max / (lambda2 - lambda1). Because the maximum you can resolve is when the largest lambda is just beyond the second order.

Wait, maybe I should think about the limiting condition for resolving. The condition is that the two lines should be such that their diffracted orders are just resolved. So the maximum order for the first line's diffraction and the minimum order for the second line's diffraction should be such that their angles are just beyond each other's resolving power. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the condition for maximum resolution is when the angle of the first order (m=1) of the second line is just equal to the angle of the first order (m=0) of the first line. No, wait, perhaps the condition is that the angle for the second order maximum of the first line is just equal to the angle for the first order maximum of the second line. Or I'm mixing this up.

Wait, another approach: The resolving power R is defined as the number of wavelengths that can just be resolved. R is given by (lambda_max) / (delta lambda), where lambda_max is the maximum wavelength present in the doublet (here 589.6 nm), and delta lambda is the line spacing (0.6 nm). So R = 589.6e-9 m / 0.6e-9 m = approximately 982.67. So R is about 983.

But wait, when using diffraction, we have the grating equation d sin(theta) = m lambda. For each line, the order m would be such that when you have two lines, you need their angles to be separated by at least delta theta to be resolvable. The resolving condition is when the angle of the second order maximum of the first line is just equal to the angle of the first order maximum of the second line plus some small angle delta theta. But if the grating is blazed, maybe the setup is optimized for maximum resolving power.

But wait, the problem says the grating is blazed so as to be most effective in the second order. So we're looking for the maximum number of lines in the second order that can still resolve the two lines. Hmm.

Wait another thing: The number of lines N is given by N = (m) * (lambda_max)/(d) +1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the number of lines is related to the maximum number of orders you can have in the diffraction. Let's think about the critical condition for two lines to be resolved.

The condition for two lines to be just resolved in the second order is that the angle of the m=2 maximum of the first line (589.0 nm) is equal to the angle of the m=1 maximum of the second line (589.6 nm), plus some small angle (like the diffraction angle). Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the resolving condition in a diffraction grating is R = m * N + 1, where R is the resolving power. So solving for N: N = (R -1)/m. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, let's think about the setup. The maximum number of lines is determined by the highest order you can achieve. But when you blaze the grating, the maximum order is determined by the diffraction limit. Wait, but we're using second order, so m = 2.

Wait, for each line, the condition is d sin(theta) = m lambda. The maximum angle occurs when sin(theta) is as large as possible, which is when theta approaches 90 degrees (sin(theta) approaches 1). So for a given grating spacing d, the maximum order m is given by m = floor( lambda_max / d ), but perhaps that's not right.

Let me think again. The maximum order m for a given lambda is when d sin(theta) = m lambda. The maximum m possible for a given lambda is when sin(theta) is 1 (i.e., theta = 90 degrees). Then m_max = lambda_max / d.

But if the grating is blazed to be used best in the second order, that means that the maximum order is m=2. So the maximum m for the second order is 2.

But wait, perhaps the condition is that the maximum order is 2. So for each line, the maximum order is 2. So for each line, m = 2. But the lines have different wavelengths.

Wait, but the maximum number of lines N is determined by the highest order of diffraction possible. Hmm. Alternatively, the number of lines N must satisfy that N is the number of lines that can be arranged such that their diffraction orders are just resolved.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the number of lines is N = (m * lambda_max) / (lambda_2 - lambda_1).

Let me plug the numbers. So lambda_1 =589.0 nm, lambda_2=589.6 nm. The difference is 0.6 nm. m=2. So N = (2 * 589.6) / 0.6 = (1179.2) / 0.6 = 1965.333… So about 1965 lines. But looking at the options, the highest is G:480, F:450, etc., and the options don't go up to 2000. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Another formula I’ve seen for the number of lines when resolving two lines is N = (m * (lambda_2 - lambda_1)) / (lambda_max). Wait, no, that's not making sense because it would give a very large number.

Wait, perhaps the resolving condition is when the angle of the second order maximum of the first line is just beyond the angle of the first order maximum of the second line plus some delta. Let me model this.

Assume that the maximum angle for the second order is 90 degrees. Then, for the first line (lambda1), m=2: d sin(theta) = 2 lambda1. So sin(theta1) = 2 lambda1 / d. For the second line (lambda2), m=1: sin(theta2) = lambda2 / d.

Wait, but the condition is that theta2 + delta_theta >= theta1 + delta_theta, but perhaps the critical condition is when their angles differ by a small amount, say, theta2 - theta1 = delta_theta.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the angle for the second order of the first line is just beyond the first order of the second line. So, (2 lambda1)/d = (lambda2)/d + delta_theta.

But without knowing delta_theta, this approach might not work. Alternatively, the condition is that the angle of the first order maximum of the second line is just beyond the angle of the second order maximum of the first line. So:

sin(theta2) = lambda2 / d = (sin(theta1) + delta_theta) = (2 lambda1 / d) + delta_theta.

But this seems complicated unless I can find a way to relate theta1 and theta2.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the maximum number of lines that can be resolved in the second order. The resolving power would allow the lines to be just resolved. The formula for resolving power R is R = (lambda_max) / (delta lambda). So R = 589.6e-9 m / 0.6e-9 m = approx 982.67.

R is also equal to m*N, where m is the order, and N is the number of lines. So, m=2, R=2*N. Wait, that would mean N= R/2= approx 491.333. So approximately 491 lines.

Looking at the options, J is 491 lines. So the answer should be J:491 lines.

But wait, let me make sure. The formula R = m*N is correct when N is the number of lines that can be resolved in m-th order. So, given that the resolving power R is 982, and m=2, N= R/m= 982/2=491. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is J:491 lines.
</think>

To determine the minimum number of lines required in a diffraction grating to resolve the sodium doublet (wavelengths 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm) in the second order (m = 2), we use the resolving power formula:

\[
R = \frac{\lambda_{\text{max}}}{\Delta \lambda}
\]

Here:
- \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = 589.6 \, \text{nm}\) (the larger wavelength of the doublet),
- \(\Delta \lambda = 589.6 \, \text{nm} - 589.0 \, \text{nm} = 0.6 \, \text{nm}\).

Substituting the values:

\[
R = \frac{589.6}{0.6} \approx 982.67
\]

The resolving power \(R\) is also related to the number of lines \(N\) and the order \(m\) by:

\[
R = m \cdot N
\]

Given \(m = 2\), we solve for \(N\):

\[
N = \frac{R}{m} = \frac{982.67}{2} \approx 491.33
\]

Since the number of lines must be an integer, we round down to \(N = 491\). Therefore, the diffraction grating must have at least 491 lines to resolve the sodium doublet in the second order.
