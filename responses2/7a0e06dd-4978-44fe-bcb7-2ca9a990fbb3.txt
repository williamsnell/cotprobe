Okay, so I've got this question about converting body temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember that the average body temperature is 98.6°F. So, the problem is to convert this to both scales. I think the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is something like (°F - 32) multiplied by 5/9. Let me write that down.

So, (98.6 - 32) = 66.6. Then multiply by 5/9. Let me calculate that. 66.6 * 5 = 333, and divided by 9 is 37. So that's 37°C. Hmm, wait, but wait—what's the exact calculation? Let me do it more precisely.

98.6 minus 32 is 66.6. Multiply by 5: 66.6 *5 = 333. Then divide by 9: 333/9 is 37 exactly, right? So yeah, 37°C is correct. 

Now, converting that to Kelvin. I know that Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So 37 + 273.15 equals 310.15 K. So the temperature is 310.15 K. 

Looking back at the options, let me check each. Option A is 37.00°C and 310.15 K. That matches what I've got. Let me quickly glance at the other options to make sure. Option B is about 37.5°C, which is probably a higher value. Wait, if I messed up the initial calculation, perhaps I got that wrong.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. 98.6°F to Celsius: (98.6 -32) is 66.6. 66.6 *5/9. Let me compute that accurately. 66.6 *5 is 333. 333 divided by 9. Let me see: 9*37 is 333, so yes, 37. So that's correct.

So the Celsius is 37.00°C, which is option A. Then Kelvin is 37 +273.15 = 310.15 K. Looking at the options, option A is 37.00°C and 310.15 K. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but why are the other options different? Let me see. Option E is 35°C and 308.15 K. Oh, because 35 +273 is 308. So that's 35°C. But why 35? Because 35°C is 308.15 K, but that's not the average temperature. Oh, right, so why is 35 in option E? Because maybe I confused 98.6 with 98.6, but no, I think it's correct.

So the correct answer is option A. Let me check the other options quickly. Option G is 38°C, which would be if I did 98.6 minus 32 as 66.6, but multiplied by 9/5 instead of 5/9. Oh, wait, maybe I got the formula reversed. Wait, the formula is (°F -32) multiplied by 5/9. So if someone miscalculates, that would cause an error. But in this case, 98.6 is correct and leads to 37°C.

So the correct answer is option A: 37.00°C and 310.15 K.

The average body temperature is 98.6°F. To convert this to Celsius, the formula is:

\[
°C = \frac{(°F - 32) \times 5}{9}
\]

Substituting 98.6°F:

\[
°C = \frac{(98.6 - 32) \times 5}{9} = \frac{66.6 \times 5}{9} = 37.00°C
\]

To convert 37.00°C to Kelvin, the formula is:

\[
K = °C + 273.15
\]

Substituting 37.00°C:

\[
K = 37.00 + 273.15 = 310.15 K
\]

Thus, the body temperature is 37.00°C and 310.15 K. Checking the options, option A matches these values.
