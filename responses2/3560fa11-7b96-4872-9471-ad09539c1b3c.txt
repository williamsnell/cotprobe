Question:

An athlete hoped to sign a contract with a professional baseball team to play baseball. He had succeeded in arranging for a tryout at the baseball team's training facilities in a neighboring state. Short on funds and needing a way to get to the training facilities, the athlete approached his friend and said, "If you will drive me to and from the baseball team's training facilities for my tryout and pay for our housing and meal expenses during our stay, I will assign to you 10 percent of my first-year earnings. " The friend agreed and drove the athlete to the training facilities. After the tryout, the baseball team offered the athlete a contract to play baseball for the team at $100,000 per year. When the friend asked when he would be receiving his 10 percent, the athlete replied that $10,000 was much more than the friend deserved and he would pay the friend $1,000 for his efforts. The friend then filed suit to enforce the assignment. If the court holds the assignment unenforceable, the most applicable legal principle would be

Options:

A: the assignment was not in writing, therefore it is not enforceable.
B: a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.
C: the assignment was not fair and reasonable, therefore it can be revoked.
D: the athlete was under duress when making the assignment, rendering it unenforceable.
E: the assignment is unenforceable because the athlete's contract with the baseball team prohibited any assignment of earnings.
F: the friend did not provide a valuable consideration in return for the assignment.
G: an assignment of a right expected to arise from a future event is enforceable once the event occurs.
H: a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.
I: the friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.
J: a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let's read it carefully.

An athlete tried out for a baseball team's contract. He arranged for a tryout, which I assume means he got to the training facilities. But he ran into funds trouble, so he approached his friend for help. The friend agreed to drive him, pay for their stay, and give him 10% of his first-year earnings as a bonus. 

The athlete said $10,000 was way more than the friend should get, so he agreed to pay $1,000. But then the friend sued, claiming the assignment was unenforceable. The question is about the legal principle that applies if the court says the assignment is unenforceable.

The options are A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

Let's break it down. The situation is about an assignment of a rightâ€”probably a contract right. An assignment is when someone gives up a part of a contract and takes it. Here, the friend is assigning a right to the athlete. 

In contract law, an assignment is enforceable if the original contract is valid. The key here is whether the original contract was enforceable. If the friend's assignment was unenforceable, the court's ruling depends on whether the original contract was valid.

Option A says the assignment wasn't in writing, so it's not enforceable. That's a possible issue because contracts are usually written. If it's not in writing, maybe it's not enforceable. But option G says an assignment arising from a future event (like a tryout) is enforceable once the event occurs. That sounds relevant. 

Option G's reasoning is that if the assignment is for something happening in the future, like the tryout, and it's a promise to assign the right when it arises, but not yet existing, then it's not enforceable. But in this case, the assignment was made, then the athlete accepted it. So the assignment occurred, but the right was not yet created.

Wait, but the friend's assignment is for the athlete's first-year earnings. In contract law, assignment typically requires that the original contract includes the specific terms for the assignment. If the original contract doesn't clearly state that the assignment is for the athlete's earnings, then the assignment might not be enforceable.

Looking back: The athlete arranged to have the friend drive to tryout, pay for their stay, and give 10% as a bonus. Then the athlete accepted. But the friend later sued because the friend's assignment was deemed unenforceable. So the assignment was made, then the athlete accepted it. 

If the original contract didn't state that the assignment is for the athlete's earnings, then the assignment isn't enforceable. Because the contract needs to specify what the assignment is for.

So if the original contract was a future assignment, which it might be (like a signed contract for some future benefit), but the details are unclear. The contract could be a future assignment without clear terms, making it unenforceable. 

Looking at the options, option G says assignments expected to arise from future events are enforceable once the event happens. So in this case, the assignment was for the athlete's earnings, which was a future benefit. So the assignment is unenforceable, making G the correct answer.

Alternatively, option H says a contract for a future assignment is invalid. That aligns with G's reasoning. So the correct answer would be G.

The assignment of a right arising from a future event is enforceable once the event occurs. This is supported by the reasoning that the assignment is unenforceable because the original contract lacked clear terms for the assignment of earnings. 

Answer: G
