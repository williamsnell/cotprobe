Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the molecular mass of a gas. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The question gives me the density, temperature, and pressure, and I need to find the molar mass.

Wait, I remember that when you have density, pressure, and temperature, you can use the ideal gas law. Oh right, the formula is PV = nRT. But density is mass over volume, so maybe I can relate them.

The formula I think I should use is the one that connects density with molar mass. Let me jot down what I know. The density (d) is 2.05 g/L. Temperature is 26.0 degrees Celsius. Pressure is 722 torr. Oh wait, I should convert that pressure to atmospheres because the ideal gas law uses pressure in atm.

Wait, 1 atm is 760 torr. So 722 torr divided by 760 equals... let me calculate. 722 divided by 760 is approximately 0.95 correct? Because 760 is 1 atm, so 722 is a little less. Like, 722/760 = 0.95 approximately.

Temperature is 26.0°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin. So add 273.15, so 26 + 273.15 = 299.15 K. Okay.

Now, the ideal gas equation is PV = nRT. We can rearrange this to find n, which is moles. So n = PV/(RT). But wait, density (d) is mass over volume (d = m/V). So m = dV. So n is (dV)/(RT). Then the mass is dV.

But wait, if I plug that into PV = nRT, then PV = (dV)(RT)/M, where M is molar mass. Wait, let me think again. Another approach: Maybe using the form d = (PM)/(RT). Because density d = (PM)/(RT). Oh, wait, that's right! Because d = m/V, and PV = nRT, so PV = (m/V) RT. So d = (m/V) (P/(RT)) ) => d = P/(RT) * (m/V) => d = P/(RT) * (n/V * M) )? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it this way:

From PV = nRT and d = m/V, and m = n*M, so substituting, d = (n*M)/V. So n = (dV)/M. Plugging into PV = nRT, we get PV = (dV/M) RT. Dividing both sides by V, we have P = (d RT)/M. So rearranged, M = (d RT)/P.

Ah, that's the formula I need. So M = (d * R * T) / P. 

Got it. So I can plug in the numbers now.

d is 2.05 g/L. R is the gas constant. I remember it's 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when pressure is in atm. Wait, but earlier I converted 722 torr to 0.95 atm. So let me use that.

So R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 299.15 K, and P is 0.95 atm.

Wait, but wait, wait. The formula uses R as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when pressure is in atm. So yes, that's correct.

So M = (2.05 g/L * 0.0821 L·atm/mol/K * 299.15 K) / 0.95 atm.

Let me compute the numerator first. 2.05 * 0.0821 = let's see. 2 * 0.0821 is 0.1642, 0.05 *0.0821 is 0.004105. Sum ≈ 0.1683. Then multiply by 299.15 K. 0.1683 * 300 is about 50.49, but since it's 299.15, which is 0.85 less than 300, so subtract 0.1683 * 0.85. Let's see: 0.1683 * 0.85 = approximately 0.1445. So 50.49 - 0.1445 = 50.3455. So the numerator is about 50.3455 g·L·atm/(L·mol·K) * K → g·atm/mol.

Wait, wait, units: (g/L) * (L·atm/mol/K) * K → g·atm/mol. Yes.

Then divide by 0.95 atm: 50.3455 / 0.95 = let me compute that. 50.3455 / 0.95. Hmm, 0.95 * 53 = 50.35. Oh wait, because 53 * 0.95 = 50.35. So 50.3455 is about 53. So M ≈ 53 g/mol.

Wait, but wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 100 

B: 4.67 

C: 37.5 

D: 72.2 

E: 26.0 

F: 60.0 

G: 2876 

H:46.7 

I:2050 

J:53.0 

Wait, option J is 53.0 g/mol. So that's the result I got. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made an arithmetic mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me re-calculate the numerator:

2.05 * 0.0821 = ?

2.05 * 0.0821:

2 * 0.0821 = 0.1642

0.05 * 0.0821 = 0.004105

Sum: 0.168305 L·atm/mol.

Now, multiply by 299.15 K: 0.168305 * 299.15.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.168305 * 300 is 50.4915. But because it's 299.15, which is 300 minus 0.85.

So 50.4915 - (0.168305 * 0.85) → let's compute 0.168305 * 0.85.

0.168305 * 0.8 is 0.134644. 0.168305 * 0.05 is 0.00841525. Sum: 0.134644 + 0.00841525 = 0.14305925.

So the numerator is 50.4915 - 0.14305925 = 50.34844075 g·atm/mol.

Divide by 0.95 atm: 50.34844075 / 0.95.

Let me compute that. 50.34844075 ÷ 0.95.

Well, 0.95 * 53 = 50.35, which is very close to 50.3484. So 53 is very close. Let me compute 0.95 * 53 = 50.35. So 50.3484 is just a tiny bit less than 53 → 53 - (0.00155/0.95) → perhaps 53 - 0.0016 = 52.9984, which is roughly 53. So M is approximately 53 g/mol.

So the correct answer should be option J, 53.0 g/mol.

To find the molecular mass of the gas, we use the formula derived from the ideal gas law and the relationship between density, pressure, and temperature:

\[
M = \frac{d \cdot R \cdot T}{P}
\]

### Given Data:
- Density (\(d\)) = 2.05 g/L
- Temperature (\(T\)) = 26.0°C = 299.15 K
- Pressure (\(P\)) = 722 torr = 722 / 760 ≈ 0.95 atm
- Gas constant (\(R\)) = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)

### Calculation:
1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   d \cdot R \cdot T = 2.05 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 299.15
   \]
   - \(2.05 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.1683\)
   - \(0.1683 \cdot 299.15 ≈ 50.3484\)

2. Divide by the pressure:
   \[
   M = \frac{50.3484}{0.95} ≈ 53.0 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The molecular mass of the gas is approximately **53.0 g/mol**, which corresponds to option **J**.
