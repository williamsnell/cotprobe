Question:

In which ways does realism differ from social constructivism in the theorisation of identity within international relations?

Options:

A: Social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritising the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. In contrast, realism regards state of actor behaviour in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern.
B: Realism regards identity as a crucial point for consideration in international relations. Realist theory is based on the assumption that identity informs behaviour.
C: Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.
D: Social constructivists regard the state as an independent unit whose behaviour is shaped by the requirements of the international system, whilst realists regard state interaction as being the natural progression of identity formulation.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about realism versus social constructivism in the theorisation of identity in international relations. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I remember that realism and social constructivism are two different theories in international relations. Realism tends to focus on observable behaviors and causality, while constructivism emphasizes social construction and meaning.

The question is about how each approaches identity. So I need to think about what each theory says about identity.

Realism, I think, views identity as a socially constructed concept. It's about how people categorize each other, like how we associate others with our own. So in international relations, behaviors are seen as a result of these social categories. The state's role is probably important too, but it's more about how these social structures work.

On the other hand, social constructivism would say that identity is not just about social categories but also how the system itself shapes these identities. Like, the international system defines what we are, and that's more about how our identities are constructed through interactions and norms.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Realism includes causality, while social constructivism prioritizes identity as socially constructed. Wait, no. Because the question is about what they consider as identity. Realism might not use causality much, but social constructivism might. Or maybe the other way around.

Option B: Realism bases on identity informing behavior. So Realism thinks that an identity is important for behavior. So in international relations, people's behaviors are influenced by their identity. That sounds correct. But the question is about how each differs. So Realism's theory is that identity is crucial. Social constructivism might say that identity is constructed based on the system's requirements.

Option C: Realism is based on causality, constructivism on identity from intersubjective meanings. Wait, I'm not sure about that. I thought constructivism might focus on meanings rather than causality. So maybe C is wrong.

Option D: Social constructivists think the state is independent, while realists see state interaction as natural identity. Hmm, that makes sense. Social constructivists would view the state as an independent unit, perhaps not necessarily a state, but how we interact with it. Realists would see the state as an integral part of the international system, where state interactions are natural parts of identity formation.

So putting it together: Realism focuses on social constructs (identity) and causality. Social constructivism sees identity formation as part of the system's requirements.

So the correct answer is probably option A or D.

Wait, looking again: Option A says social constructivism prioritizes identity as socially constructed, and realism uses 'action-response' pattern. Wait, I'm not sure about the 'action-response' part. I think realism might not focus on that. Realism might prioritize causality but perhaps doesn't necessarily use an 'action-response' model.

Option D says social constructivists regard the state as an independent unit whose behavior is shaped by the system. Realists consider state interaction as a natural progression of identity. That sounds right.

So the correct answer would be D. Because that's contrasting state independence with state being part of identity formation.

The question asks about the differences between realism and social constructivism in their theories of identity in international relations. Realism emphasizes social constructivity and causality, while social constructivism focuses on the system's role in shaping identities. 

Option D correctly contrasts these two approaches: social constructivists view the state as an independent unit, shaping identities through system requirements, whereas realists see the state as an integral part of the international system, where state interactions are seen as natural parts of identity formation.

**Answer: D**
