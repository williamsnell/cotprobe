Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this question. So, the question is asking which name Mani referred to God by. The options are A to J, each with a different name. I'm not entirely sure which one is correct, so I'll have to think about the meaning of each term.

First, I'll go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Eternal Spirit. That sounds like something related to life and eternity. I know in some religious contexts, the eternal spirit is a concept, like the divine spirit in Christian theology. So this might be a possibility.

Option B: Divine Guardian. This seems like a term from various religious texts. I'm not exactly sure, but I think it refers to something like a divine general or a guiding force. Maybe a spiritual advisor.

Option C: Light Bringer. That sounds like a name for a light or a source of light. Could this be a term for the divine light of God?

Option D: Heavenly Guide. This is another term I've heard in religious contexts. It refers to a divine being who guides or leads people, often in a spiritual or moral direction.

Option E: Mother of Light. This is the name of the source of light in many religions. In Christianity, it's the Source of Light, also known as God's light. So this could be a correct answer.

Option F: Infinite Wisdom. I'm not sure if this is a standard term. It sounds like it might be referring to God's infinite wisdom or knowledge.

Option G: Ineffable Lover. I'm not familiar with this term. It might be a term from certain religious texts, but I don't know the exact meaning.

Option H: Grand Architect. This suggests a divine being who is an architect of existence, perhaps divine in design or structure.

Option I: Father of Goodness. I'm not sure what this refers to. It might be a term from certain religious contexts, like the God of the Good or the Father of the Good.

Option J: Supreme Creator. This is a pretty common term in many religions. It refers to the ultimate creator of all things. So this could be a direct answer.

Now, considering the options, I'm trying to think which of these might be the most commonly used or correct term for God. "Supreme Creator" is a term used in many religions, including Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. It's often the central figure in these beliefs.

Option E: Mother of Light. This also rings a bell. In Christianity, the Source of Light or God's light is indeed called the Mother of Light. So this is another possible correct answer.

Between options E, J, and possibly A or H, I have to decide which one is more likely. Since the question is presented in a way that expects a singular correct answer, perhaps it's referring to the traditional names.

Wait, I remember that in some contexts, "divine light" is referred to as the Mother of Light, but in others, especially in Christian contexts, it's called the eternal spirit. So the question is about which name Mani referred to God by. Since the options include both, I need to think about common usage.

Another approach: looking for the most commonly used term. "Divine Guardian" (B) is a term I've heard, but I'm not as sure about it. "Heavenly Guide" (D) is also common. "Grand Architect" (H) is also a term I've heard, perhaps more in a more formal or esoteric context.

"Supreme Creator" (J) is the most standard. So perhaps the answer is J.

Alternatively, in some languages, "God" is referred to by different names, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, but looking up the options again. The question is about the last character, which is the letter chosen. So the correct answer's last letter is the letter I should choose.

Looking at each option's last letter:

A: E
B: B
C: C
D: D
E: E
F: F
G: G
H: H
I: I
J: J

So, the last letters are E, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

In general, the most common religious terms would be:

E (Mother of Light) in Christianity.

J (Supreme Creator) in many religions.

So, if I have to choose between E and J, which is more likely the answer?

Wait, the question is about which name Mani referred to God by. If Mani is a religious figure, then the answer would depend on the context. But since it's a standard multiple-choice question, the answer is likely one of these.

Another angle: in some contexts, "divine light" is called the Mother of Light. But in others, "divine" is called the Supreme Creator.

In the absence of more context, perhaps the most common term is "Supreme Creator." So the answer would be J.

Alternatively, sometimes "divine light" is referred to as the eternal spirit, which would be A.

But I'm not certain. Maybe the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J: Supreme Creator. This is the most standard and widely accepted term in many religious contexts, referring to the ultimate creator of all things. 

Answer: J
