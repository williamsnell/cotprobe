Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about the production period in marketing history. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking when the production period ended. The options are A through J, each referring to different time periods.

Wait, I remember that the production period was a time when companies were developing their products and marketing strategies. I think it started around the late 1920s or early 1930s. Let me think more carefully.

I recall that the production period was from the late 1930s to the end of the 1940s. The production period was crucial because it involved the development of new products and marketing strategies, leading to the industrial revolution of the 1930s. Then, the world started to shift to the post-war era, so the production period ended around the end of the Second World War.

Looking at the options, option D says "In the late 1930s." That fits because the production period is from late 1930s through the end of the 1940s. The end of the production period would be when that ended, which is after the end of the war. So the production period is active during that time, then it ended.

Other options: A is in the 1960s, which is way after. B is the start of the Industrial Revolution, which is much earlier. C is after the end of WWII, but that's more recent. E is the early 1900s, which isn't relevant. F is the late 1800s, which is too early. G is the 1920s, which is a bit earlier than the production period. H is the early 1950s, which is too recent. I is the end of WWII, which is more recent. J is the mid-1800s, which is way too early.

So the correct answer should be D: In the late 1930s.
