Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about emotions. I need to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question asks me to define emotion in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. The options are A through J. I'll go through each one and see which fits best.

First, let me recall what I know about emotions. I think emotions are complex, involving feelings, responses, and motivation. They can be internal or external. But wait, some options mention related factors.

Option A says emotion is a state of anger. That's too specific. Anger is a type of emotion, but emotions can be varied and include others like fear, joy, sadness, etc. So A might not be the best fit because it only mentions anger, not the broader definition.

Option B says emotion is a behavioral display intended to influence others without internal feelings or motivation. Hmm, behavioral displays might be about behavior, like how others act based on emotions, but I'm not sure if that's the definition of emotion itself. Emotions are about feelings, not just behavior. So maybe B is mixing definitions here.

Option C states emotion is the conscious experience of affect, limited to situations of pleasure or pain. That sounds too narrow. Affects are broader; emotions include more than just pleasure and pain. So C might not capture the full definition.

Option D says emotion is a state of happiness. Again, happiness is just one type of emotion. Emotions vary widely, so D is too specific and doesn't describe the general idea.

Option E says emotion is a complex state characterized by heightened arousal, defined by feelings, responses, and motivation. This seems to fit. It's talking about emotion being a complex thing that involves feelings, how people respond, and the motivation behind the emotion. It's a comprehensive definition considering all three aspects.

Option F says emotion is an involuntary physical reaction unrelated to feelings or motivation. No, that's the opposite of what emotions are. Emotions are internal and tied to feelings, not physical reactions on their own.

Option G suggests emotion is a long-lasting mood that doesn't have a clear trigger. That's a bit vague, but it's related to the idea that emotions are sustained, which is a characteristic of emotions.

Option H says emotion is a physiological response to cognitive judgments. That sounds more about how emotions are felt, perhaps more about the physical response, not the definition.

Option I says emotion is a transient social construct varying across cultures. That's also about emotions being temporary and influenced by context, which is part of emotions, but the question is about the definition in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation.

Option J says emotion is a state of sadness. Another specific term, similar to A.

So, analyzing each, E and G are the closest. Let me reconsider. The question specifies defining emotion in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. Option E mentions all three: feelings, responses, and motivation. That aligns perfectly with the definition provided.

Option G also talks about emotions being long-lasting and unrelated to external cause, which is a characteristic but perhaps not the complete definition. E is more about the structure of emotions as a complex state.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.

The correct answer is:

**E: Emotion is a complex state characterized by heightened arousal level, defined in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation.**

This option effectively captures the definition of emotion by including all three elements mentioned in the question.
