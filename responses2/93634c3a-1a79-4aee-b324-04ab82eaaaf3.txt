Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the arc length of the function y = x⁻¹ over the interval [1, 2] using Simpson's Rule S₈. Hmm, Simpson's Rule, right. I remember it's a method for approximating integrals, especially when dealing with curves. 

First, I think I should recall the formula for the arc length of a function. Oh yeah, the formula is the integral from a to b of sqrt(1 + (f'(x))²) dx. So for y = x⁻¹, the derivative f'(x) is -1/x². That makes (f'(x))² equal to 1/x⁴. So the integrand becomes sqrt(1 + 1/x⁴).

Wait, right, so the integral we're trying to compute is ∫ from 1 to 2 of sqrt(1 + 1/x⁴) dx. And we're using Simpson's Rule with n=8, which is an even number, so it should work.

Simpson's Rule formula is S_n = (Δx/3) [f(x₀) + 4f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + 4f(x₃) + ... + 4f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n)], where Δx is (b - a)/n. Since n is 8 here, Δx is (2-1)/8 = 1/8 = 0.125.

So, let me list out the x values from 1 to 2 in increments of 0.125. That would be x₀=1, x₁=1.125, x₂=1.25, x₃=1.375, x₄=1.5, x₅=1.625, x₆=1.75, x₇=1.875, x₈=2.0.

Now, I need to compute f(x_i) for each i, where f(x) is sqrt(1 + 1/x⁴). Let me calculate each f(x_i):

1. x₀=1: f(1) = sqrt(1 + 1/1) = sqrt(2) ≈1.4142
2. x₁=1.125: f(1.125) = sqrt(1 + 1/(1.125)^4). Let me compute 1.125^4. 1.125 squared is 1.265625, squared again is about 1.601806640625. So 1/1.60180664 ≈0.6243. So 1 + 0.6243 = 1.6243. sqrt(1.6243) ≈1.2748.

3. x₂=1.25: 1.25^4 is (5/4)^4 = 625/256 ≈2.4414. So 1/2.4414 ≈0.4096. 1 + 0.4096=1.4096. sqrt(1.4096)=1.1875.

4. x₃=1.375: Let's see, 1.375 is 11/8. 11/8 to the fourth power is (14641)/(4096) ≈3.561. So 1/3.561 ≈0.2809. 1+0.2809=1.2809. sqrt is approx 1.1317.

5. x₄=1.5: 1.5^4 = (3/2)^4 = 81/16=5.0625. So 1/5.0625≈0.1975. 1+0.1975=1.1975. sqrt is about 1.0945.

6. x₅=1.625: 1.625 is 13/8. (13/8)^4 = (28561)/(4096) ≈6.9727. 1/6.9727 ≈0.1434. 1+0.1434=1.1434. sqrt is approx 1.069.

7. x₆=1.75: 1.75 is 7/4. (7/4)^4= (2401/256) ≈9.3789. 1/9.3789≈0.1065. 1+0.1065=1.1065. sqrt is approx 1.0517.

8. x₇=1.875: 1.875 is 15/8. (15/8)^4= (50625)/(4096)≈12.3596. 1/12.3596≈0.0809. 1 + 0.0809=1.0809. sqrt is about 1.040.

9. x₈=2: 2^4=16, so 1/16=0.0625. 1+0.0625=1.0625. sqrt is 1.031.

Now, applying Simpson's coefficients:

The pattern is 1,4,2,4,2,4,2,4,1.

So for each i from 0 to 8, the coefficients are [1,4,2,4,2,4,2,4,1].

So the sum is:

f(x₀)*1 + f(x₁)*4 + f(x₂)*2 + f(x₃)*4 + f(x₄)*2 + f(x₅)*4 + f(x₆)*2 + f(x₇)*4 + f(x₈)*1.

So let's compute each term:

1 * f(x₀) = 1 * 1.4142 =1.4142

4 * f(x₁)=4 * 1.2748=5.0992

2 * f(x₂)=2 *1.1875=2.375

4 * f(x₃)=4 * 1.1317=4.5268

2 * f(x₄)=2 *1.0945=2.189

4 * f(x₅)=4 *1.069=4.276

2 * f(x₆)=2 *1.0517=2.1034

4 * f(x₇)=4 *1.040=4.16

1 * f(x₈)=1 *1.031=1.031

Now, sum them all up:

Let me add step by step.

Start with 1.4142.

Add 5.0992: total 6.5134.

Add 2.375: 8.8884.

Add 4.5268: 13.4152.

Add 2.189: 15.6042.

Add 4.276: 19.8802.

Add 2.1034: 21.9836.

Add 4.16: 26.1436.

Add 1.031: 27.1746.

So the sum inside the parentheses is approximately 27.1746.

Then, multiply by Δx/3. Δx is 0.125. So 0.125 /3 is approximately 0.0416667.

So, total S_8 = 0.0416667 * 27.1746 ≈ let's compute that.

27.1746 * 0.0416667.

Well, 27 * 0.04 is 1.08, and 0.1746 *0.04 is about 0.007, so total around 1.087. But let's compute more accurately.

0.0416667 is 1/24, approximately.

So 27.1746 /24 = let's compute 27 /24 = 1.125, and 0.1746/24 ≈0.007275. So total is approx 1.1323.

Wait, 24 * 1.1323 = 27.1752, which is close to 27.1746. So perhaps the exact calculation is 27.1746 * (1/24) = 27.1746 /24 ≈1.132275.

So approximately 1.1323.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.132, which is very close. So the answer should be E.

To find the arc length of y = x⁻¹ over [1,2] using Simpson's Rule S₈, we first note that the integrand is √(1 + 1/x⁴). Simpson's Rule formula is applied with n=8, giving Δx=0.125. Evaluating the function at each x_i and applying the coefficients [1,4,2,4,2,4,2,4,1], the sum is approximately 27.1746. Multiplying by Δx/3 (≈0.0416667) yields S₈ ≈1.132. 

Answer: E: 1.132
