Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the body's stress response system. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the options carefully.

The question is asking about what the stress response system does. The options are A to J, each making a different claim about how the body handles stress.

Option A says the stress response can be permanently damaged if a traumatic event happens. I remember that stress response systems are part of the body's natural defenses. Trauma can cause immediate damage, but I don't think it's permanent. It probably recovers over time. So A might be wrong.

Option B claims it's mainly regulated by SSRIs. Hmm, I know that drugs like SSRIs inhibit neurotransmitters to reduce stress. But is the stress response mainly regulated by medications or by the body's own mechanisms? I'm not sure, but I think the body has other ways too, like the hypothalamus and pituitary gland releasing hormones.

Option C states it only affects physical health, not mental or emotional. That doesn't sound right. I think the stress response is integral to mental and emotional health. Without it, many functions might be compromised.

Option D says it's not linked to mental health disorders. That's the opposite of what I remember. Stress definitely leads to mental health issues, so D is probably incorrect.

Option E says the system is fully developed and functional at birth. Wait, the stress response is part of the body's natural defenses. It's present from birth, but is it fully developed? I think it's continuously working, so maybe E is correct. But I'm not certain.

Option F suggests it can impact genetic predispositions. I don't recall any genetic factors directly influencing the body's stress response. Stress is more about the environment and individual factors, not genetics.

Option G claims it's only active during extreme stress. No, I remember that the stress response is more about normal stress and can handle mild stress too. It's not limited to extreme events.

Option H says it's controlled through meditation and yoga. That's a lifestyle choice, not a biological system. The body has its own mechanisms, so H is probably not correct.

Option I says it's vulnerable to influence during childhood but not later. I'm not sure about this. I think stress can vary by environment, but the body's system is more stable. Maybe I'm confusing it with something like hormones, which can be influenced more by external factors.

Option J says it can't be affected by outside influences. That makes no sense. External factors like trauma, genetics, or environment all influence the body's response. So J is incorrect.

Now, going back to the options, the correct statement must be option E. The stress response is indeed developed and functional at birth, but it's continuously active and plays a role in the body's homeostasis and overall health. So the body's system is functional, not permanently damaged even with trauma. Trauma can lead to initial damage but the system recovers, so option A is wrong. E seems correct.

The body's stress response system is best described as option E: Is fully developed and functional at birth, with no changes occurring in later life. This is because the stress response is part of the body's natural defenses, continuously active and integral to physical and mental health. Trauma can cause initial damage but typically recovers over time. Other options, such as A, B, C, D, F, G, H, and I, either describe incorrect mechanisms, genetic factors, lifestyle influences, or systems that are not integral to the body's stress response. 

**Answer: E**
