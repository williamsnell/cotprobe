Okay, so I've got this question about the scientific characteristics of psychology. Hmm, let me think. I remember that psychology is a field that studies behavior and mental processes, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specific characteristics.

The question gives me options A through J, each a statement about what makes psychology scientific. I need to pick which one is correct. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it's a natural science focusing on inanimate objects. Wait, I thought psychology deals with animate stuff. Like, studying human behavior through observation and thinking. So A sounds wrong because it's not natural science; it's more empirical, I think.

Option B claims it's based on intuition and opinion. Yeah, that makes sense. People often rely on feelings or intuitions in their judgments, so B might be correct.

Option C: "Psychology is not empirical." Wait, that doesn't sound right. If something is empirical, it's based on observation and experimentation. So if C says it's not empirical, that's incorrect. So C is wrong.

Option D: "Empirical, systematic, and uses measurement." Oh, I remember that psychology does use a lot of measurement techniques, like questionnaires and behavioral assays. It's also systematic in its research methods, so D sounds correct.

Option E: "Uses random observation without systematic methods or replication." That doesn't fit. I've heard that psychology uses systematic methods and replication is standard in scientific research. So E is wrong.

Option F: "Studes only groups, ignores individual differences." I'm not sure about this. I think psychology does consider individual differences, like personality traits. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "Only animal behavior, no humans." No, that's not true. Psychology is about humans too. So G is wrong.

Option H: "Relies solely on theory without experimentation." No, experiments are part of the scientific method. So H is incorrect.

Option I: "Pseudoscience, can't predict or be falsified." I don't think that's accurate. Psychology does have methods, like experimental designs, and it can make predictions. So I is wrong.

Option J: "No measurement." That's not true because measurement is a key part of psychological research. So J is incorrect.

So looking back at the options, the correct statements are B and D. But the question says "List and describe the scientific characteristics," implying multiple correct points. Wait, let me read the options again. The question gives a single correct answer, so which one is the best choice.

Wait, the question says, "List and describe the scientific characteristics of psychology." So each option is a statement about psychology. So which options are correct?

Looking again:

A: Incorrect, as it's not a natural science. It's empirical.

B: Correct, as psychology is based on intuition and opinion.

D: Correct, as it is empirical, systematic, and uses measurement.

Wait, but the options are each statements. The question is asking which of the statements are correct about the characteristics. So the question is, which of the statements A to J are correct and the answer must be the correct option(s).

Wait, the options are each statements. So the question is, for each statement, which is correct.

Wait, the user's question says, "List and describe the scientific characteristics of psychology." So the possible answers are statements A to J, and the correct answer must be the correct statement(s).

Wait, but looking back, the question is asking which of the statements (A to J) is correct. So each statement is a possible answer, and the options are A to J, each a statement. So each option is a statement that might be correct.

Wait, I think I need to evaluate each statement as correct or incorrect.

A: Incorrect. It's not a natural science; it's empirical.

B: Correct. Psychology is based on intuition and opinion.

C: Incorrect. It's empirical.

D: Correct. It's empirical, systematic, and measures.

E: Incorrect. Uses systematic methods.

F: Incorrect. Studies individual differences.

G: Incorrect. Includes humans.

H: Incorrect. Relies on experimentation.

I: Incorrect. Uses experiments.

J: Incorrect. Measures exists.

So the correct statements are B and D. But each option is a separate statement. So the question is asking which statements are correct among A through J.

Wait, but the question is presented as "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So it's a single letter, the correct one.

Looking at the options:

Which of the following is a correct statement about psychological characteristics.

So the options are A to J, each a statement. So the correct answers would be the ones that are correct. So B and D are correct.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says "List and describe the scientific characteristics of psychology." So perhaps the correct answers are multiple options, but in the given options, each is a separate statement. So the correct answer is the statement (like B or D) which is correct.

But the question is presented as a multiple-choice question where each option is a possible answer. So the correct answer is the correct statement(s). Wait, but in the format, the user expects one letter as the answer.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, the question is: "List and describe the scientific characteristics of psychology." So the options are statements, each claiming a characteristic.

So the correct statements are B and D. But the options are separate, so the answer would be the option that is correct. So the possible correct options are B and D.

But the question is, in the options, each is a statement. So the question is, which of the statements (A to J) is a correct statement about psychology's scientific characteristics.

So the correct answer is B and D. But since the options are lettered, the correct answer is either B or D.

Wait, but the options are separate; the question is a multiple-choice, each option A-J is a possible answer. So which of the statements is correct.

Wait, but in the choices, each option is a possible statement, so the correct answer would be either B or D. But the options are presented as separate. So the correct answer is the letter that corresponds to the correct statement.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's see. The question is about the characteristics of psychology. So the correct answer is B and D, but since in the options, each is a separate statement, the correct answer is the correct statement(s).

Wait, the user is presenting the multiple-choice options, each as a statement. So the correct answer is the correct statement(s). But the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. It says, "List and describe the scientific characteristics of psychology." So the correct answer would be multiple statements, but in the options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, but the user has presented the options as A to J, each being a statement, and the question is asking which of these statements are correct.

So, the correct answer is the correct statement(s). So the question is which statements (A-J) are correct.

In that case, the correct statements are B and D.

Wait, but the user's options are:

A: Incorrect.

B: Correct.

C: Incorrect.

D: Correct.

E: Incorrect.

F: Incorrect.

G: Incorrect.

H: Incorrect.

I: Incorrect.

J: Incorrect.

So the correct options are B and D.

But the way the question is phrased is: "Which of the following statements (A-J) is correct..." So the answer would be both B and D.

Wait, but looking at the options, the letters are A through J. So the correct answer is B and D. So in the options, for each statement, which is correct.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. But according to the way the options are presented, the correct statements are B and D. So the possible correct answers would be B and D.

Wait, but the question is, which is a correct statement about the characteristics of psychology. So the correct options are B and D. But the way the options are presented, each is a separate possibility. So the answer is either B or D.

Wait, but the way the user presented the question, each option is a possible answer. So the user is asking which of the statements (A-J) is correct.

So the correct options are B and D, meaning that both statements are correct.

But that can't be the case because the question says "List and describe the scientific characteristics...", implying multiple correct points, but the options are A-J, each a single statement.

So perhaps the intended correct answer is B and D.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct statements are B and D. So perhaps the correct answers are both B and D.

But the way the multiple-choice is set up, each option is a possible answer, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and D. But in that case, the options don't present that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. The question is about the scientific characteristics. So psychological characteristics include empirical methods, systematic approaches, etc.

Option D says psychology is empirical, systematic, and uses measurement techniques. That aligns with what I remember.

Option B says it's based on intuition and opinion. That's correct too.

So the correct statements are B and D.

But the options are presented as separate, so the correct answers are B and D.

So in the multiple-choice options, the correct answers are B and D. But since the question is presented as a single correct answer, perhaps I'm to choose the best option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Wait, maybe I should reevaluate.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are each a statement. So the question is asking which statement is correct.

So which of the statements (A to J) is correct about psychological characteristics. So the correct statements are B and D.

But the options are presented as separate, so the correct answer would be both B and D.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, perhaps it's a single correct answer. So perhaps the intended correct answer is D.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options again.

The question is, "List and describe the scientific characteristics of psychology."

So the correct statements would include B and D.

But the way the options are presented, each is a possible answer. So the correct options are the statements that are correct.

So the possible correct options are B and D.

But the user's question is asking which of the options (A-J) is correct. So the correct answer is either B or D.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is both B and D, but the options are presented as A to J, each being a single option. So the correct answers would be both B and D, but in the given options, each is a separate choice, so perhaps in the test, the options would have multiple correct answers as a group, but here it's a single-choice.

Wait, but the user's question is a single-choice question. So perhaps only one is correct. So I must have made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about each option.

Option D: "Empirical, systematic, and employs measurement techniques." That's correct. I've heard that psychology is empirical, and uses measurement.

Option B: "Based on intuition and opinion." That's also correct. So both B and D are correct.

But the options are separate, so the correct answers are B and D.

But the way the user presents it as a multiple-choice, perhaps they expect only D as correct, but that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only looking for one correct statement, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about all characteristics, but the key ones. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the question says, "List and describe the scientific characteristics of psychology." So perhaps multiple correct statements are present, but each option is a separate statement, so the correct answers would be B and D.

But in the options, each is a separate statement, so the correct answer (as a single letter) would be either B or D.

Wait, but this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the intended correct answer is D, because it's a more comprehensive statement about psychology.

Alternatively, maybe B is correct, but not the best option.

Wait, perhaps the question is intended to select both B and D, but the options don't allow that, so perhaps the best way is to pick D, as it's a more general statement about psychology's scientific nature.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option's correctness again.

Option A: "Psychology is a natural science that focuses on the study of inanimate objects." No, it's empirical.

Option B: "Psychology is based on intuition and opinion." Yes, correct.

Option C: "Not empirical." No, it's empirical.

Option D: "Empirical, systematic, and uses measurement." Yes, correct.

Option E: "Uses random methods without systematic." No, systematic methods are used.

Option F: "Only groups, ignores individual differences." No, individual differences are important.

Option G: "Only animal behavior." No, humans are studied.

Option H: "Relies solely on theory." No, experiments and measurement are used.

Option I: "Pseudoscience." No, it's empirical.

Option J: "No measurement techniques." No, they do use measurement.

So the correct statements are B and D. But since each is a separate option, the correct answer would be both B and D. However, in the given options, each is a single letter, so perhaps the intended correct answer is D.

Wait, but the user's question is likely designed to have only one correct option, so perhaps B is the intended answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the characteristics more. What do I remember? Psychology is empirical, uses measurement, and relies on systematic methods. So D is correct. B is also correct, but perhaps the question is more focused on the empirical aspect.

Hmm, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Since the options are separate, and each is a statement, the correct answers are B and D. But the user is asking for a single letter.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting all correct statements, but the options are not structured that way. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But given that, perhaps the intended correct answer is B and D. But the options are single letters, so I might have to choose the one that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is B and D. But maybe the user made a mistake and expects only one correct statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, as it's a more comprehensive and accurate statement about the nature of psychology.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. The options A to J are statements about psychology's characteristics. The correct options are B and D. But since the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps the correct answer is both B and D, but that's not possible as the options are single letter.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option B. Let me think again. Does psychology really rely on intuition and opinion? I thought that psychology does, as it's about human behavior, which requires personal judgment.

Yes, so B is correct.

So the correct answers are B and D. But since the options are single letters, perhaps there's a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting only one correct answer, and the correct option is D, which is a more encompassing statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects only one correct answer, and B is correct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but I think the user's question is likely designed to have only one correct option, and the intended correct answer is B. Because the question is about the characteristics, not the method.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating options.

Wait, another angle: the question says "List and describe the scientific characteristics of psychology." So perhaps the correct answer includes more than one statement, but in the options, each is a separate statement. So the correct options are B and D. But the user expects a single letter, perhaps the intended correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not confident. I think I'll go with D as the correct answer.

The question asks about the scientific characteristics of psychology, with multiple-choice options. Each option is a statement, and the task is to identify the correct ones. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Psychology is empirical, not a natural science.  
- **Option B**: Correct. Psychology is based on intuition and opinion.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Psychology is empirical.  
- **Option D**: Correct. Psychology is empirical, systematic, and uses measurement techniques.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Psychology uses systematic methods.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Psychology studies both groups and individuals.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Psychology studies humans.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Psychology relies on experimentation.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Psychology uses experiments.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Psychology uses measurement techniques.

Both **B** and **D** are correct. However, since the question requires selecting a single letter, **D** is the more comprehensive and accurate statement about the characteristics of psychology. 

ANSWER: D
