Question:

You and three friends go to a concert. The total cost for four tickets is $112. Write and solve an equation to find the cost of one ticket t.

Options:

A: 4 - t = 112; -$108
B: 4t = 112; $28
C: t over 4 = 112; $448
D: t + 4 = 112; $108
E: t over 4 = 112; $28
F: 4t - 112 = 0; $448
G: 4t = 112; $448
H: t/112 = 4; $0.0357
I: 112t = 4; $44800
J: t - 4 = 112; $116

Okay, so I've got this problem where four friends go to a concert and the total cost for the tickets is $112. I need to figure out the cost of one ticket. Hmm, let's think about how to set up an equation for this.

First, let's denote the cost of one ticket as 't'. Since there are four friends, each buying a ticket, the total cost would be four times the price of one ticket. So mathematically, that would be 4 multiplied by t. 

So, the equation should be 4t equals $112. Let me write that down: 4t = 112. That makes sense because each of the four tickets is t dollars, so adding them all together gives 4t.

Now I need to solve for t. To isolate t, I should divide both sides of the equation by 4. So, t = 112 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation. 112 รท 4 equals 28. So each ticket costs $28.

Looking at the options, I need to find an equation that correctly represents this situation and gives the right solution. Let's check each option.

Option B is 4t = 112, which is exactly what I came up with, and solving it gives $28. That seems correct. Option G is the same equation, so that's definitely the right choice.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's look at the other options. 

Option D is t + 4 = 112, which would imply each ticket plus 4 equals 112, but that doesn't fit the context. The problem says the total is 112, not the sum including four. So D is incorrect.

Option A subtracts t and sets it to 112, which doesn't make sense because subtracting costs wouldn't equal the total. Similarly, option C divides t by 4 and sets it to 112, which would imply t is 448, but that's not the case because 4 tickets at 448 each would be way over $112.

Option E is t/4 = 112, which would mean each ticket is 112 divided by 4, which is 28. Wait, but that's the same as option B. So E is also correct. So wait, I thought B was the right answer, but E is also correct. Hmm.

Wait no, that can't be. Let me think again. If E is t/4 = 112, then multiplying both sides by 4 gives t=448, which is way more than the total. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating E. Let me re-examine E.

Wait, the equation in E is t/4 = 112. So solving for t would give t = 112 * 4 = 448. But the total is $112, so that would mean each ticket is $448, which is not correct. Because four tickets at $448 each would be $1792. So that's not right. So E can't be correct. Hmm, but option B is correct. So why is E an option?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. Oh, wait, the problem says the total cost is $112. So E's equation would lead to t=448. That's impossible. So E doesn't make sense. So my initial thought was correct: B is the correct equation.

Now, looking at the options, I need to pick the correct equation and the correct answer. B is the equation 4t=112, which gives t=28. That's correct. So the right answer is option B.
</think>

The total cost for four tickets is $112, so the equation to find the cost of one ticket t is 4t = 112. Solving for t gives t = $28.

Answer: B: 4t = 112; $28
