Okay, so I have this economics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the income velocity of money. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states: If 1964 GNP equals $622 billion and the average money supply was $155 billion, what was the income velocity of money? The options are labeled A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember that the income velocity of money is calculated using the formula: Velocity = Nominal GDP / Money Supply. So, Velocity equals GNP divided by the money supply.

Wait, but waitâ€”what are the units here? GNP is in billions, and the money supply is also in billions. So the formula should be straightforward.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula is Velocity (V) = Nominal GDP (G) divided by Money Supply (M). So V = G / M.

In this case, G is $622 billion and M is $155 billion. But wait, do I need to consider the time period? Oh, the question specifies 1964 GNP. So the formula should be applicable here.

So plugging in the numbers: V = 622 / 155.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 622 divided by 155. Let me do the division.

155 * 4 = 620. So 155 * 4.0 is 620. So 622 is 2 more than 620. So 2/155 is approximately 0.0129. So 4.0 + 0.0129 = 4.0129.

So the velocity is approximately 4.0129 times. Let me look at the options.

Option C is 4.0129 times. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up any formulas. Another thought: sometimes, the velocity is calculated using nominal GDP divided by real GDP, but that's not what this question is asking. Oh wait, no, the question is about income velocity of money, which is indeed G/N. So that's correct.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the income velocity of money, we use the formula:

{eq}V = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Money Supply}}.

Given:
- 1964 GNP = $622 billion
- Money Supply = $155 billion

Plugging in the numbers:

{eq}V = \frac{622}{155} \approx 4.0129.

Comparing this to the options, the closest match is option C: 4.0129 times.

Answer: C
