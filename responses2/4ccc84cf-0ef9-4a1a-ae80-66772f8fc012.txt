Question:

Which of the following executive orders will most likely be found unconstitutional?

Options:

A: The President issued an executive order instructing all executive branch employees to refrain from using social media during working hours.
B: The President issued an executive order banning all forms of meat consumption within the premises of the executive building, citing health reasons and environmental concerns.
C: The President issued an executive order abolishing a federal agency that was established by an Act of Congress, citing redundancy and inefficiency.
D: In 1887, Congress passed a law establishing a federal Commission of Birdwatchers. The Commission, which is still in effect, consists of seven members who are appointed by the President. The Commission's main function is to go on periodic retreats to photograph and study North American birds and their migratory habits. Believing that the Commission is archaic, the President decides that any future funding will simply be a waste of money. He thus executes an executive decree abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers.
E: Without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, the President issued an executive order to establish a new federal agency to oversee the operations of all other federal agencies.
F: The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to use exclusively one brand of ballpoint pens and pencils as their writing utensils. According to a study, the federal government could save in excess of $250,000 a year in office supply costs if all executive agencies were to use standardized pens and pencils.
G: The President issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency in a city dealing with civil unrest, and authorizes the use of military force without the approval of Congress.
H: The President issued an executive order mandating all executive branch employees to take a mandatory vacation for a period of one month.
I: The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during regular working hours. According to the President's directive, executive employees are prohibited from wearing colored (e. g. , blue or yellow) or striped shirts and blouses while on duty. The President issued the order in an effort to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees.
J: A devastating hurricane damages an island which is part of a foreign country. The storm destroys many homes, resulting in death and injury to thousands. In response to a request from the foreign government for emergency aid, the President, without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, issues an executive decree authorizing U. S. Army troops to the island to provide medical and humanitarian assistance.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about executive orders and their unconstitutional nature. Let's see what I remember about executive orders and what makes them constitutional or not. I think there are some key principles that determine that an executive order is lawfully permissible or not.

First, I remember something about executive orders being non-binding except when they're overridden by legislation. But that's more about laws than about whether the order is constitutional. Wait, no—the question is about constitutional issues, so probably about whether the order is allowed by the Constitution or if it's unconstitutional for some reason.

I recall that executive orders are usually not subject to the same checks as legislative ones because they're made by the executive branch. But if the order is a violation of the Constitution, like infringing on someone's rights or creating a conflict of interest, it might be unconstitutional.

Looking at the options, each is a different scenario. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The President orders all employees not to use social media during working hours. Social media usage is generally a public concern, but the President's directive is likely within the scope of executive powers. I think this might be constitutional because it's a public policy, and the President can issue it unless it's a violation of due process or another constitutional right.

Option B: The President bans meat consumption, citing health and environmental reasons. Banning certain foods is generally allowed, but the context is within the executive branch. Since it's a federal action, it's probably constitutional under the First Amendment, specifically the Establishment Clause, because it's a form of government action. So B might be constitutional.

Option C: The President abolishes a federal agency. This is a significant administrative action. The Constitution allows the President to make changes to federal agencies, but if it's a pure abolition without any underlying issues, it might be unconstitutional. However, abolishing a redundant agency is a significant change, so maybe it's constitutional. Alternatively, if the agency was for a specific purpose that couldn't be replaced, but in this case, it's a pure abolition, so I'm not sure. It might be constitutional because the President has the authority to abolish federal agencies, but it could depend on the nature of the change.

Option D: The President abrogates the Commission of Birdwatchers. This is a federal law established by Congress. The President's action is a violation of the law because he's abrogating it. But wait, the Commission is established by Congress, so the President's decision to abrogate it could be a constitutional violation of the law, especially if it's an enforcement of prior law. But wait, the wording says the President decides to abrogate it. That's a violation because the law was passed by Congress, so the President can't simply abrogate it without the consent of Congress. So this would likely be unconstitutional because it's a violation of the law. But wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Wait, the question is about what's unconstitutional. So if the President is violating the law by abrogating it, that could be a problem. So this option is likely unconstitutional.

Option E: The President issues an order to establish a new federal agency to oversee other federal agencies. This seems like it might be a violation of the Constitution's power of the purse. The purse power allows the President to spend money without the legislative approval, but the change here is from a federal agency to another, which could be a misuse of purse power. Wait, but the purse power is about when the money is spent. So if the President is using the money to establish a new agency, that's a violation because the money was already spent. So this would be unconstitutional, as it violates the purse power. Alternatively, I'm not so sure. The purse power allows spending without legislative approval, which is allowed. So if the President is using the money to create a new agency, that's the purse power being violated. So this would be a problem and thus unconstitutional.

Option F: All employees use a single pen brand. That's probably constitutional because it's a standardization of a writing tool, which is a public policy. The federal government can regulate such things, so F is likely constitutional.

Option G: The President declares a state of emergency and authorizes military force. This is a significant use of force, but it's within the scope of the executive branch. However, the use of force without the consent of Congress is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, specifically the Due Process clause. So G would be unconstitutional because it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Option H: All employees must wear white shirts and blouses during working hours. This seems like it's enforcing a dress code. The dress code is a public policy, so the President's directive is constitutional because the Executive branch can enforce such policies. So H is likely constitutional.

Option I: The President mandates employees to wear only white during working hours. This is similar to G but without the emergency. It's a public policy, so it's constitutional, because the President can issue such orders. So I is likely constitutional.

Option J: A hurricane damages an island, and the President issues a decree to U.S. Army to help. This is a federal law, and it's a specific action taken by the President. This is constitutional because the President can make laws, even specific ones. So J is likely constitutional.

Now, to summarize:

The options that are likely unconstitutional are options D, E, and G.

Wait, let me re-examine each:

D: Abrogate the law. Since it's a federal law, the President can't go after it without Congress's consent. So this is a constitutional issue. But the question is about which is most likely unconstitutional. Since the President is making a law, it's likely to be unconstitutional because he can't modify a law under the Constitution.

E: Creating a new agency. If the money was already spent, that's a violation of the purse power. The purse power allows the President to spend money without Congress's approval, but creating a new agency is a use of that money, which would violate the purse power. So E is likely unconstitutional.

G: Declaring a state of emergency. The emergency is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. So G is unconstitutional.

So D, E, G are likely to be unconstitutional.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the question is asking which one will most likely be found unconstitutional. So the options are individual scenarios, each with a possible constitutional issue.

So the options that are unconstitutional are D, E, and G.

Wait, but the question is about which is most likely, so perhaps the most problematic one. Let me think about each.

D: Abrogating a law. This is a violation of the law, so definitely unconstitutional.

E: Using purse power. The President is using the money, so that's a violation. Also, establishing a new agency for federal oversight could be a misuse of the purse power.

G: Declaring a state of emergency. That's a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Also, the use of force without Congress approval is a violation. So G is a double violation.

So which is more likely to be unconstitutional? The question is which will most likely be found unconstitutional.

So, which among D, E, G is more likely to be an unconstitutional executive order.

Looking back, the options are all possible scenarios, so the answer could be any of these. But I think the answer is G, D, or E.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each one's nature.

Option D: Abrogating the law. Since the law is established by Congress, and the President can't modify it without Congress's permission, this is a constitutional violation.

Option E: Creating a new agency. This is a violation of the purse power because the money was already spent. So the President is spending money to create a new agency, which is a misuse of the purse power. This is a constitutional violation.

Option G: Declaring a state of emergency. This is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. So G is a violation.

So all three D, E, and G are constitutional issues. But the question is which is most likely to be found unconstitutional.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following executive orders will most likely be found unconstitutional." So we need to pick the most likely.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D, E, or G. But the question is, which is the most likely.

Looking at the options:

D: Abrogate a federal law.

E: Exploit the purse power.

G: Violate due process.

So the most likely are D, E, and G. But perhaps the answer is E. Because the creation of a new agency could be a misuse of the purse power, which is a significant violation. Alternatively, D is a violation of the law.

Wait, perhaps E is more problematic because it's about using the money to create something that could be a violation of the purse power.

Another angle: The Fourteenth Amendment says a president cannot use force without the consent of Congress. So if the President is using the purse money to establish a new agency, that's a violation. So E is definitely a violation.

Option D: The President is making a law Change, which is a constitutional violation because the President can modify a law.

Option G: Declaring a state of emergency is a constitutional violation because it's an exercise of power without the consent of Congress.

So all three D, E, G are constitutional issues.

Wait, but the question is about which executive order is most likely to be found unconstitutional. So perhaps the answer is E. Because the use of the purse power is a more significant issue.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a violation, but the law is a federal law; the President can't modify it.

Wait, but the president can modify a federal law, as he can use the purse power. So D would not be a problem. So E is a problem because it's a misuse of the purse power.

So the options D, E, G are all constitutional issues.

Wait, but the question is which is most likely. So perhaps E is the most likely because it's a violation of the purse power, which is a significant violation.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a possible violation because it's modifying a law.

Wait, but the law is a federal law, and the president can modify it. So D is not a violation.

So the options that are constitutional are E, G.

Wait, but the question is about the most likely. So perhaps E is the answer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The options are about what executive orders are likely to be unconstitutional.

The possible constitutional issues are:

D: Abrogate a federal law (constitutional violation, because the president can modify a federal law).

E: Creating a new agency using the money (vague but possible constitutional violation under purse power).

G: Declaring a state of emergency and using force (constitutional violation under the Fourth Amendment).

So all three are likely to be unconstitutional.

But the question is asking which is most likely. So perhaps the answer is E, because creating a new agency is a significant use of money, whereas the others are less so.

Alternatively, perhaps G is the most likely.

Wait, I think the answer is E and G, but I'm supposed to choose one. The question is from a multiple-choice, so perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, but the options are individual options. So the question is, which of the following is most likely to be unconstitutional.

So the options are:

D, E, G are all possible.

But the question is, which is most likely. So perhaps E is the answer because the use of the purse power is a bigger issue than the constitutional modification of a law.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a constitutional issue, but the president is making a law change. So that's a constitutional violation because he can modify a federal law.

So all options D, E, and G are constitutional issues.

But the question is which one is most likely. So perhaps E is the answer because the use of the purse power is a more significant issue.

Alternatively, maybe G is the answer because declaring a state of emergency is a constitutional violation.

Wait, so perhaps I should look for which option is the classic constitutional violation.

The classic constitutional violation is when the President uses the purse power to spend money without Congress's consent—option E.

Option G is a constitutional violation under the Fourth Amendment, but it's more about the use of force than the purse power.

So the most likely is E because it's a violation of the purse power.

To determine which executive order is most likely unconstitutional, we analyze each option based on constitutional principles:

### Option A:
The President instructs employees to refrain from using social media during working hours. This is a public policy, and the President has the authority to issue such directives. It is constitutional.

### Option B:
The President bans meat consumption, citing health and environmental concerns. Banning certain foods is generally allowed under the Establishment Clause. This is constitutional.

### Option C:
The President abolishes a federal agency. While this is a significant change, it is likely constitutional because the President has the authority to abolish federal agencies. 

### Option D:
The President abrogates a federal law. Since the law was passed by Congress, the President cannot modify it without Congress's consent. This is a constitutional violation.

### Option E:
The President establishes a new federal agency to oversee other federal agencies. This violates the purse power, as the money was already spent. Establishing a new agency is a misuse of purse power, making this a constitutional violation.

### Option F:
All employees use a single pen brand. This is a standardization of a public policy, which is constitutional.

### Option G:
The President declares a state of emergency and authorizes military force. This violates the Fourth Amendment, specifically the Due Process clause, as it violates the Fourth Amendment rights. This is a constitutional violation.

### Option H:
The President imposes a dress code. This is a public policy, which is constitutional.

### Option I:
The President mandates employees to wear only white during working hours. Similar to G, this is a constitutional violation.

### Option J:
The President authorizes U.S. Army troops to help a hurricane-struck island. This is a federal law, and the President can make such laws. It is constitutional.

### Conclusion:
The most likely unconstitutional executive orders are **E** (vague use of purse power), **G** (constitutional violation under the Fourth Amendment), and **D** (constitutional violation by modifying a federal law). However, **E** is the most problematic due to its reliance on the purse power, which is a significant constitutional violation. 

**ANSWER: E**
