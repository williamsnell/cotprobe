Question:

One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the father did not retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege.
B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.
C: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.
D: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.
E: admissible, because the lawsuit makes all previous communications related to the case public.
F: admissible, because the boy was not the attorney's client, only the father was.
G: admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.
H: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.
I: inadmissible, because the consultation was preliminary and does not constitute a formal attorney-client relationship.
J: inadmissible, because the boy is a minor and cannot legally waive his rights to attorney-client privilege.

Okay, so I've got this question about whether something is admissible in court. Let me try to break it down. The situation is about a pilot who ran out of gas and had an accident. The pilot crossed into a neighboring state, and a 9-year-old boy was walking to school and was hit by an object from the plane. The father of the boy is suing the pilot for his son's injuries. The father didn't retain an attorney to represent his son, but instead, he hired another lawyer. At trial, the pilot's attorney called the consulting attorney who testified about the boy's physical condition during a consultation with him and his father.

The question is whether the statement given by the child is admissible. The options are A through J, each offering different reasons for admissibility or inadmissibility.

First, I need to recall the basic principle of the attorney-client privilege. It's a fundamental right that states you can't give your attorney's client any privileged information. The privilege is about confidentiality, and it's not about the type of information given. So, the key here is whether the child's statement was made for the purpose of medical treatment or not. If it was made for that purpose, it's not privileged. If it wasn't, then it's admissible.

The child in question is a 9-year-old, so he's a minor. Minors have certain protections, including the right to not be represented by an attorney unless he's the client. But wait, the question says the father didn't retain an attorney but hired another. So, was the child the client? The father is the one suing, so the child is the client. The father is the attorney. So, the child is the client.

Wait, but the father didn't retain an attorney to represent his son, but he did hire another. So, the child is the client, and the father is the attorney. So, the statement was made by the child for his own understanding, perhaps for medical purposes. But wait, the child is a minor, so he might not have the right to represent himself.

Wait, no. The issue is whether the child's statement was made for the purpose of getting medical treatment. So, the child's attorney (the father) is trying to get the child to give testimony about his own health. But the child is a minor, so he can't represent himself unless he's the client. But in this scenario, the father is the one suing, so the child is the client, right? Because the father is the one who is the client. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, the scenario says the father is the one who is suing the pilot for his son. So the father is the client? Or is the child the client? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The father is the one who is in the lawsuit. So, the father is suing the pilot for the child's injuries. So, the father is the client. The pilot is suing him. So, the father is the client, the pilot is the attorney. So, the child is the one giving the statement. Now, the question is whether the child's statement is privileged.

But wait, the father didn't retain any attorney to represent the son. Instead, he hired another. So, the child is the one being represented by his own father, but that's not the case. Wait, the father is the client, the pilot is the one suing. So, the child is the one giving the statement, and the father is the client. So, the child is the one being represented by his father.

Wait, but the question says the father didn't retain the consulting attorney to represent his son. So, the father is the client, and he's hiring another lawyer. So, the child is the one who is the client, and the father is the client suing the pilot.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me rephrase:

- The child is the one injured. The father is the one who is the client of the pilot. So, father is the one calling the pilot for his own injury.

But the child is the one who is the one giving the statement to the pilot. So, the father is the client, the child is the one giving the statement, and the pilot is suing.

Wait, no. The statement is made by the child, and the father is the one calling the pilot. So, the child is the client of the pilot, and the father is the client of the child. So, in this case, the child is the one being sued, and the father is the one who is suing. So, the father is the client, and the child is the one who is the client of the pilot.

Wait, now I'm getting more confused. Let me think again.

The question is about whether the child's statement is admissible under the attorney-client privilege. The key point here is whether the statement was made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.

The child gave the statement, and he's a 9-year-old. He's a minor, so he can't represent himself unless he's the client. But in this case, the child is the one who is suing the pilot. So, the child is the one being sued, and the father is the one calling the pilot.

Wait, perhaps I should think that way: the child is suing the pilot for his own injuries, so he is the person suing. The father is the one who is the client of the pilot (the pilot is suing the father). But the father didn't retain an attorney to represent the child, so he's using his own attorney, or perhaps hiring another. So, the father is the client, and the child is the one who is the client of the father.

Wait, no. No, the father is the one who is suing the pilot for the child's injuries. So, the father is the client of the pilot. The child is the one who is suing the pilot. So, the child is the one giving the statement, and the father is the one who is representing the child. But the father didn't retain an attorney to represent the child; he used his own or another's.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the key issue: was the statement made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment? The child is a minor, so he's allowed to give testimony as a minor, but the question is about the privilege.

So, if the child's statement was made for medical purposes, it's privileged. If not, it's inadmissible. But the child's statement is about his physical condition, which could be for medical purposes, but if it's not made for that purpose, then it's inadmissible.

But in this case, the child is the one who is giving the statement. The question is whether he's the client or the attorney. Wait, no, the child is the one suing the pilot, so the father is the client of the pilot. The child is the one giving the statement to the pilot. So, the statement is being made by the child, who is a minor.

Now, the issue is whether the child's statement was made for medical purposes. The child is a minor, so he can't represent himself unless he's the client. Wait, but he's the one who's suing, so he's the client of the pilot. So, the child is the one who is the client, and he's calling the pilot for his injury. But the child is giving a statement about his physical condition, which is about his own health, not the pilot's.

Wait, but the child is the one who is the client, and he is calling the pilot. He's giving a statement to the pilot, and the pilot is suing him for the child's injuries. So, the statement is about the child's physical condition, not the pilot's. So, it's not about medical treatment for the pilot.

But the issue is about whether the child's statement is privileged. The child is the one who is the client of the pilot, and the statement is about his physical condition. Since the child is a minor, he's allowed to give testimony as a minor. But the question is whether the statement was made for medical purposes.

Wait, the key is whether the statement was made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment. The child is a minor, so he's not required to retain an attorney to represent himself, unless he's the client. But in this case, the father is the one calling the pilot, so the child is the client of the pilot. So, the child is the one who is the client, and the father is the one who is the client of the child. So, the child is the one being sued, and the father is the one calling the pilot.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try a different approach. The crux is: was the child's statement made for medical treatment? If yes, it's privileged. If not, it's inadmissible.

The child is the one giving the statement. The father is the one calling the pilot. So, the statement is about the child's condition. The child is a minor, so he can give testimony as a minor. But if the statement was made for medical purposes, it's privileged. If not, it's inadmissible.

But the statement is about the child's physical condition, not the pilot's. So, it's not about medical treatment for the pilot. Therefore, it's not a privilege issue. The child's statement is about his own health, not the pilot's.

So, the child is the person suing, and the statement is about his own physical condition. Since he's a minor, he's allowed to give testimony as a minor. But the question is about the privilege. The issue here is whether the statement was made for medical purposes. The child is a minor, but the statement is about his physical condition, not the pilot's. So, it's not for medical treatment.

Wait, but wait. The child is the one who is the client of the pilot. So, the child is the one calling the pilot for his injury. But he's making a statement to the pilot about his own condition. So, the statement is about his own health, not the pilot's. Therefore, it's not for medical purposes.

So, the statement isn't made for medical treatment. Therefore, it's not a privilege issue. The person suing is the father, the pilot is suing the father. The child is the one calling the pilot, and the pilot is suing him for the child's injuries. The child's statement is about his own condition, not the pilot's.

So, the statement isn't made for medical purposes. Therefore, the child's statement is admissible because it wasn't made for medical treatment.

Wait, but the options include options about whether the statement is privileged. Let me look back at the options.

Option A says it's admissible because the father didn't retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege. That doesn't make sense. If the father didn't retain an attorney, but he's still the client, then the attorney-client privilege still applies. It's about confidentiality, not about the purpose of the communication.

Option B says it's inadmissible because it was a statement of physical condition not made for medical treatment. That makes sense because the child is a minor and can't give medical testimony unless he's the client. But wait, the child is the one giving the statement, not the client.

Wait, no. The child is the one calling the pilot. The pilot is suing the father for the child's injuries. The child is the one calling the pilot. The statement is about his physical condition. So, the statement is about his own health, not the pilot's.

Therefore, it's not a privilege issue because it's not about medical treatment for the pilot. So, the child's statement is admissible.

Looking at the options, option B says it's inadmissible because it was a statement of physical condition not made for medical treatment. That would be correct if the statement was made for medical purposes. But in this case, it's not.

Wait, no. The statement is about the child's condition, not the pilot's. So, it's not for medical treatment for the pilot. So, the child's statement is admissible because it wasn't made for medical purposes.

But wait, the question is about the conversation where the father gave the statement. The father didn't retain an attorney; he hired another. So, the father is the one calling the pilot, and the statement is about the child's condition. The child is the one giving the statement, and the father is the one calling.

So, the statement is made by the child for his own understanding. The child is a minor, so he's allowed to give testimony as a minor. But the key is whether the statement was made for medical purposes. Since it's about the child's condition, not the pilot's, it's not a privilege issue.

So, the statement is admissible because it wasn't made for medical treatment. Therefore, looking at the options, the correct one would be option B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.

Wait, but wait again. The child is the one making the statement, and that's for his own condition, not the pilot's. So, it's not a privilege issue. It's acceptable.

But the options include option B, which says it's inadmissible because the statement wasn't for medical treatment. But in this case, it is about the child's condition, which is not for medical treatment. So, option B would be incorrect.

Wait, then I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

Attorney-client privilege: the privilege is about the confidentiality of communications. It does not prevent the giving of non-confidential information, as long as it's not a privilege.

So, the child is the one giving the statement. Since he's a minor, he can give testimony about his condition. But, he's a minor and is a client of the pilot. So, the statement is about his own condition, not the pilot's. Therefore, the statement is not made for medical treatment, so it's admissible.

Wait, but the child is a minor and the father is the client. The statement is about the child's condition, so it's not a privilege issue. The statement is admissible.

Wait, but the options include option B as inadmissible. So I'm getting conflicting conclusions.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the father didn't retain an attorney to represent the child (but he's the client of the pilot) affects the privilege. Or perhaps the fact that the child is a minor affects the options.

Wait, another angle: the child is the one giving the statement, and he's a minor. So, he can give testimony as a minor. But for that, he doesn't need to retain an attorney. But the initial question is about whether the statement is privileged.

The child is the one giving the statement, and the father is the one calling. So, the statement is about the child's condition, not the pilot's. Therefore, it's not a privilege issue. It's admissible.

But none of the options say that. The options are about whether it's inadmissible due to being a statement of physical condition not made for medical purposes, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The child is a minor, so he's allowed to give testimony as a minor. But the statement is about his physical condition, which could be for his own understanding, not for medical treatment.

So, it's not a privilege issue. So, the statement is admissible, making option A or B incorrect.

Wait, the options don't have an admissible option. Wait, the options are:

A: admissible because the father didn't retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege. (No, the father didn't retain the attorney, but that doesn't affect privilege; privilege is about not having confidential communications.)

B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for medical treatment.

C: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.

D: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.

E: admissible, because the lawsuit makes all previous communications related to the case public.

F: admissible, because the boy was not the attorney's client, only the father.

G: admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.

H: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.

I: inadmissible, because the consultation was preliminary and does not constitute a formal attorney-client relationship.

J: inadmissible, because the boy is a minor and cannot legally waive his rights to attorney-client privilege.

So, the crucial point is whether the statement was made for medical treatment. Since the statement is about the child's physical condition, which is not for medical purposes, it's admissible.

But in the options, none directly say admissible. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, the question is about whether the statement is admissible. So, if it's not for medical purposes, it's admissible.

But looking at option B: it's inadmissible because it was a statement of physical condition not made for medical treatment.

If that's the case, then the statement is inadmissible. But that would only be true if the statement was made for medical purposes. So, the correct answer would be B, but that doesn't make sense because the statement is about the child's condition, not the pilot's.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The conversation is between the father and the child. The child is a minor, so he can't represent himself unless he's the client. But in this case, the father is the client. So, the child is the one making the statement.

The statement is about the child's condition, not the pilot's. So, it's not a privilege issue. So, the statement is admissible.

But the options don't have an option saying admissible. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the fact that the child is a minor affects the options. Option F says admissible because the boy was not the attorney's client, only the father. But the statement is about the child, who is the client of the pilot, not the father.

So, the father is the client. The child is the client of the father. So, the child is the one making the statement.

Hmm, maybe that's not the issue. The issue is whether the statement was made for medical treatment. So, the statement is about the child's condition, not the pilot's, so it's not a privilege issue. Therefore, it's inadmissible if it was made for medical purposes.

But in this case, the statement is not made for medical purposes, so it's admissible. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the statement was made by a minor, so some other rule applies. Like, the statement is admissible only if the child is the client of the pilot and not the father.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the child is a minor allows him to give testimony as a non-attorney. But that's about privilege, not about the type of information.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the options. The key point is whether the statement was made for medical purposes.

If it wasn't, then it's admissible. But the options don't have the admissible option. So, perhaps I'm wrong in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the fact that the child is a minor makes the statements not privileged. But the question is about whether the statement was made for medical purposes, which would make it inadmissible.

So, the correct answer would be B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for medical treatment.

Ah, I think that's the correct reasoning. So, the child is a minor and cannot give medical testimony unless he's the client. But in this case, the child is the one making the statement, and he's a minor. But he's not the client of the pilot. He's the client of the father. So, the child is the one giving the statement to the pilot.

So, the statement is about the child's condition, not the pilot's. Therefore, the child is allowed to give testimony as a minor, and the statement is not privileged because it's not for medical purposes.

Wait, but the question is about whether the statement was made for medical purposes. So, if the statement was made for medical purposes, it's inadmissible. If not, it's admissible.

In this case, the child is the one making the statement, and that's about his own condition, not the pilot's. So, it's not a privilege issue. It's acceptable.

But the options don't have an option for that. So, perhaps the correct answer is B, which says the statement is inadmissible because it wasn't made for medical treatment.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. The statement isn't made for medical treatment. So, it's admissible.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the wrong scenario. Let me try once again.

The father is the client of the pilot. The child is the client of the father. The child is making a statement to the pilot about his own condition. So, the statement is about his own health, not the pilot's.

Therefore, it's not a privilege issue. So, the statement is admissible.

But the options don't have an option for that. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of the other options.

Option C: inadmissible because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach.

But the issue is not about the privilege; it's about whether the statement was made for medical purposes. The child is a minor, so he can give testimony as a minor unless he's the client.

Wait, but in this case, the child is the one making the statement, and he's a minor. So, he can give his own testimony as a minor, but he's the one making the statement, not the client. The confusion arises because the child is making the statement to the pilot.

So, the child is the one making the statement, and he's a minor. But he's not the client of the pilot. He's the client of the father. So, the child is the one giving the statement to the pilot.

So, the statement is about the child's own condition, not the pilot's. Therefore, it's not a privilege issue. So, the statement is admissible.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.

Wait, but that would only be correct if the statement was made for medical purposes. If it's not, then it's admissible. So, I'm back to square one.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that the statement was made by the child, who is a minor, so he can give testimony as a minor. But the issue is whether the statement was made for medical treatment. If not, it's admissible.

In this case, the statement is not about medical treatment for the pilot. So, it's admissible. But the options don't have an admissible option. So, perhaps I'm wrong in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the father didn't retain an attorney to represent the child. So, he's the one calling the pilot, and the child is the one calling the pilot. The statement is about the child's condition, not the pilot's. Therefore, it's not a privilege issue. So, it's admissible.

But the options don't have an admissible option. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the fact that the child is a minor allows him to give testimony as a minor, but the statement is about his own condition, not the pilot's. So, it's not a privilege issue. It's admissible.

But the options don't have an option for that. So, perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer is B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for medical treatment.

Wait, but the statement isn't made for medical treatment for the pilot. So, it's admissible.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.
</think>

The issue revolves around the attorney-client privilege and whether a statement was made for medical purposes. The child is a minor, so he can give testimony as a minor unless he is the client. In this case, the child is the one making the statement to the pilot, and the statement is about his own condition, not the pilot's. Since the statement was not made for medical purposes, it is admissible. However, the options provided do not directly reflect this reasoning. 

Upon further consideration, the statement was made by the child, who is a minor, and the child's statement was about his own condition, not the pilot's. Therefore, the statement was not made for medical purposes. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: B
