Okay, so I've got this problem about electromagnetic waves and their penetration depth. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the amplitude of the wave is given by E_y = E0 e^{-x/δ}, where E0 is the initial amplitude, and the wave is traveling in the x-direction. So, I remember that the penetration depth (often denoted as δ) is the distance over which the amplitude decreases by a factor of 1/e. But wait, wait, I think the formula is actually δ = (1/k), where k is the wave number. Oh right, because the general form for exponential decay is E = E0 e^{-kx}, so k is the rate constant, and δ is 1/k. So, the penetration depth is the inverse of the wave number.

The question asks for the 10% and 60% depth of penetration. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the options are about the actual depths, not percentages of the original amplitude. So I need to find the x values that correspond to 10% and 60% penetration.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about how to approach this. The penetration depth δ is the distance where the amplitude is e^{-1}, which is about 0.3679. But the question is about the depth at which the amplitude is 10% and 60% of the initial value.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The question says 10% and 60% depth of penetration. So that would mean that the amplitude is e^{-0.1} and e^{-0.6} respectively, because the depth is the distance where the amplitude is reduced by a factor of 10% or 60%. Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. The penetration depth δ is such that after a distance δ, the amplitude is 1/e (about 37%) of the initial. So if you have a depth x, the amplitude is E0 e^{-x/δ}. So for 10% penetration depth, that would mean x is δ * (ln(10))^-1? Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the penetration depth δ is the distance where the amplitude is 1/e. So, for 10% penetration, the amplitude is E = 0.1 E0. So, 0.1 = e^{-x/δ}. Solving for x: x = δ * ln(1/0.1) = δ * ln(10) ≈ δ * 2.3026. So 10% penetration depth is about 2.303δ. Similarly, for 60% penetration: 0.6 = e^{-x/δ} → x = δ * ln(1/0.6) → ln(1.6667)≈ 0.5108, so x≈0.5108δ.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check which option has 10% as 2.3δ and 60% as 0.51δ. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 10% is 0.3δ, 60% 1δ. No.

B: 10% δ, 60% 3δ. No.

C: 10% 2.3δ, 60% 0.51δ → This matches what I just calculated.

Wait, but wait. So option C's 10% is 2.3δ, which is approximately 2.3 times δ, and 60% is 0.51δ. So that would be correct.

Wait, but wait another thought: The question asks for the 10% and 60% depth of penetration. Does that mean the x values where the amplitude is 10% and 60% of the initial? So, for 10% penetration depth: x is δ * ln(10) ≈ 2.3026 δ. And 60% is x = δ * ln(10/0.6) → ln(10/0.6)= ln(16.666) ≈ 2.813. Wait, wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: The penetration depth δ is the distance at which the amplitude is 1/e, so 0.3679 E0. So, the 10% penetration depth is the x where E is 0.1 E0. The 60% is where E is 0.6 E0.

So solving E = E0 e^{-x/δ}.

For 10% penetration: 0.1 = e^{-x/(δ)} → x = δ * ln(1/0.1) = δ * ln(10) ≈ 2.3026 δ.

For 60% penetration: 0.6 = e^{-x/(δ)} → x = δ * ln(1/0.6) = δ * ln(5/3) ≈ δ * 0.5108.

Looking for options where 10% is 2.3 δ, 60% is 0.51 δ. Option C is 10% 2.3δ, 60% 0.51δ. So option C is correct.

Wait, but the options are given as:

Looking at the options, option C is 10% depth of 2.3δ, 60% 0.51δ. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option E is 10% 0.1δ, 60% 0.3δ. That's way lower than what I've calculated.

Option B is 10% δ, 60% 3δ. No.

Hmm, so the correct answer should be option C.
</think>

To determine the 10% and 60% depth of penetration for an electromagnetic wave with amplitude \( E_y = E_0 e^{-x/\delta} \), we use the fact that the penetration depth \( \delta \) is defined as the distance at which the amplitude decreases to \( 1/e \) (approximately 0.3679). The problem asks for the distances corresponding to 10% and 60% of the initial amplitude.

### Key Analysis:
1. **10% Penetration Depth**:
   - The amplitude at 10% penetration depth is \( E = 0.1 E_0 \).
   - Using the formula \( E = E_0 e^{-x/\delta} \), we solve for \( x \):
     \[
     0.1 = e^{-x/\delta} \implies x = \delta \ln(1/0.1) = \delta \ln(10) \approx \delta \cdot 2.3026.
     \]
   - Thus, the 10% depth of penetration is approximately \( 2.3026\delta \).

2. **60% Penetration Depth**:
   - The amplitude at 60% penetration depth is \( E = 0.6 E_0 \).
   - Using the formula \( E = E_0 e^{-x/\delta} \), we solve for \( x \):
     \[
     0.6 = e^{-x/\delta} \implies x = \delta \ln(1/0.6) = \delta \ln(5/3) \approx \delta \cdot 0.5108.
     \]
   - Thus, the 60% depth of penetration is approximately \( 0.5108\delta \).

3. **Matching with Options**:
   - Option C provides the correct values: \( 10\% \) depth of penetration is \( 2.3\delta \), and \( 60\% \) depth of penetration is \( 0.51\delta \).

### Conclusion:
Option C is the correct answer.
