Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving two inequalities and finding which point isn't a solution to both. Let me think through this step by step.

The inequalities are y > 9x – 8 and y < –x + 8. So I need to find points that satisfy both of these conditions. The options are A to F, each with different coordinates.

Let me start by understanding each inequality.

First inequality: y > 9x – 8. That's a linear equation, and the area above it is where this inequality holds. The line is y = 9x -8, a straight line with a slope of 9. Since it's a "greater than" inequality, the region above the line is included.

Second inequality: y < -x + 8. Again, a linear equation, but with a slope of -1 and a y-intercept at 8. The region below this line is where this inequality is true.

So, any point that is in both regions will satisfy both inequalities. The points that fall in the overlapping area are the solutions. The question asks which of these options is NOT a solution to both.

Let me list the points:

A: (-2, 15)
B: (-1,5)
C: (-2, -8)
D: (0,0)
E: (1,5)
F: (-1,-1)

I'll check each point against both inequalities.

Starting with option A: (-2,15)
First inequality: y > 9x -8. Let's plug in x=-2. 9*(-2) is -18. So 9x-8 is -26. So y=15 is greater than -26. Yes, 15 > -26 is true. So this point satisfies the first inequality.

Second inequality: y < -x +8. Plugging in x=-2, -x is 2. So 2 +8 =10. So y=15 <10? No, 15 is not less than 10. So this point doesn't satisfy the second inequality. Therefore, option A is not a solution to both.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the other options too to make sure. Maybe another option is the correct answer.

Option B: (-1,5)
First inequality: y=5 > 9*(-1) -8 = -9-8= -17. 5> -17 is true.

Second inequality: y=5 < -(-1) +8= 1+8=9. 5 <9 is true. So B is a solution.

Option C: (-2,-8)
First inequality: y=-8 > 9*(-2) -8= -18-8=-26. Is -8 >-26? Yes, because -8 is to the right of -26 on the number line. So yes.

Second inequality: y=-8 < -(-2)+8=2+8=10. -8 <10 is true. So C is a solution.

Option D: (0,0)
First inequality: 0 > 9*0 -8= -8. 0> -8 is true.

Second inequality: 0 < -(0) +8=0+8=8. 0<8 is true. So D is a solution.

Option E: (1,5)
First inequality: 5>9*1 -8=9-8=1. 5>1 is true.

Second inequality: 5 < -(1)+8=7. 5<7 is true. So E is a solution.

Option F: (-1,-1)
First inequality: y=-1 >9*(-1) -8 =-9-8=-17. Yes, -1> -17 is true.

Second inequality: y=-1 < -(-1)+8=1+8=9. -1 <9 is true. So F is a solution.

Wait, but the question asks which of the options is NOT a solution to both. So looking back, option A didn't satisfy the second inequality, so it's the correct answer.

The correct answer is A, as it fails the second inequality.

Answer: A
