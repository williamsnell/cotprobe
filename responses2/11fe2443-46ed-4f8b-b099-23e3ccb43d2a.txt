Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the molar entropy of neon at a higher temperature. Hmm, neon is a noble gas, so I remember that it's a noble gas with an atomic number of 10 and it's a monoatomic gas, right? That means it has only three degrees of freedom.

The problem says that the entropy is given at 298.15 K, which is 25°C, and we need to find it at 500 K. Oh wait, no, wait—wait, the given entropy is at 298 K, and we need to calculate it at 500 K. So, since the temperature is changing, I should use the appropriate thermodynamic equation to relate the two.

Wait, the formula for entropy change when the temperature changes at constant volume is... I think it's the integral of dS over the temperature change. Since entropy change, ΔS, is equal to Cv multiplied by the change in temperature (ΔT), assuming constant volume. Oh right, because for entropy, when volume is constant, dS = Cv dT / T, so integrating that gives S = Cv ln(T2 / T1) + S1. Or wait, wait no, wait. Wait, no, that's if the heat capacity is constant. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with a constant volume sample. So the molar heat capacity at constant volume, Cv, is what's given. Oh wait, but wait, the given data is at 298 K, and the question is about finding the entropy at 500 K. But wait, I'm not sure if the heat capacity is constant over the temperature range from 298 to 500 K. Neon's heat capacity might vary with temperature, but I'm not sure how much. Do I have any data on that?

But wait, the problem states that data refers to 298.15 K unless stated otherwise. Oh, but wait, the formula for entropy change when the temperature changes is ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1) if the heat capacity is constant. But if the heat capacity varies with temperature, then this approximation won't be exact. Hmm, but since the problem doesn't provide any information about the variation of Cv with temperature, perhaps we're supposed to assume that Cv is constant over the temperature interval. Or maybe the problem expects us to use this formula regardless of whether Cv is constant.

Wait, but wait, I'm supposed to calculate it given that data is at 298 K, but how does that fit in? So the given S is at 298 K, and the temperature we need to find is 500 K. So, the two temperatures are 298 and 500. The change in temperature is ΔT = 500 - 298 = 202 K. So, if we model Cv as constant, then the entropy change would be S2 = S1 + Cv * ln(T2/T1).

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me get this right. The entropy at 298 K is given as 146.22 J/(K·mol). We need to find the entropy at 500 K. So, the change in entropy is S2 = S1 + ΔS. And ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1). Oh wait, but in terms of molar entropy, so n=1 mole.

Wait, but I don't know what Cv is for neon at 500 K. Because the problem didn't give any information about that. So, if the heat capacity is not constant, this approach would not be valid. Hmm. But since the problem doesn't specify any variation, perhaps I'm supposed to take Cv as constant. So what's the Cv for neon?

Wait, neon is monoatomic, so the degrees of freedom are 3. The molar heat capacity at constant volume for a monoatomic ideal gas is Cv = (3/2) R, where R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/(K·mol). So, R is 8.314. So, Cv = (3/2) * 8.314 = 12.471 J/(K·mol).

So, now, applying the formula: ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1). Since n=1 mole, it's just Cv multiplied by ln(500/298.15). Let me calculate that.

First, compute the ratio: 500 / 298.15 ≈ 1.676.

Then, ln(1.676) ≈ what? Let me think. I know that ln(1.6487) is about 0.5, because e^0.5 is about 1.6487. But 1.676 is a bit higher. Alternatively, since ln(1.676) ≈ let's approximate.

I can use a calculator approach. Let me compute it step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can just compute it using a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that ln(1.67) is approximately 0.517, and ln(1.68) is about 0.521. So, 1.676 is about 1.676. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Taylor expansion or some approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can just compute it using a calculator.

Wait, since I'm doing this in my head, perhaps I can recall that ln(1.676) is approximately 0.517. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use ln(1.676) ≈ 0.517, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact value.

But perhaps I should proceed with the calculation. Let me compute ln(500/298.15) = ln(1.6768).

Wait, I recall that ln(1.676) is approximately 0.517. So, then, S2 = 146.22 + (12.471 J/(K·mol)) * 0.517.

Wait, 12.471 * 0.517. Let's compute that. 12 * 0.5 is 6, 0.471 *0.5 is 0.2355. Hmm, wait, perhaps it's better to compute 12.471 * 0.517.

Wait, 12.471 * 0.5 is 6.2355, and 12.471 * 0.017 is approx 0.212. So, adding them together: 6.2355 + 0.212 = approximately 6.4475 J/(K·mol).

So, S2 = 146.22 + 6.4475 ≈ 152.6675 J/(K·mol).

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. Wait, 12.471 * 0.517.

Let me compute 12 * 0.517: 12 * 0.5 is 6, 12 * 0.017 is 0.204, so 6.204.

Then, 0.471 * 0.517. Let's compute 0.4 * 0.517 = 0.2068, 0.071 * 0.517 = approx 0.0367. So, 0.2068 + 0.0367 = 0.2435.

Adding 6.204 and 0.2435: 6.4475. So, yes, about 6.4475 J/(K·mol).

So, adding to 146.22: 146.22 +6.4475 ≈ 152.6675 J/(K·mol).

Looking at the options, I see option H is 152.67 J/(K·mol). So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute, are we assuming that the heat capacity is constant? Because if we didn't know that, the calculation would be wrong. But the problem doesn't provide any information about how Cv changes with temperature. So, perhaps the intended approach is to assume Cv is constant, which is a common approximation.

So, the answer should be 152.67, which is option H.

To calculate the molar entropy of a constant-volume sample of neon at 500 K, we use the formula for entropy change at constant volume:

\[
\Delta S = n C_v \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)
\]

Here:
- \( S_1 = 146.22 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}} \) is the entropy at \( T_1 = 298.15 \, \mathrm{K} \),
- \( C_v \) is the molar heat capacity at constant volume for neon,
- \( T_2 = 500 \, \mathrm{K} \) is the final temperature,
- \( n = 1 \, \mathrm{mol} \).

For a monoatomic ideal gas like neon, the molar heat capacity at constant volume is:

\[
C_v = \frac{3}{2} R = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 8.314 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}} = 12.471 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}
\]

The ratio of the final temperature to the initial temperature is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{500}{298.15} \approx 1.676
\]

The natural logarithm of this ratio is approximately:

\[
\ln(1.676) \approx 0.517
\]

Substituting into the entropy change formula:

\[
\Delta S = 12.471 \cdot 0.517 \approx 6.4475 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}
\]

Adding this to the given entropy at 298 K:

\[
S_2 = S_1 + \Delta S = 146.22 + 6.4475 \approx 152.6675 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}
\]

The closest option to this value is **152.67 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹**, which corresponds to option **H**.
