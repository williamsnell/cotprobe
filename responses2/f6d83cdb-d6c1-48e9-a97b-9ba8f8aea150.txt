Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a particle and a conservative force. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

The question says the potential energy function is U(x) = (x – 2)^3 – 12x. And they're asking which position represents a stable equilibrium. The options are from A to J, with various x values.

Wait, right, stable equilibrium is when if you move a little bit from that point, the potential energy increases. So, I remember that the condition for stable equilibrium is that the second derivative of the potential energy with respect to x is positive. Because the first derivative gives the force, and the second derivative tells us if it's a minimum point.

So, let me start by finding the first derivative of U(x) to get the force. Let's compute U'(x). 

U(x) = (x - 2)^3 -12x. 

The derivative of (x-2)^3 is 3(x-2)^2 *1. And the derivative of -12x is -12. So,

U’(x) = 3(x-2)^2 -12.

But wait, the force F is the negative gradient of potential energy. So F = -dU/dx, which is equal to U’(x). Wait no, wait. No, the force F is actually -dU/dx. So, F = -U’(x). So, F = - [3(x-2)^2 -12 ].

But wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The force is the negative gradient of U. So, F = -dU/dx. So, F = - (3(x-2)^2 -12 )? Or is that correct?

Wait, no, the potential energy U is (x-2)^3 -12x.

So, dU/dx is 3(x-2)^2 -12. Therefore, F = -dU/dx = - [3(x-2)^2 -12 ] = -3(x-2)^2 +12.

But maybe I should just think about the condition for equilibrium first. Equilibrium occurs when F = 0, which is when U’(x) = 0 because F = -dU/dx, so setting F to zero means dU/dx is zero.

So, let me solve for x where U’(x) = 0.

So, 3(x-2)^2 -12 = 0.

Divide both sides by 3: (x-2)^2 -4 = 0.

Then, (x-2)^2 =4.

Take square roots: x-2 = ±2.

So, x-2=2 → x=4.

x-2=-2 → x=0.

So the equilibrium points are at x=4 and x=0.

Now, to determine stability, I need the second derivative at these points. The second derivative of U is the derivative of U’(x).

We have U’(x) = 3(x-2)^2 -12.

Take derivative again: U''(x) = 6(x-2).

So, at x=4: U''(4) = 6*(4-2)=6*2=12, which is positive. So, this point is a minimum, so it's a stable equilibrium.

At x=0: U''(0) =6*(0-2)=6*(-2)=-12, which is negative. So, this is a maximum, which would be an unstable equilibrium.

So, the only stable equilibrium is at x=4, which is option G.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the options given are:

A:2, B:-2, C:-4, D:0, E:8, F:-6, G:4, H:-8, I:10, J:6.

So, G is x=4. So, the answer must be G.

To determine the position of stable equilibrium for the given potential energy function \( U(x) = (x - 2)^3 - 12x \), we analyze the equilibrium points and their stability using the second derivative of \( U(x) \).

1. **First Derivative (Force):**  
   The force \( F \) is given by \( F = -\frac{dU}{dx} \). Calculating \( \frac{dU}{dx} \):  
   \[
   \frac{dU}{dx} = 3(x - 2)^2 - 12
   \]  
   Setting the force to zero for equilibrium:  
   \[
   3(x - 2)^2 - 12 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (x - 2)^2 = 4
   \]  
   Solving for \( x \):  
   \[
   x - 2 = \pm 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 4 \text{ or } x = 0
   \]  

2. **Second Derivative (Stability):**  
   The second derivative of \( U(x) \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(x - 2)
   \]  
   Evaluating at the equilibrium points:  
   - At \( x = 4 \):  
     \[
     \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(4 - 2) = 12 \, (> 0)
     \]  
     A positive second derivative indicates a **stable equilibrium**.  
   - At \( x = 0 \):  
     \[
     \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(0 - 2) = -12 \, (< 0)
     \]  
     A negative second derivative indicates an **unstable equilibrium**.  

3. **Conclusion:**  
   The only stable equilibrium occurs at \( x = 4 \), which corresponds to option G.
