Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistics problem. Let me read the question again. It says that a soft drink machine can be adjusted to deliver any fixed number of ounces. The machine has a standard deviation of 0.3 ounces in delivery. We need to find the mean setting so that a 12-ounce cup overflows less than 1% of the time. The machine's delivery follows a normal distribution. 

Hmm, I remember that for normal distributions, we can use z-scores to find probabilities. The problem is about overflow, so we're probably dealing with the probability that the machine dispenses more than 12 ounces.

Wait, so overflow would mean the amount dispensed is more than 12 ounces. We want the probability of this to be less than 1%, which is 0.01. Because 1% is a small tail probability, I think we can use the z-score that corresponds to that probability.

The Z-score formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value we're interested in (12 ounces), μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation (0.3).

We need to find μ such that P(X > 12) < 0.01. Since X is normally distributed, this probability corresponds to the area to the right of a certain Z value.

Looking at standard normal distribution tables, the 1% tail corresponds to a Z value of about -2.33. Wait, no—wait, no, wait. Because for a right-tail probability of 1%, the Z value is positive, right? Wait, no, the Z distribution is symmetric. Let me think.

Wait, no—actually, the 1% in the right tail would correspond to a Z value of about 2.33. Because the 99th percentile is at Z=2.33. Because 0.5% is below and 0.5% above, but wait, no. Wait, the tail probability is 1%, so the cumulative probability up to the Z value is 0.99. So the Z value that gives 0.99 cumulative is about 2.33. Correct.

So, we can set up the equation:

P(X > 12) = P(Z > (12 - μ)/0.3) < 0.01.

Since P(Z > z) = 0.01, z must be approximately 2.33 (since 1% is in the upper tail). So,

(12 - μ)/0.3 = 2.33.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think again. The Z-score is (12 - μ)/0.3 because μ is the mean, and X is 12.

Wait, because X > 12, so 12 - μ is the negative part. The Z-score for the upper tail is positive. So the Z is 2.33.

So, (12 - μ) / 0.3 = 2.33.

Wait, but wait, let's ensure. If μ is higher than 12, then 12 - μ is negative, so (12 - μ)/0.3 is negative, and Z would be negative. But for a positive Z, we have (μ - 12)/0.3 = 2.33.

Because if μ is higher than 12, then (μ -12) would be positive, and the Z becomes positive. That makes sense.

So, solving for μ:

μ = 12 + (2.33 * 0.3).

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The Z-score is (X - μ)/σ. If the machine is set to a mean μ, and we have X >12, then (12 - μ)/0.3 would be the negative Z. But since we want the upper tail (overflow), the Z we look up is positive, so we take the negative of that.

So, the correct equation is (μ -12)/0.3 = 2.33.

Which means μ = 12 + (2.33 * 0.3).

Wait, but wait—no, wait. If Z is (12 - μ)/0.3 = -2.33, then (12 - μ) = -2.33*0.3, which gives μ =12 + (0.3*2.33) = 12 + 0.699. So, μ would be 12.7. So the mean should be set to just above 12.7 ounces so that the machine dispenses more than 12 ounces only 1% of the time.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the choices are all of the form 12 plus or minus something times 0.3.

Looking at option I: 12+1.96(0.3). Which is 12+0.588=12.588. Hmm, that's less than 12.7.

Option B is 12 - 1.645(0.3) = 12 -0.4935=11.5065, which is less than 12, which makes sense if the mean is set lower.

Option D is 12 -1.96(0.3)=12-0.588=11.412. So that's even lower.

Option F is 12+1.645(0.3)=12+0.4935=12.4935.

Wait, so in my calculation, the correct mean is 12 + 0.699, which is approximately 12.7. But looking at the options, none of the options have a 0.7. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused the direction. Let's re-examine the problem. The machine's mean is μ. We want the probability that X>12 to be less than 1%. So, for X ~ N(μ, 0.3^2), P(X>12) <0.01.

So, Z = (12 - μ)/0.3. We want P(Z > z) =0.01, meaning z=2.33.

So, for P(X>12)=0.01, we have (12 - μ)/0.3 = -2.33. Which implies μ=12 + (0.3 * 2.33) =12 +0.699=12.699, approximately 12.7.

Looking at the options, that's closest to option I: 12+1.96*0.3. Wait, 1.96 is about 95% confidence interval, so maybe another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider a two-tailed test, but the question says overflow less than 1% of the time, so perhaps it's a one-tailed test.

Wait, but the standard deviation is given, so perhaps the problem uses a one-tailed approach, with the tail being 1%. So the Z is 2.33. So the correct mean is 12 + 0.3*2.33=12.699.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 12 +1.96 *0.3=12.588, which is about 12.588, which is lower than 12.699, so it would result in a higher overflow rate. Because if the mean is set lower, the machine dispenses less, so the probability of overflow increases.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

If the machine is set to 12.7 ounces, then the probability that X>12 is 1%, because 12.7 is the mean, and the standard deviation is 0.3, so the 12 is one standard deviation below the mean (12.7-12=0.7, which is 0.7/0.3=2.333 standard deviations below). So, the area to the right of Z=2.33 is about 0.0099, which is less than 1%. So, that's correct.

Looking at the options, the correct mean is 12 + 0.3 * 2.33 =12.699, which is approximately 12.7.

But looking at the options, the closest to this is option I: 12 +1.96*0.3=12.588. Hmm, that's a lower mean, which would make the overflow more likely. So why is the option I not the correct one?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the question is set up to use a two-tailed test. Because 1% in the tail would correspond to 0.5% on each side. That would require a Z of about 1.96, right? Because the 95% confidence interval is 1.96, so 2.5% on the tail.

Wait, no, the question says overflow less than 1% of the time. So the probability of X>12 is less than 1%. So it's a one-tailed test. So the Z value is 2.33.

So, the correct mean should be 12 + 0.3 * 2.33, which is about 12.699, which is approximately 12.7.

Looking at the options, option I is 12+1.96*(0.3)=12.588. So that's less than our desired mean. That would mean the machine dispenses less than 12.588 ounces on average. So the probability that X>12 would be higher than 1%, because the mean is lower. Thus, option I is not correct.

Wait, but then the options don't have a correct answer matching this. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Z value.

Wait, wait. I think I might have mixed up the direction. Let me double-check the Z value for 1% tail. Since we want the area to the right of Z to be 1%, which is 0.01. So the cumulative probability up to Z is 0.99. So the Z is positive, and the value is 2.33.

So, going back, the correct mean is 12.699, which is approximately 12.7.

But looking at the options, option I is 12 +1.96*(0.3)=12.588. That's much lower, so that would give a much higher probability of X>12. So why is that an option? Maybe I messed up the wording of the question.

Wait, the question says the machine can be adjusted to deliver any fixed number. So perhaps the mean is set to 12 ounces, but that's not correct because that would make the machine always dispense 12, so overflow would always happen. But that's not what the question is asking.

Wait, no, the machine's mean can be set to any value, so we can adjust it to make the probability of overflow below 1% as desired.

So, the correct mean would be 12 + (Z * 0.3), where Z is 2.33. So 0.3*2.33=0.699, so 12.699.

But looking at the options, the only one that's close is option I: 12 +1.96*(0.3)=12.588, which is 12.588. But this is lower than 12.699, meaning the mean is set lower than required, leading to a higher overflow rate. So that's not acceptable.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about the direction of the inequality. Let me think. The machine can be set to a mean μ. The probability that it dispenses more than 12 ounces is P(X>12) =1%. So, (12-μ)/0.3 = -2.33, which gives μ =12 + (0.3 * 2.33)=12.699.

So, in the options, the closest is option I which is 12+1.96(0.3)=12.588. So that's less than 12.699, meaning the mean is set lower, making overflow more probable. So perhaps none of the options is correct, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question uses the z-score for 1% in the lower tail. But that's not possible because 1% is a small tail, but wait, no. Wait, if we set the mean to a value such that the 12-0.3*1.96=12-0.588=11.412. Then, P(X>12) would be the probability that X>12, which is the same as the probability that X is more than 12. So, in that case, the machine would dispense more than 11.412, which is way more than 12, so the overflow would be high.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think again. Let's compute for option I.

Option I: 12 +1.96*(0.3)=12+0.588=12.588. So the mean is 12.588.

The standard deviation is 0.3.

So, the Z-score for 12 is (12 -12.588)/0.3 = (-0.588)/0.3 = -1.96.

So, the probability that X>12 is the same as P(Z>-1.96). What is that?

Well, looking at standard normal tables, P(Z > -1.96) is equal to 1 - P(Z < -1.96). The value for P(Z < -1.96) is about 0.025. So, 1 - 0.025=0.975. So, the probability is 97.5%, which is way higher than 1%. So option I's mean makes the overflow 97.5% of the time, which is way too high. Thus, option I is incorrect.

So, the correct mean must be higher than 12.699, which is approximately 12.7. Looking for an option that is 12 + 0.3*2.33=12.699.

Looking again at the options:

Option A:12 +0.99(0.3)=12+0.297=12.297, which is lower than 12.3, so overflow probability would be higher.

Option B:12-1.645(0.3)=12-0.4935=11.5065. That's less than 12, which would make the machine always dispense less than or equal to 12 ounces. So, overflow is impossible, which is worse.

Option C:12 +2.326(0.3)=12+0.6978=12.6978, which is about 12.698. That's very close to the correct mean of 12.699. So, option C is 12 + 2.326*0.3=12.698. So, that's about 12.7, which is correct.

But wait, the correct z-score for 1% tail is 2.33, which is higher than 2.326. So, option C uses 2.326, which is a z-score for a 97.5% confidence interval. So, the probability of X>12 would be 1% for option C?

Wait, no. Let me think. Let's compute (12 - μ)/0.3 = -2.326.

So, μ=12 + (0.3 * 2.326)=12 +0.6978=12.6978.

So, the mean is 12.6978.

The probability that X>12 is the probability that (X -12.6978)/0.3 > (12 -12.6978)/0.3 = (-0.6978)/0.3 =-2.326.

Wait, no, because when X=12, (X -μ)/σ= (12 -12.6978)/0.3= -0.6978/0.3 =-2.326. So, the Z is -2.326. So, P(X>12)= P(Z >-2.326)= 1 - P(Z < -2.326). 

Looking up P(Z <-2.326) is about 0.0099, so 1 -0.0099=0.9901, which is about 99%. That's way higher than 1%, so option C's mean would make overflow 99% of the time, which is way too much. So, that's not correct.

Hmm, so the correct mean is 12.699, which isn't one of the options. Wait, but let me look at option I again. Option I is 12 +1.96*(0.3)=12.588. So the mean is 12.588, which is lower than 12.699, so P(X>12) would be higher. So, the overflow would be more than 1% in that case.

So none of the options given would result in overflow less than 1% of the time. But that's not possible because the question must have a correct option. So, I must have made a mistake in my thinking.

Wait, perhaps I have the inequality direction reversed. Let me think again. The machine is set to a mean μ. We need P(X>12) <0.01. So, if μ is lower than 12.7, the P(X>12) will be higher than 1%. For example, if μ is 12.5, then Z=(12 -12.5)/0.3= (-0.5)/0.3≈-1.666. So, P(X>12)= P(Z> -1.666)=1 -0.0485=0.9515, which is 95.15%—way higher than 1%.

So, the correct mean is higher than 12.7, which is approximately 12.7. Now, looking at the options, option I is 12.588, which is way lower. So, no correct option. But that's impossible because the options must include the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong z-value. Let me double-check my standard normal distribution.

For a one-tailed 1% probability, the Z value is 2.33. For two-tailed 1%, it's 1.96. So, the question is about one-tailed, so Z=2.33.

So, the correct mean is 12.699. Let's see which option is closest.

Option C: 12.6978, which is about 12.7, which is correct.

But option C uses 2.326, which is a Z for a 97.5% confidence interval, which is wrong for this question.

So, perhaps the correct mean is 12.699, which is not an option. Therefore, the question must have an error, or I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me think about the question again. It says the machine can be adjusted to deliver any fixed number. So, perhaps the mean can be set to a value where the probability of overflow is just 1%. So, the correct mean is 12.699. But none of the options is exactly 12.699. Let's look at the options again.

Option A:12 +0.99(0.3)=12.297. Mean lower than 12.3, so overflow higher.

Option B:12 -1.645(0.3)=12-0.4935=11.5065. Mean lower than 12, overflow higher.

Option C:12 +2.326(0.3)=12.6978. So, the mean is 12.6978. The probability of X>12 is 1% (since Z would be -2.326, and P(Z>-2.326)=0.99). So, that's correct.

Option D:12 -1.96(0.3)=12-0.588=11.412. Mean lower.

Option E:12 +1.96(0.3)=12.588. Mean lower.

So, the correct option is C, but that uses 2.326, which isn't the right z-value for 1% tail. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-derive the correct mean.

We have a normal distribution X ~ N(μ, σ^2), σ=0.3.

We want P(X>12) <0.01.

So, P(X>12) = P( (X - μ)/σ > (12 - μ)/0.3 ) = P(Z > (12 - μ)/0.3 )

We want this probability to be less than 0.01. So, we need (12 - μ)/0.3 to be such that Z has a lower tail probability of 0.01. So, (12 - μ)/0.3 = -2.33.

Thus, μ =12 + (0.3 * 2.33)=12.699.

So, the correct mean is 12.699.

Now, looking at the options, none of them have 12.699. So, perhaps the options are incorrect, but I have to choose the closest one.

Wait, option I is 12.588, which is lower than 12.699. So, the probability of overflow would be higher. For instance, if the machine is set to 12.588, then the Z for X=12 is (12 -12.588)/0.3= (-0.588)/0.3=-1.96. So, P(X>12)=1 - P(Z < -1.96)=1 -0.025=0.975, which is way higher than 1%.

So, option I's mean is way too low, making overflow 97.5% of the time. So, that's not acceptable.

So, the correct answer must be option I, but that's not correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction of the Z-score. Let me think again.

We have P(X>12)=0.01.

Which is the same as P( (X - μ)/σ > (12 - μ)/σ )=0.01.

So, Z=(12 - μ)/0.3.

We want P(Z > (12 - μ)/0.3 )=0.01.

So, (12 - μ)/0.3 must be such that the probability to the right is 1%. So, (12 - μ)/0.3 is the Z value that cuts off the right tail at 1%. So, Z=2.33.

Thus, 12 - μ=0.3 *2.33=0.699.

So, μ=12 -0.699=11.301. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the machine dispense less than 12 ounces on average. But that's not the case.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the direction of the inequality. Let me think carefully.

We have Z=(12 - μ)/0.3.

We want P(Z > (12 - μ)/0.3 )=0.01.

So, (12 - μ)/0.3 must be the Z value that cuts off the right tail at 1%. So, that Z value is 2.33.

So, 12 - μ=0.3 *2.33=0.699.

So, μ=12 -0.699=11.301. That can't be right because that would make the machine dispense less than 12 ounces on average. But that's not acceptable because the question is about overflow.

Wait, another mistake. Let me think: The probability that X>12 is 0.01. So, X is a normal variable with mean μ and standard deviation 0.3. So, P(X>12)=0.01.

We can write this as P( (X - μ)/0.3 > (12 - μ)/0.3 )=0.01.

So, the right-hand side is Z=(12 - μ)/0.3.

We want P(Z>Z)=0.01. So, Z must be such that the probability of Z being greater than that is 0.01. So, Z is 2.33.

Thus, (12 - μ)/0.3=2.33.

So, 12 - μ= 0.3 *2.33=0.699.

Thus, μ=12 -0.699=11.301.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what we want. Because 11.301 is less than 12, so the probability that X>12 is higher than 1%.

This can't be right because the question is about overflow. So, the correct approach is to set the mean such that the probability of X>12 is 1%. But according to the calculations, the mean would have to be 11.301, which is lower than 12, making overflow more likely. So, that's worse than the question's requirement.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let me think again. Let me write the equation properly.

We have to find μ such that P(X>12) = 0.01.

Which can be written as P( (X - μ)/0.3 > (12 - μ)/0.3 ) =0.01.

So, the right-hand side is Z=(12 - μ)/0.3.

We want P(Z > Z) =0.01. So, Z=2.33.

So, (12 - μ)/0.3=2.33.

Thus, μ=12 -0.3*2.33=12 -0.699=11.301.

Wait, that can't be the right answer because 11.301 is lower than 12, so P(X>12)=0.01 isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the direction of the inequality. Let me think: P(X>12)=0.01. Since X is normally distributed, we can write this as P(X - μ < 12 - μ)=0.01.

Wait, no. Perhaps I should think of it as the probability that X is greater than 12 is 0.01. So, X is a normal variable with mean μ and standard deviation 0.3. Therefore, the Z-score for X=12 is Z=(12 - μ)/0.3.

We want the probability that Z > z =0.01.

So, z=2.33.

Therefore, (12 - μ)/0.3=2.33.

Thus, μ=12-0.3*2.33=12-0.699=11.301.

Wait, but that would mean that the probability of X>12 is 0.01, but in reality, if μ is lower than 12, then X>12 is less likely, so the probability would be higher than 0.01.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. If the mean is lower than 12, the probability that X>12 is lower than 0.01.

Wait, no, the higher the mean, the higher the probability that X>12.

So, to have P(X>12)=0.01, the mean must be set such that the probability is 0.01. So, the mean is higher than 12, but how much higher?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. Let me write the equation correctly.

We have to find μ such that P(X>12)=0.01.

Because X is normal with mean μ, P(X>12)=P( (X - μ)/0.3 > (12 - μ)/0.3 )=0.01.

So, the right-hand side is Z=(12 - μ)/0.3.

We want P(Z > Z) =0.01.

So, Z=2.33.

Thus, (12 - μ)/0.3=2.33.

So, μ=12-0.3*2.33=12-0.699=11.301.

Wait, but that can't be right because 11.301 is less than 12. So, if the mean is 11.301, then X>12 is less likely, so the probability would be lower than 0.01.

Wait, that's the opposite of what's needed. So, in order to have P(X>12)=0.01, the mean must be set higher than 11.301, which would make the probability of X>12=0.01.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's 11.301. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 0.3*2.33:

0.3 *2=0.6, 0.3*0.33=0.099. So, 0.6+0.099=0.699.

So, 12-0.699=11.301.

Wait, but that's the mean that gives P(X>12)=0.01, but that's incorrect because if the mean is lower, the probability would be higher than 0.01.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about the direction. Let me think in terms of the Z-score.

We can write P(X>12)=0.01 as P( (X - μ)/σ > (12 - μ)/σ )=0.01.

So, (12 - μ)/σ is the Z-score that cuts off the right tail at 0.01.

So, the Z-score for 0.01 is 2.33.

So, (12 - μ)/0.3=2.33.

So, μ=12 - (0.3 *2.33)=12-0.699=11.301.

But that would mean that the mean is lower than 12, which makes the probability of X>12 higher than 0.01.

So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about P(X>12)=0.01.

We can write this as P(X>12)=0.01.

Which can be written as P( (X - μ)/0.3 > (12 - μ)/0.3 )=0.01.

But (12 - μ)/0.3 is the Z-score. So, the probability that Z>z is 0.01.

So, z must be 2.33.

Therefore, (12 - μ)/0.3=2.33.

So, μ=12 - (0.3 *2.33)=12-0.699=11.301.

But in this case, the mean is 11.301, which is lower than 12, so the probability of X>12 should be higher than 0.01.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the Z-score for the upper tail as 2.33, which is correct.

Wait, but let me check with another approach.

We can think of P(X>12)=0.01.

Which is the same as P(X-μ <12 - μ)=0.01.

So, the left-hand side is P(X-μ <12 - μ)=0.01.

So, the variable (X-μ) is a normal variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.3.

So, the probability that (X-μ) < (12 - μ) is 0.01.

So, (X -μ) is a normal variable, so (X -μ) <k has probability 0.01.

So, the Z-score for k is (k -0)/0.3= k/0.3.

We want P(Z < z)=0.01, which requires z=2.33.

So, k=0.3*2.33=0.699.

So, (X -μ)=0.699.

Therefore, X=μ+0.699.

But we want P(X>12)=0.01.

So, μ+0.699>12.

So, μ>12 -0.699=11.301.

So, the mean must be greater than 11.301.

So, the correct mean is greater than 11.301, and the Z-score is 2.33.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, the mean is 11.301, but that's incorrect because that would make the Z-score negative.

Therefore, perhaps the correct mean is 12 - (0.3*2.33)=12-0.699=11.301, but that's incorrect because the probability would be higher than 0.01.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set the mean to 12.699, which is higher than 12, so that P(X>12)=0.01. So, the correct mean is 12.699.

Wait, but how do I get that from the options?

Looking back at the options:

Option I: 12.588.

Option C:12.6978.

So, the correct mean is 12.6978.

So, the correct option is C, but it uses a Z-score of 2.326, which is a Z-score for 97.5% confidence, which is for a two-tailed 5% significance level, but that's not what we need.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just go back to the initial problem.

The question is to find the mean such that P(X>12)=0.01.

We can write this as P(X>12)=0.01.

Which is the same as P(X-μ <12 - μ)=0.01.

So, the variable (X-μ) is a normal variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.3.

So, P((X-μ)/0.3 < (12 - μ)/0.3 )=0.01.

Which is equivalent to P(Z < (12 - μ)/0.3 )=0.01.

We can find the Z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.01, which is approximately -2.33.

So, (12 - μ)/0.3 = -2.33.

So, 12 - μ = -2.33 *0.3 = -0.699.

So, μ=12 - (-0.699)=12 +0.699=12.699.

So, the mean must be 12.699 to make the probability of X>12 equal to 0.01.

Looking at the options, none have 12.699. So, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 12.699 is the correct mean. Now, let's see how it compares to the options.

Option I:12.588.

Option C:12.6978.

Which is closer to 12.699?

Option C is 12.6978, which is 12.6978, which is 0.0018 less than 12.699.

Option I is 12.588, which is 0.111 more than 12.699.

So, option C is closer.

But the correct mean is 12.699, so none of the options is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me calculate it again.

We have:

(12 - μ)/0.3 = -2.33.

So, (12 - μ) = -2.33 *0.3 = -0.699.

So, 12 - μ = -0.699.

So, μ=12 +0.699=12.699.

So, correct mean is 12.699.

So, the correct answer is not listed, but looking at the options, option C is 12.6978, which is very close, but not exactly correct.

Wait, perhaps I can write the correct mean as option C plus 0.0018.

But I'm not sure that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but that's incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the Z-scores.

We need to find the Z-score that cuts off the upper tail at 0.01, which is 2.33.

So, the Z-score is 2.33.

So, the standard deviation is 0.3.

So, the difference between the mean and the value is Z * standard deviation.

So, the mean is μ =12 - (2.33 *0.3)=12-0.699=12.301.

Wait, but that would give a Z-score of 2.33, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, wait. If the mean is μ, then the Z-score for the value X is (X - μ)/σ.

So, to have P(X>12)=0.01, we need (X - μ) >12 - μ.

So, the Z-score for X=12 is (12 - μ)/0.3.

We need P(Z>z)=0.01, which requires z=2.33.

So, (12 - μ)/0.3=2.33.

So, 12 - μ=2.33*0.3=0.699.

So, μ=12 -0.699=11.301.

Wait, but that can't be correct because that would make the Z-score negative, which would imply a higher probability.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction of the inequality.

Let me re-express the equation:

(12 - μ)/0.3 = -2.33.

So, 12 - μ = (-2.33)(0.3)= -0.699.

So, μ=12 - (-0.699)=12 +0.699=12.699.

So, the mean is 12.699.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but that's incorrect.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should have set the mean to 12.699, but none of the options is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the Z-score for the upper tail is 2.33, so the Z-score is (12 - μ)/0.3 = 2.33.

So, 12 - μ=2.33*0.3=0.699.

So, μ=12 -0.699=11.301.

Wait, but that's incorrect because that would mean P(X>12)=0.01, but 11.301 is less than 12, so that would imply that the higher tail is on the left, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the Z-score for the lower tail as 2.33, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, the Z-score for the upper tail is 2.33, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the direction of the inequality.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation as:

P(X>12)=0.01.

So, X is a normal variable with mean μ and standard deviation σ=0.3.

We can write P(X>12)=0.01.

Which can be written as P(X-μ ≤12-μ)=0.01.

But X-μ is a normal variable with mean 0 and standard deviation σ=0.3.

So, P((X-μ)/σ < (12-μ)/σ )=0.01.

We want (12-μ)/σ = z, where z is the Z-score such that P(Z < z)=0.01, which is z=-2.33.

So, (12-μ)/0.3= -2.33.

So, 12-μ= -2.33 *0.3= -0.699.

So, μ=12 - (-0.699)=12 +0.699=12.699.

So, the mean must be 12.699.

So, the correct option is C:12.6978.

But 12.6978 is 0.0018 less than 12.699.

So, perhaps option C is the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct option is option I.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it again.

Wait, let me calculate (12 - μ)/0.3 = -2.33.

So, 12 - μ = -2.33 *0.3 = -0.699.

So, μ=12 - (-0.699)=12 +0.699=12.699.

So, yes, μ=12.699.

So, the correct mean is 12.699.

Now, looking at the options:

Option I:12.588.

Option C:12.6978.

So, how close is option C to 12.699?

The difference is 12.699 -12.6978=0.0012.

So, option C is 0.0012 less than the correct mean.

Option I is 12.588, which is 0.111 less.

So, option C is closer.

So, the answer is option C.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake because the correct mean is 12.699, so perhaps none of the options is correct, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the Z-score for each option and see which gives a P(X>12)=0.01.

Let's try that.

First, option I:12.588.

Calculate Z=(12 -12.588)/0.3= (-0.588)/0.3= -1.96.

So, the Z-score is -1.96.

We can find the P(X>12)=P(Z<-1.96)= the area to the left of -1.96, which is 0.025.

So, the probability is 0.025, which is less than 0.01. So, option I gives a probability less than 0.01.

So, option I is incorrect.

Option C:12.6978.

Calculate Z=(12 -12.6978)/0.3= (-0.6978)/0.3= -2.326.

So, Z=-2.326.

We can find P(X>12)=P(Z<-2.326)= the area to the left of -2.326.

Looking up in standard normal distribution table, Z=-2.326 corresponds to an area of approximately 0.01.

Wait, actually, the standard normal distribution table gives that for Z=-2.33, the area is 0.01. So, for Z=-2.326, it's slightly higher.

So, P(X>12)=0.01 approximately.

So, option C gives a probability of approximately 0.01, which is correct.

So, option C is the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct option is C.
</think>

To find the mean such that \( P(X>12) = 0.01 \), we can use the Z-score formula. The Z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.01 is approximately -2.33. Using this Z-score, we can calculate the required mean.

1. **Calculate the Z-score:**
   \[
   Z = \frac{12 - \mu}{0.3} = -2.33
   \]
   
2. **Solve for the mean (\( \mu \)):**
   \[
   12 - \mu = -2.33 \times 0.3
   \]
   \[
   12 - \mu = -0.699
   \]
   \[
   \mu = 12 + 0.699 = 12.699
   \]
   
3. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option I: \( 12.588 \) (too low)
   - Option C: \( 12.6978 \) (very close to \( 12.699 \))

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
