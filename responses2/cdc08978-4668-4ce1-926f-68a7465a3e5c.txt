Okay, so I've got this problem about a savings account earning compound interest, and I need to figure out the final balance and the total interest earned. Hmm, let me break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says the account starts with $2000. It earns 4% interest, compounded quarterly, for three years. Then, after that, it earns 5% interest, compounded semiannually, for the next two years. I need to calculate the final amount and the interest earned over the entire period.

I remember the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount after time t,
- P is the principal amount,
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal),
- n is the number of times interest is compounded per year,
- t is the time in years.

So for the first part, the initial investment is $2000, rate is 4%, compounded quarterly. That means n=4, and t=3 years. Let's compute that.

Calculating the first part:
r = 4% = 0.04
n = 4
t = 3
P = 2000

So plugging into the formula:

A1 = 2000 * (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3)
Calculate 0.04/4 first: that's 0.01.
So inside the parentheses: 1 + 0.01 = 1.01
Exponent is 4*3 = 12, so 1.01^12.

I might need to compute 1.01^12. Let me think. I remember that 1.01^12 is approximately 1.126825 (but maybe I should calculate it more accurately). Alternatively, I can use the table factor method, since the question mentions using the table factor for 6 decimals. Wait, the problem says to use the table factor for 6 decimals. So maybe I should look up the factor for 4% compounded quarterly over 3 years.

Wait, the table factor is usually given as (1 + r/n)^(nt) rounded to six decimal places. So for the first part, I need to find this factor.

r = 4% = 0.04
n=4, t=3
Table factor = (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3) = (1.01)^12.

I think (1.01)^12 is approximately 1.126825. Let me confirm that. Well, 1.01^1 is 1.01, 2 is about 1.0201, 3 is about 1.0303, 4 is about 1.0406, 5 is about 1.0510, 6 is about 1.0615, 7 is 1.0721, 8 is 1.0828, 9 is 1.0938, 10 is 1.1049, 11 is 1.1159, 12 is 1.1268. So the factor is 1.1268, but since we need six decimals, it's 1.126825.

So A1 = 2000 * 1.126825 = let's calculate that. 2000 * 1 is 2000, 2000 * 0.126825 is 2000 * 0.126825 = 253.65. So total is 2000 + 253.65 = $2253.65.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have $2253.65 as the first part. Let me check the options. Option F is 2253.65 as the first part, and the interest earned would be F's balance minus 2000, which is 253.65. But wait, looking at the options, option F is '2253.65' and '253.65', which would mean the interest is 253.65. But I'm not sure if that's correct yet because I might have miscalculated.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, if A1 is $2253.65, then the interest earned in the first three years is 2253.65 - 2000 = 253.65. Then, in the next two years, it's 5% interest, compounded semiannually. Let me compute that.

So for the second part, P is now 2253.65. The rate is 5%, compounded semiannually. So n=2, t=2.

A2 = 2253.65 * (1 + 0.05/2)^(2*2)
Calculate 0.05/2 = 0.025.
So inside: 1 + 0.025 = 1.025
Exponent: 2*2=4, so 1.025^4.

I think 1.025^4 is approximately 1.103813 (using a calculator, but I'll just compute it step by step):
1.025^2 = (1.025)(1.025) = 1.050625
Then, (1.050625)^2 = 1.103812890625, which is approximately 1.103813.

So the factor is 1.103813. So A2 = 2253.65 * 1.103813.

Let me compute that. 2253.65 * 1.103813.

First, 2253.65 * 1 = 2253.65
2253.65 * 0.103813 ≈ Let me compute 2253.65 * 0.1 = 225.365
2253.65 * 0.003813 ≈ Approximately 2253.65 * 0.0038 ≈ 8.562.

Adding those together: 225.365 + 8.562 = 233.927.

So total A2 = 2253.65 + 233.927 ≈ 2487.577.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 2253.65 * 1.103813 = 2253.65 + (2253.65 * 0.103813)

Compute 2253.65 * 0.103813:

Break it down:

2253.65 * 0.1 = 225.365

2253.65 * 0.003813 ≈ 2253.65 * 0.003 = 6.76095, and 2253.65 * 0.000813 ≈ approximately 1.833.

Adding those: 6.76095 + 1.833 ≈ 8.59395.

So total interest for the second part is 225.365 + 8.59395 ≈ 233.95895.

Adding to the principal: 2253.65 + 233.95895 ≈ 2487.60895.

So approximately $2487.61.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is $2487.61 as the first part, and $487.61 as the interest. So the total balance would be 2000 + 487.61 = 2487.61.

Hmm, but wait, in the first calculation, when I computed A1, I thought it was 2253.65, but when I compute the second part, the final balance is approximately 2487.61, which matches option A.

So the final balance is 2487.61, and the total interest earned is 487.61.

Looking at the options, option A is both 2487.61 and 487.61. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. First part: 4% annual, quarterly. 3 years.

A1 = 2000*(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3) = 2000*(1.01)^12.

I think (1.01)^12 is 1.126825, so 2000 * 1.126825 = 2253.65. Correct.

Then, the next two years at 5% semiannual compounding.

A2 = 2253.65*(1 + 0.05/2)^4 = 2253.65*(1.025)^4.

1.025^4 is approximately 1.103813, so 2253.65 * 1.103813 ≈ 2487.61.

The interest earned is 2487.61 - 2000 = 487.61.

So the final answer is $2487.61 and $487.61, which is option A.

The final balance in the savings account is $2487.61, and the total interest earned is $487.61.
