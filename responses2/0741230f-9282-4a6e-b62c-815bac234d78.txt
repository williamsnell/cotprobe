Okay, so I've got this question about electromagnetic waves and their speed. Hmm, I remember from physics that there's something called the speed of light. But wait, let me think more carefully.

The question is asking what the speed of an electromagnetic wave in empty space is. I think I remember that in a vacuum, light travels at a constant speed, right? Oh yeah, that's the famous speed of light. So the options are given in meters per second, which is a big number.

Looking at the options: A is 3e8, which is 3 times 1e8. B is half of that, 1.5e8. C is 5e8, which is higher than light speed. D is 2.5e8, which is lower. E is 3.5e8, higher again. F is 3.25e8, still higher. G is 2.75e8, lower. H is 1e8, which is a tenth, way too low. I is 4e8, which is even higher than I thought. J is 2e8, which is lower.

Wait, I think the speed of light is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second. So option A is 3e8, which sounds right. But why are the other options there? Maybe some other constants are close, like the speed of an electron or something else. Oh, wait! No, because for light in a vacuum, it's the speed of light. Electromagnetic waves (like visible light) travel at this constant speed regardless of their frequency or wavelength. So the correct answer is definitely A.

The speed of an electromagnetic wave in empty space is the speed of light, which is approximately \( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/sec} \). This corresponds to option A. 

Answer: A
