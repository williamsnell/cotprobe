Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about executive orders. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement is NOT true. Let's break it down.

First, I remember that executive orders are a component of the U.S. Constitution. They were created by the 13th Amendment in 1941. They have the power to impact daily life, like laws and policies. So, they're not the same as Congress's laws because Congress acts under the U.S. Constitution, while executive orders are directly part of the Constitution.

Looking at the options:

Option A says presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions. I think that's correct because, as I recall, the 13th Amendment was meant to prevent executive actions that could hurt the country's interests. So, the president probably avoids using them when it could cause problems.

Option B states that executive orders have the same effect as Congress's laws. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Executive orders are the tool the president uses, but Congress can override them with laws. So, while the executive orders are the basis for laws, the executive orders themselves don't have the same effect as Congress's laws. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C claims that presidents have made increased use since the 1970s. I believe that's true. The 1976 election and subsequent years saw more executive orders, like the Civil Rights Act and the Waterfront Act, which were implemented. So C is a correct statement.

Option D says executive orders bypass congressional approval. That's exactly what I was thinking earlier. The executive branch's laws can override Congress's laws, so yes, D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is B. Because while the executive orders are a tool, the overall effect is governed by Congress. The executive orders themselves don't have the same impact as Congress's laws; Congress can pass laws that override them.

The incorrect statement is B. Executive orders are the tool the president uses, but they don't have the same effect as Congress's laws, which can override them. 

Answer: B
