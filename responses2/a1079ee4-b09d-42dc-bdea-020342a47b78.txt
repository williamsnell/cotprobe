Okay, so I've got this question about group theory, specifically about the unit group U_8. I'm a bit rusty on my abstract algebra, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what's U_8? I remember that U_n refers to the multiplicative group of integers modulo n that are relatively prime to n. So U_8 is the set of numbers less than 8 and coprime to 8. Let me list them out. The numbers less than 8 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Which of these are coprime to 8? Well, 8 is 2^3, so any number not divisible by 2 will be coprime. So 1,3,5,7. So U_8 has four elements: {1,3,5,7}.

Now the question is about the order of the element 5 in U_8. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer m such that (element)^m â‰¡ 1 mod n. So here, we're dealing with exponents in modulo 8.

Let me compute the powers of 5 modulo 8 until I get back to 1. 

First, 5^1 mod8 is 5. Not 1. 
Then 5^2 =25 mod8. 25 divided by 8 is 3*8=24, remainder 1. So 25 mod8 is 1. So 5 squared is 1 mod8. 

So the order of 5 is 2 because 5^2 is 1. Looking at the options, option F is 2, so that should be the answer.

Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. 5 squared is 25, which is 3*8=24, so 25-24=1. Yep, that's right. So the order is 2. So the correct option is F.

The order of the element 5 in U_8 is 2.
