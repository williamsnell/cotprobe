Okay, so I've got this question about asymptotic notations and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking which of the given functions grows the fastest as n increases. The options are A to H. 

Let me think about each option. I remember that in computer science, when we talk about the growth rate of functions, we're comparing how quickly each function's output increases as n gets large. The asymptotic notation here is Big-O, which describes the upper bound of the function's growth rate.

So, looking at the options:

A: O(n²) → This is a quadratic function. It grows faster than linear functions but slower than any exponential function.
B: O(n³) → Cubic function, which is faster than quadratic. It's still very slow compared to exponential functions.
C: O(sqrt(n)) → Square root function, which grows much slower than linear or higher-order functions like O(n²) or O(n³).
D: O(2^n) → Exponential function. This grows much faster than any polynomial function. It's one of the fastest growing functions here.
E: O(log n) → Logarithmic function, which grows much slower than any polynomial function. It's the slowest among the polynomial options.
F: O(n log n) → This is a bit slower than O(n²) because it's O(n) multiplied by O(log n). For example, 10n log n is still O(n²) but perhaps not as optimized as O(n²) for large n.
G: O(log log n) → Very slow, even slower than O(log n).
H: O(1) → Constant time function, grows the slowest.
I: O(n) → Linear function, grows faster than O(log n) but slower than O(n log n).

Now, the question is asking which is the largest asymptotically. So, we're looking for the function that grows the fastest.

Between the exponential functions, O(2^n) is definitely faster than O(n^k) for any fixed k. So, D is very fast. Then, F is O(n log n), which is a bit faster than linear but not as fast as exponential.

Wait, but O(2^n) is way faster than O(n^3), which is option B. So, between D and F, D is the fastest. Then, the next is F, which is O(n log n), which is still way behind D.

So the order from fastest to slowest is D (2^n), F (n log n), B (n^3), A (n^2), I (n), H (1), C (sqrt(n)), E (log n), G (log log n).

So the largest is option D, O(2^n).

The largest asymptotically among the given functions is O(2^n), which grows the fastest as n increases.
