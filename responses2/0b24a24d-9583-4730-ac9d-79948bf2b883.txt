Question:

William Safire in American Heritage Magazine (December 1987): ...The greatness of Lincoln was his purposefulness. He saw something that few others saw: that the democratic experiment centered on the Union and that majority rule was everything. The minute you allowed secession, you made democracy an absurdity---because what would happen would be continued subdivision.

Options:

A: Questionable Analogy
B: Red Herring
C: Appeal to Ignorance
D: Appeal to Authority
E: Ad Hominem
F: Slippery Slope
G: Circular Argument
H: False Dilemma
I: Straw Man
J: Hasty Generalization

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about William Safire in American Heritage Magazine from 1987. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a paragraph from an article about William Safire. The paragraph talks about his view on Lincoln's greatness being his purposefulness, particularly his belief that the Union was the key to majority rule. He argues that if secession happens, it would continue to divide, which would be a problem for democracy.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match this reasoning to one of the given legal fallacies or arguments. The options are from A to J, each representing a different logical fallacy or argument.

Let me go through each option:

A: Questionable Analogy – This is when the argument is made by comparing something (like the Union) to another situation ( Lincoln) without sufficient justification. So, if the analogy isn't good, this is a fallacy. The paragraph doesn't use a comparison, just a description, so maybe not A.

B: Red Herring – This is when you bring something up that doesn't support your main point. The paragraph is about Safire's argument, so unless there's a red herring, it's not B. I don't think so.

C: Appeal to Ignorance – This is when you use the lack of knowledge to support your argument. The paragraph explains that the Union is key, not just citing ignorance. So, maybe not C.

D: Appeal to Authority – This is using the authority of a person to make a point. The paragraph doesn't cite any authority; it's just a description. So maybe D is not applicable.

E: Ad Hominem – This is attacking the person's character, not the argument itself. The paragraph is about Safire's reasoning, not his character. So E doesn't fit.

F: Slippery Slope – This is where someone argues that one small factor leads to a big, catastrophic result. The paragraph suggests that secession would lead to continued division, which could be a slippery slope. That seems to match.

G: Circular Argument – This is when the conclusion is stated as a premise. The paragraph starts by discussing Lincoln and then concludes about the impact of secession, which doesn't seem to form a circle.

H: False Dilemma – This is when only two options are presented, making it seem like a binary choice. The paragraph doesn't present two options but describes the implications of secession, not a binary choice.

I: Straw Man – This is when someone distorts an opponent's argument. The paragraph compares Lincoln to the Union, so maybe not an I fallacy.

J: Hasty Generalization – This is making a broad conclusion from a small sample. The paragraph doesn't make any such claim; it's just a description of the scenario.

Putting it all together, the paragraph uses a comparison (the Union) to make a point about majority rule. This is a type of reasoning, not a logical fallacy, but it's the basis for the argument presented. The most fitting fallacy here is the slippery slope because the argument relies on the idea that secession could lead to massive division, which is a slippery slope scenario.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the reasoning Safire used. The paragraph describes his argument, not the reasoning mechanism. So, the reasoning mechanism is the comparison, but the fallacy is the type of argument presented. So, the reasoning is a comparison, not a fallacy.

Wait again, I'm a bit confused. The question is about what fallacy the reasoning is an instance of. The paragraph's reasoning is about the comparison, which is used as a justification. So, the reasoning is a comparison, which isn't a fallacy, but the fallacy is the slippery slope because the argument is made on the basis of that comparison.

Alternatively, the fallacy the reasoning itself is trying to present is the slippery slope, because it's using a cause (the Union's success leading to majority rule) to suggest a chain reaction (secession leading to division).

So, the correct answer should be F: Slippery Slope.

The paragraph describes William Safire's argument by comparing Lincoln to the Union, suggesting that if secession occurred, it would lead to continued division, a slippery slope. This type of reasoning is best identified as the slippery slope argument.

Answer: F
