Okay, so I've got this economics question about price discrimination and when it arises. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Price discrimination is when a seller charges different prices to different customers based on their willingness to pay. I remember that for this to happen, the seller must have some control over the price, like being able to set prices without affecting the quantity. Also, I think I remember something about the demand curve being different for each buyer. Maybe it's when the seller can segment the market into groups with different elasticities.

Wait, the question is about when the opportunity for price discrimination arises. So, when can a seller do that? I think it's when the market isn't too fragmented. Like, if there are too many different groups, the seller can't set the right price for each. So, the market structure must be one where the seller can create distinct groups with different price elasticities.

I remember that for price discrimination, the seller must have some degree of market power, which means the demand curve can be manipulated. Also, the seller has to be able to prevent other sellers from entering the market, so the market isn't too competitive. Otherwise, the seller can't charge different prices because other sellers might offer the same product at a lower price.

Looking at the options:

A: market segments with relatively elastic demand pay lower prices. Hmm, that doesn't sound right because if demand is elastic, a small change in price leads to a big change in quantity. But for price discrimination, maybe the seller wants to charge higher than the market price, so lower prices would mean less revenue. Not sure.

B: consumer surplus increases. Wait, if the seller can charge higher prices, consumer surplus (the difference between what consumers pay and what they're willing to pay) would increase. But wait, price discrimination is when the seller charges more than the market price, so consumer surplus increases. So, B might be correct.

C: market becomes perfectly competitive. No, because perfect competition isn't price discrimination. It's about many buyers and sellers, and price equals marginal cost. Price discrimination is about charging different prices, so C is probably not the answer.

D: all consumers pay same price. No, that's perfect competition, not price discrimination. So D is wrong.

E: consumer surplus decreases. No, wait. If a seller charges higher prices, the consumer surplus increases because the difference increases. So E is incorrect.

F: market segments with relatively inelastic demand pay lower prices. I'm not sure. Inelastic demand is when price changes don't affect quantity much. If demand is inelastic, a price increase is less likely to reduce quantity. But if the seller can set a higher price, maybe the price would be higher. So F might be incorrect.

G: market segments with relatively elastic demand pay higher prices. That makes sense. If demand is elastic, a small change in price affects quantity significantly. If the seller can set a higher price, the quantity sold would drop, but since demand is elastic, the revenue (price * quantity) might be higher than the market price. So G sounds correct.

H: demand becomes vertical. Vertical demand would mean quantity doesn't respond to price changes. That's more like perfect elasticity, which doesn't apply here. So H is incorrect.

I: demand is horizontal. Horizontal demand is perfectly inelastic, meaning quantity doesn't respond to price. That's also not applicable for price discrimination. So I is wrong.

So, the options that make sense are B and G. But wait, the question asks when the opportunity arises. So it's when the seller can set different prices, which is when the market allows for price discrimination. That's when the demand isn't too fragmented. So in the case of G, when elastic demand, the seller can charge higher prices, which would be the opportunity for price discrimination.

Wait, let me think again. If the demand is elastic, a seller can possibly extract a higher price because they can set a higher price without losing too many customers. So G says "market segments with relatively elastic demand pay higher prices." That's correct.

So the correct answer would be G and B. Wait, no. Let me re-read the options.

Wait, the question is a single correct answer. Oh, wait, the question is about when the opportunity for price discrimination arises. So the condition for price discrimination is that the seller can segment the market. So the market should be such that the seller can set prices in different segments.

So the options that indicate when price discrimination is possible are when the market is fragmented enough. So the situation where the market segments have varying elasticities.

Looking back, the options are A to I. The correct ones are when the market allows price discrimination, which is when the seller can set different prices to different groups. That would be when the market is such that the demand is not too fragmented, so the seller can price discriminate.

So, for example, if the market is such that there are different segments with different elasticities, then price discrimination is possible. So the opportunity arises when the market allows the seller to do this, which is when the demand is not too fragmented.

So the correct options are B and G.

Wait, the question is what's the situation when the opportunity arises, so the condition is that the seller can price discriminate, which occurs when the market is such that demand is not too concentrated, allowing for price differentiation.

So, in terms of the options, when the segments have relatively elastic demand, G is correct. Also, B says consumer surplus increases, but the question is about when the opportunity arises, not the outcome.

Wait the question is about when the opportunity for price discrimination arises. So when is price discrimination possible?

So the correct answer is that the opportunity arises when the market allows for price discrimination, which is when the market is fragmented enough, allowing the seller to set different prices for different segments. So the condition is that the market is not too fragmented, and the seller can price discriminate.

So the options that are correct are G and B. But the options are mutually exclusive. Wait, in the options, G is "market segments with relatively elastic demand pay higher prices." That's correct. B says consumer surplus increases.

But the question is asking when price discrimination arises, not what happens as a result. So when the opportunity arises, which is when the seller can price discriminate.

So the correct answer is when the market is fragmented enough, allowing the seller to set different prices. So the correct options are G and B.

Wait, but the options are single letters. So looking back:

The options are A to I, each a statement.

So the question is when the opportunity for price discrimination arises. So the condition is that the market is fragmented enough for the seller to price discriminate. So when the segments are such that the seller can do that.

Looking at the options, G says "market segments with relatively elastic demand pay higher prices." That's correct. So the opportunity arises when the market allows for price discrimination, which is when segments are elastic.

So the correct answer is G. Because G is a correct statement about when price discrimination is possible.
</think>

Price discrimination occurs when a seller charges different prices to different customers based on their willingness to pay, typically by segmenting the market. This is possible when the market is fragmented enough, allowing the seller to set higher prices for some segments and lower prices for others. The correct answer must reflect this condition.

- **A**: Incorrect. While lower prices might occur, this does not explain when price discrimination is possible.
- **B**: Incorrect. Consumer surplus increases when prices are set higher, but this does not describe the condition for price discrimination.
- **C**: Incorrect. A perfectly competitive market is not price discrimination.
- **D**: Incorrect. All consumers paying the same price is the definition of perfect competition, not price discrimination.
- **E**: Incorrect. Price discrimination leads to higher consumer surplus, not lower.
- **F**: Incorrect. Inelastic demand does not allow price discrimination.
- **G**: Correct. Relatively elastic demand allows the seller to set higher prices in certain segments.
- **H**: Incorrect. A vertical demand curve is not applicable.
- **I**: Incorrect. A horizontal demand curve is not relevant to price discrimination.

The correct answer is **G**, as it accurately describes the condition under which price discrimination is possible. 

**ANSWER: G**
