Question:

 What two problems does individualism lead us into, according to Hourdequin?

Options:

A: They lead us into "tragedy of the commons" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.
B: It leads to a decline in societal values and the rise of selfish behavior.
C: It encourages a culture of isolation and self-centeredness, and leads to a lack of community engagement.
D: It leads to the breakdown of social structures and the erosion of collective responsibility.
E: It leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased consumption of non-recyclable goods.
F: It leads to a lack of empathy and understanding of others, and an increase in individualistic behavior.
G: It results in increased consumption and waste, and a disregard for the environment.
H: It leads to failures of developing integration and integrality.
I: We both tend to think of our moral obligations as only personal obligations, and so think that we can only advocate for policy in "tragedy of the commons" situations.
J: It promotes competition over cooperation and leads to societal fragmentation.

Alright, so I've got this question about_hourdequin's work and the two problems he leads us into. I'm a bit rusty on his theories, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is a multiple-choice one, and the options are from A to J. Each option pairs two issues or one issue with a description. I remember that Hourdequin was a philosopher, probably a philosopher of society, and he wrote about ethics, individualism, and collective behavior.

The question asks what two problems individualism leads us into, according to him. The options are A to J. I need to recall what he's known for. From what I remember, Hourdequin is often associated with the "problem of individualism," which he saw as a problematic way of thinking about society. He criticized the idea that individuals should act in their own self-interest, leading to collective problems.

I think he talked about two main issues: one is the "problem of the commons," where individual actions deplete a shared resource, leading to environmental problems and collective bads. The other is the "problem of individualism," which is about how individual actions can lead to collective outcomes that are worse or even destructive.

Wait, but the options are about what two problems individualism leads us into. So perhaps the two issues are the breakdown of social structures and the erosion of collective responsibility.

Looking at the options, option D says: "It leads to the breakdown of social structures and the erosion of collective responsibility." That sounds right because individualism often leads to people acting in their own self-interest, which can lead to a society where it's hard to maintain social order because everyone's actions are not for the common good. Also, collective responsibility—like environmental issues—get diluted because each individual's actions don't account for the bigger picture.

Other options: Option A talks about tragedy of the commons and atomism. I'm not sure about the connection there. The tragedy of the commons is more about resource management, I think. Atomism refers to the idea that people are just atoms, which is a concept that's more of a philosophy or part of individualism, not necessarily a problem with individualism.

Option B says decline in societal values and selfish behavior. That might be from another philosopher or theory, like Karl Marx, who talked about individualism leading to a lack of collective values. But I'm not sure if that's what Hourdequin said. I think he focused more on the breakdown of social structures and collective responsibility.

Option C talks about isolation and self-centeredness leading to lack of community engagement. That might be more about individualism leading to individualism, not the breakdown of structures. I'm not sure if it's an issue he specifically addressed.

Option E is about increased emissions and non-recyclable goods. That sounds more like environmental issues, possibly from environmentalism, which is a different perspective, not necessarily from Hourdequin.

Option F: Lack of empathy and increased individualism. I'm not sure if that's what he said. Maybe some other thinkers, but I don't recall him talking about empathy in this context.

Option G: Increased consumption and waste, disregard for environment. This seems like more environmental issues, not about individualism leading to breakdowns.

Option H: Failures of integration and integrality. Integration in philosophy is about bringing different aspects together, but I'm not sure if that's one of his main issues.

Option I: Think of moral obligations as only personal. That might relate to individualism, but I'm not sure if it's the two main problems he identified.

Option J: Competition over cooperation and societal fragmentation. That sounds more like a debate about cooperation and competition in social structures. I don't think that's what Hourdequin said.

So, putting it together, I think the correct answer is D: It leads to the breakdown of social structures and the erosion of collective responsibility. I've heard that before in the context of individualism and its implications. For example, how when individuals act in self-interest, society fails to maintain social cohesion because each person's actions don't contribute to the bigger good. This leads to the breakdown of social structures and makes collective responsibility eroded, as each person's responsibility is diminished.

The correct answer is:

**D: It leads to the breakdown of social structures and the erosion of collective responsibility.**

**Explanation:**
Hourdequin's work, particularly his critique of individualism, highlights two significant problems. First, it leads to the breakdown of social structures as individuals act in their own self-interest, often resulting in a lack of collective cohesion. Second, it erodes collective responsibility, as each person's actions do not adequately contribute to the greater good. This perspective emphasizes the limitations of individualistic approaches in maintaining social order and environmental sustainability.
