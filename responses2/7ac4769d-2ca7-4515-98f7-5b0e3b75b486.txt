Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A bacterial culture is divided into two halves, A and B, and bothhalves receive large but equal amounts of ultraviolet light. Culture B is then wrapped in brown paper to isolate it fromany light. Culture A is left unprotected from the incident visiblelight. After 24 hours the cultures are examined. Culture A shows much more growth than culture B. Explain.

Options:

A: Culture B was wrapped in brown paper, hampering its growth.
B: Culture A benefited from additional warmth provided by the incident visible light, promoting growth.
C: Culture A's cellular metabolism was enhanced by the visible light, leading to faster reproduction and growth compared to Culture B.
D: Culture B's lack of light triggered a dormancy state, while Culture A continued to grow due to its active state.
E: Culture B's growth was inhibited by the brown paper itself, which contained chemicals toxic to the bacteria.
F: Culture A produced more protective pigments in response to the visible light, which helped it grow more than Culture B.
G: Culture B's excision repair system was more efficient than Culture A's photoreactivation system.
H: Culture B consumed nutrients more quickly in the absence of light, leading to nutrient depletion and reduced growth.
I: Culture A's photoreactivation system was allowed to work because of its exposure to light. Culture B, because it was left in the dark, had to rely on its excision repair system alone, which may have been damaged by the UV light, making it inoperative.
J: Culture A grew more due to the exposure to visible light.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about bacterial culture growth under UV light. Hmm. So, there are two cultures, A and B. Both get a large amount of UV light. But culture B is wrapped in brown paper to isolate from light. Culture A is left unprotected.

After 24 hours, A has much more growth than B. Why is that?

Wait, I remember that UV light affects bacteria. Oh right, UV light can cause cell rotation, which might help them grow better. Also, some bacteria produce substances that help them grow. Oh, like proteins or pigments that help them absorb light or something. 

So, in culture B, they're wrapped in brown paperâ€”maybe they're being exposed to UV light indirectly. Or perhaps the paper is made of pigments. Like, if the paper has a certain color, it might absorb UV light. That would mean the bacteria aren't getting the direct UV exposure. 

Alternatively, the proteins on the paper could be helping the bacteria. So, when they're in the dark, maybe the bacteria can't produce these protective proteins, so their growth is slower. Or maybe the UV light induces a beneficial change in culture A, like they develop a defense mechanism or something.

Wait, another possibility is that the bacteria in culture A are more active because the light is causing them to rotate their cells. This is called photoreactivation. When cells are rotated, they can take up nutrients better, and the bacteria become more resistant to other chemicals, including UV. So, even though culture A isn't directly exposed to UV, the rotation helps their growth.

Looking at the options, option I says that culture A's photoreactivation system was allowed to work because of their exposure to light. And culture B had to rely on their excision repair system, which might not have been as efficient. So, that makes sense.

So, the correct answer would be I, right? Because the UV light caused the cells in A to rotate, enhancing their growth, while B's cells didn't get the same benefit.

The growth difference between cultures A and B can be attributed to the effect of UV light on bacterial cell rotation and nutrient absorption. Culture A, left in direct UV exposure, benefits from photoreactivation, where the rotation of cells enhances nutrient uptake and resistance to UV. In contrast, culture B, in the dark, relies on its excision repair system, which is less efficient under UV conditions. This results in culture A growing more effectively.
