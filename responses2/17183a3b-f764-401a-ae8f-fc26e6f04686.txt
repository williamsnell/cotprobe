Okay, so I've got this question about waist circumference and jean sizes. Let me try to figure it out. The question says that Owen currently has blue jeans with a 32-inch waist, and his waist circumference increases by 15%. I need to find out what the new waist size he has to wear, rounded to the nearest inch.

First, I remember that waist size is usually measured in inches, but sometimes circumference is used, especially for larger sizes. Wait, but the question specifically mentions the waist circumference, so I think we're talking about circumference here. But I'm a bit confused because usually, waist size refers to the measurement of the fabric, not the actual circumference. Hmm, but maybe for simplicity, the question is using the term "waist circumference" to mean the size of the fabric, so I'll proceed with that.

So, Owen's current waist is 32 inches. The increase is 15%. I should calculate 15% of 32 inches and add it to the original size.

Let me calculate 15% of 32. 15% is the same as 0.15. So 0.15 * 32 = 4.8 inches. Wait, but wait, that's 15% of 32. So the increase is 4.8 inches. So the new circumference would be 32 + 4.8 = 36.8 inches.

But wait, waist sizes are in whole inches, right? So 36.8 inches would round to 37 inches. So the new waist size Owen has to wear would be 37 inches. Looking at the options, option J is 37 inches. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, sometimes when converting waist sizes from inches to centimeters, but wait, the question is about inches. Let me double-check. The question says "waist circumference increases by 15%." So the increase is in circumference, not in inches.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the waist size refers to the fabric measurement or the circumference. Oh wait, the question says "waist circumference," so I think it's the circumference that's increasing. So the original waist is 32 inches, as per the question, so the new size would be 32 + 15% of 32 = 36.8 inches. Rounded to the nearest whole inch is 37 inches. That's option J.

The waist circumference increases by 15%, calculated as 0.15 * 32 = 4.8 inches. Adding this to the original 32 inches gives 36.8 inches, which rounds to 37 inches. The correct answer is J: 37 inches.

Answer: J
