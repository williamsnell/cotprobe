Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the density of a potassium nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. I remember density is mass over volume. Right, so I need to find the mass and the volume of the nucleus, then divide mass by volume.

The question gives me some data. The atomic radius of potassium is about 4e-13 cm. Wait, 4 times 10^-13 centimeters. Oh, and the number of nuclei is 6.02e23, which rings a bell—it's Avogadro's number. And the mass of these nuclei is about 39 grams. Oh, wait, 39 grams is the mass of all the potassium nuclei combined.

So, first, I need the volume of one nucleus. Since it's a sphere, the volume formula is (4/3)πr³. They already told us to use that. But wait, the radius is given for the atomic nucleus, right? So r is 4e-13 cm.

Let's compute the volume step by step. Volume = (4/3) * π * (4e-13 cm)^3. Let me compute that.

First, (4e-13)^3 is 64e-39, because (4^3 is 64) and (1e-13)^3 is 1e-39. Multiply by π gives 64e-39 * π. So the volume is (4/3) * 64e-39 * π. Let me calculate that numerically.

Wait, but maybe I should handle the exponents first. 4/3 * 64 is (4*64)/3 = 256/3 ≈85.333. Multiply by π: 85.333 * 3.1416 ≈ 267.45. So the volume is approximately 267.45e-39 cm³. Because 64e-39 * (4/3)*π ≈ 267.45e-39 cm³.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that step. The initial (4/3) * π * (r^3) — so (4/3) is multiplied by π, which is about 3.1416. So (4/3)*π is approximately 4.1888. So 4.1888 * (64e-39 cm³) = 4.1888 * 64e-39.

Wait, 4 * 64 is 256, 0.1888 *64 is about 12.05, so total is 256 +12.05=268.05. So 268.05e-39 cm³. So volume is approximately 2.6805e-37 cm³? Wait, wait, wait. Because 64e-39 multiplied by 4.1888 is 268.05e-39, which is 2.6805e-37 cm³? Wait, no: 64e-39 is 6.4e-38, and 4.1888 *6.4e-38 is 26.8e-38, which is 2.68e-37 cm³. Yes, so the volume for one nucleus is about 2.68e-37 cm³.

Wait, let me double-check that. 4/3 is approximately 1.3333. So 1.3333 * π is ~4.1888. Multiply that by (4e-13 cm)^3, which is 64e-39 cm³. 4.1888 *64= approx 268.05. So 268.05e-39 cm³. Which is 2.6805e-37 cm³. Yeah.

Wait, but wait, 64e-39 is 64 * 1e-39. Multiply by 4.1888 gives 64 *4.1888 = 268.05, so 268.05e-39 is 2.6805e-37 cm³. Correct.

So the volume of one nucleus is about 2.68e-37 cm³.

But wait, how many nuclei are there? 6.02e23. So the total mass of the nucleus is 6.02e23 nuclei times the mass per nucleus. The total mass is 39 grams. So each nucleus has a mass of 39 grams / 6.02e23 nuclei.

Calculating that: 39 /6.02e23 grams per nucleus. Let me compute that.

39 /6.02e23 = (39 /6.02) * 1e-23 grams. 39/6.02 is approximately 6.467. So 6.467e-24 grams per nucleus.

Wait, but wait, to get density, which is mass/volume, I need to compute the mass in kg or grams and then divide by volume in cm³.

So, 39 grams is 0.039 kg. Or keeping in grams, perhaps. Let's see.

Wait, but wait. The density is mass divided by volume. So I'll get the mass in grams, and volume in cm³, then convert grams to kg by dividing by 1000 to get kg/cm³, then convert to tons/cm³ by dividing by 1000 again (since 1 ton = 1000 kg).

Wait, maybe let's handle this step by step.

First, total mass is 39 grams. So 39 grams.

Volume is 2.68e-37 cm³ per nucleus, times 6.02e23 nuclei.

So total volume is 2.68e-37 *6.02e23 = let's compute that.

2.68e-37 *6.02e23 = multiply 2.68 *6.02 = approx 16.11. And exponents: 1e-37 *1e23 = 1e-14. So total volume is 16.11e-14 cm³ = 1.611e-13 cm³.

Wait, that's the volume of the entire nucleus, right? Because each nucleus is that volume.

So now, density is mass/volume = 39 grams / 1.611e-13 cm³.

Wait, 39 grams is 0.039 kg. But perhaps keeping it in grams is easier.

So 39 / 1.611e-13 grams per cm³.

Wait, 39 /1.611e-13 is approximately 24.19e13 grams/cm³. Because 39 /1.611 is about 24.19.

Wait, 39 divided by 1.611e-13 is 39/(1.611e-13) = 39 /1.611 * 1e13 = (24.19) *1e13 = 2.419e14 grams/cm³.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately. 39 / 1.611e-13 = 39 /1.611 * 1e13 = (approx 24.19) * 1e13 = 2.419e14 grams per cm³.

But to get to tons per cm³, I have to convert grams to tons. Because 1 ton is 1000 kg, which is 1e6 grams. So 2.419e14 grams is (2.419e14) / (1e6) = 2.419e8 tons per cm³.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me think—what's the actual value.

Wait, 39 grams divided by 1.611e-13 cm³ equals 2.419e14 grams per cm³. 2.419e14 grams is 2.419e14 / 1e6 = 2.419e8 tons per cm³.

Wait, but that gives 2.4e8 tons/cm³. But none of the options have that. Let's look back at the options.

Options are A: 8.2e-2, B: 9.3e-8, C: 1.6e-13, D: 5.6e14, E:7.5e6, F:2.7e8, G:6.02e23, H:4.3e-5, I:1e12, J:3.9e2.

Wait, my calculation comes to around 2.4e8 tons/cm³. But that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the volume calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the volume. Let me re-do the volume calculation.

Radius r =4e-13 cm. Volume is (4/3)πr³.

r³ = (4e-13)^3 = 64e-39 cm³.

(4/3)π = approx 4.1888.

So volume is 4.1888 *64e-39 = 268.05e-39 cm³ = 2.6805e-37 cm³ per nucleus.

Wait, but wait, 4e-13 is 4e-13, so cube is (4^3) (1e-13)^3 =64e-39. So yes.

So total volume is 6.02e23 * 2.68e-37 cm³ = (6.02 *2.68) *1e23 *1e-37.

6.02 *2.68 is approx 16.12, because 6 *2.68 is 16.08, plus 0.02 *2.68 about 0.05, so 16.13.

So 16.13e(23-37) =16.13e-14 cm³ =1.613e-13 cm³.

So the volume is 1.613e-13 cm³.

Now, mass is 39 grams, which is 0.039 kg, or 39,000 mg, but in grams, 39 grams.

So density = mass / volume = 39 g / 1.613e-13 cm³ = 39 /1.613e-13 = approx 24.19e13 g/cm³.

Wait, 39 /1.613e-13 = 39 /1.613 *1e13 = (24.19) *1e13 = 2.419e14 grams/cm³.

Wait, 2.419e14 grams per cm³. Now, converting grams to tons. Since 1 ton is 1e6 grams (because 1000 kg, and 1 kg is 1e3 grams).

So 2.419e14 grams = 2.419e14 /1e6 = 2.419e8 tons/cm³.

Wait, 2.419e8 is 241.9 million tons per cm³. That's way larger than any of the options. So none of the options match this. Did I do a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the volume calculation? Let me check.

Wait, let's redo the volume calculation. (4/3)πr³.

r =4e-13 cm.

r³ = (4e-13)^3 =64e-39 cm³.

Multiply by (4/3)π: 64e-39 * 4.1888 =64 *4.1888 =268.05, so 268.05e-39 cm³, which is 2.6805e-37 cm³.

Wait, but wait, 268.05e-39 is 2.6805e-37 cm³. So that's correct.

Then, number of nuclei: 6.02e23. So the total volume is 6.02e23 * 2.6805e-37 = I think that's where I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 6.02e23 * 2.6805e-37 = (6.02 *2.6805) * 1e(23-37) = (16.12) * 1e-14 = 1.612e-13 cm³.

Ah, right, that's correct.

So density is 39 grams /1.612e-13 cm³ = 39 /1.612e-13 = 24.16e13 g/cm³ = 2.416e14 g/cm³.

Wait, that's 2.416e14 g/cm³.

Converting grams to metric tons: since 1 ton = 1e6 grams. So 2.416e14 g = 2.416e14 /1e6 = 2.416e8 tons per cm³.

But looking at the options, the closest is F:2.7e8, which is 2.7e8, so about 2.4e8. But I'm getting 2.4e8.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of significant figures.

Wait, the given data: the radius is 4e-13 cm (one significant figure?), 6.02e23 (three?), 39 grams (two?).

Wait, perhaps the radius is given as 4, and the mass as 39. So maybe the significant figures affect the answer's precision. But in this calculation, perhaps I should carry out more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact numbers to compute the density.

Let me try again.

Volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πr³.

r =4e-13 cm.

r³ =64e-39 cm³.

(4/3)π r³ = (4/3)*π*64e-39 = (256/3)*π *1e-39.

256/3 is approx 85.3333333.

85.3333333 * π ≈85.3333333 *3.1415926535 ≈267.905 cm³.

Wait, wait, 85.3333 *3.1416 is approx 267.905 cm³. So, 267.905e-39 cm³ = 2.67905e-37 cm³ per nucleus.

So total volume is 6.02e23 *2.67905e-37 cm³.

6.02e23 * 2.67905e-37 = (6.02 *2.67905) *1e(23-37) = let's compute 6.02 *2.67905.

6 *2.67905 is 16.0743, plus 0.02 *2.67905 is 0.05358, total 16.12788.

So 16.12788 *1e-14 = 1.612788e-13 cm³.

So the volume is approximately 1.6128e-13 cm³.

Mass is 39 grams. So density is 39 /1.6128e-13 grams per cm³.

39 /1.6128e-13 = (39 /1.6128) *1e13.

39 /1.6128 ≈24.19.

So 24.19 *1e13 g/cm³ = 2.419e14 g/cm³.

Wait, 2.419e14 grams per cm³, which is 2.419e14 g/cm³. To convert grams to metric tons, divide by 1e6.

So 2.419e14 g = 2.419e8 metric tons per cm³.

So the density is 2.419e8 metric tons per cm³.

Looking at the options again: option F is 2.7e8, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be F, 2.7e8 tons/cm³.

Wait, but let me think again. The options include F as 2.7e8. So that's the choice.

To calculate the density of a potassium nucleus, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of One Nucleus
The radius of the potassium nucleus is \( r = 4 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \). The volume of a sphere is given by:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Substituting \( r = 4 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \):

\[
r^3 = (4 \times 10^{-13})^3 = 64 \times 10^{-39} \, \text{cm}^3
\]

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (64 \times 10^{-39}) = \frac{256}{3} \pi \times 10^{-39}
\]

\[
\frac{256}{3} \approx 85.333 \quad \text{and} \quad 85.333 \times \pi \approx 267.91 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

\[
V = 267.91 \times 10^{-39} \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.6791 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Total Volume of All Nuclei
The number of potassium nuclei is \( N = 6.02 \times 10^{23} \). The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total Volume} = N \times V = (6.02 \times 10^{23}) \times (2.6791 \times 10^{-37})
\]

\[
\text{Total Volume} = (6.02 \times 2.6791) \times 10^{23-37} = 16.12 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{cm}^3 = 1.612 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Density
The mass of the nucleus is \( m = 39 \, \text{g} \). The density is:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{m}{\text{Total Volume}} = \frac{39}{1.612 \times 10^{-13}} \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

\[
\frac{39}{1.612} \approx 24.19 \quad \text{and} \quad 24.19 \times 10^{13} \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 2.419 \times 10^{14} \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

### Step 4: Convert Grams to Tons
Since \( 1 \, \text{ton} = 1000 \, \text{kg} = 10^6 \, \text{g} \), we convert grams to tons:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{2.419 \times 10^{14}}{10^6} \, \text{tons/cm}^3 = 2.419 \times 10^{8} \, \text{tons/cm}^3
\]

### Step 5: Match with the Options
The closest option to \( 2.419 \times 10^{8} \, \text{tons/cm}^3 \) is:

**F) \( 2.7 \times 10^{8} \, \text{tons/cm}^3 \)**

ANSWER: F
