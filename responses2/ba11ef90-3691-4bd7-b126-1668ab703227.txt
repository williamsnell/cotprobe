Okay, so I've got this graph theory problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm new to this. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the minimum vertex cover of a given undirected graph. The graph G has edges {<0,1>,<4,1>,<2,0>,<2,1>,<2,3>,<1,3>}. I need to find which node set is a minimum vertex cover, and represent it as a list in ascending order. The options are from A to J.

First, I should recall what a vertex cover is. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. So, for every edge, at least one of the two endpoints must be in the vertex cover.

The goal is to find the smallest such set. So, I need to find a set where every edge has at least one endpoint in the set, and the size of this set is as small as possible.

Let me try to list all the edges and see which vertices are connected. The edges are:

1. 0-1
2. 4-1
3. 2-0
4. 2-1
5. 2-3
6. 1-3

Now, I'm thinking of looking for vertices that cover as many edges as possible. Maybe I can start by selecting a node that covers the most edges, then see what's left.

Looking at node 0: It's connected to 1 and 2. So, if I include 0, it covers edges 1 and 3. That's two edges.

Node 1 is connected to 0, 2, and 3. So, if I include 1, it covers edges 1, 2, 4, and 6. That's four edges.

Node 2 is connected to 0, 1, 3. So, including 2 would cover edges 3,4,5. Three edges.

Node 3 is connected to 2 and 1. So, including 3 covers edges 5 and 6. Two edges.

Node 4 is connected only to 1. So, including 4 would cover edge 2.

So, looking at this, node 1 seems to cover the most edges (4 edges) compared to other nodes. So, maybe including 1 is part of the minimum vertex cover. Let's tentatively include 1.

Now, after including 1, which edges are still uncovered?

Edge 1: 0-1 → covered (since 1 is in the set)
Edge 2: 4-1 → covered
Edge 3: 2-0 → not covered yet
Edge 4: 2-1 → covered
Edge 5: 2-3 → not covered yet
Edge 6: 1-3 → covered (since 1 is in the set)

So, edges 3 and 5 are still uncovered. So, we need to cover those.

Now, the uncovered edges are 2 (0-1) is already covered, 3 (2-0), 5 (2-3). So, we need to cover 2-0 and 2-3.

Looking at these, node 2 is connected to both. So, if we include 2, it covers edges 3 and 5. But let's see if that's the minimal.

So, including 1 and 2 gives us a vertex cover of size 2: [1,2]. Are there any other edges that are uncovered after that?

Wait, let's check all edges again:

Edges covered by 1: edges 1 (0-1) and 2 (4-1) → covered.
Edges covered by 2: edges 3 (2-0), 4 (2-1), 5 (2-3) → so all edges are covered. So, [1,2] is a vertex cover. But wait, is that the smallest? Because sometimes a larger vertex cover can have a smaller size. Let me see if there's a way to cover all edges with a smaller set.

Wait, the options given don't have a set of size 2 except option F: [0,1,2]. Oh, but wait, I'm getting a vertex cover of size 2: [1, 2]. So why is that not the answer? Because maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, let me recheck. Maybe I missed some edges.

Wait, the options are A to J, and option F is [0,1,2]. So, if [1,2] is a vertex cover, it's of size 2, which is smaller than [0,2,3] (option I), which is size 3. So, [1,2] is better.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have [1,2] yet. Looking back: the options are A: [0,1], B: [1,3,4], C: [1,2,3], D: [2,3,4], E: [0,2,4], F: [0,1,2], G: [0,4], H: [1,2], I: [2,3], J: [0,2,3].

So, option H is [1,2], which is what I thought. So does that mean the answer is H? But wait, why isn't that the case? Because let's think about whether [1,2] actually covers all edges.

Looking at the edges:

Edge 0-1: 1 is in the set → covered.
Edge 4-1: 1 is in the set → covered.
Edge 2-0: 2 is in the set → covered.
Edge 2-1: 1 is in the set → covered.
Edge 2-3: 2 is in the set → covered.
Edge 1-3: 1 is in the set → covered.

Wait, all edges are covered. So [1,2] is a vertex cover. So why is option H [1,2] present as an option, so why isn't it the correct answer? Or perhaps I made a mistake because maybe [1,2] isn't a valid vertex cover? No, it is. Because all edges are incident to at least one vertex in the set.

Wait, but then why isn't [1,2] the correct answer? Because the options include [1,2], which is option H. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

But wait, no, the problem is that I might have made a mistake in my initial analysis. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: maybe the minimal vertex cover isn't [1,2], but something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that [1,2] covers all edges, which it does.

Wait, but another way to approach this is to look for the maximum matching and use Konig's theorem, which states that in bipartite graphs, the size of the minimum vertex cover equals the size of the maximum matching. But I'm not sure if this graph is bipartite. Let me check if it is.

Looking at the edges, I can see that it's undirected and there are no negative weights or any issues. Let's try to see if it's bipartite. A graph is bipartite if it doesn't contain any odd-length cycles.

Let's try to see if there are any cycles. Let's see:

Looking at node 0: connected to 1 and 2.

From 0 ->1, then 1 connected to 3 and 2. From 1 to 3, which is connected to 2.

Wait, perhaps a cycle exists. For example, 0-1-3-2-0: that's a cycle of length 4 (even), so it's not an odd cycle. Another possible cycle: 0-2-3-1-0: that's also length 4.

So, no odd cycles, meaning the graph is bipartite. So, Konig's theorem applies. But I'm not sure yet how that would help me find the minimum vertex cover.

But perhaps knowing that the graph is bipartite can help me find the minimum vertex cover.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, the edges are:

0-1,

4-1,

2-0,

2-1,

2-3,

1-3.

So the nodes are 0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the graph.

It's an undirected graph with edges as follows:

- Node 0 connected to 1 and 2.

- Node 1 connected to 0, 2, and 3.

- Node 2 connected to 0,1, and 3.

- Node 3 connected to 1 and 2.

- Node 4 connected to 1.

So, the graph structure looks like:

1 is connected to 0, 2, 3, and 4.

2 is connected to 0, 1, 3.

So, let's see if [1,2] covers all edges.

Edges:

0-1: yes.

4-1: yes.

2-0: yes.

2-1: yes.

2-3: yes.

1-3: yes.

So, all edges are covered. So [1,2] is a valid vertex cover.

Now, why isn't that the correct answer? Because the options include [1,2] as option H.

Wait, but the problem is that perhaps I made a mistake in the selection. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some edges. Let me list all edges and see:

Edges are:

0-1: yes.

4-1: yes.

2-0: yes.

2-1: yes.

2-3: yes.

1-3: yes.

So, all edges are covered. So [1,2] is a valid vertex cover.

But wait, the options include [1,2] as H. So why isn't that the minimal? Because maybe it's not possible to have a smaller vertex cover.

Wait, what's the size of [1,2]? It's 2. Are there any ways to have a vertex cover of size 2? Because if [1,2] is a valid vertex cover, that's the minimal possible.

But wait, let's re-examine the problem. The question asks for the minimum vertex cover. So, perhaps I'm correct—[1,2] is the minimal, which is option H.

But wait, in the options, option H is [1,2], which is correct, but I thought the correct answer might be H. However, I also need to check whether any of the other options are possible.

Wait, another approach is to see if [1,2] is indeed a minimal vertex cover.

Is there a smaller possible vertex cover? Let's try.

Suppose I try to include only 1. Then, which edges are left?

Edges not covered by 1 are 2-0, 2-3 → because 1 is connected to 0,2,3. So, edges 2-0 and 2-3 are not covered by 1 alone.

So, to cover 2-0 and 2-3, I need to include either node 2 or node 0. So, if I include 2, then all edges are covered. So, with 1 and 2, we have a vertex cover. So, the minimal vertex cover can't be smaller than 2.

Thus, [1,2] is indeed a minimal vertex cover.

So, the answer should be option H: [1,2].

Wait, but looking at the options given, option H is [1,2]. So that must be the correct answer.

The problem requires finding the minimum vertex cover of the given undirected graph G. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest such set.

### Analysis of the Graph
The graph G has edges:
- {0,1}, {4,1}, {2,0}, {2,1}, {2,3}, {1,3}.

### Identifying the Minimum Vertex Cover
1. **Node 1** is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4. Including node 1 covers four edges.
2. After including node 1, the remaining edges to cover are 2-0 and 2-3.
3. Including node 2 covers both remaining edges (2-0 and 2-3), as node 2 is connected to 0, 1, and 3.

Thus, the set {1, 2} covers all edges. This is a vertex cover of size 2, which is the smallest possible.

### Conclusion
The minimum vertex cover is represented by the set [1, 2], which corresponds to option H.
