The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The question, therefore, should be quickly settled, whether free colored persons, born and naturalized in this country, are not American citizens, and justly entitled to all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states; and whether the Constitution of the United States makes or authorizes any invidious distinction with regard to the color or condition of free inhabitants.
"For myself, I have not the shadow of doubt on the subject. I believe that the rights of the free colored persons need only to be vindicated before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be obtained; that no prejudice or sophistry . . . can prevent their acknowledgement . . . and that the present laws, affecting your condition, are clearly unconstitutional. The fact that you have been treated, by common consent and common usage, as aliens and brutes, is not proof that such treatment is legal, but only shows the strength, the bitterness, and the blindness of prejudice."

Okay, so I have this question about William Lloyd Garrison's argument and its contradiction in a Supreme Court decision. Let me try to break this down.

From the passage, Garrison is arguing that free people of color, born and naturalized in the U.S., aren't truly American citizens. He's saying their rights aren't protected because the country treats them like free individuals. He mentions that the laws affecting their condition are unconstitutional because of prejudice. 

Wait, but I remember something about the Supreme Court decisions related to this. Garrison's argument is about the "free state" idea, where free people of color were considered to have no rights, so their rights were only about their own color or condition. But that's a long time ago, in the mid-19th century. 

I think the next point is that the Supreme Court later invalidated this argument. One of the Court's cases about this was in 1857, which was Dred Scott vs. South Carolina. The Supreme Court ruled that the "free state" idea was incorrect because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They held that the rights of free people of color were protected, and that the laws are constitutional because they don't discriminate against them.

So looking back at the options, the correct answer should be J: Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857). That's the decision that contradicted Garrison's argument.

The correct answer is J: Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857). 

**Explanation:**
William Lloyd Garrison's argument was based on the "free state" idea, which argued that free people of color were not entitled to the rights of citizens. However, the Supreme Court later invalidated this argument in Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857), ruling that their rights were protected under the Fourteenth Amendment due to the Equal Protection Clause. This decision directly contradicted Garrison's claim.
