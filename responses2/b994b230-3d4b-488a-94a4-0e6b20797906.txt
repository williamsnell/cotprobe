Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A manager's competitor sent a defamatory letter to the manager accusing him of professional incompetence and calling him one of the worst businessmen in town. It was addressed to the manager. He read it, put it in a private drawer, and did not read it again. Later, he tried to sue the competitor for defamation as a result of the letter. Will the court likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and on what grounds? Base your answer on the common law definition of defamation.

Options:

A: No, it will not dismiss because a plaintiff in a defamatory action has an absolute right to a jury trial to prove defamation.
B: Yes, it will dismiss on the grounds that the manager did not suffer any actual harm or damage as a result of the letter.
C: No, it will not dismiss because the manager has the right to sue for emotional damages.
D: No, it will not dismiss because the letter constitutes malicious intent.
E: Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the language is not damaging to the manager's reputation.
F: Yes, it will dismiss because the competitor has freedom of speech.
G: No, it will not dismiss because the competitor intentionally sent the letter to harm the manager's reputation.
H: Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.
I: No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are all present.
J: Yes, it will dismiss on the grounds that the letter does not specifically mention the manager's profession.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the court will dismiss this defamation case. Let's break down the situation.

The manager sent a defamatory letter to his competitor. The letter accuses him of professional incompetence and identifies him as a worst businessman in town. The letter was addressed to the manager, but he read it, put it in a private drawer, and didn't read it again. Later, he sued the competitor for defamation. The question is whether the defendant's motion to dismiss will be granted.

I remember that defamation involves statements that are false and have a negative impact on someone's reputation. The key elements are factuality, harm to reputation, and causation.

The main points to consider are:
1. Did the defendant (competitor) commit defamation?
2. Was there harm to the plaintiff (manager's reputation)?
3. Was there causation between the defendant's actions and the harm?

The defendant's letter was sent to the manager, but he didn't read it. This might be a red herring because sometimes the defendant doesn't read it, especially if they feel it's too personal or if they don't know the recipient.

The letter was addressed to the manager, so it's likely the plaintiff's letter. The plaintiff has the right to a jury trial, which is a fundamental right in common law. So option A's reasoning doesn't apply here. Also, the plaintiff has the right to an absolute right to compensation if they don't suffer actual harm. But the defendant didn't read the letter, so maybe there's no harm yet.

The letter was directed at the plaintiff, so it's a personal attack. It's a defamatory statement. The defendant's action didn't include anything that would make the statement true or false. The plaintiff didn't receive any actual harm because the letter didn't do anything to the plaintiff's reputation. So the harm isn't present.

So, the defendant's lack of reading and lack of harm mean that the statement is not an actual defamatory act. The defendant's motion to dismiss is likely based on the lack of harm to the plaintiff's reputation. That would support option E's reasoning.

Wait, let me think again. The defendant's motion would be dismissed if there's no harm. Since the letter was intended to hurt the manager's reputation, but the defendant didn't read it, maybe they didn't actually harm the reputation. So yes, the defendant can dismiss on that basis.

Other options: Option G says the letter was malicious intent, but the defendant didn't read it, so no intent is implied by the content alone. Option D says it's malicious intent, but the defendant didn't read it. Option F says competitor has freedom of speech, which isn't relevant. Option I says circumstances show all elements are present. But the defendant didn't read it, so the letter wasn't published in a way to harm the plaintiff's reputation. So option E is correct.

The defendant's motion to dismiss will likely be granted on the basis that the letter constitutes a lack of actual harm or damage to the plaintiff's reputation. This is because the defendant did not read the letter, which was intended to harm the plaintiff's reputation, but the lack of reading implies no harm was actually inflicted. Additionally, the defendant's lack of knowledge about the recipient (the manager) is irrelevant to the lack of harm.

Answer: E
