Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the net profit for the Flamingo Restaurant for October. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my financial calculations, but I'll take it slow.

First, I'll list out all the information given. The food on hand at the start of October was $609.31. Then, during the month, they spent $1,827.63 on purchases. Sales were $4,501.16. They also have various expenses: rent, salaries, supplies, and miscellaneous expenses. And the food on hand at the end of the month is $215.76.

Wait, I remember that to calculate net profit, you need to subtract total expenses from total revenue. So, let's break this down.

Revenue would be the sales, which is $4,501.16. Now, for expenses, I need to consider all the costs they incurred during the month. The expenses listed are rent ($175), salaries ($580.15), supplies ($89.47), and miscellaneous ($50.83). So I should sum all these up.

Let me add them up: 175 + 580.15 = 755.15; 755.15 + 89.47 = 844.62; then 844.62 + 50.83 = 895.45. So total expenses from these are $895.45.

Wait, but wait. What about the food on hand? Oh, right! The food on hand affects the calculation. Because the restaurant starts with $609.31, buys more during the month, and ends with $215.76. 

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) first. COGS is equal to the beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory. Because the food on hand is the ending inventory. So, COGS = 609.31 + 1827.63 - 215.76.

Let me compute that: 609.31 + 1827.63 = 2436.94. Then subtract 215.76: 2436.94 - 215.76 = 2221.18. So COGS is $2221.18.

Hmm. Then, the total expenses are the COGS plus all other expenses. Because COGS is part of the cost of goods sold, and the other expenses are operating expenses. So, the total expenses would be COGS plus rent, salaries, supplies, and miscellaneous. Wait, but wait, are the rent, salaries, etc., considered as operating expenses, or are they part of the COGS? I think they are all operating expenses. So, adding up all the operating expenses.

So, total operating expenses are rent, salaries, supplies, and misc. Let me add them: 175 + 580.15 = 755.15; 755.15 + 89.47 = 844.62; 844.62 + 50.83 = 895.45. So that's $895.45.

So, total expenses are COGS (2221.18) plus these 895.45. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The COGS is the cost of the food sold. So, the COGS is $2221.18. Then, the other expenses are all the other costs the restaurant incurred during the month, which are rent, salaries, supplies, and other. So, the total operating expenses are 175+580.15+89.47+50.83 = 895.45.

So, the total expenses for the restaurant would be the cost of goods sold plus the operating expenses. So 2221.18 + 895.45 = 3116.63.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Because the COGS is part of the income statement as the cost of goods sold. The other expenses are operating expenses. So, the total expenses would be COGS plus all other expenses. Then, the net profit is total revenue minus (COGS + other expenses).

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the total expenses as the sum of all costs, which includes COGS plus all other operating expenses. But that's the same as COGS plus operating expenses.

So, total expenses = COGS + other expenses. COGS is 2221.18, and other expenses are 895.45. So total expenses = 2221.18 + 895.45 = 3116.63.

But wait, wait a second. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the net profit is calculated as follows: 

Total Sales = 4501.16

Minus (Opening Inventory + Purchases - Closing Inventory) = 2221.18

So, 4501.16 - 2221.18 = 2279.98

Then, subtract the other expenses: 2279.98 - (175 + 580.15 + 89.47 +50.83) = 2279.98 - 895.45 = 1384.53. Wait, but that can't be right, because that would imply a lower net profit.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong. Maybe the operating expenses are separate from the COGS.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute gross profit first, which is sales minus COGS.

Gross profit = 4501.16 - 2221.18 = 2279.98.

Then, subtract the operating expenses: 2279.98 - (175 + 580.15 +89.47 +50.83) = 2279.98 - 895.45 = 1384.53.

But that would give a net profit of $1,384.53. Looking at the options, option I is that. But I'm not sure. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options for the net profit are:

A: 2768.49

B: 2221.18

C: 1750

D: 2995.67

E: 3116.63

F: 4501.16

G: 3000.42

H: 1982.34

I: 1384.53

J: 2500

So, option I is 1384.53. That's what I would get if I subtracted COGS and then subtracted all the operating expenses. So that would be net profit.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to calculate net profit by adding all the operating expenses and then subtracting from sales.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate.

Wait, another approach: the net profit is calculated as:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - (Opening Inventory + Purchases - Closing Inventory) - (All other expenses).

So, that would be:

4501.16 - (609.31 + 1827.63 - 215.76) - (175 + 580.15 + 89.47 + 50.83).

So, let's compute each part:

First part: 609.31 + 1827.63 = 2436.94

Subtracting closing inventory 215.76: 2436.94 - 215.76 = 2221.18. So that's COGS.

Second part: 175 + 580.15 = 755.15. 755.15 +89.47 = 844.62. 844.62 +50.83= 895.45.

So, total expenses are 2221.18 + 895.45 = 3116.63.

Net profit is 4501.16 - 3116.63 = 1384.53.

So that's option I: 1384.53.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think: perhaps the rent, salaries, supplies, and other are all operating expenses, so the total operating expenses are 895.45. Then, the COGS is 2221.18. So, the net profit would be (4501.16 - 2221.18) - 895.45.

Which is (2279.98) - 895.45 = 1384.53.

So, that gives the same result. So the net profit is 1384.53, which is option I.

Wait, but another way: perhaps the net profit is calculated as:

Opening inventory + purchases - closing inventory = COGS.

Then, subtract COGS from sales to get gross profit.

Then, subtract all the other expenses (the ones not part of COGS).

So, gross profit is 4501.16 - 2221.18 = 2279.98.

Other expenses are 175 +580.15 +89.47 +50.83 = 895.45.

So, 2279.98 - 895.45 = 1384.53.

So, the same result. So the net profit is 1384.53, which is option I.

Looking at the options, option I is 1384.53, so the correct answer is I.

To calculate the net profit for the Flamingo Restaurant for October:

1. **Calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS):**
   - COGS = (Opening Inventory + Purchases) - Closing Inventory
   - COGS = ($609.31 + $1,827.63) - $215.76 = $2,221.18

2. **Determine the total operating expenses:**
   - Rent: $175.00
   - Salaries: $580.15
   - Supplies: $89.47
   - Miscellaneous: $50.83
   - Total Operating Expenses = $175.00 + $580.15 + $89.47 + $50.83 = $895.45

3. **Calculate the gross profit:**
   - Gross Profit = Total Sales - COGS
   - Gross Profit = $4,501.16 - $2,221.18 = $2,279.98

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net Profit = Gross Profit - Total Operating Expenses
   - Net Profit = $2,279.98 - $895.45 = $1,384.53

The net profit for the Flamingo Restaurant for October is **$1,384.53**, which corresponds to option **I**.
