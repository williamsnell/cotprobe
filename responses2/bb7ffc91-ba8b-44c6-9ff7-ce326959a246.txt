Question:

The residual from a standard regression model is defined as

Options:

A: The difference between the actual value, y, and the fitted value, y-hat
B: The square of the difference between the actual value, y, and the fitted value, y-hat
C: The square of the difference between the fitted value, y-hat, and the mean, y-bar
D: The difference between the fitted value, y-hat, and the mean, y-bar
E: The sum of the actual value, y, and the fitted value, y-hat
F: The difference between the standard deviation, s, and the fitted value, y-hat
G: The difference between the actual value, y, and the mean, y-bar
H: The difference between the actual value, y, and the median, m
I: The square root of the difference between the actual value, y, and the fitted value, y-hat

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about residuals in a regression model. Let me think this through. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Residuals are a key concept in regression analysis. From what I remember, a residual is the difference between the observed (actual) data value and the predicted (fitted) value from the regression model. So, it's a measure of how far off the model's prediction is for a particular data point.

The question asks which option correctly defines the residual. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says: The difference between the actual value y and the fitted value y-hat. That sounds right. Because residuals are y minus y-hat.

Option B is the square of that difference. Oh wait, that's the square of the residual, which is the squared term used in calculating the sum of squared errors, but the definition itself is a difference, not squared.

Option C: Square of the difference between fitted and mean y-bar. That's like the residual for the mean, maybe in some contexts, but not the standard residual as I understand it. Probably not the right answer here.

Option D: Difference between y-hat and y-bar. Hmm, what's y-bar? Oh, it's the mean of the dependent variable. So that's the difference between the fitted value and the mean. I think this is a type of residual, like in residual plots where you look at the difference from the mean. But is this the standard residual?

Option E: Sum of actual y and fitted y-hat. No, that doesn't make sense. Residuals are differences, not sums. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Difference between y and median m. Median is a different thing. Residuals are about the mean or the actual value.

Option G: Actual y minus mean y-bar. That's similar to option D, but it's the difference between the actual and the mean, not the fitted value. So D is the difference between fitted and y-bar, while G is between actual and y-bar. So which is the residual?

Wait, another thought: I think the standard residual is y minus y-hat. So option A is correct.

Let me double-check. So the standard residual is the actual y minus the predicted y-hat. So option A is correct. The others are incorrect because they either square it, are about mean differences instead of actual, or sum them up.

So the answer should be option A.

The correct answer is **A: The difference between the actual value, y, and the fitted value, y-hat**. 

Option A correctly defines the residual as the difference between the observed value and the predicted value, which is the standard definition in regression analysis. Other options either square the difference (B), involve the mean (C and D), are sums (E), or refer to different statistical measures (F, G, H, I). 

Answer: A
