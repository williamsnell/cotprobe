Okay, so I've got this gas problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the volume of dry nitrogen at STP given some initial conditions. 

So, the data given is: 40 liters of N₂ gas collected at 22°C over water, with a pressure of 0.957 atm. And I need to find the volume at STP. Wait, STP is standard temperature and pressure, which is 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm. Oh right, and the gas laws apply here.

Wait, but wait. When a gas is collected over water, it includes water vapor, right? Because the water is in the gas and affects the total pressure. Oh right, so the initial pressure (0.957 atm) is the total pressure, which includes the N₂ and the water vapor.

So, I should probably calculate the partial pressure of N₂. The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases. So P_total = P_N2 + P_water_vapor. But wait, I should remember that the vapor pressure of water at 22°C is known. I think at 22°C, the vapor pressure is about 19.86 mmHg. Oh wait, but wait, the pressure given is in atmospheres, so I need to convert that.

Wait, 1 atm is 760 mmHg, so 19.86 mmHg is (19.86/760) atm. Let's compute that. 19.86 divided by 760. Hmm, 19.86 ÷ 760 is approximately 0.0260 atm. So the partial pressure of nitrogen is the total pressure minus this. So P_N2 = 0.957 atm - 0.0260 atm = approximately 0.931 atm.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, no. Because when you collect a gas over water, the pressure is the total pressure, which includes the gas and the water vapor. So yes, P_total = P_N2 + P_water. So P_N2 = P_total - P_water.

So, P_water is 19.86 mmHg. So I need to convert that to atm. 19.86 / 760 = let's calculate that. 760 ÷ 100 is 7.6 per 10. So 19.86 ÷ 760.

Wait, 760 goes into 19.86 how many times? Let me compute it. 760 * 0.026 = 19.76, which is close to 19.86. So approximately 0.0260 atm.

So P_N2 is 0.957 - 0.026 = 0.931 atm.

Now, I have the partial pressure of N₂ at 22°C. I need to find the volume of this gas at STP. Wait, STP is 0°C and 1 atm. So I can use the combined gas law here.

Wait, the combined gas law is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. But wait, I'm not sure if I should apply it directly here because the temperature is changing, but the pressure is changing as well. Alternatively, I can find the number of moles first and then use the ideal gas law to find the volume at STP.

Wait, perhaps using the combined gas law is the way to go, but I need to make sure that the units are correct.

So, for the initial state, P1 is 0.931 atm (since I had to subtract the water vapor), V1 is 40 L, T1 is 22°C, which is 22 +273.15 = 295.15 K.

The final state is P2 = 1 atm (STP), V2 is the volume we're trying to find, T2 = 0°C = 273.15 K.

So applying the combined gas law: (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2.

Rearranging for V2: V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1)

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

P1 = 0.931 atm

V1 =40 L

T1 = 295.15 K

P2=1 atm

T2=273.15 K

So V2 = (0.931 atm * 40 L * 273.15 K ) / (1 atm * 295.15 K )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.931 *40 *273.15

First, 0.931 *40 = 37.24.

37.24 *273.15= let's compute that.

37 * 273 is about 10,071. But more accurately:

37.24 *273.15 = let's compute 37 *273.15 = (30*273.15) + (7*273.15) = 8194.5 + 1912.05 = 10,106.55. Then 0.24 *273.15 = 65.556. So total ≈ 10,106.55 +65.556 = 10,172.106.

Denominator: 1 *295.15 = 295.15.

So V2 = 10,172.106 / 295.15 ≈ let's compute that.

10,172 ÷ 295 = let me see. 295 *34 = 10,030 (since 300 *30=9000, 300*34=10200, but wait, 34*300 is 10200, but 295 is 5 less than 300. So 295 *34 = 295*(30+4) = 8850 + 1180 = 10,030. So 10,172 is about 142 more. So 142/295 ≈ 0.481. So total is about 34.481 liters.

Wait, my calculation: 10,172.106 /295.15 ≈ 34.48 liters. So approximately 34.5 liters.

Looking at the options, option B is 34.4 liters, and option E is 35.7. Hmm, so 34.5 is closer to B (34.4) than E (35.7). So the answer is B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to be safe.

Wait, let me recalculate the numerator:

P1 * V1 = 0.931 atm *40 L = 37.24 atm·L.

T2 is 273.15 K, T1 is 295.15 K.

So the ratio (T2/T1) is 273.15 /295.15 ≈ 0.922.

So V2 = (37.24 * 0.922) = ?

37.24 *0.9 = 33.516, 37.24 *0.022 = 0.820. So total is 33.516 +0.820 =34.336. Which is approximately 34.34 liters.

So the options give option B as 34.4 liters, which is very close. So the correct answer is B.

To determine the volume of dry nitrogen at STP, we start by calculating the partial pressure of nitrogen in the collected gas mixture. The total pressure is given as 0.957 atm, and the vapor pressure of water at 22°C is approximately 19.86 mmHg. Converting this to atm: 

\[
\text{Partial pressure of water vapor} = \frac{19.86}{760} \approx 0.0260 \, \text{atm}.
\]

The partial pressure of nitrogen is then:

\[
P_{\text{N}_2} = P_{\text{total}} - P_{\text{water vapor}} = 0.957 - 0.0260 = 0.931 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Next, we use the combined gas law to relate the initial conditions (22°C over water, 40 L) to the conditions at STP (0°C, 1 atm). The combined gas law is:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}.
\]

Here:
- \( P_1 = 0.931 \, \text{atm} \),
- \( V_1 = 40 \, \text{L} \),
- \( T_1 = 22^\circ \text{C} = 295.15 \, \text{K} \),
- \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \),
- \( T_2 = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \).

Rearranging for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{P_2 T_1}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_2 = \frac{0.931 \cdot 40 \cdot 273.15}{1 \cdot 295.15}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.931 \cdot 40 = 37.24, \quad 37.24 \cdot 273.15 \approx 10,172.11.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
1 \cdot 295.15 = 295.15.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
V_2 = \frac{10,172.11}{295.15} \approx 34.48 \, \text{L}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest value is **34.4 liters (option B)**.
