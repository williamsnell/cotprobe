Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this history question about westward migration. The question provides a passage about the 1840s and asks which of the options correctly describes a change in migration that happened then. 

The passage mentions that in the 1840s, the future of America is described as a time of great success and divine principles. It also talks about migration into territories like Oregon and California, and mentions a "Union of many Republics," which I think refers to the original thirteen colonies merging into the United States. The migration is referred to as a "holy war," a term I've heard before in context of the Revolution. 

The options are A to J, each describing a change in migration trends. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The number of pioneers heading to Oregon increased, while those heading to California decreased. That sounds plausible because the passage mentions that migration was increasing, maybe favoring certain areas. 

Option B: The first great wave of migration ended, and migration remained low until after the Civil War. The passage says the first great wave ended with the Civil War, and migration continued post-Civil War. So B seems incorrect because the passage states the migration continued after the Civil War.

Option C: The number heading to Oregon decreased, and California greatly increased. That's the opposite of A. If the passage says migration was increasing, perhaps favoring California, then C would be the opposite change. But I need to think, in the passage, it's about the future, but the passage doesn't explicitly state whether migration was increasing in both areas. Alternatively, maybe it was increasing in some areas and decreasing in others. So A says Oregon up, California down; C is the opposite. So if the passage didn't state that, then C might not be correct.

Option D: Native Americans migrating east in response to westward migration. The passage mentions the "Union of many Republics" and migration into specific areas, but it doesn't specify the direction of the migration. However, the passage doesn't suggest that Native Americans were moving east; it's more about migration between regions. So I'm not sure if D is correct.

Option E: Number of migrants remained the same. The passage says it's a holy war, so migration was occurring, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Migration remained steady. The passage says migration was increasing, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Pioneers started settling west of the Mississippi. The passage doesn't mention this. It talks about Oregon and California, so G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Californian Gold Rush caused migration to decrease. The passage says the Gold Rush happened, but it's the first time that migration from the West to California decreased. So H is incorrect because the Gold Rush was a factor in migration, but it's not a cause for migration decreases. The passage says migration continued because of the Gold Rush, so H is not correct.

Option I: Most chose the East due to the West's hardships. The passage states that the East was chosen, so I is correct.

Option J: Blacks resettle in the West because the East is unwelcome. The passage doesn't mention any such issue, so J is incorrect.

So looking back, the correct answer seems to be I, which states that most chose the East because of the West's hardships.

The correct answer is I: Most of the pioneers chose to settle in the East due to the hardships of the West.

**Answer: I**
