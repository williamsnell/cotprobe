Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to find the change in enthalpy, ΔH, for the reaction CO(g) + (1/2)O₂(g) → CO₂(g). The given data is the standard enthalpy change, ΔE, which is -67.4 kcal. Hmm, wait a second. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, no, wait. Because I remember that ΔH is the change in enthalpy, while ΔE is the change in internal energy. Oh right, so ΔH is at constant pressure, and ΔE is at constant volume. So in this problem, since they gave me ΔE, I need to relate that to ΔH.

Wait, the problem gives me ΔE for the reaction. So the reaction is exothermic because ΔE is negative. But wait, the question is about ΔH, not ΔE. So I need to find the relationship between ΔH and ΔE. Oh, right! The relationship is ΔH = ΔE + Δ(n)RT. Because at constant pressure, enthalpy change is equal to internal energy change plus the product of the gas constant, R, the temperature change, and the change in moles of gas.

So in this reaction, I need to compute Δn. Δn is the moles of gas in products minus moles of gas in reactants. Let's see, the reactants are CO(g) and (1/2)O₂(g). So CO is 1 mole, O₂ is 0.5 moles, so total reactant moles is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 moles.

The products are CO₂(g), which is 1 mole. So Δn = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 moles.

The temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K. R is the gas constant. Wait, but what units? Since ΔE is given in kcal, I should make sure about the units. R is 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K) when using units of kcal. Alternatively, sometimes R is given as 8.314 J/(mol·K), but since the question is in kcal, using the appropriate R value is important.

Wait, the formula is ΔH = ΔE + Δn R T. So let's plug in the values.

ΔE is -67.4 kcal. Δn is -0.5 moles. R is 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K). Temperature T is 298 K.

So ΔH = (-67.4) + (-0.5) * 0.001987 * 298.

Let me compute that. First, calculate the second term: (-0.5) * 0.001987 * 298.

Hmm, 0.5 * 298 = 149. So 0.001987 * 149 is about 0.001987 * 150 is about 0.29805, but subtract 0.001987 to get 149: 0.29805 - 0.001987 ≈ 0.29606. So the term is -0.29606 kcal.

So ΔH = (-67.4) + (-0.29606) = -67.696 kcal approximately. So rounding it to three decimal places, it's about -67.7 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is -67.7 Kcal, and option H is -67.4 Kcal. So which one is correct?

Wait, wait! I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, another approach: ΔH = ΔE + Δn R T. So, Δn is -0.5. So, ΔH = (-67.4) + (-0.5) * R * T.

But R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but wait the ΔE is in kcal. So perhaps I should convert R into the appropriate units for kcal. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct value for R in terms of kcal. Let's think: R is 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K), so I can proceed.

So, R*T is 0.001987 * 298 ≈ 0.5935866. So 0.5 * 0.5935866 = 0.2967933. So the second term is -0.2967933 kcal.

So total ΔH is -67.4 - 0.2967933 → which is approximately -67.696793 kcal. So approximately -67.7 kcal.

Looking at the options, option C is -67.7 Kcal, and option H is -67.4 Kcal. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait the options. Let me look again. The options are A to J.

Options:

A: -0.3 Kcal

B: 0 Kcal

C: -67.7 Kcal

D: 67.7 Kcal

E: -33.7 Kcal

F: 67.4 Kcal

G: 298 Kcal

H: -67.4 Kcal

I: -298 Kcal

J: -94.2 Kcal

So option C is -67.7, which is what I got. But wait, I have to be careful. Let me re-express the equation again.

Wait, wait a second. I think I made an error in the calculation of Δn. Let me recount:

Reactants: CO (1 mole) + (1/2) O2 (0.5 mole) → total 1.5 moles.

Products: CO2 (1 mole) → Δn = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 moles. So that part is correct.

So, R is 0.001987 kcal/mol·K.

So R*T = 0.001987 * 298 → Let's compute that.

0.001987 * 298: 0.001987 * 300 is 0.5961, but 298 is 2 less, so 0.001987 * (-2) is -0.003974. So 0.5961 - 0.003974 = 0.592126.

So R*T is approximately 0.592126.

Then, Δn * R*T is (-0.5) * 0.592126 = -0.296063 kcal.

So ΔH = ΔE + Δn R T → -67.4 + (-0.296063) → -67.696 kcal.

Which rounds to -67.7 kcal.

Looking at the options, option C is -67.7 kcal. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the question is about the reaction as written, and the given ΔE is for the reaction. So I think my approach is correct.

But wait, why is option H -67.4 Kcal? Because that's the ΔE value given in the problem. So the options have ΔE as one of them, but the question is about ΔH. So the correct answer is either C or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, I think I'm correct. So the answer should be C, -67.7 Kcal, which is option C.

To calculate the enthalpy change, ΔH, for the reaction CO(g) + (1/2)O₂(g) → CO₂(g), we use the relationship:

\[
\Delta H = \Delta E + \Delta n R T
\]

where:
- ΔE is the change in internal energy (ΔE = -67.4 kcal),
- Δn is the change in moles of gas,
- \( R = 0.001987 \, \text{kcal/(mol·K)} \),
- \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \).

### Step 1: Calculate Δn
The reaction involves:
- Reactants: 1 mole of CO and 0.5 moles of O₂, for a total of 1.5 moles of gas.
- Products: 1 mole of CO₂.

Thus, the change in moles of gas is:

\[
\Delta n = \text{moles of gas in products} - \text{moles of gas in reactants} = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( R T \)
Using \( R = 0.001987 \, \text{kcal/(mol·K)} \) and \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \):

\[
R T = 0.001987 \times 298 = 0.592126 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \Delta n R T \)
Substitute Δn and \( R T \):

\[
\Delta n R T = (-0.5) \times 0.592126 = -0.296063 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate ΔH
Substitute ΔE and \( \Delta n R T \):

\[
\Delta H = \Delta E + \Delta n R T = -67.4 + (-0.296063) = -67.696063 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

Rounding to three decimal places:

\[
\Delta H \approx -67.7 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated enthalpy change is approximately -67.7 kcal/mol, which corresponds to option C.
