Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this pay question. Let me read it again. The plumber is paid $4.50 per hour for the first 40 hours, and then 1.75 times that rate for any hours worked beyond 40. The work week is 50 hours. I need to calculate his total pay.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, the regular hours are 40. So the pay for those is 40 hours multiplied by $4.50 per hour. Let me compute that: 40 * 4.50. Well, 40 times 4 is 160, and 40 times 0.5 is 20, so together that's 180. So regular pay is $180.

Now, the hours over 40 are 50 - 40 = 10 hours. He gets 1.75 times the regular rate for each of these. The regular rate is $4.50, so 1.75 times that is 4.50 * 1.75. Let me calculate that. 4 * 1.75 is 7, and 0.5 * 1.75 is 0.875, so adding them gives 7.875. So each overtime hour is $7.875.

Wait, but maybe I should compute 1.75 * 4.50 directly. Let me see: 4.50 * 1.75. 4.50 * 1 is 4.50, 4.50 * 0.75 is 3.375. So adding 4.50 and 3.375 gives 7.875. So yes, that's correct.

So for 10 hours at $7.875 per hour, the pay is 10 * 7.875. Let's calculate that: 10 times 7 is 70, 10 times 0.875 is 8.75. So total is 78.75.

So the overtime pay is $78.75.

Therefore, the total pay is regular pay + overtime pay. That's $180 + $78.75. Let me add those: 180 + 78 is 258, plus 0.75 is 258.75. So $258.75 in total.

Looking at the options, I'm looking for $258.80, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations in case I messed up somewhere. So 40 hours at 4.50 is definitely 180. 10 hours at 7.875 is 78.75. Adding gives 258.75, which is $258.75. But the options don't have 258.75, they have 258.80, so option D is correct.

The plumber is paid $4.50 per hour for the first 40 hours and 1.75 times that rate for additional hours. For a 50-hour work week:

1. Regular pay: 40 hours * $4.50 = $180.
2. Overtime pay: 10 hours * ($4.50 * 1.75) = 10 * $7.875 = $78.75.
3. Total pay: $180 + $78.75 = $258.75, which rounds to $258.80.

Answer: D
