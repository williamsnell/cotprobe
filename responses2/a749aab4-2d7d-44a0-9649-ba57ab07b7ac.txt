Question:

If there were a leverage effect in practice, what would be the shape of the news impact curve for as model that accounted for that leverage?

Options:

A: It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude
B: It would be symmetrical about zero
C: It would rise less quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude
D: It would be zero for all positive disturbances

Okay, so I've got this question about the news impact curve and a leverage effect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the news impact curve shows how shocks in events (like elections, recessions) affect stock market returns over time. The shape depends on factors like how the market reacts to negative versus positive events. 

Now the question is about a leverage effect. Leverage refers to using debt to amplify returns, right? So if a company has debt, a negative shock (like a recession) might lead to a larger positive return because the debt can finance the losses. That's leverage in action.

Wait, the news impact curve is a graph where x-axis is time and y-axis is the market's response. So, when there's a negative shock, the market might react negatively, but leverage would make it more positive. So the curve would show a steeper rise for negative shocks compared to positive ones of the same magnitude.

Looking at the options, option A says negative shocks react faster. So the curve would rise more quickly for negative than for positive. Option B is symmetric, which would happen if the effect was the same regardless of the shock's direction, but leverage makes it asymmetric.

Option C is the opposite of A, so that's not right. Option D says it's zero for positive shocks, which would mean no effect, but leverage would mean a positive effect, so D isn't correct.

So the correct answer should be A. Because leverage amplifies the effect of negative shocks more than positive ones. So when a negative disturbance occurs, the market's response accelerates, making the curve steeper for negatives.

The correct answer is **A: It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude**. 

**Explanation:** The leverage effect amplifies the impact of negative shocks, causing the market to react more rapidly. This results in a steeper rise for negative disturbances compared to positive ones, making option A correct.
