Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find a positive integer N such that both N and N squared end with the same four digits abcd. And importantly, the first digit a can't be zero, which means the last four digits can't start with zero. The question is asking for the three-digit number abc, and the options are given from A to J.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, N and N² both end with the same four digits. That's interesting because it implies that when you square N, the last four digits remain the same. So mathematically, this means that N² ≡ N mod 10000. Because if two numbers end with the same four digits, their difference is a multiple of 10000. So, N² - N ≡ 0 mod 10000.

Let me write that down: N² - N ≡ 0 mod 10000. I can factor this equation as N(N - 1) ≡ 0 mod 10000. So, N(N - 1) must be divisible by 10000. Since 10000 factors into 2^4 * 5^4, the product N(N-1) must be divisible by both 16 and 625 (since 16*625=10000 and they're coprime). 

But wait, N and N-1 are consecutive integers, meaning they are coprime. So, they don't share any common factors. That means one of them must be divisible by 16 and the other by 625. Because 16 and 625 are co-prime, their product is 10000.

So, there are two cases to consider:

1. N is divisible by 16 and N-1 is divisible by 625.
2. N is divisible by 625 and N-1 is divisible by 16.

Let me consider each case.

Case 1: N ≡ 0 mod 16 and N ≡ 1 mod 625.

So, N ≡ 0 mod 16 → N = 16k for some integer k.

And N ≡ 1 mod 625 → 16k ≡ 1 mod 625. I need to solve for k in this congruence.

So, 16k ≡ 1 mod 625. To find k, I can compute the modular inverse of 16 mod 625.

What's the inverse of 16 mod 625? Let me find some integer m such that (16*m) mod 625 =1.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

Find m such that 16m ≡1 mod 625.

Let me compute GCD(16, 625). Since 625 = 16*39 + 1 (because 16*39=624, so 625-624=1). So, GCD is 1, which means the inverse exists.

Now, working backwards:

1 = 625 - 16*39.

So, 1 ≡ (-39)*16 mod 625. Therefore, the inverse of 16 mod 625 is -39. But we can make it positive by adding 625: -39 + 625 = 586.

So, k ≡ 586 mod 625. Therefore, k = 586 + 625t for some integer t.

Thus, N = 16k = 16*(586 + 625t) = 16*586 + 16*625t. Let's compute 16*586.

16*500=8000, 16*86=1376 → 8000+1376=9376.

So, N = 9376 + 10000t.

So, the N in this case is 9376 mod 10000. Let's see if that's the case.

Wait, 9376 is a four-digit number. So, N could be 9376. Let's check if N squared ends with 9376.

Compute 9376 squared. Let me approximate:

9376^2 = (9000 + 376)^2 = 9000² + 2*9000*376 + 376².

But maybe a better approach is to compute 9376 mod 10000 and then square it. But 9376 squared is (9376)^2. Let me compute the last four digits.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 9376^2 mod 10000. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 9376 * 9376 mod 10000.

But 9376 * 9376: the last four digits would be (9376^2) mod 10000.

Alternatively, let's compute 9376 * 9376. Let me compute 9376 * 9376 in parts.

Wait, maybe a smarter approach. Since 9376 mod 10000 is 9376, then 9376^2 mod 10000 is equal to (9376)^2 mod 10000.

But let me compute 9376^2:

9376 * 9376:

I can compute this step by step.

But perhaps it's easier to note that (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². Let me set a = 9000, b=376.

So, (9000 + 376)^2 = 9000² + 2*9000*376 + 376².

Compute each term:

9000² = 81,000,000.

2*9000*376 = 2*9000 * 376 = 18,000 * 376.

Let me compute 18,000 * 376. 18,000 * 300 = 5,400,000; 18,000 *76= 1,368,000. So total is 5,400,000 + 1,368,000 = 6,768,000.

376² is 141,376.

So adding them all together: 81,000,000 + 6,768,000 = 87,768,000; plus 141,376 gives 87,909,376.

So, 9376^2 is 87,909,376. Therefore, the last four digits are 9376. So yes, 9376 squared ends with 9376. So, N=9376 is a solution in case 1.

But wait, the question says that the first digit 'a' is non-zero. So, in this case, N=9376. The last four digits are 9376, so a=9, which is non-zero. That fits the condition.

So, this N is a candidate, and the abc would be 937, which is option C (since the options are A:491, B:254, C:625, D:812, E:368, F:789, G:937, H:673, I:123, J:456). So, option G is 937, which would be the abc.

Wait, but let me check case 2 to see if there's another solution.

Case 2: N ≡ 0 mod 625 and N ≡1 mod 16.

So, N ≡0 mod 625 → N=625k for some integer k.

And N ≡1 mod 16 → 625k ≡1 mod16.

Compute 625 mod16. 16*39=624, so 625 mod16 is 1. Therefore, 625k mod16 is k mod16. So, we have k ≡1 mod16.

So, k =16m +1 for integer m.

Thus, N=625*(16m+1)=625*16m +625*1=10000m +625.

So, N=10000m +625, but we're considering N mod10000, so N=625 mod10000.

Therefore, N=625 is a possible solution. Let's check if 625 squared ends with 625.

Compute 625^2: 625*625.

Well, 625*625 is 390,625. So, last four digits are 0625. So, the last four digits are 0625. But according to the problem, the first digit 'a' must be non-zero. Here, a=0, which is not allowed. Therefore, N=625 is not a valid solution because the first digit is zero. So, this case doesn't yield a valid N.

So, the only valid solution is N=9376, which gives abc=937. So, the correct answer is option G:937.
</think>

The problem requires finding a positive integer N where both N and N² end with the same four digits, with the first digit non-zero. This leads to solving N² ≡ N mod 10000, which factors into N(N-1) ≡ 0 mod 16 and mod 625. Two cases were considered, leading to N=9376 as the valid solution. Thus, the three-digit number abc is 937.
