Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the total pressure of a gas mixture in a vessel. Hmm, I remember that when there are different gases in a container, their pressures add up when you're dealing with ideal gases. Oh right, that's the combined gas law or something like that.

So the vessel's volume is given as 22.4 dm³. Wait, I think at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters, which is 22.4 dm³. But wait, the temperature here is 273.15 K, which is 0 degrees Celsius. Oh wait, that's actually STP conditions! Because STP is a standard temperature and pressure, which is 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm pressure.

Wait, so if the volume is 22.4 dm³, that's exactly 1 mole of any gas at STP. But wait, the problem says there are 2.0 moles of hydrogen and 1.0 mole of nitrogen. So total moles would be 3 moles. Because 2 +1 =3.

Since each mole of gas at STP contributes 1 mole × 1 atm = 1 atm. So, 3 moles would give a pressure of 3 atm. Wait, but wait—what's the unit here? Let me think. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. At STP, P is 1 atm, V is 22.4 dm³, n is 1, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. So P = (nRT)/V. Plugging in, (1 mol)(0.0821)(273) / 22.4. Let me compute that: 0.0821 * 273 ≈ 22.4. So 22.4 /22.4 = 1 atm. Yep, that makes sense.

But wait, no, in this case, the vessel's volume is 22.4 dm³, which is 0.0224 m³, but I think I can ignore that because the units in the ideal gas law are in liters when using R=0.0821, which is in L·atm.

So each mole of gas contributes 1 atm when at STP. So the total pressure should be 3 atm. Let me look at the options. Option G is 3.0 atm. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but another way to think about it: when the container isn't at STP, the pressure would be higher or lower? No, wait. Because at 273 K (which is STP's temperature), the pressure would still be based on the number of moles and the volume. Because the volume here is exactly 22.4 dm³, which is 1 mole of gas. So each mole of gas would contribute 1 atm, so 3 moles give 3 atm. So the answer is G.

The problem involves calculating the total pressure of a gas mixture in a vessel at 273.15 K (STP conditions). At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 dm³ and exerts a pressure of 1 atm. The vessel has a volume of 22.4 dm³, which corresponds to 1 mole of any gas under these conditions. The vessel contains 2.0 moles of hydrogen (H₂) and 1.0 mole of nitrogen (N₂), making a total of 3 moles of gas.

Since the pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of its components, and each mole of gas contributes 1 atm at STP, the total pressure of 3 moles of gas is 3 atm. Among the given options, the correct answer is:
