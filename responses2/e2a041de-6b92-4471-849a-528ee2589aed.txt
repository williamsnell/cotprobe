Okay, I need to figure out which organizational culture delivers stability and efficiency. Let's break this down. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that organizational cultures can be a mix of different systems. The question is about which system is best for stability and efficiency. I think each term refers to different structures or principles in how people interact and the goals they aim for.

Option A is Power culture. I recall that power culture emphasizes hierarchy and control. People feel like they have the right to make decisions and are respected. This could lead to stability because there's clear authority, but it might not be efficient if everyone's tied to a single leader or if there's a lack of collaboration.

Option B is Clan culture. Clans are close-knit groups where members have close relationships. I'm pretty sure clan cultures are stable because of strong bonds and shared values. However, they might lack the flexibility needed for efficient operations unless the group is very organized.

Option C is Network culture. This is about people working together in teams with shared goals. I think network cultures foster collaboration and communication, which can improve efficiency. They also provide a sense of belonging, which contributes to stability. Plus, when people work together, they might be more motivated and efficient as a team.

Option D is Role culture. This involves assigning specific roles to each person, which can lead to a lot of structure and rules. While this can enforce discipline and efficiency, it might create a rigid structure that makes it hard to adapt to changes in the environment. It could lead to a lack of flexibility and might not be the most efficient in dynamic situations.

Option E is Task culture. This is about assigning tasks and letting people handle them. It's flexible and can adapt to changes, which might help with efficiency and stability. But I'm not sure if it's as effective as network culture in terms of stability. It's more about the execution phase, not the higher-level structure.

Option F is People culture. This is a broad term that can encompass various other systems. It's about the relationships and interactions within the organization. People culture emphasizes trust and open communication, which is great for efficiency. However, it might lack the structure of other systems like network culture if not properly organized.

Putting it all together, I think network culture (option C) is probably the best choice. It provides a structured environment with shared goals, fosters collaboration, and builds a strong sense of community. This can lead to both stability and efficiency because it encourages teamwork and reduces the need for individual power struggles. Clan culture (B) is also stable but might not offer the same level of collaboration. Power culture (A) and task culture (E) are more about control and flexibility, which could work, but they might not support the same level of efficiency unless the structure is very tight.

Role culture (D) is more about hierarchy and structure, which might not be as efficient as network culture in handling varied tasks and ensuring everyone is on the same page.

The most stable and efficient organizational culture is network culture (C), as it fosters collaboration, shared goals, and strong relationships, providing a structured environment conducive to both stability and efficiency.
