Okay, so I've got this logic question here. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking me to translate the statement "Some students work hard" into predicate logic, and there are several options to choose from. I'm a bit new to predicate logic, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand what "some students work hard" really means. "Some" in logic usually translates to an existential quantifier, which is "there exists" or ∃. So, there is at least one student who works hard.

Now, let's think about the subjects and predicates. The students are probably a class, so maybe we can use a predicate like Sx for "x is a student" and Wx for "x works hard." So, the statement is about a student (x) who works hard.

Putting that together, "some students work hard" would translate to a statement saying that there exists an x such that x is a student and x works hard. In predicate logic, that would be ∃x (Sx ∧ Wx). Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that directly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option H is (∃x)(Wx • Sx). Oh, that's the same as what I just thought. So, H seems correct. But wait, another option is F: (∀x)(Wx • Sx). No, that's a universal statement saying all students work hard. But the original statement is just some, so F can't be right.

Another thought: Maybe I should consider the order of the predicates. The conjunction here is Sx ∧ Wx. So, it's "x is a student" and "x works hard." So, in logic, that's written as Sx ∧ Wx. So, the correct part is ∃x (Sx ∧ Wx), which matches option H.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another option is D: (∃x)(Sx • Wx). That’s the same as H, so that's fine.

Option G is (∃x)(Sx ∨ Wx), which would mean that x is a student or works hard. That doesn't make sense because "some" implies that both are true, not either/or. So, G is not correct.

Option A is (∃x)(Sx ⊃ Wx). That translates to "if x is a student, then x works hard." But that's not the same as "some students work hard." Because "some" doesn't mean all. So A is not correct.

Option B is (∃x)(Wx ⊃ Sx). That would mean "if x works hard, then x is a student." That doesn't make sense because working hard doesn't imply being a student. So B is incorrect.

Option C is (∀x)(Sx • Wx), which is a universal statement. We only need existence, so C is too strong.

Option E is (∀x)(Sx ∨ Wx). Again, that's an OR, meaning for all x, x is a student OR works hard. That doesn't capture 'some' correctly. So E is wrong.

Option I is ∀x (Sx → Wx), which is similar to A but with a different structure. It says every student works hard, which is stronger than "some." So I's not correct.

Option J is ∃x (Wx ∨ Sx). Wait, that's an OR, same as E, but wait, J is OR. So J translates to "there exists an x such that x works hard OR x is a student." Which is different from our original statement. Our original is about both, so J is not the same.

So the correct answer is H: (∃x)(Wx • Sx). Because it's an existential statement, and it uses the conjunction to capture that both conditions are true for some x.

The correct translation of "Some students work hard" is represented by option H: (∃x)(Wx • Sx), as it accurately captures the existence of a student who works hard.

Answer: H
