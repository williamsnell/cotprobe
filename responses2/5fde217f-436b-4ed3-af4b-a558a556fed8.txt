Question:

Which of the following statements about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer?

Options:

A: Nonsampling risk can be completely eliminated with careful planning.
B: Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.
C: Sampling risk is only applicable when the auditor tests each item in the population.
D: Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.
E: Nonsampling risk is eliminated when a substantive test is restricted to a sample.
F: Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.
G: Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about audit sampling risks, and I need to figure out which statement is correct for a nonissuer. Let me take it step by step.

First, what do I know about audit sampling? I remember that audit sampling is a method where a sample of items is tested rather than the entire population. This approach helps auditors assess the financial statements' integrity. There are two main types of sampling risks: sampling risk and non-sampling risk.

Wait, the question is specifically about non-sampling risk. I think non-sampling risks are about factors other than the sampling method that could affect the audit outcome. So these include issues like sampling bias, non-statistical sampling, and the auditor's judgment. Non-sampling risks can't be eliminated with perfect planning because they involve unpredictable factors.

Now, the options:

Option A: Non-sampling risk can be completely eliminated with careful planning. I don't think so. Because non-sampling risks involve things like selection bias, sample size, and other factors that can't be controlled. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. Wait, no, I think that's more about selection risk. Or is it? I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, I remember the types of sampling risks. There are selection risk and application risk. Selection risk is the risk that the sample doesn't represent the population (like non-representative selection). Application risk is the risk that the auditor's judgment in applying audit procedures might be incorrect. So B says sampling risk is from applying procedures, which seems to be application risk, not selection. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Sampling risk is only applicable when testing each item in the population. No, that doesn't make sense. Sampling is used when testing each item isn't practical or feasible. So C is incorrect because it's applicable only when testing each item, which isn't the case for non-sampling risks. Non-sampling risks are separate from selection.

Option D: Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting procedures that are not appropriate. I'm not sure. Wait, I think sampling risk refers to the risk that the sample chosen isn't representative. So selection risk would be about selecting the wrong items. But D says it's about selecting procedures that are inappropriate. That doesn't sound right because selection risk is about the items, not the procedures. So D might be incorrect.

Option E: Nonsampling risk is eliminated when a substantive test is restricted to a sample. So, for example, when a company does a test and only looks at a sample instead of the whole, does that eliminate non-sampling risks? I'm not so sure. Non-sampling risks are separate from sample selection. Even if the sample is taken, there can still be non-sampling issues like bias. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Nonsampling risk arises because a test is restricted to a sample, leading to different conclusions. So if you only test a sample, the auditor might conclude different things. For example, if the sample has high errors, the conclusion about the whole population might be different. That sounds correct because non-sampling risks are about factors other than sampling. So F seems correct.

Option G: Nonsampling risk arises because the auditor failed to recognize misstatements. Wait, I thought nonsampling risk is about factors like selection bias or incorrect estimation. Recognizing misstatements is more about selection risk. So G is incorrect.

Let me double-check. Non-sampling risk includes a range of issues like selection bias, non-statistical sampling, and estimation errors. Non-sampling risk is about other factors that can affect the audit outcome, not about the auditor's own judgment or selection.

So, going back to the options:

Option F correctly states that nonsampling risk arises from restricting a test to a sample, leading to possible conclusions. So F is the correct answer.

The correct answer is:

**F: Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.**

**Explanation:**
Nonsampling risk encompasses various factors such as selection bias, non-statistical sampling, and estimation errors. These risks are not tied to the auditor's judgment or selection but rather to other uncontrollable factors. When a test is limited to a sample, it can lead to different conclusions compared to testing each item, a result that stems from non-sampling risks.
