Okay, so I've got this question about the weight of 1,000 cubic feet of air at STP. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that STP stands for Standard Temperature and Pressure. I think that means 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere pressure. Oh wait, yeah, STP conditions are commonly used in chemistry and gas calculations. I've heard that at STP, one mole of any gas occupies a certain volume. So, I think the molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 liters. Wait, but wait, I should make sure. Oh right, 22.4 liters per mole is that right? Yeah, I think that's correct.

But wait, the question is about cubic feet. Oh, right, I might need to convert cubic feet to liters because the molar volume is in liters. So, 1 cubic foot is how many liters? Let me think. One foot is about 0.3048 meters, so one cubic foot is (0.3048)^3 cubic meters. Let me calculate that. 0.3048^3 is approximately 0.0283168 cubic meters. Since 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters, that's 28.3168 liters per cubic foot. So, 1,000 cubic feet would be 28,316.8 liters.

Now, since 1 mole is 22.4 liters, the number of moles in 28,316.8 liters is about 28,316.8 / 22.4. Let me compute that. 28,316.8 divided by 22.4. Let's see: 22.4 * 1260 = 28,224. So 28,316.8 - 28,224 = 92.8. 92.8 /22.4 = 4.14. So total moles would be approximately 1264.14 moles.

Wait, but wait, that's a lot. So, if each mole is 22.4 liters, 28,316.8 liters is about 1264 moles. But wait, no, 22.4 * 1264 = 28,224, yes. So, 28,316.8 minus 28,224 is 92.8 liters, which is 92.8/22.4=4.14, so 1264 +4.14=1268.14 moles. So, about 1268 moles.

But wait, I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. 22.4 liters per mole. So 28,316.8 liters / 22.4 L/mol = let me compute that. 22.4 * 1268 = 22.4 * 1200 = 26,880; 22.4 *68=1523.2; total 26880+1523.2=28403.2. Oh wait, but 22.4 *1268 is 28,316. So, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me do exact division. 28,316.8 liters / 22.4 L/mol. Let's see, 22.4 into 28,316.8.

22.4 * 1268 = 22.4 *1200=26,880. 22.4 *68: 22 *68=1496, 0.4 *68=27.2 → 1496+27.2=1523.2. So total 26880 + 1523.2 = 28,403.2. But the liters are 28,316.8, which is less than that. So, 28,316.8 /22.4 = 1268 - (86.4/22.4) → 86.4 /22.4 is approximately 3.857. So, 1268 -3.857 = 1264.14 moles. So, approximately 1264 moles.

Wait, but wait another thing. Since I'm dealing with 1000 cubic feet, which is about 28,316.8 liters, but perhaps I can find another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the density of air. Because if I know the density, then I can multiply by volume to get mass.

Oh right, the density of air under STP conditions is approximately 1.293 kg/m³. Wait, but wait, what's the unit of volume I'm using? If I use liters, then density would be in kg/L, or grams per liter.

Wait, 1,000 cubic feet is equal to about 28,316.8 liters. So, if the density is 1.293 kg/m³, then in kg per liter, since 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so density is 1.293 kg/m³ = 1.293 kg / 1000 L → 0.001293 kg/L. Or, 1293 grams per liter. So, 0.001293 kg/L × 28,316.8 L = ?

Calculating that: 0.001293 kg/L *28,316.8 L = (0.001293)(28,316.8) kg. Let's compute that. 0.001293 * 28,316.8 ≈ Let's see, 0.001 *28,316.8 =28.3168 kg. 0.000293 *28,316.8 → 0.000293*28316.8 ≈ let's compute 28,316.8 *0.000293 → 28,316.8 * 0.0002=5.66336, 0.000093=2.649. So approximately 5.66336 +2.649 =8.31236. So adding to 28.3168 +8.31236 ≈36.629 kg. So about 36.63 kg of air.

Wait, but the question asks for the weight in ounces. Oh, right, because the options are in ounces, not kilograms. So I need to convert kilograms to ounces.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So 1 kg is about 35.27396 ounces. So 36.63 kg *35.27396 oz/kg ≈ let's compute that.

36.63 ×35.27396 = let me compute. 35 ×36.63=1282.05. 0.27396 ×36.63 ≈10.00. So total around 1292.05 ounces. Wait, but wait, I'm getting 1292 oz. Looking at the options, option C is 1.00 ×10^3 which is 1000 oz, D is 8.00×10^2 which is 800, F is 1.5e3=1500, G is 1.29e3=1290, H is 1.5e2=150, etc. So my calculation comes out to approximately 1292 oz, which is close to option G: 1.29 ×10^3, which is 1290. So that's matching.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I did the unit conversions correctly. Let me double-check each step.

Wait another approach: The density of air at STP is approximately 1.29 kg/m³. 1 m³ is 35.3147 cubic feet. So 1 m³ =35.3147 ft³. So, 1.29 kg/m³ → 1.29 kg / 35.3147 ft³ → approximately 0.03646 kg/ft³. That's about 36.46 grams per cubic foot. But wait, that's per cubic foot.

So, 1,000 cubic feet * 36.46 grams per cubic foot = 36,460 grams, or 36.46 kg. Which matches the earlier calculation. So 36.46 kg is approximately 1290 ounces (since 1 kg=35.27396 oz, so 36.46 ×35.27396 ≈ 1284.8 ). So that's about 1285 ounces, which rounds to 1.29e3 oz, which is option G.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall the formula for the weight of gases. The molar mass of air is about 28.97 g/mol. At STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L. Wait, no, 22.4 liters per mole. So, 1,000 L of air would be 1,000 /22.4 mol. Let me compute that: 1,000 /22.4 ≈44.64 mol.

Then, the mass would be moles × molar mass. Molar mass of air (assuming it's mostly diatomic, O2 and N2) is approx (2 ×28) + (32) = 56 +32=88 g/mol? Wait, no, wait, O2 is 32 g/mol, N2 is 28. So for each mole of air, it's (28 +32 ) =60 g/mol. So 44.64 mol ×60 g/mol = 2678.4 grams, which is 2678.4 /1000 = 2.6784 kg. Wait, that's different from the earlier 36 kg. Wait wait, this can't be right. Wait what's wrong?

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in calculating the molar mass. Let me think again. Molecular formulas: air is approximately 78% nitrogen (N2), 21% oxygen (O2), and 0.9% other gases. So the average molar mass would be (0.78 *28) + (0.21 *32) + (0.01 *30). Let's compute that: 0.78 *28=21.84, 0.21*32=6.72, 0.01*30=0.3. Summing them: 21.84 +6.72=28.56; +0.3=28.86. So molar mass is about 28.86 g/mol.

So, 1,000 L /22.4 L/mol = ~44.64 mol. So 44.64 mol ×28.86 g/mol = ?

44.64 ×28.86 → let's compute that. 40 ×28.86=1,154.4; 4.64 ×28.86 ≈4.64 *28=129.92, 4.64 *0.86= approx 3.99. So total ≈129.92 +3.99=133.91. So 1,154.4 +133.91=1,288.31 grams → about 1288.31 grams, which is 1.288 kg.

But wait, this is way different from the 36 kg I got earlier. So which approach is correct? Oh, wait, maybe because I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the molar mass. Let me think again. Nitrogen is 14 g/mol, so N2 is 28. Oxygen is 16, O2 is 32. So each mole of air is 28 (N2) +32 (O2) =60 g/mol. So 1,000 L is 44.64 mol, so 44.64 *60 = 2678.4 grams → 2.678 kg.

But that contradicts the other method. So what's going on here? There's a discrepancy. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the density approach is more accurate. Let me go back. Using the density of air at STP: 1.293 kg/m³. 1 m³ is 35.3147 ft³. So, density in kg/ft³ is 1.293 kg/m³ * (1 m³ /35.3147 ft³) → approximately 1.293 /35.3147 ≈0.03657 kg/ft³.

So, 1,000 ft³ * 0.03657 kg/ft³=36.57 kg. So 36.57 kg is 36,570 grams which is 36.57 kg. Now, convert kg to ounces: 1 kg is 35.27396 ounces. So 36.57 kg *35.27396 = ?

36.57 *35.27396 → let's compute this.

36 *35.27396 = 36 *35 =1260, 36 *0.27396 ≈9.86256 → total 1269.86256.

Now, 0.57 *35.27396 → approx 20.02. So total is 1269.86256 + 20.02 ≈1289.88 ounces. Which is approximately 1,289.88 ounces. So rounding, that's about 1.29e3 ounces, matching option G again.

So the correct answer seems to be 1.29 ×10^3 oz, which is option G.

To determine the weight of 1,000 cubic feet of air at STP, we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert cubic feet to liters**:  
   At STP, 1 cubic foot is approximately 28.3168 liters. Thus, 1,000 cubic feet = 28,316.8 liters.

2. **Determine the density of air at STP**:  
   The density of air at STP is approximately 1.293 kg/m³. Since 1 m³ = 35.3147 ft³, the density in kg/ft³ is:  
   \[
   1.293 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times \frac{1 \, \text{m}^3}{35.3147 \, \text{ft}^3} \approx 0.03657 \, \text{kg/ft}^3
   \]

3. **Calculate the mass of air**:  
   Multiply the volume in cubic feet by the density:  
   \[
   28,316.8 \, \text{ft}^3 \times 0.03657 \, \text{kg/ft}^3 \approx 1,036.8 \, \text{kg}
   \]

4. **Convert kilograms to ounces**:  
   Using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{kg} \approx 35.27396 \, \text{oz}\):  
   \[
   1,036.8 \, \text{kg} \times 35.27396 \, \text{oz/kg} \approx 36,570 \, \text{oz}
   \]

5. **Match the result to the options**:  
   The closest option is \(1.29 \times 10^3 \, \text{oz}\), which corresponds to option G.

Thus, the weight of 1,000 cubic feet of air at STP is approximately \(1.29 \times 10^3 \, \text{oz}\).
