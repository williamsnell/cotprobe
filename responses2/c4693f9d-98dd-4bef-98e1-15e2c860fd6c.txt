Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 145 plus 281 plus 62. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit nervous because addition can sometimes trip me up, but I'll take it step by step.

First, maybe I should add 145 and 281 together. Let's break it down. 145 plus 281. Maybe I'll add the hundreds, tens, and units separately. So, 100 + 200 is 300. Then the tens: 40 plus 80 is 120. And the ones: 5 plus 1 is 6. Adding those together, 300 + 120 is 420, plus 6 is 426. Wait, that seems right. So 145 plus 281 is 426. 

Now I need to add the third number, which is 62. So, 426 plus 62. Hmm, let's see. Adding 60 and 2. So 426 plus 60 is 486, then plus 2 is 488. So the total should be 488. 

Looking back at the options, option A is 488. So I think that's the right answer. But wait, let me double-check my addition just to be sure. Sometimes I might make a mistake in adding.

Another way to add is to line them up:

145
281
+62
------
Let's add the units place: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8.
Tens place: 4 + 8 + 6 = 18. So I write down 8 and carry over 1.
Hundreds place: 1 + 2 = 3, plus the carried over 1 makes 4.
So the total is 488. Yep, that matches what I did earlier. So the correct answer should be option A.

The correct answer is 488, which is option A.
