Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. The question is about dry ice in a fume hood and when it reaches a certain concentration, the person gets poisoned. I remember that dry ice is solid CO2, and when it sublimes, it turns into gaseous CO2. 

The setup says the fume hood is maintained at a constant pressure of 1.00 atm and a constant temperature of 27°C. The hood is closed, and the technician isn't conditioned, so he'll die if CO2 poisoning happens. The concentration that triggers the poisoning is 10% by volume. The question is, what's the minimum weight of dry ice needed to cause this, assuming no CO2 was present initially.

Wait, so dry ice is solid, and when it sublimes, it becomes gaseous CO2. The volume of CO2 in the hood depends on how much dry ice is sublimed. The fume hood's volume is 6000 liters. When the concentration reaches 10%, that means 10% of the volume is CO2. So, the volume of CO2 would be 0.1 * 6000 L = 600 liters.

But wait, the pressure is 1 atm. So, the volume of CO2 gas is 600 L, at 1 atm and 27°C. I think I can use the ideal gas law here to find out how many moles of CO2 are in the hood at that point.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Let's plug in the numbers. P is 1 atm, V is 600 L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), and T is 27°C which is 300 K (since 27+273=300).

So, n = (PV)/(RT) = (1 atm * 600 L) / (0.0821 * 300 K) 

Calculating the denominator: 0.0821 * 300 ≈ 24.63. So, 600 / 24.63 ≈ 24.38 moles of CO2.

Now, each mole of CO2 weighs how much? Molar mass of CO2 is 44 g/mol (since 12 for C and 16*2=32, so 12+32=44). So 24.38 moles * 44 g/mol = 1073.12 grams. Wait, wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation for n. 

So n = (1 * 600) / (0.0821 * 300) = 600 / (24.63) ≈ 24.38 moles. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 24.38 moles of CO2. Each mole has 44 grams, so 24.38 * 44 = let's compute that. 24 *44 = 1056, 0.38*44≈16.72. So total ≈ 1072.72 grams, which is about 1.0727 kg.

Wait, but the question is about dry ice. So, dry ice sublimed into CO2. But wait, the initial amount of dry ice is zero. So, the dry ice must sublimate to produce that CO2.

Wait, but wait: the fume hood is maintained at 1 atm and 27°C. So when dry ice is sublimated, it turns into gas at those conditions. So, the pressure is 1 atm, so the volume of CO2 is 6000 L? Wait, no. Wait, the fume hood is a closed system. But the condition is that the pressure is constant at 1 atm. So, when the CO2 is in the hood, it's held at 1 atm and 27°C.

Wait, but wait, the initial assumption is that the fume hood is at 1 atm and 27°C. So, when dry ice is sublimated, it turns into gaseous CO2, but the system's pressure remains at 1 atm. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because when you sublimate dry ice, the gaseous CO2 would have a certain volume. But since the system is closed and at constant pressure, maybe the volume of CO2 is fixed?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The volume at the time the concentration exceeds 10% is 600 L. So, the amount of CO2 needed is 600 L. But wait, the pressure is 1 atm, so using PV = nRT, n = PV/(RT) as before.

So the number of moles of CO2 is 24.38 moles. So, the moles of dry ice would need to be equal to that, because dry ice is a solid that sublimates into gaseous CO2.

Wait, but wait: when dry ice sublimates, it's solid to gas, so the moles of dry ice equals the moles of CO2. So, the mass of dry ice is moles * molar mass (44 g/mol). So, 24.38 *0.044 kg? Wait, no, 44 g/mol is 0.044 kg/mol? Wait, no: 1 mole is 44 grams. So, 24.38 * 44 g = let me calculate: 24.38 * 44 = (24 *44) + (0.38*44). 24*44=1056, 0.38*44=16.72. Total is 1072.72 grams, which is 1.07272 kg, approximately 1.073 kg.

But looking at the options, option D is 1.10 kg, which is close. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of n. Let me redo that part.

n = (P * V) / (RT) 

P is 1 atm, V is 600 L. 

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 300 K.

So,

n = (1 atm *600 L) / (0.0821 * 300) 

Compute denominator: 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63. So n = 600 / 24.63 ≈ 24.38 mol.

Yes, correct.

So, 24.38 mol * 44 g/mol = 1072.72 grams, which is 1.0727 kg. So, approximately 1.073 kg. 

Looking at the options, D is 1.10 kg. So that's the closest. But wait, let me think if I made any wrong assumptions.

Wait, the initial state is that the fume hood is maintained at 1 atm and 27 C. But when dry ice is sublimated, it's at 1 atm. So, the volume of the gas is fixed at 6000 L (since the pressure is 1 atm and volume is fixed?), so the CO2 doesn't expand or contract? I'm not sure. Oh, perhaps the initial volume is 6000 L, so when CO2 is added, it occupies that volume at 1 atm and 27°C.

Alternatively, perhaps the volume isn't fixed. Wait, but the question states that the hood is maintained at 1.00 atm and 27°C. So the volume of CO2 in the hood must be 6000 L (since 6000 L * 1 atm would give n via PV= nRT). So the volume of CO2 is 6000 L. So, the calculation is correct.

Wait, another thought: the initial state is 6000 liters of dry ice? Because the fume hood's volume is 6000. But wait, no, the fume hood is a container, so the volume is 6000 L, and when CO2 is added, it's at 1 atm and 27°C. So, the volume of CO2 is 6000 L. So yes, the calculation is correct.

So, the mass of dry ice needed is about 1.073 kg, which is approximately 1.10 kg. Looking at the options, option D is 1.10 kg, so that's the right answer.

To determine the minimum weight of dry ice required to exceed a 10% CO₂ concentration in a 6000 L fume hood at 1.00 atm and 27°C, the following analysis applies:

1. **Volume of CO₂ required**:  
   At 10% concentration by volume, the volume of CO₂ in the hood is:  
   \[
   0.10 \times 6000 \, \text{L} = 600 \, \text{L}.
   \]

2. **Number of moles of CO₂**:  
   Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), where \( P = 1.00 \, \text{atm} \), \( V = 600 \, \text{L} \), \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), and \( T = 27 + 273 = 300 \, \text{K} \):  
   \[
   n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(1.00)(600)}{(0.0821)(300)} \approx 24.38 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Mass of dry ice required**:  
   Since dry ice sublimates to form gaseous CO₂, the moles of dry ice required equal the moles of CO₂. The molar mass of CO₂ is \( 44 \, \text{g/mol} \). Thus:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of dry ice} = 24.38 \, \text{mol} \times 44 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 1072.72 \, \text{g} = 1.073 \, \text{kg}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with options**:  
   The closest option to \( 1.073 \, \text{kg} \) is \( 1.10 \, \text{kg} \) (Option D).

Thus, the minimum weight of dry ice required to cause CO₂ poisoning is approximately **1.10 kg**.
