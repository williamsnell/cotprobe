Okay, so I have this problem where Peter bought a typewriter and needs to calculate the total amount he paid after applying discounts, state tax, and city tax. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the original price is $125. There's a 5% discount. I need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price to get the discounted price. 

Calculating 5% of 125: 0.05 * 125 = 6.25. So, the discount is $6.25. Subtracting that from 125 gives 125 - 6.25 = $118.75. That's the price after the discount.

Next, I need to apply the state sales tax of 4.5%. To find the tax, I'll multiply the discounted price by 4.5%. 

Calculating 4.5% of 118.75: 0.045 * 118.75. Let me do that math. 0.045 * 100 is 4.5, and 0.045 * 18.75 is 0.84375. So adding them gives 4.5 + 0.84375 = $5.34375. So the state tax is $5.34 (rounded to the nearest cent).

Adding that to the discounted price: 118.75 + 5.34 = $124.09.

Now, I need to add the city tax of 2.5%. So again, I'll calculate 2.5% of $124.09.

0.025 * 124.09. Let's see: 0.025 is the same as 2.5%, so 124.09 * 0.025. Breaking it down: 100 * 0.025 is 2.5, 24 * 0.025 is 0.6, and 0.09 * 0.025 is 0.00225. Adding these together: 2.5 + 0.6 = 3.1, plus 0.00225 is 3.10225. So approximately $3.10.

Adding this to the total after state tax: 124.09 + 3.10 = $127.19.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check my calculations again because I'm a bit confused. Because when I calculated the state tax, I think I might have made a mistake in the steps. Let me redo the state tax calculation.

Original after discount: $118.75.

State tax: 4.5% of 118.75. Let's compute 118.75 * 0.045.

Calculating 118.75 * 0.045: 118.75 * 0.04 = 4.75, and 118.75 * 0.005 = 0.59375. Adding them gives 4.75 + 0.59375 = $5.34375. So that's $5.34 when rounded.

Adding to 118.75: 118.75 + 5.34 = 124.09.

Then city tax: 2.5% of 124.09. Let's compute 124.09 * 0.025.

124.09 * 0.025: 0.025 is 1/40, so 124.09 / 40 = 3.10225. So $3.10.

Adding to 124.09: 124.09 + 3.10 = 127.19.

But looking at the options, there's an option D: $127.06 and J: $118.75. Hmm, none of the options match 127.19. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me go through the problem again.

Original price: $125.

5% discount: 125 * 0.05 = 6.25. So new price is 125 -6.25= $118.75.

State tax is 4.5% on 118.75: 118.75 * 0.045.

Calculating that: 118.75 * 0.045.

Let me compute 118.75 * 0.04 = 4.75, and 118.75 * 0.005 = 0.59375. So 4.75 + 0.59375 = 5.34375, so $5.34.

Adding to 118.75: 118.75 +5.34 = $124.09.

Then city tax: 2.5% of 124.09: 124.09 * 0.025.

Which is 124.09 *0.025.

Let me compute that as 124.09 * (1/40) = 3.10225, so $3.10.

Adding to 124.09: 124.09 +3.10= $127.19.

Wait, but the options don't have this exact amount. Let's check the options again:

A: $133.28

B: $129.37

C: $135.31

D: $127.06

E: $118.75

F: $120.45

G: $125.00

H: $130.00

I: $132.50

J: $118.75

Hmm. So the closest option is D: $127.06. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in addition. Let me re-calculate the city tax.

Alternatively, perhaps the city tax is applied before the state tax. But no, typically, both are applied after the discount, but in this case, the problem says state and city taxes are applied after the discount.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should calculate the total tax as a single percentage. Or perhaps the tax is calculated on the original amount before the discount. But the problem says Peter bought it, applied discount, then tax. So no, no, the discount is applied first.

Wait, did I calculate 2.5% of 124.09 correctly? Let me compute 124.09 multiplied by 0.025.

124.09 * 0.025:

124.09 × 0.025 = ?

Another approach: 124.09 × 25 = 3102.25 (since 25 is 1/40, as above.)

Wait, no, 0.025 is 1/40, so 124.09 /40 = 3.10225, which is $3.10.

So adding to 124.09: 124.09 + 3.10 = 127.19.

But none of the options is exactly 127.19. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the state tax. Let's compute 4.5% of 118.75 again.

4.5% is 4% + 0.5%.

4% of 118.75 is 4.75, and 0.5% is 0.59375. So total 5.34375, which rounds to 5.34. So 118.75 +5.34=124.09.

Then city tax: 2.5% of 124.09.

2.5% is 1/40. So 124.09 /40= 3.10225, which is $3.10. So 124.09 +3.10=127.19.

Hmm. But the options don't include 127.19. So perhaps I made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, wait, perhaps the 4.5% is 4.5% tax on the discounted price, which is 118.75. So 118.75 * 4.5% is 5.34375, which is $5.34 when rounded to the nearest cent. So 118.75 +5.34=124.09.

Then 2.5% on 124.09 is 3.10225, which is $3.10.

So 124.09 +3.10=127.19.

But none of the options is 127.19. The closest option is D: $127.06, which is about $0.13 less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the total tax.

Alternative approach: perhaps all taxes are applied before the discount? No, that doesn't make sense because the discount is applied first.

Wait, perhaps the order is different. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the state and city taxes are both applied on the discounted price, which I did correctly. But perhaps I should calculate the taxes as a combined percentage. Let me see.

Wait, 4.5% + 2.5% = 7% tax. But that's not correct because tax is calculated on the amount after discount. So no, the tax rates are on the discounted price. So the total tax is 7% of the discounted price.

Wait, so 7% of 118.75 is 8.3125. So total price is 118.75 +8.3125=127.0625, which is $127.06.

Ah! That makes sense. So perhaps I should compute the combined tax rate as 7% and then apply it to the discounted price.

Wait, that's a different approach, and it gives one of the options.

So, 7% of 118.75 is 8.3125. So adding to 118.75: 118.75 +8.3125 = 127.0625, which is $127.06. So that's option D.

So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I misapplied the tax calculation. Instead of calculating each tax separately and adding, I should have calculated the combined tax rate.

So perhaps the correct approach is to compute 7% (4.5 +2.5) of the discounted price (118.75) and add it to the discounted price.

So:

118.75 * 0.07 = ?

118.75 * 0.07: 100 * 0.07 =7, 18.75 *0.07=1.3125. So 7 +1.3125=8.3125.

So the total tax is $8.3125, which is $8.31 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Adding that to 118.75: 118.75 +8.31=127.06, which is option D.

So the correct answer must be D: $127.06.

I think I made a mistake earlier by calculating each tax separately, which seems incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate the total tax as the sum of the two percentages (4.5% +2.5% =7%) applied to the discounted price. So the total amount is the discounted price plus 7% of that.
</think>

The problem requires calculating the total amount Peter paid for a typewriter, including a 5% discount, 4.5% state tax, and 2.5% city tax. 

1. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   - Original price: $125
   - Discount: 5% of $125 = $6.25
   - Discounted price: $125 - $6.25 = $118.75

2. **Calculate the combined tax rate:**
   - State tax: 4.5%
   - City tax: 2.5%
   - Combined tax rate: 4.5% + 2.5% = 7%

3. **Apply the combined tax rate to the discounted price:**
   - Tax amount: 7% of $118.75 = $8.3125 (rounded to $8.31)

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   - Total price: $118.75 + $8.31 = $127.06
