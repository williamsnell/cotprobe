Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many electrons, protons, and neutrons are in an atom of 52Cr. Let me think. I remember that the atomic number, which is the number of protons, is the same as the atomic number of the element. Chromium's atomic number is 24, right? So that means the nucleus has 24 protons. So the number of protons is definitely 24.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking about the atom, so I need to find the number of electrons and neutrons as well. Electrons... Oh, right. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons because the overall charge is neutral. So if protons are 24, electrons are also 24.

Now, neutrons. I think the formula for the mass number (which is the sum of protons and neutrons) is A = protons + neutrons. The question isn't giving me the mass number, but I think 52Cr refers to the mass number. So the mass number is 52. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait. I've heard that the mass number is the sum of the protons and neutrons. So if Cr has an atomic number of 24, then the mass number is 52. So 24 protons plus neutrons equals 52. So neutrons would be 52 minus 24, which is 28. So neutrons are 28.

Let me recap: protons are 24, electrons are 24, neutrons are 28. Now looking at the options. I need to find the option where electrons are 24, protons 24, and neutrons 28.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 28 electrons, 27 protons, 24 neutrons – nope, protons are 27 here.

Option B: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 27 neutrons – protons are correct, but neutrons are 27, which is 52-24=28, not 27. So B is wrong.

Option C: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 24. Nope, neutrons should be 28.

Option D: 24 electrons, 28 protons, 28. Protons are incorrect, they are 28, which is not 24.

Option E: 28 electrons, 24 protons, 24. Electrons are wrong.

Option F: 24 e, 28 protons, 24 neutrons. Wait, that's protons 28, which is wrong because Cr has 24 protons. So F is incorrect.

Option G: 27 e, 24 protons, 28 neutrons. Electrons are wrong here.

Option H: 24 e, 24 protons, 28 neutrons. Electrons are correct, but neutrons are 28. So that's correct on e and p, but wrong on neutrons. Because neutrons should be 24 (24 protons) +28 (neutrons)= 52.

Wait, wait. If H says 24 neutrons, that would make the mass number 24 (protons) +24 (neutrons) =48, which is not 52. So H is wrong.

Option J: 27 e, 27 protons, 24. So electrons are 27, which is wrong. Protons 27, also wrong. So J is incorrect.

So the only option that has electrons 24, protons 24, and neutrons 28 is option H. Wait, but earlier I thought 52 chromium has 24 protons, 24 electrons, 28 neutrons. Let me double-check.

Wait, chromium's atomic number is 24. So protons = 24. Electrons =24. Mass number is 52 (so 24 +28=52), so neutrons=28. So the correct option is H: 24 e, 24 p, 28 n. So looking at the options, option H is 24 e, 24 p, 28 n. So that's correct.

To determine the number of electrons, protons, and neutrons in an atom of 52Cr (chromium), we start with the atomic number, which is 24. This means:

- **Protons**: 24  
- **Electrons**: 24 (since the atom is neutral, electrons equal protons).  

The mass number for chromium is given as 52. The number of neutrons is calculated as:

- **Neutrons**: \( \text{Mass number} - \text{Number of protons} = 52 - 24 = 28 \).

Now, we evaluate the options provided:

- **Option A**: 28 electrons, 27 protons, 24 neutrons. Incorrect (protons and electrons are wrong).  
- **Option B**: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 27 neutrons. Incorrect (neutrons are wrong).  
- **Option C**: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 24 neutrons. Incorrect (neutrons are wrong).  
- **Option D**: 24 electrons, 28 protons, 28 neutrons. Incorrect (protons are wrong).  
- **Option E**: 28 electrons, 24 protons, 24 neutrons. Incorrect (electrons are wrong).  
- **Option F**: 24 electrons, 28 protons, 24 neutrons. Incorrect (protons are wrong).  
- **Option G**: 27 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons. Incorrect (electrons are wrong).  
- **Option H**: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons. Correct (matches all calculations).  
- **Option I**: 28 electrons, 28 protons, 24 neutrons. Incorrect (protons and electrons are wrong).  
- **Option J**: 27 electrons, 27 protons, 24 neutrons. Incorrect (protons and electrons are wrong).  

The correct option is **H: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons**.
