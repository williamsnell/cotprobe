Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about whether the normal force from the floor does work on a man in an elevator as it starts to ascend. The options are from A to J, each giving different answers.

Hmm, right. I remember that work is calculated as the force times the displacement in the direction of the force. So, work done W = F * d * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.

The elevator is starting to ascend, so acceleration is upwards. The normal force from the floor is equal to the man's weight when the elevator is stationary or moving at a constant velocity. But when it accelerates upwards, the normal force increases.

Wait, but when the elevator is accelerating, the man is not in free fall. So, he's experiencing an apparent weight increase. That makes the normal force greater than his actual weight. So, the normal force is larger than mg.

Now, what's the displacement? The man is moving upwards, right? So, the displacement of the man relative to the elevator is upwards. But the normal force is acting from the floor upward as well. Wait, the normal force is the force the floor applies on the man. So, the displacement of the man is upward, and the force is also upward.

So, the angle between them is zero degrees. Because the force is in the same direction as the displacement. Cosine of zero is 1. So, work done is positive. Because both force and displacement are in the same direction.

Wait, but the elevator is accelerating. So, when the elevator is accelerating upwards, the normal force is greater than mg. So, the man feels heavier, but the elevator is moving up. Oh, but the man is moving upward relative to the elevator? Or is he moving with the elevator?

Wait, no. The elevator is moving upwards, but the man's displacement is relative to the elevator? Or relative to the ground? The question says the elevator is ascending, so the man's displacement is upward relative to the elevator. Hmm, but the elevator's motion is also upwards. So, the man is moving with the elevator when he's standing there. Wait, no. Wait, the elevator is accelerating upwards, so the man is moving in the same direction as the elevator's acceleration. So, the man's displacement from the elevator is upward.

Wait, but in terms of the reference frame: when the elevator is accelerating upwards, the man's weight (as perceived from the elevator) becomes greater. But from the ground frame, the elevator is accelerating upwards, and the man is moving up.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the normal force's direction. When the elevator is accelerating upwards, the normal force is greater than mg. So, the man is being pushed up more than his actual weight.

But the displacement of the man relative to the elevator is upwards. Oh, but wait, the man is standing on the elevator. His displacement is relative to the elevator. So, he moves upward relative to the elevator. But the elevator itself is moving upward relative to the ground.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from frame of reference. The question asks whether the normal force does work on the man. So, from the man's perspective, the elevator is accelerating upward. But from the ground, the elevator is accelerating upward, and the man is moving up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ground frame. The elevator is accelerating upwards, so the man is moving in the same direction as the elevator's acceleration. The displacement of the man is upward relative to the elevator. So, the force (normal) is upward, and displacement is upward. So, the angle is zero, so cos(theta)=1. So, the work is positive.

Wait, but the elevator is accelerating, which means the man feels like he's being pushed harder. So, he feels like he's in an environment where the normal force is higher. But the question is about whether the normal force does work on him. 

Wait, the man's displacement relative to the elevator is upward. The normal force is upward. So, the angle between the force and displacement is zero. So, work done is positive. So, the work done is positive.

Wait, but the elevator is accelerating upwards. So, the man isn't in free fall. So, the apparent weight increases, but the direction of acceleration is upward. So, the displacement is upward, and the force is upward. So, same direction, so positive work.

So, the answer should be that the work done is positive. So, looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, positive. So, that's the correct answer.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose the elevator is accelerating upwards. The normal force is greater than mg. The displacement is upward relative to the elevator. So, the work done is (F_normal) * d * cos(0) = positive.

So, the correct answer is A: Yes, and the work done will be positive.

Wait, but what if the elevator is in free fall? Then the normal force would be zero, but the elevator starts to ascend, so it's not in free fall. So, in this case, the normal force is doing work.

Wait, but wait. If the elevator is moving upward with acceleration a, then the normal force is N = m(g + a) (since F_net = m(a) = mg + N, wait no. Wait, let me set up the equations.

When the elevator is accelerating upwards, the net force on the man is F_net = m*a.

The forces acting on the man are his weight (mg downward) and the normal force (upward). So,

N - mg = m*a.

So, N = m(g + a).

So, N is greater than mg. So, the normal force is larger than his weight.

Now, the man's displacement from the elevator is upward. So, displacement is in the same direction as the normal force. So, the work done is positive.

So, the correct answer is A: Yes, positive.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the elevator is accelerating upwards. So, in the frame of the elevator, the man is accelerating upwards. So, in that frame, the acceleration is upward, and his displacement is also upward. So, work done in that frame would be positive. But in the ground frame, the elevator is accelerating, and the displacement of the man is upward relative to the elevator.

Wait, but I think the work done is determined by the displacement relative to the reference frame. If the question is about the work done on the man by the normal force, it's the displacement of the man relative to the elevator, not the ground.

Because the normal force is from the elevator's floor, so it's exerted on the man. The work done by the normal force on the man is as per the displacement of the man relative to the elevator.

So, the displacement of the man relative to the elevator is upward, same direction as the normal force. So, the work is positive.

So, the correct answer is option A.

To determine whether the normal force from the floor does work on the man as the elevator ascends, we analyze the situation using the formula for work: 

\[
W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]

where \( F \) is the normal force, \( d \) is the displacement of the man relative to the elevator, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the force and the displacement.

1. **Normal Force and Displacement**:  
   The normal force \( N \) acts upward from the elevator's floor on the man. The displacement of the man relative to the elevator is also upward. Thus, the angle \( \theta \) between the normal force and the displacement is \( 0^\circ \), and \( \cos(0^\circ) = 1 \).

2. **Work Done**:  
   Since \( \cos(\theta) = 1 \), the work done by the normal force is positive. The normal force is greater than the man's weight (\( N = m(g + a) \), where \( a \) is the elevator's upward acceleration), and the displacement is upward. Therefore, the work done is positive.

3. **Elevator's Acceleration**:  
   The elevator's upward acceleration increases the normal force, but the displacement of the man relative to the elevator remains upward. Thus, the work done is consistent and positive.

4. **Other Options**:  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect, as the normal force is not conservative and does perform work.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect, as the normal force and displacement are not perpendicular.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect, as the man is moving relative to the elevator, so there is displacement.  
   - **Option E**: Incorrect, as the work is not zero.  
   - **Option F**: Incorrect, as the normal force does perform work.  
   - **Option G**: Incorrect, as the work cannot be determined without additional information about the acceleration.  
   - **Option H**: Incorrect, as the work is positive, not negative.  
   - **Option I**: Incorrect, as the sign of the work cannot be determined without knowing the acceleration.  
   - **Option J**: Incorrect, as the work is not zero.

The correct answer is that the work done by the normal force is positive.
