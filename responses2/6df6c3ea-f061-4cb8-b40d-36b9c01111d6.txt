Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that a particle of mass m is repelled from the origin by a force given by F = k/x³. I need to solve the equation of motion when the particle is initially at rest at a distance x₀ from the origin. The options are labeled A through J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. First, I remember that the force is related to the potential energy. The force is the negative gradient of the potential. So F = -dU/dx. Wait, but here the force is given as F = k/x³. So I'll have to find the potential energy.

Let me think: the force is F = -dU/dx, so if F = k/x³, then dU/dx = -k/x³. So integrating that with respect to x. So U(x) = ∫ (-k/x³) dx. Let me compute that. The integral of (-k)/x³ is (-k) * ∫ x^(-3) dx. The integral of x^n is x^(n+1)/(n+1), so n=-3: x^(-2)/(-2) is -1/(2x²). So multiplying by (-k) gives (k)/(2x²) + C, where C is the constant of integration. 

Wait, but for potential energy, the constant can be set to zero for simplicity, right? Because the potential can be defined up to a constant. So U(x) = k/(2x²) + something. Let me write U(x) as U = (k/(2x²)).

Wait, but I should include the negative sign from F = -dU/dx. Let me double-check. If F = -dU/dx, then dU/dx = -F. So in this case, F is k/x³, so dU/dx would be -k/x³. Then, U must be the integral of (-k/x³) dx. So integrating that gives U = (k/(2x²)) + C. So yes, the potential energy is U = k/(2x²) + C. I'll set C=0 for simplicity because it's just a constant, which doesn't affect the equations beyond a constant phase.

Now, the equation of motion. Newton's second law says F = ma. So F = k/x³ = m a. But acceleration a is the second derivative of x with respect to time, d²x/dt².

So, m * d²x/dt² = -k/x³. Wait, wait. Wait, F is the force, which is the negative gradient of U. So actually, F = -dU/dx. Earlier I thought F = k/x³, but let me correct that. Let's recompute U. 

So F = k/x³. Then, dU/dx = -F = -k/x³. So U(x) = ∫ (-k/x³) dx = (k/(2x²)) + C. So yes, U(x)=k/(2x²).

Then, the force is F = -dU/dx = -(-k/x³) = k/x³. Oh wait, that's correct. So the equation of motion is F = ma = k/x³. So m d²x/dt² = k/x³. Rearranged, that's d²x/dt² = (k)/(m x³).

So this is a second-order differential equation. Solving this might require some substitution. Let me consider using a substitution, perhaps using energy conservation. Because for forces depending on distance, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved.

E = (1/2) m v² + U(x) = constant.

But since the particle is initially at rest, initial velocity v is zero. So the initial kinetic energy is zero, and all the energy is potential. So at x = x₀, v = 0, so E = U(x₀) = k/(2 x₀²) + C. Wait, but for potential, we set C=0 earlier, so E = k/(2 x₀²).

So the equation of motion is (1/2) m v² + k/(2 x²) = k/(2 x₀²).

Let me write that as (1/2) m v² = k/(2 x²) - k/(2 x₀²). Multiply both sides by 2: m v² = k (1/x² - 1/x₀²). So v² = (k/m) (1/x² - 1/x₀²).

Taking square root, v = sqrt( (k/m) (1/x² - 1/x₀²) ). But since the particle is repelled, and x is increasing, velocity is positive. So we take the positive square root.

So v = dx/dt = sqrt( (k/m) ( 1/x² - 1/x₀² ) ).

Now, we can write this as:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k/m) ( (x₀² - x²) / (x² x₀²) ) ) 

Wait, 1/x² - 1/x₀² = (x₀² - x²) / (x² x₀²). So that's correct.

So dx/dt = sqrt( (k/m) * (x₀² - x²)/(x² x₀²) ) )

I can factor out 1/x₀² from the numerator and denominator:

sqrt( (k/m) * (x₀² - x²)/(x² x₀²) ) ) = sqrt( (k (x₀² - x²) )/(m x² x₀²) ) )

Which is sqrt( k (x₀² - x²) ) / (sqrt( m x² x₀² ) )

Simplify the denominator: sqrt( m ) * x * x₀.

So dx/dt = sqrt(k (x₀² - x²)) / ( sqrt(m) x x₀ )

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me write it as:

dx/dt = ( sqrt(k) / ( sqrt(m) x₀^{3/2} ) ) * sqrt( x₀² - x² )

Wait, but perhaps rearranging terms in a better way. Let's consider:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k/(m x₀^2)) ) * sqrt( (x₀² - x²) ) ) / x

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me factor the denominator in a different way.

Ah, perhaps we can separate variables. Let's rearrange the equation so we can integrate both sides.

So, we have:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k/m) * (1/x² - 1/x₀²) )

Which can be written as:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k/m) * ( (x₀² - x²) ) / (x² x₀²) ) )

So dx/dt = sqrt( (k (x₀² - x²) )/(m x² x₀²) ) )

Which simplifies to dx/dt = sqrt( k/(m x² x₀²) ) * sqrt( x₀² - x² )

But perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let's square both sides:

(dx/dt)^2 = (k/m) (1/x² - 1/x₀² )

Which can be rewritten as:

( dx/dt )^2 = (k/m) ( x₀² - x² ) / (x² x₀² )

Let me write this as:

( dx/dt )^2 = (k (x₀² - x²) ) / ( m x² x₀² )

I can separate variables by taking square roots on both sides:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k (x₀² - x²) )/(m x² x₀²) ) )

But perhaps a better approach is to make a substitution. Let me think about substituting variables to make this equation easier to integrate.

Let me set v = x, so dx/dt = v. Let me see if I can find a substitution that makes the equation easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let u = 1/x. Let me see. Let me try that substitution.

Let u = 1/x. Then, du/dt = - (1/x²) dx/dt.

So dx/dt = -x² du/dt.

Substituting into the equation:

( dx/dt )^2 = (k (x₀² - x²) )/( m x² x₀² )

Which becomes:

( x² du/dt )^2 = (k (x₀² - x²) )/( m x² x₀² )

Wait, that's (x^4 (du/dt)^2) = (k (x₀² - x^2 ) )/( m x² x₀^2 )

But x is 1/u, so x² = 1/u².

Wait, perhaps I should plug u =1/x into the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to make a substitution like u = x². Let me think.

Wait, let me re-express the equation:

( dx/dt )² = (k (x₀^2 - x^2 )) / ( m x^2 x₀^2 )

So, (dx/dt)^2 = (k (x₀^2 - x²))/(m x² x₀² )

Let me take the square root of both sides:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k (x₀^2 - x^2 )) / (m x² x₀^2) )

Which can be rewritten as:

dx/dt = (1/x) * sqrt( (k (x₀^2 - x^2 )) / ( m x₀^2 ) )

Wait, maybe I can factor out x₀^2 in the numerator and denominator under the square root:

sqrt( (k (x₀² - x²) ) / (m x² x₀^2) ) = sqrt( (k) (x₀² -x²) ) / ( x₀ ( sqrt(m) x ) )

Hmm, perhaps another substitution would make this easier. Let me think about using substitution for u = x / x₀. Let me try that.

Let u = x / x₀ → x = u x₀. Then, dx/dt = x₀ du/dt.

Substituting into the equation:

( dx/dt )^2 = (k (x₀^2 - x²)) / (m x² x₀^2 )

Which becomes:

(x₀^2 (du/dt)^2 ) = (k (x₀² - (u x₀)^2 )) / (m (u x₀)^2 x₀^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Left side: x₀² (du/dt)^2

Right side: k x₀² (1 - u²) / (m u² x₀^4 x₀^2 )

Wait, wait. Let me compute denominator:

( m x² x₀^2 ) = m (u x₀)^2 x₀^2 = m u² x₀^4.

So right side is (k (x₀² - x²) ) / ( m x² x₀^2 )

Which is (k (x₀² - u² x₀^2 )) / (m x² x₀^2 )

x² is u² x₀², so numerator is k x₀² (1 - u²). Denominator is m u² x₀^4.

So overall, right side is [k x₀² (1 -u²)] / [ m u² x₀^4 ] → [k (1 - u²)] / [ m u² x₀² ]

So putting it all together:

x₀² (du/dt)^2 = [k (1 - u²)] / [ m u² x₀² ]

Multiply both sides by x₀²:

x₀^4 (du/dt)^2 = [k (1 - u²)] / ( m u² )

Take square root of both sides:

x₀² du/dt = sqrt( k (1 - u²) ) / ( sqrt(m) u )

Wait, no. Because x₀^4 (du/dt)^2 is (x₀^2 * du/dt)^2, so the square root would give x₀^2 |du/dt|=sqrt( k (1 -u²) )/( sqrt(m) u )

But since the particle is moving from x = x₀ to x = 0 (since it's moving towards the origin, as the force is repelling, but wait, the force is k/x³, which for x positive, it's repelling. Wait, when the particle is moving away from origin? Wait, let me think.

No, wait, the force F = k/x³. If x is positive, and the force is repelling, then the particle would move away from the origin. Or if x is negative, the force would be negative, but the problem states x is the distance from origin, so x is positive.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the particle is initially at rest at x₀. Since the force is repelling, the particle should move away from the origin towards larger x.

Wait, but wait. If F is positive when x is positive, then the force is acting to push it away. So if the particle is at x₀, it would start moving towards larger x, away from the origin.

Wait, but there's a problem in the equation: when x > x₀, but wait, initially, x is x₀, so if F is positive, the acceleration is positive, so the velocity (dx/dt) is positive, meaning it's increasing x. So that makes sense.

But in the expression, I have (du/dt) = (1/(x₀²)) * sqrt( [k (1 - u²)] ) / ( sqrt(m) u )

Wait, perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

So, (x₀^2 du/dt) = [ sqrt(k (1 - u²)) ] / ( sqrt(m) u )

Wait, let me write it as:

x₀² du/dt = sqrt(k (1 - u²)) / ( sqrt(m) u )

But this seems a bit messy. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the substitution for the velocity. Let me think about the equation:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k (x₀² - x^2 )) / ( m x^2 x₀^2 ) )

Which can be written as:

dx/dt = sqrt( k (x₀² - x²) ) / ( x sqrt( m ) x₀ )

Alternatively, let me factor x₀²:

dx/dt = sqrt( k x₀² (1 - (x²/x₀²) ) ) / (x sqrt(m) x₀ )

= sqrt( k x₀² (1 - u²) ) / ( x sqrt(m) x₀ )

= x₀ sqrt( k (1 - u²) ) / ( x sqrt(m) x₀ )

The x₀ cancels:

= sqrt( k (1 - u²) ) / ( x sqrt(m) )

Which is sqrt(k/m) * sqrt( (1 - u^2) ) / x

But since u = x/x₀, x = u x₀. So sqrt( (1 - u²) ) / x = sqrt( (1 - u²) ) / (u x₀ )

So dx/dt = sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 - u²) / ( u x₀ )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better substitution is to let t = something else.

Wait, perhaps using substitution v = 1/x. Let me try that again.

Let v = 1/x → x = 1/v → dx/dt = - (1/v²) dv/dt.

Substituting into the equation:

( dx/dt )^2 = (k (x₀² - x²) )/( m x² x₀^2 )

Which becomes:

( ( -1/v² ) dv/dt )^2 = (k (x₀² - (1/v^2) )) / ( m (1/v^2) x₀^2 )

Simplify left side: (1/v^4) (dv/dt)^2

Right side: k (x₀² - 1/v^2) * v²/( m x₀^2 )

Because 1/v^2 is 1/x², and x² is 1/v². So:

Right side: k (x₀² - 1/v² ) * v²/( m x₀^2 )

= k [ x₀² v² - 1 ) ] / ( m x₀^2 )

So left side: (1/v^4) (dv/dt)^2 = k (x₀² v² - 1) / ( m x₀^2 )

Multiply both sides by v^4:

(dv/dt)^2 = [ k (x₀² v² -1 ) v^4 ] / ( m x₀^2 )

Taking the square root of both sides:

dv/dt = sqrt( [k (x₀² v² - 1)] v^4 ) / sqrt(m x₀^2 )

Hmm, this seems even more complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't the best approach.

Let me think about another substitution. Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

So,

(dx/dt)^2 = ( k (x₀² - x²) ) / ( m x² x₀^2 )

Which can be written as:

( dx/dt )^2 = k (x₀² - x²) / ( m x² x₀^2 )

Let me factor x₀² in the denominator:

= k (x₀² - x²) / ( m x² x₀^2 ) = k (x₀² - x²) / ( m x² x₀^2 ) ) = k (x₀² - x²) / ( m x^2 x₀^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can factor x^2 from the numerator and denominator:

The numerator is k (x₀² - x²) and denominator is m x² x₀².

Wait, perhaps I can write (x₀² - x²) as x₀² (1 - (x/x₀)^2 )

So substituting:

= k x₀² (1 - (x/x₀)^2 ) / ( m x² x₀^2 )

The x₀² cancels:

= k (1 - (x/x₀)^2 ) / ( m x² )

Hmm, that's:

= k (1 - u^2 ) / ( m x² )

But I'm not sure if this helps. Let me think of another approach: perhaps using a substitution for the equation in terms of velocity.

Wait, let's consider that the equation is (dx/dt)^2 = C (x₀² - x²) / x², where C is a constant. So the equation is:

(dx/dt)^2 = C (x₀² - x²) / x² = C (x₀²/x² - 1 )

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe a substitution t = something else.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution like s = 1/x, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I can use the substitution for v^2 = (x₀^2 - x^2 ) / (x^2 x₀^2 ), but that seems complex.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the equation in terms of velocity.

Wait, let me think about the expression in terms of velocity v = dx/dt. So the equation is (v)^2 = k (x₀^2 - x^2 )/( m x² x₀^2 )

Wait, but that can be written as:

v² = (k (x₀^2 - x^2 )) )/( m x² x₀^2 )

Which can be simplified as:

v² = (k (x₀^2 - x^2 )) )/( m x^2 x^2 )

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the equation again. Maybe I can make a substitution that will make the equation separable.

Let me think about the equation:

(v)^2 = (k (x₀^2 - x^2 )) )/( m x^2 x₀^2 )

Let me rearrange this equation to express v in terms of x.

But perhaps another approach is more straightforward. Let's consider the equation:

m dv/dt = k (x₀^2 - x^2 )

So, m dv/dt = k x₀² (1 - x²/x₀² )

Which is:

m dv/dt = k x₀² (1 - u² ), where u = x/x₀.

So,

dv/dt = (k x₀² (1 - u² )) / m

But since u = x/x₀, x = u x₀. So dx/dt = x₀ du/dt.

So, dv/dt = (k x₀² (1 - u² )) / m 

But dv/dt is the derivative of v with respect to time, which can be written in terms of du/dt.

Wait, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps writing everything in terms of u.

Wait, perhaps I can write dv/dt in terms of u and du/dt. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the equation as:

m dv/dt = k x₀² (1 - u² )

But since u is a function of x, which is a function of t, perhaps this substitution isn't helping.

Let me try a different approach. Since I'm solving this differential equation, perhaps I can integrate both sides. Let me write it as:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k (x₀^2 - x^2 )) / ( m x² x₀^2 ) )

Which can be written as:

dx/dt = sqrt( (k (x₀^2 - x^2 )) ) / ( sqrt( m) x sqrt(x₀^2) )

Wait, perhaps I can factor sqrt( x₀^2 ) from the denominator, which is x₀.

So, denominator is sqrt( m ) x x₀, and numerator is sqrt( k (x₀² - x^2 ) ).

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

dx/dt = sqrt( k (x₀² - x^2) ) / ( sqrt( m ) x x₀ )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

dx/dt = sqrt( k / (m x₀^2) ) * sqrt( (x₀^2 - x^2 ) ) ) / x

But since x is a variable, perhaps another substitution is needed.

Wait, perhaps I can let t = something else. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I can let t be a function of x, so that I can write the equation in terms of t.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a substitution like v = x, and proceed to integrate.

Wait, perhaps I can use a substitution for the equation:

(x₀² - x²) dx = (k/(m x)) sqrt(x₀²) dt

Wait, perhaps integrating both sides.

Let me write the equation again:

m dv/dt = k (x₀^2 -v^2 ) / v^2

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me take a step back.

I think I need to use a substitution where I let u = x / x₀, so that x = u x₀, and dx/du = x₀.

Then, the equation for velocity becomes:

dx/dt = x₀ du/dt.

Substituting into the equation:

x₀ du/dt = sqrt( (k (x₀^2 - (u x₀)^2 )) / ( m (u x₀)^2 x₀^2 ) ) )

Simplify the expression under the square root:

(k (x₀^2 - u^2 x₀^2 )) / ( m u^2 x₀^2 x₀^2 ) )

= [ k x₀^2 (1 - u^2) ] / [ m u^2 x₀^4 ]

= [ k (1 - u^2) ] / [ m u^2 x₀^2 ]

So, the square root becomes sqrt( k (1 - u^2) ) / ( sqrt( m ) u x₀ )

So, the equation becomes:

x₀ du/dt = sqrt( k (1 - u^2) ) / ( sqrt( m ) u x₀ )

Multiply both sides by x₀:

x₀^2 du/dt = sqrt( k (1 - u^2) ) / ( sqrt( m ) u )

Now, let's write this as:

du/dt = sqrt( k (1 - u^2) ) / ( x₀^2 sqrt( m ) u )

Which is:

du/dt = sqrt( k ) sqrt(1 - u^2) / ( x₀^2 sqrt(m) u )

Hmm, perhaps I can separate variables. Let me write this as:

sqrt(1 - u^2) / u du = sqrt( k ) / ( x₀^2 sqrt( m ) ) dt

Wait, that's a good step. Let me write:

sqrt(1 - u^2) / u du = C dt

Where C is the constant sqrt(k) / (x₀^2 sqrt(m))

Wait, that's right. So, integrating both sides:

∫ [ sqrt(1 - u^2 ) / u ] du = ∫ C dt

The right side is simple: ∫ C dt = C t + D.

The left side is the integral of sqrt(1 - u^2 ) / u du. Let's compute this integral.

Let me make a substitution for this integral. Let me set u = sinθ, so that sqrt(1 - u^2) = cosθ, and du = cosθ dθ.

Substituting into the integral:

∫ [ sqrt(1 - u^2 ) / u ] du = ∫ [ cosθ / sinθ ] * cosθ dθ 

= ∫ ( cos^2 θ / sinθ ) dθ 

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think if I can find another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can substitute t = something else. Let me think, perhaps let s = something.

Wait, maybe it's better to let s = 1/u. Then, u = 1/s, du = -1/s² ds.

Substituting into the integral:

∫ [ sqrt(1 - u^2 ) / u ] du = ∫ [ sqrt(1 - (1/s)^2 ) / (1/s) ] * (-1/s²) ds 

Simplify the terms:

sqrt(1 - (1/s^2 )) = sqrt( (s^2 -1)/s^2 ) = sqrt(s^2 -1)/s.

So, the integral becomes:

∫ [ ( sqrt(s^2 - 1) / s ) / (1/s) ) ] * (-1/s²) ds 

Simplify numerator:

( sqrt(s^2 -1)/s ) / (1/s) = sqrt(s^2 -1)/s * s/1 = sqrt(s^2 -1)

So, the integral is:

∫ sqrt(s^2 -1 ) * (-1/s²) ds 

Hmm, that might be manageable. Let me think about integrating sqrt(s^2 -1) / s².

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me set y = s. Then, maybe I can use a substitution for y.

Wait, perhaps a substitution where I set y = s - something. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I can let y = s, and then I can use integration by parts. Let me try that.

Let me set for integration by parts, let u be (something) and dv be (something else).

Alternatively, perhaps I can let y = s^2 -1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can let y = s^2 -1, so that s^2 = y +1, and 2s ds = dy.

Wait, but in the integral, I have sqrt(s^2 -1) which is sqrt(y), and I'm dividing by s^2.

Hmm, perhaps this substitution is getting too complicated. Let me think of another method.

Wait, perhaps I can perform a substitution for the integral of sqrt(s^2 -1) / s².

Let me set z = sqrt(s^2 -1). Then, dz/ds = (1/2) (2s) / sqrt(s^2 -1) ) = s / sqrt(s^2 -1).

Hmm, that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set z = s + something.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the integral in terms of substitution for sqrt(s^2 -1).

Let me set t = s, so that the integral is ∫ sqrt(t^2 -1) / t^2 dt.

Hmm, perhaps that can be rewritten as ∫ sqrt(t^2 -1) * t^{-2} dt.

Wait, perhaps another substitution. Let me set u = sqrt(t^2 -1). Then, u^2 = t^2 -1 → t^2 = u^2 +1.

Differentiating both sides: 2t dt = 2u du → t dt = u du.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this substitution helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make the substitution t = something else. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can split the fraction: sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 = (sqrt(s^2 -1)/s) * (1/s).

Hmm, that's the same as I had before.

Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution for the term inside the square root. Let me set u = s, and then proceed.

Wait, I'm stuck here. Let me think about the integral of sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 ds.

Let me consider integrating this by substitution.

Let me set w = s. Then, perhaps let me set w = something else.

Wait, perhaps integrating by substitution with w = s^2 -1.

Wait, perhaps I can write s^2 -1 = (s -1)(s +1). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make substitution for the square root.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the integral as ∫ sqrt(s^2 -1) * (1/s^2) ds.

Let me set u = sqrt(s^2 -1), so that u^2 = s^2 -1 → s^2 = u^2 +1. Then, 2s ds = 2u du → s ds = u du.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this substitution helps with the integral.

Wait, perhaps let me think of the integral as ∫ u / (u^2 +1) * (1/s^2) ds.

Wait, but s in terms of u is s = sqrt(u^2 +1). Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the integral in terms of substitution for the denominator.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for the entire integral.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the integral of sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 as ∫ sqrt(s^2 -1) * s^{-2} ds.

Let me see, perhaps I can write this as ∫ sqrt(s^2 -1) * (1/s^2) ds.

Let me substitute t = s^2 -1, so that dt = 2s ds.

Hmm, but I have an s^{-2} term, which is 1/s².

Wait, perhaps I can write the integral as ∫ sqrt(t) * (1/(t +1)) * (dt)/(2s) )

Wait, that might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps this substitution is not working. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution for the integral of sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2.

Let me think of this as ∫ sqrt(s^2 -1) * (1/s^2) ds.

Let me think of substitution for the entire integrand.

Wait, perhaps let me set u = sqrt(s^2 -1). Then, u² = s² -1 → s² = u² +1.

Differentiating both sides: 2s ds = 2u du → s ds = u du.

Hmm, but I have 1/s² in the integrand, which is 1/(u² +1).

Hmm, perhaps this substitution is not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the integral as:

∫ [u / (u² +1)] * (1/s²) ds 

But s is sqrt(u² +1), so 1/s² = 1/(u² +1).

Hmm, so the integral becomes:

∫ [u / (u² +1)] * [1/(u² +1)] ds 

Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as:

∫ u * [1/(u² +1)^2] * ds 

Hmm, but s is sqrt(u² +1), which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps this substitution is not leading me anywhere. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can think about using a substitution for the entire integral.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the integral as:

∫ sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 ds 

Let me set t = s^2, so that dt = 2s ds → s ds = dt/2.

But in the integral, I have s^2 in the denominator. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express the integral in terms of t = s^2.

Then, s = sqrt(t), ds = (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt.

Hmm, substituting into the integral:

∫ sqrt(t^2 -1) / t^2 * (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt

= 1/2 ∫ sqrt(t^2 -1) / (t^3) dt

Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the integral as ∫ sqrt(t^2 -1) / t^2 dt.

Hmm, perhaps I can use substitution for the square root.

Wait, perhaps I can let u = t^2 -1, so that du = 2t dt.

But in the integral, I have sqrt(u) in the numerator, and t^2 in the denominator.

Hmm, perhaps this substitution is not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider integrating the function by parts.

Let me consider ∫ sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 ds.

Let me set u = sqrt(s^2 -1), dv = 1/s^2 ds.

Then, du = [s / sqrt(s^2 -1)] ds, and v = -1/s.

So, integration by parts gives:

u v - ∫ v du 

= sqrt(s^2 -1) (-1/s) - ∫ (-1/s) [s / sqrt(s^2 -1) ] ds 

= - sqrt(s^2 -1) / s + ∫ [1/s] [s / sqrt(s^2 -1) ] ds 

= - sqrt(s^2 -1) / s + ∫ 1 / sqrt(s^2 -1) ds 

Now, the remaining integral is ∫ 1/ sqrt(s^2 -1) ds, which is a standard integral.

The integral of 1/sqrt(x^2 -a^2) dx is ln |x + sqrt(x^2 -a^2)| | + C.

So, ∫ 1/sqrt(s^2 -1) ds = ln |s + sqrt(s^2 -1)| | + C.

So, putting it all together, the integral becomes:

- sqrt(s^2 -1)/s + ln |s + sqrt(s^2 -1)| + C

So, the integral of sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 ds is:

- sqrt(s^2 -1)/s + ln(s + sqrt(s^2 -1)) + C

Now, going back to the substitution where s = sqrt(t^2 -1), but in our case, s = u = something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing substitutions here. Let me recap.

We have the integral:

∫ sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 ds 

Which we've evaluated to:

- sqrt(s^2 -1)/s + ln(s + sqrt(s^2 -1)) + C

So, putting it all together, the integral is:

- sqrt(s^2 -1)/s + ln(s + sqrt(s^2 -1)) + C

Now, going back to the substitution where s = sqrt(t^2 -1), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I can substitute s = u, and the rest is a matter of evaluating the expression.

Wait, perhaps the integral is:

- sqrt(u^2 -1)/u + ln(u + sqrt(u^2 -1)) + C

So, now, the integral of sqrt(u^2 -1)/u^2 du is:

- sqrt(u^2 -1)/u + ln(u + sqrt(u^2 -1)) + C

So, going back to the substitution for the original integral.

We have:

∫ sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 ds = - sqrt(s^2 -1)/s + ln(s + sqrt(s^2 -1)) + C

So, now, going back to the substitution where s was defined earlier.

Wait, perhaps the substitution I used earlier was s = u, but I think I might have confused variables.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the substitution as s = v, but perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the substitution in terms of the variable that I'm solving for.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the substitution as s = v, and so on.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too confusing, and I should try to think differently.

Hmm, perhaps I can think of the integral in terms of substitution for the original integral.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the integral ∫ sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 ds as ∫ sqrt(s^2 -1)/s^2 ds.

Wait, perhaps I can make substitution for the entire expression.

Wait, perhaps I can think of substitution for the entire integral, but I'm not sure.
