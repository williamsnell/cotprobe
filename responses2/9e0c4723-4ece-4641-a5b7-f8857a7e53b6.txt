Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to find the smallest sample size n where the null hypothesis H0: ρ=0 is rejected against H1: ρ≠0, given that the sample correlation coefficient r is 0.68 and the significance level α is 0.05. Hmm, right. I remember that this involves hypothesis testing for correlation coefficients.

Wait, the test for correlation is probably using a t-test, right? Because the test statistic for the correlation coefficient is t = r * sqrt((n-2)/(1 - r²)). Oh wait, no, I think the formula is t = r * sqrt((n-2)/(1 - r²)). Or maybe it's t = r * sqrt((n-1)/(1 - r²)) )? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Right, when testing the null hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient is zero, the test statistic is t = r * sqrt((n-2)/(1 - r²)). But I've also heard it written as t = r * sqrt((n-1)/(1 - r²)). Wait, no, perhaps it's different based on the estimator. Oh wait, no, I think the correct formula is t = r * sqrt( (n-2)/(1 - r²) ). So that's the t statistic.

So the steps are: calculate the t-statistic, compare it to the critical value from the t-distribution table, and decide whether to reject H0.

But wait, the problem says to find the smallest n such that H0 is rejected at α=0.05. So perhaps I need to find the critical t-value at α=0.05 for a two-tailed test, then set up the inequality t > t_critical or t < -t_critical and solve for n.

Wait, but the critical value depends on the sample size, right? Because the degrees of freedom (df) for the t-test is n-2. So the critical t-value will vary with n. So I'll need to solve for n such that when using the critical t-value from the table for df = n-2, the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the equation where the calculated t is just barely above the critical value, and solve for n.

So let's outline the steps:

1. The null hypothesis is that ρ=0, so the test is whether r is significantly different from zero.

The test statistic is t = r * sqrt( (n-2)/(1 - r²) )

But wait, another version I've seen is t = r * sqrt( (n-1)/(1 - r²) ). Are these two the same? Let me think. Oh, wait, the denominator might vary between n-2 and n-1. Wait, let's double-check.

In the case of the Pearson correlation test, the test statistic is t = r * sqrt( (n-2)/(1 - r²) ). So yes, that's correct. So the df is n-2, and the critical value is based on that.

But let me make sure. Another source says that the test statistic is t = r * sqrt( (n-2)/(1 - r²) ). Yes, that's correct.

So, given that, if r = 0.68, and we're testing whether it's significantly different from zero, then:

t = 0.68 * sqrt( (n-2) / (1 - 0.68²) )

Compute 1 - 0.68². 0.68 squared is 0.4624. So 1 - 0.4624 is 0.5376.

So t = 0.68 * sqrt( (n-2) / 0.5376 )

Wait, but the critical t-value depends on the df (which is n-2) and the two-tailed test at α=0.05.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the t statistic, find the critical value, and see for which n this t is just above the critical value. But since n is involved in both the numerator and denominator, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps it's best to set up the inequality and solve for n.

The critical t-value for a two-tailed test with df = n-2 is t_critical = t_{α/2, df}.

We want the t-statistic to be greater than t_critical, so:

0.68 * sqrt( (n-2) / 0.5376 ) > t_{0.025, n-2}

But solving for n here is tricky because t_{0.025, n-2} depends on n, and n is on both sides. Hmm, perhaps we can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that for large n, the t distribution approximates the normal distribution, but that's probably not the case here because n is likely to be small.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the critical t-value from the inverse of the t-distribution, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation to solve for n. Let's see:

t = 0.68 * sqrt( (n-2) / 0.5376 )

We can square both sides to eliminate the square root:

t² = (0.68²) * (n-2) / 0.5376

Then, solve for (n-2):

n-2 = (t² * 0.5376) / 0.68²

But the problem is t itself depends on n. Because t is based on the critical t-value for df = n-2.

Wait, that complicates things. Because t is a function of n, which is part of the equation. So perhaps we can't solve this algebraically easily. Maybe we need to make an iterative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a trial and error approach. Let me think: what's the minimal n so that when we compute the t-statistic at the critical value, the t-statistic exceeds the critical value.

Wait, but without knowing n, it's hard. So perhaps we can plug in the options for n and see which is the smallest n where the t-statistic is larger than the critical t-value.

Wait, the options are: 9,7,10,11,12,13,15,20,5,8.

Wait, let me list the options:

A:9, B:7, C:10, D:11, E:12, F:13, G:5, H:8, I:12, J:15.

Wait, the problem asks for the smallest n so that H0 is rejected. So we need to find the minimal n where the t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value at α=0.05, two-tailed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the critical t-value at the given significance level, and then solve for n.

Wait, the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with α=0.05 is t_{0.025, df}, where df = n-2.

But since n is part of df, we can't really compute it without knowing n. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that for a given n, compute the t-statistic and see if it exceeds the critical t-value.

Wait, but without knowing n, it's a bit tricky. Maybe we can find an approximate formula or use a table.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inverse of the t-distribution. For example, for a 95% confidence level, the critical t-value is the value such that P(T > t) = 0.025, where T is a t-distributed variable with df = n-2.

Wait, but without knowing n, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that as n increases, the critical t-value decreases. So a smaller t-statistic would require a larger n to be significant.

Wait, so maybe we can use the formula for the critical t-value at 0.05 significance level and solve for n, but that's not straightforward because the t-value depends on n.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the critical value in terms of the sample size. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the test statistic and set it equal to the critical value and solve for n.

Wait, but the critical value depends on the degrees of freedom, which is n-2. So perhaps I can use an approximation.

Wait, another approach: since the test statistic t is proportional to sqrt(n), perhaps I can estimate n such that t equals the critical t-value.

Wait, but without knowing n, it's difficult. So perhaps it's better to compute for each of the options the t-statistic and compare it to the critical t-value. Since the options are given, perhaps it's feasible.

Let me try that approach.

First, let's list the possible n's and compute t and the critical t for each.

n | df = n-2 | r | t_stat | critical t at 0.025 (two-tailed)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Let's start with n=5 (G is 5):

n=5: df=3.

t_stat = 0.68 * sqrt( (5-2)/0.5376 ) = 0.68 * sqrt(3 / 0.5376)
Compute 3 / 0.5376 ≈ 5.591. sqrt(5.591) ≈ 2.364. So t_stat ≈ 0.68 * 2.364 ≈ 1.600.

Critical t for two-tailed at 0.05, df=3: t_c ≈ 3.182 (since t_{0.025, 3} ≈ 3.182).

So t_stat (1.60) < t_c (3.182). So for n=5, t_stat < t_c, so H0 is not rejected.

n=7 (H=7):

df=5.

t_stat = 0.68 * sqrt(5/0.5376) = 0.68 * sqrt(5 / 0.5376)

5 / 0.5376 ≈ 9.294. sqrt(9.294) ≈ 3.048.

So t_stat ≈ 0.68 * 3.048 ≈ 2.078.

Critical t for df=5, two-tailed: t_c ≈ 2.571.

So t_stat (2.078) < t_c (2.571). Not enough to reject H0.

n=8 (H=8):

df=6.

t_stat = 0.68 * sqrt(6 / 0.5376) = 0.68 * sqrt(6 / 0.5376).

6 / 0.5376 ≈ 11.176. sqrt(11.176) ≈ 3.343.

t_stat ≈ 0.68 * 3.343 ≈ 2.276.

Critical t for df=6: t_c ≈ 2.447 (since t_{0.025,6}=2.447).

So 2.276 < 2.447 → Not enough to reject.

n=9 (A:9):

df=7.

t_stat = 0.68 * sqrt(7 / 0.5376) = 0.68 * sqrt(7 / 0.5376).

7 / 0.5376 ≈ 13.02. sqrt(13.02) ≈ 3.608.

t_stat ≈ 0.68 * 3.608 ≈ 2.453.

Critical t for df=7: t_c ≈ 2.365.

2.453 > 2.365 → So t_stat > t_c. Therefore, H0 is rejected.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Because when n=9, the df is 7, t_c is about 2.365. So the t_stat is 2.453, which is higher than 2.365. So we can reject H0.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because 0.68 is a pretty high correlation, so perhaps a small n is sufficient.

Wait, let me check n=10 (C:10):

df=8.

t_stat = 0.68 * sqrt(8 / 0.5376) = 0.68 * sqrt(8 / 0.5376).

8 / 0.5376 ≈ 14.912. sqrt(14.912) ≈ 3.862.

t_stat ≈ 0.68 * 3.862 ≈ 2.631.

Critical t for df=8: t_c ≈ 2.306.

2.631 > 2.306 → Reject H0.

Wait, but the options are the minimal n. So n=9 gives t_stat=2.453 and t_c=2.365, so t_stat exceeds. So n=9 would allow us to reject H0.

But wait, the answer options include n=9 as option A. But wait, let me see the options again.

The options are:

A:9, B:7, C:10, D:11, E:12, F:13, G:5, H:8, I:12, J:15.

So the first option where t_stat exceeds the critical t is n=9. So the minimal n is 9, which is option A.

But wait, let me make sure. Because when n=9, the degrees of freedom is 7, and the critical t is 2.365. The t_stat is 2.453, which is just barely above. So that's sufficient to reject H0.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because another approach: perhaps I should compute the critical t-value for each n and see at what point the t_stat exceeds it. Or perhaps I can use a more precise method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the critical t-value for each n and see:

Wait, n=9: df=7, critical t is 2.365. The computed t is 2.453 which is larger, so H0 is rejected.

n=8: df=6, critical t=2.447. t_stat=2.276 < 2.447 → not enough.

So the minimal n is 9, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: maybe the sample correlation coefficient is 0.68, which is quite high. So perhaps a smaller n is sufficient. So n=9 is the minimal.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the sample size is 9, and the correlation is 0.68. Hmm.

Wait, but let me think in terms of the formula again. The t-statistic is 0.68 * sqrt( (n-2)/(1 - r²) ). Let's compute this for n=9:

sqrt(7/0.5376) = sqrt(13.02) ≈ 3.608.

Multiply by 0.68: 2.453.

Critical t at 0.05, df=7: t_c=2.365.

So 2.453 > 2.365 → Reject H0.

At n=8: sqrt(6/0.5376)=sqrt(11.176)=3.343. 0.68 * 3.343≈2.276. t_c at df=6 is 2.447. 2.276 < 2.447 → not enough.

So n=9 is the minimal n where H0 is rejected.

Wait, but the options have A:9, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the options don't have 8. Wait no, H is 8. So n=9 is the minimal n.

So the answer would be option A:9.

To determine the smallest sample size \( n \) required to reject \( H_0: \rho = 0 \) against \( H_1: \rho \neq 0 \) at a significance level of \( \alpha = 0.05 \) with a sample correlation coefficient \( r = 0.68 \), we use the test statistic for correlation:

\[
t = r \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1 - r^2}}
\]
