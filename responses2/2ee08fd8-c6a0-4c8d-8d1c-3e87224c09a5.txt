Okay, so Marshall needs to finish his English paper before his class starts. He has 550 words left, and the class starts in 25 minutes. The question is asking what's the minimum typing speed he needs to achieve to finish on time. The options are from A to J, each with different word speeds.

Hmm, I think I should calculate the required typing speed. Speed is words per minute, so I need to divide the total words by the time available. Let me do that. 550 words divided by 25 minutes. Let me compute that.

550 / 25. Well, 25 times 20 is 500, so that leaves 50 more words. So 20 plus (50/25) which is 2. So 22 words per minute. Wait, but I should double-check. 22 times 25 is 550. Yes, that's right. So the minimum speed is 22 words per minute.

Looking at the options, option C is 22. So the answer should be C.

Marshall needs to type 550 words in 25 minutes. To find the minimum speed required, divide the total words by time:

550 words รท 25 minutes = 22 words per minute.

The correct answer is **C: 22 words per minute**.

Answer: C
