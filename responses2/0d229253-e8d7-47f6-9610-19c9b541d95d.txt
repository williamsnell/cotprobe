Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an airplane dropping a payload. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says the plane is going due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s. So, the plane isn't accelerating northward; it's moving at a steady pace. Now, the payload is being dropped while it's in the air, and air resistance is neglected. I need to find the velocity of the payload relative to the plane after 4.0 seconds.

Hmm, relative velocity. Right, so when you're in a moving frame of reference, the velocity of an object relative to you is the object's velocity minus your velocity. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh, wait, no. If I'm in the plane, then the payload's velocity relative to me is its velocity minus the plane's velocity. Because I'm moving north at 100 m/s, and the payload is moving north as well. So, when I see the payload, it's moving slower than the plane.

Wait, let me think again. The payload is released while the plane is moving north. So, if the payload is dropped, it's just starting to fall. When you release it, the payload will initially have the same horizontal velocity as the plane, which is 100 m/s north. But gravity will make it accelerate downward. So, its vertical velocity will be increasing.

Wait, but the question is about the velocity of the payload relative to the plane. So, from the plane's perspective, the payload is moving. Since the plane is moving at 100 m/s north, and the payload has a horizontal component of velocity (because it's moving forward with the plane and then starts to fall). So, the payload's horizontal velocity relative to the plane is zero initially, but since the plane is moving, the payload's velocity relative to the plane is negative, i.e., moving southward. But wait, no. Because the plane is moving north, the payload's velocity relative to the plane is its velocity minus the plane's velocity.

Wait, let me clarify.

Let me denote the plane's velocity as V_p, and the payload's velocity as V_p + V. Wait, actually, no. The payload's velocity relative to the ground is V_p (north) plus the acceleration due to gravity (downward). So, V_p_ground = 100 m/s north + 0 m/s (since it's just dropped, no horizontal velocity when released). Then, as it falls, it gains vertical velocity. So, the payload's velocity relative to the ground is (100 m/s north, some downward velocity).

But the problem is about the velocity of the payload relative to the plane. So, from the plane's perspective, the payload's velocity is (payload's velocity relative to ground) minus (plane's velocity relative to ground). Wait, no. The relative velocity is V_p payload - V_p plane? Or V_p plane - V_p payload? Let me think about reference frames. If the plane is moving at 100 m/s north, and the payload is moving at 100 m/s north as well when released, then from the plane, the payload is stationary. But that's not correct because the payload is also accelerating downward. So, when I'm in the plane, the payload is moving backward (south) because the plane is moving north. Because the payload's horizontal velocity relative to the ground is 100 m/s north, but the plane is moving at 100 m/s north. So, relative to the plane, their horizontal speeds cancel out. So, their horizontal velocity relative to plane is zero. But since the payload is accelerating downward, the vertical component of its velocity relative to the plane will be the same as its velocity relative to the ground.

Wait, wait. Let's model this. Let's take the coordinate system where positive y is upward and positive x is east, but wait, our plane is moving north. So, in the problem, north is positive x and east is positive y, perhaps. But the problem says, the payload is dropped while traveling due north, so the direction of the plane's velocity is along the x-axis.

So, when the payload is released, its velocity is (100 m/s in x, 0 m/s in y). Then, as it's in free fall, it gains a vertical component. The x-component remains 100 m/s because there's no air resistance. The y-component increases due to gravity.

Wait, but the question is about the velocity relative to the plane. So, the payload's velocity relative to the plane is (payload's velocity in ground frame) minus (plane's velocity in ground frame). So, V_p_plane is 100 m/s north. So, V_p_plane = (100, 0) m/s.

The payload's velocity in ground frame, V_p, is (100, -gt) m/s, because it's moving north (x) and down (y). At t=4s, it's (100, -4*9.8) = (100, -39.2) m/s.

So, the relative velocity of payload with respect to plane is V_p âˆ’ V_p_plane. So, subtracting (100, 0) from (100, -39.2) gives (0, -39.2) m/s. So, the payload is moving south relative to the plane with a speed of 39.2 m/s. So, in the options, it's 40 m/s down, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 40 m/s down. But wait, the answer I got is 39.2 m/s down, which is approximately 40 m/s. So, option G is the correct answer.

Wait, the options are in the problem. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 80 m/s down

B: 80 m/s north and 40 m/s down

C: 200 m/s north and 80 m/s down

D: 100 m/s down

E: 100 m/s north

F: 0

G: 40 m/s down

H: 40 m/s north

I: 160 m/s down

J: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down

So, according to my calculation, the velocity is 40 m/s downward. So option G is correct.

But wait, another thought. What about the plane's velocity? Oh, no, because the payload is released at the same time as the plane, so when it's released, the payload's velocity relative to the plane is zero. But as it falls, its vertical velocity is downward, so the relative velocity becomes that. So, the payload is moving south at 40 m/s after 4 seconds. Hence, option G.

The problem involves an airplane traveling due north at 100 m/s, with a payload being dropped while in the air. Air resistance is neglected, so the payload's motion is determined by gravity. The question asks for the velocity of the payload relative to the plane after 4.0 seconds.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Plane's Velocity**: The plane is moving due north at 100 m/s, so its velocity is constant at (100, 0) m/s in the frame of reference where north is positive \(x\) and downward is positive \(y\).

2. **Payload's Velocity**: The payload is initially in free fall, so its horizontal velocity relative to the ground is 100 m/s north, and its vertical velocity increases due to gravity. After 4.0 seconds, the payload's vertical velocity is:
   \[
   v_y = -gt = -9.8 \, \text{m/s} \times 4.0 \, \text{s} = -39.2 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]
   Thus, the payload's velocity relative to the ground is (100, -39.2) m/s.

3. **Relative Velocity**: The payload's velocity relative to the plane is calculated by subtracting the plane's velocity from the payload's velocity:
   \[
   \vec{v}_{\text{payload, relative to plane}} = \vec{v}_{\text{payload}} - \vec{v}_{\text{plane}} = (100, -39.2) - (100, 0) = (0, -39.2) \, \text{m/s}.
   \]
   This means the payload moves southward relative to the plane at a velocity of 39.2 m/s, which is approximately 40 m/s.

4. **Answer Selection**: Among the options, the velocity of 40 m/s south corresponds to option **G**.
