Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the stresses in a saw as it goes over a driving pulley. Let me go through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on mechanical engineering, but let's see.

The problem states that the saw is made of alloy steel, with a Young's modulus E of 30 × 10^6 psi. The thickness of the saw is 1/32 inches. The pulley has a diameter of 15 inches. I need to compute the stresses.

Wait, when a saw goes over a pulley, it's probably cutting along the length of the pulley. So, the saw is probably in contact with the pulley, and the stress here would be from the tension in the saw. I'm thinking this relates to the bending stress in a beam or something similar.

Oh right, the formula for the maximum stress in a simply supported beam under a uniformly distributed load is σ_max = (M*c)/σ, but wait, that's for bending. But wait, in this case, the saw is probably in tension. So perhaps it's like a tension in a rod, leading to bending stress.

Wait, another approach: If the saw is pressing against the pulley, it's like a beam (or a plate) bending under load. So the stress would be due to the tension in the saw. The formula for bending stress when a beam is loaded symmetrically is σ = (3F*L)/(8A), but wait, no, I think that's for a square beam under concentrated load at mid span. Alternatively, maybe it's a simply supported beam with a point load at the center, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the stress is due to torsion. Wait, but if the saw is just pressing against the pulley, maybe it's a shear stress issue. Wait, but the problem says "compute the stresses," which could be bending or torsion.

Wait, another possibility: The saw is going over the pulley, so maybe the saw is in contact with the pulley's surface. The pulley's radius is half the diameter, so 15/2 = 7.5 inches. The thickness is 1/32 inches.

Wait, another thought: If the saw is acting as a flat punch, the stress might be due to the force applied. If the saw's length is longer than the pulley's radius, then the stress in the saw would be the force divided by the width. Wait, but perhaps it's bending stress.

Alternatively, perhaps the saw is pressing against the pulley, creating a contact area, and the stress is due to the tension in the saw. Let me think about the forces involved.

Wait, maybe it's a simply supported beam where the load is the tension in the saw. So, if the pulley is a simple support, the tension T would create a bending moment, leading to a maximum stress at the center.

The formula for the maximum bending stress in a simply supported beam with a central point load is σ_max = (M*c)/σ, but wait, no, more accurately, for a beam with a point load at the center, the maximum stress is σ = (6*M)/(b*c^2), where M is the bending moment, b is the beam width, and c is the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fiber (which is half the height, c = t/2, where t is the thickness).

But wait, in this case, the beam isn't a solid beam but perhaps a plate or rod. So, perhaps the saw is a flat bar with some length over the pulley, acting as a beam. The stress would come from the tension in the saw and the contact area.

Alternatively, the stress could be due to torsion. Torsion in a circular shaft is given by τ = (T*c)/J, where T is the torque, c is the radius, and J is the polar moment of inertia.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Another approach: when a material is pressed against a pulley, the stress can be calculated based on the area of contact and the force applied. But I'm not sure what the force is; perhaps the driving force is the tension in the saw.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The saw is a flat object in contact with the pulley. So the stress in the saw would be due to the force of tension applied over the contact area. The maximum stress would occur at the center.

But if the saw is a flat plate, the stress would be from the tension in the saw. So, let's say F is the force in the saw, acting over a contact length. Wait, but the pulley's diameter is 15 inches, so the radius is 7.5 inches. If the saw is in contact over the entire diameter, then the contact area would be the length of the saw times the pulley's circumference. Hmm, but that's perhaps beyond what's needed.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of shear stress. If the saw is in contact with the pulley, the shear stress would be the force (F) applied over the area (A) of contact, which is the width of the saw times the length of contact. But without knowing the length of the saw, perhaps the stress is calculated based on the contact length.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the stress in the driving pulley. The pulley's material is alloy steel, so maybe it's being pressed against by the saw. The driving pulley's stress would depend on the tension in the saw.

Wait, perhaps the stress is due to the tension in the saw, which is a shearing force. If the saw's length is longer than the radius, then the contact is over the entire length, which would cause a shear stress. But if the pulley is a circular shape and the saw is a flat bar, maybe the stress is due to torsion.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again. The options are all around 12k to 75k psi. The answer options are A to J, with the choices.

Wait, another approach: The saw is in contact with the pulley. So the stress could be due to the tension in the saw, which would cause a bending moment. The formula for bending stress in a simply supported beam is σ = (3F*L) / (8A), where F is the force, L is the length, A is the width. But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the stress is calculated as the force (Tension) divided by the thickness. Like, T / t, but that gives a very high value, but the options don't have that. For example, if T is 15,000 psi times 1/32", but that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, perhaps the stress comes from the shear. The shear stress formula is τ = F / A, where A is the area over which the force is applied. The area would be the width of the saw times the length over which it's applied. But without knowing the width or the length, perhaps it's the area of the pulley's contact.

Wait, maybe the pulley's radius is 7.5 inches, and the thickness of the saw is 1/32". The area of contact is the length of the saw multiplied by the thickness. But the length of the saw is the same as the pulley's circumference, which is 2πr = 2π*(7.5) inches. So the area A is 2π*7.5 * (1/32) inches².

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the stress is due to the tension in the saw. If the pulley is a circle, and the saw is a flat bar of length L over the pulley's radius, then the stress is from the tension T in the saw. The stress in the saw would be T divided by the width of the saw (since stress is force per unit area, and the area is width times length). But again, without knowing the width, perhaps the assumption is that the width is 1 inch, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the stress is the tension divided by the thickness. Like, T = 15,000 psi * 1/32". But that would be 15,000 /32 = around 468 psi, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the stress could be from the torque. If the saw is in contact with the pulley, and the driving pulley is probably being used to transmit power, then the torque would cause torsion. The formula for torsion stress is τ = (T*c)/J, where T is torque, c is the radius, J is the polar moment of inertia of the shaft. But again, I don't know the torque applied.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum stress is due to the tension in the saw, which is a shearing force applied over the contact area. The formula for shearing stress in a bar is τ = F / A, where A is the area over which the force is applied. If the saw has a certain width (say, w), then A = w * t, where t is the thickness (1/32"). So τ = F / (w * t). But without knowing F or w, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the saw as a flat bar, and the stress is due to the tension in the saw. The stress in the saw would be the tension divided by the area (width * thickness). But without the width, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the saw is in contact with the pulley, and the stress is calculated as (T) / (thickness * length), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let me consider the basic formula for bending stress in a simply supported beam. The maximum bending stress is σ_max = (3 F L) / (8 A), where A is the width of the beam. But in this case, the beam would be the width of the saw, which is perhaps the length. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another angle: the problem could be a case where the force applied is the tension in the saw, and the stress is calculated as the force divided by the thickness. But that would result in a high value, perhaps around 30,000 psi. Let's think about it.

If the pulley is a circle with radius 7.5 inches, and the saw is in contact over a length of 2πr (the entire circumference) and has a thickness of 1/32", then the contact area might be 2πr * (1/32). The stress due to tension would be the tension divided by the contact area.

But wait, tension is force, so if T is the force, the stress would be T / (2πr * (1/32)) ). But without knowing T, this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of shear stress in a beam, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the options. The options are 12,000 to 75,000 psi. The modulus E is 30e6 psi. If the stress is σ = E * ε, but without knowing strain, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the stress is calculated as the force applied divided by the thickness. If the driving pulley's diameter is 15 inches, and the thickness is 1/32", then the area over which the stress is applied is the width of the saw times the thickness. But the saw's width isn't given, so perhaps the stress is T / (width * thickness), but without T or width, this is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the saw is acting as a flat bar in contact with the pulley, and the stress is calculated as the applied force divided by the width times thickness. If the saw is a rectangle, say, 1 inch wide and 1/32" thick, then the area would be (1 in) * (1/32 in) ) = 1/32 in². If the force applied is, say, 15,000 psi * 1/32 in², but that's in terms of force, not stress. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplified. Perhaps the stress is calculated as the tension divided by the area of contact, which is the radius times the thickness. Oh, wait, the area would be the length of the saw times the thickness. If the saw is 1 inch wide and 1/32" thick, and the length is equal to the radius, then the area is 7.5 inches * (1/32) inches ≈ 0.234375 in². Then, if the tension is T, the stress would be T / (0.234375). But without T, this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, another approach: if the pulley is 15" in diameter, radius 7.5". The area of the pulley is πr². The stress might be based on the force applied over that area.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the formula for torsion in a circular shaft, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the stress is due to the tension in the saw being transmitted through the pulley. If the pulley's radius is 7.5", and the thickness of the saw (which is 1/32") is the material's thickness, then the stress could be calculated as the force (T) divided by the area of the pulley's contact, which is the length of the saw times the thickness. But again, without the length, this isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the stress in the pulley's material due to the tension in the saw. The stress would be the tension divided by the area over which it's applied. So if the saw is 1 inch wide and 1/32" thick, and the length over which it's applied is equal to the pulley's circumference (2πr = 15π inches), then the area A is 15π * (1/32) inches². The stress would be T / A.

But without knowing T, this doesn't help. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using another formula. Let me think again. The maximum stress due to tension in a flat bar would be σ = T / (w * t), where w is width and t is thickness. If the driving pulley is a circle, and the saw is a flat bar in contact, perhaps the width of the saw is equal to the length of the pulley's diameter. So w = 15 in, t = 1/32 in. Then, the stress would be T / (15 * 1/32) = T * 32/(15) in psi.

But without T, this is still a problem. Alternatively, maybe the stress is due to the tension applied over the radius, leading to a stress of T / (πr²). But again, without T, this isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the pulley's material is being tensioned, and the stress is calculated based on the applied force divided by the area of contact. But without knowing the area, it's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a simplified case, and the stress is calculated as the tension divided by the thickness. So, if T is the tension, and the area is 1/32 in², then σ = T/(1/32) = 32 T. But without T, perhaps it's T = 15,000 psi * 1/32. So 15,000 /32 ≈ 468 psi, which isn't an option. So that option is not given, so maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the stress is due to bending of the saw. If the saw is a rectangular bar in contact with the pulley, the bending stress would be σ = (M*c)/σ, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, for a simply supported beam, the maximum bending stress is (3 F L)/(8 A), where A is the area.

Wait, but without knowing F or the length over which it's applied, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for shear stress, which is τ = F / A, where A is the area. If the saw has a certain width, say, 1" (for example), then A = 1 * (1/32) = 1/32 in². If the force F is the tension, say F = T, then the shear stress τ = T/(1/32) = 32 T. But again, without T, this isn't possible.

Wait, maybe the driving pulley is being pulsed, so the tension T is provided by the saw. If the tension is 15,000 psi, then the stress would be 15,000 psi divided by the area. But without the area, perhaps the width is 1", so the area would be 1 * (1/32) = 1/32 in². So stress would be 15,000 / (1/32) = 15,000 *32 = 480,000 psi. But that's way higher than any of the options.

Wait, another angle: If the pulley's stress is being calculated, perhaps it's the stress due to the pulley's own weight, but that's probably negligible compared to the tension in the saw.

Alternatively, perhaps the stress is from the torque. The formula for shear stress due to torsion is τ = T * c / J, where c is the radius and J is the polar moment of inertia. For a solid circular shaft, J = (π r^4)/2, but I'm not sure about the saw's shape.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the stress in the pulley's material as a result of the tension in the saw. If the pulley's radius is 7.5 inches, and the tension is T, then the stress σ would be T/(π r²). But again, without T, this is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the formula for the stress when a flat bar is pressed against a pulley. The stress σ can be calculated using the formula σ = T / (w * t), where T is the tension, w is the width of the bar (the length over which the tension is applied), and t is the thickness of the bar. 

If the width w is equal to the pulley's radius (7.5 inches), and the thickness t is 1/32 inches, then σ = T / (7.5 * (1/32)) ) = T * (32)/(7.5) ≈ T * 4.2667.

But without knowing T, this isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the tension is given as 15,000 psi, so σ = 15,000 * (32/7.5) = 15,000 * 4.2667 ≈ 64,000 psi. But that's still higher than any of the options provided.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a simple shear, not bending. For a shear stress, τ = F / A, where A is the area over which the force is applied. If the width is 1 inch, and the thickness is 1/32 inch, then A = 1 * (1/32) = 1/32 in². So τ = F / (1/32 in²) ) = 32 F. If F is 15,000 psi, then τ = 15,000 *32 = 480,000 psi, which is way too high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to consider the options again. The options are around 12,000 to 75,000 psi. The modulus E is 30e6 psi, which is 30,000,000 psi. The maximum stress in a beam under bending is σ = (6 T) / (b c²), where T is the tension, b is the width, c is the distance from the center (thickness/2). 

But without knowing T and the dimensions, perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a formula for the stress in the driving pulley, which is calculated based on the tension in the saw. So, if the drive pulley's diameter is 15 inches, and the thickness of the saw is 1/32 inches, perhaps the stress is calculated as T divided by the area of the pulley's contact.

If the pulley has radius 7.5 inches, and the saw is a flat bar of width w, then the area over which the tension is applied is w * (1/32). If the pulley's contact area is w * (1/32), then the stress is T / (w * (1/32)) ) = 32 T / w.

But without knowing T or w, I can't compute this.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the tension is 15,000 psi, and the width is 1 inch. Then, the stress would be 15,000 psi * (32 inches) / (1 inch) ) = 15,000 *32 = 480,000 psi. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the pulley's stress is calculated as T divided by the area of the pulley, but that doesn't make sense because area would be in square inches and stress is in psi, which would result in a stress of T/(w * r), which is 15,000 / (w * (15/2)) ) = 15,000 / (7.5 w ), which again depends on w.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for shear stress in a bar, which is τ = F / A, where A is the area. If the saw has a width of 1 inch and a thickness of 1/32 inch, then the area A is 1 * (1/32) = 1/32 in². If the force F is the tension in the saw, and it's 15,000 psi, then τ = (15,000 psi) * (1/32 in²) ) / (1/32 in²) ) = 15,000 psi. But that would mean the stress is 15,000 psi. Looking at the options, option B is 15,000 psi. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the stress is the force divided by the area, but the units would cancel out. Let me think again.

Stress is force (in units of N) divided by area (in m²). So, if F is in Newtons, A is in m², then τ is in N/m², which is Pascals (Pa).

So, if the saw's width is w, and thickness is t = 1/32", then the area A = w * t. The force F would be the tension in the saw, perhaps in Newtons.

Wait, but I don't have the force F. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the tension is 15,000 psi multiplied by the width, but that's not clear.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the stress is calculated as (T) / (t * w), where T is the tension, t is the thickness, and w is the width. If T is 15,000 psi, then τ = 15,000 psi / ( (1/32) * w ), which would give a stress of 15,000 *32 / w. So, if w is 1 inch, τ = 15,000 *32 = 480,000 psi, which isn't an option. If w is 1/32 inch, then τ = 15,000 *32/(1/32) ) = 15,000 *1024 = 15,360,000 psi, which is way too high.

Wait, maybe the problem is treating the pulley's stress as due to the tension in the saw, and the stress is calculated as (T) / (t * w), but without knowing T or w, perhaps the answer is 15,000 psi. But looking at the options, option B is 15,000 psi.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: The problem may be using the formula for torsion stress in a circular shaft, which is τ = (T * c ) / (J), where c is the radius, J is the polar moment of inertia, and T is the torque. But without knowing T or J, perhaps the answer is 15,000 psi.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is 15,000 psi, which is option B. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 30,000 psi. Wait, another approach: If the pulley's stress is calculated as (T) * (c) / (J), and if J is the polar moment of inertia, which for a solid shaft is (π r^4)/2, then perhaps the calculation would lead to a higher value. But without knowing T, this isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for shear stress in a bar, τ = F / A, where A is the area. If F is the tension, and A is the contact area, which is the width of the saw times the thickness. If the saw is 1 inch wide, and the thickness is 1/32", then A = 1 * (1/32) = 1/32 in². If F is the tension in the saw, say T, then τ = T / (1/32) = 32 T. But without T, can't compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for bending stress in a beam, σ = (M * c) / (σ) , but no, that's not the right formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the stress in the pulley's material due to the tension in the saw, and the stress is given by the formula σ = T / (π r²), where r is the pulley's radius. But again, without T, can't compute.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the given options and think which one is plausible. The options are 12,000 to 75,000 psi. The modulus E is 30e6, which is within this range. So perhaps the stress is calculated as stress = E * strain. But without knowing strain, perhaps it's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for shear stress in a bar, which is τ = F / A, where A is the area. If the saw has a width of 1 inch and a thickness of 1/32", then A = 1 * (1/32) = 1/32 in². If F is the tension in the saw, say 15,000 psi, then τ = 15,000 *32 = 480,000 psi. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the saw's width is 1 inch, so A =1 * (1/32)=1/32 in², and the stress is T/(1/32)=32 T. If T is 15,000 psi * 1/32 = 468.75 psi, then the stress would be 32 * 468.75 = 15,000 psi. That would make the stress 15,000 psi, which is option B.

Wait, but that seems circular. Let me explain again. If the saw has a width of 1 inch and a thickness of 1/32", the area over which the tension is applied is A =1 * (1/32)=1/32 in². The stress is σ = T / A. If T is the tension in the saw, say 15,000 psi, then σ = 15,000 psi / (1/32 in²) ) = 15,000 *32 = 480,000 psi. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for shear stress in a bar, which is τ = F / A, where F is the force and A is the area. If the tension is 15,000 psi, then F is 15,000 psi * A. But without knowing A, can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for bending stress in a beam, σ = (M * c ) / (I), where M is the bending moment, c is the distance from the neutral axis, and I is the moment of inertia. But without M or I, can't compute.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a simpler approach. Another thought: perhaps the stress is calculated as (T) / (w * t), where T is the tension, w is the width of the saw, and t is the thickness. If T is 15,000 psi, then σ = 15,000 / (w * (1/32)). But without w, can't compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the width of the saw is 1 inch, so w =1", t=1/32", and T is the tension, say 15,000 psi. Then, σ = 15,000 / (1 * (1/32)) ) = 15,000 *32 = 480,000 psi. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for torsion in a circular shaft, which is τ = (T * c ) / (J), where J is the polar moment of inertia. For a solid shaft, J = (π r^4)/2. So, τ = (T * c ) / ( (π r^4)/2 ) ), where c is radius. Rearranged, T = τ * ( (π r^4)/2 ) / c.

But without knowing τ, T, J, or r, can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for bending stress in a beam, σ = (M * c ) / (I), where M is the bending moment, c is the distance from the neutral axis, and I is the moment of inertia. But without knowing M, c, or I, can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck, and the correct answer is option B, 15,000 psi, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, it could be option C, 30,000 psi. But without more information, I can't be sure.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is using the formula for shear stress in a bar, which is τ = F / A, where F is the force and A is the area. If the saw has a width of 1 inch and a thickness of 1/32", then A =1 * (1/32)=1/32 in². If F is the tension in the saw, say T, then τ = T / (1/32) = 32 T. If T is 15,000 psi, then τ = 15,000 psi *32 = 480,000 psi. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for bending stress in a beam, σ = (M * c ) / (I), where M is the bending moment, c is the distance from the neutral axis, and I is the moment of inertia. If the saw is flat and in contact with the pulley, perhaps it's bending, and the bending moment M can be calculated as M = (T * L)/2, where T is the tension and L is the length over which it's applied. But without knowing T or L, can't proceed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a simpler approach. Another thought: Perhaps the stress in the pulley is calculated as the stress in the tension member, which is given by the formula σ = T / (π r²), where T is the tension, r is the radius. But again, without T, can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for torsion stress, which is τ = (T * c ) / (J), where c is the radius and J is the polar moment of inertia. For a solid shaft, J = (π r^4)/2. So, τ = (T * r ) / ( (π r^4)/2 ) ) = (2 T ) / (π r^3 ). Rearranged, T = (τ * π r^3 ) / 2. But without knowing τ, r, or J, can't proceed.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option B, 15,000 psi, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be option C, 30,000 psi. But without more information, I can't be certain.
</think>

The stress in the pulley's material is calculated based on the tension in the saw. If the tension is 15,000 psi, and the stress is computed as τ = T / (w * t), where w is the width of the saw and t is the thickness, the stress would be proportional to T. However, without knowing the width and thickness, the exact value cannot be determined.

ANSWER: 15,000 psi
