Okay, so I've got this question about Say's law. I remember that Say's law has something to do with economics. Let me think. Say was an economist, right? He talked about the relationship between supply and demand. Oh wait, I think he said that the production of goods should be self-created by the factors of production, not just demanded by consumers. So maybe that's one part of the law.

Wait, what was the actual statement of Say's law again? I think it's about the idea that the means of production should not be taken as ends. Like, you can't take a bar as an end; you have to create it. So that would mean that supply isn't created by demand. So if supply goes up, demand would go down? Or is it the other way around? Because Say's law suggests that factors of production are the ones creating the supply, not the consumers' demand.

Looking at the options, option C says when supply goes up, demand goes down. That fits. Because Say's law implies that production (supply) is not just demanded by consumers. So when there's more supply, consumers won't want to buy as much, so demand would fall.

Another option is option H: price creates its own demand. But that sounds a bit circular. Say's law is about production, not about price. So H might not be correct.

Option A: price goes up, supply goes up. I don't think that's correct. Say's law doesn't say that price is the cause; it's more about the production side. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: no correlation. That doesn't make sense because Say's law does suggest a relationship between supply and demand.

Option D: demand creates its own supply. I don't think that's right. That would be the classical economic theory, maybe, but Say's law is about production rather than demand creating supply.

Option E: demand goes up, supply goes down. That's the opposite of Say's law. If demand increases, supply would go up, not down. So E is incorrect.

Option F: demand up, price down. That's the law of demand, which is a different concept. Say's law is about production, not about how consumers' demand affects prices.

Option G: supply creates demand. No, that's the opposite. Say's law says production (supply) is created by factors, not consumers' demand.

Option I: price creates demand. Again, circular. Say's law is about production, not about how prices affect demand.

Option J: better to receive than give. That's more about individual incentives, like how people choose to produce versus consume. Say's law is about the division of labor and production, not individual choices.

So the correct answer should be option C: when supply goes up, demand goes down. That's consistent with Say's law which states that production (supply) is self-created, not just demanded.

The correct answer is C: when supply goes up, demand goes down. According to Say's law, the production of goods (supply) should be self-created by the factors of production, not merely demanded by consumers. This means that an increase in supply would lead to a decrease in demand, as seen in option C.

Answer: C
