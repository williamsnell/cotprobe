Okay, so I've got this question here about the boiling point of water under a certain pressure. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that the enthalpy change (ΔH') of water is 40,600 J per mole at 100°C. Wait, but wait, enthalpy change is usually related to phase changes. Oh, wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. The standard enthalpy change for vaporization is usually around 40.7 kJ/mol, which is 40,700 J/mol. So maybe ΔH was given as the heat of vaporization. That makes sense because vaporization is when a liquid turns into gas, and that's where the enthalpy comes from.

So, the question is about the boiling point at a pressure of 0.750 atm. I remember that the boiling point decreases as the pressure decreases because of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. But wait, the question gives the enthalpy change, so maybe I can use the equation for vapor pressure dependence on temperature.

Wait, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the change in vapor pressure with temperature. The formula is dP/dT = (ΔH_vap)/(R T²). But since we're dealing with a specific temperature change, perhaps we can use a simplified version. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the equation in terms of the change in boiling point.

Wait, alternatively, I can use the relation that the boiling point (Tb) and the vapor pressure (P) are related through the equation. But I think the equation is more accurately derived from the derivatives. Alternatively, the formula for the change in boiling point due to a change in pressure is (ΔP) = ΔH_vap / (R T^2) (1/Tb - 1/Tb_new). Wait, no, that might be more complicated. 

Wait, another approach is to find the vapor pressure at the new temperature and relate it to the original. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think again.

At standard conditions, the boiling point of water is 100°C at 1 atm. The question is, what is the boiling point at 0.750 atm. So, if the pressure decreases, the boiling point should decrease. So, for example, at lower pressure, water boils at a lower temperature. So the options given are from A (75) up to D (92). But wait, 0.75 atm is lower than 1 atm, so the boiling point should be lower than 100. So the options are 75, 85, 100, 92.

Wait, but 0.75 atm is significantly lower than 1 atm, so the change in boiling point should be substantial. Let me think about the exact calculation.

The equation I think is: ln(P2/P1) = ΔH_vap/(R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] / (ΔH_vap/(R)) ) or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps the better way is to use the equation for vapor pressure as a function of temperature. The equation is P = P0 * exp( -ΔH_vap/(R T) ), where P0 is the vapor pressure at a reference temperature T0.

Wait, okay, let's make it precise. The vapor pressure P is given by P = P0 * exp( -ΔH_vap/(R T) ), where P0 is the vapor pressure at temperature T0. 

In this problem, we have two conditions: initial pressure P1 = 1 atm, initial boiling point Tb1 = 100°C. We need to find Tb2 at P2 = 0.750 atm.

So, rearranging the equation:

ln(P2/P1) = (-ΔH_vap/R) * (1/Tb2 - 1/Tb1)

Wait, but I might have the signs wrong. Let's think: when temperature increases, P increases. So, the equation should be:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) / (something) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

ln(P2 / P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] / (ΔH_vap / R) ) → no, that's not right.

Alternatively, I think the correct equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) / (something). Alternatively, perhaps the equation is:

ln(P2) = ln(P1) + (ΔH_vap/(R T1)) (1 - (T2/T1)) )

Wait, no, that doesn't look right. Maybe I should use the exact form. So, let's write the equation again.

P = P0 exp( -ΔH_vap/(R T) )

At initial condition, P1 = 1 atm, T1 = 100°C = 373.15 K.

At condition 2, P2 = 0.750 atm, T2 = ?

So, 

P2 = P1 * exp( - (ΔH_vap/(R T2)) + (ΔH_vap/(R T1)) ) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: P2 = P1 * exp( -ΔH_vap/(R T2) + (ΔH_vap/(R T1)) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write:

ln(P2/P1) = - (ΔH_vap/R) [1/T2 - 1/T1 ]

Yes, that makes sense. Because when T increases, 1/T decreases, so the term (1/T2 - 1/T1) is negative, and multiplied by -ΔH_vap/R, which is a positive value, so ln(P2/P1) is positive, so P2 > P1, which is correct because pressure is lower.

So, given that, let's compute this.

We have:

ln(P2/P1) = - (ΔH_vap/R) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ]

We can rearrange this:

1/T2 = 1/T1 - (R ln(P2/P1)) / ΔH_vap

Wait, let me plug in the values.

ΔH_vap is 40,700 J/mol (since 40,600 J/mol is given, but perhaps I should use 40600 J/mol for more accurate calculation).

Wait, the question says 40,600 J/mol, so 40600 J/mol.

R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol*K).

P2 is 0.750 atm, P1 is 1 atm.

So ln(P2/P1) = ln(0.750/1) = ln(0.75) ≈ -0.28768.

Putting into the equation:

1/T2 = 1/373.15 - (8.314 * (-0.28768)) / 40600

Wait, let me compute each part.

First, compute (8.314 * (-0.28768)) → 8.314 * -0.28768 ≈ approximately -2.395.

Then, divide by 40600 → -2.395 / 40600 ≈ -0.00005905.

So 1/T2 = 1/373.15 - (-0.00005905) = 1/373.15 + 0.00005905.

Compute 1/373.15: that's approximately 0.00268 (since 1/373 ≈ 0.00268).

Adding 0.00005905 → 0.002739.

So 1/T2 ≈ 0.002739 → T2 = 1 / 0.002739 ≈ 365 K.

Convert K to Celsius: 365 - 273.15 ≈ 91.85°C. So approximately 91.85°C.

Looking at the options, option D is 92°C, which is quite close. So the boiling point is about 92°C, which is option D.

To determine the boiling point of water at a pressure of 0.750 atm, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = -\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

### Given:
- \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm} \), \( T_1 = 100^\circ \text{C} = 373.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_2 = 0.750 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 40,600 \, \text{J/mol} \)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)

### Step 1: Rearrange the equation
Rearranging the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{T_1} + \frac{R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)}{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) \)
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{0.750}{1}\right) = \ln(0.75) \approx -0.28768
\]

### Step 3: Substitute values into the equation
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{373.15} + \frac{8.314 \cdot (-0.28768)}{40600}
\]

First, calculate the second term:
\[
8.314 \cdot (-0.28768) \approx -2.395
\]
\[
\frac{-2.395}{40600} \approx -0.00005905
\]

Now, add this to \( \frac{1}{T_1} \):
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{373.15} - 0.00005905
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} \)
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} \approx 0.00268 + 0.00005905 \approx 0.002739
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( T_2 \)
\[
T_2 = \frac{1}{0.002739} \approx 365 \, \text{K}
\]

Convert \( T_2 \) to Celsius:
\[
T_2 = 365 - 273.15 \approx 91.85^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Final Answer:
The boiling point of water at 0.750 atm is approximately \( 92^\circ \text{C} \), which corresponds to option D.
