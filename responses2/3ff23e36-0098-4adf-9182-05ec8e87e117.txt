Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about half-life and reaction orders. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says: The half-life for a given reaction was halved as the initial concentration of a reactant was doubled. What is n for this component?

Hmm. I remember that the half-life of a reaction depends on the order of the reaction. The half-life formula for different orders is different. Let's recall them.

For a zero-order reaction, the half-life is t1/2 = (1/(2k)) - (1/(2C0)). Wait, no, wait. I think I got that mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, the half-life formulas: 

Zero order: t₁/₂ = 1/(2k) - 1/(2C₀)
First order: t₁/₂ = (ln2)/k
Second order: t₁/₂ = 1/(k C₀) - 1/(2k)
Wait, let me make sure. I've probably gotten that wrong before.

Alternatively, another approach: the half-life for a first-order reaction is inversely proportional to the initial concentration. Because, t1/2 = ln(2)/k. So if C0 increases, t1/2 decreases. That's right. 

For a second-order reaction, the half-life is 1/(k C0). So if C0 doubles, the half-life halves. Because if C0 was 1, t1/2 is 1/k. If C0 becomes 2, t1/2 is 1/(2k), so half.

Wait, let's see:

If the half-life is halved when the initial concentration is doubled, that must mean that for this specific order, the half-life is inversely proportional to the initial concentration. Because when C0 doubles, t1/2 halves.

So, for a second-order reaction, the half-life is inversely proportional to C0. So, if C0 increases by a factor of m, the half-life decreases by 1/m.

In the problem, the initial concentration is doubled, so m=2. The half-life is halved, so 1/2. So, this fits with a second-order reaction.

Wait, but what if the reaction was of another order? Let's check:

For a first-order reaction, t1/2 is 1/k. If C0 doubles, 1/k remains the same. So the half-life doesn't change. But in the problem, it's halved. So first order doesn't fit.

Second order: t1/2 is 1/(k C0). If C0 doubles, 1/(k*(2C0)) equals (1/(2k C0)) which is half of 1/(k C0). So yes, the half-life halves when C0 is doubled. So the order is 2.

Wait, but the question is asking what is n for this component. Oh, right, n is the order of the reaction. So n is 2.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says, what is the order n? So the correct answer would be D:3? Wait, no. Wait, I thought it was 2. Oh, but let me double-check the other options.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are A:1, B:-1, C:6, D:3, E:0, F:7, G:4, H:5, I:1/2, J:2.

So, according to my analysis, the correct order is 2, which is option J.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Did I make a mistake in my earlier reasoning?

The question states: "The half-life for a given reaction was halved as the initial concentration of a reactant was doubled." So, when [A] doubles, t1/2 halves. So, for a reaction where t1/2 is inversely proportional to [A], the order is 2. So yes, n=2.

Alternatively, if the reaction was third-order, then t1/2 would be 1/(2k C0^2). So if C0 is doubled, t1/2 would be 1/(2k (2 C0)^2 )= 1/(2k *4 C0^2) )= 1/(8k C0^2). But when [A] doubles, t1/2 would be (1/(2k C0^2)) * (1/4) )= (1/(8k C0^2)). So the original t1/2 was 1/(2k C0^2). So the new t1/2 is half of that, but not exactly a simple halving. Because the original is 1/(2k C0^2) and the new is 1/(8k C0^2), so it's (1/(8k C0^2)) divided by (1/(2k C0^2)) )= 1/(4) )= 1/4. So the new t1/2 is 1/4 of the original, not 1/2. So, that would not fit. So third order probably doesn't fit the scenario.

Wait, but wait. The initial problem says the half-life was halved when the initial concentration was doubled. So, the ratio is (new t1/2)/(old t1/2) = 1/2.

For a second-order reaction: t1/2 = 1/(k C0). So if C0 becomes 2C0, t1/2 becomes 1/(2k C0) = (1/(k C0)) * (1/2). So the new t1/2 is half the old. So when C0 doubles, t1/2 halves. Exactly the scenario described.

So, the order is 2, so the correct answer is J:2.
</think>

The problem involves determining the order of a reaction based on how its half-life changes with the initial concentration of a reactant. Specifically, it states that the half-life was halved when the initial concentration of the reactant was doubled. This indicates that the half-life is inversely proportional to the initial concentration, which is characteristic of a second-order reaction.

For a second-order reaction, the half-life is given by:

\[
t_{1/2} = \frac{1}{k C_0}
\]

If the initial concentration \( C_0 \) doubles, the half-life becomes:

\[
t_{1/2}' = \frac{1}{k (2 C_0)} = \frac{1}{2k C_0} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{k C_0} = \frac{1}{2} t_{1/2}
\]

This confirms that the half-life is halved when the initial concentration doubles, which fits the given condition. Therefore, the reaction is second-order, and the order \( n \) is 2.

Analyzing the options provided, the correct answer is:
