Question:

A randomized controlled trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) compared with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy. Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?

Options:

A: 90%
B: 80%
C: 1%
D: 60%
E: 20%
F: 40%
G: 70%
H: 50%
I: 10%
J: 30%

Okay, so I've got this question about a randomized controlled trial, and I need to figure out the statistical power of the study. Hmm, let's break it down.

The study is comparing Drug X with a standard single-drug antihypertensive therapy. The participants are 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) aged 30-60. Their baseline BP is 150/95 mmHg or higher. Antihypertensive is effective if BP drops below 140/90 mmHg.

The study design involves setting two probabilities: the probability of wrongly concluding Drug X is more effective (Type I error, alpha) is 1%, and the probability of wrongly concluding the two drugs are equally effective (Type II error, beta) is 10%. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says they set the probability of wrongly finding Drug X more effective as 1%. So that's alpha, the Type I error rate. Then, they set the probability of wrongly finding that the two drugs are equally effective as 10%. Hmm, wait, that wording is a bit confusing. Wait, in hypothesis testing, the Type II error is the probability of failing to reject the null when it's false. So, the study is comparing two drugs. So, when they set the probability of wrongly concluding Drug X is more effective, that's about setting the alpha (alpha) to 1%, which is the probability of a Type I error, i.e., rejecting the null when it's true.

The other part says they set the probability of wrongly finding that the two drugs are the same as 10%. Oh, wait, that seems like the Type II error rate (beta) is 10%. Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The null hypothesis is that the two drugs are equally effective. So if the study incorrectly concludes that the drugs are equally effective when in fact they are not, that's a Type II error. So the probability of that is beta, and they set beta to 10%. So the study has alpha = 1% and beta = 10%.

Statistical power is 1 - beta. So if beta is 10%, then power is 90%. So the answer should be A:90%.

Wait, but wait. What if I have to calculate it from the given info? Wait, the question says the setup, not the actual stats of the study. So I think the setup defines the parameters, and the question is about the power given these parameters. The question is asking for the statistical power, which is 1 minus beta. So the options include 90%, which would be correct if beta is 10%.

The study is comparing two antihypertensive drugs, with the goal of determining the statistical power. The investigators set the Type I error rate (alpha) to 1%, which is the probability of incorrectly concluding that Drug X is more effective when it is not. They also set the Type II error rate (beta) to 10%, which is the probability of incorrectly concluding that the two drugs are equally effective when they are not. 

Statistical power is calculated as \( 1 - \beta \). Given that \( \beta = 10\% \), the statistical power is \( 1 - 0.10 = 90\% \).

The correct answer is **90%**.

**Answer: A**
