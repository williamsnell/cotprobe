Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option is recommended for cleaning the mouth. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that mouth hygiene is important because it helps prevent the spread of infections. But I'm not exactly sure which specific products are used for this. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Baking soda. I think baking soda is used in some cleaning products, maybe for toothpaste. But is it used for mouth cleaning? I'm not certain. I might have heard it used for some body清洁, but I'm not sure about the mouth.

Option B: Hydrogen peroxide. Oh wait, hydrogen peroxide is commonly used in hand washing. It's a common ingredient in hand sanitizers. But does it have any effect on the mouth? I don't recall it being specifically recommended for mouth cleaning, but it might have some antibacterial effect.

Option C: Water. That's the most obvious choice. Water is the foundation of all cleaning products. It's used to dilute other chemicals. But is water alone enough? I think adding some cleaning agent would be better.

Option D: Bleach. I remember reading that bleach is used in some personal care products, like toothpaste, but I'm not sure if it's effective for mouth cleaning. Maybe it's used in some personal care products but not specifically for cleaning.

Option E: Alcohol swabs. Alcohol is used as a cleaning agent. I think some mouth washes or mouth care products use alcohol. So maybe this is a possible option. But I'm not sure if it's the recommended one.

Option F: Normal saline. I think normal saline solution is used in some hand or mouth care products. But again, I'm not sure if it's the best for mouth.

Option G: Vinegar. Vinegar is a common cleaning agent too. It's used in hand and mouth care products. I think it can help with some mouth issues, like bad breath, but is it the recommended one for mouth cleaning?

Option H: Mouthwash containing alcohol. Oh, I remember something about mouthwashes with alcohol. Some mouthwashes are made specifically with alcohol to help with mouth cleaning. That sounds like a good option.

Option I: Lemon and glycerine swabs. Lemon and glycerine are used as a mild cleanser. So using swabs made with these might be a good way to clean the mouth, especially if you don't want strong chemicals.

Option J: Dish soap. That's a harsh cleaner. I don't think dish soap is recommended for cleaning the mouth because it's too strong and can cause irritation. It's more for personal care products.

So, putting it all together, the main contenders are options H, I, and E. Because option H's mouthwash is specifically alcohol-based, which is effective. Option I uses a mild cleanser, which is gentle on the mouth. Option E is a physical agent used as a swab, which can also clean the mouth.

I'm a bit confused between H and I. Which one is more recommended? From what I remember, mouthwashes with alcohol are often preferred because they can be applied with a soft brush, which is gentle. That might prevent irritation. On the other hand, using lemon and glycerine swabs directly is also a common method. 

Wait, but the question is about cleaning, which suggests using a solution rather than a physical agent. So H's mouthwash is likely the recommended method because it's a solution that can be applied and cleaned properly. Option I, using a swab, might be more of a personal care application rather than a method to clean the mouth.

So the best answer would be option H: Mouthwash containing alcohol.

The recommended method for cleaning the mouth is to use a mouthwash containing alcohol. This is because mouthwashes with alcohol are effective and gentle, allowing for proper cleaning without irritation. 

Answer: H
