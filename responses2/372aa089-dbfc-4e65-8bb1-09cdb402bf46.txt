Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a muscle fiber contracting and lifting a weight. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the muscle fiber contracts by 3.5 cm, and it lifts a weight. The muscle obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx, where k is the force constant. Oh wait, Hooke's law is typically F = -kx, right? So the force exerted by the muscle is proportional to how much it's stretched or compressed.

The options are all in joules, so I'll need to calculate the work done. Work done by a variable force can be found by integrating F dx from the initial position to the final position. But wait, since Hooke's law is linear, maybe it's a simple area under the force vs displacement graph.

So, the muscle's force is F = -k x. But wait, the problem says it's lifting a weight, so the force the muscle exerts must be equal to the weight being lifted. Or is the weight the force applied? Or maybe the muscle's force is the force lifting the weight. Hmm, perhaps the force applied by the muscle is the same as the weight. Let me think.

Wait, in the context of Hooke's law, if the muscle is being stretched, the force it exerts is F = -k x. But the muscle is lifting a weight, so when the muscle contracts (x positive), it's pulling the weight up, so the force would be positive. So, perhaps the force is F = kx, since the negative sign would represent the direction opposite to the displacement. Wait, but when the muscle contracts, x is positive, so F is positive. So F = kx, where x is the extension, but wait, in this case the displacement is a contraction, so x would be positive.

Wait, but the muscle is contracting by 3.5 cm, so x would be 0.035 meters. So F would be k * x, which is 750 N/m * 0.035 m. Let me calculate that: 750 * 0.035 is 26.25 N. But wait, the correct approach would be to compute the work done by the muscle as it's contracting. So the muscle's force is F = kx, and the displacement is in the direction of the force, so the work done is the integral from x_initial to x_final of F dx.

Wait, but what's the initial and final position here. The muscle is contracting by 3.5 cm. So initial x is zero (assuming it's at equilibrium, or perhaps before contraction), and the final x is 0.035 meters. So the integral of F dx would be the integral from 0 to 3.5 cm of k x dx. 

The integral of x dx is (1/2) xÂ². So evaluating from 0 to 0.035 m: (1/2) * (0.035)^2 * k.

Wait, let me compute that. 0.035 squared is 0.001225. Multiply by k (750 N/m): 750 * 0.001225 = 0.91875. Then multiply by 1/2: about 0.459375 joules. Approximately 0.46 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.46 J. So that's probably the answer. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the direction of the force. Since the muscle is contracting, the force it exerts is opposite to the direction of displacement. So the work done by the muscle would be negative, but in this case, the question says the work performed by the fiber. Wait, actually, in physics, work done by a force is positive when the force and displacement are in the same direction. But in this case, the muscle is exerting a force to contract, which is in the same direction as the displacement. So the work would be positive.

Wait, but wait, the force equation is F = -k x. So if x is the extension (positive), the force is negative. But when the muscle contracts, x is increasing, so the displacement is positive, but the force is negative. So the force is opposite to the direction of displacement, meaning that the muscle is doing negative work. Hmm, wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, think about the work done by the muscle. The muscle is contracting, so the displacement is in the positive direction (say, x increases from 0 to 0.035 m). The force exerted by the muscle is F = k x, because when the muscle is contracted, the force is in the positive x direction. So, the force is positive, and the displacement is positive. So the work done by the muscle is positive. That would be the integral from 0 to 0.035 of F dx, which is the integral of k x dx, leading to 0.46 J as before.

So the correct answer should be B: 0.46 J.

To calculate the work performed by the muscle fiber, we use the fact that the muscle obeys Hooke's law, \( F = -kx \), where \( k = 750 \, \text{N/m} \) and the displacement is \( x = 3.5 \, \text{cm} = 0.035 \, \text{m} \). The work done by the muscle is given by the integral of the force over the displacement:

\[
W = \int_{0}^{x} F \, dx = \int_{0}^{0.035} kx \, dx
\]

The integral of \( kx \) with respect to \( x \) is:

\[
\int kx \, dx = \frac{1}{2} kx^2
\]

Evaluating this from \( 0 \) to \( 0.035 \, \text{m} \):

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} kx^2 = \frac{1}{2} (750) (0.035)^2
\]

First, calculate \( 0.035^2 \):

\[
0.035^2 = 0.001225
\]

Then multiply by \( 750 \):

\[
750 \times 0.001225 = 0.91875
\]

Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.91875 = 0.459375 \, \text{J}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the work performed by the muscle fiber is approximately \( 0.46 \, \text{J} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: 0.46 J**
