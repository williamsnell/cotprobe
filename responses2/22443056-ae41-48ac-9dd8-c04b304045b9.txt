Question:

Discuss cognitive development during adolescence as describedby Piaget.

Options:

A: The stage of formal operations begins at about the age of 11 when the child begins to think abstractly, hypothetically, and idealistically.
B: Cognitive development peaks in early adolescence and declines thereafter.
C: Cognitive development during adolescence is marked by a return to sensory-motor thinking.
D: Cognitive development begins in adolescence.
E: Cognitive development ends with the stage of formal operations.
F: Adolescents revert to egocentric thinking patterns that are typical of early childhood.
G: The stage of formal operations is only reached by a minority of individuals, with most never advancing beyond concrete operations.
H: The stage of formal operations is achieved by all individuals by the age of 8.
I: Cognitive development is characterized by the ability to deal with concrete situations.
J: Adolescents primarily focus on developing practical skills rather than abstract thinking.

Alright, I'm trying to tackle this question about cognitive development during adolescence as described by Jean Piaget. Let me think through each option step by step.

So the question is asking about Piaget's description of cognitive development in adolescence. The options are A to J. I'll need to recall what Piaget's stages are and how they relate to adolescence.

Piaget's model has four main stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, operational, and reflective. Each stage represents a distinct period of cognitive development. 

Starting with the sensorimotor stage, which is about 2-7 years. Here, children learn through direct interaction with their environment, processing information in a concrete way. So during this stage, they might focus more on the physical and environmental aspects rather than abstract thinking.

The preoperational stage occurs around 8-11 years. This is where children begin to think in a more abstract and illogical ways. They might engage in some conventional thinking but still struggle with complex mental operations. So during this stage, cognitive development is still active, but it's not yet at the operational stage. They might still have some egocentric thinking, where they don't consider others' perspectives.

The operational stage is around 11-16 years. Here, children start to develop the ability to think more logically and systematically. They can perform some operations, like using hypothetical reasoning. This is when they might start to think more abstractly, hypothetically, and idealistically. So option A says the formal operations begin at 11, which is correct. But let me check the other options to see if any fit better.

Option B: Cognitive development peaks in early adolescence and declines. Wait, I thought that during early adolescence, cognitive abilities peak, but Piaget's model shows that they continue to develop. So B might not be correct because the question is about Piaget's description, not the actual peak.

Option C: Cognitive development returns to sensory-motor thinking. That doesn't sound right. In Piaget's model, after the preoperational stage (around 11), the child enters the operational stage where they start to think more logically. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Cognitive development begins in adolescence. No, Piaget's stages are set in specific ages.Sensorimotor before 2, preoperational around 8-11, operational 11-16, reflective (formal) later, maybe 16 onwards? So the stages are not all marked by adolescence. So D is incorrect because it's too broad.

Option E: Cognitive development ends with formal operations. That's not right. Formal operations are the later stage after reflective thinking, so I think the reflective stage is when formal operations begin. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Adolescents revert to egocentric thinking. I don't think so. After the preoperational stage, they start developing logical thinking. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Formal operations are only reached by a minority. That's not true. Piaget's theory suggests that all individuals reach a point in reflective thinking. So G is wrong.

Option H: Formal operations by 8. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Piaget says the reflective stage begins around 16. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Cognitive development is characterized by dealing with concrete situations. That's more of a preoperational stage. In sensorimotor and preoperational, they deal with concrete objects and simple situations. So I doesn't fit Piaget's model.

Option J: Adolescents focus on practical skills. Piaget's developmental stages are about abstract thinking, not just practical skills. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so the only correct statement is option A. Let me double-check. A says the formal operations start at 11, which is the beginning of the operational stage. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option A.

The correct answer is **A: The stage of formal operations begins at about the age of 11 when the child begins to think abstractly, hypothetically, and idealistically.**

**Explanation:**
Piaget's model describes cognitive development across four stages. The sensorimotor stage (2-7 years) involves concrete experiences, the preoperational stage (8-11 years) where abstract thinking starts emerging, the operational stage (11-16 years) where logical thinking begins, and the reflective stage (16 onwards) marked by formal operations. Option A correctly identifies the beginning of formal operations at 11, aligning with Piaget's description. Other options either describe incorrect stages or inaccurately describe Piaget's model.
