Okay, so I've got this question about the money created from a deposit. Hmm, I remember something about the reserve ratio and how it affects the money supply. Let me think.

The question says the reserve ratio is 10 percent, and a new customer deposits $500. We need to find the maximum amount of money created. Right, I think the formula involves the reserve ratio and the initial deposit.

Wait, I recall that when a bank receives a deposit, it has to keep a certain percentage (the reserve ratio) and lend out the rest. So, the initial deposit of $500 is lent out, and the bank keeps 10% as reserves.

So, 10% of $500 is $50. That means the bank keeps $50 in reserves and gives out $450 as loans. But wait, the money that's given out can then be lent out again, right? So, each time the money is lent out, it becomes a deposit at another bank, which then keeps a portion of it as reserves and lends the rest.

I think this creates a multiplier effect. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So, 1/0.10 is 10. That means the initial deposit can lead to 10 times more money being created.

So, $500 multiplied by 10 is $5,000. So the maximum money created should be $5,000. Let me check the options. Option A is $5,000. That seems right. But wait, another thought: sometimes, do I need to consider the initial deposit plus all subsequent deposits? Or is the initial deposit the starting point before any lending?

Wait, the initial deposit is $500. After that, the bank gives out $450 in loans. Those $450 can then be lent out again. So the total money created is $500*(1 + 1/0.10) = $500*10 = $5,000. Hmm, yeah that makes sense.

Alternatively, the money multiplier formula is: money created = deposit * (1 / reserve ratio). Since the reserve ratio is 10%, 1/0.10 is 10. So 500 * 10 is 5000. So option A is correct.

The question involves calculating the maximum money created from a deposit given the reserve ratio and the initial deposit. The reserve ratio is 10%, and the initial deposit is $500. 

1. The reserve ratio (RR) is 10%, so the bank must keep 10% of the deposit as reserves and lend out the remaining 90%.
2. The initial deposit of $500 is lent out, and the bank keeps $50 in reserves ($500 * 10% = $50).
3. The $450 that's lent out can then be deposited by another bank, which in turn keeps 10% (i.e., $45) and lends out $405.
4. This process continues, with each subsequent deposit being lent out 90% of the time, creating a chain reaction.
5. The multiplier effect is calculated as 1 / RR = 1 / 0.10 = 10.
6. Therefore, the total money created is the initial deposit multiplied by the multiplier: $500 * 10 = $5,000.

The correct answer is **$5,000**.
