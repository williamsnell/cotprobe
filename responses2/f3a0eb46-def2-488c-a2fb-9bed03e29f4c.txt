Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which option best illustrates hostile aggression. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, I need to understand what hostile aggression means. Hostile aggression is a type of aggressive behavior that is directed against another person, often in a way that seeks to provoke a response or provoke resistance. It's usually directed against an enemy or adversary, and it's characterized by being aggressive and sometimes violent.

Looking at the options:

Option A: An employee sabotages his coworker's project because of jealousy. sabotaging is about hiding something, so even if it's related to jealousy, it's more about sabotage. Sabotage is more about deceit or hiding rather than aggression directed at another person. So probably not A.

Option B: A waitress breaks cups when she drops a tray. Breaking cups in a workplace is a minor act, but it's a form of physical damage. It doesn't involve aggression towards another person. It's more about stealing or causing harm, but not aggression directed against someone.

Option C: A teacher grades harshly because of a personal grudge. This seems more like a personal conflict. The teacher is being harsh because of a personal dislike, not a direct aggression against someone else. Hostile aggression is about aggression directed at someone else, not about personal resentment.

Option D: A man slaps his wife because he's angry. This is direct aggression. The man is hitting his wife, which is a direct and physical aggression. He's attacking his wife, which is hostile towards her. That's a clear example.

Option E: A sanitation man knocks over rose bushes because he throws an empty can. This is more about destroying something in a public place, perhaps even just cleaning. It's a broken example of aggressive behavior, but it's not hitting someone. It's more about the act of breaking something, which is different from aggression towards someone else.

Option F: A careless driver hitting a pedestrian. This is a minor, but severe injury. It's about causing harm, but it's not directed against someone else. It's more about the act of hitting, not aggression.

So, the options left are C and D. Hostile aggression is when someone attacks or threatens someone else. Option C is about a personal conflict, which could be seen as hostile if the teacher has a grudge, but it's not aggressive towards someone else. Option D is a direct attack on another person, which fits the definition.

So, the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: A man slaps his wife because he is angry that she made hamburgers for dinner again. This best illustrates hostile aggression as it involves direct, physical aggression towards another person.

Answer: D
