Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about calculating the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 100 pm. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to remember what I learned in class.

Wait, photons have energy based on their wavelength, right? Oh right, there's something about the energy of a photon being related to the wavelength. Oh yeah, I think it's the equation E = hc/λ. Yeah, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

But wait, I'm not super confident about the exact values of these constants. Let me think. Planck's constant, h, is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 joule-seconds. And the speed of light, c, is about 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. Oh right, and the wavelength is given in picometers. Oh wait, the question says 100 pm. Oh, that's picometers, which is 10^-12 meters.

So I need to convert that into meters. 100 pm is 100 * 1e-12 m, which is 1e-10 meters. Wait, no. Because 1 pm is 1e-12 m, so 100 pm is 1e-10 m. Wait, no, wait, 100 pm is 100 * 1e-12, so that's 1e-10 m? No, wait, 100 * 1e-12 is 1e-10? Wait, 1e-12 * 100 is 1e-10? No, wait, 100 is 1e2, so 1e2 * 1e-12 is 1e-10. Yes, that's right. So λ = 1e-10 m.

Now plug into the equation. So E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1e-10 m). Let me calculate the numerator first. 6.626e-34 multiplied by 3e8 is 1.9878e-25. Then divide by 1e-10.

Wait, let me compute that. 1.9878e-25 divided by 1e-10. Oh, when you divide by 1e-10, it's the same as multiplying by 1e10. So 1.9878e-25 * 1e10 = 1.9878e-15 J. So approximately 2e-15 J? Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3 )e( -34 +8 )= 19.878e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then dividing by 1e-10 m gives 1.9878e-25 / 1e-10 = 1.9878e-15 J. So that's about 2e-15 J. But looking at the options, option E is 2e-15, and F is 1.5e-15.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me make sure I'm using the correct formula. Oh wait, the formula is E = hc/λ. Oh, that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as E = (hc)/(λ) where λ is in meters.

Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it written as E = (1240 eV·nm) / λ (in nm). Oh right, that's another approach. Let me try that method as a check.

Because 100 pm is 0.1 nm (since 1 nm is 1000 pm, so 100 pm is 0.1 nm). So converting, the wavelength is 0.1 nm.

So the energy in eV is (1240 eV·nm) / 0.1 nm = 12400 eV. Because 1240 /0.1 = 12400. So 12400 eV is 12.4 keV. But wait, the question is asking for joules. So converting eV to J: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 12400 eV = 12400 * 1.602e-19 J = let's compute that.

Wait, 12400 * 1.602e-19 = (12400 * 1.602) * 1e-19. 12400 * 1.602 is approximately 19876.8 (because 12400 *1.6 is 19840, plus 12400 *0.002 is about 24.8, so total around 19864.8). So 19864.8e-19 J. Which is 1.98648e-15 J. Approximately 2e-15 J, so option E is 2e-15, which would be correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 2e-15 J. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option E is 2e-15 J. But I'm getting around 2e-15. So that would be E. But wait, earlier when I did the first method, I got about 1.98e-15 J, which is approximately 2e-15, so E. But wait, the option E is 2e-15 and F is 1.5e-15. So according to this calculation, E is correct.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me redo. hc=6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 1e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1e-10 = 1.9878e-15 J. So about 2e-15 J. So option E is 2e-15 J, which would match.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, another approach: 100 pm is 100e-12 m = 1e-10 m. So E = hc/(lambda) = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(1e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1e-10) = 1.9878e-15 J. So about 2e-15 J.

But wait, the options are:

A:4e-15 

B:1.2e-15 

C:5e-15 

D:3.5e-15 

E:2e-15 

F:1.5e-15 

G:1e-15 

H: 0.5e-15 

I:3e-15 

J:2.5e-15 

So according to this, option E is correct, but wait, let me think again. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the arithmetic.

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Because 6.626 *3 = 19.878, and 1e-34 *1e8 is 1e-26, so 19.878e-26 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 1e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1e-10 = 1.9878e-15 J.

So the energy is about 2e-15 J. So the correct option is E: 2e-15 J. But wait, wait, looking at the options again. Option E is 2e-15, which matches, right?

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. I just remembered that 100 pm is 100 picometers. Oh wait, 1 pm is 1e-12 meters. So 100 pm is 100e-12 m, which is 1e-10 m. So that's correct.

But wait, another approach: let's compute using the second method, the eV way.

E (eV) = (1240 eV·nm) / wavelength (nm) )

Wavelength is 100 pm = 0.1 nm.

So 1240 /0.1 = 12400 eV, which is 12400 eV = 12.4 keV.

Convert eV to J: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 12400 eV = 12400 * 1.602e-19 J.

Calculating 12400 * 1.602e-19:

12400 is 1.24e4. 1.24e4 * 1.602e-19 = (1.24 * 1.602 )e^(4-19) = (1.987) * 1e-15 = 1.987e-15 J, approximately 2e-15 J. So again, option E.

So it seems correct.

So the correct answer is E: 2e-15 J.
</think>

To calculate the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 100 pm (100 picometers), we use the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength in meters.

### Step 1: Convert wavelength to meters
The wavelength is given as 100 pm. Since 1 pm = \( 10^{-12} \, \text{m} \), we have:
\[
\lambda = 100 \, \text{pm} = 100 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( hc \)
\[
hc = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3.00 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

### Step 3: Divide by \( \lambda \)
\[
E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.9878 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J}.
\]

This is approximately \( 2 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \).

### Step 4: Verify using the eV method
Alternatively, the energy can be calculated using:
\[
E = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV·nm}}{\lambda \, (\text{in nm})}.
\]
Since \( \lambda = 100 \, \text{pm} = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \):
\[
E = \frac{1240}{0.1} = 12400 \, \text{eV} = 12.4 \, \text{keV}.
\]
Converting to joules:
\[
12.4 \, \text{keV} = 12.4 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \approx 1.987 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Final Answer
Both methods yield \( E \approx 2 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \), so the correct option is:

**E: 2 × 10⁻¹⁵ J**
