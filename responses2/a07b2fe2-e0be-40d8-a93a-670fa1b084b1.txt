Alright, so I've got this integral problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about finding the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to 2π of cos²(nx + ξ_n) dx. The set E is a measurable subset of (0, 2π), and the measure of E is 2. Hmm, okay. 

First, I remember that integrating trigonometric functions can sometimes be simplified using identities. Cos²(theta) is equal to (1 + cos(2 theta))/2. Maybe I can use that identity to rewrite the integrand.

So, let's apply that identity to cos²(nx + ξ_n). That would give me:

cos²(nx + ξ_n) = [1 + cos(2(nx + ξ_n))]/2.

So the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 2π of [1 + cos(2(nx + ξ_n))]/2 dx. Let me split that into two separate integrals:

(1/2) ∫₀²π 1 dx + (1/2) ∫₀²π cos(2(nx + ξ_n)) dx.

The first integral is straightforward. It's (1/2) times the integral of 1 from 0 to 2π, which is just (1/2)*(2π) = π.

The second integral is (1/2) times the integral of cos(2(nx + ξ_n)) dx from 0 to 2π. Now, I recall that the integral of cos(kx + c) over a full period is zero, because the cosine function is periodic and oscillates equally above and below the x-axis. 

But wait, in this case, the argument is 2(nx + ξ_n). Let's see, the integral is over 0 to 2π, but the variable inside is (nx + ξ_n). So, let's make a substitution to check. Let u = nx + ξ_n. Then du = n dx, so dx = du/n. When x = 0, u = ξ_n, and when x = 2π, u = 2πn + ξ_n. So the integral becomes (1/2) times (1/n) ∫_{ξ_n}^{2πn + ξ_n} cos(u) du.

The integral of cos(u) is sin(u), so evaluating from ξ_n to 2πn + ξ_n gives sin(2πn + ξ_n) - sin(ξ_n). But sin(2πn + ξ_n) is just sin(ξ_n) because sine has a period of 2π. So sin(2πn + ξ_n) = sin(ξ_n). Therefore, the integral is sin(ξ_n) - sin(ξ_n) = 0. 

So the second integral is zero. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to π + 0 = π. 

Wait, but hold on. The original integral is over E, which is a subset of (0,2π) with measure 2. But in my computation, I integrated over 0 to 2π, not over E. That could be a problem because E might not be the full interval. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. 

Wait, no, wait. The set E has measure 2, which is the same as the interval (0, 2π) because 2π is approximately 6.283, so 2 is less than that. So the measure of E is 2, but the integral over E is from 0 to 2π, but E only covers 2 units of that interval. Hmm, does that affect the result? 

Wait, actually, in my calculation, I integrated over 0 to 2π, but E is a subset of that interval. But since the integrand is periodic with period 2π, maybe the integral over E can be related to the integral over the full period. Let me think about that.

The integral over E of cos²(nx + ξ_n) dx. Since the function is periodic, when you integrate over a single period, it's the same as integrating over any other interval of length 2π. So, whether E is the full interval or a subset, as long as it's a measure 2 subset of 0 to 2π, the integral over E would be the same as the integral over the full period, divided by the measure of the full period. Wait, no, that's not exactly accurate. Let me think again.

Wait, the integral over E is a function of E's measure, which is 2. But the function cos²(nx + ξ_n) is periodic with period 2π, so when you integrate over any interval of length 2π, it's the same. So, the integral over E would be equal to (measure of E / measure of full period) times the integral over a full period. But wait, the measure of E is 2, and the full period is 2π. So, the integral over E would be (2/(2π)) times the integral over 0 to 2π. 

Wait, but in my previous calculation, I integrated over 0 to 2π, and got π. So, if I do that, the integral over E would be (2/(2π)) * π = 1. But wait, that's not correct because I already did the integral over the full period, which gave me π. But E has measure 2. Wait, no, the integral over a single period is π, so if E is a subset of length 2, then the integral over E would be (2/(2π)) * π = 1. But that doesn't make sense because the integral over E would be the average value times the measure. The average value of cos² is 1/2, so the integral over E would be (1/2) * 2 = 1. So that's another way to get the same result.

But wait, in my initial approach, I integrated over 0 to 2π, which is the full period, and got π. But if E has measure 2, which is less than 2π, then the integral over E would be (2/(2π)) * π = 1. So the answer would be 1. But then, wait, let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, in the problem statement, the integral is over E, which has measure 2, but E is a subset of (0, 2π). So, I should have considered that the integral over E could be represented as (measure of E)/(2π) times the integral over 0 to 2π. Because the function is periodic, so integrating over E would give (measure of E) / (length of the period) times the integral over one period.

So, the integral over E would be (2 / (2π)) * π = (1/π) * π * 1 = 1. So the limit as n approaches infinity is 1.

Wait, but earlier, when I just integrated over 0 to 2π, I got π. But that would be the integral over the full period, not over E. So maybe I made a mistake earlier when I considered the integral over E as (measure of E)/(2π) times integral over 0 to 2π. So in that case, yes, it's 1. But wait, in my initial calculation, I thought the integral over 0 to 2π is π, but when E is a subset, maybe I should compute the integral over E, which is 1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me go back. The integral over E is ∫₀²π I_E(x) cos²(nx + ξ_n) dx, where I_E is the indicator function of E. Since E has measure 2, and the integral over any interval of length 2π is π (as computed earlier), then the integral over E would be 2/(2π) * π = 1. So the answer should be 1. But let me check what the options are. The options are A: sqrt(2)/2, B:0, C: π, D:1.5, E:1, F:3, G:2, H:2.5, I:0.5, J: π/2. So option E is 1. So maybe the answer is E:1.

But wait, earlier I thought that when I integrated over the full period, I got π, but perhaps that's not the case because E is a subset. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in that initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, when I wrote cos²(theta) as (1 + cos(2 theta))/2, that's correct. So ∫₀²π cos²(nx + ξ_n) dx = ∫₀²π [1 + cos(2(nx + ξ_n))] / 2 dx. That's correct. Then, split into two integrals: 1/2 ∫₀²π 1 dx + 1/2 ∫₀²π cos(2(nx + ξ_n)) dx.

The first integral is (1/2)(2π) = π. The second integral is 1/2 ∫₀²π cos(2(nx + ξ_n)) dx. Let me compute this.

Let me make a substitution: u = 2(nx + ξ_n). Then, du = 2n dx, so dx = du/(2n). When x = 0, u = 2ξ_n. When x = 2π, u = 2n*2π + 2ξ_n = 4πn + 2ξ_n.

So the integral becomes 1/2 ∫_{2ξ_n}^{4πn + 2ξ_n} cos(u) * (du/(2n)).

The integral of cos(u) is sin(u), so it's 1/(4n) [sin(4πn + 2ξ_n) - sin(2ξ_n)].

But sin(4πn + 2ξ_n) = sin(2ξ_n) because sin is 2π periodic. So sin(4πn + 2ξ_n) - sin(2ξ_n) = 0. Therefore, the second integral is zero. So the total integral is π + 0 = π.

Wait, so that's the integral over 0 to 2π. But E has measure 2, which is a subset of (0,2π). So is the integral over E equal to (measure of E)/(2π) times the integral over 0 to 2π? Because the function is periodic with period 2π, so integrating over any interval of length 2π would give the same result. Therefore, the integral over E would be (2/(2π)) * π = 1.

But wait, that can't be right because the integral over E is 1, but when I compute it as ∫₀²π I_E(x) cos²(nx + ξ_n) dx, it depends on where E is located. Wait, but actually, E is any measurable set with measure 2, so the integral over E would be the same as integrating over the full period and then scaling by the measure of E divided by the measure of the full period.

Wait, maybe. Let me think. The average value of cos²(nx + ξ_n) is 1/2, so the integral over any interval of length L is (L/(2π)) * π = L/2. But wait, no, that's not correct because the average value times L would be (1/2)*L. So in this case, L is 2, so the integral would be (1/2)*2 = 1.

So the answer is 1, which is option E. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that integrating over the full period gives π, but that's wrong because I was only integrating over the full period, not over E. So the integral over E is 1, regardless of where E is located as long as it has measure 2.

Wait, let me make sure. The integral over the entire period is π, so if I have a subset E of measure 2, then the integral over E would be (2/(2π)) * π = 1. So yes, that's correct. So the limit as n approaches infinity is 1.

Wait a second, but the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity. Does that affect the result? Because when I computed the integral, it's independent of n because the integral over the full period is π, and the measure of E is 2, so the integral over E is (2/(2π)) * π = 1. So whether n is large or not, it doesn't matter because the integral over the full period is π, so the integral over E is 1. So the limit is 1.

But wait, I'm a bit concerned because I thought earlier that the integral over the full period is π, but if I integrate over a subset of measure 2, the integral over E would be 1. So I think that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is E:1.

The problem involves finding the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral of cos²(nx + ξₙ) over a set E with measure 2. Using trigonometric identities and periodicity, the integral simplifies to π over the full period, but since E has measure 2, the integral over E is (2/(2π)) * π = 1. Thus, the limit is 1.
