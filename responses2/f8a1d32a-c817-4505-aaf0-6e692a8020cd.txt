Question:

A 35-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3-day history of severe right back pain. She has not had any fever, chills, or weight loss. She has no history of major medical illness. Musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. When told that her examination is normal, the patient becomes tearful and demands an MRI of her back because her mother just died from breast cancer metastatic to bone and she fears that she may also have cancer. The patient already contacted her insurance company, who told her that if she has neurologic abnormalities an MRI may be covered by her plan. The patient asks the physician to order the MRI indicating that she has neurologic findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?

Options:

A: Advise the patient to change insurance companies as soon as she is able so that she can receive more comprehensive medical care
B: Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings
C: Immediately inform the patient's insurance company about what the patient has asked the physician to do
D: Order the MRI as the patient requests

Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the patient is a 35-year-old woman with severe right back pain. She's had no fever, chills, or weight loss, and she hasn't had any major illnesses. Her back exam shows no abnormalities, which is good. But she's tearsy and because her mother died from breast cancer, she fears cancer. So, she asks for an MRI because her insurance plan might cover it if there are neurologic issues. 

Hmm, the question is about what the physician should do next. The options are A through J, but I need to pick the best one.

The patient had a normal exam, and she's torn. She wants an MRI because her insurance would cover it if there are abnormalities. So, the next step is probably to let her know she's asking for that, but without overstepping. 

Looking at the options:

A: Advise to change insurance companies. That sounds extreme. They might be concerned about the patient's privacy or concerns about getting more medical care. But the patient's insurance company told her it's okay, so maybe they don't need to change anything. 

B: Explain the MRI isn't appropriate. But the patient is asking for it, so this isn't correct. She's not asking to exclude it; she's requesting it.

C: Immediately inform the insurance. That's maybe overstepping because they didn't ask for that. It's better to wait until she decides before informing.

D: Order the MRI. That makes sense. The patient is making the request, so the physician should proceed with the MRI as directed.

So the correct answer should be D. The physician should order the MRI as per the patient's request.

The correct answer is D: Order the MRI as the patient requests. The physician should proceed with the MRI as directed.
