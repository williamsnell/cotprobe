Okay, let's see. I have this math problem here. It says that eighty-five more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is 17 less than the number. Hmm, I need to find the number from the given options.

Alright, let me break it down. Let's denote the number as 'x'. So, the problem is saying that 85 plus x squared equals (x minus 17) squared. So, the equation would be 85 + x² = (x - 17)². 

Wait, let me write that down: 

85 + x² = (x - 17)²

Now, I'll expand the right side. (x - 17) squared is x² - 34x + 289. So the equation becomes:

85 + x² = x² - 34x + 289.

Hmm, if I subtract x² from both sides, they cancel out. So that leaves 85 = -34x + 289.

Let me rearrange that. 85 - 289 = -34x. Calculating 85 minus 289, I get -204. So -204 = -34x.

Dividing both sides by -34, I get x = (-204)/(-34). The negatives cancel, so 204 divided by 34. Let me calculate that. 34 times 6 is 204, so x = 6.

Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. Let me plug x=6 back into the original equation.

Left side: 85 + (6)^2 = 85 + 36 = 121.

Right side: (6 - 17)^2 = (-11)^2 = 121.

Yes, both sides are equal. So the number is 6, which is option J.
