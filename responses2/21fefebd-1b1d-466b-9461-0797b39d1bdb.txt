Question:

A researcher interested in examining the potential impact of parent alcoholism on child and family development recruits 12-year-olds (n = 100), 13-year-olds (n = 100), and 14-year-olds (n = 100)—half of whom have an alcoholic parent and half of whom do not—into a multiple-year longitudinal study assessing various outcomes. This study is best characterized as:

Options:

A: A cross-sectional design
B: A correlational study
C: A pretest-posttest design
D: A cross-sequential cohort design
E: A quasi-experiment
F: A natural experiment
G: A cross-sectional cohort design
H: A true experiment
I: A case-control study
J: A longitudinal cohort design

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of study this is. Let me read the question again.

A researcher is looking at the impact of parent alcoholism on child and family development. They're recruiting 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, and 14-year-olds—half from each age group—and half of these kids have an alcoholic parent. So they're doing a multiple-year study assessing various outcomes.

Hmm, the options are multiple choices, so let's go through each one.

Cross-sectional design: That's when they take a snapshot at a certain point in time. But here, it's a longitudinal study, so that's not it.

Correlational study: That measures associations between variables. The question is about cause and effect, so no, not correlational.

Pretest-posttest design: Like a single group measured before and after. The study is across multiple years, so probably not.

Cross-sequential cohort design: I'm not sure what that means. Cohorts are groups of people born at the same time. Cross-sequential could mean looking at how a group changes over time. But I'm not too sure about the term.

Cross-sectional cohort design: That's similar to cross-sectional but applied to a group. So here, the study isn't just a cross-section but looking at children in different age groups over time. So maybe not.

Quasi-experiment: That's when you have a control and treatment group, but the design isn't random, but it's more about treatment groups. Not sure if this fits.

Natural experiment: That's when you manipulate variables in a natural setting, but the study here is observational. So no.

Longitudinal cohort design: That's when you have a group of people, and you follow them over time. The children are part of a cohort, and the study is tracking them over multiple years. That fits. So the study is looking at how children's outcomes change as they get older, with the variable being whether their parents are alcoholic.

So the best characterization is a longitudinal cohort design. Looking at the options, J is "A longitudinal cohort design." Wait, but I thought of another option, D: "A cross-sequential cohort design." Wait, what's the difference between A and D?

Cross-sectional cohort: Maybe that's not the right term. I think longitudinal cohort is more accurate because it's about tracking over time. Cross-sequential might imply looking at different groups across time, but perhaps not the best fit here.

Wait, the options: J is "A longitudinal cohort design" and D is "A cross-sequential cohort design." Hmm. Let me make sure. The term "cohort" in longitudinal studies is standard. So it's more precise. So the correct answer should be J.

The study is examining the impact of parent alcoholism on child and family development over multiple years. It involves a group of children across three age groups (12, 13, and 14) with varying backgrounds regarding parent alcoholism. The study is longitudinal, tracking children over time, and involves multiple age groups, which suggests it is a longitudinal cohort study. It is not a cross-sectional design, correlational study, pretest-posttest, or a case-control study. While "cohort" is a term that fits, the more precise term for this study is "longitudinal cohort design."

Answer: J: A longitudinal cohort design
