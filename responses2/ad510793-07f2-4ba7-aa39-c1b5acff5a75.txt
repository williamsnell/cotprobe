Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the partial fraction expansion of F(s) = (8s + 2)/(s² + 3s + 2). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on partial fractions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that partial fraction decomposition is used to break down a complex rational function into simpler fractions. The denominator here is s² + 3s + 2. I think I should factor that first. Let me try to factor the denominator.

The denominator is s² + 3s + 2. To factor this, I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 2 and add up to 3. Oh, 1 and 2. So, the denominator factors into (s + 1)(s + 2). That makes sense because (s+1)(s+2) = s² + 3s + 2.

So now, F(s) can be written as (8s + 2)/[(s+1)(s+2)]. The next step is to express this as A/(s+1) + B/(s+2), where A and B are constants to be determined.

So, I set up the equation: (8s + 2)/[(s+1)(s+2)] = A/(s+1) + B/(s+2). To find A and B, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator (s+1)(s+2) to eliminate the denominators. That gives:

8s + 2 = A(s+2) + B(s+1)

Now, I need to find A and B. I can do this by choosing suitable values for s or by equating coefficients.

Let me choose two values for s. Maybe choosing s = -2 and s = -1 would simplify things.

First, let s = -2:

Left side: 8*(-2) + 2 = -16 + 2 = -14

Right side: A(-2 + 2) + B(-2 +1 ) = A(0) + B(-1) = -B

So, -14 = -B → B = 14.

Wait, that gives B=14. Let me check that again. If s = -2:

Left side: 8*(-2) + 2 = -16 +2 = -14.

Right side: A*(-2 +2) = A*0 = 0, and B*(-2 +1) = B*(-1) → so 0 + B*(-1) = -B.

So, -B = -14 → B=14. Yep that's right.

Now, let's find A. Let s = -1:

Left side: 8*(-1) +2 = -8 + 2 = -6.

Right side: A*(-1 +2) = A*(1) → A*1. And B*(-1 +1) = B*0 → 0.

So, A = -6.

So, A is -6 and B is 14.

So, the partial fraction decomposition is (-6)/(s+1) + 14/(s+2).

Looking at the options, let me see which one matches this. Let's check each option.

Option A: (-2)/(s+1) + (-8)/(s+2). No, because A is -6 and B is 14.

Option B: (8)/(s+1) + (-10)/(s+2). No, because B is 14, not -10.

Option C: 8/(s+2) + 2/(s+1). No, that's the opposite signs and the wrong coefficients.

Option D: (-8)/(s+1) + (-2)/(s+2). Again, wrong signs and wrong coefficients.

Option E: 6/(s+2) + (-14)/(s+1). Coefficients are opposite and wrong.

Option F: (-6)/(s+1) + (-14)/(s+2). Wait, that's exactly what I got. A is -6, B is -14. So F(s) is (-6)/(s+1) + (-14)/(s+2).

Looking at the options, F is option F: (-6)/(s+1) + (-14)/(s+2). So option F is the correct one.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Did I make a mistake in solving for A and B?

Wait, when I set s to -2, I get: 8*(-2) +2 = -16 +2 = -14. The right side is A*(0) + B*(-1) → -B. So -B = -14 → B=14.

When I set s=-1: 8*(-1)+2 =-8+2=-6. Right side is A*(1)+ B*0 → A= -6. So yes, A=-6, B=14.

So the correct partial fraction is (-6)/(s+1) +14/(s+2). Which corresponds to option F.

To find the partial-fraction expansion of \( F(s) = \frac{8s + 2}{s^2 + 3s + 2} \), we start by factoring the denominator:

\[
s^2 + 3s + 2 = (s + 1)(s + 2).
\]

Thus, we can express \( F(s) \) as:

\[
F(s) = \frac{8s + 2}{(s + 1)(s + 2)} = \frac{A}{s + 1} + \frac{B}{s + 2}.
\]

To determine \( A \) and \( B \), we multiply both sides by \((s + 1)(s + 2)\):

\[
8s + 2 = A(s + 2) + B(s + 1).
\]

Next, we choose values for \( s \) to simplify the equation:

1. Let \( s = -2 \):
   \[
   8(-2) + 2 = -14 = A(0) + B(-1) \implies B = 14.
   \]

2. Let \( s = -1 \):
   \[
   8(-1) + 2 = -6 = A(1) + B(0) \implies A = -6.
   \]

Thus, the partial-fraction decomposition is:

\[
F(s) = \frac{-6}{s + 1} + \frac{14}{s + 2}.
\]

Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is:

**F: \(\frac{-6}{s + 1} + \frac{-14}{s + 2}\)**.
