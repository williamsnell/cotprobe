Okay, so I have this physics question about the mean translational kinetic energy of a mole of ideal gas at room temperature. Hmm, I remember that the kinetic theory of gases has something to do with this. Let me think back. 

I think the formula involves the temperature and the number of moles. Oh wait, there's a specific equation I remember. The mean translational kinetic energy per mole is (3/2)RT, right? Because each particle contributes three degrees of freedom (x, y, z), so 3/2 nR T. 

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The formula is (3/2) k T per molecule, where k is Boltzmann's constant. And since a mole has Avogadro's number of molecules, which is N_A. So for one mole, the energy would be (3/2) N_A k T. But another approach: using R (gas constant) instead. Because R is related to k. Oh right, R is equal to N_A k. So substituting, (3/2) R T. 

So the formula simplifies to (3/2) R T. Right. So let's plug in the numbers. The temperature T is 293 K. R is the gas constant, which I think is 8.314 J/(mol·K). 

So calculating it: 3/2 times 8.314 times 293. Let me compute that step by step. 

First, 8.314 multiplied by 293. Let's see, 8 * 293 = 2344, 0.314 * 293. 0.3 * 293 is 87.9, 0.014 * 293 is about 4.102. So 87.9 +4.102 = 92.002. So 2344 +92.002= 2436.002. Now multiply by 3/2. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, 8.314 * 293 = 2436.002? Or wait, no, wait: 8.314 * 293. Let me compute that directly.

Wait, 8.314 * 293. Let me break it down. 8 * 293 = 2344. 0.3 * 293 = 87.9. 0.014 * 293 = 4.102. So adding all together: 2344 + 87.9 = 2431.9, plus 4.102 is 2436.002. So 8.314 * 293 = 2436.002 J/(mol).

Wait, no, because R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), so when multiplied by T (K), the units are J/mol. So 8.314 * 293 = approx 2436 J/mol. Then multiply by (3/2): 2436 *1.5 = Let's compute that. 2436 * 1 is 2436, 2436 *0.5=1218. So 2436 + 1218 = 3654. Oh wait, but wait, no. Wait, 2436 *1.5 is 2436 * 3/2. So 2436 * 1.5 = (2436 * 3)/2. 2436 *3 is 7308. Divided by 2 is 3654. So 3654 J/mol.

Wait, but the options are A:7500, B:2900, etc. Hmm, but wait, 3654 is close to option I: 3650. But wait, I'm getting 3654, but let me double-check the calculation. Because maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait another approach: using the formula (3/2) R T. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), T is 293 K.

So 8.314 * 293 = Let me compute this more accurately. 8.314 * 293.

Let me compute 8 * 293 = 2344.

0.314 * 293: Let's break this down.

0.3 * 293 = 87.9.

0.014 * 293 = 4.102.

So 87.9 +4.102 = 92.002.

So 2344 +92.002=2436.002.

Then multiply by 3/2: 2436.002 * 1.5.

Let me compute 2436 *1.5. 

2436 *1 = 2436.

2436 *0.5 = 1218.

So 2436 +1218= 3654.

So 3654 J/mol. Looking at the options, option I is 3650.0, which is very close. But wait, I'm getting 3654, which is 4 more than 3650. So where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me check 8.314 * 293 again.

Alternative way: 8 * 293 = 2344.

0.314 * 293 = (0.3 * 293) + (0.014 * 293) = 87.9 +4.102 = 92.002.

So 2344 +92.002 = 2436.002. Correct.

So 3/2 * 2436.002 = 3654.003 J/mol.

Wait, but the options are all in whole numbers. So perhaps the correct option is 3654, but the closest given is option I, which is 3650.0. Hmm, but why is that? Or maybe I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait another thought: sometimes the translational kinetic energy in a mole is (3/2) R T, but is it per mole or per molecule? Oh wait, no, because when you have a mole, it's per mole. So 3/2 R T per mole is the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the value of R. Oh, wait, R is supposed to be 8.314 J/(mol·K), correct. So 8.314 *293 = 2436.002 J/mol. Multiply by 3/2, gives 3654 J/mol.

Looking back at the options, option I is 3650.0, which is very close. So that's probably the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps the options have an approximation, so the correct answer is I:3650.0 J/mol.

To compute the mean translational kinetic energy of a mole of ideal gas at room temperature (293 K), the formula used is:

\[
\text{Mean translational kinetic energy} = \frac{3}{2} R T
\]

where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \) is the gas constant, and \( T = 293 \, \text{K} \) is the temperature. Substituting the values:

1. Calculate \( R \times T \):
   \[
   8.314 \times 293 = 2436.002 \, \text{J/mol}
   \]

2. Multiply by \( \frac{3}{2} \):
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} \times 2436.002 = 3654.003 \, \text{J/mol}
   \]

The closest option to this value is **3650.0 J/mol**, which corresponds to option **I**. While there is a small discrepancy (4 J/mol), this is likely due to rounding or approximation in the provided options.
