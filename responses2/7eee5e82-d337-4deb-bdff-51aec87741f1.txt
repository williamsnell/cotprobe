Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating P(H|E, F) and determining which set of numbers is sufficient. 

Hmm, I remember that conditional probabilities can be tricky. The formula for P(H|E,F) is P(H, E, F) divided by P(E, F). So, without any additional information about independence, I need to know the joint probabilities or at least the necessary components to compute this.

Let me think about the possible options. The options are A through J, each listing different combinations of probabilities. The question says we have no conditional independence info, so we can't assume any of the dependencies.

Option A: P(E,F), P(H|E), P(F|H). Let me see. P(H|E,F) = P(H,E,F) / P(E,F). If I have P(H|E,F), that's the same as P(E, F, H) / P(E,F). But I don't have P(H|E,F) here. Wait, option A gives P(H|E) and P(F|H). So, maybe I can compute P(E, F, H) as P(H|E,F) * P(E,F), but I don't have P(H|E,F). Hmm, not sure if this is enough.

Option B: P(E,F), P(E|H), P(F|H). So, let's break it down. If I have P(E,F), that's the joint probability. I also have P(E|H) and P(F|H). So, P(E|H) is P(E,H)/P(H), and P(F|H) is P(F,H)/P(H). But how does that help me get P(H|E,F)?

Hmm. Maybe if I can find P(E,F,H), which would be P(H|E,F) * P(E,F). But right now, I don't have any information about P(E,F,H). So I'm stuck. So option B might not be sufficient.

Option C: P(E,F), P(H|E,F), P(E|H). So, this seems promising. Because P(H|E,F) is exactly what I need for the numerator. And I have P(E,F) as the joint. But I also have P(E|H), which is the probability of E given H. Wait, can I use that to find other terms?

Wait, let me think again. If I have P(H|E,F), that's P(E,F,H) over P(E,F). But I don't have that. So, I don't think I can find P(E,F,H) from the given information. So maybe option C is not sufficient.

Option D: P(H), P(E,F), P(E|H). So, P(H) is the probability of H. P(E,F) is the joint. And P(E|H) is the probability of E given H. But I don't have any information about the joint involving F and H. I don't think this gives me enough. So probably not D.

Option E: P(E,F), P(H), P(E|H), P(F|H). Okay, let's see. So, I have P(E,F) which is the joint, P(H) is the probability of H. P(E|H) is P(E,H)/P(H), and P(F|H) is P(F,H)/P(H). So, from these, can I compute P(E,F,H)?

Wait, P(E|H) is P(E,H)/P(H). So, P(E,H) = P(E|H)*P(H) = P(E,F,H)/P(F|E,H) ? Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently. If I have P(E|H), that's P(E, H)/P(H). Let me rearrange that: P(E, H) = P(E|H) * P(H). Similarly, P(F|H) is P(F, H)/P(H) → P(F, H) = P(F|H) * P(H). 

But how does that help me find P(E,F,H)? Because P(E,F,H) is the probability of E, F, and H. But I don't have any info about that. Without knowing the joint involving H, E, and F, I can't compute P(E,F,H). So option E doesn't give me what I need because I don't know P(E,F,H). So E is not sufficient.

Wait, but perhaps not. Because if I have P(E,F) which is the joint of E and F, but not involving H. So I don't have information about E and F together with H. So I can't compute P(E,F,H). So I don't have P(H|E,F). 

So option E is not sufficient.

Option F: P(E,F), P(H|F), P(E|H). So, I have P(E,F), which is the joint of E and F. I have P(H|F), which is P(H,F)/P(F). And P(E|H), which is P(E,H)/P(H). Do I have enough to compute P(H|E,F)?

Hmm. Let's try to see. P(H|E,F) is P(E,F,H)/P(E,F). I don't know P(E,F,H) yet. So to get P(H|E,F), I need the joint of E,F,H divided by P(E,F). But I don't have this value.

But wait, I have P(H|F) which is P(H,F)/P(F). And I have P(E|H) which is P(E,H)/P(H). Let me see if I can find P(E,F,H) from these.

Wait, P(E,F,H) can be written as P(H|E,F) * P(E,F). But I don't have P(H|E,F). Alternatively, perhaps I can express it in terms of other probabilities.

Wait, P(E,F,H) is also equal to P(E|F) * P(F) * P(H|E,F) → not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find P(E,F,H) as P(E|H) * P(F|H) * P(H). But wait, that's not correct because H is involved.

Alternatively, maybe I can find it using inclusion-exclusion or something else. Not sure. Let me think differently.

Let me consider all the probabilities I have:

1. P(E,F) → from E and F.
2. P(H|F) → P(H,F)/P(F) → so P(H,F) = P(H|F)*P(F)
3. P(E|H) → P(E,H)/P(H) → so P(E,H) = P(E|H) * P(H)

So, if I have P(H|F) and P(E|H), perhaps I can find P(E, F, H) as the product of P(E|H), P(F|H), and P(H). But wait, P(F|H) is P(F,H)/P(H) → P(F,H) = P(F|H)*P(H). So P(E,F,H) = P(E|H) * P(F|H) * P(H) → because P(E|H) is P(E,H)/P(H) → P(E,H) = P(E|H)*P(H). And P(F|H) is P(F,H)/P(H) → P(F,H) = P(F|H)*P(H). So multiplying them gives P(E|H) * P(F|H) * P(H)^2 → but wait, that's not the same as P(E,F,H), because P(E,F,H) = P(E|F) P(F|H) P(H), but I don't have P(E|F). Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps I can express P(E,F,H) as P(E,F) * P(H|E,F). So P(E,F) is given, and if I can find P(H|E,F), which is what I need. But I don't have that. So, unless I can find another way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the law of total probability or something else. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can express P(E,F,H) as P(E,F) * P(H|E,F) → but without that, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the necessary terms using the given probabilities.

Wait, another thought. If I have P(E,F), P(H|F), and P(E|H), can I find P(E,F,H)?

Hmm, P(E,F,H) = P(E|F) * P(F|H) * P(H) → no, because that would require knowing P(E|F) which I don't have. Alternatively, perhaps I can express P(E,F,H) as the product of P(E,F) and P(H|E,F), but I don't have P(H|E,F).

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe option F isn't sufficient. Let me think about the other options.

Option G: P(H), P(E,F|H), P(E|F). Hmm, P(E,F|H) is the probability of E and F given H. So, P(E,F|H) = P(E,F,H)/P(H). So, P(E,F,H) = P(E,F|H) * P(H). 

Additionally, P(E|F) is P(E,F)/P(F). So, I can get P(E,F) from P(E|F) and P(F). But I don't have P(F) given here. Wait, but option G includes P(E,F|H), which is P(E,F,H)/P(H). And P(E,F|H) * P(H) = P(E,F,H). Also, P(E,F) is the joint, which is given in option G's first term.

Wait, but how do I get P(H|E,F) from this?

P(H|E,F) = P(E,F,H) / P(E,F). But I have P(E,F,H) as P(E,F|H) * P(H). So, substituting:

P(H|E,F) = [P(E,F|H) * P(H)] / P(E,F) 

So, that's [P(E,F|H) * P(H)] divided by P(E,F). But I don't have P(E,F), which is the denominator. Wait, but do I have P(E,F) from somewhere else?

Wait, P(E,F) is given as one of the terms in option G. So, perhaps I can compute this.

So, in option G: P(H) is given, P(E,F|H) is given, and P(E,F) is given. So, substituting into the formula:

P(H|E,F) = [P(E,F|H) * P(H)] / P(E,F)

Which is a formula that uses all three terms in G. So, if I have all three, I can compute P(H|E,F). Therefore, option G provides all the necessary numbers to compute P(H|E,F).

Wait, but wait! Because P(E,F|H) is P(E,F,H)/P(H) → so P(E,F,H) = P(E,F|H) * P(H). But how does that help me compute P(E,F,H) without knowing P(H|E,F)?

Ah, but I don't have P(H|E,F). So, without it, I can't compute P(E,F,H). But, as I wrote earlier, P(H|E,F) = [P(E,F|H) * P(H)] / P(E,F). So, if I have all three terms in G, I can compute P(H|E,F).

Wait, but in option G, I have P(H), P(E,F|H), and P(E,F). So, P(E,F) is given as part of G's terms. So, yes, all three terms are available to compute P(H|E,F) as [P(E,F|H) * P(H)] / P(E,F). So, that's sufficient.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought we needed P(E,F,H) for P(H|E,F), but option G gives us all the necessary components. So, option G would be sufficient.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option F: P(E,F), P(H|F), P(E|H). So, we have P(E,F), which is the joint. P(H|F) is P(H,F)/P(F), so P(H,F) = P(H|F) * P(F). And P(E|H) is P(E,H)/P(H), so P(E,H) = P(E|H) * P(H). 

Wait, but I don't have P(F) or P(H). So, how can I compute P(H|E,F)?

Hmmm. Because I have P(E,F) which is the joint, but I don't have P(F|E) or any other term that can let me compute P(H|E,F). So I don't think option F is sufficient.

So I'm back to option G. So, in option G: P(H) is given, P(E,F|H) is given, and P(E,F) is given. So, using the formula, we can compute P(H|E,F) = [P(E,F|H) * P(H)] / P(E,F). So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because P(E,F|H) is P(E,F,H)/P(H). So, P(E,F,H) = P(E,F|H)*P(H). Then, P(H|E,F) = [P(E,F,H)] / P(E,F) = [P(E,F|H) * P(H)] / P(E,F). So, yes, that's correct. So, all three terms are needed for this.

So, option G has exactly the three terms needed. Therefore, the answer should be G.

To calculate \( P(H|E, F) \), we use the formula:

\[
P(H|E, F) = \frac{P(E, F, H)}{P(E, F)}
\]

We need to determine if the given sets of numbers are sufficient to compute this. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: \( P(E, F) \), \( P(H|E) \), \( P(F|H) \):  
  \( P(H|E) \) and \( P(F|H) \) are not directly useful for computing \( P(E, F, H) \). Without additional information, this set is insufficient.

- **Option B**: \( P(E, F) \), \( P(E|H) \), \( P(F|H) \):  
  \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(F|H) \) give us \( P(E, H) \) and \( P(F, H) \), but not \( P(E, F, H) \). This set is insufficient.

- **Option C**: \( P(E, F) \), \( P(H|E, F) \), \( P(E|H) \):  
  \( P(H|E, F) \) is needed, but it is exactly what we need to compute \( P(H|E, F) \). However, we don't have \( P(E, F, H) \), so this set is insufficient.

- **Option D**: \( P(H) \), \( P(E, F) \), \( P(E|H) \):  
  \( P(E|H) \) gives \( P(E, H) \), but we need \( P(E, F, H) \) and \( P(H) \) to compute \( P(H|E, F) \). This set is insufficient.

- **Option E**: \( P(E, F) \), \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), \( P(F|H) \):  
  \( P(E, F) \) and \( P(H) \) give \( P(E, F, H) \) indirectly, but \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(F|H) \) are not directly helpful for computing \( P(H|E, F) \). This set is insufficient.

- **Option F**: \( P(E, F) \), \( P(H|F) \), \( P(E|H) \):  
  \( P(H|F) \) gives \( P(H, F) \), and \( P(E|H) \) gives \( P(E, H) \). However, without \( P(E, F, H) \), we cannot compute \( P(H|E, F) \). This set is insufficient.

- **Option G**: \( P(H) \), \( P(E, F|H) \), \( P(E, F) \):  
  \( P(E, F|H) \) gives \( P(E, F, H) \), and \( P(E, F) \) is the joint probability. Using the formula:

  \[
  P(H|E, F) = \frac{P(E, F, H)}{P(E, F)} = \frac{P(E, F|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E, F)}
  \]

  all three terms are sufficient to compute \( P(H|E, F) \).

- **Option H**: \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), \( P(F|H) \):  
  \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(F|H) \) give \( P(E, H) \) and \( P(F, H) \), but without \( P(E, F, H) \), we cannot compute \( P(H|E, F) \). This set is insufficient.

- **Option I**: \( P(E, F) \), \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), \( P(F|H) \):  
  \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(F|H) \) provide \( P(E, H) \) and \( P(F, H) \), but without \( P(E, F, H) \), we cannot compute \( P(H|E, F) \). This set is insufficient.

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **G**, as it provides all the necessary components to compute \( P(H|E, F) \).
