Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the number of lamps needed to achieve a certain illuminance in a room. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says: We need to find out how many 300-lumen lamps are required to get an average illuminance of 50 lux on a 4m by 3m rectangular room. The options are from A to J, with numbers 1 to 10.

Hmm, I remember that illuminance (E) is calculated by dividing the total luminous flux (which is the number of lumens multiplied by the number of lamps) by the area of the room. So, the formula should be E = (L * N) / A, where L is the luminous flux per lamp, N is the number of lamps, and A is the area.

Wait, let me make sure. Yes, illuminance is the total flux divided by the area. So rearranging the formula to solve for N (number of lamps), we get N = (E * A) / L. 

So, plugging in the numbers. E is 50 lux, A is the area of the room. Let's calculate the area first. The room is 4m by 3m, so area A = 4 * 3 = 12 m².

Each lamp has 300 lumens. So, N = (50 * 12) / 300. Let me compute that. 50 *12 is 600. 600 divided by 300 is 2. So N=2.

Wait, but that's option C. But let me think again. Did I use the right formula? Because sometimes I get confused between illuminance and luminous intensity or something else. Oh, wait, no, in this case, the lamps are point sources, so the formula should be correct.

Wait another thing, the question is about average illuminance. I think that's the same as total illuminance, so the formula applies.

Hmm, but let me verify. For a single lamp, the illuminance on a surface would be (flux from lamp) / area (assuming the lamp is a point source). So for each lamp, the illuminance E per lamp would be (L)/(A), where A is the area. So, each lamp contributes 300 / 12 = 25 lux. So two lamps would give 50, which matches the requirement.

So yes, 2 lamps, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing, sometimes I've seen problems where they calculate using the base area without considering the shape of the room, but in this case, the problem specifies a rectangular room, so the area calculation is straightforward.

So the answer should be 2, which is option C.

To determine the number of 300-lumen lamps required to achieve an average illuminance of 50 lux on a 4m × 3m rectangular room:

1. **Calculate the room's area**: The area \( A \) is \( 4 \, \text{m} \times 3 \, \text{m} = 12 \, \text{m}^2 \).

2. **Use the illuminance formula**: The formula for illuminance \( E \) is \( E = \frac{\text{Total Luminous Flux}}{\text{Area}} \), where Total Luminous Flux is the number of lamps \( N \) multiplied by the luminous flux per lamp (300 lumens).

3. **Rearrange the formula to solve for \( N \)**: \( N = \frac{E \times A}{L} \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{lux} \), \( A = 12 \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( L = 300 \, \text{lumens} \).

4. **Plug in the values**: \( N = \frac{50 \times 12}{300} = 2 \).

Thus, **2 lamps** are required, corresponding to option **C**.
