Okay, so I've got this question about the absorption coefficient of glass and how much light it transmits through a certain thickness. Hmm, I remember that absorption coefficients relate to how much light gets absorbed as it passes through a material. The formula I think is something like the transmission coefficient T is e^(-αx), where α is the absorption coefficient and x is the thickness. Oh wait, right, e is the base of natural logarithm, approximately 2.718.

The question says the absorption coefficient α is 0.05 mm^-1. The thickness x is 4 mm. So I plug these into the formula. Let's see: e^(-0.05 *4) = e^(-0.2). What's the value of e^-0.2? I remember that e^-0.2 is approximately 0.8187. So the transmission T is about 0.8187, which means 81.87% of the light is transmitted.

Looking at the options, option B is 81.87%. So that should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes. Alternatively, if I confused transmission with reflection or absorption, but no, the question specifically asks for transmission. So yeah, B must be the right choice.

To determine the percentage of light transmitted through a glass plate with an absorption coefficient of α = 0.05 mm⁻¹ and a thickness of 4 mm, we use the formula for transmission:

\[ T = e^{-\alpha x} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ T = e^{-0.05 \times 4} = e^{-0.2} \approx 0.8187 \]

This corresponds to approximately 81.87% transmission. Among the options, **B: 81.87%** is the correct choice.

Answer: B
