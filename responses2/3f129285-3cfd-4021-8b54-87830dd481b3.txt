Okay, so I've got this math problem here. The question is asking which of the given ratios forms a proportion with 3 over 8. The options are A through D with different fractions. I'm a bit new to proportions, but I think I can figure this out.

Alright, let's start by understanding what a proportion is. A proportion is when two ratios are equal. So, if I have 3/8, I need to find another ratio that equals 3/8. That means when I simplify either of the given options, it should equal 3/8.

Wait, but another way to think about it is by cross-multiplication. If I have two fractions a/b and c/d, they form a proportion if a*d = b*c. So, for each option, I can cross-multiply and see if the products are equal.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 24/64. Let's cross-multiply. 3 * 64 = 192, and 8 * 24 = 192. Oh, wait, 192 equals 192. That means 3/8 is equal to 24/64. So, option A is a proportion. But wait, maybe I should check the others just to be sure.

Option B: 15/48. Cross-multiplying: 3*48=144, 8*15=120. 144 isn't equal to 120, so this isn't a proportion.

Option C: 18/56. Let me calculate 3*56=168, and 8*18=144. 168 isn't equal to 144, so that's not a proportion.

Option D: 18/40. Cross-multiplying: 3*40=120, 8*18=144. 120 isn't equal to 144, so D isn't a proportion either.

Wait, but wait a second, did I do the calculations right? Let me double-check. 

For option A: 24*8 is 192, and 64*3 is 192. Yes, that's correct.

For option B: 3*48=144, 8*15=120. Not equal.

Option C: 3*56=168, 8*18=144. Nope.

Option D: 3*40=120, 8*18=144. Again, no.

So, the only one that works is option A. Hmm, but I remember sometimes I might have mixed up the numerators and denominators. Let me see another way. Maybe simplifying each option to see if it reduces to 3/8.

Option A: 24/64. Dividing numerator and denominator by 8: 24 รท8=3, 64 รท8=8. So yes, 3/8. That confirms it.

Options B, C, and D don't reduce to 3/8. So the answer is A.

The correct answer is A, as 24/64 simplifies to 3/8.
