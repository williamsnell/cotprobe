Okay, I have this question here about calculating the current drawn by an electric iron. Let me think through it step by step.

So the question is: How many amperes will a 720-watt electric iron take from a 120-volt line? The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 2 to 12 amps.

Hmm, I remember that power, voltage, and current are related by the formula P = V * I. Power is in watts, voltage in volts, and current in amperes. So I can rearrange the formula to find the current, which is I = P / V.

Plugging in the numbers, P is 720 watts and V is 120 volts. So I would calculate 720 divided by 120. Let me do the math: 720 รท 120 equals 6. So the current should be 6 amperes.

Looking at the options, option A is 6 amp. That makes sense. I don't see any mistake in that calculation. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the current, use the formula \( P = V \times I \), rearranged to \( I = P / V \). Plug in \( P = 720 \, \text{W} \) and \( V = 120 \, \text{V} \):  
\( I = 720 / 120 = 6 \, \text{A} \).  

The correct answer is **A: 6 amp**.
