Okay, so I've got this division problem here: 7,285 divided by 4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that long division is the way to go for such calculations, especially with larger numbers. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll write down 7,285 and set it up with 4 outside. I need to figure out how many times 4 goes into each digit of 7285, starting from the left. 

Starting with the first digit, 7. How many times does 4 go into 7? Well, 4 goes once, because 4 times 1 is 4, which is less than 7. Subtracting 4 from 7 leaves a remainder of 3. So, I write down 1 for the first digit of the quotient.

Next, I bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 32. Now, how many times does 4 go into 32? That's 8 times because 4 times 8 is 32. I write 8 next to the 1, making the quotient 18 so far. No remainder because 32 is exactly divisible by 4.

Moving on to the next digit, which is 8. Again, 4 goes into 8 exactly 2 times. So I write 2. Now the quotient is 182.

Finally, I bring down the last digit, which is 5. How many times does 4 go into 5? Well, 4 goes once, because 4 times 1 is 4, which is less than 5. Subtracting 4 from 5 leaves a remainder of 1. So, I write 1 as the next digit in the quotient. That gives me 1821, and the remainder is 1.

Putting it all together, the quotient is 1821 with a remainder of 1. Looking at the options provided, I need to find which one matches this result. Let me check the options:

A: 1,821  
B: 1,811 R1  
C: 1,801  
D: 1,811  
E: 1,831 R1  
F: 1,821 R2  
G: 1,831  
H: 1,801 R2  
I: 1,801 R1  
J: 1,821 R1  

From my calculation, the quotient is 1821 and the remainder is 1. Looking at the options, option A is 1,821, which is the quotient, and option J is 1,821 R1, which includes both the quotient and the remainder. But wait, the question asks for the division result, which is typically presented as quotient with remainder. So the correct answer should be option J: 1,821 R1.
