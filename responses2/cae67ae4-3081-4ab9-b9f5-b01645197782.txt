Okay, so I've got this economics question in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about how a rise in the price of a substitute good affects the equilibrium price and quantity of another good. Specifically, good Z is a close substitute for another good, good X. The options are A to J, each giving different possibilities for the price and quantity changes.

Hmm, I remember that in economics, when two goods are substitutes, their prices are related. Substitutes are goods that can be used in place of each other. So if the price of X increases and it's a substitute for Z, what happens?

Wait, the question says that Z is a close substitute. So if X's price goes up, does that make Z more or less likely to be purchased?

Oh right, substitutes are goods where an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the demand for the other. Like, if apples and oranges are substitutes, then if apples are more expensive, some people might buy oranges instead.

So in this case, if X is a substitute for Z, then raising the price of X should increase the demand for Z. Because more people can buy Z now since X is cheaper, or maybe because X is more attractive as a substitute.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. When the price of a substitute increases, the demand for the substitute increases. So, if X's price goes up, more people buy X. Then, since X is a substitute for Z, those people are also more likely to buy Z instead of X. So the demand for Z should increase.

Wait, but wait. Normally, if the price of a good increases, the demand for that good decreases, assuming all else equal. But when there's a substitute, the demand for the original good increases.

So, for example, if the price of apples increases, more people might buy oranges instead. So apples increase demand for oranges.

In this question, X is a substitute for Z. So if X's price rises, more people buy X, making them more likely to buy Z instead. So the demand for Z increases.

So now, with increased demand for Z, the demand curve shifts to the right.

What about the supply? The question doesn't mention anything about the supply of Z. So I think we can assume that the supply curve remains unchanged unless told otherwise.

So, with increased demand, the equilibrium price and quantity both go up.

Wait, but wait another thing. There's a subtle point here. The question says "close substitute." Close substitutes have a lot of buyers in the market. So when X's price increases, even a small increase in price could cause a significant change in demand. I think that when the price of a substitute increases, the demand for the original good increases in a non-linear way.

Wait, no, the question doesn't say anything about the elasticity. It just says it's a close substitute. So I think in this case, the demand for Z increases because the price of X, which is a substitute, goes up. So the demand curve shifts right.

So with that, the new equilibrium would have a higher price and higher quantity.

Looking at the options:

Option D says price falls and quantity rises.

Option H says price remains same and quantity rises.

Option I says price rises and quantity falls.

Option J says both rise.

Wait, but in this scenario, the demand increases, pushing price up and quantity up. So options D and I and J and others.

Looking at the options:

Option D: price falls, quantity rises. No, that's not what's happening.

Option I: price rises, quantity falls. No, because demand increases.

Option J: Both rise. That's what I think happens.

Wait, but wait again. What if the product is a substitute, and the supply is inelastic? Then, perhaps, even if demand increases a lot, the quantity doesn't change much. But the options don't mention anything about elasticity, so I have to assume that the variables are the main factors.

Wait, but the question is about the equilibrium price and quantity. So, in a standard supply and demand setup, when there's an increase in demand, the equilibrium price goes up, and the quantity goes up as well.

So option D and I and J and G are options. But wait, option D says price falls, which is not correct. So what are the other options?

Looking again:

Option D: price fall, quantity same. No, because demand increases, so quantity will rise.

Option I: price rise, quantity fall. No, because demand increases, so quantity goes up.

Option J: both rise.

So the correct answer would be option J, right?

Wait, but wait another thought. What if the substitute is a cheaper good? If X is a substitute for Z, and its price rises, more people might buy X. So, for example, if X is cheaper than Z, and its price increases, then people might switch to Z. Because X is more expensive now, so they prefer Z.

So that would cause demand for Z to increase, leading to higher price and higher quantity.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option J: price and quantity both rise.

When the price of a close substitute, good X, rises, the demand for the other good, good Z, increases. This is because a higher price of X makes it more attractive relative to Z, leading to a substitution effect. As a result, the demand curve for Z shifts to the right, causing the equilibrium price and quantity for Z to both rise. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J**: These options describe various scenarios where price or quantity remains unchanged or changes in a different direction. However, the increase in demand for Z means both price and quantity must rise.

Thus, the correct answer is **J: The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both rise.**

Answer: J
