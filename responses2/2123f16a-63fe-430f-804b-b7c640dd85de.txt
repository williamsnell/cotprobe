Okay, so I have this question about calculating the return on invested capital (ROIC). Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that is, but I think it's a measure of how efficiently a company is using its invested capital to generate profits. Let me think about what I know.

The question gives me some data points. The net investments for 1966 and 1967, net sales for 1967, and net income for 1967. Oh wait, net investments are probably the amount invested in the company's assets during the year, right? So in 1966, they had $250k net investments, and in 1967, it went up to $350k. 

Net sales in 1967 are $600k, and net income is $25k. I remember that ROIC is calculated by dividing the net income by the average invested capital. Oh wait, and the average invested capital would be the average of the beginning and ending net investments, because it's an average measure.

So the formula would be: ROIC = (Net Income) / (Average Invested Capital). 

Let me calculate the average invested capital first. The net investments for 1966 are 250k, and for 1967, it's 350k. So the average would be (250 + 350)/2 = 300k. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what exactly constitutes invested capital. I think it's the money that goes into the company's operations, like assets. So yes, that average is correct.

So plugging the numbers in: Net Income is $25k, and Average Invested Capital is $300k. So 25k / 300k = 0.0833333... which is approximately 8.3%. But wait, the question says to the nearest tenth of 1%. Hmm, 8.3% is already to the nearest tenth of a percent. But let me double-check.

Wait, another thingâ€”maybe I'm supposed to use the beginning and ending net investments for the average. Because sometimes, depending on the definition, people might use the first year's net investment as the denominator and the last year's as the numerator. Let me see.

If I take 250k as the denominator and 350k as the numerator, that would be 25k / 350k = about 0.071428, which is 7.1%. Oh, so I get two different results depending on the method. So I need to figure out which method is correct here.

Wait, I think ROIC is calculated using the average invested capital, which would be the average of the beginning and ending net investments. So the correct average is 300k, giving 8.3%. But wait, looking back at the options, 8.3% is option F. But wait, the other approach gave 7.1%, which is option B.

Hmm, so there's confusion here. Let me think about the exact definition. The return on invested capital (ROIC) is calculated as (Net income) divided by (Average invested capital), where average invested capital is the average of the beginning and ending net investments. So that would be (250 + 350)/2 = 300k. So 25k / 300k is 0.0833, which is 8.3%, so option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 8.3%, which is what I get. However, another approach could be to use the previous year's net investment as the denominator. So Net investment in 1966 is 250k, and in 1967 is 350k. Net income is 25k. So 25k / 250k = 10%, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be the right approach.

Wait, but maybe I'm supposed to use the average of the two net investments. Let me recalculate: 250 + 350 = 600; divided by 2 is 300. So 25 / 300 = 0.0833, which is 8.3%. So the correct answer should be 8.3%, which is option F. But wait, looking at the options, option F is 8.3%, but option B is 7.1%. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. Net income is 25k. Average invested capital is (250k + 350k)/2 = 300k. 25 / 300 is 0.083333..., which is 8.333...%, so to the nearest tenth of a percent, that's 8.3%. So option F. But looking at the options, option G is 10.2%, which is higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the denominator is the beginning net investment, not the average.

Wait, no, that's not right. The average is the average of the two net investments. Let me think. Net investments are the amounts invested each year. So the total investment over the year is 250k (1966) and 350k (1967), so the average is (250 + 350)/2 = 300k. 

So 25k / 300k = 0.083333, which is about 8.3%. So option F. But wait, looking at the options, the choices are A to J, with F being 8.3%, which would be the correct answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the initial calculation gives me 8.3%, but another approach gives 7.1%. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that net investments are the amount invested in the previous year. So net investment at the beginning is 250k (1966), and at the end is 350k (1967). Net sales in 1967 are 600k, which might not be needed for this calculation. 

Wait, maybe the formula is Net income divided by the previous year's net investment. So 25k / 250k = 10%, which isn't an option. So that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is the average of the investments at the end of the period. Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct formula is (Net income) divided by the average invested capital. So 25k / (250k + 350k)/2 = 25k / 300k = 8.333...%, so 8.3% as option F.

Wait, but wait. Another way: Maybe the denominator is the investment at the end of the year. So the investment in 1967 is 350k. Net income is 25k. So 25k / 350k = 7.14285...%, which is about 7.1%. That's option B. But why would that be the case?

I think the confusion arises from whether to average the two years' net investments or to use one of them as the denominator. The correct approach for ROIC is to use the average invested capital. So the average is 300k, leading to 8.3%, so option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 8.3%, which would be correct. So the answer should be F. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Net income divided by the average of the beginning and ending investments. So (250 + 350)/2 = 300k. Net income is 25k. So 25/300 = 0.08333, 8.3%. So option F is correct.

Wait, but then why is option B 7.1%? Could I have mixed up the formula? Let me look for the correct formula. The return on invested capital is calculated as Net income divided by average invested capital. So the average is (250 + 350)/2 = 300. So 25/300 = 8.3%. So the correct answer should be 8.3%, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option G is 10.2%, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check: 25 / 300 is 0.08333, which is 8.3%. So I think F is correct.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps the average invested capital is calculated differently. Maybe it's the beginning investment. So 250k is the investment at the beginning of the year, 350k at the end. So maybe the denominator is the average of the beginning and the end. But that's the same as before. So no difference.

So the correct answer would be F, 8.3%.

The return on invested capital (ROIC) is calculated by dividing net income by the average invested capital. The average invested capital is the average of the net investments in 1966 and 1967, which is (250 + 350)/2 = 300k. The net income is 25k. Thus, ROIC = 25 / 300 = 0.08333, or 8.3%.

The correct answer is F: 8.3%.
