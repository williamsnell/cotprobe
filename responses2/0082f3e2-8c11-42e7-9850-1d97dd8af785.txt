Question:

A homeowner was injured when he slipped and fell in a puddle of water on his sunroom floor; the water had accumulated on the floor during a rainstorm because of leaks in the roof. The roof's manufacturer had supplied nondefective materials to the installer, who was a franchisee (and not an employee) of the manufacturer. The leaks resulted from the carelessness of the installer during the from the carelessness of the installer during the installation of the roof. The installer's truck, which had been parked in front of the homeowner's house during the roof installation, bore the manufacturer's logo. The manufacturer was aware that the truck and the literature supplied by the installer both displayed the manufacturer's logo. Is there any basis for a claim by the homeowner against the manufacturer?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer was aware that the installer used their logo.
B: Yes, because the installer was a franchisee of the manufacturer.
C: No, because the homeowner was responsible for choosing the installer.
D: Yes, because the installer's truck displayed the manufacturer's logo.
E: No, because the manufacturer only supplied nondefective materials.
F: No, because the leaks were due to the installer's negligence, not the manufacturer's.
G: No, because a franchisor has no duty to supervise the conduct of a franchisee.
H: Yes, under the rule of vicarious liability.
I: No, under the rule that a manufacturer is liable only for defects in a product that existed at the time the product left the hands of the manufacturer.
J: Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about product liability. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The scenario is a homeowner who slipped and fell in a puddle of water on his sunroom floor. The water was accumulating because of leaks from a rainstorm due to roof leaks caused by the manufacturer's leaks. Wait, no, the question says the installer was a franchisee of the manufacturer. So, the installer was not an employee but a separate entity.

The installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo. The manufacturer was aware that the installer's truck and the installer's literature had the logo. The installer's actions led to the water, and the installer's truck was parked nearby.

The question is whether the manufacturer can claim liability against the installer for the water. The options are A to J.

I remember that liability can come from defects in the product. So the manufacturer's job was to supply nondefective materials. But wait, the installer was a franchisee. Franchisees don't have the same level of control as employees, right? They're not directly involved in the production or the product's creation.

But wait, the installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo. The installer was the one who should have inspected the truck. If the installer used the manufacturer's logo, perhaps that's a red flag. Or, since the installer was a franchisee, they didn't have control over the product's quality, so they weren't responsible for the defect.

Wait, no. Franchisees are separate and not directly responsible for the product's quality, so they wouldn't be liable for defects in the product. So if the installer had a defective product, the manufacturer would be liable. But in this case, the product was provided by the manufacturer, so the installer's fault is the question.

Alternatively, maybe the installer's truck's logo being from the manufacturer indicates that the installer was aware of the brand, but if the installer was a franchisee, they might not have the same responsibility as a professional.

Wait, but the question says the installer's truck bore the manufacturer's logo. If the installer was a franchisee, they were not part of the company, so they wouldn't have any duty to inspect or ensure the product's quality. So, if the product was defective, the manufacturer would be liable, but the installer's role as a franchisee would mean they aren't directly liable.

Hmm, but the question is about the installer's liability. So if the installer used the manufacturer's logo, perhaps that's a red flag. Or maybe since the installer was the one who ran the truck, which bears the logo, it's a sign that the installer had the knowledge or responsibility to keep the truck in good condition.

Wait, the rule of apparent agency says that the manufacturer isn't liable for defects in their own products because they can't control how their staff (or in this case, the installer) behave. But in this case, the installer's truck has a logo, which might indicate that the installer was installing the product in a way that's linked to the brand, or perhaps the installer had the knowledge to ensure the product was correct.

Wait, but the installer was a franchisee. Franchisees are separate. So the installer's duty is to install the product and ensure it's correct. If the product is defective, but the installer used the logo, maybe the installer was aware of the brand's identity, leading to the installation. So perhaps the installer's act of installing the product is a defect, but the installer was acting in their capacity as a franchisee.

But wait, I think the key here is whether the installer was directly responsible for the defective product. Since the installer was a franchisee, they aren't the ones who installed the product. The product was already provided by the manufacturer. So the manufacturer can't be held liable for the installer's product because the installer isn't the defendant; they're the plaintiff.

Wait, no. The question is whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer. So the installer is the plaintiff. But the installer is a franchisee, which means they aren't directly liable in their own right. The manufacturer's liability would be based on the product's defect.

Alternatively, maybe the installer's actions (like installing the product correctly) are the cause of the defect. So, if the installer had a defective installation, the manufacturer would be liable. But the question is about the installer's liability, not the manufacturer's. So the installer's liability is about their own actions leading to the product's defect.

The installer's truck bearing the manufacturer's logo might be a red flag. If the installer used the logo, perhaps they knew they were using the brand correctly, or they were a compliant installer. But as a franchisee, the installer's role is separate. So the installer might be liable for installing the product correctly, but the question is whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer.

Wait, but the question is whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer. So the installer is the one who slipped and fell, and the product was defective. So the installer's fault is the issue. But since the installer was a franchisee, they aren't directly liable for product defects. So the manufacturer can't be liable for the installer's failure to install the product correctly because the installer wasn't the defendant. 

But wait, maybe the installer's actions were part of the product's quality. For example, if the installer's installation was defective, then the manufacturer would be liable. But in this case, the installer's truck was bearing the manufacturer's logo, which might indicate that they were installing the product correctly.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The installer was a franchisee, so they weren't part of the manufacturer's production. The product was supplied by the manufacturer, and the installer was responsible for installing it. But since the installer is not the manufacturer, is the manufacturer liable for their installation?

The rule of lack of fault applies when the plaintiff's actions are a defect in the defendant's product. Here, the product was supplied by the manufacturer, but the installer was installing it. So, perhaps the installer's failure to install the product correctly is a defect, and the manufacturer is liable.

Alternatively, the installer's role as a franchisee might mean they aren't directly liable for the product's defects. But the question is whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer. So the installer's liability is about their own actions, not the manufacturer's.

Wait, but the installer's truck having the manufacturer's logo might indicate that they were installing the product correctly. If the installer was installing the product properly, then the product was defective, and the manufacturer is liable. But the installer's role as a franchisee might mean they weren't directly liable, but perhaps the installer's actions (like installing correctly) were a defect.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options.

Option A: Yes, because the manufacturer was aware the installer used their logo. So the installer's actions were linked to the manufacturer's brand. But as a franchisee, the installer wasn't directly liable for the product's defects.

Option B: Yes, because installer was a franchisee. But the manufacturer's liability isn't based on the installer's status as a franchisee. So this might not be the case.

Option C: No, because the homeowner was responsible for choosing the installer. Well, the installer was a franchisee, not an employee. The installer's choice might be irrelevant unless they were negligent. But the installer's actions led to the defect, so perhaps the installer was negligent.

Option D: Yes, because the installer's truck displayed the manufacturer's logo. If the installer's truck was correctly installed, then the product was defective. But since the installer isn't the manufacturer, the product was defective, so the manufacturer is liable.

But wait, the question is about the installer's liability. So the installer's action (installing correctly) is a defect, so the manufacturer is liable.

But the installer is a franchisee. Is the manufacturer liable for the installer's negligence?

Wait, the installer's role as a franchisee is separate. The installer's failure to install correctly is a defect in their own action, not in the product. So the product was defective, and the manufacturer could be liable for the installer's failure to install correctly.

But wait, the question is whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer. So the installer's own negligence is at issue. The installer's truck is part of the product, so if the installer had a defective installation, the product was defective, and the manufacturer is liable.

But the installer is a franchisee, so they might not be responsible for their own actions. But the question is about the installer's liability. So, perhaps the installer's failure to install correctly is a defect, and the manufacturer is liable.

Alternatively, maybe the installer's actions (like installing the product correctly) were part of their role as a franchisee, but that's not directly leading to the product's defect.

Wait, the question is if the installer is responsible for the product's defect. So the product was defective because the installer's installation was incorrect. So the manufacturer is liable for the installer's failure to install correctly.

But since the installer is a franchisee, they aren't directly liable for product defects. So the manufacturer can claim against the installer for defective installation.

Wait, but the question is about the installer's liability. So the installer is a third party (the plaintiff). If the product was defective, the manufacturer can be liable for the installer's failure to install the product correctly.

But wait, the product was defective because it was provided by the manufacturer, but the installer was the one installing it. So the product was defective because the installer's actions were incorrect. So the manufacturer is liable for the installer's defect.

But the question is whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer. So in this case, the installer's own actions (installing incorrectly) are the cause of the product's defect. So the manufacturer can claim for the installer's negligence.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again. Option A says yes because the manufacturer was aware the installer used their logo. Option D says yes because installer's truck had the logo.

Wait, but the issue is whether the installer is responsible for the product's defects. The product's defect is due to the installer's failure to install correctly. But the installer isn't the manufacturer, so the product's defects are on the installer's part. So the manufacturer can be liable for the installer's defect.

Hmm, but the options may not directly address this. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Yes, because the manufacturer was aware of the installer's use of their logo. Maybe the installer used the logo to know that the product was defective. But as a franchisee, the installer isn't directly liable for the product's defects. So maybe this is a red herring.

Option B: Yes, because installer was a franchisee. But the manufacturer's liability isn't based on the installer's role as a franchisee. So this might not be the case.

Option C: No, because the homeowner was responsible for choosing the installer. Wait, the installer was a franchisee, not an employee. So the installer's choice isn't directly at the manufacturer's responsibility. Thus, C might not be correct.

Option D: Yes, because installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo. If the installer was installing the product correctly, then the product was defective, and the manufacturer is liable. But again, the installer isn't directly liable in their own right; it's the product that's defective.

Wait, but the installer's failure to install correctly is a defect in their own action, so the product is defective, and the manufacturer can claim against the installer because they're liable for their own actions.

But in the options, do any of them address this? Option D says yes because the installer's truck had the logo. But I'm not sure that's the issue.

Wait, the question is specifically about the installer's liability. So if the installer had a defective product, the manufacturer can claim against them. But in this case, the product was defective because the installer had a defective installation. So the manufacturer can claim against the installer.

But the options don't have an option about the installer's own negligence. Let's look at the options again.

Looking at the options, option B says yes because the installer was a franchisee. But I don't think that's the basis. The issue isn't the installer's role as a franchisee, but the product's defect being due to the installer's negligence.

Wait, but the installer's truck bearing the manufacturer's logo might be an indicator that the installer was installing the product correctly, leading to the defective product. So in that case, the installer's failure to install correctly is a defect, and the manufacturer is liable.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the rule of apparent agency. The rule of apparent agency says that the manufacturer isn't liable for defects in their own product because they can't control the staff's behavior. But here, the installer is acting as the manufacturer's staff, so under the rule, the installer would be liable.

But since the installer is a franchisee, they aren't directly liable. However, the issue is whether the installer is responsible for the product's defects. So the product was defective because the installer's actions were wrong. So the manufacturer can claim against the installer because they're responsible for the product's defect.

Wait, but if the installer's actions were incorrect, the product was defective, so the manufacturer can claim for the installer's failure to install correctly.

But the options don't mention that. Let me look again.

The options are about whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer. So the answer could be B or D.

Wait, option D says yes because the installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo. If the installer used the logo, perhaps they knew the product was defective, leading to a defective installation. So the product was defective because the installer had a defective installation, which the manufacturer could claim against.

So the answer could be D.

Wait, but the question is about the installer's liability. So is the installer liable for the product's defect? If so, then yes, because the product was defective due to the installer's failure to install correctly.

But the options don't have an option addressing that. The options given are about whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer.

Wait, the question is whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer. So the installer's failure to install correctly is a defect, and the product is defective. Therefore, the manufacturer can be liable for the installer's negligence.

But the options don't have an option about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the installer was a franchisee and thus not responsible for their own actions. So the product's defect is on the installer's side, but the installer isn't liable because they're a franchisee. So the manufacturer might not be liable.

Wait, but the product was supplied by the manufacturer, but the installer installed it. So the product was defective because the installer's actions were incorrect. So the manufacturer can claim against the installer if they're responsible for the product's defect.

But the installer isn't the manufacturer, so the product is defective, and the manufacturer is liable for the installer's failure to install correctly.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: Yes, because the installer was a franchisee. But I don't think that's the basis.

Option D: Yes, because the installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo. If the installer's installation was correct, then the product was defective, and the manufacturer is liable. But the installer was a franchisee, so they're not directly liable in their own actions. So even if the installer's installation was correct, the product was defective because the installer had a defect in their installation, which the manufacturer can claim against.

Wait, but the installer's role as a franchisee makes them not directly responsible for the product's defects. So the product's defect is on the installer's part, but the installer isn't liable because they're a third party.

Wait, no. The product was defective due to the installer's failure to install correctly. So the product's defect is on the installer's actions, not on the manufacturer's. So the manufacturer can claim against the installer for the defective installation.

But the options don't have an option about that. Let me look.

Looking at the options, option B says yes because the installer was a franchisee. But I don't think that's the case. The issue isn't the installer's role as a franchisee, but the product's defect arising from the installer's failure to install correctly.

Wait, but the question is about the installer's liability. So, the installer's failure to install correctly is a product defect, and the manufacturer can be liable for that. But the installer is a franchisee, and they aren't directly liable for the product's defects. So the manufacturer can claim against the installer for defective installation.

Wait, but the answer options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D, because the installer's truck bearing the manufacturer's logo could indicate that they had the knowledge to install correctly, leading to a defective product. So the product was defective, and the manufacturer is liable for the installer's failure to install it correctly.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, the installer's actions linked to the manufacturer's logo might indicate that they were installing the product correctly, but that's not the case. The question says that the installer's truck bore the manufacturer's logo, but that doesn't necessarily mean they were installing it correctly.

Wait, no— the installer's truck bearing the manufacturer's logo could be a red herring. The installer's truck's logo doesn't directly indicate that they were installing the product correctly; it might just be a way to display the manufacturer's logo on their truck.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the rule of apperception. The rule of apperception says that the manufacturer isn't liable for defects in their own product because they can't control the staff's behavior. But in this case, the installer is acting as the manufacturer's staff, so the rule would apply, and the installer would be liable.

But the installer is a franchisee. So the rule of apparent agency says that the manufacturer isn't liable for defects in their own product because they can't control the staff's behavior. But the installer is acting as the manufacturer's staff, so the rule would apply. So the installer would be liable.

Wait, but the question is whether the manufacturer can claim against the installer. So if the installer is a franchisee, and thus not directly liable, but the product was defective because the installer's actions were wrong, then the manufacturer can claim against the installer.

But the options don't have such an option. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Option B says yes because the installer was a franchisee. But the issue isn't the installer's role as a franchisee, but the product's defect due to the installer's failure to install correctly.

Alternatively, the installer's failure to install correctly is a defect in their own action, so the product was defective. So the manufacturer can claim against the installer for defective installation.

But I'm back to the options. The options don't have an option that says yes because of the installer's failure to install correctly. So perhaps the answer is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, option D says yes because the installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo. If the installer had the logo, maybe they knew they were using the manufacturer's product, leading to a defective installation. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the installer's failure to install correctly is a defect in their own product, and the manufacturer can claim against them.

But given that the installer is a franchisee, I'm not sure if that affects the outcome.

Wait, the rule of apparent agency says that the manufacturer isn't liable for defects in their own product. But if the installer is acting as the manufacturer's staff, then the installer is liable because the manufacturer can't control their behavior.

But in this case, the installer is a franchisee, so they aren't directly liable. But the product was defective because the installer's actions were wrong. So the manufacturer can be liable for the installer's failure to install correctly.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.

The question is: Can the manufacturer claim against the installer?

The product was supplied by the manufacturer. The installer was a franchisee, so they aren't directly liable for the product's defects. However, the installer's failure to install the product correctly is a product defect, and the manufacturer can be liable for that.

So the answer is that the manufacturer can claim against the installer, because the installer's failure to install the product correctly is a defect in the product, and the manufacturer is liable for that.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that says that. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, no. The options are about the installer's liability. So perhaps the installer is liable for installing the product correctly, leading to a defective product, and thus the manufacturer is liable for the installer's failure to install correctly.

But the options don't have such an option. So perhaps the answer is B.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to remember the rules.

The rule of apparent agency says that the manufacturer isn't liable for defects in their own product because they can't control the staff's behavior.

The rule of lack of fault says that if a third party's actions are at fault for a defective product, the manufacturer is liable.

In this case, the product was defective because the installer's failure to install it was a defect in the product. However, since the installer is a franchisee, they aren't directly liable for the product's defects. So the manufacturer can be liable for the installer's failure to install the product correctly.

Wait, but the question is whether the installer is responsible for the product's defect. So if the product was defective because of the installer's failure to install it, then the manufacturer is liable for the installer's failure to install it.

But the installer is a franchisee, so they aren't directly liable for the product's defects. However, the product's defect is on the installer's part, so the manufacturer can claim against the installer.

But I'm not sure about the options. Let me look again.

Option B: Yes, because installer was a franchisee.

Wait, but the installer is a franchisee, so they aren't directly liable for the product's defects. But the product's defect is on the installer's side, so the manufacturer can claim against the installer.

But I think the correct answer is B, because the installer's failure to install the product correctly is a defect in their action, and the manufacturer can be liable for that.

Wait, but the question is about the installer's liability, not the manufacturer's.

So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of it in terms of whether the installer is liable for the product's defect.

The product was defective because the installer's failure to install it was a defect in the product. The manufacturer can be liable for that.

So the answer is yes, and the correct option is B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because the installer is a franchisee, they aren't directly liable for the product's defects. So the product's defect is on the installer's side, but the installer isn't directly liable. So the manufacturer can claim against the installer for defective installation.

But the options don't have that.

So I'm going to pick option B as the answer, because the installer was a franchisee, and the product was defective due to the installer's failure to install it correctly. So the manufacturer is liable for the installer's failure to install the product correctly.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: Yes, because the installer was a franchisee**. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The product was defective because the installer's failure to install it correctly was a defect in the product.
2. The manufacturer can be liable for the installer's failure to install the product correctly because the product was defective.
3. The installer being a franchisee does not negate their liability for defective installation. The issue is whether the product's defect arises from the installer's actions, not from the installer's role as a franchisee.

ANSWER: B
