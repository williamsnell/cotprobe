" Two years later, the nephew entered into a real estate agreement for the sale of the property to his brother, whereby the nephew agreed to convey the premises to the brother in fee simple absolute. Prior to the settlement date, the brother contacted the nephew, telling him that he would not perform his part of the agreement because the nephew could not convey a fee simple.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about real estate law. Let me read through it carefully.

The setup is that the grantor conveyed her mansion and surrounding property to her nephew for life. After that, the remainder was to his nephew's heirs. So, the property is first given, then the remainder is to his dead relatives. 

Two years later, the nephew entered into a real estate agreement to sell the property to his brother. The agreement says the nephew conveys the premises to his brother in fee simple absolute. So, the nephew is promising to sell it to his brother for the entire property, no remainder.

Before the settlement date, the brother called the nephew and said he wouldn't do his part because the nephew couldn't convey a fee simple. Wait, but fee simple absolute is a permanent interest. I think that fee simple can't be transferred, but here the nephew is promising to give it to his brother. So, the nephew's conveyance here is from the principle of fee simple (the property is given to the brother) to the brother's conveyance, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

Now, the question is about the nephew's prayer for specific performance. The Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished, so I need to remember what that rule was about. I recall that in Shelley's Rule, the interest is a fee simple absolute, and the remainder is a vested remainder. If the remainder is to the nephew's heirs, they get a vested remainder, and their interest becomes a life estate because it's a life estate in the remaindermen's interest. 

Wait, but in this case, the nephew's interest is fee simple absolute. So, he's giving it to his brother for fee simple. But wait, fee simple absolute is a life estate in his own estate. So, when he sells it to his brother, the brother gets a fee simple absolute. But the brother has a vested remainder to his heirs. 

So, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder to his heirs. But wait, according to the Rule in Shelley's, a fee simple absolute gives a life estate in the remaindermen's interest, and the remaindermen's interest (here, the nephew) can't transfer, so the remainder is a vested remainder in the nephew's estate. 

But wait, the options are for the nephew's performance. Let me think about the specific issues here. The question is whether the nephew's interest is a fee simple absolute, and if the brother is getting a fee simple absolute, which is a life estate, and the remainder is a vested remainder. 

But the nephew's own interest is fee simple absolute because he's conveying it to his brother for fee simple. So, the nephew has a fee simple absolute interest, which, under Shelley's Rule, becomes a life estate in his own estate. So, he can't transfer that. 

But the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder to the nephew's heirs. However, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute, which is a life estate in the nephew's estate. 

Wait, but the brother is the one who's not performing his part because the nephew can't convey a fee simple. Wait, no. The nephew is the one making the transfer to the brother. So, the nephew's conveyance is fee simple to the brother, but the brother has a vested remainder. So, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder to the nephew's heirs. 

But the question is about the nephew's prayer for specific performance. The Rule in Shelley's Case abolished this rule, which probably means that the interest is a fee simple absolute, so the remainder is a vested remainder. 

In this scenario, the nephew's interest is fee simple absolute, so when he sells it to the brother for fee simple, that's a fee simple to the brother, but the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew. 

Wait, but the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute. So, under the Rule in Shelley's, the fee simple absolute becomes a life estate in his own interest, and the remainder is a vested remainder. 

But the question is about the nephew's performance. The brother is the one who's not performing because the nephew can't convey a fee simple. Wait, no, the nephew is the one who is conveying to the brother. So, the brother is the one who is not performing because he's trying to handle the remainder, but the nephew is making the transfer. 

Let me think again. The nephew, upon conveyance, gives fee simple to the brother. So the brother's interest is fee simple. The nephew's fee simple absolute becomes a life estate in his own estate. 

But the brother's interest is fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder to his heirs. But the brother is not performing, so the nephew's interest is fee simple absolute, which would make the nephew's interest a life estate in the remaindermen's (brother's) interest. 

Wait, but according to the Rule in Shelley's, a fee simple absolute creates a life estate in the remaindermen's interest. So, the nephew's fee simple absolute gives him a life estate to the brother. So, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder to the nephew's heirs. 

But the issue is the nephew's own interest. The nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the remaindermen's (brother's) interest. So, the remaindermen's (brother's) interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate). So, the nephew's interest is fee simple absolute to the brother, which is a life estate. 

But wait, the brother's interest is fee simple absolute to the nephew. But the brother's interest isn't a fee simple absolute in the sense of the remaindermen's interest. So, when the nephew is conveying fee simple to the brother, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute, which is a life estate in the nephew's estate. 

So, the nephew's fee simple absolute gives him a life estate in the brother's estate, which is a fee simple. But the brother is the one who isn't performing, so the nephew's interest is a life estate, which is possible. 

Wait, but the question is about the nephew's prayer for specific performance. So, under the Rule in Shelley's, the interest is a fee simple absolute, which would make the nephew's interest a life estate. So, the remainder is vested. 

Wait, but the options may be about whether the nephew's interest is a fee simple absolute, which would be denied because of the Rule in Shelley's, which abolished that. So, if the Rule has been abolished, then the interest is fee simple absolute, and the remainder is a vested remainder. 

But wait, the Rule in Shelley's abolished the idea that a fee simple absolute grants a life estate in the remainderman's interest. So, if that's the case, then the nephew's fee simple absolute gives a life estate to the brother, making the brother's interest a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and the remainder is a vested remainder. 

But the question is about the nephew's interest. If the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate, then his interest is a life estate. But the options are about whether the interest is granted or denied. 

Looking at the options:

Option E: denied because the Rule would not be triggered, thus only a life estate in nephew.

But the question states that the Rule in Shelley's has been abolished. So, under the new Rule, the interest is fee simple absolute, which would be a life estate in the remaindermen's interest. 

Wait, but the remaindermen's interest is the nephew's. So, the nephew's fee simple absolute grants him a life estate in the remaindermen's (brother) interest. That would mean that the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder to the nephew's heirs. 

But the brother is not performing, so the nephew's interest is a life estate in his own estate. 

So, the nephew's interest is a life estate, not a fee simple absolute. So, the nephew's interest is a life estate, not a fee simple absolute. So, the question is, is the nephew's interest a fee simple absolute? Or a life estate? 

Wait, the nephew is conveying fee simple to the brother. So, the nephew's fee simple absolute is to the brother. The brother's interest is fee simple absolute to the nephew. So, under the new Rule, the fee simple absolute is a life estate in the remaindermen's interest. 

So, the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the brother's (remaindermen) interest. So, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew. Thus, the nephew's interest is a life estate in his own estate. 

But the question is about whether the nephew's interest is granted. So, if the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate, then the nephew would have a life estate, not a fee simple absolute. So, he can transfer it to the brother, but the brother isn't performing. 

Wait, but the question is about the nephew's prayer for specific performance. So, if the remainder is a vested remainder, the nephew's interest is a life estate. But the Rule in Shelley's abolished this, meaning the interest is a fee simple absolute, which would make it a life estate. 

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach it differently. 

The nephew's conveyance to the brother is fee simple. So, the brother's interest is fee simple absolute to the nephew. The nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the brother's interest. The brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder to the nephew's heirs. 

But since the nephew's interest is fee simple absolute, which is a life estate in the remaindermen's (brother's) interest, but the brother isn't performing. So, the remainder is vested in the nephew's estate. 

Wait, but the question is about the nephew's interest. The nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the brother's interest. So, the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate. So, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and the remainder is a vested remainder. 

So, the nephew's interest is a life estate. 

Wait, but the question is about the nephew's prayer for specific performance. So, if the nephew's interest is a life estate, he can perform because he can convey it to his heirs. He can't perform a fee simple. 

Wait, but the issue is about the specific performance. So, the question is whether the nephew's interest is a fee simple absolute, which under the Rule in Shelley's, would create a life estate, or a fee simple, which would be a vested remainder. 

If the Rule in Shelley's has been abolished, then the interest is a fee simple absolute, which becomes a life estate in the remaindermen's interest. So, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder. 

But the question is, what happens to the nephew's interest. The nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate to the brother. So, the nephew's interest is a life estate, not a fee simple absolute. So, the answer would be that the nephew's interest is a life estate, which would be granted. 

Wait, but looking at the options: Option E is granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs. 

Wait, another approach: The initial conveyance is fee simple absolute to the brother. So, the brother's interest is fee simple absolute to the nephew. The nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the brother's interest. So, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder to his heirs. 

But if the Rule in Shelley's abolished, then the fee simple absolute would become a life estate. So, the remainder is vested. 

So, the nephew's fee simple absolute would be a life estate. So, he can convey it to his heirs. But the question is about the nephew's interest. He's conveying fee simple to the brother, which is fee simple. But the remainder is a vested remainder to his heirs.

But the question is about the nephew's interest. If the interest is a life estate, then he can perform. But if it's a fee simple absolute, then it's a life estate. 

Alternatively, if it's a fee simple, the remainder is a vested remainder. 

Wait, the key point is whether the nephew's interest is a fee simple absolute or a life estate. 

Let me recap. The original conveyance is fee simple absolute to the brother. This gives the brother a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew. The nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the brother's interest. 

Now, under the new Rule, which abolished Shelley's, the interest is a fee simple absolute, which makes it a life estate. So, the remainder is a vested remainder. 

But the question is about the nephew's interest. If the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the brother's interest, then the nephew's interest is a life estate. Thus, he can convey it to his heirs. 

So, the nephew's interest is a life estate, which is granted. So, the answer would be E: granted, because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs. 

Wait, but the options are A to J. Let me look at the options again. 

Option E says: granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee. So, the remainder is a vested remainder, making the nephew's estate a fee simple. That would mean the remainder is a full fee.

But under the new Rule, the remainder would be a vested remainder. So, the interest is a life estate. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me make it simpler. 

When a fee simple absolute is granted for a life estate to the remainderman, it becomes a life estate in the remainderman's interest. So, the remainderman gets a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the grantor, and a vested remainder to the grantor's heirs. 

So, the question is about the nephew's interest. The nephew is making a fee simple absolute transfer to the brother. The brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew. 

If the new Rule is in effect, then the nephew's fee simple absolute makes a life estate in the brother's interest. So, the brother's interest is a life estate to the nephew, and so the nephew has a life estate in the remainderman's (brother's) interest.

But the question is about the nephew's interest, which is a life estate. So, he can transfer it to the brother, but the brother isn't performing. 

Wait, but the issue is about the specific performance. The nephew is trying to perform. So, if the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate, he can convey it to his heirs. But the question is about his interest being granted. 

The new Rule abolished Shelley's, so the interest is fee simple absolute, which is a life estate. So, the remainder is a vested remainder in the nephew's estate. 

But the options don't say anything about the remainder being vested. Instead, the options are about the nephew's interest. 

So, if the interest is a life estate (as per the new Rule), then the nephew can perform. So, the answer should be that he's granted a life estate, which would be option E. Because then, he can sell the property to his heirs.

Wait, option E says: granted, because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs.

Wait, no. If the remainder is a vested remainder, the estate is a fee simple. But under the new Rule, the remainder would be a vested remainder, which makes the estate a fee simple. So, the remainder is vested, but the estate is a fee simple absolute.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again.

The conveyance is fee simple absolute to the brother. This makes the brother a fee simple absolute to the nephew. The nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the brother's interest. So, the remainder is a vested remainder in the nephew's estate.

But under the new Rule, this makes the remainder a vested remainder in the nephew's estate, which is a fee simple absolute. So, the remainder is a vested remainder in the nephew's estate, not in his own estate. 

So, the remainder is a vested remainder in the nephew's estate. So, the nephew's estate is a fee simple absolute with a vested remainder. 

So, the remainder is vested, but the estate is fee simple. Because the remainder is vested, the estate is fee simple.

So, the nephew's interest is fee simple absolute. 

But the options for the nephew's interest: 

Option A: denied, because the remainder to nephew's heirs is a contingent interest.

But the conveyance was fee simple absolute, so that's a life estate. So, option A is not correct.

Option D: denied, because the nephew's life estate combined with his vested remainder gives him a fee simple.

Wait, if the remainder is vested, then the nephew's estate becomes a fee simple. So, D says the nephew's estate is a fee simple. So, the answer would be that the remainder is vested, making the estate a fee simple. 

So, the nephew's interest is fee simple absolute (life estate), but the remainder is a vested remainder. So, the estate is a fee simple. 

But the question is about the nephew's interest, not the estate. But the options include E: granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee.

Wait, the remainder is a vested remainder in the nephew's estate. So, the problem is that the remainder is vested, which would mean the estate is a fee simple. So, the answer would be that the remainder is vested, and thus the estate is fee simple. 

But looking back, the options are about the nephew's interest. So, if the interest is a fee simple absolute, the answer is A. But A says the remainder to the nephew's heirs is a contingent interest. But no, the conveyance was fee simple absolute.

Wait, no. The conveyance is fee simple absolute to the brother. So, the brother is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew. So, the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the brother's interest. So, the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate to his own estate, making the nephew's estate a life estate in fee simple.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. 

The options:

A: denied, because the remainder to nephew's heirs is a contingent interest.

Wait, no. The conveyance was fee simple absolute to the brother. So, the remainder is a vested remainder to the nephew's heirs. 

But the conveyance was made to the nephew, so the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate to the brother. So, the brother's interest is a fee simple absolute (life estate) to the nephew, and a vested remainder to his heirs.

But the question is about the nephew's interest. If the conveyance was fee simple absolute, then the nephew's estate is a life estate in fee simple, which is a fee simple estate. 

So, the nephew's estate is fee simple. So, the answer would be E: granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs.

Wait, no. Because the remainder is vested, the estate is fee simple. So, the answer would be E: granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee.

Wait, no, it's the remainder that's vested, making the estate fee simple. So, the answer would be E: granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs.

Wait, but the question is about the nephew's interest. If the interest is a fee simple absolute, then the remainder is a vested remainder. So, the answer is E.

But looking at the options, option E is "grant, because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs." So, the remainder is vested, which makes the estate a fee simple. 

But the question is about the nephew's interest. The nephew's interest is a life estate, not a fee simple. 

Wait, maybe the issue is that the nephew's interest is fee simple absolute, which becomes a life estate in his own estate. So, the remainder is a vested remainder in his estate. 

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Another thought: the Rule in Shelley's abolished the idea that a fee simple absolute grants a life estate in the remainderman's interest. So, now, a fee simple absolute would be a life estate in the remainderman's interest. 

In this scenario, the nephew is the remainderman. So, the nephew's fee simple absolute is a life estate in the brother's interest. 

So, the nephew's interest is a life estate, not a fee simple absolute. So, he can perform. But the question is about the nephew's interest. So, the answer would be E: because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee.

Wait, no. The remainder is vested. So, the answer would be E: granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Option E says: granted because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs.

So, under the new Rule, the remainder would be a vested remainder. So, the estate is a fee simple. So, the answer is E.

So, the correct answer is E.
</think>

When a fee simple absolute is granted for a life estate to the remainderman, it becomes a life estate in the remainderman's interest. This eliminates the issue of a contingent interest, resolving the ambiguity around the remainderman's estate. The remainderman's interest is a life estate to the grantor, and the remainder is a vested remainder. Thus, the remainder in the nephew's heirs would become a vested fee, making the estate a fee simple absolute. Therefore, the nephew's interest is granted. 

ANSWER: E
