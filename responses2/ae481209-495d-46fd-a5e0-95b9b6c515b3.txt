Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about migration. Let me read the question again. The scenario is that someone is moving from their hometown to Pittsburgh, stopping in Columbus to visit a relative. They decide to stay in Columbus because they love the city. The question is about what this is an example of, with options from A to J.

Hmm, let's start by understanding each term. The options are: intervening opportunity, periodic movement, forced migration, distance decay, push-pull factors, step migration, involuntary migration, transnational migration, cyclical movement, chain migration.

Wait, the question is about moving from one place to another, not a continuous movement. So options like periodic movement or cyclical movement might be related but not exactly the same. I remember that periodic movement is when people move in batches, perhaps every few years, which might fit if they were moving regularly for family reasons. But that's not exactly what the question is aboutâ€”just stopping in once.

Involuntary migration is when a person moves for personal reasons without any family ties, right? That could fit because the person was in love and decided to stay. So involuntary migration would be when someone moves for personal reasons, not because of family.

Transnational migration is moving across borders, not necessarily stopping in a city but visiting a relative. So maybe transnational is broader, but the question says the person stopped in Columbus and decided to stay. So perhaps it's not transnational migration.

Involuntary migration is about personal reasons without family ties. So that sounds like the case here because the person was in love and decided to stay. So involuntary migration (G) would be the correct choice.

Wait, but what about other options? Let's see. Forced migration would be when someone is forced to move across a border, for example, because of some legal or political reason. That's more about forced action across borders, not personal reasons.

Step migration seems related to moving in steps, but it's more about stepping stones in a migration path.

Cyclical movement is like seasonal migration, like people moving more in the summer when spring arrives.

Distance decay is about how the likelihood of a migration decreases with distance. That's more about why people don't migrate far, not the cause of their decision.

Push-pull factors are internal and external factors that push or pull a person to go or stay. For example, family, friends, and travel costs. The person is pulling them to stay because of love, which is a personal push.

So the scenario is that the person decided to stay in Columbus because they love it. That's a personal decision to stay, not based on family or other factors. involuntary migration is about personal reason without family ties. So involuntary migration (G) fits.

The scenario involves a person deciding to stay in Columbus, Ohio, despite being in love with it, which is a personal decision. This aligns with involuntary migration, where a person moves without family ties.

**Answer: G**
