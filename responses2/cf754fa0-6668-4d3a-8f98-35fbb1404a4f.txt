Okay, so I have this physics question here about the photoelectric effect and electron ejection from different subshells in chlorine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that neutral atoms of chlorine are bombarded by high-energy photons, causing electrons to be ejected from various filled subshells. I'm supposed to find out which subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity after being ejected.

Wait, I remember that the photoelectric effect involves photons with enough energy to overcome the work function of the material. Electrons are ejected from the atoms, and the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons depends on the frequency of the incident light and the work function of the material. Since chlorine is a metal, its work function is about the same as that of other metals, but I'm not exactly sure what it is. Oh, right, the work function for most metals is around 5 eV. But maybe I don't need the exact value because the question is about the velocity of the electrons.

Electrons are ejected from filled subshells. Oh wait, filled subshells are the ones that are already filled with electrons before the ejection happens. So each subshell can hold a certain number of electrons, and when electrons are ejected, the ones from the highest energy subshell would be the ones with the highest kinetic energy, right?

Wait, the velocity of the electrons depends on their kinetic energy. The formula for kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Since mass m is constant for all electrons (same m), higher velocity implies higher kinetic energy. So the electron with the highest velocity would be the one with the highest kinetic energy.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The maximum kinetic energy of the electron is given by the equation K.E. = hf - φ, where φ is the work function. So the higher the frequency of the photon, the higher the maximum kinetic energy. But the question is about which subshell's electrons are being ejected. Wait, but in this case, the question is about which subshell's electrons are being ejected. So the electrons are being ejected from the subshells in order of their energy levels.

Wait, the electrons are being ejected from the filled subshells. So the order of subshells would be filled in the order of increasing energy levels, right? For example, the 1s subshell is filled first, then 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 4p, 5s, 5p, 4d, 5d, etc. But wait, chlorine has an atomic number of 17, so its electron configuration is [Ar] 4s¹ 3d¹ 5s²? Wait, no, actually, I think I should write it correctly.

Wait, the electronic configuration of chlorine is [Ar] 3d¹ 4s². So the filled subshells are 3d and 4s. But wait, electrons are ejected from these filled subshells, so which ones are being considered here.

Wait, no, the question says the ejection happens from the filled subshells. So for each subshell, the electrons from that subshell are being ejected. So the question is about which filled subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity upon ejection.

Wait, but all filled subshells are being considered. For each filled subshell, the electrons are being ejected, and their velocity is determined by the energy required to eject them (their kinetic energy). So the higher the energy of the photon, the higher the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.

Hmm, but the question is about the velocity, not the energy. So if two electrons are being ejected from different subshells, which one has higher velocity?

I think the key here is that the maximum kinetic energy is determined by the energy of the photon. So the higher the energy of the photon, the higher the kinetic energy, hence higher velocity.

But wait, the question is about the maximum velocity. So the highest velocity comes from the highest energy electrons being ejected. So which subshell's electrons are the highest in energy? Or perhaps, which subshell has the highest n? Because higher n means higher energy levels.

Wait, let me think. The kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity. The maximum velocity would be for the electron with the highest kinetic energy, which comes from the highest possible photon energy.

But the question is about which subshell's electrons are being ejected. So, the subshells are filled before any ejection. So the 3d and 4s subshells would be filled first. Wait, no, in terms of filling, the 1s is filled first, then 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d comes after 4s, then 4p, 5s, 4d, etc. So chlorine has electrons in 3d and 4s.

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, it excites electrons from the inner shells to outer ones. So the electron configuration of chlorine is [Ar] 4s¹ 3d¹. So when a photon is absorbed, electrons from 3d and 4s are excited.

But the question is about the ejection of electrons from the filled subshells. So which subshell is being considered for ejection? Probably the ones that are filled, so 3d and 4s.

But the question is asking which subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity. Since higher energy (higher frequency) photon leads to higher KE. So, to eject an electron from a higher subshell, the photon must have enough energy.

Wait, but the question is which filled subshell's electrons are being ejected. So the maximum velocity would be from the electron with the highest energy, which is from the subshell with highest n. So, the 4s subshell has n=4, and 3d has n=3. So among the options, the 4s and 3d are filled.

Wait, but the question says, "electrons originally from which subshell would have the highest velocity after being ejected?" So which subshell's electrons are being ejected, and which one has the highest velocity.

Wait, but perhaps the higher energy is determined by the subshell's position. For example, 4s is higher in energy than 3d. So if a photon has enough energy to eject an electron from 4s, it would have higher velocity.

Wait, but in the case of chlorine, the valence electrons are in 4s, so when electrons are ejected from filled subshells, perhaps 4s is the one being considered. But wait, the 4s is filled, so when the photon's energy is just enough to eject an electron from 4s, that's the maximum.

But wait, the 4s is lower in energy than 3d. So an electron in 3d would have higher energy than one in 4s, so to eject an electron from 3d, the photon must have energy equal to the work function plus the 3d ionization energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the ionization energy is a factor here.

Wait, perhaps the maximum velocity occurs when the electron is from the subshell with the highest possible n that can be ejected. So if the photon's energy is enough to eject electrons from all filled subshells, but the one with the highest n would have the highest velocity.

Wait, but in the case of chlorine, the filled subshells are 3d and 4s. So if the photon's energy is sufficient to eject electrons from both, which one would have higher velocity? Because the 4s subshell is lower in energy than 3d, so the 4s electrons would have lower velocity.

Wait, but the work function of chlorine (φ) is about 5 eV. Let's say the photon's energy is higher than that. So, the maximum velocity would come from the 4s subshell because it's the innermost filled subshell, but wait, the 4s is lower in energy than 3d. Hmm, but the 3d is higher. So the 3d electrons have higher energy than 4s.

Wait, but the maximum velocity comes from the electron with the highest energy. So if a photon's energy is just enough to eject an electron from 4s, the velocity would be high. But if the photon's energy is higher, it could eject electrons from higher subshells.

Wait, but the question is about the velocity after being ejected. So in the case where the photon's energy is higher than the ionization energy of the 4s, then the 4s electrons would have even higher energy, hence higher velocity. So the 4s subshell's electrons would have higher velocities than the 3d's.

But wait, the options include 3d and 4s. So the question is which subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity. So the answer would be option G, which is 5s. Wait, no, because chlorine's configuration is 4s¹ 3d¹. So the filled subshells are 3d and 4s.

Wait, but the options are A to J, with options G being 5s, etc. Wait, the options are:

A:1s
B:5p
C:4d
D:2s
E:2p
F:4s
G:5s
H:4p
I:3d
J:3p

So among these, the filled subshells are 3d and 4s. So the question is, which of these would have the highest velocity, so the one with higher energy.

The energy of an electron in a subshell depends on the principal quantum number n. The higher n, the higher the energy. Because higher n means higher n², hence higher energy.

Wait, but wait, the energy of the subshell is determined by n. So the 4s subshell has n=4, and 3d has n=3. So the 4s has higher energy than 3d. Wait, but 3d is higher in energy than 4s? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the order of subshells for maximum energy is 4s (n=4) comes before 3d (n=3) because n=4 is higher. So 4s is higher in energy than 3d.

So the 4s electrons would have higher energy than 3d. So if the photon's energy is higher than the ionization energy of 4s, then 4s electrons would be ejected, and their velocity would be higher than those from 3d.

Wait, but wait, the work function is involved. The work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron. So if the photon's energy is just enough to eject an electron from 4s, then 4s electrons would have the maximum velocity, because they are the ones that can be ejected with the maximum energy.

But wait, the photoelectric effect formula is K.E. = hf - φ. For each electron, that's their kinetic energy.

But the question is about the electrons from which subshell. So the higher the energy, the higher the velocity. So the 5s subshell's electrons would have the highest energy, but 5s comes after 4s and 3d, so 3d would have lower n and thus lower energy than 4s.

Wait, but chlorine is in the 3d and 4s. So the 3d would be filled. So when a photon is absorbed, it can eject electrons from 3d and 4s. The one with the highest energy would be from 4s. So the 4s electrons would have the highest velocity.

But wait, the options don't have 3d and 4s. Wait, the options include 3d and 4s as possible. So the question is, which of these has the highest velocity. Because 4s is higher than 3d, 4s would have higher velocity.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is 5s, which is higher than 4s. So the 5s electrons would have higher velocities than 4s. So, the 5s electrons would have higher velocity. But why would that be the case?

Ah, because a higher n could imply higher energy, leading to higher velocity, but wait, the energy depends on n². So 5s has n=5, so n²=25. 4s has n=4, n²=16. So 5s has higher energy than 4s, which in turn has higher than 3d (n=3: n²=9). So 5s would have higher energy than 4s, which would have higher than 3d.

Wait, but the question is which subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity. So the 5s electrons would have the highest velocity because their energy is highest.

But wait, wait, I'm getting confused. The question is about which subshell's electrons are being ejected. The number of filled subshells is 3d and 4s. So for the ejection of electrons, the 4s would have higher energy than 3d.

But wait, the initial question says that the ejection occurs from which subshell after being filled. Oh, perhaps the filled subshells are 3d and 4s. So when a photon is absorbed, electrons are ejected from these. But the question is about which of these would have the highest velocity.

So which of these (3d or 4s) would have the highest velocity? The higher the energy, the higher the velocity.

So 4s has higher energy than 3d. So the 4s electrons would have higher velocity.

But wait, looking at the options, 4s is option F, and 5s is G.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum velocity. So among all the options, the one with the highest n would be 5s, which would have higher energy and thus higher velocity. So the 5s subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity.

But wait, the options given don't include 3d or 4s, or 5s. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:1s

B:5p

C:4d

D:2s

E:2p

F:4s

G:5s

H:4p

I:3d

J:3p

So, the options include 3d (I), 4s (F), 5s (G). So the 5s subshell is filled, and the 4s is filled.

So, which of these will eject electrons? Well, the 4s is filled, so its electrons are being ejected, as are the 3d. The 5s is also filled, so its electrons would be ejected with higher energy.

But wait, if the photon's energy is just enough to eject an electron from 4s, then the 4s electrons would have higher velocity than 3d, but the 5s would have even higher.

Wait, but wait, in the photoelectric effect, the maximum kinetic energy is determined by the energy of the photon and the work function. So the higher the photon's energy, the higher the KE. So the 5s electrons would have higher energy (higher n) than 4s, so higher velocity.

So, the 5s electrons would have the highest velocity. So the answer would be G:5s.

But I'm a bit unsure because I remember that in the photoelectric effect, higher energy photons eject electrons with higher energy, which implies higher velocity. So the 5s subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity.

So the correct answer is G:5s.

To determine which subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity after being ejected by high-energy photons, we analyze the photoelectric effect. The maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons is given by the equation:

\[
K.E. = hf - \phi
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( f \) is the frequency of the photon, and \( \phi \) is the work function of the material. The velocity of the electrons is directly proportional to their kinetic energy, so the electron with the highest velocity will have the highest kinetic energy.

The question specifies that electrons are ejected from "filled subshells." For chlorine, the electronic configuration is \([ \text{Ar} ] 4s^1 3d^1\), meaning the filled subshells are \(4s\) and \(3d\). However, the question asks about the subshell whose electrons would have the highest velocity after being ejected. This depends on the energy of the incident photon, which determines the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.

The energy of a subshell is determined by its principal quantum number \(n\), with higher \(n\) corresponding to higher energy (and thus higher velocity for the ejected electrons). Among the options provided:

- \(n = 4\) corresponds to \(4s\),
- \(n = 5\) corresponds to \(5s\),
- \(n = 3\) corresponds to \(3d\).

The energy of a photon increases with \(n^2\). Therefore, the \(5s\) subshell has the highest energy, followed by \(4s\), then \(3d\), and so on. Since the question asks for the subshell whose electrons would have the highest velocity, the \(5s\) electrons would have the highest velocity due to their higher energy.

Thus, the correct answer is:
