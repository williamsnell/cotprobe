Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Wendt's three cultures of anarchy. Hmm, I remember Wendt's three main cultures, but I need to focus on the Lockean culture. Wait, what's Lockean culture again? Oh right, I think it's one of the three. So the question is asking which option defines Lockean culture.

I should probably recall what each of these cultures entails. Wendt's three cultures are usually categorized as General, Tactician, and Lockean. The Lockean culture is known for self-reliant behavior. Let me think about each option.

Option A says a culture where force and violence are eschewed for cooperation in security. That sounds like the lockean because it's about self-reliance and no external intervention. But wait, the Lockean culture is about not trusting others and relying on your own military. Wait, no—Wait, no, the lockean culture is about self-reliant and not seeking help. So option D says 'complete distrust, actors rely on their own military for survival.' That fits. Because lockean is self-reliant, so no external help. So D seems correct.

Option B is about complete self-reliant actors. That's more like the General culture, which is self-reliant but perhaps with more trust. So B is not Lockean.

Option C says survival depends on military power, security dilemmas, and security as zero-sum. That sounds like the Tactician culture, which focuses on tricks and deception.

Option D is about self-reliance, no help. So that's Lockean.

Option E is actors regard each other as threats and don't resort to violence. That's the Tactician's opposite; instead, they might try to avoid conflict. Wait, no—Tactician is about deception and deception. Lockean is self-reliant, so E is Tactician.

Option F: mutual understanding without military power. That sounds like the General culture, which is self-reliant but uses trust. So F is General.

Option G: rivalry dominated, actors see each other as rivals but restraints. So that's the Lockean culture because Lockean is self-reliant, so they don't rely on others.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the Lockean culture. So the Lockean culture is characterized by self-reliant behavior. So looking for an option that says 'complete distrust' and 'only rely on their own military power'.

Looking at options, D says actors are completely self-reliant and don't seek help. That's the Lockean culture. F says mutual understanding without military power, which is the General. Wait, no—F is about mutual understanding, so it's General. G is rivalry with some restraint, which is lockean because they don't rely on others.

Wait, the Lockean culture is self-reliant, so no reliance on others. So the lockean culture is the one that says no one else's help. So looking at the options, D says 'complete distrust' which implies no reliance on others. So D is correct.

Wait, but another option is G, which is rivalry with some restraint. Oh, because G says 'rivalry dominated since the beginning of modern systems, actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence.'

Wait, but G is the third culture, the Lockean. So G's description is about rivalry but with some restraint. So that's Lockean.

Wait, but the question is about what defines the Lockean culture. So both D and G seem to describe Lockean. So I need to pick which one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

D: actors are completely self-reliant and do not seek help from others.

G: actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence.

So the Lockean culture is about self-reliance and no reliance on others, so D is correct.

Wait, but wait again. Maybe I should think about Wendt's three cultures. The three are:

1. General: self-reliant, no help, rely on trust.

2. Tactician: self-reliant, use deception, avoid conflict.

3. Lockean: self-reliant, no help, rely on their own military.

So the Lockean culture is self-reliant and no reliance on others. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options. Option D is 'A culture in which actors are completely self-reliant and do not seek help from others.' That matches Lockean.

Option G says 'a culture within which survival relies on military power, security dilemmas, and security is a zero-sum game.' That's the Tactician culture.

So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is **D: A culture in which actors are completely self-reliant and do not seek help from others.**

**Explanation:**
Wendt's three cultures of anarchy are categorized as General, Tactician, and Lockean. The Lockean culture is characterized by self-reliance and reliance on their own military without seeking help. Option D aligns with this description, as it states that actors are completely self-reliant and do not seek help from others, fitting the Lockean culture definition.
