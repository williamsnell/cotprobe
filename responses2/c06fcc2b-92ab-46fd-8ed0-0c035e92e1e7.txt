Okay, so I've got this problem about sampling and signal processing. Hmm, let's see. I remember that Nyquistrate is a term I've heard before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Oh wait, Nyquist rate. Oh right, it's about how quickly you can sample a signal without losing information. The Nyquist theorem states that the sampling frequency should be at least twice the maximum frequency of the signal. 

The question says that 2000 signals are sampled at a certain frequency, given by the function S(t) which is a sum of delta functions spaced at intervals of 1/f_s. So the sampling period is T_s, which is the time between samples. I think T_s is the reciprocal of f_s, so f_s = 1/T_s. 

Each signal has a bandwidth of 5 kHz. Wait, what's the relationship between the signal's bandwidth and the sampling frequency? I think when you sample and time-division multiplex, you have to make sure that the sampling rate is higher than twice the highest frequency present in all the signals. But wait, each signal has 5 kHz bandwidth. Oh, but the maximum frequency in a signal is half its bandwidth, right? Because the bandwidth is twice the highest frequency (assuming it's a symmetric signal around zero). So for a 5 kHz bandwidth, the highest frequency is 2.5 kHz. Therefore, to avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency needs to be at least twice that, so 5 kHz. But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's the Nyquist rate. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the problem is that each signal's maximum frequency is 5 kHz, so the sampling frequency must be higher than twice that. So the minimum f_s is 10 kHz. So T_s would be 1/10 kHz = 100 milliseconds, which is 1e-2 s. But looking at the options, option B is T_s=1e-2, and the tau_max is 0.5e-5 sec. Hmm, maybe that's not the only consideration.

Wait, the question also asks for tau_max, which is the maximum pulse duration in the time-division multiplexing. I think that's the time during which the pulses are active. I remember that for time-division multiplexing with N signals, the pulses are spaced by the inter-symbol time, which is T_s, and each symbol is a pulse of duration tau. The inter-symbol time should be at least equal to the pulse duration to prevent overlapping. So the inter-symbol time is T_s, and the pulse duration tau_max must be less than T_s/2 to prevent overlap. Because if the pulse lasts longer than T_s/2, the next pulse would start overlapping with the previous one. Or is it T_s? Wait, when you have symbols spaced T_s apart, each symbol is a pulse that can't overlap with the next. So the pulse duration must be less than T_s. So, tau_max < T_s. But the question gives us tau_max, so maybe it's T_s/2. Let me think. 

Wait, another approach: the symbol duration is the time between the start of one pulse and the start of the next. So for a symbol duration, since each pulse is separated by T_s, the maximum pulse duration can't be more than T_s/2. Because if you have a pulse that lasts T_s, then the next pulse starts at T_s, which is immediately after the previous, leading to overlapping. So tau_max should be less than T_s/2. But in the problem, each signal is a pulse, and they're time-division multiplexed. So each pulse is separated by T_s. So each pulse has a duration of tau. To prevent overlapping, the sum of the pulse duration and the inter-pulse spacing must be less than or equal to T_s. Wait, no, perhaps the inter-pulse spacing is T_s, and the symbol duration is tau. So to prevent overlapping, the symbol duration plus the spacing must be less than or equal to the symbol time. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the inter-symbol time (the time between the end of one pulse and the start of the next) should be at least equal to the pulse duration. So the inter-symbol time is T_s, and the pulse duration is tau. So for no overlapping, T_s must be >= tau. So tau_max is up to T_s. Wait, but that can't be right because the options have tau_max much smaller than T_s. Alternatively, if the pulse is spaced by T_s, then the maximum duration before it starts overlapping is T_s/2. Because if the pulse starts at time 0, the next pulse starts at T_s. So the second pulse can't start before the first ends, right? Wait, that's the key point. So the symbol duration is the time during which a pulse is active, so it's tau. The symbol is spaced T_s apart. To avoid overlapping, the symbol duration must be less than or equal to the inter-symbol time. But wait, that's the case for non-overlapping. Wait, the inter-symbol time is the time between the end of one symbol and the start of the next. So if the symbol duration is tau, the start of the next symbol is at T_s + tau. So for the next symbol to start after the end of the current symbol, the next start time should be greater than the end time of the current symbol.

Wait, no, perhaps the end of the current symbol is at T_s * n (assuming n starts at 0). The next symbol starts at T_s*(n+1). For them not to overlap, the next symbol starts after the current symbol ends. So the next symbol starts at T_s*(n+1), which is T_s after the current symbol ends at T_s *n. So the next symbol must start after T_s *n, which is T_s after the previous symbol ends. So T_s*(n+1) >= T_s *n? No, that's just T_s >=0, which is always true. So that approach might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the pulse must end before the next symbol starts. So the pulse ends at T_s *n + tau, and the next symbol starts at T_s*(n+1). So to not overlap, T_s*(n+1) > T_s*n + tau. So T_s > tau. So the maximum tau is just under T_s. But that's a very loose condition. The problem must have a more precise approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the inter-symbol time (the time between the end of one symbol and the start of the next) must be greater than or equal to the pulse duration. Because if the inter-symbol time is equal to the pulse duration, that's the minimum, to prevent overlapping. So T_s >= tau. So for maximum tau, it's T_s. But that can't be because in the options, the maximum pulse duration is much smaller than the sampling period. So perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions of inter-symbol time and symbol duration.

Wait, wait—here's another thought. The inter-symbol time is T_s, but the symbol itself is a pulse that's active for some time. To prevent the pulses from overlapping, the pulse duration (tau) must be less than T_s. Because if the pulse is longer than T_s, then the next symbol starts after the previous one ends, but if it's shorter, then the next symbol starts before the previous ends, leading to overlap. So the maximum tau_max should be T_s - something. But in the options, the maximum pulses are much smaller than T_s. For example, option A has T_s=2e-3 sec, and tau_max=1e-6 sec. So 1e-6 is way less than 2e-3. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this reversed. Let me think again. The symbol duration (the pulse) is tau. The inter-symbol time is T_s. For the pulses not to overlap, the symbol duration must be less than the inter-symbol time. So tau < T_s. So in the options, the maximum tau is much smaller than T_s. Therefore, for this problem, the correct condition is that tau_max must be <= T_s/2. Because if the pulse is longer than T_s/2, then the next symbol starts before the current ends, causing overlap.

Wait, let me think of a simple example. Let's say the inter-symbol time is T_s. The first symbol is active for tau. The next symbol starts at T_s. So the next symbol's start time is T_s. The next symbol's end time is T_s + tau. For the two symbols to not overlap, T_s + tau <= T_s + T_s? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the next symbol can't start before the current symbol ends. So the next symbol starts at T_s, and must end at T_s + tau. The current symbol ends at T_s + tau. But the next symbol must start after T_s + tau. So the next symbol can start at T_s + tau + something, but that would be overlapping. So the next symbol's start time must be after T_s + tau. So the minimum time between the end of the current symbol and the start of the next symbol is T_s. So the next symbol starts at T_s + T_s? That can't be right. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the inter-symbol time is T_s, and the symbol is a pulse of duration tau. For the pulses to not overlap, the next symbol must start after the previous one ends. The time from the end of the current symbol to the start of the next is T_s. So the current symbol ends at T_s * n (where n is the symbol number, starting at 0). The next symbol starts at T_s * (n+1). So the next symbol starts at that time. The current symbol ends at T_s *n + tau. The next symbol starts at T_s * (n+1), which must be after the end of the current symbol. So T_s*(n+1) > T_s *n + tau. Simplifying, T_s > tau. So tau must be less than T_s. So that's the condition. So the maximum possible tau is just less than T_s, but in the options, the tau_max is way smaller than T_s. So perhaps I'm missing a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the proper condition is that the pulse duration must be less than or equal to the inter-symbol time divided by two. Because if a pulse is longer than the inter symbol time divided by two, the next symbol would start too early, leading to overlapping. So tau_max would be T_s / 2. Let me check for the options. Let's say T_s is 2e-3 (0.002 seconds). Then T_s/2 is 0.001 seconds. Looking at the options, option A has T_s=2e-3 and tau_max=1e-6, which is much smaller than 0.001. So that can't be the condition. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe I got the symbol duration and inter-symbol time mixed. Alternatively, perhaps it's the pulse duration must be less than or equal to T_s. But that would make tau_max = T_s, which isn't the case here. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem states: time-division multiplexing. Each signal has a bandwidth of 5 kHz. So each signal is a bandpass signal with a bandwidth of 5 kHz. So the maximum frequency in each signal is 2.5 kHz. So the maximum frequency f_max is 2.5 kHz. To avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency must be at least 2*f_max. So f_s >= 5 kHz. So T_s = 1/f_s <= 0.2 seconds. But looking at the options, the only T_s that is 2e-3 (0.002) is option A, and another is option B's T_s=1e-2 (0.01).

Wait, so according to this, the minimum T_s is 0.2 seconds, so any T_s less than that would lead to aliasing. So the question must have an error, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sampled signals are multiplied (time-division multiplexed) and then each is passed through a low-pass filter to reconstruct. Hmm, but the problem says the signals are sampled at Nyquistrate, then time-division multiplexed. So perhaps the sampling is at T_s, and then each signal's band is sampled at that rate, leading to each signal being a low-pass sampled version of a bandpass signal.

Wait, but perhaps each signal is band-limited. The problem states each signal has a bandwidth of 5 kHz. So for each signal to be properly sampled, the sampling frequency should be at least 2 times 5 kHz, which is 10 kHz. So T_s = 1e-3 seconds. Looking at the options, option D is T_s=1e-3, and option E is T_s=8e-5 (0.00008 s), which is longer than 0.001, leading to aliasing. So option D's T_s=1e-3 and tau_max=0.5e-5 (5e-6 s) is possible.

So the minimum T_s is 0.001 s, which is option D's T_s. But wait, the question says 'calculate T_s and determine τ_max for pulses of duration τ.' So the first part is to find T_s, which is 1/f_s. But f_s must be at least 10 kHz. So T_s is 0.001 s, which is 1e-3. So option D is T_s=1e-3, and tau_max=0.5e-5, which is 5e-6 s.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but the question gives me that each signal has a bandwidth of 5 kHz, implying that the maximum frequency is 2.5 kHz. So the Nyquist rate is 5 kHz, which would require T_s = 1/(5e3) = 0.0002 s, which is 2e-4. But wait, option C is T_s=2e-4 s, and tau_max=1e-7 s. Hmm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the Nyquistrate theorem but rather about choosing T_s such that the sampling rate is sufficient to avoid aliasing for each individual signal. So each signal is bandpass with a maximum frequency of 2.5 kHz. So to avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency should be at least 5 kHz. Therefore, T_s=1/5e3 = 0.0002 s (2e-4 s), which is option C's T_s. So option C has T_s=2e-4 and tau_max=1e-7.

But then, why would the question have the other options? Because if T_s is 2e-4, then the inter-symbol time is 2e-4 s. Each signal is sampled T_s apart, so the pulse duration can't be more than T_s/2. So 2e-4 / 2 = 1e-4 s. But looking at the options, option C's tau_max is 1e-7, which is much smaller than 1e-4. So that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the pulse duration must be less than T_s / 2 to prevent overlapping. So for option C, T_s=2e-4, so 2e-4/2=1e-4. But the option's tau_max is 1e-7, which is much smaller than that. So perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that each signal is a bandpass signal with a bandwidth of 5 kHz. So the sampling frequency must be at least twice the bandpass bandwidth, which is 10 kHz. So T_s=0.001 s, which is option D. So in that case, the correct option would be D.

But wait, the problem says that each signal has a bandwidth of 5 kHz, which would require the sampling frequency to be at least 10 kHz, so T_s 0.001 s. So option D is T_s=1e-3 and tau_max=0.5e-5 (5e-6 s). But then, according to the Nyquistrate theorem, the correct T_s would be 0.001, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but the problem says that the signals are sampled at Nyquistrate. Hmm, perhaps the 'Nyquistrate' in the problem refers to the Nyquist rate, which would dictate the sampling frequency. So the maximum allowable sampling frequency is 10 kHz, so T_s=0.001 s. So option D's T_s is 0.001 s, which is correct. The other parameters, although I'm not sure, may be correct based on the given options.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has T_s=1e-3 and tau_max=0.5e-5. So according to the calculation, that's correct. So the answer would be option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions and apply the Nyquist theorem and relevant signal processing principles.

1. **Bandwidth and Nyquist Rate**:  
   Each signal has a bandwidth of 5 kHz, meaning the maximum frequency is 2.5 kHz. To avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the bandwidth, so \( f_s \geq 10 \, \text{kHz} \).  
   Therefore, the sampling period is \( T_s = \frac{1}{f_s} \leq \frac{1}{10 \, \text{kHz}} = 0.0001 \, \text{seconds} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s} \).  

2. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option D**: \( T_s = 1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{s} \), \( \tau_{\text{max}} = 0.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{s} \).  
     This satisfies the Nyquist condition (\( T_s = 0.001 \, \text{s} \)), and \( \tau_{\text{max}} = 0.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{s} \) is much smaller than \( T_s \), ensuring no overlapping of pulses.  

3. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the analysis, option D correctly satisfies the Nyquist condition and ensures pulse duration without overlapping.
