Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Paley's view on the contrivance of watches compared to nature. Let me start by recalling what I know about the question and Paley's philosophy.

Paley is a philosopher who dealt with the nature of human-made things, like animals and technologies. He wrote about the difference between how human-made objects are created versus natural ones. The question here is about watches and nature, specifically focusing on their contrivance.

The question says Paley maintains that the key difference between the contrivance of a watch and that of nature is that the latter is _____. The options are A to J, each with a different description.

I remember Paley's distinction between natural and artificial. He thought that natural things are more dependent on human intervention. So, natural processes are less controllable and more complex, while artificial ones are designed and controlled by humans. 

Looking at the options, option B says "more natural." That would align with Paley's idea that nature is more complex and less controllable because it's not created by humans. Alternatively, option H is "not created by human hands," which also suggests that natural things aren't human-made, hence more natural.

Wait, which one is correct? Paley's distinction is that natural things are more complex and less scientific because they're not created by humans. So, "more natural" might not be the best choice. Alternatively, Paley might say that natural things are more dependent on human intervention, which would make the correct answer option B: more natural.

Let me make sure. Paley's "more natural" implies that nature is less scientific and more complex because it's not the result of human action. So the latter (nature) is more natural in this context.

The correct answer is B: more natural.

Paley argued that natural things are more complex and less dependent on human intervention, making them "more natural" compared to the contrivance of watches, which are designed by humans. 

Answer: B
