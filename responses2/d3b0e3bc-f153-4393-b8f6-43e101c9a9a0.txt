Question:

A man brought a federal diversity action against his insurance company, alleging that the company had breached its duty under his insurance policy by refusing to pay for his medical expenses resulting from a mountain-biking accident. At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy cov-ered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's Òunduly riskyÓ behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness. After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: Yes, because the company's uncontradicted evidence of the man's unduly risky behavior means that no reason-able jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.
B: No, because the company did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the man's behavior was unduly risky.
C: No, because the signs warning bikers not to enter were not part of the insurance policy.
D: No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief.
E: Yes, because the man failed to cross-examine the company's witness.
F: Yes, because the company provided evidence of a policy clause excluding unduly risky behavior.
G: Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the Òunduly riskyÓ policy provision in his case-in-chief.
H: No, because the man had paid all his premiums on the insurance policy.
I: No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.
J: Yes, because the man did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the company breached its duty.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a federal diversity action. The man is suing his insurance company for not paying for medical expenses after a mountain biking accident. The insurance policy he used covers personal injury-related medical expenses. But under the policy, if the driver is "unduly risky" in their behavior, they can't claim those expenses. The man presented evidence that he paid all the premiums, the policy covers his injuries, and there was a witness who said the accident was in a safe area with posted signs advising not to enter. 

The company moved for judgment as a matter of law, meaning they're asking the court to decide it's a clear case. The question is whether the court should grant this motion.

Hmm, let's break this down. The company's main argument is that the policy has a provision that excludes payment for injury-related expenses from someone who's unduly risky. The man's behavior wasn't addressed in the policy, so the court is thinking that the insurance company is liable because the man is "unduly risky." 

I remember that in federal court, the plaintiff can argue that a policy's terms are clear and binding under the law. The policy was part of his insurance policy, so it's in the court's jurisdiction. The company's evidence includes the facts about the accident location and the witness's statement. The witness said the accident was in a place where signs warned not to enter. So the accident wasn't risky.

Wait, but the issue here is whether the policy's exclusion applies to the man's behavior. The policy says that if the driver is unduly risky, the insurance company doesn't cover injury-related expenses. So if the man's behavior was unduly risky, the company wouldn't be liable. But in this case, the accident was in a safe area, so the risk was mitigated. 

The man didn't cross-examine the witness. So the company is probably relying on the facts presented. The man did pay all premiums, the policy covers his injuries, and the accident was in a safe area. So the policy's provisions probably don't apply because the risk was not excessive. 

Wait, but the company's witness said the accident was in an area with posted signs advising not to enter. That might mean the accident wasn't due to a risky behavior, so the policy's exclusions wouldn't apply. The man didn't have to prove that his behavior was unduly risky because the accident was safe. 

So the company's argument is that because of the policy's wording, they are liable. But the man didn't cross-examine the witness or present evidence that he was unduly risky. He did pay all premiums and the policy covered his injuries. So the man's lack of evidence suggests that the policy's provisions didn't apply. 

So the company is arguing that the policy's exclusions apply because of the man's behavior, which he didn't prove. Therefore, the court should grant the motion because the company's evidence shows the policy's provisions were in effect. 

Looking at the options: 

Option G says the man waived his right to rebut by not addressing the policy provision. That makes sense because the man didn't bring evidence that he was unduly risky. So the company only needs to prove that the policy applies, which it did based on the facts presented. 

Option C says the signs weren't part of the policy. But the policy explicitly includes a provision about unduly risky behavior, so that's not correct. 

Option H says he didn't provide evidence, but the man did pay all premiums, which is part of the evidence. 

Option A says the company's evidence shows no reasonable jury could find the policy covers. But the jury's conclusion would be based on the policy's language, not the facts. The fact that the accident was in a safe area might have mitigated the risk, but the policy's wording is the basis. 

Option E says the man didn't cross-examine the witness, but that doesn't affect the company's case because the witness's statement is part of the evidence, not a cross-examination. 

Option I says whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury. That's correct, but the company is arguing that the policy's provisions apply, so it's not a question of fact for the jury. The company's argument is that the policy's language is clear and applies, so the court should grant the motion. 

So the correct answer should be option G: No, because the man waived his right to rebut by not addressing the policy provision. Because the man didn't bring evidence that he was unduly risky, the company doesn't need to prove the policy applies. The company's evidence, including the accident location, supports the policy's exclusions, so the court should grant the motion.

The court should grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law because the company has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the policy excludes payment for injury-related expenses due to the accident location and the witness's statement. The man did not cross-examine the witness, did not present evidence showing he was unduly risky, and the company's evidence supports the policy's provisions. The man's lack of evidence indicates the policy applies, so the court should grant the motion.
