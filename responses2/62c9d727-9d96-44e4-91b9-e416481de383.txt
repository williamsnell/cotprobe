Okay, so I've got this problem here about successive discounts on $4,500.00. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The discounts are 20%, 15%, and 2.5%. Hmm, I need to calculate the total amount after each discount is applied one after another. 

Wait, when discounts are applied successively, each discount is taken off the remaining amount from the previous step. So, the first discount is 20%, then the next is 15% on the new amount, and then another 2.5% on that new amount.

Let me break it down. Starting with $4,500.00.

First discount: 20%. So, 20% of 4500 is 0.2 * 4500 = 900. Subtracting that, the amount after the first discount is 4500 - 900 = 3600.

Second discount: 15% on 3600. So, 15% of 3600 is 0.15 * 3600 = 540. Subtract that, and the amount becomes 3600 - 540 = 3060.

Third discount: 2.5% on 3060. Let me calculate 2.5% of 3060. 0.025 * 3060 = 76.5. Subtracting that, the final amount is 3060 - 76.5 = 2983.50.

Looking at the options, option G is $2,983.50. So that should be the answer.

The calculation involves applying each discount successively:

1. First discount (20%): 4500 - (20% of 4500) = 4500 - 900 = 3600
2. Second discount (15%): 3600 - (15% of 3600) = 3600 - 540 = 3060
3. Third discount (2.5%): 3060 - (2.5% of 3060) = 3060 - 76.5 = 2983.50

The net amount is $2,983.50, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
