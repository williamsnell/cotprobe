Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about a perfectly competitive videotape-copying industry. Hmm, sounds a bit technical, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says there are many firms in this industry. Each of these firms can copy five tapes a day at an average cost of $10 per tape. Wait, that's an average cost (AC) of $10 per tape. So for five tapes, the total cost (TC) would be 5 * $10 = $50 per day. But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem mentions that each firm must pay a royalty. Oh right, each firm's average cost is $10 per tape. So the average cost is $10 per tape, not including the royalty. But the royalty is an increasing function of total industry output, r = 0.002Q.

Wait, total industry output Q is the number of tapes produced. So the royalty per film is r per film, which depends on Q. So the total royalty per firm would be r multiplied by the number of films they produce. Oh wait, each film is a unit. So per film, the royalty is 0.002Q. But wait, wait, no. If Q is the total industry output (all firms together), then for each film, the royalty is 0.002 times Q. Because r is increasing with Q; more output means each film's royalty increases.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Each film's royalty is r per film, and r = 0.002*Q, where Q is the total industry output. So for each film produced, the royalty is 0.002*Q. But wait, Q is the total number of tapes produced by all firms. So per film, the royalty is 0.002*Q. But if each film is a unit, then the firm's total royalty is r per film times the number of films produced. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the industry has Q total tapes, and each film is a unit, then each film is one unit. So the royalty per film is 0.002*Q. So for each film, the firm pays 0.002*Q. But wait, Q is the total industry output, so if each film is one unit, then the number of films each firm produces is Q / 5, since each firm can copy five tapes a day.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. Each firm's average cost is $10 per tape. So for five tapes, the average cost is $10, so the total cost is 5 * 10 = $50. But wait, that's fixed cost per day? Or total cost? Hmm, maybe I should model the firm's total cost. So each firm's average cost (AC) is $10 per tape. So AC = TC / Q, where Q is the number of tapes produced by one firm. So TC = AC * Q = 10 * Q per day. So each firm's total cost is 10Q.

But wait, each firm must pay a royalty, which depends on Q. So the royalty per film is r per film, and r = 0.002 * Q. So for each film, the firm pays r. How many films does a firm produce? Well, each firm can produce five tapes a day, so each day, if Q is the number of tapes, each firm produces Q_film = Q /5. So the royalty per firm per day is r_film * Q_film. But wait, r is per film, so r = 0.002*Q. So the royalty per film (per day) is 0.002*Q (since Q is total industry output, which is the same as the number of tapes, and each film is one unit). So for each film, the firm pays 0.002*Q. So the total royalty per day for one firm would be 0.002*Q multiplied by the number of films per day.

Wait, number of films per day per firm: since each firm can produce 5 tapes, and Q is the total industry output, then Q = 5 * (number of films per day). So Q = 5 * q, where q is the number of tapes per firm. So q = Q /5. So the total royalty per firm per day is r * q = (0.002Q) * (Q/5). Because r is per film, which is Q/5. So that becomes 0.002Q * (Q/5) = 0.002 * Q^2 /5 = 0.0004 Q^2 per firm per day.

So the total cost for a firm is the variable cost (TC) which is 10Q, plus the royalty (0.0004 Q^2) per day. Then the average cost (AC) is (TC + Royalty) / Q. Wait, no, because Q is the number of tapes produced by the firm. So the total cost per firm is TC = (10Q) + (0.0004 Q^2), and AC is (10Q + 0.0004 Q^2) / Q = 10 + 0.0004 Q.

But wait, that seems a bit off. Because in the long run, firms will produce where AC is minimized, and in perfect competition, price equals ATC. But wait, in this case, each firm is paying a royalty, which is a cost. So the AC for the firm is (10Q + 0.0004 Q^2) / Q = 10 + 0.0004 Q. So the average cost per day is 10 + 0.0004 Q.

Wait, but why is the royalty per film r = 0.002 Q? Because Q is the total industry output, which is 5*number of films. So for each film, the royalty is 0.002 Q. So if a firm produces q films, then Q =5 q. So r = 0.002*(5 q) = 0.01 q. So r per film is 0.01 q per film. So the royalty per firm per day is r * q = 0.01 q * q = 0.01 q². So the total cost per firm per day is 10 q + 0.01 q². Then AC = (10 q + 0.01 q²) / q = 10 + 0.01 q.

But wait, this seems to be a function of q. So to find the optimal q, we set AC equal to the price, which is equal to the marginal cost (MC), but in perfect competition, price equals MC. So let's find MC.

The total cost is TC = 10q + 0.01 q². So the derivative of TC with respect to q is MC. So d(TC)/dq =10 + 0.02 q. So MC = 10 + 0.02 q.

At equilibrium, price equals MC. So P = 10 + 0.02 q.

But wait, the problem is that the value of Q is the industry output. Since each firm produces q = Q /5, the total industry output is Q =5 q. So q = Q/5.

But in this problem, the firms are in long-run equilibrium, so the price is equal to the minimum average cost and the marginal cost, which is also equal to the average cost.

So, P = AC = 10 + 0.01 q.

But also, P = MC = 10 + 0.02 q.

Wait, but that can't be right because 10 + 0.02 q = 10 + 0.01 q. That would imply 0.02 q = 0.01 q → q=0, which is not possible. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let's double-check. The royalty per film per day is r = 0.002 * Q. But Q is the total industry output, which is the same as the number of all firms' tapes. So Q =5 q, where q is the number of tapes produced by a single firm.

So the royalty per film is 0.002 * Q = 0.002 *5 q = 0.01 q. So the royalty per film is 0.01 q.

Each firm produces q films, so the total royalty per firm is 0.01 q * q = 0.01 q².

So the total cost per firm is variable cost (TC) + royalty (0.01 q²), which is 10 q + 0.01 q².

So the average cost per firm is (10 q + 0.01 q²)/q = 10 + 0.01 q.

The marginal cost (MC) is derivative of TC with respect to q: d(10 q + 0.01 q²)/dq = 10 + 0.02 q.

In perfect competition, price (P) equals marginal cost (MC). So P = 10 + 0.02 q.

But also, the average cost (AC) equals P. So AC = 10 + 0.01 q = P.

So set 10 + 0.01 q = 10 + 0.02 q.

Wait, that would imply 0.01 q = 0.02 q → 0.01 q = 0 → q=0. That doesn't make sense; the firms can't produce zero tapes.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the setup. Let me try again.

Wait, another approach: The total industry output Q is 5q, as each firm produces q tapes. The royalty per film is r = 0.002 Q. Each film's royalty is 0.002 Q. So per film, the royalty is 0.002 Q, so per firm, the royalty is 0.002 Q * q (since each film is one unit). Because Q is the total industry output, each film is a unit, so per film, the royalty is 0.002 Q * number of films per day.

Wait, number of films per day a firm produces is q, since each film is a unit. So the royalty per firm per day is 0.002 Q * q = 0.002 Q q.

But Q is 5 q (since each firm makes q tapes), so substituting:

0.002 *5 q * q = 0.01 q².

Ah, so the total royalty is 0.01 q². So the total cost is 10 q (TC?) + 0.01 q² (royalty). So the average cost per firm is (10 q + 0.01 q²)/q = 10 + 0.01 q.

So marginal cost is derivative of TC, which is d(10 q + 0.01 q²)/dq =10 + 0.02 q.

At equilibrium, price equals marginal cost. So P = 10 + 0.02 q.

But we also know that P equals average cost: P =10 +0.01 q.

So set 10 +0.02 q =10 +0.01 q → 0.01 q =0 → q=0. Hmm, that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in the total cost. If each firm's variable cost is 10 q, but perhaps I should model the average cost as including the royalty. Let's think differently. Maybe the average cost includes all costs, including royalty.

Wait, no. The problem says that each firm has an average cost of $10 per tape. Oh wait, the average cost is 10 per tape, so each tape costs 10. So each firm's AC is 10 per tape, which is 5*10 = 50 per day. But wait, that can't be right because each firm's TC is 5*10 =50 per day. But then, we have the royalty, which depends on Q, the total industry output.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's model the firm's total cost as (10 per tape) * Q_firm + royalty. But wait, Q_firm is the number of tapes produced by one firm. Each firm can make 5 tapes a day. So Q_firm=5 per day.

So for each firm, TC = (10 *5) + (0.002 Q) * 5.

Wait, because the royalty is per film (each film is a unit) and Q is the total industry output. So for each film (unit) produced, the royalty is 0.002 Q. So royalty per firm is 0.002 Q * number of films per day (since each film is a unit). So number of films per day is Q /5 (since each film is one unit). So the royalty per firm is 0.002 Q * (Q/5) )= 0.0004 Q².

So TC per firm is (10 *5) + 0.0004 Q² =50 +0.0004 Q².

Average cost (AC) is (50 +0.0004 Q²) / Q =50/Q + 0.0004 Q.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if Q increases, the average cost should decrease, which it does, but let me check the math. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each firm's TC is 10 * Q + (0.002 Q * q), where q is the number of films per day. But since Q=5 q (because each firm makes q tapes), q = Q/5.

So substituting q into the royalty:

Royalty per firm =0.002 Q * (Q/5 )= 0.0004 Q².

So TC =10 Q + 0.0004 Q².

Then AC = (10 Q +0.0004 Q²)/Q =10 + 0.0004 Q.

Wait, that's a different setup. So AC =10 +0.0004 Q.

In perfect competition, price (P) equals AC, so P=10 +0.0004 Q.

But also, since each firm is a price taker, P = MC.

MC is the derivative of TC with respect to Q. TC is 10 Q + 0.0004 Q². So d(TC)/dQ=10 +0.0008 Q.

Setting P= MC:

10 +0.0004 Q =10 +0.0008 Q.

Subtract 10 from both sides:

0.0004 Q =0.0008 Q → 0.0004 Q -0.0008 Q=0 → -0.0004 Q=0 → Q=0.

That's impossible, so something is wrong. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the royalty calculation.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the royalty is per film, which is 0.002 Q. But the number of films a firm produces is Q/5. So the total royalty per day for a firm is 0.002 Q * (Q/5) =0.0004 Q².

So TC is 10 Q + 0.0004 Q².

So MC is d(TC)/dQ =10 + 0.0008 Q.

Set P=MC, and also P= AC= (10 Q +0.0004 Q²)/Q =10 +0.0004 Q.

So set 10 +0.0004 Q =10 +0.0008 Q → 0.0004 Q =0.0008 Q → which again leads to Q=0. Not possible. So I must have a fundamental misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each firm's royalty is 0.002 times the number of tapes produced by the entire industry. So if the industry produces Q tapes, each film has a royalty of 0.002 Q.

But each film is one tape. So per firm, their number of films is Q/5. So the total royalty is 0.002 Q * (Q/5) )= 0.0004 Q².

So the same as before.

But then, in that case, the TC is 5*10 + 0.0004 Q² → 50 +0.0004 Q².

MC is 10 + 0.0008 Q.

Set P=MC and AC= P.

Previous approach led to Q=0, which is impossible, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Alternative approach: Maybe the industry is perfectly competitive, so each firm's output is such that P = MC, and the industry's output Q is 5q, where q is the number of tapes per firm.

So for each firm, P = MC.

So, P=10 +0.0008 Q.

But also, since Q=5 q, and each firm produces q tapes, so q=Q/5.

So P=10 +0.0008 *5 q =10 + 0.004 q.

Wait, but we also have that P= AC. AC= (50 +0.0004 Q²)/Q.

Substituting Q=5q, AC = (50 +0.0004*(5 q)^2 )/ (5q) )= (50 + 0.0004*25 q² )/(5 q)= (50 + 0.01 q² ) / (5 q) = 10/(q) + (0.01 q²)/(5 q) )= 10/q + 0.002 q.

So AC = 10/q + 0.002 q.

Set this equal to MC, which is 10 +0.0008 *5 q → 10 +0.004 q.

So:

10/q + 0.002 q = 10 + 0.004 q.

Multiply both sides by q to eliminate the denominator:

10 +0.002 q² =10 q +0.004 q².

Bring all terms to one side:

10 +0.002 q² -10 q -0.004 q² =0 → 10 -10 q -0.002 q²=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

-10 +10 q +0.002 q² =0 → 0.002 q² +10 q -10 =0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of q. Let's solve it using the quadratic formula.

q = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=0.002, b=10, c=-10.

So,

q = [ -10 ± sqrt(100 -4*0.002*(-10) ) ]/(2*0.002)
