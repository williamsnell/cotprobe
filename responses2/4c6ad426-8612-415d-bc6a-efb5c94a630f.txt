Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the volume of a rectangular box in cubic centimeters and then convert that to liters. Hmm, I remember that volume is length times width times height. But wait, the given dimensions are in inches, right? So I need to convert inches to centimeters first. 

Wait, I think the conversion factor is 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters. Right, that's a standard one. So each dimension is in inches, so I have to multiply each by 2.54 to get centimeters. 

The box is 5 inches wide, 8 inches long, and 6 inches deep. So let me write that down. 

First, calculate the volume in cubic inches. Volume is width x length x depth. So 5 * 8 * 6. Let me do that multiplication. 5 times 8 is 40, and 40 times 6 is 240. So 240 cubic inches. 

But the question asks for the volume in cubic centimeters. So I need to convert 240 cubic inches to cm³. Since 1 inch is 2.54 cm, 1 cubic inch is (2.54)^3 cm³. Let me calculate that. 

2.54 cubed... First, 2.54 * 2.54 is about 6.4516. Then multiply by 2.54 again. 6.4516 * 2.54. Let me roughly calculate that. 6 * 2.54 is 15.24, 0.4516 * 2.54 is about 1.150. So adding them gives around 16.39 cm³ per cubic inch. 

So 240 cubic inches * 16.39 cm³/in³. Let me compute that. 240 * 16 is 3840, 240 * 0.39 is about 93.6. So total is 3840 +93.6= 3933.6. So approximately 3933.6 cc. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is option J, which is 3936 cc, that's spot on.

Now I need to convert that volume to liters. I remember that 1 liter is equal to 1000 cubic centimeters. So if I have 3933.6 cc, that's 3.9336 liters. But wait, checking the options, option J says 3.936 liters. Oh, that's very close, so J is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 5x8x6 is 240 cubic inches. Each inch is 2.54 cm, so (2.54)^3 is 16.387064 cm³ per cubic inch. Multiply 240 by that: 240 *16.387064. Let me calculate this more precisely.

240 * 16 = 3840. 240 * 0.387064 is let's compute that. 0.387064 *240. 0.3 * 240 is 72, 0.08 * 240 is 19.2, 0.007064 *240 is about 1.70.

So 72 +19.2=91.2 +1.70=92.9. So total is 3840 +92.9=3932.9 cc. So 3932.9 cc, which is about 3933 cc, so the closest option is J, which is 3936 cc. 

Wait, but J has 3936, which is a bit over. The exact calculation gives 3932.9, so the options are giving 3936 as the choice. Oh, perhaps the options are rounded. So 3933 cc would align with J's 3936 when considering rounding. Or perhaps I've messed up the exact multiplication.

Wait, let me make sure about the conversion factor. One inch is exactly 2.54 cm. So yes, (2.54)^3 =16.387064 cm³ per in³. So 240 *16.387064 is 3932.9 cc, which is approximately 3933 cc. But the option J is 3936 cc. Hmm, but maybe the options are using a different approach. Oh wait, perhaps I should compute the volume in another way.

Wait another thought: sometimes when converting, you might not need to convert the entire volume. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should convert each dimension to centimeters first and then cube them.

So 5 inches is 5 *2.54 =12.7 cm. 8 inches is 8 *2.54=20.32 cm. 6 inches is 6*2.54=15.24 cm. So volume is 12.7 *20.32 *15.24 cm³. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 12.7 *20.32. Let me calculate that. 12 *20.32 =243.84, 0.7 *20.32=14.224. So total is 243.84 +14.224=258.064 cm². Then multiply by 15.24.

So 258.064 *15.24. Let's compute that. Breaking it down: 258 *15=3870, 258 *0.24=61.92, then 0.064 *15=0.96, 0.064 *0.24=0.01536. Adding all together: 3870+61.92=3931.92 +0.96=3932.88 +0.01536≈3932.896 cm³. So approximately 3932.9 cc. So again, 3932.9 cc, which is 3.9329 liters, approximately 3.933 liters. The closest option is J, which is 3936 cc, but that's a little higher. Wait, but J is 3936, which is further away than 3.933. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another approach: Let me do the multiplication more accurately. 12.7 *20.32 *15.24.

Let me compute 12.7 *20.32 first. 12 *20.32 is 243.84, 0.7 *20.32 is 14.224. So adding, 243.84 +14.224 is 258.064 cm².

Now multiply by 15.24. Let me compute 258.064 × 15.24.

Breaking it down: 
258.064 *15 = 3870.96 
258.064 *0.24 = 62.0064 
So 3870.96 +62.0064=3932.9664 cm³.

So the volume is approximately 3932.9664 cm³, which is about 3932.97 cc. Rounded to four significant figures, that's 3933 cc. But the options don't have 3933. The closest option is J: 3936 cc. Hmm, but wait, perhaps the question is using the same conversion factor but the exact calculation is 3932.9664, which rounds to 3933. So the correct answer would be approximately 3933 cc. But looking at the options, J is 3936, which is 3.936 liters. So why is that? Did I make a mistake in any step?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.00 in x 8.00 in x 6.00 in as inches, so 5*8*6=240 in³. Then multiply by (2.54)^3=16.387064 to get cm³. So 240 *16.387064 = let's calculate that more precisely. 240 *16 is 3840. 240 *0.387064= 240 *0.3=72, 240 *0.08=19.2, 240 *0.007064=1.69536. Adding these: 72+19.2=91.2 +1.69536=92.89536. So total is 3840 +92.89536=3932.89536 cc. So approximately 3932.895 cc. So when I round this to a whole number, it's 3933 cc. But none of the options have exactly 3933. The options are:

A: 3600 cc, 3.6
B: 3200, 3.2
C:4500,4.5
D:2400,2.4
E:4100,4.1
F:2500,2.5
G:3000,3.0
H:4800,4.8
I:2750,2.75
J:3936,3.936

Wait, so the options don't have 3933. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conversion.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the box is 5.00 in wide, 8.00 in long, and 6.0 in deep. So all in inches. So volume is 5*8*6=240 in³. Converted to cm³ is 240*(2.54)^3=240*16.387064=3932.89536 cm³, which is 3932.89536 cc. Rounded to nearest whole number is 3933 cc. But none of the options match. The only option that's close is J:3936 cc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Did I miscalculate 5*8*6?

Wait, 5*8 is 40, times 6 is 240. No mistake there. So perhaps the options have a mistake, but I think the correct calculation is 3932.89536 cc. Which is 3932.89536, so approximately 3933 cc. So the closest option is J:3936. But wait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given measurements are 5.00, 8.00, 6.0. So each measurement has three significant figures. So the volume should be calculated to three significant figures.

Wait, the exact value is 3932.89536, which to three sig figs is 3930. Because 3932.895 is 3933, but when you round to three sig figs, it's 3930. Because 3932.895 is 3933, but 3933 → 3930 when rounded to three significant figures? No, wait, 3930 has three sig figs, but 3932.895 is 3932.895. So rounding to three sig figs would give 3930. But that doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the options are using an approximate conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me check the options.

Option J is 3936 cc, which is 3936. So that's about 3933, but perhaps it's rounded up. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in this approach.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the math. Let me compute 5*8*6=240. Then 240*(2.54)^3. 2.54 cubed is 2.54*2.54=6.4516, then 6.4516 *2.54.

Wait, 6 *2.54 =15.24, 0.4516 *2.54= let's compute that more accurately.

0.4516 *2.54: 0.4 *2.54=1.016, 0.0516 *2.54=0.131064. So 1.016 +0.131064=1.147064. So total 6 *2.54 is 15.24, plus 1.147064 equals 16.387064 cm³ per in³.

So 240 *16.387064 = let's compute that: 240 *16=3840, 240*0.387064=92.89536. So 3840+92.89536=3932.89536. So 3932.89536 cc. So about 3933 cc. But none of the options have that. The closest is J:3936, which is 3.936 liters. So perhaps the options are approximated.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute using all the significant figures. Let me think, 5.00 is three sig figs, same for 8.00 and 6.0. So the volume should be three sig figs. So 3932.895... becomes 3930 when rounded to three sig figs. But 3930 isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the options are using a rounded value for 2.54. Maybe 2.54 is taken as 2.5 for calculation, leading to 240 * (2.5)^3 = 240 *15.625=3750. But 3750 is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is in feet, but no, the problem states inches. So perhaps the correct answer is 3933 cc, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5*8*6 in inches first, then convert to cm³.

5 inches *8 inches=40 in². 40 in² *6 in=240 in³. Multiply by (2.54)^3 gives 240 *16.387064=3932.89536, which is 3932.895 cc. Rounded to three significant figures is 3930, but the options don't have that. So the closest option is J, which is 3936. So perhaps this is the intended answer, but I'm a bit confused because 3932.895 is closer to 3933 than to 3936.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion. Let me check 2.54 cm per inch. 5 inches is 5 *2.54=12.7 cm. 8 inches is 8 *2.54=20.32 cm. 6 inches is 6 *2.54=15.24 cm.

So, volume is 12.7 *20.32 *15.24. Let me compute this again.

First, 12.7 *20.32. Let's compute 12 *20.32 =243.84, 0.7*20.32=14.224. So 243.84 +14.224 =258.064 cm².

Now multiply by 15.24. 258.064 *15 =3870.96, 258.064 *0.24 =61.93536.

Adding: 3870.96 +61.93536=3932.89536. So approximately 3932.895 cc. So 3.9329 liters. None of the options match exactly, but option J is 3936 cc (3.936 liters). So perhaps the problem expects rounding to three decimal places, but even that, 3932.895 is closer to 3933 than 3932.895 to 3933. So perhaps the intended answer is J, but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, maybe I should have used 0.000001 more.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3932.89536 as 3932.895 and round it. 3932.895 to nearest tenth is 3932.9. So 3932.9 cc. Which is 3.9329 liters. So the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is J, 3936 cc, because 3932.895 is closer to 3933 than to 3936. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate using the exact volume in cm³. Let me compute 5*8*6=240 in³. Then, 240 *16.387064=3932.89536 cc. So, 3932.89536 cc is approximately 3933 cc. So the correct answer should be 3933 cc, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is J:3936 cc, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I should check the question again. Wait, the question says 'calculate the volume in liters' but the options are different.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact conversion factor of 1 inch = 2.54 cm, but perhaps in some cases, the conversion is done using 2.54 cm = 1 inch, but I'm not sure if I made any miscalculations. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with option J as the answer, considering that it's the closest option. But I'm a bit confused because the calculation seems to point to 3932.895 cc, which is about 3933 cc, but the provided options don't have that. The closest option is J:3936 cc. So perhaps the intended answer is J, but I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conversion.

Wait another thought: Let me compute the volume in another way. Let me compute (5*8*6)=240 in³. Then, 240 in³ * (2.54 cm/inch)^3. So 240 * (2.54)^3 = 240 *16.387064 = 3932.89536 cc. So 3.9329 liters. None of the options match this. So perhaps the intended answer is J, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and pick the option that's closest to the correct answer.

Wait, but in the given options, I have to choose the correct one. So let's see, perhaps the correct answer is J:3936 cc, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and pick the option that's closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try the calculation once more.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.00 inches *8.00 inches *6.00 inches. So 5.00*8.00=40.00. 40.00 *6.00=240.00 in³. So that's correct. Now, 240.00 in³ * (2.54 cm/inch)^3.

So (2.54)^3=16.387064. So 240.00 *16.387064.

Let me compute 240 *16=3840. 240 *0.387064=92.89536. So 3840 +92.89536=3932.89536 cc. So 3932.89536 cc, which is approximately 3933 cc.

Thus, the correct volume is approximately 3933 cc, which is 3.933 liters. But none of the options match exactly. So the options provided don't have the correct answer. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise method.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the volume in cm³ directly. 

5 inches = 5 *2.54 =12.7 cm. 8 inches =8 *2.54=20.32 cm. 6 inches=6*2.54=15.24 cm.

Then, volume is 12.7 *20.32 *15.24.

Compute 12.7 *20.32 first.

12 *20.32=243.84. 0.7 *20.32=14.224. So total is 243.84 +14.224=258.064 cm².

Now, 258.064 *15.24.

Compute 258.064 *15 =3870.96. 258.064 *0.24=61.93536. So total is 3870.96 +61.93536=3932.89536 cm³. So 3932.89536 cc.

So the volume is 3932.89536 cc, which is 3.9329 liters.

So the correct answer is approximately 3.933 liters.

Looking at the options, option J is 3936 cc, which is 3.936 liters. The correct answer is approximately 3.933 liters. So option J is the closest, but perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are using an approximate value for the conversion factor. Let's try using 2.54 cm = 10.16 inches. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different conversion factor, like 1 inch = 2.54 cm, but perhaps using a different value, like 2.5 cm. Let me try that.

If 1 inch = 2.5 cm, then:

5 inches = 12.5 cm, 8 inches=20 cm, 6 inches=15 cm.

Volume is 12.5 *20 *15 = 3750 cm³, which is 3.75 liters.

But that's not matching the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of 2.54 cm = 1 inch, but perhaps using a different value, like 2.54 cm = 1 inch, but using 2.5 cm as an approximation. Then:

5 inches=12.5 cm, 8 inches=20 cm, 6 inches=15 cm.

Volume=12.5*20*15=3750 cm³=3.75 L. 

But that's not matching the options provided.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of 1 inch = 2.54 cm, but perhaps using a different conversion factor for the calculation. Let me try using 2.54 cm = 1 inch, but perhaps using 2.5 cm for the calculation. Then:

5 inches=12.5 cm, 8 inches=20 cm, 6 inches=15 cm.

Volume=12.5 *20 *15=3750 cm³=3.75 liters.

But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different conversion factor, such as 1 inch = 2.54 cm, but perhaps using 2.5 cm as an approximation. Then:

5 inches=12.5 cm, 8 inches=20 cm, 6 inches=15 cm.

Volume=12.5 *20 *15=3750 cm³=3.75 liters.

Still not matching the options.

So perhaps the problem expects the correct calculation, but the options are not correctly reflecting the exact answer. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to pick the option that is closest to the correct answer.

So, the correct answer is approximately 3933 cc, which is 3.933 liters. Among the options, option J is 3936 cc, which is 3.936 liters. So option J is the closest to the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option J: 3936 cc, 3.936 liters.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the correct calculation gives 3932.89536 cc, which is approximately 3933 cc, but the option J is 3936 cc. So perhaps the intended answer is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and pick the option that is closest. So option J is the correct choice.
</think>

The correct calculation leads to approximately 3933 cc (3.933 liters). Among the provided options, option J (3936 cc, 3.936 liters) is the closest match. 

ANSWER: J
