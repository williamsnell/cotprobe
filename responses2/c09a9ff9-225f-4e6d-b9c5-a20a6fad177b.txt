Question:

The frequency of the gene for sickle-cell anemia in African-Americans is less than that found in the people living in their ancestral home in Africa. What factors might account for this difference?

Options:

A: Sickle-cell disease is more deadly in America
B: Sickle-cell disease has been completely eradicated in America
C: The sickle-cell gene mutates at a lower rate in America
D: Genetic drift has led to a decrease in the frequency of the sickle-cell gene in African-Americans
E: Increased medical intervention in America allows individuals with sickle-cell disease to live longer and reproduce more
F: There is no difference in the frequency of the sickle-cell gene between African-Americans and their African ancestors
G: In America, the incidence of malaria is insignificant, sickle-cell genes are being diluted by normal genes and interracial marriages.
H: There is a higher survival rate for sickle-cell carriers in America
I: Sickle-cell allele is more dominant in Africa
J: The sickle-cell allele is being actively selected against in the African-American population

Okay, so I have this question about sickle-cell anemia and some factors that might account for the difference in frequencies between African-Americans and their ancestral hominins. Hmm. I remember that sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disorder that affects red blood cells, making them sickly and leading to various health issues. The gene has a dominant, sickle-shaped mutation (heterozygous carriers) that results in the disease. 

The question states that the frequency in African-Americans is lower than in their ancestral hominins. So I need to think about why that might be. Let's look at the options provided.

Option A: Sickle-cell disease is more deadly in America. Well, if the disease was deadly in America, perhaps fewer people would develop it. But the question says the frequency is lower, not necessarily lower severity. So maybe this isn't the main factor.

Option B: Sickle-cell has been completely eradicated. I don't think that's right. Sickle-cell is still very common in many African populations, even if it's less common than in some areas. Plus, the question says 'less than' found in ancestral hominins. So this might not be the correct answer.

Option C: The sickle-cell gene mutates at a lower rate in America. Oh, this seems plausible. If the mutation rate is lower, then fewer new carriers are born, leading to a lower frequency. But why is it lower? Maybe because there's a lower fertility rate, or perhaps the environment or other factors are affecting the mutation rate.

Option D: Genetic drift led to a decrease. Genetic drift refers to random changes in allele frequencies in a population. If drift occurred in a particular time period, it could lower the frequency. But I'm not sure if that's a major factor compared to other possibilities.

Option E: Increased medical intervention allows sickle carriers to live longer and reproduce more. That's a positive factor. If people with the disease can live longer, their numbers would decrease because their offspring would also have the condition. So this would actually increase the frequency, not decrease. So E is likely not the answer.

Option F: Incidence of malaria is insignificant. I'm not sure. Sickle-cell is more about the immune system, not directly about malaria. Plus, why would that influence the frequency?

Option G: In America, incidence is insignificant, and the gene is being diluted by normal genes. Wait, if the gene is being diluted, that would mean more carriers are dying off because of other factors, like the disease. But that doesn't directly explain lower frequency. Or maybe because the disease is more prevalent elsewhere. Not sure.

Option H: Higher survival rate for carriers. That would cause a higher frequency, not lower. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I: The allele is more dominant in Africa. I don't think that's the case. The allele is recessive, so that's probably not right.

Option J: The allele is being selected against. If the sickle-cell allele is being actively selected against, that would lower the frequency. But why would that happen? Selection would favor carriers, so if the carriers are being selected against, their numbers would decrease. So this seems possible.

Wait, but I'm trying to think about what factors cause lower frequency. So the mutation rate (C) or selection (J) might be a possibility, but which is more likely?

I remember that in the past, the sickle-cell allele was more common in African populations because of low fertility, which led to fewer eggs and thus fewer carriers. Also, in Africa, the mutation rate might have been lower compared to other regions. So the mutation rate in America is lower than in their hominins. So option C says the mutation rate is lower in America, which would lead to fewer carriers, so lower frequency.

Alternatively, option J says the allele is being actively selected against. If the allele is deleterious, selection would favor carriers (heterozygous) because they have the disease. So carriers would have an advantage, leading to their frequency increasing. But the question says the frequency is lower. So J is the opposite effect. So J is probably not correct.

Wait another thought: Maybe in some regions, the allele is being selected against because of other factors. But in African populations, I think the mutation rate is lower, so C is more likely.

So the main factor could be C: The mutation rate is lower in America, leading to fewer new carriers.

Alternatively, perhaps the cause is genetic drift, but I'm not sure if that's a dominant factor here. But considering the options, C and J are possibilities. I think J is about the allele being selected against, which would increase frequency, but in this case the frequency is lower, so J is probably not the reason.

So the correct answer is either C or another factor. Wait, another point: the mutation rate for sickle-cell is typically lower in African populations than in, say, Western Europe. So if C is correct, that makes sense.

Another angle: The question says the frequency is less in African-Americans than their ancestral hominins. So perhaps the hominins have a higher mutation rate. So the mutation rate in America is lower, leading to fewer carriers.

So option C is a plausible factor.

The frequency of the sickle-cell gene in African-Americans is less than in their ancestral hominins. To determine the correct answer, we analyze the factors provided:

- **Option A**: Sickle-cell disease being more deadly in America would reduce the severity but not the frequency of the disease. This is unlikely.
- **Option B**: Eradication of the disease would not explain the lower frequency, as it would not directly address why the frequency is lower.
- **Option C**: A lower mutation rate in America would result in fewer new carriers being born, thus lowering the frequency. This is plausible.
- **Option D**: Genetic drift could reduce the frequency, but it is not the most likely factor compared to mutation rates.
- **Option E**: Increased medical intervention would lead to a higher frequency, not lower, as it would allow more sickle-cell carriers to live longer.
- **Option F**: Infection by malaria is unrelated to the sickle-cell gene's frequency.
- **Option G**: An insignificant incidence and dilution by normal genes are unlikely to explain the lower frequency.
- **Option H**: A higher survival rate for carriers would increase their frequency, contradicting the scenario.
- **Option I**: The allele being more dominant is incorrect, as the gene is recessive.
- **Option J**: The allele being selected against would increase the frequency, which contradicts the scenario.
- **Option C** is the most likely answer, as a lower mutation rate in Africa would directly reduce the frequency of the sickle-cell gene.
