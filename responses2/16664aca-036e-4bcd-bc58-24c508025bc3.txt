Okay, so I've got this statistics question here about hypothesis testing. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about which combination of significance level (α) and sample size (n) gives the greatest power when testing H0: μ = 70 against Ha: μ < 70, given that the true population mean μ is 65. The options are from A to J, each with different α and n values.

Hmm, power of a test. Right, power is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. So, higher power is better because it means our test is more likely to detect a true effect when we find it, which is what we want.

I remember that the power of a test depends on several factors: the significance level (α), the sample size (n), the effect size, and the true population parameter (μ). In this case, the true μ is 65, which is 5 units below the null value of 70. So the effect size is 5/σ, but wait, I don't know the population standard deviation σ. Hmm, maybe the effect size is considered as the difference between the hypothesized mean and the true mean relative to some scale.

Wait, the effect size (d) is often calculated as (μ0 - μa)/σ, where μ0 is the null mean and μa is the alternative mean. Here, μ0 is 70, μa is 65. Wait, but since μa is less than μ0 (because Ha is μ < 70), the effect size would be (70 - 65)/σ. But since σ isn't given, perhaps the effect size is considered as the difference divided by some standard deviation, but without knowing σ, maybe the effect size is fixed, or maybe it's assumed to be fixed as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect size is a standardized measure, like the difference in means divided by the standard deviation. But without knowing σ, perhaps the effect size is considered as 5 units (since 70-65=5). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, the question is about the effect of α and n on power. So let's think about how each affects power.

Power increases with a larger sample size (n), because a larger sample gives more information and a lower standard error. Also, a higher significance level (α) gives more evidence against the null hypothesis, but it's not always directly additive because for a given true effect size, a lower α might mean you're more likely to miss the true effect (lower power), but higher α increases power for a given true effect.

Wait, but in this scenario, the true mean is below the null (μ =65 <70), so the effect is in the direction of the alternative. So when α increases, the critical region is larger, meaning more likely to reject H0, which would increase power (since we're getting a lower probability of Type II error).

Wait, but wait: Type I error is α, which is the probability of rejecting H0 when it's true. Lower α means less chance of Type I error, but perhaps also less likely to detect the effect (lower power). So higher α increases power for a given true effect, but also increases the risk of Type I error.

But in our case, since our true effect is in the direction of the alternative, increasing α might actually increase the power because we're more likely to reject H0 when the alternative is true.

Wait, let's think of an example. Suppose the true mean is 65, and the null is 70. So the effect is 5 units away. If we set a higher alpha, say 0.1 instead of 0.05, the critical value for the test would be further out, maybe even crossing our true alternative mean, making it easier to detect.

Wait, but the critical region is determined by the distribution under H0. So for a given α, the critical region is based on the null distribution. So if the sample mean is far enough away under H0, even with a lower α, the test may still have low power.

Alternatively, perhaps the power is the probability that, under Ha, the test statistic exceeds the critical value. So, if the true mean is 65, the distribution under Ha is centered there. The power is how likely our test based on H0 will reject H0 when the sample mean is 65.

Wait, but the sample mean's distribution depends on the sample size and the standard deviation. So, for a given α, a larger sample size allows for a more precise estimate, which can lead to higher power.

So, putting this together: higher α (more stringent test) might increase power for a given true effect, but also increases the risk of Type I error. However, in our scenario, since the true effect is in the direction of the alternative, a higher α would make it easier to reject H0, thus increasing power.

Wait, but let's think about how the power calculation works. The power is 1 minus beta, where beta is the probability of Type II error (failing to reject H0 when Ha is true). So, higher power is better.

So, the power depends on:

- The true effect size: which is the difference between μ0 and μa, divided by σ. But since σ is not given, perhaps it's fixed, or maybe the effect size is fixed as 5 units (since the difference is 5).

Wait, perhaps the effect size is considered to be small, medium, or large. But without knowing σ, perhaps the effect size is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect size is |μ0 - μa| / σ, but since σ isn't given, perhaps the effect size is expressed in terms of the standard error.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The standard error (SE) is σ / sqrt(n). The effect size (d) is (μ0 - μa) / SE. So, d = (70 -65) / (σ / sqrt(n)) ) = 5 * sqrt(n)/σ. Without knowing σ, perhaps the effect size is considered to be fixed. Or, since σ is unknown, perhaps the effect size is taken as 5 (the difference) divided by σ, but that's not a standard measure.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect size is considered to be 5, and the question is asking for which combination of α and n gives the best power.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that for a given effect size (d), the power increases with larger n and with higher α.

So, in this problem, the effect size is (70-65)/sigma. But since sigma isn't given, perhaps the effect size is fixed as 5 (if sigma is 1, but that's not realistic). Alternatively, perhaps the effect size is considered as 1, but I'm not certain. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect size is more important than the exact value. So, for a given μ, higher effect size (i.e., larger difference) would lead to higher power. But in this problem, the true difference is fixed at 5, so the effect size is fixed.

So, in that case, what factors affect power?

Power = 1 - beta.

Beta is the probability of Type II error, which is the probability that we fail to reject H0 when Ha is true.

Beta depends on the sample size and the significance level.

So, higher power means lower beta.

The power of a test is calculated using the non-centrality parameter (since under Ha, the distribution of the test statistic is non-central). The non-centrality parameter is μ0 - μa divided by the standard error, scaled by sqrt(n).

Wait, perhaps for a given true mean, the power can be determined by how well the test can detect it.

So, for higher sample size, the standard error is smaller, so the effect is easier to detect, which increases power.

For a higher alpha, the critical value is further out, so it's easier to reject H0, which also increases power.

So, the combination of higher alpha and larger sample size would lead to higher power.

Looking at the options, let's list the options:

A: α=0.05, n=15

B: α=0.01, n=30

C: α=0.05, n=45

D: α=0.01, n=45

E: α=0.05, n=30

F: α=0.1, n=30

G: α=0.01, n=15

H: α=0.02, n=25

I: α=0.1, n=45

J: α=0.1, n=15

So, for each option, alpha and n.

Let me think about the effect of each:

Option A: α=0.05, n=15. Small alpha, small sample size. So, low power because it's less likely to reject H0, but the sample isn't large enough to detect the effect.

Option B: alpha is 0.01 (lower alpha), n=30. Lower alpha makes it harder to reject H0, but sample size is 30. So, perhaps lower alpha but higher n is better.

Option C: alpha same as A (0.05), but n=45 (larger sample). So, this increases power.

Option D: alpha is 0.01, n=45. So, lower alpha but higher n.

Option E: alpha 0.05, n=30. So, same n as B but same alpha.

Option F: alpha 0.1, n=30. Higher alpha, but same n.

Option G: alpha 0.01, n=15. Lower alpha, small sample.

Option H: alpha 0.02, n=25. Lower alpha, small sample.

Option I: alpha 0.1, n=45. Higher alpha, higher n.

Option J: alpha 0.1, n=15. Higher alpha, small sample.

So, the options can be divided into groups based on alpha and n.

Let's think about which combination of alpha and n gives the highest power.

Power increases with higher alpha and larger n.

So, among the options, the one with the highest alpha is I (0.1), and the highest n is 45.

So, I: alpha=0.1, n=45.

Is that the best option? Let me think about the other options.

Wait, I have to compare the alpha and n values.

Option I has the highest alpha (0.1) and the highest n (45). That would give the highest power because it's the most stringent test (higher alpha) and the largest sample size (so more precise estimate, easier to detect the effect).

But wait, let me think about the effect of alpha on power. If the alternative hypothesis is true, which it is (μ=65 <70), then a higher alpha (more likely to reject H0) would mean that the Type II error is lower (higher power). So, higher alpha is better for power when the alternative is true.

So, yes, I would expect that option I has the highest power among the options.

Wait, but let's think about the other options. Option E: alpha=0.05, n=30. So lower alpha, lower n. That's worse in both aspects.

Option C: alpha=0.05, n=45. So, higher n, same alpha. So, higher power.

Option D: alpha=0.01, n=45. Lower alpha, same n. So, lower power.

Option F: alpha=0.1, n=30. Higher alpha, lower n. So, perhaps the increase in alpha outweighs the decrease in n, leading to higher power.

So, the options with higher alpha and higher n are better.

Looking at the options, I has the highest alpha (0.1) and highest n (45). So, that's the best combination.

So, the correct answer would be option I: α=0.1, n=45.

To determine the combination of significance level (α) and sample size (n) that results in the greatest power for the given hypothesis test, we analyze the factors influencing power. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (H₀) when the alternative hypothesis (Hₐ) is true. Power increases with a larger sample size (n) because a larger sample provides more precise estimates and a smaller standard error. Additionally, a higher significance level (α) increases power because it makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis, reducing the risk of Type II error (failing to reject H₀ when Hₐ is true).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Power and α**: A higher α increases power because it makes it more likely to reject H₀. For a given true effect size, higher α reduces the risk of Type II error.
2. **Power and n**: A larger sample size (n) increases power because it reduces the standard error, making it easier to detect the alternative hypothesis. With a larger sample size, the distribution of the test statistic under Hₐ becomes more concentrated, increasing the likelihood of rejecting H₀.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (α=0.05, n=15)**: Low α and small n → Low power.
- **Option B (α=0.01, n=30)**: Lower α but moderate n → Moderate power.
- **Option C (α=0.05, n=45)**: Higher n than Option A but same α → Higher power than A.
- **Option D (α=0.01, n=45)**: Lower α than B but same n → Lower power.
- **Option E (α=0.05, n=30)**: Same α as C but lower n → Lower power than C.
- **Option F (α=0.1, n=30)**: Higher α than E but lower n → Higher power than E.
- **Option G (α=0.01, n=15)**: Lower α and small n → Low power.
- **Option H (α=0.02, n=25)**: Lower α and small n → Low power.
- **Option I (α=0.1, n=45)**: Highest α and highest n → Highest power.
- **Option J (α=0.1, n=15)**: Higher α but lower n → Moderate power.

### Conclusion:
Option I (α=0.1, n=45) combines the highest significance level with the largest sample size, maximizing both power and precision. Therefore, it is the best choice for achieving the greatest power in this hypothesis test.
