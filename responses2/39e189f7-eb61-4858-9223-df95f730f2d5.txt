Okay, so I have this physics question about Coulomb's law. Hmm, Coulomb's law is the one that describes the force between two charged particles. I remember it's something like the force is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r², right? 

The question says that two charged particles are placed twice as close to each other. So the distance r is now half of what it was before. I need to figure out how the force changes. 

So, let's think about how the force depends on the distance. The force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. That means if the distance decreases by a factor of 2, the denominator becomes (2)^2 = 4. So the force would be multiplied by 4. Because F is proportional to 1/r². 

Wait, but wait, wait. The question is about the force being four times as strong. Because if you double the distance, the force decreases by a factor of 4. So the force would be four times weaker. So the original force was F, now it's F/4. So the force is four times as strong when the particles are twice as close. 

So looking at the options, option A says four times as strong. That makes sense. Let me just think again to make sure I didn't mix up any factors. Oh, wait, Coulomb's law is F = k q1 q2 / r². So if r becomes half, then it's like replacing r with r/2. So F becomes k q1 q2 / (r/2)^2, which is k q1 q2 * 4 / r². So that's 4F. Yeah, so four times as strong. 

So the correct answer is A.

According to Coulomb's law, the force between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. If the distance is doubled, the force becomes four times as strong. 

Answer: A
