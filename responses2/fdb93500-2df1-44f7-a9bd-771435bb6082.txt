Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about vapor pressure of solutions under ideal behavior. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when dealing with solutions, especially with volatile liquids, there's something called Raoult's Law that applies here. 

Wait, Raoult's Law says that the vapor pressure of a component in a solution is proportional to its mole fraction. Oh right, for ideal solutions, it's simple. The formula is P = x * P^0, where x is the mole fraction and P^0 is the pure component's vapor pressure.

The question gives me the vapor pressures of benzene and hexane at 303 K. Benzene's vapor pressure is 120 Torr, and hexane's is 189 Torr. And the mole fraction of benzene is 0.28. So I need to find the total vapor pressure of the solution.

Wait, wait. How do I approach this? Oh, right, the mole fraction of benzene is 0.28, so the mole fraction of hexane must be 1 - 0.28, which is 0.72. Because mole fractions add up to 1.

So, the vapor pressure of benzene in solution would be x_benzene * P^0_benzene. Similarly, for hexane, it's x_hexane * P^0_hexane. Then add them together for the total vapor pressure.

Let me compute each part. Benzene's contribution: 0.28 * 120. Let me do that. 0.28 * 120. 0.28 * 100 is 28, 0.28 *20 is 5.6. So 28 +5.6 = 33.6 Torr.

Hexane's contribution: 0.72 *189. Hmm, 0.7 *189 is 132.3, and 0.02 *189 is 3.78. So 132.3 +3.78 = 136.08 Torr.

Adding both contributions: 33.6 +136.08 = 169.68 Torr. Approximately 170 Torr.

Looking at the options, option A is 170 Torr. So the answer should be A.

To calculate the vapor pressure of the solution, we use Raoult's Law, which states that the vapor pressure of a component in a solution is proportional to its mole fraction. The formula for the total vapor pressure of the solution is:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = x_{\text{benzene}} \cdot P^0_{\text{benzene}} + x_{\text{hexane}} \cdot P^0_{\text{hexane}}
\]

Given:
- \( x_{\text{benzene}} = 0.28 \)
- \( P^0_{\text{benzene}} = 120 \, \text{Torr} \)
- \( x_{\text{hexane}} = 1 - x_{\text{benzene}} = 0.72 \)
- \( P^0_{\text{hexane}} = 189 \, \text{Torr} \)

First, calculate the contribution of benzene:
\[
x_{\text{benzene}} \cdot P^0_{\text{benzene}} = 0.28 \cdot 120 = 33.6 \, \text{Torr}
\]

Next, calculate the contribution of hexane:
\[
x_{\text{hexane}} \cdot P^0_{\text{hexane}} = 0.72 \cdot 189 = 136.08 \, \text{Torr}
\]

Add the contributions together to find the total vapor pressure:
\[
P_{\text{total}} = 33.6 + 136.08 = 169.68 \, \text{Torr} \approx 170 \, \text{Torr}
\]

From the options provided, the closest match is **170 Torr**.
