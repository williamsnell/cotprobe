Question:

A farmer wants to know whether a new fertilizer has increased the mean weight of his apples. With the old fertilizer, the mean weight was 4.0 ounces per apple. The farmer decides to test H0: μ = 4.0 ounces versus Ha : μ > 4.0 ounces, at a 5 percent level of significance, where μ = the mean weight of apples using the new fertilizer. The weights of apples are approximately normally distributed. The farmer takes a random sample of 16 apples and computes a mean of 4.3 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. Which of the following gives the p-value for this test?

Options:

A: P(Z > 2)
B: P(Z < 2)
C: P(Z > 2) with 16 degrees of freedom
D: P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom
E: P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom
F: P(Z < 1.5)
G: P(Z > 1.5)
H: P(t > 1.5) with 15 degrees of freedom
I: P(t < 2) with 16 degrees of freedom
J: P(t < 1.5) with 15 degrees of freedom

Okay, so here's this question about the farmer testing a new fertilizer on apples. I need to figure out the p-value for the hypothesis test. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the old fertilizer had a mean weight of 4.0 ounces. The fresh new fertilizer is what they're testing. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean weight μ is still 4.0 ounces. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that the mean is greater than 4.0 ounces, so it's a one-tailed test. They're using a 5% significance level, which means alpha (α) is 0.05.

The farmer took a random sample of 16 apples, found the mean weight to be 4.3 ounces and the standard deviation as 0.6 ounces. So, he's using a t-test because the standard deviation is given, not the population standard deviation. But wait, since the sample size is 16, the degrees of freedom (df) would be 15.

The test is about whether the new fertilizer increases the mean. So, it's a one-tailed test where we're looking for an increase. The test statistic is a t-value because we don't know the population standard deviation.

The formula for the t-statistic is (sample mean - population mean)/(standard error). The standard error is the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. So, plugging in the numbers:

t = (4.3 - 4.0) / (0.6 / sqrt(16)).

Calculating the denominator: sqrt(16) is 4, so 0.6/4 is 0.15. The numerator is 0.3 ounces. So t = 0.3 / 0.15 = 2. So the t-statistic is 2.

Now, the question is about the p-value. Since it's a one-tailed test (μ > 4.0), the p-value is the probability that the t-statistic is greater than 2. The t-distribution has 15 degrees of freedom because n-1 = 15. So, we're looking for P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom.

Looking at the options:

A: P(Z > 2) — that's the standard normal distribution. But we're using a t-test here, so this is incorrect.

B: P(Z < 2) — same as A, but a different tail. Still wrong.

C: P(Z > 2) with 16 df — no, because sample size is 16, so 15 degrees of freedom.

D: P(t > 2) with 15 df — yes, this matches our calculation.

E: P(t < 2) with 15 df — no, because we're looking for t > 2, not <.

F: P(Z < 1.5) — not relevant.

G: P(Z > 1.5) — same issue.

H: P(t > 1.5) with 15 df — not our t-statistic.

I: P(t < 2) with 16 df — no.

J: P(t < 1.5) with 15 df — no.

So the correct option should be D.

The correct answer is D.
