Okay, so I have this calculus problem here, and I need to find the volume of a solid formed by rotating a region around the y-axis. The curves given are y = x and y = x², and we're looking at the first quadrant. Hmmm, I remember from my classes that when you rotate around the y-axis, sometimes it's easier to use the shell method or the disk method. Let me think about which one to use here.

First, let me visualize the region. In the first quadrant, the line y = x is a straight line passing through the origin at a 45-degree angle. The parabola y = x² also starts at the origin and opens upwards. They intersect at (0,0) and another point where x² = x. Solving x² = x gives x = 0 and x = 1, so the curves intersect at (1,1). So the region bounded by these curves is between x=0 and x=1, under y = x and above y = x².

Now, the problem says to rotate this region around the y-axis. So, the solid formed will have a sort of cylindrical shape, but since the top boundary is a line and the bottom is a parabola, the cross-section will be like a washer when using the washer method, or a shell when using the shell method.

Let me recall the formulas. For the disk (washer) method, when rotating around the y-axis, the volume is π ∫[a to b] (R(y)² - r(y)²) dy, where R(y) is the outer radius and r(y) is the inner radius. For the shell method, it's 2π ∫[a to b] x (f(x) - g(x)) dx, where x is the radius of the shell, and f(x) and g(x) are the top and bottom functions.

In this case, since we're dealing with functions of x, it might be easier to use the disk (washer) method with respect to y. Wait, but actually, when rotating around the y-axis, the washer method is usually straightforward because we can express x as a function of y. Alternatively, the shell method also works because we can express x as a function of y, but I'm a bit more comfortable with the washer method when the functions are given in terms of x. Hmm, maybe the shell method is easier here.

Wait, the functions are given as y = x and y = x². If I use the washer method, I need to express x in terms of y. For the line y = x, solving for x gives x = y. For the parabola y = x², solving for x gives x = sqrt(y). So, the outer radius R(y) is y, and the inner radius r(y) is sqrt(y). So, the area of the washer at a given y is π(R² - r²) = π(y² - (sqrt(y))²) = π(y² - y). Therefore, the volume would be the integral from y=0 to y=1 of π(y² - y) dy.

Alternatively, using the shell method, each vertical strip at position x would have a height of f(x) - g(x) = x - x², and the circumference would be 2πx, and the thickness is dx. So, the volume would be integral from x=0 to x=1 of 2πx*(x - x²) dx, which is 2π ∫(x² - x³) dx from 0 to 1.

Wait, let me compute both methods to see if they give the same answer.

First, washer method:

Volume = π ∫[0 to 1] (y² - y) dy.

Compute the integral:

∫ y² dy = (1/3)y³,

∫ y dy = (1/2)y².

So, evaluated from 0 to 1:

(1/3)(1)^3 - (1/2)(1)^2 - [0 - 0] = (1/3 - 1/2) = (2/6 - 3/6) = (-1/6).

So, the volume is π*(-1/6) times π, wait, no. Wait, the integral is π*( (1/3 - 1/2) ) which is π*(-1/6). But that can't be right because volume can't be negative. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, actually, when using the washer method, the outer radius should be larger than the inner radius. Let me check: when y is between 0 and 1, which function is on top? For a given y, x is y for the line and sqrt(y) for the parabola. Wait, at y=0.5, for example, sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707, which is greater than 0.5, so the parabola is on top. Therefore, the outer radius should be sqrt(y), and the inner radius y. Wait, so that would make the outer radius larger, so R(y) = sqrt(y) and r(y) = y.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because at y=0.5, R(y) would be sqrt(0.5) ≈0.707 and r(y) = 0.5. So, R > r, which would make the washer area positive.

So, the outer radius is sqrt(y), inner is y. So, the area is π*( (sqrt(y))² - y² ) = π*( y - y² ). So, the integral is ∫[0 to 1] π*(y - y²) dy.

Compute this:

∫ y dy = (1/2)y²,

∫ y² dy = (1/3)y³.

So, evaluated from 0 to 1:

(1/2 - 1/3) = (3/6 - 2/6) = 1/6.

Multiply by π: (π)*(1/6) = π/6. So, the volume is π/6.

Wait, but that's using the washer method. Alternatively, using the shell method, let's compute that.

Shell method:

Each shell at position x has height (x - x²), radius x, thickness dx. So, the volume is 2π ∫[0 to 1] x*(x - x²) dx = 2π ∫ (x² - x³) dx.

Integrate from 0 to 1:

∫ x² dx = (1/3)x³,

∫ x³ dx = (1/4)x⁴.

So, evaluated from 0 to 1:

(1/3 - 1/4) = (4/12 - 3/12) = 1/12.

Multiply by 2π: 2π*(1/12) = π/6.

Same result! So, whether I use the washer or the shell method, the volume is π/6. Looking at the options, that's option E: π/6.

Wait, but I should make sure that I set up the shells correctly. In the shell method, the radius is x, and the height is the difference between the two functions, which is y = x - x². So, the integral is correct. So, the answer is π/6, which is option E.

To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by the curves \( y = x \) and \( y = x^2 \) in the first quadrant about the y-axis, we can use either the washer (disk) method or the shell method. Both methods yield the same result, and here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify the region**: The curves intersect at \( (0,0) \) and \( (1,1) \). The region is between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), bounded above by \( y = x \) and below by \( y = x^2 \).

2. **Washer Method**:
   - Express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
     - For \( y = x \), \( x = y \).
     - For \( y = x^2 \), \( x = \sqrt{y} \).
   - Outer radius \( R(y) = \sqrt{y} \), Inner radius \( r(y) = y \).
   - Volume element: \( \pi (R^2 - r^2) dy = \pi (\sqrt{y}^2 - y^2) dy = \pi (y - y^2) dy \).
   - Integrate from \( y = 0 \) to \( y = 1 \):
     \[
     \text{Volume} = \pi \int_{0}^{1} (y - y^2) dy = \pi \left[ \frac{1}{2}y^2 - \frac{1}{3}y^3 \right]_0^1 = \pi \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{\pi}{6}.
     \]

3. **Shell Method**:
   - Each shell at position \( x \) has:
     - Height: \( x - x^2 \).
     - Radius: \( x \).
   - Volume element: \( 2\pi x (x - x^2) dx = 2\pi (x^2 - x^3) dx \).
   - Integrate from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     \text{Volume} = 2\pi \int_{0}^{1} (x^2 - x^3) dx = 2\pi \left[ \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{4}x^4 \right]_0^1 = 2\pi \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{\pi}{6}.
     \]

Both methods confirm that the volume is \( \frac{\pi}{6} \).
