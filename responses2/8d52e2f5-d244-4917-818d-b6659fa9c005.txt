Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the vapor pressure of CCl4 at 38°C. Let me think through it. I remember that vapor pressure and temperature are related, especially when dealing with substances that follow the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Wait, right, the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH°/R) [1/T1 - 1/T2]. Oh wait, no, it should be [1/T1 - 1/T2], but actually, I think the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH° (1/T1 -1/T2 )) / R. Or is it the other way around? Let me get that right.

Wait, the correct form is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH° (1/T1 - 1/T2 )) / R. Or wait, no, it's (ΔH°/R) [1/T1 - 1/T2]. Hmm, I might have gotten that wrong. Wait, let's think. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is (dP/dT) = (ΔH°)/(R T²), but the integrated form relates P1, P2, T1, T2. So the equation should be (ln(P2/P1)) = (ΔH° / R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ].

Wait, no, wait. I think the equation is ln(P2/P1) = [ΔH°/R] (1/T1 − 1/T2) / 1. Or maybe it's (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1) − (1/T2) ].

Wait, no, I think the correct equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH°/R) (1/T1 − 1/T2) ) / 1. Or wait, no, I think I might have the signs reversed. Let me double-check. The equation is:

ln(P2 / P1) = (ΔH° / R) (1/T1 − 1/T2) / (1)

Wait, no, I think the equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH°/(R)) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ].

Wait, another approach: I know that for substances that have a positive enthalpy of vaporization, vapor pressure increases with temperature. So, if we have two points, perhaps we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the slope or something.

Wait, the problem gives me H^1 which is 32,000 J/mol. So that's ΔH°, the enthalpy of vaporization. And at 23°C, the vapor pressure is 0.132 atm. We need to find the vapor pressure at 38°C.

So first, I should convert the temperatures to Kelvin. 23°C is 296.15 K, and 38°C is 311.15 K.

Now, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Let me plug in the numbers.

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Wait, but wait! No, wait. I think the correct equation is (ln(P2/P1)) = (ΔH° / R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ].

Wait, no, wait again. I might have it wrong. Let me recall. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation in its integrated form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH° / R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ].

Wait, no, I think it's (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] when going from T1 to T2. Hmm, no, perhaps I should look up the correct form.

Wait, the correct equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH° / R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: The slope of the vapor pressure-temperature curve is given by ΔH°/R. So, the change in vapor pressure with temperature is proportional to the enthalpy of vaporization divided by the gas constant.

But wait, let me think about the exact equation. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

dP/dT = (ΔH°) / (R T²)

Integrating this from T1 to T2:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH° / R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ].

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think about the integral. The integral of dP/(P) = ∫ (ΔH°/(R T²)) dT from T1 to T2.

Wait, the integral of dP/P is ln(P2) - ln(P1) = ln(P2/P1).

∫ (ΔH/(R T²)) dT from T1 to T2.

So, ∫ (ΔH/R) * (1/T²) dT = (ΔH/R) * (-1/T) + C.

So, evaluating from T1 to T2:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) [ (-1/T2) + 1/T1 ) ]

Which is (ΔH/R) [ (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

Yes, so that's correct.

So, in this problem, ΔH° is 32,000 J/mol. So, let's plug in the numbers.

P1 is 0.132 atm at T1 = 296.15 K.

We need to find P2 at T2 = 311.15 K.

So,

ln(P2/0.132) = (32000 J/mol / 8.314 J/mol·K) [ (1/296.15) - (1/311.15) ) ]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the term in the brackets: (1/296.15) - (1/311.15)

Calculate 1/296.15 ≈ 0.003379 K⁻¹

1/311.15 ≈ 0.003213 K⁻¹

Subtracting: 0.003379 - 0.003213 = 0.000166 K⁻¹.

Multiply by 32000 J/(mol·K):

32000 * 0.000166 ≈ 5.312 J/mol.

So, ln(P2/0.132) = 5.312.

Now, compute e^5.312.

e^5 is ~148.41, e^0.312 is about 1.366. So, 148.41 * 1.366 ≈ 148.41 * 1.366 ≈ let me compute 148 *1.366.

148 * 1 = 148.

148 * 0.3 = 44.4 → 148 +44.4=192.4

148 *0.06=8.88 → 192.4 +8.88=201.28

148 *0.006=0.888 → 201.28+0.888≈202.17.

Wait, but 0.312 is 0.3 +0.012. So 0.3 is 44.4, 0.012 is 1.776 (since 148 *0.01=1.48, 0.002=0.296 → 1.48+0.296=1.776).

So 44.4 +1.776=46.176. So 148.41 *1.366 ≈148.41 *1.366 ≈ 148 *1.366 +0.41*1.366.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 5.312 as 5 + 0.312.

e^5 is 148.4132, e^0.312 is approximately 1.366.

So 148.4132 *1.366 ≈ let me compute 148 *1.366 = ?

Wait, 148 *1 = 148, 148 *0.3=44.4, 148 *0.06=8.88, 148 *0.006=0.888.

So 148 *1.366 = 148*(1 +0.3 +0.06 +0.006) = 148 +44.4 +8.88 +0.888 = 148 +44.4=192.4, +8.88=201.28, +0.888=202.168.

Then 0.4132 *1.366 is approximately 0.4 *1.366=0.5464, plus 0.0132 *1.366≈0.0181. So total about 0.5645.

So total e^5.312 ≈ 202.168 +0.5645≈202.732.

Wait, but wait, 5.312 is just the number. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a calculator function.

Wait, but in reality, perhaps a better approach is to compute e^5.312.

Alternatively, use a calculator approach.

Wait, 5.312 is approximately 5.31. Let's compute e^5.3.

e^5 is about 148.413. e^0.3 is about 1.34986.

So e^5.3 = e^5 * e^0.3 ≈148.413 *1.34986 ≈ let's compute that.

148.413 * 1.34986: let's break it down.

148.413 * 1 = 148.413

148.413 * 0.3 = 44.5239

148.413 * 0.04 = 5.9365

148.413 * 0.00986 ≈ 148.413 *0.01=1.48413, subtract 148.413 *0.00014= ~0.02078. So 1.48413-0.02078≈1.46335.

Now sum all:

148.413 +44.5239 = 192.9369

+5.9365 = 198.8734

+1.46335 = 198.8734+1.46335≈200.33675.

But wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Because 0.3 + 0.04 is 0.34, but 1.34986 is 0.3 + 0.04 +0.00986.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 148.413 *1.34986 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute e^0.312 as 1.366, e^5.312 = e^5 * e^0.312 ≈148.413 *1.366 ≈ let's compute 148 *1.366.

148 *1=148, 148 *0.3=44.4, 148 *0.06=8.88, 148 *0.006=0.888.

Add: 148 +44.4 =192.4; +8.88=201.28; +0.888=202.168.

So, e^5.312 ≈202.168.

Wait, so ln(P2/0.132) =5.312 → P2/0.132 = e^5.312 ≈202.168 → P2=202.168 *0.132.

Compute that: 200 *0.132=26.4, 2.168 *0.132≈0.2858. So total around 26.6858 atm.

Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options. The options given are all below 0.3 atm, except option J: 0.325 atm, and E: 0.225, etc. Wait, that can't be right because vapor pressure increases with temperature. But wait, wait, 0.325 is possible if I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I reversed T1 and T2. Let me think. The given data: at 23°C, P=0.132 atm. We want P at 38°C. So, T1=296 K, T2=311 K. So, the correct calculation would be as I did earlier.

Wait, but wait another thing: the equation I used might be wrong. Let me think again. The correct equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH° / R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ].

Wait, but if I use the correct values.

Wait, let me recalculate the bracket:

(1/296.15) − (1/311.15) = (approx) 0.003379 - 0.003213 = 0.000166 K^-1.

Multiply by (32000 J/mol): 0.000166 *32000 ≈5.312.

Then ln(P2/0.132) =5.312 → P2/0.132 =e^5.312 ≈202.168 → P2=202.168 *0.132 ≈26.74 atm.

But this is way higher than any of the options. Hmm, none of the options reach even 0.2 atm. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Oh wait, wait, the enthalpy is given in J/mol, so R is in J/mol·K.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the vapor pressure in the reverse direction. Like, perhaps I should have used the inverse? So, using T as 296 K and 311 K, but the equation is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the form:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH° / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, that's what I used.

Wait, but if I did that, then I get a P2 way higher than any of the options. So perhaps I should reverse the calculation.

Wait, let me think about the formula again. Maybe I have the equation backward. Let me double-check the correct form.

The correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ]

Wait, I think that's correct. Because when you integrate dP/P = (ΔH°/R T²) dT, you get ln(P) = (ΔH°/R) (1/T) + C.

So when you plug in T1 and T2, you get ln(P2) − ln(P1) = (ΔH°/R)(1/T1 −1/T2).

Yes, that's right. So the calculation seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let's re-calculate the bracket (1/296.15 - 1/311.15).

Compute 1/296.15: 1/296.15 ≈ 0.003379 K⁻¹.

1/311.15 ≈ 0.003213 K⁻¹.

Subtraction: 0.003379−0.003213=0.000166 K⁻¹.

Multiply by 32000 J/mol:

0.000166 *32000 = 5.312 J/mol.

So, ln(P2/P1)=5.312 → P2 = P1 * e^5.312.

e^5.312 is about 202.168, so P2 = 0.132 * 202.168 ≈ 26.74 atm.

But the options are A: 0.26, B: 0.16, etc. Wait, none of the options are close to 26 atm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should use 32,000 J/mol as the correct value. Let me see.

Wait, 32000 J/mol is correct.

Let me compute the term again more carefully.

Compute (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ]

So, the term is (32000 / 8.314) * (1/296.15 - 1/311.15)

Compute 32000/8.314 ≈ 32000 /8.314 ≈ 3844.5 (because 8.314 * 3844 ≈32000).

Wait, 8.314 * 3844: 8 *3844=30752; 0.314*3844≈1200. So total 30752+1200=31952. Close to 32000.

Wait, perhaps 32000 /8.314=3844.45.

Then, (1/296.15 -1/311.15) = 0.000166 K⁻¹.

Multiply by 3844.45: 0.000166 *3844.45 ≈0.636.

So ln(P2/0.132)=0.636.

Now, compute e^0.636.

e^0.6 = 1.8221,

e^0.636 = e^(0.6 +0.036) = e^0.6 * e^0.036.

e^0.036 ≈1 +0.036 + (0.036)^2/2 + (0.036)^3/6.

=1 +0.036 + 0.000648 +0.00000936=1.036657.

So, e^0.636 ≈1.8221 *1.036657.

Let me compute 1.8221 * 1.036657.

1.8221 *1 =1.8221,

1.8221 *0.03 =0.054663,

1.8221 *0.006=0.0109326,

1.8221 *0.000657≈0.001200.

Adding all: 1.8221 +0.054663=1.876763 +0.0109326=1.8876956 +0.0012≈1.8889.

So e^0.636≈1.8889.

So P2 = 0.132 * 1.8889 ≈0.25 atm.

Ah, that's in line with option A: 0.26 atm. But wait, no, 0.25 is approximately 0.25, which rounds to 0.25. But in the options, option A is 0.26 (which is 0.26) and option B is 0.16.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me check this calculation:

I think earlier, I got P2=0.25 atm, but let me see.

Wait, when I computed ln(P2/0.132)=0.636, then P2/0.132 = e^0.636≈1.8889, so P2=0.132 *1.8889.

Compute 0.132 *1.8889.

0.132 *1 =0.132,

0.132 *0.8 =0.1056,

0.132 *0.08=0.01056,

0.132 *0.0089≈0.0011868.

Add all:

0.132 +0.1056 =0.2376,

+0.01056 =0.24816,

+0.0011868≈0.24935.

So P2≈0.24935 atm, approximately 0.25 atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.26 atm. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait, the options list is:

A) 0.26

B) 0.16

C) 0.08

D) 0.01

E) 0.00

F) 0.00

So, the correct answer is A: 0.26 atm.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the calculation without approximations.

Let me compute ln(P2/0.132)= (32000 /8.314) * (1/296.15 -1/311.15).

Compute the term (1/296.15 -1/311.15) = (311.15 -296.15)/(296.15 *311.15) ) =15/(296.15 *311.15).

296.15 *311.15 = let's compute:

296.15 *300 =88,845.

296.15 *11.15=?

Wait, 296.15 *10=2,961.5,

296.15 *1.15= 296.15 *1 +296.15*0.15 =296.15 +44.4225=340.5725.

So, 296.15 *311.15=296.15*(300 +11.15)=296.15*300 +296.15*11.15=88845 + (296.15 *10 +296.15 *1.15) =88845 + (2961.5 +340.5725)=88845 +3302.0725=92,147.0725.

So, (15)/(92147.0725)≈15/92147≈0.0001627.

So, (1/296.15 -1/311.15)=15/(296.15 *311.15)=0.0001627 K⁻¹.

Multiply by (32000/8.314)=3844.45 K⁻¹.

So, 3844.45 *0.0001627 ≈ 3844.45 *1.627e-4 ≈3844.45 *0.0001627.

Compute 3844.45 *0.0001627:

Multiply 3844.45 * 0.0001 =0.384445,

3844.45 *0.00006=0.230667,

3844.45 *0.0000027=0.01038.

Add all: 0.384445 +0.230667=0.615112 +0.01038=0.625492.

So, ln(P2/0.132)=0.625492.

Now, compute e^0.625492.

e^0.625492: Let's compute step by step.

e^0.6=1.8221188.

e^0.025492=?

Using Taylor series expansion around x=0: e^x=1 +x +x²/2 +x³/6 +x^4/24.

x=0.025492.

x=0.025492,

x²=0.0006495,

x³=0.00001651,

x^4=0.000000417,

x^5=1.044e-8.

So,

e^x=1 +0.025492 +0.0006495/2 +0.00001651/6 +0.000000417/24.

Compute each term:

1 +0.025492=1.025492,

+0.00032475=1.02581675,

+0.0000027517=1.0258195,

+0.00000001736=1.0258195.

So, e^0.025492≈1.0258195.

So, e^(0.6 +0.025492)=e^0.6 * e^0.025492≈1.8221188 *1.0258195.

Compute 1.8221188 *1.0258195.

Break it down:

1.8221188 *1 =1.8221188,

1.8221188 *0.02=0.036442376,

1.8221188 *0.005=0.009110594,

1.8221188 *0.0008=0.001457695,

1.8221188 *0.0000195≈0.0000356.

Adding all:

1.8221188 +0.036442376=1.858561,

+0.009110594=1.8676715,

+0.001457695=1.8691292,

+0.0000356=1.8691648.

So, e^0.625492≈1.8691648.

So, P2=0.132 *1.8691648≈0.246 atm.

So, approximately 0.246 atm, which is close to option A (0.26 atm). So the correct answer should be option A.
</think>

To determine the vapor pressure of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) at 38°C, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H^\circ}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Inputs and Constants
- Given: Vapor pressure at \( T_1 = 23^\circ \text{C} = 296.15 \, \text{K} \): \( P_1 = 0.132 \, \text{atm} \)
- Target: Vapor pressure at \( T_2 = 38^\circ \text{C} = 311.15 \, \text{K} \)
- Enthalpy: \( \Delta H^\circ = 32,000 \, \text{J/mol} \)
- Gas constant: \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \)

### Step 2: Calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \)
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{296.15} - \frac{1}{311.15}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{296.15} \approx 0.003379 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{311.15} \approx 0.003213 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.003379 - 0.003213 = 0.000166 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \frac{\Delta H^\circ}{R} \)
\[
\frac{\Delta H^\circ}{R} = \frac{32,000}{8.314} \approx 3844.45 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 4: Combine Terms
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H^\circ}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = 3844.45 \times 0.000166 \approx 0.625492
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( P_2 \)
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = 0.625492
\]
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = e^{0.625492}
\]
\[
e^{0.625492} \approx 1.8691648
\]
\[
P_2 = P_1 \times 1.8691648
\]
\[
P_2 = 0.132 \times 1.8691648 \approx 0.246 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 6: Match with Options
The calculated vapor pressure is approximately \( 0.246 \, \text{atm} \), which is closest to option **A: 0.26 atm**.
