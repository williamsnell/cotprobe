Okay, so I've got this question about the gender of the fetus at different months of pregnancy. Hmm, I remember that the endoderm determines the gender, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timeline. Let me think. I think the embryo starts with a mix, but the main factors are the endoderm and the saccardia in the uterine. Oh right, there's something about the endoderm from the women's ovaries providing the first layers. So the first three months, the endoderm is from the ovary, which is dark brown. That means the embryo in those months is all female. 

Wait, but I also remember something about the endoderm from the ovaries being around the 4-6 months mark. So maybe after that, the endoderm comes from the uterus, which is lighter. So the embryo's gender changes from female to male after that. So the last month where it's all female would be around 3 months. That would make sense. So the correct answer should be option C, which is 3 months.

The correct answer is C: 3 months. At around 3 months, the endoderm from the ovaries is dominant, making the fetus female.
