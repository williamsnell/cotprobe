Okay, so I need to figure out which option makes a relationship last according to Sternberg. I remember that Sternberg's theory has several key concepts, including valence and heuristics. Valence refers to whether a relationship is positive or negative, and Sternberg's main point is that the right kind of valence will lead to a relationship that lasts.

The options given are understanding, empathy, respect, commitment, communication, patience, decision, and trust. Sternberg's work, I think, emphasizes that relationships are more likely to last when they are both positive and negative. Positive relationships are about communication and trust, while negative ones focus on commitment and respect. 

So, looking at the options, commitment (D) and respect (C) are both about maintaining a positive relationship. Communication (E) is also important because without it, the relationship might not grow. Patience (F) seems to relate to how the relationship handles criticism, which can prevent it from breaking down. 

Wait, but the question is about what makes a relationship last. Sternberg's theory includes that the right kind of relationship (valence) will last. So, if the valence is positive, the relationship is more likely to last. So options that represent positive relationships would be commitment (D), respect (C), and patience (F), along with communication (E) and others. But the question is asking which of these options is the answer.

Looking at the options, the correct answer should be about the positive aspects of a relationship. Sternberg likely emphasizes that the right kind of relationship, which includes focus on positive aspects like communication, commitment, trust, respect, and patience. 

So, among the options given, the correct answers would be commitment (D), respect (C), patience (F), and perhaps communication (E) and others, but the question is asking which of the options makes a relationship last. Sternberg's theory says that valence matters, but the options given include specific traits.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice, so it's likely that one of the options is correct. Sternberg's theory suggests that relationships are successful when they are positive. So among the options, commitment and respect are both positive. But wait, Sternberg's main focus is on the right kind of valence, so perhaps all the correct options are involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is commitment (D), as it's a key aspect of positive relationships. Wait, but the options include patience (F), which is also part of positive relationships. So, how to choose between them.

Alternatively, Sternberg's concept is that a relationship is more likely to last when it's both positive and negative. But the options are individual traits. So the correct answer would be that commitment, respect, patience, communication, and others are all positive aspects, but the question is phrased as what makes a relationship last. So Sternberg's theory says that relationships are more likely to last when they are positive.

Wait, the options include all the traits except communication being correct. Wait no, Sternberg's theory about valence, so the correct answer should be something about positive valence. So if the question is about what makes a relationship last, it's about the valence. But the options are individual traits.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to Sternberg's concept that positive relationships (like commitment, respect, patience) are more likely to last, while negative ones (like communication) are less likely. So the correct answer would be commitment (D) or patience (F), etc.

Alternatively, Sternberg's theory includes that the right kind of relationship, which includes both positive and negative elements. So perhaps all the options are correct, but that's not an option. But the options are single-letter, so perhaps the answer is commitment (D) as a key positive trait.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is commitment (D), because commitment is a key trait of positive relationships. Or patience (F) as it's about handling criticism, which is part of positive relationships.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is commitment (D) because it's about maintaining a positive relationship. Patience (F) is also part of that. But the question is about what makes a relationship last, so maybe the answer includes all of them except communication because communication is part of the process but not the outcome.

Wait, the options given in the question are letters from A to J, and the correct answer is one of them. Looking back at the Sternberg's concept, he says that a relationship's success depends on both positive and negative valences. So for a relationship to last, it must have a positive valence, which includes things like communication, commitment, respect, and patience.

So the question is which of the options is about that. The options given are understanding (A), empathy (B), respect (C), commitment (D), communication (E), patience (F), decision (G), and trust (H).

So Sternberg's theory suggests that the right kind of valence (positive) will lead to a relationship that lasts, so the correct answer should be one of the positive traits. So the options are commitment (D), patience (F), respect (C), and maybe others.

Wait, the question is asking which makes a relationship last, so it's about the positive aspects. So commitment (D) and patience (F) are both positive. Patience is about handling criticism, which can prevent a relationship from breaking down.

Alternatively, commitment (D) is about maintaining a positive relationship, which is crucial for lasting it. So the correct answer is commitment (D). But wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: Sternberg's theory includes that valence, whether positive or negative, affects the relationship. So positive valence (e.g., communication, commitment, respect) tends to lead to lasting relationships. Negative valence (e.g., communication) is more likely to break the relationship.

So the question is about what makes a relationship last, which would be positive valence. The options given include commitment (D), patience (F), and others. Patience is about maintaining the relationship, which is part of positive valence. Commitment is also positive.

Wait, but the question is just asking which option makes a relationship last. So perhaps all of these are correct, but since it's a multiple-choice, and each option is a single letter, the correct answer must be one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is commitment (D) because that's a key trait of positive relationships. Or perhaps the correct answer is patience (F), as it's about handling criticism, which can prevent a relationship from failing.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Sternberg's theory states that a relationship is successful when it's positive in valence. So the answer would be commitment (D), patience (F), or perhaps all that are positive. But the options given are single letters, so the correct answer would be one of them.

Wait, the question is: What makes a relationships last, according to Sternberg?

So the correct answer is the trait that is part of the right kind of valence. So the correct answer would be commitment (D), patience (F), or perhaps others. Wait, but the options given are letters, so each is a possible answer.

Wait, the options are:

A: understanding

B: empathy

C: respect

D: commitment

E: communication

F: patience

G: decision

H: trust

So Sternberg's theory emphasizes that valence is the key. So the answer would be one of the positive traits. So the correct answer is commitment (D), or patience (F), or perhaps another.

Alternatively, I think Sternberg's theory is that a relationship is more likely to last if it has a positive valence. So the traits that promote positive valence include communication, commitment, respect, patience, and trust.

But the question is asking which of the given options is correct. So all of these are correct, but the options are single letters. So perhaps the best answer is commitment (D), because it's a common trait of positive relationships.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way: Sternberg's theory includes that a relationship is more likely to last when it's both positive and negative. But the question is about what makes it last, so it's about positive aspects.

Alternatively, the correct answer is commitment (D), as that's a key trait that leads to lasting relationships.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option:

Understanding (A) is a trait related to communication, which is important for trust and respect, but it's not a unique trait.

Empathy (B) is about understanding each other's feelings, which can strengthen a relationship, but it's part of a broader trait.

Respect (C) is about treating others with the same respect, which is a positive trait.

Compliance (D) is about doing what's right, which can strengthen a relationship, but it's part of the traits that promote positive valence.

Communication (E) is important for trust, which is part of positive valence.

Patience (F) is about handling criticism, which can prevent a relationship from breaking down.

Decision (G) is not directly about valence.

Trust (H) is about equal hands, which is part of positive relationships.

So the correct answer must be one of these that are part of positive valence.

So from the options, commitment (D) and patience (F) are both positive traits, but the question is looking for the answer.

Wait, but the question is about what makes a relationship last, so perhaps all of these are correct, but since it's a single-choice question, the best fit is commitment (D) or patience (F).

Wait, I think Sternberg's theory says that a relationship is more likely to last when it's positive in valence, which includes things like communication, commitment, respect, and patience. But the question is asking which single option makes a relationship last. So perhaps all these are correct, but the question expects the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is commitment (D) because it's a key trait of positive relationships. Patience (F) is also a positive trait, but perhaps the question is looking for more than one answer, but it's a single choice.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that Sternberg's concept of valence includes positive and negative, but the key is positive. So the answer is commitment (D) because it's part of a positive relationship. Or perhaps patience (F), as it's about maintaining the relationship.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the answer in the context of Sternberg's theory. Sternberg's theory says that a relationship is successful when it's positive in terms of valence. So the correct answer is the trait that contributes to positive valence.

So the answer is commitment (D), because commitment is a key trait in positive relationships. Patience (F) is also a positive trait but perhaps under a different category.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is commitment (D), as it's a key trait that leads to lasting relationships.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The correct answer is commitment (D), as it's a key trait of positive relationships, which is what Sternberg refers to.
</think>

The correct answer is commitment (D). Sternberg's theory emphasizes that a relationship is more likely to last when it is positive in terms of valence. Commitment, respect, patience, and trust are all traits that contribute to positive relationships, which are more likely to last. Among the options provided, commitment (D) is a key trait that aligns with Sternberg's concept of positive relationships.
