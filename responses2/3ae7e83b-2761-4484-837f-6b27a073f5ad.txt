Okay, so I've got this question about the effect of having others on performance. Let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on psychology, but I'll think through it.

The question says studies show that having others on you affects performance. The options are A to J, each giving different possibilities. I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember from my studies that social support can have different effects depending on the situation. Sometimes people help each other, and other times they actually hinder performance.

Option A says no significant effect. I don't think that's right because I remember hearing that having others can either help or hinder, not always nothing.

Option B is about easy and difficult tasks. That doesn't sound familiar. I don't recall a study that specifically says others help with easy but hinder difficult.

Option C says hinder all tasks. That doesn't make sense either. People usually help with some tasks, not all.

Option D: Hinder difficult tasks. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. I think some studies suggest that having others can help with difficult tasks, not hinder them.

Option E: Hinder easy tasks. That seems counterintuitive. I thought social support might actually help with easy tasks because they can assist others.

Option F: Increase difficult, decrease easy. I don't remember this being a common finding. Maybe it's a distractor, or perhaps it's not the case.

Option G: Increase novel tasks, decrease difficult. I remember reading something about how social support can help with learning new information (novel tasks) but maybe hinder with difficult tasks, which are more challenging.

Option H: Facilitate easy tasks. That seems incorrect because facilitating might mean helping others, not the tasks themselves.

Option I: Increase easy tasks. That doesn't fit with what I know. Facilitating would mean helping, but facilitating tasks usually doesn't help if they're hard.

Option J: Facilitate novel and difficult tasks. I'm not sure about this. Maybe some studies suggest that social support can help in both areas, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm trying to recall. From my notes, I remember that having others can sometimes help with tasks that are less challenging, like learning new things, but can also hinder more difficult tasks. Oh, wait, noâ€”that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: there's a concept called "social facilitation," but I'm not sure how that applies here. Maybe when you're in a group, you're more likely to help others, but that doesn't necessarily mean your own tasks are easier.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the idea of social support affecting task performance. For example, some studies suggest that others can decrease your performance if they get stressed or don't care. But generally, having others helps with some tasks, not all. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, another point: in some cases, social support can actually help with both easy and difficult tasks. Like, when you're in a group, you might help each other, which might lower your own stress, making difficult tasks easier. Or maybe it's the opposite, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I remember reading that social support can sometimes increase task performance, but sometimes it can decrease. But I'm not sure which effect is more common. Alternatively, I'm thinking about the idea that social support can be a double-edged sword. It might help with some tasks but hinder others.

Looking back at the options, option G says "increase the performance of novel tasks but decrease the performance of difficult tasks." That sounds plausible. Because when you're in a group, you can help others, which might make hard tasks easier to handle by the group, while making novel tasks more challenging because you're not sure how to approach them, or perhaps because others have different ideas.

Alternatively, I've heard that social support can sometimes lead to better performance on both types of tasks, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the n nature of tasks. For example, social support might help with learning (novel tasks) but hinder with more complex or difficult tasks.

Wait, another thought: when people are in a group, they might have more motivation to tackle more challenging tasks because they have others to help. So if a task is difficult, when you're with others, you might be more willing to try it. So perhaps social support can increase the performance of difficult tasks. But that would make option F (increase difficult, decrease easy) incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the effects. Let me try to think. Social support can sometimes make someone more successful in both areas, but perhaps in some cases, social support might decrease performance on difficult tasks because they're overwhelmed.

Alternatively, I've read that social support can enhance performance on tasks that are challenging because it helps you handle the stress, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to eliminate the options. So, the options are about whether others help or hinder performance. 

Option A: No effect. That's probably not right because studies have shown that others can influence performance.

Option B: Facilitate both easy and difficult. I'm not sure. Maybe not.

Option C: Hinder all. No.

Option D: Hinder difficult. Maybe.

Option E: Hinder easy. Maybe.

Option F: Increase difficult, decrease easy. I'm not sure.

Option G: Increase novel, decrease difficult. That's a possibility.

Option H: Facilitate easy. No.

Option I: Facilitate both. No.

Option J: Facilitate novel and difficult. Maybe.

So, between G and J. 

Wait, I think I read that social support can increase the performance of novel tasks (because they're new and might not be as daunting) but might not help with difficult tasks. Or perhaps the opposite. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, when you have others, you might feel more motivated to tackle harder tasks because you can support others. So social support could increase difficult tasks but not easy ones. That would point towards option E: hinder the performance of easy tasks.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Let me think again.

Another approach: I remember that when people are in a group, they might help each other out, which could reduce your own stress and perhaps make difficult tasks easier because you can get help from others. So social support could increase difficult tasks. But for easy tasks, maybe social support doesn't help because the tasks are easier, or perhaps they make you feel more confident.

Wait, that would mean that social support increases difficult tasks (E) but doesn't affect easy tasks. But that's not an option. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, option E is 'hinder the performance of easy tasks.' So if social support hinders easy tasks, that would mean that having others makes easy tasks harder. But I thought that being in a group could actually make easy tasks easier because you're more motivated. So maybe I'm wrong.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of a concrete example. If I'm in a group studying for a test. If the test is difficult, I might help others with their harder tasks, which could make me more confident and thus perform better. So social support on difficult tasks helps.

If the test is easy, maybe having others' help doesn't make me perform worse. Or perhaps it helps me study better, making me perform better. So social support might not hinder easy tasks but might help with both.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: social support can sometimes lead to increased task performance, but maybe for some tasks more than others.

Wait, another thought: I've read that social support can increase performance on both types of tasks, but may reduce the impact on difficult tasks because they're more vulnerable. Or perhaps the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option says.

Option G says "increase the performance of novel tasks but decrease the performance of difficult tasks." That's a strong possibility. So when you have others, you can help with new or interesting tasks but might not help with the more challenging ones.

Option J says "facilitate the performance of novel and difficult tasks." So having others makes you better at both.

I've heard that social support can sometimes lead to better performance on both tasks, but perhaps the effect varies. Alternatively, I read that social support can help more with learning and problem-solving tasks, which might be considered 'novel' or 'hard' depending on the context. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps social support can increase performance on both types of tasks, but maybe on hard ones it's more pronounced. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: I think that social support can sometimes increase task performance, but sometimes it might lead to increased stress or decreased motivation, which could be a hindrance. For example, if you're in a group, you might feel more anxious about difficult tasks, which could hinder your performance.

If that's the case, then option E would be correct. Having others hinders easy tasks (because they're easier) and might hinder difficult tasks as well. But that seems contradictory because social support is supposed to help.

Alternatively, maybe social support hinders easy tasks because they're more straightforward, but for harder tasks, it helps. So option E says hinder easy, which might be correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: I remember reading that social support can increase task performance for both types, but maybe for hard tasks it's more effective. So perhaps when you have others, you perform better on difficult tasks. But that would mean option G is correct: increase novel, decrease difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the opposite: social support can decrease difficult tasks because you get overwhelmed. That would point to option E.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option G: Increase the performance of novel tasks but decrease the performance of difficult tasks.

Option J: Facilitate the performance of novel and difficult tasks.

Looking for the most accurate statement, I think option G is correct. Because social support can help with learning new things (novel) but might make difficult tasks harder because the pressure is on. Or perhaps the opposite. Alternatively, I think that social support can sometimes help with both, but maybe more so with some.

Wait, I think I've read that social support can enhance performance on both types of tasks, but perhaps it's more effective for learning (novel) and less so for difficult tasks. So option G would be correct.

Alternatively, some studies suggest that social support can increase the performance of both, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that social support can lead to increased task performance, but maybe for some tasks, like difficult ones, it's more pronounced. So option G would fit.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is G: increase the performance of novel tasks but decrease the performance of difficult tasks.

The question asks about the effect of social support on task performance. After considering various perspectives and recalling relevant psychological principles, the analysis led to the following conclusions:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as studies show social support can influence performance, not have no significant effect.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as social support can facilitate both easy and difficult tasks, not just increase their performance.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as social support can hinder performance on all tasks, not just some.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as social support can increase task performance, not hinder it.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as social support can increase performance on difficult tasks, not hinder it.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as social support does not specifically increase performance on difficult tasks and decrease on easy tasks.
- **Option G**: Correct, as social support can increase performance on novel tasks (new or unfamiliar tasks) but may decrease performance on difficult tasks (more challenging tasks).
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as social facilitation refers to helping others, not facilitating tasks themselves.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as social support does not increase performance on easy tasks.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as social support does not specifically facilitate both novel and difficult tasks.

The most accurate answer is **Option G**, which suggests that social support can increase performance on novel tasks but decrease it on difficult tasks. This aligns with the idea that social interaction can enhance learning and problem-solving skills in new areas but may increase stress and difficulty with more challenging tasks.
