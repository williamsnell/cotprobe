Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the remainder when 2^87 plus 3 is divided by 7. The options are given from A to J, so I'll have to figure it out step by step.

Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what's being asked. I need to compute (2^87 + 3) mod 7. That is, when 2^87 plus 3 is divided by 7, what's the remainder. 

I remember that modular arithmetic can sometimes simplify these kinds of problems. Maybe I can find a pattern in the powers of 2 modulo 7. Let's see.

Let me list out the powers of 2 modulo 7 to see if there's a cycle or repeating pattern.

2^1 mod7: 2
2^2 mod7: 4
2^3 mod7: 8 mod7 is 1
2^4 mod7: 2^3 * 2 = 1*2=2 mod7
2^5 mod7: 2^4 * 2 = 2*2=4 mod7
2^6 mod7: 2^5 *2=4*2=8 mod7=1
2^7 mod7: 2^6 *2=1*2=2 mod7
2^8 mod7: 2^7 *2=2*2=4 mod7
2^9 mod7: 4*2=8 mod7=1
Wait a minute, I see a pattern here. The remainders cycle every 3 exponents: 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, etc.

So the cycle length is 3. That means 2^n mod7 cycles every 3. So, for any n, 2^(n) mod7 is equal to 2^(n mod3) mod7, except when n mod3 is 0, in which case it's 1.

So, for 2^87: Let's find 87 mod3. 3*29=87, so 87 mod3 is 0. So 2^87 mod7 is 1.

So now, adding 3: 1 + 3 = 4. So 2^87 +3 mod7 is 4 mod7, which is 4.

Wait, let me double-check the modulus. 2^87 mod7 is 1, 1+3=4, so 4 mod7 is 4. So the remainder is 4.

Looking at the options, H is 9, but 4 mod7 is 4, which is option H as 9? Wait, no, wait the options are:

A:1, B:2, C:5, D:8, E:7, F:0, G:6, H:9, I:4, J:3.

Wait, H is 9, but 4 isn't 9. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 2^87 mod7 is 1, 1+3=4, which is 4. So remainder is 4, which is option I. So the answer should be I:4.

Wait, but let me recheck the cycle to make sure. So the cycle length is 3, starting from n=1.

n | 2^n mod7
1 | 2
2 |4
3 |1
4 |2
5 |4
6 |1
7 |2
8 |4
9 |1
... etc.

So for n=87, which is a multiple of 3 (since 87=3*29), 2^87 mod7 is 1. So 1+3=4. So yeah, remainder is 4. So the correct answer is I:4.

The remainder when $2^{87} + 3$ is divided by 7 is 4.
