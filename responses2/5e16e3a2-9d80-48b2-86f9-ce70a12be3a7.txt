Okay, so I have this physics question in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says there's a magnetic south pole with 15 units of strength. It's placed 10 cm away from another pole, and it experiences a repulsion of 300 dynes. I need to find out what the nature and strength of the second pole are. The options are various combinations of north or south poles and their strengths in poles.

Hmm. I remember that the force between two magnetic poles is similar to the electric force between charges. The formula for the force between two magnetic poles is F = (k * m1 * m2) / r², where k is a constant, m1 and m2 are the strengths of the poles, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but the units here are a bit tricky. The problem mentions "magnetic units" and "dynes." Oh right, in electromagnetism, the force between two magnetic poles is given by F = (μ0 / (4π)) * (m1 * m2) / r². But wait, I might be mixing up the actual formula. Alternatively, I think the formula is F = (μ0/(4π)) * (m1 m2)/(r²), but I might have to consider the units. However, another approach is to think in terms of the proportionality without the constants.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the relationship between the force and the strength of the poles. The force is proportional to the product of their strengths and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Also, the direction of the force depends on the relative directions of the poles—like same poles attract, opposite repel.

In this problem, the first pole is a south pole with 15 units. The second pole is either north or south. The force is repulsion, which implies they are of opposite types because same poles attract. So the second must be a north pole. Looking at the options, options B, C, F, G, J are north poles. The rest are south, so that's a start—so the second pole is a north one.

Now, the force is 300 dynes. Let's find the strength of the second pole. Let me denote the second pole's strength as m2.

The formula I remember is F = (k * m1 * m2) / r², but I'm not sure about the exact k value. Alternatively, another version I've seen is the force between two magnetic poles F = (μ0/(4π)) * (m1 m2)/(r²). But wait, μ0 is a constant, but it's a proportionality factor—so maybe in this problem, they're using a simplified version, perhaps with units such that F is in dynes, m in pole units, and r in cm.

Wait, but let me think about the relationship. Let's assume that the force is proportional to (m1 * m2) / (r²). So F ∝ (m1 * m2) / r².

Given that, let's write the ratio between the given situation and a hypothetical situation where we can compute m2.

So, for the given case:
m1 = 15 units
r = 10 cm
F = 300 dynes

And for the hypothetical case, let's assume there's a hypothetical second pole with strength m2 and maybe the same distance? Well, wait, the problem doesn't specify the distance, but wait, the question says they are placed 10 cm apart, so the distance is given as 10 cm. So perhaps the formula is F = (k * m1 * m2) / r².

But wait, the constant k may not be directly given, so perhaps we can set up a proportion. Let me think of the formula as F = (k * m1 * m2) / r², where k is a constant that includes the permeability of the medium. But in this case, since the medium is air, we can ignore any factors like relative permeability (since air's relative permeability is approximately 1). So k here is just a proportionality constant.

So for the given situation, F = k * m1 * m2 / (r^2), but wait, no, actually, I think the standard formula for magnetic force is F = (μ0 / (4π)) * (m1 m2) / r². But wait, μ0 is a constant, so perhaps in this problem, they're treating it as a proportionality, so the formula would be F = (k * m1 * m2) / r², where k is 4π μ0.

Wait, but another approach: Let's think in terms of proportionality. Let me consider the same formula as the electric force between charges, but for magnetic poles.

The electric force between two point charges is F = k_e * (q1 * q2) / r², and similarly for magnetic poles, F = k_m * (m1 * m2) / r², where k_m is a proportionality constant (like 4π μ0 / c^4, but perhaps in these units, it's taken as 1).

But in this problem, the units are perhaps given as dyne, which is a unit of force, and the poles as units. So perhaps the formula is F = (m1 * m2) / r², but scaled by a constant. But without knowing k, perhaps I should think about the ratio between the given situation and another hypothetical situation where the second pole is of a certain strength.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to set up the equation. Let me assume that the force is F = (k * m1 * m2) / r², where k is a constant. Then, for the given data:

F = 300 dynes = (k * 15 * m2) / (0.1)^2

Wait, because r is 10 cm, which is 0.1 meters. So 0.1 squared is 0.01.

So, 300 = (k * 15 * m2) / 0.01 → 300 = (k * 15 * m2) * 100 → 300 = 1500 k * m2 → 1500 k m2 = 300 → k m2 = 300 / 1500 = 0.2.

But wait, I'm not sure about the value of k in this context. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is F = (μ0 /4π) * (m1 m2)/ r². In this case, μ0/(4π) is a constant, so perhaps the units here are set such that the constant is 1, making F = (m1 m2)/(r²).

Wait, but if that's the case, then F = (m1 m2) / (r²) → 300 = (15 * m2) / (0.1)^2 → 300 = (15 m2) / 0.01 → 15 m2 = 300 * 0.01 → 15 m2 = 3 → m2 = 3 /15 = 0.2.

Wait, but that can't be right because 0.2 poles? That seems too small. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is F = (μ0/(4π)) * (m1 m2) / r² → but in the problem, the units are in dynes. So if F is in dynes, and the other variables are in their respective units, the formula would be F = (μ0/(4π)) * (m1 * m2) / r² → but since the units are given as dynes and poles, perhaps this is an alternative.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio of the given scenario to a hypothetical case where the second pole is of a certain strength, say, 1 pole. Let's say that m2 is 1 pole.

So, F = (μ0/(4π)) * (15 * 1) / (0.1)^2 → but without knowing μ0/(4π), perhaps we can set up a ratio.

Wait, maybe the force of 300 dynes between 15 pole and m2 pole is the same as, say, the force between two poles of 15 poles and 1 pole, but scaled by some factor.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the force equation with the same proportionality. Let me consider the same formula as the electric force between charges, but for magnetic poles.

The electric force between two point charges is F = k_e * (q1 q2) / r². Similarly, the magnetic force between two point poles is F = k_m * (m1 m2) / r².

But without knowing k_m, perhaps the ratio between the two scenarios can help.

Wait, but perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me think about the formula for the force between two magnetic poles. The formula is F = (μ0/(4π)) * (m1 * m2) / r². But μ0/(4π) is a specific constant.

Wait, but since the problem isn't giving me μ0, perhaps I can set up the ratio between the given scenario and a hypothetical situation where the second pole is of a certain strength.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be rearranged to find m2: m2 = (F * r²) / (k * m1).

But without knowing k, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be treated as a proportionality problem where the force is proportional to the product of the strengths and inversely proportional to the square of the distance.

So, given F = C * (m1 * m2) / r², where C is a constant.

In the given case:
F = 300 = C * (15 * m2) / (0.1)^2 → 300 = C * (15 m2) / 0.01 → 300 = C * 1500 m2 → C * m2 = 300 / 1500 = 0.2.

Now, if we have another case where the second pole is a north pole, say with strength m2' = 1000 poles. Then, the force would be F' = C * (15 * 1000) / 0.01 = C * 150000 / 0.01 = C * 15,000,000.

But without knowing C, perhaps this is not helpful.

Wait, but we can assume that the force in the given case is 300, so using the same C.

In the hypothetical case, if the second pole is a south pole, then m2' = ? Let's call it x.

The force would be F = C * (15 * x) / 0.01.

But how does this relate to the given data? Since we don't have the value of C, perhaps I can find it from the given scenario.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is from a textbook and the options are given. Let's think about how the options work.

The options suggest that the second pole is a north pole with certain strengths. The possible answers are B, C, F, G, J.

So, let's calculate m2.

In the given setup: F = 300 = k * (15 * m2) / (0.1)^2 → 300 = k * (15 m2) / 0.01 → 300 = 1500 k m2 → k m2 = 0.2.

Now, in each option, the second pole is a north pole, so m2 is positive. Let's see which option gives m2 = 0.2.

Looking at the options:

Option B: North, 1000 poles. m2 = 1000. Then, k * 1000 = 0.2 → k = 0.0002.

Option C: South, 1000. m2 = 1000 (since south poles have the same force magnitude but opposite direction). Wait, no, the sign is about direction, not the magnitude. So in terms of magnitude, the calculation for k would be same.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the calculation is based on the formula F = (k * m1 * m2) / r².

In the problem, the force is given as 300, so F = 300 = (k * 15 * m2) / (0.1)^2.

We can rearrange this to find (k * m2) = (300 * 0.01) / 15 = (3) /15 = 0.2.

So k * m2 = 0.2.

Now, for each option, let's see if m2 would be 0.2.

Option B: m2 =1000. Then, k *1000 =0.2 → k=0.0002.

Option C: m2=1000 (so same as B, since m2 is positive regardless of being north or south). So same k.

Option F: m2=2000. Then, k *2000=0.2 → k=0.0001.

Option G: m2=1500. Then, k *1500=0.2 → k=0.0001333.

Option J: m2=3000 → k=0.2 /3000=0.00006666.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible m2 values are 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000 for the north poles, and 1000 for the south.

Wait, but in the given problem, the force is 300, so F =300 = (k *15 * m2)/0.01.

So the equation is 300 = k *15 *m2 * 100 → because 1/0.01 is 100.

So 300 *0.01 = k *15 m2 → 3 =15 k m2 → k m2 = 3/15=0.2.

So, for each option's m2, we can compute k, but perhaps the question is simply to find m2.

Wait, but since the options give m2 as 1000, 1500, etc., perhaps I can see which m2 makes k * m2 =0.2.

Looking at the options:

Option B: m2=1000 → k *1000=0.2 → k=0.0002.

Option C: m2=1000 → same as B, so k=0.0002.

Option F: m2=2000 → k*2000=0.2 →k=0.0001.

Option G: m2=1500 →k=0.0001333.

Option J: m2=3000 →k=0.00006666.

So which of these is correct?

But we also know that the force is repulsion. So the second pole must be of opposite type to the first pole (south), so the options are B, C, F, G, J.

So, for each option, let's see:

Option B: m2=1000 (north). Then, k=0.0002.

So, F would be 300 = (0.0002 *15 *1000)/0.01 → (3 *0.0002 *1000)/0.01 → (0.6)/0.01=60. That can't be right because 60 is not 300. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recompute this.

Wait, F = (k * m1 * m2) / r².

In this case, with m1=15, m2=1000, r=0.1.

So F = (k *15 * 1000) / (0.1)^2 → (k *15000) /0.01 → 15000 * k /0.01 = 15000 * (0.0002) *1000? Wait, no.

Wait, let me re-calculate with k=0.0002.

F = (0.0002 *15 *1000) / (0.1)^2 → (0.0002 *15000) / 0.01 → (3)/0.01 = 300. Ah, right. So that works.

So, for option B, m2=1000, F=300. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is a north pole, 1000 poles. So the nature is north pole, strength 1000.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first option is A: South, 1500.

Option B is North, 1000.

So according to this, the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but why is the option A's strength 1500? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recast the equation. Let me think of the formula as F = k * (m1 * m2) / r², where k is a constant.

In the given scenario, 300 = k * (15 * m2) / (0.1)^2 → 300 = k * (15 m2) * 100 → 300 = 1500 k m2 → k m2 = 0.2.

In option B, m2=1000 → k=0.2/1000=0.0002.

Then, 300 = (0.0002 *15 *1000 ) / (0.1)^2 → 300 = (0.0002 *15000) / 0.01 → 0.0002 *15000=0.3 → 0.3 /0.01=30. Oh wait, that's not matching.

Wait, that's not correct. Because 300 = (k *15 * m2)/0.01 → but if k=0.0002, then (0.0002 *15 *1000)/0.01 = (0.3)/0.01=30 → 30 is not 300. So there's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, with k=0.0002, m1=15, m2=1000, r=0.1.

F = (0.0002 *15 *1000) / (0.1)^2 → numerator is (0.0002 *15000) → 3. So denominator is 0.01 → 3 /0.01 =300 → yes, that works.

Ah, right. Because 0.0002 *15000 is 3, and 3 /0.01 is 300. So correct.

So option B is correct.

But wait, looking back at the options:

Option B: North, 1000 → correct.

Option C: South, 1000 → correct, but the force is repulsion, so m2 must be north.

So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but another approach: the force between two poles is F = (μ0/(4π)) * (m1 m2) / r².

But if we are given that the force is 300, and we can ignore the value of μ0/(4π), perhaps we can find the ratio between the given scenario and a hypothetical scenario where the second pole is, say, a certain number of poles.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be written as F = (m1 * m2) / r², which would make the units work as dyne, pole, and centimeter.

Wait, but then in that case, the formula would be F = (m1 * m2) / r².

So, 300 = (15 * m2) / (0.1)^2 → 300 = (15 m2) / 0.01 → 300 =1500 m2 → m2=0.2.

But 0.2 of a pole is not a valid option. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is F = (m1 * m2) / (4π ε0 r²), but in any case, without knowing the exact form, perhaps another approach is better.

Looking at the options, the only possible solution that gives a valid force is B, which is a north pole with 1000 poles, leading to F=300.

So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The problem involves two magnetic poles repelling each other with a force of 300 dynes, placed 10 cm apart. The first pole has a strength of 15 poles and is a south pole. The task is to determine the nature and strength of the second pole, which must be a north pole (opposite to south), and to ensure the force is repulsive.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Force Formula**: The force between two magnetic poles is given by:
   \[
   F = \frac{k \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
   \]
   where \(k\) is a constant, \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the strengths of the poles, and \(r\) is the distance between them.

2. **Given Data**:
   - \(F = 300 \, \text{dynes}\)
   - \(m_1 = 15 \, \text{poles}\) (south pole)
   - \(r = 10 \, \text{cm} = 0.1 \, \text{m}\)

3. **Rearranging the Formula**:
   \[
   F = \frac{k \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
   \]
   Solving for \(k \cdot m_2\):
   \[
   k \cdot m_2 = \frac{F \cdot r^2}{m_1}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   k \cdot m_2 = \frac{300 \cdot (0.1)^2}{15} = \frac{300 \cdot 0.01}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = 0.2
   \]

4. **Determining \(m_2\)**:
   The second pole must be a north pole (opposite to south). Let \(m_2\) be the strength of the north pole in poles. From the rearranged formula:
   \[
   k \cdot m_2 = 0.2
   \]
   To find \(m_2\), we can test the options provided:
   - **Option B**: North pole, \(m_2 = 1000\)
     \[
     k \cdot 1000 = 0.2 \implies k = 0.0002
     \]
     Substituting back:
     \[
     F = \frac{0.0002 \cdot 15 \cdot 1000}{0.1^2} = \frac{3}{0.01} = 300 \, \text{dynes}
     \]
     This is correct.

5. **Other Options**:
   - **Option C**: South pole, \(m_2 = 1000\)
     \[
     k \cdot 1000 = 0.2 \implies k = 0.0002
     \]
     Substituting back:
     \[
     F = \frac{0.0002 \cdot 15 \cdot 1000}{0.01} = \frac{3}{0.01} = 300 \, \text{dynes}
     \]
     This is also correct. However, the second pole must be a north pole, so this option is invalid.
   - **Option F**: North pole, \(m_2 = 2000\)
     \[
     k \cdot 2000 = 0.2 \implies k = 0.0001
     \]
     Substituting back:
     \[
     F = \frac{0.0001 \cdot 15 \cdot 2000}{0.1^2} = \frac{3}{0.01} = 300 \, \text{dynes}
     \]
     This is correct, but the strength is higher than the given options.
   - **Option G**: South pole, \(m_2 = 1500\)
     \[
     k \cdot 1500 = 0.2 \implies k = 0.0001333
     \]
     Substituting back:
     \[
     F = \frac{0.0001333 \cdot 15 \cdot 1500}{0.1^2} = \frac{3}{0.01} = 300 \, \text{dynes}
     \]
     This is correct, but the strength is higher than the given options.
   - **Option J**: South pole, \(m_2 = 3000\)
     \[
     k \cdot 3000 = 0.2 \implies k = 0.00006666
     \]
     Substituting back:
     \[
     F = \frac{0.00006666 \cdot 15 \cdot 3000}{0.1^2} = \frac{3}{0.01} = 300 \, \text{dynes}
     \]
     This is correct, but the strength is higher than the given options.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**: North pole, strength 1000. This is the only option where the second pole is a north pole, and the force calculation matches the given data.
