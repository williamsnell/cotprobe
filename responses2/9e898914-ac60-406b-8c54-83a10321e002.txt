Okay, I need to find the row rank and column rank of the given matrix A. Let's see, the matrix is a 4x5, so it has 4 rows and 5 columns. 

First, row rank is the maximum number of linearly independent rows. Similarly, column rank is the maximum number of linearly independent columns. I remember that for any matrix, the row rank equals the column rank. So if I can find the row rank, that's the column rank too. 

Let me write down the matrix:

A = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4, -3],
  [1, 2, 0, -5, 1],
  [2, 4, -3, -19, 6],
  [3, 6, -3, -24, 7]
]

Hmm, maybe I should perform row operations to reduce it to row-echelon form. That should make it easier to see the rank.

Let me start by trying to eliminate the elements below the first pivot. The first element is 1. The second row has 1 in the first column. So I'll subtract the first row from the second row.

Row2 = Row2 - Row1:
Row2 becomes: (1-1, 2-2, 0-3, -5-4, 1-(-3)) → (0,0,-3,-9,4)

Third row: 2,4,-3,-19,6. Subtract 2*Row1:
Row3 = Row3 -2*Row1: 2-2*1=0, 4-2*2=0, -3-2*3=-9, -19-2*4=-27, 6-2*(-3)=12

Fourth row: 3,6,-3,-24,7. Subtract 3*Row1:
Row4 = Row4 -3*Row1: 3-3=0, 6-6=0, -3-3*3=-12, -24-3*4=-36, 7-3*(-3)=16

So after these operations, the modified matrix is:

Row1: [1, 2, 3, 4, -3]
Row2: [0, 0, -3, -9, 4]
Row3: [0, 0, -9, -27, 12]
Row4: [0, 0, -12, -36, 16]

Now, move to the second pivot. The second pivot is in Row2, Column2, which is 0. I need to make sure that the next rows have 0 in the second column. But let's look at Row3: the second element is 0. Let me check if the third element is non-zero. Row3 second column is 0, third is -9. So maybe I can use Row2 and Row3 to eliminate the third elements.

Wait, perhaps I should make sure that each row has a leading 1 (or leading non-zero element) in each pivot position. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed to the third pivot.

Looking at Row3, the second element is 0. So the third element is -9. Let me use Row2 to eliminate the third element in Row3. The third element of Row2 is -3, so I can multiply Row2 by (9/3) = 3 and subtract from Row3.

Row3 = Row3 - (9/3)*Row2 = Row3 -3*Row2:

Row3 becomes: 0 -3*0=0, 0-3*0=0, -9-3*(-3) = -9 +9=0, -27 -3*(-9)= -27 +27=0, 12-3*4=0.

Wait, that's zero. Hmm. So Row3 becomes all zeros after this operation. So now, the third row is all zeros.

Next, look at Row4. The second element is 0, third is -12. Let me use Row2 to eliminate the third element in Row4. Multiply Row2 by (12/(-9)) = -4/3, but perhaps it's better to use the leading element.

Wait, Row2 has a leading element of -3 in the third column. So for Row4, the third element is -12. Let me see: how many times does -3 go into -12? 4 times. So I can add 4 times Row2 to Row4.

Row4 = Row4 +4*Row2:

Row4's elements:

Third element: -12 +4*(-3) = -12 -12 = -24.

Fourth element: -36 +4*(-9) = -36-36 = -72.

Fifth element: 16 +4*4 = 16+16=32.

So Row4 becomes [0, 0, -24, -72, 32].

Wait, but perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I should continue reducing the matrix further. Let me see. After Row3 becomes all zeros, let me look at Row4. The third element is -24. To eliminate this, I can use Row2 which has a leading element of -3 in the third column. So, Row4 has third element -24, which is (-24)/(-3) =8 times Row2. So Row4 = Row4 +8*Row2.

Calculating Row4:

Third element: -24 +8*(-3)= -24 -24 = -48? Wait, no: 8*(-3) is -24. So -24 (Row4 third) + (-24) = -48?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Row2 is [0, 0, -3, -9, 4]. Multiplying by 8 gives [0,0,-24,-72,32]. Adding to Row4, which is [0,0,-24,-72,32], would give [0,0,0,0,0]. So Row4 becomes all zeros.

So now, the matrix looks like:

Row1: [1, 2, 3, 4, -3]
Row2: [0, 0, -3, -9, 4]
Row3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Row4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, the row-echelon form has two non-zero rows. So the row rank is 2.

What about the column rank? The column rank is the maximum number of linearly independent columns. Since the row rank is 2, the column rank must also be 2. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes dependencies can arise.

Looking at the columns:

Column1: [1,1,2,3]
Column2: [2,2,4,6]
Column3: [3,0,-3,-3]
Column4: [4,-5,-19,-24]
Column5: [-3,1,6,7]

Now, the first two columns: Column2 is 2*Column1. So Column2 is linearly dependent on Column1. 

Column3: Let's see if it can be expressed as a combination of the first two columns. But if Column2 is 2*Column1, then Column3 can't be expressed as a combination of Column1 and Column2 unless Column3 has a certain linear dependency. Alternatively, let's see if the columns are linearly independent.

Let me form a matrix of columns and perform row operations:

Columns as columns:

Column1: [1,1,2,3]
Column2: [2,2,4,6] → 2*[1,1,2,3]
Column3: [3,0,-3,-3]
Column4: [4,-5,-19,-24]
Column5: [-3,1,6,7]

So, Column2 is 2*Column1. So, in the column space, Column2 doesn't add any new dimension beyond Column1. Then, Column3: let me see if it can be expressed as a combination of Column1 and Column2.

Let me set up the equation: a*Column1 + b*Column2 = Column3.

Since Column2 is 2*Column1, this becomes a*Column1 + b*(2*Column1) = Column3 → (a + 2b) * Column1 = Column3.

So, we have:

a + 2b = 3 (from Column1)
a + 2b = 0 (from Column3's first element)
a + 2b = -3 (from Column3's third element)

Wait, that can't be right. Because Column1 is [1,1,2,3], and Column3 is [3,0,-3,-3]. So Column3's first element is 3*(Column1's first element) = 3*1=3. Second element: Column3 is 0, which is 3*1 + (b*2*1) → 3+2b=0 → 2b = -3 → b = -3/2.

Wait, let me check the second element of Column3: 0. Column1's second element is 1. So, Column3's second element is 0 = a*1 + b*2*1 → a + 2b =0.

If b = -3/2, then a = 2b → a = 2*(-3/2) = -3.

But then, the first element of Column3 should be a + 2b = -3 + 2*(-3/2) = -3 -3 = -6. But Column3's first element is 3. So that doesn't match. So Column3 can't be expressed as a combination of Column1 and Column2. So Column3 is adding a new dimension.

Similarly, check Column4:

Let me see if Column4 can be expressed as a combination of Column1 and Column3.

Set up: a*Column1 + b*Column3 = Column4.

So, for each element:

a*1 + b*3 =4 → a + 3b =4

a*1 + b*0 =-5 → a= -5

a*2 + b*(-3)= -19 → 2a -3b =-19

a*3 + b*(-3)= -24 → 3a -3b= -24

a*(-3) + b*6 =7 → -3a +6b=7

Wait, this seems complicated. Let me plug a = -5 into the first equation:

-5 +3b=4 → 3b=9 → b=3.

Now, check if a= -5 and b=3 satisfy the other equations.

Second equation: a +0 = -5 → -5 = -5: yes.

Third equation: 2*(-5) -3*(3) = -10 -9 = -19: matches.

Fourth equation: 3*(-5) -3*(3) = -15 -9 = -24: matches.

Fifth equation: -3*(-5) +6*(3)=15+18=33. But Column4's fifth element is 7. 33≠7. So this doesn't match.

Hmm, so Column4 can't be expressed as a combination of Column1 and Column3. So perhaps Column4 is adding a new dimension.

So, how many independent columns do we have? Let's see:

Columns 1 and 3 are independent. Column2 is dependent on Column1. Column4 is dependent on Column1 and Column3.

Wait, but Column3 is dependent on Column1? Because Column3 can't be expressed as a combination of Column1 and Column2, but wait, we saw that Column2 is 2*Column1. So Column3 cannot be expressed as a combination of Column1 (since that's all Column2 is).

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, Column1 is [1,1,2,3].

Column3 is [3,0,-3,-3].

Is Column3 a multiple of Column1? No, because the second element is 0, while Column1's is 1. So Column3 is not a multiple of Column1. So Column3 is independent of Column1. So that would mean that the column rank is 3, but that's not possible because the row rank is 2, and they are equal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the row operations. Let me double-check. 

Wait, in the row operations, when I subtract Row2 from Row3, I get Row3 as [0,0,-9,-27,12]. Then, when I subtract 2*Row1 from Row4, I get Row4 as [0,0,-12,-36,16].

Then, for Row2 and Row3: Row2 is [0,0,-3,-9,4]. Let me see if Row3 is a multiple of Row2. The third element of Row3 is -9, which is 3 times -3 (the third element of Row2). Similarly, the fourth element is -27, which is 3*(-9), and fifth element 12 is 3*4. So Row3 = 3*Row2. So Row3 is dependent on Row2. Similarly, Row4 is 8*Row2, because 8*(-3)=-24, 8*(-9)=-72, 8*4=32. So Row4 is dependent on Row2.

So after reduction, the matrix has two non-zero rows, so rank 2. Thus, row rank is 2. Therefore, column rank must be 2. But wait, when I tried to express Column3 as a combination of Column1 and Column2, it didn't work, and Column4 also didn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should form the matrix of columns and perform row reduction on that. Let me try that.

The matrix of columns is:

Col1: [1,1,2,3]
Col2: [2,2,4,6] → 2*[1,1,2,3] → Col2 is Col1 *2.
Col3: [3,0,-3,-3]
Col4: [4,-5,-19,-24]
Col5: [-3,1,6,7]

So the column matrix is:

[1 2 3 4 -3]
[1 2 0 -5 1]
[2 4 -3 -19 6]
[3 6 -3 -24 7]

Wait, that's the same as the original matrix. So to find the column rank, we can perform row reduction on the columns as if they were rows. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe I can form a matrix where each column is a row and perform row operations. But that seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: the column rank is the maximum number of linearly independent columns. Since the row rank is 2, the column rank must also be 2. So the answer would be 2 for both row and column rank.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to express Column3 and Column4, it didn't fit, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should arrange the columns in a matrix and perform row operations to see how many are independent.

Let me construct a matrix where each column is a row:

So the columns of A are the rows of this new matrix. So the new matrix is:

Row1: [1,2,3,4,-3]
Row2: [1,2,0,-5,1]
Row3: [2,4,-3,-19,6]
Row4: [3,6,-3,-24,7]

Now, perform row operations to reduce this.

Let me subtract Row1 from Row2:

Row2 = Row2 - Row1 → [0,0,-3,-9,4]

Row3 = Row3 - 2*Row1 → [0,0,-9,-27,12]

Row4 = Row4 -3*Row1 → [0,0,-3,-24,16]

Now the matrix is:

Row1: [1,2,3,4,-3]
Row2: [0,0,-3,-9,4]
Row3: [0,0,-9,-27,12]
Row4: [0,0,-3,-24,16]

Now, let's eliminate the third column. Take Row2 and Row3:

Row3 = Row3 - 3*Row2 → Row3: [0,0,0,0,0] → becomes all zeros.

Similarly, Row4 = Row4 - Row2 → Row4: [0,0, -3*(-9) + (-3)*-9? Wait, maybe it's better to do it step by step.

Wait, Row3 after Row3 = Row3 -3*Row2:

Row3 third column: -9 -3*(-3) = -9 +9=0

Fourth column: -27 -3*(-9) = -27 +27=0

Fifth column: 12 -3*4=12-12=0.

So Row3 is all zeros.

Now Row4 = Row4 - Row2:

Row4 third column: -3 - (-3) =0

Fourth column: -24 - (-9) = -24+9= -15.

Fifth column:16 -4=12.

So Row4 becomes [0,0,0,-15,12].

Now, the matrix is:

Row1: [1,2,3,4,-3]
Row2: [0,0,-3,-9,4]
Row3: [0,0,0,0,0]
Row4: [0,0,0,-15,12]

Now, we can proceed to reduce further. Let me eliminate the fourth column in Row2 and Row4.

Row4 = Row4 +15*Row2 → Row4: [0,0,0, -15 +15*(-9)=? Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I can set up the equation for Row4.

Row4 is [0,0,0,-15,12]. We need to make sure this is in reduced form.

Let me factor out -3: Row4 becomes [-3*(0,0,0,5,-4)] → [0,0,0,5,-4], but perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, instead, let me consider that Row4 is [0,0,0,-15,12]. Let me see if I can eliminate the fourth column by adding 5 times Row2 to Row4.

Wait, Row2 is [0,0,-3,-9,4]. Multiply by 5: 0,0,-15,-45,20. Now, add to Row4:

Row4: 0,0,0, -15 + (-15)= -30, 12 +20=32.

Wait, this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out a -3 from Row4.

Wait, another approach: since the first two columns are linearly dependent on Column1, perhaps the rank is 2. So the column rank should be 2. Therefore, the row rank and column rank are both 2.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to express Column4, it didn't fit. Maybe I should find a combination that works.

Wait, let's try to create a linear combination of the columns that equals a standard basis vector. For example, to get e1 = [1,0,0,0,0], perhaps I can find a combination a*Col1 + b*Col2 + c*Col3 + d*Col4 = e1.

But since Col2 is 2*Col1, Col2 =2 Col1 → Col2 = 2Col1. So Col2 = 2 Col1, so 2 Col1 - Col2 =0. So Col2 is a linear combination of Col1.

Wait, but that doesn't help me get e1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can form a combination of other columns that would give me e1. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can consider that the column rank is the dimension of the column space, which is the same as the row rank. So if the row rank is 2, the column rank is also 2.

Therefore, the correct answer should be row rank 2, column rank 2. Looking at the options, I don't see any options with 2 and 2. Wait, let me look back at the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4,2

B) 2,3

C) 2,2

D) 3,2

Wait, the options don't include 2,2 as an option. Wait, no, looking back: the options are:

A)4,2

B)2,3

C)2,2

D)3,2

Ah, so option C is 2,2. Which matches what I concluded that row rank is 2, column rank is 2.

So the answer should be C) 2,2.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to express the columns, I couldn't find a way to get e1. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the row rank is 2, the column rank must also be 2, so the answer is C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is to consider that the maximum number of linearly independent rows is 2, so the maximum number of linearly independent columns is also 2. Hence, row rank = column rank =2. So the correct option is C) 2,2.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think about the initial matrix again. Maybe the row rank is 3, and the column rank is 2. But according to the row reduction steps, I ended up with 2 non-zero rows. So row rank is 2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Wait, the original matrix after row operations had two non-zero rows. So row rank is 2.

If the column rank is 2, then the correct option is C)2,2.

So I think the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The given matrix is a 4x5 matrix. After performing row operations, we find that there are two non-zero rows. Therefore, the row rank is 2.

Since the row rank equals the column rank (by the rank-nullity theorem), the column rank is also 2.

Thus, the correct answer is option C) 2, 2.

ANSWER: C
