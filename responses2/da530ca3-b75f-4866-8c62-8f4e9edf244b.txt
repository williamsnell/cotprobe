Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about solubility and Ksp. Hmm, let me think about this. The question is about finding the concentration of Ca²+ ions in a saturated solution of CaSO4 in 0.0100 M Na2SO4. The Ksp of CaSO4 is given as 2.4e-5. 

Wait, so what's the setup here? I remember that when a compound is dissolved in a solution that already contains a cation or anion, it affects the solubility. In this case, the solution is of Na2SO4, which is a strong electrolyte. So Na2SO4 dissociates completely into 2Na+ and SO4^2- ions.

The CaSO4 is a sparingly soluble salt. Its dissolution would produce Ca²+ and SO4^2- ions. The reaction would be CaSO4(s) ⇌ Ca²+(aq) + SO4^2-(aq). The Ksp expression would be Ksp = [Ca²+][SO4^2-].

But wait, the solution already has 0.0100 M of SO4^2- from the Na2SO4. That's a significant amount, so the [SO4^2-] isn't negligible. So the Ksp expression here would involve the initial concentration of SO4 from Na2SO4 and the change from the dissolution of CaSO4.

Let me denote the solubility of CaSO4 in this solution as 's'. Then, when CaSO4 dissolves, it will release 's' moles per liter of Ca²+ and 's' moles per liter of SO4^2-.

But wait, the solution already has 0.0100 M SO4^2- from Na2SO4. So the total [SO4^2-] would be 0.0100 + s. But since s is likely going to be small compared to 0.0100 M, maybe I can approximate it. Wait, but wait. Let me think: the Ksp is 2.4e-5. Let me calculate what 's' would be.

If I don't make the approximation, then the expression is Ksp = s (0.0100 + s). But if s is small, then 0.0100 + s ≈ 0.0100. Let's see if that's valid. Let's plug in the numbers.

Assuming s is small, so 0.0100 + s ≈ 0.0100. So Ksp = s * 0.0100 → s = Ksp / 0.0100 = (2.4e-5) / 0.0100 = 2.4e-3 M. Wait, but that would make [Ca²+] = 2.4e-3. Hmm, but wait, let's check the approximation again.

Wait, 2.4e-3 is 0.0024 M. The initial concentration of SO4^2- is 0.0100 M. So 0.0100 + 0.0024 = 0.0124 M. So the actual [SO4^2-] is a bit higher than 0.0100. But for a rough estimate, since s is 0.0024, which is about 2.4% of 0.0100, the approximation s ≈ 0.0024 is probably acceptable. Alternatively, do I need to check if neglecting s would give a good approximation?

Wait, let me see: Ksp = s*(0.0100 + s) = s*(0.0100 + s) → s = Ksp / (0.0100 + s). Let's approximate s as 2.4e-3. So 0.0100 + 2.4e-3 = 0.0124. So s = (2.4e-5) / 0.0124 ≈ 1.92e-3. Hmm, wait, that's about 1.92e-3, which is less than 2.4e-3. So my initial approximation was a little off. So maybe I should set up the equation without approximation.

Wait, let's write it correctly. Let me call 's' the solubility of CaSO4 in the presence of Na2SO4. So when CaSO4 dissolves, it contributes s of Ca²+ and s of SO4^2-. But the total SO4 from Na2SO4 is 0.0100 M, so the total [SO4^2-] is 0.0100 + s.

So Ksp = [Ca²+][SO4^2-] = s*(0.0100 + s) = 2.4e-5.

So the equation is s*(0.0100 + s) = 2.4e-5.

Let me expand this: 0.0100 s + s² = 2.4e-5.

Rearranging: s² + 0.0100 s - 2.4e-5 =0.

This is a quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=0.0100, c= -2.4e-5.

So discriminant D = (0.0100)^2 + 4*(1)*(2.4e-5) = 0.0001 + 9.6e-5.

Compute that: 0.0001 is 1e-4, which is 1000e-6. 9.6e-5 is 0.96e-4. So adding gives 1.96e-4. Square root of 1.96e-4 is 0.014.

So s = [-0.0100 ± 0.014]/(2*1).

Taking the positive root because concentration can't be negative. So ( -0.0100 + 0.014 ) = 0.004 / 2 = 0.002. So s=0.002 M.

Wait, but when I did the approximation, I got s=1.92e-3 (about 0.00192 M), which is about 0.002 M. So the approximation is valid here because 0.002 is 2% of 0.0100 (which is 0.01 M). So the approximation is acceptable.

So [Ca²+] is s = 0.002 M. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 0.002. Let me check the options.

Wait, looking at the options: A is 2.4e-5, B is 2e-3, C is 1.2e-2, D is 5e-3, E is 8e-5, F is 7.5e-4, G is 1e-3, H is 3e-3, I is 6e-4, J is 4.8e-5.

Hmm, 0.002 is 2e-3, which is option B. But wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because wait, when you dissolve CaSO4, the solution already has SO4^2- from Na2SO4. So according to the Ksp expression, when CaSO4 dissolves, it produces Ca²+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, but another approach: Let me think about the total moles of Ca²+ and SO4^2-.

Let me denote S as the solubility of CaSO4. So when CaSO4 dissolves, it contributes S of Ca²+ and S of SO4^2-.

But the solution already has 0.0100 M of SO4^2- from Na2SO4. So the total [SO4^2-] is 0.0100 + S.

The Ksp is [Ca²+][SO4^2-] = S*(0.0100 + S) = 2.4e-5.

As we saw earlier, solving this gives S ≈ 0.002 M. So [Ca²+] is 0.002 M, which is 2e-3 M. So the answer would be option B: 2.0e-3.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 2e-3. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 2.4e-5

B:2.0e-3

C:1.2e-2

D:5e-3

E:8e-5

F:7.5e-4

G:1e-3

H:3e-3

I:6e-4

J:4.8e-5

So option B is 2e-3. So that's our answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that when I did the approximation, I had [Ca²+] = 2.4e-3, but the exact solution is 0.002, which is 2e-3.

Wait, but wait another thing. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it another way. Let's consider that the solution already has a lot of sulfate ions, which would shift the solubility.

Wait, no, the Ksp calculation I did should be correct. Because the Ksp is given as 2.4e-5, so the product of the concentrations of Ca²+ and SO4^2- should equal that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation more carefully.

Let me write the equation again: S*(0.0100 + S) = 2.4e-5.

We can let S be much smaller than 0.0100, so 0.0100 + S ≈ 0.0100. Then S = 2.4e-5 / 0.0100 = 2.4e-3. Which is 0.002.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in that approximation. Let me plug S=0.002 into the equation to see if it holds.

So S*(0.0100 + S) = 0.002 * (0.0100 + 0.002) = 0.002 * 0.012 = 0.000024 = 2.4e-5. That's exactly equal to Ksp. So yes, the exact calculation gives S=0.002, which is 2e-3. So the answer should be option B: 2.0 × 10^-3.

To calculate the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions in a saturated solution of CaSO₄ in a 0.0100 M Na₂SO₄ solution, we start with the solubility equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaSO}_4(s) \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+}(aq) + \text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq)
\]

The solubility product constant is given as \( K_{sp} = 2.4 \times 10^{-5} \). The solution already contains 0.0100 M SO₄²⁻ from the dissociation of Na₂SO₄. Let the solubility of CaSO₄ in this solution be \( s \) (in mol/L). Then, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ from the dissolution of CaSO₄ are both \( s \). However, the total concentration of SO₄²⁻ in the solution is:

\[
[\text{SO}_4^{2-}] = 0.0100 + s
\]

Substituting into the \( K_{sp} \) expression:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{SO}_4^{2-}] = s(0.0100 + s)
\]

Since \( s \) is expected to be small compared to 0.0100 M, the approximation \( 0.0100 + s \approx 0.0100 \) is valid. Substituting this approximation:

\[
s = \frac{K_{sp}}{0.0100} = \frac{2.4 \times 10^{-5}}{0.0100} = 2.4 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

To verify, we can solve the quadratic equation \( s^2 + 0.0100s - 2.4 \times 10^{-5} = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 0.0100 \), and \( c = -2.4 \times 10^{-5} \). The discriminant is:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (0.0100)^2 - 4(1)(-2.4 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.96 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{\Delta} = 0.014
\]

Substituting back:

\[
s = \frac{-0.0100 \pm 0.014}{2}
\]

The positive root gives:

\[
s = \frac{0.004}{2} = 0.002 \, \text{M}
\]

This is consistent with the approximation. Thus, the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions is \( 0.002 \, \text{M} \), or \( 2.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \).

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
