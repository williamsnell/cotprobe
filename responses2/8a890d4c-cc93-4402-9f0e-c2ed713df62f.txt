Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I'm given a=7 and b=13. The question is asking for the number of even positive integers less than ab. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to find the value of ab. Since a is 7 and b is 13, ab would be 7 multiplied by 13. Let me calculate that: 7*13 is 91. So ab is 91.

Now, the problem is asking for even positive integers less than 91. Wait, even positive integers. So I need to find how many even numbers are there from 1 up to 90, because 91 is the upper limit, and we're looking for numbers less than that.

Wait, no, wait. The number less than ab is 91, so the numbers we're considering are from 1 up to 90 (since 91 is not included). So we need to find how many even numbers are there between 1 and 90 inclusive.

How do I calculate that? Well, I remember that the number of even numbers less than or equal to a certain number can be found by dividing that number by 2 and taking the floor of it. But wait, since we're starting from 1, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, the count of even numbers up to n is floor(n/2). But let's test this. For example, numbers up to 2: 1 even (2). So 2/2=1. Correct. Up to 3: 1 even (2). 3/2 is 1.5, floor is 1. Correct. Up to 4: 2 evens (2 and 4). 4/2=2. Correct. So yes, the formula is floor(n / 2) gives the count of even numbers up to n.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, in our case, the upper limit is 90. So n is 90. So 90 divided by 2 is 45. So there are 45 even numbers from 1 to 90. So the answer should be 45.

Looking at the options, option B is 45. So is that the answer? Hmm, but wait, let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: the even numbers are 2,4,6,..., up to 90. How many terms are in this sequence? The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is 2 and d is 2. So 90 = 2 + (n-1)*2. Subtract 2: 88 = (n-1)*2. Divide by 2: 44 = n-1. So n=45. Yep, same result.

So the number of even positive integers less than 91 is 45. So the correct answer is option B.

The number of even positive integers less than \( ab \) (where \( a = 7 \) and \( b = 13 \), so \( ab = 91 \)) is calculated by determining how many even numbers exist up to 90. Using the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence, we find there are 45 even numbers. 

Answer: B
