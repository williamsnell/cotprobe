Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about an ideal gas escaping a reversible isothermal vacuum is correct. Hmm, let's think about the basics.

First, I remember that when a gas escapes into a vacuum, it's doing work. Work done by the system is usually considered as expansion work, which is PΔV. But wait, since the process is isothermal and reversible, the pressure change is... I think it's zero because it's a reversible process. Oh right, in a reversible isothermal expansion, the external pressure equals the internal pressure. So, the work done by the gas would be PΔV. But wait, the problem says it's escaping into a vacuum, so the external pressure is zero. Wait no, wait, no, wait. The gas is allowed to escape into a vacuum, so if the system is the gas, and it's expanding into a vacuum (external pressure zero), but wait, the process is isothermal and reversible. Oh wait, that's not possible because in a reversible isothermal expansion, the external pressure must equal the internal pressure. But if the gas is expanding into a vacuum, the external pressure is zero. So I'm confused. Are the conditions here different?

Wait, actually, wait. The process is of an ideal gas escaping into a vacuum. So the system is the gas, and it's expanding into vacuum, which is zero pressure. But in a reversible process, the external pressure should match the internal pressure. So if the external pressure is zero, the internal pressure must be zero. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the process is that the gas is expanding into a vacuum, which is a region of zero pressure. But in reality, the gas is expanding, doing work. But since the process is isothermal and reversible, the external pressure would adjust to match the internal pressure. But if the external pressure is zero, the internal pressure would also be zero. That can't be right, because the gas is expanding. So maybe I need to rethink.

Wait, perhaps the gas is expanding into a vacuum, but the process is still considered as a reversible expansion. So the external pressure is zero, but the internal pressure would still be the same as the surrounding. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the process isn't reversible in this scenario because the external pressure is zero, and the internal pressure is non-zero. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each statement.

The first statement: W = 0, ΔE = q = positive number. So work done by the system is zero? That doesn't make sense because expansion into a vacuum would do work. So statement 1's first part is wrong.

Wait, but wait, if the gas is expanding into a vacuum, the external pressure is zero. So the system's pressure is same as the external pressure, so no work done. So W would be zero. But wait, no, wait. Wait, W is the work done by the system. So if the system is expanding into a vacuum, then the system's pressure is higher than the external pressure (zero), so work is done. But in a reversible process, the external pressure has to equal the internal pressure. So if the external pressure is zero, the internal pressure is zero. That's impossible because the gas can't have zero pressure. So perhaps the scenario is different.

Wait, perhaps the process is not reversible. Wait, no, the problem says it's a reversible process. So the process is such that the external pressure equals the internal pressure. But if the gas is expanding into a vacuum, the external pressure is zero. So the internal pressure would have to be zero, meaning the gas is not present. But that can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake in understanding the process.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is of the gas expanding into a vacuum, but the work done is zero because the external pressure is zero. So the work done by the system is W = -P_ext ΔV. If P_ext is zero, then W is zero. So statement 1's first part is correct: W=0.

Wait, but for statement 1, W is 0, and ΔE = q. So q is positive, which makes sense because the gas is absorbing heat. So statement 1 is correct? Or is the gas doing work? Wait, no, in the system, the gas is expanding, doing work on the surroundings. So from the system's perspective, work is done by the system. So W is positive, but in the first statement, it says W=0, which would imply no work is done, which can't be right because the system is expanding.

Wait, I'm getting confused about the sign conventions. In thermodynamics, work done by the system is considered positive. So if the gas is expanding into a vacuum, and the process is reversible, then the work done by the system would be W = P_ext * ΔV. But since P_ext is zero, the work is zero. So statement 1's first part is W=0, which is correct.

So statement 1 says W=0, ΔE=q=positive number. Since the process is isothermal, the internal energy doesn't change, so ΔE=0. So q would be positive, which makes statement 1 correct.

Second statement: w = PΔV + VΔP. Hmm, is that correct? Wait, no, that seems off. The first law is ΔE = q + w, where w is work done on the system. Or sometimes it's written as ΔU = q - P_ext ΔV. Wait, but in this case, the system is the gas. So the work done by the system is P_ext ΔV. Since the process is reversible, P_ext equals the internal pressure, which I thought was zero, but that's impossible. So the statement may be incorrect.

I think in a reversible process, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV. But if the external pressure is zero, the work is zero. So statement 2 says w = PΔV + VΔP. I'm not sure about that. It doesn't look right. So statement 2 is incorrect.

Third statement: w = PΔV, ΔE = 0, q = - PΔV and is negative. Wait, wait, the work done by the system is PΔV. The change in internal energy (ΔE) is zero because it's isothermal. So the heat q would be equal to negative work done by the system (because from ΔE = q + w, where w is work done on system; but wait, some conventions have w as work done by system. So ΔE = q - w). So if the system does work, q is positive. Wait, in this case, the work done by the system is PΔV.

So ΔE=0. So q = ΔE + w = 0 + w. So q would be positive. But the statement says q is negative. That would mean statement 3 is incorrect.

Wait, let me write it down: ΔE = q + w (if w is work done on system), but in some conventions, w is work done by system. So then, ΔE = q - w. So if work done by system is positive, q is positive.

In our case, work done by the system is PΔV. Since it's reversible, this is correct. So w = PΔV. The internal energy change, ΔE, is zero because it's isothermal. So q = ΔE + w = 0 + w. So q is positive. So statement 3 says q is negative, which is wrong. So statement 3 is incorrect.

Fourth statement: ΔE = 0, q = -w = positive number. So q is negative? No, because in isothermal expansion, the gas absorbs heat. So q is positive. So q = -w would imply q is negative, which can't be. So statement 4 is incorrect.

Wait, wait, statement 4 says ΔE = 0, q = -w = positive number. So q is negative, which can't be because it's isothermal expansion, heat is absorbed. So statement 4 is incorrect.

Fifth statement: w=0, q=0, ΔE=0. So all correct? Well, the process is isothermal and reversible, so the internal energy remains constant. But wait, the gas is expanding into a vacuum. So work would be zero. Let me think again.

Wait, work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV. But since it's in a reversible process, P_ext equals the internal pressure. So if the internal pressure is zero, the work W is zero. So w (work done by system) is zero. So statement 5 says w=0, q=0, ΔE=0. Is that correct?

Wait, wait, but in a reversible isothermal expansion into a vacuum, the internal pressure is zero. So the work done is P_ext * ΔV. But P_ext is zero. So W=0. So statement 5's first part is correct. But then the system's internal energy doesn't change, so ΔE=0. And since the process is isothermal, the heat q is positive. So statement 5 says q=0, which is incorrect because q is positive.

So statement 5 is incorrect.

Now let's go back to the initial statements.

Looking at the options, let's see:

1. Correct? W=0, ΔE = q (positive). So yes.

2. Incorrect, since the expression seems wrong.

3. Incorrect, because q is positive, not negative.

4. Incorrect, because q is positive, not negative.

5. Incorrect, because q is positive, not zero.

So statements 1 is correct, and the others are incorrect.

Looking at the options: option D says "Statement 1 is correct". Option F says "Statements 2,4,5 are correct", etc.

Wait, option F says statements 2,4,5 correct. But from our analysis, only statement 1 is correct. So the options:

Looking at the options:

A: All correct → No, because others are wrong.

B: 3 and 4 → No, because 3 and 4 are wrong.

C: 2 and 5 → No, because 2 is wrong, 5 is wrong.

D: Statement 1 is correct → yes.

E: Statement 2 is correct → no.

F: 2,4,5 correct → no.

So the correct option is D: only Statement 1 is correct.

To determine which statements are correct when an ideal gas is allowed to escape reversibly and isothermally into a vacuum, we analyze each statement based on thermodynamic principles and the given scenario.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Statement 1**: \( W = 0 \), \( \Delta E = q = \text{positive number} \).  
   - For a reversible isothermal expansion into a vacuum, the work done by the system is \( W = P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V \). Since \( P_{\text{ext}} = 0 \) (the external pressure is zero, and the gas expands into a vacuum), \( W = 0 \).  
   - The internal energy change \( \Delta E \) is zero because the process is isothermal. By the first law of thermodynamics, \( \Delta E = q - W \), which implies \( q = W = 0 \). However, since the gas absorbs heat during expansion, \( q \) is positive. Thus, this statement is correct.

2. **Statement 2**: \( w = P \Delta V + V \Delta P \).  
   - This statement is incorrect because the correct expression for work in a reversible process is \( w = P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V \). The term \( V \Delta P \) does not align with the principles of thermodynamics.

3. **Statement 3**: \( w = P \Delta V \), \( \Delta E = 0 \), \( q = -P \Delta V \) (negative number).  
   - The work done by the system is \( w = P \Delta V \), which is correct. The internal energy change \( \Delta E \) is zero because the process is isothermal. However, the heat \( q \) is positive (heat is absorbed by the gas during expansion), so \( q = -w \) is incorrect. Thus, this statement is incorrect.

4. **Statement 4**: \( \Delta E = 0 \), \( q = -w = \text{positive number} \).  
   - The internal energy change \( \Delta E \) is zero because the process is isothermal. However, the heat \( q \) is positive, and \( q = -w \) implies \( q \) is negative, which contradicts the fact that heat is absorbed during expansion. Thus, this statement is incorrect.

5. **Statement 5**: \( w = 0 \), \( q = 0 \), \( \Delta E = 0 \).  
   - The work done by the system \( w = P \Delta V \) is zero because \( P_{\text{ext}} = 0 \). Therefore, \( w = 0 \). The internal energy change \( \Delta E \) is zero because the process is isothermal. However, the heat \( q \) is positive (heat is absorbed by the gas during expansion). Thus, this statement is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
- Only **Statement 1** is correct.
