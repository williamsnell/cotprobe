Question:

A nephew inherited a large parcel of unimproved land from his uncle. In need of cash, the nephew decided to sell the parcel. He contacted a real estate agent in the area about listing the parcel for sale. The nephew and the agent entered into a valid written contract whereby the agent promised to undertake best efforts to find a buyer for the parcel. The contract also provided that the agent was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The agent succeeded in finding a buyer for the parcel. The agent notified the nephew that he had found a developer who wanted to purchase the parcel for $500,000. The agent handed the nephew a real estate sales contract, signed by the developer, in which the developer agreed to pay $500,000 for the purchase of the parcel. The nephew then signed the agreement himself. However, before consummation of the sale and transfer of title, the developer, without cause, repudiated the contract. Despite the agent's insistence, the nephew refused to either sue the developer to enforce the land sale contract or pay the agent his commission. If the agent sues the nephew for breach of the brokerage agreement, which of the following, if anything, is the agent's proper measure of recovery?

Options:

A: Nothing, because the nephew did not breach the brokerage agreement.
B: $25,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for $500,000, because all conditions precedent to the nephew's duty to pay the commission were substantially fulfilled when the nephew and the developer entered into the land sale contract.
C: $10,000, as a partial commission due to the agent's work done before the sale was cancelled.
D: $12,500, or half the commission, because the sale reached the halfway point when the nephew and the developer signed the contract.
E: Nothing, because as a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the nephew and the developer, the agent can enforce the contract only against the developer, but not against the nephew.
F: $25,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$500,000, because fulfillment of the consummation condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control.
G: $25,000, because the agent provided a buyer and thus fulfilled his part of the contract.
H: Nothing, because the sale did not go through and hence no commission is due.
I: Nothing, because the consummation condition has not been fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal to sue the developer will not excuse that condition.
J: $25,000, because the agent upheld his end of the contract in making his best efforts to find a buyer for the parcel.

Okay, so I have this real estate question here. Let me read through it carefully. The nephew sold land by entering into a contract with his uncle. The contract said the agent would take best efforts to find a buyer and be paid a 5% commission on the sale. The agent found a developer willing to buy for $500k, handed over a contract, and the nephew signed himself. But the developer repudiated before the sale was done. The nephew refused to sue the developer for the commission.

So the question is about the agent's proper measure of recovery if the nephew sues for breach of the brokerage agreement. The options are A to J, with various amounts and reasons.

Hmm. I remember that real estate agents have to fulfill certain conditions to be liable for their commissions. The main conditions are that the contract must be valid, the agent must have done their due diligence, and the sale must be completed. Also, any delays or actions by the buyer that hinder the sale can lead to the agent being liable.

In this case, the nephew signed a contract, but the developer repudiated. The nephew didn't breach the contract because he signed, but the agent was supposed to be liable. The issue is whether the agent's breach can be compensated because of the repudiation.

Wait, the agent was supposed to be doing the best efforts, but the buyer didn't go through. The contract was signed and the developer agreed to pay $500k, but the sale didn't happen. So the agent's duty is to be liable for the commission regardless of the buyer's actions, as long as the contract was valid.

But wait, the question is whether the nephew can sue the agent for breach of the brokerage agreement. So the agent's duty is to act in the best interest of the buyer. If the agent didn't act, and the buyer didn't get the sale done, that can be a breach.

So the agent's measure of recovery would involve calculating the commission despite the repudiation. But wait, the contract was signed, so does the agent have to pay? Or is it that the commission is a duty regardless of the buyer's actions.

I think the key point is that the agent's duty is to be the agent, so even if the buyer repudiated, the agent still had to pay. But in this case, the sale didn't happen because the developer repudiated. So the agent's duty is to be liable, and the nephew's refusal to sue doesn't excuse that.

Wait, but the question is, what's the right measure. Let's think about the brokerage agreement. The agent is a broker, so they are legally responsible. If the agent didn't make the due diligence, but the contract was signed, the agent is still liable.

However, the problem is the repudiation by the buyer. The agent's duty to act in the best interest is whether the buyer was acting in that interest. If the buyer repudiated, the agent may have breached their duty.

Alternatively, the question says the agent's contract was signed by the developer, but the nephew didn't breach, but the developer didn't act. The issue is the agent's duty to the developerâ€”did the agent act in the developer's best interest?

Wait, the agent was supposed to be the best efforts. But the developer didn't act, so perhaps the agent's duty to the developer is breached. But the question is about the agent's measure of recovery, the monetary amount.

The question is, what's the right recovery for the agent against the nephew? The options suggest it's either $25k (which is 5% of 500k), or some partial amount.

Wait, the agent's commission is 5% of the sale price. So if the sale was $500k, commission is $25k. But the sale didn't happen because the developer repudiated. So the agent's duty is to be liable, but because the sale didn't go through, the agent has to pay, regardless of the repudiation.

But wait, the agent was supposed to act in the best interest. If the buyer didn't act, perhaps the agent's duty to the buyer was breached. But the question is about the agent's measure of recovery against the nephew.

The options include $25k as a possible answer. So, if the nephew tried to sue, the agent's measure would be the commission. But the reason given is that the conditions were fulfilled when he signed, but the sale didn't go through.

Alternatively, the nephew didn't breach the contract, but the agent's duty was to be liable because the buyer didn't act. So in that case, the agent's measure of recovery would be the commission.

Wait, but the agent's contract was signed by the developer. The nephew didn't breach the contract, but the developer didn't act. So the agent was supposed to be acting in the best interest of the developer. But the sale didn't occur because the developer didn't do anything.

So the agent's duty to the developer was breached because the developer didn't act. But the question is about the agent's measure against the nephew. So the agent's duty is to pay the commission regardless of the buyer's actions, as the contract was valid.

So the agent's measure of recovery would be the commission, which is $25k. So the correct answer is option B, $25k, because all conditions were met when the nephew signed the contract. The fact that the sale was canceled by the repudiation doesn't excuse the condition.

Wait, but the agent's duty is to act in the best interest of the buyer. So the fact that the developer didn't act doesn't excuse the agent's duty to pay. So the agent can recover the commission even if the buyer didn't act.

Therefore, the correct measure is $25k, which is 5% of 500k. So the answer is B.

The nephew's situation involves a breach of the brokerage agreement under real estate law. The agent was supposed to act in the best interest of the buyer, but the buyer repudiated, leading to the sale failing. The agent's duty to be liable for the commission remains intact as the contract was valid when the nephew signed it. The sale was canceled due to the repudiation, but the agent's duty to act in the best interest of the buyer is still owed.

The correct measure of recovery for the agent is the commission, which is 5% of the sale price ($500,000), equating to $25,000. This amount reflects the agent's duty to be liable for the commission regardless of the buyer's actions. The fact that the sale did not proceed does not excuse the condition.

**Answer: B: $25,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for $500,000, because all conditions precedent to the nephew's duty to pay the commission were substantially fulfilled when the nephew and the developer entered into the land sale contract.**
