Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what color Uncle Sam's goatee is. The options are all different shades of grey, ranging from A to J. Let me think about this. 

I remember that Uncle Sam's goatee is a well-known image in American culture. I think it's often depicted in shades of grey. Now, I'm trying to recall any specific colors I've seen or heard. 

Wait, I think it's more of a neutral grey. I remember that the goatee is usually black with white markings, but the color itself is grey. So looking at the options, I need to pick the grey shade that best fits. 

Options C is grey, D is black. But the question is about the goatee's color, not the dog's face. So the dog's face is usually depicted in white with black features, but the goatee's color is a different shade. I'm pretty sure the goatee is grey, not black. So the correct answer should be C, grey.

The correct answer is C: grey.
