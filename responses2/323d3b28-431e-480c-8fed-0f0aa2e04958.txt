Okay, I need to figure out which option Taurek is making here. The question is about the ethics of multiple losses versus single losses. Let me think about the different options.

Option A says the death of two people is always worse than one. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. I remember that in ethics, when you have multiple losses, the total can be worse, better, or neutral depending on the situation. So A is probably wrong.

Option B claims that it's sometimes less bad than one. So sometimes, two people's deaths are worse than one. That makes sense because if you have two people's loss, maybe their combined impact is more severe than one, especially if they're related or if the situation doesn't allow for one to be fixed. So B sounds plausible.

Option C says it's always exactly the same, which contradicts what I thought about A. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D says the sum should be rejected, implying that the total of two is worse. That would align with A, but I'm not sure. Wait, some theories might say that adding losses is worse, but others might say it's neutral. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I'm trying to remember. In philosophy, when two people die, their total loss is often considered worse than one. But some argue that if they're related, maybe it's neutral. So does Taurek support the idea that two are worse than one? If A and B are about always vs sometimes, then B might be correct.

So putting it together, B says sometimes it's worse than one, which matches my understanding that two can be worse, like if you have two separate deaths that can't be fixed or something. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: the death of two people is sometimes less bad than the death of one.
