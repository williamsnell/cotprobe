Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating a drug dose. Let me take it step by step. The question says a person weighs 62 kg and their drug dose is 15 mg per kilogram. I need to find out how many grams that dose is. Hmm.

Wait, let's start by understanding the units. The weight is in kilograms, and the dose is in milligrams per kilogram. I remember that 1 mg is a thousandth of a gram, so mg is a smaller unit than grams. That might be important for the final conversion.

So the person's weight is 62 kg. The dose is 15 mg/kg. So for each kilogram, they take 15 mg of the drug. To find the total dose, I should multiply the dose per kilogram by the total weight.

Let me write that down: 15 mg/kg * 62 kg. The kilograms unit will cancel out, leaving me with milligrams. But the question asks for grams, so I'll need to convert milligrams to grams.

Wait, 15 mg/kg times 62 kg equals 15 * 62 mg. Let's calculate that. 15 *60 is 900, and 15*2 is 30, so 930 mg total.

But wait, the question wants the answer in grams. I know that 1 mg is 1/1000 grams. So 930 mg is 930 / 1000 grams. Let me do that division: 930 divided by 1000 equals 0.93 grams.

Looking back at the options, option B is 0.93. Option C is 18.6 x 10^-3, but that's 0.0186, which doesn't match. So I think B is the correct answer.

Wait, let me recheck. 15 mg/kg times 62 kg is 15*62=930 mg. 930 mg converted to grams is 0.93 grams. Yeah, that's right. So option B is correct.

The correct answer is B: 0.93.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Total Dose in Milligrams (mg):**
   - The dose is 15 mg/kg and the person weighs 62 kg.
   - Multiply: 15 mg/kg * 62 kg = 930 mg.

2. **Convert Milligrams to Grams:**
   - 1 mg = 0.001 grams.
   - Convert 930 mg to grams: 930 mg * 0.001 = 0.93 grams.

3. **Match the Correct Option:**
   - Option B is 0.93, which matches the calculated value.

**Answer:** B: 0.93
