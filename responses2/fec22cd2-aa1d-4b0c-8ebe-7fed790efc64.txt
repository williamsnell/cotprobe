Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about jet engines on an Airbus A380. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says each of the four jet engines on an A380 develops a thrust of 322,000 N. The plane is flying at 250 m/s, and I need to find out the horsepower each engine develops. The options are A through J, with various numbers. 

Wait, what's the formula for horsepower in this context? Oh right, power is related to force and velocity. Oh wait, power is force multiplied by velocity. But wait, wait, no, is it in the right units? Because the given units for force are Newtons and velocity is meters per second. Power in horsepower would require converting the units correctly.

Wait, I remember that 1 horsepower (hp) equals about 745.7 watts. So I'll need to calculate the power first in watts and then convert to horsepower.

Each engine has a thrust of 322,000 N. Wait, wait, thrust is the force. So when the plane is moving, the thrust force is the force the engine exerts backward, so that's the power being delivered by the engine. So power is F * v. 

So, power (P) = force (F) * velocity (v). Let me plug the numbers in. Force is 322,000 N. Velocity is 250 m/s. So P = 322,000 * 250.

Calculating that: 322,000 times 250. Let's break it down. 322 * 250 is 80,500. So 322,000 * 250 would be 80,500,000 watts. Oh wait, but 80.5 million watts is a huge number. That's 80.5 million W. 

Wait, 80.5 million watts is 80,500,000 W. To convert to horsepower, divide by 745.7. Let me compute that. 80,500,000 / 745.7 ≈ ?

Wait, 80,500,000 divided by 750 is approximately 107,333. But wait, 745.7 is less than 750, so the division would result in a slightly higher number. Let me calculate more accurately.

Let me compute 80,500,000 divided by 745.7.

Hmm, perhaps I can approximate it. Let's see, 745.7 * 100,000 = 74,570,000. So 80,500,000 is 80.5 million. Subtract 74.57 million, that leaves 5.93 million. 

So each 100,000 is 745.7, so 5.93 million divided by 745.7 is about 7970. So 100,000 + 7970 = 107,970. So approximately 107,970 horsepower per engine. Wait, but wait, each engine is 322,000 N. Oh wait, the question says each engine, so that's correct.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the A380 has four engines. Oh wait no, the question is asking for each engine's horsepower. So we're correct in not considering the total power.

Wait, the question is each engine. So, each engine's power is 322,000 N * 250 m/s = 80,500,000 W.

Wait, but I'm supposed to convert that to horsepower. So 80,500,000 W / 745.7 W/hp ≈ let me calculate that.

745.7 * 100,000 = 74,570,000. 80,500,000 -74,570,000 =5,930,000.

Now, 5.93e6 / 745.7 = approximately 7970.

So 100,000 hp would be 74,570,000 W. 7970 would be 7970 *745.7.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 80,500,000 / 745.7.

Let me do this step by step.

745.7 * 107,970 = let's see.

Wait, 745.7 * 100,000 =74,570,000.

745.7 * 7,970 = let's compute that.

745.7 * 7,000 = 5,219,900.

745.7 * 970 = let's see:

745.7 * 900 = 671,130.

745.7 *70 =52,200.

So 671,130+52,200=723,330.

Adding to 5,219,900: 5,219,900 +723,330=5,943,230.

So total would be 74,570,000 +5,943,230=80,513,230 W.

So 745.7 * 107,970 ≈80,513,230, which is very close to 80,500,000. So the value is approximately 107,970 horsepower.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 108,000. Let me look at the options: option E is 108,000; option I is 100,000; option J is 95,000. So the closest is option E, 108,000 hp.

Wait, but wait, the problem says each engine. So each engine's power is 322,000 N * 250 m/s = 80,500,000 W.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

322,000 *250.

322,000 *250 = 322,000 * (200 +50) = 322,000*200=64,400,000; 322,000*50=16,100,000. Sum is 64,400,000 +16,100,000 =80,500,000 W. So that's correct.

Now, 80,500,000 W divided by 745.7 W/hp.

Compute 80,500,000 /745.7.

Let me compute 745.7 × 100,000 =74,570,000. So 745.7 ×107,970 = approx 80,513,230. So 107,970 hp. But the options have 108,000. So 108,000 hp is the closest.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 322,000 N is 322,000. 322,000 *250 = 80,500,000.

Divide by 745.7: 80,500,000 /745.7 ≈ 107,970 hp.

So the closest option is E: 108,000 hp.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute 80,500,000 ÷745.7.

Compute 745.7 ×100,000=74,570,000.

Subtract that from 80,500,000: 80,500,000-74,570,000=5,930,000.

Now, 5,930,000 ÷745.7 ≈ let's compute 745.7 * 7970 = ?

745.7 * 7000=5,219,900.

745.7 *970=745.7*(900+70)=745.7*900=671,130; 745.7*70=52,199.

So 671,130 +52,199=723,329.

Adding to 5,219,900 gives 5,219,900 +723,329=5,943,229.

So 745.7 *7970≈5,943,229.

Then, 5,930,000 divided by 745.7 is about 7970.

So total is 100,000 +7970 =107,970 hp.

So approximately 108,000 hp. So option E is 108,000.

Wait, but looking at the options again: The choices are A to J, with E being 108,000. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the calculation I did earlier was 322000 N *250 m/s =80,500,000 W. Then 80,500,000 /745.7 ≈107,970 hp. So the closest option is E:108,000 hp.

But let me think again. Another approach: Maybe I should calculate hp directly.

Wait, 1 hp =745.7 W.

So, hp = (F * v) / (745.7)

So, F=322,000 N, v=250 m/s.

So, hp = (322,000 *250) / 745.7

As calculated before, 322,000 *250 =80,500,000.

Divide by 745.7: 80,500,000 /745.7 ≈107970.

So about 108,000 hp. So option E is correct.

To determine the horsepower developed by each jet engine on an Airbus A380, we use the formula for power in terms of force and velocity:

\[
\text{Power (P)} = \text{Force (F)} \times \text{Velocity (v)}
\]

Given:
- Each engine develops a thrust of \( F = 322,000 \, \text{N} \).
- The airplane's velocity is \( v = 250 \, \text{m/s} \).

First, calculate the power in watts:
\[
P = 322,000 \, \text{N} \times 250 \, \text{m/s} = 80,500,000 \, \text{W}
\]

Next, convert power from watts to horsepower. Since \( 1 \, \text{hp} = 745.7 \, \text{W} \), the conversion is:
\[
\text{Horsepower} = \frac{80,500,000 \, \text{W}}{745.7 \, \text{W/hp}} \approx 107,970 \, \text{hp}
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 108,000 \, \text{hp} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
