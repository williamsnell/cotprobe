Okay, so I've got this economics question about the budget situation during an economic expansion. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking about how tax revenue and welfare spending change during a long period of economic expansion. The options are about whether they increase or decrease, and whether it's a surplus or a deficit. I remember that during an expansion, the economy is growing, so things like demand is high.

First, tax revenue. If the economy is expanding, people are probably spending more, so they might be earning more. More income means more tax收入. I think that's why during expansion, tax revenues go up. So tax revenue is increasing.

Now, welfare programs. During expansion, more people would need welfare to help them handle the rising expenses. So more people get welfare, which would mean more money is spent on welfare programs. So welfare spending is also increasing.

Putting it together, both tax revenue and welfare spending increase. Now, what's the budget situation like? A surplus means government spending is less than tax revenue. A deficit is when spending exceeds revenue. If both are increasing, but the increase in spending is more than the increase in revenue, it would lead to a deficit. So the budget would show a deficit.

Looking at the options, let me check them.

Option C says decreases increases deficit. No, that's not right because both are increasing.

Option B: increases decreases surplus. No, both go up, so surplus isn't the case.

Option F: increases decreases surplus. Also incorrect, same reason.

Option G: increases increases deficit. Yes, that matches what I thought.

Other options: Option E is both increase and surplus. That can't be right because spending is more than revenue.

Option H: increases decreases equilibrium. No, that's not correct.

So the correct answer should be G: increases increases deficit.

The correct answer is G: increases increases deficit.
