Okay, so I have this question here about ratios. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says Simon used 3 pears and 9 apples to make a fruit salad. The question is asking for the ratio of the number of pears to the number of apples.

First, I need to understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities. In this case, it's the number of pears to apples. So, the ratio would be the number of pears divided by the number of apples, or expressed as pears:apples.

The question gives me 3 pears and 9 apples. So, the ratio is 3:9. Hmm, but ratios can often be simplified. Let me see if both numbers can be divided by a common factor. Both 3 and 9 are divisible by 3.

Dividing 3 by 3 gives me 1, and dividing 9 by 3 gives me 3. So, the simplified ratio is 1:3. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 1:3 as an option. Let me check the options again.

The options are A:1:02, B:1:06, C:1:03, D:2:09, E:3:01, F:1:09, G:1:04, H:1:05, I:3:09, J:4:09. Hmm, none of these match 1:3. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a minute, maybe I'm interpreting the ratio incorrectly. Sometimes, the order matters. The question specifically asks for the ratio of pears to apples, which is 3:9. But wait, 3:9 simplifies to 1:3, which is the same as 3:9. Maybe the options are presented differently. Looking again, option G is 1:04, which is 1 to 4, not 1:3. Option C is 1:03, which would be 1:3, but that's not correct because 3:9 is 1:3. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the ratio as pears to apples, which is 3 pears to 9 apples, so 3:9. If I simplify this by dividing both numbers by 3, I get 1:3. But the options don't include 1:3. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read it.

The question says, "What was the ratio of the number of pears to the number of apples in the fruit salad?" So yeah, it's pears : apples.

Wait, perhaps the options are written as 1:02, which would be 1:2. No, 3 pears and 9 apples would be 1:3, which is not any of the options. So I'm confused because none of the options seem to match my initial calculation.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again. Option G is 1:04, which is 1:4. That's not correct. Option C is 1:03. That's 1:3 as well. Wait, noâ€”1:03 is 1 to 3, which is correct. But none of the options have 1:3. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: Could the question be asking for something else, like the ratio of the total fruits? No, the question specifically asks for pears to apples. So 3 pears and 9 apples gives a ratio of 1:3, which isn't in the options. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the numbers again. Simon used 3 pears and 9 apples. So 3:9. Dividing both by 3 gives me 1:3. So that's the ratio. But looking at the options, I don't see any 1:3. So perhaps the options are written differently. Let me check each option again.

Wait, option G is 1:04, which would be 1:4. No. Option C is 1:03, which is 1:3. So that's correct. But why isn't option C one of the choices? Oh wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are labeled A through J. Looking at the given options, option C is 1:03. So that's 1:3, which is correct. So the correct answer should be option C. But wait, I'm supposed to choose the answer from A-J, and the options given don't include 1:3. Wait, no, the options are as I wrote. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the ratio as apples to pears instead. Wait no, the question says pears to apples, so it's 3:9, which is 1:3. So the correct ratio is 1:3. Since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 3 pears and 9 apples. So 3:9. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3 gives 1:3. So that's correct. But none of the options have 1:3. So maybe the options are written differently. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to present it differently, like 1:03, which is 1:3.

But looking back at the options given, option G is 1:04, which is 1:4. Option C is 1:03, which is 1:3. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be option G? Wait, no, option G is 1:04, which is 1:4. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the ratio.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the ratio in the simplest terms in the format of X:Y, but the options are presented differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different method, like apple:pear, but that doesn't make sense because the question specifically says pears to apples.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm misinterpreting the ratio. Let me think. Oh wait, perhaps I should present it in a different format. Let me calculate the ratio as apples to pears. So 9 apples and 3 pears would be 9:3, which simplifies to 3:1. But that's apples to pears, which isn't what the question asks. The question is pears to apples, so it's 3:9, which is 1:3. Still, that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the ratio. Let me try that again. 3 pears and 9 apples. So the ratio is 3:9. Dividing both by 3 gives 1:3. So that's correct. But none of the options have 1:3. So I'm confused because the correct answer isn't among the options. Maybe I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the ratio in a different form. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option H is 1:05, which is 1:5, and option A is 1:02, B is 1:06, etc. Option G is 1:04, which is 1:4. Option C is 1:03, which is 1:3. So my calculation shows 1:3, which is option C. So perhaps that's the correct answer, even if it's not the first option. But I'm not sure why the options are presented that way.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the ratio 3:9, but that's 1:3, which is option C. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to present it as 3:9, which is also 1:3. Since none of the options have 1:3, perhaps I missed something. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting a different approach, like the ratio of pears to apples as 3:9, which is 1:3, which is option C. So I think the correct answer is C.
</think>

The ratio of pears to apples is 3:9, which simplifies to 1:3. Among the options, 1:3 corresponds to option C.
