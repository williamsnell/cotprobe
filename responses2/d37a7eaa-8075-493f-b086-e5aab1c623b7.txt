Okay, so I have this question about field extensions. The question is asking for the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q. The options are various numbers, and I need to choose the correct one. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the degree of a field extension is the dimension of the larger field as a vector space over the smaller field. In this case, the larger field is Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) and the smaller is Q.

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) is the same as sqrt(6), right? So we're looking at Q(sqrt(6)). So the question is really about [Q(sqrt(6)) : Q].

I think that the degree of the extension is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) over Q. What's the minimal polynomial of sqrt(6)? That's the monic polynomial of least degree with coefficients in Q that has sqrt(6) as a root.

Let me think, sqrt(6) squared is 6. So the equation is x² - 6 = 0. That's a quadratic, so the minimal polynomial is degree 2. So the degree of the extension should be 2.

Wait, but I should double-check. Could there be a higher degree? Like, could it be 4 or something else? No, because the minimal polynomial is x² -6, which is degree 2, so the extension is degree 2.

Wait, but I also recall that sometimes when you have multiple square roots, the degree can multiply, but in this case, sqrt(6) is just a single square root. So the minimal polynomial is quadratic, so the degree is 2.

Looking at the options: option I is 2, which should be the correct answer.

The field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) is equal to Q(sqrt(6)). The minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) over Q is x² - 6, which is quadratic. Thus, the degree of the extension is 2.
