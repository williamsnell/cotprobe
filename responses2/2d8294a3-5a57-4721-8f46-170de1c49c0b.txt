Okay, so I've got this question here about compound interest. Hmm, I remember it's something to do with how much money grows over time with interest. Let me think. The question says Bill deposited $1,000 for 4 years at 5% interest, compounded annually. I need to find the accumulated value.

Wait, I should recall the formula for compound interest. Oh right, the formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount, which is $1,000.
- r is the annual interest rate, which is 5% or 0.05 in decimal.
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded annually, n is 1.
- t is the time the money is invested for, which is 4 years here.

So plugging in the numbers: A = 1000*(1 + 0.05/1)^(1*4). Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.05 divided by 1 is 0.05. Adding 1 gives 1.05. Then, raising that to the power of 4. Let me calculate 1.05^4.

Wait, what's 1.05 to the 4th power? Let me compute that. 1.05^2 is 1.1025. Then, 1.1025 squared is (1.1025)^2. Let's calculate that:

1.1025 * 1.1025. Let me do the math. 1 * 1 is 1, 1 * 0.1025 is 0.1025, 0.1025 * 1 is 0.1025, and 0.1025 * 0.1025 is about 0.01050625. Adding those up:

1 + 0.1025 + 0.1025 + 0.01050625 = 1.21550625. So approximately 1.2155.

Wait, but wait, that's for 4 years. Let me make sure I'm calculating right. 1.05^1 is 1.05. ^2 is 1.1025. ^3 would be 1.1025 * 1.05. Let me compute that: 1.1025 * 1.05. 1 * 1.05 is 1.05, 0.1025 * 1.05 is 0.107625. So adding 1.05 + 0.107625 gives 1.157625. Then, ^4 would be 1.157625 * 1.05.

Hmm, 1.157625 * 1.05: Let's calculate that. 1 * 1.05 is 1.05, 0.157625 * 1.05. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1.157625 * 1.05 = 1.157625 *1 + 1.157625*0.05. So that's 1.157625 + 0.05788125 = 1.21550625. So that's 1.21550625.

So A = 1000 * 1.21550625 = 1215.50625. So approximately $1,215.51.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is $1,215.50 and option G is $1,104.08. Hmm. So which one is it? I think I should check my calculations again because sometimes when you round each step, it can affect the final result.

Wait, another way: Let's compute each step accurately. 1.05^4.

1.05^1 = 1.05
1.05^2 = 1.1025
1.05^3 = 1.1025 * 1.05 = 1.157625
1.05^4 = 1.157625 * 1.05 = 1.21550625

So for 4 years, the multiplier is 1.21550625. So 1000 * 1.21550625 = 1215.50625. So approximately $1,215.51.

Looking at the options, E is $1,215.50 and G is $1,104.08. Hmm, I must have made a mistake because the options don't include 1215.51. Wait, but looking again, option E is $1,215.50, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe I should check if the formula is correct. Wait, sometimes the formula can be expressed as (1 + r)^t or (1 + r/n)^(nt). Oh, wait, n is 1, so it's the same as (1 + r)^t. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E is 1215.50, which is exactly what I got. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Some people might use the formula as A = P(1 + r)^t, which would be 1000*(1.05)^4, which is the same as 1000*1.21550625 = 1215.50625. So 1215.51, which is option E.

But wait, looking at the options, option G is 1,104.08. That would be if the rate was 10% and compounded annually for 4 years, I think. Because 1000 *1.1^4 is 1464.10, which is higher.

Alternatively, what if someone miscalculates the exponent? Like, if someone thought 4 years is 2 years, but no, the question says 4 years.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt). So in our case, n is 1, so it's P*(1 + r)^(t). So 1000 * (1.05)^4.

Wait, let me compute 1.05^4 again.

1.05^1 = 1.05
1.05^2 = 1.1025
1.05^3 = 1.157625
1.05^4 = 1.157625 * 1.05 = 1.21550625

So 1000 * 1.21550625 = 1215.50625, which is $1,215.51.

Looking at the options, option E is $1,215.50.

So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: $1,215.50.

Step-by-step explanation:
- The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt).
- Here, P = $1,000, r = 5% = 0.05, n = 1 (annually), t = 4 years.
- Plugging in: A = 1000*(1 + 0.05)^4 = 1000*(1.21550625) = $1,215.51.
- However, option E is $1,215.50, which is the closest. Thus, the correct choice is E.

Answer: E
