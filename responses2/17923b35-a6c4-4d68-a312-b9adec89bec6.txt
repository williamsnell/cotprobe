Okay, so I have this question about the FASB and their changes. I remember that FASB stands for the Financial Accounting Standards Board. They set standards for accounting practices. Now, the question is asking about changes to the CODIC, which I think stands for Accounting100 Code of Practice or something similar. Wait, the question says they're making changes to the CODIF by issuing something.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me think. I remember that the FASB typically issues Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs). These are official documents that define new accounting principles. They might change existing rules or add new standards.

Looking at the options: A is Staff Technical Bulletins, which sounds like something more about training. B is ASUs, which I think they do. C is EITFs, which are task force releases. D is Statements of Position, which are articles of opinion, not official updates. E is Financial Accounting Series, which I'm not sure about. F is Financial Accounting Series, which I think is part of the statements.

Wait, what's the difference between ASUs and FASB re-issuing them? Oh, right, the FASB issues ASUs, which are official documents. So the question is about changes to CODIF, which I think refers to the Code of Practice. So the answer should be ASUs, which is option B. That makes sense because FASB changes CODIF by issuing new standards.

The correct answer is **B: Accounting Standards Updates**. 

FASB issues ASUs, which are official accounting standards. They make changes to the CODIF by issuing these updates, which define new accounting principles. 

**Answer: B**
