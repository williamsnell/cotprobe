Question:

A landscaper agreed to maintain the yard of a homeowner for six months for a fee of $300 per month, payable at the end of the six-month period. This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed. The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month. In a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, what is the likely result?

Options:

A: The landscaper will recover $900 for the work done before the breach.
B: The homeowner will recover $500, which is the cost of hiring a new landscaper.
C: The homeowner will recover $300, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.
D: The landscaper will recover $1,500 for the work done before the breach.
E: The landscaper will recover $1,800, considering the new job offer.
F: The homeowner will recover $1,200, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.
G: The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.
H: Neither the landscaper nor the homeowner will recover, because neither has suffered any loss.
I: The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.
J: The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a lawsuit between a landscaper and a homeowner. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think through it carefully.

Let me read the question again. The landscaper agreed to maintain the yard for six months at $300 per month. That fee was the fair market value. He did the work for four months and then switched to another job, so he didn't do the work anymore. The homeowner is suing the landscaper, and the landscaper didn't get paid because he stopped working. The question is about what the lawsuit likely results in.

Hmm, I remember something about contract law and damages. So, the main point here is whether the work he did before the breach was considered part of the contract or not. Because in contract law, there are two main types of damages: compensatory damages and compensable damages.

Wait, compensatory damages are payments that compensate the injured party for the harm they caused. So, if the homeowner didn't do the work, he wouldn't pay the landscaper. But in this case, the landscaper did some work before he breached the contract. So, does that count as compensatory?

I think the key is whether the work done before the breach was compensatory or compensable. If the contract says the work is done over six months, and the landscaper only did four, then the remaining two months' work would be compensable if the other party was entitled to it.

But wait, the question says the fee was the fair market value. So, if the contract was for six months at $300, that's $1,800 total. The landscaper did four months, which is $1,200. But he left the work for another job, so he didn't get paid. Now, the other option is if another comparable landscaper would have done the work for $300 per month, so $300 x 2 = $600. But the question says the other offers $500 per month, so $1,000 for two months. Wait, no, the other job offered $500 per month, which is more expensive. So the other month he would have been paid $500, but he left, so he doesn't get that.

Wait, but the other option is if the homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper. The question says the comparable would have done it for $300 per month, so 2 months is $600. But the other offer was $500 per month. So, the alternative was $500 per month, so for two months that's $1,000.

So, the question is, did the original contract's terms cover the two months? The contract says he was to do the job for six months, but he only did four and then switched. So, the contract is for six months, so the work should have been done over six months. But he didn't do the remaining two months' work, so those two months' work are compensable if the other party was entitled to it.

Wait, but the contract's terms are six months at $300 each. So the total is $1,800. The other offer was $500 per month for two months, which would be $1,000. So, if the other party could have been paid $1,000, then the remaining $600 (from $1,800 - $1,200 already done) isn't compensated.

But wait, the question says the other offer was for $500 per month. So, for the remaining two months, if the other option was $500 per month, then the total would be $1,000. So, the remaining $600 of the $1,800 isn't compensated; the other party would have been paid $1,000. So, the compensable amount is $600.

So, the compensatory damages would be $600. But wait, the options don't mention that. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are about who wins and how much. The options are about possible damages.

The options are:

A: The landscaper will recover $900 for the work done before the breach.

Hmm. So, $900. How would that come about? Maybe the $300 per month times 3 months, but why 3 months? Because he did four months, but then left for another job. So, 4 months plus some? Or maybe the total is $1,800, but another way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe the $900 is the $300 per month for three months. So, 3 x $300 = $900. But why three months? Because the other option was a job offer for $500 per month. Let's see: if he did 4 months at $300 each, that's $1,200. But the other option was $500 per month for 2 months, which is $1,000. So, if the other party would have been paid $1,000, then the remaining $600 isn't compensated. So, the compensatory amount is $600, not $900.

Wait, but maybe if the other option was for 2 months, the compensation would be $600, as the total is $1,800. So, the remaining $600 isn't compensated. So, the compensatory damages would be $600.

Wait, but the options don't include $600. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

A: $900

B: $500

C: $300

D: $1,500

E: $1,800

F: $1,200

G: $400

H: Neither

I: $1,200

J: $600.

Wait, J says $600, which is the cost at $300 per month for two months. Wait, no, $300 per month for two months is $600. That's the other option's payment.

Hmm. So, the other option offered $500 per month for two months, which would be $1,000. So, if the contract was for $300 per month, $1,800 total. If the other party could have been paid $1,000, then the remaining $600 isn't compensated. So, the compensatory damages would be $600. But in this case, the options don't have that. The closest is J says $600, which is the cost of completing the work at $300 per month, but that's not exactly right because it's two months.

Wait, but the question is about whether the work done before the breach (4 months) is considered compensatory.

Wait, the question is: the work he did before the breach (4 months) is considered compensatory. Or the other way around. Because the contract was for six months, but he did four, then left. So, the remaining two months are the work he did before the breach.

So, is the work he did before the breach compensated or compensable?

In contract law, if the contract is for a certain period, and the work is done for a part of it, but the other party is entitled to the remaining portion, then the work done before the breach is compensable.

So, in this case, the work was done for four months, and the other party was entitled to two more months (since the contract was for six months). So, the two months' work is compensable. So, the compensatory damages would be $600.

But looking at the options, J says the homeowner would recover $600, which is the cost of completing at $300 per month for two months. So that would be $600. So the answer would be J?

But wait, the options in the question are the possible outcomes of the lawsuit. So, in the lawsuit, the question is whether the work was compensated or not.

Wait, the options are about what the other party would recover.

Wait the question is, in the lawsuit, the options are:

A: landscaper will recover 900.

B: home pays 500.

C: home pays 300.

D: 1500.

E: 1800.

F: 1200.

G:400.

H: neither.

I: 1200.

J:600.

So, the correct answer would be J, if the compensatory damages are $600. But wait, the other option is that the other party would have been paid $1,000. So, the work done before the breach by the landscaper is $600, which is the difference between the total contract value ($1,800) and what the other party would have been paid ($1,000).

So, the compensatory damages would be $600. But the options don't have J ($600) as the answer. Wait, no, J is $600 which is the cost of doing the remaining two months at $300 per month. So, the answer would be J.

But wait, in the options, J is $600. So, that would be the amount the homeowner would recover if it's the compensable part.

But wait, the options don't have J as an answer. Wait, no, looking at the options again, option J is $600. So, according to our analysis, the compensatory damages would be $600, so the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A: $900.

B: $500.

C: $300.

D: $1500.

E: $1800.

F: $1200.

G: $400.

H: Neither.

I: $1200.

J: $600.

So, J is $600, which is the cost of the remaining two months at $300 per month. So, if the other option offered $500 per month, but the contract was $300 per month, then the other party would have been paid $1,000 for two months. So, the remaining $600 isn't compensated, which is the compensatory part.

So, the correct compensatory damages would be $600. That's the amount the homeowner would recover.

So, the correct answer would be J, which says the homeowner would recover $600.

Wait, but the options also include H: neither. So, if the work was neither compensated nor compensated, but the contract was for six months at $300, then the correct answer would be H.

Wait, no, the contract was for six months at $300, so the total is $1,800. The home did four months, which is $1,200. But if the other option was $500 per month for two months ($1,000), then the remaining $600 isn't compensated. So, the home would recover $600.

But wait, the question is whether the work done before the breach (the four months) is considered compensated or not. If the other party was entitled to the remaining two months, then the four months are compensated.

So, the four months' work is considered compensatory because the other party was entitled to the remaining two months (since the contract was six months). So, the work done before the breach (the four months) is compensated, and the two months are compensable.

So, the compensatory damages would be $600, as calculated.

So the correct answer is option J: $600.

Wait, but the options don't have J as an answer. Wait, no, looking back, yes, option J says the homeowner would recover $600. So the correct answer is J.

The question revolves around a contract law scenario where a landscaper agreed to maintain a homeowner's yard for six months at a fee of $300 per month, totaling $1,800. The landscaper performed the work for four months, receiving $300 per month, for a total of $1,200. However, the landscaper then switched to another job and took on the other contractor, leaving the work unfinished. The homeowner, now suing the landscaper, hopes to recover damages for the work done before the breach.

Key points to consider:

1. **Contract Terms**: The contract was for six months, but the work was only completed for four months. The remaining two months' work was considered compensable if the other party was entitled to it.

2. **Compensatory Damages**: The compensation should be based on the difference between the total contract value ($1,800) and the amount the other party would have been paid for the remaining two months. If the other contractor offered $500 per month for two months, the total would be $1,000. Thus, the compensable damages are $600 (the remaining $600 of the $1,800 contract).

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A ($900)**: Incorrect. This does not align with the calculation of compensable damages.
   - **Option B ($500)**: Incorrect. This represents the amount the other contractor offered for the remaining two months, not the compensable amount.
   - **Option C ($300)**: Incorrect. This is too low and does not reflect the difference in payments.
   - **Option D ($1,500)**: Incorrect. This is the total contract value, not the compensable amount.
   - **Option E ($1,800)**: Incorrect. This is the total contract value, not the compensable amount.
   - **Option F ($1,200)**: Incorrect. This is the amount paid for four months, not the compensable amount.
   - **Option G ($400)**: Incorrect. This is too low and does not reflect the difference in payments.
   - **Option H (Neither)**: Incorrect. The work was compensated, so neither is correct.
   - **Option I ($1,200)**: Incorrect. This is the amount paid for four months, not the compensable amount.
   - **Option J ($600)**: Correct. This is the compensable amount for the remaining two months, calculated as $1,800 - $1,200.

The correct answer is **J: The homeowner will recover $600, which constitutes the compensable damages for the work done before the breach**.
