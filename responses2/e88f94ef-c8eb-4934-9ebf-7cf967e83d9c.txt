Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about regression analysis. The question is asking which response is plausible when there's a finding of residual non-normality. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I need to understand what residual non-normality means. I remember that in regression models, the error terms (residuals) should ideally be normally distributed, especially for small sample sizes. If they're not, that can affect the validity of the statistical tests and confidence intervals.

The question is about what to do when this non-normality is found. So, I'll think about possible solutions. 

Option A: Use a logarithmic functional form. I think this makes the relationship between variables more linear. Taking logs can help when the relationship is multiplicative, making the model better fit. That's a possible solution because it adjusts the model structure to account for non-normality.

Option B: Add lags of the variables on the right. I'm not too sure about this. Adding lags might help with autocorrelation, but I don't think it directly addresses non-normality of residuals. It's more of a way to correct for other issues like autocorrelation in time series data.

Option C: Estimate in first differenced form. First differencing is used when variables are non-stationary or when there's a trend. It can change the dynamics of the model but doesn't directly fix the distribution of the residuals. It might help with issues like autocorrelation but not necessarily non-normality.

Option D: Remove outliers. Outliers can skew the residuals. Removing them might help with normality, but it's more of an ad-hoc solution. Also, removing outliers can affect the model's fit and other assumptions. Plus, this isn't always feasible if there are many outliers or if removing them changes the underlying data structure.

So the plausible response would be A. Using a logarithmic form would adjust the model to better fit the data, possibly making the residuals more normal. Alternatively, sometimes people transform variables (like log) to correct for non-normality in residuals, especially in larger samples. But if the sample is small, non-normality might require a different approach.

Wait, another thought: When dealing with residual non-normality, one of the best solutions is to apply transformations to the variables. Logarithmic, square root, or reciprocal transformations can help. So option A is correct because it's a functional form adjustment.

I think the other options don't address residual non-normality. So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: Use a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one. This adjustment helps address residual non-normality by transforming the relationship between variables, making the model better fit the data.

Answer: A
