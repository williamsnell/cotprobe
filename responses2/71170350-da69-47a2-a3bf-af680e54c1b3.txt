Okay, so I have this question about the frustration-aggression hypothesis, and I need to remember what I learned in my psychology class. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about what Berkowitz (1971) revised the original hypothesis. The original was that frustration leads to aggression. But Berkowitz changed that. I think he proposed that frustration leads to aggression more specifically. 

The options are A to J, each describing a condition under which this leads to aggression. I remember that the original hypothesis had conditions related to the status of the target and the state of the aggressor. So, the revised version probably adds more specific conditions.

Let me think about the original hypothesis. The original was that when someone is frustrated, they also feel aggressive. But Berkowitz's version might have a more precise condition. I think he found that when the target of the aggression is of lower status than the aggressor, this leads to aggression. So the target is less important than the aggressor's status.

Looking at the options, option A says the target is of lower status than the aggressor. That fits. What about the other options?

Option B is about the aggressor experiencing high stress. Maybe that's part of it, but I'm not sure if it's a sufficient condition. I think the revised hypothesis adds the target condition.

Option C: aggressive cues in the environment. That might be another condition, but I think the revised hypothesis is more about the relationship between the person's state and the target's status.

Option D: acting aggressively leads to desirable outcomes. No, that's the opposite. The hypothesis was that aggression is the result of frustration, not the cause.

Option E: target has signs of weakness. That's similar to A. So A and E are both about target weakness but in different terms. Wait, the original hypothesis might have been that when the target is weak, aggression occurs. So the revised version might have added that the target is of lower status.

Option F: aggressor feels threatened or endangered. That's about the person feeling threatened, which could be a condition. But I'm not sure if the revised hypothesis specifically mentions the target's status.

Option G: aggression can be blamed on external factors. That's about thinking it's internal, which might be a factor, but not the condition of the target.

Option H: previously rewarded for aggression. That's about history, maybe, not a condition.

Option I: lack of social support. That's about the environment, perhaps, but I'm not certain.

Option J: the aggressor has internal control. That's about the person's ability, which might not be the condition.

So the revised hypothesis by Berkowitz must be that when the target is of lower status, then aggression occurs. So option A says the target is of lower status than the aggressor. That should be the correct answer.

The correct answer is A: the target of the aggression is of lower status than the aggressor.

**Answer: A**
