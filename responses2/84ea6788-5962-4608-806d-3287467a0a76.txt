Question:

On February 1, a woman conveys her farm to a man, and the man duly records the conveyance. The following day, the man conveys the property to his sister; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the man executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a friend. The friend gives the man a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the sister. The sister, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to a farmer, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the farmer purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the sister and duly records the deed. If the property in question was located in a state having a notice-type statute, which of the following parties would ultimately prevail?

Options:

A: The man and the farmer.
B: The sister and the friend.
C: The friend.
D: The man.
E: None of the above.
F: The woman.
G: The sister.
H: Both the man and the friend.
I: The farmer.
J: Both the sister and the farmer.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a woman conveying her farm to a man, who records the deed. Then the man conveys to his sister, who doesn't record. The next day, the man conveys to a friend. The friend gives a check and records. Then the friend sells the farm to a farmer, who buys without knowing about the sister's deed and records the deed. The question is about which parties would prevail if the state has a notice-type statute.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the notice statute. I remember that in some states, if someone records a deed before another party, the first party can be excused from recording. So it's a notice statute. But wait, the question says the property is in a state with a notice-type statute. So the state law allows the first party to omit recording if the person records before them.

In this case, the woman conveyed to the man, who records. Then the man conveys to his sister, who doesn't record. Then the man conveys to the friend, who records. Then the friend sells to the farmer without knowing about the sister's deed, and the farmer records.

So in the state with a notice statute, the woman (the first to record) can be excused from recording. Because when she records, the next transaction (to sister) isn't recorded. So the woman can be excused, but the friend (who records on Feb 4) is still excused because she (the friend) records after the first deed, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the friend records on Feb 4, and the farmer records on Feb 5. So the friend records after the first deed, but when the friend conveys, the state statute says that the first to record can be excused if the next party doesn't record before the first.

Wait, the friend is the one who records, but the state statute allows the first party (the woman) to be excused. Because the property was transferred in order: woman -> man (recorded) -> sister (didn't record), then man -> friend (recorded), then friend -> farmer (recorded). So the first to record is the woman, so she can be excused. But the friend is the one who records, but the state statute allows the first to be excused regardless of when the next person records. Or wait, maybe it's that if someone records before the other, the first can be excused.

Wait, the notice statute may apply to the first recording. So in this case, the first recording is by the woman. The man records next, but the sister doesn't. So the woman is excused from recording. The friend records, but the state statute might allow him to be excused only if the first deed was recorded before him. Because the first deed is the woman, so the friend's recording is after the first deed, so he can't be excused. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The state statute allows a party to be excused from recording if they record before the other. So the first to record is the woman, who records on Feb 1. The next is the man on Feb 2, who records. Then the friend records on Feb 4. So the man records after the first deed, so he can't be excused because the state only allows excused if the first records before the next. Wait, but the friend records after the first deed, so the state statute wouldn't apply to him. So the friend can't be excused.

Wait, maybe the friend records after the first deed. So the woman can't be excused because she recorded before the friend. Wait, no, the state statute allows the first to be excused if they record before the next. So the first is the woman, she records on Feb 1. Then the man records on Feb 2. So the man is not excused, because the first to record is the woman, so the man's deed isn't excused because he didn't record before the first. So the woman can't be excused because she records first. Wait, no. The state statute allows the first party to be excused if the next party doesn't record before them. So the first to record is the woman. So the next party (the man) would not have to record before the woman if the state statute applies. That's not right. Because the state statute says that if the first party records, the next can't record to be excused. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backwards.

Alternatively, the state statute might allow the first to record to be excused if the next doesn't record before them. So, in this case, the first to record is the woman. Then the next (the man) records. But the state statute says that the first can be excused if the next doesn't record until later. So the woman can be excused, because she records, and the next (the man) records on Feb 2. So the state statute doesn't prevent the woman from being excused because she recorded before the next. Wait, no. Let me think again. The statute allows the first party to be excused if the next doesn't record before them. So if the first party records, the next can't record to be excused. So, the first to record is the woman. The next (the man) records on Feb 2. So the state statute doesn't prevent the woman from being excused because she's the first to record, and the next (the man) doesn't record before her. So she can be excused. Then, the friend records on Feb 4, but the state statute doesn't apply because the first to record was the woman. So the friend can't be excused, because the state statute only allows the first to be excused if they record before the next.

Wait, but the friend records after the first deed (the woman), so the state statute doesn't allow him to be excused. So the friend can't be excused, but the farmer records after the friend's deed. So when the friend conveys, the state statute would allow the first to record (the woman) to be excused, because she recorded before the next (the man). So the friend is allowed to record without excusing himself.

Wait, but the friend is the one who records, but the state statute only allows the woman to be excused. So the friend could not be excused, but the farmer records without excusing the friend.

Wait, let me outline each step.

1. Woman conveys to man on Feb 1, records deed (recorded).
2. Man conveys to sister on Feb 2, doesn't record.
3. Man conveys to friend on Feb 4, records deed.
4. Friend conveys to farmer on Feb 5, who records without knowing about the sister's deed.

Now, the state statute is a notice-type. So when someone records, if the next person doesn't record before them, the first can be excused.

So when the woman records, the first to record. The next is the man on Feb 2, who records. So the state statute doesn't allow the man to be excused because he recorded after the first. So the man records normally.

Then the next is the friend on Feb 4. The state statute allows the woman to be excused if she records before the friend. Since she records on Feb 1, the friend records on Feb 4, which is after. So the woman can be excused. So the man, who records on Feb 2, cannot be excused because he recorded before the first deed.

Wait, no. The state statute allows the first to be excused if they record before the next. So the first to record is the woman. The next is the man (Feb 2). So the state statute doesn't allow the man to be excused because the first to record (woman) recorded before the next (man). So the man records normally.

Then the friend records on Feb 4, which is after the woman (so state statute doesn't allow the friend to be excused because the first to record was the woman). The farmer records on Feb 5, after the friend. So no excused recording, and thus all parties record normally.

Wait, but the question says that the friend records on Feb 4, and then the farmer buys without knowing about the sister's deed and records. So in the state with a notice statute, the woman can be excused from recording because she records first. So the friend records after the woman. So he doesn't get excused. So the friend records normally, and the farmer records normally.

Wait, but what about the farmer? The farmer records on Feb 5, which is after the friend's recording on Feb 4. So no excused recording for the farmer. So the farmer can record normally.

So who has the right to record?

First, the woman on Feb 1, records. Then the man on Feb 2, records. The friend on Feb 4, records. The farmer on Feb 5, records.

So all four parties record normally. Thus, the question is about the legal status after the initial conveyances.

Wait, but the friend records on Feb 4, as the state statute allows him to be excused only if the first to record was before him. Since the woman is the first, he can't be excused. So he must record as per the statute, meaning that he can record without excusing himself because the state statute allows him to be excused only if the first to record was before him. But since he's after the woman, he can't be excused. So he must record normally, as he did. So the friend records, as he did.

The farmer records normally, as he did. So all four parties record as they should.

Wait, but the question is about the outcome of the case. So the woman's deed is recorded, the friend's deed is recorded, and the farmer's deed is recorded. So, in a state with a notice statute, the first party to record is excused, but in this case, the first to record is the woman, and the friend records after her. So, for the state, the only thing that matters is whether the next party records before them. So the first to record is the woman. The next (the man) records on Feb 2, which is before her. So the state statute doesn't allow the man to be excused because he recorded before her. So the man records as usual.

Wait, no. The state statute allows the first party to be excused if they record before the next. So the first to record is the woman. The next is the man on Feb 2. So the man recorded before the first, meaning that the state statute doesn't allow the man to be excused. So the man records normally, which he did.

Then, the friend records on Feb 4, which is after the first. So the state statute doesn't allow the friend to be excused because the first (woman) recorded before him. So he records normally.

The farmer's deed is recorded on Feb 5, which is after the friend's. So no excused recording for the farmer. So all parties record normally.

Wait, but the friend and the farmer both record without excusing. So the friend's deed is recorded, and the farmer's is recorded.

Wait, but the friend's deed is recorded on Feb 4, and then the farmer records on Feb 5. So the state statute doesn't affect the farmer's recording because the friend recorded after the first deed.

Wait, but the question is about the outcome of the case. So the first party to record is the woman, who records on Feb 1. Then the friend records on Feb 4. The farmer records on Feb 5.

Wait, the question is about whether the person sells the property without knowledge and whether that affects the recording. So in this case, the friend sells the property to the farmer on Feb 5, without knowing about the sister's deed. So the friend records the deed as he did. But the state statute allows the first to record (woman) to be excused, but the friend records after her. So when the friend sells, he records normally.

Wait, but the question is about what would be the outcome. So the four parties: woman, friend, farmer. Since all record normally, the woman's deed is recorded, the friend's deed is recorded, and the farmer's is recorded. So all four record, so the outcome is that all parties have valid deeds.

So the possible outcomes would be that the friend and the farmer have valid deeds, and the woman's deed is recorded. Wait, but the question is about which parties prevail. The options are various combinations.

Wait, the question is about the property in question being in a state with a notice-type statute. So the state law allows the first party to record to be excused if they record before the next.

So, the first to record is the woman. The next is the man, who records on Feb 2. So the state statute allows the first (woman) to be excused if she records before the next. But here, she does record before the next. So the man doesn't get excused. The friend records on Feb 4, which is after the first. So the state statute doesn't allow the friend to be excused. Similarly, the farmer records on Feb 5, which is after the friend. So no excused recording. So in this case, all four parties record normally.

In a state with a notice statute, the first party to record (woman) is excused from recording if the next party doesn't record before them. Wait, no. The statute says if someone records before the next, the first can be excused. So the first to record (woman) records on Feb 1, the next (the man) records on Feb 2. So the man's deed is not recorded because the first to record was the woman. So the man can't be excused.

Wait, no. The state statute allows the first party (woman) to be excused if the next (man) doesn't record before her. So she records, and the next doesn't record before her. So the first can be excused. So the man records only on Feb 2, which is after the woman. So the state statute doesn't allow the man to be excused. So the man records normally, as he did.

Then the friend records on Feb 4, which is after the first. So the state statute doesn't allow the friend to be excused. So he records normally.

Then the farmer records on Feb 5, which is after the friend. So no excused recording for him. So, all four parties record as they should.

So the question is about which parties would prevail. So, in this scenario, all four parties record normally.

Wait, but the friend is the one who records without excusing himself. So he records as he did. So the farmer's deed is recorded, and the friend's is recorded. The woman's is recorded, so all four record.

But the question is about the one who has the deed recorded, and whether the friend's deed is recorded. Because the friend gave a purchase price without the actual transfer.

So the friend's deed is recorded, so he's allowed to record, even though he didn't know about the sister's deed.

So, in the state with a notice statute, the first party to record is excused, so the woman can be excused. Then, the friend records after the woman. So the friend's deed is recorded, as the state allows. So, the friend has a valid deed, and the farmer has a valid deed.

So in this case, the outcome would be that the woman's deed is recorded (so she's excused), and the friend and farmer have valid deeds. So the parties that have valid deeds are the friend and the farmer, as well as the woman, but the state excused her.

Wait, but the options are:

A: The man and the farmer.

B: The sister and the friend.

C: The friend.

D: The man.

E: None of the above.

Hmm. Let me think again. The state statute is notice-type, so when the first (woman) records, the next (the man) doesn't record, but the first is excused.

So the friend records normally after the first. The farmer records after the friend.

So all four parties record normally, so all have valid deeds. But the options don't include that.

Wait, the question is about who would prevail. The problem is that the friend gives a purchase price without knowing about the sister's deed, but the farmer records. So in a state with a notice statute, the friend's deed is recorded, even though he didn't know about the sister's.

So in this scenario, the friend has a valid deed, the farmer has a valid deed. So who would prevail? The options are:

A: man and farmer. So both have recorded.

B: sister and friend. Sister's is excused, so she didn't record. Friend's is recorded.

Wait, the sister didn't record, so she wouldn't prevail. So the friend and farmer are the ones who have valid deeds.

So the possible answer would be option C: The friend, because he and the farmer have recorded.

Wait, but the question is about which parties would ultimately prevail. The options are about which parties have rights to the property.

Wait, the question is phrased: "which of the following parties would ultimately prevail?" So it's about who has the right to the property.

So in a state with a notice statute, the first to record is the woman, so she's excused. But the friend records after that, so he can't be excused. The farmer records after the friend, so no excused recording. So the friend and the farmer have valid deeds. The sister's deed was recorded on Feb 6, but she didn't record on Feb 1. So she wouldn't have a right. So the friend and the farmer have valid deeds.

So in this case, who are the parties that have the valid deed?

The friend and the farmer. So the answer would be option C: The friend.

Wait, but the question is about the property in question. The question states that the state has a notice-type statute, which affects the recording of the deed. The question is about whether the friend and the farmer's deeds are recorded, and thus the outcome.

So in the scenario, the friend's deed is recorded (Feb 4), and the farmer's deed is recorded as well (Feb 5). The woman's deed was recorded (Feb 1), but she was excused due to the first deed (so she didn't have to record, but she was allowed to be excused). So the friend is allowed to record, and the farmer is allowed to record. So the friend's deed is recorded, and the farmer's is recorded.

So, the friend and the farmer have valid deeds. So the answer is option C: The friend.

Wait, but the question is a bit more involved. Because in a notice statute, the first party to record can be excused. So the woman records on Feb 1, and the next (the man) records on Feb 2. So the first (woman) is excused, so she doesn't have to record. The friend records on Feb 4, which is after the first. So the friend is allowed to record, as the state statute doesn't prevent it. So in this scenario, the friend's deed is recorded, and the farmer's is recorded. So the friend and the farmer have valid deeds.

Wait, but the question is about what would ultimately prevail, so the options are about which parties are the ones who have the right to the property.

So, the answer is option C: The friend, because he has a valid deed and the farmer has a valid deed.

Wait, but the question is about the property in the state with a notice-type statute. So the state law would allow the first party to record to be excused. So the woman records on Feb 1, the next (the man) records on Feb 2. So the state statute doesn't allow the man to be excused because he records before the first. So the man records as usual. Then the friend records on Feb 4, which is after the first. So the state statute doesn't allow the friend to be excused, so he records normally. Then the farmer records on Feb 5, which is after the friend, so no excused recording, so he records. So the four parties all record normally. So the friend and the farmer have valid deeds.

Thus, the answer is C: The friend.

Wait, but the question is about which parties have the right to the property. The friend has a valid deed, the farmer has a valid deed. So the question is, which parties have the right to the property. So the answer is that the friend and the farmer have valid deeds, so the answer is C: The friend.

Wait, no. Because the question is about which parties would ultimately prevail. The options are about the possible outcomes. So the friend and the farmer have valid deeds, so the answer would be C: The friend.

Wait, but the question is about the state with a notice-type statute. So the first party (woman) is excused, but the friend records after that. So the friend's deed is recorded, and the farmer's is recorded. So the friend is allowed to record, and the farmer is allowed to record. So the answer is C: The friend.

Wait, but the friend and the farmer both have valid deeds, so the answer would be C: The friend.

Wait, but the question is about which parties have the right to the property. The friend has a valid deed, and the farmer has a valid deed. So the question is, which parties have the right? The answer is that the friend and the farmer have valid deeds, so the correct option is C: The friend.

But wait, in the scenario, the friend and the farmer both have valid deeds, so the correct option is C: The friend.

But wait, the answer options are:

A: The man and the farmer.

B: The sister and the friend.

C: The friend.

D: The man.

E: None of the above.

So according to our analysis, the correct answer is C: The friend. Because the friend has a valid deed, and the farmer has a valid deed. So the friend and the farmer are the ones who have the right.

Wait, but the question is about which parties would ultimately prevail. So in this case, the friend and the farmer have valid deeds. So the correct option is C: The friend.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In a state with a notice-type statute, the first party to record is excused if the next party doesn't record before them. So the first party to record (woman) records on Feb 1, and the next party (man) records on Feb 2, which is before the woman. So the state statute doesn't allow the man to be excused because he recorded before the first. So the man records normally.

Then, the friend records on Feb 4, which is after the woman. So the state statute doesn't allow the friend to be excused because the first to record was the woman, who recorded before them. So the friend records normally.

Then, the farmer records on Feb 5, which is after the friend. So the state statute doesn't allow the farmer to be excused, so the farmer records normally.

So all parties record normally. So the friend and the farmer have valid deeds. So the correct answer is C: The friend.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the friend's deed. The friend's deed is recorded on Feb 4, which is after the woman. So in a state with a notice statute, the friend's deed is recorded, which allows them to record. But the question is about whether the friend's deed is recorded. So in this scenario, the friend's deed is recorded. So the answer is C: The friend.

Wait, but the question is about the property in the state with a notice statute. So the first to record (woman) is allowed to record, but the friend's deed is recorded, and the farmer's is recorded.

So the question is about the parties that have the right to the property. The friend and the farmer have the right. So the correct answer would be C: The friend.

But I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Let's think of it in the context of the options.

The options are:

A: The man and the farmer.

B: The sister and the friend.

C: The friend.

D: The man.

E: None of the above.

In our analysis, the friend and the farmer have valid deeds. So the correct answer is C: The friend.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which parties would ultimately prevail. So the friend has a valid deed, and the farmer has a valid deed. So the answer is C: The friend.

Wait, no. Because the question is about the property in the state with a notice-type statute. So when the first party to record (woman) records, the next (man) doesn't record before her. So the man records normally. Then the friend records on Feb 4, which is after the woman. So the state statute doesn't allow the friend to be excused, so he records normally. Similarly, the farmer records normally.

So the friend and the farmer have valid deeds. So the correct answer is C: The friend.

Wait, but the question is about the property in the state with a notice-type statute. So in this scenario, the property is recorded on Feb 1 (woman), Feb 4 (friend), Feb 5 (farmer). So the property is recorded, so the property is valid, and the grantee (the property owner) has a valid deed.

So the question is about the parties that have the right to the property. So the friend has a valid deed, the farmer has a valid deed, the woman has a valid deed (since she was excused), the sister has an excused deed (so she didn't record), and the man is excused (so he didn't record), the friend records normally, the farmer records normally.

So the friend and the farmer have valid deeds. So the correct answer is C: The friend.

Wait, but in the options, C is "The friend." So that's correct.

Wait, but let me re-examine the options. The options are:

A: The man and the farmer.

B: The sister and the friend.

C: The friend.

D: The man.

E: None of the above.

So according to our analysis, the correct answer is C: The friend.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In a state with a notice statute, the first party to record is excused. So the woman records on Feb 1, and the next (the man) doesn't record before her. So the man is allowed to record normally. Then the friend records on Feb 4, which is after her. So the state statute doesn't allow the friend to be excused, so he records normally. The farmer records on Feb 5, which is after the friend, so no excused recording. So the farmer records normally.

Thus, the friend and the farmer have valid deeds. So the correct answer is C: The friend.

So the answer is C: The friend.
</think>

In a state with a notice statute, the first party to record is allowed to be excused, while subsequent parties are not. The woman conveys her interest to the property owner on February 1. The man records on February 2, which is before the woman, so the state statute does not allow the man to be excused. The friend records on February 4, after the woman, and the farmer records on February 5, after the friend. 

As a result, the friend and the farmer have valid deeds, while the woman was excused but did not record. The state statute does not affect the validity of the friend and the farmer's deeds. Therefore, the correct answer is **C: The friend**.
