Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem, but I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the question is: The work done on a 100-kg crate that is hoisted 2 m in a time of 4 s. We have multiple-choice options, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. Work done, right. I remember that work is calculated using the formula W = force × distance. But wait, sometimes it's easier to think in terms of energy. Oh right, the work done against gravity is equal to the change in gravitational potential energy. Because when you lift something, you're doing work to increase its potential energy.

Wait, gravitational potential energy is given by U = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height. So if the crate is hoisted 2 meters, h is 2 m. The mass is 100 kg.

So let me plug in the numbers. m = 100 kg, g is approximately 9.8 m/s², h = 2 m. So U = 100 * 9.8 * 2. Let me calculate that. 100 * 2 is 200, then 200 * 9.8 is 1960 J. So the potential energy increases by 1960 J. That's the work done against gravity, which is the same as the work done on the crate by the hoisting force.

Looking at the options: option A is 200 J, which is way too small. B is 3000, which is higher. C is 400, D is 1000, E is 2400, F is 800, G is 2000, H is 500, I is 1600, J is 1200.

Wait, 1960 is close to 2000. So the closest option is G, which is 2000 J. So the answer should be G.

Wait but I should make sure. Oh, another way to think: the work done is the force times the displacement. The force here is the weight of the crate, which is m*g. So F = 100*9.8 = 980 N. Work done is F*d, so 980 * 2 = 1960 J, which is about 2000 J. So definitely, the correct answer is G.

To determine the work done on a 100-kg crate hoisted 2 m in 4 s, we use the concept of gravitational potential energy. The work done is equal to the change in potential energy, which is calculated as:

\[
U = mgh
\]

where:
- \( m = 100 \, \text{kg} \),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \),
- \( h = 2 \, \text{m} \).

Plugging in the values:

\[
U = 100 \times 9.8 \times 2 = 1960 \, \text{J}.
\]

The closest option to 1960 J is 2000 J. Therefore, the correct answer is:
