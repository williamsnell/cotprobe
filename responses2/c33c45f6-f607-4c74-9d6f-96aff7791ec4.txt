Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about pH and hydrogen ion concentration. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question has two parts. Part A asks me to find the pH when the hydrogen ion concentration is 3.5 × 10^-4. Part B is the reverse: given a pH of 4.25, I need to find the hydrogen concentration. The options are labeled A to I, each providing a pH and a concentration. I need to match each part's answers with the correct options.

Wait, I remember that pH and hydrogen ion concentration are related by the formula pH = -log[H+]. So for part A, I'll plug in 3.5e-4 into this formula. Let me calculate that.

So, pH A = -log(3.5 × 10^-4). Hmm, I think I can split this into two parts: log(3.5) and log(1e-4). Log(1e-4) is -4, so it's -log(3.5) -4.

What's log(3.5)? I think log(3) is about 0.477, and log(4) is about 0.602. So log(3.5) should be between them. Let's compute it more accurately. Wait, maybe I should just approximate. Alternatively, I can think that log(3.5) is approximately 0.544. Let me check: 10^0.544 is about 3.5. So if log(3.5) is 0.544, then pH A is -0.544 -4 = -4.544. But pH can't be negative, so I must have gotten something wrong. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3.5e-4 is 0.00035 M. So log(0.00035) is log(3.5 × 1e-4) = log(3.5) + log(1e-4) = 0.544 + (-4) = -3.456. Then, pH is -log(3.5e-4) which is 3.456. So I should get approximately 3.46. So part A's answer is 3.46.

Looking at the options, the first part of each option is the answer to part A. So for part A, the correct pH is 3.46, which would be option I or H, but let me check. Wait, looking at the options, each option has A and B. I think option I's A is 3.46. Let me check the other options.

Wait, the options are A to I, each for A and B. So the first part of the question is part A, which is about pH, and the second part is part B, which is about finding [H+] given pH.

So for part B, the given pH is 4.25. So I need to find [H+] = 10^-pH. So 10^-4.25.

Hmm, 10^-4 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001. 10^-0.25 is about 0.599 (since 10^0.25 is about 1.78, so reciprocal is about 0.562). So 10^-4.25 is 0.562e-4, which is 5.62e-5. So approximately 5.6 × 10^-5. So part B's answer would be 5.6e-5.

Looking at the options, which option has part B as 5.6e-5? Let's see: option B is part B as 6.9e-5, option F is 4.4e-5, option B is 6.9. Wait, none of them seem to have 5.6e-5. Did I make a mistake? Or did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10^-4.25 more accurately. Let me think: 4.25 is 4 and 0.25. 10^0.25 is the fourth root of 10. I remember that the fourth root of 10 is approximately 1.778. So 10^-4.25 = 1e-4 * (1e-0.25) = 1e-4 * 0.5623 (since 1/1.778 is approx 0.5623). So 0.5623e-4 is 5.623e-5. So approximately 5.6e-5.

Looking at the options, the B part of the answer I'm looking for is 5.6e-5. Let me check all the options:

Option B: B)6.9e-5
Option F: B)4.4e-5
Option H: B)4.6e-5
Option I: B)6.6e-5
Option G: B)3.5e-5
Option C: B)7.6e-5
Option D: B)5.1e-5
Option E: B)5.0e-5
Option A: B)5.6e-5

Wait, option E's B is 5.0e-5. Hmm, none of them exactly give 5.6e-5. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, let me recheck. Wait, 10^-4.25 is 10^-(4 + 0.25) = 10^-4 * 10^-0.25. 10^-0.25 is approximately 0.5623, so 5.623e-5. The closest option is option E, which has B)5.0e-5, but that's 5.0e-5, which is 0.00005. But our calculation gives around 0.00005623. So option A is 5.6e-5, which is 0.000056, which is very close.

Wait, let me look at the options again. I see option E: B)5.0e-5. No, that's 5.0e-5, which is 0.00005. That's lower than our value. Option A is 5.6e-5, which is 0.000056. So that's closer to our calculated 5.6e-5.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when calculating the pH. Let me double-check. Part A: 3.5e-4.

pH = -log(3.5e-4). 

Alternatively, since pH = 4 - log(3.5). Because 3.5e-4 is 3.5 × 1e-4, so log(3.5e-4) = log(3.5) + log(1e-4) = 0.544 + (-4) = -3.456. So pH is -(-3.456) = 3.456, approximately 3.46. So option I's A is 3.46, which is correct. So I's A is correct.

Now for part B, given pH 4.25, the [H+] is 10^-4.25, which is 5.623e-5. So the closest option is option A, which has B as 5.6e-5. So the correct matching is part A in option I and part B in option A.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is option I: A) 3.46, B) 5.6e-5.

Wait, but looking again at the options, each option is a pair of A and B. So the correct option is I: A)3.46, B)5.6e-5. So that's option I. So the correct answer is option I.

To determine the pH and [H+] concentration for the given scenarios, we use the relationship between pH and hydrogen ion concentration: 

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]
\]

### Part A: pH of a solution with \( [H^+] = 3.5 \times 10^{-4} \)
1. Calculate \(\log(3.5 \times 10^{-4})\):
   - \(\log(3.5) \approx 0.544\)
   - \(\log(10^{-4}) = -4\)
   - \(\log(3.5 \times 10^{-4}) = 0.544 - 4 = -3.456\)
2. The pH is the negative of this value:
   - \(\text{pH} = -(-3.456) = 3.456 \approx 3.46\)

Thus, the correct pH for Part A is **3.46**.

### Part B: [H+] concentration for a solution with pH = 4.25
1. Use the formula \([H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\):
   - \([H^+] = 10^{-4.25}\)
2. Calculate \(10^{-4.25}\):
   - \(10^{-4} = 0.0001\)
   - \(10^{-0.25} \approx 0.5623\)
   - \([H^+] = 0.5623 \times 0.0001 = 5.623 \times 10^{-5}\)

Thus, the correct [H+] concentration for Part B is approximately **5.6 \times 10^{-5}**.

### Matching the options
- **Part A** corresponds to **3.46**, which matches **Option I** (A: 3.46).
- **Part B** corresponds to **5.6 \times 10^{-5}**, which matches **Option A** (B: 5.6 \times 10^{-5}).

Therefore, the correct answer is **Option I**.
