Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question says: There's a solid plastic cube with a uniform density, side length 0.5 meters, and a mass of 100 kg. It's placed in a vat of fluid whose density is 1200 kg/m³. The question is asking what fraction of the cube's volume floats above the surface of the fluid. The options are A to J, each with different fractions.

Hmm, I remember that when an object is submerged in a fluid, it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own weight. This is based on Archimedes' principle. So the key here is to find the fraction of the cube that's submerged.

First, I need to find the cube's density. Because the cube's density is mass over volume. The mass is given as 100 kg. The side length is 0.5 m, so volume is side cubed. Let me calculate that.

Volume of cube = (0.5 m)^3. 0.5 cubed is 0.125 m³. So the volume is 0.125 m³.

Density of the cube (ρ_cube) = mass / volume = 100 kg / 0.125 m³. Let me compute that: 100 divided by 0.125 is 800 kg/m³. So the cube's density is 800 kg/m³.

Wait, the fluid's density is 1200 kg/m³. Since the fluid has a higher density, the cube will float, and part of it will be submerged.

The fraction submerged can be found by the ratio of the cube's density to the fluid's density. Because when an object floats, the fraction submerged is the same as the ratio of their densities. So fraction submerged (f) = ρ_cube / ρ_fluid.

Plugging in the numbers: 800 / 1200 = 2/3. So 2/3 of the cube is submerged. That means 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 is floating above the surface.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. If the cube is less dense than the fluid, it will float, and the submerged volume is such that the weight of displaced fluid equals the cube's weight.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of mass. The cube's mass is 100 kg. The fluid's density is 1200 kg/m³. The cube's volume is 0.125 m³. So the mass of the displaced fluid must be equal to the cube's mass for equilibrium.

So, m_fluid_displaced = mass_cube = 100 kg. The volume displaced (V) is m_fluid_displaced / density_fluid = 100 kg / 1200 kg/m³ = 0.0833333 m³.

Since the cube's total volume is 0.125 m³, the floating part is V_floating = 0.0833333 m³. So the fraction above is 0.125 - 0.0833333 = 0.0416666, which is 1/24? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.0416666 is 1/24 of the total volume? No, wait no. Let me calculate it properly.

Wait 0.0833333 is 1/12 of the cube's volume. Because 1/12 is approximately 0.0833333. So 1/12 of the cube's volume is submerged. Therefore, the fraction above is 1 - (1/12) = 11/12. Wait, that can't be right because that's higher than 1/2. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1/3.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me check.

Wait, no. Because 800 kg/m³ is the cube's density. The fluid's is 1200 kg/m³. So the fraction submerged is cube's density / fluid's density = 800/1200 = 2/3. So 2/3 of the cube is under water, 1/3 above. That would mean the volume above is (1/3) * 0.125 m³ = 0.0416667 m³. The fraction is 0.0416667 / 0.125 = 0.33333, which is 1/3. So that's 1/3 of the cube's volume above.

Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2/3 under, 1/3 above. So the fraction above is 1/3. Looking at the options, that's option G: 1.0/2, no. Wait, option G is 1/2. Hmm. Wait, no. Let me check the options again. 

Options are:

A:5/6, B:2/3, C:1/4, D:3/4, E:7/9, F:4/5, G:1/2, H:1/3, I:1/9, J:2/5.

So option H is 1/3. So the fraction above is 1/3.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had 1/3. But another approach: when the fraction submerged is 2/3, the fraction above is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3. So the correct answer would be H: 1.0/3.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Another approach: the cube's density is 800 kg/m³, fluid is 1200 kg/m³. The fraction submerged is (cube)/(fluid) = 2/3. So 2/3 is submerged, which means 1/3 is above. So option H is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, I'm a little confused because I thought sometimes the calculation could be different. Let me make sure.

Another way: mass of cube is 100 kg. The fluid's density is 1200 kg/m³. So the volume of the displaced fluid is 100 / 1200 = 0.083333 m³. The cube's volume is 0.125 m³.

So, the fraction submerged is 0.083333 / 0.125 = 0.666666, which is 2/3. Therefore, the fraction above is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. So yes, 1/3 of the cube's volume is above the surface. That's option H.
</think>

To determine the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface of the fluid, we use Archimedes' principle. The cube's density is calculated as:

\[
\rho_{\text{cube}} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{100 \, \text{kg}}{(0.5 \, \text{m})^3} = \frac{100}{0.125} = 800 \, \text{kg/m}^3.
\]

The fluid's density is given as \( \rho_{\text{fluid}} = 1200 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \). Since the cube is less dense than the fluid, it floats, and the fraction submerged is:

\[
f_{\text{submerged}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{cube}}}{\rho_{\text{fluid}}} = \frac{800}{1200} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

Thus, the fraction of the cube's volume that is above the surface is:

\[
f_{\text{above}} = 1 - f_{\text{submerged}} = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

From the given options, the fraction above the surface is \( \frac{1}{3} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
