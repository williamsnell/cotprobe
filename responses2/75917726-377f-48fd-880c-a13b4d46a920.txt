Okay, so I've got this question about the effective rate of yield for a stock. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the stock is selling for $60 and pays an annual dividend of $2. I need to find the effective rate of yield. I remember that the yield can be calculated in different ways, like simple yield or effective yield, but I think for this context, it's referring to the effective annual yield.

Wait, the effective rate of yield is usually the yield multiplied by 100 and divided by the price, right? Because the yield is the annual dividend divided by the current price. So I think the formula is:

Effective Rate of Yield = (Dividend per year / Current Stock Price) * 100%

Let me plug in the numbers. The dividend is $2, and the price is $60. So that would be (2 / 60) * 100. Calculating that: 2 divided by 60 is 0.033333... Multiply by 100 gives 3.3333...%, which is approximately 3 and 1/3 percent.

Looking at the options, option B is 3(1/3)%, so that should be the answer. Wait, what's the other options? Option A is 2.5%, that would be if the yield was 2/60, which is 3.33%. Option C is 4%, which doesn't match. Options D is 5%, which would be higher than that. So yeah, B is the correct one.

The effective rate of yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the stock price and multiplying by 100%. For this stock, it's (2 / 60) * 100% = 3(1/3)%.

Answer: B
