Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the "golden age of American agriculture" during the last two decades before World War I. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me options from A to J. I remember that the 1910s-1920s were a time of great agricultural growth in the U.S. Let me try to piece this together.

First, I know that during this period, agriculture was booming. That's a strong hint. Looking at the options, options C and D mention government taxes and crop exports. I thought the 1910s had something to do with high taxes because that's when the U.S. started to consolidate control. Wait, I recall that the 1910s were a "Golden Age" because of high tariffs on imports and the 1914-1923 agricultural boom. So, probably C is not the right answer because it's about high taxes, which happened after the war. The war started in 1917, so the 1910s were before that.

Option D talks about crop exports being reduced. I think the U.S. was importing a lot of food, especially potatoes. The 1910s saw a decrease in trade with other countries, leading to a decline in agricultural exports. But the question is about the "golden age," which refers to the agricultural growth, not the decrease in exports. So D might not be the right answer.

Option A mentions demand for farm products, prices, and incomes rising. That sounds like a positive economic indicator, which fits with the golden age. So A could be a contender.

Option E is about land grants for farming being abolished. I remember that in the 1910s, land grants were a big deal. For example, the Great Grange land grants made farming easier and more widespread. abolished land grants would have stifled innovation and led to a decline in agriculture. So E probably isn't correct.

Option F is about the introduction of the industrial revolution. The 1910s were just before the 1920s, which is the start of the industrial revolution. So F is not the right answer.

Option G is about widespread commercial fertilizer use. I think fertilizers were introduced in the early 1900s, maybe 1911, to help with crop yields. But I'm not sure if that's the reason for the golden age. The question is about the "two decades prior," so maybe it's that the 1910s were known for their expansion into new areas, like the Midwest and North, which is a different reason.

Option H is about the Great Depression ending. No, the 1920s saw the Great Depression when the 1920s were the start. So H is incorrect.

Option I is about widespread commercial fertilizer use. Maybe that's a contributing factor, but I'm not certain if it's the reason for the "golden age." The question is more about the economic conditions, perhaps.

Option J is about a population decrease. I don't recall the 1910s being associated with a decrease in population. Population growth was more likely during the 1920s.

So between A and C: A talks about demand and income, which are positive signs. C is about government actions, which happened after the war.

Wait, the question is about the "two decades prior" to World War I. So the period is 1910s. The 1910s were the "golden age" because of expansion into new areas, but I think the main reasons were economic growth and expansion.

Alternatively, the high tariffs and increased trade restrictions were part of the 1910s, which is before the war. So why was the two decades prior to the war the golden age? Because during those years, the U.S. was developing agriculture rapidly. So the correct answer is probably A, because it's pointing to the right economic factors.

The two decades prior to World War I, from 1910 to 1919, were known as the "golden age of American agriculture." This era was marked by significant economic growth, particularly in the Midwest and North. The correct reasons were likely tied to the expansion of farming into new areas, increased trade restrictions, and the introduction of new agricultural techniques such as commercial fertilizer.
