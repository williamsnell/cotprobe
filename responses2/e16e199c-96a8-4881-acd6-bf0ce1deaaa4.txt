Okay, so I've got this question here about the population increase in Victoria. Hmm, let's see. The population this year is about 42,600, and ten years ago it was approximately 30,000. I need to find the percentage increase. Alright, I remember that percentage increase is calculated by taking the difference between the new and old values, dividing by the old value, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. So the formula is [(New - Old)/Old] * 100.

Let me plug in the numbers. The new population is 42,600 and the old population was 30,000. So the difference is 42,600 minus 30,000, which is 12,600. Now I divide that by the original population, 30,000. So 12,600 divided by 30,000. Let me do that math. 12,600 รท 30,000 equals 0.42. Oh wait, that can't be right because 30,000 times 0.42 is 12,600. So yeah, that's correct. Then I multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So 0.42 times 100 is 42%. Hmm, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option A is 38%, B is 25%, C is 55%, D is 60%, E is 35%, F is 45%, G is 40%, H is 50%, I is 42%, J is 52%. So I got 42%, which is option I. That seems right. But wait, I think I made a mistake. Oh wait no, I think I did. Because when I calculate (42600 - 30000)/30000, it's 12600/30000 which is 0.42, which is 42%. So that's correct. So the answer should be I, which is 42%.

The percentage increase in population is calculated as:

\[
\frac{42600 - 30000}{30000} \times 100 = \frac{12600}{30000} \times 100 = 0.42 \times 100 = 42\%
\]

Answer: I: 42%
