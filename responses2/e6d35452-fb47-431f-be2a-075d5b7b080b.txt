Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about the last character of the response, which should be the letter I've chosen. The main question is asking about the tandem back-and-forth evolution of closely related species, which is exemplified by predator-prey relationships. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terminology here.

First, I need to understand what each of the options means. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Microevolution. Microevolution sounds like small-scale evolutionary changes. That's more about variations within a species, not necessarily the tandem process between species.

Option B: Speciation. Speciation is when a population of organisms becomes divided into two distinct groups. This happens through mutations, genetic recombination, or other factors, leading to the development of different behaviors or traits. It's about the formation of new species.

Option C: Coevolution. Coevolution is when two or more species change over time because their behaviors and traits affect each other. Like predators and prey evolving together. This seems relevant because it's about how species interact and adapt to each other's changes.

Option D: Adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiation is when a species rapidly develops multiple adaptations to different environments. It's more about a sudden shift in traits, not necessarily a gradual process.

Option E: Macroevolution. Macroevolution involves large-scale changes, like the evolution of species over generations or changes in global ecosystems. It's about big changes rather than the tandem evolution between species.

Option F: Convergent evolution. This is when similar traits develop in unrelated species independently. Like different animals having similar STRUCTURES, which is a form of parallel evolution.

Option G: Gradual evolution. This is the slow, incremental changes in a species over generations, which is more about microevolution or gradual changes.

Option H: Punctuated equilibrium. This is a theory about how species undergo long periods of stasis (no evolution) followed by rapid evolution. It's more about the timing of evolution phases rather than the type of evolution itself.

Option I: Divergent evolution. Divergent evolution leads to different traits in different species, like different beak shapes in different bird species. This is also about trait differences due to different evolutionary paths.

Option J: Parallel evolution. Wait, this is similar to convergent evolution. Parallel evolution refers to the simultaneous development of similar traits in unrelated species. Like the wings of bats and birds. So, both F and J describe similar processes, but the options have J as a separate choice.

Now, the question is about tandem evolution between closely related species, which is a predator-prey example. So, I'm thinking of a process where two species are evolving in a way that helps them relate to each other.

In predator-prey relationships, both the predator and prey are evolving together. Like a snake and its prey. The prey might be adapting to the predator's behavior, and the predator might be adapting to the prey's life history. This mutual evolution is a classic example of coevolution.

So, looking back at the options, C is coevolution, which matches the scenario described. The other options don't fit as well. Adaptive radiation (D) is about rapid changes, not mutual evolution. Microevolution (A) is small changes, macroevolution (E) is large, etc.

So the answer should be C.

The tandem back-and-forth evolution described in the question, exemplified by predator-prey relationships, best fits the concept of coevolution. This process involves two or more species evolving together due to their interaction, such as how a predator and its prey adapt to each other's behaviors. 

Answer: C
