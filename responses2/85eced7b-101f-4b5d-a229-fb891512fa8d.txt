Question:

7.3-3. Let $p$ equal the proportion of triathletes who suffered a training-related overuse injury during the past year. Out of 330 triathletes who responded to a survey, 167 indicated that they had suffered such an injury during the past year.
(a) Use these data to give a point estimate of $p$.

Options:

A:  $0.5061$
B: $0.6000$
C: $0.4000$
D: $0.7000$
E: $0.5894$
F: $0.4562$
G: $0.6531$
H: $0.3077$
I: $0.7500$
J: $0.5500$

Okay, so I've got this question here about finding a point estimate for a proportion. Let me think through it step by step. The question says that p is the proportion of triathletes who had a training-related overuse injury in the past year. They survey 330 triathletes, and out of those, 167 said they did suffer such an injury.

Hmm, a point estimate is just a single value estimate of a population parameter. In this case, since we're dealing with a proportion, the point estimate should be the sample proportion. That makes sense because the sample proportion is the best single estimate based on the data.

So the formula for the sample proportion (p̂) is the number of successes divided by the total number of trials. Here, the number of successes is 167 (the number of triathletes who had injuries), and the total number of trials is 330 (total triathletes surveyed).

Let me calculate that: 167 divided by 330. Let me do the division. 330 goes into 167 zero times. So 330 * 0.5 is 165. So 167 is 2 more than 165. So 0.5 plus (2/330). Wait, 2 divided by 330 is approximately 0.00606. So 0.5 + 0.00606 is about 0.50606.

Wait, let me double-check that division. 330 × 0.5 is 165. 167 minus 165 is 2. So 2/330 is 1/165, which is approximately 0.0060606. So adding that to 0.5, we get approximately 0.50606.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.5061, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be option A.

To find the point estimate of the proportion \( p \), calculate the sample proportion as \( \hat{p} = \frac{\text{number of successes}}{\text{total trials}} = \frac{167}{330} \approx 0.5061 \). This corresponds to option A.

Answer:
A: \( 0.5061 \)
