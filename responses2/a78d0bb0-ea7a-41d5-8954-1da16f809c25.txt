Okay, so I've got this question about vitamins and which ones are lost most readily when you cook. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nutrition, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists various vitamin pairs and asks which are lost during cooking. I remember that some vitamins are more easily broken down or metabolized than others. I think vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and vitamin A (thiamine) are the main ones that are lost during cooking. That's because they are water-soluble and have more water molecules in their structures, making them better for digestion. So when you cook, the water in them leaves, leading to their breakdown.

Looking at the options, option A is vitamin C and thiamin. That fits what I was thinking. Let me see the other options to make sure. Option B has niacin and riboflavin, which are B vitamins. I don't think they're as quickly lost as C and A. Option C has riboflavin and vitamin C, which is the opposite of what I remember. So C is probably not correct. Option D has vitamin A and riboflavin; I don't think A is lost as readily as C. Option E is B and D, which are B vitamins but not the ones I'm recalling. 

Option F is vitamin B6 and B12, which are part of the B group but not the ones I thought about losing easily. Option G is D and E, which are thiamine and folate. I believe thiamine is more easily lost. Option H is B12 and vitamin F (which is folate), probably not the right pair. Option I has E and niacin, which I don't think are the main ones. Option J is A and K, which I don't think are the primary ones either.

So the correct answer should be option A: vitamin C and thiamin. That makes sense because when you cook, the water in these vitamins leaves, leading to their breakdown, which happens quickly.
