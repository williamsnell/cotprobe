Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the maximum possible order of an element in the symmetric group S₆. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but let me try to think this through. 

First off, I remember that the symmetric group Sₙ consists of all possible permutations of n elements. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer m such that the element raised to the m-th power equals the identity. For permutations, the order is determined by the cycle structure of the permutation.

Right, so for a permutation to have the maximum possible order in Sₙ, it should be composed of cycles whose lengths are factors of that order, and the product of their lengths should be n. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, it's about having cycles whose lengths are as large as possible, but I think the correct approach is to have the permutation decomposed into cycles whose lengths are factors of the order, and their least common multiple (LCM) is the order itself.

Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me think again. The order of a permutation is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of its cycles. For example, if a permutation is a single cycle of length 3 and another of length 2, the order is LCM(3,2)=6. So, to maximize this, I need to find a way to split the n elements into cycles where the LCM of their lengths is as large as possible.

In S₆, n is 6. I need to partition 6 into positive integers (cycle lengths) such that their LCM is maximized. Let's list all possible cycle decompositions and compute their LCMs.

First, the possible cycle structures for S₆ are:

1. One 6-cycle: order is LCM(6) =6.
2. One 3-cycle and one 2-cycle: LCM(3,2)=6.
3. Two 3-cycles: LCM(3,3)=3.
4. One 4-cycle and one 2-cycle: LCM(4,2)=4.
5. One 4-cycle and two 1-cycles (but wait, 1-cycles are effectively not present as they don't contribute to the order, so maybe it's a 4-cycle and two separate 1-cycles? No, 4+2=6, but 1-cycles are identity, so it's equivalent to a 4-cycle. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as a 4-cycle and two fixed points, but the fixed points don't affect the order. So in terms of cycles, it's a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle, but wait, 4+2=6, so that's one part. The LCM of 4 and 2 is 4.

Alternatively, another decomposition could be a 3-cycle and three 1-cycles, but that's the same as a single 3-cycle. Wait, no, that's a 3-cycle and three fixed points. The LCM is 3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all possible partitions of 6 into cycle lengths.

Possible partitions (summing to 6):

1. 6 → LCM(6) =6
2. 5 +1 → but 5+1=6, but LCM(5,1)=5
3. 4+2 → LCM(4,2)=4
4. 4+1+1 → LCM(4,1,1)=4
5. 3+3 → LCM(3,3)=3
6. 3+2+1 → LCM(3,2,1)=6
7. 3+1+1+1 → LCM(3,1,1,1)=3
8. 2+2+2 → LCM(2,2,2)=2
9. 2+2+1+1 → LCM(2,2,1,1)=2
10. 2+1+1+1+1 → LCM=2
11. 1+1+1+1+1+1 → LCM=1

Wait, but perhaps I should consider all possible combinations of cycle lengths that add up to 6, not just those of two cycles. Let's think about all the possible cycle type combinations (ordered by the number of cycles and their lengths) and compute their LCMs.

Let me make a table:

- 6: LCM=6
- 5+1: LCM=5
- 4+2: LCM=4
- 4+1+1: LCM=4
- 3+3: LCM=3
- 3+2+1: Let's see, 3+2+1=6. The LCM is LCM(3,2,1)=6. So the order is 6.
- 3+1+1+1: LCM=3
- 2+2+2: LCM=2
- 2+2+1+1: LCM=2
- 2+1+1+1+1: LCM=2
- 1+1+1+1+1+1: LCM=1

Wait, but the 3+2+1 case: 3+2+1=6. So the LCM is LCM(3,2,1)=6. So the order is 6. So that's the same as the 6-cycle. Hmm.

Are there any other partitions? Let's see:

Another way: 2+2+2=6? No, that's 2+2+2=6, which is 6 in terms of cycles. The LCM is 2.

Wait, no, 2+2+2 is 6, so each is a 2-cycle. So order is 2.

Alternatively, 3+2+1=6: LCM(3,2,1)=6.

Wait, what about 4+1+1: LCM(4,1,1)=4.

Another approach: perhaps the maximum possible order is 6, as in the 3+2+1 and 6-cycles.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think about another possible cycle type. Oh, wait, 3+2+1 is 6 elements, but 3+2 is 5 elements. Wait, no, 3+2 is 5, so 3+2 would sum to 5. Wait, I must have made a mistake in my earlier partitioning.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the possible cycle types that add up to 6.

Let me list all possible cycle type partitions:

- All 1-cycles: order 1.
- One 2-cycle and four 1-cycles: order 2.
- One 3-cycle and three 1-cycles: order 3.
- One 4-cycle and two 1-cycles: order 4.
- One 5-cycle and one 1-cycle: order 5.
- One 6-cycle: order 6.
- Two 3-cycles: order 3.
- One 3-cycle and one 2-cycle and two 1-cycles: 3+2+1=6. LCM(3,2,1)=6. So the order is 6.
- One 2-cycle and four 1-cycles: order 2.
- Two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles: order 2.
- One 2-cycle and one 4-cycle: order 4.
- One 2-cycle and one 3-cycle and one 1-cycle: order 6.
- One 2-cycle and two 2-cycles: order 2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider the possible cycle types and their LCMs. For example, the cycle type of a 3+2+1 would have LCM 6. Similarly, a 6-cycle is 6. So both cases give order 6.

Wait, but are there any cycle types that could give a higher order? Let me think.

Wait, another way: For numbers that sum to 6, perhaps the maximum LCM is 6. Let me see.

Wait, what about 2+2+2=6. The LCM is 2.

What about 3+3=6. The LCM is 3.

Alternatively, 2+3=5—no, wait, 2+3=5. No, 2+3+1=6. LCM(2,3,1)=6.

Alternatively, 2+2+2=6, order 2.

So, the maximum order we can get from S₆ is 6. But wait, looking at the options, I see that option B is 48, which is way higher. That can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait a second. I think I'm making a mistake. Because in S₆, the maximum order is actually 6. But wait, wait, no, wait. No, that's not right. Because 6 is less than 48, but I remember that in Sₙ, the maximum order is actually larger. For example, in S₇, the maximum order is 42 (7*3*2), but for S₆, perhaps the maximum order is 60 or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me approach this again.

The maximum order of an element in Sₙ is given by the maximum product of integers that sum to n, where each of those integers is the length of a cycle, and the product is the LCM of those integers. Wait, no, the LCM is the order.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the possible cycle decompositions and their LCMs. Let's list all possible partitions of 6 into positive integers (since each cycle length must be at least 1, but including 1's doesn't contribute to the order). So the possible partitions are:

1. 6 → LCM=6.
2. 5+1 → LCM=5.
3. 4+2 → LCM=4.
4. 4+1+1 → LCM=4.
5. 3+3 → LCM=3.
6. 3+2+1 → LCM=6.
7. 3+1+1+1 → LCM=3.
8. 2+2+2 → LCM=2.
9. 2+2+1+1 → LCM=2.
10. 2+1+1+1+1 → LCM=2.
11. 1+1+1+1+1+1 → LCM=1.

Wait, but wait, is that all? Are those all possible partitions?

Wait, what about 3+2+1: 3+2+1=6. So the cycle lengths are 3,2,1. The LCM is 6.

Another possible partition: 4+2=6. LCM is 4.

Wait, but what about 2+2+2: sum is 6. LCM is 2.

Another partition: 3+3: sum is 6. LCM is 3.

Wait, what about 2+3: sum is 5. Oh wait, but that's not 6. So 2+3+1=6. So the LCM is 6.

Another approach: perhaps a 2-cycle, a 3-cycle, and a 1-cycle. But the 1-cycles don't contribute, so the LCM is LCM(2,3)=6.

Wait, so in this case, the maximum order is 6. But looking at the options, option B is 48. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, wait a second. Perhaps I'm forgetting that the maximum order is actually higher. I think I'm confusing the number of elements with the order. Let me think again.

Wait, no. For S₆, the maximum order is 720 (which is 6!), but that's the order of the entire group. The maximum order of an element within the group is the largest possible LCM of cycle lengths that sum to 6. So the options provided are A:30, B:48, C:24, D:6, E:60, F:36, G:12, H:105, I:18, J:72.

Wait, but earlier I thought the maximum order is 6, but J is 60. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps another way to compute this: the maximum order is the maximum number that can be expressed as the product of numbers, each of which divides some number, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let me think of possible cycle structures and their LCMs. Let's see:

Possible decompositions and their LCMs:

1. 6 → LCM 6
2. 5+1 → LCM 5
3. 4+2 → LCM 4
4. 4+1+1 → LCM 4
5. 3+3 → LCM 3
6. 3+2+1 → LCM 6
7. 3+2+1 → same as 6
8. 3+1+1+1 → LCM 3
9. 2+2+2 → LCM 2
10. 2+2+1+1 → LCM 2
11. 2+1+1+1+1 → LCM 2
12. 1+1+1+1+1+1 → LCM 1

Wait, but wait, another possible decomposition is 2+2+2, which is sum 6. The LCM is 2.

Alternatively, 3+2+1=6: LCM is 6.

Is there a way to get a higher LCM? For example, 4+2=6. The LCM is 4, which is less than 6.

Wait, perhaps 2+3+1=6: same as 3+2+1. So LCM is 6.

So according to this, the maximum order in S₆ is 6. But the options have J as 60. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct cycle decomposition. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the maximum order is the largest possible product of integers that sum to n, considering that each integer is a cycle length, and the product is the LCM of those integers.

Wait, but for 6, the maximum LCM is 6. So that would suggest that the maximum order is 6. But that's not among the options except option D is 6, which is present.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of another approach. For Sₙ, the maximum order is the largest number which can be expressed as a product of integers whose sum is n, and the product is the LCM of those integers.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the maximum order is 60. Because 60 is 5×4×3, but no, 5+4+3 is 12, which is more than 6. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should find all possible cycle types:

Possible cycle types for S₆:

1. 6-cycle → order 6.
2. 5 +1 → order 5.
3. 4 +2 → order 4.
4. 4 +1+1 → order 4.
5. 3 +3 → order 3.
6. 3 +2 +1 → order 6.
7. 3 + 2 +1 → same as 6.
8. 3 +1 +1 +1 → order 3.
9. 2 +2 +2 → order 2.
10. 2 +2 +1 +1 → order 2.
11. 2 +1 +1 +1 +1 → order 2.
12. 1+1+1+1+1+1 → order 1.

Wait, so the maximum order is 6. But that's not one of the options except option D. But wait, the options are A:30, B:48, C:24, D:6, E:60, F:36, G:12, H:105, I:18, J:72.

Hmm, that suggests that the maximum order is 6, but perhaps I'm missing something. Because earlier, I thought of 60 as a possible order.

Wait, perhaps I should think of a different approach. Maybe the maximum order is the maximum possible product of cycle lengths that sum to n, with each cycle length being a factor of the order. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the maximum order is the largest number m such that m divides the product of m and some other numbers that sum up to n. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum order is the largest m such that m can be expressed as a product of integers (each a cycle length) that sum to n, and the product is m.

Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. I think I'll need to look for the correct formula or method.

I recall that the maximum order of an element in Sₙ is equal to the largest number that can be written as a product of integers greater than 1, whose sum is less than or equal to n. But I'm not exactly sure about that.

Alternatively, I think the correct way is to find the set of cycle lengths that sum to n and have the maximum LCM. So for S₆, the possible cycle types and their LCMs.

Wait, perhaps the maximum order is 60. No, wait, that would require a cycle of length 5 and another of 3, but 5+3=8>6. So that's not possible.

Wait, another approach: what's the maximum LCM possible for cycle lengths that sum to 6. Let's list all possible partitions and their LCMs.

Possible partitions:

1. 6 → LCM 6.
2. 5+1 → LCM 5.
3. 4+2 → LCM 4.
4. 4+1+1 → LCM 4.
5. 3+3 → LCM 3.
6. 3+2+1 → LCM 6.
7. 3+2+1 → same as 6.
8. 3+1+1+1 → LCM 3.
9. 2+2+2 → LCM 2.
10. 2+2+1+1 → LCM 2.
11. 2+1+1+1+1 → LCM 2.
12. 1+1+1+1+1+1 → LCM 1.

So the maximum LCM is 6. Hence, the maximum order in S₆ is 6. But in the options, D is 6.

Wait, but J is 60, which is higher. So perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that a cycle of length 5 and a cycle of length 2 would sum to 7, which is more than 6. So that's not possible.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the maximum order is 60 because that's the LCM of 5 and 3 and 2. But to have cycles of 5,3,2, their sum would be 5+3+2=10, which is more than 6. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the maximum order is 60 because it's the product of 5,3,2, but the sum is 10>6, which is not possible. So that can't be.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the maximum order is 60, which would require that the cycles are 5, 3, and something else that sums to 6. Wait, 5+3+ something? 5+3+ something is 8, which is more than 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum order is 60 because of a 5-cycle and a 3-cycle, but that's impossible in S₆. So perhaps my earlier conclusion that the maximum order is 6 is correct.

Wait, but that would mean that the answer is D:6. But looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a cycle type that gives a higher LCM. Let's see.

Wait, another possible cycle type is 3+3+ something. 3+3=6. So that's two 3-cycles, LCM 3.

Wait, another possibility: 3+2+1=6. So the LCM is LCM(3,2,1)=6.

Wait, another possible decomposition: 2+2+2=6. LCM is 2.

Wait, another possible decomposition: 2+3=5, but that's not 6.

Wait, perhaps 2+2+2=6. No, that's 6 elements.

Wait, perhaps 3+2+1=6. So that's 3,2,1. The LCM is 6.

So according to this, the maximum order is 6. So option D is 6.

But wait, the options list J as 60. So perhaps I'm missing a cycle type that gives a higher LCM. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in considering the possible cycle types. Let me try to find all possible partitions of 6 and their LCMs.

Partitions of 6:

1. 6 → LCM 6.
2. 5 +1 → LCM 5.
3. 4 +2 → LCM 4.
4. 4 +1 +1 → LCM 4.
5. 3 +3 → LCM 3.
6. 3 +2 +1 → LCM 6.
7. 3 +1 +1 +1 → LCM 3.
8. 2 +2 +2 → LCM 2.
9. 2 +2 +1 +1 → LCM 2.
10. 2 +1 +1 +1 +1 → LCM 2.
11. 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 → LCM 1.

Wait, so the maximum LCM is 6. So the maximum order is 6, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 60 is the maximum order in S₇, which is not correct. Because in S₇, the maximum order is 7×3×2=42, not 720. So perhaps the maximum order in S₆ is 60, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that a 5+1+1+1+1+1 would sum to 10, which is impossible. So that's not a valid cycle type.

Wait, perhaps another cycle type: 3+3+ something. 3+3=6, but that's two 3-cycles, which is LCM 3.

Wait, another idea: perhaps 3+2+1=6, which gives LCM 6.

Hmm. So according to this, the maximum order in S₆ is 6, which is option D.

But wait, the options don't include 60. So perhaps the correct answer is D:6.

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the maximum order in S₆ was 60. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concept of the order in the symmetric group with the order in a different context. Let me think about the order of an element in S₆ again.

The order of an element in a permutation group is the least common multiple of the lengths of the cycles in its cycle decomposition. So for example, a 6-cycle has order 6. A 5-cycle and a 1-cycle have order 5. A 4-cycle and a 2-cycle have order 4. A 3-cycle and a 2-cycle and a 1-cycle have order 6. So the maximum is 6.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D:6.

But wait, the options list J as 60. So perhaps I'm missing a cycle type that gives a higher LCM. Let me think.

Wait, another possible cycle type is 3+3+ something. 3+3=6. So that's two 3-cycles, LCM 3.

Wait, another possibility: 3+2+1=6. So the LCM is LCM(3,2,1)=6.

Wait, another idea: perhaps 2+2+2=6. LCM is 2.

Wait, another possible decomposition: 2+3=5, but that's not 6.

Wait, perhaps 2+2+2=6. No, that's 6 elements.

Wait, perhaps 3+2+1=6. So that's 3,2,1. The LCM is 6.

So according to this, the maximum order is 6. So the correct answer is D:6.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I'm confusing the concept of the order with the concept of the order in the symmetric group. Wait, no, the order is the same as the order of the permutation.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum order in S₆ is actually 60, which would require that the cycles are 5,3, and 2, but their sum is 10>6, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering that 60 is the maximum order in S₇. Wait, in S₇, the maximum order is 7×3×2=42. So no, that's not 60.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering that the maximum order in S₆ is 60, but in reality, it's 6. So I think I should go with D:6.

But wait, the options given are A:30, B:48, C:24, D:6, E:60, F:36, G:12, H:105, I:18, J:72.

Wait, so according to my analysis, the maximum order in S₆ is 6, which is option D.

Wait, but why isn't J:60 the answer? Maybe because I'm making a mistake in considering that 60 is the order of an element in S₉, for example. Because in S₉, the maximum order is 9×4×3=108, but 60 is possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept of the maximum order in Sₙ with the maximum order in Sₙ × Sₘ.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just recap.

The maximum order of an element in S₆ is the largest LCM of any set of cycle lengths that sum to 6.

Looking at all possible cycle types:

1. 6 → LCM 6.
2. 5 + 1 → LCM 5.
3. 4 + 2 → LCM 4.
4. 4 + 1 + 1 → LCM 4.
5. 3 + 3 → LCM 3.
6. 3 + 2 + 1 → LCM 6.
7. 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 → LCM 3.
8. 2 + 2 + 2 → LCM 2.
9. 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 → LCM 2.
10. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 → LCM 2.
11. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 → LCM 1.

So the maximum LCM is 6. Hence, option D:6 is the answer.

But wait, looking at the options, J is 60. So perhaps the correct answer is J:60. But according to my analysis, the maximum order is 6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the possible cycle types.

Wait, another possible cycle type: 2+2+2=6. LCM is 2.

Another: 3+3=6. LCM is 3.

Another: 4+2=6. LCM is 4.

Another: 5+1=6. LCM is 5.

Another: 3+2+1=6. LCM is 6.

So the maximum is 6.

Therefore, the correct answer is D:6.

Wait, but the options given include J:60. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the maximum order is 60 because that's the LCM of 5, 3, and 2, but the sum is 5+3+2=10, which is more than 6. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should just go with the analysis that the maximum order is 6. Therefore, the answer is D:6.
</think>

The maximum order of an element in the symmetric group \( S_6 \) is determined by considering all possible cycle decompositions of the symmetric group. The key factors are the cycle lengths and their least common multiples (LCMs).

### Analysis of Cycle Decompositions

1. **6-cycle (6 elements):** The LCM is 6.
2. **5-cycle and 1-cycle (5 elements):** The LCM is 5.
3. **4-cycle and 2-cycle (4 + 2 = 6 elements):** The LCM is 4.
4. **4-cycle and two 1-cycles (4 + 1 + 1 = 6 elements):** The LCM is 4.
5. **3-cycle and 3-cycle (3 + 3 = 6 elements):** The LCM is 3.
6. **3-cycle, 2-cycle, and 1-cycle (3 + 2 + 1 = 6 elements):** The LCM is 6.
7. **3-cycle, two 1-cycles, and one 1-cycle (3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 elements):** The LCM is 3.
8. **2-cycle, two 2-cycles, and two 1-cycles (2 + 2 + 2 = 6 elements):** The LCM is 2.
9. **2-cycle, two 1-cycles, and two 1-cycles, and one 1-cycle (2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 elements):** The LCM is 2.
10. **1-cycles only (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 elements):** The LCM is 1.

### Conclusion

The maximum LCM obtained from the cycle decompositions is **6**. Therefore, the maximum order of an element in \( S_6 \) is **6**.

ANSWER: D
