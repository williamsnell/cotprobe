Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these remainder problems. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question is asking for the smallest positive integer that leaves specific remainders when divided by 5, 7, and 9. Specifically, it leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, 4 when divided by 7, and 2 when divided by 9. The options given are A through J, and I need to find which one is the correct answer.

Hmm, so I think this is a problem involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem. I remember that the Chinese Remainder Theorem helps solve systems of congruences, especially when the moduli are coprime. But wait, in this case, the moduli are 5, 7, and 9. Let me check if they are pairwise coprime.

5 and 7 are coprime since their GCD is 1. 5 and 9: 5 is prime, 9 is 3 squared, so they don't share any common factors besides 1, so they are coprime. 7 and 9: 7 is prime, 9 is 3 squared, so again, GCD is 1, so they are coprime as well. So yes, all moduli are pairwise coprime, so the Chinese Remainder Theorem applies. That's good news because it means there should be a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli. The product here is 5*7*9 = 315, so the solution will repeat every 315 numbers. So the smallest positive integer should be less than 315.

But to find the exact number, I think I need to solve the system step by step. Let me break it down.

Let me write down the three congruences:

1. N ≡ 3 mod 5
2. N ≡ 4 mod 7
3. N ≡ 2 mod 9

I need to find N that satisfies all three. So perhaps I can solve two at a time and then combine the results.

Let me start with the first two. Let's find N such that N ≡ 3 mod 5 and N ≡ 4 mod 7.

Let me express N from the first congruence. N = 5k + 3, where k is an integer.

Now, substitute this into the second congruence:

5k + 3 ≡ 4 mod 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

5k ≡ 1 mod 7

Now, I need to find k such that 5k ≡ 1 mod 7. Let me find the inverse of 5 mod 7. Because 5 and 7 are coprime, an inverse exists.

What's the inverse of 5 mod 7? That is, find a number x such that 5x ≡ 1 mod7.

Let me try x=3: 5*3=15. 15 mod7 is 1, since 7*2=14, 15-14=1. So x=3 is the inverse.

So, k ≡ 3 mod7. Therefore, k =7m +3, where m is an integer.

Substituting back into N's expression:

N =5*(7m +3) +3 =35m +15 +3=35m +18.

So N ≡18 mod35. So the solutions for the first two congruences are numbers of the form 35m +18.

Now, let's include the third congruence: N ≡2 mod9.

Substitute N =35m +18 into this:

35m +18 ≡2 mod9.

Let's compute 35 mod9 and 18 mod9.

35 divided by9 is 3*9=27, 35-27=8, so 35≡8 mod9.

18 mod9 is 0, since 18 is 2*9.

So the equation becomes: 8m +0 ≡2 mod9 → 8m ≡2 mod9.

I need to solve for m: 8m ≡2 mod9.

Let me find the inverse of 8 mod9. Since 8 and 9 are coprime, an inverse exists.

Looking for x such that 8x ≡1 mod9.

Testing x=8: 8*8=64. 64 mod9: 9*7=63, 64-63=1. So x=8 is the inverse.

Multiply both sides of 8m ≡2 mod9 by 8:

m ≡ 2*8 mod9 → m≡16 mod9. 

But 16 divided by9 is 1*9=9, 16-9=7, so 16 mod9=7. So m≡7 mod9. Thus, m=9n +7, where n is an integer.

Substituting back into N=35m +18:

N=35*(9n +7) +18=315n +245 +18=315n +263.

So N≡263 mod315. The smallest positive integer would be when n=0, so N=263.

Looking at the options, option D is 263. So the answer should be D.

The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer N that satisfies three congruences. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we break down the problem into solving two congruences first and then combining the results. The calculations show that N ≡ 263 mod 315, making the smallest positive integer 263. 

Answer: D: 263
