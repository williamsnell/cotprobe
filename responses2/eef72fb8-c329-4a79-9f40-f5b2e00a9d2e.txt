The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?

Options:

A: Early Parkinson disease
B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin therapy
D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen therapy
E: Increase in alcohol consumption
F: Hyperthyroidism
G: Bereavement reaction
H: Adverse effect of lisinopril therapy
I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress
J: Onset of multiple sclerosis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about a patient's worsening tremor. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. A 70-year-old woman has been experiencing tremor for most of her life, but it's been getting worse over the past month. She's embarrassed to eat with others because the tremor is obvious. She's been taking fluoxetine for three weeks to cope with her husband's death two months ago. Her medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia managed by Lisinopril and Atorvastatin, respectively. She used to drink one to two drinks a month but now drinks one glass daily because it helps with tremor. She's 168 cm, 70 kg, BMI 25, which puts her at a sedentary lifestyle, and her vital signs are 36.4°C, 80/min pulse, 18/min breathing, and blood pressure 130/85 mmHg. Physical exam shows moderate tremor but not at rest.

The options are A to J, each suggesting a possible cause. I need to match her symptoms with the options given.

Let me think about each possibility.

Option A: Early Parkinson disease. That's a condition where tremors begin suddenly and worsen. But in this case, the tremor started at rest, so it's not the start. Also, her medications include fluoxetine, which is an SSRI. If she had Early Parkinson, maybe she'd have tremors at rest, but she's at rest. So A might not fit.

Option B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine. Well, fluoxetine is an antidepressant. It's used to treat depression, anxiety, and other conditions. If she has a severe mental illness, maybe her mood changes would affect her tremors. But her medical history includes Lisinopril (for hypertension) and Atorvastatin (for hyperlipidemia). So fluoxetine's effect might be less likely here.

Option C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin is a statin used to lower cholesterol. Statins are often prescribed for high cholesterol. If someone has statin use, they might have side effects. However, her current medication is ibuprofen, not statins. So this might not be the right answer.

Option D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen therapy. Ibs are used for pain relief, like headaches or joint pain. But her medical history includes Lisinopril, which is for hypertension and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. Her current treatment is occasional ibuprofen. If she had a brain injury or something, ibuprofen could cause tremors. But this seems more like a possible cause, but I'm not sure if that's the correct answer.

Option E: Increase in alcohol consumption. She used to drink one to two, now one glass daily because of tremor. Alcohol can cause tremors, especially in the hands. That's a possible explanation. So E is a possibility.

Option F: Hyperthyroidism. Her blood pressure is 130/85, which is a bit low for hyperthyroidism, which usually is higher. Also, her other meds include lisinopril (high BP usually lowers) and atorvastatin (lowers HDL). So hyperthyroidism is less likely.

Option G: Bereavement reaction. She's gone through a partner's death, which can cause physical reactions. But her tremor is mild and not at rest. She still drinks alcohol now, which is related to her current condition. So G is possible, but does she have a history of trauma or something that would cause a reaction?

Option H: Adverse effect of lisinopril therapy. Lisinopril is used for hypertension. If her condition worsened because of her treatment, but her current treatment is ibuprofen. The question is about her current medications, so if she was on lisinopril, it might have adverse effects. But she's not; her current treatment is ibuprofen. So H might not fit.

Option I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress. Essential tremors are due to stress. But the question states that the tremor started at rest and has been worsened. Essential tremors usually occur at rest and are caused by stress. So maybe she's experiencing an essential tremor now. But her condition is getting worse, so maybe stress is part of it.

Option J: Onset of multiple sclerosis. That's a long-term condition with varying symptoms, but it's not typically acute. She's 70, and the tremor has been present for most of her life. Also, her condition is worsening, not progressing.

Now, let's look at the physical examination. She has moderate tremors at rest, but hasn't been at rest. She's currently drinking more alcohol as a coping measure. Her blood pressure is within normal range (moderate). Her vital signs are normal. So the cause is likely related to her current medications, or her alcohol use.

She has been taking ibuprofen for pain. If she's on ibuprofen, it's possible that it's causing the tremor. So E (increase in alcohol) and I (essential tremor) are possibilities. But the question says the patient is 70 and in her late 50s. Her condition has worsened, which makes me think it's an acute issue.

Her medical history includes hyperlipidemia and hypertension, so her blood pressure is normal but her condition is getting worse. So the cause is likely due to her current medications or perhaps it's an adverse effect of one of them.

Looking at the options, E suggests alcohol consumption is increasing, which fits her current behavior. But it's possible that her condition is worsening due to the medications, but the question is about the cause.

Alternatively, her tremor is an essential tremor exacerbated by stress. But I think that's more of a long-term condition rather than acute.

Another angle: fluoxetine could cause tremors in severe cases, but her current treatment is ibuprofen. So maybe the answer is E.

Wait, let me think again about the question. Her condition has worsened, which makes me think it's an acute issue. She's 70 and in her late 50s, so her condition is likely acute.

Her current symptoms are from her treatment. She's taking ibuprofen for pain, which could be causing tremors. So perhaps the answer is E: increase in alcohol consumption. Or is it her current condition that's worsening, so her current condition is the cause.

Wait, the question is asking which is the most likely cause of her worsening tremor. So her current condition is probably the cause.

So, the possible causes are E (alcohol) or I (multiple sclerosis). But she's 70, so likely not MS. If it's MS, the tremors may be part of it, but the question says she's 70, and the tremor has been present for most of her life. MS is a long-term condition.

So the cause is likely related to her current medications, and the fact that she's taking ibuprofen, which can cause tremors. So E (increase in alcohol) doesn't fit, because alcohol is her current behavior, not her condition. Alternatively, E is a possible reason.

Wait, but the question is about the patient's condition. So the cause is likely due to her current condition. Her condition is worsening, which could be due to the medications. So her current medications are contributing to the tremor.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is likely E because her current medical treatment (ibuprofen) is causing her to have more tremors. Alternatively, her alcohol consumption (E) is her current behavior, but that's more of a symptom.

Wait, the question is about the patient's worst tremor. So the cause is what's causing the tremor. Her condition is worsening due to her treatment, so the cause is likely her current medication. So E's answer is about alcohol consumption as a factor. But her condition is due to her current medications.

Wait, another angle: She's on ibuprofen for pain. Her condition has worsened, which could be from her treatment. So the answer is E.

Alternatively, her current medical condition (like stress) could be causing the tremor. But I think the best fit is E because her alcohol consumption is her current behavior, not her condition.

Wait, but the patient's condition is worsening due to her medications. Her current medications are contributing to the tremor. So the cause is her current medications. But in the options, which one is about her medications.

Looking at the options again:

E: Increase in alcohol consumption.

But her condition is worsening, not because of alcohol. So her current condition is the cause, not her alcohol.

Wait, the options are possible causes of the tremor. So her condition is the cause. So the answer would be E if alcohol is part of the condition, but her condition is due to her current medications. Therefore, the correct answer is E: her alcohol consumption is increasing because she's dealing with her condition.

Alternatively, if her condition is due to her medications, but the question is about the cause of the tremor, which is her current condition.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E, because her condition has worsened, so her alcohol is her current behavior, but it's her current condition that's causing the tremor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The patient's tremor worsened, so the cause is likely due to her treatment. Her treatment includes ibuprofen, which is causing the tremor. So the answer is E: increase in alcohol consumption. Or perhaps it's her current medical condition, which is contributing to the tremor.

Alternatively, the answer could be E because her alcohol is her current behavior, and the condition is worsening due to her treatment. But the question is about the cause of the tremor, so her current condition is the cause.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option E is "Increase in alcohol consumption", which is her current behavior, not her condition.

Option G is "Bereavement reaction", which I think refers to emotional or physical symptoms of grief or loss of a loved one, which might cause tremors. But her condition is getting worse, so it's not necessarily a mere symptom.

Option E: She's drinking more alcohol, which is a known contributor to tremors, especially at rest. But her condition is at rest, so maybe her tremors are in addition to her current condition.

Alternatively, she's been taking ibuprofen for pain, so her condition is worsened because of her treatment. So the cause of her tremor is her condition, which is worsening because of her treatment.

Wait, the question is about the reason the patient's tremor is worsening. Her current condition (like stress or chronic illness) is causing the tremor.

But looking at the options, E (alcohol) is a possible contributor. So the answer is E.

Alternatively, if her condition is acute, it's more likely due to her medications. So the answer is E.
</think>

The patient's worsening tremor is most likely due to her current medical condition, which is exacerbated by her treatment. Her condition has worsened, and her current medications, including ibuprofen for pain, are contributing to the tremor. The question asks for the most likely cause of the tremor, and among the options provided, the best fit is **E: Increase in alcohol consumption**. However, it is important to note that alcohol consumption is her current behavior, not her condition. 

Another possibility is that her condition is due to stress or chronic health issues, but these are not directly listed as options. Among the given choices, **E** is the most plausible answer, as it aligns with her current behavior and the worsening nature of her tremor.

ANSWER: E
