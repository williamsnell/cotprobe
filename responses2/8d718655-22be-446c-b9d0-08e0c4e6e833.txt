Alright, so I've got this problem here about finding the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a given kinetic energy. Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of the particle. Oh wait, right, the formula is lambda equals h divided by p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum.

But wait, the electron's kinetic energy isn't given directly. Oh right, the kinetic energy (KE) is given as 100 eV. So I'll need to find the momentum from that. I think the formula connecting kinetic energy and momentum is derived from the kinetic energy equation. Let me think, the kinetic energy is KE = (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass. So I can rearrange that to solve for p: p = sqrt(2m * KE). 

But wait, the mass needs to be in kilograms because the SI units for momentum are kg·m/s. Oh right, the mass given in the problem is 9.11 × 10^-28 grams. So I'll need to convert that to kilograms. That's 9.11e-31 kg. Got it.

So, let's plug that into the equation. KE is 100 eV. Wait, but I should convert that into joules because momentum is in kg·m/s. Oh wait, 1 eV is equal to 1.602e-19 joules. So 100 eV would be 100 * 1.602e-19 J, which is 1.602e-17 J. Wait, no, wait: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 100 eV is 100 * 1.602e-19 = 1.602e-17 J. I think I got that right.

So, p = sqrt(2 * m * KE). Let me compute that. m is 9.11e-31 kg, KE is 1.602e-17 J. So 2 * m is 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30. Multiply by KE: 1.822e-30 * 1.602e-17 = ? Let's calculate that. 1.822 * 1.602 is approximately 2.918. The exponents are 1e-30 * 1e-17 = 1e-47. So the product is 2.918e-47. Then, p = sqrt(2.918e-47) = let's see, the square root of 2.918 is about 1.708, and the square root of 1e-47 is 1e-23.5, which is 1e-23.5 = sqrt(1e-47) = 1e-23.5 = 3.16e-24. So approximately 1.708e-23.5? Wait, wait. Wait, 1e-47 is (1e-23.5)^2. So the square root is 1e-23.5. So sqrt(2.918e-47) is sqrt(2.918) * 1e-23.5. So sqrt(2.918) is about 1.708. So p is approximately 1.708e-23.5 kg·m/s. Wait, 1e-23.5 is 3.16e-24. So 1.708 * 3.16e-24 is about 5.41e-24 kg·m/s. Hmm, wait, maybe I should do this more accurately.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute sqrt(2 * m * KE). Let's compute 2 * m = 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30 kg. Multiply by KE: 1.822e-30 * 1.602e-17 = 2.921e-47 kg·m²/s². Then, p = sqrt(2.921e-47) = sqrt(2.921) * sqrt(1e-47). sqrt(2.921) is about 1.709. sqrt(1e-47) is 1e-23.5, which is 3.16e-24. So p = 1.709 * 3.16e-24 = approximately 5.41e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me check. 1.709 * 3.16 is about 5.41. So p ≈5.41e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, the de Broglie wavelength is h/(p). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So lambda = (6.626e-34) / (5.41e-24) = ?

Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 divided by 5.41e-24 is approximately (6.626 /5.41) * 1e-10. 6.626 /5.41 is about 1.223. So 1.223e-10 meters. Wait, 1e-10 meters is 0.1 nanometers, which is 0.1 A (angstroms). Wait, 1e-9 meters is 1 nm, 1e-10 is 1 A. So 1.223e-10 meters is 0.1223 angstroms? Wait, but the options are in the range of 0.4 to 2 angstroms. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait a second. Maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p.

Alternative approach: Maybe I can use the formula for kinetic energy in terms of wavelength. Oh wait, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength relates to the momentum, and the kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m). So the wavelength lambda can be found using the formula involving the mass, kinetic energy, and Planck's constant.

Wait, another way to express lambda is h / sqrt(2 m KE). Alternatively, using the formula lambda = h / (sqrt(2 m KE)).

Let me plug in the numbers again. h = 6.626e-34 J·s. m = 9.11e-31 kg. KE = 100 eV = 1.602e-17 J.

So KE is 1.602e-17 J. So 2 m KE is 2 * 9.11e-31 * 1.602e-17 = 2 * 9.11 * 1.602 = approximately 2*(14.6) = 29.2. So 29.2e-48 (since 1e-31 *1e-17 = 1e-48). So 2 m KE = 29.2e-48 = 2.92e-47 kg·m²/s².

Then, p = sqrt(2 m KE) = sqrt(2.92e-47) = around 5.4e-24 kg·m/s, same as before.

So, lambda = h/(p) = 6.626e-34 /5.4e-24 = (6.626/5.4) * 1e-10 = approx 1.223 * 1e-10 m. Which is 1.223e-10 meters. Convert that to angstroms (since 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m). So 1.223e-10 m = 1.223 A. Hmm, looking at the options: option F is 2.226 A, option G is 1.226 A. Oh wait, 1.223 is close to 1.226. But the options are in order from 0.4 to 2.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of 2 m KE. Let me recalculate that.

m = 9.11e-31 kg. KE = 100 eV = 100 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-17 J.

So, 2 m * KE = 2 * 9.11e-31 * 1.602e-17.

Let me compute 9.11e-31 * 1.602e-17 first. Multiply 9.11 * 1.602 = approximately 14.60. So 14.60e-48. Then multiply by 2: 29.2e-48. So 2 m KE = 2.92e-47 kg·m²/s².

So, sqrt(2.92e-47) = sqrt(2.92) * 1e-23.5. sqrt(2.92) is about 1.709. 1e-23.5 is 3.16e-24. So p = 1.709 * 3.16e-24 = 5.41e-24 kg·m/s.

h is 6.626e-34. So 6.626e-34 divided by 5.41e-24 is (6.626/5.41) * 1e-10.

6.626 /5.41: let's compute. 5*1.223 =6.115. 6.626-6.115=0.511. 0.511 /5.41≈0.0945. So total is approximately 1.2235.

So lambda is 1.2235e-10 m, which is 1.2235 A. Looking at the options, option G is 1.226 A, which is very close. So the answer is G.

Wait, but wait a minute. I thought that 100 eV is a high energy, so perhaps the de Broglie wavelength should be smaller, which matches the calculation.

But wait, let me think about the formula again. Another approach: using the de Broglie wavelength formula, lambda = h / sqrt(2 m KE).

Alternatively, the relation lambda^2 = h^2/(2 m KE). So lambda is h divided by sqrt(2 m KE).

Wait, but another way to think: the relationship between wavelength and kinetic energy.

Alternatively, I can use the formula lambda = h / sqrt(2 m KE).

Wait, but wait, perhaps it's better to use units properly. Let me redo the calculation.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

m = 9.11e-31 kg.

KE = 100 eV = 1.602e-17 J.

So, 2 m KE is 2 *9.11e-31 kg * 1.602e-17 J = 2 * 9.11e-31 * 1.602e-17.

Compute 9.11e-31 *1.602e-17 = (9.11 *1.602) * 1e-48 = 14.60 * 1e-48 → 1.460e-47 kg·m²/s².

Multiply by 2: 2.92e-47 kg·m²/s².

p = sqrt(2.92e-47) = sqrt(2.92) * 1e-23.5 → 1.709 * 3.16e-24 → 5.41e-24 kg·m/s.

lambda = h/p → 6.626e-34 /5.41e-24 = (6.626 /5.41) * 1e-10.

6.626 /5.41 = let me compute that.

5 * 1.223 =6.115. 6.626-6.115=0.511.

0.511 /5.41 = approximately 0.0945.

So 1.223 +0.0945 ≈1.3175. So lambda ≈1.3175e-10 m →1.3175 A.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1.326 A. The closest is option A (1.326) and G (1.226). Wait, I'm getting 1.3175, which is about 1.32 A. But none of the options exactly match. Hmm.

Looking back at the options:

Options:

A: 1.326 A

B: 0.426 A

C:1.626 A

D:1.026 A

E:0.726 A

F:2.226 A

G:1.226 A

H:2.526 A

I:0.926 A

J:1.926 A.

Wait, option A is 1.326, which is very close to what I'm getting (1.3175). So why is the option G at 1.226 A? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the calculation of KE? Let me recheck that.

The kinetic energy is 100 eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 100 eV is 100 * 1.602e-19 = 1.602e-17 J. That's correct.

Then, 2 m KE = 2 * 9.11e-31 * 1.602e-17 = 2*(9.11 *1.602) * 1e-48.

Wait, 9.11 *1.602 is let me compute that. 9*1.6 is 14.4, 0.11*1.6 is 0.176, 9*0.002 is 0.018, 0.11*0.002 is 0.00022. So 14.4 +0.176=14.576 + 0.018=14.594 +0.00022=14.5942. So 14.5942e-48 *2=29.1884e-48 →2.91884e-47.

So sqrt(2.91884e-47) = sqrt(2.91884) * 1e-23.5. sqrt(2.91884) is approx 1.709. 1e-23.5 is 3.16e-24. So 1.709 *3.16e-24 is 5.41e-24 kg m/s.

h is 6.626e-34 J s. So lambda is 6.626e-34 /5.41e-24 = (6.626/5.41) *1e-10.

6.626 /5.41 = let me compute: 5*1.223=6.115, as before. The difference is 0.511. 0.511/5.41= approx 0.0945. So 1.223 +0.0945=1.3175. So lambda is 1.3175e-10 m = 1.3175 A.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.326 A). So that would be the correct answer. But why is option G (1.226 A) present? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula for de Broglie wavelength. Another formula I remember is lambda = h/(sqrt(2 m KE)), which is the same as what I used. So perhaps I should compute using the kinetic energy in terms of eV.

Wait, another approach: 1 eV = h c / (e 2 pi m). Wait, no. Wait, I think another way to compute the de Broglie wavelength is using the relation in terms of the relativistic momentum, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the formula lambda = h/(sqrt(2 m KE)).

Wait, perhaps a better way to approach this is to use the relativistic equation for momentum. Wait, no, because the electron is at 100 eV, which is non-relativistic (since 100 eV is about 0.06% of the speed of light), so I can use the non-relativistic formula.

Wait, another formula for momentum: p = sqrt(2 m KE) → so lambda is h/(p) = h/(sqrt(2 m KE)).

Wait, another thing: sometimes people use the formula lambda = h / (sqrt(2 m E)), where E is in Joules. Which is the same as what I used. So I'm confident in the calculation. So why is option G (1.226) present? Because 1.226 is close to 1.223, which is what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the square root. Maybe I should compute 2 m KE more accurately.

m =9.11e-31 kg.

KE =1.602e-17 J.

Then, 2 m KE = 2 *9.11e-31 *1.602e-17.

Let's compute 9.11 *1.602 first:

9.11 *1.602 = let's compute 9 *1.602 =14.418, 0.11*1.602=0.17622. So 14.418 +0.17622=14.59422.

So 9.11 *1.602 =14.59422.

So 2 m KE = 2 * 14.59422e-48 (since 1e-31 *1e-17=1e-48). So 28.18844e-48.

Take the square root of 28.18844e-48. So sqrt(28.18844) is about 5.308.

So sqrt(28.18844) = 5.308.

So sqrt(28.18844e-48) =5.308e-24.

So p =5.308e-24 kg·m/s.

h is6.626e-34.

So lambda=6.626e-34 /5.308e-24.

6.626 /5.308 ≈1.252.

So lambda=1.252e-10 m →1.252 A.

The options are:

A:1.326 A

G:1.226 A

So 1.252 is between these two. But none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 2 m KE.

Wait, let me compute 9.11e-31 * 1.602e-17.

9.11e-31 is 9.11 * 1e-31.

1.602e-17 is 1.602 *1e-17.

Multiply them: 9.11 *1.602 =14.59422.

Multiply the exponents: 1e-31 *1e-17 =1e-48.

So 14.59422e-48 =1.459422e-47.

Then, 2 *1.459422e-47 =2.918844e-47.

So 2 m KE is 2.918844e-47 kg·m²/s².

p = sqrt(2.918844e-47) = sqrt(2.918844) * 1e-23.5.

sqrt(2.918844) is about 1.7086.

1e-23.5 is 3.1623e-24.

So p =1.7086 *3.1623e-24.

Compute 1.7086 *3.1623: 1.7 *3=5.1, but more accurately:

3.1623 *1.7086.

1.7086 *3 =5.1258.

1.7086 *0.1623 = approx 0.2775.

Wait, sorry, perhaps better to compute 1.7086 *3.1623.

Let me compute 1.7086 *3 =5.1258.

1.7086 *0.1623 = let's compute 1.7086 *0.1 =0.17086.

1.7086 *0.06 =0.102516.

1.7086 *0.0023 =0.00392978.

So adding up: 0.17086 +0.102516=0.273376 +0.00392978=0.277305.

So total p =5.1258 +0.277305 =5.403105e-24 kg m/s.

So h is6.626e-34.

lambda =6.626e-34 /5.4031e-24 = (6.626 /5.4031) *1e-10.

6.626 /5.4031 = let's compute.

5 *1.223 =6.115, which is less than 6.626.

Difference is 0.511.

0.511 /5.4031 ≈0.0943.

So total is approximately 1.223 +0.0943=1.3173.

So lambda ≈1.3173e-10 m →1.3173 A.

So, in the options, the closest is option A (1.326 A) and option G (1.226 A). But 1.3173 is closer to 1.32 than 1.22. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option A, but the calculation I did gives 1.3173 A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Compute p = sqrt(2 m KE) = sqrt(2 * m * KE)

But KE is 100 eV =100 *1.602e-19 J =1.602e-17 J.

So 2 m KE =2 *9.11e-31 kg *1.602e-17 J.

Compute 9.11e-31 *1.602e-17: 9.11 *1.602 =14.59422 → 14.59422e-48 → 1.459422e-47 kg.

Multiply by 2: 2.918844e-47 kg.

p = sqrt(2.918844e-47) = sqrt(2.918844) *1e-23.5.

sqrt(2.918844) is approximately 1.7086.

1e-23.5 = 3.1623e-24.

So p =1.7086 *3.1623e-24.

Compute 1.7086 *3.1623.

= (1.7 *3.1623) + (0.0086 *3.1623)

1.7 *3.1623 =5.37591.

0.0086 *3.1623 ≈0.02727.

So total is 5.37591 +0.02727=5.40318.

So p=5.40318e-24 kg m/s.

Now, lambda = h/(p) →6.626e-34 /5.40318e-24.

Compute 6.626e-34 /5.40318e-24 = (6.626/5.40318) *1e-10.

6.626 /5.40318 = approx 1.2236.

So lambda =1.2236e-10 m →1.2236 A.

Which is close to option G (1.226 A) and option A (1.326 A). But which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the formula. Let me think again about the formula.

The de Broglie wavelength is lambda = h/(p), where p is the momentum.

Momentum p can be expressed as p = sqrt(2 m KE), where KE is the kinetic energy.

So, lambda = h/(sqrt(2 m KE)).

Alternatively, lambda = h/(sqrt(2 m KE)).

So, putting in the numbers:

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

m=9.11e-31 kg.

KE=1.602e-17 J.

So,

lambda =6.626e-34 / sqrt(2 *9.11e-31 *1.602e-17).

Calculate what's inside the square root first.

2 *9.11e-31 *1.602e-17 = (2 *9.11) * (1e-31 *1e-17) *1.602 = 18.22 *1e-48 *1.602.

Wait, 18.22 *1e-48 *1.602 =18.22 *1.602e-48.

Compute 18.22 *1.602.

18 *1.602 =28.836.

0.22 *1.602 =0.35244.

Total:28.836 +0.35244=29.18844.

So 2 *9.11e-31 *1.602e-17 =29.18844e-48 →2.918844e-47.

So sqrt(2.918844e-47) = approx 5.403e-24 kg m/s.

So, lambda=6.626e-34 /5.403e-24 = (6.626/5.403) *1e-10.

6.626 /5.403 = approx 1.2236.

So lambda=1.2236e-10 m=1.2236 A.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.226 A, which is very close. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the intended answer is option G.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the square root. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute sqrt(2.918844e-47) = sqrt(2.918844) *1e-23.5.

sqrt(2.918844)=1.7086.

1e-23.5=3.1623e-24.

So 1.7086 *3.1623e-24 =5.403e-24.

So, lambda=6.626e-34 /5.403e-24 = (6.626/5.403) *1e-10.

6.626 /5.403 = let me calculate it more accurately.

5.403 *1.223=?

5.403 *1 =5.403.

5.403 *0.2 =1.0806.

5.403 *0.02=0.10806.

5.403 *0.003=0.016209.

Adding all together:5.403 +1.0806=6.4836 +0.10806=6.59166 +0.016209=6.607869.

Wait, that's 5.403 *1.223=6.607869.

But I have 6.626. So 6.626 is a bit higher.

The difference is 6.626 -6.607869=0.018131.

So how much more than 1.223 is needed?

0.018131 /5.403 = approx 0.00335.

So 1.223 +0.00335=1.22635.

So approximately 1.2264.

So lambda≈1.2264e-10 m=1.2264 A.

Which is option G.

So the correct answer should be option G, 1.226 A.

Wait, but why did I get 1.3173 earlier? Because I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the square root.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating sqrt(2.91884). Let me compute it more accurately.

2.91884 is between 2.89 (which is 1.7^2) and 2.94 (which is approximately 1.715^2).

Wait, let's compute 1.708^2:

1.708^2 = (1.7 +0.008)^2 =1.7^2 + 2*(1.7)(0.008) +0.008^2.

1.7^2=2.89.

2*(1.7)(0.008)=0.0272.

0.008^2=0.000064.

So total:2.89 +0.0272=2.9172 +0.000064=2.917264.

Which is very close to 2.91884.

So 1.7^2=2.89, 1.708^2=2.917264.

Difference between 2.91884 and 2.917264 is 0.001576.

So, to find how much more than 1.708 is needed to get an additional 0.001576:

We have 1.708 + delta, such that (1.708 + delta)^2 =2.91884.

Expanding:

(1.708)^2 +2*1.708*delta +delta^2 =2.91884.

We know (1.708)^2=2.917264.

So 2.917264 + 3.416 delta + delta^2 =2.91884.

Assuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible.

So 3.416 delta ≈0.001576.

delta≈0.001576 /3.416≈0.00046.

So delta≈0.00046.

So 1.708 +0.00046=1.70846.

So sqrt(2.91884)=approx 1.70846.

Which is about 1.7085.

So p=1.7085 *3.1623e-24.

Compute 1.7085 *3.1623.

1.7 *3.1623=5.37591.

0.0085 *3.1623=0.026835.

Total:5.37591 +0.026835=5.402745.

So p=5.402745e-24.

So lambda=6.626e-34 /5.402745e-24 = (6.626/5.402745)*1e-10.

Compute 6.626 /5.402745.

5.402745 *1.226=?

Compute 5.402745 *1.226.

5 *1.226=6.13.

0.402745 *1.226= approx 0.402745*1=0.402745, 0.402745*0.226≈0.090835.

So 0.402745 +0.090835=0.49358.

So total:6.13 +0.49358=6.62358.

Which is very close to 6.626.

So 6.62358 is 5.402745 *1.226.

So 6.626 is 6.62358 +0.00242.

So, 0.00242 /5.402745 = approximately 0.000444.

So 1.226 +0.000444=1.226444.

So 6.626 /5.402745=1.226444.

So lambda=1.226444e-10 m=1.226444 A.

Which rounds to 1.226 A.

So the correct answer is option G, 1.226 A.

To determine the de Broglie wavelength, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p},
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, and \( p \) is the momentum. The momentum \( p \) can be expressed as:

\[
p = \sqrt{2m\,KE},
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the electron, \( KE \) is the kinetic energy, and \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).

### Step 1: Given values
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)
- \( KE = 100 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the momentum \( p \)
First, compute the term inside the square root:

\[
2m\,KE = 2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J}.
\]

\[
2m\,KE = (18.22) \times 10^{-48} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{J}.
\]

\[
2m\,KE = 1.822 \times 10^{-47} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{J}.
\]

Now, take the square root:

\[
p = \sqrt{2m\,KE} = \sqrt{1.822 \times 10^{-47}}.
\]

\[
p = 1.35 \times 10^{-23.5} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
\]

\[
p = 1.35 \times 3.162 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
\]

\[
p = 4.26 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength \( \lambda \)
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4.26 \times 10^{-24}}.
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626}{4.26} \times 10^{-10}.
\]

\[
\lambda = 1.56 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}.
\]

\[
\lambda = 1.56 \, \text{Å}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated wavelength is \( 1.56 \, \text{Å} \), which does not match any of the provided options. However, upon re-evaluating the calculations, it was found that the correct wavelength should be approximately \( 1.226 \, \text{Å} \), corresponding to **option G**.
