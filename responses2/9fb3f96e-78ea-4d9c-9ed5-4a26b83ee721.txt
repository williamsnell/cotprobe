Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the constant 'c' for the probability density function f(x) = c x³ (1 - x)^6, defined between 0 and 1. I'm a bit rusty on probability density functions, but I remember that for a function to be a valid pdf, it has to satisfy two main conditions: the function must be non-negative over the entire domain, and the integral of the function over that domain must equal 1.

Alright, so first, let me check the non-negativity condition. Since x is between 0 and 1, x³ is always positive, and (1 - x)^6 is also positive for the same reason because any number between 0 and 1 raised to any power remains positive. So, the product x³(1 - x)^6 is positive in the interval (0,1). Therefore, the function is non-negative, which is a good start.

Next, the main condition is that the integral of f(x) from 0 to 1 must equal 1. So, I need to compute ∫₀¹ c x³ (1 - x)^6 dx = 1. Since c is a constant, I can factor it out of the integral. That leaves me with c multiplied by the integral of x³ (1 - x)^6 dx from 0 to 1, which I need to compute and then solve for c.

Hmm, how do I compute this integral? I'm trying to remember the techniques for integrating polynomials within polynomials. Oh right, the Beta function! The Beta function is defined as ∫₀¹ t^{a-1} (1 - t)^{b-1} dt, which equals (a-1)! (b-1)! / (a + b - 1)! when a and b are positive integers. Alternatively, it's related to the Gamma function, but in this case, since the exponents are integers, maybe it's easier to compute using the Beta function.

Wait, looking at the integral ∫₀¹ x³ (1 - x)^6 dx, I can see that it's in the form of Beta function with a = 4 (since x³ is x^{3} → a-1=3 ⇒ a=4) and b =7 (since (1-x)^6 → b-1=6 ⇒ b=7). So, the integral is Beta(4,7). 

The Beta function can be expressed in terms of Gamma functions: Beta(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b) / Γ(a + b). But for integers, Gamma(n) = (n-1)! So, Beta(4,7) = (Γ(4)Γ(7)) / Γ(11). Since Γ(4) = 3! =6, Γ(7)=6! =720, and Γ(11)=10! =3628800. So, Beta(4,7) = (6 *720)/3628800.

Wait, let me calculate that. 6*720 is 4320. Then 4320 divided by 3628800. Let me compute that division. 3628800 divided by 4320. Hmm, 4320 * 840 = 3628800? Let me check: 4320 * 800 = 3,456,000; 4320 * 40 = 172,800; adding those gives 3,628,800. Oh wait, but that's 4320*840= 4320*(800+40) = 3,456,000 + 172,800 = 3,628,800. So 3,628,800 is 4320 * 840, so 4320 / 3,628,800 = 1/840. So Beta(4,7) is 1/840.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Because Beta(4,7) = (Γ(4)Γ(7))/Γ(4+7) = (6 * 720)/3628800. 6 *720 =4320. 4320 / 3628800. Let me compute 3628800 / 4320. 4320 * 840 = 3,628,800. So 4320 /3,628,800 = 1/840. So yes, Beta(4,7)= 1/840.

Wait a second, but the Beta function is Beta(a,b) = ∫₀¹ t^{a-1} (1-t)^{b-1} dt. So in our case, a=4, b=7. So Beta(4,7) is the integral I'm computing, which is ∫ x³ (1-x)^6 dx from 0 to1 = 1/840.

So, going back to the original integral: ∫₀¹ c x³ (1 -x)^6 dx = c * (1/840) = 1. So, c = 840.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up a and b. Alternatively, there's a formula for the integral ∫₀¹ x^{k} (1-x)^n dx which is equal to B(k+1, n+1) = (k! n!)/( (k+n+1)! ) ). So in our case, k=3, n=6. So B(4,7) = (3! 6! )/(10! ) = (6 *720)/3628800 = (4320)/(3628800) = 1/840, which matches what I had before.

So, c = 840. Looking at the options, option J is 840. So that should be the answer.

To determine the constant \( c \) such that \( f(x) = c x^3(1-x)^6 \) is a probability density function (pdf) over \( 0 < x < 1 \), we need to ensure that the integral of \( f(x) \) over this interval equals 1. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 c x^3 (1-x)^6 \, dx = 1
\]

Since \( c \) is a constant, it can be factored out:

\[
c \int_0^1 x^3 (1-x)^6 \, dx = 1
\]

The integral \( \int_0^1 x^3 (1-x)^6 \, dx \) is a Beta function, \( \text{Beta}(4,7) \), which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Beta}(4,7) = \frac{\Gamma(4)\Gamma(7)}{\Gamma(11)}
\]

For integers, \( \Gamma(n) = (n-1)! \), so:

\[
\text{Beta}(4,7) = \frac{3! \cdot 6!}{10!} = \frac{6 \cdot 720}{3628800} = \frac{4320}{3628800} = \frac{1}{840}
\]

Thus:

\[
c \cdot \frac{1}{840} = 1 \implies c = 840
\]

The correct value of \( c \) is 840, which corresponds to option J.
