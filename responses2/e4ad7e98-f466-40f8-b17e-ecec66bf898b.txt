E: the farmer, because the buyer did not directly purchase the land from him.
F: the farmer, because no privity of estate existsbetween the buyer and the farmer.
G: the farmer, because the buyer was evicted due to a problem not related to the covenants in the deed.
H: the farmer, because the covenants are personalin nature and do not run with the land.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is a farmer who conveys 100 acres of his farm to a landscaper. The deed has three covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. Then, the landscaper sells the property to a buyer using a warranty deed. However, the buyer gets evicted by a woman because of paramount title. The buyer now wants to sue the farmer for breach of covenants. The question is, should the court order the farmer to pay, the buyer, or the other way around?

Hmm, I need to recall the covenants in a deed. The three main covenants are seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. 

Reversal of title, especially when the buyer is evicted, is a problem because of paramount title. Key points from my notes: 

1. A deed must have clear title. If the title is unclear, the covenants will fail.
2. The deed must specify which parties own the property, either through ownership by the grantor or by a warranty deed. A warranty deed is a type of deed that doesn't specify ownership, so the grantor must have good faith in his representation.
3. The deed must include the covenant against encumbrances, which ensures that the grantor (and any other party) doesn't encumber the property without consent of the owner.

So in this case, the buyer bought from the landscaper, who in turn bought from the farmer. The deed between the farmer and the buyer has the covenants. But the buyer later evicts without the farmer's direct purchase. So the issue is whether the covenants were breached.

Wait, the warranty deed is used to buy. But the initial conveyance was a deed with covenants. The warranty deed is between the grantor (landscaper) and the buyer. For the warranty deed, the covenant against encumbrances is a covenant that the grantor (landscaper) must be certain of the buyer's ownership. But the problem is paramount title—so if the buyer has no title, the grantor can't be sure.

Wait, but in this case, the farmer conveys to the landscaper, who conveys to the buyer. So the farmer's deed includes covenants. The buyer buys from the grantor, who is the landscaper. The warranty deed is between the grantor and the buyer. The warranty deed is a separate deed, but the covenant against encumbrances in the warranty deed is its own covenant. 

So the key here is whether the covenant against encumbrances was breached. Because the buyer's title is now in question, the covenant against encumbrances in the warranty deed must be checked. The warranty deed doesn't specify ownership, so the covenant is a covenant of the grantor. So if the grantor (landscaper) failed to meet the covenant, then the buyer is liable.

But the problem is that the buyer evicts without the farmer's direct purchase. Wait, the farmer's deed already has the covenants, including against encumbrances. So when the buyer bought from the grantor (landscaper), the covenant against encumbrances was breached because the grantor didn't have the right to enforce it. But the buyer later evicts, so the covenant is not enforced because the buyer didn't have the title.

Wait, but how does the covenant against encumbrances affect the buyer? The covenant is against any encumbrances, but if the covenant is breached, the grantor (landscaper) can’t enforce it. But the buyer is evicted, so the grantor (landscaper) doesn't have the right to enforce, and the buyer is the one who evicts. So the covenant was breached by the grantor, but the buyer failed to take title, so the covenant wasn't enforced.

But the problem is that the buyer evicted him. So the court must determine whether the covenant was breached and whether the buyer is liable. But the initial conveyance was a deed with covenants, but the buyer's title is in question. So the covenant against encumbrances in the warranty deed is a covenant that the grantor (landscaper) is bound to the buyer. If the grantor breached this covenant, the buyer can't enforce it, but the buyer is evicted, so the court must determine if the covenant was breached and whether it's enforceable.

Wait, but the covenant against encumbrances is a covenant that the grantor is bound to the buyer. If the grantor breached this, then the buyer has no right to enforce it. But if the buyer evicts, then the contract was broken, and the covenant doesn't matter. Or does it?

Wait, because the covenant is a covenant of the grantor. So if the grantor breached it, the buyer can't enforce it. But the buyer hasn't taken title yet, so the court has to see if the covenant was breached. However, if the buyer is evicted, the covenant isn't enforceable because the buyer didn't take title. So in that case, the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor, but the buyer didn't have title, so the court should find that the covenant wasn't enforceable. So the court would likely find that the covenant was breached by the grantor, and the buyer can't sue for breach of covenants because they didn't have title.

Wait, but in this scenario, the buyer is suing the farmer. So the question is, did the farmer breach the covenant against encumbrances?

Wait, the question is, who should pay? The options say either the buyer or the farmer. The options are A to I, with the Farmer being the options H, I, etc.

Wait, the issue is whether the covenant against encumbrances (from the warranty deed) was breached. The covenant is a covenant of the grantor (the grantor was the landscaper), so the covenant is against the buyer. If the buyer breached the covenant (i.e., didn't have title), then the covenant is breached, so the court should order the buyer to pay. But in this case, the buyer evicted, so the court may not be able to enforce the covenant because the buyer didn't have title.

Wait, but the court's decision is whether the covenant was breached. If the covenant was breached, the buyer is liable. But in this case, the buyer evicted, so he didn't have title, which means the covenant isn't enforceable. So the court should find that the covenant was breached, and the buyer is liable. So the court would order the farmer to pay.

But let's look at the options. The options are about who is liable: the buyer, the farmer, etc.

Looking at the options:

A: buyer for seisin and right to convey.

B: buyer for seisin and right to convey.

C: farmer for against encumbrances.

D: buyer for against encumbrances.

E: farmer because the buyer didn't directly purchase from him.

F: farmer because no estate between buyer and farmer.

G: farmer because covenants don't run with land.

H: farmer because covenants don't run with land.

Wait, the options are about the reason for the judgment, not the outcome. So the question is about the reason for the judgment, e.g., whether the farmer or the buyer is liable.

So, to recap, the covenant against encumbrances was a covenant that the grantor (landscaper) must be certain of the buyer's ownership. But when the buyer bought from the grantor, the covenant is a covenant against encumbrances. The covenant was breached because the grantor (landscaper) might not be certain. But the buyer evicted, so the grantor doesn't have the right to enforce it. Thus, the covenant isn't enforceable because the buyer didn't take title. So the covenant against encumbrances was breached.

But the question is about whether the farmer is liable. The farmer's deed includes the covenant. But the buyer's title is in question. So the covenant was breached by the grantor, but the court must decide whether it's enforceable. If the court holds the covenant wasn't enforceable (because the buyer didn't have title), then the covenant was breached, and the buyer is liable.

Wait, but in the initial conveyance, the farmer's deed includes the covenant. So the covenant isn't a covenant of the grantor. The covenant is against encumbrances, which is a covenant of the grantor (the grantor was the grantor, not the farmer). So the covenant is against the grantor's obligation. If the grantor breached the covenant, the buyer can't enforce it. But the buyer evicted, so he didn't have title. So the court can't enforce the covenant because the buyer had no title.

But the question is whether the court should order the farmer or the buyer to pay. So the court must decide if the covenant against encumbrances was breached.

So the court would find that the covenant was breached by the grantor (the grantor was the grantor, not the farmer). Because the covenant is against encumbrances, which is a covenant of the grantor. The grantor (the person who conveyed the property to the buyer, which was the landscaper) failed to meet the covenant, so the buyer can't claim breach. But the buyer evicted, so the court can't enforce the covenant because he didn't have title. Therefore, the court should find the covenant was breached by the grantor, and the buyer is liable.

But wait, the question is whether the court should order the farmer to pay or the buyer. So the possible outcomes are:

Either the buyer is liable because the covenant was breached, or the farmer is liable, but that would only be if the covenant was not breached.

So the key point is whether the covenant against encumbrances was breached. The covenant is a covenant against encumbrances, which is a covenant of the grantor. Therefore, the grantor (the person who conveyed the property, which was the grantor) breached it.

But because the buyer evicted, the court can't enforce the covenant. So the court would find that the covenant was breached by the grantor, and the buyer is liable.

So the question is about the reason for the judgment. Let's look at the options.

The options are about why the court should order the farmer or the buyer to pay.

Option D says the buyer because the covenant was against encumbrances.

Option H says the farmer because the covenants don't run with the land.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The covenants are about the grantor's obligations. So the covenant against encumbrances was a covenant of the grantor. The grantor is the person who gave the deed, which was the grantor (the grantor was the grantor, not the farmer). So if the grantor breached, then the buyer can't claim.

But the problem is that the buyer evicted. So the court can't enforce the covenant. So the court would find that the covenant was breached by the grantor, and the buyer is liable.

So the question is about the reason for the judgment. Let's look at the options.

If the court finds that the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor, then the buyer is liable. But the options are about the reason for the judgment, not the outcome.

Looking back, the options:

A and B: buyer for seisin and right to convey.

C: farmer, against encumbrances.

E: farmer, didn't directly buy.

F: farmer, no estate.

G: farmer, covenants personal.

H: farmer, covenants don't run.

I: buyer because warranty.

D: buyer, against encumbrances.

Wait, wait. The options are about who is liable. So the court should decide whether the farmer or the buyer is liable.

If the covenant against encumbrances was breached, then the buyer is liable. But because the buyer evicted, the covenant is not enforceable. So the court would find that the covenant was breached, and the buyer is liable.

But the options are about the reason for the judgment, not the outcome.

Wait, but the options are the possible reasons. So the correct reason would be that the covenant against encumbrances was breached.

Looking at the options, option D says the buyer because the covenant was against encumbrances. Option C says the farmer because against encumbrances.

Wait, but the covenant was against encumbrances, which is a covenant against the grantor. The grantor must ensure the buyer doesn't encumbr the property without the owner's consent. But the buyer evicted, so the court can't enforce it. Therefore, the court should find that the covenant was breached by the grantor, and the buyer is liable.

But that's about the reason for the judgment, not the outcome.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the covenant against encumbrances is a covenant against the grantor. The grantor breached it, so the buyer is liable. However, because the buyer evicted, the court can’t enforce it, so the covenant was breached and the buyer is liable.

But the options are about the reason for the court's decision. So the correct reason would be that the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor, but since the buyer evicted, the court can't enforce it, so the covenant wasn't breached (from the buyer's perspective) but the grantor did breach it. So the court would order the farmer to pay.

Wait, but the options are about the reason for the judgment. So the correct option is that the court should order the farmer to pay because the covenant against encumbrances was breached.

Looking back at the options, option C says the farmer because the covenant was against encumbrances. Option D says the buyer because the covenant was against encumbrances.

But wait, the covenant against encumbrances is against the grantor. The grantor breached it, so the court would find that the covenant was breached by the grantor, but the buyer had no title. So the court can't enforce the covenant, so the covenant was breached, and the buyer is liable.

So the correct reason is that the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor (the grantor was the person who conveyed the property, which was the grantor, not the farmer). So the court should order the farmer to pay if the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor. But the options don't have that option.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor, but because the buyer evicted, the covenant isn't enforceable. So the court should find that the covenant was breached by the grantor, but the buyer didn't have title, so the court can't enforce it. Therefore, the covenant against encumbrances was breached, and the buyer is liable.

But the options don't have "the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor, so the buyer is liable." So looking at the options, the one that says the covenant was breached by the grantor is option C or D.

Option C: farmer because against encumbrances.

Option D: buyer because against encumbrances.

But the court's reasoning is that the covenant was breached by the grantor, but the buyer couldn't enforce it. So the court concludes that the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor, and the buyer is liable.

But the options are about why the court should order the farmer or the buyer to pay.

So the court's decision is that the covenant against encumbrances was breached, so the buyer is liable. So the reason is that the covenant was breached by the grantor, but the buyer didn't have title. So the court found that the covenant was breached by the grantor, so the buyer is liable.

But the options don't have that. So the closest is option C or D.

Wait, the options are:

C: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances was breached.

D: the buyer, because the covenant was against encumbrances.

But because the covenant is against encumbrances, which is a covenant against the grantor, the court would find that the grantor breached it. Since the buyer evicted, the court can't enforce it. So the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor, but the buyer is liable.

Therefore, the court would find that the covenant was breached by the grantor, but the buyer is still liable. So the answer is that the court should order the farmer to pay because the covenant against encumbrances was breached.

Looking at the options, option C says the farmer because the covenant was against encumbrances. So I think C is the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the farmer should be held liable for breaching a covenant against encumbrances in a deed. The key issues are the nature of the covenant and the fact that the buyer evicted the property without title. Here's the analysis:

1. **Covenants and Covenants Against Encumbrances**:  
   - The deed includes three covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. The covenant against encumbrances is a covenant of the grantor (the person who conveyed the property, which was the grantor, not the farmer). Breaching this covenant means the grantor is obligated to ensure the property is free of encumbrances unless the owner's consent is obtained.

2. **Eviction and Title**:  
   - The buyer evicted the property without title, which means the covenant against encumbrances cannot be enforced. The covenant is a covenant of the grantor, and the grantor breached it. The buyer, therefore, is liable for the breach.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **A, B, F, I**: These options suggest the buyer is liable. However, the covenant against encumbrances is a covenant of the grantor, not the grantee, and the court cannot enforce it because the buyer evicted. Thus, these options are incorrect.  
   - **C**: This option states that the farmer is liable because the covenant against encumbrances was breached. This aligns with the reasoning that the covenant was breached by the grantor (the person who conveyed the property, which was the grantor, not the farmer), and the court can only enforce the covenant if the buyer had title. However, since the buyer evicted, the covenant was breached by the grantor, and the court should order the farmer to pay.  
   - **D**: This option suggests the buyer is liable because the covenant was against encumbrances. While the covenant was against encumbrances, the court cannot enforce it because the buyer evicted. The breach was of the grantor, not the buyer.  
   - **E, G, H, J**: These options incorrectly suggest either the farmer or the buyer is liable. The court's reasoning is that the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor, not the buyer, and the buyer is still liable because the covenant cannot be enforced without the grantor's consent.

The correct answer is **C**, as the court should order the farmer to pay because the covenant against encumbrances was breached by the grantor (the person who conveyed the property, which was the grantor, not the farmer). The buyer is still liable because the covenant cannot be enforced without the grantor's consent.
