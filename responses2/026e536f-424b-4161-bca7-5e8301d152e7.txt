Okay, so I need to figure out where Mr. Balfour should invest his $1,000. He's got two options: municipal bonds paying 6% and a savings account paying 8%. But wait, he has a marginal tax rate of 30%. Hmm, I remember that taxes affect how much income you earn, especially for different types of investments.

Municipal bonds are tax-free, right? So, if he puts his money into municipal bonds, the interest he earns is not taxed. But what about the savings account? Since savings accounts are taxable, even though the interest is simple, the taxes would be applied. So if he has a 30% tax rate, the savings account's return will be reduced by that rate.

Let's calculate the net returns. For the savings account without tax: 8% of $1k is $80. But since he's in a 30% tax bracket, he only gets 70% of that. So, $80 * 0.7 = $56. So, $56 after tax.

Municipal bonds are tax-free, so the $600 earned would be $600. Because there's no tax to pay on the interest from municipal bonds.

So, comparing the after-tax returns: the savings account gives him $56, and the municipal bonds give him $600. Clearly, the municipal bonds are better because $600 is more than $56.

Looking at the options, option I is a savings account, and option A is municipal bonds. So, he should choose option A, right?

Wait, but I should double-check. Suppose he invests in both. The savings account would be $56, and the municipal bonds $600. So definitely, the bonds are better.

Alternatively, the question is about where he should invest. He can't be mixing both because he's looking for a choice between the two. So I think the correct answer is A: Municipal bonds.

Mr. Balfour should invest in municipal bonds, as they provide a higher return after accounting for his 30% tax rate.
