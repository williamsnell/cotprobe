Okay, so I've got this question about Gresham's Law. Hmm, I remember that's a concept from economics. Let me think. I think it's related to how money works. Oh right, Gresham's Law is something about bad money being replaced by good money. I remember it's a principle that explains why a paper money system can be problematic.

So, what does it say? Oh right, it's that bad money can replace good money. Like, if you have counterfeit money, people will start accepting it as real if it's the same face value, which can cause problems. So bad money drives out good money. Option A is "Bad money drives out good." That sounds familiar.

Wait, what about the other options? Let me go through them quickly. Option B says value is proportional to quantity. That's more like the law of supply, not Gresham's Law. Option C talks about bad money increasing the value of good money. That doesn't sound right. Option D: Good money drives out bad. That's the opposite of what Gresham's Law says. Option E: Quantity determines value. Wait, that's more like the quantity theory of money. Gresham's Law is about quality, not quantity. So E isn't correct.

Option F is about money retaining value regardless of condition. That's more like the concept of stability, not Gresham's Law. Gresham's Law is about bad money taking over, not about how much the money holds.

Option G: Good and bad money circulate together. That doesn't make sense. If good money drives out bad, they wouldn't circulate together. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Intrinsic value less than nominal. I think Gresham's Law is more about the face value. The intrinsic value refers to the true value, so H might be mixing up concepts.

Option I: Money has no intrinsic value. No, that's the opposite. Intrinsic value is about what the money is worth, not whether it exists.

Option J: All money is equally desired. That's more like the idea of what people are willing to accept, not the economic principle behind Gresham's Law.

So putting it all together, the correct answer must be A. Bad money drives out good money because people will accept the real money (counterfeit or genuine) as good when it's the same value as bad.

The correct answer is:

**A: Bad money drives out good.**

Gresham's Law explains that bad money can be replaced by good money because people will accept the real money as the same value as the counterfeit. This principle is crucial in understanding the limitations of money systems.
