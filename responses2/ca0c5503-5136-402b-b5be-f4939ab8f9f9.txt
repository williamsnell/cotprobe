Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the basic principle of the commercial loan theory of banking. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance, but I'll try to think through it.

Okay, the question is asking what the basic principle is. The options are A to H and J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Talks about short-term loans and stability during crises. I remember that when banks are restricted to short-term loans, they might not have enough funds for big credit events. But I'm not sure if this is the basic principle. The basic might be more about what the theory suggests general people do.

Option B: Focuses on personal loans vs. commercial ones. I don't think this is the basic principle because the basic principle is probably more about the overall banking system's stability.

Option C: Excludes long-term infrastructure. I think the basic principle is about what the banking system should do, not specific to infrastructure. Like, banks shouldn't only lend long-term stuff.

Option D: Increasing interest rates to avoid panics. That sounds more like a policy tool, not the basic theory itself. The basic theory would probably suggest how to manage risk, not just how to prevent panics.

Option E: Lending to any sector. That doesn't sound right. The basic principle should be about the type of loans, not the sectors. Like, only long-term or maybe limited to certain types.

Option F: Unrestricted lending. That definitely sounds like a view that the banking system should lend to everyone, but that's more of a policy stance, not the fundamental principle.

Option G: Only international businesses. That's probably too restrictive. The basic principle should allow for various types of loans, not just international.

Option H: Limit loans to long-term. That's a specific policy, not the basic theory's main idea.

Option I: The theory is generally accepted today. Well, I'm not sure if it's widely accepted, but maybe it's more of a historical perspective.

Option J: Collateral quality over loan duration. I think this is part of the basic theory because the idea is that collateral can mitigate risk, and a longer loan period might allow for more risk management. So, J sounds relevant.

Wait, the basic principle states that the banking system should avoid default. So, the idea is that the system's stability comes from the proper management of credit risk. So, the basic principle is about how the banking system should lend, not what it should lend.

Looking back, option J says "the principle states that a bank should only offer loans to international businesses to minimize risk." That sounds more like the aim of the basic theory, which is about minimizing risk by not exporting too much short-term credit.

So the correct answer should be J. Because the basic principle would focus on the type of loans, not the sectors, and the aim is to minimize risk through proper management, which J captures.

The correct answer is J: The theory states that a bank should only offer loans to international businesses to minimize risk.
