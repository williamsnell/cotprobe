Question:

Explain the TRAILER CARD method of stopping a computer job, i.e., a program.

Options:

A: The Trailer Card method uses a serial number on the first card to stop a program.
B: The Trailer Card method uses a specific phrase typed into the console to signal the end of a job.
C: The Trailer Card method requires a specific card to be inserted physically into the computer.
D: The Trailer Card method involves sending an electronic signal through a network to stop the program.
E: The Trailer Card method employs a magnetic tape marker to indicate the end of a program.
F: The Trailer Card method uses a unique number on the last card in the data section of a program card deck to signal the end of a job.
G: The Trailer Card method utilizes a timer that automatically stops the program after a set duration.
H: The Trailer Card method involves pressing a designated key on the computer's keyboard to terminate the job.
I: The Trailer Card method requires the operator to manually switch off the computer to end the job.
J: The Trailer Card method uses a special code to pause a program.

Okay, so I have this question about the trailer card method used in stopping a computer job. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my computer networking basics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that trailer cards are used to signal the end of a program. But wait, how exactly does it work? Let me break it down.

The trailer card is part of a data and command card system, right? Each program has a card deck. These cards have sections, and the trailer card is in the data section. I think the data section contains the program's instructions, and the trailer card is used to trigger a specific command.

What's the process? I think the trailer card sends a signal, like a specific command, which is then processed by the computer's processor. The processor interprets this command and stops the program. Wait, so when the trailer card is inserted, it causes a command to be executed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Uses a serial number. I don't recall trailer cards using serial numbers. They probably use something else.

Option B: Specific phrase or command. That sounds right. The trailer card might have a specific command that, when called by the computer, stops the program.

Option C: Physical insertion of a card. No, I think the trailer card is inserted by the user, not physically.

Option D: Network signal. That's more like a network command, maybe, but I don't think it's the trailer card.

Option E: Magnetic tape marker. No, trailer cards are electronic, not magnetic.

Option F: Unique number. Wait, I'm not sure. The trailer card might have a specific ID number, but is that the end of the program? Or is it a signal?

Option G: Timer. That's not a method I remember for stopping programs. Some systems might have timers, but I don't think that's the trailer card method.

Option H: Pressing a key. That's more like a human intervention, not a program stopping method.

Option I: Operator manually switching off. No, that's not how it's done; the computer does it automatically.

Option J: Special code. I'm not sure about this either. It might refer to a specific code, but I don't think that's the method per se.

So, considering all options, the trailer card method likely uses a specific command or phrase. Looking back, option B says it uses a specific phrase. That seems correct. The trailer card sends a signal, like a program command, which the computer interprets as the end of the job.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another thought: some systems might have a card that includes a command such as a program termination command, but I don't recall that being the trailer card method. The trailer card is more about a visual signal.

So the answer should be option B: the trailer card uses a specific phrase.

The trailer card method involves a specific command or phrase that, when executed, terminates a program. 

Answer: B
