F: Evans' share is $4,800 and King's share is $4,800
G: Evans' share is $6,000 and King's share is $3,600
H: Evans' share is $5,000 and King's share is $4,600
I: Both Evans and King receive equal shares

Okay, so I've got this question about how profits are divided between two partners. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

So, the question says that Evans and King are partners in a copying service. They invested $8,500 and $6,500 respectively. The profits for the year were $9,600. The partners agreed to divide profits and losses based on their initial investments. I need to figure out how the $9,600 is split between them.

Hmm, so the first thing that comes to mind is that the profit-sharing ratio is based on their capital contributions. So their profit share is proportional to their investments. That makes sense because in many business agreements, profits are split according to how much each contributes.

Wait, but sometimes it's about salary or other factors, but here it's just about the initial investments. So, the idea is that the total investment is $8,500 + $6,500, which is $15,000. So the ratio would be 8,500 : 6,500. Let me see, 8500/15000 each part. So each part is 15000 divided by 15000 which is 1 per part. So, each part is $1. 

Wait, no, that's the total investment. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 8500 + 6500 is 15000, so their ratio is 8500:6500. Let me simplify that ratio. Both are divisible by 100, so 85:65. Then, 85 and 65 can both be divided by 5. 85 ÷ 5 is 17, 65 ÷5 is 13. So the ratio is 17:13.

So, the total profit is $9600. We need to divide this into parts proportional to 17:13. Let me think, the total parts are 17 +13=30 parts. Each part is $9600 divided by 30. Let me calculate that.

$9600 /30. 30 x 320 is 9600, right? Because 30x300=9000, 30x20=600, so 320. So each part is $320.

So, for the profit, each part is $320. So, for 17 parts, that's 17 x 320. Let me calculate that. 10 x320=3200, 7x320=2240. 3200+2240=5440. So Evans gets $5440.

King's part is 13 x320 = 4160. Because 10x320=3200, 3x320=960. 3200 +960=4160.

Let me check the math again. 8500 +6500 =15000. Ratio 17:13. Total parts 30. Each part $320. So 17x320=5440, 13x320=4160. 5440+4160=9600. Which matches the total profit. So the distribution is correct.

Looking at the options, option A is 'Evans: $5,440 and King: $4,160'. That's exactly what I calculated. Let me make sure I'm not misreading the options.

Wait, the options are for the last character. The options list them, but I'm just confirming the amounts.

Wait, but let me look at other options. Option B says 5,600 and 4,000. Wait, 5600+4000=9600, but according to my calculation, it's 5440 and 4160. So that's not correct.

Option C: 7200 and 2400. 7200+2400=9600. But 7200 is 8500's share. Wait, no, because the investment is 8500, so 7200 is more than that. So that's impossible.

Option D: 5200 and 4400. 5200+4400=9600. Again, 5200 is less than 5440, so no.

Option E: 4160 and 5440. Wait, but that would mean King gets more than I thought. So which is correct?

Wait, no, because according to the ratio, the larger investment, Evans, should get a larger share. So 5440 is more than 4160. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait! Wait a second. The options may have swapped the amounts. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option E: "E: Both... share equal." That can't be right because the investments are unequal. So E is incorrect.

Option H: "Evans 5000, King 4600." Sum is 9600. 5000 +4600=9600. But according to the calculation, it's 5440 and 4160. So H is not correct.

Option I: Both get equal shares, which is only if the investments are equal, which they are not.

Option J: 6500 and 3100. 6500 +3100=9600. But that's not correct because 6500 is more than 5440.

So the only option that matches my calculation is option A: 5440 and 4160.

The profits are divided according to the initial investments of the partners, which are $8,500 and $6,500. The total investment is $15,000, and the profit-sharing ratio simplifies to 17:13. The total profit is $9,600, which is divided into 30 parts, each worth $320. Thus, Evans receives 17 parts × $320 = $5,440, and King receives 13 parts × $320 = $4,160.
