Question:

A purchaser signed an agreement of sale to buy real estate. It had a contingency clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?

Options:

A: Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.
B: Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval  the first notice communicated is the effective one.
C: No, because the seller did not give the purchaser an opportunity to correct his mistake.
D: No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.
E: Yes, because the purchaser did not formally submit a mortgage application, violating the agreement.
F: No, because the approval of the belated application should allow the transaction to proceed.
G: Yes, because the purchaser did not fulfill the conditions of the contingency clause in the specified time.
H: No, because the amount of time that he was late was a "de minimus" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.
I: No, because the purchaser's discussion with a mortgage broker should be considered as an attempt to apply.
J: Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time.

Okay, so I've got this real estate contract question here. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit new to property law, but I'll give it a shot.

The scenario is a purchaser who signed a sale agreement to buy real estate. There's a contingency clause that says the purchaser has to make a completed mortgage application within a specified time. The time was of the essence. So, the purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a broker friend for his opinion. The seller told the purchaser she rescinded because no mortgage was approved. Then the purchaser made a late application and was granted approval, but the seller still rescinded.

The question is whether the seller will likely prevail in rescinding the transaction.

Looking at the options, I need to think about the rules about contingency clauses and rescission.

First, I remember that a contingency clause in a contract gives the party whose option it is to act (the one making the option) the right to proceed unless the condition is met. So, if the condition isn't met, the option holder can choose not to proceed. But if the condition is met, they have to go through the process.

In this case, the purchaser failed to make the timely application. They asked a broker friend for his opinion. The seller said she rescinded because no mortgage was approved.

Now, the purchaser later made a late application and was approved, but the seller still rescinded.

Wait, so the seller rescinded because the mortgage application was not approved? But the original agreement had a contingency clause that required the purchaser to make the application within the time. So, if the purchaser fails to make the application, but the seller didn't rescind, the purchaser might have an option to proceed, but only if he fully complies.

But the seller's action was to rescind because she didn't approve a mortgage within the time. Then the purchaser made a late application and was granted approval, but the seller still rescinded. That's confusing.

Wait, so the initial requirement was a completion within a time. So, if the purchaser failed to apply, but the seller didn't rescind, the purchaser would have an option to proceed. But in this case, the seller did rescind even though the purchaser later made a late application and got approved.

Wait, but the seller's statement about rescinding because of the late application is separate from the original agreement's time. The original time was of the essence. So, the original agreement required the purchaser to make the application within a certain time. If the purchaser failed to do that, but the seller rescinded because of no approval, maybe the purchaser could have a right to proceed because they failed to make the required action, but the seller's rescinding was based on the lack of a mortgage, which was an action taken by the broker friend, not by the purchaser.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think about the contract's terms again.

Contingency clause: purchaser must make a completed mortgage application within a specified time. If they fail, the seller can rescind because no mortgage was approved (the seller's rescission). Then the purchaser made a late application but got approved. But the seller still rescinded.

Wait, so the initial agreement said he must make it within time; if he didn't, the seller would have to rescind. But the purchaser didn't make it, so the seller rescided. Then the purchaser made a late one and got approved, but the seller still rescided.

So, in that case, the seller's decision to rescind (because she couldn't find a mortgage) was based on the original condition. The original condition says the purchaser must make it within the time. If he fails, the seller rescind's based on the failure to make the required action.

But the purchaser failed to make the required action, so the seller rescived. Then the purchaser made a late, but the seller's action was based on a different matter.

Wait, but the seller's action was to rescind because of the failure of the mortgage application. The purchaser failed to apply, but she didn't rescind because he failed to apply. So, the seller's rescission was proper.

Wait, but the initial requirement was of the time. So, the purchaser failed to apply, which was the first step of the contingency clause. The seller says she rescinding because no mortgage was approved in time. So, if he had failed to apply (the first step), the seller would have rescided regardless of any later actions, but in this case, the seller still rescided.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

The situation is: purchaser didn't apply, then asked friend. Seller said she rescived because no mortgage was approved. Then purchaser made a late application and got approved, but seller still rescived.

So, the initial requirement was that the purchaser must make the application within the time. If he fails, the seller rescinds because she couldn't find a mortgage. So, the seller's action was to rescind because it was her responsibility to find a suitable mortgage within the time.

But the purchaser failed to apply, so the seller's rescission is based on that. But the purchaser then made a late application and was approved, but the seller still rescided. So, the seller's decision to rescind was based on the first requirement.

Wait, but the seller's action was not based on the late application but the failure of the initial application. So, perhaps the seller's decision was correct, and the purchaser didn't have any rights because the initial requirement was a contingency.

But the problem is that the purchaser failed to apply, but the seller didn't rescind because the failure was the first step, but the seller's decision was based on her own lack of success in finding a mortgage, not the purchaser's failure to apply.

Wait, but in real estate, the seller's right to rescind is to rescind because of the initial action (like a mortgage) being denied. The contingency clause is that the option holder must complete the action (in this case, the mortgage) within the time. If they fail, the option holder can choose not to proceed, and the seller has the right to rescind because of the failure of the option holder's action.

So, in this case, the purchaser failed to apply. The seller's action is based on her own inability to find a suitable mortgage. So, perhaps the seller's resciding is in error because she didn't have the option to rescind for the purchaser's failure. Wait, no, the seller's action to rescind was because the purchaser's application was not approved. So, the seller's decision to rescind was in response to the initial failure of the option holder's action, which was the first step of the contingency clause.

So, in that case, the seller's resciding is correct, as she rescided because of the failure to apply the first step.

But then the purchaser later made a late application and was approved. But the seller still rescided. So, the question is whether the seller would prevail in rescinding.

But the seller's resciding was based on the initial failure of the option holder (the purchaser), not the later late application.

So, the question is, can the seller rescind because of the failure of the option holder's action (the mortgage application), regardless of the later late application?

I think yes. Because the seller's action to rescind is based on the initial failure of the option holder's action (the mortgage application). The subsequent late application was a separate matter and not directly addressed by the seller's action.

So, the answer would be that the seller has a right to rescind because of the initial failure.

Wait, looking at the options. Option E is "Yes, because the purchaser did not formally submit a mortgage application, violating the agreement." But that's talking about failing to submit. But the initial action was the mortgage application, which the purchaser failed to do.

Option J is "Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time." Wait, but that's not correct, because the seller's right to rescind is only if the option holder fails to fulfill the condition. The seller's action was not rescinding for the failure to make the initial application, but for the lack of a mortgage approval. So, the seller's resciding was based on the first step of the option, not the later step.

Wait, but the seller's action was based on the initial failure to make the mortgage, which was the first step. So, the seller's resciding was for the first step, not for the later one. So, the answer should be based on whether the seller's resciding was correct.

Wait, but some sources say that the seller's right to rescind is based on the first step of the option. So, if the option holder fails to make the first step, the seller can rescind.

So, the purchaser failed to make the first step (submit a mortgage). The seller's action to rescind was in response to that failure. So, the seller's resciding is valid, and the purchaser's failure is a breach of the option.

So, the seller can rescind because she rescived based on the first step of the option.

So, the correct answer is E: Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time. Wait, but that can't be right because the seller's action was not resciding for the late application but for the initial failure.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the time aspect. The initial agreement's time is of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply, but the seller's action was based on the lack of a mortgage approval. So, the seller's resciding is based on the initial failure, not the later late application.

So, the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The seller's action to rescind was because she couldn't find a mortgage within the agreed time. So, that's a later action, but the seller's right to rescind is for the initial failure of the option holder (the mortgage application). So, the seller's resciding is valid because she rescided based on the initial failure.

Thus, the correct answer is E: Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time.

Wait, but that would be if the seller's action was to rescind for the initial failure. But she rescided for the lack of a mortgage, not the failure to make the first step.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the seller can rescind only because the option holder failed to make the first step of the contingency clause. In that case, the purchaser's failure to make the first step is the basis, and the seller's resciding is correct.

So, the correct answer would be E: Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the seller's action was based on the initial failure, not the later step.

Alternatively, perhaps the seller didn't have the right to rescind based on the later step. The seller's action was incorrect, but in the scenario, the seller did rescind, so perhaps the court would allow it.

Alternatively, perhaps the original requirement of the time was of the essence, so the purchaser failed to make it. The seller's rescission was for the initial failure, and the later late application was a separate issue.

So, the seller's resciding was because the initial failure of the option holder (the mortgage application) caused her to rescind. The later late application didn't affect that.

Thus, the answer would be E: Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time.

Alternatively, another option is B. Let me think about what B says. B says yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to the purchaser's notifying her of the approval. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the scenario says the seller told the purchaser she rescived, because she didn't approve the mortgage. The purchaser then made a late application, was approved, but the seller still rescived.

So, the seller's resciding was based on the initial failure, not the late application.

Wait, perhaps the court would allow the seller to rescind because the initial failure of the option holder caused the seller to do so. So, the correct answer is E.

But I'm a bit confused because the seller's action was based on a later issue, but the court would likely allow the seller's resciding based on the initial failure.

Wait, another angle: the contingency clause says the purchaser must make the mortgage application within the time. If they fail, the seller can rescind. So, the seller's action to rescind was because the first step was failed. Regardless of the later mistake, the seller's resciding was valid.

So, the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around whether the seller will prevail in rescinding the transaction under a contingency clause that requires the purchaser to make a mortgage application within a specified time. The key points are as follows:

1. **Contingency Clause**: The purchaser must make a completed mortgage application within the agreed time. If they fail, the seller has the right to rescind the sale because no mortgage was approved.

2. **Purchaser's Failure**: The purchaser failed to apply but asked a broker friend for his opinion. The seller, however, did not rescind because she failed to approve the mortgage, which was the first step under the contingency clause.

3. **Purchaser's Late Application**: The purchaser later made a late application and was granted approval, but the seller still rescived the transaction.

The seller's action to rescind was based on the initial failure of the purchaser's application, which was the first step of the contingency clause. The subsequent late application did not affect the seller's right to rescind, as the seller's action was valid for the initial failure.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option E**: "Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time."  
  This is correct because the seller's action to rescind was valid for the initial failure of the purchaser's application, which was the basis of the contingency clause.

- **Other Options**:  
  - **A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I**: These options involve nuances about the timing or the basis of the seller's rescission, which are either incorrectly applied or irrelevant to the facts.
