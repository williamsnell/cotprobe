Okay, so I need to figure out the role of factor analysis in describing intelligence. Hmm. I remember factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability in data in terms of fewer underlying factors. Wait, but how does that apply to intelligence?

So, intelligence is usually measured by various tests like IQ tests, which have multiple subscales. Maybe factor analysis is used to see if these subscales are measuring the same underlying constructs. Like, if you have different tests for memory, reasoning, etc., factor analysis might identify if these are all part of a single factor, like general intelligence.

Looking at the options, option G says it's used to identify underlying intellectual traits and establish descriptive categories. That makes sense because factor analysis groups variables into factors, so it would help categorize different aspects of intelligence. Like, if you have several intelligence tests, factor analysis might show that they're all part of a single factor, which is general intelligence. So then, the descriptive categories would be things like 'high-ability general intelligence' or 'low-ability reasoning'.

Option B talks about fixed levels, which doesn't sound right. Factor analysis doesn't fit that, because it's more about variability and grouping rather than fixed categories.

Option D and I mention genetic basis. I'm not sure if factor analysis is about genetics or just about general intelligibility. I think it's more about the structure, not the cause.

Option F seems to be about creating programs, but I don't know if that's the main role. Also, it doesn't directly tie into the method I'm thinking.

Option E says it's used to measure IQ directly. No, because IQ is a composite of multiple subscales, and factor analysis breaks them down into factors.

Option C says it's irrelevant. No, I think it's definitely used in some way.

So, putting it all together, factor analysis helps describe intelligence by identifying underlying factors or traits. It's used to determine what aspects of intelligence are being measured and how they relate. So the correct answer would be G.

The correct answer is G: Factor analysis is used to identify underlying intellectual traits and establish descriptive categories in intelligence.
