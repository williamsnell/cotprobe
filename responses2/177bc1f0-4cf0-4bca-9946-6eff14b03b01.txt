Okay, so I've got this question about hormones and where they're secreted. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that hormones are made in the endocrine system. They're secreted from glands in the skin or internal organs. So each gland makes its own hormone.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Secreted into tissues surrounding the glands. That makes sense because the hormones are made in the gland and then transported away. So the tissues would be the surrounding areas, like maybe the skin or other organs.

Option B: Secreted into the stomach. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. The hormones are made in the gland and secreted, not into the stomach. The stomach is part of the digestive system, so maybe another system handles that.

Option C: Secreted into the brain. Hmm, the brain is a part of the central nervous system, but I don't recall hormones being secreted there. They're in the endocrine system, secreted from glands, not the brain.

Option D: Secreted into the ovaries and testes. No, that's incorrect. The ovaries and testes are where eggs are laid, not where hormones are secreted. They're endocrine glands elsewhere.

Option E: Secreted into the hair follicles and travel along hair shafts. That seems off. Hair follicles are in the skin, but the hormones are secreted from the skin, right? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think: Actually, hormones are secreted from the skin glands in the outer layers, and travel through the hair shafts to the hair follicles. But I'm not sure if that's how it works. Or maybe the question is mixing up endocrine and exocrine hormones. Exocrine hormones go directly into the tissues, while endocrine go to the skin and then into the hair follicles. So E might be mixing those, which could be a confusion.

Option F: Secreted into the skin and absorbed through pores. That sounds more like exocrine hormones. For example, some hormones go into the skin and are then absorbed through skin cells. But wait, that's not how hormones generally work. The endocrine system doesn't have exocrine; hormones are endocrine. So F might be incorrect.

Option G: Secreted into the air and inhaled by the individual. That's definitely not right. The secreted hormones are not in the air; they're in the tissues. Inhaling would be the process of getting them into the lungs, but not their secretion.

Option H: Secreted directly into the bloodstream. No, that's not right. The bloodstream carries enzymes and hormones, but they're not directly secreted. Like, they can be absorbed by the skin or other tissues.

Option I: Secreted into the saliva and are swallowed and digested. That's incorrect because those are exocrine hormones, like saliva production in the mouth. The hormones secreted are in the endocrine system, not the exocrine.

Option J: Secreted into the lymphatic system. I remember that the lymphatic system is part of the immune system. But the endocrine system's hormones are secreted into the skin and not into the lymphatic system. So J is probably wrong.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake with option E. Let me reconsider. Exocrine hormones are secreted directly into the tissues, like the skin, and then by some cells (like skin cells) get into the bloodstream. But endocrine hormones are secreted from the skin into the bloodstream. So if the question is about the location of secretion, E is talking about endocrine into hair shafts, which I think is incorrect. Because endocrine hormones are secreted from the skin into the skin and then into the bloodstream. So E is wrong.

Going back to option A: Secreted into the tissues surrounding the glands. That makes sense because the glands produce hormones that go into the surrounding tissues. Like, for example, the liver produces hormones that go into the tissues around it, like the liver itself (wait, no, the liver would've been the gland). Wait, the liver is a gland, so the surrounding tissues would be maybe the liver's own surrounding areas, but perhaps that's not the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A. Because the hormones are secreted from the glands into the surrounding tissues, which are far away. So the location is A. So the correct answer is A.

The correct answer is **A: into the tissues surrounding the glands where they were manufactured**. 

Hormones are secreted from glands in the skin or internal organs and transported into the surrounding tissues, which are far from the glands. This ensures that the hormones are distributed to their respective tissues and function appropriately.
