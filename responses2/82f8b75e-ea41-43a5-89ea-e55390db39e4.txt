Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about mixing ice and a drink to reach a specific temperature. Hmm, I remember that when you mix substances, especially when dealing with heat transfer, you need to consider the heat gained and heat lost. Oh right, the concept is that the heat lost by the warmer substances equals the heat gained by the cooler ones, assuming no heat is lost to the environment.

So, the setup is: we have a glass containing 0.25 kg of Omni-Cola, which is mostly water. Its initial temperature is 25°C. We need to add some ice at -20°C, and the final temperature should be 0°C with all the ice melted. The goal is to find how much ice (in grams) we need to add. Also, the glass's heat capacity is neglected, so we can ignore that.

Let me jot down the known values:

- Mass of water in the glass (M_water) = 0.25 kg = 250 grams.
- Initial temperature of water (T_water_initial) = 25°C.
- Initial temperature of ice (T_ice_initial) = -20°C.
- Final temperature (T_final) = 0°C.
- Specific heat of water (c_water) = 4.18 J/g°C (I think that's right).
- Specific heat of ice (c_ice) = 2.09 J/g°C (I've heard these values before).
- Heat of fusion (L_fusion) = 334 J/g. Oh wait, that's the heat needed to melt ice without changing its temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. When ice is at 0°C, it's melting. So the heat required to melt the ice is the latent heat. So the process is: ice at -20°C → ice at 0°C → water at 0°C. Hmm, but wait, no—because the water in the glass is at 25°C, so all the ice will first warm up to 0°C, and then the water from the glass will cool down to 0°C, while the ice melts. 

Wait, no, I think I have it backwards. Oh, right, the ice is initially at -20°C. So the ice will first warm up from -20 to 0°C. The water in the glass will then cool from 25 to 0°C. But wait, when the ice warms up, it absorbs heat, and when the water cools, it releases heat. Also, the ice will absorb the heat to melt, which requires the latent heat.

So the heat lost by the warm water (the glass) is equal to the heat gained by the ice in three stages: warming up, melting, and then cooling? Wait, no, because the final temperature is 0°C, so after the ice melts, the water from the glass cools down to 0°C. Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering the heat transfer in two parts: the ice warming up and the ice melting, and the water cooling.

Wait, wait, let me think again.

The ice (at -20°C) will first warm up to 0°C, absorbing heat. Then, it will melt into water, which requires heat (the latent heat). Then, the resulting water (melted ice) will cool down from 0°C to 0°C (so no change in temperature for them). Meanwhile, the water in the glass will cool from 25°C to 0°C, releasing heat.

Wait, but the glass is at 25°C, so if the ice is added, the glass's water will lose heat, causing the temperature to drop. The ice will absorb heat from the glass, causing it to warm up, and the ice will then melt, which requires heat.

So, the heat lost by the warm water (glass) is equal to the heat gained by the ice in three steps: warming, melting, and cooling.

Wait, but when the ice is at 0°C, it's melting, so after melting, the water doesn't change in temperature. So the ice will first warm up from -20 to 0, then melt, and then any cooling? Wait no, the final temp is 0, so the ice would have melted, but the water in the glass would cool from 25 to 0.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as:

Heat gained by ice ( warming and melting) = Heat lost by water.

Let me write down the equations.

Heat gained by ice:

Q_ice = m_ice * [c_ice * (T_final - T_initial_ice) + L_fusion ]

Because the ice warms up and melts.

Heat lost by water:

Q_water = M_water * c_water * (T_initial_water - T_final)

Because the water cools down.

Since Q_ice = Q_water (heat lost equals heat gained), so:

m_ice * [c_ice * (0 - (-20)) + L_fusion ] = 0.25 kg * 4.18 J/g°C * (25 - 0)

Wait, but wait, m_ice is in grams. Let me convert 0.25 kg to grams: 250 grams.

So,

m_ice * [2.09 J/g°C * 20°C + 334 J/g ] = 250 g * 4.18 J/g°C * 25°C

Let me compute the right-hand side first.

Right-hand side: 250 g * 4.18 J/g°C *25°C.

250 *4.18 = 1045 J/°C. Then multiply by 25: 1045 *25 = 26,125 J.

So, m_ice * [ (2.09 *20) +334 ] = 26,125 J.

Compute the term inside the brackets:

2.09 *20 = 41.8 J/g. Then 41.8 + 334 = 375.8 J/g.

So,

m_ice * 375.8 = 26,125

Therefore, m_ice = 26125 / 375.8.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 375.8 * 70 = 26306 (approx). Hmm, 375.8 * 70 = 3758 *70 = (3758 *7)*10= 26,306. But our numerator is 26,125, which is a bit less.

So 26125 / 375.8.

Let me compute:

375.8 × 70 = 26,306. Our numerator is 26,125. So 70 is a bit too high.

Alternatively, 375.8 × 69 = ?

375.8 *70 is 26,306; subtract 375.8 gives 26,306 -375.8 = 25,930.2. Hmm, but our numerator is 26,125 which is higher than 25,930.2, so 69 would leave 26,125 -25,930.2 = 194.8.

So 375.8 * 0.5 ≈ 187.9. So 69.5 would be 26,130 (approx). But 69.5 *375.8 = 26,130. So the actual value is about 70 grams, since 69.5 gives close to 26,130, which is just a bit higher than 26,125.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

So 26,125 ÷ 375.8 = ?

Let me compute 375.8 × 69.5.

375.8 *69 = 26,130.2, as above. So 69.5 would be 26,130.2 + (0.5 *375.8) = 26,130.2 + 187.9 = 26,318.1. That's higher than 26,125.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute 26125 ÷ 375.8.

Well, 375.8 × 69 = 375.8 * 70 = 26,306, minus 375.8 → 26,306 - 375.8= 25,930.2.

Hmm, but the numerator is 26,125, which is between 25,930.2 (69) and 26,306 (70). So:

69: 25,930.2 → 26,125 −25,930.2 = 194.8 left.

How much more in 69.5? Let's see, 375.8 * 0.5 = 187.9. So adding 0.5 gives 69.5, which is 69.5; but 69.5 would leave 194.8 - 187.9 = 6.9 grams.

Wait, but 375.8 * 0.017 ≈ 6.38 (since 375.8 *0.01 =3.758, *0.007=2.6306 → sum 6.388).

So, 69.5 + 0.017 ≈ 69.517. So the exact value is approximately 69.517 grams. So about 69.5 grams. Since the options are in whole numbers, we'd round to the nearest whole number. Looking at options, 70 is an option (option C), or 60 (option G). Hmm, but 69.5 is closer to 70.

Wait, but wait again. Because earlier, I thought that the ice is at -20, so it has to warm up to 0, which is 20 degrees. So the calculation is correct.

But let me check the computations again, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, m_ice * [ (2.09 *20) +334 ] = 26,125.

2.09 *20 =41.8 → 41.8 + 334= 375.8. So m_ice=26,125 /375.8 ≈69.5.

So yes, about 70 grams. Looking at the options, option C is 70. But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A:120

B:50

C:70

D:80

E:110

F:90

G:40

H:60

I:30

J:100

So the correct answer is C:70.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait! The glass is mostly water. Wait, the problem says 0.25 kg of water, so M_water=0.25 kg. So when the ice is added, the water in the glass is 0.25 kg, and the ice is another m_ice grams. So when the ice is added, the heat from the glass is transferred to the ice and the resulting water.

Wait, but perhaps I missed something about the heat transfer. Because the glass is not just the water. Oh wait, no, the problem says the glass is 0.25 kg of water. So the glass's mass is 0.25 kg, and the ice is m_ice grams. So when ice is added, the ice is at -20, and the glass is 0.25 kg (250 grams) of water at 25°C. So all the ice will warm up to 0°C, melt, and the resulting water (m_ice grams) at 0°C will cool down to 0°C (no change). Wait, but the glass's water is also cooling to 0°C. So the heat lost by the glass is m_glass * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_glass) = 0.25 kg *4.18*(25 -0) = 0.25 *4.18 *25= 25.9 N? Wait, 0.25 *4.18 is 1.045, times 25 is 26.125.

The heat gained by the ice is m_ice [ c_ice*(0 - (-20)) + L ] → m_ice*(20 *2.09 +334) = m_ice*(41.8 +334)=475.8 m_ice.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 20 *2.09 is 41.8, plus 334 is 375.8.

So, 475.8 * m_ice = 26.125.

Wait, but 475.8 * m_ice = 26.125 → m_ice = 26.125 /475.8 ≈ 0.055 kg, which is 55 grams. But that can't be right because 55 is not an option. So there's a mistake here.

Wait, wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Oh, wait, perhaps I forgot that the glass is 0.25 kg (250g) and the ice is m_ice grams. So when the ice comes into thermal equilibrium, the water from the glass and the ice's heat transfer happens.

Wait, but wait, the glass's water is 250 g, and the ice is m_ice grams. So the total heat lost by the glass and the ice is the same.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of all the heat transfer. The ice gains heat to reach 0°C, melt, and then the resulting water (from melted ice) cools down to 0°C (so no temperature change, so no heat loss there). Meanwhile, the glass's water cools from 25°C to 0°C. So the heat lost by the glass is equal to the heat gained by the ice.

Ah, but wait, the ice's heat is split into three parts. But perhaps I made a mistake in the setup earlier. Let me re-examine the initial equation.

Wait, the correct equation should be:

Heat gained by ice: Q_ice = m_ice * [c_ice * (0 - (-20)) + L_fusion ]

Heat lost by glass: Q_glass = M_water * c_water * (25 - 0 )

Since Q_ice = Q_glass,

m_ice * [ c_ice*(20) + L_fusion ] = M_water * c_water *25

So, m_ice * (2.09 *20 + 334) = 0.25 kg * 4.18 *25

Compute the RHS: 0.25 *4.18=1.045 → 1.045 *25=26.125 J.

2.09 *20=41.8 → 41.8 +334 = 375.8.

So,

m_ice = 26.125 /375.8 → 26.125 / 375.8 ≈ 0.0696 kg → 69.6 grams.

Wait, that's about 70 grams. So the correct answer is 70 grams, which is option C.

But earlier, when I considered the ice as 55 grams, I must have included the glass's mass in the ice's heat equation, which is incorrect. Oops, I think I made a mistake in the setup earlier. The ice's mass is m_ice grams, and the glass's mass is 250 grams. So the equation should treat both masses, not just the ice.

So the correct equation is:

Heat gained by ice is m_ice * [c_ice*(20) + L_fusion ].

Heat lost by water is 0.25 kg * c_water *25.

So the calculation is correct, leading to approximately 70 grams, so option C.
</think>

To determine how much ice, initially at -20°C, must be added to 0.25 kg (250 g) of Omni-Cola (mostly water) at 25°C to achieve a final temperature of 0°C with all the ice melted, we analyze the heat transfer between the ice and the water in the glass. The heat lost by the warm water equals the heat gained by the ice, as the system is thermally insulated.

### Key Given Data:
- **Mass of water in the glass (M_water)** = 0.25 kg = 250 g
- **Initial temperature of water (T_water_initial)** = 25°C
- **Initial temperature of ice (T_ice_initial)** = -20°C
- **Final temperature (T_final)** = 0°C
- **Specific heat of water (c_water)** = 4.18 J/g°C
- **Specific heat of ice (c_ice)** = 2.09 J/g°C
- **Latent heat of fusion (L_fusion)** = 334 J/g

### Heat Transfer Analysis:
1. **Heat gained by the ice**:
   - The ice first warms up from -20°C to 0°C, absorbing heat:  
     \[
     Q_{\text{ice, warm}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot c_{\text{ice}} \cdot (0 - (-20)) = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot 2.09 \cdot 20
     \]
   - Then, the ice melts into water, absorbing heat:  
     \[
     Q_{\text{ice, melt}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L_{\text{fusion}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot 334
     \]
   - Total heat gained by the ice:  
     \[
     Q_{\text{ice total}} = Q_{\text{ice, warm}} + Q_{\text{ice, melt}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot (2.09 \cdot 20 + 334)
     \]

2. **Heat lost by the water**:
   - The water cools from 25°C to 0°C:  
     \[
     Q_{\text{water}} = M_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (25 - 0) = 250 \cdot 4.18 \cdot 25
     \]

3. **Equating heat lost and heat gained**:
   \[
   m_{\text{ice}} \cdot (2.09 \cdot 20 + 334) = 250 \cdot 4.18 \cdot 25
   \]

4. **Compute the terms**:
   - \(2.09 \cdot 20 = 41.8\)
   - \(41.8 + 334 = 375.8\)
   - \(250 \cdot 4.18 \cdot 25 = 26,125\)

5. **Solve for \(m_{\text{ice}}\)**:
   \[
   m_{\text{ice}} = \frac{26,125}{375.8} \approx 70 \, \text{grams}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The mass of ice required is approximately **70 grams**, which corresponds to option **C**.
