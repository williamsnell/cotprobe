Question:

An avowed member of an antigovernment organization was elected president of a union. A senator, in his investigation of infiltration by antigovernment organizations of national labor unions, found a provision in a law passed by Congress that makes it a crime for a member of an antigovernment organization to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the president is dismissed from his position by the executive committee of the union. During a legislative hearing, the senator made derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization. In determining whether the president has a valid cause of action against the senator for defamation, which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of law?

Options:

A: The president of a union cannot sue for defamation based on statements made during a legislative hearing.
B: Public figures must prove that false and defamatory statements were made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth.
C: Truth is an absolute defense to a defamation claim.
D: A senator cannot be held accountable for statements made during an investigation, regardless of their truth or falsity.
E: Congressional committees do not have the authority to violate a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
F: It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.
G: The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.
H: The president must prove that the senator's statements were made with the intent to cause harm.
I: A senator's statements during a legislative hearing are protected by legislative immunity.
J: A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it carefully again. 

The question is about defamation cases, specifically involving a union member dismissed from their job because they were involved in antigovernment organizations. The key point here is the statements made by the president during a legislative hearing.

The options are A through J. I need to pick the correct one. Let's break it down.

First, the scenario: The president was elected as an antiquity of the government union. He was part of the union. Then, a senator found him involved in an antigovernment organization and did some derogatory statements about his involvement. The senator's statements were made during a legislative hearing. The question is whether the president can sue the senator for defamation.

I remember the concept of "legislative immunity." From what I recall, this is a rule that says a person's statements made during a legislative session can't be used to challenge someone else's legislative actions. So, if the president has been involved in legislative activities, like serving in a congressional committee or something, his statements during that hearing can't be used to prove someone else is liable for their statements.

Looking at the options, option I says a senator's statements during a legislative hearing are protected by legislative immunity. That sounds right. But wait, is it always the case? I think the key here is that the statements made during the hearing by the party's member should be protected. But the option says the senator's statements, not the union member's, are protected.

Wait, but the question is about the president's cause of action against the senator. So the president's statements during the hearing against the senator would be against the senator's statements. But the president's statements during the hearing are protected by legislative immunity. So that would mean the senator's statements cannot be used to challenge the president's statements. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me think again. The defense of legislative immunity applies to the party member's statements. So the president's statements made during the hearing are protected. That means the senator's statements, made against him, can't use the president's statements against him. So the president's defense is that his statements are protected, so the senator can't sue him for defamation.

So the answer would be option I. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the specifics. Let me recall the exact rules. The legislative immunity rule states that a member of a political party's legislative body cannot be used to prove the truth of a legislative act. So if the president is part of a legislative body, his statements made during a legislative hearing are protected. Therefore, the statements made by someone else (the senator) can't be used to challenge the president's statements. So the president can sue the senator for defamation because his statements are protected.

So the correct answer would be option I: A senator's statements during a legislative hearing are protected by legislative immunity.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is about the statements made during a hearing by the party member. So the president's statements are protected, so the senator can't use that to defend himself. So the president can sue the senator for defamation because his statements are protected, meaning the statements made by the senator can't be used to prove the president is liable. So yes, option I is correct.

The correct answer is:

**I: A senator's statements during a legislative hearing are protected by legislative immunity.**

**Explanation:** The president's statements made during a legislative hearing are protected by the legislative immunity rule of law, which applies to a member of a political party's legislative body. This protection means that the statements of the president made during the hearing are not subject to the same scrutiny as the statements of an external party member, such as the senator. Therefore, the senator cannot use the president's statements made during the hearing to challenge his defamation claims. The president can assert his case against the senator because his statements are protected under this rule.
