Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Under the name of Chartist well-meaning inconsiderate men and other misled men have in very many cases, all over the country from the extreme west to the extreme east and from Brighton in the south to nearly the extreme north of Scotland, denounced every man who is not a working man, applied to him, the grossest epithets and most atrocious intentions and conduct, have threatened them with vengeance and in some places, have proposed plans for the seizure and division of their property—numbers of misled men and others of bad character, under the self-denomination of Chartists have gone from place to place and in the most violent manner disturbed and dispersed meetings of various kinds. Your Committee object to the words Household Suffrage since under any honest definition of the words—they would exclude a large majority of the men of these kingdoms—and because they have become reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the primary goal of the Chartist movement based on the given excerpt. Let me start by reading the question again. The options are various forms of suffrage, some related to social reforms. 

The excerpt talks about a group called Chartists who object to the words "household suffrage." The author of the letter, Francis Place, mentions that these words exclude a large majority of men and are obnoxious to the working class. Because of that, they get involved in violent means like seizing and dividing property and disrupting meetings. 

Wait, what's the connection between household suffrage and the movement? I remember that suffrage was a political term referring to giving all men the right to vote. But in the context of the movement, the issue is about the words being offensive. So, if the movement is against "household suffrage," it's likely that their primary goal is to abolish it. Because they don't like the word, which implies they don't want it to be a thing. 

Looking back at the options, option H is "Establishment of a socialist state." That sounds more about a broader social and economic change, not just about voting rights. Alternatively, option G is "Abolition of child labor," which is a different issue. Option B is about wealth distribution, so that's not it either. 

So, the Chartist movement's primary goal is to abolish the terms of servitude, like child labor. That makes sense because their objection to the words "household suffrage" might hint at their focus on social rights and equality. They wanted to ensure that men had the right to engage in productive labor and that child labor wasn't a problem. 

Wait, but another thought: the term "household suffrage" is a political concept where all men have the right to vote. But in this case, the movement is against the use of a word, not a political structure. So their main goal isn't about voting rights but about abolishing some form of social control. 

Alternatively, maybe their primary goal is to abolish child labor, which is a direct social issue. But I'm not entirely certain. I think the best fit here is option G, Abolition of child labor. Because the word "household suffrage" suggests they don't want the political structure under consideration, which might be about the rights of the working class. So, if their primary goal is to abolish child labor, that's the focus. 

Wait, another angle: the passage says that Chartists object to "household suffrage" because it excludes a large majority of men and is obnoxious. So their main goal isn't about voting, but about the term itself being offensive. That makes me think they're restricting the use of the word, not about political rights. So their goal is more about whether the word is used correctly, not about what rights are granted. 

Alternatively, the movement's goal might align with their concern for social justice and equality. So perhaps their main goal is to prevent child labor, as that's a part of social inequality. But I'm not entirely sure. 

I think I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to break it down. The movement is looking to abolish the use of the word "household suffrage," which in political terms means all men have the right to vote. They don't like that word because it's offensive and excludes many men. So their primary goal is to remove or limit the use of that term, or perhaps to prevent any use of it. So their main goal is not about the political rights of men, but about the terminology itself. That makes me think their goal is about social justice, like eliminating child labor, which is a social issue. 

Wait, but the options don't include "消除childlabor." The closest is option G, which says "Abolition of child labor." So perhaps their goal is to abolish child labor. Alternatively, H is about a socialist state, which is a different issue. So, based on that, the primary goal is G: Abolition of child labor.

The primary goal of the Chartist movement, as reflected in the excerpt, is to abolish the use of the term "household suffrage," which excludes many men. This implies a broader focus on social and political justice. The movement's main concern is likely to eliminate child labor, as it is a significant social issue.
