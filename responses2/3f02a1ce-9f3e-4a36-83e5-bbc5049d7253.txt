Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the force constant of HCl using the Morse potential's Maclaurin expansion. Hmm, I remember that the Morse potential is an approximation for diatomic molecules, and its expansion around x=0 is given in the question. Let me think through what I know.

The Morse potential formula is V(x) = D * (1 - e^(-βx)^2) - D. Expanding this, the x² term must correspond to the force constant. Wait, the expansion is given as V(x) = D β² x² + ... So the coefficient of x² gives the potential energy's curvature, which relates to the force constant.

Oh wait, I think the force constant k is actually 2D β². Because when you expand e^(-βx) around x=0, the first few terms are 1 - βx + (β² x²)/2! - ... So e^(-βx) ≈ 1 - βx + (β² x²)/2. Squared, that would be [1 - βx + (β² x²)/2]^2. Expanding that: 1 - 2βx + (β^2 x^2 + β^2 x^2) + higher terms. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me recall the expansion of e^(-βx) up to x².

So e^(-βx) = 1 - βx + (β² x²)/2. Then, (e^(-βx))² = (1 - βx + (β² x²)/2)^2. Let's compute that. Multiply it out:

1^2 = 1.

The cross terms: 2*(1)*(-βx) = -2βx.

The cross terms: 2*(1)*(β² x²/2) = β² x².

The (βx)^2: β² x².

So combining, (e^(-βx))² = 1 - 2βx + (β² x² + β² x²) = 1 - 2βx + 2 β² x².

So the Morse potential is V(x) = D (1 - e^(-βx)^2) - D. Wait, no. Original Morse potential is V(x)=D(1 - e^{-βx})² - D. Wait, no, the correct form is V(x) = D [1 - (e^{-βx})² ] - D. Oh but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me double-check.

Wait, the Morse potential is usually written as V(x) = D [1 - e^{-β(x - r0)}]^2 - D. Oh, but in this case, the expansion is around x=0, which would imply that the equilibrium position is x=0, but that's not the case for HCl. Wait, no, the question says the expansion is around x=0, but if x is the displacement, perhaps it's not the same as the equilibrium position. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The expansion given in the problem is V(x) = Dβ² x² + ... So the coefficient of x² is D β². But in the expansion of the potential, the coefficient of x^2 would relate to the second derivative of V with respect to x, divided by 2, because the Hooke's law force is -dV/dx, and the second derivative is k.

Wait, wait, the second derivative of V with respect to x would give us 2k when evaluated at equilibrium (since V = (1/2) k x² in Hooke's law). So from the expansion, V(x) = D β² x² + ... So the coefficient of x^2 is D β^2. The second derivative of V with respect to x at x=0 (equilibrium) would be the coefficient, because V(x) ≈ (1/2) k x², so the coefficient is k/2. Wait, no, because the expansion is V(x) ≈ (1/2) k x², so the coefficient is k/2. So in our case, the coefficient is D β², which equals (k/2). So solving for k, we get k = 2 D β².

But wait, wait a second. The given Morse potential's expansion is V(x)=D β² x² + ... So the coefficient of x² is D β². In the expansion, the potential is V(x) = (1/2) k x² + ... So D β² = (1/2) k. Therefore, k = 2 D β².

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the coefficient was k/2. So that would mean the coefficient in the expansion is (k/2). So in this problem, D β^2 = k/2, so k = 2 D β^2.

But let me recheck this. Let me write the expansion properly. Let's take e^{-βx} ≈ 1 - βx + (β^2 x^2)/2. Then (e^{-βx})^2 = 1 - 2β x + (β² x²)(1 + 1) + higher terms. So (e^{-βx})^2 ≈ 1 - 2β x + (β² x²)(1 + 1) = 1 - 2 beta x + beta² x² * 2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2. So if a is 1, and b is βx, then (e^{-βx})^2 = 1 - 2 (βx) + (βx)^2.

So (e^{-βx})^2 = 1 - 2 β x + β² x².

So the Morse potential is V(x) = D [1 - (e^{-βx})² ] - D.

Wait, no, the Morse potential is V(x) = D [1 - (e^{-βx})^2 ] - D. Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me correctly write the Morse potential formula.

Wait, the Morse potential is actually V(x) = D [1 - e^{-β(x - r0)}]^2 - D, where r0 is the equilibrium bond length. But in our problem, the expansion is given as V(x) = D beta squared x squared plus higher order terms. So perhaps the expansion is done around the equilibrium position, which is x=0. But that's only possible if the equilibrium position is at x=0, which might not be the case for HCl. Wait, but the question says that the expansion was done, so x represents the displacement from the equilibrium position. So for HCl, the equilibrium position is at x=0, which would imply that the potential is expanded around x=0, but that's only possible if x is zero, which isn't the case. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering x as the displacement from the equilibrium position, which is zero. So the expansion would be around x=0.

But regardless, the given expansion is V(x) = D beta^2 x^2 + ..., so the coefficient of x^2 is D beta^2. Since in the potential, the x^2 term comes from (1/2) k x^2, so D beta^2 = (k/2), meaning k = 2 D beta^2.

So now, plugging in the given values: D is 7.31e-19 J·molecule⁻¹, and beta is 1.81e10 m⁻¹.

So let's compute k = 2 * D * beta^2.

First, compute beta squared: (1.81e10 m⁻¹)^2 = (1.81)^2 * (1e10)^2 = approx 3.2761 * 1e20 → 3.2761e20 m^-2.

Now multiply by D: 7.31e-19 J·molecule⁻¹ * 3.2761e20 m^-2. Let's compute 7.31e-19 * 3.2761e20 = 7.31 *3.2761 * 1e1.

Wait, 7.31 *3.2761 is approximately, let's see, 7 *3 =21, 7 *0.2761≈1.933, 0.31 *3≈0.93, 0.31 *0.2761≈0.0856. So adding up:

7 *3.2761 =23.3327, 0.31 *3.2761≈1.0156.

Adding 23.3327 +1.0156=24.3483. But wait, that's not correct. Wait, 7.31 *3.2761 = let me do it accurately.

7 *3.2761 = 23.3327.

0.31 *3.2761 = let me compute 0.3*3.2761=0.98283, 0.01 *3.2761=0.032761. Sum is 0.98283+0.032761=1.015591.

Adding to 23.3327, we get 24.348291.

So 7.31e-19 *3.2761e20 = 24.348291e1 → since 1e-19 *1e20 is 1e1. 24.348291e1 is 243.48291.

Now multiply by 2 (because k=2 D beta^2): 243.48291 *2= 486.96582.

So k=487 J·m^{-1}.

Wait, wait, but the given options don't have 487. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 350
B:450
C:490
D:520
E:392
F:600
G:650
H:530
I:479
J:560.

Hmm, none of them is 487. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me recheck the numbers. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, D is 7.31e-19 J·molecule⁻¹, and beta is 1.81e10 m⁻¹.

Compute beta squared: (1.81e10)^2 = (1.81)^2 * 1e20 = 3.2761e20 m^-2.

Multiply D * beta^2: 7.31e-19 J·m^-1 * 3.2761e20 m^-2. Let's compute the exponents: 1e-19 *1e20 =1e1.

So 7.31 *3.2761 = let me compute accurately. 

7 *3 =21.

7 *0.2761=1.9327.

0.31 *3=0.93.

0.31 *0.2761=0.085591.

Adding all: 21 +1.9327=22.9327, +0.93=23.8627, +0.085591≈23.9483.

Multiply by 1e1 (10): 23.9483 *10=239.483.

Now multiply by 2 (since k=2 D beta^2): 239.483 *2=478.966≈479.

Ah! So the calculation comes to approximately 479 N·m⁻¹.

Looking at the options, option I is 479. So the answer should be I.

To calculate the force constant \( k \) of HCl using the given Morse potential expansion, we start with the relationship between the second derivative of the potential energy \( V(x) \) and the force constant. The Morse potential is given as:

\[
V(x) = D \beta^2 x^2 + \cdots
\]

Here, \( D = 7.31 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{molecule}^{-1} \) and \( \beta = 1.81 \times 10^{10} \, \text{m}^{-1} \). The coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the expansion, \( D \beta^2 \), corresponds to the curvature of the potential, which relates to the force constant \( k \) via:

\[
k = 2D \beta^2
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \beta^2 \)
\[
\beta^2 = (1.81 \times 10^{10})^2 = (1.81)^2 \times (10^{10})^2 = 3.2761 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m}^{-2}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( D \beta^2 \)
\[
D \beta^2 = (7.31 \times 10^{-19}) \times (3.2761 \times 10^{20}) = 7.31 \times 3.2761 \times 10^{-19+20}
\]
\[
7.31 \times 3.2761 \approx 24.3483, \quad \text{and} \quad 10^{-19+20} = 10^1
\]
\[
D \beta^2 = 24.3483 \times 10^1 = 243.483 \, \text{J} \cdot \text{molecule}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^{-2}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( k = 2D \beta^2 \)
\[
k = 2 \times 243.483 = 486.966 \, \text{J} \cdot \text{molecule}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^{-2}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated value of \( k \) is approximately \( 487 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} \). Among the given options, the closest match is **I: 479 N·m⁻¹**.
