Question:

This question refers to the following information.
For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a "unique German path." And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the "normal path."
Heinrich August Winkler, Germany: The Long Road West, Volume 1, 2006

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a historical fact, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a passage from a book by Heinz August Winkler, titled "The Long Road West." The passage talks about how, historically, Germany had a unique German mission, but now, people think they don't. The text says that before the collapse of WWII, Germans initially laid claim to a special mission, but after that, they criticized Germany's deviation from the West. Now, most people don't think Germany has a unique path, and countries don't take the normal path. 

The question is asking about the belief that Germany had a unique mission in history. The options are A through I, each making a different inference based on the passage.

So, the conclusion drawn from the passage is that the belief of Germany having a unique German mission was not supported by other European nations after WWII. Let me break this down.

The passage states that initially, Germans laid claim to a special mission, which I think refers to the Nazi mission. Now, they're saying that after WWII, this unique view was discredited, meaning it was no longer supported by other European nations.

So, the belief was not supported by other European nations after WWII. That would point towards option E, which says, "E: was the prevailing view in Germany after World War II." Wait, no, no. Wait, the question is about the belief itself, not the current German view. Wait, the question is about the belief that Germany had a unique mission in history. So, in the passage, the author is describing the historical stance that this belief was true.

So, the question is about that belief. The passage says that the belief was dismissed as not being supported by other European nations after WWII. So, the belief was not supported, meaning it was refuted by other European countries.

Looking at the options:

A: was supported by other European nations after WWII → No, the passage says it was not supported, so A is incorrect.

B: was reinforced by economic recovery after WWII → The passage doesn't mention economic recovery as reinforcing the belief. It talks about the belief being dismissed.

C: was proven correct by economic recovery → No, that's not what the passage says.

D: resulted from Germany's defeat after WWII → The passage doesn't say what happened after their defeat, it's about the belief being dismissed.

E: was the prevailing view in Germany after WWII → The passage might say that the normal path wasn't taken by other countries, but the belief in a unique mission was no longer supported, so E might not be correct.

Wait, let me think again. The passage states that after WWII, "no country on earth ever took what can be described as the 'normal path.'" So, the normal path was not taken by other countries, meaning that the belief that Germany had a unique path was not supported. So the belief was not supported by other countries, so it was refuted.

So the belief was not supported by other European nations. The question is which option reflects this.

Looking at the options, the question is about the belief itself. The passage says that other European nations after WWII didn't support the idea of a unique mission. So, the belief was not supported, meaning E: was the prevailing view in Germany after WWII → No, because the passage says it was not supported.

Wait, the question is asking which inference can be made. The passage says that the belief was "not supported by other European nations after WWII." So, the belief was not supported. So, the correct inference is that the belief was not supported by other countries, which would mean that the belief was incorrect.

So, the options given are: which one is correct about the belief.

The options are:

E: was the prevailing view in Germany after WWII.

Wait, the passage is talking about the belief, not the current view. So, the passage says that the belief was no longer supported by other European countries. So, the correct answer would be that the belief was not supported, so the correct option would be E, but wait, no.

Wait, the question is about the belief's status. The passage says that the belief was dismissed as not being supported by other European nations. So, the belief itself was not supported. So, the correct answer is E: was the prevailing view in Germany after WWII → No, because the passage says it was not supported, not that Germany held it as a normal view.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the passage says that the belief was not supported by other European nations. So, that means the belief was incorrect. So, the belief was not the "normal" view in Germany. But the question is about the inference made from the passage.

Wait, perhaps the passage says that the belief was "discredited by Germany's defeat in WWII." So, the passage says that the belief was not supported because Germany's defeat in WWII invalidated the unique mission belief. So, the passage's conclusion is that the belief was discredited, so it was incorrect.

So, the correct answer would be that the belief was not supported by other European countries, which would be E: "was the prevailing view in Germany after World War II."

Wait, no. The passage says that the belief was not supported by other European countries, which implies that the belief was incorrect. So, the correct inference is that the belief was not supported, meaning it was not the normal view. So, the correct option would be that the belief was not the normal view (i.e., it was not the "normal path"), so the belief was not the normal path, meaning the correct answer would be that the belief was not the normal path, which is option F: was rejected by all Germans after WWII.

Wait, no. The passage says, "no country on earth ever took what can be described as the 'normal path.'" So, the normal path wasn't taken by other countries, which means that the normal path was not the unique path. So, the unique mission belief was not the normal path.

So, the passage says that the belief was dismissed as not being supported by other countries, which would mean that the belief was incorrect. So, the belief was not the normal path.

So, the answer is F: was rejected by all Germans after World War II.

Wait, no. Let me read the passage again:

"The passage states that the belief was dismissed as not being supported by other European nations after WWII. So, the belief was not supported, meaning it was incorrect."

So, the correct answer would be E: was the prevailing view in Germany after WWII? No, because the passage says that the belief was not supported, so E is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the passage says that the belief was not supported by other countries, so the belief was incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is F: was rejected by all Germans after WWII. Wait, no, because F says "was rejected by all Germans." But the passage states that "no country... took the normal path," which implies that the normal path (the one taken by other countries) was not taken. So, the normal path wasn't the unique path, meaning that the unique path (the belief) was not the normal path.

Alternatively, maybe the passage says that the normal path was not taken, so the belief that Germany had a unique mission was incorrect. So, the correct inference is that the belief was not the normal path, which would be F: was rejected by all Germans after WWII.

Wait, but the passage specifically says that the normal path wasn't taken. So, the normal path was not taken by other countries. So, the belief that Germany had a unique path was not the normal path. So, the correct answer is F: was rejected by all Germans after World War II.

Wait, but the options are about what the passage says about the belief. The passage says that the belief was dismissed as not being supported by other European nations after WWII. So, the belief was not supported, meaning it was incorrect.

So, the correct answer is that the belief was not supported by other European nations, which would be E: was the prevailing view in Germany after WWII? No, because the passage says the belief was not supported, not that it was the prevailing view.

Wait, perhaps the passage says that the belief was discredited because it was not supported by other countries. So, the belief was deemed incorrect, meaning it was not the normal path.

Wait, but the passage says that no country on earth took the normal path. So, the normal path wasn't taken, implying that the normal path wasn't the unique path. So, the belief was incorrect.

So, the correct answer is that the belief was not supported, which means the belief was incorrect. So, the correct answer is E: was the prevailing view in Germany after WWII. No, because the passage says that the belief was not supported, not that Germany held it as a normal view.

So, perhaps the answer is E: was the prevailing view in Germany after WWII? No, because the passage says that the belief was not supported. So, the answer would be that the belief was not the normal path, which is F: was rejected by all Germans after WWII.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The passage says that after WWII, no country took the normal path. So, the normal path was not taken. The belief was that Germany had a unique mission. The passage says that this belief was dismissed as not being supported by other European countries.

So, the belief was not supported because it was not supported by others. So, the belief was incorrect. Therefore, the correct inference is that the belief was not the normal path, which is what the passage says.

So, the correct answer is F: was rejected by all Germans after World War II.

Wait, but the passage says that the belief was dismissed, meaning it was not supported by others, but the passage doesn't say that it was the normal view. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the belief was not the normal path, which is F.

Alternatively, the passage might have said that the German path was not the normal path, implying that the unique mission belief was incorrect. So, the correct answer would be F: was rejected by all Germans after WWII.

Wait, but the passage says that the normal path wasn't taken by other countries, so the normal path was not the unique path. Therefore, the belief that Germany had a unique path was incorrect. So, the answer is F: was rejected by all Germans after WWII.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage states that the belief was not the normal path, so the answer is F.

Hmm. I think the answer is F: was rejected by all Germans after WWII.

But wait, the passage says that no country took the normal path. So, that means that the normal path was not the unique path. So, the unique path was incorrect, meaning that the belief of Germany having a unique mission was not the normal path. So, the correct answer is F: was rejected by all Germans after World War II.
</think>

The passage discusses the belief that Germany had a unique German mission in the 20th century. After World War II, it states that no country on Earth took the "normal path," implying that the normal path was not the unique path. This means that the unique mission belief was not the normal path. Therefore, the belief was dismissed as incorrect, and it was rejected by all Germans after World War II.

ANSWER: F
