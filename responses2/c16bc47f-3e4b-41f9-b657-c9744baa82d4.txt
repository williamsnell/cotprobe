Question:

Dr. Ramchandran found that his patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20 the number of cavities in their teeth as those who didn't. After interviewing the dentist, a local newswriter reports that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities. Based on the dentist's research, which of the following statements is true?

Options:

A: The writer's statement would be justified if at least half of the patients brushed their teeth after lunch.
B: If a minimum of 200 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
C: No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.
D: The writer's statement would only be justified if no patients brushed their teeth after lunch.
E: The writer's statement could only be justified if the study was conducted over a prolonged period of time.
F: At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.
G: If all the patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
I: If only the patients who brushed their teeth after lunch were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
J: If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

Okay, so I've got this question here about Dr. Ramchandran and his patients' teeth brushing habits and their cavity counts. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20 the number of cavities compared to those who didn't. Then a newswriter reports that brushing after lunch prevents cavities. The question is asking which statement about this scenario is true, based on the dentist's research.

The options are A through J, each making a different claim. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I think I should understand the scenario. So, the data shows that those who brush after lunch have fewer cavities. Specifically, 1/20th as many. That's a pretty significant difference. So, brushing after lunch seems to help reduce cavities.

Now, looking at the statements, each option is a possible justification for the writer's statement. The options are about the number of patients studied and the necessity of brushing after lunch.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The writer's statement would be justified if at least half of the patients brushed their teeth after lunch.
Hmm. If half of the patients did, that's a 50% increase. But the data is a 1/20 difference. So, 50% vs 5%â€”that's a big difference supporting the claim. But why would half of them justify it? Maybe because that's a more significant number, but I'm not sure if that's the only reason. The statement isn't necessarily justifying it, just that it's a possibility. So, I'm not sure if this is the correct reasoning.

Option B: If a minimum of 200 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
Wait, 200 is a specific number. But the data shows a 5% reduction, which is a 20% reduction in cavities. 200 patients isn't directly linked to the 1/20 ratio. So, perhaps the 200 is a way to reach a statistical significance. Like, if you have enough data, the results are more trustworthy. But the statement doesn't explain why 200 is needed. So, I'm not sure. The writer's report is that after lunch brushing reduces cavity count. So, if you have a sample size of 200, the results are more likely to be accurate. But does that make the writer's statement justified? Maybe, because larger samples are more reliable. But I'm not certain if this is a valid reasoning.

Option C: No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.
Wait, that can't be right. If you have a large enough sample, you can see a trend. But the current data is that 1/20, which suggests a strong effect. So, more participants might support the claim, but maybe the effect is still there. So, this statement might not be correct because it's possible that even with a smaller sample, the conclusion holds.

Option D: The writer's statement would only be justified if no patients brushed after lunch.
That doesn't make sense. If some did brush, the data would show a reduction. So, the statement that it's only justified if no one did is wrong. The opposite is true.

Option E: The writer's statement could only be justified if the study was conducted over a prolonged period of time.
Hmm. Prolonged periods might let people brush more. But the data is about after lunch. I don't think the duration of the study would affect the effect directly. Unless the effect is more pronounced during certain times, but the question says patients who brushed after lunch had fewer cavities. So, the study duration might not be the reason. So, E is probably not correct.

Option F: At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.
100 is half of 200, but the data doesn't rely on 100. It's 1/20, which is 5%. So, 100 is more than enough. 5% of 200 is 10. 5% of 500 is 25. So, 100 patients would give 5% as well. But the data is 1/20, so 100 patients would support that. But the writer's statement is that brushing after lunch reduces cavities. So, perhaps the writer's statement is justified if there are enough patients. But the statement isn't explaining why 100 is enough. So, F is a possible reasoning, but I'm not sure if it's the correct justification.

Option G: If all the patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
If all were studied, then the findings would probably be definitive. But the statement is about the writer's report being justified. That is, whether the data is reliable. If all patients were studied, the conclusion is that brushing after lunch reduces cavities. But the writer's report is just a finding. So, the statement is saying that the statement (the claim) is justified. So, if all patients were studied, and the data shows a 1/20 difference, that would support the claim. So, perhaps G is correct. But I'm not sure if this is the best reasoning.

Option H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
Wait, 100 patients would give a 5% reduction, which is a 20% reduction. So, 100 is enough. But is 100 enough for the writer's statement to be justified? The writer's statement claims that brushing after lunch prevents cavities. So, if the study is 100 patients, and 5% of them had more cavities, that's a 20% reduction. That's a strong effect. But does that make the writer's statement justified? It's possible that the writer's report is justified, but the option is suggesting it's justified only if 100 are studied. But other numbers would also support it. So, H isn't necessarily correct.

Option I: If only the patients who brushed their teeth after lunch were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
Wait, if the study only includes those who brush after lunch, then the results would be conclusive. Because they could compare their own data. So, for example, say 100 patients brush after lunch, and after a year, the number of cavities is less. So, the statement is justified. So, statement I is correct. Because if the study includes only those who brush after lunch, then the conclusion is certain. But the question is, does the statement "if only the patients who brushed their teeth after lunch were studied, the writer's statement is justified" mean that the writer's statement is justified only in that scenario. Or does it mean that the study is only looking at that group, thus making the conclusion certain.

Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The statement is: "If only the patients who brushed their teeth after lunch were studied, the writer's statement is justified." So, if that's the case, the statement is that the writer's statement is justified because the study includes only the group that did brush after lunch. So, that study would show a reduction in cavities, making the writer's claim valid. So, the writer's statement would be justified in that case. So, statement I is a true scenario under which the writer's statement is justified. But the way the options are phrased, the statement is a condition, not a conclusion. So, the options are about whether the writer's statement is justified based on certain conditions.

So, the options are about the validity of the writer's statement. The writer's statement is that brushing after lunch prevents cavities. The research shows that those who brush after lunch have fewer cavities. But the writer's statement is probably being justified based on the data.

So, which of these options is correct as a reason why the writer's statement is justified.

Option J: If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
Wait, 500 is 20% of 2500, but in the data, it's 1/20. So, 2500 would give 125. 500 gives 5. So, 5 is a 10% reduction. The statement says 1/20, which is 5%. So, 500 patients would show a 10% reduction, which is higher than the 5% in the data. So, 500 would support the writer's claim. So, statement J is correct because 500 would support the claim. But the writer's statement is that brushing after lunch prevents cavities. So, if you have 500, that's 1/20 reduction, which the data shows. So, the writer's statement is justified based on that.

Wait, but the options are about the reasoning, not about the number. So, the question is, which statement is true about the writer's report.

Looking back, the correct reasoning is that if the study includes enough participants (like 200, 500, etc.), the conclusion that brushing after lunch prevents cavities holds. But the options are about the justification of the writer's statement, which is that the data shows that brushing after lunch reduces cavity counts.

So, which of the statements is a valid reason for the writer's statement being justified?

Option J says that if 500 were studied, the writer's statement is justified. But that's an example, not a justification. The writer's report is that 1/20. So, 500 would have 2500/20 = 125, so 125-500= the number of cavities. Wait, no, the data is that 1/20. So, it's a 5% reduction, so 500 would have 5% fewer. So, that's a 1/20 ratio.

So, the writer's statement is correct. So, the reasoning is that if the study is large enough, the data supports the claim. Therefore, the writer's statement is justified because the data shows a reduction in cavities. So, the option that indicates that the writer's statement is justified is when the study is large enough.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option J says that if a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified. But the writer's statement is that brushing after lunch prevents cavities, and the data shows a 1/20 reduction. So, 500 would have a 5% reduction, which is a 1/20. So, it's exactly what the data shows. So, the writer's statement is justified if the study is 500 or larger, but the option J says '500' is sufficient. So, the reasoning is that the writer's statement is correct because 500 patients would support it.

Wait, but the question is about the writer's statement being justified, not the number needed. So, the option that says that the writer's statement is justified if the study is large enough would be correct.

Looking at the options, the correct reasoning is that a larger sample size supports the conclusion. So, the correct reasoning is that the writer's statement is justified if the study is large enough. But which option reflects that?

Looking back, I think the correct reasoning is that the statement is justified if the sample size is large enough. So, which option is about that?

Option H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

Wait, 100 patients would give 5% reduction. So, that's 1/20. So, 100 is enough to show the 1/20 difference. So, the writer's statement is justified with a sample size of 100. So, the statement H is correct because 100 would support the writer's claim.

But the question is about which statement is true.

The options are asking which statement is true as a reason for the writer's statement being justified.

Wait, the question is: "Based on the dentist's research, which of the following statements is true?"

So, the dentist's research shows that those who brush after lunch have fewer cavities (1/20). So, the statement is that brushing after lunch prevents cavities.

Now, the options are about the validity of this statement. So, which of the options is a correct reasoning.

Option H: "If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified." Well, 100 would give 5% reduction, which is a 1/20. So, that supports the writer's claim. So, if 100 patients were studied, the study would support the writer's statement. So, the writer's statement is justified if that's the case.

Similarly, option G: "If all patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified." That's also true, but perhaps the options are looking for the minimal number.

The question is which statement is true. So, the correct reasoning would be that if enough patients are studied (like 100 or more), the statement holds.

So, looking back, the correct reasoning is that the statement is justified if the sample size is adequate. So, among the options:

Option H: 100 is sufficient. So, the statement is justified if >=100.

Option G: All patients are studied, which is a way to confirm it. But the writer's statement is probably being justified based on the data.

So, which option is correct?

The options are:

H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

G: If all patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

Which is the correct reasoning.

The writer's statement is that brushing after lunch prevents cavities, based on the data that those who brush after lunch have 1/20 the number of cavities. So, if the study is large enough (like 100 or more), the data supports that. So, the writer's statement is justified because the sample size is sufficient.

But the question is about which statement is true.

Wait, the options are about whether the writer's statement is justified based on the number of patients, etc.

So, which option says that the statement is justified if the sample size is large enough.

Looking at the options, which ones are about the number of patients:

Option H: If at least 100, justified. So, 100 is enough.

Option G: If all, justified. So, all is needed, which is a strong statement.

But the question is, based on the dentist's research, which statement is true.

The dentist's research is that those who brush after lunch have fewer cavities. So, the statement is that this practice prevents cavities.

The question is about the validity of the statement.

So, the correct reasoning is that the statement is true because the study has a sufficient number of participants, which would show a 1/20 reduction. So, the correct answer would be that the writer's statement is justified if the study is large enough, which is option H or option G.

But looking at the options, the options are:

Option H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

Option G: If all patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

So, the correct reasoning is that a study of 100 patients would support the writer's claim, so the writer's statement is justified. So, option H is correct.

But wait, the options are about the reasoning. So, the statement is correct if the number is sufficient.

Wait, but the options are about the reasoning itself. The question is, which of the following statements is true as a reason supporting the writer's statement.

So, for example, option H is saying that if you have 100, the writer's statement is justified. So, it's correct because 100 is enough.

Alternatively, option G is saying that if all are studied, the writer's statement is justified. So, that's also correct because in that case, all patients would have their data included, showing the 1/20 reduction. So, the writer's statement holds.

But the question is which statement is true. So, both H and G are correct in their reasoning.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option H.

Wait, no, the correct reasoning is that the statement is justified with a certain number of participants. So, the correct option is H.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question is, based on the dentist's research, which of the following statements is true. So, the dentist's research shows that the number of cavities is lower for those who brush after lunch. The statement is that this prevents cavities. So, which of these options correctly explains why the statement is justified.

The correct reasoning is that a sufficient number of participants (like 100) would show the 1/20 reduction, making the writer's statement valid. So, the correct answer would be option H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

But another angle: the study's results. If the study is based on 100 patients, the data shows a 1/20 difference, which supports the writer's claim. So, the writer's statement is justified if the study is large enough. Hence, option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, which says that if all patients were studied, then the statement is justified. So, that's a way to confirm the conclusion. But the question is about the reasoning for the writer's statement.

Wait, the correct reasoning is that the statement is justified because the study is large enough. So, option H is correct.

The correct reasoning is that the writer's statement is justified because the study is large enough.
