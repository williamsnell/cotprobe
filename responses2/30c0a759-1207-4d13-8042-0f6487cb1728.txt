Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shipping company that charges based on the weight of packages. The question is asking which set of data is the best to test a program that calculates shipping charges. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand how the shipping charges are structured. From the problem statement, the charges are tiered in specific weight ranges:

- For weights between 0 and 2 pounds (not including 2), the charge is $4.00.
- For weights between 2 and 5 pounds (not including 5), the charge jumps to $8.00.
- For weights between 5 and 20 pounds (not including 20), the rate increases to $15.00.
- And the company doesn't accept packages over 20 pounds, so anything above 20 is off-limits.

The company doesn't accept packages that weigh more than 20 pounds. So any weight over 20 is not allowed.

Now, the question is about testing a program that calculates shipping charges. The options given are various sets of weights, and I need to choose the one that represents the best data to test the program. The best data probably includes all the possible weight ranges to cover all possible charges.

Let me look at each option:

Option A: 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21.
Hmm. This includes weights from 0 up to 21, but 21 is beyond the company's maximum allowed. So including 21 in the test data might not be necessary because the company won't accept packages beyond 20. But perhaps including 21 could test how the program handles an invalid input, but it's not necessary for testing the charge calculation.

Option B: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20.
This includes the boundaries of each tier. It starts just above 2 (2), then 4 (which is between 2 and 5), and so on, up to 20. This seems comprehensive because it covers all the weight ranges. But wait, let me check the exact ranges. The first tier is 0 < w ≤2, the second is 2 < w ≤5, and the third is 5 <w ≤20. So the boundaries are important. So this includes all the starting points: 2,5,20. But what about the other possible points? For example, weight 2 is the upper limit of the first tier and the lower limit of the second tier. But in the list, 2 is included. So maybe it's okay. But wait, the second tier starts at 2< w, so 2 itself is not included. Hmm, but the options list B includes 2 as a weight. So the program would have to account for whether the weight is inclusive of the boundaries. For example, if a package is exactly 2 pounds, it's in the second tier. So in option B, the list contains 2, which is the boundary. But according to the charging rules, 2 is included in the second tier.

Wait, let me think again. The first tier is 0 < w ≤2. That includes any weight greater than 0 and up to and including 2. So any w where 0 < w ≤2 is $4.00. So if w is exactly 2, it's in the second tier. So the list B includes 2, which is the upper limit of the first tier, and the lower limit of the second tier. So including 2 is correct because packages exactly at 2 are in the second tier, which has a higher charge.

But wait, the second tier is 2 < w ≤5. So w>2 and <=5. So 2 is not included in the second tier. So if a package is exactly 2 pounds, it's in the second tier, right? But in the problem statement, the second tier is 2 < w ≤5, which doesn't include 2. So any package at exactly 2 pounds would be in the second tier. So the list B includes 2, which is the correct upper limit for the first tier and lower limit for the second. So that's correct.

Option B includes all the boundaries for each tier. So this should be a good test case.

Option C: -1,1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,20.
This includes some negative weights (which are invalid, but perhaps the program should handle that). Then it includes 1,3,5 up to 20. So the program should test lower values, but the company doesn't accept anything over 20. So this includes a lot of the possible weights, but perhaps more than necessary. Because the first tier is 0 < w ≤2, but if a package is 1, it's in the first tier. So the program should test 1, 2, and others.

Wait, but the first tier is 0 < w ≤2. So 1 is in the first tier, 2 is in the second, and 3 is in the third.

But option C includes 1,3,5, etc., which are in the second and third tiers. Including 20 is correct because it's the boundary of the third tier.

But the program needs to test all possible weights. So if the program includes lower numbers, like 1, it's necessary. So option C includes 1, but perhaps we can test that in another way. But I'm not sure if it's necessary.

Option D: −1,0,1,2,3,5,16,20,22.
This includes negative weights (which are invalid), zero, 1,2,3,5,16,20,22. 22 is over 20, so the company won't accept that. So the program would need to handle negative weights and 22, but the company doesn't accept packages beyond 20. So this option includes a lot of test cases, but perhaps some are outside the company's acceptable range. However, it's possible that the program might also need to test for legitimate weights beyond 20. But the question is about the best set to test the program. So perhaps it's including more than necessary, but perhaps not all.

Option E: −1,1,2,3,5,16,20.
This includes negative, 1,2,3,5,16,20. So 1 is in the first tier, 2 is in the second, 3 in the third, etc. 16 is in the third tier (5 < w ≤20). 20 is the upper limit. But what about 4? The program may not test 4, so perhaps the test case is missing some weights. So if a package is 4 pounds, it's in the third tier, but the program doesn't have a test for that. So this could be a problem because the program might not handle it correctly.

Option F: 0, 2,5,20.
This includes the lower bounds of each tier, but not all the possible weights. Like, 0 is in the first tier, 2 is the boundary (but not included in the second tier as per the problem statement). Wait, no. The second tier is 2 < w ≤5. So w=2 is not in the second tier. So it's included in the first tier. So 2 is in the first tier, but the second tier starts at w>2. So 2 is a boundary between the two tiers. But in the given set F, 2 is included. So the program should handle the transition correctly.

But F doesn't include numbers between 5 and 20, like 10,15,16, etc. So if a package is 10 pounds, it's in the third tier, but F doesn't include 10. So the program may not correctly determine the charge for 10. So this is not comprehensive enough.

Option G: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.
This is a range from 1 to 10. But what about 0? The first tier is 0 < w ≤2, so 0 is a valid weight, but not included in any of the given options. But the question is about the best data to test the program. So perhaps 0 is needed if the program includes it. However, none of the other options include 0, except option A, which includes 21, which is over 20. So in option G, 0 is not included. So if a package is 0 pounds, the program should handle that. But in this case, the given options don't include 0, except in option A which includes 21. So perhaps G is not comprehensive because it misses 0. But wait, the company doesn't accept packages that weigh more than 20, but 0 is a valid weight, so it's necessary to test.

Option H: 1,4,16.
These are the lower boundaries for each tier. So 1 is in the first tier, 4 is the lower limit of the second tier (which is 2 < w ≤5), and 16 is the lower limit of the third tier (5 < w ≤20). So this includes all the critical points. But what about 2,5, etc.? It's not included. So if a package is 2 pounds, the program should know it's in the second tier. But in option H, 2 is not included. So perhaps the program needs to test this case, but the given set H doesn't include it. Hence, H is not comprehensive enough.

Option I: -1,0,2,5,10,15,20,21.
This includes negative, 0, 2 (first tier), 5 (second), 10 (third), 15 (third), 20 (third). 21 is over 20. So this set includes the lower bounds of each tier, the upper limit of the third tier, and the boundary of the fourth tier. It's comprehensive, but perhaps includes some unnecessary cases, like -1 and 21. However, the company doesn't accept packages over 20, so 21 is invalid. But including it could test the program's handling of such inputs, but not all necessary cases.

Option J: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,20.
This includes 0, the lower bounds of each tier, and 20. But does it include the upper bounds of the first and second tiers? The first tier is 0 < w ≤2, so 2 is the upper limit. But is 2 included in J? Yes, 2 is there. The second tier is 2 < w ≤5, so the upper limit is 5. But it's not included in J. So J misses the 5 pound mark. So if a package is 5 pounds, the program should charge $15.00, but in J, 5 is not included. So this means that J isn't a complete test set.

Looking back at all options, the best data set is the one that includes all the weight boundaries for each tier. So the boundaries are 2,5,20.

Looking at each option:

Option B: includes 2,5,20. So it covers the transition between tiers.
Option I includes 0,2,5,10,15,20,21. It includes 0 (which is a valid weight), 2 (first tier),5,10,15,20. But wait, 2 is included, and 20 is the upper limit.

Wait, but the correct charges for the tiers are:

- 0 < w ≤2 → $4.00
- 2 < w ≤5 → $8.00
- 5 < w ≤20 → $15.00

So any w >= 2 but less than 5 is in the second tier, up to and including 5 is not. But 5 is the lower limit of the third tier. So the program should test the boundaries at 2,5,20.

So the set should include 2,5,20.

Looking at the options, option B includes 2,5,20. So it covers the necessary boundaries.

Option I includes 0,2,5,10,15,20,21. 0 is a valid weight, 2 is in the first tier, 5 is the lower limit of the second and upper limit of the third tier. So I includes all the necessary boundaries.

But perhaps the better option is B because it's more concise and covers the necessary ranges without including other numbers.

Wait, but what about 4 in option I? It's not included in I. So maybe the program should test any weight in between as well.

But the problem is about the best set of data to test a program that calculates the charges. So the best set should include all the weight ranges that the program needs to handle. That would include all the boundary points of each tier. So the boundaries are 2,5,20.

Looking at the options, which include 2,5,20? Let's see:

Option B: 2,5,20 → yes.

Option I: 2,5,20 → yes.

Which option is the best? Hmm, perhaps the program needs to test all the possible weight ranges, not just the boundaries. But considering that, option B is more concise. Because 2,5,20 are the critical points, and the other weights are within the correct tiers.

But in option B, it's a list that includes 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20. So each weight in this list is within the correct tier. So 2 is in the first tier, 4 is in the second, 6 is in the third, etc. So this set includes all the boundaries (2,5,20), but also includes 20, which is the upper limit. But 5 is not in option B, so if a package is 5 pounds, does it fall into the second tier or third?

Wait, according to the problem statement, the second tier is 2 < w <=5. So 5 is the upper limit. So a package weighing exactly 5 pounds is in the second tier.

Wait, wait, no. Because the second tier is 2 < w <=5. So 5 is included in the second tier. But the problem statement says the second tier is 2 < w ≤5, which includes 5. So 5 is in the second tier.

So in option B, all the weights are within their correct tiers. So the program can test any weight in that range without issues.

In contrast, option I includes 0,2,5,10,15,20,21. So 0 is a valid weight, 2 is the upper limit for the first tier, 5 is the lower limit of the second tier and the upper limit of the third tier, 10,15 are in the third tier, 20 is the upper limit of the third tier, and 21 is invalid.

So option B doesn't include 0, but includes 2,5,20. So the program can handle any weight in between.

But which is a better test set? It depends on what the program is supposed to test. But the question is about the best set to test a program that calculates the charges. So including all the necessary boundaries is better.

Wait, but I think all the necessary boundaries are 2,5,20. So any weight between 0 and 2 is in the first tier, 2 < w <=5 in second, and so on.

So the correct set should cover 0 < w <=2, 2 < w <=5, 5 <w <=20.

So option B includes 0,2,5,20, but also includes all the other weights in between. So perhaps it's the better option because it's comprehensive.

But wait, option I also includes 0 and 21. But 21 is beyond 20, which is invalid. But perhaps the program should handle such cases.

Looking again, the correct set should include all the weights that are possible. So 0 is valid. 2 is the upper limit of the first tier, and the lower limit of the second. 5 is the lower limit of the second tier and the upper limit of the third. 20 is the upper limit of the third.

So the best set includes all of these: 0,2,5,20.

Looking at the options, option B includes 2,5,20, but also includes 0,4,6, etc. So option B is a complete set of weights, but it's not the minimal set.

Option I includes 0,2,5,10,15,20,21. All of these are either in the correct tiers or are beyond the maximum allowed. So including 21 could test the program's handling of invalid inputs, but it's not necessary for the correct calculation.

So the best set would be the one that includes all the critical boundaries and covers all the valid weight ranges within those.

So option B: 0,2,5,20.

But wait, including 0 is not necessary for the correct calculation because any package between 0 (exclusive) and 2 is in the first tier. So 0 is a valid weight but is the lower boundary. It's not required to include it, but including it in the test set would make sense.

So, what's more comprehensive? Option B includes 0,2,5,20, which are all the critical points. So any weight in those ranges is correctly handled.

Alternatively, option I includes 0,2,5,10,15,20,21. So it's a complete set, but perhaps the 10,15,21 would not be necessary, but including them is better for thoroughness.

Which one is better? I think the correct answer is option B because it includes all the necessary boundaries, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the correct ranges are 0 < w ≤2, 2 < w ≤5, 5 <w ≤20. So any w in 0-2 is in first tier, 2-5 in second, 5-20 in third.

So the test should include all these ranges. So the test set should include:

- 0 (since it's a valid weight)
- 2 (the upper limit of first, lower limit of second)
- 5 (lower limit of second, upper limit of third)
- 20 (upper limit of third)

But wait, the third tier is 5 <w ≤20. So 5 is the lower limit, and 20 is the upper limit. So the test set must include 5 and 20.

So the best set is the one that includes 0,2,5,20. But looking at the options, option B includes 0,2,5,20. So that's correct.

Wait, but option I includes 0,2,5,10,15,20,21. So 0 and 2 are correct, 5 and 20 are correct. 10,15 are in the third tier. But 21 is not. So including 21 would test the program's handling of invalid inputs beyond the maximum allowed. But perhaps that's unnecessary.

So perhaps option B is better because it's more concise and includes all the necessary critical points.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again, I think option B is the correct one because it includes all the necessary boundaries. So the test set should include 0,2,5,20. So option B is correct.

The best set of data to test a program that calculates shipping charges based on the given rules is Option B: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. This set includes all the critical boundaries (0, 2, 5, 20) and covers all valid weight ranges within the correct tiers. It ensures that the program handles the boundaries correctly and comprehensively tests the range of possible weights.
