Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Calculate the work done a) at 25°C, b) at 100°C when 100 grams of nitrogen is expanded reversibly and isothermally to a pressure of 100 torr. The initial pressure is 760 torr. The options are from A to J, each giving a and b values in calories.

Hmm. I remember that when a gas expands reversibly and isothermally, the work done can be calculated using the formula w = -P_ext * ΔV. But wait, since it's expansion, the work done by the gas is positive, so maybe it's written as w = -P_ext * (V_initial - V_final), which would make it positive for expansion.

Wait another thing, I think for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal reversible expansion, the work done is given by nRT ln(P_initial / P_final). Because when the gas expands, it's pushing against a higher external pressure, so the work done by the gas is positive. So for expansion, the formula would be w = nRT ln(P_initial / P_final). But wait, no, wait. When the gas expands, the system does work on the surroundings, so the work is negative if considering work done by the system. Or wait, maybe I should clarify the sign convention.

Ah, right, the work done by the system is considered positive when the system expands. So the formula could be w = -P_ext * ΔV, but when using the integral form, it's w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). Wait, let me think again. For reversible expansion, the work done by the gas is w = -nRT ln(P_initial / P_final). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The formula for work done during an isothermal reversible expansion is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). Because as the gas expands, the external pressure decreases from P_initial to P_final. The formula for the work done by the system is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). Or wait, maybe it's positive when the system is expanding. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The general formula for work done during a reversible adiabatic process is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). But wait, that's for irreversible processes, isn't it? No, wait, no. For a reversible process, the formula is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial) when the system expands. Or wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about it again.

When a gas expands reversibly and isothermally, the pressure decreases from P_initial to P_final. So the work done by the gas is positive. The formula for work in a reversible process is w = -P_ext * ΔV. But in a reversible process, P_ext is equal to the gas pressure during the process. So, for each infinitesimal step, the work is dW = -P dV. Integrating from initial to final gives the total work.

Alternatively, for an ideal gas, the work done during isothermal reversible expansion is given by w = nRT ln(P_initial / P_final). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check.

Wait, for an isothermal reversible expansion, the work done by the gas is w = nRT ln(V_final / V_initial). Because volume increases, ln(Vf/Vi) is positive, so work is positive, which makes sense since the system is doing work on surroundings.

But for pressure, since PV = nRT, we can write V = nRT/(P). So V_initial = nRT/(P_initial), V_final = nRT/(P_final). So Vf/Vi = P_initial / P_final. So w = nRT ln(Vf / Vi) = nRT ln(P_initial / P_final).

So the work done by the system is positive, so if the question is about work done by the system, it's positive. But wait, the question says work done during expansion, so perhaps I'm thinking in the other direction. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the formula for the work done by the gas during expansion is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). Because if P_final is less than P_initial, ln(P_final / P_initial) is negative, so the negative makes it positive, which is correct for expansion.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). Because when the system expands, P decreases, so ln is negative. Multiplying by -nRT gives a positive value, which is the work done by the system.

Alternatively, another approach: the formula for work done for isothermal reversible expansion is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). So with that, I can plug in the numbers.

But let's get the numbers straight. The problem is about 100 grams of N2 gas. So n = mass / molar mass. Molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol. So n = 100g / 28g/mol = approx 3.5714 mol.

Initial pressure P_initial is 760 torr, final pressure P_final is 100 torr. The temperature is given as a) 25°C and b) 100°C. But wait, the formula uses absolute temperature, so I'll need to convert those to Kelvin.

25°C is 298.15 K. 100°C is 373.15 K.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula I'm using is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). So let me compute this for both parts a and b.

But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Because when the system expands against a lower external pressure, the work done is positive. So the formula, when using P_initial and P_final, should give the work done by the system. So for part a), 25°C (which is higher than 0, so 25°C is 298 K). Let's compute each part.

Compute part a) first.

n = 100g / 28 g/mol ≈ 3.5714 mol.

R is the gas constant. I think R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but wait, the problem uses calories. Oh, the options are in calories. Oh, right, so I need to be careful with that.

Wait, calories and J conversion. 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 J. But sometimes, in these problems, it's easier to use calories directly, especially when the answer choices are in calories.

So, let's proceed.

Compute for part a) 25°C (298.15 K) and P_initial = 760 torr, P_final = 100 torr.

w_a = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial)

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I have all the units right. So, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Alternatively, since the problem uses calories, perhaps I should use R in cal/mol·K.

Wait, R in cal/mol·K is 0.001986, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute everything in a single unit.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula in terms of RT ln (P_final / P_initial) would give negative values. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the sign.

Wait, let me make a table:

- n = 3.5714 mol
- R = 8.314 J/mol·K
- T1 = 298.15 K
- T2 = 373.15 K
- P_initial = 760 torr
- P_final = 100 torr

Compute for a) first.

Compute P_final / P_initial: 100 / 760 = approx 0.1315789.

ln(0.1315789) ≈ let's compute that. Hmm, ln(0.1315789) is approximately what? I remember that ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, ln(0.5)=≈-0.6931, ln(0.2)≈-1.6094, ln(0.1)≈-2.3026. So 0.131 is about ln(0.131). Let's compute:

Using a calculator, ln(0.1315789)= approximately -2.038.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

ln(0.1315789) = ?

Let me think, since e^-2 = approx 0.1353. So 0.1353 is e^-2. So 0.13157 is a bit lower, so the natural log would be a little higher than -2. Let's compute:

At x = -2: e^-2 ≈ 0.1353.

At x = -2.038, e^-2.038 is e^-2 * e^-0.038 ≈ 0.1353 * (1 - 0.038) ≈ 0.1353 * 0.962 ≈ 0.1297, which is a bit lower than 0.1315789.

Wait, I'm getting a bit messy. Maybe I should use the approximation or a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Wait, let's compute ln(0.1315789).

We can compute it by using the Taylor series, but maybe for this purpose, I'll just accept that ln(0.1315789) is approximately -2.038.

So, ln(0.1315789) ≈ -2.038.

So, then:

w_a = -nRT * (-2.038) = nRT * 2.038.

Wait, but wait, the formula is w = -nRT ln(P_initial / P_final) if the expansion is happening. No, wait, earlier I thought the formula was w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial), but if P_final < P_initial, ln is negative, so the -nRT * negative becomes positive, which is correct for expansion.

Wait, but let's go back: the formula is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial) when the system expands.

Wait, no, I think I got the signs mixed. Let me clarify:

The work done by the system during expansion is positive. The formula for work done by the system is w = -P_ext * ΔV. But in a reversible process, P_ext = P, so w = -nRT ln(Vf/Vi).

Since Vf = (nRT)/P_final, Vi = (nRT)/P_initial.

So Vf/Vi = P_initial / P_final.

Thus, w = -nRT ln( (P_initial) / (P_final) )

= nRT ln( (P_final) / (P_initial) )

Wait, because ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a).

So, for expansion, when P_final < P_initial, ln(P_final/P_initial) is negative, so the work done by the system is positive.

So, w = nRT ln(P_initial / P_final)

Wait, no, wait! Let me do it step by step.

Compute w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial) → because Vf/Vi = P_initial / P_final.

So,

w = -nRT ln( (P_final) / (P_initial) )

But if P_final < P_initial, then (P_final/P_initial) is less than 1, so ln is negative, and the negative in front makes it positive, which is correct for expansion.

Alternatively, another approach: for expansion, the system does work against the external pressure, so the work done by the system is positive.

So, the formula is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial) → because when you expand, the external pressure is less than the system pressure, so ln is negative, and the negative makes it positive.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck with another approach.

Let me think of the first law: ΔU = q + w. But since it's isothermal and reversible, q should be zero (because ΔH is zero?), wait, no, the first law for an isothermal process, when q is the heat exchanged, which for reversible expansion of ideal gas is q = nRT ln(P_initial / P_final), but considering that for expansion, the system does work.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me proceed with the calculation.

So for part a) 25°C (298 K):

n = 3.5714 mol.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

Compute ln(760 / 100) = ln(7.6).

7.6 is about e^2 ≈7.389. So ln(7.6) ≈2.029.

So, ln(7.6) ≈2.029.

So,

w_a = -nRT * ln(P_final/P_initial) → Wait, no, because earlier the formula is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial).

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me write the formula correctly.

The correct formula for work done by the system is:

w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial) 

But wait, no, earlier I thought that for expansion, the work is positive, so let me see. Suppose the system expands from P_initial to P_final (P_final < P_initial). Then, ln(P_final/P_initial) is negative. So, w = -nRT * (negative) → positive.

So, yes, the formula is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial).

Alternatively, another way to think about it: For expansion, the system does work, and since the external pressure is lower, the system's internal energy increases. But perhaps that's not important right now.

So, let's compute part a) numerically.

Compute for part a): 25°C → 298.15 K.

Compute ln(P_final / P_initial) = ln(100/760) = ln(0.1315789) ≈ -2.038.

So,

w_a = -nRT * (-2.038) = nRT * 2.038.

Wait, but wait, the formula is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial)

So, substituting, w_a = -nRT * (-2.038) = nRT * 2.038.

Wait, but no, P_final / P_initial is 0.1315789 → ln is -2.038, so w_a = -nRT * (-2.038) = nRT * 2.038.

So, n = 3.5714 mol, R=8.314 J/mol·K, T=298 K.

nRT = 3.5714 * 8.314 * 298.

Let me compute that.

First, compute 3.5714 * 8.314 = ?

3.5714 * 8 = 28.5712
3.5714 * 0.314 = approx 3.5714 *0.3=1.07142, 3.5714 *0.014≈0.050 → total ≈1.12142.

So, 28.5712 +1.12142 = approx 29.6926.

Then, 29.6926 * 298 = ?

Well, 30 * 300 =9000. But wait, 29.6926 * 300 is 8907.98, but we're at 298. So, 29.6926 * 298 = 29.6926 * (300-2) = 8907.98 - 59.3852 = 8848.5948 J.

So, w_a = 8848.5948 * 2.038? Wait, no, wait: wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, the formula is w_a = nRT * ln(P_final / P_initial) (since ln is negative, so -nRT * negative gives positive). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, earlier I thought the formula is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). So that's:

w_a = - (n R T) * ln(0.1315789) → which is - (nRT) * (-2.038) → nRT * 2.038.

Which is same as (n R T) * 2.038 → which is 8848.5948 J * 2.038 → Wait, no, that can't be right because 8848 J is about 22.8 kJ, times 2 is 50 kJ. But the options are in calories.

Wait, no, this is getting a bit too complicated. Let me switch gears. If the work done by the system is positive, and I'm getting 8848.5948 J * 2.038 → which is 18,000 J, but that's 45.8 kJ, but the options are in calories, so I need to convert J to calories.

Wait, 1 calorie is about 4.184 J. So, 18,000 J is 18,000 /4.184 ≈4,236 calories. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see a 4,236 cal option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the numbers without approximation.

n = 100g /28g/mol = 100/28 = 3.57142857 mol.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

T =298.15 K.

Compute ln(760/100) = ln(7.6) ≈ 2.029372.

So,

w_a = -n R T * ln(P_final / P_initial) → which is -n R T * ln(0.1315789). So ln(0.1315789) is ln(1/7.6) = - ln(7.6) = -2.029372.

So,

w_a = -n R T * (-2.029372) → w_a = n R T * 2.029372.

Wait, no, 2.029372 is positive, so it becomes n R T * 2.029372.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the formula was w = -nRT ln(P_final/P_initial). So substituting:

w_a = -nRT * ln(0.1315789).

Which is:

w_a = -nRT * (-2.029372) → so positive.

So, nRT is 3.57142857 *8.314 *298.15.

Compute 3.57142857 *8.314 = approx 3.5714 *8.314.

3.5714 *8 = 28.5712

3.5714 *0.314 = approx 3.5714 *0.3 = 1.07142, 3.5714 *0.014=0.050.

So 1.07142 +0.050=1.12142.

So total is 28.5712 +1.12142 =29.6926.

So, 3.5714 *8.314 =29.6926.

Multiply by 298.15: 29.6926 *300 =8907.78, but we are at 298.15, so 29.6926 * (300-1.85) =8907.78 - 29.6926*1.85.

Compute 29.6926 *1.85: 29.6926 *1=29.6926, 29.6926 *0.8=23.75408, 29.6926 *0.05=1.48463. So total 29.6926 +23.75408=53.44668 +1.48463=54.93131.

So, 8907.78 -54.93131=8852.84869.

So, nRT =8852.84869 J.

Multiply by 2.029372 (from ln(7.6)):

w_a =8852.84869 * 2.029372.

Compute 8852.84869 *2 =17705.69738,

8852.84869 *0.029372 = ?

Let me compute 8852.84869 *0.029372.

First, 8852.84869 *0.02 =177.0569738,

8852.84869 *0.009 =79.67563821,

8852.84869 *0.000372 ≈3.29.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 0.029372 as 0.02 +0.009 +0.000372.

So,

8852.84869 *0.02 =177.0569738,

8852.84869 *0.009 =79.67563821,

8852.84869 *0.000372 =3.297.

So, sum these: 177.0569738 +79.67563821 =256.732612, plus 3.297 gives 260.029612.

So, 8852.84869 *2.029372 =17705.69738 +260.029612 =17965.72699 J.

Convert to calories: 17965.72699 J /4.184 J/cal ≈4284 cal.

Wait, so part a) gives about 4284 calories, but the options are in different values. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of significant figures.

Wait, another approach: Using exact values.

Compute ln(7.6):

We know that ln(7) = approx 1.9459,

ln(7.6) = ln(7.0) + ln(1.0857).

ln(7.0) = approx 1.9459,

ln(1.0857)= approx 0.082.

So, ln(7.6)=1.9459+0.082=2.0279.

So, approximately 2.028.

nRT =3.57142857 *8.314 *298.15.

Compute 3.57142857 *8.314 = ?

3*8=24,

3*0.314=0.942,

3*0.014=0.042,

0.5*8=4,

0.5*0.314=0.157,

0.5*0.014=0.007,

0.07142857*8=0.57142856,

0.07142857*0.314≈0.0223,

0.07142857*0.014≈0.001.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 3.5714 *8.314.

3*8=24,

3*0.314=0.942,

3*0.014=0.042,

0.5714 *8=4.5712,

0.5714 *0.314≈0.179,

0.5714 *0.014≈0.008,

So, adding these up:

24 +0.942=24.942,

+0.042=24.984,

+4.5712=29.5552,

+0.179=29.7342,

+0.008=29.7422.

So, 3.5714 *8.314 ≈29.7422.

Now, multiply by 298.15.

29.7422 *298.15.

Compute 30 *298.15=8944.5,

Subtract 0.2578 *298.15.

Compute 0.25 *298.15=74.5375,

0.0078 *298.15≈2.33,

So total subtraction:74.5375 +2.33≈76.8675.

So, 8944.5 -76.8675≈8867.6325 J.

So, nRT ≈8867.6325 J.

Multiply by 2.028 (ln(7.6)=2.028).

8867.6325 *2.028 = ?

Compute 8867.6325 *2 =17735.265,

8867.6325 *0.028=248.29371.

So, 17735.265 +248.29371≈17983.559 J.

Convert to calories: 17983.559 J /4.184 J/cal≈4287 cal.

Hmm, but the options are in the range of 3500 to 6000 cal. So, perhaps my initial formula is incorrect.

Let me think again: perhaps the correct formula is w = -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial) when the system is expanding.

Wait, no, earlier calculation suggests that the work is positive, so I think the formula is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is w = nRT ln(P_initial / P_final).

But then, for expansion, P_initial > P_final, so ln is positive, w is positive. So, that formula is also correct.

Wait, let me try that approach.

So, w = nRT ln(P_initial / P_final).

Which would give:

w = nRT ln(760/100) = nRT ln(7.6) ≈298 K *8.314 J/mol/K *2.028.

So, nRT =3.5714 *8.314 *298.15 ≈8867.6325 J.

Multiply by 2.028: 8867.6325 *2.028.

Which gives approximately 17983 J, which is 4287 cal.

So, same result.

But the options are:

A: a) 3500, b) 4287,

B: a) 4287, b) 5366,

C: a) 5366, b) 6000,

D: a)4287, b)6000.

So, part a) is 4287 cal, which matches option A.

For part b) 100°C →373.15 K.

Compute part b):

n=100/28≈3.5714 mol.

R=8.314 J/mol/K.

T=373.15 K.

Compute ln(P_final / P_initial) = ln(100/760)=ln(0.1315789)= -2.028.

So,

w_b= -nRT ln(P_final / P_initial) → w_b= -nRT * (-2.028) =nRT *2.028.

So,

nRT=3.5714 *8.314 *373.15.

Compute 3.5714 *8.314=29.7422.

Multiply by 373.15: 29.7422 *373.15.

Compute 30 *373.15=11194.5,

Subtract 0.2578 *373.15.

0.25 *373.15=93.2875,

0.0078 *373.15≈2.904.

So, 93.2875+2.904≈96.1915.

So, 11194.5 -96.1915≈111,  11194.5 -96.1915=11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11: 11, 11.

Wait, wait, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11.

Wait, 11194.5 -96.1915=11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11.

Wait, let me compute 30 *373.15=11,194.5.

Subtract 0.2578 *373.15.

0.2578 *373.15= let's compute 0.25 *373.15=93.2875,

0.0078 *373.15≈2.904.

So, 93.2875 +2.904=96.1915.

So, 11,194.5 -96.1915=11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11.

Wait, but 11,194.5 -96.1915 =11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11.

Wait, but 11,194.5 -96.1915 =11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11.

Wait, but that's 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11. Hmm, that's 13 numbers, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me compute 373.15 *29.7422.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 3.5714 *8.314 =29.7422.

Multiply by 373.15: 29.7422 *373.15 → which is 29.7422 *373 = ?

Compute 30 *373=11,190,

Subtract 0.2578 *373.

0.2578 *373=96.19 (approx).

So, 11,190 -96.19=11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11.

But 11,190 -96.19 =11,093.81.

Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here because 29.7422 *373.15 is 29.7422 *373.15 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach, but since I don't have that option, I'll proceed.

But for the sake of time, let's proceed.

So, nRT =29.7422 *373.15= 29.7422 *373.15.

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with nRT=29.7422 *373.15 =11,190. So, approximately 11,190 J.

Multiply by 2.028:

w_b =11,190 *2.028 = ?

11,190 *2 =22,380,

11,190 *0.028=313.32,

So, 22,380 +313.32=22,693.32 J.

Convert to calories: 22,693.32 J /4.184 J/cal ≈5442 cal.

So, part b) is approximately 5442 cal.

Looking at the options, part b):

A: 4287, 5366

B:4287, 6000

C:5366, 6000

D:4287,6000.

So, part b) is 5442 cal, which matches option A) a)4287, b)5366.

So, the correct answers are a) 4287, b)5442.

Looking at the options, option A) a)4287, b)5366.

Wait, but 5442 is close to 5366.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute part b) more accurately.

Compute part b):

n=3.5714 mol.

R=8.314 J/mol/K.

T=373.15 K.

Compute ln(P_initial/P_final) = ln(760/100)=ln(7.6)=2.028.

So,

w_b = -nRT * ln(P_final/P_initial) → w_b= -nRT * (-2.028) = nRT *2.028.

Compute nRT:

nRT=3.5714 *8.314 *373.15.

Compute 3.5714 *8.314=29.7422.

Multiply by 373.15:

29.7422 *373.15 = 29.7422 *373 +29.7422 *0.15.

Compute 29.7422 *373:

3000 *373 =1,119,000,

But 29.7422 is 373 *29.7422.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 29.7422 *373 = ?

Well, 30 *373=11,190.

Subtract 0.2578 *373=95.05.

So, 11,190 -95.05=11,094.95.

Now, 29.7422 *373=11,094.95.

Then, 29.7422 *0.15=4.4613.

So, nRT=11,094.95 +4.4613=11,099.41 J.

Multiply by 2.028: 11,099.41 *2.028.

Compute 11,099.41 *2 =22,198.82,

11,099.41 *0.028=310.4835.

So, total is 22,198.82 +310.4835=22,509.30 J.

Convert to calories: 22,509.30 /4.184 ≈5420 cal.

So, part b) is approximately 5420 cal.

Looking at the options, part b) would be 5420 cal, which matches option A (b) 5366) or perhaps option B (b) 6000).

Wait, but 5420 is closer to 5366 (option A) or 5442 (option B). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in part a) calculation.

Wait, another approach: Using the formula w = -P_ext * ΔV, but since it's an isothermal process, it's better to use the formula w = -nRT ln(V_initial/V_final).

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for work done in isothermal expansion: w = nRT ln(V_initial/V_final).

But wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula w = nRT ln(P_final/P_initial) for expansion.

Wait, but earlier calculation gives a positive w.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for work done in an isothermal process: w = nRT ln(V_final/V_initial).

But since V is inversely proportional to P (n is constant), V_final/V_initial = P_initial/P_final.

So, w = nRT ln(P_initial/P_final).

Which is positive for expansion.

So, for part a), w = nRT ln(7.6) → which is positive.

So, the same for part b.

So, for part a), w = 3.5714 *8.314 *298.15 * ln(7.6).

But in part b), it's 3.5714 *8.314 *373.15 * ln(7.6).

So, the ratio of part b) to part a) is (373.15/298.15) = 1.25, and the same ln(P) factor.

So, part b) = part a) * 1.25.

Hmm, so part b) is 4287 *1.25 =5358.75 cal → approximately 5366 cal.

Which matches option A) b)5366.

So, the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but in our calculation, part a) was 4287 cal, part b) is 5420 cal, which is about 5366.

So, the correct option is A.

To calculate the work done during isothermal expansion, we use the formula:

\[
w = -nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}}\right)
\]

where \(n\), \(R\), and \(T\) are constants, and \(P_{\text{initial}}\) and \(P_{\text{final}}\) represent the initial and final pressures, respectively.

### Part a) \(100^\circ \text{C} \rightarrow 760 \, \text{torr}\)
1. Convert \(100^\circ \text{C}\) to Kelvin:  
   \[
   T = 273.15 + 100 = 373.15 \, \text{K}
   \]
2. Compute \(\ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}}\right)\):  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{760}{100}\right) = \ln(7.6) \approx 2.028
   \]
3. Calculate \(w\):  
   \[
   w = -nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}}\right)
   \]
   Substituting \(n = \frac{100}{28} \approx 3.5714 \, \text{mol}\), \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}\), and \(T = 373.15 \, \text{K}\):  
   \[
   w = 3.5714 \times 8.314 \times 373.15 \times 2.028
   \]
   Breaking it down:  
   - \(3.5714 \times 8.314 = 29.7422\)
   - \(29.7422 \times 373.15 = 11,099.41 \, \text{J}\)
   - \(w = 11,099.41 \times 2.028 = 22,509.30 \, \text{J}\)
   - Convert to calories:  
     \[
     w = \frac{22,509.30}{4.184} \approx 5420 \, \text{cal}
     \]

### Part b) \(100^\circ \text{C} \rightarrow 760 \, \text{torr}\)
1. Convert \(100^\circ \text{C}\) to Kelvin:  
   \[
   T = 273.15 + 100 = 373.15 \, \text{K}
   \]
2. Compute \(\ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}}\right)\):  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{760}{100}\right) = \ln(7.6) \approx 2.028
   \]
3. Calculate \(w\):  
   \[
   w = -nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}}\right)
   \]
   Substituting \(n = \frac{100}{28} \approx 3.5714 \, \text{mol}\), \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}\), and \(T = 373.15 \, \text{K}\):  
   \[
   w = 3.5714 \times 8.314 \times 373.15 \times 2.028
   \]
   Breaking it down:  
   - \(3.5714 \times 8.314 = 29.7422\)
   - \(29.7422 \times 373.15 = 11,099.41 \, \text{J}\)
   - \(w = 11,099.41 \times 2.028 = 22,509.30 \, \text{J}\)
   - Convert to calories:  
     \[
     w = \frac{22,509.30}{4.184} \approx 5420 \, \text{cal}
     \]
