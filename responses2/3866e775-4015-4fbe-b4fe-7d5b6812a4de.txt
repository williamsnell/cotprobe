Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here. The question is about finding where the curve x³ + xy - y² = 10 has a vertical tangent line. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Hmm, vertical tangent lines occur where the derivative dy/dx is undefined or infinite, right? So that means the denominator in dy/dx is zero.

Let me start by recalling how to find dy/dx for implicit functions. I remember that you take the derivative of both sides with respect to x, treating y as a function of x. So, I'll differentiate each term.

The given equation is x³ + xy - y² = 10. Let me differentiate term by term.

The derivative of x³ is 3x². For the xy term, I'll use the product rule. The derivative of x is 1, multiplied by y, plus x multiplied by the derivative of y, which is dy/dx. So that's y + x(dy/dx).

Then, the derivative of -y² is -2y(dy/dx), using the chain rule. The derivative of 10 is zero.

Putting it all together:

3x² + y + x(dy/dx) - 2y(dy/dx) = 0.

Now, I need to solve for dy/dx. Let me group the terms with dy/dx:

x(dy/dx) - 2y(dy/dx) = -3x² - y.

Factor out dy/dx:

dy/dx (x - 2y) = -3x² - y.

So dy/dx = (-3x² - y) / (x - 2y).

A vertical tangent line occurs when dy/dx is undefined. That happens when the denominator is zero. So we set the denominator equal to zero:

x - 2y = 0 → x = 2y.

So, we have two equations: the original curve equation and x = 2y.

Substituting x = 2y into the original equation:

(2y)³ + (2y)(y) - y² = 10.

Let me compute each term. (2y)^3 is 8y³. 2y times y is 2y². So substituting gives:

8y³ + 2y² - y² = 10.

Simplify 2y² - y² → y².

So 8y³ + y² = 10.

This is a cubic equation: 8y³ + y² - 10 = 0.

Hmm, solving cubic equations can be tricky. Maybe I can use the rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 10 over factors of 8, so ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10, ±1/2, etc.

Let me try y=1: 8(1) +1 -10 = 8+1-10= -1, not zero.

y= -1: 8(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 -10 = -8 +1 -10 = -17, not zero.

y= 2: 8*8 +4 -10 → Wait, 8*(8) is 64, 64+4-10=58≠0.

Wait, wait. Wait, y=1/2: 8*(1/8) + (1/4) -10 = 1 + 0.25 -10 = -8.75. Not zero.

y= -2: 8*(-8) +4 -10= -64 +4-10= -70. Not zero.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me redo the substitution.

Wait, the substitution: x=2y. Plugging into x³ + xy - y² =10:

(2y)^3 + (2y)(y) - y² = 8y³ + 2y² - y² = 8y³ + y² = 10.

So equation is 8y³ + y² -10 =0.

Let me try y=1: 8 +1 -10 = -1. Not zero.

y= -2: 8*(-8) + (4) -10 = -64 +4 -10 =-70. No.

Wait, perhaps y=1/2: 8*(1/8) + (1/4) -10 =1 +0.25 -10= -8.75. Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe y=1/2 is not a root. Let me try y= something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rational root theorem, but maybe it's not a rational root. In that case, I might have to use other methods. But maybe I can use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate a real root.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it or find a real root by testing.

Wait, wait, maybe let me take a different approach. Let me assume that y is a number such that y=1. Let's plug that into the equation again:

8*(1)^3 + (1)^2 =8 +1=9. 9-10= -1. Not zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a y where 8y³ + y² =10.

Hmm, let's try y=1.1: 8*(1.331) + (1.21) = 10.648 +1.21=11.858. That's more than 10.

y=1.05: 8*(1.157625) + (1.1025) → 9.261 +1.1025=10.3635. Close, but still higher than 10.

y=1.03: Let's compute each term.

8*(1.03)^3: (1.03)^3 is approximately 1.092727. Multiply by 8: ~8.7418.

(1.03)^2 =1.0609.

So 8.7418 +1.0609=9.8027. That's less than 10.

Wait, so between y=1.03 and y=1.05.

Wait, at y=1.03: 8y³ + y² = approx 8*(1.03)^3 + (1.03)^2.

Compute 1.03^3:

1.03 *1.03 =1.0609 → 1.0609 *1.03 ≈1.092727.

So 8 * 1.092727 ≈8.7418.

1.03² is 1.0609.

So 8.7418 +1.0609 = 9.8027.

So at y=1.03, 8y³ + y² =9.8027 <10.

At y=1.04: compute 8*(1.04)^3 + (1.04)^2.

1.04^3=1.124864 → 8*1.124864=9.0.

1.04^2=1.0816. So 9.0 +1.0816=10.0816>10.

So somewhere between 1.03 and 1.04.

At y=1.035:

Compute 1.035^3: 1.035 *1.035 =1.071225; 1.071225 *1.035 ≈1.107635125.

8 *1.107635125=8.861081.

1.035^2=1.071225.

Sum: 8.861081 +1.071225=9.932306, which is still less than 10.

y=1.038: Let's compute 1.038^3.

First, (1.038)^2= 1.077444. Then multiply by 1.038.

1.077444 *1.038:

1 *1.038 =1.038.

0.077444 *1.038 ≈0.077444 *1 =0.077444; 0.077444 *0.038≈0.002961. So total ≈0.080405.

So total (1.038)^3 ≈1.038 +0.080405 =1.118405.

8 *1.118405=9.04324.

(1.038)^2=1.077444.

So 8*(1.038)^3 + (1.038)^2=9.04324 +1.077444=10.120684.

That's over 10.

So between y=1.035 and y=1.038.

At y=1.035, the value is 9.932306.

At y=1.038: 10.120684.

We need to find y where 8y³ + y²=10.

Let me use linear approximation between y=1.035 (9.9323) and y=1.038 (10.1207).

The difference in y is 0.003; the difference in f(y) is 10.1207-9.9323=0.1884.

We need to find delta such that 9.9323 + delta*(0.1884/0.003) =10.

So 9.9323 + (0.1884/0.003)*delta =10 → delta = (0.0677)*(0.003/0.1884) → Hmm, perhaps it's easier to do a linear approximation.

Wait, wait, perhaps using linear approximation:

We can model f(y)=8y³ + y² -10.

We know f(1.035)=9.932306-10= -0.067694.

f(1.038)=10.120684-10=0.120684.

We need to find y such that f(y)=0.

Assuming f(y) is approximately linear between these two points.

The delta y needed is (0 - (-0.067694)) * (0.003) / (0.1884) → 0.067694 * 0.003 / 0.1884.

Compute 0.067694 * 0.003 =0.000203082.

Divide by 0.1884: 0.000203082 /0.1884≈0.001078.

So y ≈1.035 + 0.001078 ≈1.036078.

Approximately 1.0361.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps Newton-Raphson method could give a better approximation.

Let me try Newton-Raphson.

f(y) =8y³ + y² -10.

f'(y)=24y² +2y.

Starting with an initial guess y0=1.035.

f(1.035)=9.932306-10= -0.067694.

f'(1.035)=24*(1.035)^2 +2*(1.035)=24*(1.071225) +2.07=25.7094 +2.07=27.7794.

Next iteration: y1 = y0 - f(y0)/f'(y0).

So y1=1.035 - (-0.067694)/27.7794.

Compute denominator:27.7794.

So, 0.067694 /27.7794 ≈0.002435.

So y1=1.035 - (-0.002435)=1.035 +0.002435=1.037435.

Now compute f(y1)=8*(1.037435)^3 + (1.037435)^2 -10.

Compute 1.037435^2: approx 1.07644.

1.037435^3: 1.037435 *1.07644≈approx 1.116 (exact calculation needed).

Wait, let me compute 1.037435 *1.07644:

Multiply 1.037435 *1.07644.

Compute 1 *1.07644=1.07644.

0.037435 *1.07644≈0.037435 *1=0.037435; 0.037435 *0.07644≈0.002864.

So total ≈0.037435+0.002864≈0.040299.

So total 1.07644 +0.040299≈1.116739.

Now 8*1.116739≈8.93391.

Adding (1.037435)^2≈1.07644.

So 8.93391 +1.07644≈10.01035.

Subtract 10: 10.01035-10=0.01035.

Hmm, so f(y1)=0.01035.

f'(y1)=24*(1.037435)^2 +2*(1.037435)=24*(1.07644) +2.07487.

24*1.07644= let me compute 24*1.07644: 24 *1=24, 24*0.07644=1.83456. So total=24+1.83456=25.83456.

Adding the 2.07487: 25.83456 +2.07487=27.90943.

So f'(y1)=27.90943.

Now, next iteration: y2 = y1 - f(y1)/f'(y1)=1.037435 - (0.01035)/27.90943.

Compute 0.01035/27.90943≈0.0003715.

So y2=1.037435 -0.0003715≈1.0370635.

Compute f(y2)=8*(1.0370635)^3 + (1.0370635)^2 -10.

Compute 1.0370635^2 ≈1.07565.

1.0370635^3≈1.0370635 *1.07565≈1.0370635 *1=1.0370635, 1.0370635 *0.07565≈0.07841. So 1.0370635 +0.07841≈1.11547.

8 *1.11547≈8.92376.

Adding (1.0370635)^2≈1.07565.

Total:8.92376+1.07565≈10.0.

So 10.0 -10=0. So f(y2)=0.0.

Wait, but that's a bit close. Hmm, perhaps I made an approximation error, but this suggests that y≈1.037.

Wait, but when I plugged y=1.037 into the equation earlier, I got 8y³ + y² ≈10.0.

Wait, but let's check the exact equation again.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the problem.

The original equation is x³ + xy - y² =10.

We found that dy/dx is undefined when x=2y, leading to 8y³ + y²=10.

We found that y≈1.037 (from the Newton-Raphson method). So x=2y=2*(1.037)=2.074.

Wait, but let me check: When y≈1.037, x=2y≈2.074.

So the point is (2.074,1.037).

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A. x= -2.037

B. x=2.037

C. x=2.074

D. x=-2.074

Wait, according to the calculation, x≈2.074, which is option C.

But earlier, when I computed f(1.03), I got a value less than 10, and at y=1.037, it's equal to 10.

Wait, but wait, when I calculated f(1.037), I got 8y³ + y²=10, but in the Newton-Raphson, I found y≈1.037 which gives f(y)=0.

So, that suggests that x=2y=2*(1.037)=2.074.

So the point is (2.074, 1.037). So the x-coordinate is 2.074.

Looking at the options, option C is x=2.074. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the calculations. Because in the earlier substitution, I thought the denominator was x=2y, leading to x=2y.

Wait, but substituting x=2y into the original equation gives 8y³ + y² =10.

We found that y≈1.037, so x=2*1.037=2.074.

So that's the x-value where the derivative is undefined.

So the options are:

A. x= -2.037

B. x=2.037

C. x=2.074

D. x=-2.074

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Because when I did the substitution and used the Newton-Raphson method, I found that y≈1.037, leading to x=2.074. But when I look at the options, option C is x=2.074, which is what I got.

So the answer is C.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{C}
</think>

To find the x-coordinate where the derivative is undefined, we start with the given curve equation:

\[ x^3 + xy - y^2 = 10 \]

We differentiate both sides with respect to \( x \):

\[ 3x^2 + y + x \frac{dy}{dx} - 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \]

Rearranging to solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):

\[ (x - 2y) \frac{dy}{dx} = -3x^2 - y - x \frac{dy}{dx} \]

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-3x^2 - y}{x - 2y} \]

The derivative is undefined when the denominator is zero, i.e., when \( x = 2y \). Substituting \( x = 2y \) into the original equation:

\[ (2y)^3 + (2y)(y) - y^2 = 10 \]

Simplifying:

\[ 8y^3 + 2y^2 - y^2 = 10 \]
\[ 8y^3 + y^2 = 10 \]

We solve this cubic equation using numerical methods. Using the Newton-Raphson method, we approximate \( y \) and find that \( y \approx 1.037 \). Thus, \( x = 2y \approx 2.074 \).

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
