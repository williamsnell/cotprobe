Question:

Following their law school graduation party, a graduate and his roommate were driving home in an automobile that was owned and operated by the graduate. As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving "at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. "The complaint is

Options:

A: admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.
B: inadmissible, because it is considered hearsay.
C: admissible as a declaration against interest.
D: admissible, because the graduate consented to its use.
E: inadmissible, because the roommate is not a party to the lawsuit.
F: inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.
G: admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.
H: admissible as a statement of fact.
I: admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
J: admissible as an admission.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about hearsay and evidence in a law class. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a graduate and his roommate being involved in an auto accident. The graduate's vehicle collided with a motorcycle rider, who was seriously injured. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motorcycle too fast. The roommate then went to court against the rider, but they settled out of court. Now, the question is about the evidence the rider offered against the roommate.

So, the rider's evidence is that he saw the graduate's motorcycle driver swerving into the path of his own. The graduate's complaint says he was driving at an "excessively high rate of speed." The options are about whether the complaint is admissible.

First, I need to remember the hearsay rule. Hearsay is anything spoken or written by a party to the trial of which the party is not themselves. It has to be a statement made within the course of a party's own business or in the course of a known fact, and it can't be for the purpose of another party. Also, it can't be a statement for the purpose of another party's knowledge or benefit.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Admissible under the former testimony exception. That's the "fearful exception" which is about the graduate's prior testimony. The graduate said the graduate was driving at a high speed. The roommate's testimony that the graduate was speeding. So maybe the graduate's testimony can be used here? But who is the party here? The graduate and the roommate. If the graduate testified, maybe the prior testimony exception applies. But the complaint is a statement of fact from the rider, not a prior testimony. So I'm not sure. Maybe A is not correct.

Option B: Inadmissible because hearsay. But the complaint is a statement of fact. If it's a statement of fact, it's not hearsay. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Admissible as a declaration against interest. That's about the grantee not being bound by a statement. I'm not sure how that applies here. Maybe if the rider is claiming he didn't have the right of way, but I don't recall the business records exception, which is about business use. So C might be incorrect.

Option D: Admissible under the business records exception. The business records exception allows for statements made by a party against a party on a matter known to the other party. In this case, the graduate's testimony about the speed is against the roommate, who is a party. So the complaint is a statement made against the graduate, which is a business record. So D might be correct.

Option E: Inadmissible because roommate isn't a party. The issue is whether the statement is against a party. The statement was against the graduate, so the roommate is not a party. Wait, no, the roommate is a party because he's suing the graduate. Wait, no: the issue is whether the statement is against a party. The statement is against the graduate, so the graduate is the party. The roommate is the other party. So if the statement is against the graduate, it's against a party. So E is incorrect because the roommate isn't the party; the graduate is.

Option F: Inadmissible because dismissed as part of compromise. I don't think that applies here. Compromises are usually for settlement, not for inadmissibility. F is probably wrong.

Option G: Admissible under the business records exception. As I thought earlier, the business records exception allows statements against a party, which is the graduate here. So D is correct, I think.

Option H: Admissible as a statement of fact. Again, the complaint is a statement of fact, so it's not hearsay. So H is wrong.

Option I: Admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. That's about the prior testimony. The graduate testified, and the roommate testified. But the complaint is a statement against the graduate, so I don't see how that applies.

Option J: Admissible as an admission. Admissions are for the purpose of admission to the bar, not for any other purpose. So J is wrong.

So the only correct option is D.
</think>

The graduate testified that he was driving at an excessive speed, and the roommate testified that the graduate was speeding. The rider offered evidence that the graduate was speeding, which is a statement of fact. Statements of fact are not hearsay because they do not involve a party's own business or purpose. The business records exception allows a statement against a party, which is the graduate in this case. Therefore, the complaint is admissible as a statement of fact under option H. However, the correct exception is the business records exception, making option D the right answer.

**Answer: D**
