Okay, so I have this question about lithic technology found in the Arctic. Let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I need to understand what lithic technology is. Lithic refers to the stones, usually volcanic sand, used in the recycling process. The technology involves cutting tools made from these stones, which are then used to refine other materials like metal. The tools include wedges, micro-blades, bifacial knives, and sometimes burins. These tools are used in mining and construction.

Now, the question is asking what the name of this technology is, specifically mentioning the Arctic. The options are a list of various geological or mining complexes. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact names, so I'll try to recall or think about each option.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Ahrensburg Complex. I'm not too sure about this one. I remember that Ahrensburg is a place in North America, maybe in the US. I think this might be related to mining in the American continents, maybe in the Great Smoky Mountains or something like that. Not sure if it's specifically tied to the Arctic.

Option B: Solutrean Complex. Solutrean is another term I've heard, but I'm not certain about the specifics. I think it's associated with the North American continent, maybe in the American mountains. The Solutrean Complex might have been used in mining in the region, but I'm not certain if it's the one in the Arctic.

Option C: Aurignacian Complex. Aurignacian rings a bell. I think it's another North American geological period. Aurignacian is linked to the American Great Mountain Range, which includes the Rockies. So perhaps this is a mining complex in North America, maybe the Arctic being a part of it? Not sure, but I'm trying to remember if Aurignacian is used in the Arctic.

Option D: Nenana Complex. The Nenana Complex sounds familiar. I think it's one of the oldest known lithic complexes in North America. The name "Nenana" comes from the Nenana tribe, who lived in the Great Smoky Mountains. So if that's the case, the Nenana Complex would be in the region, including the Arctic. That sounds right because the question mentions the Arctic.

Option E: Gravettian Complex. The Gravettian is a period in North America known for being one of the oldest known lithic resources in North America. It's associated with the Great Smoky Mountains, including the Arctic. So the Gravettian Complex would be in the Arctic region.

Option F: Clovis Complex. Clovis is a bit vague. I'm not too sure of this one. I think Clovis is another term for the Great Smoky Mountains, maybe in the US, but I'm not certain if it's a lithic complex or a mining complex. Maybe it's more related to the US, not necessarily the Arctic.

Option G: Denali Complex. Denali is another term for the Great Smoky Mountains. But I'm not sure if this refers to a specific complex. I think the Cling Complex is more famous, but I'm not certain about Denali specifically.

Option H: Mousterian Complex. The Mousterian period is more associated with North America than the Arctic, I believe. It's linked to the American Great Mountain Range, including the Great Smoky Mountains, which are in the Arctic. But I'm not sure if the Mousterian is specifically known as a complex in the Arctic.

Option I: Magdalenian Complex. The Magdalenian is another North American geological period, associated with the Great Smoky Mountains. I'm not sure if it's the same as the Nenana or Gravettian. But I don't remember it being called the Magdalenian; that one might be another term.

Option J: Folsom Complex. The Folsom Complex is in the Pacific Northwest, specifically in Washington State. I'm not sure if it's related to the Arctic. It's more about mining in the North, not the Arctic.

Putting this together, the options that are geological in North America are A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Since the question is about the Arctic, I need to think which of these is the Nenana or Gravettian Complex. Both are associated with the Great Smoky Mountains, which includes the Arctic. The Nenana is the oldest lithic complex in North America and is associated with the Great Smoky Mountains. The Gravettian is another period known for having a significant amount of lithium, which is used in mining and batteries.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The Nenana Complex is in the US, but the question is about the Arctic. The Gravettian, which is the E option, would be in the Arctic because it's part of the Great Smoky Mountains.

So the answer should be E: Gravettian Complex.

The question asks for the name of the lithic technology found in the Arctic, specifically in the Great Smoky Mountains. Lithic technology involves tools made from volcanic sand, such as wedge-shaped cores, micro-blades, bifacial knives, and burins.

- **Option A: Ahrensburg Complex**  
  Not associated with the Arctic.

- **Option B: Solutrean Complex**  
  Likely to be in North America, not specifically the Arctic.

- **Option C: Aurignacian Complex**  
  Related to the American Great Mountain Range, which includes the Arctic.

- **Option D: Nenana Complex**  
  The oldest lithic complex in North America, associated with the Great Smoky Mountains. While it's in North America, the question focuses on the Arctic.

- **Option E: Gravettian Complex**  
  Another period in North America (Great Smoky Mountains) known for having lithium, making it relevant to the Arctic.

- **Option F: Clovis Complex**  
  Uncertain, possibly unrelated to the Arctic.

- **Option G: Denali Complex**  
  Another term for the Great Smoky Mountains, but not a specific lithic complex name.

- **Option H: Mousterian Complex**  
  Associated with the American Great Mountain Range, including the Arctic, but not directly known as a specific lithic complex.

- **Option I: Magdalenian Complex**  
  Not specifically known for the Arctic.

- **Option J: Folsom Complex**  
  Located in the Pacific Northwest, not the Arctic.

The correct answer is the Gravettian Complex (E), as it is associated with the Great Smoky Mountains, including the Arctic, and serves as a lithic complex. 

**Answer: E**
