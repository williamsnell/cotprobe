Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about heat transfer between iron and liquid air, then between the iron and water. I remember that heat lost by the iron should equal the heat gained by the air, right? But wait, since the ice forms on the iron when it's submerged in water, that must mean some heat is also involved in melting the ice.

Let me read the problem again. So, the iron has a mass of 20 grams. When placed in liquid air, it reaches thermal equilibrium. Then, when quickly placed into water at 0°C, a 5.22g mass of ice forms. The specific heat of iron is 0.095 cal/g°C. The heat of fusion for water is 80 cal/g. We need to find the initial temperature of the liquid air.

So, the process is: Air (liquid) → Air + Iron → Iron at same temp as air. Then, Iron (same temp as air) is put into water, which initially is at 0°C. Since the ice forms, that means some heat is being absorbed by the ice to melt it. So, the heat lost by the iron when moving from initial temp to water temp (same as air) should equal the heat gained by the air, plus the heat required to melt the ice.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When the iron is placed in air, it cools down to a certain temperature. Then, when it's placed into water, it warms up from that temperature to 0°C. During this process, the air is losing heat, which includes cooling down (so heat loss from the air, which would be a transfer to the iron) plus the transfer of heat from the air to the iron, which would be a cooling process. But also, the air might lose heat to the water when it's placed there. Wait, no. Because the initial setup is air is in contact with the iron, then when the iron is placed into water, the air's temperature might drop further.

Wait, the problem says the ice forms on the iron when it's in the water. So, when iron is at 0°C, it's placed into water. The water is at 0°C, so no temperature change there. The iron is at 0°C, but it's in contact with the ice. So, the ice will absorb heat from the iron. The heat from the ice will be used to melt it, and perhaps raise the temperature if any. But since the final temp is 0°C, the ice must have completely melted, and no further temperature change.

So, the heat lost by the iron when going from initial temp (T_initial_air) to 0°C must equal the heat gained by the air plus the heat required to melt the ice.

Wait, but the air is initially at T_air. When the iron is placed in the air, it cools down to some temperature T1, which is the same as the air. Then, when placed into water, the air is at T1 and the water is at 0. So, the air's temperature might drop further to 0. Wait, no, because the initial air (liquid) and the water are at 0. So, the temperature of the air when it's placed into the water would be 0. But wait, the air's initial temp is T_air. So, when the iron is placed into the air, it cools down to T_air, then is placed into water at 0. So the air's temperature would then go from T_air to 0. So, the air would lose heat in both processes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model the heat flow.

First process: Iron in liquid air. It cools down to a certain temperature T1, which is the same as the air's initial temp. Then, when placed into water, it warms up from T1 to 0. So, the air's temperature goes from T_air to T1 (when in contact with the iron), and then from T1 to 0 (when in contact with the water).

Wait, no. The air is in contact with the iron, so the air's temperature is T1. Then, the iron is placed into the water, which is at 0. So, the air would have to cool down to 0. But wait, the air's initial temp is T_air, which is lower than the initial air temp when placed into iron? No, because the initial air is being placed into the iron, so the air's temp is T_air. Then, the iron cools down to T1 (which is same as the air's initial temp when in contact with the iron). Then, when placed into the water, the air is at T1 and the water is at 0. So, the air would have to cool further from T1 to 0. So, in this case, the heat lost by the air is from T_air to T1, and then from T1 to 0. So, total heat lost by air is (T_air - T1) * m_air * c_air + (T1 - 0) * m_air * c_air.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. When the iron is placed into the air, the air is at T_air. The iron is at initial M_iron * c_iron * (T_in_air - T_air) → this is the heat lost by the iron. The air will lose heat, but since it's a liquid, perhaps it can't conduct heat as well, but in this problem, it's assumed that the heat transfer is via conduction. So, the heat lost by the iron is equal to the heat gained by the air.

Wait, but wait, the problem says after placing the iron into the air, when it's quickly taken out, it's placed into water. So, when the iron is placed into the air, it cools down to some temperature, say T1. Then, when placed into the water, it warms up from T1 to 0, and gains heat m_ice * L (because the ice melts). The heat lost by the air is the heat from T_air cooling down to T1, and then from T1 cooling to 0. So, the heat lost by the air is (T_air - T1)*m_air*c_air * 2? No, wait, no, the air goes from T_air to T1 (when in contact with the iron) and then from T1 to 0 (when in contact with the water). So, the heat lost by the air is (T_air - T1)*m_air*c_air + (T1 - 0)*m_air*c_air = m_air c_air (T_air - T1 + T1) )= m_air c_air T_air.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if T1 is the temperature of the air when the iron cools, then the air's initial temp is T_air. First, it cools to T1, so the heat lost is (T_air - T1)*m_air c_air. Then, when placed into water, it cools from T1 to 0: (T1 - 0)*m_air c_air. So, total heat loss by air: m_air c_air (T_air - T1) + m_air c_air T1 = m_air c_air (T_air - T1 + T1) ) = m_air c_air T_air.

Wait, but then when the iron is placed into the water, the air's temp is T1, and the water is at 0. So, the air's temp would need to go from T1 to 0. So, the air's heat loss is (T_air_initial - T1) * m_air * c_air + (T1 - 0) * m_air * c_air )

= m_air c_air (T_air_initial - T1 + T1 - 0) = m_air c_air T_air_initial.

But wait, when the air is in contact with the iron, the air can't lose heat faster than the iron. So, the heat lost by the iron is equal to the heat gained by the air and the heat required to melt the ice.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the heat transfer.

The iron, when placed into the air, cools down from T_iron_initial to T1. The heat lost by the iron is m_iron * c_iron * (T_iron_initial - T1).

The air, when placed into the iron, gains this heat. So, the air's temperature goes from T_air_initial to T1. The heat gained by the air is m_air * c_air * (T1 - T_air_initial) .

But wait, when the iron is placed into the water, the air's temp is already T1. Then, the air is in contact with the water, which is at 0°C. So, the air's temperature would need to drop further from T1 to 0. So, the heat lost by the air is m_air * c_air * (T1 - 0) = m_air c_air T1.

Wait, that can't be right because if the air is cooling down from T1 to 0, the heat lost is (T1 - 0) * m_air * c_air. So, the air's total heat loss when placed into the water is m_air c_air T1.

So, putting it together:

Heat lost by iron = Heat gained by air + Heat required to melt ice.

Iron's heat loss is m_iron * c_iron * (T_initial_iron - T1).

Air's heat loss is m_air * c_air * (T1 - T_initial_air) [since it's cooling down to T1] + m_air * c_air * T1 [when cooling down to 0]. So, that's m_air c_air (T1 - T_initial_air + T1) = m_air c_air (2 T1 - T_initial_air).

The ice's heat required is m_ice * L.

So, the equation is:

m_iron c_iron (T_initial_iron - T1) = m_air c_air (2 T1 - T_initial_iron) + m_ice L.

But I also need to express T1 in terms of the heat transfer between the iron and the air.

Wait, the heat lost by the iron is equal to the heat gained by the air, plus the heat required to melt the ice. So,

Heat iron = Heat air (when in contact with air) + Heat air (when in contact with water) + Heat ice.

Wait, no. The heat lost by the iron is:

Heat = m_iron * c_iron * (T_initial_iron - T1) [first part]

Plus

Heat from air cooling from T1 to 0: m_air * c_air * T1.

Plus

Heat to melt ice: m_ice * L.

But the heat from the air is both losing when it's in contact with the iron and when it's in contact with the water. So, the air's total heat loss is (T1 - T_initial_air) * m_air * c_air for cooling to T1, plus (0 - T1) * m_air * c_air for cooling to 0. So, that adds up to (T1 - T_initial_air) + ( - T1 ) = - T_initial_air * m_air c_air. Or wait, no, the air is losing heat when cooling from T_initial_air to T1: (T_initial_air - T1)* m_air c_air. Then, cooling from T1 to 0: (T1 - 0) * m_air c_air. So, total heat loss is (T_initial_air - T1) + T1 = T_initial_air. Wait, so the air's total heat loss is m_air c_air T_initial_air.

Wait, that can't be correct because the air's initial temp is T_initial_air. So, the air will lose heat when cooling from T_initial_air to T1, which is (T_initial_air - T1) * m_air c_air. Then, when cooling from T1 to 0, it's (T1 - 0)* m_air c_air. So, sum is:

(T_initial_air - T1) + T1 = T_initial_air.

So, total heat loss by air is m_air c_air * T_initial_air.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the initial temp of the air is T_initial_air, so the air would lose heat proportional to that. But I'm not sure. Let's proceed.

So, the heat lost by the iron is m_iron c_iron (T_initial_iron - T1).

The heat gained by the air is m_air c_air T_initial_air.

The heat gained by the ice is m_ice * L.

So, the equation is:

m_iron * c_iron * (T_initial_iron - T1) = m_air * c_air * T_initial_air + m_ice * L.

But wait, we also have to relate T1 to the initial temp of the air. Because when the iron is placed in the air, it cools to T1. So, the heat lost by the iron is m_iron * c_iron * (T_initial_iron - T1) = heat gained by air.

The air, when placed into the iron, will lose heat from T_initial_iron to T1: m_air * c_air (T_initial_iron - T1).

Wait, but that's the heat lost by the air. So, m_air c_air (T_initial_iron - T1) = heat lost by air.

But when the air is placed into the water, it also loses heat from T1 to 0: m_air c_air (T1) * (0 - T1) → no, wait, the air is cooling, so the heat lost is (T1 - 0) * m_air c_air. So, that's m_air c_air * T1.

So, the air's total heat loss is (T_initial_iron - T1) * m_air c_air + T1 * m_air c_air = m_air c_air (T_initial_iron - T1 + T1 ) = m_air c_air T_initial_iron.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the air is in contact with both the iron and the water, the heat lost by the air would be (T_initial_iron to T1) plus (T1 to 0). So, the sum is m_air c_air (T_initial_iron - T1 + T1 - 0) )= m_air c_air T_initial_iron.

So, the equation becomes:

m_iron c_iron (T_initial_iron - T1) = m_air c_air T_initial_iron + m_ice L.

But we also need to find T1. How?

Well, the air's heat loss when in contact with the iron is m_air c_air (T_initial_iron - T1), and that's equal to the heat from the iron cooling down to T1. So, the heat lost by the iron is m_iron c_iron (T_initial_iron - T1) = m_air c_air (T_initial_iron - T1).

So, from this, we can find T1.

Because the heat lost by the iron equals the heat gained by the air.

Wait, no. The heat lost by the iron is equal to the heat gained by the air. So,

m_iron c_iron (T_initial_iron - T1) = m_air c_air (T_initial_iron - T1).

But this implies that either T_initial_iron = T1, which can't be right, because when the iron is placed into the air, it must cool down. Or, the only way this is possible is if m_iron c_iron = m_air c_air.

But in this problem, the masses are different. Iron is 20g, air (as in liquid?) is, I think, 200 grams? Or maybe the mass of the liquid air is considered as a separate variable. Oh, wait, the question says 'liquid air' but in the problem statement, the mass of the liquid air isn't given. Hmm. Wait, actually, the problem says the liquid air's mass isn't given. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, the problem states that the liquid air is placed in liquid air until thermal equilibrium is achieved, and when it's quickly taken out and placed into water. So, the initial mass of the liquid air (before being placed into the iron) is the same as the mass of the liquid air after being placed into the iron, right? Or wait, no. Let's re-read the problem.

The first part: "a piece of iron of mass, M = 20g is placed in liquid air until thermal equilibrium is achieved."

So, the liquid air (which is likely liquid water) is the same mass as the iron, 20g. Because when you place the iron into liquid water, the mass of the water is equal to the mass of the iron. So, the initial mass of the liquid air (water) is 20g.

So, in this problem, the liquid air (mass = 20g) is placed into liquid air (20g) until thermal equilibrium. So, the heat lost by the iron is equal to the heat gained by the liquid air.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the initial state is: iron at T_initial_iron, liquid air (water) at T_initial_liquid_air (which is 0°C). After thermal equilibrium, the iron and liquid air (water) reach the same temperature, let me denote it as T1.

So, the heat lost by the iron is m_iron * c_iron * (T_initial_iron - T1). The heat gained by the liquid air is m_air_water * c_water * (T1 - 0) = m_air_water * c_water * T1.

So, equation: m_iron c_iron (T_initial_iron - T1) = m_air_water c_water T1.

Wait, but the problem didn't state the mass of the liquid air. Oh wait, the problem states that the liquid air has a mass of 20g as well. So, m_air_water = 20g.

Ah, that's a key piece of information. So, the liquid air is 20g. So, equation:

20g * 0.095 cal/g°C * (T_initial_iron - T1) = 20g * 4.18 cal/g°C * T1.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the specific heat of liquid air (water) is 4.18 cal/g°C, correct? So, the equation is:

m_iron * c_iron * (T_initial_iron - T1) = m_air_water * c_air_water * T1.

So, plugging in the numbers:

20 g * 0.095 cal/g°C * (T_iron_initial - T1) = 20g * 4.18 cal/g°C * T1.

Simplify: 20 * 0.095 (T_iron_initial - T1) = 20 * 4.18 T1.

Divide both sides by 20:

0.095 (T_iron_initial - T1) = 4.18 T1.

Multiply out:

0.095 T_iron_initial - 0.095 T1 = 4.18 T1.

Bring terms together:

0.095 T_iron_initial = 4.18 T1 + 0.095 T1.

Factor T1:

0.095 T_iron_initial = T1 (4.18 + 0.095) = T1 (4.275).

So, T1 = 0.095 T_iron_initial / 4.275.

Hmm, but I don't know T_iron_initial. Wait, no, I don't know the initial temperature of the liquid air. Or do I? Wait, no, because the liquid air is placed into liquid air. Wait, the initial liquid air is 0°C. So, the liquid air (20g) is at 0°C. When the iron is placed into the liquid air (20g), the liquid air will heat up to some T1. So, the equation is:

20 g * 0.095 (T_iron_initial - T1) = 20 g * 4.18 (T1 - 0).

Simplify:

0.095 (T_iron_initial - T1) = 4.18 T1.

Multiply out:

0.095 T_iron_initial - 0.095 T1 = 4.18 T1.

So,

0.095 T_iron_initial = 4.18 T1 + 0.095 T1 = 4.275 T1.

So,

T_iron_initial = (4.275 / 0.095) T1.

Compute 4.275 / 0.095:

Well, 4.275 ÷ 0.095.

Let me calculate.

0.095 * 45 = 4.275.

So, 4.275 / 0.095 = 45 → wait, no, because 0.095 * 45 = 4.275. So, 4.275 / 0.095 is 45 → yes.

So, T_iron_initial = 45 T1.

Hmm, so T_iron_initial is 45 times T1. But I'm not given any other information. Wait, but let's think about the next part.

After the iron is placed into the liquid air and heated up to T1, it is quickly taken out and placed into water. So, the liquid air (20g) is at T1, and when it's placed into water (0°C), it will lose heat until it reaches 0°C. So, the heat lost by the liquid air when placed into water is:

m_air_water * c_air_water * (T1 - 0) = 20 g * 4.18 cal/g°C * T1.

Wait, but earlier, when the liquid air was placed into the iron, the air cooled down from T_initial_iron to T1, which is 20g * 0.095 cal/g°C * (T_initial_iron - T1) → that's the heat lost by the liquid air when placed into the iron.

But the liquid air, when placed into the water, will lose heat from T1 to 0. So, the total heat lost by the liquid air is (T_initial_iron - T1) + T1 = T_initial_iron. Wait, but that's the same as before. So, the heat from the liquid air when placed into the iron is T_initial_iron * 20g * 0.095.

Wait, but that's not matching with the equation I had earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, earlier, when the liquid air (mass 20g) was placed into the iron (20g), the air cooled from T_initial_iron to T1. The heat lost by the iron is m_iron c_iron (T_initial_iron - T1). The heat lost by the air is m_air c_air (T_initial_iron - T1). So, the equation is:

m_iron c_iron (T_initial_iron - T1) = m_air c_air (T_initial_iron - T1).

Since m_iron = m_air, this implies that T_initial_iron = T1. But that can't be correct because the iron would not be cooling down. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the heat exchange between the iron and the liquid air, and then the heat exchange between the liquid air and the water.

So, the first step is the liquid air (20g) is placed into the iron (20g) and they reach thermal equilibrium at T1. The heat lost by the iron is equal to the heat gained by the liquid air. So:

m_iron c_iron (T_initial_iron - T1) = m_air_water c_air_water (T1 - 0).

Because the liquid air gains heat from 0°C to T1°C, and the iron loses heat from T_initial_iron to T1°C.

So, equation:

20g * 0.095 (T_iron_initial - T1) = 20g * 4.18 (T1 - 0).

Simplify:

0.095 (T_iron_initial - T1) = 4.18 T1.

Multiply out:

0.095 T_iron_initial - 0.095 T1 = 4.18 T1.

Bring terms together:

0.095 T_iron_initial = 4.18 T1 + 0.095 T1.

Factor T1:

0.095 T_iron_initial = T1 (4.18 + 0.095) = T1 (4.275).

So,

T_iron_initial = (4.275 / 0.095) T1.

Which is:

4.275 / 0.095 = 45.

So,

T_iron_initial = 45 T1.

Hmm, that means the initial temperature of the liquid air is 45 times the temperature of the iron. That seems a bit high, but possible.

Now, when the liquid air (20g) is at T1 and is quickly placed into water (0°C), it will lose heat and cool down from T1 to 0. The heat lost by the liquid air is m_air_water * c_air_water * (T1 - 0) = 20g * 4.18 * T1.

But when the liquid air is placed into water, it also loses heat when cooling from T1 to 0. So, the heat lost is:

Q = m_air_water * c_air_water * T1.

But wait, when the liquid air is placed into water, it's at T1, and water is at 0°C. So, the air is cooling from T1 to 0, and the water is warming from 0°C to some T2. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the temperature of the water after being placed into air, so perhaps we can ignore that.

So, the heat lost by the liquid air when placed into water is Q = m_air_water * c_air_water * (T1 - 0) = 20g * 4.18 cal/g°C * T1.

But the heat lost by the liquid air when placed into the iron is Q1 = m_air_water * c_air_water * (T_iron_initial - T1).

So, the total heat lost by the liquid air is Q1 + Q = 20g * 4.18 (T_iron_initial - T1) + 20g * 4.18 T1.

Which simplifies to:

20 *4.18 [ (T_iron_initial - T1) + T1 )

= 20 *4.18 * T_iron_initial.

So, the total heat lost by the liquid air is 20 *4.18 * T_iron_initial.

Now, the ice formed on the liquid air (20g) has a specific heat of L = 80 cal/g. So, the heat required to melt all the ice is Q_melt = m_ice * L = 5.22 g * 80 cal/g = 417.6 cal.

But wait, the ice is formed on the liquid air, so the heat from the liquid air is used to melt the ice. So, the heat from the liquid air (when placed into the ice) is 20g *4.18 cal/g°C * T_iron_initial.

Wait, no, the ice is formed when the liquid air (20g) is placed into liquid air (20g), which brings T_initial_iron down to T1. Then, when the liquid air is placed into water, it cools to 0. So, the heat from the liquid air when placed into the ice is 20g *4.18 cal/g°C * T_iron_initial.

Wait, but that's the heat from the liquid air when it was at T_iron_initial. But when the liquid air is placed into the ice, it's at T1, so the heat lost by the liquid air when placed into the ice is (T_iron_initial - T1) *20g *4.18.

But I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The liquid air (20g) is at T1 when placed into the iron. When the liquid air is placed into the ice, it will lose heat until it reaches 0°C. So, the heat lost by the liquid air when placed into the ice is (T1 - 0) *20g *4.18.

But wait, when the liquid air is placed into the ice, it's at T1, so the heat lost is 20g *4.18 cal/g°C * (T1 - 0) = 20 *4.18 * T1.

Now, when the liquid air is placed into the water, it will lose heat from T1 to 0. So, the heat lost by the liquid air is 20g *4.18 * T1.

So, the total heat lost by the liquid air is 20g *4.18 * T1 (when placed into ice) + 20g *4.18 * T1 (when placed into water) = 20 *4.18 * T1 *2 = 2*20*4.18*T1 = 163.2 T1.

Wait, but that can't be right because the ice is formed when the liquid air is placed into liquid air, and then placed into water. So, the heat from the liquid air when placed into the ice is (T_iron_initial - T1) *20 *4.18, and when placed into water is T1 *20 *4.18.

So, the total heat lost by the liquid air is (T_iron_initial - T1)*20*4.18 + T1 *20*4.18 = T_iron_initial *20*4.18.

So, the heat lost by the liquid air is 20 *4.18 * T_iron_initial.

This heat is used to melt the ice. So, the heat provided by the liquid air is (Q_melt = m_ice * L).

So, 20 *4.18 * T_iron_initial = m_ice * L.

Wait, but we don't know T_iron_initial yet. So, perhaps I should write an equation based on the heat exchange.

Wait, but we also know that the heat lost by the iron is equal to the heat gained by the air. So, when the iron is placed into the liquid air (20g), the air cools from T_iron_initial to T1, and the iron cools from T_iron_initial to T1.

The equation is: m_iron c_iron (T_iron_initial - T1) = m_air_water c_air_water (T1 - 0).

Which we had earlier.

So, 20 *0.095*(T_iron_initial - T1) = 20*4.18*T1.

So, 0.095*(T_iron_initial - T1) = 4.18*T1.

Which leads to T_iron_initial - T1 = (4.18 / 0.095) T1.

Compute 4.18 / 0.095 → 45.

So, T_iron_initial - T1 = 45 T1.

So, T_iron_initial = 46 T1.

Wait, that's different from before.

Wait, because 4.18 / 0.095 is 45, right?

Yes, because 0.095 *45 = 4.275, which is more than 4.18. Wait, that's a problem. Let me compute 4.18 /0.095.

4.18 ÷ 0.095.

Well, 0.095 times 45 is 4.275, which is more than 4.18. So, 45 is 4.275, which is higher than 4.18, so 4.18 is 45 × (4.18/45) → to find how much is 4.18 over 0.095.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 4.18 ÷0.095.

Let me compute 4.18 ÷0.095:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100:

418 ÷ 9.5.

Compute 9.5 × 44 = 418.

So, 4.18 ÷0.095 = 44.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because 0.095 ×44 = 4.18.

So, 4.18 ÷0.095 =44.

Ah, okay, that's correct. So, T_iron_initial - T1 =44 T1.

So, T_iron_initial =45 T1.

So, the initial temperature of the liquid air is 45 times T1.

Now, when the liquid air (20g) is at T1 and is placed into water, it cools from T1 to 0, losing heat Q =20g *4.18 cal/g°C * T1 = 83.6 T1 cal.

But when the liquid air is placed into the ice, it's at T1 and needs to lose heat to reach 0, so the heat lost is 83.6 T1 cal.

But when the liquid air is placed into the ice, it's also losing heat when it's placed into the air. Wait, no, the liquid air is at T1, and when it's placed into the ice, it loses heat from T1 to 0. So, that heat comes from the ice.

Wait, but the ice is formed when the liquid air (20g) is placed into liquid air (20g), which brings T_initial_iron down to T1. Then, when the liquid air is placed into ice, it's at T1, so it loses heat to reach 0. The heat lost is 83.6 T1.

But the ice was formed from the liquid air, so the heat from the liquid air is used to melt the ice. So, the heat provided by the liquid air is Q =83.6 T1 cal.

The heat required to melt the ice is Q_melt = m_ice * L =5.22 g *80 cal/g =417.6 cal.

So, 83.6 T1 =417.6.

So, T1=417.6 /83.6.

Compute 417.6 ÷83.6.

Well, 83.6 ×5=418, which is just a little more than 417.6. So, 417.6 is 5 ×83.6 -0.4.

So, 5 ×83.6=418, so 417.6=418 -0.4=5×83.6 -0.4.

So, 417.6=5×83.6 -0.4.

So, 417.6 ÷83.6 =5 - (0.4 ÷83.6).

Compute 0.4 ÷83.6≈0.00479.

So, 5 -0.00479≈4.9952.

So, T1≈4.9952°C.

So, approximately 5°C.

But let me compute it more precisely.

Compute 417.6 ÷83.6.

Let me do the division step by step.

83.6 ×5=418.0.

So, 83.6 ×4.9952=?

Let me compute 4.9952 ×83.6.

4 ×83.6=334.4.

0.9952 ×83.6.

Well, 0.9952 ×83.6.

Compute 83.6 ×0.9952.

83.6 ×0.9952=?

Well, 83.6 × (1 -0.0048)=83.6 - (83.6 ×0.0048).

Compute 83.6 ×0.0048.

83.6 ×0.004=0.3344.

83.6 ×0.0008=0.06688.

So, total 0.3344+0.06688=0.39936.

So, 83.6 ×0.9952=83.6 -0.39936=83.20064.

So, 4.9952 ×83.6=334.4 +83.20064=417.60064.

Which is equal to 417.60064.

So, 4.9952 ×83.6=417.60064, which is just a tiny bit more than 417.6.

So, 4.9952 ×83.6=417.60064.

Which is 417.60064 -417.6=0.00064 more than 417.6.

So, to get 417.6, we need to find how much less than 4.9952 is needed to get 417.6.

So, the adjustment is delta = (417.60064 -417.6)/(83.6) =0.00064/83.6≈7.68e-5.

So, the adjustment is approximately 7.68e-5.

So, T1=4.9952 -7.68e-5≈4.9952 -0.0000768≈4.995123.

So, approximately 4.995°C.

So, T1≈4.995°C.

So, approximately 5°C.

But let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 417.6 ÷83.6.

We can write this as 417.6 ÷83.6 = (417.6 ×100) ÷(83.6 ×100) =41760 ÷8360.

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 20: 41760 ÷20=2088; 8360 ÷20=418.

So, 2088 ÷418.

Now, 418 ×5=2090, which is just 2 more than 2088.

So, 2088 ÷418=4.995294...

So, approximately 4.995294°C.

So, about 4.995°C.

So, T1≈4.995°C.

So, the initial temperature of the liquid air is approximately 4.995°C.

So, the ice forms when the liquid air is at T1, and the heat required to melt it is Q_melt = m_ice * L.

Which is 5.22 g ×80 cal/g=417.6 cal.

So, the heat provided by the liquid air when placed into the ice is Q =83.6 T1 cal.

So, 83.6 T1 =417.6 → T1=417.6/83.6=4.995°C.

So, the initial temperature of the liquid air is approximately 4.995°C.

So, to the nearest degree, that's 5°C.

So, the ice forms when the liquid air is at approximately 5°C.

So, the temperature of the liquid air is 4.995°C, which is about 5°C, and the ice forms at about 5°C.

So, the answer is the initial temperature of the liquid air is approximately 5°C.
</think>

The liquid air (20g) forms ice when placed into liquid air (20g), and heat is exchanged during this process. The ice is formed when the liquid air is at the same temperature as the liquid air formed from the initial liquid air. When the liquid air is placed into the ice and then into the water, it cools from its initial temperature to 0°C. The heat lost by the liquid air when placed into the ice and then into the water is used to melt the ice. The ice forms when the heat provided by the liquid air equals the heat required to melt the ice.

1. **Equation for heat transfer between the liquid air and the ice:**
   \[
   20 \times 4.18 \times T_1 = m_{\text{ice}} \times L
   \]
   where:
   - \(T_1 = 4.995 \, \text{°C}\) (temperature of the liquid air when placed into the ice)
   - \(m_{\text{ice}} = 5.22 \, \text{g}\)
   - \(L = 80 \, \text{cal/g}\)

2. **Substituting the values:**
   \[
   20 \times 4.18 \times 4.995 = 5.22 \times 80
   \]
   \[
   417.6 = 417.6
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   The initial temperature of the liquid air is approximately \(4.995 \, \text{°C}\), which is about \(5 \, \text{°C}\). The ice forms when the liquid air is at this temperature.
