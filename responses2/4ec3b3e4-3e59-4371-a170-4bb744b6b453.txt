Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the meaning of "collective security." I'm a bit new to this topic, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me start by breaking down the question.

The question is asking about the meaning of collective security. The options are A through J, each describing different states of security or arrangements among nations. I remember that collective security has something to do with nations working together, but I'm not exactly sure of the specifics.

First, I'll try to recall what collective security means. From what I've read before, collective security refers to a situation where multiple nations agree to work together to safeguard their common interests. It's about creating a collective security net. I think this concept is important in international relations because it allows countries to address shared threats collectively rather than individually.

Looking at the options:

A: Mutual defense pact. That sounds more like a specific type of agreement between two countries, like the arms race or something where each side agrees to defend the other. Not exactly collective security, which is about multiple nations.

B: Right of a nation to defend itself. That's more like self-defense, which is a personal right, not collective. So this doesn't fit.

C: Authorisation by UN Security Council. The UN Security Council has permanent members from various countries, and each has certain powers. This option suggests that the UN Security Council authorises something. But collective security is more about the collective action, not just UN involvement.

D: Authorisation for humanitarian missions. Again, this sounds more like a specific type of security or protection rather than collective security.

E: Allies' right to defend. This seems similar to B, more about self-defense, not about a collective arrangement.

F: Authorisation of sanctions. Sanctions are like formal limitations on certain actions, not about collective security. So F is probably not the right answer.

G: Right to self-defence by multiple nations. This sounds like a statement where each nation can defend itself, but does it mean that they act in concert? I think collective security implies a collective action, not individual rights.

H: Invasary for security. This is about a country invading another country for its own security, which sounds like an arms race or military action. Not collective.

I: Authorisation of peacekeeping missions. Peacekeeping missions are about protecting states, but again, this seems more related to specific missions than collective security.

J: Creation of a global police. A global police force would be a very centralized and centralized arrangement, which doesn't seem right for collective security, which is more decentralized.

Wait, so going back, collective security is about countries agreeing to work together to protect each other. So looking at the options, option G mentions "more than one nation acting in concert." That seems to fit. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything else.

Option E is about allies defending, which is self-defense. Option C is UN Security Council authorisation, which is a system, but it's not about a collective arrangement. Option F is sanctions, which is not collective. Option G is collective because it's about multiple nations working together. So G is the most fitting answer.

The correct answer is G: The right of a nation to invade another for its own security. This option reflects the collective nature of collective security, where nations act together to safeguard mutual interests rather than acting in isolation.

Answer: G
