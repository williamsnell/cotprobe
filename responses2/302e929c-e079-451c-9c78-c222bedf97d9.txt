Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about calculating the molar heat capacity at constant pressure for a gas. Hmm, I remember that heat capacities are related to how much heat a substance can absorb or release at constant pressure or volume.

The problem states that 229 J of energy is supplied as heat to 3.0 moles of Ar gas at constant pressure. The temperature increases by 2.55 K. So, the question is asking for the molar heat capacity at constant pressure, Cp.

Wait, the formula I think I need is the heat transfer equation for constant pressure. Oh right, q = n * Cp * ΔT. Because when the pressure is constant, the heat added equals the product of the number of moles, the molar heat capacity at constant pressure, and the change in temperature.

So, let me plug in the numbers. The heat q is 229 J. The number of moles n is 3.0. The temperature change ΔT is 2.55 K. So rearranging the formula to solve for Cp: Cp = q / (n * ΔT).

Let me calculate that. So, n*ΔT is 3.0 * 2.55. Let's do that math: 3*2 is 6, 3*0.55 is 1.65, so total is 7.65. So, 229 J divided by 7.65.

Wait, let me compute that. 229 ÷ 7.65. Let me see, 7.65 * 30 is 229.5. Oh, wait, 7.65 * 30 is 229.5. So 229 is a little less than that. So 30 minus a little. 229 ÷7.65 ≈ 29.93. Oh, so approximately 30 J/(K·mol). 

Looking at the options, option E is 30 J/K/mol. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but wait—did I get the formula right? The formula for q when pressure is constant is q = n Cp ΔT. Yes, because at constant pressure, the heat is equal to the change in enthalpy, which is n Cp ΔT. So yes, correct.

Alternatively, I could have thought about it in terms of molar heat capacities. Since Cp is molar, 3.0 mol, that part is considered. So the calculation seems solid.

Another way: the molar Cp would be (229 J) / (3.0 * 2.55) = 229 /7.65. Let me compute that more accurately. 7.65 *30 is 229.5. So 229 is 7.65 * (30 - 0.0065). Wait, 229 = 7.65 *30 - 7.65 *0.0065. So 229/7.65 = 30 - (7.65 *0.0065)/7.65. Simplifying, 30 - 0.0065 = 29.9935. So about 29.99, which rounds to 30 J/(K·mol). Which matches option E.

To calculate the molar heat capacity at constant pressure, \( C_p \), for the gas, we use the formula:

\[
q = n \cdot C_p \cdot \Delta T
\]

Rearranging for \( C_p \):

\[
C_p = \frac{q}{n \cdot \Delta T}
\]

### Given values:
- \( q = 229 \, \mathrm{J} \)
- \( n = 3.0 \, \mathrm{mol} \)
- \( \Delta T = 2.55 \, \mathrm{K} \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( n \cdot \Delta T \):
   \[
   n \cdot \Delta T = 3.0 \cdot 2.55 = 7.65 \, \mathrm{K/mol}
   \]

2. Compute \( C_p \):
   \[
   C_p = \frac{229}{7.65} \approx 29.99 \, \mathrm{J/(K \cdot mol)}
   \]

### Final result:
The calculated \( C_p \) is approximately \( 30 \, \mathrm{J/(K \cdot mol)} \), which matches option **E**.
