Okay, so I have this question about a sporting event held annually on the Memorial Day weekend. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

First, I need to understand what "Memorial Day" refers to. I know it's a holiday celebrated in the U.S. on July 4th, often marked by red and white decorations. But how does that relate to sports events? Oh, right, there are several major sports events that happen around this time.

Looking at the options provided, I see a list of events like the FIFA World Cup, Stanley Cup Finals, Wimbledon, World Series, etc. The question is asking for an event held annually on that day. 

I remember that the Stanley Cup Finals are a big deal in baseball. It's a World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants. Each year, this series is played in the American League, so it's definitely a major event. It's known as the "International Series" but I think it's still called the Stanley Cup Finals each year.

The other options: FIFA World Cup is every four years, Wimbledon in even-numbered years, World Series every year, the World Series is a general major event. The Masters is a golf tournament, known as the "World Championship," held every even-numbered year. The Iditarod is a cold dog race, held in January. The Daytona 500 is a stock car race, held in July, so that's not it. The Super Bowl is every four years, held in January or February. The Kentucky Derby is a horse race, held each year on the first Saturday of March. The Indianapolis 500 is another stock car race, held in late May or early June. 

So, the options that fit are B (Stanley Cup Finals), D (World Series), and H (The Masters). But the question asks for an event held annually. The World Series is every year, so that's definitely one. The Stanley Cup Finals are held every year, as it's a World Series in baseball. The Masters is every four years. 

Wait, but the question is about a single event. Let me think again. The World Series is a major event held every year. The Stanley Cup Finals are played each year in a different league, but they are still held annually. The Masters is every four years. So, both B and D are annual events. But the question is asking for an event held annually, so which one is it?

Wait, the options don't have "Both B and D" as an option. I need to pick one. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: FIFA World Cup
B: Stanley Cup Finals
C: Wimbledon
D: World Series
E: Iditarod
F: Daytona 500
G: Super Bowl
H: The Masters
I: Kentucky Derby
J: Indianapolis 500

So, the World Series is option D, which is a major event held every year. The Stanley Cup Finals are option B, which is a World Series in baseball, also held every year. So both B and D are correct in terms of being held annually. But the question is a single choice. Are there any other options I might have missed?

Wait, the question is about what event is held annually on Memorial Day weekend. The World Series is held in the spring, and the Stanley Cup Finals are in the fall. So, the World Series is on the weekend around July 3-4, which is around Memorial Day (July 4). So the World Series is held on the weekend around the same time as Memorial Day. That makes it the correct answer.

Alternatively, the Stanley Cup Finals are held in the fall, but they occur every year. So both are correct, but the World Series is a major event held annually, so the correct answer is D: World Series.

The World Series is held annually on the Memorial Day weekend, as it is a major event in baseball each year. 

Answer: D
