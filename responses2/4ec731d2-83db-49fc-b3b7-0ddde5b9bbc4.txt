Question:

Hall Co. purchased a machine on January 1 at a cost of $140000. The machine had an estimated useful life of eight years and a salvage value of $60000. Hall chose to depreciate the machine using the double- declining balance method. What was the carrying amount of the machine in Hall's balance sheet at the end of its second year of operations?

Options:

A: $60,000
B: $70,000
C: $61,250
D: $100,000
E: $85,000
F: $78,750
G: 80000
H: $90,000
I: $95,000
J: $110,000

Okay, so I’ve got this question about depreciation methods, specifically the double-declining balance method. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

So, Hall Co. bought a machine for $140,000. The useful life is eight years, and the salvage value is $60,000. They’re using the double-declining balance method. I need to find the carrying amount at the end of the second year.

Wait, I remember that the double-declining balance method is an accelerated depreciation method. So, it's not the straight-line method where you spread the cost evenly over the useful life. Instead, you apply a higher depreciation rate each year.

First, I think I need to figure out the depreciation rate. The straight-line rate would be 1/8, which is 12.5% per year. But double-declining is double that, so 25% per year. Oh wait, but sometimes people use straight-line first and then switch to DDB, but in this case, since it's the first year, maybe they just apply the method each year.

So, the depreciation each year is based on the book value at the beginning of the year multiplied by the rate. Let's see.

First, the depreciation for the first year. The initial cost is $140,000. So, 25% of 140,000 is 35,000. So, at the end of year 1, the machine's book value is 140,000 - 35,000 = $105,000.

Now, year 2. The depreciation rate is still 25% of the book value at the start of the year. So, 25% of $105,000 is 26,250. So, the depreciation for year 2 is $26,250. Subtracting that from the book value at the start of year 2 ($105,000) gives a book value of $105,000 - $26,250 = $78,750 at the end of year 2.

Wait, but I should double-check if that's correct. Let me go through the steps again.

First year:
Depreciation rate is 2 * (1/8) = 25% per year.
Depreciation: 140,000 * 25% = 35,000.
Carrying amount after year 1: 140,000 -35,000=105,000.

Second year:
Depreciation is 25% of 105,000. 105,000 * 0.25 =26,250.
Carrying amount after year 2: 105,000 -26,250 =78,750.

So the answer should be option F, which is $78,750.

Looking at the options, F is 78,750. So the correct answer is F.

To determine the carrying amount of the machine at the end of the second year using the double-declining balance method, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the depreciation rate**: The double-declining balance method uses twice the straight-line rate. The useful life is eight years, so the straight-line rate is 1/8 = 12.5%. Doubling this gives a depreciation rate of 25% per year.

2. **First year depreciation**: Depreciation is 25% of the machine's cost ($140,000). 
   - Depreciation: \( 140,000 \times 0.25 = 35,000 \).
   - Book value at the end of year 1: \( 140,000 - 35,000 = 105,000 \).

3. **Second year depreciation**: Depreciation is 25% of the book value at the start of the year ($105,000).
   - Depreciation: \( 105,000 \times 0.25 = 26,250 \).
   - Book value at the end of year 2: \( 105,000 - 26,250 = 78,750 \).

Thus, the carrying amount at the end of the second year is $78,750.

**Answer: F**
