Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about an Hohokam borrowing a practice from Mesoamerican culture. Hmm, let me break it down. I remember that Hohokam is an ancient American Indian tribe, right? And they had various cultural practices.

The question is asking about a specific practice borrowed by them from Mesoamian culture. Mesoamians were the Incas, I think. So they had things like the khipus, their writing system, and a calendar based on their observations of the stars.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A is the use of a calendar system. That makes sense because the Mesoamans had calendars, probably tracking celestial events. The Hohokams might have borrowed this for their own practices. 

Option B is mummification for the dead. I don't recall Hohokams being mummified; that's more associated with other cultures, maybe the Maya or the Inca. So probably not B.

Option C is the ritual consumption of maize beer. That doesn't ring a bell for Hohokams. They didn't use beer, and I don't think they had a beer-based tradition.

Option D is construction of underground dwellings. While the Hohokams did build structures, I'm not sure if that's a Mesoamerican practice. I think their main focus was more on rituals and medicine rather than built structures.

Option E is ritual human sacrifice. That sounds a lot like the ancient Greeks, who often sacrifice for religious reasons. Hohokams didn't do that, so E might not be right.

Option F is use of cacao in religious ceremonies. Cacao isn't a common ingredient in Hohokam rituals, and I don't know if they used it. Maybe some, but I don't think they borrowed from Mesoamian cacao.

Option G is playing ritual ball games. I'm not sure about this one. Ball games are a traditional part of many cultures, but I don't remember Hohokams specifically borrowing from Mesoamian ball games. They might have some, but I might be mixing it up with another group.

Option H is construction of stepped pyramids. Hohokams did build stepped pyramids, known as pyramids of the Sun. So if Hohokams borrowed something from Mesoamian, it might be their pyramids. Alternatively, another Mesoamerican structure could be it.

Wait, which Mesoamerican was known for stepped pyramids? I think the Incas were known for their stepped pyramids, which were used in their religious ceremonies. The Hohokams might have borrowed that for their rituals.

So putting it together: the Hohokams borrowed the use of a calendar system (A) from Mesoamians. But wait, another thoughtâ€”pyramids of the Sun are a specific Mesoamerican structure. So the question is about a practice borrowed from Mesoamians. So if the Hohokams used stepped pyramids, that's a Mesoamerican structure. But I'm not sure if Hohokams were the ones building them.

Alternatively, another Mesoamerican is the Maya, which also had stepped pyramids. But I'm not sure about the Hohokams specifically. Let me think about the options again.

The question asks which practice Hohokam "borrowed" from Mesoamians. If the Mesoamans had a calendar system, then Hohokams might have borrowed that. But I'm not sure if that's a practice they had. Alternatively, maybe it's the use of a specific ritual item, like a ritual beer, but I don't think Hohokams had that.

Wait, another angle: the Hohokam's ritual beer is called kapa-kapa. The Mesoamans had a khipu, which was a string of beads, used for counting. Could the Hohokams have borrowed a similar counting system? But I don't think that's listed as an option. 

Looking back at the options, only A and H involve elements from Mesoamians. So perhaps the Hohokams borrowed the calendar system (A) from Mesoamian, as that's a foundational Mesoamerican concept. Alternatively, if the Mesoamans did have a ritual beer, but I don't think that's an option.

Another thought: the Mesoamans had a calendar system, and the Hohokams might have borrowed that to track time in their rituals. So option A is about a calendar system.

Alternatively, if it's the use of a ritual beer, but that's not an option. So I think the answer is A: use of a calendar system based on celestial bodies.

The Hohokam tribe, an ancient American Indian group, is known for their intricate rituals and practices. Among their practices, the use of a calendar system based on celestial bodies (A) stands out as a strong candidate. Mesoamian culture, particularly the Incas, had a well-established calendar system that they used to track celestial events, such as the movement of the stars. This system likely influenced the Hohokams to borrow it for their rituals. 

Other options can be ruled out: the Mesoamans used a calendar for their calendar-based rituals, and the Hohokams did not exhibit practices associated with mummification, cacao, or ritual ball games. They primarily focused on building structures like pyramids, which are also Mesoamerican constructs. Thus, the Hohokam borrowing from Mesoamian culture is most closely associated with the calendar system.
