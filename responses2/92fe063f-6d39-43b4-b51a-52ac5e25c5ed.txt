Options:

C: A demand influenced by demographic changes in the population
D: A demand that decreases with the increase of product demand
E: A demand that creates new products
F: A demand for goods that are considered luxury items

Okay, so I've got this question about derived demand. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that there are different types of demand. Let me think. Wait, I think derived demand has something to do with how the demand for one good is related to the demand for another good.

So, derived demand is when the demand for a factor of production or a product comes from the demand for the final product. Like, if I want to buy more cars, the demand for cars isn't just from car buyers directly; it's also because they're used in other production processes. So, the factor demand is derived from the final demand.

Looking at the options, option I says a demand derived from the demand for a final product. That sounds right. The other options might be more general or incorrect. Option F talks about luxury items, which is more about demand characteristics than demand type. Option E is about new products, which I think is more about supply or supply and demand dynamics. Option G is about complementary products, which is about how two goods are used together, not directly about demand being derived.

Option A is about weather and demand, which I think is more of an environmental demand or perhaps related to weather services, not directly a type of demand. Option B says it's directly proportional to supply, which is the law of demand. The law is about quantity demanded inversely related to price, not about the type of demand. Option C is about demographic changes, which affects demand for goods, but that's more of a demand factor influenced by a change in population, not the type itself.

Option D says it decreases with product demand. I remember that maybe this is about the law of demand, where as quantity demanded decreases, price increases. So that's about how quantity demanded is related to price, not the type of demand.

Option J is a substitute, which is about production instead of demand. So the question is about the type of demand, not the production aspect.

So putting it all together, I think option I is correct. It directly answers what derived demand is, explaining it's about the demand for a product coming from another product's demand.

The correct answer is **I: A demand which is derived from the demand for a final product**. Derived demand refers to the demand for factors of production or products that arises from the demand for another good or service. This is distinct from direct demand, which is about the quantity of a good that consumers are willing to buy. 

**Answer: I**
