Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about determining the likelihood that employees will remain on their job for a long period. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking for a measure that would indicate how likely an employee is to stay with their job. So I'm looking for a factor that relates to job satisfaction or retention. Let me recall what I know about employee retention.

Job satisfaction is often a big factor. If employees are happy and fulfilled with their jobs, they're more likely to stay. So options like motivation, job satisfaction, and job satisfaction itself are probably candidates. Let me look at the options again.

Option G is job satisfaction, which directly relates to job retention. That makes sense because if someone is satisfied with their role, they're less likely to leave.

What about other options? Let's see. Option C is motivation, which can be about both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. But I think the main measure for retention is job satisfaction. So even if motivation is high, if they're not satisfied with the job, they might leave anyway.

Option D is previous employment history. That's about how long they've been in their current role, which relates to tenure but not directly to retention likelihood. It's more about stability within the company, not necessarily leaving.

Option F is ambition. That's more about future goals, which might influence retention indirectly by affecting career growth, but it's not the primary measure of retention itself.

Option J is intelligence. That's more about individual capabilities but doesn't directly tie into job satisfaction or retention.

Options like educational background (H) or physical health (I) are more about individual traits that might affect job performance but aren't the main determinant of retention.

So the main factor would be job satisfaction. Therefore, the correct answer should be G: job satisfaction.

The measure that most directly indicates the likelihood of long-term job retention is job satisfaction. 

Answer: G: job satisfaction
