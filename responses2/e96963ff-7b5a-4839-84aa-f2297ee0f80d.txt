Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about allergies and the hygiene hypothesis. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a reduction in family size and improved sanitary conditions have led to an increase in allergic conditions. The 'hygiene hypothesis' is mentioned, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the hygiene hypothesis, or the public health hypothesis, suggests that poor hygiene and bad environmental conditions contribute to the spread or development of illnesses, including allergies. Allergies often come from exposure to pollen, dust, or other allergens.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one that aligns with the idea that good hygiene (like sanitization) reduces the risk of developing allergies.

Option A: Living on a working farm will increase atopic diseases. I'm not sure about this. Farm living might have issues like poor air quality, which could contribute to allergies. But if it's about hygiene, maybe it's not the main point.

Option B: Particular care in breast feeding in high-risk infants. That sounds more about breast feeding practices and possibly infections, but I'm not certain how this ties to the hygiene hypothesis.

Option C: Living on a working farm helps reduce atopic diseases. The farm could have poor hygiene practices, so maybe this is suggesting that better living conditions (like more sanitization) help. So this might be related.

Option D: Antibiotics reduce allergies. Antibiotics are used for infections, not allergies. So this seems unrelated.

Option E: Living in urban areas reduces atopic diseases. Urban areas can have high allergens, so maybe poor hygiene there would cause more allergies. But if it's the hypothesis that says good hygiene reduces them, then urban areas might not be the answer.

Option F: Antiseptic swipes reduce allergies. Antiseptic swipes are a form of good hygiene, so this makes sense. It's a specific action that would help, so this could fit.

Option G: Exposure to allergens early in childhood increases allergies. That's a common point, but the question is about the hypothesis, not about the cause.

Option H: Staying in sanitized environments reduces atopic diseases. This directly ties to the hypothesis, as it's about reducing exposure to allergens through good hygiene.

Option I: Breastfeeding to avoid allergies. Again, about practices that could lead to infections, not directly about hygiene.

Option J: Probiotics increase allergies. Probiotics are bacteria, which can cause infections. So this is about causing the issue, not the hypothesis.

So, the options that relate directly to hygiene being a factor are F, H, and C.

Wait, but the question says the hypothesis suggests that. So what's the main point of the hypothesis? The hypothesis is that poor hygiene (like not washing hands properly) leads to more infections, including allergies.

So, if living in a clean environment helps, it reduces the risk. So which options are about that? F is using antiseptic swipes, which is a form of hygiene. H is about living in highly sanitized environments.

Wait, the question is asking which option suggests that living in a more sanitized environment reduces atopic diseases. So the correct statement would be either F or H.

But looking at the options, the question is about what the hypothesis suggests. So the hypothesis is probably that living in clean environments reduces the spread of allergies.

So, looking at the options, option H states that staying in highly sanitized environments reduces the development of atopic diseases. That seems to fit.

Option F is about antiseptic swipes, which is a type of good hygiene, but without specifying the environment.

So, the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The question pertains to the hygiene hypothesis, which suggests that poor hygiene and environmental factors contribute to the spread or development of conditions like allergies. The correct answer must align with this hypothesis, indicating that living in highly sanitized environments reduces the risk of atopic diseases.

- **Option H** states that living in highly sanitized environments reduces the development of atopic diseases, which directly supports the hypothesis.
- Other options either discuss practices unrelated to hygiene or unrelated hypotheses.

ANSWER: H
