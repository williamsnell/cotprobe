Okay, so I've got this question about existential neurosis and logotherapy. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I need to break it down. Let's see, what do I remember about these terms?

Existential neurosis, if I recall correctly, is a term that combines elements from philosophy and psychology. I think it's related to the idea of feeling so high that you can't manage reality. It's like someone who's so overwhelmed with happiness that they don't realize where they are or what they're missing. So it's more about the mental state than actual physical issues.

Then there's logotherapy. I'm not too sure about this one, but I think it's a type of therapy. I remember hearing terms like psychoanalysis before. Wait, psychoanalysis involves a lot of exploration of the unconscious, right? So logotherapy might be a form of that. I think it's about helping people process their thoughts and feelings. But I'm not entirely sure how it's applied. Maybe it's used to help people find meaning or purpose in their lives.

Looking at the options now, option H says that existential neurosis is a disorder characterized by feeling meaningless, loneliness, bored, etc., and that logotherapy helps the patient find a purpose. That sounds right, but let me check the others.

Option I says existential neurosis is about excessive euphoria and optimism. That doesn't sound right because euphoria is the oppositeâ€”excessive happiness. So I can rule out I.

Option J talks about a diet to enhance cognitive function. That doesn't fit either. Logotherapy is about therapy, not diet.

Option C is about physical health. That's more about logotherapy, as I thought earlier. So C is probably not the right answer.

Option D is about psychoanalysis. I think logotherapy is more of a therapeutic approach rather than a specific type of psychoanalysis. So D might not be correct.

Option E says it's a physical issue from lack of exercise. That's more of an acute physical problem, not a mental state. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F says it's about heightened senses and creativity. That's a positive trait, but I don't think it's called existential neurosis.

Option A is about extreme sports. That doesn't fit the definition of existential neurosis.

Option B talks about extreme happiness and contentment. Again, that's the opposite of what existential neurosis is about.

So the remaining options are H and G. Let's see: H says existential neurosis is a disorder with those symptoms, and logotherapy helps find purpose. That seems to fit. G says logotherapy is a group therapy emphasizing social interaction. No, logotherapy is a type of therapy, not a group therapy. So G is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is **H**. This option accurately describes existential neurosis as a disorder characterized by a state of feeling meaningless, loneliness, and apathy, along with a lack of direction, and highlights logotherapy as a therapeutic approach that helps find a purpose in living. 

Answer: H
