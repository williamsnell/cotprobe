Okay, so I've got this question about determining the sample size needed for a poll. Let me read through it again. The question is about a presidential election poll, and they want to estimate the proportion of voters who favor candidate A, denoted by p. The problem is about figuring out how large a sample to take so that the maximum error in the estimate is 0.03 with 95% confidence. 

Hmm. I remember that for estimating a proportion, the formula for the margin of error (which is the maximum error) is something like E = z*(sqrt((p*(1-p))/n)), where E is the margin of error, z is the z-score corresponding to the confidence level, p is the sample proportion, and n is the sample size. 

Wait, but in this case, since we're trying to find the sample size, n, and we don't know p, I think we have to use a conservative estimate for p. I remember that the maximum value of p*(1-p) occurs when p is 0.5, because 0.5*0.5 is 0.25, which is the highest. So using p = 0.5 gives the largest possible value for the variance, which in turn gives the largest possible E for a given n, so for our purposes, we can use p = 0.5 to find the maximum possible sample size needed. 

So the formula then becomes E = z * sqrt((0.25)/n). We know E is 0.03, and the confidence level is 95%, which corresponds to a z-score of about 1.96 (since 95% confidence is two-tailed, so 2.5% in each tail, so that's 1.96). 

Plugging in the numbers: 0.03 = 1.96 * sqrt(0.25/n). Let me solve for n. First, divide both sides by 1.96:

sqrt(0.25/n) = 0.03 / 1.96 ≈ 0.01530612245

Now, square both sides:

0.25/n = (0.01530612245)^2 ≈ 0.000234375

So, n = 0.25 / 0.000234375. Let me compute that. 

0.25 divided by 0.000234375. Hmm. Let me compute 0.25 / 0.000234375. 

0.000234375 is the same as 23.4375e-5. So, 0.25 / 0.000234375 is equal to (0.25) / (23.4375e-5) = same as (0.25 *1e5) /23.4375. 

0.25 *1e5 = 25,000. So 25,000 /23.4375 ≈ let's calculate that. 

23.4375 goes into 25,000 how many times? Let me compute 23.4375 * 1000 = 23437.5. That's less than 25,000. 

Wait, 23.4375 * 1066 = let's see. 23.4375 *1000=23437.5, 23.4375*66= 1545.375. So 23437.5 +1545.375=25,  (wait, 23437.5 + 1545.375 is 25, 982.875). Hmm, but 25,000 is more than that. Let me try 1066.666... 

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me compute 25,000 divided by 23.4375. 

23.4375 * x = 25,000 → x = 25000 / 23.4375. Let me compute that. 

23.4375 is equal to 23 and 7/16, which is 375/16. So 25000 ÷ (375/16) = 25000 * (16/375). 

25000 *16 = 400,000. Divided by 375: 400,000 ÷ 375. Let me divide step by step. 

375*1000=375,000 → 400,000-375,000=25,000. 

375*66=24,750. 25,000 -24,750=250. 

375*0.666=250. So 1000 +66.666 = 1066.666... So x is 1066.666...

So approximately 1066.666. But n must be an integer, so we round up to the next whole number, which is 1067. So the required sample size is approximately 1067.

Looking at the options, option D is 1068. So that's the answer. 

Wait, but I should double-check if I used the right formula. Oh right, because for proportions, when estimating p, we usually use p=0.5 to get the maximum sample size needed, since p(1-p) is maximum there. So yeah, using 0.5 is the correct approach. 

So yeah, the correct answer is D: 1068.

To determine the required sample size for a poll with a maximum error of 0.03 and 95% confidence, we use the formula for the margin of error:

\[ E = z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \]

where:
- \( E = 0.03 \) (margin of error),
- \( z \) is the z-score for 95% confidence (1.96),
- \( p = 0.5 \) (to maximize the variance, as \( p(1-p) \) is maximum at \( p = 0.5 \)),
- \( n \) is the sample size.

Rearranging for \( n \):

\[ n = \frac{z^2 \cdot p(1-p)}{E^2} \]

Plugging in the values:
- \( z = 1.96 \),
- \( p(1-p) = 0.25 \),
- \( E = 0.03 \),

\[ n = \frac{1.96^2 \cdot 0.25}{0.03^2} \]
\[ n = \frac{3.8416 \cdot 0.25}{0.0009} \]
\[ n = \frac{0.9604}{0.0009} \]
\[ n \approx 1067 \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to 1068. 

**Answer: D (1068)**
