Silylene $\left(\mathrm{SiH}_2\right)$ is a key intermediate in the thermal decomposition of silicon hydrides such as silane $\left(\mathrm{SiH}_4\right)$ and disilane $\left(\mathrm{Si}_2 \mathrm{H}_6\right)$.

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating the standard enthalpy change for a reaction involving silylene. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy change is ΔH, which is the heat absorbed or released in a reaction under constant pressure.

The reaction given is SiH4 (g) → SiH2 (g) + H2 (g). The problem gives me some data: the standard enthalpies of formation for SiH4, SiH2, and Si2H6 are 34.3 kJ/mol, 274 kJ/mol, and 80.3 kJ/mol respectively. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the formation data. Oh right, the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔfH°) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for each of these, SiH4, SiH2, and Si2H6.

The reaction they're asking about is a decomposition of SiH4. Let's think about what ΔfH° represents. If I write the decomposition reaction, it would be the reverse of the formation. For example, SiH2 is formed from Si and H2. So the decomposition equation would be SiH2 (g) → Si (s) + 1/2 H2 (g). 

Wait, but the reaction given is SiH4 → SiH2 + H2. So, that's a two-step process. Let me break it down. The SiH4 decomposes into SiH2 and H2. So, the overall reaction is breaking SiH4 into two simpler species.

I think I need to find the enthalpy change for each of these steps and then add them together. Let's consider each bond breaking and forming.

For the overall reaction, let's write it as:

SiH4(g) → SiH2(g) + H2(g)

Breaking down SiH4 into SiH2 and H2. Let's see the bond structure. SiH4 has a central silicon with four single bonds to H. So, breaking SiH4 into SiH2 and H2: it's breaking one Si-H bond (since SiH4 has one Si-H bond, and SiH2 has two, so one bond breaks). Similarly, H2 is H2, so that's the same as the reactant's H2. Wait, or am I thinking about this the wrong way?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation of each product from their elements. Let's consider the formation of SiH2 and H2 from their elements.

The formation of SiH2 is Si(s) + H2(g) → SiH2(g). The standard enthalpy of formation for SiH2 is given as 274 kJ/mol. So, the reaction Si(s) + H2(g) → SiH2(g) has a ΔHf° of +274 kJ/mol.

Similarly, the formation of H2 is just H2(g), which is its standard state, so ΔHf° is 0.

Now, the overall reaction is the decomposition of SiH4 into SiH2 and H2. Let's think about each bond breaking and forming.

In the formation of SiH2, one Si-H bond is broken. So the bond energy is being subtracted from the reactants. But when the compound forms, it releases energy (exothermic), so the ΔHf is positive.

Wait, the reaction for SiH2 formation is Si(s) + H2(g) → SiH2(g), ΔHf° = +274 kJ/mol. So the enthalpy change for this is positive, which makes sense because I think SiH2 is a higher energy compound than Si and H2.

Now, the overall reaction is the reverse of that. So the decomposition of SiH2 would be SiH2(g) → Si(s) + H2(g), which would have a ΔHf° of -274 kJ/mol.

Similarly, the decomposition of SiH4 into SiH2 and H2 would involve breaking one Si-H bond. Let's think about the bond energies. Breaking a bond releases energy, so the enthalpy change for breaking the bond would be negative. 

Wait, but I'm not given the bond energy values. Hmm, but maybe I can relate the standard enthalpies of formation to the enthalpy change of the reaction as a whole.

The reaction is SiH4 → SiH2 + H2. Let me think about the bond energies of each molecule.

SiH4: Each Si is bonded to four H atoms. So, the structure is Si with four single bonds to H. The SiH2 molecule has one Si-H bond.

So, the bond energy for SiH4 is four times the energy of a Si-H bond. Let me denote the bond energy of Si-H as BE. So SiH4's bond energy (per bond) is 4 * BE.

Similarly, SiH2 has one Si-H bond, so its bond energy is BE.

The formation of SiH2 is Si(s) + H2(g) → SiH2(g). The enthalpy change for this is +274 kJ. 

Now, the enthalpy change for the decomposition of SiH4 into SiH2 and H2 can be found by adding the reactions:

1. SiH4 → SiH2 + H2 (this is the reaction we're interested in)
But wait, another approach: the standard enthalpy change for the reaction can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH = [ΔHf°(products)] - [ΔHf°(reactants)]

But in this case, the products are SiH2 and H2. The reactant is SiH4.

So, let's write the equation:

SiH4 → SiH2 (g) + H2 (g)

The ΔH for this reaction would be ΔHf°(SiH2) + ΔHf°(H2) - ΔHf°(SiH4).

Wait, because the formula is ΔH = sum(ΔHf°(products)) - sum(ΔHf°(reactants)).

So, the products are 1 mole of SiH2 and 1 mole of H2. The reactant is 1 mole of SiH4.

ΔH reaction = [Δf(SiH2) + Δf(H2)] - Δf(SiH4)

Δf(SiH2) is +274 kJ/mol, Δf(H2) is 0 (since it's an element in its standard state). So:

ΔH reaction = (274 + 0) - 34.3 = 240 - 34.3 = 205.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, that would give 205.7 kJ/mol. But looking at the options, option E is 240 kJ/mol. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me reevaluate. Oh wait, no, perhaps I should consider the bond energies because the problem doesn't give any bond energies. Oh, the question says to assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. So, but the data given is the standard enthalpies of formation, not bond energies. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing the standard enthalpy of formation with the enthalpy change for the reaction. Let me think again.

The standard enthalpy of formation for a compound is the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, the reaction for SiH2 is Si(s) + H2(g) → SiH2(g), Δf° = +274 kJ/mol.

The reaction we're looking at is SiH4 → SiH2 + H2.

From the formation data:

Δf°(SiH2) = 274 kJ/mol.

So, to find the overall reaction's ΔH, we can write:

ΔH = [Δf°(SiH2) + Δf°(H2)] - Δf°(SiH4)

So, Δf°(H2) is zero, because hydrogen gas is an element in its standard state.

So, ΔH = (274 + 0) - 34.3 = 240 - 34.3 = 205.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 240, which is higher than this. Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the bond energies. Because the standard enthalpy of formation doesn't account for bond energies; it's just the energy required to form the compound from its elements. So, perhaps I need to use the bond energies to calculate the enthalpy change of the reaction.

So, another approach: calculate the enthalpy change for breaking bonds in SiH4 to form SiH2 and H2.

Let's consider the bond energies.

For SiH4, each Si-H bond has a bond energy. Let's denote the bond energy of Si-H as BE.

So, SiH4 has four Si-H bonds. The total energy for breaking these bonds would be 4 * BE.

When forming SiH2, one Si-H bond is broken. So, the energy released from breaking that bond is -BE.

Similarly, the formation of H2 from H2 (element) doesn't release any energy because it's already in the standard state.

So, the overall enthalpy change would be:

ΔH = (enthalpy change for breaking Si-H bonds) + (Δf° of SiH2) - (Δf° of SiH4)

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the overall process involves breaking one bond in SiH4 and forming two bonds in the products.

Wait, no. Let's think about the reaction again.

The reaction is SiH4 → SiH2 + H2.

So, SiH4 has four Si-H bonds. When it breaks down, the SiH2 molecule has one Si-H bond, and H2 is the same as the reactant.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the bond energies to find the enthalpy change.

Let me think: the enthalpy change for the reaction would be the energy change when breaking the bonds in the reactant to form the products.

So, SiH4 has four Si-H bonds. Breaking these bonds releases energy. But in the products, we have one Si-H bond in SiH2 and nothing else for H2. Wait, but H2 is already a molecule, so maybe H2 isn't breaking or forming.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the enthalpy change for the formation of SiH2 and the decomposition of SiH4.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently.

The standard enthalpy change for the reaction can be found using the standard enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants, multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients.

So, the formula is:

ΔH°_rxn = Σ Δf°(products) - Σ Δf°(reactants)

In this reaction, the reactants are SiH4, and the products are SiH2 and H2.

So, ΔH° = [Δf°(SiH2) + Δf°(H2)] - [Δf°(SiH4)]

Δf°(H2) is 0, so:

ΔH° = (274) + 0 - 34.3 = 274 -34.3 = 239.7 ≈ 240 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's the same as the earlier calculation. But none of the options show 240 as the answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Looking at the options, option E is 240 kJ/mol. So, that would be the answer. But wait, I thought earlier that option E is 240, but why are the options like that? Because 240 is the calculated value.

Wait, but the reaction is written as SiH4 → SiH2 + H2, which has ΔH of 240. So, the correct answer should be E: 240 kJ/mol.

But wait, the options list E as 240, so that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the problem is that I thought earlier that I might have to consider bond energies, but perhaps I didn't need to. Because the standard enthalpy of formation already accounts for the energy changes of the bonds, including the formation of the compound from elements.

So, perhaps the answer is E: 240 kJ/mol.

To determine the standard enthalpies of the reaction:

**SiH₄(g) → SiH₂(g) + H₂(g)**

we use the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔfH°) of the species involved:

- **ΔfH°(SiH₂) = +274 kJ/mol** (formation of SiH₂ from Si(s) and H₂(g)).
- **ΔfH°(H₂) = 0 kJ/mol** (H₂ is in its standard state).
- **ΔfH°(SiH₄) = +34.3 kJ/mol** (formation of SiH₄ from Si(s) and H₂(g)).

The formula for calculating the standard enthalpy change of a reaction using standard enthalpies of formation is:

\[
\Delta H^\ominus_{\text{rxn}} = \sum \Delta H^\ominus_f(\text{products}) - \sum \Delta H^\ominus_f(\text{reactants})
\]

For the given reaction:

- **Products**: SiH₂(g) and H₂(g)**. Their standard enthalpies of formation are +274 kJ/mol and 0 kJ/mol, respectively.
- **Reactants**: SiH₄(g)**. Its standard enthalpy of formation is +34.3 kJ/mol.

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\ominus_{\text{rxn}} = [274 + 0] - 34.3 = 274 - 34.3 = 239.7 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

This simplifies to approximately **240 kJ/mol**.

Thus, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction is **240 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to option **E**.
