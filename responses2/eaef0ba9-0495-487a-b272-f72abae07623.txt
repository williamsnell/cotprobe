Okay, so I've got this question about straight-line depreciation. Hmm, I remember that straight-line is a method of calculating depreciation where the cost of an asset is evenly spread out over its useful life. But let me think through it again to make sure I get it right.

The question says a farmer buys a tractor for $40,000 and expects it to last 20 years, with a salvage value of $10,000. Theyâ€™re asking for the depreciation for the first year. 

Right, straight-line depreciation formula is (Cost - Salvage Value) divided by the useful life. So, the cost is $40k, salvage is $10k, and useful life is 20 years.

So, first, subtract the salvage value from the cost. 40,000 minus 10,000 equals 30,000. Then divide that by 20. 30,000 divided by 20 is 1,500. So each year, the depreciation is $1,500.

Looking at the options, option A is 1500. So the correct answer should be A. Wait, but wait. Let me double-check if I did the formula right. Sometimes I get confused with which is the numerator. Oh yes, cost minus salvage is the depreciable amount, which is 30k, then divided by useful life. So yes, 1500 per year. So the first year's depreciation is $1,500. So the answer is A.

The straight-line depreciation method calculates depreciation by dividing the depreciable amount (cost minus salvage value) by the useful life. 

1. **Depreciable Amount**: $40,000 (cost) - $10,000 (salvage value) = $30,000.
2. **Useful Life**: 20 years.
3. **Depreciation per Year**: $30,000 / 20 = $1,500.

The correct answer is **A: 1500**.
