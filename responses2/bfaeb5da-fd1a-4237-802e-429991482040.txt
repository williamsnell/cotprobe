Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a bicycle pump and temperature. Hmm, let's see. The question says a small boy pumps up his tires, and we need to find the temperature of the air in the pump after it's compressed adiabatically. The tire pressure is 24.5 psi, and the air has a gamma value of 1.40. The initial temperature is 300 K. The options are from A to J, with some numerical values.

Wait, I remember that when gases are compressed adiabatically, it's a process where there's no heat exchange with the surroundings. So it's an isentropic process. Oh right, the formula for an adiabatic process is TV^(γ-1) = constant, or maybe something like PV^γ = constant. Since the process is adiabatic, I should probably use the formula PV^γ = constant.

But wait, I think for adiabatic processes, the relation between temperature and pressure is given by T2/T1 = (P2/P1)^(γ-1)/γ. Alternatively, since it's an ideal gas, maybe the relation is based on the adiabatic index.

Wait, let me think. The adiabatic condition for gases is PV^γ = constant. But I'm not sure if that's the direct way to go here. Another approach is using the relation T1V1^(γ-1) = T2V2^(γ-1). But wait, that might involve volume. Alternatively, since the process is adiabatic, the work done is related to the change in internal energy. Oh, but perhaps using the ideal gas law could help more directly.

Wait, the initial state is T1 = 300 K, and the final pressure is P2 = 24.5 psi. What about the volume? Oh wait, the problem doesn't give the initial volume, so maybe I don't need it. Because the process is adiabatic, maybe I can find the final temperature without knowing the initial volume.

Alternatively, maybe using the relation between the initial and final states. So, the formula for an adiabatic process is T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^( (γ-1)/γ ). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the adiabatic relation is T1 V1^{γ-1} = T2 V2^{γ-1}. But without knowing V1 or V2, how can I compute this? Alternatively, if I can express V2 in terms of V1, perhaps using the ideal gas law.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the relation P1 V1 / T1 = P2 V2 / T2. Because for an ideal gas, PV = nRT, and since the amount of gas is constant, the ratio of PV/T is equal for both states.

So, P1 V1 / T1 = P2 V2 / T2.

But I don't know V1 or V2, but maybe there's another way. Alternatively, since it's adiabatic, another formula: T1 V1^{γ-1} = T2 V2^{γ-1}.

Hmm, but without knowing V1 or V2, I'm stuck. Wait, perhaps I can express V2 in terms of V1 using PV = nRT. Oh wait, but I don't know n or R. Hmm, maybe it's better to use the approach where T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^( (γ-1)/γ ) * (P1/P2)^( something else). Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, another way: the adiabatic process can be described by the relation T1 V1^{gamma-1} = T2 V2^{gamma-1}, and since for an ideal gas, PV = nRT, then T is proportional to PV/(nR). So, perhaps I can relate T2 to T1 via the pressure and volume.

Wait, let's try using the relation (P1 V1)^(1-γ) = (P2 V2)^(1-γ). Wait, no, not sure.

Alternatively, the correct formula for adiabatic compression is: T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^( (gamma-1)/gamma )

Wait, I think that's right. So, let's plug in the numbers. gamma is 1.40, P2 is 24.5, and P1 is presumably the initial pressure before compression. But wait, what is the initial pressure? The problem doesn't state it. Wait, perhaps the initial pressure is much higher than 24.5 psi. But on the bike pump, the initial pressure is higher, which gets compressed to a low pressure.

Wait, but the problem says that the tire pressures are 24.5 psi. So, perhaps the pump is at a higher pressure, and after compression, it's lower. But the problem doesn't give an initial pressure. So maybe we can take initial pressure as P1 and final pressure as P2.

Wait, no, perhaps the initial state is the pump's state, and the final is the tire. But the tire's pressure is given, but the pump's initial pressure isn't. Oh, wait, the problem states that the tire pressures are 24.5 psi, but the pump's initial pressure isn't given. So perhaps I'm missing information here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the adiabatic process where the initial state is the pump and the final is the tire. So, T2 is the temperature after compression, which is supposed to be lower, but wait, no, wait: when you pump up a tire, the air inside is under high pressure, and when you pump it down, it gets compressed, so the temperature might increase? Or wait, no, when you pump up a tire, you compress the air, which needs to be at higher pressure. So, the process is compression, so the temperature probably increases.

Wait, but this is the opposite of what I thought earlier. Wait, no, the initial state would be the pump, which has high pressure, and the final state is the tire with lower pressure. So, the temperature should increase because you're compressing the gas, which requires more energy, so the temperature goes up.

Wait, but the problem states that the tire pressures are to be 24.5 lb/in^2. So, perhaps the initial pressure is higher, and the final is 24.5. But without knowing the initial pressure, how can I compute the final temperature?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The correct formula for adiabatic compression is:

T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^( (gamma-1)/gamma )

But since I don't have P1, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the pump's initial pressure is much higher. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide that. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, wait, wait. Maybe the pump is at a higher pressure, and the tire is at 24.5 psi. So, the process is from high pressure to low pressure. So, the initial state is pump, pressure P1, and final is 24.5 psi, T2 is what we're looking for.

But without knowing P1, it's impossible. So perhaps the problem assumes that the initial pressure is not given, so maybe it's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the process: the air is being compressed adiabatically. The formula for the temperature change in an adiabatic process is T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^( (γ-1)/γ )

Wait, but I need both P1 and P2. But in the problem, P2 is given as 24.5, but P1 is not. So perhaps the initial pressure is the same as the ambient pressure, but that's not given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. The problem says "the air in the pump is assumed to be compressed adiabatically." So, perhaps the initial pressure is the atmospheric pressure, but that's not stated. Wait, but perhaps the initial pressure is the same as the tire's pressure before compression? No, that doesn't make sense. Because then the compression would not be happening.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the pump's initial pressure is the pump's pressure, which is higher than the tire's pressure. But without knowing the initial pressure, it's impossible to compute. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think about the formula again. The adiabatic relation is T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^( (γ-1)/gamma )

But if I don't have P1, I'm stuck. Unless P1 is the same as the tire's initial pressure. But the problem doesn't specify. So perhaps I'm missing a point.

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial pressure is the same as the initial state of the tire. But the tire's initial pressure is not given, so that's unclear.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the given options. The options include 300K, 250, 347, etc. If the process is adiabatic, and temperature increases (since the pump is compressed, and air is heated), then the final temperature would be higher than 300K. Because 347K is higher than 300K, and 325K is higher.

Wait, but according to the formula, T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ). Since γ = 1.4, (γ-1)=0.4, so (0.4)/1.4 is 0.2857.

So, (P2 / P1)^0.2857.

But without knowing P1, this is impossible. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. Another approach: perhaps the initial pressure is assumed to be 1 atm (which is 14.7 psi). Wait, that's possible. Let me try that.

So, P2 is 24.5 psi, P1 is 14.7 psi.

So, (P2/P1) = 24.5 / 14.7 ≈ 1.666...
So, (1.666... )^ (0.2857) = ?

Wait, 1.666 is 5/3. So, (5/3)^(0.2857). Let me compute that.

Well, 5/3 is about 1.6667. Let me compute ln(1.6667) ≈ 0.5108. Multiply by 0.2857: 0.5108 * 0.2857 ≈ 0.1463.

Exponentiate: e^0.1463 ≈ 1.158.

So, T2 = 300 K * 1.158 ≈ 347 K.

Looking at the options, option B is 347 K. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, wait, that's under the assumption that the initial pressure is atmospheric, which is 14.7 psi. But the problem doesn't specify that. So, perhaps that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial pressure is the same as the tire's pressure before compression, but that's not given. So, perhaps the correct assumption is that the pump is at atmospheric pressure, and the tire is at 24.5 psi.

So, under that assumption, the answer is option B, 347 K.

Wait, but the problem statement says the air in the pump is compressed adiabatically, but without knowing the initial pressure, the calculation isn't possible. So maybe the intended approach is to assume that the initial pressure is the same as the tire's pressure before compression, but that's not stated.

Wait, perhaps the problem implies that the initial pressure is the same as the initial state of the tire, which is 24.5 psi. But that would imply no compression, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the pump as a reservoir at a certain pressure, but that's not given. So perhaps the only way this makes sense is that the initial pressure is atmospheric, so 14.7 psi.

Wait, so with that assumption, T2 comes out to be 347 K, which is option B. So that would be the answer.

To determine the temperature of the air in the bicycle pump after compression, we use the adiabatic relationship for an ideal gas:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]

where:
- \( T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \) is the initial temperature of the air in the pump,
- \( P_2 = 24.5 \, \text{psi} \) is the final pressure after compression,
- \( P_1 = 14.7 \, \text{psi} \) is the initial pressure (assumed to be atmospheric pressure),
- \( \gamma = 1.40 \) is the adiabatic index for air.

### Step 1: Compute the pressure ratio
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{24.5}{14.7} \approx 1.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute the exponent
\[
\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} = \frac{1.40 - 1}{1.40} = \frac{0.40}{1.40} \approx 0.2857
\]

### Step 3: Compute the temperature ratio
\[
\left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} = (1.6667)^{0.2857}
\]

To compute this, take the natural logarithm:
\[
\ln(1.6667) \approx 0.5108
\]
Multiply by the exponent:
\[
0.5108 \times 0.2857 \approx 0.1463
\]
Exponentiate:
\[
e^{0.1463} \approx 1.158
\]

### Step 4: Compute the final temperature
\[
T_2 = T_1 \times 1.158 = 300 \, \text{K} \times 1.158 \approx 347 \, \text{K}
\]

### Final Answer:
The temperature of the air in the pump after compression is approximately **347 K**, which corresponds to option **B**.
