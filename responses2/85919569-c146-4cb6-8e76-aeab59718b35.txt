Okay, so I have this question about finding the Laplace transform of a function f(t) = t^n, where n is a positive integer. Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms involve integrating functions multiplied by exponentials, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think. Oh right, the formula for L{t^n} is something involving n factorial over s raised to (n+1). 

Wait, how does that come about? Oh yeah, I think it's derived from the gamma function. Because for integer values, the gamma function Γ(n) is equal to (n-1)! So when you apply the Laplace transform to t^n, it's Γ(n+1)/s^(n+1). Since Γ(n+1) is n!, it becomes n! / s^(n+1). 

Let me check the options. Looking at the choices, option B is n! over s^n+1, which matches what I'm thinking. Let's make sure I didn't mix up any exponents. Oh wait, no, the denominator is s^(n+1), which is s^n multiplied by s, but in the options, it's just s to the (n+1) power. So yes, option B is correct.

The Laplace transform of \( f(t) = t^n \) where \( n \) is a positive integer is given by:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t^n\} = \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}}
\]

From the options provided, the correct choice is:

**B: \( \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \)** 

ANSWER: B
