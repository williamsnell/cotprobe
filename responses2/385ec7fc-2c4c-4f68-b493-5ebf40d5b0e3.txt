Okay, so I've got this question about afterimages when looking at images. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about Curtis staring at a yellow star for a full minute. Then he moves his gaze to a blank white paper. What's the likely afterimage he sees? The options are orange, pink, brown, red, black, white, etc.

Wait, I remember that when you look at something and then move your gaze away, you sometimes see an afterimage. But what color is that? Oh right, it's called the "afterimage" or "retinal afterimage." I think the color depends on the object you're looking at. 

When you look at a yellow star, the afterimage would be based on the color of the object you're looking at. But wait, isn't the eye's retina itself a dark organ, but when you look at a yellow object, the afterimage is the same color as the object because of the way the light reflects off the back of the eye's lens or something?

Wait no, that doesn't sound right. Another thought: when you look at a yellow star, the afterimage is usually the color of the light reflecting off the back of your eye. But the eye's back is covered by the cornea and the lens, so maybe the light doesn't reflect off it. Alternatively, perhaps the afterimage is the same color as the object, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, I think the afterimage actually is the same color as the object. Because the light that enters the eye and hits the object's surface reflects off the back of the lens, which might be a bit of a blur, but the image is often the same color. So if the object is yellow, the afterimage should also be yellow.

Wait, but I also remember that when you look at something and then move to the back, you see an image of the same color. So in this case, when he's staring at the yellow star, he sees a yellow afterimage. Then he moves to white paper, which is white. So the afterimage would be white.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The afterimage is the image that appears when you suddenly stop looking at something and then move away. For example, when you look at a red traffic light and then move away, you see a red afterimage. So if the object is yellow, the afterimage would be yellow. If he was looking at a yellow star, the afterimage would be yellow.

So the options given are:

A: orange

B: pink

C: brown

D: red

E: black

F: purple

G: green

H: white

I: blue

J: yellow

So the correct answer should be J: yellow. Alternatively, is there a scenario where it's different? Like maybe when looking at something, the afterimage is the opposite color. I'm not sure. Wait, I think it's always the same color as the object. So if he's looking at yellow, the afterimage is yellow.

So the answer is J: yellow.

The afterimage when looking at a yellow star is the same color as the object, which is yellow. Moving to a blank white paper would reveal this yellow afterimage.

Answer: J
