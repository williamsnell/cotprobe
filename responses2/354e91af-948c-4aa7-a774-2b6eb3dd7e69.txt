Question:

Statement 1| A U2F USB dongle prevents malware on the user’s computer from stealing the user’s second factor to authenticate as that user even when the user’s computer is turned off. Statement 2| A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.

Options:

A: False, True
B: True, True
C: False, False
D: Both statements are partially true
E: False, Not enough information
F: Not enough information, Not enough information
G: True, False
H: True, Not enough information
I: Not enough information, True
J: Not enough information, False

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about two statements related to U2F (Unique Token File) dongles. Let me break it down step by step.

So, Statement 1 says that a U2F USB dongle prevents malware from stealing the second factor (which I think refers to the user's password) even when the computer is off. I remember that U2F dongles are used to authenticate users by their passwords. They work by using a unique token that's stored on the dongle. If someone else sends a token to the dongle, it can only match the stored token. So if an attacker somehow gets a token from another device, they can't match it to their own, right? But wait, what about when the computer is off? Oh, but the user is still logging in. So maybe the issue is whether the dongle's secure enough to prevent a malicious user from getting a token when the computer is off. Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think U2F dongles are designed to work even when the computer is off because they rely on the user's current password, not the connection status. So Statement 1 seems correct.

Statement 2 claims that a server using U2F can reliably determine that the user is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request. I think this is about authentication. U2F allows the server to verify the user's identity by their password. If the same password is sent by the user, the server can confirm it's the authentic user. So Statement 2 should also be correct.

So both statements are true. Looking at the options, that would be option B: True, True. Wait, but I'm not too confident about Statement 1. Because if the computer is off, does the dongle's token still prevent someone from getting a token? I think the idea is that the token is stored locally, so even if the computer is off, the user's password is still being used. So yes, Statement 1 is correct.

Therefore, both statements are true, so the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: True, True.

Answer:
     B: True, True
