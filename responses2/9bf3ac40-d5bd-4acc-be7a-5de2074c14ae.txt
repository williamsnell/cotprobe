Okay, so I've got this question about behavior and expectations, and I need to figure out which theory explains why an employee expects their boss to behave consistently. Hmm, let me think through each option.

The question is asking for the behavior that's expected to be more consistent than what is warranted. So, the employee feels that their boss is overly consistent, which might be due to some cognitive conflict or maybe how they perceive themselves.

Option A is cognitive dissonance theory. I remember that this theory deals with how people hold onto conflicting information. Maybe if the employee thinks their boss is inconsistent with their expectations, that's their cognitive dissonance. But does that directly explain why they expect consistency? I'm not sure. It might be a factor, but I'm not certain if it's the best fit here.

Option B is self-serving bias. This theory suggests that people focus more on their own interests and goals than on the actual outcomes or others' perspectives. If the employee feels that their boss's behavior is inconsistent with their own values, maybe that's a self-serving bias. But wait, isn't self-serving bias more about a person's tendency to seek personal gain and ignore others' emotions? So, maybe this is about the employee not considering others' feelings, leading to an expectation of consistency.

Option C is self-verification theory. I think this is about evaluating one's own behavior. So, if the employee expects their boss to be consistent, maybe they're verifying their own behavior. For example, if the boss behaves inconsistently, the employee might expect consistency. But how does that explain the expectation of consistency? I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Option D is social comparison theory. This theory suggests that people compare their behavior to others. If the employee feels that their boss behaves consistently, they might compare it to others who do the same. But does that directly cause an expectation of consistency? Or is it more about how others perceive them? Not sure yet.

Option E is fundamental attribution bias. This is about the tendency to overvalue internal factors (like personality traits) over external ones (like job performance). So if the employee thinks their boss is consistent because of their own traits, not because of the boss's actions, that might explain the expectation. But does this mean the employee is expecting consistency because of their own behavior rather than the boss's?

Option F is actor-observer bias. This occurs when people believe they're seeing an action (actor) when they're just observing it (observer). So if the employee thinks the boss's actions are consistent because they're observing, but in reality, the employee is an actor (thinking) about it, that might explain the expectation. But I'm not sure how this directly leads to expecting consistency.

Option G is hindsight bias. This is when people believe they've seen the future, so they're too confident in their observations. If the employee thinks they've seen the boss's consistent behavior, perhaps they're overestimating it, expecting more. Not sure if this is the best fit.

Option H is the overjustification hypothesis. It's about people thinking their explanations are over-the top. So, they might attribute the inconsistency to something they don't understand, leading them to expect consistency. But does that directly explain why they expect consistency?

Option I is self-perception theory. This is about how people perceive themselves. If the employee thinks they're over-eager to conform to expectations, maybe they expect their boss to be consistent. But I'm not confident about this.

Option J is not an option here, so the options are A to I. So, looking back, which theory directly explains the expectation of consistency.

The question is about the expectation being due to the employee's behavior. So, maybe the employee is overestimating consistency because they perceive their boss as overly consistent, perhaps due to internal factors. But which theory does that?

Wait, let me think again. The self-verification theory says that individuals evaluate how consistent their behavior is. So if the employee expects consistency, perhaps they're verifying their own behavior. For instance, if the employee's actions are inconsistent, they might expect consistency because they're verifying that they're behaving consistently. But does that directly explain the expectation?

Alternatively, overjustification (H) might be when someone thinks their explanation is overly inflated. So, if the employee thinks their expectations are too high, they might feel forced to maintain consistency. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the best fit is self-verification theory. Because the employee is verifying their own behavior, expecting consistency. So, when the employee thinks their actions are inconsistent, they verify their behavior and expect consistency. So, the expectation of consistency is because they're verifying their own behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is self-perception theory (I), but I'm not sure how that ties in.

Wait, another angle: the question is about why the employee expects consistency. So, if the employee is overestimating the consistency, maybe it's because they perceive their boss as overly consistent. This could be due to overjustification (H), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the theories. The self-verification theory is about evaluating whether you're consistent. If the employee's behavior is inconsistent, they would expect consistency, which is self-verification. So, perhaps the expectation is because the employee is verifying their own behavior.

But the options are asking which theory best explains the expectation. So, if the employee expects consistency, perhaps the theory is that they are verifying their own behavior, which leads them to expect consistency. So, the answer might be C: self-verification theory.

Alternatively, another thought: overjustification (H) is when you think your explanations are too good to be true. So, if the employee thinks their expectations are over the top, expecting consistency, maybe they're overjustifying. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. The question is about the expectation being the result of the employee's behavior. So, if the employee thinks the boss is inconsistent, perhaps they're overestimating it because they're overly confident in their own consistency. That could be due to overjustification (H), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the employee's expectation comes from feeling their own behavior is inconsistent, so they're overestimating consistency because they think their actions are inconsistent. This might be under the influence of self-verification, but perhaps the best fit is self-verification theory.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the expectation is due to the employee's own reasoning. If the employee thinks their own behavior is inconsistent, they might expect consistency because they believe their own behavior is inconsistent. So, this could be self-verification.

Alternatively, if the employee feels that their boss's inconsistent behavior is due to other factors, they might not expect consistency. But that's about the reason behind the expectation.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each theory's main point:

A) Cognitive dissonance: about holding on to conflicting information.
B) Self-serving bias: overestimating consistency because of personal values.
C) Self-verification: evaluating behavior to see if it's consistent.
D) Social comparison: comparing one's behavior to others.
E) Fundamental attribution bias: overvaluing internal factors.
F) Actor-observer bias: seeing the outside when it's the inside.
G) Hindsight bias: overestimating past successes.
H) Overjustification: overestimating consistency.
I) Self-perception: evaluating own behavior.

The question is about why the employee expects consistency. If the employee perceives their boss as inconsistent, perhaps due to overjustification (H), but I'm not sure if that's the direct mechanism.

Alternatively, the self-verification theory is about evaluating whether your behavior is consistent. So, if the employee's behavior is inconsistent, they would expect consistency because they're verifying their own behavior. So, the expectation of consistency is because the employee is verifying their own actions.

So, the best answer would be C: self-verification theory.

The question asks which theory best explains why an employee expects their boss to behave consistently. The analysis of each option is as follows:

- **Option A (Cognitive Dissonance Theory)**: This theory deals with holding onto conflicting information. While it might relate to the employee's mental state, it doesn't directly explain the expectation of consistency.

- **Option B (Self-Serving Bias)**: This theory suggests that people focus on personal values and goals, potentially leading to an expectation of consistency. However, it's more about personal values rather than the behavior itself.

- **Option C (Self-Verification Theory)**: This theory involves evaluating one's own behavior to determine consistency. If the employee perceives their boss as inconsistent, they would expect consistency as a way of verifying their own behavior.

- **Option D (Social Comparison Theory)**: This theory compares one's behavior to others, but it doesn't directly address the expectation of consistency from the employee's perspective.

- **Option E (Fundamental Attribution Bias)**: This theory attributes behavior to internal versus external factors, not directly explaining the expectation of consistency.

- **Option F (Actor-Observer Bias)**: This bias occurs when observing an action (actor) leads to a belief that the observer (observer) is seeing it. It doesn't directly explain the employee's expectation of consistency.

- **Option G (Hindsight Bias)**: This bias leads to overestimating past successes. It doesn't directly address the expectation of consistency.

- **Option H (Overjustification Hypothesis)**: This theory involves overestimating consistency by thinking explanations are too good. It might contribute to the expectation, but it's less likely to be the primary explanation.

- **Option I (Self-Perception Theory)**: This theory involves evaluating one's own behavior. However, it doesn't directly explain the expectation of consistency from the employee's perspective.

After reviewing the options, **self-verification theory** is the most likely explanation. It involves evaluating one's own behavior to determine consistency, which aligns with the employee expecting their boss to behave consistently.
