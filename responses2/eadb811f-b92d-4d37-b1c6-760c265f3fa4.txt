Question:

 Use the following key to translate the given formula of PL to natural, English sentences.
A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.
B: Izzy plays Minecraft.
C: Emily stops working.
D: Russell makes dinner.
E: Ashleigh stops by.
~(A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E)

Options:

A: It's not true that Marina reading a Percy Jackson book causes Izzy to play Minecraft, but it is true that if Izzy plays Minecraft, Ashleigh won't stop by.
B: It's not true that Marina reads a Percy Jackson book only when Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft only when Ashleigh stops by.
C: Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book has no effect on whether Izzy plays Minecraft, but if Izzy does play Minecraft, Ashleigh will not stop by.
D: If Marina reads a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, but if Izzy does play Minecraft, Ashleigh won't stop by.
E: It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.
F: Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy plays Minecraft provided that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.
G: If Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, and Izzy's playing Minecraft means Ashleigh does stop by.
H: Marina reading a Percy Jackson book doesn't entail Izzy playing Minecraft, but if Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, Ashleigh stops by.
I: Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, and if Izzy plays Minecraft, Ashleigh stops by.
J: If Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy plays Minecraft, which entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.

Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I need to translate a given formula into a natural English sentence using the provided key. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The formula given is ~(A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E). I remember that in logic, A ⊃ B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B, which means "if A then B" can be expressed as "A is not true or B is true". So let me rewrite the formula using this equivalence.

First, let's parse ~(A ⊃ B). Since A ⊃ B is ~A ∨ B, the negation of that would be ~(~A ∨ B). And according to De Morgan's laws, this is equivalent to A ∧ ~B. So ~(A ⊃ B) translates to "Marina doesn't read a Percy Jackson book and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft."

Next, the other part of the formula is (B ⊃ ~E). Again, using the equivalence, B ⊃ ~E is ~B ∨ ~E, which is the same as ~ (B ∧ E). So (B ⊃ ~E) is "If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh doesn't stop by," which can be written as "If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh stops by not stopping by." Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. B ⊃ ~E is equivalent to ~B ∨ ~E, which is "Izzy doesn't play Minecraft OR Ashleigh stops by". So the entire formula is (B ⊃ ~E), which is ~B ∨ ~E, which translates to "Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, or Ashleigh stops by."

Wait, actually, the formula is (B ⊃ ~E). So B is "Izzy plays Minecraft", ~E is "Ashleigh doesn't stop by". So B implies ~E, which is "If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh doesn't stop by." So in natural language, that's "If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh doesn't stop by."

So putting it all together, the entire formula ~(A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E) translates to:

1. ~(A ⊃ B): Mariana doesn't read a Percy Jackson book AND Izzy doesn't play Minecraft.
2. (B ⊃ ~E): If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh doesn't stop by.

But wait, the formula is a conjunction of these two parts. So the combined meaning is that both of these conditions are true.

So the first part: Mariana doesn't read a Percy Jackson book AND Izzy doesn't play Minecraft.
The second part: If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh doesn't stop by.

So the entire formula is saying that both of these are true. So in natural English, it's likely that both conditions are holding simultaneously.

Looking at the options, let me read each option to see which one matches this.

Option A: It's not true that A causes B, but if B, then E doesn't stop. Wait, no, because the second part is ~E, not E. So maybe not.

Option B: It's not true that A only when B, but B only when E stops by. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: A's reading has no effect on B, but if B, then E doesn't stop by. So not matching.

Option D: If A then not B, but if B then E. That's because A ⊃ B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B, so the first part is A => B. So the formula is ~(A => B) which is A ∧ ~B. So D says if A, then not B. Wait, but the first part is ~(A => B) which is A ∧ ~B. So D says if A, then not B. Hmm, that's correct for the first part. The second part is B => ~E, which is ~B ∨ ~E. So D's second part is B => ~E, which would mean if B, then ~E. So D's translation would be: If A, then not B, and if B, then Ashleigh doesn't stop by. That seems to match. Let me see the options.

Wait, let me check each option:

Option D: If Marina reads a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, and if Izzy does play Minecraft, Ashleigh won't stop by. That matches exactly with our analysis: ~A ∨ ~B is equivalent to ~(A ⊃ B), and B ⊃ ~E is ~B ∨ ~E.

So Option D seems correct.

Wait, but the options are about translating the formula. Let me double-check each option's translation.

Option D says:

"If Marina reads a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, and if Izzy does play Minecraft, Ashleigh won't stop by."

Which aligns perfectly with our translation of ~(A => B) and (B => ~E). So yes, that's correct.

The correct translation of the formula ~(A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E) is "If Marina reads a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy doesn't play Minecraft, and if Izzy does play Minecraft, Ashleigh won't stop by."
