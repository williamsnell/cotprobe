Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Jackson borrowing money and owing interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says he borrowed $150, and it's to be paid in 90 days with a 6% interest rate. I need to find the total amount due after 90 days.

Wait, first, I should remember the formula for simple interest because I think that's what's being applied here. The formula is I = P * R * T. Where I is interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. Right, so let's plug in the numbers.

P is $150. The rate is 6%, so I'll convert that to a decimal for calculation, which is 0.06. The time is 90 days, but I need to convert that to a fraction of a year because interest is usually calculated on a yearly basis. So 90 days divided by 365 days a year. Let me calculate that: 90/365 equals approximately 0.246575.

Now, multiplying all these together: I = 150 * 0.06 * 0.246575. Let me compute each step. 150 times 0.06 is 9. Then 9 multiplied by 0.246575. Let me see, 9 * 0.246575 equals... 2.219175. So the interest is about $2.22 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Wait, but sometimes when dealing with days, you might use simple interest, but I should think if it's a simple interest calculation or maybe compound interest. But the question doesn't specify, so I'll assume simple interest. So total amount due is principal plus interest, which is 150 + 2.22, approximately $152.22. Looking at the options, option F is $152.25. That's almost matching, but wait, I should double-check my calculations because sometimes rounding can cause discrepancies.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me recalculate the interest. 150 * 0.06 is 9. Then 9 * 90/365. Let me compute 90/365 exactly. 90 divided by 365 is approximately 0.2465753425. Multiplying 9 by that gives 2.21917808. So the interest is approximately $2.22 when rounded to the nearest cent. So the total is $150 + $2.22 = $152.22. The options don't have $152.22, but the closest is F: $152.25. Alternatively, maybe the calculation should be using a different method, like simple interest for 90 days or perhaps using a different interest calculation method. 

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the time conversion. Let me think again. If the time is 90 days, is it exactly 1/4 of a year? 365 divided by 4 is about 91.25, so 90 is slightly less. So 90/365 is exactly 18/73, which is approximately 0.246575 as I had before. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, maybe the question expects compound interest. Let me check what the options are. If it's compound interest, the formula is A = P(1 + R)^T. But that's not typical for short-term loans. Oh well, but perhaps I should try it just in case.

So 6% annually, but if it's compounded daily, the rate per day would be 0.06/365. But wait, the problem doesn't specify compounding, so I think it's safe to stick with simple interest. So the total amount is $152.22, but the options don't have that. The closest is option F: $152.25. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different method, like daily interest, but that's not standard.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it with 365 days. So 90/365 = 0.246575. So 150 * 0.06 = 9. 9 * 0.246575 is 2.219175. So total is 152.219175, which is approximately $152.22, which rounds to $152.22. The option F is $152.25, which is a bit higher. Could there be a rounding discrepancy somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate 90/365 more precisely. 90 divided by 365: let me compute it accurately.

365 goes into 90 zero times. 365 goes into 900 2 times (2*365=730). Subtract 730 from 900, get 170. Bring down the next 0: 1700. 365 goes into 1700 4 times (4*365=1460). Subtract, get 240. Bring down a zero: 2400. 365 goes into 2400 6 times (6*365=2190). Subtract, get 210. Bring down a zero: 2100. 365 goes into 2100 5 times (5*365=1825). Subtract, get 275. Bring down a zero: 2750. 365 goes into 2750 7 times (7*365=2555). Subtract, get 195. Bring down a zero: 1950. 365 goes into 1950 5 times (5*365=1825). Subtract, get 125. Bring down a zero: 1250. 365 goes into 1250 3 times (3*365=1095). Subtract, get 155. Bring down a zero: 1550. 365 goes into 1550 4 times (4*365=1460). Subtract, get 90. Now, we're back to where we started. So the decimal repeats, but the first few digits are 0.2465753425...

So, 90/365 is approximately 0.2465753425.

So 150 * 0.06 = 9.

9 * 0.2465753425 = ?

Let me compute 9 * 0.2465753425.

0.2465753425 * 9:

0.2 * 9 = 1.8

0.04 *9=0.36

0.006 *9=0.054

0.0005 *9=0.0045

0.0000753425 *9=0.0006780825

Adding all together:

1.8 + 0.36 = 2.16

2.16 + 0.054 = 2.214

2.214 + 0.0045 = 2.2185

2.2185 + 0.0006780825 = 2.2191780825

So the interest is approximately $2.219178, which is about $2.22 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the total amount due is 150 + 2.22 = $152.22, which is approximately $152.22. Looking at the options, the closest is option F: $152.25. But wait, perhaps I should consider whether the problem specifies a different method, like simple interest versus compound. But if it's simple interest, the answer is $152.22, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Options are A: $150.90, B: $161.25, C: $155, D: $148.75, E: $160, F: $152.25, G: $154.50, H: $153.00, I: $159, J: $157.50.

Wait, I see option F is $152.25, which is $152.22 approximately. So that's the closest. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe I should use the exact interest calculation but round differently. Let me try again for more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using simple interest but with a different formula, like daily interest. Wait, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as the total amount after 90 days without compounding.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the interest as (principal * rate * time), but using exact days. So 150 * 0.06 * (90/365) = 150 * 0.06 * (0.2465753425) = 150 * 0.01479452075 = 2.2191781125.

So, the interest is approximately $2.22, making the total amount due $152.22, which rounds to $152.22. However, the options don't have this. The closest is option F: $152.25. Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done differently, like using the simple interest but perhaps with a different rounding method or a different formula.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again: perhaps I should compute it as (150 * (1 + 0.06 * (90/365))) = 150*(1 + 0.06*0.2465753425) = 150*(1 + 0.01479452075) = 150 * 1.01479452075 = approximately 152.22, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is using a different method, like bank rounding or something, but that's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the interest as (P * R) * T, but perhaps the time is in days without dividing by 365, but that's not standard. For example, if it's 90 days, that's exactly 1/4 of a year, so 150 * 0.06 = 9, then 9 * 0.25 = 2.25. So the interest would be $2.25, making the total $152.25, which is option F. That makes sense because 90 days is approximately a third of the year, but wait, 90 days is 25% of a year (since 90/365 â‰ˆ 0.2466, which is roughly 24.66%, which is about 25%). So 25% of $150 is $37.50, but wait, that's not matching. Wait, no, if it's 90 days, which is 90/365 of a year. So 90/365 is roughly 0.2466, so 150 * 0.06 is 9, times 0.2466 is approximately 2.219, which is about $2.22, not $2.25. So the correct total would be approximately $152.22, which isn't an option. So perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different interest calculation, like the simple interest but with daily calculation, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done as (P * R) * (T in days / 360 days), which is often used in financial calculations. Let me try that approach.

So, 90 days / 360 days = 0.25. So, 150 * 0.06 = 9, times 0.25 is 2.25. So the total would be 152.25, which is option F.

Ah, that makes sense. Because sometimes, for example, in some contexts, interest is calculated using 360 days in a year, making 90/360 = 1/4, so interest is 150 * 0.06 * 0.25 = 2.25, totaling 152.25. So option F. 

Wait, but why would the problem mention that it's 6% interest? Because that's the rate, but the way it's applied could depend on the method. So perhaps the correct approach here is to use the 360-day method, which is common in some financial calculations, leading to option F.
</think>

To determine the amount due at the end of 90 days, we use simple interest. The formula is:

\[ I = P \times R \times T \]

Where:
- \( P = \$150 \),
- \( R = 6\% = 0.06 \),
- \( T = 90 \) days converted to a fraction of a year: \( \frac{90}{360} = 0.25 \).

Calculations:
1. **Interest**: \( 150 \times 0.06 \times 0.25 = 2.25 \).
2. **Total Amount**: \( 150 + 2.25 = 152.25 \).

Thus, the amount due is **$152.25**, which corresponds to option F.
