Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question says that Sonia and Negin together have $27.00. Sonia buys a shirt that costs $12.35, and Negin buys a pair of sandals for $10.11. I need to find out how much money they have left after making these purchases. 

Hmm, right. So the first thing I think is, I should add up the money they spent and subtract that from the total they had. Let me write that down. 

So, total money they have is $27.00. They spend $12.35 on a shirt and $10.11 on sandals. I need to add those two amounts together to find out the total they spent. 

Let me do the math. First, $12.35 plus $10.11. Let me add the dollars and cents separately. 12 + 10 is 22, and 0.35 + 0.11 is 0.46. So that makes 22.46. So together, they spent $22.46. 

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. 12.35 + 10.11: 12 plus 10 is 22, 0.35 plus 0.11 is 0.46. So yes, 22.46 in total. 

Now, subtract that from the original amount they had, which was $27.00. So 27.00 minus 22.46. Let's see. 27 minus 22 is 5, and 0.00 minus 0.46? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, right, I should subtract the cents first. 

So, 27.00 minus 22.46. Let me line them up:

27.00  
-22.46  
--------  
Hmm, starting from the right, 0 minus 6. Can't do that, so I need to borrow. The next digit is 0, so I have to go further. The 0 becomes 9, and then I borrow from the 7 in the dollars. So 7 becomes 6, and the 0 becomes 10. So now, 10 minus 6 is 4, and 9 minus 4 is 5. Then the dollars part is 6 minus 2, which is 4. So the result is $4.54. 

Looking at the options, option C is $4.54. So that must be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my addition or subtraction. 

Let me check the total spent again. $12.35 plus $10.11. Adding 12 and 10 gives 22, and 0.35 + 0.11 is 0.46. So 22.46. That seems right. 

Now 27 minus 22.46: 27 is 27.00, subtract 22.46. So 27 minus 22 is 5, and then subtracting 0.46 from 0.00. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as 27 - 22 =5, and then the cents part is 0.00 - 0.46, which is negative. Oh wait, that's not right. 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert the dollars to cents. 27 is 2700 cents. 22.46 dollars is 22 dollars and 46 cents, which is 2246 cents. So 2700 - 2246 = 454 cents. 454 cents is $4.54. That confirms the earlier calculation. 

So the answer should be option C, $4.54. I think that's correct.

The total amount Sonia and Negin have is $27.00. They spend $12.35 on a shirt and $10.11 on sandals, totaling $22.46. Subtracting this from their initial amount gives $4.54. 

Answer: C
