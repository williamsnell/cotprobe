Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about what poverty is. Let me see. I remember from school that poverty is a common term, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition. The options are A to J, each giving a different phrasing.

First, I'll go through each option one by one. Option A says poverty is the lack of resources to secure basic life necessities. That sounds familiar. I think the basic necessities are things like food, shelter, clothing, and maybe healthcare. If you can't get these, you're in poverty.

Option B claims it's the condition where a person has excessive wealth and resources. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If someone has too much wealth, they might not need so much basic stuff. So probably not B.

Option C says poverty is the inability to afford a good standard of living. That makes sense because a standard of living refers to how well off you are, so lacking resources to achieve that would be poverty. But I wonder if it's more about basic needs versus a better standard.

Option D states poverty is having too little money to fulfill basic needs as society defines those needs. Hmm, that seems similar to A. The key difference might be the emphasis on what society defines as basic needs versus individual circumstances. So both A and D seem plausible.

Option E is about being unable to buy luxury items. That's more about luxury goods than poverty. So E doesn't fit because poverty isn't about not being able to afford luxury, it's about basic needs.

Option F talks about living in a rural area without urban amenities. That sounds like a specific case, but I'm not sure if that's the general definition. The question is about the state of poverty in general, not just rural situations.

Option G says poverty is the temporary lack of employment. That's a bit different because it's about the duration of the condition, but I think poverty is more about the circumstances rather than the cause. So G might not be the best answer.

Option H is about being inferior in quality or insufficient in amount. That's a bit abstract and doesn't directly address the need to secure basic necessities. So H might not be the correct definition.

Option I says it's about having an income less than the median income. That's a specific measure, but it's still a way to define poverty. It's a common statistical approach. So I is a valid definition.

Option J claims it's exclusively about not having access to education. That doesn't sound right because education is just one aspect of life, not the entire condition of poverty.

So, I'm narrowing down to options A, D, I. Wait, let me think again. Option A says "lack of resources to secure basic life necessities." That's pretty straightforward. It's about the resources needed to get by. Option D says "too little money to fulfill basic needs as society defines those needs." That's also about fulfilling basic needs but emphasizes the societal definition. So they're similar but maybe A is more neutral because it's about resources regardless of what society defines.

Wait, another angle: poverty is often discussed in terms of people's ability to meet their needs. So A and D both address that. But which one is the standard definition?

I think the standard definition is that people are considered poor if they can't meet their basic needs, regardless of what society defines. So A and D are both correct, but looking at the options, which one is the best.

Wait, the question is asking for the definition of poverty. The standard definition is that someone is in poverty if they cannot secure basic life necessities. So A is correct.

Option I defines it as income less than the median, which is a measure, not a definition. So I is a statistic, not the definition. So I is incorrect.

So the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Looking again, the best answer is A and D, but D seems to define it as fulfilling basic needs as society defines them, while A is more about the resources. So which is the standard definition?

I think, in general, the definition is about resources. So A is the correct one.

The correct definition of poverty is the lack of resources to secure basic life necessities, which aligns with option A. This definition emphasizes the need to meet fundamental requirements like food, shelter, and healthcare, which are essential for a stable life. While option D also touches on the concept of fulfilling basic needs, it focuses on societal definitions rather than the general understanding of poverty. Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: Poverty is the lack of resources to secure basic life necessities.**
