Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor for any person to smoke a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in any restaurant, bar, cafe, or other establishment within the state. A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy. The court should

Options:

A: deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.
B: grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted.
C: grant the motion, because the city attorney is using the same witness.
D: deny the motion, because the first trial resulted in a mistrial.
E: grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.
F: deny the motion, because the city's anti-smoking ordinance is separate from the state statute.
G: grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.
H: deny the motion, because the city has its own jurisdiction.
I: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.
J: deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.

Okay, so I have this legal question to tackle. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is about a state making a new anti-smoking statute. Any person can't smoke in restaurants, bars, etc. A defendant was tried in state court, but the prosecution called a witness who had a prior conviction from the state that was excluded by the judge. The judge granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state appealed, and the city attorney, from a neighboring city, is now prosecuting the same case under their own anti-smoking ordinance, which is identical. The city attorney wants to prosecute and the city attorney is planning to call a witness who was the same as the one from the state's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, and the court needs to decide whether to grant the motion.

Hmm, so the key issue here is whether the city attorney's prosecution violates the defendant's right against double jeopardy. Double jeopardy is the principle that you can't re-prosecute the same person twice for the same offense, unless certain exceptions apply.

So, the defendant moved to dismiss because of this. The question is whether the city's prosecution is allowed, given that it's the same statute, so the evidence would be the same. But the city attorney is using the same witness as the state's first trial witness. So, the same witness is now cross-examining both the state and city prosecution.

In the first state prosecution, the witness was excluded because the judge dismissed the case. Now, when the city is prosecuting, the same witness is being called. So, under what circumstances can the same witness cross-examine both the state and city prosecution?

Wait, but the state argument is about whether the same witness can be used. I think the issue is about whether the state's prior conviction can be used as an exception. Because the state had a mistrial, which might have allowed the prior conviction to be used against the first trial. 

Double jeopardy typically requires that the same sovereign (state or city) prosecuting the same defendant in the same case twice. But if the prosecution is for a different offense, like a different statute, that might be allowed. But in this case, the city's statute is the same as the state's. So, the city's prosecution is for the same offense, same statute, so it's the same case.

Now, the issue is whether using the same witness in both prosecutions violates the double jeopardy clause. The double jeopardy clause allows an exception if the prior conviction was based on a period of time exceeding a certain length, or if it's a serious or criminal offense. 

In the state case, the defendant had a prior conviction, which was excluded by the judge dismissing the case with mistrial. So, when the city tries to use the same witness, can the city's prosecution get the same witness's testimony? 

The problem is that the state's prior conviction was excluded because the trial was dismissed. So, perhaps the same witness can't be used because the state had already dismissed the case. Alternatively, maybe the state didn't use the prior conviction as an exception, so the city can still prosecute using the same witness.

Wait, but the state's prosecution was dismissed for mistrial, and the witness was called in the city's prosecution. So, the same witness is being cross-examined by both the state and the city. The state's prosecution was dismissed because the judge dismissed the case, which probably involved using the prior conviction as an exception. But in this case, the prior conviction was excluded because the trial was dismissed. So, perhaps the city's prosecution can use the same witness.

Alternatively, the state's prosecution used the prior conviction as an exception, which allowed the state to use it. But if the state's evidence was dismissed, perhaps the city's prosecution can still use the same witness because the same witness is cross-examined by both.

Wait, but double jeopardy applies when the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense. So, the city and state are both prosecuting the same offense. So, the same witness can be used in both prosecutions, but only if the prior conviction is an exception under the double jeopardy clause.

So, the state's prosecution used the prior conviction as an exception because the trial was dismissed, but that would mean the state couldn't use the same witness again, or perhaps the city can still use it.

Alternatively, the state's prior conviction was excluded because the trial was dismissed. So, perhaps the city can use the same witness because the state had already dismissed the case. So, the city's prosecution can use the same witness, which would be a problem under double jeopardy because the same witness is being used in the same case twice.

Wait, but the city's prosecution is a separate sovereign, so perhaps the double jeopardy rule doesn't apply between the state and the city. Because each is a separate sovereign, double jeopardy doesn't apply between them. So, the same witness can be used in both prosecutions.

But the problem is that the state had a prior conviction that was excluded because the trial was dismissed. So, perhaps the city's prosecution can use the same witness, but I'm not sure how that affects the double jeopardy aspect.

Alternatively, the issue is whether the city's prosecution is allowed. If the city's prosecution is for the same offense, then the same witness can be used. But the prior conviction was used in the state's prosecution. So, the city can use the same witness, meaning the state's prosecution was using an exception. But the city's prosecution could still use the same witness because the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense.

Wait, but double jeopardy only applies when the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense twice. If the city is prosecuting under a different statute (same as the state), but the same sovereign, is that allowed?

Wait, the city's statute is the same as the state's. So, if the city and state are both prosecuting under the same statute, then double jeopardy applies. Because the same sovereign (city or state) is prosecuting the same offense (anti-smoking in this case) for the same defendant.

So, the same witness can be used in both prosecutions, which would violate the double jeopardy clause because the same witness is being used in the same case twice by the same sovereign.

But the state's prior conviction was used as an exception. The state's prosecution used the prior conviction as an exception, but the trial was dismissed, so the state couldn't use the same witness again. But the city can use the same witness because the state's prosecution dismissedâ€”so the state's prior conviction is no longer an issue for them. So, the city can use the same witness.

Wait, but the city is a separate sovereign. So, if the state is using the same witness because of prior conviction, but the city is using the same witness because it's a separate prosecution, then the city can use the same witness, which would violate double jeopardy because the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense twice.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's recap:

- State and city are both prosecuting the same anti-smoking offense.
- The city is using the same witness as the state.
- The state had a prior conviction that was excluded because the trial was dismissed. So, the state didn't use that prior conviction as an exception. Or did they?

Wait, the first part says that the prosecution in the state case called a witness who testified to a prior conviction. But the judge dismissed the case with mistrial. That suggests that the prior conviction was used against the defendant because the trial was dismissed. So, perhaps the state's prosecution used the prior conviction as an exception and dismissed the case.

But the city is now prosecuting the same case. The city's attorney is using the same witness. So, the state's prosecution used the prior conviction as an exception and dismissed, whereas the city uses the same witness in their prosecution.

So, for the city's prosecution to use the same witness, would that violate double jeopardy?

Double jeopardy applies when the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense for the same defendant twice. So, if the city and state are both prosecuting the same offense, and the city is using the same witness, then the double jeopardy clause applies.

But the state's prior conviction was excluded because the trial was dismissed. So, the state couldn't use the same witness as an exception. But the city can still use the same witness because the state's prosecution dismissed, so their prior conviction no longer applies. So, the city can use the same witness in their prosecution.

So, the city can use the same witness, which would mean that the same witness is being used in the same case by the same sovereign, which would violate double jeopardy.

But wait, the state's prosecution dismissed the case because the judge dismissed it, which might have been due to using the prior conviction as an exception. So, the state's prosecution had already dismissed, which might mean that the state's prior conviction is no longer a factor. But the city's prosecution is using the same witness, so it's a problem.

But wait, the city is a separate sovereign. So, double jeopardy applies when two sovereigns are prosecuting the same offense for the same defendant. So, if the city and state are both prosecuting the same offense, double jeopardy applies. So, the city can't use the same witness as the state.

But in this scenario, the state had a prior conviction that was excluded because the trial was dismissed. So, the state couldn't use the prior conviction to prosecute. But the city is using the same witness, so they can; because the prior conviction is no longer a factor. But the city's prosecution is a separate case, so the double jeopardy doesn't apply between the two.

Wait, but the state and city are separate sovereigns. So, double jeopardy applies only when the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense for the same defendant twice. So, if the city is a separate sovereign, then double jeopardy doesn't apply between the state and the city.

So, if the city is prosecuting the same case as the state, but using the same witness, that would violate double jeopardy because it's the same sovereign (city) prosecuting the same offense (anti-smoking) for the same defendant (same person). Therefore, the court should grant the motion because the city is using the same witness, which violates the double jeopardy clause.

Looking at the options, option A says: deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial. But that's not directly related to double jeopardy.

Option B: grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted. Hmm, that's a possibility, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The key issue is whether the city's prosecution is allowed. So, the prior conviction was used by the state because the trial was dismissed. Now, the city is using the same witness. But because the state's prior conviction was excluded, the city can use the same witness, which would be a problem under double jeopardy if the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense twice.

But if the city is using the same sovereign (city) for the same offense, then yes, it's a problem. So, the court should grant the motion because the city is using the same witness, thus violating double jeopardy.

Looking at the options:

Option A: deny the motion. But that's not correct because the city is a separate sovereign.

Option B: grant because same incident. Hmm, but that's not the issue. It's about whether the same witness is being used.

Option E: grant because the law and evidence are the same. Not sure.

Wait, the options: option B says grant because same incident being prosecuted. That's a possibility, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the state's prosecution used the prior conviction, which was excluded because the trial was dismissed. Now, the city is using the same witness, which would be a problem under double jeopardy because the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense twice.

Alternatively, if the city is prosecuting under a different statute (same as the state), so it's the same offense, same sovereign. Then the same witness can be used, which violates double jeopardy.

Therefore, the court should grant the motion because the city is using the same witness, thus violating the double jeopardy clause.

Looking at the options, option A says: deny because the judge granted a mistrial. No, that's about mistrial, not double jeopardy.

Option B: grant because same incident. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Option D: deny because the first trial resulted in a mistrial. No, the city is using the same witness, not the state's.

Option E: grant because the law and evidence are the same. Not sure.

Wait, another angle. The state's prosecution used the prior conviction as an exception, but the trial was dismissed, so that prior conviction is no longer a factor. However, the city is using the same witness, which would be a problem because the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense.

So, the court should grant the motion because the same witness is being used in a prosecution by a different sovereign, which violates the double jeopardy clause.

So, looking for an option that says that the motion should be granted because the double jeopardy clause applies.

Looking back, option B says: grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted.

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, the correct option would be A or B or E.

Wait, no. The correct reasoning is that the same witness is being used by the same sovereign, thus violating double jeopardy. So, the court should grant the motion because the city is using the same witness, which is the problem.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe the judge dismissed the case with mistrial, which probably means that the prior conviction is no longer an issue. So, the city can use the same witness, so double jeopardy applies.

So, the court should grant the motion because the city is using the same witness, thus violating the double jeopardy clause.

Looking at the options, let me read each again:

A: deny because judge granted mistrial. No, that's not the issue.

B: grant because same incident. Maybe, but perhaps not.

C: grant because same witness. I'm not sure.

D: deny because first trial mistrial. No.

E: grant because law and evidence are same. No.

H: deny because city has jurisdiction. No.

F: deny because different statute. No.

G: grant because jeopardy attached. I think the statute is same, so jeopardy applies.

Wait, the double jeopardy applies when the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense for the same defendant twice. So, the city is a different sovereign, so probably not. Wait, but in some jurisdictions, double jeopardy applies across different sovereigns? I'm not sure. But I think the standard is that double jeopardy applies within the same sovereign.

So, the city is a separate sovereign, so double jeopardy doesn't apply.

Therefore, the court should grant the motion because the same witness is being used in the same case by a different sovereign, thus violating double jeopardy.

Looking for the option that says that the motion should be granted because the double jeopardy clause applies.

The options are:

A: deny because judge granted mistrial. No.

B: grant because same incident. Maybe yes.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is B. Or another option.

Alternatively, perhaps the city's prosecution is allowed because the prior conviction was used against the state, but the city is using the same witness, which is allowed because the state's prosecution dismissed, so the prior conviction is no longer a factor. But the city is using the same witness, so it would violate double jeopardy.

Thus, the court should grant the motion, so option E is not correct. Option B: grant because same incident.

Wait, another thought: the state's prosecution was using the prior conviction as an exception, but because the trial was dismissed, the exception was never used. So, the same witness is being used by the city, which is the same sovereign, thus no longer a problem. Hmm, but that's not correct because the same sovereign is still prosecuting the same offense, just using a different witness.

Wait, maybe the city is not using the same witness, but the question states the city attorney called the same witness as the state's first trial witness. So, the same witness is being called by the city.

Therefore, the city is using the same witness, which violates double jeopardy because it's the same sovereign prosecuting the same offense twice.

So the correct answer is B. Because the same incident is being prosecuted by the same sovereign.

Wait, no, because the city is a separate sovereign. So, double jeopardy doesn't apply between the state and the city. So, the court should grant the motion because the same witness is being used, thus violating the double jeopardy clause.

Wait, but the city is a separate sovereign, so double jeopardy only applies within the same sovereign.

Therefore, the court should grant the motion because the city is using the same witness, which violates the double jeopardy clause.

Looking for the option that says the motion should be granted because the double jeopardy applies.

Looking back, option B says "grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted." I think that's the answer.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the city attorney's prosecution of the defendant violates the double jeopardy clause in the state's anti-smoking statute. Double jeopardy requires that the same sovereign (state or city) prosecuting the same offense for the same defendant not be retried more than twice. In this case, the city attorney is using the same witness as the state's first trial witness, which raises a potential violation of the double jeopardy clause.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Double Jeopardy Clause**: The state and city are separate sovereigns, so double jeopardy does not apply between them. However, the same witness being used by both prosecution could still violate the clause.

2. **State's Prior Conviction**: The state had a prior conviction that was excluded by the judge's dismissal of the case with mistrial. This suggests that the prior conviction was no longer relevant to the state's prosecution, but the city attorney is using the same witness, which could be a problem if the double jeopardy clause applies to the city's prosecution.

3. **City Attorney's Motion**: The city attorney is planning to call the same witness as the state's first trial witness. Using the same witness by the same sovereign could violate the double jeopardy clause, as it would imply that the same witness is being used in the same case by the same sovereign more than once.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Deny the motion because the judge granted a mistrial. This is incorrect because the issue is about double jeopardy, not mistrial.
   - **Option B**: Grant the motion because it is the same incident being prosecuted. This is the most appropriate answer because the city attorney is using the same witness, which could violate the double jeopardy clause.
   - **Option C**: Grant the motion because the city attorney is using the same witness. This is essentially the same as Option B and is correct.
   - **Option D**: Deny the motion because the first trial resulted in a mistrial. This is irrelevant to the double jeopardy issue.
   - **Option E**: Grant the motion because the law and evidence will be identical. This is incorrect because the issue is about double jeopardy, not the jurisdiction of the city.
   - **Option F**: Deny the motion because the first city and state jurisdictions are separate. This is incorrect because double jeopardy applies within the same sovereign, not across jurisdictions.
   - **Option G**: Grant the motion because jeopardy is granted. This is incorrect because jeopardy applies within the same sovereign, not across jurisdictions.
   - **Option H**: Deny the motion because the jeopardy clause is violated. This is incorrect because the double jeopardy clause does not apply between the state and the city.
   - **Option I**: Grant the motion because the state's prior conviction was excluded. This is incorrect because the state's prior conviction was excluded due to the trial being dismissed, not because of the double jeopardy clause.

### Conclusion:
The city attorney's motion should be granted because the same witness is being used by the same sovereign (city) in the same case. This violates the double jeopardy clause, which prohibits the same witness from being used in the same case by the same sovereign more than twice.
