Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about capacitors. Let me think through it. Hmm, I remember that capacitors store charge when they're connected to a battery. But wait, how does the capacitance of a single capacitor affect multiple capacitors connected in series or parallel?

The problem says a 2 μF capacitor is connected directly to a battery and stores 600 μC of charge. Then, an experiment replaces that 2 μF capacitor with three 18 μF capacitors in series. I need to find out how much charge each of these three capacitors stores once fully charged.

Wait, I think I need to recall how capacitors behave when connected in series. Oh right, in series, the charge on each capacitor is the same. Because they all have the same amount of charge stored. But when connected in parallel, the total capacitance is the sum of each, and each has a different voltage, but the charge on each is the same.

So first, the initial setup: a single 2 μF capacitor. The charge Q is given by Q = CV. So I can find the voltage from the battery. Let me calculate that. Q is 600 μC, which is 600e-6 C. So V = Q/C = (600e-6)/(2e-6) = 300 V. Oh, so the battery provides 300 volts.

Now, when the capacitors are replaced by three 18 μF capacitors in series. Wait, no, the wording says three 18 μF in series. Oh, right, because the original setup was a single 2 μF and now it's three 18 μF. But wait, the question says the original setup is 2 μF, and the new setup is three 18 μF in series connected to the same battery. So each of these three has a capacitance of 18 μF.

In a series connection, the equivalent capacitance is given by 1/C_eq = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3. Since all three are the same, it's 3/(18) = 1/C_eq. Wait, wait no, if each is 18 μF, then each contributes 1/18. So 3*(1/18) = 1/C_eq. So 3/(18) = 1/C_eq → C_eq = 6 μF. So the three capacitors in series together have a total capacitance of 6 μF.

But wait, the battery's voltage is the same in series as in parallel. So when the three are in series, each has the same charge as the others. Since the total capacitance is 6 μF, the charge Q would be C_eq * V. But wait, the battery's voltage is 300 V, right? Because the same battery is connected, so the voltage across each series capacitor is 300 V.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The capacitor is connected to a battery, so in series, each has the same charge, but their voltages add up. Oh wait no, in a series connection, the same current flows through each, but the voltages add. But the battery's voltage is the same as the voltage across each capacitor in series. Because each capacitor is in series with the next, so the battery's voltage is the sum. Wait no, if it's connected to the same battery, then the battery's voltage is V, so each capacitor's voltage is V.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. If a battery is connected to a series of capacitors, each capacitor is in series with the next, so the current is the same, and the voltage across each capacitor adds up to the battery voltage. But for a single capacitor connected to a battery, the charge is C*V. Here, the battery's voltage V is 300 V.

So when you have three 18 μF in series, their equivalent capacitance is 6 μF, as I calculated earlier. But wait, when they're in series, the charge on each of them is the same. And since they're connected to the same battery, their voltages add up to 300 V.

Wait, no, because each capacitor is in series with the next. So the current flows through each, but the voltage across each is whatever. So the total voltage of the battery is the sum of the voltages across each capacitor. So in this case, 3 capacitors each with V1, V2, V3, adding to 300 V.

But since they are identical, each V should be 100 V. Because 3*100=300. So each capacitor has V=100 V.

Now, each capacitor's charge is Q = C*V. So for each 18 μF capacitor, Q = 18e-6 F * 100 V = 1.8e-3 C, which is 1800 μC. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck. The original single capacitor is 2 μF. It's connected to a 300 V battery, so Q = 2e-6 * 300e-3 = 600e-9 * 300 → Wait, no, 2e-6 * 300 V = 600e-6 C = 600 μC. That's correct.

Now, when replaced by three 18 μF in series. Their equivalent capacitance is 6 μF. So the charge stored in each is C_eq * V. But wait, the V is 300 V, because all are in series and connected to the same battery. So each capacitor has a charge of (6 μF) * 300 V.

Wait, 6e-6 F * 300 V = 1.8e-3 C → 1800 μC. But wait, looking at the options, H is 600 μC, D is 100, etc. Hmm, none of the options match 1800. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the equivalent capacitance. Let me think again. When capacitors are connected in series, the equivalent capacitance is less than each individual capacitor. So for three 18 μF in series, the equivalent is:

1/C_eq = 1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18 = 3/(18) = 1/6 → C_eq =6 μF. That's correct. So each capacitor's charge is 6e-6 * 300 = 1.8e-3 C → 1800 μC. But none of the options is 1800. Hmm, the options go up to 1800 (J: 1800 μC). So the correct answer would be option J, 1800 μC. But wait, let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the question says the capacitor is replaced with three 18 μF in series. So each of these three has a capacitance of 18 μF. So each would have the same charge, which is 18e-6 * 300 = 5.4e-3 C = 5400 μC? No, wait, no, because in series, the charge is same on each, so each would have 18e-6 * 300 V = 5.4e-3 C, which is 5400 μC. But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the same battery. The initial capacitor, 2 μF, charges to 600 μC. When replaced with three 18 μF in series, each would have a charge of (3*18 μF) in series, but no, that's not correct. Wait, the equivalent capacitance is 6 μF, so each would have 6e-6 *300 = 1.8e-3 C, which is 1800 μC. But that's not one of the options. Wait, but the options have J as 1800 μC. So why isn't that the answer?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the equivalent. Let me recalculate: 3 capacitors in series. Each 18 μF. So 1/C = 1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18 → that's 3/(18) = 1/6 → C_eq is 6 μF. So Q = C_eq * V =6e-6 * 300 = 1.8e-3 C → 1800 μC. So each should have 1800 μC. But the options don't have that, unless I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the original problem says, when the capacitor is replaced with three 18 μF in series connected to the same battery. So each of them is 18 μF, so their charge is 18 μF * 300 V = 5400 μC per capacitor. But that can't be, because the total charge would be 3 * 5400 = 16200 μC, but the equivalent in series is 6 μF *300 = 1800 μC. That's conflicting. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. The original capacitor has a charge of 600 μC when it's 2 μF. When it's replaced by three 18 μF in series, the total charge on each of the three must be the same, because in series, same charge. So each capacitor's charge is Q. The total charge on all three is 3Q. But the equivalent in series is 6 μF, so 6e-6 F * 300 = 1.8e-3 C = 1800 μC. So 3Q = 1800 μC → Q = 600 μC per capacitor. So each of the three 18 μF capacitors has 600 μC. But wait, that can't be correct because in series, each has 18 μF and Q=600 μC.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think: when the three 18 μF are in series, their equivalent is 6 μF, and the charge is 6e-6 *300 V= 1800 μC. But in series, each capacitor has the same charge, so each is 1800 μC. But that's not matching any option.

Wait, the options don't have 1800. The options go up to J:1800. So perhaps J is the correct answer. But why? Because perhaps the problem is considering each capacitor's voltage as 300 V, so each has 18 μF *300 V=5400 μC. But that wouldn't make sense because in series, the charge would be the same on each. So each would have 6 μF's charge which is 1800 μC. But that's not an option, unless I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the charge on each capacitor as the same as the original. Wait, the original had a charge of 600 μC. So if the capacitors are in series, each would have 600 μC. But that also contradicts the calculations. Because in series, same charge. So each would have 600 μC.

Wait, but the equivalent in series is 6 μF, so 6e-6 *300=1800 μC. So 3 capacitors in series each with 600 μC would have a total charge of 1800 μC. That makes sense. So each would have 600 μC.

But let me see, the original capacitor is 2 μF, charge 600 μC. So when you replace it with three 18 μF in series, each has 600 μC. So the correct charge per capacitor is 600 μC. Looking at the options, option A is 300, option B 400, etc. No, wait, none of the options except J is 1800, but that's the equivalent. Hmm, maybe the correct answer is 600 μC. But I thought in series, each would have the same charge, which would be 1800 μC. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalent capacitance. Let me re-calculate the series. For three 18 μF capacitors in series.

C_eq = (1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3)^-1.

Each C is 18e-6 F.

So 1/C_eq = 3/(18e-6) → 3/(18e-6) = 1/(6e-6) → so C_eq =6e-6 F. So 6 μF. So each of the three has 6e-6 *300 = 1800 μC. That's correct. So the charge on each is 1800 μC, so option J. But why isn't that an option? Wait, the options don't have 1800 except J. So the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but the options include J: 1800 μC. So the answer is J.

But wait, the question is, once the capacitors are fully charged, what charge is stored on each. Oh, because I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine. When the capacitors are in series, each has the same charge, but their voltages add up. So each has V = 300 V.

So Q = C * V =18e-6 *300 =5.4e-3 C =5400 μC. Wait, that's 5400 μC. But that's each. But if that's the case, then the total charge is 3 *5400 = 16200 μC. But the equivalent capacitance is 6 μF, which would give 6e-6 *300=1800 μC. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, that can't be. So my earlier approach is wrong. Let me think differently. The charge on each capacitor in series is the same, but the voltage adds up. So each has same charge, but their voltages add. Since the battery's voltage is 300 V, each of the three has 300 V? No, that doesn't make sense because that would make the total voltage 900 V, which is more than the battery's V. So that's impossible. So each must have a lower voltage.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When capacitors are connected in series, the same charge flows through each, and the sum of their voltages equals the total voltage across the series combination. But the battery's voltage is the same as the voltage across each capacitor when connected in series? No, that can't be because in parallel, the voltage is same, but in series, the sum of the voltages is equal to the applied voltage.

Wait, but the battery's voltage is the same as the applied voltage. So if the three capacitors are in series, each has a voltage V1, V2, V3, such that V1 + V2 + V3 = V_battery=300 V.

But since they are identical, V1 = V2 = V3 = 100 V.

So each has 100 V across them.

The charge on each is Q = C * V = 18e-6 *100 → 1.8e-3 C → 1800 μC.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalent capacitance calculation.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the capacitors are connected in series, and the same voltage is across each. So each has the same voltage. The total is 300 V, so each has 100 V.

Each capacitor's charge is Q = C * V = 18e-6 *100 = 1.8e-3 C → 1800 μC. That's the same as before. So each has 1800 μC. But the options don't have this, except J:1800 μC.

So the correct answer should be J: 1800 μC.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is 1800. So the answer would be J.

To solve the problem, we analyze the behavior of capacitors when connected in series and parallel. The initial capacitor has a capacitance of \( 2 \, \mu\text{F} \) and stores a charge of \( 600 \, \mu\text{C} \). When this capacitor is replaced with three \( 18 \, \mu\text{F} \) capacitors connected in series, we need to determine the charge stored on each capacitor.

### Step 1: Capacitors in Series
In a series connection, the charge on each capacitor is the same, but the voltages across the capacitors add up to the total voltage provided by the battery. Since the capacitors are identical, the voltage across each capacitor is equal. The total voltage across the series combination is \( 300 \, \text{V} \) (same as the battery voltage).

Each capacitor has a voltage of:
\[
V = \frac{300 \, \text{V}}{3} = 100 \, \text{V}.
\]

### Step 2: Charge on Each Capacitor
The charge on each capacitor is given by:
\[
Q = C \cdot V,
\]
where \( C = 18 \, \mu\text{F} \) and \( V = 100 \, \text{V} \). Substituting the values:
\[
Q = 18 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \cdot 100 \, \text{V} = 1.8 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{C} = 1800 \, \mu\text{C}.
\]

### Step 3: Verification of Results
- The initial capacitor, \( 2 \, \mu\text{F} \), has a charge of \( 600 \, \mu\text{C} \), which matches the given information.
- When replaced with three \( 18 \, \mu\text{F} \) capacitors in series, the total charge stored in the system is:
\[
Q_{\text{total}} = 3 \cdot Q = 3 \cdot 1800 \, \mu\text{C} = 5400 \, \mu\text{C}.
\]
- The equivalent capacitance of the three \( 18 \, \mu\text{F} \) capacitors in series is:
\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{18} = \frac{3}{18} = \frac{1}{6}, \quad C_{\text{eq}} = 6 \, \mu\text{F}.
\]
- The charge on the equivalent \( 6 \, \mu\text{F} \) capacitor is:
\[
Q_{\text{eq}} = C_{\text{eq}} \cdot V = 6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \cdot 300 \, \text{V} = 1.8 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{C} = 1800 \, \mu\text{C}.
\]
This confirms that the charge on each of the three \( 18 \, \mu\text{F} \) capacitors is \( 1800 \, \mu\text{C} \).

### Step 4: Matching with Options
From the options provided:
- Option A: \( 300 \, \mu\text{C} \) — Incorrect.
- Option B: \( 400 \, \mu\text{C} \) — Incorrect.
- Option C: \( 600 \, \mu\text{C} \) — Incorrect.
- Option D: \( 100 \, \mu\text{C} \) — Incorrect.
- Option E: \( 200 \, \mu\text{C} \) — Incorrect.
- Option F: \( 1000 \, \mu\text{C} \) — Incorrect.
- Option G: \( 1500 \, \mu\text{C} \) — Incorrect.
- Option H: \( 600 \, \mu\text{C} \) — Incorrect.
- Option I: \( 1800 \, \mu\text{C} \) — Correct.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: \( 1800 \, \mu\text{C} \)**.

ANSWER: H
