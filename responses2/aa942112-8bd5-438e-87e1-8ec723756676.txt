Question:

John's Lawn Mowing Service is a small business that acts as a price-taker (i.e., MR = P). The prevailing market price of lawn mowing is $20 per acre. John's costs are given by total cost = 0.1q^2 + 10q + 50, where q = the number of acres John chooses to cut a day. Calculate John's maximum daily profit.

Options:

A: 200
B: 100
C: 175
D: 120
E: 150
F: 225
G: 300
H: 250
I: 130
J: 160

Okay, so I've got this problem here about John's Lawn Mowing Service. I need to find his maximum daily profit. Let's see... Hmm, I remember from my economics class that for a price-taker, the marginal revenue equals the market price. Since the problem says the market price is $20 per acre, MR = P = $20. 

John's total cost is given by the equation: TC = 0.1q² + 10q + 50, where q is the number of acres he cuts a day. To find the maximum profit, I think I need to find the quantity q that maximizes profit, which is done by setting marginal cost (MC) equal to marginal revenue (MR). 

Wait, right, because profit is total revenue (TR) minus total cost (TC). TR is price multiplied by quantity, so TR = P * q. Since P is $20, TR = 20q. So, TR is a linear function, and TR - TC would give the profit function. But for profit maximization, the derivative of the profit function with respect to q should be zero. 

Alternatively, since MC is derivative of TC with respect to q, let me calculate that. TC = 0.1q² + 10q +50. So, the derivative of TC, which is MC, would be 0.2q +10. 

Set MC = MR: 0.2q +10 = 20. Let's solve for q. So, 0.2q = 10 → q = 50. Wait, that can't be right because if q is 50, then TR is 20*50=1000. Let me check the cost at 50: TC= 0.1*(50)^2 +10*(50)+50 = 0.1*2500=250, 10*50=500, plus 50. So 250+500=750+50=800. So profit would be 1000-800=200. But wait, looking at the options, 200 is option A. But I'm not sure because sometimes the maximum is at a different point.

Wait, another approach: since the problem is a quadratic cost function, the MC curve is linear, so it's a straight line. The MR is also a straight line at 20. They intersect at q=50, as I found earlier. So the maximum profit is at q=50, giving a profit of 200. But wait, let me double-check my math.

Wait another thing, the profit function is TR - TC. TR is 20q, and TC is 0.1q² +10q +50. So profit π = 20q - (0.1q² +10q +50) = -0.1q² +10q -50. To find the maximum, take derivative of π with respect to q: dπ/dq = -0.2q +10. Set to zero: -0.2q +10=0 → q=50. So same result. Profit is then -0.1*(2500) +10*50 -50 = -250 +500 -50 = 200. So A is 200.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 200, but some people might have thought to plug in values. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, no, because when MC = MR, that's where profit is maximized. So 200 must be correct, but why do I see other options like 160? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the profit. At q=50:
TR = 20 *50 = 1000.
TC = 0.1*(50)^2 +10*50 +50 → 0.1*2500=250, 10*50=500, 250 +500=750 +50=800.
So profit is 1000-800=200. So option A is 200. But wait, why are options like 130 or 160 present? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the cost function wrong. Let me double-check. The cost function is 0.1 q² +10q +50. So yes, that's correct. So, the calculation seems right. So the maximum profit is 200, which is option A. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've seen different answers, but according to the calculations, it's 200.

To determine John's maximum daily profit, we start by noting that the market price \( P = \$20 \) and the total cost function \( TC = 0.1q^2 + 10q + 50 \), where \( q \) is the number of acres cut per day. Since John's service is a price-taker, marginal revenue \( MR = P = \$20 \).

To maximize profit, we set marginal cost (MC) equal to marginal revenue (MR). The total cost function is quadratic, so its derivative gives the marginal cost:
\[
MC = \frac{dTC}{dq} = 0.2q + 10
\]
Setting \( MC = MR \):
\[
0.2q + 10 = 20
\]
Solving for \( q \):
\[
0.2q = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad q = 50
\]
At \( q = 50 \), the total revenue (TR) is:
\[
TR = P \times q = 20 \times 50 = \$1000
\]
The total cost (TC) at \( q = 50 \) is:
\[
TC = 0.1(50)^2 + 10(50) + 50 = 0.1(2500) + 500 + 50 = 250 + 500 + 50 = \$800
\]
Profit is TR - TC:
\[
\text{Profit} = 1000 - 800 = \$200
\]
Thus, John's maximum daily profit is \$200, corresponding to option A.
