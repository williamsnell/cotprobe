Okay, so I have this probability question here about the limit superior of a sequence of independent exponential random variables. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The problem says: We have a sequence of independent and exponentially distributed random variables X_n, each with parameter 1. We need to find the probability that the limit superior of X_n divided by the logarithm of n equals 1. So, mathematically, we're looking for P(limsup_{n→∞} X_n / log(n) = 1). The options are given from A to J, with some numerical values.

First, I remember that for limit superior of a sequence, it's the set of limit points, meaning all the accumulation points of the sequence. So, in this case, we're considering the behavior of X_n / log(n) as n grows large.

Each X_n is exponential with parameter 1, which means that the probability density function is f(x) = e^{-x} for x ≥ 0. The expectation of X_n is 1, and the variance is also 1. 

I think about the limit superior. If I consider the sequence a_n = X_n / log(n), then lim sup a_n is the supremum of the set of all accumulation points of a_n. So, we're looking for the probability that one of these a_n's approaches 1 infinitely often as n approaches infinity.

But wait, X_n is exponential, so X_n can take any positive value. Let's see: for each n, X_n is at least 0. So, X_n / log(n) is at least 0. But as n grows, log(n) increases to infinity. So, if X_n is fixed, say X_n = c, then X_n / log(n) approaches 0 as n grows. But X_n is a random variable, so it's not fixed.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the probability that X_n is at least log(n) for infinitely many n. Because if X_n is greater than log(n), then X_n / log(n) would be greater than 1. So, the lim sup would be at least 1 if X_n exceeds log(n) infinitely often.

But wait, since X_n is exponential, the probability that X_n ≥ log(n) is e^{-log(n)} = 1/n. So, for each n, the probability that X_n ≥ log(n) is 1/n. 

Now, considering the events A_n = {X_n ≥ log(n)}, the probability of A_n is 1/n. The question is whether infinitely many A_n occur. 

I remember that the Borel-Cantelli lemma might be relevant here. The first Borel-Cantelli lemma states that if the sum of probabilities converges, then the probability of infinitely many occurrences is zero. The second Borel-Cantelli lemma says if the events are independent and the sum diverges, then the probability is 1. But in this case, the events A_n are not independent because X_n and X_m are independent for different n and m. Wait, actually, the X_n are independent, but their ratios are not necessarily independent. So, maybe I can't directly apply Borel-Cantelli here.

Wait, but wait, the events A_n are independent of each other since the X_n are independent. Because for different n and m, X_n and X_m are independent, so the events A_n and A_m are independent. So, the sum of the probabilities is sum_{n=1}^infty P(A_n) = sum_{n=1}^infty 1/n, which diverges. 

So, according to the second Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the events A_n are independent and the sum diverges, the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 1. Therefore, the lim sup of X_n / log(n) will be at least 1 with probability 1, but that's only part of the story.

Wait, but the question is about the lim sup being exactly 1. So, if it's 1 almost surely, then the probability is 1. But wait, no, because the lim sup could be greater than 1 if X_n / log(n) exceeds 1 infinitely often. But in this case, X_n is exponential, so X_n / log(n) could approach 1, but it's possible that it's sometimes higher, sometimes lower, but for the lim sup to be 1, it needs to approach 1 infinitely often.

Wait, but if the lim sup is 1, that means that infinitely many terms are approaching 1. But according to Borel-Cantelli, since the sum of probabilities diverges, the lim sup occurs almost surely. But does that mean the lim sup is exactly 1? Or could it be higher?

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the lim sup of X_n / log(n). If X_n grows faster than log(n) infinitely often, then X_n / log(n) would go to infinity, so the lim sup would be infinity. If X_n is always less than log(n), then X_n / log(n) would be less than 1, so the lim sup would be less than 1.

But the probability that X_n is less than log(n) for all sufficiently large n is zero, because the expectation of X_n is 1, and the probability that X_n < log(n) is e^{-log(n)} = 1/n, which is small. But wait, since the sum of 1/n diverges, the Borel-Cantelli lemma says that the lim sup of X_n / log(n) is infinity with probability 1. So, the lim sup is infinity almost surely.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Because if the lim sup is infinity, then the probability that lim sup equals 1 is zero.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The lim sup is either 1, infinity, or some finite value. But the lim sup being infinity would imply that X_n / log(n) exceeds any fixed number infinitely often. So, in that case, the lim sup would be infinity, not 1. Therefore, the event that lim sup X_n / log(n) is 1 is impossible, right?

Wait, but the question is about the probability that the lim sup is exactly 1, not about whether it's infinity or some finite number. So, if the lim sup is either 1, infinity, or something else, what's the probability it's 1?

Wait, but according to Borel-Cantelli, since the events A_n are independent and their sum diverges, the lim sup of X_n >= log(n) occurs almost surely, meaning that the lim sup of X_n / log(n) will be >= 1 infinitely often. But the question is about the lim sup being exactly 1, not just greater than or equal to 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think again. The lim sup of X_n / log(n) could be greater than 1, but not necessarily exactly 1. Because the lim sup could be higher than 1, but then the probability that it's exactly 1 would be zero. But in this case, the lim sup is either 1, infinity, or something else. But according to Borel-Cantelli, the lim sup is infinity almost surely, so the probability that it's exactly 1 is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me approach this differently. Let me consider the probability that X_n <= log(n) for all n beyond some point. If that were the case, then the lim sup of X_n / log(n) would be 0. But the probability that X_n <= log(n) for all n beyond any point is zero because the sum of 1/n diverges, so by Borel-Cantelli, we have infinitely many X_n >= log(n), so lim sup is infinity. Therefore, the event that the lim sup is 1 is impossible, so the probability is zero.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's consider the lim sup of X_n / log(n). Since each X_n is exponential with parameter 1, it's infinitely often larger than any constant. So, X_n / log(n) will sometimes be larger than 1, sometimes not. But since the sum of 1/n diverges, the lim sup is infinity. Therefore, the probability that lim sup equals 1 is zero.

Wait, but let's think about when X_n / log(n) is greater than 1. That happens when X_n > log(n). So, the lim sup is the supremum of all accumulation points, which could be 1 or infinity, depending on whether X_n approaches 1 infinitely often or not.

Wait, but according to the Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities diverges, the lim sup of X_n is infinity. So, the lim sup of X_n / log(n) is infinity almost surely. Therefore, the event that lim sup is 1 has probability zero. So, the answer should be 0, which is option G.
</think>

The probability that the lim sup of X_n / log(n) equals 1 is zero because the lim sup is almost surely infinity due to the divergence of the sum of probabilities. Hence, the correct answer is G: 0.
