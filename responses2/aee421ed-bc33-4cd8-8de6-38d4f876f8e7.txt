Okay, so I've got this problem here about an automobile's CO gas production. Let me see if I can figure this out. Hmm. So the question says the car is going 10 miles per hour and produces 0.33 pounds of CO per mile. And I need to find out how many moles of CO are produced per mile. Oh wait, wait, the units are a bit tricky. Oh, right, the 0.33 is in pounds of CO per mile. But I'm supposed to find moles. So I think I'll need to convert pounds to moles.

Wait, I remember that moles are a unit of measurement related to the number of particles, like atoms or molecules. To convert pounds to moles, I must use the molar mass of CO. The molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance. CO has an atomic mass of carbon and oxygen. Carbon is about 12 g/mol, and oxygen is about 16 g/mol. So together, CO is 28 grams per mole. Wait, wait, but that's in grams. Oh, right, but the given data is in pounds. Oh, I see, the 0.33 is pounds, so I need to convert that to grams.

Wait, 1 pound is 453.592 grams. So 0.33 pounds times 453.592 grams per pound. Let me calculate that. 0.33 * 453.592. Hmm, 0.3 * 453.592 is 136.0776, and 0.03 * 453.592 is about 13.60776. Adding those gives approximately 149.685 grams per mile. Oh wait, wait, no, wait—wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, the problem says 0.33 pounds per mile. So 0.33 pounds is equal to how many grams? 0.33 * 453.592 = let's compute that. 0.33 * 453.592.

Let me do that. 453.592 * 0.3 is 136.0776, 453.592 * 0.03 is 13.60776. Adding those gives 149.685 grams per mile. Right, so 149.685 grams of CO per mile. But the molar mass of CO is 28 g/mol. So moles would be grams divided by molar mass. So 149.685 g / 28 g/mol. Let me compute that.

149.685 divided by 28. Well, 28 *5 is 140. So 5 gives 140. Subtract 140 from 149.685 leaves 9.685. 28 * 0.345 is about 9.685 (since 28 *0.3=8.4, 28*0.04=1.12, 28*0.005=0.14; 8.4+1.12=9.52 +0.14=9.66. Close to 9.685. So 5.345 would be about 149.685/28. Let me get precise. 28 *5.345 = 149.68, which is almost exactly the numerator. So about 5.345 moles per mile.

Wait, wait, but the options don't have 5.345. Let me check the options again. The options are A:5.4, B:9.0, C:2.5, D:7.3, E:3.8, F:4.8, G:4.1, H:5.9, I:8.1, J:6.2.

Wait, I got approximately 5.345, which is closest to option A:5.4. But I should check if my approach is correct. Another thing to consider: the units conversion. Because the question says "how many moles of CO are produced per mile." So yes, we're correct.

Wait, wait another thought: why are the options so varied? Let me recheck the calculations. Let me redo the steps.

First, the given is 0.33 pounds of CO per mile. So 0.33 lb/mi. To grams: 0.33 lb * 453.592 g/lb = 0.33 * 453.592. Let me compute 0.33 * 453.592.

I can compute 453.592 * 0.33:

453.592 * 0.3 = 136.0776

453.592 * 0.03 = 13.60776

Adding gives 136.0776 +13.60776 = 149.68536 grams per mile.

Molar mass of CO is 12 +16 =28 g/mol.

So moles per mile = 149.68536 /28 = let's calculate that.

28 times 5 is 140. 149.685 -140=9.68536 grams left.

28 goes into 9.68536 how many times? Well, 28 * 0.345 is 9.66, as before. So 0.345, so total is 5.345 moles/mile.

So approximately 5.345 moles per mile. Looking at the options, the closest is A:5.4. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the units more precisely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given is 0.33 pounds per mile, but the conversion factors are different. Wait, 1 pound is 453.592 grams. So 0.33 lb is 0.33 *453.592 = let me compute exactly.

0.33 * 453.592 = ?

Well, 0.3 *453.592 is 136.0776, and 0.03 *453.592 is 13.60776. Sum is 149.68536 g.

Divide by 28: 149.68536 /28.

Let me compute that. 28*5 = 140. 149.68536 -140 =9.68536.

How many times does 28 go into 9.68536? 28 *0.345 is 9.66. So 5.345. Oh, so about 5.345 moles/mile.

Looking at the options, 5.4 is available (option A). The next option is 5.9 (option H). So 5.345 is closest to 5.4.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value. Let me compute 149.68536 divided by 28 exactly.

149.68536 ÷28.

28 ×5 =140. 149.68536-140=9.68536.

Bring down a zero. 96.8536 ÷28. 28 *3=84. 96-84=12. 12.8536 ÷28. 28 ×0.455 is 12.74. So 0.455. So 5.345. So 5.345, which is approximately 5.35 moles per mile.

Looking at the options, 5.4 is a choice. So the answer should be option A:5.4 moles per mile.

To determine how many moles of CO are produced per mile, we start with the given data: 0.33 pounds of CO per mile. The molar mass of CO is 28 g/mol, and 1 pound equals 453.592 grams. 

First, convert 0.33 pounds to grams:
\[
0.33 \, \text{lb} \times 453.592 \, \text{g/lb} = 149.68536 \, \text{g}
\]

Next, calculate the number of moles by dividing the mass in grams by the molar mass:
\[
\frac{149.68536 \, \text{g}}{28 \, \text{g/mol}} = 5.345 \, \text{mol/mile}
\]

The closest option to 5.345 is 5.4 moles per mile.
