Question:

A man was standing on a street corner when a police officer approached him. The officer gently grabbed the man's arm and said, "Hey, I want to talk to you. " The man responded, "About what . . . I'm in a hurry to go home and watch the baseball game. " The officer then remarked, "Listen, what were you doing at the liquor store last week?" The man stated, "All right, man, I was there during the robbery. " Whereupon, the officer placed the man under arrest and charged him with robbery. The man was taken to police headquarters where he was booked. For the first time, he was given his Miranda warnings. He then waived his rights and confessed to being an accessory during the liquor store robbery. Afterward, the court appointed an attorney to represent the man.

The man's attorney now moves to suppress the secondstatement given at the police headquarters. This motion should be

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the scenario is about a man being detained after a robbery. He's given Miranda warnings and then he confesses. The court first denied him the first Miranda warning, but then he moved to suppress his second statement. Now, he's arguing that the second statement shouldn't be suppressed because the first statement was already denied. Hmm.

So, the key here is about Miranda rights and how they apply in different contexts. Miranda rights are like a legal obligation to give his Miranda warnings unless there's a good reason not to. The first statement was denied the warning, but the second statement is given by the same person. 

Wait, so the first statement was the man's confession at the police station. He was under duress or maybe it wasn't about his rights at that time. The Miranda warning applies to each statement in its context. The first statement was under a warning, so the second one, which he gave later, wasn't under the same warning. 

I think the issue here is the timing and the context of the statements. Miranda warnings are for a specific situationâ€”during a Miranda-invoked statement. If the statement was made during a Miranda-invoked situation, the warning applies. But if it's a statement made later, like at another location, the warnings don't apply.

In this case, the first statement was given while the man was under duress, which might have been a Miranda-invoked situation. So the first statement was denied the warning because he was in a situation where Miranda's rights were in effect. The second statement was made later, at another location, maybe without any situation involving Miranda. So the second statement doesn't have the same Miranda warnings.

Therefore, the court shouldn't suppress the second statement because it wasn't under a Miranda-invoked situation. The first statement was a Miranda-exculpatory statement, but the second wasn't. So the man's attorney's motion to suppress the second statement should be granted because the second statement wasn't subject to the Miranda warnings.

The correct answer is E: **not granted, because the man willingly gave the second statement.**

**Explanation:**

Miranda warnings apply only when the statement was made under a situation where Miranda's rights were in effect, such as during a Miranda-invoked statement. The first statement was made during a situation where Miranda's warnings were necessary, so the second statement, made later without such an environment, wasn't subject to the same warnings. Therefore, the second statement isn't tainted by Miranda rights, and the attorney's motion to suppress it should be granted.
