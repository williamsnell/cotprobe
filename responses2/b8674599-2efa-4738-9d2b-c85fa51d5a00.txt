Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much it'll cost to paint the walls and ceiling of this room. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The room's dimensions are 14 feet by 12 feet by 8.5 feet. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 8.5 feet? Or is that another dimension? Hmm, the question says "a room 14' × 12' × 8(1/2)%." Oh, wait, perhaps that's a typo. Let me think. Oh, perhaps it's missing a unit, but the way it's written, it's 8.5 feet. So the room is 14 ft by 12 ft by 8.5 ft? Or maybe the dimensions are 14 ft, 12 ft, and 8.5 ft. So that would be like length, width, height. So the room is 14 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 8.5 feet high.

But when painting walls and ceiling, I need to calculate the total area to be painted. So the ceiling is a rectangle, and the walls are four rectangles (two pairs of identical walls). But wait, the ceiling is one rectangle, so that's straightforward.

First, let's calculate the area of the ceiling. The ceiling is 14' by 12', so that's 14 * 12 = 168 square feet.

Next, the walls. There are two walls that are 14' long and 8.5' high. So each of those walls has an area of 14 * 8.5. Let me compute that: 14 * 8 is 112, and 14 * 0.5 is 7, so 112 +7=119 sq ft. So two walls would be 2 * 119 = 238 sq ft.

Then, the other two walls are 12' long and 8.5' high. Their area is 12 * 8.5. 12 *8 is 96, 12 *0.5 is 6, so 96+6=102. So two of those would be 2 *102=204 sq ft.

Adding all that up: ceiling is 168, walls 238 +204 = 442. So total area to paint is 168 + 442 = 610 square feet.

Now, I need to figure out how much paint is required and the cost.

The paint comes in two options: gallons at $6.50 each, covering 425 sq ft, or quarts at $1.85 each, covering 52 sq ft (since 425/8=53.125, wait, no, wait, 425 divided by 8 is about 53.125, but wait that's for per quart. Wait, no: 1 gallon is 4 quarts. So 425 sq ft per gallon is 53.125 sq ft per quart. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 425 sq ft per gallon is 425/4 = about 106.25 sq ft per quart. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's clarify: a gallon covers 425 sq ft, which is equal to 4 quarts. So per quart, it's 425/4 = 106.25 sq ft. Alternatively, 1 gallon is 128 fluid ounces, but that's probably not relevant here. The paint options are per gallon and per quart.

So the two paint options are:

1. Gallons: $6.50 per gallon, covering 425 sq ft. So each gallon covers 425 sq ft.

2. Quarts: $1.85 per quart, which is 425 /4 = 106.25 sq ft per quart.

Since the total area is 610 sq ft, I need to calculate how much paint is needed.

Option 1: If I buy gallons. Since each gallon covers 425, how many gallons do I need? Let's compute 610 /425 = 1.42857... So approximately 1.42857 gallons. Since you can't buy a fraction of a gallon, do I need to buy 2 gallons?

Wait, but wait, maybe the paint can be bought in any unit. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the area per paint and see how much each option costs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute how many quarts are needed for each.

Wait, the options are per gallon or per quart. So let's calculate how much paint the person will need in each option.

Wait, but perhaps the person can mix the two. But the question says "how do you find the cost of the paint." So perhaps we need to calculate which option is cheaper.

So, let's perhaps calculate the total area, then compute how much paint is needed for each option, and then compute the cost.

Total area: 168 (ceiling) + 238 (two walls) + 204 (other two walls) = 168 + 238 = 406; 406 + 204 = 610. So 610 sq ft.

Option 1: Gallons. Each gallon covers 425 sq ft. So 610 /425 is 1.42857 gallons. Since you can't buy a fraction, you'd need to round up to 2 gallons. So 2 gallons.

Cost would be 2 * $6.50 = $13.00.

Option 2: Quarts. Each quart covers 106.25 sq ft. So 610 /106.25 = approximately 5.729 quarts. So you can't buy a fraction, so you'd need 6 quarts.

6 quarts * $1.85 = 6 *1.85 = $11.10.

So between the two options, the quart option is cheaper. So the answer would be either option 2 at $11.10 or option 1 at $13.00. But wait, the options don't include $11.10, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait the options are A to J, and the options are the possible answers. The question is, which option is correct.

Wait, let me recheck the area calculation.

Wait, the room is 14'×12'×8.5'—so the ceiling is 14×12 = 168.

The walls: two walls are 14'×8.5' each. So 2*(14*8.5) = 2*(119) = 238.

The other two walls are 12'×8.5' each. 2*(12*8.5) = 2*(102) = 204.

Total walls area is 238+204=442.

Ceiling 168. So total area is 168+442=610.

So that's correct.

Now, calculating paint for each option.

Option 1: Gallons. 610 /425 = ~1.42857 gallons. Since you can't buy a fraction, you need 2 gallons.

Cost: 2 * $6.50 = $13.00.

Option 2: Quarts. 610 /106.25 = 5.729 quarts. So you need 6 quarts.

Cost: 6 * $1.85 = 11.10. So $11.10.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are:

A: $7.65

B: $10.20

C: $15.30

D: $26.00

E: $9.75

F: $2.80

G: $13.00

H: $19.50

I: $3.70

J: $6.50

So the options for the cost are either $13 or approximately $11.10. But since $11.10 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the paint options.

Wait, the paint options are: gallon for $6.50, covering 425 sq ft; quart for $1.85, covering 106.25 sq ft.

Wait, 1 quart is 1/4 gallon? Because 1 gallon is 4 quarts. So 1 quart is 425/4 = 106.25 sq ft.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate how much paint is needed in quarts.

Wait, 610 sq ft.

Each quart covers 106.25 sq ft. So 610 /106.25 = approx 5.729 quarts.

So you need 6 quarts.

So 6 quarts at $1.85 each is 6 * 1.85= $11.10.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area.

Wait, let me recheck the area.

Ceiling: 14 *12=168.

Walls:

- Two walls: 14*8.5=119, two walls: 238.

- Other two walls:12*8.5=102, two walls:204.

Total walls: 238+204=442.

Ceiling 168.

Total area: 168+442=610.

That's correct.

Hmm. So the only options that have a cost are in A to J.

Looking at the options:

Only option G is $13.00. So that's the cost for 2 gallons at $6.50 each.

But wait, could it be that some paint can be mixed for cheaper? Like, mixing gallons and quarts. But the question doesn't provide any option about that, so I think we have to assume that you can only buy in the given options.

Wait, but option G is $13.00, which is the cost for 2 gallons. The other option is $11.10 for 6 quarts. But since $11.10 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is the one that's cheaper, which is $13.00, option G.

So the answer should be G: $13.00.

To determine the cost of painting the walls and ceiling, we first calculate the total area to be painted.

1. **Ceiling Area**: 14 ft × 12 ft = 168 sq. ft.
2. **Wall Area**:
   - Two walls of 14 ft × 8.5 ft: 2 × (14 × 8.5) = 2 × 119 = 238 sq. ft.
   - Two walls of 12 ft × 8.5 ft: 2 × (12 × 8.5) = 2 × 102 = 204 sq. ft.
   - Total wall area: 238 + 204 = 442 sq. ft.
3. **Total Area**: Ceiling + Walls = 168 + 442 = 610 sq. ft.

Next, calculate the paint required:
- **Gallons**: Each gallon covers 425 sq. ft. 610 / 425 ≈ 1.4286 gallons. Since you can't buy a fraction, 2 gallons are needed at $6.50 each.
- **Quarts**: Each quart covers 106.25 sq. ft. 610 / 106.25 ≈ 5.729 quarts. You need 6 quarts at $1.85 each.

The costs are:
- Gallons: 2 × $6.50 = $13.00.
- Quarts: 6 × $1.85 = $11.10.

Since $11.10 isn't an option, the correct choice is the cheaper option, which is $13.00 (2 gallons).
