Okay, so I have this question about calculating the molecular formula of nicotine. Hmm, I remember that molecular weight is given as 162.1, and the percentages are 74.0% carbon, 8.7% hydrogen, and 17.3% nitrogen. I need to find the molecular formula using these percentages and the given atomic weights.

Wait, right. The first step is probably to find out how many atoms of each element are present in the molecule. I think I should convert the percentages into moles based on a 100g sample. Oh wait, but the atomic weights are given, so maybe it's easier to calculate the moles by dividing the percentage by the atomic weight.

Wait, no. Let me think. The percentage by mass means that in 100g of the compound, there are 74.0g of C, 8.7g of H, and 17.3g of N. Then I can convert each of these to moles by dividing by their respective atomic weights.

So, atomic weights I think: C is about 12.01, H is 1.008, N is 14.01. Let me jot that down.

For carbon: 74.0g / 12.01 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 74 divided by 12 is about 6.166, so 74/12.01 is approximately 6.16 moles.

Hydrogen: 8.7 / 1.008 ≈ 8.647 moles.

Nitrogen: 17.3 /14.01 ≈ 1.235 moles.

So the moles are approximately 6.16 C, 8.64 H, 1.235 N.

Now, I should find the ratio of these moles to each other. But wait, I can't just take them as is because the numbers are different. Maybe I should divide each by the smallest number of moles to get a ratio.

Wait, the smallest mole is nitrogen at about 1.235. Let me see: 1.235 is the smallest.

So I'll divide each by 1.235.

Carbon: 6.16 / 1.235 ≈ 5.0 (because 1.235 *5=6.175, which is close to 6.16).

Hydrogen: 8.647 /1.235 ≈ 6.999, which is almost 7.

Nitrogen: 1.235 /1.235 =1.

Wait, that gives me C5, H7, N1. But let me check the molecular formula. Wait, the sum of the atomic weights should equal the molecular weight.

Wait, the molecular weight is 162.1. Let's calculate the sum of the molecular formula I thought.

C5 is 5*12.01=60.05.

H7 is 7*1.008=7.056.

N1 is 14.01.

Total: 60.05 +7.056=67.106 +14.01=81.116 g/mol. But the given molecular weight is 162.1, which is way higher. So that can't be right. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the percentages are by mass, not by moles. Oh wait, no, I think I mixed up the approach.

Wait, my initial approach was correct—calculating moles from the percentages. But the sum of the molecular formula's atomic weights must equal the molecular weight.

Wait, but if I have C5H7N1, the molecular weight would be 5*(12) +7*(1)+14=60+7+14=81, but the given is 162. So that's way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm. So maybe my approach is wrong here. Let me think again.

Alternative method: Maybe I should assume a certain mass for the compound, like 100 grams. Then the number of moles for each element would be based on their percentages.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the moles based on the percentages and then find the simplest whole number ratio.

So, let's compute the moles as before:

Carbon: 74.0g / 12.01 g/mol = approximately 6.16 mol.

Hydrogen: 8.7g / 1.008 g/mol ≈8.647 mol.

Nitrogen:17.3g /14.01≈1.235 mol.

Now, the ratio of moles. To find the simplest whole number ratio, I'd divide each by the smallest value, which is 1.235.

So:

Carbon: 6.16 / 1.235 ≈5.0.

Hydrogen: 8.647 /1.235≈7.0.

Nitrogen: 1.235 /1.235=1.0.

So the ratio is 5:7:1, which would imply the formula is C5H7N1, but that gives a molecular weight of 5*12 +7*1 +14=60 +7 +14=81, which is way less than the given molecular weight of 162.

Hmm, so that can't be right. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I should use a different approach: the formula is C_xH_yN_z. The sum of (atomic weight * x) + (atomic weight * y) + (atomic weight * z) = 162.1.

And the percentages are:

C:74.0% → x*(12.01) = 74.0% of 100g → x = 74.0 /12.01 ≈6.16.

Similarly, H: y*(1.008) =8.7 → y≈8.7/1.008≈8.63.

N: z*(14.01)=17.3 → z≈1.235.

Wait, but wait. That can't be right because x, y, z would be moles, but in the formula, they are in whole numbers. So perhaps the approach is to find the smallest integer multiples.

Wait, but 6.16 is about 6, 8.63 is about 9, and 1.235 is about 1. But that gives a formula of C6H9N1, which gives a molecular weight of 6*12 +9*1 +14=72+9+14=95. Still not 162.5.

Hmm, perhaps I need to scale up by a factor.

Wait, maybe my method is wrong. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let's suppose the molecular formula is C_xH_yN_z. The molecular weight is 162.1, so:

12x + y +14z =162.1.

Also, the percentages are:

For C: (12x)/(12x + y +14z) )= 74.0/100 → (12x) = (74)*12x/(100) → wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the percentage for each element is ( (atomic weight * x) ) / (12x + y +14z) ) *100 = percentage.

So for C: (12x)/(12x + y +14z) )=0.74.

Similarly for H and N.

But this seems complicated. Let me try setting up equations.

Let me denote x, y, z as the moles per molecule. So x is the number of C atoms, etc.

So, 74% C: (12x) / (12x + y +14z) ) =0.74.

Similarly, 8.7% H: (1.008 y) / (12x + y +14z) =0.087.

17.3% N: (14.01 z) / (12x + y +14z )=0.173.

But I think this might be a system of three equations. Alternatively, I can find ratios.

Wait, let's think about the ratios again. The mole ratios are:

Carbon:74/(12.01) ≈6.16.

Hydrogen:8.7/(1.008)≈8.64.

Nitrogen:17.3/(14.01)≈1.235.

Wait, but how can the moles be in such ratios? Because 6.16 :8.64:1.235 might not be in the simplest ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can express each as a multiple of a common factor. Let's see:

Divide each by the smallest, which is 1.235.

6.16/1.235 ≈5.

8.64/1.235≈7.

1.235/1.235=1.

So, the ratio would be 5:7:1.

Which gives C5H7N1. But the molecular weight would be 5*12 +7*1 +14=60+7+14=81, which is way less than 162. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the molecular formula as C_xH_yN_z, and find x, y, z such that:

(12x + y +14z) = 162.1.

And the percentages are:

(12x)/(162.1) = 0.74 → 12x = 0.74 *162.1 → 12x ≈118.754 → x≈9.896 → ~10 C atoms.

Similarly, (1.008y)/(162.1)=0.087 → y≈0.087 *162.1 /1.008 ≈14.07 → ~14 H atoms.

And (14.01z)/(162.1)=0.173 →z≈(0.173 *162.1)/14.01 → Let's calculate 0.173 *162.1 ≈28.02 → 28.02 /14.01 ≈2.

So, x≈10, y≈14, z≈2.

So the molecular formula would be C10H14N2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is C10H14N2. So that's probably the correct one. But wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C10H14N2, which has a molecular weight of (10*12) + (14*1) + (2*14.01) = 120 +14 +28.02 = 162.02. Which is about 162.1, which matches.

But let me double-check the percentages because other options might be possible.

Wait, but earlier when I tried using the moles from the percentages, I got a molecular formula that gave a much lower MW. Oh wait, because that approach didn't take into account that the sum of the atomic weights multiplied by the formula must equal the molecular weight.

Ah! So perhaps that approach was incorrect because it assumed the moles were based on mass, but that's not the case. The correct approach is to set up the equations based on the percentages.

So, yes, the way I did earlier: solving for x, y, z as the number of atoms in the formula, and finding that they're approximately 10,14,2 respectively. So the molecular formula would be C10H14N2, which is option J.

To determine the molecular formula of nicotine, we start by using the given molecular weight of 162.1 g/mol and the percentage composition of its constituents: 74.0% carbon (C), 8.7% hydrogen (H), and 17.3% nitrogen (N). 

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each element based on percentages
The molecular weight of each element is used to convert the percentage composition into moles:
- Carbon: \( \frac{74.0}{12.01} \approx 6.16 \, \text{moles} \)
- Hydrogen: \( \frac{8.7}{1.008} \approx 8.64 \, \text{moles} \)
- Nitrogen: \( \frac{17.3}{14.01} \approx 1.235 \, \text{moles} \)

### Step 2: Find the simplest whole number ratio
To determine the simplest whole number ratio of atoms, divide each mole value by the smallest number of moles (1.235):
- Carbon: \( \frac{6.16}{1.235} \approx 5.0 \)
- Hydrogen: \( \frac{8.64}{1.235} \approx 7.0 \)
- Nitrogen: \( \frac{1.235}{1.235} = 1.0 \)

This gives a ratio of \( 5:7:1 \), suggesting a formula of \( \text{C}_5\text{H}_7\text{N} \).

### Step 3: Check the molecular weight
The molecular weight of \( \text{C}_5\text{H}_7\text{N} \) is calculated as:
\[
(5 \times 12.01) + (7 \times 1.008) + (1 \times 14.01) = 60.05 + 7.056 + 14.01 = 81.12 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
This is much lower than the given molecular weight of 162.1 g/mol, so the approach of using the mole ratios directly is incomplete.

### Step 4: Use the molecular weight to solve for the molecular formula
Let the molecular formula be \( \text{C}_x\text{H}_y\text{N}_z \). The molecular weight equation is:
\[
12x + y + 14z = 162.1
\]
Using the percentage composition:
- For carbon: \( \frac{12x}{162.1} = 0.74 \) ⟹ \( x \approx 10 \)
- For hydrogen: \( \frac{y}{162.1} = 0.087 \) ⟹ \( y \approx 14 \)
- For nitrogen: \( \frac{14z}{162.1} = 0.173 \) ⟹ \( z \approx 2 \)

Thus, the molecular formula is \( \text{C}_{10}\text{H}_{14}\text{N}_2 \).

### Step 5: Verify the molecular weight
The molecular weight of \( \text{C}_{10}\text{H}_{14}\text{N}_2 \) is:
\[
(10 \times 12.01) + (14 \times 1.008) + (2 \times 14.01) = 120.1 + 14.112 + 28.02 = 162.23 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
This matches the given molecular weight of 162.1 g/mol, confirming the molecular formula is \( \text{C}_{10}\text{H}_{14}\text{N}_2 \).

### Final Answer
The molecular formula of nicotine is \( \text{C}_{10}\text{H}_{14}\text{N}_2 \), which corresponds to option **J**.
