Okay, so I've got this problem here about linear transformations. Hmm, let's see. The question says that f is a linear transformation from the plane to the real numbers. So, f is a function that takes a 2D vector and gives a real number. That makes sense because the domain is the plane, which is two-dimensional, and the codomain is the real numbers.

Wait, linear transformations from R² to R are basically projections onto a line, right? Like, maybe onto the x-axis or y-axis or some other line. But the specifics aren't given. But the problem gives two specific values: f(1,1)=1 and f(-1,0)=2. And we need to find f(3,5).

I remember that for linear transformations, f(a*x + b*y) = a*f(x) + b*f(y). So, it's linear, so it's like a dot product with some vector (a,b) dotted with the input vector (x,y), and then taking the dot product with another vector in R¹, which is just a scalar. So f(x,y) = c*x + d*y, where c and d are constants determined by the transformation.

Wait, let me think again. Since f is linear, it can be represented as f(v) = v · w, where w is a fixed vector in R². So f takes a vector (x,y) and multiplies it by w, resulting in a scalar. So, the transformation is essentially the dot product of (x,y) with w.

So, given that, if I can find the vector w, I can compute f for any vector by taking the dot product. Let's find w.

We have f(1,1) = 1. So, (1,1) · w = 1. Let's say w is (a, b). Then, 1*a + 1*b = 1 → a + b = 1.

Similarly, f(-1, 0) = 2. So, (-1, 0) · (a, b) = 2 → (-1)*a + 0*b = 2 → -a = 2 → a = -2.

Now, plug a = -2 into the first equation: (-2) + b = 1 → b = 3.

So, w is (-2, 3). Therefore, the function f is f(x,y) = (-2)x + 3y.

Wait, let me check that. If I plug in (1,1), f would be (-2)(1) + 3(1) = -2 +3 =1, which matches. And for (-1,0), it's (-2)(-1) +0= 2, which also matches. Great.

Now, we need to find f(3,5). Plugging into the function:

f(3,5) = (-2)*3 + 3*5 = (-6) +15 =9.

Wait, but let me see if I made a mistake. Oh, wait, that's 9, which is option A. But wait, looking back, perhaps I should double-check the w vector.

Wait, another way to think about linear transformations. If f is a linear transformation from R² to R, then it's determined by a 1x2 matrix, say [a b], such that f(x,y) = a*x + b*y. So, the transformation is represented by the matrix [a b], and for any vector (x,y), the transformation is a*x + b*y.

Given that, the transformation is linear, so the matrix is [a b]. So, f(1,1) is a*1 + b*1 = a + b =1.

f(-1, 0) is a*(-1) + b*0 = -a =2 → a= -2.

So substituting a=-2 into a + b =1, gives -2 + b =1 → b=3. So, the transformation is [ -2 3 ].

So, f(3,5) is (-2)*3 +3*5 = (-6)+15=9. So, the answer should be 9, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A is 9. So that's the answer.

To determine \( f(3, 5) \), we start by identifying the linear transformation \( f \). Since \( f \) is a linear transformation from \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) to \( \mathbb{R} \), it can be represented as \( f(x, y) = ax + by \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. 

Using the given values:
1. \( f(1, 1) = a(1) + b(1) = a + b = 1 \)
2. \( f(-1, 0) = a(-1) + b(0) = -a = 2 \) which gives \( a = -2 \).

Substituting \( a = -2 \) into \( a + b = 1 \), we find \( b = 3 \). Thus, the transformation is \( f(x, y) = -2x + 3y \).

Calculating \( f(3, 5) \):
\[
f(3, 5) = -2(3) + 3(5) = -6 + 15 = 9
\]

The answer is **9**, which corresponds to option A.
