Okay, so I have this economics question here about the government's budget during economic expansions and recessions. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking about the federal government's budget situation under different economic conditions. The structure is a bit confusing, but I'll break it down.

So, the question is: For a given level of government spending, the federal government usually experiences a budget ______ during economic ______ and a budget ______ during economic _________.

The options are A through J, each with different combinations of surplus, deficit, expansion, and recession terms. I need to match the correct budget situation in each economic phase.

First, I remember that the government budget is the difference between government spending and its revenue. If spending exceeds revenue, it's a deficit. If revenue exceeds spending, it's a surplus.

When the economy is expanding, the government's demand for goods and services is high. So, the government wants to spend more. If spending is higher than what's needed (revenue), then the government has a budget surplus. So during expansion, the government budget is a surplus.

Wait, but during a recession, the economy isn't growing as fast as planned. So people and businesses are spending less. The government might have lower demand, so its spending might not be as high as it would during expansion. As a result, the government's budget might be a deficit because it's spending more than it's earning. So during a recession, the budget is a deficit.

Let me make sure I got this right. Expansionary economic conditions mean the economy is growing, so the government is likely increasing spending. If the spending is higher than tax revenues, it's a surplus. During a recession, the economy is shrinking, so the government might need less spending. If they spend more than what they can collect, it's a deficit.

So, the first part of the question: during economic expansion, the budget is a surplus. The second part: during a recession, it's a deficit.

Looking at the options:

Option A: surplus expansion surplus expansion → That can't be right because the second part is a deficit.

Option B: deficit recession deficit expansion → No, because in expansion it's surplus.

Option C: surplus expansion deficit recession → Wait, this says that during expansion it's a surplus, but during recession it's a deficit. That fits with what I thought.

Option D: deficit expansion deficit recession → No, that's the opposite of what I thought.

Option E: surplus expansion surplus recession → No, because the second part is a deficit.

Option F: deficit recession surplus expansion → No, the first part is a deficit, second is surplus.

Option G: surplus recession deficit expansion → No, because during expansion it's surplus, but during recession, the second part is a deficit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the correct answers.

So, during expansion (growth), the government's spending increases. If the government's spending is more than what it collects (taxes), then the budget is a surplus. So, the first blank is surplus.

During a recession (recessionary gap), the economy is struggling, so the government's spending might be too high. So, they've spent more than they can collect, leading to a budget deficit.

So the first part is surplus, the second is deficit.

Looking at the options:

Option C: surplus expansion deficit recession → That matches.

Let me check the other options quickly.

Option A: surplus expansion surplus expansion → No, second part is wrong.

Option B: deficit recession → No, first part is wrong.

Option G: surplus recession → No, because the second part is wrong.

So, option C must be correct.

The correct answer is based on the relationship between government spending, revenue, and economic conditions. During an expansionary economic condition, the government's demand for goods and services is high, leading to increased spending. If this spending exceeds tax revenues, the budget is a surplus. Conversely, during a recessionary condition, the economy is struggling, and the government may spend more than it can collect, resulting in a deficit. Therefore, the correct option is:

**C: surplus expansion deficit recession**

ANSWER: C
