Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again. It says, "Find the number that makes the statement 48 over 88 equals ? over 11 true." The options are A to J, with numbers from 3 to 12 and some others. Hmm, I think I need to find a number that replaces the question mark so that when I write it over 11, it's equal to 48 over 88. 

Wait, so the equation is 48/88 = ?/11. I need to find the missing numerator. Maybe I can simplify 48/88 first to see what it reduces to. Let me try that. Both 48 and 88 are divisible by 8, right? 48 divided by 8 is 6, and 88 divided by 8 is 11. So 48/88 simplifies to 6/11. Oh, wait, that's the same as the right side of the equation, which is ?/11. So that means the missing number must be 6, right? Because 6/11 equals 6/11.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Maybe I should cross-multiply to solve for the unknown. So, 48/88 = x/11. Cross-multiplying gives 88x = 48*11. Let's calculate 48 times 11. 48*10 is 480, plus 48 is 528. So 88x = 528. Now, divide both sides by 88: x = 528 / 88. Let's compute that. 88 times 6 is 528 because 80*6=480 and 8*6=48, so together 528. So x is 6. 

Wait, that matches what I thought earlier. So the correct answer should be 6. Looking at the options, D is 6. So the answer is D.

The correct answer is D: 6.

     D
