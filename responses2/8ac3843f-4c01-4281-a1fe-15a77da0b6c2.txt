Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again. It says, "The hypotenuse of a right triangle measures 10 inches and one angle is 45 degrees. What is the area of the triangle?" And there are options from A to J. Hmm.

Wait, right triangle with hypotenuse 10 and a 45-degree angle. Oh, wait a second. A right triangle with a 45-degree angle must be a 45-45-90 triangle, right? Because the other two angles would then have to add up to 90, so each is 45. So both non-right angles are 45 degrees.

In a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs are equal in length, and the hypotenuse relates to the legs by the formula hypotenuse = leg * sqrt(2). So if the hypotenuse is 10 inches, each leg should be 10 divided by sqrt(2). Let me calculate that.

Wait, but dividing by sqrt(2) is the same as multiplying by sqrt(2)/2. So each leg is (10 * sqrt(2))/2, which simplifies to 5*sqrt(2). So both legs are 5√2 inches long.

Now, the area of a triangle is (base * height)/2. Since the two legs are equal, I can use either one as the base and the other as the height. So the area would be (5√2 * 5√2)/2. Let me compute that.

Multiplying 5√2 by 5√2 is (5*5)(√2*√2) = 25 * 2 = 50. So the product is 50. Then divide by 2, so 50/2 = 25.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 25. So the area should be 25 square inches. Let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another approach: In a 45-45-90 triangle, legs are equal and hypotenuse is leg*sqrt(2). So if hypotenuse is 10, each leg is 10/sqrt(2) which is 5*sqrt(2). So legs are 5√2. Area is (5√2)^2 / 2. Wait, no, (5√2 *5√2) is 50, so 50/2 is 25. Yep, same result.

So the area is 25 square inches. So the correct answer is G.

The hypotenuse of a right triangle is 10 inches, and one angle is 45 degrees, making it a 45-45-90 triangle. Each leg is \( \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2} \) inches. The area is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 5\sqrt{2} \times 5\sqrt{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) square inches.

Answer: G
