Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's see... The question is about finding the half-life of ^33P, which undergoes beta decay. The given data is 2.000 picograms (pg) of ^33P decaying to 0.250 pg in 75.9 days. The options are from A to J, with different half-lives. 

Hmm, I remember that the formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t₁/₂), where N is the remaining quantity, N0 is the initial amount, t is the time elapsed, and t₁/₂ is the half-life. But wait, in this problem, we're given the initial amount and the amount after a certain time. So maybe I should rearrange this formula to solve for the half-life.

Wait, another approach is using the decay constant. The formula is N = N0 * e^(-λt). Oh, and the half-life t₁/₂ is related to the decay constant by t₁/₂ = ln(2)/λ. So first, I need to find λ, and then invert it to find the half-life.

Let me think about the numbers. The initial amount is 2.000 pg, and it decays to 0.250 pg. So the ratio N/N0 is 0.250 / 2.000 = 0.125. So N = 0.125 N0.

The formula for N is N = N0 * e^(-λt). So substituting, 0.125 = e^(-λ * 75.9 days). 

Wait, taking the natural log of both sides: ln(0.125) = -λ * 75.9. Let's calculate ln(0.125). I think ln(1/8) is about -2.079, because e^2 is about 7.389, so 1/8 is about 0.125. So ln(0.125) is approximately -2.079.

So, -2.079 = -λ * 75.9. Wait, the negatives cancel each other, so 2.079 = λ * 75.9. Solving for λ: λ = 2.079 / 75.9 ≈ 0.0274 days^-1.

But wait, the half-life t₁/₂ is ln(2)/λ. Since I calculated λ as 0.0274, let's compute t₁/₂. ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So t₁/₂ = 0.693 / 0.0274 ≈ 25.3 days. Oh wait, that's option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in the steps. So, step by step:

1. N/N0 = 0.25 / 2 = 0.125.
2. ln(N/N0) = ln(0.125) ≈ -2.079.
3. So, ln(0.125) = -λ * t.
4. -2.079 = -λ *75.9 → λ = 2.079 / 75.9 ≈ 0.0274.
5. t₁/₂ = 0.6931 / 0.0274 ≈ 25.3 days.

So the half-life is approximately 25.3 days. Looking back at the options, option A is 25.3 days. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the half-life of \( ^{33}\text{P} \), we use the radioactive decay formula:

\[
\frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \frac{N}{N_0} = 0.125 \) (since \( N = 0.250 \, \text{pg} \) and \( N_0 = 2.000 \, \text{pg} \)), \( t = 75.9 \, \text{days} \), and \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{N}{N_0}\right) = -\lambda t
\]

\[
\ln(0.125) = -\lambda \cdot 75.9
\]

\[
-2.079 = -\lambda \cdot 75.9
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{2.079}{75.9} \approx 0.0274 \, \text{days}^{-1}
\]

The half-life is related to the decay constant by:

\[
t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{\lambda}
\]

\[
t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{0.0274} \approx 25.3 \, \text{days}
\]

Thus, the half-life of \( ^{33}\text{P} \) is approximately **25.3 days**, which corresponds to option **A**.
