Okay, so I've got this question about X-linked disorders. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which disorder doesn't show X-linked inheritance. The options are A through H. I remember that X-linked conditions have different patterns based on whether the person is a carrier (heterozygous) or has two copies (homozygous).

Let me go through each option:

A. Haemophilia A: I think this is X-linked recessive. If you have one hemophilia allele, it's bad. The question is about whether it's X-linked. So yes, this is X-linked.

B. Fragile X syndrome: Also X-linked recessive. Same logic as Haemophilia A.

C. Becker muscular dystrophy: This is also X-linked. I remember it's an X-linked recessive condition. So yes, it's X-linked.

D. Color blindness: Wait, this is X-linked. Oh wait, no, color blindness is X-linked. I think it's X-linked, but wait, no—color blindness is X-linked recessive. So D is X-linked.

E. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: Oh, wait, that's an X-linked. Specifically, it's X-linked recessive. So yes.

F. Haemophilia B: Same as A, X-linked recessive.

G. Fabry disease: Hmm, I'm not as sure. I think Fabry disease is X-linked. Let me think—no, wait. I remember that Fabry disease is X-linked. Or wait, maybe it's another type. Alternatively, I think that some X-linked disorders are autosomal. So which ones are autosomal?

Wait, the options include some autosomal conditions. Let me check each:

Fragile X is X-linked.

Leukemia is a classic X-linked.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy: I think that's X-linked. Wait, I think it's X-linked recessive. So that's D.

Wait, the options given are from A to H, so the list includes:

A: X-linked recessive.

B: X-linked recessive.

C: X-linked recessive.

D: X-linked.

E: X-linked.

F: X-linked.

G: Fabry disease. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think. I recall that Fabry disease is X-linked. Oh wait, no, maybe it's not. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with another condition. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing it with another condition. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I got some of these wrong. Let me think about each condition:

X-linked recessive: A, B, C, D, E, F. All of these are X-linked.

X-linked dominant: Only theff (factor) is present.

Autosomal: Are there any autosomal conditions in the list? Let's see.

Leukemia is X-linked. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is X-linked recessive. Color blindness is X-linked.

Leukemia: X-linked. So are there any autosomal? Let me think:

Fragile X: X-linked.

Leukemia: Yes, definitely.

Duchenne: Yes.

Color blindness: X-linked (but wait, is it X-linked dominant or recessive? Wait, no, I think color blindness is X-linked recessive. Because the condition affects the eye color, which is usually due to the X chromosome. So if you have one affected X, you have the disease. So D is X-linked.

Leukemia is X-linked dominant. So that's X-linked.

So, which of the options is an autosomal condition?

Wait, the options are F through H. So let's check.

F: Haemophilia B: X-linked recessive.

G: Fabry disease: I'm not sure. Wait, I think Fabry disease is X-linked. Alternatively, wait, perhaps I'm mixing it with another condition. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and Fabry is autosomal.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, the question is which doesn't show X-linked. The options are F through H.

So, which of F-G-H is an autosomal condition.

Wait, let me think about each:

F: Haemophilia B: yes, X-linked.

G: Fabry disease: I think I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think that the Fabry disease is X-linked. Wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's not. Let me recall: I think Fabry disease is X-linked. So if that's the case, then it's X-linked and not an autosomal disorder.

Wait, wait. Another approach: Which of these conditions have no X-linked pattern? Because X-linked disorders are X-linked recessive or dominant.

So, which condition is autosomal?

I think the answer is G: Fabry disease.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing it with another condition. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer is H: Tay-Sachs.

Wait, no, because Tay-Sachs is X-linked recessive.

Wait, the options are F-G-H. So which is not X-linked.

Wait, the question is which does NOT show X-linked.

So, if the question is about X-linked disorders, which ones are in the options.

Wait, the options are from A to H, with the list being:

A: X-linked recessive.

B: X-linked recessive.

C: X-linked recessive.

D: X-linked.

E: X-linked.

F: X-linked recessive.

G: ?

H: X-linked recessive.

So which is X-linked? All except G.

So the correct answer is G: Fabry disease, which is not X-linked.

Wait, but I'm not sure about Fabry disease. Let me think again.

I think that Fabry disease is an autosomal recessive disorder. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another approach: I'll try to remember each condition.

X-linked recessive: A, B, C, D, E, F.

X-linked dominant: none of the options (since the options given are all X-linked recessive or we're looking for the one that isn't).

Wait, no, the options are all X-linked except G.

So, G: Fabry disease is the correct answer.

To determine which disorder does not show X-linked inheritance, it is essential to analyze the inheritance patterns of each condition listed:

1. **Haemophilia A**: X-linked recessive. If a person has one allele of the hemophilia gene, it is inherited, and the condition is present. This is X-linked.

2. **Fragile X syndrome**: X-linked recessive. Similar to Haemophilia A, this disorder is inherited from a single X chromosome and is X-linked.

3. **Becker muscular dystrophy**: X-linked recessive. This condition is inherited from a single X chromosome, making it X-linked.

4. **Color blindness**: X-linked recessive. The condition is inherited from a single X chromosome, so it is X-linked.

5. **Lesch-Nyhan syndrome**: X-linked recessive. This disorder is inherited from a single X chromosome and is X-linked.

6. **Haemophilia B**: X-linked recessive. Similar to Haemophilia A, this condition is inherited from a single X chromosome.

7. **Fabry disease**: This is a potential candidate for an autosomal condition. It is not X-linked, as it is not inherited from a single X chromosome.

8. **Tay-Sachs disease**: X-linked recessive. This is a classic example of an X-linked recessive disorder.

9. **Duchenne muscular dystrophy**: X-linked recessive. This disorder is inherited from a single X chromosome.

Since the question asks for the disorder that does not show X-linked inheritance, the correct answer is **Fabry disease**, as it is an autosomal condition.
