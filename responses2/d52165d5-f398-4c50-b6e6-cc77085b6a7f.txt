Okay, so I need to find the determinant of this 3x3 matrix: 

[[0, 1, 2],
 [7, 8, 3],
 [6, 5, 4]]

Hmm, determinants. I remember that for a 3x3 matrix, there's a formula involving the sum of products of elements and their corresponding cofactors. Alternatively, I think there's a method using expansion by minors or maybe row operations to simplify the matrix.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the rule of Sarrus? Or perhaps the cofactor expansion. Let me try cofactor expansion because I think that's more straightforward for me.

The cofactor expansion along the first row. The determinant would be calculated as:

0 * minor for element (1,1) minus 1 * minor for (1,2) plus 2 * minor for (1,3). But wait, actually, the sign alternates as + - + for each element in the top row. Oh wait, no, in cofactor expansion, the sign is (-1)^(i+j), so for the first row (i=1), the signs are +, -, + for j=1,2,3 respectively.

So the determinant is:

0 * C11 - 1 * C12 + 2 * C13.

But wait, the first element is 0, so the entire first term is zero. So the determinant simplifies to -1 * C12 + 2 * C13.

C12 is the cofactor of element (1,2). The cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) multiplied by the determinant of the minor matrix for (1,2). So, the minor matrix is the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.

So, removing row 1 and column 2, the minor matrix is:

[7, 3]
[6, 4]

The determinant of that is (7*4) - (3*6) = 28 - 18 = 10. Then, the cofactor C12 is (-1)^(3) * 10. (-1)^(3) is -1, so C12 is -10.

Next, C13 is the cofactor for (1,3). It's (-1)^(1+3) times the determinant of the minor matrix. The minor matrix is obtained by removing row 1 and column 3.

So the minor matrix is:

[7, 8]
[6, 5]

The determinant is (7*5) - (8*6) = 35 - 48 = -13. Then C13 is (+1) * (-13) = -13.

So putting it all together:

Determinant = 0 * C11 -1 * C12 + 2 * C13 = 0 -1*(-10) + 2*(-13) = 10 -26 = -16.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought the answer was one of the options. Wait, but the options don't include -16. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Let me check each step again.

First, the expansion along the first row. The elements are 0, 1, 2.

Cofactor C11 is (+1) * determinant of the minor matrix. The minor is removing row 1 and column 1, so it's:

[8, 3]
[5, 4]

Determinant is 8*4 -3*5 =32-15=17. So C11 is +17.

C12 is (-1)^(1+2) * minor determinant. The minor is:

[7, 3]
[6,4]

Determinant is 7*4-3*6=28-18=10. C12 is (-1)*(10)= -10.

C13 is (+1)^(1+3) =1 * minor determinant. The minor matrix is:

[7,8]
[6,5]

Determinant:7*5 -8*6=35-48= -13. So C13 is -13.

So the determinant is: 0*C11 -1*C12 +2*C13 = 0 -1*(-10) +2*(-13) = 0 +10 -26 = -16.

Hmm, but the options don't have -16. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should try a different approach, like row operations to simplify the matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps using the rule of Sarrus. Let me try that.

The rule of Sarrus is for 3x3 matrices. To apply it, you copy the first two columns next to the matrix:

0 1 2 | 0 1
7 8 3 |7 8
6 5 4 |6 5

Then, you multiply diagonally down to the right and sum them:

0*8*4 +1*3*6 +2*7*5 =0 + 18 +70 =88.

Then, multiply diagonally down to the left and sum:

2*8*6 +3*7*0 +4*1*0=96 +0 +0=96.

Subtract the left sum from the right sum: 88 -96 = -8.

Wait, but the determinant is -8? That's not matching any of the options either. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, maybe I should compute using another method. Let me compute the determinant using another approach. Maybe expanding along the third column.

Wait, the third column is 2,3,4. The determinant can be expanded as:

2*C13 -3*C23 +4*C33.

But wait, C13 is the cofactor for (1,3), which is (+1)^(1+3) * determinant of the minor.

The minor for (1,3) is:

[7,8]
[6,5]

Determinant is 7*5 -8*6=35-48=-13. So C13 is (-1)^(4) * (-13) = 1*(-13) =-13.

So 2*(-13)= -26.

C23 is the cofactor for (2,3). It's (-1)^(2+3) * determinant of the minor matrix. The minor is:

[0,1]
[6,5]

Determinant is 0*5 -1*6= -6. C23 is (-1)^(5) * (-6) = (-1)*(-6)=6.

So -3*6= -18.

C33 is the cofactor for (3,3). It's (+1)^(3+3) * determinant of the minor matrix.

The minor is:

[0,1]
[7,8]

Determinant is 0*8 -1*7= -7. So C33 is 1*(-7)= -7.

So 4*(-7)= -28.

Adding all parts: -26 -18 -28 = -72.

Wait, but the determinant according to this method is -72. So options are from A to J, and E is -48, J is 60. Hmm, none of these match -72. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansions. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should try calculating using another method, like row reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the determinant using the rule of Sarrus again, but maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, let's try the rule of Sarrus again.

Original matrix:

0 1 2

7 8 3

6 5 4

Copy first two columns:

0 1 2 | 0 1

7 8 3 |7 8

6 5 4 |6 5

Now, multiply diagonals going right:

0*8*4 =0

1*3*6= 18

2*7*5=70

Sum right: 0+18+70=88.

Now, diagonals going left:

2*8*6=96

3*7*0=0

4*1*0=0

Sum left:96+0+0=96.

Determinant is 88-96= -8.

Hmm, that's -8, which isn't among the options. So either I'm doing something wrong, or perhaps the question was about a different matrix.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Maybe using the rule of Sarrus isn't the best here. Let me try expanding along the third column.

Third column is 2,3,4.

Each term is element * Cofactor.

So:

2 * C13 +3*C23 +4*C33.

C13 is the cofactor for (1,3). The minor is:

7 8

6 5

Determinant:7*5 -8*6=35-48=-13. C13 is (+1)^(1+3)*(-13)= 1*(-13)=-13.

So, 2*(-13)= -26.

C23 is (-1)^(2+3) * minor determinant. Minus determinant? Let me see. The minor for (2,3) is:

0 1

6 5

Determinant: 0*5 -1*6= -6. C23 = (-1)^(5) * (-6) = (-1)*(-6)=6.

So, 3*6=18.

C33 is (+1)^(3+3) * minor determinant. The minor is:

0 1

7 8

Determinant:0*8 -1*7= -7. So C33 is (-7), since (+1)^6 is 1.

So 4*(-7)= -28.

Adding all terms: -26 +18 -28 = (-26 -28) +18= (-54)+18= -36.

Hmm, that's -36, which is option I.

Wait, but I'm getting -36, which is option I. But earlier calculations with expansion along first row gave me -16, which isn't an option. But with the third column, I got -36, which is option I.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first method. Let me try expanding the determinant again.

Expanding along the first row: 

0 * C11 -1 * C12 +2 * C13.

C11 is the minor for (1,1), which is:

8 3

5 4

Determinant:8*4 -3*5=32-15=17. C11 is 17.

C12 is (-1)^(1+2)*det(minor). The minor is:

7 3

6 4

Determinant= 7*4 -3*6=28-18=10. So C12= (-1)*10= -10.

C13 is (+1)^(1+3)*det(minor). The minor is:

7 8

6 5

det =35-48= -13. So C13= 1*(-13)= -13.

So determinant is 0 -1*(-10) +2*(-13)= 0 +10 -26= -16.

Hmm, this is conflicting. So I'm getting two different results: -16 from the first method and -36 from the third method. But both are not among the options given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the third method.

Wait, the third method: expanding along the third column.

The third column is 2,3,4.

Each term is element * Cofactor.

So for 2 (element at (1,3)): C13 is (-1)^(1+3) * det(minor). The minor is:

7 8

6 5

det =35-48= -13. So C13= (+1)^4 * (-13)= 1*(-13)=-13.

So 2*(-13)= -26.

Element 3 at (2,3): C23 is (-1)^(2+3) * det(minor) = (-1)^5 * det(minor). The minor is:

0 1

6 5

det=0*5 -1*6= -6. So C23= (-1)*(-6)=6.

3*6=18.

Element 4 at (3,3): C33 is (+1)^(3+3) * det(minor) = 1^6 * det(minor). The minor is:

0 1

7 8

det=0*8 -1*7= -7. So C33= (-7).

4*(-7)= -28.

Adding: -26 +18 -28= (-26-28)+18= (-54)+18= -36.

Which is option I.

But wait, the correct determinant shouldn't depend on our choice of expansion method. So perhaps I made a mistake in one of the calculations.

Wait, let me re-calculate the third column expansion.

Wait, perhaps I got C13 wrong. Let me recalculate C13.

C13 is the cofactor for element (1,3). The minor is:

7 8

6 5

det=7*5 -8*6=35-48= -13. C13 is (+1)^(1+3) * (-13)= 1 * (-13)= -13.

So 2*(-13)= -26.

C23 is the cofactor for (2,3). The minor is:

0 1

6 5

det=0*5 -1*6= -6. So C23= (-1)^(2+3) * (-6)= (-1)^5 * (-6)= (-1)*(-6)=6. 3*6=18.

C33 is the cofactor for (3,3). The minor is:

0 1

7 8

det=0*8 -1*7= -7. C33= (+1)^(3+3) * (-7)= 1 * (-7)= -7. 4*(-7)= -28.

Sum: -26 +18 -28= (-26-28)+18= (-54)+18= -36.

Hmm, that's correct. So this gives me -36, which is option I. So why did the first method give me -16?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me try expanding along the third column again.

Wait, perhaps I got the signs wrong. Let me check the first method again.

Expanding along the first row: 0*C11 -1*C12 + 2*C13.

C11 is 0.

C12 is (-1)^(1+2) * det(minor) = (-1)^3 * det(minor) = -1*(8*4 -3*6)= -1*(32-18)= -16. So C12= -16.

Wait, wait. The minor matrix for (1,2) is:

7 3

6 4

det=7*4 -3*6=28-18=10. So C12 is (-1)^(3) *10= (-1)*10= -10.

So in the expansion, -1*C12 is -1*(-10)=10.

C13 is (+1)^(1+3)*det(minor) = (+1)^4 * determinant of minor matrix for (1,3).

The minor is:

7 8

6 5

det=35-48= -13. So C13= (+1)*(-13)= -13.

Thus, determinant is 0*0 -1*(-10) +2*(-13)=0 +10 -26= -16.

Wait, so according to the first method, determinant is -16.

But according to the third method, it's -36. These are conflicting.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the third method because the third column has a 4 in the last position. Let me go through it again.

Third column: 2,3,4.

Each term is element * Cofactor.

Element 2 is at position (1,3). C13 is -13. So 2*(-13)= -26.

Element 3 is at (2,3). C23 is 6. So 3*6=18.

Element 4 is at (3,3). C33 is (-7). So 4*(-7)= -28.

Sum: -26 +18= -8; -8-28= -36.

So that's -36, which is option I.

Hmm, but why is the first method giving -16? I must have made a mistake in the first method.

Wait, let me re-calculate the first method.

Expanding along the first row.

The matrix is:

0 1 2

7 8 3

6 5 4

The first row is [0,1,2]. The determinant is:

0*(something) - 1*(something) +2*(something).

The first term is 0 * C11 = 0.

Second term is -1 * C12. C12 is the minor of (1,2), which is the determinant of the minor matrix:

7 3

6 4

det=7*4 -3*6=28-18=10.

So C12 is (-1)^(1+2) *10= (-1)^3 *10= -10.

Thus, the second term is -1*(-10)=10.

Third term is +2 * C13. C13 is the determinant of the minor matrix for (1,3):

7 8

6 5

det=35-48= -13.

So C13= (+1)^(1+3)* (-13)= (-13).

So third term is +2*(-13)= -26.

So determinant is 10 -26= -16.

So according to the first method, determinant is -16.

But according to the third method, it's -36.

Wait, but the sum of 10 and -26 is -16, but according to the third method, sum is -36.

Wait, that can't be. So I must have made a mistake in the third method.

Wait, no. Because in the third method, I correctly calculated each cofactor. So the third term is 2*(-13)= -26.

So the sum is 10 (from second term) plus (-26) (third term) = -16.

Hmm, so according to the first method, the determinant is -16, according to the third method, it's -36.

But this is conflicting. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in one of the methods.

Wait, perhaps the matrix I'm working with is different from the one in the question.

Wait, the matrix in the question is:

0 1 2

7 8 3

6 5 4

So according to that matrix, the determinant is -16, according to the third method.

But according to the first method, according to the first expansion, it's -16.

Wait, so perhaps the correct determinant is -16, but it's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it using another method, like using the formula for a 3x3 matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant by using the formula:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

a b c

d e f

g h i

So applying that formula to our matrix:

a=0, b=1, c=2,

d=7, e=8, f=3,

g=6, h=5, i=4.

So determinant is:

0*(8*4 -3*5) -1*(7*4 -3*6) +2*(7*5 -8*6)

Which is:

0 -1*(28 -18) +2*(35 -48)

= 0 -1*(10) +2*(-13)

= 0 -10 -26

= -36.

Ah, wait! So that's where I made the mistake. Because in the formula, the third term is +2*(7*5 -8*6), which is +2*(-13) = -26.

Wait, so the correct determinant is -36, which is option I.

So in the first method, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's do it again. Expanding along the first row.

The first row is [0,1,2].

The determinant is:

0*C11 -1*C12 +2*C13.

C11: minor is 8 3 over 5 4. det= 8*4 -3*5=32-15=17. C11=17. So 0*17=0.

C12: minor is 7 3 over 6 4. det=7*4-3*6=28-18=10. C12= (-1)^(1+2) *10= -10. So -1*(-10)= +10.

C13: minor is 7 8 over 6 5. det=7*5-8*6=35-48=-13. C13= (+1)^(1+3)*(-13)= (-13). So 2*(-13)= -26.

Adding up: 0 +10 -26= -16.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's -36. So where is the error?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, the formula I used was:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Which for our matrix is:

0*(8*4 -3*5) -1*(7*4 -3*6) +2*(7*5 -8*6)

Which is:

0*(32-15) -1*(28-18) +2*(35-48)

= 0*17 -1*(10) +2*(-13)

= 0 -10 -26 = -36.

So that's correct.

So why does the first method give -16, but the formula gives -36.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first method's calculation.

Wait, let me re-do the expansion along the first row with correct signs.

First row: 0 1 2.

The determinant is:

0 * C11 -1 * C12 +2 * C13.

C11 is the minor for (1,1), which is:

8 3

5 4

det=8*4 -3*5=32-15=17.

C11 is 17, but since it's multiplied by 0, it contributes 0.

C12 is the minor for (1,2):

7 3

6 4

det=7*4 -3*6=28-18=10.

But since it's multiplied by -1, it contributes -1*10= -10.

C13 is the minor for (1,3):

7 8

6 5

det=7*5 -8*6=35-48=-13.

Multiply by +2: 2*(-13)= -26.

So total determinant: 0 -10 -26 = -36.

Ah, so earlier mistake was in the first method. I thought it was -16, but actually, according to the formula, it's -36. So the correct determinant is -36, which is option I.

Wait, but why did the first method give -16? Because I must have made a mistake in which term is which.

Alternatively, perhaps in the first method, when I thought the term was +10, maybe it was actually -10.

Wait, no. The cofactor is (-1)^(i+j) * det(minor).

So for (1,2) element 1, the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) * det(minor) = (-1)^3 * 10 = -10.

So the term is -1 * (-10) = +10.

So the first method's calculation is correct. So the determinant is -36.

So the correct answer is option I.
</think>

The determinant of the given matrix is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{det}(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)
\]

For the matrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 2 \\
7 & 8 & 3 \\
6 & 5 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Applying the formula:

\[
\text{det}(A) = 0(8 \cdot 4 - 3 \cdot 5) - 1(7 \cdot 4 - 3 \cdot 6) + 2(7 \cdot 5 - 8 \cdot 6)
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
0(32 - 15) - 1(28 - 18) + 2(35 - 48)
\]
\[
= 0 \cdot 17 - 1 \cdot 10 + 2 \cdot (-13)
\]
\[
= 0 - 10 - 26
\]
\[
= -36
\]

Thus, the determinant is \(-36\), which corresponds to option **I**.

ANSWER: I
