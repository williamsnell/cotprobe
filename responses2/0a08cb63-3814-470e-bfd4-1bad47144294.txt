Okay, so I've got this question here about Palmyra Co. and their financial statements. Let me try to figure it out step by step because I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll give it a shot.

The question gives me a bunch of numbers related to their net income and some other adjustments. The task is to find out what Palmyra's comprehensive income is. Hmm, I remember that comprehensive income includes more than just net income. It also includes other items like certain adjustments, gains or losses, and certain items that aren't part of the net income. 

So let's look at what the question says. The net income is $11,000. That's straightforward. Then there's a positive $1,000 net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. Wait, what's that? I think that's an adjustment they made to their financial statements that affects past periods. It might be a gain or a loss. Since it's a positive number, that probably means it's a gain. So that adds $1,000 to net income.

Next, there's a $3,000 unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities. Oh wait, losses on investments are subtracted from net income. So that would be a reduction in the net income. But in this case, the loss is unrealized, meaning it's not realized yet. So that's another adjustment. So that would subtract $3,000 from the net income.

Then, a positive $2,000 foreign currency translation adjustment. Foreign currency translation adjustments can be gains or losses. Since it's positive, that's a gain. So that adds $2,000 to net income.

Lastly, there's a $6,000 increase in common stock. Common stock increases come from retained earnings, right? So that's a part of net income. Wait, no, common stock is part of the equity section, so it's part of the comprehensive income. So we add that to the net income.

Putting it all together: 

Net income is $11k.

Plus the cumulative effect (gain) of $1k.

Minus the unrealized loss of $3k.

Plus the foreign translation adjustment gain of $2k.

Plus the increase in common stock of $6k.

So the calculation is: 11,000 +1,000 =12k. Then minus 3,000 gives 9k. Plus 2,000 makes 11k. Plus 6k is 17k? Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate:

Start with 11k (net income).

Add 1k (cumulative effect gain): 12k.

Subtract 3k (unrealized loss): 9k.

Add 2k (translation): 11k.

Add 6k (common stock increase): 17k.

Wait, that's 11,000 +1,000 =12k.

12k -3k =9k.

9k +2k=11k.

11k +6k=17k. So comprehensive income would be $17,000. But wait, looking at the options, option A is $17,000. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that sometimes the common stock is part of the "other comprehensive income" section, and the net income is the main income. So comprehensive income is net income plus other comprehensive income. The net income is $11k. Other comprehensive income includes these adjustments.

Wait, let me rethink. The other comprehensive income would consist of the cumulative effect, foreign translation, unrealized loss, and the increase in common stock.

Wait, in this case:

- Cumulative effect is +1k.

- Unrealized loss is a loss, so subtract that (since it's not a gain, it's a loss on investments, which would be a negative effect on net income, hence subtract from net income. But in terms of comprehensive income, it's part of other comprehensive income.

Wait, no. Let me think: the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is a gain, so that's a positive adjustment to net income, so it's part of comprehensive income.

The unrealized loss is a loss on investments, so it's a reduction in net income. But in the context of comprehensive income, which includes other items, that would be a subtraction from net income.

The foreign translation was a gain, so that's a positive adjustment to net income, so it's in comprehensive income.

The common stock increase is part of the equity section, so that's an increase in retained earnings. In the case of comprehensive income, the common stock would be considered part of non-controlling interests or other equity items, but wait, no, the common stock is part of the income statement for equity. Wait, no, the common stock is part of the equity section. So in the statement of comprehensive income, the common stock is part of the "other comprehensive income" or is part of retained earnings?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: 

Net income is part of the income statement, and the other comprehensive income (OCI) includes items like unrealized holding losses, foreign currency translation gains, and changes in equity accounts that don't affect net income.

So in this case, the items to consider for OCI are:

- Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (gain: +1k).

- Unrealized loss on available-for-sale (loss not realized: -3k).

- Foreign translation gain (gain: +2k).

So adding those: 1k -3k +2k = 0k. So OCI is $0.

Then, the common stock increase is part of retained earnings, not OCI. So in the question, the common stock is an increase of $6k, which would be part of the net income and retained earnings.

Wait, but comprehensive income is calculated as net income plus other comprehensive income. So net income is $11k, and other comprehensive income is the sum of the adjustments that affect equity but not net income. So those adjustments are 1k (gain) -3k (loss) +2k (gain) =0. So OCI is $0.

So comprehensive income is net income ($11k) + OCI ($0) = $11k? But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A: $17,000, which is the sum of all items including net income and everything else. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another approach. Let's list all the items.

Net Income: $11,000.

Adjustments to net income:

+1,000 (cumulative effect gain)

-3,000 (unrealized loss)

+2,000 (translation gain)

+6,000 (common stock)

So adding them up: 11k +1k =12k; 12k -3k=9k; 9k +2k=11k; 11k +6k=17k. So that's comprehensive income $17k, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, the common stock increase is part of equity, so does it count as part of OCI? Because OCI includes items that affect equity but not net income.

Wait, the common stock is part of equity. So in the statement of comprehensive income, common stock's increase is part of equity, which is part of OCI. Or is it treated differently? I think it's part of equity, so it's included in OCI as a component. So yes, the common stock's increase is part of OCI.

So, adding all the adjustments: 11,000 +1k -3k +2k +6k = 17k.

So comprehensive income is $17,000, option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is $17,000, which matches. So that's the answer.

To determine Palmyra’s comprehensive income, we need to calculate the sum of net income and other comprehensive income adjustments. The adjustments include:

1. **Net Income**: $11,000  
2. **Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle**: $1,000 (gain)  
3. **Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities**: $3,000 (loss, which reduces net income)  
4. **Foreign currency translation adjustment**: $2,000 (gain, which increases net income)  
5. **Increase in common stock**: $6,000 (part of equity, included in other comprehensive income)  

The calculation is as follows:

- Start with net income: $11,000  
- Add cumulative effect gain: $11,000 + $1,000 = $12,000  
- Subtract unrealized loss: $12,000 - $3,000 = $9,000  
- Add foreign currency translation gain: $9,000 + $2,000 = $11,000  
- Add common stock increase: $11,000 + $6,000 = $17,000  

Thus, Palmyra’s comprehensive income is $17,000.
