Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the kinetic energy of a baseball. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is asking for the kinetic energy in foot-pounds, right? The baseball weighs 5 ounces and is thrown at 96 feet per second. Wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that kinetic energy is usually calculated using mass in slugs or using mass in pounds. Oh, right, because the standard unit for kinetic energy is foot-pounds, so maybe I need to convert the mass into slugs or use a different formula.

Wait, the formula for kinetic energy is KE = (1/2) * m * v². But I think I need the mass in slugs if I'm using the foot-pound formula. Alternatively, if I use the formula with pounds, I'd have to adjust because the units don't match. Oh, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I remember that in the English system, the formula for kinetic energy in foot-pounds is KE = (1/2) * m * v², but only if m is in slugs. Alternatively, if I use the formula where m is in pounds and v in feet per second, I think the formula is KE = m * v² / (2 * 32.2). Because 32.2 is the gravitational constant in feet per second squared.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: when using the English system, the kinetic energy in foot-pounds is KE = (1/2) * (mass in slugs) * (velocity in ft/s)^2. Alternatively, I've heard that KE can be calculated as (1/2) * m * v², but without considering the unit conversions properly. Wait, no, I think I need to find the mass in slugs first.

So first, I need to find the mass of the baseball. The baseball weighs 5 ounces. Oh wait, I'm pretty sure 1 slug is equal to 32.174 pounds. So, to convert ounces to pounds, I can divide by 16, since there are 16 ounces in a pound. So 5 ounces is 5/16 pounds. So m = 5/16 lb.

Wait, but sometimes the formula for KE in foot-pounds is written as KE = (1/2) * m * v², but when m is in slugs and v in ft/s, that's correct. Alternatively, if m is in pounds and v in ft/s, then KE = m * v² / (2 * g), where g is 32.2 ft/s². Wait, so using the second formula, it's (m * v²) / (2 * g).

So I can use either approach. Let me try both ways, just to make sure I get the right answer.

First, using slugs: m = 5/16 slug. v is 96 ft/s.

KE = 0.5 * (5/16) * (96)^2.

Let me compute that. 5/16 is 0.3125. 96 squared is 9216. So 0.3125 * 9216 = 2880. Multiply by 0.5 gives 1440. So KE is 1440 foot-pounds? But that's way higher than the options given, which go up to 72. So I must have made a mistake because the options are way smaller. So perhaps I should have used the other formula.

Ah, right. Let's try the other approach: m in pounds, v in ft/s. So KE = (m * v²) / (2 * g). So m is 5 ounces. Wait, 5 ounces is 5/16 lb, which is about 0.3125 lb. v is 96 ft/s, so v² is 9216. 5/16 * 9216 = (5 * 9216)/16 = (46080)/16 = 2880. Then divide by (2 * 32.2) which is 64.4. So 2880 / 64.4 ≈ let's see, 64.4 goes into 2880 how many times? Let me calculate:

64.4 * 45 = 2898 (since 64 * 45 is 2880, and 0.4*45=18 → 2898). So 45 would be 2898, but our numerator is 2880. So about 45.1. Oh wait, but 64.4 * 45.1 ≈ 2880. So the KE is approximately 45.1 foot-pounds. Looking at the options, B is 45 ft-lb, so that's the answer.

So, the correct answer should be B: 45 ft-lb.

To determine the kinetic energy of the baseball, we use the formula:

\[ KE = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{2 \cdot g} \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the baseball in pounds,
- \( v \) is the velocity in feet per second,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 32.2 ft/s²).

### Step 1: Convert the weight to mass
The baseball weighs 5 ounces. Since 1 pound equals 16 ounces, the mass in pounds is:

\[ m = \frac{5 \text{ ounces}}{16} = \frac{5}{16} \text{ lb} = 0.3125 \text{ lb} \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( v^2 \)
The velocity \( v \) is 96 ft/s. Thus:

\[ v^2 = 96^2 = 9216 \text{ ft}^2/\text{s}^2 \]

### Step 3: Plug into the formula
Substitute \( m = 0.3125 \text{ lb} \), \( v^2 = 9216 \text{ ft}^2/\text{s}^2 \), and \( g = 32.2 \text{ ft/s}^2 \) into the formula:

\[ KE = \frac{0.3125 \cdot 9216}{2 \cdot 32.2} \]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[ 0.3125 \cdot 9216 = 2880 \]

Now, calculate the denominator:

\[ 2 \cdot 32.2 = 64.4 \]

Finally, divide:

\[ KE = \frac{2880}{64.4} \approx 45.1 \text{ ft-lb} \]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated kinetic energy is approximately 45.1 ft-lb, which corresponds to option **B: 45 ft-lb**.
