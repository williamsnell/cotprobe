Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to apply the Graeffe's root squaring method to find the roots of the equation x³ + 3x² - 4 = 0 and then find the sum of these roots. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the Graeffe's method, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Graeffe's method is used to find the roots of a polynomial by transforming the equation so that squaring the roots makes it easier to find them. The idea is to eliminate the highest degree terms by using a substitution. I think the general steps involve dividing the polynomial by x^k, where k is the degree of the polynomial, and then subtracting the original equation multiplied by x^k to eliminate the x^(k+1) term.

Wait, wait, the equation here is a cubic, so k would be 3. Let me write down the original equation:

x³ + 3x² - 4 = 0.

So, to apply Graeffe's method, I need to perform the substitution y = x + a, where 'a' is chosen to eliminate the y² term. I think the formula for 'a' is -b/(3a) where the polynomial is written as ax³ + bx² + cx + d. In this case, a is 1, b is 3. So a would be -3/(3*1) = -1. So y = x - 1.

Wait, but I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. Another approach is to use the method where we let y = x + c, and find the right c such that the coefficient of y² becomes zero. The coefficient of y² in the transformed equation is (3 - 3c). Setting that to zero gives c = 1. So y = x + 1.

So the substitution is y = x + 1. Let me proceed with that.

First, express x in terms of y: x = y - 1.

Now, substitute x = y - 1 into the original equation:

(y - 1)³ + 3(y - 1)² -4 = 0.

Let me expand each term:

(y - 1)³ = y³ - 3y² + 3y -1.

3(y -1)² = 3(y² - 2y +1 ) = 3y² -6y +3.

So putting it all together:

(y³ -3y² +3y -1) + (3y² -6y +3) -4 = 0.

Combine like terms:

y³ + (-3y² + 3y²) + (3y -6y) + (-1 +3 -4) = 0.

Simplify each term:

y³ + 0y² -3y + (-2) = 0.

So the transformed equation is y³ -3y -2 =0.

Wait, but then, to eliminate the y term, I think I need another step. Because in Graeffe's method, I think we need to square the roots, so we might need to do another substitution. Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait no, I think the method is to perform the substitution y = x + a, as I did, and then each time, the coefficient of x^(n-1) is eliminated by choosing a suitable a. But in this case, the equation after substitution becomes y³ -3y -2=0. The highest degree term is y³, and the coefficient of y is -3. So now, to eliminate the y term, I might need to perform another substitution on this new equation.

Wait, but the original equation is cubic, so after the first substitution, the highest degree is y³, and the next term is y. So in the transformed equation, the coefficient of y is -3. To eliminate the y term, I can perform another substitution, let's say z = y + d, and choose d such that the coefficient of z² is zero.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try applying the method again on the new equation.

So, the new equation is y³ -3y -2 =0.

Let me write it as y³ + 0y² -3y -2=0.

The coefficients are a=1 (for y³), b=0 (for y²), c=-3 (for y), d=-2.

In Graeffe's method, the next substitution is z = y + a/(3a0), where a0 is the leading coefficient (1 here). So a is -b/(3a0) = -(0)/(3*1) = 0. So z = y + 0/(3*1) = y. Oh wait, that doesn't change anything. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where a = -b/(3a0). But here, b is zero. So a =0.

So, if a is zero, then the substitution is z = y + 0 → z = y. Hmm, that doesn't help. Maybe I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where a = -b/(3a0). But since b is zero here, perhaps this isn't the right way to proceed. Maybe it's better to proceed to the next step by squaring the roots.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Since the initial substitution leads to y³ -3y -2=0, and I'm not sure how to eliminate the y term further, maybe I should proceed to the next step of squaring the roots.

Wait, the idea of the Graeffe method is to keep squaring the roots until the coefficients become manageable. So after the first substitution, the equation is y³ -3y -2 = 0. Let's call the roots of this equation y1, y2, y3.

Then, the next step is to square each root. So, the roots of the next equation would be y1², y2², y3², which are the squares of the original roots. So, to find the sum of the squares of the roots, I can use the method of Newton's identities, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between the sums of powers of roots.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to find the sum of the squares of the roots of x³ +3x² -4=0, which is what the question is asking. Because the original question asks for the sum of the roots after applying the method, but perhaps it's not necessary to compute the roots themselves. Wait, let's re-examine the question.

The question is: "Apply the Graeffe's root squaring method to find the roots of the equation x³ +3x² -4=0 correct to two decimals. What's the sum of these roots?"

Wait, so the roots are found using Graeffe's method. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it because the question is about the sum of the roots, not the individual roots. Oh wait, the sum of the roots of the original equation can be found using Vieta's formula, which is given by the negative coefficient of x² divided by the coefficient of x³.

In the original equation, the sum of the roots is -3/1 = -3. So the sum is -3, which would be the answer. But wait, let me think again. Do I need to find the roots via Graeffe's method, or is this just a shortcut?

Wait, no, the question says to apply Graeffe's method to find the roots. But the sum of the roots is always the same, regardless of the method. Because the sum of roots is determined by the polynomial's coefficients, which don't change. So, even after applying Graeffe's method, the sum of the roots remains -3.

Wait, but I'm not sure because applying the method might change the roots, but their sum would still be the same. So perhaps the answer is -3, which is option J.

But wait, the options don't include -3 except for option J. Let me check the options again.

Options: A:3, B:-6, C:4, D:0, E:1.5, F:2.5, G:-2.5, H:-4, I:-1.5, J:-3.

So J is -3. So the answer would be J.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not be using Vieta's formula because the question is about applying the method. So maybe the question is a trick question, and the sum is indeed the same as the original.

But wait, wait. Let me re-examine the problem.

The question says: "Apply the Graeffe's root squaring method to find the roots of the equation x³ +3x² -4=0 correct to two decimals. What's the sum of these roots?"

So perhaps, despite the method, the sum remains the same. So the answer is -3, which is option J.

But let me think again. The sum of the roots is always given by -b/a, where b is the coefficient of x² and a is the coefficient of x³. For the original equation, that's -3/1 = -3. So the sum is -3, regardless of how the roots are found.

So why would the question ask to apply the method? Because the sum remains the same. So the answer is J.
</think>

The sum of the roots of the equation \( x^3 + 3x^2 - 4 = 0 \) can be found using Vieta's formula, which states that the sum of the roots is \( -b/a \), where \( b \) is the coefficient of \( x^2 \) and \( a \) is the coefficient of \( x^3 \). Here, \( b = 3 \) and \( a = 1 \), so the sum is \( -3 \).

The application of the Graeffe's method does not change the sum of the roots because Vieta's formula gives the sum directly from the coefficients, regardless of the method used to find the roots.
