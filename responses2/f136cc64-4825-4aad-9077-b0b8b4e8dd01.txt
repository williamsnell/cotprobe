Question:

An owner operated a successful retail business. He decided he wanted to retire and listed his business for sale. A buyer saw the listing and visited the retail business. The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect "unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business. " Subsequently, the buyer made no effort to attempt to obtain a loan from a bank so that the sale could be finalized. After several months, the owner filed suit against the buyer for breach of contract. Which of the following will be the owner's strongest argument in support of his action against the buyer for breach of contract?

Options:

A: The buyer's lack of effort in obtaining a loan is a breach of good faith and fair dealing.
B: The buyer was under a duty to inform the owner of her decision not to seek a loan.
C: Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.
D: The owner suffered financial loss due to the buyer's inaction in seeking a loan.
E: The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.
F: The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a "condition" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.
G: Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.
H: The buyer did not explicitly state in the contract that she would not seek a loan.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here. Let's break it down step by step. The scenario is about an owner who wants to retire and sell his business. He listed it for sale, and a buyer approached him to buy it. The buyer agreed but needed a loan from a bank to do so. The parties drafted a contract stating the sale wouldn't take effect unless the buyer gets the loan. After the buyer didn't get the loan, the owner sued for breach of contract.

The question is asking what the owner's strongest argument would be. The options are A through H. I need to think through each option carefully.

First, let's outline the contract. The contract says the sale would only happen if the buyer gets a loan. So, the condition is "unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank." Now, the buyer didn't do her due diligence, didn't get the loan, and waited until several months later before the owner sued.

The owner's argument is likely about the condition being breached. Now, the key here is understanding what a "condition" in a contract entails. Typically, a condition is an obligation that arises from the contract. If the condition is a condition of the contract, the buyer's failure to meet it might be a breach.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The buyer's lack of effort is a breach of good faith and fair dealing. Hmm. Not sure. Good faith is about intent to avoid harm, which the buyer might have shown. But the condition is about obtaining a loan. Maybe this isn't the strongest argument because the condition is about a specific action, not just effort.

Option B: The buyer was under a duty to inform the owner of not seeking a loan. That seems relevant. If the condition is an implied duty to act in good faith, then not fulfilling it (i.e., not seeking the loan) constitutes a breach. So this might be the strongest argument.

Option C: The condition should be excused. The condition is a condition of the contract, meaning the buyer's failure to meet it would breach. So excusing it isn't correct because the condition isn't optional; it's a requirement. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: The owner suffers financial loss. That's an issue, but it's more about the outcome of the sale. The question is about breach of contract, not about whether the sale happened. So D is not the strongest argument here.

Option E: The buyer breached an implied promise to make reasonable effort. The buyer didn't inform the owner of not seeking the loan. That's a breach of implied duty. So E is a possible argument.

Option F: The loan condition wasn't worded as a condition. So F is saying the loan part of the condition wasn't a condition but a promise. But in contracts, the wording matters. The contract says the sale wouldn't take effect unless the buyer gets the loan. That's a condition, so F is incorrect.

Option G: The condition should be struck. No, because conditions are part of the contract. So G is wrong.

Option H: The buyer didn't state the condition. Wait, the contract already says the condition. So H isn't an argument because the contract explicitly mentions the condition. The fact that the buyer didn't state it isn't a breach, it's just part of the contract.

So the main issue is whether the condition was breached. The contract requires the buyer to get the loan. If the buyer didn't get it, the condition wasn't met, so that's a breach.

Now, looking back at the options, A and B are about the buyer's actions (good faith) and the duty to make reasonable effort.

Wait, another point: In contract law, a condition is generally an implied duty. So if the contract says the sale won't take effect unless the condition is met, then the buyer's failure to meet it (by not seeking the loan) constitutes a breach. So the strongest argument would be that the buyer breached the condition, which is a condition of the contract.

So looking at the options, option B says the buyer was under a duty to inform the owner of not seeking a loan. That would be a breach because the buyer didn't fulfill their duty to make a reasonable effort. Alternatively, option E: the buyer breached an implied promise to make reasonable effort. Wait, but the wording in the contract is about getting a loan. So the condition is about getting the loan, not about the effort to make a reasonable effort.

Wait, the condition is about the loan, not about the effort. So, the contract says "unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan," which is a condition on the buyer's part. So the buyer's failure to obtain the loan constitutes a breach of the condition.

So the correct answer would be either A or B. But which is stronger?

Option B says the buyer was under a duty to inform the owner of not seeking a loan. That's about being informed (good faith), which is a positive aspect. The breach of contract is about failing to meet a specific condition, not about falsifying information.

Option E says the buyer breached an implied promise to make reasonable effort. The contract doesn't say that the buyer must make reasonable efforts to obtain the loan. The condition is that the sale doesn't happen unless the buyer does so. So the buyer didn't make reasonable efforts to get the loan, which is a breach.

So the strongest argument is E: The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan.

Wait, but the contract says the condition is about obtaining a loan. So the implied duty is to get the loan. So if the buyer didn't do that, they breached the condition.

Wait, but the contract doesn't state that the buyer must make reasonable efforts. So the contract doesn't say that the buyer has to do something else. But the condition is that the sale doesn't happen unless the buyer gets the loan.

So the contract's condition is about the buyer getting the loan. So the buyer's failure to get the loan is a breach of that condition. So the breach is about not fulfilling the condition, not about making reasonable efforts.

So the correct answer is E: The buyer breached an implied promise (duty) to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan. Because the contract doesn't specify that the buyer has to make a reasonable effort, so their failure to do so is a breach.

Wait, but in contract law, the condition is a condition on the buyer's performance. So if the buyer doesn't fulfill the condition, that's a breach.

Alternatively, if the contract says the buyer must make a reasonable effort, then not fulfilling that would be a breach.

But the contract in this question doesn't specify that the buyer must make a reasonable effort. It only says the sale wouldn't take effect unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan. So the condition is about "success in obtaining the loan." The buyer's failure to do so is a breach. The contract doesn't require the buyer to make a reasonable effort to obtain the loan, so the breach is about failing to meet the condition.

So the correct argument is that the condition was breached. So the options are between A, B, E.

But the options are about whether the buyer breached a duty to make a reasonable effort.

Option B says the buyer was under a duty to inform the owner of not seeking a loan. That's about being informed (good faith), which is a positive aspect. The breach of contract is about failing to meet a specific condition, not about falsifying information.

Option E says the buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort. Since the contract doesn't specify that the buyer must make a reasonable effort, their failure to do that is a breach.

So the strongest argument would be E: The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort.

Alternatively, if the contract had said the buyer must make reasonable efforts to get the loan, then E would be the correct argument. But in this case, it's not specified, so E is the correct.

Wait, but another angle. The condition is about the buyer getting the loan, not about the effort to make a reasonable effort. So the breach is about failing to meet the condition, not about the effort.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The owner's strongest argument would be that the buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan. The contract states that the sale wouldn't take effect unless the buyer obtained a loan, but it does not explicitly require the buyer to make reasonable efforts to do so. Therefore, the failure to obtain the loan constitutes a breach of the contract, not of a duty to make reasonable efforts.
