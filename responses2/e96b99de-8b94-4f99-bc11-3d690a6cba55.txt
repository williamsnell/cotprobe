Question:

A homeowner was injured when an automatic cutoff switch failed to function on a snowblower he was using. The cutoff switch had functioned well for a year after he purchased the snowblower but failed after the machine had been improperly repaired by a mechanic. The snowblower's operating manual contained a clear and prominent warning against making the very alteration to the switch mechanism that was made by the mechanic. The mechanic, however, did not have a manual available when he repaired the snowblower. Does the homeowner have a viable claim against the manufacturer of the snowblower for damages?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel.
B: Yes, because the snowblower should have had a backup safety system in place.
C: No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party. a third party.
D: No, because the mechanic is solely responsible for the improper repair.
E: No, because the homeowner was contributorily negligent in failing to furnish the snowblower's manual to the mechanic.
F: No, because the homeowner should have ensured the mechanic had access to the correct manual.
G: Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.
H: Yes, because the cutoff switch should not have failed regardless of the repair.
I: Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the switch mechanism more robust.
J: No, because the homeowner should have requested a professional repair from the manufacturer.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a homeowner who was injured because his snowblower's automatic cutoff switch failed. Let me try to break this down.

The situation: The homeowner used his snowblower, which had a functioning cutoff switch for a year. Then, a mechanic fixed it, but the change they made wasn't noted in the manual. The manual warned against that kind of alteration, so the mechanic didn't follow it properly. Now, the question is whether the homeowner can sue the manufacturer for damages.

First, I need to remember the main principles of negligence and defective products. The key here is whether the manufacturer is liable because they didn't warn the repair personnel about the change, leading to the failure. But wait, the question is about the manufacturer's liability, not the repair person's.

So, the mechanics of the situation. The homeowner claims that the manufacturer didn't warn the repair person (the mechanic) about the failure. But the question is about the manufacturer's liability. So, did the manufacturer make a defect?

Wait, the manual didn't warn the mechanic about the alteration. The mechanic didn't have access to the manual because he didn't have a manual when he repaired. So, the mechanic didn't know about the change, leading to the failure of the switch. As a result, he probably was at fault. But the question is about the manufacturer's liability.

Wait, the manufacturer's liability would arise if the product itself was defective. The switch failure is a defect in the snowblower. The warning in the manual was a defect, but the repair wasn't made because the manual wasn't available. But the question is about the manufacturer's liability for damages. So, the manufacturer's liability is about whether they failed to warn the repair person, which would be negligence on their part.

Wait, the problem is the manufacturer's liability. The manual was a defect and warned against the alteration. But the repair didn't follow the manual because the mechanic didn't have it. So, the mechanic's failure is his own, not the manufacturer's. So, the manufacturer is not liable for the mechanic's negligence. Because the manufacturer's liability is about the product's design, not the repair of a third party.

So, the injury was caused by the failure of the switch, which was a defect in the snowblower. The warning was a defect, but the repair was done by a third party (mechanic) without the manual. The manufacturer's liability is about whether they had a defect in the product. The warning was a defect in the manual. So, if the manual was defective, the manufacturer could be liable for defects. But the question is, the manual was clear and prominent, so perhaps it was a defect. But the repair failed because the mechanic didn't have the manual.

So, the issue is whether the manufacturer is liable for the failure of the switch. The question is about the manufacturer's claim against the snowblower's owner (homeowner). So, the manufacturer's liability is about the product's design. The warning was a defect in the manual, which would protect the manufacturer because it should have warned repair personnel about the change. But wait, the mechanic did not follow the warning because he didn't have the manual. So, the warning was a defect, but the repair was defective because the mechanic didn't have the manual. How does that affect the manufacturer?

Wait, the manufacturer's liability could be for the failure of the switch because it's a defect. The warning was a defect in the manual, but the repair failure is the mechanic's fault. So, the question is about the manufacturer's claim; so, if the manual was defective, the manufacturer might be liable for defects, which would include the failure of the switch. But the question is whether the manufacturer can claim damages. So, the issue is the defect in the switch, which is a product defect.

Wait, the warning in the manual was a defect, but the repair failed because the mechanic didn't have the manual. So, did the mechanic's failure lead to the product defect? The product defect is the switch failing. So, the manufacturer's liability is about whether they had a defect in the product. The warning was a defect in the manual, which should have warned repair personnel. The mechanic didn't have the manual, so he didn't know about the change, leading to failure. So, the manual was a defect. But the manufacturer's liability is about the product itself, not the repair of the repair person.

So, the question is, did the manufacturer have a defect in the product? The switch's failure is a product defect because it's a defect in the snowblower. The warning was a defect in the manual, but the repair failure is a defective repair (the mechanic didn't follow the warning). But the manufacturer's liability is about whether they had a defect in the product.

So, the answer is whether the manufacturer should have made the manual available to the repair personnel, which would have prevented the failure. If the manual was a defect, the manufacturer can claim for the product defect. But the question is about the manufacturer's claim, not the repairer's.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Yes, because the snowblower should have had a backup system. Hmm, but the question is about the manufacturer's liability.

Option F: No, because the homeowner should have had access to the manual. But that's about the repairer, not the manufacturer's claim.

Option H: No, because the homeowner was negligent in giving the manual. But the manufacturer's claim is about the product's design, not the repairer's negligence.

Wait, the question is about the manufacturer's liability. So, the manufacturer is suing for damages. The product's defect is the switch failure, which is a product defect. The warning was a defect in the manual, but the repairer didn't follow it.

But the answer is about the manufacturer's claim. So, the question is, if the manufacturer made a defect (the manual), and the repairer didn't follow it, but the repairer's fault is the mechanic's, not the manufacturer's. So, the manufacturer is not liable for the damage; the repairer's fault is separate.

Wait, but the question is whether the manufacturer can claim for the damage caused by the switch failure. So, the product had a defect, and the failure caused the injury. So, the manufacturer's claim is about whether they were negligent in making the defective device, which would be negligence on their part. So, the manufacturer's liability is about their design, not the repairer's negligence.

So, the manufacturer's claim is whether the product was defective, not the repairer's. The warning was a defect in the manual, but the repair failed because the mechanic didn't have the manual. So, the warning was a defect, but that's not the issue here. The product's defect is the switch failure.

So, the manufacturer's claim is about whether the product was defective. The warning was a defect, but that's a separate issue. So, if the product was defective, the manufacturer can sue for the damages.

But the question is whether the manufacturer is liable. So, the answer depends on whether the product was defective.

The warning was a defect in the manual, which should have warned repair personnel about the change. Since the mechanic didn't have the manual, the failure was due to the mechanical defect, not the defective manual. So, the manufacturer's claim is about the product's design, not the repairer's.

So, the manufacturer's claim would be that the switch was defective. So, the warning is a defect in the manual, but that's a separate issue. The product's defect is the switch failure.

So, the question is, did the manufacturer make a defect? Yes, the switch was a product defect. The warning was a defect in the manual, but that's not the issue. So, the manufacturer's claim is that the product was defective, which it is.

So, the correct answer would be whether the manufacturer can claim for the product defect.

Wait, but the options are:

Option G: Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.

Option F: No, because the homeowner should have had access to the manual.

Wait, the question is about the manufacturer's liability. So, the product was defective, so the manufacturer can claim for damages.

But the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Yes, because manufacturer should have warned.

B: Yes, because snowblower should have backup.

C: No, injury from substantial alteration by third party. Third party alterations are generally considered by the manufacturer's fault, as the repairer isn't the owner.

D: No, mechanic is solely responsible.

E: No, because of negligence by the mechanic.

F: No, because the homeowner should have manual.

G: Yes, because the switch caused injury.

H: No, because of the homeowner's negligence.

I: Yes, because manufacturer should have made warning.

J: No, because the homeowner should have repaired from manufacturer.

Wait, the question is about the manufacturer's claim. So, if the product was defective, can the manufacturer claim? The issue is whether the product had a defect. The warning was a defect in the manual, which should have been a defect in the repair process. But the repairer didn't have it. So, the damage was caused by the defect in the product, not by the repairer's failure.

So, the manufacturer's claim is that the product was defective, which it is. So, the answer should be G: Yes, because a defect caused the injury.

Wait, but the question is whether the manufacturer can claim for damages. The issue is whether the product was defective. If the product was defective, then yes, the manufacturer can claim for damages.

So, the answer is option G.

But wait, the options are about whether the manufacturer is liable. So, the correct answer would be that yes, because the product was defective. But I'm a bit confused because option F says no because the homeowner should have had the manual, but that's about the repairer's fault. The manufacturer's claim is about the product's design.

So, the correct answer should be G: Yes, because the snowblower had a defective switch, leading to the injury.

The homeowner is suing the manufacturer for damages due to an injury caused by an unintended failure of a snowblower's automatic cutoff switch. The key issue is whether the manufacturer is liable for this claim. The switch's failure is a product defect, and the warning in the snowblower's manual was a defect, but the repair failure was due to the mechanic not having the manual. The manufacturer's claim is about the product's design, not the repairer's negligence.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A, C, D, E, F, J**: These options address the manufacturer's claim about the repairer's negligence or the necessity of the repairer's expertise. However, the manufacturer's liability is about the product design, not the repairer's action.
- **B**: Incorrect. The manufacturer is not liable for the repairer's negligence; the claim is about the product's design.
- **G**: Correct. The switch's failure is a product defect, and the warning in the manual was a defect. Thus, the manufacturer is liable for damages.
- **H**: Incorrect. The claim is about the manufacturer's liability, not the homeowner's.
- **I**: Incorrect. The manufacturer's claim is about the product's design, not the repairer's fault.
- **J**: Incorrect. The claim is about the manufacturer's liability, not the repairer's fault.

The correct answer is **G**, as the manufacturer is liable for damages due to the defective snowblower.
