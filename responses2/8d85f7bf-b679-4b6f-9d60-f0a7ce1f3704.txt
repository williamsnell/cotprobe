Okay, so I've got this question here about an investment strategy and figuring out the optimal gamma. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says the strategy is of the form (γ, 0, 0), which I think refers to the investment wheel where you bet on a certain outcome. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact terminology, so maybe I should think about what this means in terms of expected returns.

The goal is to find the factor by which your money multiplies after n steps, given the strategy (γ, 0, 0). The factor is given as (1 + 2γ)^{n/2} * (1 - γ)^{n/2}. Wait, why is that? Let me think about how that factor comes about. 

Hmm, I remember that in investment strategies, especially ones involving multiple bets or outcomes, the growth can be modeled using multiplicative factors. The (1 + 2γ) and (1 - γ) terms probably represent the expected returns or growth factors for each step, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, maybe the strategy is such that each step, you have a certain probability of increasing your money by a factor of (1 + 2γ) and a probability of decreasing by (1 - γ). So if you apply this strategy over n steps, the overall factor would be the product of each step's growth factor. But why would each step have two different factors?

Wait, perhaps the strategy involves two possible outcomes each step. For example, you could win a certain amount with probability γ and lose with probability (1 - γ), or something like that. So each step, your return is either (1 + 2γ) or (1 - γ). But wait, that doesn't quite add up because the exponents are n/2 each. So perhaps it's a scenario where each step has two possible outcomes, each contributing their own multiplicative factors, and after n steps, the total is the product of those factors. 

Wait, perhaps each step involves two outcomes with specific probabilities, and the overall return is the product of all these steps. Since the exponents are n/2 each, that suggests that each step has two possible outcomes, each contributing a factor of (1 + 2γ)^{1/2} and (1 - γ)^{1/2} respectively. But that might not add up. Alternatively, perhaps each step has a factor of (1 + 2γ) and the other step is (1 - γ), and each step occurs with some probability. 

Wait, maybe the strategy is such that each step is a bet where you have a probability of 2γ to gain a certain return and (1 - 2γ) to lose something, but that doesn't fit the given factor. Alternatively, perhaps each step has two possible outcomes: one where you gain (1 + 2γ) and another where you lose (1 - γ), and each outcome happens with equal probability, or perhaps with probabilities that lead to the overall factor. 

Wait, perhaps each step has a probability of 0.5 for each outcome. So, for each step, you could either multiply your money by (1 + 2γ) or by (1 - γ), each with probability 0.5. Then, over n steps, the expected growth would be the product of the individual factors. So after n steps, the total factor would be (1 + 2γ)^n * (1 - γ)^n, multiplied by (0.5)^n. But the given factor is (1 + 2γ)^{n/2} * (1 - γ)^{n/2}, so that suggests that each step actually only contributes a factor of sqrt(1+2γ) and sqrt(1-γ), or something like that. 

Alternatively, maybe each step involves a multiplicative factor of (1 + 2γ) and another of (1 - γ), and the overall factor is the product of these steps. But then, after n steps, the factor would be (1 + 2γ)^{n} * (1 - γ)^n. However, the given factor has exponents of n/2 each, so perhaps each step only contributes a factor of sqrt(1+2γ) and sqrt(1-gamma). So the overall factor would be [(1+2γ) * (1 - gamma)]^{n/2}. Or wait, maybe each step's contributions are (1+2γ) and (1-gamma), so after n steps, it's (1+2γ)^{n} (1 - gamma)^n, but the given factor is (1+2γ)^{n/2} (1 - gamma)^{n/2}, so perhaps each step has a multiplicative factor of (1+2γ) and (1 - gamma), but each step only contributes a square root. That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe each step, the investment's return is either (1 + 2γ) or (1 - gamma), and each of these happens with some probability, but perhaps each step only involves one of these outcomes. For example, each step, you either have a gain factor (1 + 2γ) or a loss factor (1 - gamma), each occurring with probability 0.5. So after n steps, the total factor would be the product of these, which would be (1+2γ)^{n/2} (1 - gamma)^{n/2}, because each step contributes either a gain or a loss. But then, why would the exponents be n/2?

Wait, perhaps each of the two outcomes (gain and loss) happens with probability 0.5 each, so after n steps, the number of gains and losses would each be n/2, so the overall factor is the product of (1+2γ) and (1 - gamma) each raised to the power of n/2. So the factor is (1+2γ)^{n/2} * (1 - gamma)^{n/2}. That makes sense. 

So the total factor after n steps is the product of each step's outcome. Each step contributes either (1 + 2γ) or (1 - gamma), each with 50% chance. So over n steps, the expected value would involve multiplying each step's contribution. However, when you multiply (1 + 2γ)^{n/2} * (1 - gamma)^{n/2}, that's equivalent to taking the geometric mean of these two possible outcomes. 

Wait, but actually, the multiplicative factors are (1+2γ) and (1 - gamma), each occurring 50% of the time. So after n steps, the total factor is the product of these. So the overall factor is (1 + 2γ) raised to (n/2) times (1 - gamma) raised to (n/2). Because in each step you have 50% chance to have (1+2gamma), which would contribute a factor of (1+2gamma)^(n/2), and in the other 50% chance, you have (1 - gamma)^(n/2). So multiplying these gives the total factor.

Now, to find the value of gamma that maximizes this factor. So we need to maximize the function F(gamma) = (1 + 2 gamma)^(n/2) * (1 - gamma)^(n/2).

Since n is a positive integer and it's the same for all terms, it's sufficient to consider F(gamma) = (1 + 2 gamma) * (1 - gamma), because the exponents are the same. So actually, F(gamma) = [(1 + 2 gamma)(1 - gamma)]^{n/2}.

To maximize F(gamma), since the exponent is a positive number, the maximum of F(gamma) is the same as the maximum of the base, which is (1 + 2 gamma)(1 - gamma).

So let's compute (1 + 2 gamma)(1 - gamma) = 1*(1) + 1*(-gamma) + 2 gamma *1 + 2 gamma * (-gamma) = 1 - gamma + 2 gamma - 2 gamma^2.

Simplify: 1 + ( -gamma + 2 gamma ) = 1 + gamma. So the expression becomes (1 + gamma) - 2 gamma^2.

So F(gamma) is then [1 + gamma - 2 gamma^2]^{n/2}.

We can ignore the exponent as it's the same for all gammas, so the problem reduces to maximizing the function f(gamma) = 1 + gamma - 2 gamma^2.

To find the maximum, take the derivative of f with respect to gamma and set it to zero.

df/dgamma = 1 - 4 gamma. Setting this to zero: 1 - 4 gamma = 0 → 4 gamma = 1 → gamma = 1/4 = 0.25.

Wait, but I should check the second derivative to ensure it's a maximum. The second derivative is -4, which is negative, confirming a maximum at gamma=0.25.

So the optimal gamma is 0.25, which is option B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the multiplicative growth factor of the investment strategy and determine the value of γ that maximizes this factor.

The overall factor after \( n \) steps is given as \((1 + 2\gamma)^{n/2}(1 - \gamma)^{n/2}\). To maximize this factor, we can focus on the base function \( f(\gamma) = (1 + 2\gamma)(1 - \gamma) \), since the exponents \( n/2 \) are constant for all γ.

Expanding \( f(\gamma) \):
\[
f(\gamma) = (1 + 2\gamma)(1 - \gamma) = 1 - \gamma + 2\gamma - 2\gamma^2 = 1 + \gamma - 2\gamma^2.
\]

This is a quadratic function in the form \( f(\gamma) = -2\gamma^2 + \gamma + 1 \). To find the maximum, we take the derivative with respect to γ and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{df}{d\gamma} = 1 - 4\gamma = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25.
\]

To confirm it's a maximum, we check the second derivative:
\[
\frac{d^2f}{d\gamma^2} = -4 < 0,
\]
indicating a concave downward shape and thus a maximum at \( \gamma = 0.25 \).

From the options provided, the value \( \gamma = 0.25 \) corresponds to option B.
