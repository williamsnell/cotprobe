Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about primary prevention. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand what primary prevention entails. From what I remember, prevention refers to measures taken to avoid or prevent the occurrence of a disease or condition. Primary prevention is a part of public health strategies.

Wait, I think the key here is to break down the options. The question asks what the facets of primary prevention are. Let's look at each option.

Option A: Universal, selective, and preventive. Hmm, I'm not sure about "universal" here. Primary prevention might be more about specific measures rather than something that applies to everyone. Maybe "universal" doesn't fit.

Option B: Primary, secondary, and indicative. I'm not sure about "secondary" here. Also, "indigenous" sounds more like a term for a specific person, so that might not fit.

Option C: Primary, secondary, and quaternary prevention. Quaternary refers to the fourth level, which I'm not familiar with in this context. I don't think that's the right term for primary prevention.

Option D: General, selective, and indicative. "General" might be too broad. Primary prevention is more specific than general, so that might not be right.

Option E: Universal, selective, and indicative. Again, "universal" doesn't seem to fit. Primary prevention is more targeted than universal.

Option F: Primary, universal, and indicative. Wait, "universal" might not be correct. Primary prevention is more localized rather than broad.

Option G: Universal, specific, and indicative. I think "specific" is more accurate than "universal." So this might be off.

Option H: Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. I'm not sure about "tertiary" here. I think "tertiary" could refer to something like the third level, but I'm not certain about the context here.

Option I: Primary, selective, and tertiary. Again, "selective" might not be right. I thought primary prevention is more about specific prevention measures rather than selective ones.

Option J: None of the above. That's a possibility, but I should look for a better fit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the terms. Primary prevention is about preventing diseases in their early stages. It's not a broad or general approach but rather more specific. So the terms should be more specific.

Looking back, "selective" might refer to the fact that prevention is tailored to specific groups, like age groups or certain risk factors. Alternatively, perhaps the correct terms are more about the levels of prevention.

Wait, maybe primary prevention is a general term, but it includes various levels like specific prevention, which is more about selecting the right prevention methods. So maybe the terms in the options are more about the types of prevention rather than levels.

Alternatively, "specific" and "selective" might be the right terms. So, looking for options that include "specific" and "selective." Let's see:

Option B: Primary, secondary, and indicative. No, that doesn't fit.

Option H: Primary, secondary, and tertiary. Hmm, tertiary prevention might refer to something like tertiary care, but that's more about treatment rather than prevention.

Wait, maybe "tertiary prevention" isn't the right term. Let me think about the structure of primary prevention. I remember that primary prevention includes prevention at the individual, population, and community levels. But the terms in the options might be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct terms are "selective" and "specific," so an option that includes those. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, I don't think any of them have "specific" and "selective." So maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the options are referring to the types of prevention measures. For example, primary prevention might include measures like vaccination, early detection, and treating pre-existing conditions. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each option means.

Option E: Universal, selective, and indicative. Maybe "universal" is wrong because primary prevention is more specific. "Selective" might refer to targeting certain groups, which is part of primary prevention. "Indicative" could mean indicating the need for prevention, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct terms are "specific" and "selective." But none of the answer options have both without using "primary."

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think about the options again. What do I know about primary prevention?

Primary prevention is a strategy that targets specific prevention actions. So the terms should relate to that. The options might be using "selective" and "specific" as key terms.

Looking for options that use "specific" and "selective." But the options provided don't have both. So perhaps the correct answer is H: Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.

Wait, no, I don't think so. Wait, another thought: I'm a bit unsure about what 'tertiary' refers to. I recall that in healthcare, tertiary refers to the third level of care, but in prevention, maybe it's a different term.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E: Universal, selective, and indicative. I'm not sure about 'universal' here. I thought primary prevention was more localized than universal.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J: None of the above. But why? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are using "primary" as the first term, so I need to choose an option that starts with primary. Let's see the options:

A: Universal, selective, and preventive
B: Primary, secondary, and indicative
C: Primary, secondary, and quaternary prevention
D: General, selective, and indicative
E: Universal, selective, and indicative
F: Primary, universal, and indicative
G: Universal, specific, and indicative
H: Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention
I: Primary, selective, and tertiary
J: None of the above.

So, the only primary options are B, H, and J. Since I don't think the terms are 'selective' or 'tertiary,' maybe the correct answer is J, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the first part of the correct answer is "primary." Let's think about what the other terms might be. 'Selective' and 'quaternary'?

Wait, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is B: Primary, secondary, and indicative. No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's B: Primary, secondary, and indicative. Wait, no. Or perhaps the correct answer is E: Universal, selective, and indicative. But why 'universal'? I thought primary prevention was more about specific prevention rather than a broad approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. But I'm not sure about the term 'tertiary' in this context.

Wait, another angle: The question is about the 'facets' of primary prevention. Each option lists three terms. So, perhaps the answer is B: Primary, secondary, and indicative. I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I'm going to go with option E: Universal, selective, and indicative. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, none of the above, which would be J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: Primary, secondary, and indicative. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct terms for primary prevention are 'specific' and 'selective,' but since none of the options have both, perhaps the 'tertiary' refers to something else. Maybe 'tertiary' is not the correct term.

Wait, I remember that in some contexts, 'tertiary prevention' might refer to measures taken at the third level, like tertiary care, but that's more about treatment than prevention. So perhaps the term 'tertiary' is used here incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: Universal, selective, and indicative. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me try to eliminate the options.

Option B: Primary, secondary, and indicative. 'Indicative' might refer to the indicators needed for prevention, which is part of primary prevention. But I'm not sure if the terms are correct.

Option H: Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. 'Tertiary' might be part of the levels, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: Universal, selective, and indicative. But why 'universal'? I thought primary prevention is more localized.

Wait, I think the correct answer is E: Universal, selective, and indicative. No, because primary prevention is more specific. So perhaps 'selective' is correct.

Wait, I'm going to think again. The options are:

A: Universal, selective, and preventive
B: Primary, secondary, and indicative
C: Primary, secondary, and quaternary
D: General, selective, and indicative
E: Universal, selective, and indicative
F: Primary, universal, and indicative
G: Universal, specific, and indicative
H: Primary, secondary, and tertiary
I: Primary, selective, and tertiary
J: None of the above.

I think the correct answer is B: Primary, secondary, and indicative. But I'm not certain because 'selective' might be part of it.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: Universal, selective, and indicative. I'm not sure.

The question asks for the facets of primary prevention. After analyzing the options, the most plausible answer is **E: Universal, selective, and indicative**. This is because "universal" might refer to broad approaches, "selective" to targeting specific groups or conditions, and "indicative" to indicating the need for prevention. However, this choice is based on the assumption that none of the other options correctly describe the terms.

ANSWER: E
