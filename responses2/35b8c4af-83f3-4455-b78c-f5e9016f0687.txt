Question:

A scientist used his car to transport a large quantity of highly flammable petroleum derivatives that he needed for his scientific research. The petroleum derivatives were sold in ordinary glass gallon jugs. Shortly after putting the jugs in the back of his car, the scientist was driving along a city street. He was thinking about a difficult scientific question and not paying attention to his driving. As a result, he lost control of the car and drove up onto the sidewalk. The car flipped over. The glass jugs in the back of the car were broken, and the chemicals in them spilled out onto the sidewalk. Moments later, a doctor who witnessed the accident came running over to render medical assistance. As he approached the overturned car, however, the doctor slipped on the petroleum derivatives that had spilled onto the sidewalk. The doctor fell and fractured his ankle. If the doctor asserts a claim against the scientist based on strict liability, will the doctor prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the doctor should have been more careful around the accident site.
B: No, because the scientist was legally transporting the chemicals for his research.
C: Yes, because the scientist was not exercising reasonable care in driving and handling dangerous chemicals.
D: Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.
E: Yes, because the scientist should have warned the doctor about the chemicals.
F: No, because it was unforeseeable that the doctor's injury would result from the type of harm threatened.
G: Yes, because the scientist should have used a safer method to transport the chemicals.
H: No, because the chemicals were not the direct cause of the doctor's injury.
I: Yes, because the transportation of flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs necessarily involves a high degree of risk of serious harm.
J: No, because the doctor assumed the risk by voluntarily acting as a Good Samaritan.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about strict liability and whether a doctor can claim against a scientist who was transporting highly flammable chemicals. Hmm, strict liability is when an action is strictly liable, meaning the person is entirely at fault, regardless of whether they were negligent. But I need to think through the facts here to determine if the doctor's claim holds.

Let me read the scenario again. The scientist put a bunch of glass jug petroleum derivatives in his car. The jugs were ordinary, so they're probably not safe, but the scientist was driving and not paying attention. He lost control, flipped the car, and the jugs broke. The chemicals spilled onto the sidewalk, and the doctor who saw him ran over to help. He slipped and broke his ankle because the spilled chemicals were on the ground. The question is whether the doctor can claim strict liability against the scientist.

Wait, strict liability applies when the defendant's action is strictly liable. So, the question is about whether the scientist was strictly negligent in transporting the chemicals.

The options are A through H, with H being "Yes, because the scientist should have used a safer method to transport the chemicals." So, the main issue is whether the scientist's negligence was enough to make him strictly liable.

Why does strict liability matter here? Strict liability is about liability regardless of whether the defendant was negligent. So, if the scientist's failure to exercise reasonable care was enough to make him strictly liable, then the doctor's claim would succeed. But if the scientist was negligent and therefore not strictly liable, the doctor might have a case.

The scientist was driving along a city street and lost control, which is dangerous. So, he didn't have the intent to stop or use reasonable precautions. The main question is whether his actions were negligent.

In such situations, even if the defendant was negligent, the plaintiff can still recover if the defendant's negligence was "unreasonably dangerous," making the plaintiff strictly liable. The key here is the dangerousness of the activity. If the act of transporting highly flammable chemicals is inherently dangerous, then the scientist is strictly liable regardless of negligence.

The chemicals being in glass jugs might be a factor. Glass is not airtight, so even a small fire could spread, but flammable chemicals like petroleum derivatives are dangerous. So, the act of transporting them is inherently dangerous.

The scientist was driving, not paying attention, and flipping the car. The question is whether that driving was negligent. If the act of driving caused the accident, which it did, but the person taking the risk (the scientist) wasn't negligent, then strict liability might apply.

Wait, but the scientist was not negligent in his actions. He didn't fail to exercise reasonable care. So, even if the activity is dangerous, the scientist wasn't negligent. Therefore, the doctor's claim against him would be based on strict liability because his negligence wasn't the issue.

But wait, the question is whether the doctor's injury was caused by the scientist's negligence. If the scientist was not negligent, then the claim would fail. Alternatively, if the scientist's failure to exercise reasonable care made him strictly liable, then the doctor can claim.

Wait, another angle: Did the scientist's negligence cause the accident? He was driving, not paying attention, and flipped the car. That seems like a negligent action. If he was negligent, then even if the activity was dangerous, strict liability would apply.

Wait, but driving while not paying attention is a negligence. So, the scientist's negligence would make him strictly liable. Because he was negligent in his driving. So, the doctor's loss of life is not due to negligence; it's due to the negligence of the scientist. Therefore, the doctor's claim would be based on strict liability because the scientist was negligent.

But wait, another point: Glass jugs. If the scientist was transporting the dangerous chemicals, even if he wasn't negligent, the act of transporting them is inherently dangerous. So, if the scientist failed to exercise reasonable care, he was strictly liable. But in this case, the scientist didn't fail to exercise reasonable care; he was negligent in driving. So, the doctor is correct in claiming strict liability because the scientist was negligent.

Wait, but the options. Option H says the scientist should have used a safer method. So, if he had used a safer method, he would be strictly liable. But the question is about his negligence. So, the doctor is correct that the scientist was negligent, making him strictly liable.

Wait, but the question is about whether the doctor's claim would prevail. So, the doctor is correct to assert strict liability because the scientist's negligence caused the accident. Therefore, the answer would be H. Or wait, no. Let me think again.

Strict liability is when the defendant is entirely at fault, regardless of negligence. So, even if the scientist was negligent, if he was not negligent, then the claim would not be based on negligence but on strict liability.

Wait, but the options suggest that H is about using a safer method, which would be negligence. So, if the scientist was negligent, then under strict liability, the claim would succeed. So, the doctor's claim would prevail because of strict liability.

Wait, but the question is whether strict liability applies. If the scientist was negligent in driving, then yes, the doctor's claim would be based on strict liability.

So, looking at the options, option H says, "Yes, because the scientist should have used a safer method to transport the chemicals." That would make the scientist strictly liable because he was negligent. So, the doctor's claim against him would be valid.

Alternatively, another angle: Could the accident be reasonably caused by the scientist's failure to exercise reasonable care? Well, if the accident was due to negligence, then it's strict liability. But if it was caused by negligence, the accident wasn't reasonably caused. So, if the accident was caused by negligence, the driver is liable strictly.

Wait, another factor is whether the accident was reasonably caused. If the accident was caused by the scientist's negligence, then it's not reasonably caused. But in this case, the accident was due to his failure to exercise reasonable care. So, the accident was not reasonably caused, making the scientist strictly liable.

Wait, but the question is about strict liability, not negligence. So, regardless of whether the accident was reasonably caused, the doctor's claim is based on strict liability.

So, the correct answer would be whether the scientist was negligent. If he was negligent, then his negligence made him strictly liable, so the doctor's claim would succeed.

But looking at the options again:

H: Yes, because the scientist should have used a safer method to transport the chemicals.

If the scientist was negligent and should have used a safer method, he's strictly liable. So, yes, the doctor's claim would win.

Another option is option A, which says the doctor should have been more careful. But if he was negligent, the doctor's negligence would not be the issue. So, the doctor's claim is based on strict liability, not his negligence.

Wait, but perhaps the scientist was negligent in handling the chemicals, making him strictly liable. But if the act of transporting the chemicals is inherently dangerous, then he's strictly liable regardless of his negligence.

So, the correct answer is H. The scientist was negligent in his driving, making him strictly liable, so the doctor's claim proceeds.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the doctor can assert strict liability against the scientist for his accident. Strict liability applies when an action is strictly liable, meaning the person is entirely at fault, regardless of negligence. The key issue is whether the scientist's actions, such as driving and handling dangerous chemicals, were negligent.

The scientist lost control of his car, flipped it, and caused the spill of highly flammable petroleum derivatives onto the sidewalk. The act of driving and handling the dangerous chemicals is inherently dangerous, making it a factor in the strict liability determination.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. The doctor should not assert strict liability based on being more careful; strict liability requires the defendant's actions to be negligent.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. The scientist was not negligent in driving; his failure to exercise reasonable care made him strictly liable.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. The scientist was not negligent; his failure to exercise reasonable care led to his strict liability.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. The scientist was not engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity; the act of transporting highly flammable chemicals inherently posed risks.
- **Option E:** Incorrect. The scientist did exercise reasonable care in handling the dangerous chemicals.
- **Option F:** Incorrect. The accident was not avoidable because the scientist lost control and was negligent.
- **Option G:** Incorrect. The scientist was not using a safer method; he was negligent in his driving.
- **Option H:** Correct. The scientist was negligent in his driving and handling the dangerous chemicals, making him strictly liable.
- **Option I:** Incorrect. The accident was not caused by the scientist's negligence.
- **Option J:** Incorrect. The doctor assumed the risk by acting as a Good Samaritan, which does not negate strict liability.

### Conclusion:
The scientist was negligent in his actions, which made him strictly liable. The doctor's claim against the scientist would prevail based on strict liability.
