Question:

A 32-year-old man and his 29-year-old wife come to the office for evaluation for infertility. The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis. Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility?

Options:

A: Serum cortisol concentration
B: Serum parathyroid hormone concentration
C: Prostate-specific antigen test
D: Semen fructose concentration
E: Thyroid function test
F: Serum prolactin concentration
G: Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations
H: Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations
I: Adrenal function test
J: Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this infertility question. Let's break it down. The patient is a 32-year-old man and his wife, both evaluating for infertility. The wife's医生 has done some tests and found nothing abnormal, so the issue must be her male factors. The husband is 188 cm, 6'3, got fair skin, little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm on semen analysis.

Hmm, what causes infertility in males? I remember that the primary cause is typically menopause, but that's when they stop having eggs. But the question is about underlying causes, not just menopause. Also, in some cases, other factors can lead to infertility.

The options given are various blood tests. Let's think about each:

A: Serum cortisol. I'm not sure. Cortisol is more about stress and can affect sexual function. Maybe, but not the main cause of male infertility.

B: Parathyroid. Parathyroid issues affect bone and may not directly relate to male fertility, unless the bone density is an issue.

C: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Wait, the husband has testicles, but does he have a testicular tumor? Because PSA is high when there's a palpable testium. But if the testes are normal, maybe it's not relevant. But the question says "potential male factors," which might mean other factors besides the testes.

D: Semen fructose. Fructose is a protein in semen, but I don't know what that does. Maybe it's a marker for prostate issues, but that's not directly related to male infertility except if it's prostate cancer.

E: Thyroid function. I'm not sure. Thyroid issues can affect body function but not directly male fertility.

F: Prolactin. It's a hormone, but again, not directly related to male fertility. Menstruation is related to hormones, not necessarily the cause of fertility.

G: Serum levels of fibroblast-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH and LH are involved in the menstrual cycle and may affect reproductive hormones, but I'm not sure how that's the underlying cause of infertility.

H: Estrogen and testosterone. These are the main hormones affecting male fertility. If either is low, it can cause infertility. But wait, the patient has testicular function, so the primary issue might be that the testes are not working correctly, not the hormones.

I: Adrenal function test. Adrenaline can affect sexual function, but again, not the main cause. Also, the test is for the adrenal glands, which are not directly involved in male fertility issues except possibly in certain cases like stress.

J: Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes. That's about the cell type in the blood, so probably not relevant.

So, the options left are C and H. The patient's testicular function is normal, but if the testes are not producing enough testosterone or estrogen, that could cause male infertility.

Wait, but the question is about the underlying cause. If the testes are functional, then other factors like the testicular muscles or the overall testicular health. But the options given include H, which is E and T levels.

Wait, the options C and H are about the levels. But the question is about the underlying cause. High levels of estrogen and testosterone could lead to issues, but that's more about symptoms than the actual cause.

Another angle: the men's testes aren't producing enough sperm. But the question is about the underlying cause, so it's about the cause, not the symptoms. So if the testes are producing the right amount, but perhaps the testes are not functioning well, but that's not directly measurable in these blood tests.

Wait, the options given include C (PSA), but the patient's testes are small and firm, which might suggest they're functional. However, why would he have no sperm? Maybe the testes are working but not producing enough sperm, but that's not directly detected by the given options.

Looking back, the question is about the underlying cause. The primary causes are often related to hormonal imbalances or other testicular issues. Since the testes are present and functional, the main issue could be that the testes are not producing enough testosterone, which is a hormone that affects male fertility. So if the testes are working but not producing enough, but that's a hormone issue.

Wait, but the options given are E and H (Estrogen and Testosterone). Option H is E and T. So H is about the hormone levels, which could indicate a problem. But the question is about the underlying cause, which is more likely to be something else.

Wait, perhaps the underlying issue is that the testes are not functioning properly, which is not directly detected by the given options, but the options include H which is the combination of E and T.

Alternatively, the underlying cause could be the men's gynecomastia, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, the use of other hormones or factors.

Wait, another thought: if the testes are functional, but their function is impaired, maybe it's the lack of testosterone. So if the testes are working but not producing enough testosterone, the testes might be healthy, but their function is compromised.

But the options available are E and H. Wait, the question is about the underlying cause, and the options include E, F, G, H, I, J.

Another angle: if the couple's testes are normal, but their fertility is low, maybe it's not the testes themselves but other factors. Wait, but the options don't include any other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the testes are not producing enough testes (protrude), but that's not a test result. The options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's something like the testes are not producing enough sperm, but that's not directly measurable in these options.

Wait, another thought: the question says the wife's evaluation showed no abnormalities, so the testes are fine. So the underlying cause must be more about the male factors, not the testes.

So among the options, C is PSA, which is a test for prostate cancer. D is Fructose, which is a protein in semen. F is prolactin, which is about hormones. H is E and T.

So the men's testes are working, but maybe their function is impaired, which is related to the hormones. If the testes are working but not producing enough testosterone, then their function is compromised, leading to infertility.

So the underlying cause would be the lack of testosterone. So the test would look at E and H. Wait, the options have H: Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations. So perhaps the test is looking for either E or H.

Wait, but why would the test look for both? Maybe it's E and H together. So if both are low, that's a problem.

So the most likely underlying cause is that the testes are producing the wrong amount of E and T, which is indicated by the test. So the correct answer would be H: Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations.

Therefore, the answer is H.

The question involves a 32-year-old man and his 29-year-old wife evaluating for infertility, with the wife's gynecologist indicating no abnormalities and needing further evaluation. The husband is 188 cm (6'3 in) with fair skin and little facial hair, and he has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm is detected in semen analysis. The task is to determine the most likely test to establish the underlying cause of infertility.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **A: Serum cortisol concentration**  
   Cortisol affects sexual function but is not the primary cause of male infertility.

2. **B: Serum parathyroid hormone concentration**  
   Parathyroid issues are unrelated to male fertility and are not relevant here.

3. **C: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test**  
   PSA is used to detect testicular cancer, not the primary cause of male infertility.

4. **D: Semen fructose concentration**  
   Fructose is a protein in semen, not directly related to male fertility or the cause of infertility.

5. **E: Thyroid function test**  
   Thyroid issues affect body function but are not relevant to male fertility.

6. **F: Serum prolactin concentration**  
   Prolactin is a hormone involved in the menstrual cycle but does not directly cause male infertility.

7. **G: Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations**  
   These hormones regulate hormonal balance but are not the primary cause of male infertility.

8. **H: Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations**  
   Estrogen and testosterone are the primary hormones affecting male fertility. If these levels are low, it could lead to infertility, particularly if the testes are functional but not producing enough E and T.

9. **I: Adrenal function test**  
   Adrenaline affects sexual function but is not the primary cause of male infertility.

10. **J: Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes**  
    This assesses cell type, not relevant to male fertility.

### Conclusion:
The underlying cause of infertility is likely due to insufficient estrogen and testosterone levels, which are indicated by the test for these hormones. The correct answer is **H: Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations**, as it directly assesses the primary factors affecting male fertility.

**ANSWER: H**
