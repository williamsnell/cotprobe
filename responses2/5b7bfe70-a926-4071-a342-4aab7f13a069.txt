Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Mercury's orbit around the Sun. Hmm, let me think. I need to find out how long it takes Mercury to orbit the Sun using Newton's version of Kepler's third law. Right, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period of a planet to its average distance from the Sun. Oh wait, Kepler's laws are usually expressed for planets orbiting the Sun, but I think the version for any orbit uses the semi-major axis and the period.

Newton's version of Kepler's third law should be the one that uses the gravitational constant G and the masses involved. The formula, I think, is T² = (4π² * a³) / (G * M), where T is the orbital period, a is the semi-major axis, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the Sun.

So, let's note down the given data. The mean orbital radius is 5.8e10 m. Oh wait, wait! Wait, the radius is the semi-major axis, right? Because for circular orbits, the radius and semi-major axis are the same. So a is 5.8e10 meters.

The mass of the Sun is 1.99e30 kg. Got it.

I need to find T in Earth days. So the steps are: use the formula, calculate T in seconds, then convert to days.

Wait, but let me get the formula right. The formula I think is T² = (4π² a³) / (G M). So that's the formula I'll use.

Let me plug in the numbers. G is 6.674e-11 N(m/kg)^2. M is 1.99e30 kg.

So a = 5.8e10 m. Let's plug everything into the equation.

But wait, let me compute a³ first. a is 5.8e10, so a³ is (5.8)^3 * (1e10)^3.

5.8 cubed is... 5^3 is 125, 0.8^3 is 0.512. But wait, wait, better to calculate 5.8 *5.8 = 33.64, then *5.8 again. Let's see: 33.64 * 5.8. Hmm, 33 *5 is 165, 33 *0.8 is 26.4, 0.64 *5 is 3.2, 0.64 *0.8 is 0.512. Wait, maybe a better way: 5.8 *5.8 is 33.64, times 5.8: 33.64 *5 is 168.2, 33.64 *0.8 is 26.912. Adding them gives 195.112. So a³ is approximately 195.112e30 m³. But wait, wait, no, a is 5.8e10, so a³ is (5.8)^3 * (1e10)^3 = 195.112 * 1e30 m³. Wait, 1e10 cubed is 1e30.

So a³ = (5.8)^3 * 1e30 = 195.112e30 m³.

Wait, maybe I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute 5.8 *5.8:

5.8 *5.8 = (5 + 0.8)(5 + 0.8) = 25 + 8 + 0.64 = 33.64. Oh yeah.

So 5.8^3 is 5.8 * 33.64. Let me compute that: 5 *33.64 is 168.2, 0.8 *33.64 is 26.912. Sum is 195.112. So a³ = (195.112) * (1e10)^3 = 195.112e30 m³.

Wait, no, wait a is 5.8e10, so a^3 is (5.8e10)^3 = (5.8)^3 * (1e10)^3 = 195.112 * 1e30 = 1.95112e32 m³.

Now, G is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

So, 4 π² a³ is 4 * π² * 1.95112e32.

π² is approximately 9.8696. So 4 * 9.8696 is about 39.4784.

Multiply that by 1.95112e32: 39.4784 * 1.95112e32 = let's compute 39.4784 *1.95112 first.

Hmm, 39 * 1.95 is about 76.05. 0.4784 *1.95 is about 0.936. So total is approximately 76.986e32. Wait, I think I should compute it more precisely.

No, let me calculate 39.4784 * 1.95112.

Let me break it down:

1.95112 * 39 = let's see:

39 *1 is 39.

39 *0.95112 is:

0.95112 *39 = 37.096.

Sum 39 +37.096 = 76.096.

Then, 0.4784 *1.95112 ≈ 0.4784 *1.95 ≈ 0.936.

So total is 76.096 + 0.936 ≈ 77.032.

So 39.4784 *1.95112e32 =77.032e32 m³/s².

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach. Alternatively, let me compute 39.4784 * 1.95112.

Multiply 39.4784 by 1.95112:

Compute 39.4784 * 1.95 = ?

39.4784 *1 =39.4784.

39.4784 *0.95 = 39.4784 * (0.9 +0.05) = 35.53056 + 1.97392 = 37.50448.

So 39.4784 *1.95 =39.4784 +37.50448=76.98288.

Now, 39.4784 *0.00112= let's see: 0.00112 *39.4784.

0.001 *39.4784=0.0394784, and 0.00012 *39.4784≈0.004737408. Sum: 0.0394784 +0.004737408≈0.0442158.

So 39.4784 *1.95112 =76.98288 +0.0442158≈77.027.

So 39.4784 *1.95112e32 =77.027e32 m³/s².

Now, the numerator is 4π² a³ =77.027e32 m³/s².

The denominator is G*M: 6.674e-11 *1.99e30.

Compute 6.674 *1.99 ≈13.276. And 1e-11 *1e30=1e19.

So 6.674e-11 *1.99e30 = approx 13.276e19 = 1.3276e20 m³/s².

Wait, let me compute that accurately. 6.674e-11 * 1.99e30.

6.674 *1.99 = let's compute 6 *2 =12, but with the exact numbers:

6.674 *1.99 = 6.674*(2 -0.01) = 6.674*2 - 6.674*0.01 = 13.348 - 0.06674 =13.28126.

So 13.28126e(-11 +30) =13.28126e19 =1.328126e20 m³/s².

So now, T² = (4π² a³) / (G M) =77.027e32 /1.328126e20.

Divide 77.027e32 by 1.328126e20.

That equals (77.027 /1.328126) * (1e32 /1e20) )= (57.77) * 1e12.

Wait, 77.027 divided by 1.328126: Let's compute that.

1.328126 *57 = let's see: 57 *1.328126=57 *1=57, 57 *0.328126.

Wait, 0.328126 *57= (0.3 *57=17.1; 0.028126 *57=1.603). So 17.1 +1.603=18.703.

So 57 *1.328126≈57 +18.703=75.703. But our numerator is 77.027. So 77.027-75.703=1.324. So 1.324 /1.328126≈0.9977. So approximately 57.9977.

So approximately 57.9977e12 s².

So T squared is about 57.9977e12 s². So T is sqrt(57.9977e12) seconds.

Wait, sqrt(57.9977) is about sqrt(56.25) is 7.5. 57.9977 is a bit more, so maybe 7.615 or something.

Because 7.6^2=57.76, 7.61^2=57.9121, 7.615^2= approx (7.61)^2=57.9121. Let me compute 7.615^2: (7.61 +0.005)^2=7.61^2 + 2*7.61*0.005 + 0.005^2=57.9121 + 0.0761 + 0.000025=57.988225. Hmm, but our value is 57.9977, which is higher.

So perhaps 7.615^2 is 57.988, 7.62^2 is 7.62*7.62= let's compute 7.6^2=57.76, plus 0.02*7.6*2 (because (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², but wait, 7.62 is 7.6 +0.02. So (7.6 +0.02)^2=7.6^2 +2*7.6 *0.02 +0.02^2 =57.76 +0.304 +0.0004=58.0644.

Wait, my target is 57.9977. So 7.615^2 is 57.988, 7.62^2 is 58.0644. So 57.9977 is between them. Let me compute 7.615 + x. Let's think, 57.988 is 7.615^2, 57.9977 is 57.988 + 0.0097. So how much x would get us from 7.615 to 7.615 +x, where (7.615 +x)^2 ≈ 57.988 + 2*7.615 x + x². Since x is small, x² is negligible.

So 2 *7.615 *x ≈0.0097.

2 *7.615=15.23.

x≈0.0097 /15.23 ≈0.000636.

So x≈0.000636. So 7.615 +0.000636=7.615636.

So sqrt(57.9977e12) ≈7.615636e6 seconds.

Now, convert this into days. Because 1 day is 86400 seconds.

So 7.615636e6 s = 7.615636e6 /86400 days.

Let me compute 7.615636e6 /86400.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1e3: 7615.636 / 86.4.

Compute 86.4 * 88 = let's see 80*86.4=6912, 8*86.4=691.2. So 6912+691.2=7603.2. So 86.4 *88=7603.2. But our numerator is 7615.636. So 7615.636 -7603.2=12.436.

So 12.436 /86.4 = approx 0.1435.

So total is 88.1435 days.

So T≈88.14 days.

Looking at the options, option H is 88.3, which is close. Option E is 70.2, which is much shorter. So the correct answer is H:88.3 days.

To determine how long it takes Mercury to orbit the Sun, we use Newton's version of Kepler's third law:

\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G M}
\]

### Given Data:
- Mean orbital radius of Mercury: \( a = 5.8 \times 10^{10} \, \text{m} \)
- Mass of the Sun: \( M = 1.99 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)
- Gravitational constant: \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)

### Step 1: Compute \( a^3 \)
\[
a^3 = (5.8 \times 10^{10})^3 = 5.8^3 \times (10^{10})^3 = 195.112 \times 10^{30} = 1.95112 \times 10^{32} \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( 4\pi^2 a^3 \)
\[
4\pi^2 \approx 39.4784
\]
\[
4\pi^2 a^3 = 39.4784 \times 1.95112 \times 10^{32} \approx 77.027 \times 10^{32} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( G M \)
\[
G M = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \times (1.99 \times 10^{30}) \approx 13.281 \times 10^{19} = 1.3281 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( T^2 \)
\[
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G M} = \frac{77.027 \times 10^{32}}{1.3281 \times 10^{20}} \approx 57.9977 \times 10^{12} \, \text{s}^2
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( T \)
\[
T = \sqrt{57.9977 \times 10^{12}} \approx 7.6157 \times 10^6 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 6: Convert \( T \) to days
\[
1 \, \text{day} = 86400 \, \text{s}, \quad T = \frac{7.6157 \times 10^6}{86400} \approx 88.14 \, \text{days}
\]

### Final Answer:
The orbital period of Mercury is approximately **88.3 days**, which corresponds to **option H**.
