Okay, I need to differentiate between tariffs and quotas as barriers to free trade. Let me think about the definitions.

Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. So, when a country imposes a tariff, it's like adding a cost to the buyer. So, for example, if I buy a product from another country, I have to pay a higher price, which is the tariff.

Quotas are different. They set a maximum amount of a good that can be imported. So, if there's a quota on apples, you can't buy more than a certain number of apples in a year. It's like a limit on the quantity.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Both set a max on imports. No, because tariffs affect exports, not imports. Quotas limit imports, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Tariffs are fees on exports, quotas subsidies for imports. Wait, no. Quotas are on imports, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Tariffs limit quantity, quotas taxes on imports. No, quotas are about quantity, not taxes. So C is wrong.

Option D: Quotas are taxes on goods, tariffs tax quantity. No, tariffs are on imports, quotas on quantity. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Tariffs are trade agreements, quotas are unilateral restrictions. I think that's a general statement, but not specific. Tariffs are more about the cost, while quotas just restrict the quantity. So E is a bit too broad.

Option F: Quotas require producers to limit, tariffs standardize prices. No, tariffs are about quantity limits, not price. Quotas don't require producers to reduce production; they just restrict the amount. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Quotas are fixed fees, tariffs percentage-based. Wait, quotas are often set by imposing a quantity limit, but I'm not sure if they are fixed. Tariffs are tax rates, so G might be mixing things up. Maybe G is incorrect.

Option H: Tariffs ban goods, quotas require licenses. No, that's more about regulation. Tariffs are specific taxes, while quotas are volume limits. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Tariffs are revenue and industry protection. Yes, that's correct. Tariffs help collect revenue and protect domestic industries. Quotas limit imports, so I think I is correct. But wait, option I is about the types: I think I is correct because it's about the purpose.

Option J: Quotas increase prices, tariffs restrict goods. No, tariffs don't increase prices; they're tax on imports, so they just add to the cost. Quotas don't affect prices, they limit imports. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be I. Let me double-check. Quotas are limits on imports, so option I says they set a maximum on imports. Quotas are about quantity limits, not costs. So the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is I, which accurately differentiates quotas from tariffs. Quotas set a maximum quantity of imports, while tariffs impose specific costs on imported goods. 

Answer: I
