Okay, so I've got this question about the codon for phenylalanine. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my genetics, but let's think through this. 

The question is asking how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered. The options are A through J, each with a different triplet and a statement. I remember that codons are triplets of bases, and each triplet codes for an amino acid. 

Phenylalanine is one of the standard amino acids, right? I recall that the codon for phenylalanine is UAA. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to reconstruct the process.

I think the codons were first discovered through genetic experiments, like in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Maybe it was during the study of proteins and their building blocks. The idea was that certain triplets of bases would code for specific amino acids.

So, looking at the options, option B says GGA was identified as the codon for phenylalanine. Wait, isn't that GGA coding for leucine, not phenylalanine? Because I remember that codons like GGA are for leucine. So option B might be incorrect.

Option E is GGG which codes for phenylalanine. No, I don't think so. I think GGG is actually related to tyrosine. Wait, tyrosine's codon is GGG. Oh right, I'm getting confused. So option E is incorrect.

Option D says UUU codes for phenylalanine. No, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. UUU is asparagine. Oh wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall: asparagine is UUU, phenylalanine is UAA. So option D is wrong.

Option I says UUC was the first discovered. Hmm, I don't think UUC was first. I think UAA was discovered earlier. So I'm not sure about this. Maybe it's not I.

Option J says AAA codes for phenylalanine. No, that's the start codon for mRNA, which codes for methionine. So J is wrong.

Option F: UUA was thought to code for phenylalanine before further research clarified it was serine. Wait, I thought that UUA is actually for serine. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let's double-check. Phenylalanine's triplet is UAA, so F says UUA was thought for phenyl, but no, maybe F is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps F is correct? Let me think again. If the user is saying that UUA was incorrectly thought to code for phenylalanine. I thought UUA was serine, so maybe F is correct. But I'm not certain.

Option H says AGU was found to code for serine, but was initially believed to code for phenylalanine. Hmm, that sounds right. Because I remember that AGU is serine. So H is correct.

Wait, so the question is about the codon being discovered. So which option is correct? The question is asking about the codon, so options where the correct triplet is stated.

Wait, another angle: phenylalanine's codon is UAA. So looking at the options:

Option H says AGU was found to code for serine. So H is correct. Because AGU is serine, which is option H.

Wait, but I thought H is correct because AGU codes for serine. But the question is about phenylalanine. So perhaps the question is about the correct triplet, which is UAA.

Looking at the options, option J says AAA is phenylalanine. No, because AAA is methionine. So J is incorrect.

Option D is UUU for asparagine, which is incorrect.

Option B is GGA for phenylalanine. No, I think GGA is leucine.

So, if the correct codon for phenylalanine is UAA, then which option has that? Let me check.

Looking at the options again:

Option J: The codon AAA codes for phenylalanine. No, that's methionine.

Option H: The codon AGU was found to code for serine, but was initially believed to code for phenylalanine. So H is correct, but about serine. So the question is about phenylalanine.

Wait, the options are about the codon for phenylalanine. So which option correctly states the triplet for that amino acid.

Wait, the options are:

A: AUG codes for phenylalanine. No, I think that's methionine.

B: GGA is for phenylalanine. No, GGA is leucine.

C: CCC is for phenylalanine. No, that's tyrosine.

D: UUU is asparagine, so no.

E: GGG is phenylalanine? No, I think GGG is tyrosine.

F: UUA was thought to be phenylalanine. No, UUA is serine.

G: AAG is phenylalanine. No, AAG is phenylalanine? Wait, no, I think AAG is phenylalanine. So G says AAG is phenyl, which would be correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again:

Phenylalanine's triplet is UAA. So the correct triplet is UAA.

Looking at the options:

Option J: AAA is phenyl. No, that's methionine.

Option G: AAG is phenyl. So AAG's triplet is phenylalanine. So option G would be correct if it said AAG codes for phenylalanine.

Wait, but the options are:

G: The codon AAG signals for the addition of phenylalanine to the polypeptide chain. So, the triplet AAG is for phenylalanine? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, AAG is phenylalanine. So option G says that. So if the codon AAG is for phenylalanine, then option G is correct.

But wait, I thought that AAG is coded by the start codon for methionine. No, the start codon is AAA. So AAG is phenylalanine. So G says the codon AAG is for phenylalanine, which is correct. So G is correct.

But wait, the options are asking how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered. So, which option is correct.

So, looking:

Option H says AGU was found to code for serine, but was initially believed to code for phenylalanine. So that's correct.

Option G says AAG is for phenylalanine. That's correct.

So the options are:

Option H is about AGU being serine, correct.

Option G is about AAG being phenylalanine. That's correct.

Now, the question is about the discovery of the codon. So, what was the actual discovery.

In the early 20th century, geneticists were trying to find the codon for phenylalanine. I think early experiments identified some of the codons.

Looking for which option is correct.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the codon for phenylalanine is UAA. So, which option reflects that.

Option J: AAA is for phenylalanine? No.

Option H: AGU was found to code for serine, which is correct. So H's first part is correct.

So, the correct statement would be that AGU was found to code for serine, but was thought to code for phenylalanine.

So option H is correct.

But then another angle: do any of the other options correctly describe a codon for phenylalanine.

Option J says AAA is phenyl. No, that's methionine.

Option G says AAG is phenyl. Yes, that's correct.

So, the options available are:

H and G are correct statements about codons.

But the question is asking which is the correct explanation of how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered.

Wait, the question is, "Explain how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered." So, which option is correct about the codon.

Looking at the options, both H and G seem correct, but perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The correct triplet is UAA.

So, the correct codon is UAA.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So perhaps the correct statement is option H, which correctly describes the AGU being serine.

Wait, but the question is about the codon for phenylalanine, which is UAA.

So, which of these is correct.

Wait, option H is correct, because it's about AGU being serine, correct.

But the question is about the codon for phenylalanine.

So, the correct triplet is uaa, but none of the options directly state that.

Wait, but perhaps one of the options is correct in another way.

Looking again, option G says AAG is phenyl. Is that correct? Yes, I think so. AAG codes for phenylalanine.

So option G correctly states that. So, the correct answer would be option G.

Wait, but the question is how the codon was discovered.

So, perhaps the correct answer is G, because it correctly states that AAG is phenyl.

Wait, the options are about the triplet. So the correct triplet is UAA, but none of the options state that. So, perhaps the question is about the triplet.

So, looking at the options, the correct triplet is UAA. So, if any option correctly states UAA as the codon for phenylalanine, that would be the answer.

Looking at the options:

Option J: AAA for phenyl. No.

Option H: AGU for serine. Correct.

Option G: AAG for phenyl. Correct.

But the question is about the codon for phenyl, so either G or H is correct.

Wait, which is the correct statement about the codon.

Wait, perhaps the correct triplet is UAA, but I don't see any option stating that. So perhaps the confusion is in the options.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking at the options, the correct triplet for phenylalanine is UAA. So, which option correctly states that.

Looking again:

Option G: The codon AAG signals for the addition of phenylalanine to the polypeptide chain. So, AAG is for phenylalanine. So that's correct.

Option H: The codon AGU was found to code for serine, but was initially believed to code for phenylalanine. So that's correct.

So, both H and G are correct in their statements.

But the question is about the discovery of the codon. So, the correct triplet is UAA, but none of the options state that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is H, because it correctly describes one of the codons for serine (AGU) and points out that phenylalanine is another.

Wait, the question says "the codon for phenylalanine was discovered".

So, the correct triplet is UAA, but perhaps in the options, only H and G are correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H because it's about the serine codon, which is a correct statement, but the question is about phenylalanine.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H because it's about serine, which is a correct statement.

Wait, but the question is about phenylalanine.

So, perhaps the correct option is H, but why would that be the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct triplet is UAA, but there's no option that says that. So, the closest is option G, which says AAG is for phenyl.

Wait, but in reality, AAG is for phenylalanine. So, option G is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the discovery. So, perhaps the correct option is G.

Alternatively, perhaps option H is correct because it's about the serine codon, which is correct.

Wait, the question is about the codon for phenylalanine.

So, the options are:

H: AGU was found to code for serine. Correct.

G: AAG is for phenyl. Correct.

So, both H and G are correct.

But the question is asking which option explains the codon for phenylalanine.

Wait, perhaps one of them is correct, but the other is incorrect.

Wait, looking back:

Option H: The codon AGU was found to code for serine, but was initially believed to code for phenylalanine.

Yes, that's definitely correct. AGU is serine. So H is correct.

But the question is about phenylalanine.

So, the correct option is H, but that's about serine.

Wait, but the question is about phenylalanine's codon. So, the correct statement is that AAG is for phenyl.

So, option G is correct.

But the options are:

G: The codon AAG signals for the addition of phenylalanine to the polypeptide chain.

So, AAG is phenyl. So, yes, G is correct.

But then, the question is about the codon for phenyl, so which option is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A: The codon AUG codes for phenylalanine. No, because that's methionine.

B: GGA is for phenyl. No, that's leucine.

C: CCC is for tyrosine.

D: UUU is asparagine. No, that's UUU is asparagine.

E: GGG is phenyl. No, GGG is tyrosine.

F: UUA was thought for phenyl. No, UUA is serine.

G: AAG is phenyl. Yes.

H: AGU was found to code for serine, but was initially believed to code for phenyl.

So, between options G and H, which one is correct.

But the question is about the codon for phenyl. So, option G correctly states that AAG is phenyl. So G is correct.

But wait, the options are about the codon for phenyl, not the triplet for serine.

So, the right answer is G, because AAG is indeed the codon for phenylalanine.
</think>

The question asks how the codon for phenylalanine was discovered. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The codon **AUG** codes for methionine, not phenylalanine.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The triplet **GGA** codes for leucine, not phenylalanine.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The triplet **CCC** codes for tyrosine, not phenylalanine.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The triplet **UUU** codes for asparagine, not phenylalanine.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The triplet **GGG** codes for tyrosine, not phenylalanine.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The triplet **UUA** codes for serine, not phenylalanine.
- **Option G**: Correct. The triplet **AAG** is indeed the codon for phenylalanine.
- **Option H**: Correct. The triplet **AGU** was initially thought to code for phenylalanine but was later discovered to code for serine.

The question specifically asks about the codon for phenylalanine, and **Option G** correctly states that **AAG** signals for phenylalanine. While **Option H** is also correct and provides additional context about serine, the question is focused on phenylalanine, making **Option G** the best choice.
