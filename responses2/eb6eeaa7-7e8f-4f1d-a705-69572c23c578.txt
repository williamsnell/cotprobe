Question:

A college freshman obtains a score of 150 on his English final exam, a score of 100 on his math exam, a score of 55 on his chemistry exam, and a score of 30 on his history exam. The means and standard deviations for these tests are, respectively, 125 and 20 for the English exam, 90 and 10 for the math exam, 45 and 5 for the chemistry exam, and 30 and 5 for the history exam. Based on this information, you can conclude that the young man's test performance was best on which exam?

Options:

A: Math and History
B: math
C: Chemistry and History
D: English and Math
E: All of the above
F: history
G: English
H: chemistry
I: English and History
J: None of the above

Okay, so I've got this question about a college freshman's exam scores and I need to figure out which exam he performed best on. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when comparing performance across different exams, it's not just about the raw scores because the exams might have different scales. So I think I need to calculate something called a z-score for each subject. 

Wait, what's a z-score again? Oh right, it shows how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean. A higher z-score means better relative performance. The formula for z-score is (score - mean)/standard deviation. 

Alright, let's list out the scores and means/standard deviations for each exam:

- **English**: Score = 150, Mean = 125, SD =20
- **Math**: Score = 100, Mean =90, SD=10
- **Chemistry**: Score=55, Mean=45, SD=5
- **History**: Score=30, Mean=30, SD=5

Let's calculate z-scores for each.

**English:**
(150 - 125)/20 = 25/20 = 1.25
So z=1.25

**Math:**
(100-90)/10=10/10=1.0
z=1.0

**Chemistry:**
(55-45)/5=10/5=2.0
z=2.0

**History:**
(30-30)/5=0/5=0.0
z=0.0

Wait a second, the z-scores: English 1.25, Math 1.0, Chemistry 2.0, History 0.

So the highest z-score is 2.0 in Chemistry. That means he performed the best in Chemistry relative to the other exams. Wait, but the question says "test performance was best on which exam?" So the answer should be the exam with the highest z-score, which is Chemistry. But wait, the options don't have 'Chemistry' as the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option H is 'Chemistry', and the choices are: A: Math and History, B: math, C: Chemistry and History, D: English and Math, E: All of the above, F: history, G: English, I: English and History, J: None of the above.

Wait, so according to the z-scores, he performed best in Chemistry, which is option H. But the options don't include that as the correct choice. Let me re-examine the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check each z-score.

English: 150-125=25, 25/20=1.25. Correct.

Math: 100-90=10, 10/10=1.0. Correct.

Chemistry:55-45=10, 10/5=2.0. Correct.

History:30-30=0, 0/5=0. Correct.

So yes, the highest is Chemistry with 2.0. So why isn't that the correct answer? Oh wait, wait. Let me reread the question.

The question says: "Based on this information, you can conclude that the young man's test performance was best on which exam?"

The options are: J says 'None of the above'. So, the correct option is 'Chemistry' which isn't listed as option H because the options are A: Math and History, etc., but I'm confused because H is 'Chemistry'. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the interpretation. Wait, the options are:

A: Math and History. So the highest is Chemistry, so that's not among the options. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Math and History

B: math

C: Chemistry and History

D: English and Math

E: All of the above

F: history

G: English

H: chemistry

I: English and History

J: None of the above

Wait, so the correct conclusion is that he performed best in Chemistry. But none of the options (A-F) mention 'Chemistry' as the best. So the correct answer is H, but it's not in the options. But the options don't have 'H', only up to J.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I compute the z-scores correctly? Or is there another way to interpret the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking which exam's performance is the best relative to the mean and standard deviation. The exam with the highest z-score is the best. So the highest is chemistry, which is option H.

But the given options don't include H as an option. Wait, looking back: the options are A to J, and H is the 7th option. Oh, no, the options are A to J. Let me look: the options are:

A: Math and History

B: math

C: Chemistry and History

D: English and Math

E: All of the above

F: history

G: English

H: chemistry

I: English and History

J: None of the above

Wait, so the correct exam is Chemistry, which is option H. But the options don't have H as an available choice. So the correct conclusion is that he performed best in Chemistry, which isn't among the options. So the answer should be J: None of the above.

Wait, but wait. Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check all the calculations.

Wait, no, because the z-scores are correct. So the conclusion is he did best in Chemistry, which isn't an option, so the correct answer is J: None of the above. So the answer is J. But wait, the options provided are options A to J, with 'H' being chemistry. So in the options, H is the correct choice, but it's not presentâ€”so the answer should be J, meaning none of the above.

Wait, but the options don't include 'H' as a correct answer. So the correct answer is J: None of the above.
</think>

The freshman's test performance was best on the exam with the highest z-score, which is chemistry (z = 2.0). However, none of the provided options (A to H) include "Chemistry" as the correct choice. Therefore, the correct answer is J: None of the above.

Answer: J
