Okay, let's try to figure out this DNA question. So, the problem says there's a DNA molecule with 180 base pairs and 20% adenine. They want to know how many cytosine nucleotides are present. Hmm, right, DNA is made up of four nucleotides: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).

Wait, but each base pair is made up of two bases. So, 180 base pairs mean there are 180 nucleotides, right? Because each is a pair. So, total nucleotides = 180.

Now, 20% of the adenine. That means adenine is 20% of the bases. But wait, each adenine is paired with a thymine, so the number of adenine and thymine together is 20% of the total. Wait, but wait, no. The total number of base pairs is 180. So each base pair has one adenine and one thymine, or one cytosine and one guanine.

Wait, but the question is about cytosine. So, perhaps I should think in terms of the total composition.

Let me think: each DNA molecule has equal numbers of A and T (because A pairs with T), and equal numbers of C and G (C pairs with G). So, the total number of A's is the same as T's, and C's equal G's.

So, if the number of A is 20% of the total base pairs, then the number of T is also 20%. So, A and T account for 40% each. Then, the remaining 60% must be accounted for by C and G, which are equal. So each of C and G is 30% of the total.

Wait, so the total is 180 nucleotides. So, 30% of 180 is 54, and 30% again is another 54 for C and G. So, each of C and G is 54.

But wait, the question is about the number of cytosine nucleotides. So, each C is a separate nucleotide. So, for each C in the molecule, there's a G. So, the number of C's would be 54.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. So, total base pairs is 180. Each base pair is two bases. So, 180 base pairs mean 180 x 2 = 360 nucleotides. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because a DNA molecule is made of two strands, each with a certain number of base pairs. But in terms of the entire molecule, each base pair is one pair of two bases. So, 180 base pairs mean that there are 180 nucleotides. Because each pair is two bases, but a pair is a single unit. So, the total number of nucleotides is the same as the number of base pairs. So, 180 nucleotides.

Ah, okay, so that part was right. Then, 20% of 180 is 36 adenine. So, A = 36. Since A pairs with T, T is also 36. So, A and T together are 72, which is 20% of 360? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the given is 20% adenine. Since each adenine is paired with thymine, the number of adenine is 20% of the total number of base pairs. So, 0.20 * 180 = 36 adenine. So, A = 36. Then, T is also 36. So, A + T = 72.

The rest of the 180 - 72 = 108 nucleotides are made up of C and G. Since C and G are equal in number, each is 54. So, C = 54. So, cytosine nucleotides are 54.

Wait, but let me look at the options. The options are A to J. The options are:

A: 108
B:120
C:150
D:144
E:60
F:30
G:36
H:72
I:180
J:90

Hmm, so 54 isn't listed. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me approach this differently.

Each DNA molecule has a certain number of A, T, C, G. But the way the question is phrased: it's a molecule of DNA, 180 base pairs and 20% adenine.

Wait, perhaps the 180 is the number of base pairs, which is correct. So, each base pair is two bases. So, 180 base pairs would mean 180 x 2 = 360 nucleotides. Oh! Wait, wait. I think I was wrong earlier. Because each base pair is two bases. So, if the molecule is 180 base pairs long, the total number of nucleotides is 180 * 2 = 360.

Wait, that changes everything! I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption. So, total nucleotides = 360.

So, the total is 360 nucleotides.

20% of the adenine is A. So, A = 0.20 * 360 = 72.

Since each A is paired with a T, T is also 72.

So, A + T = 144.

The remaining base pairs are 360 - 144 = 216. These are made of C and G. Since each C is paired with a G, their numbers are equal, so each is 216 / 2 = 108.

So, C = 108.

Wait, but wait. So, the question is how many cytosine nucleotides are present. Each C is a separate nucleotide. So, there are 108 C's.

Looking at the options, option A is 108. So the correct answer should be A: 108.

Wait, but wait again. Let me recheck that. Because the initial calculation after I made that mistake: 20% of 360 is 72, so A and T are each 72. So, 72 +72=144. The rest is 216, which is C and G, so 216 is 108 each. So, yes, cytosine is 108.

So, the correct answer is option A: 108.

To determine the number of cytosine nucleotides in the DNA molecule, we start by noting the following:

1. The DNA molecule has 180 base pairs, meaning there are **180 nucleotides** in total (since each base pair consists of two bases).
2. 20% of the base pairs are adenine (A). Therefore, the number of adenine nucleotides is calculated as:
   \[
   0.20 \times 180 = 36 \, \text{adenine}.
   \]
3. Since adenine (A) is paired with thymine (T), there are also 36 thymine nucleotides.
4. The total number of adenine and thymine nucleotides is:
   \[
   36 \, \text{adenine} + 36 \, \text{thymine} = 72 \, \text{nucleotides}.
   \]
5. The remaining base pairs are accounted for by cytosine (C) and guanine (G), which are paired together. The total number of base pairs remaining is:
   \[
   180 - 72 = 108 \, \text{base pairs}.
   \]
6. Since cytosine (C) is paired with guanine (G), the number of cytosine nucleotides is half of the remaining base pairs:
   \[
   \frac{108}{2} = 54 \, \text{cytosine}.
   \]

However, upon re-evaluating the initial assumption that the total number of nucleotides is equal to the number of base pairs (180), the correct total number of nucleotides is 360. This changes the calculations:

1. The total number of nucleotides is:
   \[
   180 \, \text{base pairs} \times 2 = 360 \, \text{nucleotides}.
   \]
2. 20% of the nucleotides are adenine:
   \[
   0.20 \times 360 = 72 \, \text{adenine}.
   \]
3. Thymine is also 72, so the total number of adenine and thymine nucleotides is:
   \[
   72 + 72 = 144 \, \text{nucleotides}.
   \]
4. The remaining nucleotides are accounted for by cytosine (C) and guanine (G):
   \[
   360 - 144 = 216 \, \text{nucleotides}.
   \]
5. Since cytosine (C) is paired with guanine (G), the number of cytosine nucleotides is:
   \[
   \frac{216}{2} = 108 \, \text{cytosine}.
   \]

Thus, the number of cytosine nucleotides is **108**.
