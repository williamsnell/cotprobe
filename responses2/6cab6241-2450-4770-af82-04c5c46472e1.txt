Okay, so I have this problem about Mr. Falbo and his factory. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The question gives a schedule of productivity. It shows the number of men hired and the corresponding Total Physical Product (TP) in tons per day. The numbers are as follows:

1 man: 15 tons
2 men: 25 tons
3 men: 33 tons
4 men: 38 tons
5 men: 42 tons

Wages are $50 per day, and output sells for $10 per ton. The task is to find out how many men Mr. Falbo should hire to maximize profits.

Hmm, profits are calculated as total revenue minus total costs. So I need to figure out the profit for each number of men and then choose the one that gives the maximum profit.

Let me break it down:

First, I should calculate the total revenue for each number of men. Revenue is the quantity produced multiplied by the price per ton. Since output sells for $10, each ton brings in $10.

Then, total costs are the wages, which are $50 per man. So for each number of men, the cost is 50 multiplied by the number of men.

Profit for each case would be (TP * $10) - (number_of_men * $50).

Let me compute this for each number of men.

Starting with 1 man:
TP = 15 tons
Revenue = 15 * $10 = $150
Cost = 1 * $50 = $50
Profit = $150 - $50 = $100

Next, 2 men:
TP = 25 tons
Revenue = 25 * 10 = $250
Cost = 2 * 50 = $100
Profit = 250 - 100 = $150

3 men:
TP = 33 tons
Revenue = 33 *10 = $330
Cost = 3*50 = $150
Profit = 330 - 150 = $180

4 men:
TP = 38 tons
Revenue = 38*10= $380
Cost =4*50= $200
Profit= 380-200= $180

5 men:
TP=42 tons
Revenue=42*10= $420
Cost=5*50= $250
Profit=420-250= $170

Wait a minute, wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So for each case, I have calculated profit correctly. Let me recheck.

For 1 man: 15*10=150. Cost is 50. 150-50=100. Correct.

2 men: 25*10=250. 250-100=150. Correct.

3 men:33*10=330. 330-150=180. Correct.

4 men:38*10=380. 380-200=180. Yes, same as 3 men.

5 men:42*10=420. 420-250=170. So profit is $170.

So profits are as follows:

1 man: $100

2: $150

3: $180

4: $180

5: $170

The highest profit is $180, achieved at both 3 men and 4 men. But wait, the question is to maximize profits. So which number of men should he hire?

Wait, but could I have made a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check each one.

Wait, for 3 men: 33 tons. 33 *10 is 330. Cost is 3*50=150. 330-150=180. Correct.

4 men:38 tons. 38*10=380. 4*50=200. 380-200=180. Correct.

So both 3 and 4 men give the same profit. But looking at the options, the choices are 3,2,5,4. So both 3 and 4 are options. But wait, the problem says "order to maximize profits." So which of these numbers is the correct choice?

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A:3, B:2, C:5, D:4.

So the maximum occurs at both 3 and 4. But which one is the correct choice? Because the question asks for how many men to hire, so perhaps there is a point where the marginal revenue product (MRP) equals the wage rate.

Wait, another approach: The rule for profit maximization is that the marginal revenue product (MRP) should equal the wage rate. MRP is the additional revenue from hiring one more worker. So MRP = d(TP/dn) * price.

Wait, but in this case, as each additional ton is sold for $10. So MRP is 10 * (d(TP)/dn). So for each additional man, the MRP is 10*(new TP - old TP).

Let me compute MRP for each number of men.

At 1 man: MRP is 10*(25-15) =10*10=100.

At 2 men:10*(33-25)=10*8=80.

At3:10*(38-33)=5*10=50? Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. MP is the additional output per worker.

Wait, for 1 man: output increases from 0 to 15, so MP is 15. So MRP is 15 * $10 = 150.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think.

Each additional man increases the total physical product. So the marginal product (MP) is the increase in TP when you hire one more man. Then, MRP is MP multiplied by the price per ton.

For example:

For 1 man: MP is 15, so MRP is 15 * $10 = $150.

2 men: MP is 25-15=10, so MRP=10*$10= $100.

3 men: MP=33-25=8, MRP=8*10=80.

4 men: MP=38-33=5, MRP=5*10=50.

5 men: MP=42-38=4, MRP=4*10=40.

Then, the MRP for each additional man is:

1st: $150

2nd: $100

3rd: $80

4th: $50

5th: $40

The wage rate is $50 per day. So, according to the rule, as long as the MRP of the next worker is greater than the wage rate, the firm should hire that worker. When MRP equals the wage rate, the firm should stop hiring. If MRP is less than the wage rate, it should not hire the additional worker.

So, for each number of men:

At 1 man: MRP is $150 > $50 → hire.

2 men: MRP is $100 > $50 → hire.

3 men: MRP is $80 > $50 → hire.

4 men: MRP is $50 = wage → can hire.

5 men: MRP is $40 < $50 → don't hire.

So, up to 4 men, each has MRP higher or equal to the wage, but at 5 men, it's lower. Therefore, the optimal number is 4 men.

But wait, according to the earlier calculation, profit was the same for 3 and 4 men. So why is the MRP equal at 4 men?

Wait, because MRP is the additional revenue from hiring the next worker. So when MRP equals wage, the firm is indifferent between hiring that worker or not. So in that case, whether to hire is a question of whether it's better to keep or not.

But in our case, the MRP at 4 is $50, which is exactly the wage. So the firm is indifferent. So whether Mr. Falbo would hire 4 or 5? The rule would say not to hire extra workers beyond the point where MRP <= wage. So in this case, since the MRP for the 4th worker is exactly the wage, he should hire 4.

Wait, but wait in the earlier profit calculation, both 3 and 4 gave the same profit. So why is MRP at 4 equal to the wage?

Because in that case, the marginal cost (wage) is 50, and the marginal revenue is 50. So the firm is indifferent between the two options.

So, the maximum profit is achieved at 4 men.

So looking back at options, the choices are A:3, B:2, C:5, D:4.

So the correct answer would be D:4.

But wait, earlier when I calculated profit for each number of men, 3 and 4 both gave $180. So, in that case, why is the MRP at 4 equal to the wage?

Ah, because when the MRP equals the wage, the firm is at the point where the next unit doesn't add any profit. So, whether to hire or not is a matter of the firm's preference. If the MRP equals the wage, the firm is indifferent and would choose to hire up to that point.

So in this case, since the MRP for the 4th worker is equal to the wage, Mr. Falbo can choose to hire 4 men to maximize his profit. So the correct option is D:4.
</think>

To determine how many men Mr. Falbo should hire to maximize profits, we analyze the productivity schedule, wage rate, and price per ton. The goal is to maximize profit, which is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. Here's the breakdown:

### Productivity Schedule:
- 1 man: 15 tons/day
- 2 men: 25 tons/day
- 3 men: 33 tons/day
- 4 men: 38 tons/day
- 5 men: 42 tons/day

### Prices:
- Output sells for $10 per ton.
- Wages: $50 per day.

### Profit Calculation:
For each number of men hired, calculate total revenue (TR), total cost (TC), and profit (π):

1. **1 man:**
   - TR = 15 tons * $10/ton = $150
   - TC = 1 man * $50/man = $50
   - Profit = $150 - $50 = $100

2. **2 men:**
   - TR = 25 tons * $10/ton = $250
   - TC = 2 men * $50/man = $100
   - Profit = $250 - $100 = $150

3. **3 men:**
   - TR = 33 tons * $10/ton = $330
   - TC = 3 men * $50/man = $150
   - Profit = $330 - $150 = $180

4. **4 men:**
   - TR = 38 tons * $10/ton = $380
   - TC = 4 men * $50/man = $200
   - Profit = $380 - $200 = $180

5. **5 men:**
   - TR = 42 tons * $10/ton = $420
   - TC = 5 men * $50/man = $250
   - Profit = $420 - $250 = $170

### Profit Analysis:
- Profit increases with the number of men hired up to 3 men, reaching $180.
- Hiring 4 men also yields $180 in profit.
- Hiring 5 men reduces profit to $170.

### Marginal Product Analysis:
- The marginal product (MP) is the increase in total physical product (TP) when hiring an additional worker.
- MRP = MP * Price per ton.

| Number of Men | TP | MP | MRP (MP * $10) |
|---------------|----|----|----------------|
| 1             | 15 | 15 | $150            |
| 2             | 25 | 10 | $100            |
| 3             | 33 | 8  | $80             |
| 4             | 38 | 5  | $50             |
| 5             | 42 | 4  | $40             |

- MRP decreases as more workers are hired.
- The wage rate is $50 per day.
- Hiring workers continues as long as MRP > wage. When MRP = wage, the firm is indifferent; hiring additional workers does not increase profit.

### Conclusion:
Both 3 and 4 men yield the same profit of $180. However, hiring 5 men reduces profit to $170. According to the rule, the firm should hire up to the point where MRP ≤ wage. Since MRP at 4 men equals the wage ($50), Mr. Falbo should hire **4 men** to maximize profits.
