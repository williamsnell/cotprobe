Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the x distance of the top of the hill. The equation given is z = 2xy -3x² -4y² -18x +28y +12. Hmm, I think I need to find the maximum point of this function because that would be the top of the hill. 

Wait, right. So in calculus, to find the maximum or minimum of a function, I should take the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, set them to zero, and solve the system of equations. That should give me the critical points, which in this case should be the top of the hill since the coefficients of the squared terms are negative (because the hills are downward opening, I think). 

Let me write down the function again: z = 2xy -3x² -4y² -18x +28y +12. 

First, find the partial derivative with respect to x. So, dz/dx = 2y -6x -18. Because the derivative of 2xy with respect to x is 2y, the derivative of -3x² is -6x, the derivative of -18x is -18, and the other terms don't involve x, so their derivatives are zero. 

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to y is dz/dy = 2x -8y +28. Because the derivative of 2xy with respect to y is 2x, the derivative of -4y² is -8y, and the rest don't involve y, so no changes there.

Now, set both partial derivatives to zero to find critical points.

From dz/dx: 2y -6x -18 = 0. Let's rearrange that: 6x = 2y -18 → 3x = y -9 → y = 3x +9. I'll note that as equation (1).

From dz/dy: 2x -8y +28 = 0. Let's rearrange: 2x +28 =8y → y = (2x +28)/8 → y = (x +14)/4. That's equation (2).

Now, set equation (1) equal to equation (2): 3x +9 = (x +14)/4.

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator: 4*(3x +9) = x +14 → 12x +36 = x +14.

Subtract x and 14 from both sides: 11x +22 =0 → 11x = -22 → x= -2.

Hmm, x is -2 meters. Looking at the options, that's option F: -3m? Wait, no, F is -3m, and our calculation gives x=-2m. So the options are A to J, and F is -3m. Wait, but wait, the options have F as -3m, which is different from our result. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. 

Equation (1): from dz/dx, 2y -6x -18=0 → 6x=2y-18 → 3x = y -9 → y=3x +9.

Equation (2): dz/dy: 2x -8y +28=0 → 2x +28=8y → y=(2x +28)/8 → y= (x +14)/4.

Set them equal: 3x +9 = (x +14)/4.

Multiply both sides by 4: 12x + 36 = x +14 → 12x -x =14 -36 → 11x = -22 → x= -2.

So x is -2 meters. Looking at the options, none directly say F as -2m. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:3m

B:-1m

C:4m

D:6m

E:2m

F:-3m

G:-2m

H:5m

I:0m

J:1m

Ah! Option G is -2m, which matches our result. So the x distance is -2 meters. Therefore, the answer should be G.

To find the x-coordinate of the top of the hill, we first compute the partial derivatives of the given function:

\[
z = 2xy - 3x^2 - 4y^2 - 18x + 28y + 12
\]

The partial derivatives are:

\[
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 2y - 6x - 18
\]
\[
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 2x - 8y + 28
\]

Setting these equal to zero to find critical points:

1. \( 2y - 6x - 18 = 0 \) → \( 3x = y - 9 \) → \( y = 3x + 9 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( 2x - 8y + 28 = 0 \) → \( y = \frac{x + 14}{4} \) (Equation 2)

Equating Equation 1 and 2:

\[
3x + 9 = \frac{x + 14}{4}
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
12x + 36 = x + 14
\]

Simplify:

\[
11x = -22 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
\]

Thus, the x-coordinate of the top of the hill is \(-2 \, \text{m}\). The correct option is G.
