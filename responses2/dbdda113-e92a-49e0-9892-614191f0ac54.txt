Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about marginal utility, budget constraints, and purchasing decisions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that David Jones has a budget of $7 to spend on two products, A and B. The price of each product is $1. The marginal utilities for A and B are given by the functions MU_A = 10 - x and MU_B = 21 - 2y, where x and y are the number of units purchased.

Hmm, I remember that the marginal utility is the additional satisfaction or utility gained from consuming one more unit. But how does that tie into purchasing decisions? Oh right, the idea is that consumers will allocate their budget in a way that the last unit they buy gives them the same marginal utility per dollar spent. So for each product, the marginal utility per dollar should be equal.

Since the price of both A and B is the same ($1), the marginal utility per dollar for each should be equal for David to maximize his utility. So, the ratio of MU_A to the price (which is 1) should equal the ratio of MU_B to its price. Which simplifies to MU_A = MU_B.

Wait, but since the price is the same, the marginal utility per dollar for A is just MU_A, and for B is MU_B. So David should buy until MU_A equals MU_B.

Let me compute the marginal utilities for different numbers of units. Let's see:

For product A, MU_A = 10 - x. So when x=1, MU_A=9; x=2, 8; 3,7; 4,6; 5,5; 6,4; 7,3.

For product B, MU_B=21-2y. So y=1, 19; y=2,17; 3,15; 4,13; 5,11; 6,9;7,7.

Wait, David's budget is $7, so he can buy a maximum of 7 units of A or B (since each is $1). But which combination of A and B will maximize his total utility?

Wait, but maybe the correct approach is to set MU_A = MU_B because both have the same price. So, setting 10 - x = 21 - 2y. Let's solve for x and y.

10 - x = 21 - 2y → 2y = 21 - (10 -x) → 2y = 11 +x → y = (11 +x)/2.

But David's total expenditure is x + y =7.

So substituting y from above: x + (11 +x)/2 =7. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominator:

2x +11 +x =14 → 3x +11=14 → 3x=3 → x=1. So y=(11+1)/2=6.

Wait, but that gives x=1 and y=6. So total units are 1+6=7, which matches the budget. But David's options are limited. Hmm, wait, but I think that approach assumes that the last unit bought gives the same marginal utility, which is the utility per dollar.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, people might stop when the marginal utility for the next unit is lower than the price, but in this problem, since the prices are equal, the only condition is that marginal utilities per dollar must be equal. So, if MU_A = MU_B, then that's the point of maximum utility.

So according to that, David should buy x=1 of A and y=6 of B. But let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B is one unit of A and six units of B. So that would be x=1, y=6. Another option is option G: three units of A and four units of B. Let me check if that's correct.

Wait, let's compute the marginal utilities for each option.

Option A: 2A, 4B. MU_A=10-2=8. MU_B=21-2*4=13. Not equal, so can't be optimal.

Option B: 1A,6B. MU_A=9, MU_B=21-12=9. So they are equal. So this is where MU_A per dollar equals MU_B per dollar. So this would be the optimal.

Option C: 2A,5B. MU_A=8, MU_B=21-10=11. Not equal. So not optimal.

Option D: 3A,3B. MU_A=7, MU_B=21-6=15. Not equal.

Option E: 0A,7B. MU_A=10, MU_B=21-14=7. Not equal.

Option F:5A,2B. MU_A=5, MU_B=21-4=17. Not equal.

Option G:3A,4B. MU_A=7, MU_B=21-8=13. Not equal.

Option H:6A,1B. MU_A=4, MU_B=19. Not equal.

Option I:4A,3B. MU_A=6, MU_B=21-6=15. Not equal.

Option J:7A,0B. MU_A=3, MU_B=21. Not equal.

So only option B has equal marginal utilities per dollar. So the answer should be option B: one unit of A and six units of B.

To determine how David maximizes his utility, we analyze the marginal utilities of products A and B, given the budget constraint. The marginal utilities are defined as:

- \( MU_A = 10 - x \)
- \( MU_B = 21 - 2y \)

Since the price of both products is $1, the marginal utility per dollar for A is \( MU_A \), and for B is \( MU_B \). David will allocate his budget such that these marginal utilities per dollar are equal, as this maximizes his total utility.

### Step 1: Set Marginal Utilities Equal
\[ 10 - x = 21 - 2y \]

### Step 2: Solve for One Variable in Terms of the Other
Rearranging the equation:
\[ 2y = 21 - (10 - x) \]
\[ 2y = 11 + x \]
\[ y = \frac{11 + x}{2} \]

### Step 3: Apply the Budget Constraint
The total expenditure is $7:
\[ x + y = 7 \]

Substitute \( y \) from the previous step:
\[ x + \frac{11 + x}{2} = 7 \]
Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the denominator:
\[ 2x + 11 + x = 14 \]
\[ 3x + 11 = 14 \]
\[ 3x = 3 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Substitute \( x = 1 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{11 + 1}{2} = 6 \]

Thus, David should purchase 1 unit of A and 6 units of B to equalize the marginal utility per dollar, maximizing his utility.

### Step 4: Verify Against Options
Checking the options, only **Option B (1 unit of A and 6 units of B)** satisfies the condition of equal marginal utilities per dollar.
