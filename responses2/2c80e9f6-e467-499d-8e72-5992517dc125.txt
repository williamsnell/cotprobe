Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about calculating the coulombs required to deposit a certain amount of zinc. Hmm, I remember that coulombs are related to electric charge and the amount of substance involved, especially in electrochemistry.

Alright, the problem states that we need to deposit 0.10 grams of zinc. Zinc's atomic mass is given as 65.38 g/mol, and its valence is 2. Valence, right, that's the positive charge of the metal ion, which in this case is Zn²+.

So, I think Faraday's laws of electrolysis are involved here. Faraday's laws relate the amount of substance deposited during an electrolysis to the charge passed through the circuit. The formula, if I recall correctly, is Q = n * F, where Q is the charge in coulombs, n is the number of moles of electrons, and F is Faraday's constant (which is about 96485 C/mol).

Wait, but wait. The number of moles of electrons depends on the valence of the metal ion. Since zinc has a +2 charge, each zinc atom will lose two electrons, right? So for each mole of Zn²+, two moles of electrons are released.

But wait, the amount of zinc is given in grams, so we need to find moles first. The atomic mass is 65.38 g/mol, so 0.10 grams would be 0.10 / 65.38 moles. Let me calculate that. 0.10 divided by 65.38. Let me do that math... 0.10 ÷ 65.38 is approximately 0.00153 moles of zinc.

Since each zinc atom gains 2 electrons, the moles of electrons (n) would be 0.00153 mol * 2 = 0.00306 mol of electrons.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, right! Because each Zn²+ ion requires two electrons to be reduced. But in the electrolysis process, the electrons flow through the circuit, so the amount of charge is based on the total electrons. So for each mole of Zn²+, 2 moles of electrons are involved.

So, n = 2 * (moles of Zn) = 2*(0.10g /65.38 g/mol).

Wait, let me calculate that again. Moles of Zn = 0.10 /65.38 = approximately 0.00153 mol.

So, moles of electrons = 2 * 0.00153 = 0.00306 mol.

Now, Faraday's constant F is 96485 C/mol. So charge Q = n * F = 0.00306 mol * 96485 C/mol.

Let me do the multiplication. 0.00306 * 96485. Let's compute that. 0.003 * 96485 is 289.455, and 0.00006 *96485 is about 5.7891. Adding them gives 295.244 C.

Wait, but wait, what's the exact calculation? Let me compute 0.00306 *96485.

0.00306 *96485 = (3.06e-3) * 96485 = 3.06 *96485 *1e-3.

Wait, 3.06 * 96485 equals... Let's compute 3 * 96485 = 289,455. 0.06 *96485 is 5,789.1. So total is 289,455 +5,789.1 = 295,244.1. Multiply by 1e-3: 295.2441 C.

Wait, so about 295 coulombs. Looking at the options, option E is 295 coulombs. But wait, the option E is 295, and the options are A to J.

But wait, wait another second. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.10 grams of zinc. Atomic mass is 65.38 g/mol. So 0.10 /65.38 = 0.00153 mol. Yes.

Each mole of Zn²+ requires 2 moles of electrons, so 0.00153 * 2=0.00306 mol of electrons.

So Q = 0.00306 * 96485 C = let me compute that more accurately. 0.00306 times 96485.

Let me compute 0.00306 * 96485.

Breaking it down:

0.003 * 96485 = 289.455

0.00006 *96485 = 5.7891

Adding them: 289.455 +5.7891= 295.2441 C.

So approximately 295.24 C. Looking at the options, option E is 295 coulombs. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. The options are:

A:450 B:350 C:400 D:200 E:295 F:175 G:100 H:150 I:250 J:325.

So yes, option E is 295.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I consider the correct formula? Oh, wait, another point: In electrolysis, when you're depositing a metal, the formula is Q = (n * F) where n is the number of moles of electrons. But wait, the valence is related to the electrons lost. Wait, but for Zn²+, each atom loses 2 electrons. So each mole would lose 2 moles of electrons.

But wait, the formula is correct. So 0.00306 mol of electrons * 96485 C/mol = 295.24 C. So E is 295, which is option E.

But wait, I had another thought. Wait, sometimes in these problems, they might refer to grams of metal. But in this case, it's the amount of zinc deposited, which should be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, what if I did 0.10 g * (1 mol Zn)/(65.38 g) * (2 mol e- / 1 mol Zn) * (96485 C/mol e-). Let me compute that.

0.10 g * (1/(65.38 g/mol)) gives 0.10/65.38 = 0.00153 mol Zn.

Multiply by 2: 0.00306 mol e-.

Multiply by 96485: 0.00306 *96485 = 295.24 C.

So, yes, that's 295 C. Which is option E. So the answer should be E.

To determine the number of coulombs required to deposit 0.10 gram of zinc, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The formula is:

\[
Q = n \cdot F
\]

where:
- \( Q \) is the charge in coulombs,
- \( n \) is the number of moles of electrons,
- \( F \) is Faraday's constant (\( 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate moles of zinc
The atomic mass of zinc is \( 65.38 \, \text{g/mol} \). The number of moles of zinc is:

\[
\text{Moles of Zn} = \frac{\text{Mass of Zn}}{\text{Atomic Mass of Zn}} = \frac{0.10 \, \text{g}}{65.38 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00153 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of electrons
Each mole of \( \text{Zn}^{2+} \) ion requires 2 moles of electrons for deposition. Therefore:

\[
n = 2 \cdot \text{Moles of Zn} = 2 \cdot 0.00153 \, \text{mol} \approx 0.00306 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate charge
Using Faraday's constant:

\[
Q = n \cdot F = 0.00306 \, \text{mol} \cdot 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \approx 295.24 \, \text{C}.
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated charge is approximately \( 295 \, \text{C} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
