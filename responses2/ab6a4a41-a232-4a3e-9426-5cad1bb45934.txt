Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to find the volume of hydrogen gas produced when calcium reacts with sulfuric acid. Hmm, let's see. I remember that stoichiometry is all about balancing equations and using mole ratios. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the reaction given is Ca + H₂SO₄ → CaSO₄ + H₂. The question says that 120 grams of calcium reacts. I need to find out how much hydrogen is produced at STP. Right, STP is standard temperature and pressure, which is 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atm. I think at STP, the molar volume of a gas is 22.4 liters per mole. Oh wait, that's a key point for calculations.

So the plan is: find moles of Ca, determine moles of H₂ produced using the balanced equation, then convert moles of H₂ to liters using the molar volume at STP.

Let's start with the molar mass of calcium. Calcium has an atomic number of 20, so its atomic weight is around 40 g/mol. So 120 g divided by 40 g/mol is 3 moles of Ca. That's easy enough.

The balanced equation shows that 1 mole of Ca produces 1 mole of H₂. So 3 moles of Ca will produce 3 moles of H₂.

Now, converting moles of H₂ to liters. Since at STP, 1 mole is 22.4 liters. So 3 moles times 22.4 liters per mole is 67.2 liters. Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:33.6, B:56, C:3, D:84, E:67.2, F:44.8, G:134.4, H:120, I:11.2, J:22.4.

So option E is 67.2 liters. That's what I got. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternative approach: sometimes, I get confused between the number of moles of H2 and the products. Let me make sure. The balanced equation for the reaction is Ca + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + H2. So 1 mole Ca → 1 mole H2. So yes, 3 moles Ca would produce 3 moles H2. 3 * 22.4 = 67.2. So yes, E is correct.

To determine the volume of hydrogen gas produced when 120 g of calcium reacts with sulfuric acid, we start by balancing the reaction:

**Ca + H₂SO₄ → CaSO₄ + H₂**

From the balanced equation, **1 mole of Ca produces 1 mole of H₂**. The molar mass of calcium (Ca) is approximately **40 g/mol**, so:

\[
\text{Moles of Ca} = \frac{\text{Mass of Ca}}{\text{Molar mass of Ca}} = \frac{120 \, \text{g}}{40 \, \text{g/mol}} = 3 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since **1 mole of Ca produces 1 mole of H₂**, **3 moles of Ca produce 3 moles of H₂**.

At STP, the molar volume of a gas is **22.4 liters per mole**. Therefore, the volume of **3 moles of H₂** is:

\[
\text{Volume of H₂} = \text{Moles of H₂} \times \text{Molar volume at STP} = 3 \, \text{mol} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 67.2 \, \text{L}.
\]

Thus, the volume of hydrogen gas produced is **67.2 liters**, which corresponds to option **E**.

**ANSWER: E**
