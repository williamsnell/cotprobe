Question:

An avid baseball fan learned that a local professional baseball club was conducting a baseball camp for fans who wanted to meet and receive instruction from the club's players. The cost of the two-week camp was advertised for $2,500, which included meals and housing. The fan, a 54-year-old salesman, forwarded the club a $50 registration deposit, which reserved him a spot in the baseball camp. Thereafter, the fan received a contract from the club, which all baseball camp attendees were required to sign. The agreement provided that the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable. According to the agreement, all attendees would receive group instruction during the baseball camp. Consequently, the club's operating costs would not be reduced if one or more of the attendees failed to participate or complete the two-week program. The fan signed the contract and forwarded it with his $2,500 entrance fee to the club. Two days before the start of the baseball camp, however, the fan died from a heart attack. In a restitutionary action, can the executor of the fan's estate, a surviving brother, recover on behalf of the estate either all or part of the $2,500 paid to the club?

Options:

A: Yes, because the club did not incur any cost related to the fan's participation.
B: Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.
C: No, because the club had already invested in resources for the camp.
D: No, because the fan knew the risks when he signed the contract.
E: No, because the fan's death was not the club's responsibility.
F: No, because under the terms of the agreement the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable.
G: No, but only if the club can show that before the start of the baseball camp it rejected another applicant because of its commitment to the fan.
H: Yes, if the club can fill the spot with another attendee.
I: Yes, because the club would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the fan's expense.
J: Yes, because the fan didn't receive the service he paid for.

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about whether a executor can recover a $2,500 fee that a baseball fan paid. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the scenario carefully. A local baseball club is running a camp. The cost is $2,500, which includes meals and housing. The fan, who's 54 and a salesman, got a $50 registration deposit, which he used to get a spot in the camp. Then, he signed a contract from the club, which requires all attendees to pay the entrance fee. The contract says the fee is non-refundable, so if the fan didn't come, he can't get his money back. 

The key point here is that the contract was signed, and the fee is non-refundable. Now, the fan died from a heart attack two days before camp. The question is whether his executor can seek restitution against the club.

I need to think about the law here. The main issue is whether the club can recover the $2,500. There are a few possible defenses, and I need to figure out which one applies.

Option A says the club didn't incur any costs because the fee is non-refundable. But that's not right because even if the fee is non-refundable, the club is still responsible for paying the amount they're charging. The fee is a contract term, so the club still has to pay, unless the contract is for free. So A is probably not correct.

Option B is about frustration of purpose. That relates to whether the purpose of the contract was to provide a service, and if the contract was breached, the service can't be deducted. Here, the contract says the fee is non-refundable. If the contract is for a service, the frustration of purpose doctrine would bar the recovery of the fee. That seems relevant.

Option C says the club had already invested in resources for the camp. But the fee is non-refundable, which is a separate issue. The club has already invested in the camp, which would mean they've committed resources, but the contract's terms don't depend on that investment. So C might not apply here.

Option D mentions the fan knew the risks. If the contract was a commitment for the fan, then the risks are with him. But the contract is non-refundable, so that doesn't directly affect the recovery of the fee. Unless the contract was for a service that requires the participant to take risks, but the fee itself isn't refundable, so the risk isn't a factor in the fee recovery.

Option E says the fan's death wasn't the club's responsibility. But the contract was from the club, so the outcome was under the club's control. The executor can seek compensation for the act of dying, but the fee is non-refundable. So even if the death was outside the club's control, the fee is still a contract term.

Option F says the fee was non-refundable, which would bar recovery. That aligns with frustration of purpose. The contract terms (non-refundable fee) would prevent the fee from being recovered because the contract entailed the payment regardless. So F seems correct.

Option G talks about the club rejecting another applicant because of commitment. But the fee is non-refundable, so unless the contract allowed for a refund upon a breach, this doesn't apply. The contract didn't say anything about refunds upon failure to attend, so G isn't applicable.

Option H says the club would otherwise be enriched. But the fee is a contract term, so the club's financial loss is fixed. Unless the contract was for a service that the participant took on, but the fee isn't refundable. So H is probably not correct.

Option I says the fee was paid but not received. If the contract is for a service, the fee is an obligation, not an obligation to receive payment. So I doesn't apply.

Option J says the fan didn't receive the service. But the contract says it's non-refundable, so the fee isn't refundable regardless of whether the participant received the service. Unless the contract was for a service where the participant had to pay, but in this case, the contract is non-refundable, so J is incorrect.

So the main issue is whether the club has a right to the $2,500. The non-refundable clause in the contract likely bars the recovery of the fee. The frustration of purpose doctrine applies here because the contract entailed the payment regardless of whether the participant attended. Therefore, the executor can seek the recovery of the fee.

The executor can recover the $2,500 fee because the contract was non-refundable, embodying the frustration of purpose doctrine. The contract entailed the payment regardless of attendance, preventing recovery.
