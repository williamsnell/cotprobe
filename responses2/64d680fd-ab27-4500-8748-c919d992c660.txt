Okay, so I've got this digital filter equation here: y(n) = (1/3)(x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2)). I need to find the poles of the filter. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on digital filters, but I'll try to remember.

Wait, digital filters are usually described by their transfer functions. The transfer function H(z) relates the input and output in the z-domain. Oh right, the system function is Y(z)/X(z), so for this equation, I can probably express H(z) by taking the z-transform.

Let me think. The given equation is y(n) = (1/3)x(n) + (1/3)x(n-1) + (1/3)x(n-2). Taking z-transforms on both sides. The z-transform of x(n) is X(z), x(n-1) is X(z) multiplied by z^-1, and similarly for the others. So Y(z) = (1/3)X(z) + (1/3)X(z) z^-1 + (1/3) X(z) z^-2.

So factoring out X(z), Y(z) = (1/3) X(z) [1 + z^-1 + z^-2]. Then Y(z)/X(z) is (1/3)(1 + z^-1 + z^-2). To write this as a transfer function, I can multiply numerator and denominator by z^2 to eliminate the negative exponents. So multiplying both sides by z^2:

Y(z) z^2 / X(z) z^2 = (1/3)(z^2 + z + 1).

So H(z) = (z^2 + z + 1) / (3 z^2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the transfer function is H(z) = Y(z)/X(z) = (1/3)(z^2 + z + 1) / z^2.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck that. Y(z) is (1/3)(X(z) (z^2 + z + 1)), so H(z) = (z^2 + z + 1)/(3 z^2). So the denominator is 3 z², and the numerator is z² + z + 1.

So the denominator of H(z) is 3 z². To find the poles, we set the denominator equal to zero. So 3 z² = 0 → z² = 0 → z=0, but multiplicity two. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because there are poles at z=0 twice. But I think I might have a mistake in the transfer function.

Wait, wait, maybe I missed a step. Let me redo the transfer function. Starting again: y(n) = (x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2))/3.

Taking z-transforms: Y(z) = (X(z) + z^-1 X(z) + z^-2 X(z)) /3.

So Y(z) = (X(z) (1 + z^-1 + z^-2 )) /3.

Factor out X(z): Y(z)/X(z) = (1 + z^-1 + z^-2)/3.

Multiply numerator and denominator by z² to eliminate negative powers: 

( z² (1 + z^-1 + z^-2 ) ) / (3 z² )

Which becomes (z² + z + 1)/(3 z²).

So H(z) is (z² + z + 1)/(3 z²). So the denominator is 3 z². The denominator polynomial is 3 z², so the poles are the roots of 3 z² = 0 → z²=0 → z=0 (double root). So the poles are at z=0.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because digital filters usually have poles at finite points. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Because sometimes when I'm dealing with transfer functions, if a pole is at z=0, that's a pole at DC (infinity), which is a bit unusual for a digital filter, but possible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the transfer function. Let me check the original equation again. Oh wait, maybe I misapplied the transform.

Wait, the transfer function is H(z) = (1/3)(1 + z^-1 + z^-2) → which is (z² + z +1 )/(3 z²). So the denominator is 3 z². So the poles are at z=0, with multiplicity 2.

But another thought: Could the transfer function be expressed differently? Because sometimes, we might write H(z) as (z² + z +1 )/(3 z² ), but perhaps I should check if there's another form.

Wait, maybe another approach: the system is a linear combination of the current and two previous inputs. So, the system is y(n) = (1/3)x(n) + (1/3)x(n-1) + (1/3)x(n-2). So in terms of the difference equation, it's y(n) = (x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2))/3.

The characteristic equation is obtained by replacing y(n) with z^n Y and x(n) with z^n X. So, Y(z) z^n = (X(z) z^n + X(z) z^{n-1} + X(z) z^{n-2} ) /3.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, the transfer function is (1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2})/(3). So H(z)= (z² + z +1 )/(3 z²).

But wait, when you take the transfer function, the poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial. The denominator here is 3 z². So the denominator is 3 z² = 0 → z² =0 → z=0, double root.

So the poles are at z=0, which is the origin. But wait, that's a pole at DC, which is a bit unusual. Digital filters usually have poles inside the unit circle, but this one has a pole at the origin, which is on the unit circle (since |z|=0 < 1, wait no: |z|=0 is inside the unit circle.

Wait, no: On the unit circle, |z|=1. So z=0 is inside the unit circle. So in this case, the filter has poles inside the unit circle, so it's a stable filter.

Wait, but the options given are A:1/2, B:3, C:-3, D:-2, E:0, F:-1, G:-1/2, H:1, I:1/3, J:2.

So the poles are at z=0, but 0 isn't one of the options except E. So the answer would be E:0.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. The transfer function H(z) is (z² + z +1 )/(3 z²). So the denominator is 3 z². So the poles are at z=0 (double pole). So the poles are at 0.

But looking at the options, E is 0. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the system's poles in terms of the system function. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the transfer function. Let me re-express the equation.

Wait, the original equation: y(n) = (x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2))/3.

Expressed in terms of the system function, H(z) = Y(z)/X(z) = [ (z^2 + z +1 ) / z^2 ] * (1/3) ?

Wait, no, maybe I forgot a step. Let me think about the transform again.

Y(z) = sum_{k=0}^2 h_k z^{-k} X(z), where h_k are the coefficients.

In this case, the coefficients are for x(n), x(n-1), x(n-2): they are all 1/3. So,

Y(z) = (1/3) X(z) (1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2} )

So H(z) = (1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}) /3.

To make this a function of z, multiply numerator and denominator by z^2: 

Y(z) z^2 = (1/3) X(z) (z^2 + z +1 )

So H(z)= (z^2 + z +1)/(3 z²).

So denominator is 3 z², zeros at z=0 (double root).

So the poles are at z=0. So the answer is E:0.

To determine the poles of the digital filter described by the equation \( y(n) = \frac{1}{3}(x(n) + x(n-1) + x(n-2)) \), we start by taking the \( z \)-transform of both sides. The \( z \)-transform of \( y(n) \) is \( Y(z) \), and the \( z \)-transform of \( x(n) \), \( x(n-1) \), and \( x(n-2) \) are \( X(z) \), \( z^{-1}X(z) \), and \( z^{-2}X(z) \), respectively. Thus, the transformed equation becomes:

\[
Y(z) = \frac{1}{3}X(z) \left( 1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2} \right).
\]

The transfer function \( H(z) \), which is the ratio \( Y(z)/X(z) \), is:

\[
H(z) = \frac{1}{3} \frac{1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2}}{1}.
\]

To express this in terms of positive powers of \( z \), multiply the numerator and denominator by \( z^2 \):

\[
H(z) = \frac{1}{3} \frac{z^2 + z + 1}{z^2}.
\]

The denominator of \( H(z) \) is \( 3z^2 \). The poles of the system are the roots of the denominator, which are the solutions to \( 3z^2 = 0 \). This gives \( z = 0 \) (a double root). Since \( z = 0 \) lies on the unit circle (its magnitude is less than 1), the system is stable.

From the given options, the pole at \( z = 0 \) corresponds to answer \( E \).
