Okay, so I have this question about the function of "standard-setting in human rights diplomacy." Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that in diplomacy, especially in international relations, there's a concept of standard-setting. I think it's related to creating norms or agreements. But wait, what exactly does that mean? I think it's about establishing what's considered acceptable behavior or standards in the field of human rights.

The question gives four options. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says standard-setting means putting forward binding legal standards. So, binding here means that these standards are legally enforceable. Like, if I set a standard that no country can break, that's binding. But I'm not sure if that's exactly correct because I've heard sometimes it's about non-binding standards. Also, I thought it's more about what is customary or customary international relations rather than legal.

Option B claims it's merely proposing binding legal standards. Hmm, so if it's just putting forward the standards, not enforcing them, that doesn't sound right. I thought standard-setting is more about creating norms that are legally binding. So B might be incorrect.

Option C suggests standard-setting means putting forward non-binding legal standards. Wait, that doesn't sound right either. Non-binding would mean the standards are not legally enforced, but I think standard-setting is more about creating or enforcing binding ones. So C might be wrong.

Option D says standard-setting means setting certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties. Okay, this makes more sense. In international law, treaties often outline conduct expected of states. So people might set standards for conduct, which would fall under standard-setting. So D seems correct.

Wait, but I should make sure. I remember that in international relations, countries set norms for each other, which are called standards. These are established through dialogue and are meant to be binding, but they might be non-binding if the parties disagree. But the function is more about setting the norms, which are then enforced by the treaties.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D.
