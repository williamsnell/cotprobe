Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the Colonial Cookie Company's earnings. Let me read it carefully again.

The question says that the company pays on a piece-rate basis at 80 cents per piece. Mrs. Batter completed some acceptable pieces each day last week. I need to find her total earnings for the week.

The data given is the number of pieces she made each day:
- Monday: 45
- Tuesday: 41
- Wednesday: 49
- Thursday: 47
- Friday: 43

So, the first step is to figure out how much she makes each day by multiplying the number of pieces by the pay rate. The pay rate is 80 cents per piece, which is $0.80.

Let me calculate each day's earnings separately.

Monday: 45 pieces × $0.80
Hmm, 45 times 0.8. Let me compute that. 40 pieces would be 40 * 0.8 = $32, and 5 pieces would be 5 * 0.8 = $4. So total is $32 + $4 = $36.

Tuesday: 41 pieces × $0.80. Let's see, 40 is $32, and 1 is $0.80, so $32 + $0.80 = $32.80.

Wednesday: 49 pieces × $0.80. 40 is 32, 9 is $7.20 (since 9 * 0.80 is 7.20). So 32 + 7.20 = $39.20.

Thursday: 47 pieces × $0.80. 40 is 32, 7 is $5.60. So 32 + 5.60 = $37.60.

Friday: 43 pieces × $0.80. 40 is 32, 3 is $2.40. So 32 + 2.40 = $34.40.

Now, I need to add up all these daily earnings to get the total for the week.

Let me list them out:
- Monday: $36.00
- Tuesday: $32.80
- Wednesday: $39.20
- Thursday: $37.60
- Friday: $34.40

Adding them up step by step.

First, add Monday and Tuesday: 36 + 32.80 = 68.80.

Then add Wednesday: 68.80 + 39.20 = 108.00.

Add Thursday: 108 + 37.60 = 145.60.

Finally, add Friday: 145.60 + 34.40 = 180.00.

Wait, that adds up to $180.00. Let me check the options again. Option J is $180.

Alternatively, maybe I should add another way to double-check. Let me sum the amounts again.

Another approach: Let me add all the pieces first.

45 + 41 = 86
86 +49 =135
135 +47= 182
182 +43=225

So total pieces are 225. At $0.80 per piece, total earnings would be 225 * 0.80.

Calculating 225 * 0.80: 200 * 0.80 = 160, 25 * 0.80=20. So total is 160 +20= $180.

Yes, that matches the earlier total. So the correct answer should be J, $180.

The total earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of pieces by the pay rate for each day and then summing them up, or by summing the total pieces and multiplying by the rate. Both methods yield $180.

Answer: J: $180
