Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find an integer n greater than or equal to 1. The condition is that when I compute n multiplied by 2 raised to the power of (n+1), and then add 1, the result should be a perfect square. The options given are A through J, with each option being a different number. I need to figure out which one of these is the correct n.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. I need to find an integer n where n * 2^(n+1) + 1 equals some square number. So, mathematically, that's n * 2^{n+1} + 1 = k², where k is an integer. My task is to check each of the options to see which one satisfies this equation.

Let me list out the options again for clarity:
A: 5
B: 10
C: 8
D: 7
E: 1
F: 3
G: 2
H: 9
I: 4
J: 6

So, I need to test each of these n values and see if n * 2^{n+1} + 1 is a perfect square. Let's go one by one.

Starting with option E: n=1.

Calculating: 1 * 2^(1+1) +1 = 1 * 4 +1 = 5. Is 5 a perfect square? Hmm, 2² is 4 and 3² is 9. 5 is in between, so no. So E is out.

Option F: n=3.

Calculating: 3 * 2^(3+1) +1 = 3*16 +1 = 48 +1=49. Oh, 49 is 7². That's a perfect square! So F seems to satisfy the condition. But wait, let me check the other options just in case, because maybe more than one works, but the question says "Find integer n...", implying perhaps there's only one correct answer, but I shouldn't assume. Let me check the rest.

Option A: n=5.

Compute: 5 * 2^(5+1) +1 =5*64 +1= 320 +1=321. Is 321 a square? The squares around 320 are 17²=289 and 18²=324. So 321 is not a square. So A is no.

Option B: n=10.

10 * 2^(11) +1 =10 * 2048 +1=20480 +1=20481. Hmm, what's the square root of 20481? Let's see. 143² is 20449, 144² is 20736. So, 143²=20449, which is 20481 -20449=32 less, so not a square. So B is no.

Option C: n=8.

8 * 2^(9) +1=8*512 +1=4096 +1=4097. What's the square around 4097? 64²=4096, 65²=4225. So 4097 is 64² +1, which is 4097, but that's not a perfect square, since 64² is 4096, so it's just one more. So no, 4097 is not a square. So C is out.

Option D: n=7.

7 * 2^(8) +1=7*256 +1=1792 +1=1793. Is 1793 a square? Let's think. 42²=1764, 43²=1849. So 1793 is between them. 42² is 1764, 1764+29=1793. So 42²+29, not a square. So D is no.

Option G: n=2.

2 * 2^(3) +1=2*8 +1=16 +1=17. 17 is not a perfect square (4²=16, 5²=25). So G is no.

Option H: n=9.

9 * 2^(10) +1=9*1024 +1=9216 +1=9217. What's the square around that? 96²=9216, 97²=9409. So 9217 is 96² +1, which is not a square. So H is no.

Option I: n=4.

4 * 2^(5) +1=4*32 +1=128 +1=129. 129 isn't a perfect square. 11²=121, 12²=144. So 129 is in between, not a square. So I is no.

Option J: n=6.

6 * 2^(7) +1=6*128 +1=768 +1=769. Is 769 a perfect square? 27² is 729, 28² is 784. So 769 is 729 +40, not a square. So J is out.

Wait, but earlier I found that n=3 gives 49, which is 7². So F is the correct option. Let me just recheck my calculations for n=3.

n=3: 3 * 2^(4) = 3*16=48. 48 +1=49=7². Yep, that's correct. So F is the right answer.

The correct answer is F, which corresponds to n=3.

Answer: F
