Alright, so I've got this question about floating-point arithmetic. Hmm, let's break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true. The options are A to E. I remember that floating-point numbers are a bit tricky because they can't represent all numbers exactly. But I'm a bit confused about the properties of operations on them.

Let me recall some concepts. Floating-point arithmetic isn't associative. Oh wait, that's because of the way numbers are stored in binary. For example, (1 + 2) + 3 is 6, but 1 + (2 + 3) is also 6. But sometimes, due to rounding errors, the two might not be exactly the same. So, A says it's inherently nonassociative because of some numbers not having exact representations. That sounds right because when you do operations, the way you group them can lead to different results due to the limited bits. So A is true.

Option B says all operations are commutative. Wait, commutative means a + b = b + a. Yes, addition and multiplication are commutative, but what about other operations? Like, subtraction isn't commutative. Oh wait, but wait, in floating-point arithmetic, when you subtract two numbers, the order matters. But the question is about all operations. Oh wait, but some operations are commutative, others are not. So B says all operations are commutative, which I don't think is true. Because, for example, a + b is commutative, but a - b is not. So B is false.

Wait, but sometimes people might think that all operations are commutative, but that's not the case. So B is incorrect. But let's check other options.

Option C: It is inherently nonassociative because there must be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers. Oh, right. Floating-point numbers have a limited range. So adding numbers beyond the range would cause overflow or underflow, leading to loss of precision. So when you have operations like (a + b) + c vs a + (b + c), if the intermediate steps exceed the range, the result might not be the same. So C is correct.

Option D: Associativity can be achieved with appropriate roundoff conventions. Hmm, that's interesting. So even though in exact arithmetic, it's nonassociative, maybe with some rounding, you can make it associative. I'm not sure. Wait, but how? How could that be? Like, maybe by choosing the right rounding mode, you can make it associative, but I don't remember. Or maybe it's possible with certain data types. But I'm not certain. Wait, I think that in IEEE floating-point, the operations are associative in the sense that you can represent a + b + c as (a + b) + c or a + (b + c) without issues. But wait, no, because the order can affect the result due to rounding. Oh wait, but sometimes, if the operations are done in a specific order, you can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps in certain cases, it's possible to make it associative. So D sounds correct.

Option E: Some rational numbers have no exact representation. Oh right, because most rationals can't be represented exactly in binary floating-point. So for example, 0.1 in decimal isn't exactly representable in binary. So E is true.

So putting it together, the incorrect statement is B because it's not true that all operations are commutative. Because, for example, a - b is not equal to b - a, so subtraction is not commutative. So option B is false, making it the correct answer.

The correct answer is the statement that is NOT true. 

**Option B** is false because subtraction is not commutative in floating-point arithmetic. For example, \( a - b \) is not equal to \( b - a \). Therefore, the statement claiming all operations are commutative is incorrect.

**ANSWER: B**
