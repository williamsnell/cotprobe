Question:

How are nutrients and waste materials transported from the circulatory system to the body's tissues?

Options:

A: Waste materials are expelled from the body's tissues through the skin, while nutrients are provided by the respiratory system
B: Transportation occurs through the arteries
C: Nutrients and waste materials are exchanged between the circulatory system and tissues via osmosis in the large arteries
D: Transportation is facilitated by the veins
E: Nutrients are transported to the tissues by the red blood cells, and waste is carried away by the white blood cells
F: The spleen filters out waste from the blood, while nutrients are distributed by the liver directly to tissues
G: Nutrients and waste materials are transported from the circulatory system to the body's tissues through the capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs due to diffusion. The capillaries' thin wall and extensive branching allows this process.
H: Exchange of materials happens in the heart
I: The lymphatic system independently handles the transport of nutrients and waste to and from tissues
J: Nutrients and waste are directly transferred from the digestive system to the tissues without involving the circulatory system

Okay, so I have this question about how nutrients and waste materials are transported from the circulatory system to the body's tissues. Hmm, I remember that the circulatory system is all about blood, so I think it's related to the blood moving through various parts of the body.

Let me think about the options. The circulatory system includes the arteries, veins, and capillaries. Capillaries are the tiny vessels where exchange of materials happens, right? Because I remember that in the body, the blood doesn't flow through the capillaries directly; instead, it's the capillaries that make the cut-off point between the circulatory system and the tissues.

So, nutrients are probably delivered via the blood. But how? If the circulatory system is the heart, then the blood in the arteries carries nutrients. But what about waste materials? I think waste is pumped out of the body through the digestive system, not the circulatory system. So the circulatory system doesn't directly transport waste.

Looking at the options, option G says that nutrients and waste are transported through capillaries, which makes sense. Capillaries allow diffusion, so nutrients and waste can get into the tissues. But wait, the circulatory system carries the blood, which carries these substances. So the transport from the circulatory system (via blood) to the tissues is via the capillaries.

Wait, option G says the transport is through the capillaries, so that's correct. So, the circulatory system carries the blood, and the capillaries exchange the nutrients and waste inside the blood. So the nutrients and waste are being transported from the circulatory system (the blood) into the tissues via the capillaries. The circulatory system is the pathway, and the capillaries are where the exchange happens.

Other options: Option E says nutrients are by red blood cells and waste by white blood cells. But I think red blood cells carry oxygen, not nutrients. And white blood cells are involved in immune responses, not waste transport. So E is probably wrong.

Option H refers to exchange in the heart, which I don't think is right because the heart is part of the circulatory system, not the capillaries.

Option I is about the lymphatic system handling it independently. I don't recall that. The lymphatic system is separate, but it's more about transporting excess fluids and immune cells, not the same as the circulatory system.

Option J says nutrients are directly transferred from the digestive system without the circulatory system. That's incorrect because the digestive system is where nutrients are absorbed, but they're not being transported through the circulatory system. The circulatory system brings them into the blood, but the transport through the blood is via capillaries, not directly.

So the correct answer is G. It correctly states that nutrients and waste are transported from the circulatory system (via blood) to the tissues via capillaries, allowing diffusion.

The correct answer is G. 

**Explanation:** The circulatory system transports nutrients and waste through the blood, but these substances are exchanged with tissues via capillaries. Capillaries allow diffusion, enabling the transport of nutrients and waste internally. Other options are incorrect because they either confuse the roles of different blood components or describe processes outside the circulatory system.

**Answer:** G
