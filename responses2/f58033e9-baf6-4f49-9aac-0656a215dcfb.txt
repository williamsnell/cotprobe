Question:

You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?

Options:

A: 150%
B: 0.45%
C: 0.164%
D: 1.64%
E: 183%
F: 2.45%
G: 245%
H: 164%
I: 75%
J: 200%

Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the estimated yearly yield on an investment in a limousine. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the limo costs $98,000. I guess that's the initial investment. Then, each day, the limo is hired for 2 hours, and the hourly rate is $245. Wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. Oh right, it says the limo is hired for 2 hours a day on average, and daily costs at about $50. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because the hourly rate is $245, but if it's 2 hours a day, how does that break down? I think I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says "the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50." Hmm, so perhaps the daily cost is $50, regardless of the hours used. So maybe the $50 is the daily rental cost, not the hourly rate. That makes more sense because if it's 245 per hour, that's a pretty expensive rate. So, the $50 is the daily cost, not the cost per hour.

So, the daily cost is $50. Then, let's think about the revenue. Each day, they get paid $245 per hour for 2 hours. So that's 2 * $245 per day. Let me calculate that: 2 * 245 = $490 per day.

So, daily rental revenue is $490, and daily cost is $50. Therefore, the profit per day would be $490 - $50 = $440 per day.

Now, the question is about the yearly yield. So, I need to calculate the total profit for the entire year. Let's see, a year has 365 days. So, total profit is $440 per day multiplied by 365 days.

Let me compute that: 440 * 365. Hmm, 440 * 300 is 132,000, and 440 * 65 is 28,600. Adding those together gives 160,600. So, total profit is $160,600.

Wait, but the initial investment is $98,000. So, the yield is profit divided by investment. So, $160,600 / $98,000 â‰ˆ 1.6387755... which is approximately 163.88%. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option H is 164%, which would match that. So, the answer should be H: 164%.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Let me calculate the total revenue again. 2 hours a day at $245/hour is 2*245 = $490 per day. Daily cost is $50, so $440 profit per day. Multiply by 365 days: 440 * 365. Let me compute that again. 365 * 440. Let's break it down: 365 * 400 is 146,000. 365 * 40 is 14,600. So, 146,000 +14,600= 160,600. Yep, same as before.

So, profit is $160,600. So, 160600 / 98000. Let me compute that. 98000 *1.64 is 98000*1=98,000; 98,000*0.64=62,720. So 98,000 +62,720=160,720, which is just a bit over 160,600. So, about 1.64 times the investment. So, 164% is the correct percentage.

Looking at the options, H is 164%, so that's the answer.

The limo investment of $98,000 is expected to generate a profit each day. With a daily rental revenue of $490 and a daily cost of $50, the daily profit is $440. Over a year (365 days), the total profit is $160,600. Dividing this by the initial investment gives a yield of approximately 164%. 

Answer: H: 164%
