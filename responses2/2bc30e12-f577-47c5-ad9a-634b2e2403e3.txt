Okay, so I've got this question here about percentiles and scores. Hmm, let me think. Let me read it again.

Mary and Pam took the same test. Mary scored at the 64th percentile, and Pam at the 56th. The question is asking which statement is true. The options are A to J.

Wait, percentiles. I remember that a percentile rank indicates the percentage of people who scored lower than you. So if someone is at the 64th percentile, that means 64% of the test-takers scored lower than them. Similarly, Pam at 56th percentiles means 56% scored lower than her.

So Mary's score is higher than Pam's, right? Because higher percentile means more people scored below her. So Mary has a higher score than Pam.

Now, let's look at the options.

Option A: 36% scored lower than Pam. Wait, Pam is at 56th percentile. So 56% scored lower. So 56% of the people scored lower than Pam. So option A says 36% scored lower than Pam, which would be incorrect. So A is false.

Option B: Eight percent scored between Pam and Mary. Hmm. Between them, the percentiles are 56 and 64. The difference is 8. But how does that translate to the number of people? Well, if there are N test-takers, then the number between them would be about 8% of N. So if N is large, like 100, then 8% of 100 is 8. But the question doesn't specify the total number of test-takers. Wait, but the problem says "the same test", but doesn't give a number. So maybe the question is assuming a standard scale. But wait, percentiles don't directly translate to absolute numbers unless you know the total. For example, if 100 people took the test, then 56 scored below Pam, 64 below Mary, and the difference is 8 people between them. So option B would be correct if talking about 100 people. But the question doesn't specify. Oh, but the question is just about the relative positions, not the absolute numbers. So if the test has, say, 200 people, then 56% would be 112 below Pam and 128 below Mary. So 128-112=16 people between them. So option B's statement would be 8, which would be too low. So without knowing N, we can't be certain. Hmm, maybe option B is not necessarily correct. Or maybe the question is assuming a large enough N that 8% is a good approximation.

Wait, but the question is about the true statement. Let's see the other options.

Option C: Mary scored 64% of the total points and Pam 56%. No, that's not right. Percentile means position in distribution, not actual percentage. So 64th percentile doesn't mean Mary scored 64%; she scored higher than 64% of the test-takers. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Mary scored eight more points than Pam. No, percentiles don't indicate absolute scores. So D is not correct.

Option E: Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's. Wait, percentiles are about the percentage of people below, not the absolute difference. So 64th vs 56th doesn't directly translate to an 8% score difference. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Mary scored 64 points, Pam 56. Well, that's assuming a 100-point scale, but the question doesn't specify. So F is likely incorrect unless the test is scaled that way, which isn't mentioned.

Option G: 56 people scored lower than Mary. Well, Mary is at 64th, so 64% scored below her. So if N is 100, 64 people scored below, but the option says 56. So this would be incorrect unless N is 80, which makes 64% of 80 is 51.2, which is 51 people. Hmm, maybe the question is assuming a different scale. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that Mary's score is 64 and Pam's is 56, but that's not correct in percentiles. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Mary and Pam are in the top 64th and 56th percent of all students respectively. Wait, percentiles are how you rank, not where you stand in the distribution. So the top percentiles mean more people scored higher than you. So Mary is in the top 64th, but her actual score may not be in the top 64th of all students, unless the total is larger. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The 64th percentile is the value where 64% of the people scored lower. So the top 64th percentile would mean that more people scored higher, right? Or no, the percentile rank is the percentage of people who scored lower, so the top percentiles are in the higher ranges. Hmm, maybe H is not correct. Let me think: If Mary is at 64th, that means 64% scored lower, so she's in the top 36% (since 100-64=36). So H says Mary is in the top 64th, which doesn't make sense. The top percentiles are for the higher end. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam. That would mean that 36% scored higher than both. Since Mary is higher than Pam, if there are N people, the number between them would be (64-56)=8% of N, right? So if N=100, 8 people. So option I says 36, which would be 36% of 100. But that's only if N is 100, but the question doesn't specify. So I's statement is only true if N is 100, but since the question doesn't specify, we can't assume that. So I's incorrect.

Option J: Eight people scored higher than both. Same as above, the number depends on N. So J's statement is only correct if N is 100, but the question doesn't give that. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but let me re-examine option B again. If N is 200, then 56% is 112 below, 64% is 128 below. So the difference is 16. So option B would be 16 people between them, not eight. So B is incorrect.

Hmm, so which options are left? Looking back, the only option that could be correct is B if N is 100. But the question doesn't specify that, so B's statement isn't necessarily correct. Wait, but another possibility: the question is about the relative positions, so option B is correct if we consider the 56th and 64th percentiles. Between them, the percentage is 8%, but the number of people is 8% of N. But the option says 8% scored in that range. So if N is 100, 8% is 8 people. Since the question doesn't specify N, perhaps the answer is option B is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me review all the options again.

Wait, option B says eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary. So if N is the total, 8% of N is between them. But the option says 'eight percent', which is a percentage, not a number. So regardless of N, option B's statement is talking about 8% of the test takers scoring in that range. So if N is, say, 100, that's 8 people. But if N is 200, it's 16 people. Since the question doesn't specify N, we can't say for sure. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Wait, but another approach: the options are about what is true. So let's think about what each option is saying in terms of the percentiles.

Option B: 8% of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary. So between Pam (56th) and Mary (64th) percentiles, the people in that range are those who are higher than 56th and lower than 64th. The difference is 8 percentage points. However, the percentage of people in that range depends on the total number of test-takers. Without knowing N, we can't say for sure that exactly 8% scored in that range. So option B is incorrect because it's a percentage, not an absolute number.

Hmm, so which of the options is correct?

Wait, another angle: the 64th percentile is Mary, 56th is Pam. So Mary's score is higher than Pam's. So the correct statements would be about relative positions.

Option B: 8% scored in between. So if N is 100, 8 people. But the statement is 8% who took the test. So if N is, say, 200, 8% is 16. So if they're saying 8% of the test-takers scored between, that's correct only if N is 100. But the question doesn't specify N. So maybe option B is incorrect because it's a percentage.

Wait, but wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. Since the question is multiple-choice, and one of the options must be correct, I'll have to pick.

Let me check each option once again.

Option B: 8% of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary. So between 56th and 64th percentiles, so 8% of the test-takers. But without knowing N, this is a percentage, so option B's statement is not correct because it's an absolute number. So B is incorrect.

Wait, but another thought: the 64th percentile means 64% scored lower. So 100% - 64% = 36% scored higher than Mary. Similarly, 100% -56% =44% scored higher than Pam. So the difference between the two is 8% scored higher than Pam and 36% higher than Mary. Wait, but that's the same as the difference in their percentiles. So between Pam and Mary, 8% scored lower than Mary and 36% scored lower than Pam. So the number of people between them is 64% -56% =8% of the test-takers. So if N is 200, that's 16 people. But the option says 8% of all, which is 16. So if option B says 8% of the test-takers, then it's correct if N is 100. But the question doesn't specify. So unless the test has 100 points, that's not correct.

Hmm, but the question is about which statement is true. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, another approach: sometimes in percentiles, the number of people between two percentiles is the difference in their percentages. So Mary is at 64, Pam at 56, so 8 people between them. So if the test has 100 people, 8 would be correct. But the test could have more. So option B is not necessarily correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B, because the difference is 8 percentage points, and the relative positions are such that 8% of the test-takers scored between their ranks. But this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 64th percentile means 64% scored lower, so 36% scored higher. The 56th percentile means 56% scored lower, 44% scored higher. So the overlap between higher than Pam (44%) and lower than Mary (36%) is 36%. So 36% scored higher than both. So option I says 36% scored higher than both. So I is correct. But option B would say 8% of those who took the test scored between them. So 8% of N. Let me calculate, if N=100, 8% is 8 people. So if option B says 8% of the test-takers, that's correct. But the question doesn't specify N. So option B is incorrect because it's a percentage, not an absolute number.

Wait, but perhaps the question is assuming a 100-point scale, which is common. So if N=100, then 8% is 8 people, which is between them. So in that case, option B would be correct. Alternatively, the answer is option B.

Wait, but the option B says, "Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary." If the test has, say, N people, then the number is (64 -56)/100 * N = 0.08N, which is 8% of N. So if they're saying 8%, then that's correct only if N is 100. But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps the correct statement is option B, assuming N=100.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice question, so the correct answer must be one of the options. So looking back, let's think which options are correct.

Option B seems correct if N=100. Let me check other options.

Option I: Thirty-six people scored higher than both. So if N is 100, 36% is 36 people. But in reality, 36% of 100 is 36. So if N is 100, option I is correct. But the question doesn't specify N. So without that info, I can't know for sure. But maybe the answer is I.

Wait, but another approach: Mary is at 64th, which means 64% scored lower, so 36% scored higher. Pam is at 56th, so 44% scored higher. So the number of people who scored higher than Mary is 36% of N. Those who scored higher than Pam is 44% of N. So the number who scored higher than both is (64% -56%) =8% of N. So 8% of N is the number between them. So if N is 100, it's 8 people. So if the question's options are considering N=100, then option B and I would both be correct. But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me think about the options again. The question is to choose which statement is true. So let's consider each option.

Option B: 8% of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary. So if N is the total, then 8% of N is the number between them. So the statement says "8%" without any N. So perhaps it's incorrect because it's not an absolute number, but a percentage. So the option is incorrect because it's a percentage (8%) rather than an absolute number.

Wait, but wait: the first two statements (A to D) are about whether the scores are correct. Let me quickly check.

A: 36% scored lower than Pam. Pam is at 56th. So 56% scored lower. So A says 36%, which is incorrect.

C: Mary got 64% points. No, because her score is higher, not the percentile.

D: Mary 8 more points. No, percentiles don't imply absolute score differences.

E: Mary 8% higher. No, percentiles are about position, not actual scores.

F: Pam got 64 points. No, Pam is at 56th, so 56% scored lower.

G: 56 people scored lower than Mary. Mary is at 64th, so 64% scored lower. So 64% of N is 56. So N=56/0.64 = 87.5, which is about 88. So if N is 88, then 56 scored lower. But the question doesn't specify N, so option G is incorrect.

H: Mary is in the top 64th. Wait, no. The top percentiles are for the higher end. Mary is at 64th, so 64% scored below her. So she's not in the top 64th; she's in the top 36th. So option H is incorrect.

I: 36 people scored higher than both. If N=100, 36% is 36. But without knowing N, I can't say for sure. So option I could be correct.

J: Eight people scored higher than both. Again, depends on N, but if N=100, it's 36. So J is incorrect.

So among the options, the only option that makes sense is option B if N is 100. But the question doesn't specify N. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but another view: the number of people between them is 8 percentage points, but the actual number depends on N. So option B is correct only if N is 100, but the question doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the statement about 8% is correct only if the test has 100 participants. Because the 56th percentile means 56 scored lower than Pam, and 64th Mary. So the number between them is 8. So if the test had 100 people, the number between them would be 8. So option B would be correct if N=100. But since the question doesn't specify, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm now confused because multiple options might be correct, but the question requires choosing one. So which is correct? 

Let me think again: Mary is at 64th, so 64% scored lower than Mary. Pam is at 56th, so 56% scored lower than Pam. So the number who scored between them is 64 -56 =8% of the total. So, if the test has 100 people, 8 people are between them. So if the question says "8% of those who took the test scored between them", then option B is correct only in that context.

But the question's options don't specify N. So if someone says, "8% of those who took the test scored between Mary and Pam", that's correct only if N is 100. But the question doesn't say N is 100. So perhaps option B is incorrect because it's a percentage.

Wait, but another way: the 64th percentile is Mary, and the 56th is Pam. So the number of people who scored lower than Mary is 64% of N, and lower than Pam is 56%. So the number between them would be (64-56) =8% of N.

So if N is 100, 8 people. So option B says 8%, which is correct for N=100. But the option doesn't say N; it says 8% of those who took the test. So if N is 100, it's correct. But the question doesn't say N, so perhaps option B is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find the correct answer.

The correct answer is B. Because Mary is at 64th and Pam at 56th, so 8% of the test-takers scored between them. But the question doesn't specify N, so perhaps option B is correct only if N is 100, but that's not given. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B because it's the only one that makes sense after considering the percentiles.

So, to sum up, the correct answer is B.
</think>

The correct answer is option B: Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Mary is at the 64th percentile**, meaning 64% of the test-takers scored lower than her.
- **Pam is at the 56th percentile**, meaning 56% of the test-takers scored lower than him.
- The number of test-takers who scored between them is the difference between their percentiles: 64% - 56% = 8%.
- Therefore, if the test had 100 participants, 8 participants would score between Pam and Mary. However, the question does not specify the total number of participants, so option B is correct based on the reasoning that 8% of test-takers scored between them.

ANSWER: B
