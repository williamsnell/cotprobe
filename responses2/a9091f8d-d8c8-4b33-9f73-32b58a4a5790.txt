Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. Then there are five options (A to E) giving different combinations of whether each statement is True or False.

Statement 1: "A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian." Hmm, wait. A factor group, also known as a quotient group, is formed by dividing a group by a normal subgroup. So if the original group is non-Abelian, is its factor group necessarily non-Abelian?

I remember that being non-Abelian is not something that's necessarily preserved when taking factor groups. For example, consider the symmetric group S₃, which is non-Abelian. Its normal subgroups are A₃ (the alternating group) and {e} (the trivial group). 

Taking the factor group S₃ / A₃ would be isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, which is Abelian. So Statement 1 is False because there exists a non-Abelian group whose factor group is Abelian. So Statement 1 is False.

Statement 2: "If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G." Wait, that sounds familiar. I think this is about the transitivity of normality. If K is normal in H, and H is normal in G, does that mean K is normal in G?

Let me think. I recall that normality is transitive, meaning if K ≤ H ≤ G, and K is normal in H, and H is normal in G, then K is normal in G. So in that case, Statement 2 is True.

So now, looking at the options:

A: False, False → No because Statement 2 is True.
B: True, True → Yes, both are True.
C: Not Determinable, True → Not applicable.
D: Not Determinable, False → Not applicable.
E: True, False → No, Statement 1 is False.
F: False, Not Determinable → No.
G: True, Not Determinable → No.
H: Not Determinable, Not Determinable → No.
I: False, True → No, because Statement 1 is False.
J: Not Determinable, False → No.

So the correct answer should be B: True, True.

The analysis of the statements shows that Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is True. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

**Answer: B: True, True**
