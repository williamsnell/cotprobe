Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Aristotle and virtues. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking what the reference of each virtue term is fixed by. The options are A to J, each with different ideas. I remember that Aristotle had some nuances in his views on virtues and what they refer to.

From what I recall, Aristotle's philosophy was more about ethics based on human nature rather than abstract concepts like virtues. So, he didn't define virtues by their literal meanings. Instead, he thought about them more empirically, like the elements (earth, air, etc.), and how humans naturally engage with them.

So, the reference of a virtue term isn't fixed by something like a thick description, which would be option A. That doesn't make sense because Aristotle would mean a broad, abstract concept. Instead, it's more about grounding experiences. Grounding experiences are things a person comes into contact with in their life that naturally lead them to believe in a particular virtue. So, for example, seeing something that makes you feel good would ground the virtue of happiness.

Looking at the options, option G is grounding experiences. That fits with what I remember. It's not about personal interpretation or conventional use, which would be option I. Also, societal norms (option H) don't fit because Aristotle would consider it more personal and life-related rather than social.

Wait, let me make sure. Option F is practical experiences, which is similar to grounding. But is it the same or a different concept? I think grounding is more about the actual experiences that naturally lead to the belief in a virtue. Practical experiences might be more about actions, but they are still grounded in personal experiences.

Option E is a thin description, which would be another abstract concept. Aristotle didn't use thick, but rather, he talked about the elements and grounding experiences. So E doesn't fit either.

So, putting it all together, the reference of each virtue term is fixed by grounding experiences. That should be option G.

The reference of each virtue term is fixed by grounding experiences, which is option G.

Answer: G
