Alright, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the last few megafauna in Australia and America being wiped out. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the question is asking about factors that wiped out the last megafauna, which are big cats like the Australian outback marmots and the American ruminant species. So I'm thinking about the possible causes.

Option A says natural disasters like volcanic eruptions or earthquakes. I think that's not right. Volcanic eruptions can sometimes cause mass extinctions, but I think it's more about tectonic plate movements and maybe specific types of eruptions. Earthquakes might cause tsunamis or landslides, but I don't recall them being directly responsible for the extinction of these specific species. So A might not be correct.

Option B suggests both humans and environmental changes. That doesn't make sense. The question is about the megafauna being wiped out, not humans. Plus, environmental changes are more about the environment, but the extinction itself isn't caused by humans. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C talks about invasive plant species altering their habitat. Invasive species can change the environment, but eradicating entire species through that is more about habitat loss or maybe something else, not the direct cause of their extinction. So C is likely not the right answer.

Option D is a sudden drastic climate change due to global warming. I remember reading that the deglaciation period (like the Last Glacial Maximum) was a time when ice sheets melted, leading to a sharp drop in temperatures. This could have caused changes in species, like the extinction of some megafauna. But wait, I think that the extinction was more due to habitat changes and not just a sudden global warming. Also, I'm not sure if it's all about climate change.

Option E says humans who carried diseases over the land bridge. That makes sense in a way because diseases can spread. If humans were able to transmit diseases between species, that could have led to a sudden mass extinction. For example, diseases that spread between ruminants and marmots could kill off both. But I'm not too sure if this is the primary factor. Also, I remember that the extinction was more due to habitat changes, not diseases.

Option F is just "humans," which doesn't make sense as an answer because the question is about the megafauna being wiped out, not humans. So F is incorrect.

Option G is diseases transmitted by other animal species. That could be a possibility, but again, I'm not certain if this is the primary cause. I thought the main reason was habitat changes, like the loss of their habitats due to tectonic activity.

Option H is a comet or asteroid impact. I don't think comets or asteroids would be the cause of extinction. They can cause minor changes but not mass extinctions.

Option I is environmental changes. That's similar to option C. Environmental changes like deforestation, climate shifts, etc., can affect species. But I'm not sure if it's the primary factor for their extinction.

Option J is "humans." Again, same issue as F, because the question is about the megafauna being wiped out by humans, not the other way around.

Wait, let me think again. I remember that the extinction of Australian outback marmots and North American ruminants was primarily due to habitat loss and loss of certain species' habitats. This is because the Australian continent was losing its landmass, and the ruminants and marmots were adapted to the surrounding areas. Over time, these species lost their habitats, leading to their decline and eventual extinction. So the answer is probably C. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another thought: I read somewhere that this extinction was due to overgrazing and habitat destruction, which led to the loss of their adapted ecosystems. So maybe that's not directly an option here.

Wait, going back to the options. Let me check each one again. The correct answer is likely either C or D. Because D says both humans and environmental changes, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps C is the right answer. But wait, C is about invasive plants altering habitats, which could have led to the loss of their food sources. For example, if plants were invasive and their loss caused their food to be reduced, leading to their extinction.

Wait no, the correct answer might be C. Or D? I'm getting a bit tangled here. I think the extinction was primarily due to habitat loss and environmental changes, but the options don't have an option that combines both. So let me re-examine the options.

Wait, option D says "both humans and environmental changes." That doesn't fit because the question is about the megafauna being wiped out by humans and environmental changes. So probably D is incorrect.

Wait, another angle: the extinction was caused by the loss of their habitats, which included areas with certain plants. So the loss of plants could have led to the decline. But that's not one of the options. Hmmm.

Wait, I think the correct answer is C. Because the loss of habitats due to factors like tectonic activity, which led to their migration to new areas, could have made the land uninhabitable for them. Invasive plants might not directly lead to the extinction, but perhaps the habitat loss is more a factor. Alternatively, the correct answer is C, but I think I might be mixing up some points here.

Wait, another approach: I've heard that the Australian outback marmots were more vulnerable to diseases, which could have spread from the ruminants. But that's about disease transmission, which is option G. Or perhaps it's about the way their ecosystems were disrupted.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: the last megafauna were considered to be the Australian outback marmots and North American ruminants. I think the reasons were habitat loss and the loss of certain plants, like grasses, which these animals ate. So the loss of their habitats made them lose their adapted food sources, leading to their extinction. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the correct answer must be C, because the question is about the megafauna being wiped out by... Let me see: option C says the spread of invasive plant species which altered their habitat. So if plants were invasive, their loss would leave their food sources. But that's not directly one of the options. Alternatively, the correct answer could be C because the habitat loss is part of the environment-related factors.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the spread of invasive plants would affect their habitat, but the question is about the factors that wiped them out, which includes both.

Wait, I'm really not sure. Let me think of the options again.

The correct answer is C. Because the megafauna were adapted to their specific habitats. Over time, as their habitats changed, they were no longer viable. So the answer is that their habitats were altered by environmental factors, which is option C. So the correct answer is C.

The question asks about the factors that wiped out the last megafauna in Australia and North America. 

- **Option A**: Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are not primarily responsible for their extinction; they can cause mass extinctions but are not the main cause.
- **Option B**: Both humans and environmental changes are incorrect because humans did not cause the extinction of megafauna; it was the environment that played a role.
- **Option C**: Invasive plant species altering habitats could have indirectly affected their survival, but it is not the primary factor. The extinction was more due to habitat loss and environmental changes.
- **Option D**: Both humans and environmental changes are incorrect for the same reason as option B.
- **Option E**: Sudden drastic climate change due to global warming is not the primary cause, as the extinction was more due to habitat loss.
- **Option F**: Humans is incorrect because the question focuses on the extinction of megafauna, not humans.
- **Option G**: Diseases transmitted by other animal species could have spread between species, but this is not the primary cause.
- **Option H**: A comet or asteroid impact is not a likely cause of the extinction.
- **Option I**: Environmental changes are correct, but they are not the primary factor.
- **Option J**: Humans is incorrect for the same reason as option F.

The correct answer is **C**, as invasive plant species could have altered habitats, but the extinction was primarily due to habitat loss and environmental changes, which are not explicitly listed. However, based on the options provided, **C** is the closest correct choice.
