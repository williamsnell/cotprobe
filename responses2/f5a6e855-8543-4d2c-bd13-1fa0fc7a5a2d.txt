Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that the public wants to hold 15% of their total money balances as cash, and the rest in bank deposits. Bank deposits are held as reserves by the banks, and the banks' reserves are 12% of the deposits. We need to find out the total cash required for use by both the banks and the public for a total money supply of $200 billion.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the money multiplier concept is related to how money gets multiplied through the banking system. But wait, let me get the details right.

So, the public holds 15% of their money as cash. That means 85% is in deposits. Let me break it down: public cash = 15% of total money (so, 0.15 * total), and deposits = 85% of total (0.85 * total). 

The banks hold 12% of the deposits as reserves. So, the banks' reserves are 12% of deposits. Let me compute that: reserves = 0.12 * deposits. But deposits are 0.85 * total, so reserves = 0.12 * 0.85 * total.

Wait, but the money supply is the sum of the public's cash and the banks' deposits. Oh wait, no, because the public holds some in cash, and the banks hold some in deposits. The total money supply is the sum of the public's cash and the banks' deposits. But I think the money supply is determined by the monetary base, which is the sum of the public's cash and the banks' deposits. So, cash held by the public (C) plus deposits (D) equals the monetary base (MB). 

Wait, but the problem states that the total money supply is $200 billion. So, MB = 200 billion. But MB is also equal to the public's cash plus the banks' deposits. Wait, but the banks' reserves are part of the deposits, so MB is also the sum of public cash and the banks' deposits. Right, yes.

So, let me model this. Let me denote:

Total money supply (M) = 200 billion.

The public holds C = 0.15 * M = 0.15 * 200 = 30 billion. That's their cash.

Deposits D = M - C = 200 - 30 = 170 billion.

But wait, the banks hold 12% of deposits as reserves. So, reserves R = 0.12 * D = 0.12 * 170 = 20.4 billion.

But the money supply is composed of the public's cash and the banks' deposits. So, the banks have deposits which are their reserves plus the money they can actually lend out. But in this case, I think the money supply is the sum of the public's cash and the banks' deposits. So, the banks' deposits (which are their reserves plus loans) are part of the MB.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms here. Let me think again. The money supply is the total amount of money in circulation, which in this case is the public's cash plus the banks' deposits.

So, MB = C + D = 30 + 170 = 200 billion, which matches the total M.

But the question is asking for the total cash required for use by both the banks and the public. Wait, perhaps I misread that. Let me check the question again.

Wait, no, the question says "total amount of cash will be re-quired for use both by the banks and the public for a total money supply of $200 billion?"

Oh, perhaps I misunderstood. The total cash required refers to the sum of the money the banks need to hold in reserves plus the money they can lend, which is their deposits. Wait, but the money supply is the sum of public cash and the banks' deposits. So, the banks' deposits are equal to the money they can lend out, I think.

Wait, but in the money multiplier model, the money supply is determined by the monetary base (MB) multiplied by the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1/(1 - c), where c is the fraction of deposits held as reserves. So, in this case, c is 12%. So, the money multiplier would be 1/(1 - 0.12) = 1/0.88 ≈ 1.1364.

But wait, the question isn't about the money supply; it's about the total cash required. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the total cash needed is the cash that the banks need to hold in reserves plus the cash that the public holds. But no, the question says "the total amount of cash will be re-quired for use both by the banks and the public." Perhaps that's the sum of the money held by the public and the reserves held by the banks. But the problem is that when the public holds more cash, it's because the banks are required to keep less as reserves, thus requiring more cash from the public.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the cash that is held by the public and the cash that the banks are required to hold as reserves, but that's probably not directly relevant here. Maybe I should think in terms of the money multiplier.

Wait, the money multiplier formula is M = MB * (1/(1 - c)), where c is the reserve rate. So, MB is the monetary base, which is the sum of public cash and the banks' deposits. So, if the money supply is 200 billion, then MB = 200 billion / (1/(1 - c)) = 200 * (1 - c). Wait no, because M = MB * (1/(1 - c)), so MB = M * (1 - c). Wait, no, let me get that right. The formula is M = MB * (1/(1 - c)), so MB = M * (1 - c). So, M is 200, c is 0.12. So MB = 200 * (1 - 0.12) = 200 * 0.88 = 176 billion?

But wait, that's the monetary base. The public holds C = 15% of M = 200 * 0.15 = 30 billion, and the banks hold D = 200 - 30 = 170 billion.

But wait, the banks' deposits are D, which is 170 billion. The banks hold 12% of D as reserves, which is 20.4 billion. So, the banks must keep 20.4 billion as reserves, so the money available to the banks is D - reserves = 170 - 20.4 = 149.6 billion. But wait, that's the amount they can lend out. But the money supply is the sum of public cash and the banks' deposits, which I thought was 200 billion. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try again. The money supply (M) is the sum of the public's cash (C) and the banks' deposits (D). So, M = C + D. 

C = 0.15 * M → C = 0.15 * 200 = 30 billion.

D = M - C = 200 - 30 = 170 billion.

The banks hold 12% of D as reserves, which is 0.12 * 170 = 20.4 billion reserves.

But the question is asking about the total cash required by both the banks and the public. Wait, perhaps that's about the total money that's in the system, which is the same as M. But the question is phrased differently. Let me read again.

The question says: "What total amount of cash will be re-quired, for use both by the banks and the public, for a total money supply of $200 billion?"

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total cash that the banks and the public will use, which would be the sum of the money they have in cash plus their reserves, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the total money in the system, which is M, but that's 200 billion. But wait, the options don't have 200 billion as an answer, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the money multiplier. The money multiplier formula is M = MB * (1/(1 - c)), where c is the reserve rate. So, M is 200 billion, and c is 0.12.

So, 200 = MB * (1/(1 - 0.12)) → MB = 200 * (1 - 0.12) = 200 * 0.88 = 176 billion.

So, the monetary base is 176 billion. The public holds 15% of M, which is 30 billion. The banks hold 85% (D) of M, which is 170 billion, of which 12% is reserves (20.4 billion), so they have 170 - 20.4 = 149.6 billion in deposits that can be lent out. 

Wait, but the question is about the total cash required by both the banks and the public. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total reserve money that the banks must hold and the public must hold, which would be C + reserves. 

Wait, the problem is that when the public holds more cash, it's because the banks are required to keep less as reserves, thus requiring more cash from the public. So, the total reserve money is the sum of what the banks are required to keep and what the public holds. So, the total cash required would be that plus the public's cash? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total amount of money that the banks and the public are required to hold in cash, which would be the sum of the public's cash plus the banks' reserves. Because the public holds cash, and the banks hold a portion as reserves. 

Wait, perhaps the total cash required is the sum of what the banks are required to hold as reserves plus what the public holds as cash. So, that would be C + (MB - D), because D is the amount the banks have in deposits, and MB is the sum of public cash and the banks' deposits. So, MB = C + D → D = MB - C → MB = C + (MB - C) → which doesn't help. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this from the perspective of the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1/(1 - c). So, M = MB * (1/(1 - c)) → MB = M * (1 - c). 

Given M is 200 billion, c is 0.12.

MB = 200 * (1 - 0.12) = 200 * 0.88 = 176 billion.

So, the monetary base is 176 billion. The public holds C = 0.15 * M = 30 billion, and the banks hold D = 0.85 * M = 170 billion.

But the money supply is 200 billion, which is the sum of public cash and the banks' deposits. So, the banks' deposits are 170 billion, and their reserves are 20.4 billion. So the amount they can lend out is 149.6 billion, but that's not part of the money supply; it's the money they can create.

Wait, but the question is about the total cash required by both the banks and the public. Let me think about the total cash needed in the economy. The public holds 30 billion, and the banks hold 20.4 billion as reserves. So, the total cash (including reserves) held by the banks and the public is 30 + 20.4 = 50.4 billion. But wait, does that make sense?

Wait, but the banks need to hold their reserves, so perhaps the total cash required for use by both the banks and the public is the sum of the money they're holding in reserve plus the cash they're keeping. So, that would be 30 (public) + 20.4 (reserves) = 50.4 billion. But that's one of the options, option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem is about the total amount of cash re-quired, meaning the money that's in the system. Wait, the total money supply is 200 billion, so perhaps that's the answer. But none of the options say 200 billion. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, another approach. The public holds 15%, so cash is 30 billion. The banks hold deposits of 85% of M, which is 170 billion. But the banks must hold 12% of deposits as reserves, which is 20.4 billion. So, the total cash required (including what's in the banks' reserves) would be C (30) + reserves (20.4) = 50.4 billion. But that's option B, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total reserves that the banks have, plus the public's cash. That would be 20.4 + 30 = 50.4 billion. But that's option B. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total money that the banks and the public are required to hold, which would be the sum of the money they have in reserve and the cash they're keeping. So, public cash is 30, banks reserves are 20.4, so 50.4 billion. So that's option B.

But wait, another thought: the money multiplier says that the money supply is the monetary base multiplied by the money multiplier. So, M = MB * (1/(1 - c)). We found MB = 200 * 0.88 = 176 billion. But the question is about the total cash needed, not the money supply. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total amount of cash that the banks have in reserve plus the cash held by the public, which would be 15% + 12% of 85% of M. Wait, no, 15% is the public's cash, and the banks' reserves are 12% of 85% of M. So, 12% of 85% is 10.2%. So, 10.2% of 200 is 20.4. So, the total cash required is 30 (public) + 20.4 (reserves) = 50.4 billion, which is option B.

But wait, why is the public's cash included? Because the question says the total amount of cash will be re-quired for use both by the banks and the public. So, they're both using the cash. So, the public holds 30 billion, and the banks hold 20.4 billion as reserves. So the total cash required is 30 + 20.4 = 50.4 billion, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the money supply is 200 billion, which would be the sum of public cash and the banks' deposits. So why is the question about the total cash required?

Ah, perhaps because the banks' reserves are part of the money that's in the system, so the total cash needed is the sum of the public's cash and the reserves the banks are required to hold. So, 30 + 20.4 = 50.4 billion, which is option B.
</think>

The question involves calculating the total amount of cash required for use both by the banks and the public for a total money supply of $200 billion. The public holds 15% of the money balances as cash, and the banks hold 12% of the deposits as reserves. The money supply is the sum of the public's cash and the banks' deposits. Using the money multiplier concept, the monetary base (MB) is calculated as:

\[
MB = M \times (1 - c)
\]

where \( M = 200 \) billion and \( c = 0.12 \) (the reserve rate). Substituting the values:

\[
MB = 200 \times (1 - 0.12) = 200 \times 0.88 = 176 \text{ billion}
\]

The public holds 15% of the total money supply as cash:

\[
C = 0.15 \times 200 = 30 \text{ billion}
\]

The banks hold 85% of the total money supply as deposits:

\[
D = 0.85 \times 200 = 170 \text{ billion}
\]

The banks hold 12% of the deposits as reserves:

\[
\text{Reserves} = 0.12 \times 170 = 20.4 \text{ billion}
\]

The total cash required for use by both the banks and the public includes the public's cash and the reserves held by the banks:

\[
\text{Total Cash} = C + \text{Reserves} = 30 + 20.4 = 50.4 \text{ billion}
\]

Thus, the total amount of cash re-quired is **$50.4 billion**, which corresponds to option **B**.
