Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

If all the chemical components found in a living cell were to beput together in the right proportion, the mixture would not functionas living matter. What characteristics would enable usto consider something living?

Options:

A: Living things are characterized only by their complexity and organization, without the need for energy consumption or reproduction.
B: Living things are characterized by a specific, complex organization, the ability to consume energy, movement, response to physical or chemical changes, growth, reproduction, and adaptability.
C: Living things are characterized only by their growth.
D: Living things are characterized by their ability to maintain homeostasis, without the need for growth, reproduction, or adaptability.
E: Living things are characterized by their ability to evolve over generations but not by individual growth or energy consumption.
F: Living things are characterized by their ability to respond to changes and growth, but not by reproduction or energy consumption.
G: Living things are characterized only by their ability to consume energy.
H: Living things are characterized only by their movement.
I: Living things are characterized only by their adaptability to changes.
J: Living things are characterized only by their ability to reproduce.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this question about what enables something to be considered living. Let me read the question again.

The question says: If all the chemical components in a living cell were put together, the mixture wouldn't function as living matter. What characteristics would enable us to consider something living?

The options are A through J, each talking about different aspects of living things. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that living things have certain characteristics. Let me think about each option.

Option A: They're only about complexity and organization, not energy or reproduction. I don't think that's right because living things definitely need to function and grow, which implies some energy use.

Option B: They have a specific organization, can consume energy, move, respond to changes, grow, reproduce, and adapt. That sounds familiar. I remember something about homeostasis, which is maintaining a stable internal environment. That's a key feature of living things. Also, they can grow, reproduce, and adapt to their surroundings.

Option C: Only about growth. Well, some things do grow, but not all living things need to grow. Like plants, maybe. So this doesn't capture the essence.

Option D: Can maintain homeostasis without needing growth, reproduction, or adaptability. Wait, that doesn't seem right because if you can't do any of those, how would you maintain homeostasis? They probably need energy and growth to survive.

Option E: Can evolve over generations but don't grow or use energy. No, evolution is a change over time, not a static characteristic. Also, cells do use energy and grow, so this doesn't seem right.

Option F: Can respond to changes and grow, but not reproduction or energy. Wait, doesn't the question say 'all components' which implies they're all present. So F says they can respond and grow, but not reproduction or energy. No, because the question is about what's needed to be considered living, not about components.

Option G: Only ability to consume energy. That's too narrow. Many living things don't have energy to consume; they use energy to do growth and reproduction.

Option H: Only movement. No, movement isn't the only feature. Like, some organisms move, but others don't.

Option I: Only adaptability, no growth or energy. No, that's not right. Adaptability is key, but without growth or energy, they can't do much.

Option J: Only reproduction. Reproduction isn't exclusive to living things; many other forms of reproduction are possible too.

So, the correct answer is B. It talks about the specific organization, energy use, movement, responsiveness, growth, and reproduction. Those are all features that living things have.

The correct answer is **B: Living things are characterized by a specific, complex organization, the ability to consume energy, movement, response to physical or chemical changes, growth, reproduction, and adaptability.**

Living organisms possess several key characteristics, including:

- Specific organization and complexity.
- Capacity to consume energy.
- Movement and responsiveness to environmental changes.
- Growth and reproduction.
- Adaptability to changes in their surroundings.

ANSWER: B
