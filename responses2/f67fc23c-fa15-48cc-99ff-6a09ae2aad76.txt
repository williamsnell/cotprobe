Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the question is about days of the week in different years. I remember that the days of the week repeat every 7 days, so the calendar cycles every 7 years, but there can be exceptions like leap years. 

The problem states that in year N, the 300th day is a Tuesday. And in year N+1, the 200th day is also a Tuesday. We need to find out what day the 100th day of year N-1 was. 

First, let's break it down. The key is to figure out whether the transition between these years is a leap year or not. Because leap years have 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 days, they shift the day of the week by two. So, for example, if a leap year starts on a Monday, it would end on a Wednesday.

So, year N: 300th day is Tuesday. Let's find out what day of the week the year started on. Wait, but wait, maybe it's better to find the day of the week for the first day of the year N. Because the 300th day is a Tuesday. So, day 1 is the first day of the year. So, day 300 is 299 days later. Since 299 divided by 7 is 42*7=294, 299-294=5. So 5 days later from day 1. So, if day 300 is Tuesday, then day 1 is Tuesday minus 5 days. Wait, wait. Let's think again.

Wait, the 300th day is 299 days after the first day. So, 299 mod 7 is 299 ÷7 is 42*7 is 294, remainder 5. So, 5 days later. So, if day 1 is Monday (but wait, Monday is 1st, so day 1 is Monday). Wait no, the problem says Monday is the 1st day of the week. So, wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, the problem says Monday is the 1st day. So, day 1 is Monday. Then day 2 is Tuesday, day 3 Wednesday, etc. So, day 300 is the 300th day. To find what day that is, let's calculate (300-1) mod7. Because day 1 is 0, day 2 is 1, day 3 is 2, etc. So day 300 is 299 days later. 299 mod7= 299/7= 42*7=294, 299-294=5. So 5 days after Monday. Monday is 0, so day 2 is 1 (Tuesday), day 3 is 2 (Wednesday), day 4 is 3, day 5 is 4 (Thursday), day 6 is 5 (Friday), day 7 is 6 (Saturday), day 8 is 0 (Sunday), etc.

So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. So day 300 is a Saturday. Wait, but the problem says it's a Tuesday. So that's a contradiction. Hmm. That can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, day 1 is Monday, so day 300 is (300-1) days later. (300-1) =299. 299 mod7= 5. So day 300 is 5 days after Monday. Monday is 0, so 0+5=5 (Saturday). But the problem says it's a Tuesday. So that's conflicting. That suggests that my assumption about the starting day is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the modulo calculation. Let's calculate 299 divided by 7.

7 * 42 = 294. 299 -294=5. So 5 days. So 5 days beyond Monday: Monday (0), Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Saturday (5). So day 300 is Saturday. But the problem says it's Tuesday. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps the first day is not Monday. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says Monday is the 1st day of the week. So that's fixed. So the starting day is Monday, day 1 is Monday. So day 300 must be a Tuesday. But according to the calculation, it's Saturday. So that suggests that either the year is a leap year or not. Because if year N is a leap year, then the first day of the next year would shift by two days.

Wait, but the problem says year N's 300th day is Tuesday, and year N+1's 200th day is Tuesday. So perhaps we can find the day of the week for year N's first day, then find the relation to year N-1.

Let me try to model this.

Let me denote:

For year N, day 300 is Tuesday.

So, day 300 = Tuesday. So, day 1 is (Tuesday - 299 days) mod7.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, day 300 is 299 days after day 1.

So, 299 days is 42 weeks and 5 days. So, 5 days. So, day 300 is (day 1 +5) mod7. And that equals Tuesday.

So day 1 +5 ≡ Tuesday mod7.

But day 1 is Monday. So Monday +5 days is Saturday. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. But according to the problem, day 300 is Tuesday. So that's conflicting. So that suggests that the first day of year N is not Monday. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says Monday is the first day of the week. So day 1 is Monday. Therefore, day 300 is (Monday +5 days) = Saturday. But the problem says it's Tuesday. So this suggests that either the calculation is wrong, or my assumption about the starting day is incorrect. Or perhaps the years are not starting on Monday.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that year N is a leap year, so the first day of year N+1 is two days ahead. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think again.

We know that in year N, day 300 is Tuesday.

So, day 1 is Monday. So day 300 is (300-1) days later, which is 299 days. 299 mod7 is 5. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. But the problem says it's Tuesday. So discrepancy.

Wait, this suggests that my initial assumption about the starting day is wrong. So perhaps the first day is not Monday, but some other day. But the problem says Monday is the 1st day. So that can't be. So this suggests that perhaps the first day is Monday, but the calculation gives day 300 as Saturday, but the problem says it's Tuesday. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate 299 mod7.

7 into 299: 7*42=294, 299-294=5. So 5 mod7 is 5. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. So day 300 is Saturday. But the problem says it's Tuesday. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps the year N is a leap year, which would affect the day shift.

Wait, but year N's 300th day is Tuesday. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the first day is not Monday. Wait, the problem says Monday is the 1st day. So that's fixed.

Wait, maybe this suggests that the calculation I did is wrong. Or perhaps the problem is misstated. But given the problem, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to the second condition.

In year N+1, the 200th day is a Tuesday. So, let's denote that.

So, day 200 of year N+1 is Tuesday.

So, the first day of year N+1 is (day 1 of year N + number of days in year N) mod7. Let's denote day 1 of year N as D.

If year N is a leap year, it has 366 days. So, the first day of year N+1 is D + 366 mod7. 366 mod7 is 366 /7 is 52*7=364, 366-364=2. So 366 mod7 is 2. So first day of N+1 is D+2 mod7.

So, if year N has 366 days, then the first day of year N+1 is (D +2) mod7.

Wait, but let's find what D is, the first day of year N.

From the first condition, day 300 is Tuesday. So, day 300 is (300-1) days after D. So, 299 mod7 is 5. So, day 300 is (D +5) mod7. And this is Tuesday. But if D is Monday, then 5 days after Monday is Saturday, which isn't Tuesday. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the year N is not a leap year, so has 365 days. Then, 365 mod7 is 365/7=52*7=364, 365-364=1. So 365 mod7 is 1. So first day of N+1 is D +1 mod7.

But again, day 300 is Tuesday.

Wait, perhaps I should set up equations.

Let me denote:

Let D be the first day of year N, where Monday is day 1.

So, day 300: (D + 299) mod7 = Tuesday. Since Monday is 0, Tuesday is 1.

So, (D +299) mod7 =1.

But 299 mod7 is 5, so D +5 ≡1 mod7. So D ≡ (1-5) mod7 = (-4) mod7=3. So D is 3, which is Wednesday.

Wait, that's a problem because the problem says the first day of the week is Monday. So if D=3, which is Wednesday, that's not Monday. So this suggests that the first day of year N can't be Monday, but the problem states that day 1 is Monday.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my setup. Let me try again.

Wait, maybe I should model it as day 1 is Monday, and day 300 is Tuesday.

So, day 300 is (300-1)=299 days after Monday. 299 mod7 =5. So day 300 is (Monday +5) = Saturday. But the problem says it's Tuesday. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the starting day isn't Monday. But the problem says Monday is the 1st day, so that can't be. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but I'll proceed with the given information.

Wait, maybe I should not assume that, but try to proceed, and see if that leads to a contradiction or not.

Wait, perhaps the first day of year N is not Monday; perhaps the problem is that the first day could be some other day, but the problem says Monday is the 1st day.

So, perhaps the problem is that the initial setup is incorrect, and I need to find another way.

Wait, let me try to proceed with the second condition that day 200 of year N+1 is Tuesday.

Assuming the first day of N is D, and N is not a leap year (so 365 days), then the first day of N+1 is D+1 mod7.

Now, year N+1 has 365 days, so day 200 is (D+1) +199 days later. So, 199 mod7 is 199-14*14=199-196=3. So 3 days. So day 200 is (D+1+3) mod7 = (D+4) mod7.

And this is Tuesday, which is 1.

So, (D +4) ≡1 mod7.

So, D ≡ (1-4) mod7 = (-3) mod7=4. So D is 4, which is Thursday.

Wait, but earlier, from the first condition, I got D=3 (Wednesday). Now, from the second condition, D=4 (Thursday). That's a contradiction. So my initial assumption that N is not a leap year (so D=3) leads to D=4, which is impossible. So perhaps N is a leap year.

So, let's assume year N is a leap year (366 days). Then, the first day of N+1 is D +366 mod7. 366 mod7 is 2, as before. So first day of N+1 is (D+2) mod7.

Now, in year N+1, day 200 is Tuesday (1), so:

day 200 is (first day of N+1) + 199 days.

199 mod7=5. So day 200 is (D+2 +5) mod7 = (D+7) mod7 = D mod7.

And this equals 1.

So, D ≡1 mod7.

But earlier, from the first condition, we found that D=3 (Wednesday). So 3 ≡1? No. So that's a problem.

So, this suggests that the initial assumption is wrong. Hmm.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should instead try to model both conditions together, without assuming whether N is a leap year or not.

Wait, perhaps let me try to find D.

We have two conditions:

1) In year N, day 300 is Tuesday.

2) In year N+1, day 200 is Tuesday.

We can model both using the first day of each year.

Let me denote:

Let D_N be the first day of year N (Monday is 0, so D_N =0).

So, for year N:

day 300 is 300-1=299 days after D_N.

So, 299 mod7=5.

So, 300th day is (D_N +5 ) mod7 = Tuesday.

Since Monday is 0, Tuesday is 1.

So, D_N +5 ≡1 mod7. Thus, D_N ≡ (1-5) mod7 = (-4) ≡3 mod7. So D_N=3, which is Wednesday.

Now, for year N+1:

We have that day 200 is Tuesday.

Let D_{N+1} be the first day of N+1.

The number of days in year N+1 is 366 (if it's a leap year) or 365.

So, if year N is a leap year, then N+1 is not. Wait, wait, no, if N is a leap year, N+1 is not. So N has 366 days, N+1 has 365.

So, for N+1, first day is D_N + 366 mod7.

366 mod7 is 2, so D_{N+1} = (D_N +2) mod7.

Now, day 200 is 200-1=199 days after D_{N+1}.

199 mod7=199-28*7=199-196=3. So 199 mod7=3.

So day 200 is (D_{N+1} +3) mod7.

This equals Tuesday, which is 1.

So,

(D_{N+1} +3) ≡1 mod7.

But D_{N+1} = (D_N +2) mod7.

We already found D_N=3.

So D_{N+1} = (3 +2) mod7=5.

So,

5 +3=8 mod7=1. Which equals Tuesday. So that works.

Wait, so that's correct. So, D_N=3 (Wednesday), D_{N+1}=5 (Friday).

But earlier, from the first condition, D_N=3 (Wednesday), and from the second condition, D_{N+1}=5 (Friday). So, if N is a leap year, then N+1 is not, so N+1 has 365 days. So, let's see.

So, the first day of N is Wednesday (3), N+1 is Friday (5).

Now, we need to find the first day of year N-1.

So, year N is a leap year, so year N-1 is not a leap year, since leap years are every 4 years.

So, N-1 is not a leap year. So, the number of days in N-1 is 365.

So, first day of N-1 is D_{N-1} = D_N - 365 mod7.

365 mod7=1, so D_{N-1} = D_N -1 mod7.

Since D_N=3, D_{N-1}=3-1=2 mod7.

So, D_{N-1}=2, which is Tuesday.

Wait, but the problem asks for the day of the week for the 100th day of year N-1.

Wait, no, because the question is: What is the 100th day of year N-1? The options are 1-7.

Wait, but I think I'm getting the 100th day of N-1, but I think I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, no. The problem is to find the 100th day of year N-1. So, we need to find what day of the week the 100th day is, but according to the options, it's 1-7, which I think is the day of the week. So, the options are labeled A: Monday, B: Tuesday, etc.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says: What is the 100th day of year N-1? So, we need to find what day of the week that is, and map it to the options.

Wait, but according to the problem, the options are 1-7, which I think are the days of the week, like A is Monday, B is Tuesday, etc.

So, in my calculation, the first day of N-1 is D_{N-1}=2, which is Tuesday. So, the 100th day of N-1 is 99 days after the first day. So, 99 mod7=99-14*7=99-98=1. So, 1 day after Tuesday is Wednesday. So, 100th day is Wednesday, which is option B.

Wait, but the problem is to find the 100th day of N-1, so the options are 1-7, which I'm assuming are Monday to Sunday. So, the answer would be Wednesday, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

D_{N-1} is 2, which is Tuesday.

So, day 1: Tuesday.

Day 2: Wednesday.

Day 3: Thursday.

...

Day 100: 100-1=99 days after Tuesday.

99 mod7=1.

So, 1 day after Tuesday is Wednesday. So, day 100 is Wednesday.

So, the answer is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup.

So, let's recap:

We have:

1. Year N's 300th day is Tuesday.

2. Year N+1's 200th day is Tuesday.

We set up the first day of year N as D_N=3 (Wednesday), year N+1's first day as D_{N+1}=5 (Friday).

Now, year N-1 is not a leap year. So, it has 365 days.

So, the first day of N-1 is D_{N-1}= D_{N} - 365 mod7.

Wait, 365 mod7 is 1, so D_{N} -1 mod7.

Since D_N=3, D_{N-1}=(3-1)=2 mod7, which is Tuesday.

Now, the 100th day of N-1 is 99 days after the first day.

99 mod7=1.

So, day 100 is 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday.

So, the answer is Wednesday, which is option B.

Wait, but the problem says the options are 1 to 7, which I think are the days of the week, like A is Monday, B is Tuesday, etc. So, the correct answer is B.

So, the answer is B.

But wait, let me check again. Because I'm a bit confused about the day numbers. Let me make a table.

Let me assume that the first day is Monday (0), then day 1 is Monday, day 2 is Tuesday, etc.

So, day 1: 0 (Monday)

day 2: 1 (Tuesday)

...

day 300: (300-1) mod7=5 days after Monday, which is Saturday. But the problem says it's Tuesday, which is a contradiction.

So, this suggests that my initial assumption that the first day is Monday is wrong, which is conflicting with the problem statement. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the first day is Wednesday, because from the first condition, D_N=3 (Wednesday), and from the second condition, D_{N+1}=5 (Friday).

Wait, but that's also a problem because of the day shift.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating D_N.

Wait, let me re-calculate D_N.

In year N, day 300 is Tuesday.

So, day 300 is (D_N + 299) mod7 = Tuesday (1).

So, D_N +299 ≡1 mod7.

299 mod7=5.

So, D_N +5 =1 mod7.

So, D_N= (1-5) mod7= -4 mod7=3 mod7.

So, D_N=3.

Now, for year N+1, day 200 is Tuesday.

So, D_{N+1} + (200-1) mod7=2.

So, D_{N+1} +199 mod7=2.

199 mod7=5.

So, D_{N+1} +5=2 mod7.

So, D_{N+1}= (2-5) mod7= -3 mod7=4 mod7.

Now, since year N is a leap year, year N+1 has 365 days.

So, first day of N+1 is (D_N +366) mod7.

366 mod7=2.

So, D_{N+1}=(3+2) mod7=5 mod7=5.

But from above, D_{N+1}=4. So, 5 mod7=4? That can't be.

Wait, this suggests a contradiction, unless my initial assumption that year N is a leap year is wrong.

So, perhaps I should assume that year N is not a leap year, i.e., has 365 days.

Then, first day of N+1 is D_N + 365 mod7.

365 mod7=1.

So, D_{N+1}= D_N +1 mod7.

We have D_N=3, so D_{N+1}=4.

But from the second condition, D_{N+1} should be 4.

So, that's consistent.

So, this suggests that year N has 365 days, not a leap year.

So, this is the correct setup.

Thus, the first day of year N is Wednesday (D_N=3), and the first day of year N+1 is Friday (D_{N+1}=4).

Now, we need to find the 100th day of year N-1.

Since N is a year, and N-1 is the previous year.

We need to find what day of the week the 100th day is, and map that to the options.

So, first, we need to find the first day of year N-1.

Since N is not a leap year, year N-1 is not a leap year either.

So, the number of days in year N-1 is 365.

Thus, the first day of N-1 is D_{N-1} = D_N - 365 mod7.

365 mod7=1, so D_N -1 mod7=3-1=2 mod7=2.

So, D_{N-1}=2, which is Tuesday.

So, the first day of N-1 is Tuesday.

Now, the 100th day of N-1 is 99 days after the first day.

99 mod7=99-14*7=99-98=1.

So, 1 day after Tuesday is Wednesday.

So, the 100th day of N-1 is Wednesday.

So, the answer is option B.

So, the correct answer is B.
</think>

The 100th day of year N-1 is a Wednesday, which corresponds to option B.

ANSWER: B
