Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about utilitarianism and rights. Hmm, I remember that utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness or utility. The question is asking about what a utilitarian who recognizes rights would claim about the basis of rights by their utility.

Let me read the question again. It says: The last character of your answer must be the letter you have chosen. The options are A to J. So I have to pick one of those letters as the answer.

The question is about the basis of rights being justified by their utility. So the options are about how rights are explained in terms of utility. The options are about whether rights are only moral, only utility, or a combination.

I think the options are:

A: only moral rights; no utility.

B: all of the above.

C: no moral rights; only utility.

D: moral right is justified by the fact that recognition will diminish welfare.

E: justified by not contributing to maximization.

F: recognition won't diminish welfare.

G: recognition leads to maximization of individual welfare.

H: recognition leads to minimization.

I: no impact on welfare.

J: contributes to maximization.

So I remember that in utilitarianism, the idea is that the right to do something is one that, if granted, will maximize overall happiness. So, for an action to be a moral right, granting it would increase the total utility.

Wait, but some sources say that moral rights are justified by the fact that their recognition will not diminish overall welfare. Because if we take away the right, the total utility would decrease. So moral rights are those that, if granted, don't harm the overall welfare.

So looking at the options, let's see:

Option D says: the right is justified because its recognition will diminish welfare. Wait, that's the opposite of the standard utilitarian approach. Because if the right is a moral right, granting it should not harm the overall utility. So D would be wrong if that's the case.

Option F says: recognition won't diminish welfare. That fits with the idea of a moral right, which is justification by not causing harm.

Option J says: contributes to maximization. That also fits because if a right is a moral one, it contributes to maximizing welfare.

Option E says: justified by not contributing to maximization. That seems contradictory. Wait, no. If a right is a moral one, its recognition contributes to maximizing welfare. So E would be wrong because it says it's justified by not contributing. So E is incorrect.

Option J is about contributing to maximization, which is correct.

So let me reevaluate each option.

Option A: only moral rights, no utility. That doesn't make sense. Because if rights are only moral with no utility, how do we justify them? Utility is necessary to assess the right.

Option B: all of the above. Hmm, but I'm thinking that not all options are correct. For example, option D seems incorrect because it says recognition will decrease. So B can't be correct.

Option C: no moral rights; only utility. That implies that rights are based on utility, not moral. But that seems unlikely because the question is about rights recognized, so maybe some rights are moral and others are based on utility.

Option D: the right is justified by the fact that recognition will diminish welfare. Wait, if the right is a moral one, then granting it doesn't cause harm, so it's justified by not causing harm. So the right is justified by not causing harm, which is different from causing harm. So D's statement is incorrect. Because the right is justified by not causing harm, not by causing harm. So option D is wrong.

Option E: justified by not contributing to maximization. Wait, if the right is a moral one, its recognition contributes to maximization. So E is incorrect because it's saying the right is justified by not contributingâ€” that's the opposite. So E is wrong.

Option F: recognition won't diminish welfare. That seems correct because if the right is a moral one, it doesn't cause harm, so it won't diminish overall welfare. So F is correct.

Option J: recognition contributes to maximization. That's correct because a moral right is one that contributes to maximizing overall welfare.

So which options are correct? So the question is which of the options correctly describe the basis of rights justified by utility.

Looking at the options, the correct statements are F and J. Wait, but let me check the options again.

The question says: "a utilitarian who recognizes rights will attempt to explain rights on the basis of utility by claiming that".

So the options are about what the utilitarian would claim.

So options D and J and F are about what the right is justified by.

Wait, option D says the right is justified by the fact that its recognition will decrease welfare. That would mean that right is bad. So D is incorrect because the moral right is not justified by decreasing welfare.

Option J says its recognition contributes to maximization. That's correct.

Option F says recognition won't diminish welfare. That's correct.

So the correct answers would be F and J. But wait, the options are A to J, each as a single choice. So the question is which of the options (A to J) correctly describe the explanation. So which of the options are correct.

Wait, the question is presented as: 'a utilitarian who recognizes rights will attempt to explain rights on the basis of utility by claiming that'.

So the correct answers are options that state how the right is justified by the fact that its recognition will affect welfare.

Looking back, the options are about what the justification is:

- A: only moral; no utility. Incorrect, because without utility, how would you justify rights?

- B: all correct. I think not, because not all options are correct.

- C: no moral; only utility. That's not correct because the question is about rights, not just about whether rights exist.

- D: justification by decreasing welfare. That's the opposite of what a moral right should be. So D is incorrect.

- E: not contributing. No, because a moral right contributes.

- F: recognition won't decrease. Correct.

- G: leads to maximization of individual. That's a different consideration. It refers to individual welfare, while the question is about the total.

- H: leads to minimization. Also not relevant.

- I: no impact. Incorrect, same as F.

- J: contributes to maximization. Correct.

So the correct options are F and J. But the question is asking which of the options (A to J) is correct. Wait, each option is a possible answer.

Wait, no. The question says: "a utilitarian who recognizes rights will attempt to explain rights on the basis of utility by claiming that" and then gives options A to J, each as possible answers.

Wait, the question is phrased as: the option (A to J) is correct.

So the question is, which of the options (A to J) is the correct answer. So each option is a possible choice.

But the question is about what a utilitarian would claim about the basis of rights on the basis of utility.

So, for example, if someone is a moral right, they would say that their recognition will not cause harm, leading to maximization.

So the correct options would be F and J.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are: F, J.

Wait, but the options as presented are:

F: recognition won't diminish welfare.

J: recognition contributes to maximization.

So, the question is, which of these options correctly describe the situation.

Wait, the question is whether the utilitarian would claim that the right is justified by the fact that it will not cause harm (diminish overall welfare) or by the fact that it contributes to maximization.

If that's the case, then both F and J describe correct justifications.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

The options are A to J, each as a single possibility.

The question is which of the options (A to J) is correct. So the correct answer is the option that correctly describes how a utilitarian would justify a moral right.

Wait, but the question is, the option that the utilitarian would claim, not which statement is correct.

So, the question is: "the last character of your answer must be the letter you have chosen."

So, the options A to J are each a possible letter, but each is a possible explanation.

So, the question is, when a utilitarian recognizes rights, what does he claim about their justification by utility.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as: the options are all possible explanations, and we need to select the correct one.

So, for example, if the correct explanation is that the right is justified by not causing harm, then option F is correct.

But perhaps only one of the options is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is multiple, but the options are presented as A to F.

Wait, the options are A to J, each as a possible correct answer.

Wait, to clarify, the question is about what a utilitarian who recognizes rights would claim. So, the available options are whether the right is justified by utility.

So, the question is, the correct answer would be either F or J.

But the options are presented as a series of statements (A to J), each being an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is which of the options (A to J) is correct. So, for example, the correct answer is F and J, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are each a single letter. So each option is an explanation.

So, for example, option F is correct, option J is correct, etc.

But the question is: which of the options (A to J) is correct?

So, for example, the correct answer is F and J. But since the options are single letters, perhaps the correct answer includes both F and J, but the options don't allow that.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.

In utilitarianism, the concept of rights is tricky. Rights are often justified on the grounds that their recognition will not cause harm (diminishing overall welfare) or that they will contribute to the maximization of individual welfare.

Wait, actually, according to utilitarianism, the right to do a thing is justified if doing it would not cause harm. So, that would be option F.

Wait, but option F says: "a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will not diminish overall welfare." Yes, that's correct.

Option J says: "a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will contribute to the maximization of individual welfare." That's also correct because contributing to individual welfare is a goal of utilitarianism.

So both F and J are correct statements.

But the options are presented as single options, so perhaps the question is which of the options (A to J) is correct.

Wait, maybe the answer is both F and J, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the question is which of the options (A to J) is the correct explanation.

Wait, looking back, the question is phrased as: a utilitarian who recognizes rights will attempt to explain rights on the basis of utility by claiming that [something]. So the options are all possible correct claims.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both F and J, but each is a possible explanation. But the options given are single letters, each of which is a possible explanation.

Wait, maybe the question is only considering one of them. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: in utilitarianism, the moral rights are those that, if granted, will not cause harm. So their justification is that their recognition will not cause harm (diminish) and thus contribute to maximization.

So the correct options are F and J.

But looking at the options, the correct answer would be both F and J. But the options are presented as single letters, so perhaps the correct answer is F and J, but the question doesn't have an option that combines both.

Wait, reviewing the options, the options are A to J, each one a possible correct answer.

Wait, the question is: which option is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is both F and J, but each is presented as a possible option.

Wait, but that's not possible because each option is a single letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F and J, but the options don't have that. So maybe the question is which one is correct. Let me think about what each option says.

Looking again:

Options:

F: recognition won't diminish welfare.

J: recognition contributes to maximization.

So if a utilitarian is a moral right, they would say that it's justified by the fact that it won't cause harm (diminish welfare). So F is correct.

And J is also correct because it contributes to maximization, which is the goal of a utilitarian. So both F and J are correct.

But wait, the question is asking, which option is correct. So perhaps both F and J are correct, but the options are presented as individual letters.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering one of them, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J. Because the question is about justifying rights on the basis of utility, which relates to contributing to maximization.

Wait, but earlier I thought that moral rights are justified by not causing harm, which is option F.

Hmm.

Wait, according to the original question, the options are:

A: only moral; no utility.

B: all correct.

C: no moral; only utility.

D: right is justified by decreasing welfare.

E: right is justified by not contributing.

F: right won't diminish.

G: right leads to maximization of individual.

H: right leads to minimization.

I: no impact.

J: contributes.

So, back to the question: the correct answer is the one that correctly describes the justification.

The correct justifications would be F and J.

But the options are all letters, each a possible correct answer.

So the correct answer would be both F and J, but each is a separate option.

But since the question is presented as a multiple-choice with options A to J, each being a possible correct answer, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, perhaps only one of the options is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The question asks what the utilitarian would claim about the justification of rights by utility.

So, the correct answers would be F and J. But if the question is presented as a multiple-choice with each option being a possible correct answer, perhaps the correct answer is both, but that's not possible because each option is a single letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J, since it's about the contribution to maximization, which is more aligned with the utilitarian's goal. Alternatively, F is about not causing harm.

Wait, but both F and J are correct. So perhaps the question is allowing both F and J as correct, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J because it's about contributing to the maximization of individual welfare, which is the goal of a utilitarian.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what's the correct answer.

I remember that in utilitarianism, the moral rights are justified by the fact that granting them will not cause harm. So the correct answer would be F.

But earlier I thought that J is also correct because it's about contributing to maximization.

Wait, but in that case, both F and J are correct. But the question is asking which option (A to J) is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering one of them. So, for instance, the correct answer could be either F or J, but perhaps the intended answer is J. Alternatively, perhaps F is a correct explanation.

Wait, but the question is about the basis of rights by utility, which leads to the answer being F and J.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J because it's more about individual welfare, which is the goal of a utilitarian, whereas F is about not causing harm, which is also a utilitarian approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F and J, but the options don't allow that. So maybe the correct answer is both F and J.

But given that the options are presented as individual letters, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the options as each being a possible correct answer.

So, the question is: the last character of the answer must be the letter.

So, for example, if the correct answer is J, then the last letter is J.

If the correct answer is F, the last letter is F.

But the question is, which of the options (A to J) is correct. So, perhaps both F and J are correct, but each option is a separate choice.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the correct options.

In the question, the correct options for justification would be F and J. So, the correct answers are both F and J. But the question is phrased as a multiple-choice with options A to J, each as a possible correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F and J, but since each option is a single letter, we have to choose which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering F as the correct option because that's the one that directly relates to the utilitarian's approach of not causing harm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J because it's about contributing to max. So, the question is which of the options (A to J) correctly describes the basis.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, no, I think F is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is F and J, but the options don't have an option that combines both. So perhaps J is correct because it's about contribution to maximization, which is a key utilitarian concept.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, as it's about the individual welfare maximization, which is the focus of the question.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to conclude.

The correct answers would be F and J.

But the options are single letters. So, perhaps the question is looking for J as the correct answer.

Wait, no, because F is an important point as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, I think the correct answer is J. Because the question is about the basis of rights by utility, and in utilitarianism, the rights are justified by the fact that their recognition will contribute to the maximization of individual welfare.

So, option J is correct.

But earlier, I thought option F is correct. Now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a reliable source. For example, in ethics textbooks, the justification for moral rights is that their recognition won't cause harm, which is option F.

But I also remember that a utilitarian would justify the rights by their contribution to individual welfare, which is option J.

Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J, because that's about contribution to the max of individual welfare. Alternatively, F because it's about not causing harm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both F and J. But I don't see how the options can combine.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. So, I'll make a decision.

The correct answers are F and J. So the correct options are F and J.

But since the options are A to J, each is a possible correct answer, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Well, I think the correct answer is F and J, but since each is a single letter, perhaps the answer is J.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is J because that's about contributing to the maximization of individual welfare, which is the utilitarian's goal.

So, I'll go with option J as the correct answer.
</think>

The question asks which option correctly describes the justification of moral rights in a utilitarian framework. Utilitarians argue that moral rights are justified by the fact that their recognition will not cause harm (diminish overall welfare), which is captured in option F. Additionally, a utilitarian might justify their rights by their contribution to the maximization of individual welfare, as described in option J. However, based on the analysis, the correct answer is J, as it directly aligns with the utilitarian's goal of maximizing individual welfare.

ANSWER: J
