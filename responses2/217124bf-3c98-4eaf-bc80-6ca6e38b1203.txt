Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about velocities and spaceships. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that a spaceship is moving away from Earth at a velocity v₁ = 0.75c. Then, on this spaceship, a rocket is launched in the direction away from Earth, and the rocket's velocity relative to the spaceship is V₂ = 0.75c. The question is, what's the velocity of the rocket relative to Earth?

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities in special relativity, you can't just add them like you do in classical mechanics. Oh right, because velocities add differently when you're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. I think it's the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory of relativity.

The formula I remember is: 

u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u') / c²)

Where u is the velocity of the rocket relative to Earth, v is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth, and u' is the velocity of the rocket relative to the spaceship.

Wait, let me make sure I got the signs right. Since everything is moving away, all velocities are positive. So v is 0.75c, and u' is 0.75c as well.

Plugging the numbers in:

u = (0.75c + 0.75c) / (1 + (0.75c * 0.75c) / c² )

Simplify numerator: 1.5c.

Denominator: 1 + (0.5625c² / c²) → 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625.

So u = 1.5c / 1.5625.

Let me compute that. 1.5 divided by 1.5625. Hmm, 1.5 is the same as 3/2. 1.5625 is 25/16.

Wait, no, 1.5625 is 25/16? Let me check: 16 × 0.9765625 is 15.625, which is 25/16. Wait, no. Wait, 0.9765625 is 31/32? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me just do the division.

1.5 / 1.5625:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 16 to eliminate decimals. So 1.5 × 16 = 24, 1.5625 ×16=25.

So 24 /25 = 0.96.

So u = 0.96c.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.96c. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have mixed up the formula. Another way to think about it is that when you have two velocities in the same direction, the formula is (v + u')/(1 + (v u')/c²). So I think that part is correct.

Alternatively, another approach: In the spaceship's frame, the rocket's speed is 0.75c, so the Earth is approaching it at speed v =0.75c, and the rocket is moving away at 0.75c relative to the spaceship. So the Earth's frame would see the rocket moving faster than v.

Wait, when you add 0.75c (spaceship velocity) plus 0.75c (rocket's speed in spaceship) over 1 plus (0.75c * 0.75c)/c² → denominator 1 + (0.5625c²)/c² = 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625.

So 1.5c divided by 1.5625 is 0.96c. Yep, that matches what I did earlier.

So the correct answer should be H, 0.96c.

To determine the velocity of the rocket with respect to Earth, we use the velocity addition formula from special relativity:

\[
u = \frac{v + u'}{1 + \frac{v u'}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( v = 0.75c \) (velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth),
- \( u' = 0.75c \) (velocity of the rocket relative to the spaceship),
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

Substituting the values:

\[
u = \frac{0.75c + 0.75c}{1 + \frac{(0.75c)(0.75c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

- Numerator: \( 0.75c + 0.75c = 1.5c \),
- Denominator: \( 1 + \frac{0.5625c^2}{c^2} = 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625 \).

Thus:

\[
u = \frac{1.5c}{1.5625}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
u = \frac{1.5}{1.5625}c = 0.96c
\]

Therefore, the velocity of the rocket with respect to Earth is \( 0.96c \), which corresponds to option H.
