Okay, so I've got this economics question here about a bank's reserves. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question says the bank has $250,000 in deposits and $10,000 in excess reserves. The required reserve ratio is 20%. I need to find the actual reserves. 

Wait, I remember that reserves are divided into required reserves and excess reserves. Oh right, the formula is something like Required Reserves = Required Ratio * Total Deposits. Excess Reserves are the part that's not needed as reserves—so Actual Reserves would be the sum of required and excess.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think I got it mixed up. Oh, no, wait. Actually, the Actual Reserves would be the total deposits minus the excess reserves. Because, as per the concept, the bank keeps only the required portion as reserves, and the rest is kept as excess. So the Actual Reserves = Total Deposits - Excess Reserves. Oh wait, so that would be 250,000 - 10,000. Let me compute that. 

250,000 minus 10,000 is 240,000? Wait, but wait. Or is the Actual Reserves equal to Required Reserves plus Excess Reserves? Because Actual Reserves are the total that the bank actually holds. So if the required is 20%, then required reserves are 20% of 250k, which is 50k. So Actual Reserves would be 50k + 10k = 60k. Oh, so that's $60,000. Looking at the options, option H is $60,000. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: Actual Reserves = Total Deposits - Excess Reserves. So 250k - 10k is 240k. But that's the total reserves. Wait, no, I think that's the total reserves. Wait, no—no, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, no. Oh wait, no: The bank doesn't keep all the deposits as reserves. It keeps only the required amount as reserves. So the Actual Reserves are the required plus the excess. Or alternatively, Actual Reserves = Total Reserves, which is deposits minus excess. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between required and Actual.

Wait, required reserves are the amount the bank is required to keep. So Actual reserves would be the required plus the excess. So, required is 20% of 250k, which is 50k. So actual reserves would be 50k + 10k = 60k. So the answer should be H, $60,000. 

Wait, but another way: the bank's total reserves are the sum of required and excess. Because required are the reserves they have to hold, and excess are the extra they have beyond that. So yes, 50k +10k is 60k. So the answer is H. So looking at the options, H is $60,000.

The correct answer is H: $60,000. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The bank has $250,000 in deposits.
2. The required reserve ratio is 20%, so the required reserves are 20% of $250,000, which is $50,000.
3. The bank has $10,000 in excess reserves.
4. Actual reserves are the sum of required and excess reserves: $50,000 + $10,000 = $60,000.

Thus, the bank's actual reserves are $60,000. 

Answer: H
