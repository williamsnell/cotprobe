Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cointegration, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about cointegration.

Cointegration is a statistical property of time series variables which implies that a linear combination of them is stationary, even if the individual series are non-stationary. So, if x_t and y_t are cointegrated, it means that there's a long-term equilibrium relationship between them. 

The question is about which statements (i to iv) are true. Let me look at each one.

i) x_t and y_t must both be stationary. Hmm. I remember that cointegration doesn't necessarily require each variable to be individually stationary. For example, two random walks (like geometric Brownian motion) are non-stationary, but their difference is stationary. So, it's possible for both to be non-stationary but their combination to be stationary. So, statement i is false.

ii) Only one linear combination of x_t and y_t is stationary. Wait, no. Cointegration implies that there are multiple such linear combinations that are stationary. Like, if a and b are constants, then a x_t + b y_t is stationary. So, if you have two variables, there are multiple cointegrating relationships. So, statement ii is false because it says only one exists. 

iii) The cointegrating equation describes the short-run relationship. Right, because cointegration often involves a long-term equilibrium (the cointegrating equation) which captures the steady-state or long-run relationship. So, this statement is true.

iv) The residuals of a regression of y_t on x_t must be stationary. Wait, when we run a regression to find the cointegrating equation, the residuals would be stationary if the model is correctly specified. Because the cointegrating equation would imply that the residuals are stationary. So, statement iv is true.

So, the true statements are iii and iv. Looking at the options, which combination includes iii and iv?

Looking at the options:

Option B is (iii) and (iv) only.

Option A is (i) and (iv) only.

No, wait, the options are:

A: (i) and (iv) only

B: (iii) and (iv) only

C: (i) and (iii) only

D: (ii) and (iv) only

E: (i), (iii), and (iv) only

F: (i), (ii), and (iii) only

G: (ii) and (iii) only

H: (i) and (ii) only

I: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only

J: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)

Wait, so the true statements are iii and iv. So the correct option is B: (iii) and (iv) only.

Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each point again.

i) is false because both don't have to be stationary. They can be non-stationary but their difference is.

ii) is false because cointegration allows for multiple cointegrating relationships. So only one is not correct.

iii) Correct, cointegrating equation is about the long-run relationship.

iv) Correct, the residuals are stationary.

So the correct answer is B.

The question pertains to cointegration and evaluates the validity of four statements. Here's the breakdown:

1. **i) Both $x_t$ and $y_t$ must be stationary**:  
   This is false. Cointegration allows both variables to be non-stationary, but their linear combination is stationary. An example is two random walks, which are individually non-stationary but their difference is stationary.

2. **ii) Only one linear combination is stationary**:  
   This is false. Cointegration implies the existence of multiple linear combinations that are stationary, reflecting the long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables.

3. **iii) The cointegrating equation describes the short-run relationship**:  
   This is true. The cointegrating equation captures the steady-state or long-run relationship between the variables.

4. **iv) The residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ must be stationary**:  
   This is true. When estimating the cointegrating equation, the residuals from the regression are stationary, indicating the presence of a stable long-run relationship.

The correct answer combines **iii** and **iv**, which corresponds to **Option B: (iii) and (iv) only**.

ANSWER: B
