Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the potential energy of a spherical conductor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me think this through.

The question says the conductor is isolated and spherical with radius R, carrying a surface charge density sigma. I need to find the potential energy in terms of R. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, what's the formula for potential energy of a charged conductor? I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the energy stored due to their electrostatic interactions. For a spherical conductor with charge, the potential energy is related to the electric field and the charge distribution.

Oh right, the potential energy (U) can be calculated using the formula U = (1/(2ε₀)) times the integral of E dot dA over the volume. But wait, that might not be the most straightforward approach. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, for a conductor, the electric field inside is zero, and outside it's like that of a point charge. But wait, no, that's not correct. The external field depends on the charge and the radius, but the conductor's surface charge. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy of a spherical charge distribution can be found using U = (1/(2ε₀)) ∫ E² dV. Alternatively, for a point charge, the potential energy is (Q²)/(8πε₀ R). But wait, is that correct?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this step by step. Let's consider the conductor as a spherical shell with charge Q. Because it's isolated, the charge is on the surface.

The surface charge density σ is Q/(4πR²), since σ = Q/(4πR²) for a sphere. But wait, the problem says the surface charge density is σ, so the total charge Q would be σ * 4π R².

Wait, but maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think about potential energy. For a spherical shell with charge Q, the electric potential at the surface is (k Q)/(R), where k is Coulomb's constant, 1/(4πε₀). But what's the potential energy?

Wait, the potential energy of a system is the work done to assemble the charges. For a spherical shell, the charge comes from bringing charges from infinity, each time doing work. The potential energy for a shell is (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R). Oh wait, is that correct?

Wait, another approach. The electric potential energy of a spherical conductor can be calculated using the formula U = (1/(2ε₀)) ∫ E² dV. But since for a spherical shell, E outside is like that of a point charge at the center, and E inside is zero.

Wait, the potential energy of a spherical shell is given by U = (1/(2ε₀)) * (4πε₀ Q²)/(2R) )? I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

The electric field outside a spherical shell of charge Q is E = k Q / r². The potential at a point outside would be V = k Q / r. The potential energy of a small charge dq is dq * V, but wait, for a system, it's the integral of the work done to bring each charge into place. Alternatively, the potential energy U is (1/2) the integral of E · dE, but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of a charge distribution is given by U = (1/(2ε₀)) ∫ E² dV. Let's compute that for a spherical shell.

For a spherical shell of radius R, the electric field outside is E = k Q / r². The potential energy U would be the integral from r=R to infinity of E times the volume element.

Wait, but for a spherical shell, the potential energy is (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R). Let me see, because for a point charge, U is (1/(2ε₀)) (Q^2)/(R) ), but wait, no, the potential energy for a point charge is (1/(2ε₀)) (Q^2)/(R) ) * (R^2)/(R^3) ) or something. Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up.

Alternatively, the formula for the potential energy U of a spherical shell with charge Q is U = (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R). Let me check the units: Q is in coulombs, ε₀ in C²/(N·m²), R in meters. So (Q²)/(ε₀ R) would have units of (C²) / (N·m² * m) ) = C²/(N m³). But potential energy is in joules, which is kg·m²/s². Let me see: Coulomb's constant k is 1/(4πε₀), and k Q²/(2 R) is in joules? Let me calculate:

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So k Q²/(2 R) has units (N·m²/C²)(C²)/(m) ) = N·m²/m = N·m. N is kg·m/s². So N·m is kg·m²/s², which is joules. Oh wait, so the formula U = (1/(2ε₀)) ∫ E² dV would give (1/(2ε₀)) * (4πε₀ Q²/(2 R)) ) ?

Wait, let's compute that. (1/(2ε₀)) * (4 π ε₀ Q²/(2 R)) ) = (4 π ε₀ Q² ) / (4 ε₀ R) ) = (π Q²)/(R). That can't be right because the unit would be kg·m²/s², which is joules. So maybe my initial formula is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the potential energy differently. The potential energy for a spherical shell is (1/2) the work done to assemble it. The work to bring a charge dq from infinity to the shell's surface is dq * V, where V is the electric potential at each point. The potential at a point on the shell is k Q/(R), because it's a spherical shell. So the potential energy U is the integral from all the charges brought in from infinity.

Wait, but since the charge is uniformly distributed on the shell, let's model it as integrating from r = R to r = infinity. The potential energy dU is dQ * V(r) * (4π R² dr), since each dq contributes to the potential energy as dq * (k Q / R) ). Wait, but I'm not sure if the potential is uniform on the shell. For a spherical shell, yes, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface, which is k Q / R.

Wait, so the potential energy U is the integral from r = 0 to r = infinity of the work done to bring a charge dr from infinity to the shell at radius R. So, the work done is (1/2) ∫ (k dq * q) / R, because the potential energy is (1/2) ∫ E² dV, but I'm getting a bit mixed up again.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is (1/2) ∫ E · E dV. Since E is spherically symmetric, E is the same at each point on the shell, and E is k Q / R outside.

Wait, but the potential energy is more accurately given by U = (1/2) ∫ E(r) * rho(r) dV, where rho is the charge density. Since rho is uniform on the shell, rho = Q/(4 π R²). And E(r) is k Q / R for r > R, and zero inside.

So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ (k Q / R) * (Q/(4 π R²)) ) * 4 π R² dR (from R to infinity). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think about the integral.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy U is (1/2) ∫ E^2 dV. But E is zero inside, and is k Q / r² outside. So the integral is from r=R to infinity of (k Q / r²)^2 * 4 π r² dr. Because E is spherically symmetric, dV is 4 π r² dr.

So U = (1/2) ∫ (k² Q² / r^4) * 4 π r² dr) from R to ∞.

Simplify the integrand: (k² Q² * 4 π) / r² * (1/2) ) → (k² Q² 4 π) * (1/2) ∫ (1/r²) dr from R to ∞.

Wait, let's compute the integral: ∫ (1/r²) dr from R to ∞ is [ -1/r ] from R to ∞ → (0 - (-1/R)) = 1/R.

So U = (k² Q² 4 π) * (1/2) * (1/R) ) → (k² Q² 4 π) / (2 R) ) * (1/2) ?

Wait, no, the (1/2) came from the (1/2) in U = (1/2) ∫ E² dV.

Wait, let me recompute:

U = (1/2) ∫ E² dV.

E² = (k² Q² / r^4).

dV =4 π r² dr.

So U = (1/2) * 4 π ∫ (k² Q² / r^4) r² dr from R to infinity.

Simplify the integrand: (k² Q² * 4 π) * ∫ (r² / r^4) dr → (4 π k² Q²) ∫ (1/r²) dr.

Which is (4 π k² Q²) [ -1/r ] from R to ∞ → (4 π k² Q²) (1/R).

So U = (1/2) * 4 π k² Q² (1/R) ) → (2 π k² Q² ) / R.

But wait, what is k in terms of ε₀? k = 1/(4 π ε₀). So plugging that in:

U = (2 π (1/(4 π ε₀))² Q² ) / R.

Compute (1/(4 π ε₀))² → 1/(16 π² ε₀²).

So U = (2 π * (1/(16 π² ε₀² )) Q² ) / R → (2 π) / (16 π² ε₀²) * Q² / R.

Simplify 2/(16) → 1/8. So:

U = (1/(8 π ε₀² )) * Q² / R.

Hmm, that doesn't match any of the options. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, option C is Q/(8 π ε₀ R), option G is Q²/(2 π ε₀ R), option F is Q³/(8 π ε₀ R^2), option D is Q²/(16 π ε₀ R), and option I is Q²/(8 π ε₀ R).

Wait, wait, I have U = (1/(8 π ε₀² )) * (Q²)/R.

But none of the options have ε squared in the denominator. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternative approach: I remember that the potential energy of a uniformly charged spherical shell is U = (1/(2 ε₀)) (Q²)/(2 R) ). Wait, that would be (Q²)/(4 ε₀ R). But looking at the options, option E is Q²/(4 π ε₀ R²), option J is Q^3/(8 π ε₀ R^2), option A is Q^2/(16 π ε₀ R), option B is 2Q^2/(8 π ε₀ R), option C is Q/(8 π ε₀ R), etc.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of another formula. Oh wait, another thought: the electric field outside a spherical shell is E = (k Q)/r². The potential energy U is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to the shell. The potential energy is the integral of E dr multiplied by charge dq. Wait, but for a spherical shell, each dq contributes to the potential at the shell's surface, which is E * Q, but that's perhaps not correct.

Wait, the potential energy for each infinitesimal charge dq on the shell is dq * V, where V is the potential at the shell's surface. The potential V is k Q / R.

So the potential energy U is the integral of dq * V from 0 to R (since the charge is on a shell). So U = V * ∫ dq.

But ∫ dq is Q, so U = Q * (k Q / R) ) = k Q² / R.

But k is 1/(4 π ε₀), so U = Q²/(4 π ε₀ R).

But looking at the options, option A is Q²/(16 π ε₀ R), option C is Q/(8 π ε₀ R), etc. None of them match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral. Let me reevaluate the approach. The potential energy is the work done to assemble the charges. The work to bring a charge dq from infinity to the shell is dq multiplied by the potential at that point, which is k Q / R.

But since the charges are uniformly distributed, the initial potential is zero, and the final is k Q / R. So the potential energy U is the sum of dq * (k Q / R). But the total charge is Q, so U = (k Q / R) * Q = k Q² / R.

Again, k = 1/(4 π ε₀), so U = Q²/(4 π ε₀ R).

But the options don't have 4 π in the denominator. Let me look again:

Option A: Q²/(16 π ε₀ R)

Option G: Q²/(2 π ε₀ R)

Option I: Q²/(8 π ε₀ R)

Hmm, my result is Q²/(4 π ε₀ R), which is not an option. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of a spherical shell can also be found using the formula U = (1/2) Q^2/(R ε₀). Let me plug in numbers:

If Q is 2 C, R is 1 m, then U would be (1/2)*(4)/(1 * 8.85e-12) ≈ (2)/(8.85e-12) ≈ 2.25e11 J, but that's probably not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential energy of a capacitor. A spherical capacitor has potential energy U = (Q²)/(8 ε₀ R). Wait, that's one of the options. Option F is Q^3/(8... no, option F is Q^3/(8 π ε₀ R^2). Option G is Q²/(2 π ε₀ R). Option F's denominator includes R^2, which is different.

Wait, another formula I recall: The potential energy of a uniformly charged spherical shell is U = (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R). Is that correct? Let me see:

If the formula is U = (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R), then that matches option G? No, option G is Q²/(2 π ε₀ R). Wait, no, option G is Q²/(2 π ε₀ R), option F is Q^3/(8 π ε₀ R^2), option I is Q²/(8 π ε₀ R).

Wait, let me think: the potential energy of a spherical shell is given by U = (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R). So that would be option G (Q²/(2 π ε₀ R)) no, no, option G is Q²/(2 π ε₀ R). So wait, no, option G is Q²/(2 π ε₀ R), option I is Q²/(8 π ε₀ R). So I have U = Q²/(8 π ε₀ R), which matches option I. So I think I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, but where did I go wrong earlier? Earlier, I calculated U as Q²/(4 π ε₀ R), which is half of option I's value. So perhaps that approach was wrong.

Wait, let's try this again. The correct formula for the potential energy of a spherical shell is U = (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R).

But how did I get that earlier? Let me think.

Wait, another way: the electric potential energy of a spherical shell is U = (1/2) * (Q^2) / (8 π ε₀ R). Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe it's U = (1/2) (Q^2) (something) / R.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the work done in assembling the shell. The work done is the integral from r = R to infinity of k Q² / r² dr. Wait, but the correct integral is (1/2) ∫ (k Q / r² )^2 * 4 π r² dr.

Wait, let me compute that again. E is k Q / r². The energy is (1/2) ∫ E^2 dV. E^2 is (k² Q² ) / r^4. dV is 4 π r² dr. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ (k² Q² / r^4 ) * 4 π r² dr. Simplify the integrand:

(4 π k² Q²) * (1/r^2) dr.

The integral becomes 4 π k² Q² ∫ (1/r^2) dr → 4 π k² Q² * (1/r) evaluated from R to infinity.

At infinity, 1/r is zero. At R, it's 1/R. So the integral is 4 π k² Q² * (1/R) → 4 π k² Q² / R.

But k is 1/(4 π ε₀), so k² is 1/(16 π² ε₀²).

So substituting back in: 4 π * (1/(16 π² ε₀²)) ) * Q² / R → (4 π) / (16 π² ε₀²) ) * Q² / R → (1) / (4 π ε₀²) ) * Q² / R.

So U = (Q²) / (4 π ε₀² R).

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the formula for the potential energy of a spherical shell again.

Upon a quick recall, the potential energy (U) of a spherical shell of charge Q and radius R is U = (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R) . So that's option I. But earlier calculations didn't reach that.

Wait, perhaps my mistake was in the approach. Let me think about the situation again.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the potential energy of a uniformly charged spherical shell is U = (1/2) (Q^2)/(8 π ε₀ R). Hmm, but that would be U = Q²/(16 π ε₀ R), which matches option A.

But earlier, I found that my method gave U = (Q²) / (4 π ε₀² R), which is different. So perhaps I messed up in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should make a mistake in one of the assumptions. Let me think again: the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charges.

The first charge doesn't do work because it's at infinity. The second charge is brought from infinity to the first charge's location, doing work against the electric field. The potential energy for each charge dq when brought into position is dq * V, where V is the potential at that point.

So let's model this. The shell has radius R. The first charge dq (let's say it's at the center) is brought into position. The potential at the center is k Q / R, so the work done to bring it in is dq * (k Q / R ).

Similarly, when bringing in the next charge, it's at radius R, so the potential is the same, but now integrating over the entire charge distribution.

But the total work is the integral from r = R to infinity of (k Q / r²) * (4 π r² dr) ) * (dq).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the potential energy for each charge. The first charge dq0 doesn't contribute to U because it's at infinity. The second charge dq1 is brought from infinity to the position where dq0 is located. The potential at dq0's location is k (Q - dq1) / R.

Wait, but this approach might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the correct formula for the potential energy of a spherical shell. Let me think of the formula from a textbook. In a textbook, the potential energy of a spherical shell is given by U = (1/2) (Q^2) / (8 π ε₀ R). So that would be (Q²)/(16 π ε₀ R ), which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the potential energy is (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let's try this again: the potential energy U is the work done to assemble the shell. The potential at the shell's surface is kQ/R. So each charge dq contributes dq * (kQ/R) to the potential energy. But since all the charges are arranged on the surface, the total potential energy is the sum of dq * (kQ/R) for all dq.

Wait, but the sum of all dq is Q, so the total potential energy is Q*(kQ/R) ) = k Q² / R. But k is 1/(4 π ε₀), so U = Q²/(4 π ε₀ R ).

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, another thought: The potential energy of a spherical shell is U = (1/2) (Q^2) / (8 π ε₀ R). Because for a spherical shell, each charge contributes to the potential energy, but the work done is the integral of E * dq, which might only account for half the potential. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, the correct formula for the potential energy of a spherical shell is U = (Q^2)/(8 π ε₀ R). So according to that, the correct answer is option I: Q²/(8 π ε₀ R). But earlier calculations gave me U = Q²/(4 π ε₀ R ). Which is double option I.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find the correct formula. Let me think:

The potential energy U of a spherical shell is given by U = (Q^2)/(8 π ε₀ R). So the correct option would be option I: Q^2/(8 π ε₀ R).

Wait, but let me think about the units again. The correct formula for potential energy should be U = (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R ). Because ε₀ has units of C²/(N·m²), so 1/(8 π ε₀) has units of N·m²/(C²).

So U has units (N·m²/C²) * (1/R) → N·m²/(C² R) → (kg·m/s²)·(m²)/(kg·m²/s² * m) → kg·m²/(s²·m) → kg·m/s² → J. So units are correct.

But according to this, the correct answer would be option I: Q^2/(8 π ε₀ R). So why did I earlier get a different result?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral approach. Let me compute it again.

The potential energy U is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to the sphere. The work done for the first charge is zero because it's at infinity. The work done for the second charge is dq * V, where V is the potential at that point. The potential at the second charge's position is k (Q - dq) / R. Wait, but that's varying with dq, which complicates things.

Alternatively, let me think about the potential energy as the sum of all the interactions between pairs of charges. For a uniformly charged shell, the potential energy would be the sum of all pairs of charges. Each charge interacts with every other charge once.

But that approach would be quite involved. Alternatively, considering the formula for the electric dipole moment. Wait, but the potential energy is U = (1/2) p E, but that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the potential energy of a spherical shell is U = (1/2) (Q^2)/(8 π ε₀ R). So that would lead me to option I: Q²/(8 π ε₀ R).

But earlier, when I thought the potential energy was (Q^2)/(4 π ε₀ R ), which is double option I, that would imply the correct answer is option I. But if I'm correct, that's the case.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me try to find a correct formula.

After a quick search in my memory, the correct formula for the potential energy of a spherical shell is U = (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R ). So the correct option should be option I: Q²/(8 π ε₀ R ).

So the answer is option I.
</think>

To determine the potential energy of an isolated spherical conductor with charge \( Q \) and radius \( R \), we analyze the problem using the correct formula for the potential energy of a spherical shell. The potential energy \( U \) of a spherical shell is given by:

\[
U = \frac{Q^2}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0 R}
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Correct Formula**: The potential energy of a spherical shell is \( U = \frac{Q^2}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0 R} \). This formula accounts for the interaction between charges on the shell and the potential energy associated with their arrangement.

2. **Options Review**:
   - **Option G**: \( \frac{Q^2}{2 \pi \varepsilon_0 R} \) — This is incorrect because it does not match the derived formula.
   - **Option F**: \( \frac{Q^3}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0 R^2} \) — This is incorrect as it introduces an extra power of \( Q \) and incorrect powers of \( R \).
   - **Option I**: \( \frac{Q^2}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0 R} \) — This matches the correct formula.
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{Q^2}{16 \pi \varepsilon_0 R} \) — This is incorrect as it underestimates the potential energy.
   - **Option B**: \( \frac{2Q^2}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0 R} \) — This simplifies to \( \frac{Q^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 R} \), which does not match the correct formula.
   - **Option C**: \( \frac{Q}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0 R} \) — This is incorrect as it introduces an extra power of \( Q \).

3. **Conclusion**: The correct potential energy of the spherical conductor is given by \( \frac{Q^2}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0 R} \), which corresponds to **Option I**.
