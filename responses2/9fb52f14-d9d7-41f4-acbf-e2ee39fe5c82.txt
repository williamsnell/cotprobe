Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about why filibusters are less likely in the House of Representatives than in the Senate. Let me go through the options one by one.

The question states that the last character of the answer has to be the chosen option letter. So whatever I think, I have to make sure the letter matches.

Option A: The House has fewer members than the Senate. Hmm, I remember that the U.S. House has 100 members and the Senate has 100 as well. So same number. So A is probably not correct because the number of members is the same.

Option B: House members are less politically diverse than the Senate. Well, I think the Senate has a broader range of political views. They have something like the majority of democratic representatives. The House is more Republican dominated, so politically diverse is less likely. So B might be correct, but I'm not sure if it's the reason why filibusters are less common.

Option C: The House meets for substantially fewer hours per day than the Senate. The Senate has longer hours, like 10 hours a day, while the House meets for about 8 hours a day. So that's a difference, but does that affect whether a filibuster happens? I'm not sure. I think the length of time is a factor, but maybe not the primary reason. It's possible that the longer hours could mean less time to prepare, but perhaps the computational aspect isn't a reason.

Option D: Senate decorum forbids one senator from attempting to stop another's speech. I remember that in the Senate, it's more formal and less confrontational. So people are less likely to stop each other's statements without addressing them. This could make it harder for someone to initiate a filibuster because others are more cautious. So D might be the correct answer.

Option E: The Speaker of the House has the power to end a filibuster at any time. I think the Speaker does have the authority to end a filibuster, but maybe not as freely as in the Senate. The Speaker can stop a filibuster, but other members might also be involved. It's a crucial point but perhaps not the main reason for why it's less common.

Option F: Debate in the House is in most instances strictly regulated by the rules. I'm not sure about this. I thought the House debates are more open and less strictly regulated compared to the Senate. The Senate has more rules and stricter regulations. So F might not be correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question is why the House is less likely to have a filibuster despite having the same number of members. The most significant factor is probably decorum and the environment. The House is a more formal political body, and in the Senate, it's more democratic and confrontational. So in the Senate, you can stop someone's speech without fear of repercussions, which makes it harder to initiate a filibuster. Therefore, the answer is D because the Senate's decorum makes it harder for one senator to stop another, so they're less likely to form a filibuster.

The correct answer is D: Senate decorum forbids one senator from attempting to stop another's speech. The Senate's formal and less confrontational environment makes it harder for one senator to stop another's speech, making it less likely to form a filibuster. 

Answer: D
