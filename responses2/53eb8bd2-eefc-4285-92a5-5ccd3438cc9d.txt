Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?

Options:

A: The gun discharged accidentally.
B: The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.
C: He was under the influence of alcohol at the time.
D: The bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target.
E: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention.
F: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend.
G: He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.
H: He did not know the daughter was present.
I: He intended only to wound the friend.
J: He was unaware of the elements of malice.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this murder question. Let's see what the question is about. The defendant was angry at his friend for marrying his former girlfriend. The friend painted a house, and when the defendant shot, the bullet killed the daughter. The charge is first-degree murder, and the options are about what evidence would best establish malice.

So, first, I need to remember the definitions of malice in this context. From the given statutes, Section 169 says that murder is unlawful and intentional killing with malice. Malice is a deliberate intention to kill another. So, the defendant needs to show that he intentionally committed the murder.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The gun discharged accidentally. If the shot was accidental, that would mean the bullet hit but wasn't due to malice. But malice requires a deliberate intent, not just a chance. So A doesn't show malice; it's about the act being accidental, not intentional.

Option B: The killing was due to negligence in missing the friend. Negligence in missing the target doesn't show malice. Malice is a conscious intent, not an oversight. negligence is about the act itself but not the intent.

Option C: He was under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol can sometimes cause malice, but it's not a direct cause. It might make someone more inclined, but the question is about showing malice. So this might not be the best evidence.

Option D: The bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target. If it didn't hit the intended target, that might suggest malice because the act was wrong. But deflection doesn't show intent—it just means the bullet missed. Malice requires a deliberate intent to cause the death.

Option E: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention. Wait, what's the difference between anger and malice? Malice is a specific intent to kill, whereas anger is more general. So if the defendant was angry, it's possible he intended to kill, but the act itself might not show malice because it's just an emotion. So E says he was angry but didn't act with intent. That doesn't show malice; it's just a lack of malice.

Option F: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend. Scaring someone doesn't mean malice. Scaring is a defense, not malice. Malice requires intentional killing, not just fear.

Option G: He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter. Wait, the bullet killed the daughter, but he intended to kill the friend. So he intended to kill the friend, but the bullet killed the daughter. That's a problem because malice requires intent to kill someone else. So if he intended to kill the friend, then the malice is against the friend. So G suggests he intended to kill the friend, which would mean malice against the friend, not the daughter. But the charge is against the daughter. So G doesn't show malice against the daughter.

Option H: He did not know the daughter was present. That's about knowledge, not intent. Malice requires intent, not knowledge. So this doesn't help.

Option I: He intended only to wound the friend. Wait, this is similar to G. He intended to kill the friend, so if he intended to kill the friend, malice is against the friend, not the daughter. So I is about friend's death, not the daughter's.

Option J: He was unaware of the elements of malice. Malice requires malice towards the intended target. If he wasn't aware, then he didn't have malice. So if he was unaware, J would be the best evidence.

Wait, but I'm looking for the best defense. So what's the best way to show malice? Let's think again.

Malice in murder is a specific intent to kill. So the defendant needs to show that he had a conscious intention to kill the daughter, not just that he intended to kill someone else.

Looking at each option:

Option J: He was unaware of malice. If he was unaware, then he didn't have malice. That would mean the defense is strongest, because if he wasn't aware, he didn't have malice.

Wait, but wait—what about the other options? Let's check if any other option can show malice.

Option D: The bullet was deflected and didn't hit the intended target. That means the intended target wasn't killed. So if the defendant intended to kill the friend, but the bullet hit the daughter, that would be a problem because malice requires killing the intended target. So D shows the intended target wasn't killed, which would be a problem for malice. So D says the bullet didn't hit the intended target (the friend). But what about the intended target? The question says the bullet killed the daughter, not the friend. So if he intended to kill the friend, then D is a problem because the intended target wasn't killed, which would be against malice.

Wait, but D says the bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target. So if he intended to kill the friend, but the bullet didn't hit the friend, then that's a problem. So D would show that malice against the friend, not the daughter.

So the best way is to show malice against the intended target (the friend), but the charge is against the daughter. So perhaps none of the options directly show malice against the daughter. So the best defense would be if he was aware that he intended to kill the daughter, but the question is about what evidence would help.

Wait, let me reevaluate the options.

Looking at the options again:

The correct approach is to show malice, which requires a specific intent to kill. So the best evidence would be that he intended to kill the intended target (the daughter), but the options don't provide that.

Wait, another thought: The defendant was angry at his friend. The friend's action led to the defendant shooting. But for malice, he needs to have a specific intent. So, if he was acting with malice, that would be towards the intended target. So if the defendant was under the influence of alcohol, that might make him more intent, but it's not a direct proof.

But in the options, the choices are about specific evidence.

So let's think about the possible answers. The question is, which choice would best provide the defendant with his best defense against the first-degree murder charge.

The options are about what evidence would show malice.

Option J says he was unaware of the elements of malice. If he was unaware, then he didn't have malice, so he doesn't have malice. So that would be the strongest defense.

But wait, malice requires malice towards the intended target. So the elements are malice and directed intent. So, the defendant had malice against the intended target (the friend). If he was unaware of this, he doesn't have malice.

So, if J is true, then he doesn't have malice. So this would be the best defense.

Alternatively, looking at other options:

If he intended to kill the friend, but the bullet missed, then that's a problem. So D says the bullet didn't hit the intended target (friend), which would be a problem because malice requires killing the intended target.

But D says the bullet missed the intended target, so that would be a problem for malice against the intended target. But the charge is against the daughter.

Wait, but the bullet killed the daughter. So if he intended to kill the daughter, then D would show malice against the daughter. But D says the bullet missed the intended target, which is the friend. So D is about the intended target, not the actual target.

So D's statement is about the intended target, not the actual target (the daughter). So D doesn't show malice against the daughter.

So the only way to show malice is to show that he intended to kill the daughter, which is the intended target. So among the options, J would be the way to show that he was unaware of malice.

Wait, but if he intended to kill the daughter, then J says he was unaware, which is a defense.

Wait, but in the question, the charge is against the daughter. So if the defendant intended to kill the daughter, then J (unaware) would be the best defense.

Wait, but the options are about what evidence would best provide the defendant's best defense. So let's see the options again.

Option J: He was unaware of the elements of malice.

So, if the defendant was aware, then he had malice. If unaware, then no malice.

So the best defense is to show that he was unaware, meaning he didn't have malice. So J would be the correct answer.

To determine the best defense for the defendant in his first-degree murder charge, it is essential to analyze how each option relates to malice, which requires a specific intent to kill a targeted individual.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A: The gun discharged accidentally.**  
   This shows an accident in the act but does not demonstrate malice, as malice requires a conscious intent, not an accident.

2. **Option B: The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.**  
   Negligence in missing the target does not establish malice, as malice requires a deliberate intention, not an oversight.

3. **Option C: He was under the influence of alcohol at the time.**  
   Alcohol can sometimes increase malice, but it does not directly establish malice; it merely amplifies the intent.

4. **Option D: The bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target.**  
   This shows that the intended target (the friend) was not killed. Malice requires killing the intended target, so this is a problem, not a defense.

5. **Option E: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention.**  
   Anger can be a factor in malice, but malice requires a conscious intent, not just anger. This option does not establish malice.

6. **Option F: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend.**  
   Scaring someone does not constitute malice; malice requires intent to kill.

7. **Option G: He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.**  
   This suggests malice against the friend, not the daughter. Malice against the daughter is what needs to be shown.

8. **Option H: He did not know the daughter was present.**  
   Knowing the target does not demonstrate malice; malice requires intent, not knowledge.

9. **Option I: He intended only to wound the friend.**  
   This shows malice against the friend, not the daughter.

10. **Option J: He was unaware of the elements of malice.**  
    Malice requires malice toward the intended target (the daughter). If he was unaware, he did not have malice toward the intended target. This makes Option J the strongest defense, as it directly demonstrates lack of malice.

### Conclusion:
The best defense is to show that the defendant was unaware of malice, as this directly indicates he did not have malice towards the intended target (the daughter).
