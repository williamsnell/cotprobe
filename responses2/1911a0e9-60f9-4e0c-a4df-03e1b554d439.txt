Okay, so I have this question about excise taxes and how they're burdened on producers. Hmm, I remember that an excise tax is a tax imposed on the production or consumption of a good. The burden on consumers depends on whether the demand and supply curves are elastic or inelastic.

Wait, I think the basic idea is that if demand is more elastic, consumers are more responsive to price changes, meaning they'll buy less when the price goes up. Similarly, supply's elasticity affects how much producers are willing to adjust their production.

So, the question is, which option would make consumers pay the largest share of the tax. Oh right, when demand is inelastic and supply is elastic. Because if demand is inelastic, consumers won't reduce their purchases much when the price goes up. Meanwhile, if supply is elastic, producers will adjust their supply more, so they can pass a tax on more to consumers.

Wait, let me think. The burden of the tax is determined by the elasticity of demand and supply. More elastic supply means producers can pass on more of the tax to consumers because they can increase production. If supply is elastic, then the supply curve is flatter (because it's elastic, so it's sloping downward but flatter). 

Wait, no, wait, the elasticities are about how responsive the quantity is to price changes. The tax incidence depends on the relative elasticities. So, the formula I remember is that the burden on consumers is (elasticity of supply)/(elasticity of supply + elasticity of demand). Or was it the other way around? Wait, maybe it's (elasticity of supply) divided by (elasticity of supply + elasticity of demand).

Wait, let me think again. If supply is perfectly elastic, meaning producers can't pass on any tax because they can adjust quantities immediately. So the burden would be zero on consumers because the entire burden goes to the producer. Wait, no, no, because when supply is perfectly elastic, producers can't respond to a tax. So if the supply is perfectly elastic, then producers would absorb the entire burden because they can't reduce their production. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the burden is proportional to the inverse of the sum of the elasticities. Hmm. Wait, another way: the burden ratio is (elasticity of supply)/(elasticity of supply + elasticity of demand). Or is it the other way around? Because I think it's that the burden is (elasticity of supply)/(elasticity of supply + elasticity of demand).

Wait, let me think with numbers. Let's say demand is inelastic and supply is elastic. Let's say demand elasticity is 1 (perfectly inelastic) and supply is elastic, say 2. Then the burden on consumers would be 2/(1 + 2) = 2/3. So consumers pay 2/3, producers pay 1/3. So the burden is larger for consumers when demand is inelastic and supply is elastic.

Conversely, if demand is elastic and supply is inelastic, then the burden on consumers would be (1)/(1 + high elasticity). Like if demand is 2 and supply elasticity is 1. Then 2/(2+1)= 2/3. So in this case, the burden on consumers is higher when demand is more elastic, but supply is inelastic.

Wait, but in this problem, we're looking for which option would make consumers pay the largest burden. So which scenario leads to the largest share.

Looking back at the options, the options are about the combination of demand and supply elasticity.

So the correct scenario is when demand is inelastic (so consumers don't reduce their purchases much) and supply is elastic (so producers can pass on more of the tax). Because supply's elasticity is in the denominator in the ratio.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option B: demand is perfectly elastic, supply is perfectly inelastic. Wait, no, that's supply is inelastic. Wait, no. Wait, perfect inelasticity is supply is perfectly inelastic. So if supply is perfectly inelastic, that means quantity supplied doesn't change with price. So producers can't pass on much of the tax because they can't change their output. So if supply is perfectly inelastic, no one can change the quantity supplied, so any excise tax would have to be passed on entirely to consumers because they can't reduce their buying. So consumers pay all of the tax burden. Wait, but the options don't have that. Let's see the options:

Wait, option E: demand is price elastic, supply is price inelastic. So demand elastic (so consumers are more responsive to price changes), supply inelastic (producers can't change quantity much). Then, the burden ratio would be (elasticity supply)/(e+e). Since supply is inelastic, its elasticity is low (like 1, if perfectly inelastic). So the denominator would be e +1. Wait, if e is low (like 1), then the burden would be higher. Wait, but here, the question is about which option would cause the largest burden on consumers.

Wait, no, wait. The formula I think is that the burden on consumers is (e_s) / (e_s + e_d). Because when supply is more elastic, the burden is smaller, and when supply is less elastic (smaller e_s), the burden is more.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let me think of a case where e_s is 1 (elasticity of supply is 1) and e_d is 2 (elasticity of demand is 2). Then the burden on consumers is 1/(1+2)= 1/3. So the burden is 1/3, producers take 2/3.

Another case: e_s is 2, e_d is 1. Then, e_s/(e_s + e_d) is 2/(3)= 0.666. So consumers pay 2/3, producers pay 1/3. So in this case, the burden is larger for consumers.

Wait, so in this scenario, when supply is more elastic (e_s higher), the burden on consumers is lower. So to maximize the burden on consumers, we need supply to be as inelastic as possible, and demand to be as inelastic as possible.

So looking at the options, the correct scenario is when supply is inelastic and demand is inelastic. Because if both are inelastic, then the denominator is sum of two small numbers. So e_s/(e_s + e_d) would be larger.

Let me check the options:

Option B: demand is perfectly elastic (e_d = ∞), supply is perfectly inelastic (e_s = 0). So e_s/(e_s + e_d) = 0/(0+∞)=0. So consumers pay 0, producers pay all. So that's not the case.

Option E: demand is price elastic (e_d = finite, say 2), supply is inelastic (e_s = 1). So e_s/(e_s + e_d) = 1/(2+1) = 1/3. So consumers pay 1/3.

Wait, but what about when both are inelastic? Let's see.

Looking at the options, option F: demand is perfectly inelastic (e_d =0), supply is price elastic (e_s=2). So e_s/(e_s + e_d) = 2/(2+0) = 1. So consumers would pay all. That's not the case.

Wait, that can't be right because if supply is price elastic, producers can adjust more, so the burden is higher. Wait, but in this case, the supply is more elastic, so the denominator is e_s +e_d, which is 2. So e_s/(e_s +e_d) = 2/(2+0)=1, meaning the burden is 100% on consumers. But that would require that supply is perfectly elastic, which is e_s approaches infinity. But e_s is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula again. Alternatively, I've heard that the burden on consumers is (elasticity of supply) / (elasticity of supply + elasticity of demand). Or is it the other way around? Let me think in another way.

The more inelastic the supply, the more burden on consumers. Because if supply is inelastic, producers can't adjust their quantity much. So if demand is inelastic, consumers don't reduce their buying much. So the burden on consumers is higher.

So the scenario where both e_d and e_s are inelastic (e_d is low, e_s is low) would be when both are inelastic, so the denominator is small, making the ratio large.

Looking at the options, which option has both e_d and e_s as inelastic.

The options are:

A: both price inelastic

B: demand perfectly elastic, supply perfectly inelastic.

C: demand price inelastic, supply price elastic.

D: both price elastic.

E: demand price elastic, supply price inelastic.

F: demand perfectly inelastic, supply price elastic.

G: demand perfectly inelastic, supply price elastic (wait, G is demand perfectly inelastic and supply is price elastic. So in this case, e_d is 0, e_s is 2. So (e_s)/(e_s + e_d) = 2/(0+2)=1. So consumers pay 100% of the tax. Which is not the case. Wait, no, that can't be right because if supply is price elastic, then supply can change a lot. So if supply is price elastic, producers can increase production, so they can pass on more of the tax to consumers. So in option G, if supply is price elastic (e_s=2), and demand is perfectly inelastic (e_d=0). Then the burden is e_s/(e_s +e_d) = 2/(2+0)=1. So consumers pay all. That's not one of the options, but let's see.

Wait, but looking at G, supply is price elastic. Wait, price elastic is a high elasticity. So in G, if supply is price elastic and demand is perfectly inelastic, then supply can change a lot. So producers can pass more of the tax on to consumers. So the burden on consumers is higher. So in this scenario, option G would have the largest burden.

Wait, but the options are:

G: demand is perfectly inelastic and supply is price elastic.

So e_d=0, e_s=2.

Then, the burden on consumers is e_s/(e_s + e_d) = 2/(2+0)=1. So the entire burden goes to consumers. So in this case, G would cause the largest burden on consumers.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option G has supply as price elastic. So supply is more elastic than D, which is both price elastic. So the formula would give a higher denominator? No, because the formula is e_s/(e_s + e_d). So in G, e_s is 2, e_d is 0. So denominator is 2. So the ratio is 1 (2/2). So the burden is 1. That would mean the entire burden goes to consumers. So that would be the case where the supply is more elastic than demand is inelastic, but demand is perfectly inelastic.

So looking back at the options, option G would cause the largest burden. Wait, but the options are G and E. Let me read them again.

Looking at the options, I think G is option G, which is if demand is perfectly inelastic and supply is price elastic.

Wait, but in this scenario, e_d=0, e_s=2. So e_s/(e_s + e_d) = 2/2=1. So consumers pay all.

So in this case, the burden is largest. So the correct answer would be option G.

Wait, but another way to think: when supply is more elastic, the burden is smaller. So when supply is more elastic, consumers pay less. So the question is which option makes consumers pay the largest burden. So the one where the denominator is the smallest. That would occur when e_d is as low as possible, and e_s is as low as possible.

Looking at the options, the only one where both e_d and e_s are low (perfectly inelastic) is option G. Because G is demand is perfectly inelastic (so e_d is 0), and supply is price elastic (so e_s is 2). So e_s/(e_s +e_d) = 2/(2+0) =1.

Alternatively, option E: demand is price elastic (e_d=2), supply is price inelastic (e_s=1). So e_s/(e_s +e_d)=1/(2+1)=1/3. So consumers pay 1/3, producers 2/3.

Option H: demand is perfectly elastic (e_d=∞), supply is price inelastic (e_s=1). So e_s/(e_s +e_d) =1/(∞+1)=0. So consumers pay nothing. Producers pay all.

Option I: demand is price elastic (e_d=2), supply is price elastic (e_s=2). So e_s/(e_s +e_d)=2/(2+2)=0.5. So both pay 50% each.

Option D: both are price elastic. So e_s/(e_s +e_d)=e_s/(e_s +e_d). For example, if e_d=2 and e_s=2, then 2/(2+2)=0.5. So both have 50%.

Option C: demand is price inelastic (e_d=1), supply is price elastic (e_s=2). So e_s/(e_s +e_d)=2/(2+1)=2/3. So consumers pay 2/3, producers pay 1/3.

Option F: demand is perfectly inelastic (e_d=0), supply is price elastic (e_s=2). So e_s/(e_s +e_d)=2/(0+2)=1. So all burden goes to consumers.

Option A: both price inelastic. So e_s/(e_s +e_d) is inelastic, but if both are inelastic, e_s and e_d are small. So the ratio would be e_s/(e_s +e_d) which is a small number. Let's say e_s=1, e_d=1. Then ratio is 1/2. So consumers pay 50%.

So among all options, the largest burden is achieved when both are inelastic, but in such a way that the denominator (e_s +e_d) is the smallest. The only option where both are inelastic is G. Because in G, e_d=0 (perfectly inelastic), which is the lowest possible e_d, and e_s=2, which is moderately elastic. So the ratio is 2/(2+0) =1, so the largest possible burden on consumers.

So the correct answer should be option G: if the demand curve is perfectly inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic.

To determine which scenario results in consumers paying the largest burden of an excise tax, we analyze the elasticity of demand and supply. The burden on consumers is determined by the formula:

\[
\text{Consumer Burden} = \frac{\text{Elasticity of Supply}}{\text{Elasticity of Supply} + \text{Elasticity of Demand}}
\]

A higher elasticity of supply means producers can pass more of the tax to consumers. To maximize the burden on consumers, both demand and supply should be inelastic (low elasticity). This minimizes the denominator (e_s + e_d), maximizing the ratio.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A**: Both demand and supply are price inelastic.  
   - If both elasticities are low, the denominator is small, but the exact impact depends on the specific values. This does not guarantee the largest burden.

2. **Option B**: Demand is perfectly elastic, supply is perfectly inelastic.  
   - Demand elasticity (e_d) is very high, so the denominator becomes large, reducing the burden on consumers. Not the correct answer.

3. **Option C**: Demand is price inelastic, supply is price elastic.  
   - Here, demand is low, but supply is moderately elastic. The denominator is moderate, but the burden is not the largest.

4. **Option D**: Both demand and supply are price elastic.  
   - Both elasticities are high, making the denominator large and the burden smaller for consumers. Not the correct answer.

5. **Option E**: Demand is price elastic, supply is price inelastic.  
   - Demand is moderately elastic, and supply is low. The denominator is moderate, but the burden is not the largest.

6. **Option F**: Demand is perfectly inelastic, supply is price elastic.  
   - Demand elasticity (e_d) is 0, making the denominator equal to the elasticity of supply (e_s). If e_s is moderately high, the burden on consumers is significant but not the largest possible.

7. **Option G**: Demand is perfectly inelastic, supply is price elastic.  
   - Demand elasticity (e_d) is 0, and supply is moderately elastic (e_s = 2). The denominator is 2, maximizing the burden on consumers (\(\frac{2}{2+0} = 1\)).

8. **Option H**: Demand is perfectly elastic, supply is price inelastic.  
   - Demand elasticity (e_d) is very high, reducing the denominator and the burden on consumers.

9. **Option I**: Demand is price elastic, supply is price elastic.  
   - Both elasticities are moderate, making the denominator large but not the smallest. The burden is smaller than in Option G.

### Conclusion:
The scenario where demand is perfectly inelastic (e_d = 0) and supply is price elastic (e_s = 2) maximizes the burden on consumers, as it results in the smallest possible denominator (\(e_s + e_d = 2\)), making the consumer burden 100%. This corresponds to **Option G**.
