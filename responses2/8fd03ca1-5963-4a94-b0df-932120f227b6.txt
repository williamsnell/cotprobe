Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron in a one-dimensional box, right? I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the electron is in the state n=1, and I need to find the probability of it being in the region from 0 to L/2. Oh wait, the length is L, so the question is about the first half of the box.

I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well (which is what this setup resembles), the wavefunctions are sine functions. The general formula for the wavefunction ψ_n(x) is sqrt(2/L) * sin(nπx/L). Since n is 1 here, ψ_1(x) = sqrt(2/L) sin(πx/L).

Probability is the integral of the square of the wavefunction over the region we're interested in. So the probability P is the integral from 0 to L/2 of |ψ_1(x)|² dx.

Since ψ_1 is real here, the square is just ψ_1 squared. So P = ∫ (from 0 to L/2) [ (2/L) sin²(πx/L) ] dx.

Hmm, okay. The integral of sin²(ax) dx is a standard integral. There's a formula that sin²(a x) = (1 - cos(2a x))/2. So applying that here, we can rewrite the integrand.

So substituting, sin²(πx/L) becomes [1 - cos(2πx/L)] / 2. Then the integral becomes:

P = (2/L) ∫ (from 0 to L/2) [ (1 - cos(2πx/L)) / 2 ] dx
= (2/L) * (1/2) ∫ (0 to L/2) [ 1 - cos(2πx/L) ] dx
= (1/L) [ ∫0^{L/2} 1 dx - ∫0^{L/2} cos(2πx/L) dx ]

Let me compute each part. The first integral is straightforward: integral of 1 dx from 0 to L/2 is (L/2 - 0) = L/2.

The second integral: ∫ cos(2πx/L) dx. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 2πx/L. Then du = 2π/L dx → dx = L/(2π) du. The limits when x=0: u=0. x=L/2 → u=2π*(L/2)/L = π. So the integral becomes ∫ (u from 0 to π) cos(u) * (L/(2π)) du.

The integral of cos(u) is sin(u), so evaluating from 0 to π:

sin(π) - sin(0) → 0 - 0 = 0. Wait, but wait, what's the integral? ∫ cos(u) du is sin(u). So the second integral becomes (L/(2π)) [sin(u)] from 0 to π → (L/(2π))(0 - 0) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no: the substitution was u = 2πx/L. So when x is 0, u=0, and when x is L/2, u= (2π (L/2))/L )= π. So the integral becomes ∫ (from 0 to π) cos(u) * (L/(2π)) du. The integral of cos(u) is sin(u), so evaluating from 0 to π gives sin(π) - sin(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. So the second integral is (L/(2π)) * 0 = 0.

So putting it back into the equation for P:

P = (1/L) [ (L/2) - 0 ] = (1/L) * (L/2) = 1/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would mean the probability is 1/2. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the particle was in the first half of the box. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I messed up the substitution. Oh no, let me think again. The substitution was correct: u = 2πx/L, so du = (2π/L) dx → dx = L/(2π) du. So the integral of cos(2πx/L) dx from 0 to L/2 becomes:

∫ (x=0 to x=L/2) cos(2πx/L) dx = ∫ (u=0 to u=π) cos(u) * (L/(2π)) du.

Integral of cos u is sin u. So [sin(π) - sin(0)] * L/(2π) → (0-0) * L/(2π) = 0. So the second integral is zero.

So P becomes (1/L) * (L/2) = 1/2. Wait, but that would imply the probability is 50%. But I've heard in one-dimensional boxes, the probability of finding the electron in the first half is 1/2. Oh wait, but wait, that's actually correct.

Wait, but I'm confused because I thought for even n, the probability might be different. No, the particle in a box for n=1 is the ground state. Let me think: for n=1, the probability to find the particle in the left half is 1/2. But wait, isn't that the case for any n? Or is there a different calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation. Let me redo the integral.

The integral is:

P = ∫ (0 to L/2) [ (2/L) sin²(πx/L) ] dx

Which equals (2/L) * (1/2) ∫ (0 to L/2) [1 - cos(2πx/L)] dx

So that's (1/L) [ ∫0^{L/2} 1 dx - ∫0^{L/2} cos(2πx/L) dx ]

First integral: [x] from 0 to L/2 → L/2.

Second integral: Let me compute it again. Let me make a substitution: u = 2πx/L → x = (L u)/(2π). So dx = (L)/(2π) du.

When x=0 → u=0; x=L/2 → u= (2π*(L/2)) / L )= π.

So the integral becomes ∫ (u=0 to u=π) cos(u) * (L/(2π)) du.

Which is (L/(2π)) * [sin(u)] from 0 to π → (L/(2π))(sin π - sin 0) → (L/(2π))(0-0) = 0.

So the second part is zero.

So P = (1/L) [ (L/2) - 0 ] = (1/L) * (L/2 ) → 1/2.

So the probability is 1/2, which is 50%. Hmm, but looking at the options, option E is 1/2. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but wait another moment. I think I might have a mistake. For a particle in a symmetric potential well, the wavefunction for n=1 is symmetric about the center. So the probability of being on either side should be equal. So the first half of the box (x from 0 to L/2) and the second half (x from L/2 to L) should each have 50% probability. So that makes sense. So the probability is 1/2, option E.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me think about n=2. Oh no, wait, in this question, n is 1. So that's the ground state. So the wavefunction is symmetric about the center, so the probabilities for left and right halves are each 1/2. So the answer should be E.

The problem involves an electron confined to a one-dimensional metallic nanoparticle modeled as a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length \( L \). The electron is in the state \( n = 1 \), and the goal is to calculate the probability of finding it in the region \( 0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2}L \).

The wavefunction for \( n = 1 \) is given by:

\[
\psi_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right).
\]

The probability of finding the electron in the region \( 0 \leq x \leq \frac{L}{2} \) is calculated as:

\[
P = \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} |\psi_1(x)|^2 dx.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi_1(x)|^2 = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right) \), the integral becomes:

\[
P = \frac{2}{L} \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right) dx.
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \sin^2(a) = \frac{1 - \cos(2a)}{2} \), the integrand simplifies to:

\[
\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right) = \frac{1 - \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)}{2}.
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
P = \frac{2}{L} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} \left[1 - \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)\right] dx.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
P = \frac{1}{L} \left[ \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} 1 dx - \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) dx \right].
\]

The first integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} 1 dx = \frac{L}{2}.
\]

For the second integral, let \( u = \frac{2\pi x}{L} \), so \( du = \frac{2\pi}{L} dx \) and \( dx = \frac{L}{2\pi} du \). The limits of integration change from \( x = 0 \) to \( u = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{L}{2} \) to \( u = \pi \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) dx = \frac{L}{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \cos(u) du.
\]

Evaluating this integral:

\[
\int_0^\pi \cos(u) du = \sin(u) \Big|_0^\pi = \sin(\pi) - \sin(0) = 0.
\]

Thus, the second integral is zero. Substituting back into the expression for \( P \):

\[
P = \frac{1}{L} \left[ \frac{L}{2} - 0 \right] = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The probability of finding the electron in the region \( 0 \leq x \leq \frac{L}{2} \) is therefore \( \frac{1}{2} \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:
