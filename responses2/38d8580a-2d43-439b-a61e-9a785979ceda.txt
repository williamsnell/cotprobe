Okay, so Mr. Burke bought some bonds and I need to figure out how much interest he received. Let me read the question again. He purchased three 5(1/4)% bonds with a par value of $1,000 each. The interest is paid semiannually. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on bond calculations, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that the interest on a bond is based on its par value and the coupon rate. The coupon rate is the interest rate the bond pays, which is given here as 5 and a quarter percent, or 5.25%. Wait, sometimes it's written as 5 1/4, which is the same as 5.25%. So each bond has a 5.25% coupon rate.

Each bond's par value is $1,000. So for one bond, the annual interest would be 5.25% of $1,000. Let me calculate that: 5.25% of 1000 is 52.50. So each bond pays $52.50 in interest annually.

But wait, the bonds pay interest semiannually. That means every six months, the interest is paid halfway through the year. So each semiannual interest payment would be half of $52.50. Let me do that: 52.50 divided by 2 is $26.25 per bond every six months.

But the question is asking for the total interest he will receive. So if he has three bonds, each paying $26.25 every six months, how much does he get over the year? Well, since each bond gives him a semiannual interest, for three bonds, the total would be 3 times the semiannual interest per bond. So that's 3 * $26.25.

Let me compute that: 26.25 *3. Hmm, 26 *3 is 78, and 0.25*3 is 0.75, so total is 78.75. So each year, he receives $78.75 in interest from the three bonds.

Looking at the options, option D is $78.75. So that should be the correct answer.

The total interest Mr. Burke receives from his three bonds is calculated as follows:

Each bond has a par value of $1,000 and a 5.25% coupon rate. The annual interest per bond is 5.25% of $1,000, which is $52.50. Since interest is paid semiannually, each payment is half of that, so $26.25 per bond. For three bonds, the total annual interest is 3 * $26.25 = $78.75.

Answer: D
