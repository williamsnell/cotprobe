Okay, I need to figure out which Hindu festival involves decorating houses with lights, setting off firecrackers, and wearing new clothes. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Pongal. I remember that Pongal is about bringing lights and decorations, but I don't think it involves firecrackers or wearing new clothes. It's more about traditional festivals and rituals.

Option B: Ganesh Chaturthi. That's another traditional festival, but I don't recall it involving firecrackers. It's more about bringing good omen and blessings.

Option C: Janmashtami. Janmashtami is a festival where people dress up, but wait, I also remember that Janmashtami includes a firecracker contest. Oh, but isn't that more of a traditional element? Or is it part of the celebrations? Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.

Option D: Holi. Holi is a festival where people light fireworks and set off fireworks. That's definitely a part of Holi. Also, during Holi, they wear new clothes. So this seems to fit all the points mentioned.

Option E: Karva Chauth. I'm not sure about this one. Karva is a month-long religious observance, but I don't recall it involving the specific actions mentioned. It might be more about religious rituals and festivals.

Option F: Makar Sankranti. That's the last day of Lent, a religious observance, and not related to decorations, firecrackers, or wearing new clothes.

Option G: Deepavali. This is a festival around the diagonal of a square, celebrating marriage and the moon. It doesn't involve the specific activities mentioned.

Option H: Navaratri. This is around March and involves religious rituals and Christmas-like decorations, but not the same as Holi.

Option I: Raksha Bandhan. This is an annual spiritual festival in India, associated with the Vanaspati religion, and involves lighting candles and other rituals, but not the specific activities mentioned.

Option J: Others aren't listed. So looking back, D is Holi. Yes, that's the one. Holi is about lighting fireworks, setting off fireworks, and wearing new clothes. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: Holi. Holi is a Hindu festival where people light fireworks, set off fireworks, and wear new clothes, all part of the celebrations.
