Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about the percentage of the population in South Sudan who had access to electricity in 2016. Let's start by recalling what I know about South Sudan's electricity situation.

I remember that South Sudan is a developing country, and it's often cited in poverty statistics. I think in 2016, a significant portion of the population had access to electricity. Oh right, I've heard some numbers before, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage.

Wait, I think in 2016, the percentage was around 79%. That seems high, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. South Sudan has a history of prolonged civil war, which might have affected the availability of electricity. However, I also know that despite the conflict, many people were still connected to power through various means, like electricity grids in remote areas or through government connections.

Looking at the options provided, option A is 79%. That's one of the choices. I don't recall any options for 80% or higher, so 79% seems plausible. I should make sure I'm not mixing up with other years or regions. For example, in 2002, I think the percentage was around 69%, but that's a different year. 2007, it might have been higher, but 2016 is a specific year.

I also remember hearing that by 2016, at least 50% of the population had access to electricity, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, there's been some progress in recent years, but the exact figure for 2016 is still in question. But given the options, 79% is the closest to what I've heard about in that specific year.

The correct answer is A: 79%. This percentage reflects the significant portion of the population in South Sudan with access to electricity in 2016, despite the country's challenging circumstances.
