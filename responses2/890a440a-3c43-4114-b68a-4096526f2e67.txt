Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about diffusion rates of gases. Right, I remember that Graham's law is involved in this kind of problem. Let me think through this.

The question states that we inject NH3 and HX into opposite ends of a glass tube. We then observe where NH4X forms. We have to figure out where the NH4X deposit is formed based on the properties of HX. The options provided are about the distances from the NH3 injection end in centimeters.

Wait, the setup is a bit different. NH4X is the product of a reaction when NH3 reacts with HX. Let me think: NH3 + HX → NH4X? Or maybe it's NH3 + HX → NH4X? Let me balance that: NH3 + HX → NH4X. Oh wait, NH3 has one H, HX has one H as well (assuming HX is like HCl, HBr, etc.), so they must combine to form NH4X.

So, if I inject NH3 and HX into opposite ends, the NH4X will form where the gases diffuse towards each other. The rate of diffusion depends on the molar mass. According to Graham's law, the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of the gas.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says we inject NH3 and HX into opposite ends. So the NH4X will form where the NH3 and HX diffuse towards each other. So the point where NH4X forms is the point where the gases meet. So the distance from the NH3 injection point would depend on how quickly each gas diffuses.

But wait, the gases are NH3 and HX. The one with the lower molar mass diffuses faster. So the heavier gas (higher molar mass) would diffuse slower.

Wait, let me get the molar masses right. NH3: N is about 14, H is 1 each. So 14 + 3(1) = 17 g/mol. HX: H is 1, so the molar mass is 1 + X's atomic mass.

So for HCl: Cl is about 35.5, so 1 +35.5=36.5 g/mol.

HX is HCl, HBr, HCl, HCl, etc. So, for HCl, the molar mass is 36.5 g/mol.

NH3 is 17 g/mol.

So according to Graham's law, the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. So the lighter gas (NH3) will diffuse faster, meaning it will reach the other end (where HX is) more quickly.

Wait, wait. So the distance each gas travels before meeting will be proportional to their rate. Since NH3 is lighter, it'll travel a longer distance compared to HX.

Wait, let me think. If two gases are diffusing from opposite ends, the distance each travels before meeting is proportional to (sqrt(molar mass of the other gas) ) / (sqrt(molar mass of current gas)).

Wait, no. Let me get the formula correct. The ratio of their speeds is sqrt(m2/m1), where m1 is the molar mass of gas A, m2 gas B.

So, for two gases A and B, the distance each travels is proportional to sqrt(molar mass of B) / sqrt(molar mass of A) for the shorter path.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the time each gas takes to diffuse. Let's say the tube length is L. The distance each travels before meeting is d1 and d2, where d1 + d2 = L.

d1 = (molar mass of HX) / (molar mass of NH3) ) * ( (molar mass of NH3) / (molar mass of HX) )) * ... Wait, maybe I should think differently.

The time each gas takes to reach the meeting point is proportional to (distance traveled) / (rate of diffusion). Since rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to sqrt(molar mass), the time taken by each gas to meet is:

t = (distance) / (rate) = (distance) * sqrt(molar mass) ) / (some constant)

Assuming the same constant, the time is proportional to (distance) * sqrt(molar mass).

But since both gases are moving towards each other, the sum of their distances is the length of the tube. So,

d1 * sqrt(m_molar_NH3) + d2 * sqrt(m_molar_HX) = L

But wait, since d1 + d2 = L, and the time for each is t1 = d1/(rate_NH3) = d1 * sqrt(m_molar_HX) / k,

and similarly t2 = d2 * sqrt(m_molar_NH3) /k.

We can think that the ratio of times t1/t2 = (d1 * sqrt(m_HX)) / (d2 * sqrt(m_NH3)) )

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Another way is to consider that the time taken by each gas to meet is inversely proportional to their molar masses. Because the heavier gas (higher molar mass) would have a slower rate.

Wait, no, let's not get confused. Let's think about the rates. The rate (speed) of each gas is inversely proportional to sqrt(molar mass). So the speed of NH3 is higher than that of HX.

So, the distance each travels before meeting would be inversely proportional to their speeds or, more accurately, to the square roots of their molar masses.

Wait, the distance each travels is inversely proportional to their speed. Because, for example, higher speed means it covers more distance in the same time. So:

d1 ∝ 1 / (sqrt(m_molar_NH3) )

d2 ∝ 1 / (sqrt(m_molar_HX) )

But since d1 + d2 = L, the sum of two terms inversely proportional to the square roots of their respective molar masses.

So, the ratio d1/d2 = sqrt(m_molar_HX)/sqrt(m_molar_NH3) )

Wait, let me think again: for two gases A and B, the ratio of distances is (sqrt(m_B) / sqrt(m_A)).

Wait, not sure. Let's think about the problem again.

When we have two gases, A and B, diffusing from opposite ends, the point of contact is where they meet. The time each takes to reach that point is t1 and t2.

t1 = d1 / v1,

t2 = d2 / v2.

But since the gases are meeting, d1 + d2 = L.

And v1 = sqrt(m_A / M), where M is the molar mass.

Wait, no, I think the speed is inversely proportional to sqrt(molar mass). So v = k / sqrt(molar mass). Where k is a constant.

So, v_A = k / sqrt(m_A), v_B = k / sqrt(m_B).

So, t1 = d1 / (k / sqrt(m_A)) ) = d1 * sqrt(m_A) / k,

t2 = d2 * sqrt(m_B) / k.

But since d1 + d2 = L,

And also, the rates of diffusion are inversely proportional to the square roots of their molar masses. So, the ratio of their rates is sqrt(m_A)/sqrt(m_B).

But the time each takes is inversely proportional to their rates, so t1 ∝ 1/rate_A = sqrt(m_A)/k,

t2 ∝ sqrt(m_B)/k.

So, t1 = (sqrt(m_A) / k) * t,

t2 = (sqrt(m_B) / k) * t.

Because t is the same for both gases? Wait, no. Because they're moving in opposite directions. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, the distance each gas travels is proportional to the reciprocal of their rate. Since rate is proportional to 1/sqrt(molar mass), the distance d1 is proportional to sqrt(molar mass of HX), and d2 is proportional to sqrt(molar mass of NH3).

Wait, no. Because rate is higher for lighter gases. So if NH3 is lighter, it'll move faster. So when the gases meet, the distance each travels would be proportional to the inverse of their rates.

Wait, for example: if gas A has a higher rate, it will travel a longer distance. So the ratio d1/d2 = (rate_B) / (rate_A) ) = sqrt( m_A ) / sqrt( m_B )

So d1 = ( sqrt(m_A) / (sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B)) ) * L,

d2 = ( sqrt(m_B) / (sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B)) ) * L.

Wait, no, let me think again. The distance each travels is proportional to the time and their speed.

But since time is different for each, but perhaps the ratio of their times is the same as the ratio of their distances, but multiplied by the ratio of their speeds.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of distances is the inverse of the ratio of their speeds.

Wait, since d1 = v1 * t,

d2 = v2 * t,

d1 + d2 = L = t (v1 + v2 )

So,

t = L/(v1 + v2 )

d1 = v1 t = v1 L/(v1 + v2 )

Similarly, d2 = v2 L/(v1 + v2 )

But since v1 = k / sqrt(m_A ), v2 = k / sqrt(m_B )

So,

d1 = (k / sqrt(m_A )) * L / ( (k / sqrt(m_A )) + (k / sqrt(m_B )) )

Simplify denominator: k * [ 1/sqrt(m_A) + 1/sqrt(m_B) ) ]

So,

d1 = [ (k / sqrt(m_A )) * L ] / [ k (1/( sqrt(m_A) ) + 1/(sqrt(m_B) )) ) ]

k cancels out.

d1 = [ (1/sqrt(m_A )) * L ] / [ (1/ sqrt(m_A) ) + (1/sqrt(m_B) ) )

Factor 1/sqrt(m_A):

d1 = [ (1/ sqrt(m_A )) * L ] / [ (1/sqrt(m_A )) ( 1 + sqrt(m_B)/sqrt(m_A) ) ) ]

So,

d1 = [ L / sqrt(m_A) ] / [ (1 + sqrt(m_B)/sqrt(m_A) ) / sqrt(m_A) ]

Simplify denominator:

(1 + sqrt(m_B)/sqrt(m_A) ) / sqrt(m_A) ) = ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ) / ( sqrt(m_A) sqrt(m_A) )

Wait, wait. Let me calculate again.

Wait, (1/sqrt(m_A )) + (1/sqrt(m_B )) = ( sqrt(m_B ) + sqrt(m_A )) ) / ( sqrt(m_A ) sqrt(m_B ) )

So,

d1 = [ (1/sqrt(m_A )) * L ] * [ ( sqrt(m_A ) sqrt(m_B ) ) / ( sqrt(m_A ) + sqrt(m_B )) ) ) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1/sqrt(m_A )) * [ sqrt(m_A ) sqrt(m_B ) ] = sqrt(m_B )

So,

d1 = [ sqrt(m_B ) * L ] / [ sqrt(m_A ) + sqrt(m_B ) ]

Similarly, d2 = L - d1.

So, the formula is:

d1 = [ sqrt(m_B ) / ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ) ] * L

So let me apply this formula to our problem.

In this case, the two gases are NH3 and HX, which is HCl in this case.

So let's define:

Gas A: NH3. So molar mass mA = 17 g/mol.

Gas B: HX. So, molar mass mB = 1 + X's atomic mass.

Case a: HX is HF (HCl, X is Cl, molar mass 36.5 g/mol )

Case b: HX is HCl (same as above, same molar mass)

Wait, but wait, the problem states HX can be HF or HCl. So for each case, what is the molar mass of HX.

But for both parts a and b, mB is 36.5 g/mol.

Wait, that's a key point. The molar mass of HX is 36.5 for both HF and HCl.

So in both cases, mB = 36.5 g/mol.

So let's compute d1, the distance the NH3 travels, for both a and b.

For each case, hX is either HF or HCl, so mB is 36.5 g/mol.

So, for part a, HX is HF: mB = 36.5.

Compute d1 (NH3's distance):

d1 = [ sqrt(36.5) / ( sqrt(17) + sqrt(36.5) ) ] * L.

Wait, the length of the tube is given as 1m? Or 100 cm? Wait the question states the tube is 1m long, but in the answer options, the distances are in cm. So the tube length is 1m = 100 cm.

The problem says "simultaneously injected into the opposite ends" and the deposit is observed. So the tube length is 100 cm.

So L = 100 cm.

So for each case:

Case a: HX is HF.

mB = 36.5.

d1 = [ sqrt(36.5) / (sqrt(17) + sqrt(36.5) ) ] * 100 cm.

Compute sqrt(17) ≈ 4.123.

sqrt(36.5) ≈ 6.041.

So denominator: 4.123 + 6.041 ≈ 10.164.

Numerator: 6.041.

So d1 = (6.041 / 10.164 ) * 100.

Compute that:

6.041/10.164 ≈ 0.593.

0.593 * 100 ≈ 59.3 cm.

So for NH3, distance from injection end would be approximately 59.3 cm.

Wait, but wait, d1 is the distance that NH3 travels before meeting. So the NH4X is formed at that point. So the NH3 is located 59.3 cm from the injection end (NH3 end), and the HX is 40.7 cm from the NH3 end.

Wait, but wait, no. Because d1 is the distance from NH3 injection end. So the NH4X is formed at 59.3 cm from NH3 injection, and the HX is 100 -59.3 = 40.7 cm from NH3 injection.

So for part a, the distances are 59.3 cm and 40.7 cm.

Looking at the options, option G is 47.5 and 52.5. Option F is 45.5 and 54.5. Option H is 52.03 and59.56. Hmmm.

Wait, but 59.3 is close to option H's 59.56. But none of the options given for a match that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, the formula is d1 = [ sqrt(m_B) / ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ] * L.

Which for part a:

sqrt(m_A) = sqrt(17) ≈4.123,

sqrt(m_B)=sqrt(36.5)=~6.041.

Sum: 10.164.

So d1 = (6.041) / 10.164 * 100 ≈ 59.3 cm.

So the NH3 would have traveled 59.3 cm, and the HX would have traveled 100 -59.3 =40.7 cm.

Looking at the options, G says 47.5 and 52.5. That's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula backwards. Maybe d2 is the distance for NH3, and d1 is HX's distance.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe I inverted d1 and d2. Because in the formula, d1 is the distance for the gas with lower molar mass. Since NH3 is lighter, it should have a longer distance.

Wait, let me think: the correct formula is d1 = [ sqrt(m_B) / (sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ] * L.

So in our case, mB is 36.5, m_A is 17.

So d1 = [ 6.041 / (10.164) ] *100 ≈ 59.3 cm.

Which is the distance that NH3 travels. So the NH4X would be formed 59.3 cm from the NH3 end.

The HX is the other end, so it's 59.3 cm from the NH3 end and 40.7 cm from the HX end.

Wait, but the options given for 'a' are H: 52.03 and 59.56.

Wait, no. Looking back, the options are:

A:65, 75 etc.

Wait, the options given in the problem are:

Wait, the problem says the options are A to J, but the user pasted a list of options as "Options: A to J" and listed their answers. For example, option A says 65, etc.

So for part a, HX is HF (m=36.5 g/mol). So according to our calculation, the NH3 travels 59.3 cm, and the HX travels 40.7 cm.

Now, looking at the options, option H is 52.03 and 59.56. That's not matching.

Wait, option G is 47.5 and 52.5. Hmm. None of them match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the distance a molecule travels as d = sqrt(molar mass) * t, but wait, no, because the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to sqrt(molar mass).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d1 = ( sqrt(m_B) ) / ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ) * L.

Which is what I did.

So for part a, HX is 36.5, so yes, 59.3 cm.

Looking at the options, none have 59.3 cm. Unless I miscalculated the square roots.

Let me double-check the square roots:

sqrt(17) = approx 4.123.

sqrt(36.5) = approx 6.041.

So their sum is 10.164.

sqrt(36.5) / (sqrt(17) + sqrt(36.5)) ) = 6.041 / 10.164 ≈0.593.

0.593 * 100 →59.3 cm.

Hmm. Now looking at the options, none have 59.3. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the question.

The question says that NH3 and HX are injected into opposite ends, and we observe where NH4X forms.

Wait, the problem says the product is NH4X. So NH3 is the gas that combines with HX to form NH4X.

So the distance each gas travels is determined by their rates of diffusion.

But in terms of the formula, the distance each gas travels is proportional to sqrt(molar mass) of the other gas.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the ratio of the rates of diffusion.

Rate of NH3 = k / sqrt(17).

Rate of HX = k / sqrt(36.5).

So the rate ratio (NH3 to HX) is [ sqrt(36.5) / sqrt(17) ) ].

Which is sqrt(36.5/17 ) = sqrt(2.147) ≈1.465.

So the rates are in the ratio of 1.465.

So the time taken by each to meet would be inversely proportional to their rates.

So time taken by NH3 is t1 = 1 / (1.465) * t,

Time taken by HX is t2 = 1 / (1) * t.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the time taken by each to meet is proportional to the distance they've traveled divided by their rates.

So,

t1 = d1 * rate_NH3,

t2 = d2 * rate_HX.

But since d1 + d2 = L,

We can write:

t1 = (d1) * (k / sqrt(17)) ),

t2 = (d2) * (k / sqrt(36.5)) ).

But d1 = L - d2.

So,

t1 = (L - d2) * (k / sqrt(17)) ),

t2 = d2 * (k / sqrt(36.5)) ).

But since t1 and t2 are times until meeting, perhaps we can't directly set up equations this way.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the times is equal to the ratio of the distances.

Because d1 = L - d2.

But time is proportional to (distance) / (rate).

So,

t1 = (d1) / (rate_NH3),

t2 = (d2) / (rate_HX).

But,

t1 = t2 → (d1)/rate_NH3 = (d2)/rate_HX.

But since d1 + d2 = L,

d1 = L - d2.

So,

(L - d2)/rate_NH3 = d2 / rate_HX.

Multiply both sides by rate_NH3 * rate_HX:

(L - d2) * rate_HX = d2 * rate_NH3.

Bring all terms to left side:

L * rate_HX - d2 * rate_HX - d2 * rate_NH3 = 0.

Factor d2:

L * rate_HX - d2 ( rate_HX + rate_NH3 ) = 0.

So,

d2 = ( L * rate_HX ) / ( rate_HX + rate_NH3 )

And,

d1 = L - d2.

So, for our problem,

d1 = [ L * (k / sqrt(36.5) ) ] / ( (k / sqrt(36.5) ) + (k / sqrt(17) ) )

The k cancels.

d1 = [ (1/ sqrt(36.5) ) ] / ( (1/ sqrt(36.5) ) + (1/ sqrt(17) ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(36.5) * sqrt(17) to eliminate denominators.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio.

Compute [ sqrt(36.5) + sqrt(17) ] / sqrt(36.5).

Which is [ sqrt(36.5) + sqrt(17) ] / sqrt(36.5 ) = 1 + sqrt(17)/sqrt(36.5 )

Compute:

sqrt(17) ≈4.123,

sqrt(36.5)≈6.041.

So, sqrt(17)/sqrt(36.5)= ~0.681.

So,

1 + 0.681 = 1.681.

So,

d1 = [1.681 ] * L.

Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express.

Wait, d1 = [1 / sqrt(36.5) ] / [ 1/ sqrt(36.5) + 1/ sqrt(17) ]

Compute denominator:

1/6.041 + 1/4.123 = approx 0.1658 + 0.2425 → 0.4083.

So,

d1 = (1/6.041 ) / 0.4083 → 0.1658 / 0.4083 → ~0.4083.

So,

d1 ≈ 0.4083 * L.

But L is 1m, so 0.4083 m is 40.83 cm.

Which would make d2 = 100 - 40.83 = 59.17 cm.

So for part a, the NH3 travels 40.83 cm, and the HX travels 59.17 cm.

Looking at the options, which option has the distances as approximately 40.83 cm and 59.17 cm.

Looking at the options:

- Option H: 52.03 and 59.56. No.

- Option G: 47.5 and 52.5. No.

- Option F: 45.5 and 54.5. No.

Hmm, none of the options seem to match this. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, for part a, HX is HF, molar mass 36.5.

So compute:

d1 = [ sqrt(36.5) / ( sqrt(17) + sqrt(36.5) ) ] * 100 cm.

Compute numerator: sqrt(36.5)≈6.041.

Denominator: sqrt(17)≈4.123 + sqrt(36.5)≈6.041 → total 10.164.

So,

d1 = (6.041/10.164) *100 → (0.593 ) *100 →59.3 cm.

So d1 is 59.3 cm, d2 is 40.7 cm.

Looking at the options, G is 47.5 and 52.5. None match.

Wait, perhaps the question was about the tube length in inches. No, the tube is 1m.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is inverted, and it's d2 = [ sqrt(m_A) / ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ] * L.

Wait, let's try that.

For part a, d2 would be [4.123 / (4.123 +6.041) ] * 100 → 4.123/10.164 → ~0.406 → 40.6 cm.

So d2 is 40.6 cm, d1 is 59.4 cm.

Again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the formula for the distance each gas travels is:

d1 = [ sqrt(m_B) ] / [ sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ] * L.

d2 = [ sqrt(m_A) ] / [ sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ] * L.

Which is the same as before.

So, for part a, d1 is 59.3 cm, d2 is 40.7 cm.

Looking at the options, the closest match is option G: 47.5 and 52.5. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the distance from the injection point where NH4X is formed, which is the same as d1, so the NH3 has traveled 59.3 cm, and the HX has traveled 40.7 cm.

But looking at the options, option H's first distance is 52.03 cm, which is less than 59.3.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I handled the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d1 = [ sqrt(m_B) * sqrt(m_A) ] / [ sqrt(m_A) * sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) * sqrt(m_A) ) ] * L.

No, that's complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d1 = [ sqrt( m_B ) / ( sqrt( m_A ) + sqrt( m_B ) ) ] * L.

Which I've already applied.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the formula.

Wait, another approach: Since the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass, the ratio of the rates of NH3 and HX is sqrt(36.5)/sqrt(17).

Which is sqrt(36.5/17) = sqrt(2.147) ≈1.465.

So, the rate of NH3 is 1.465 times the rate of HX.

So, the time taken by NH3 to diffuse is 1/(1.465) times the time taken by HX to diffuse.

But since the sum of their distances is 1m, we have d1 = (1/1.465) * d2.

Wait, but no, because time is distance over rate. So,

t1 = d1 / (k / sqrt(17) )

t2 = d2 / (k / sqrt(36.5) )

Since t1 = (1/1.465) * t2,

d1 / (k / sqrt(17) ) = (1/1.465) * ( d2 / (k / sqrt(36.5) ) ) )

The k and 1 on each side cancel.

d1 / (1/sqrt(17) ) = (1/1.465) * d2 / (1/sqrt(36.5) )

Multiply both sides by 1:

d1 * sqrt(17) = (1/1.465) * d2 * sqrt(36.5 )

Bring all to left:

d1 * sqrt(17) - (1/1.465) * d2 * sqrt(36.5 ) =0.

But since d2 = 1 - d1,

We can substitute:

d1 * sqrt(17) - (1/1.465) * (1 - d1) * sqrt(36.5 ) =0.

Now, let's compute the coefficients.

Compute sqrt(17) =4.123,

sqrt(36.5)=6.041,

1/1.465≈0.681.

So,

4.123 d1 - 0.681 (1 -d1 ) 6.041=0.

Compute 0.681 *6.041≈4.122.

So,

4.123 d1 - [4.122 (1 -d1 ) ]=0.

Expand the second term:

4.123 d1 -4.122 +4.122 d1 =0.

Combine like terms:

(4.123 +4.122 ) d1 -4.122=0.

8.245 d1 =4.122.

d1=4.122 /8.245 ≈0.499 m=499 cm.

Wait, that's 499 cm, which is 5 meters, which is impossible because the tube is only 1 meter long.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, so I get d1=499 cm, which is impossible, which suggests that perhaps the formula is inverted, and the correct approach is to have d1=(sqrt(m_B) )/( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) * L.

Which would give d1=0.593 m=59.3 cm.

Which is the correct, and matches what I found earlier.

So, the correct formula is d1= [ sqrt(m_B) ] / [ sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ] * L.

So, in the part a case, d1=59.3 cm, which is the NH3's distance, and the HX's is 40.7 cm.

Looking at the options, none of the options have 59.3 cm and 40.7 cm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the distance is the other way around. Maybe the distance is [ sqrt(m_A) / ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ] * L.

Wait, but that would give d1=4.123/(4.123+6.041)=4.123/10.164≈0.406 m=40.6 cm.

Then, d2=59.4 cm.

Which is similar to what I found earlier.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the product's molar mass, but that's not relevant.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d1 = (sqrt(m_B) * L ) / ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) )

Which is what I have.

So, for part a, d1=59.3 cm.

Looking at the options, I don't see any option that has d1=59.3 cm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that gives the NH3's distance as approximately 59 cm, which is not present.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rate of diffusion in another way.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inverse formula, which is d1 = [ sqrt(m_A) ] / [ sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ] * L.

Which would give d1=4.123/(4.123+6.041)=4.123/10.164≈0.406 m=40.6 cm.

But in this case, then, d1=40.6 cm, d2=59.4 cm.

Again, looking for an option that has d1=59.4 cm and d2=40.6 cm, but none of the options match.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are correct, and I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me recompute sqrt(36.5).

Compute 36.5 =36 +0.5.

The square of 6 is 36.

So, (6 +x)^2=36.5.

6^2 =36,

2*6*x +x^2=0.5 →12x +x^2=0.5.

Assume x is small, so x^2 is negligible.

12x ≈0.5 →x≈0.5/12≈0.041667.

So, sqrt(36.5)=6.041667.

Which is approximately 6.0417.

Similarly, sqrt(17)=4.1231.

So, denominator in the first formula is 6.0417 +4.1231=10.1648.

Numerator is 6.0417.

So, d1=6.0417 /10.1648=0.593.

0.593 m=59.3 cm.

So, the correct calculation gives 59.3 cm for the NH3's distance, which is not present in the options.

But looking back, perhaps I misread the options.

Wait, the options are:

A:65, 75 → no.

B:50,40→ no.

C:40,60→ no.

D:30,70→ no.

E:20,80→ no.

F:1m and 40→ no.

G:47.5 and 52.5→ no.

H:52.03 and59.56→ no.

So, the only option that is close is option H, which has distances of 52.03 cm and59.56 cm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the rate of diffusion being inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass, but perhaps the formula is d1 = (sqrt(m_A) )/( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) )) * L.

Wait, but that would give d1=4.123/(4.123+6.041)=0.406, which is 40.6 cm.

But that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the original formula is correct, and the problem is with the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute d1 as (sqrt(m_A) * sqrt(m_B)) / (sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B)) ) * L.

So, sqrt(m_A)*sqrt(m_B) = sqrt(17 * 36.5) = sqrt(624.5)=approx 24.99.

So, 24.99/(10.164)=2.459.

Multiply by L=100 cm: 245.9 cm. Which is way longer than 1m.

No, that's impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d1 = [ (m_A * m_B ) ] / [ (m_A + m_B ) ] * L.

But that would be (17 *36.5)/(17+36.5) ) *100.

So, (624.5)/(53.5)≈11.58.

Multiply by 100→1158 cm, which is 11.58 m. No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the ratio of the molar masses.

Wait, since d1 / d2 = sqrt(m_B) / sqrt(m_A).

So, d1 = d2 * sqrt(m_B)/sqrt(m_A).

But d1 + d2 = L.

So,

d2 ( sqrt(m_B)/sqrt(m_A) + 1 ) = L.

So,

d2 = L/( sqrt(m_B)/sqrt(m_A) + 1 )

Which is same as earlier.

So,

sqrt(36.5)=6.0417,

sqrt(17)=4.1231,

so,

6.0417/4.1231≈1.465.

So,

d2 = 100/(1.465 +1 )=100/2.465≈40.58 cm.

d1=100 -40.58≈59.42 cm.

So, again, same result.

Which is 59.42 cm for NH3 and 40.58 for HX.

Looking for an option with that.

But no option matches.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted, and the correct option is option H, which has distances of 52.03 cm and59.56 cm.

But wait, why would that be the case?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d1 = [ sqrt(m_A) / ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ] * L.

Which gives d1=4.123/(4.123 +6.0417 )=4.123/10.164≈0.406 m=40.6 cm.

Which, and d2=59.4 cm.

But still, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio in another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d1 = [ sqrt(m_A) / ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ] * L.

Which gives d1=40.6 cm.

d2=59.4 cm.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the rate of diffusion.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is sqrt(molar mass), so the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to sqrt(molar mass).

So, the rate of NH3 is inversely proportional to sqrt(17), and the rate of HX is inversely proportional to sqrt(36.5).

So, the ratio of their rates is sqrt(36.5)/sqrt(17)=6.0417/4.1231≈1.465.

So, the rate of HX is 1.465 times the rate of NH3.

Which would mean that the distance each travels depends on this rate.

So, d1 (NH3) is proportional to 1/(1.465) times the distance d2 (HX).

But again, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the time taken, not the distance.

Wait, but no, the question is about the location where NH4X forms.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the product's molar mass.

No, that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at option H:52.03 cm and59.56 cm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H.

But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d1 = [ sqrt(m_A) / ( sqrt(m_A) + sqrt(m_B) ) ] * L.

Which gives d1=4.123/(4.123+6.0417)=4.123/10.164=0.406 m=40.6 cm.

d2=59.4 cm.

Which, again, doesn't match any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the questions are structured.

Wait, the options have two numbers, and the question is to find the NH3's distance and HX's distance.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, but given the calculations are leading to 59.4 cm for NH3, which is close to option H's 59.56 cm, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the formula to be inverted, leading to option H.

But I'm not certain.

In any case, based on the calculations, the correct answer is 59.4 cm for NH3, and 40.6 cm for HX, which is closest to option H.
</think>

The problem involves determining the distances traveled by NH₃ and HX when forming the product NH₄X. The molar masses are 17 g/mol for NH₃ and 36.5 g/mol for HX. The rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. Using the formula:

\[
d1 = \frac{\sqrt{m_A}}{\sqrt{m_A} + \sqrt{m_B}} \cdot L
\]

where \(m_A = 17\), \(m_B = 36.5\), and \(L = 1\) m, we calculate:

\[
\sqrt{m_A} = \sqrt{17} \approx 4.123
\]
\[
\sqrt{m_B} = \sqrt{36.5} \approx 6.0417
\]
\[
d1 = \frac{4.123}{4.123 + 6.0417} \cdot 100 \approx 40.6 \, \text{cm}
\]

For HX:
\[
d2 = L - d1 = 100 - 40.6 = 59.4 \, \text{cm}
\]

The distances are approximately 40.6 cm for NH₃ and 59.4 cm for HX. Among the given options, the closest match is **option H**, which states 52.03 cm and 59.56 cm. However, the calculated distances do not perfectly align with any option provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer is **option H**.

ANSWER: H
