Okay, so I have this problem here about ice cream sales. Let me see what it's asking. So, the ice cream shop sold 48 vanilla milkshakes in a day, and that was 40% of the total milkshakes sold that day. I need to find out what the total number was. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right. So, if 48 is 40% of the total, I think I can set up an equation here. Let me denote the total number of milkshakes as T. So, 48 is 40% of T. That translates to 48 = 0.4 * T. 

Wait, is that right? Yeah, because 40% is the same as 0.4, and 40% of the total is 48. So, solving for T, I can divide both sides by 0.4. So, T = 48 / 0.4.

Let me calculate that. 48 divided by 0.4. Well, 40 divided by 0.4 is 100, because 0.4 times 100 is 40. So 48 is 8 more than 40. 8 divided by 0.4 is 20. So, 100 + 20 is 120. So, T = 120. 

Looking at the options, I see option C is 120. So that must be the answer. Let me double-check my math. 40% of 120 is 48, because 10% of 120 is 12, so 40% is 12*4=48. Yep, that makes sense. So the total number of milkshakes sold that day was 120, which is option C.

The total number of milkshakes sold is 120, which is option C.
