B: Continuous skills require more cognitive effort to recall
C: Neither are easy to remember
D: Continuous skills are not easily forgotten
E: Continuous skills are easier to remember because they are always performed in a consistent environment

Okay, so I need to figure out the difference between discrete and continuous motor tasks and determine which is easier to remember after time. Hmm, motor tasks can be a bit tricky, especially when it comes to remembering them.

Discrete motor tasks are those where you perform a set of movements in quick succession, like a series of jumps or spins. I remember that these are often called "quick reflexes" or "continuous tasks" if you're switching between them, but wait, no, discrete tasks are just a sequence of steps without switching. So, for example, doing a set of arm movements in a row, like a dance step.

On the other hand, continuous motor tasks involve repeating the same movement over and over again without stopping. Like a leg press you do every minute. These are more like repetitive movements, so they might be harder to remember because you're not changing your movements; you're doing the same one repeatedly.

Now, when it comes to memory, I think discrete tasks are easier to remember. Why? Because you're performing a specific movement sequence, which can be chunked into smaller parts. For instance, each jump can be part of a larger sequence, so you can mentally link them together. Also, continuous tasks might be more about repetition and might require more cognitive effort because each movement is a separate task in your brain. So, if you're doing a series of movements in quick succession, each one is a separate mental step, which can be harder to remember.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Discrete are harder to remember because complex. I think discrete is easier, not harder.

B: Continuous require more cognitive effort to recall. That seems correct because each movement is a separate task, so you have to remember each one, which might be harder.

C: Neither are easy. Unlikely, as I think discrete is easier.

D: Continuous not easily forgotten. No, continuous tasks are more likely to be forgotten because they're not used every day.

E: Continuous easier to remember because consistent. No, I think consistent is better for continuous tasks, but remember that continuous tasks are harder to remember because you're repeating the same movements.

F: Continuous harder because less repetitive. No, continuous tasks are more repetitive, so they're harder to remember.

G: Both become more precise over time. That's about skill development, not the initial difficulty of remembering.

H: Discrete become more precise. Again, skill development, not the initial difficulty.

I: Discrete easier to remember because sequence. Yes, that aligns with what I thought earlier.

J: Discrete not easily forgotten. No, continuous ones are more likely to forget.

So the correct answer should be I: Discrete skills are easier to remember because they involve a sequence of movements.

The difference between discrete and continuous motor tasks lies in their nature and ease of remembering. Discrete tasks involve performing a sequence of movements in quick succession, such as a series of arm movements, and are easier to remember because they involve chunking into smaller parts. Continuous tasks, on the other hand, involve repeating the same movement repeatedly, which are harder to remember due to the cognitive effort required to recall each individual movement.

**Answer:** I: Discrete skills are easier to remember because they involve a sequence of movements.
