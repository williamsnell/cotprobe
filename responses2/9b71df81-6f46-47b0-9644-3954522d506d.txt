Question:

Define `marginalism' (as used in economics).

Options:

A: Marginalism is the study of economic trends.
B: Marginalism is the method of analysis that assesses the impact of changes in production volume on total satisfaction.
C: Marginalism is the method of analysis focusing on the first unit in production.
D: Marginalism is the study of how market prices are established by the intersection of supply and demand curves.
E: Marginalism is the theory that all units in production have equal value.
F: Marginalism is the practice of increasing production by one unit to assess cost changes.
G: Marginalism is the concept that the value of a good is determined by its historical cost.
H: Marginalism is the method of analysis that concentrates attention on the last unit in production or consumption.
I: Marginalism is the method of analysis that ignores the last unit in production or consumption.
J: Marginalism is the economic principle that prioritizes the most abundant resources.

Okay, so I've got this question about marginalism in economics. I'm a bit fuzzy on the topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that marginalism has something to do with the value of goods and services. I think it's related to how much each additional unit contributes to total satisfaction. Wait, marginalism sounds like it's about marginal costs or marginal benefits. Oh right, marginalism in economics is the study of marginal costs and marginal benefits, which is about the value of one more unit compared to all others.

Looking at the options:

A: Study of trends. Hmm, not sure. Marginalism isn't just about trends; it's more about the value of one more unit.

B: Method assessing production volume changes. That sounds more like marginal analysis, but I'm not certain. Wait, B says it assesses the impact of changes in production on total satisfaction. So if production changes, how does it affect total satisfaction? That sounds more like marginalism.

C: Focusing on the first unit. No, marginalism is about the last unit or the incremental, not the first.

D: Market prices from supply and demand. No, that's supply and demand basics, not marginalism.

E: All units equal value. That doesn't make sense; marginalism suggests that each additional unit adds a certain value, not equal.

F: Increasing by one to assess costs. That sounds like marginal analysis, like marginal cost. Like, adding one more unit, what's the cost? That's a method.

G: Concept of historical cost. No, marginalism isn't about past costs. It's about current value.

H: Concentrates on last unit. No, marginalism is about the last unit's value. Wait, no, marginalism usually looks at the last unit, but the way it's phrased here... I'm not sure. The wording is a bit tricky.

Wait, option H says "concentrates attention on the last unit in production or consumption." That sounds right. Marginalism is about the last unit because you can't really assess the impact of adding another if you've already made it. So the marginal value is determined by the last unit.

Option F describes marginal analysis as assessing the impact of adding one more unit. So if you increase production by one unit, how does that affect total satisfaction? That's marginalism's main idea.

Another thought: marginalism is often associated with marginal cost and marginal benefit. So when you're deciding whether to produce an extra unit, you look at the marginal cost and marginal benefit. So, the method is about the last unit's value.

So looking at the options, option F says "Marginalism is the practice of increasing production by one unit to assess cost changes." That seems to match. It's about making one more unit and seeing the effects on costs. So F is the correct answer.

Other options don't fit as well. Like, none of the others describe marginalism accurately. For example, option H is correct because it's about the last unit. Option B is about production changes, but marginalism is about the marginal benefit from an extra unit, not the impact on total satisfaction from production changes.

Wait, option B says "the impact of changes in production volume on total satisfaction." That's more about how production affects satisfaction, which is the same as marginalism. But I think the key is that marginalism is the method of analysis that assesses the impact of changes in production volume on total satisfaction. So option B's wording is correct but perhaps it's more about the method of analysis for the impact of production changes.

Alternatively, H is more specific, saying it's about the last unit. But the question is a bit ambiguous. I think the best fit is H because marginalism is about the value of the last unit. So I'm going to choose option H.

The correct answer is H: Marginalism is the method of analysis that concentrates attention on the last unit in production or consumption.

**Answer: H**
