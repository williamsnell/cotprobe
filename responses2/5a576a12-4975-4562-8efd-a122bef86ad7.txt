Okay, so I have this question about common divisors of two integers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that an integer c is a common divisor of two integers x and y if and only if c is a divisor of x and c is a divisor of y. Wait, but in my notes, I remember that the set of common divisors includes all such c's. So, the question is asking which of the given options could be the set of all common divisors of some pair of integers x and y.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each option lists a set of integers. I think the key here is to find the set that could be the common divisors of two numbers. Let me recall that the set of common divisors is the same as the set of divisors of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y. Because any common divisor of x and y must divide their gcd.

Wait, but the problem says that the set must be all common divisors. So the set must include every divisor of the gcd. So, the correct set should be the set of all divisors of some number d, where d is the gcd of x and y.

So, let's analyze each option.

Option A: {-10, -5, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10}. Hmm, that includes 0 as well. Wait, but can 0 be a common divisor? I don't think so. Because, by definition, a common divisor must divide both x and y without leaving a remainder. But any number divided by zero is undefined, so 0 can't be a common divisor. So option A is probably incorrect because it includes 0.

Option B: {-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6}. Again, 0 is present. So this can't be right for the same reason as A. So B is out.

Option C: {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}. Let me list them: -6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6. Wait, but if I think about the divisors, the absolute values are 1, 2, 3, 6. So the positives and negatives. But, the absolute values are 1, 2, 3, 6. The set includes all their divisors, including 1, 2, 3, 6, their negatives, and also 0. Wait, but wait, 0 is not included. So this set includes 0, so it can't be correct because common divisors can't include 0. So C is also out.

Wait, wait, wait. So if the set includes 1, 2, 3, 6, then the gcd of x and y must be 6. Because the set of common divisors would be all the divisors of 6, including negatives. So, the set would be { -6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6 } but without 0. So looking at the options, option C is exactly that set. But wait, does that include 0? No, because 0 is not present. So that's a problem.

Wait, but in option C, 0 is not present. So perhaps option C is wrong because the set includes 0. So that can't be the set of all common divisors. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Option D: {-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6}. Again, 0 is in the set, so it can't be correct. So D is out.

Wait, that's confusing because all the options include 0, which can't be a common divisor. But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait a minute: the set includes 0, but if any x and y have 0 as a common divisor, then 0 divides both x and y. But that's impossible because 0 can't divide any number except 0 itself. So any pair of integers x and y can't have 0 as a common divisor if x or y is non-zero. But wait, the question says that c is a common divisor if and only if c divides x and y. But 0 can't divide any number because division by zero is undefined. So 0 can't be a divisor, meaning that the set of common divisors cannot include 0. So all options A, B, C, D include 0, so they all can't be correct. But that's impossible because the question asks which of the options could possibly be the set.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial reasoning. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, the question is which set could possibly be the set of all common divisors. So perhaps the set includes all possible common divisors, including 0. But no, that's impossible because 0 can't be a divisor. So all options are invalid except maybe those that don't include 0. But all the options include 0, so that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I have a wrong understanding of common divisors. Let me check. A common divisor of x and y is any integer c such that c divides x and c divides y. But c must be a non-zero integer. Because 0 divides nothing, except 0 itself, so 0 can't be a common divisor. So any set of common divisors must not include 0. But all the options include 0, so none of them can be correct. But the question gives options, so perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again. The options are A, B, C, D. Each has 0. Let me check each option.

Option A includes 0. So, any pair x and y can't have 0 as a common divisor, so this can't be the set.

Option B: same problem.

Option C: same problem.

Option D: same problem.

Wait, this can't be right because the question is asking which of the options could possibly be the set of all common divisors. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe the set includes 0 because 0 is a common divisor in some cases. But no, that's not possible. So maybe the correct approach is to realize that the set must consist of numbers that are all divisors of a certain number, and in addition, that number must be the gcd of x and y.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which set is closed under taking all divisors. Because the set of common divisors of x and y is exactly the set of divisors of their gcd.

So the set of common divisors must be the set of all divisors of some integer d. That is, the set must be { ±d, ±(d/2), ..., ±1, 0 } but wait, no, 0 is not included. So the set has to be the set of all divisors of d, including ±1, ±2, etc., but not 0.

So, looking back at the options, each has 0, which we can't have, so all options are invalid, which can't be the case because the question must have a correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-examine the options. Oh wait, perhaps I missed that one of the options doesn't include 0 and is a possible set. Let me check.

Wait, no, all options include 0. So perhaps the problem lies elsewhere. Let me think: maybe the set isn't exactly the set of all divisors of a number d, but includes all possible divisors, including 0. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding what a common divisor is. Because 0 can't be a common divisor, so the set must exclude 0.

So all options are wrong except perhaps none, which can't be because the question must have an answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct set is the set of all common divisors (excluding 0) of some x and y. But the options all include 0, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the question again. The correct set is the set of all common divisors of two integers. So each option is a possible set, but the actual correct set must consist of all the divisors of some number d, including 1 and -1, but excluding 0.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes 1, 2, 5, 10, but also -10, etc. But 0 is present. So can't be correct.

Option B: 1, 2, 6, etc., but 0 is there. So no.

Option C: 1, 2, 3, 6, and their negatives, but no 0. So if a pair x and y have a gcd of 6, their common divisors would be { ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6 }, which is exactly what option C has. So that's the correct set.

Wait, but why is 0 not included? Oh, because 0 can't be a common divisor. So the set can't include 0. So option C, which includes 0, is incorrect.

Wait, that's a contradiction because option C is the only one without 0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The correct set of common divisors is exactly the set of all divisors of the gcd of x and y. So for example, if the gcd is 6, then the common divisors are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. So option C is correct because it includes all those, except 0.

But wait, the option C has 0, so it's not correct. So I'm confused again.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of a specific example. Let's say x = 6 and y = 6. Then the common divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6 and their negatives, but 0 isn't a divisor. So the set would be { -6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6 }, which is exactly option C. So that's correct.

But option C includes 0, so how can it be a correct set? Because, as per the problem statement, 0 can't be a common divisor. So option C is invalid.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read the question again.

The question is: "An integer c is a common divisor of two integers x and y if and only if c is a divisor of x and c is a divisor of y." So for any x and y, c is a common divisor iff c divides both. So the set of common divisors must exclude 0.

So the correct set must be the set of all divisors of some d, excluding 0. So looking at the options, which one is a possible set of all common divisors, excluding 0.

Looking at option C: { -6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6 } — that's all the divisors of 6, including negatives, but missing 0. So that's correct.

But wait, the question says, "could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers." So option C is the correct one.

Wait, but wait. The options given are A, B, C, D. Each includes 0. So perhaps the correct answer is option C because it's the only one without 0. But why is option C the correct one?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused between the set of common divisors (excluding 0) and the set of all possible c's that are common. But according to the problem statement, the set includes all c's that are common. So if the set includes 0, it's incorrect. So all options have 0, which can't be a common divisor. So the correct answer must be the set without 0. So the only option without 0 is option C.

Wait, but the problem is that all options include 0, so they can't be correct. But that's impossible because the question must have an answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the set of all common divisors (excluding 0) of x and y is the same as the set of all divisors of their gcd. So, the set must be the set of all divisors of some d, except 0.

So, the correct options are those that are exactly the set of all divisors of some d, except including 0. So, looking at the options, which one is exactly the set of all divisors of some d.

Looking at option C: { -6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6 }. So, these are all the divisors of 6, except 0. So if x and y are 6 and 6, then their common divisors are exactly those. So option C is correct.

Wait, but the question says which is the set of all common divisors. So, option C is correct. But why are other options including 0, which can't be a common divisor? Because the question's options include 0, which can't be a correct set.

So, the answer is C. But in the initial options, all include 0, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's the only option without 0, but that's not correct because 0 can't be a common divisor. So perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's take each option and see if it's possible to be the set of common divisors.

Option A includes 0, which can't be, so A is invalid.

Option B includes 0, invalid.

Option C includes 0, invalid.

Option D includes 0, invalid.

Wait, so none of the options are correct, but the question says one of them is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again about the problem.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because it's the only one that doesn't include 0. But I'm not certain because the question says that 0 can't be a common divisor, so all options are incorrect. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem and the correct set is not including 0. So the correct set must be the set of all divisors of some d, including 1 and -1, but not 0.

So, looking at the options, option C is the only one that is exactly the set of all divisors of 6 (excluding 0). So it must be the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is **C**. 

**Explanation:**
A common divisor \( c \) of two integers \( x \) and \( y \) must divide both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder. Since 0 cannot be a divisor (as division by zero is undefined), the set of common divisors must exclude 0. 

Option C lists all the divisors of 6 (including negative values) without 0, which aligns with the definition. The other options include 0, which is invalid as a common divisor. Therefore, option C is the only valid set of common divisors.
