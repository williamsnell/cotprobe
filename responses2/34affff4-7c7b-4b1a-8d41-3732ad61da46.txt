Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about cyclotron orbits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question is asking for the radius of the cyclotron orbit, also known as the gyroradius, given a magnetic field of 1 weber per square meter, a velocity of 1e6 m/s, and the velocity direction is normal to the magnetic field. 

Wait, I remember that the formula for the gyroradius involves the momentum of the particle, the charge, the mass, and the magnetic field strength. Oh right, the formula is r = (mv)/(qB). Oh wait, but wait—wait, wait. Oh wait, no, the exact formula is r = (mv) / (qB), but I think it depends on the unit system. Because in some cases, you have to consider the units of mass, charge, and so on.

Wait, but wait: the magnetic field, B, is given in weber per square meter, which is the same as tesla (since 1 T is 1 Wb/m²). So we can use SI units here.

Wait, but wait. The formula for the radius of the circular path of a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by r = (m v)/(e B), where e is the charge of the electron. Oh, but wait, that would be the case if the charge is in coulombs. But wait, wait—charge is in coulombs, mass in kilograms, volts/(m²) is tesla, which is the same as kg·m/(s²·A), but perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, no, the formula for the radius is r = (mv) / (eB), but wait, that's when the velocity is perpendicular to B. In this problem, the velocity is already given as normal to B, so that condition is met. So I think the formula applies.

So the variables are:
m is the mass of the electron.
v is 1e6 m/s.
B is 1 Wb/m² → 1 T.
e is the charge of the electron, which is 1.6e-19 C.

Wait, but wait, the mass of the electron is about 9.11e-31 kg. Right.

So plugging in the numbers:

r = (m * v) / (e * B)
r = (9.11e-31 kg * 1e6 m/s) / (1.6e-19 C * 1 T)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, numerator: 9.11e-31 * 1e6 = 9.11e-25 kg·m/s.

Denominator: 1.6e-19 * 1 = 1.6e-19 C·T. Wait, but since B is in T (tesla) and e is in C, and 1 T is kg/(C·s), the units would be kg·m/(s·C·s) → kg·m/(s²·C). But the numerator is kg·m/s. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of units.

Wait, the formula r = (m v)/(e B) is correct because:

m is in kg, v in m/s, so m*v is kg·m/s. e is coulombs, B is tesla (kg/(C·s)). So (e B) is (C * kg/(C·s)) ) → kg/(s).

So (m*v)/(e B) = (kg·m/s) / (kg/s) ) → m. So the units are correct.

Now, computing numerically:

r = (9.11e-31 kg * 1e6 m/s) / (1.6e-19 C * 1 T)

Wait, let me compute each part.

Compute numerator: 9.11e-31 * 1e6 = 9.11e-25 kg·m/s.

Denominator: 1.6e-19 C * 1 T = 1.6e-19 C·T.

But T is kg/(C·s), so denominator becomes 1.6e-19 C * (kg/(C·s)) ) → 1.6e-19 kg/s.

So r = (9.11e-25) / (1.6e-19) → let's compute that division.

9.11e-25 / 1.6e-19 = (9.11 / 1.6) * 1e(-25+19) → 5.69375 * 1e-6 → approximately 5.694e-6 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are all around 1.8e-6 m and up. Wait, but 5.69e-6 is about 5.7e-6 m, which is option H: 5.7 × 10^-6 m.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the formula. Oh, wait! Because sometimes formulae can have a 2pi factor, but in this case, the question says the radius is the gyroradius, which is the radius of the circular path. So the formula I used is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait! The formula for the cyclotron radius is actually r = (mv)/(eB) only for particles with mass m, charge e, moving perpendicular to B. In this case, the velocity is perpendicular, so that's correct.

So I think the calculation I did is correct, and the radius should be approximately 5.7e-6 m, which is option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 5.7 × 10^-6 m. So that's the answer.

To determine the radius of the cyclotron orbit for an electron traveling with a velocity of \(10^6 \, \text{m/s}\) in a magnetic field of \(1 \, \text{Wb/m}^2\) (or \(1 \, \text{T}\)), we use the formula for the gyroradius:

\[
r = \frac{m v}{e B}
\]

Where:
- \(m\) is the mass of the electron (\(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\)),
- \(v\) is the velocity of the electron (\(10^6 \, \text{m/s}\)),
- \(e\) is the charge of the electron (\(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)),
- \(B\) is the magnetic field strength (\(1 \, \text{T}\)).

### Step 1: Calculate the numerator
\[
m v = (9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}) \times (10^6 \, \text{m/s}) = 9.11 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
\[
e B = (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}) \times (1 \, \text{T}) = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C·T}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the radius
\[
r = \frac{m v}{e B} = \frac{9.11 \times 10^{-25}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}.
\]

Performing the division:
\[
r = \frac{9.11}{1.6} \times 10^{-25 + 19} = 5.69375 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated radius is approximately \(5.7 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\), which corresponds to option **H**.
