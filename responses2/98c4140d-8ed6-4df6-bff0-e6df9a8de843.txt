Question:

What is cognitive dissonance as explained byFestinger?

Options:

A: Cognitive dissonance is a learning theory that describes the process by which people adapt their behavior to match their intentions
B: Cognitive dissonance is a condition where an individual experiences difficulty in decision-making due to the presence of too many choices
C: Cognitive dissonance is a motivational theory that suggests individuals are driven to change their attitudes when they experience positive reinforcement
D: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about memory retention
E: Cognitive dissonance is a state of mind where an individual is completely aware and accepting of their conflicting attitudes
F: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about emotional stability
G: Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon where an individual's beliefs are in harmony with their actions at all times
H: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about personality traits
I: Cognitive dissonance is a theory that states that cognitions can have one of three relations to one another - consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant. Dissonant cognitions result in contradictory behaviors, and the experience of dissonance is a negative motivational state that aims at reducing the dissonance.
J: Cognitive dissonance is a social theory that explains the dynamics of group decision-making

Okay, so I have this question about cognitive dissonance and which option correctly explains it as explained by Festinger. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that cognitive dissonance is something to do with behavioral economics, right? Festinger was a philosopher who wrote a lot about socialization and how people change their behavior based on the beliefs of others. So, let me think about what he said about it.

Festinger's theory, I think, is about how people's behavior can change even if their intentions remain the same. Like, if someone is supposed to be happy but ends up being unhappy, they might try to change their behavior. This is called the "sixth sense" or "sixth sense" theory. So, it's about the conflict between a person's current behavior and their underlying preferences or values.

Looking at the options, option I sounds like it's exactly what Festinger was explaining. He discussed how people adjust their behavior based on the beliefs of others, which can lead to changing behavior even if the underlying intention isn't changed. So option I talks about cognitive dissonance being a theory where cognitive relations can be consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant, and dissonant ones lead to negative states.

Wait, let me check the other options to make sure. Option A says cognitive dissonance is about adapting behavior to match intentions. That seems more like an explanation of why it's a theory, but it's not the theory itself. Option B says it's a condition of difficulty with too many choices. That's more like a behavioral issue, not Festinger's theory. Option C is about being driven by positive reinforcement. That doesn't fit either. Option D talks about memory retention. No, that's not related. Option E mentions being aware of conflicting attitudes. That's about the state of mind, not the theory. Option F is about emotional stability, which is more psychological. Option G is about harmony with actions, which doesn't sound familiar. Option H talks about three relations to cognition, which I think relates to Festinger's theory but maybe I'm mixing it up. Option J is about group decision-making, which is more about social dynamics than theory.

So, putting it all together, option I seems to be the best fit. Festinger's theory explains how cognitive dissonance is a concept where people adjust their behavior based on the beliefs of others, leading to changes in behavior even if their intentions don't change. His work emphasizes how social influence can shift behavior, even if the underlying motivations remain the same.

The correct answer is option I, as it accurately describes Festinger's theory on how cognitive dissonance is a theoretical framework explaining the behavioral adjustments based on social influences.
