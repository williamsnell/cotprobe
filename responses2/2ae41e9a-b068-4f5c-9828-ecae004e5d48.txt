The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

It's silly to pass laws against discrimination, since it is obvious that we can't live without it. We discriminate between pleasant and unpleasant tastes in selecting our food, between pleasant and unpleasant sounds in selecting our music, between harmonious and unharmonious colors in decorating our homes, between interesting and uninteresting people in choosing our friends, and so on. We can't live without discriminating.

Options:

A: Prejudicial Language
B: Equivocation
C: Inconsistency
D: Straw Man

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the last line: "We can't live without discriminating." The options are A through J, but the options are only A to D, as the user says. Wait, looking back, the options are A, B, C, D, and then E to J, but the user's question ends before that. So the options are A: Prejudicial Language, B: Equivocation, C: Inconsistency, D: Straw Man.

Hmm, the passage the question is based on says that we can't live without discriminating. It then explains why we do that by giving examples like food, music, home decoration, choosing friends, etc. So it's about the necessity of discrimination.

Looking at the options, let's think about what each means.

Option A: Prejudicial Language. That sounds like language that conveys prejudice or discrimination. So it's about the language used to express that there's a moral wrong in discrimination.

Option B: Equivocation. I think that's when a statement is vague or uses ambiguous terms. It allows for multiple interpretations.

Option C: Inconsistency. That's when statements don't align or are contradictory.

Option D: Straw Man. That's a logical fallacy where someone presents an argument in such a way that the argument being attacked is irrelevant or weak, so it's restated as if it were a simpler argument for easier refutation.

The question is about the necessity of discrimination. The passage uses "we can't live without discriminating," which implies that it's a fundamental human need. The options need to fit this.

Prejudicial Language (A) seems to fit because it's about the language used to describe discrimination. Equivocation (B) is about using vague terms, which might not directly relate. Inconsistency (C) is about conflicting statements, which the passage doesn't mention. Straw Man (D) is more about the structure of an argument, not the necessity.

So the correct answer should be A: Prejudicial Language. It refers to the language used to express the necessity of discrimination, which the passage supports.

The passage emphasizes the necessity of discrimination as a fundamental human need, best captured by "Prejudicial Language."
