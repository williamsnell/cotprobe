Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what it says.

The question is about calculating the heat transferred when 250J of work is done on a system that has 1 mole of an ideal gas. It also mentions that the temperature is constant, and the change in internal energy (ΔE) for the expansion of an ideal gas is zero. Hmm, wait, but wait, no, that might not be right. Oh, wait, no. Wait, for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal expansion, the change in internal energy is zero because internal energy depends only on temperature. Oh right, because for an ideal gas, ΔU = nCvΔT. If T is constant, ΔU is zero.

Wait, so the system here is undergoing an expansion. But the system is a gas. So if the temperature is constant, the internal energy doesn't change. So ΔE is zero.

But wait, the system is the gas, right? So the system is the gas. The question is about the heat transferred. Oh, but wait, when work is done on the system, that's positive work. Because work done on the system is considered positive in the first law.

Wait, the first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = Q + W, but sometimes it's written as Q = ΔU - W. Wait, no, I think the standard formula is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. Oh wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, let me think: in physics, the first law is ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. Because if work is done on the system, the system's internal energy increases. If the system does work on the surroundings, W is negative.

So in this question, it's 250J of work is done on the system. So W is positive 250 J. Because work done on the system is positive in the sign convention.

But wait, let me double-check. The first law is often written as ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the system is undergoing an isothermal expansion. For an ideal gas, the heat transfer Q is equal to the work done on the system. Because, when the system does work (expands), it loses internal energy. But wait, wait. Wait, the system is doing work, so the system's internal energy decreases (since ΔU is zero), so the heat must be negative. Or wait, wait, no.

Wait, for an ideal gas, at constant temperature, the internal energy doesn't change. So ΔU is zero.

The first law is ΔU = Q + W.

But here, W is the work done on the system. So if the system does work on the surroundings (expansion), the work is negative (since the system is losing energy). Or wait, wait, no. If work is done on the system, W is positive. If the system does work (like when it expands), then W would be negative in this convention.

Wait, let's clarify. The first law equation is:

ΔU = Q + W,

where W is the work done on the system. So if the system does work (like when it expands), W is negative. Because the system is losing energy as work is done on the surroundings.

But in this case, the system is expanding. Wait, no, wait. The question says 250 J of work is done on the system. So the system is getting work from outside, so W (work done on the system) is positive. So W = +250 J.

Wait, but at the same time, the internal energy change ΔU is zero. Because it's isothermal. So 0 = Q + W.

Wait, so 0 = Q + 250. Then Q = -250 J.

Oh wait, but that's a negative value. So the heat transferred is Q = -250 J. But wait, what's the sign convention here? Because heat transfer into the system is positive or negative?

Wait, in this equation, Q is the heat added to the system. So if the system is losing heat, Q is negative. Since the system is doing work (expansion), but the work is done on the system. So in that case, the system is losing energy, so it's releasing heat.

Wait, but for an ideal gas expanding isothermally, the heat transfer is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the work done on it.

Wait, but wait, according to the first law, ΔU = Q + W. Since ΔU is zero, Q = -W. So Q would be -250 J.

But wait, no, because W here is the work done on the system. So if the system is doing work (expansion), W would be negative. Because work done on the system is positive. So for expansion, W (work done on system) is negative. So then, W = -250 J.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify the sign conventions. Let's define:

- Work done BY the system is considered negative when using the formula ΔU = Q + W. Wait, no, some sources define W as work done on the system, so when work is done on the system, it's positive.

Alternatively, another approach: when work is done on the system, it's positive. So when the system does work (expels heat or expands), W is negative.

But in the case of an ideal gas expanding isothermally, the system is doing work. So the work done by the system is positive, so the work done on the system is negative.

Wait, no, the system is the gas. It's undergoing expansion, which means work is done by the system. So the work that the system does on the surroundings is positive. So the work done on the system is negative.

So, W (work done ON the system) = -W_system_done_on_surroundings.

So, in this case, the system is doing 250 J of work. So W on the system is -250 J.

So, back to the equation: ΔU = Q + W.

ΔU is zero because it's isothermal. So 0 = Q + (-250) → Q=250 J.

Wait, but that would mean Q is positive 250 J. Which would imply that heat is being added to the system.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me try a different approach.

The system is the ideal gas. It's undergoing an isothermal expansion. So, for the system, the internal energy change is zero. So, the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system.

Wait, no, perhaps the equation is written as ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. So, if the system does work, W is negative. So for expansion, W would be negative.

Wait, but let's think about the sign conventions. The first law is often written as:

ΔU = Q - W,

where W is the work done by the system.

But I'm getting myself confused. Let me read a reliable source in my mind—oh wait, no, I can't. Let me think of this in terms of energy. When the system does work, it's losing internal energy. So, the system's internal energy decreases, so Q must be negative in this case because the system is losing heat.

But wait, let's get back. Let me think of this in terms of the first law.

In this scenario:

- W is the work done on the system. For expansion, this is positive.

- The system does work on the surroundings, so W (on system) is negative.

- The first law: ΔU = Q + W.

At constant temperature for an ideal gas, ΔU is zero.

So, 0 = Q + W → Q = -W.

But what is W? Since the system does work (expansion), W is negative. So, W = -250 J. So, Q is positive 250 J.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the system does work, it's losing energy. So, it should be releasing heat. So Q is negative.

Wait, wait, this is getting me stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, the system is the gas, and it's expanding. So, the gas does work on the surroundings, right? So, the work done by the system is positive. So, the work done on the system is negative.

In the equation, ΔU = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system.

So, when the system does work (expands), W is negative. So, W = -250 J.

So, 0 = Q + (-250) → Q = 250 J.

So, positive 250 J of heat is added to the system.

But wait, that would mean that the system is absorbing 250 J of heat. But why? Because the system is doing work, so energy is leaving the system. So, if the system is losing energy (doing work), it must be losing heat as well.

Wait, this is the crux. Because ΔU is zero. So, the system's internal energy doesn't change. So, any heat transfer must be accompanied by an equal and opposite change in internal energy.

If the system does work, it's losing internal energy. So, the heat leaving the system (negative Q) must be balanced by the work done (positive W).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the system's perspective.

The system is the gas. It's expanding, which means it does work. So, the system is losing energy. For the internal energy to remain the same, the system must lose heat as well.

But wait, how does that play into the equation? Let's write the equation again.

ΔU = Q + W,

where W is work done on the system.

But since the system is expanding, W is negative (because the system is doing work, so W is negative). So W = -250 J.

So, 0 = Q + (-250) → Q = 250 J.

So, the system absorbs 250 J of heat. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the system is doing work. Wait, no, because the system is losing internal energy. So, the heat leaving the system (negative Q) must be balanced by the system doing work (positive W).

Wait, but according to the equation, the system's Q is positive 250 J, meaning it is absorbing 250 J of heat. But if that's the case, then the system's internal energy would increase, which is opposite of what's happening (since it's doing work).

Wait, I'm getting tangled. Let me try an example.

Suppose the system (gas) does work on the surroundings. The work done by the system is positive. So, W = +250 J. But according to the equation, W is the work on the system. So, in this case, the system is not doing work on the surroundings, so W is negative. So W = -250 J.

So, the equation: 0 = Q + (-250) → Q = 250 J.

So, the system absorbs 250 J of heat. But that's impossible because the system is doing work and losing internal energy.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the system's perspective. The system's internal energy is zero, so any heat transfer must be accompanied by an equal and opposite change in internal energy.

Wait, if the system is doing work, then it must be losing heat. Because heat is energy leaving the system.

So, the system's internal energy decreases, so Q must be negative. So, if the system does work, it's losing energy, so Q is negative.

Wait, but according to the equation, ΔU = Q + W (with W being work on the system). So, if the system is doing work (W negative), and ΔU is zero, then Q must be +250 J.

But that would imply that the system is gaining heat, which would be opposite to what's happening because it's losing internal energy.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the system's internal energy. Since the internal energy is zero, the heat and work must balance each other out.

If the system is doing work (expansion), it's losing internal energy. So, the heat transfer must be negative, meaning that the system is losing heat.

But according to the equation, the system's Q is +250 J, which would imply it's absorbing heat. But in reality, the system is losing internal energy, so it must be losing heat. Thus, Q would be negative.

Hmm, so perhaps I messed up the sign convention here. Let me try another approach.

The system is the gas, and it's expanding.

Work done by the gas: +250 J (since it's doing work on the surroundings).

But in the equation, work done on the system is positive. So, the work done by the system is negative, as it's done on the surroundings.

So the work (W) on the system is -250 J.

ΔU = Q + W. Since ΔU is 0, Q = -W → Q = 250 J.

But that would mean the system is absorbing 250 J of heat, but that's not possible because the system is doing work and losing internal energy. So, perhaps the system is losing heat.

Wait, but according to the equation, when the system does work, it's losing internal energy, so Q must be negative. So, in the equation, with W being the work done on the system, which is negative, the equation is:

0 = Q + (-250).

So, Q = 250 J. But that can't be, because the system is losing energy, so Q should be negative.

So, perhaps the correct approach is that the system's Q is negative, and the work is negative (since the system is doing work). So, 0 = (-250) + Q → Q = 250. But that's the same as before.

Wait, but that can't be. Because if the system is losing heat, Q is negative, so let me re-examine the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly. The first law is:

ΔU = Q + W,

where W is the work done on the system. So, when the system does work, W is negative.

If the system does work (expansion), then W is negative. So, equation is 0 = Q + (-250) → Q = 250 J.

But that leads to the system absorbing heat, which isn't possible because it's doing work. So, what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system.

In that case, for expansion, W is positive. So:

ΔU = Q - W → 0 = Q - 250 → Q = 250 J.

So, the system is giving off 250 J of heat. But that's conflicting with the earlier idea that the system is losing internal energy via work.

Wait, but in this case, the system does positive work (expansion), so W is positive. So according to this formula, 0 = Q - W → Q = W.

So, Q = 250 J. So, the system is losing heat. But then, if the system is losing 250 J, the internal energy would decrease, which matches the expansion.

But that would mean that the system is giving 250 J of heat, which makes sense because it's doing work. So, the system is losing heat, which makes sense.

So, the heat transferred is -250 J, because the system is losing it.

Wait, but in the equation, Q is the heat added to the system. So, if Q is positive, it's heat entering the system. If negative, it's heat leaving.

So, the system is losing 250 J of heat, so Q would be -250 J.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier equation.

Hmm, I'm getting really confused. Maybe I should think of it in terms of the first law again.

The system is expanding, so it's doing work on the surroundings. So, the work done by the system is positive. The work done on the system is negative.

The equation is ΔU = Q + W (with W as work done on the system).

ΔU is zero.

So, 0 = Q + (-250) → Q=250 J.

So, system absorbs 250 J of heat.

But that would mean the system is absorbing heat, which is then used to do work. But that seems wrong because the system would lose internal energy.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. For the system, if it's losing internal energy due to doing work, but the equation says Q is positive, that would mean it's absorbing heat, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the system's perspective. The system's internal energy decreases because it's doing work. So, the heat must be negative (leaving the system). So, Q is negative.

But according to the equation, 0 = Q + (-250) → Q = 250 J.

This is a contradiction, which suggests that I must have the sign wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation.

Another way: ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system.

So, for expansion, W is positive. So, 0 = Q - 250 → Q=250 J.

So, the system is giving off 250 J of heat. So, Q is negative 250 J.

Wait, but according to this, the system loses 250 J of heat, which is correct because it's doing work. So, then the heat transfer is -250 J.

So, the correct answer would be option C: -250 J.

But wait, that's confusing because the system's internal energy is zero. So, the heat leaving the system (Q) is -250 J.

But wait, the first law equation is written as ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system.

In this case, W is -250 J.

So, 0 = Q + (-250) → Q=250 J.

But that's conflicting with my previous conclusion.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the system's perspective again.

The system is the gas. It is expanding, which means it's doing work on the surroundings. So, in terms of the system, it's losing internal energy. So, the heat must be negative because it's leaving the system.

So, the heat transfer is -250 J. So, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but what's the initial setup?

The question says: 250 J of work is done on the system. So, W on the system is +250 J.

So, the equation is ΔU = Q + W.

ΔU is zero, so 0 = Q + 250 → Q = -250 J.

So, Q is negative, meaning heat is leaving the system.

So, the correct answer is option C: -250 J.

But wait, the system's internal energy is zero. So, if the system is losing 250 J, that's correct because it's doing work.

So, the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves a system (an ideal gas) undergoing an isothermal expansion. The key principles and calculations are as follows:

1. **First Law of Thermodynamics**:  
   The first law of thermodynamics is expressed as:  
   \[
   \Delta U = Q + W
   \]  
   Where:
   - \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy.
   - \( Q \) is the heat transferred to the system.
   - \( W \) is the work done on the system.

2. **Conditions for the System**:
   - The process is isothermal, meaning the temperature of the system is constant.  
   - For an ideal gas, the internal energy (\( \Delta U \)) depends only on the temperature.  
   - Since the temperature is constant (\( \Delta U = 0 \)), the equation simplifies to:  
     \[
     0 = Q + W
     \]

3. **Work Done on the System**:
   - The work done on the system is given as \( W = +250 \, \text{J} \).  
   - Substituting into the simplified equation:  
     \[
     0 = Q + 250
     \]  
     Solving for \( Q \):  
     \[
     Q = -250 \, \text{J}
     \]

4. **Interpretation of \( Q \)**:
   - The negative sign indicates that heat is leaving the system.  
   - The system is doing work (expansion), which causes its internal energy to decrease.  
   - The heat lost by the system is balanced by the work done by the system.

5. **Final Answer**:
   The heat transferred is \( -250 \, \text{J} \), meaning 250 joules of heat is lost by the system.
