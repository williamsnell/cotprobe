Okay, so I have this physics problem here. It's about finding the values of an inductor and a capacitor given their current and stored energy. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but let's try to recall what I know.

Part (a) is about the inductor. The problem says the inductor carries 2 A of current and stores 20 J of energy. Oh right, the formula for the energy stored in an inductor is (1/2) L I², right? So if I plug in the numbers, I can solve for L.

Wait, let me write that down. Energy U is (1/2) * L * I². So 20 J is equal to (1/2) * L * (2 A)². Let me compute that. 2 squared is 4. So 20 = (1/2) * L * 4. Simplifying the right side: 1/2 times 4 is 2, so 20 = 2 * L. Oh wait, that's 20 = 2L. So L would be 10 Henrys. Hmm, wait, I'm getting 10 H. Let me check the units to be sure. Oh, right, current is in Amperes, so the units work out as L is H, so that's correct.

So part (a) gives L = 10 H. Now part (b) is about the capacitor. The problem states 500 V across it and 20 J stored. The formula for energy in a capacitor is (1/2) C V². So I can plug in the numbers again.

So U is 20 J, V is 500 V. So 20 = (1/2) * C * (500)^2. Wait, let me compute that. 500 squared is 250,000. So 20 = (1/2) * C * 250,000. Simplify the right side: (1/2)*250,000 is 125,000. So 20 = 125,000 * C. So solving for C, I divide 20 by 125,000. Let me compute that. 20 divided by 125,000 is 0.00016. Oh wait, that's 1.6e-4 farads.

But wait, 1 farad is 1e6 microfarads. So 1.6e-4 F is 1.6e-4 * 1e6 μF. Let me compute: 1e-4 * 1e6 is 100. So 1.6 * 100 is 160 μF. So C is 160 μF.

Wait a minute, but wait—did I do that correctly? Let me recalculate. 500 squared is 250,000, right? So 1/2 * C * 250,000 = 20. So 250,000 * C = 40. Because 20 * 2 is 40. So C = 40 / 250,000. 40 divided by 250,000 is 0.00016, which is 1.6e-4 F. Yeah, same as before. Converting that to microfarads: 1.6e-4 F * 1e6 μF/F equals 160 μF. So the capacitor is 160 μF.

So now I need to find the options that have L=10 H and C=160 μF. Looking at the options:

Option G: 10 H, 160 μF. So that's the correct combination.

Wait, let me double-check the options. The options are labeled A to J, each with specific values.

Looking at the options:

A: 30 H, 75 μF — No.

B:12 H, 140 μF — No.

C:20 H, 100 μF — No.

D:7 H, 220 μF — No.

E:25 H, 80 μF — No.

F:6 H, 180 μF — No.

G:10 H, 160 μF — Correct.

H:5 H, 200 μF — No.

I:15 H, 120 μF — No.

J:8 H, 250 μF — No.

So the correct answer is option G.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the inductance \( L \) of the inductor using the formula for energy stored in an inductor:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} L I^2
\]

Given \( U = 20 \, \text{J} \) and \( I = 2 \, \text{A} \), we substitute these values:

\[
20 = \frac{1}{2} L (2)^2
\]

Simplifying:

\[
20 = \frac{1}{2} L \cdot 4 \implies 20 = 2L \implies L = 10 \, \text{H}
\]

Next, we calculate the capacitance \( C \) of the capacitor using the formula for energy stored in a capacitor:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\]

Given \( U = 20 \, \text{J} \) and \( V = 500 \, \text{V} \), we substitute these values:

\[
20 = \frac{1}{2} C (500)^2
\]

Simplifying:

\[
20 = \frac{1}{2} C \cdot 250,000 \implies 20 = 125,000 C \implies C = \frac{20}{125,000} = 0.00016 \, \text{F}
\]

Converting to microfarads (\( 1 \, \mu\text{F} = 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)):

\[
C = 0.00016 \times 10^6 = 160 \, \mu\text{F}
\]

Now, we identify the option that matches \( L = 10 \, \text{H} \) and \( C = 160 \, \mu\text{F} \). The correct option is **G: 10 H, 160 μF**.
