Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Durkheim's view on the function of punishment. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that Durkheim was a key figure in modern psychology, especially in the study of deviant behavior and social structures. His work revolves around concepts like moral decay, deviant behavior, and the structure of society. The question is about punishment's purpose.

The options are A through I, and I need to pick the best one. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Vengeance. Vengeance is more about revenge or the act of harming someone, not about punishment. I think Durkheim focused more on the consequences of deviant behavior, not the immediate reactions.

Option B: Deterrence. Deterrence is about preventing future crimes. That makes sense because punishment would deter others from repeating the same behavior. So this could be a possible answer.

Option C: Restoration. Restoration sounds like restoring something to its former state, maybe like fixing a broken machine. Not directly about punishment in the traditional sense.

Option D: Moral education. That's more about teaching people how to behave morally, which is a different concept. Durkheim's work was about deviant behavior, not about teaching people to act morally.

Option E: Indemnification. Indemnification is about forgiving someone in harm's way, like writing a letter of apology. Not related to punishment in the sense of punishment as a deterrent.

Option F: Rehabilitation. I'm not sure about this. Rehabilitation is similar to indemnification, but I think it's more about reintegrating someone into society, not as a form of punishment.

Option G: Social control. Social control is about ordering society, perhaps through laws and sanctions. Punishment can be a way to control behavior, but Durkheim's focus was more on deviant behavior than just social control.

Option H: Incapacitation. That's about turning someone into a mentally disabled person, which is a different concept. Punishment doesn't exactly fit here.

Option I: Desert. Desert is a term from religious contexts, referring to a state of extreme poverty. Not related to punishment in this context.

Option J: Absence of punishment. Not one of the options, so probably not relevant.

Wait, another thought: Durkheim's original theories, like the "Law of Deceivers," talked about deviant behavior as a natural part of life, and punishment as a way to deter others from repeating it. So the main function might be deterrence, which is option B.

But I'm a bit confused because I've also heard that Durkheim's work focused more on the consequences of deviance, which aligns with deterrence. So, the best statement would be about deterrence, which is option B.

Alternatively, some sources say that Durkheim's work on punishment includes deterrence, restorative justice, and social control. But the question is about the function of punishment, so the primary function Durkheim associated with punishment was deterrence, preventing future crimes.

So I think the correct answer is B: Deterrence.

Durkheim's concept of punishment's function centers on deterrence, which is the prevention of future deviant behavior. This is best captured by option B: Deterrence. 

Answer: B
