Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem states that we have 2.0 moles of CO₂ gas. It's initially at 25°C and 10 atm, confined in a cylinder with a cross-section of 10.0 cm². The gas expands adiabatically against an external pressure of 1.0 atm, moving the piston outwards 20 cm. I need to calculate the heat (q) for this process. The options are given, so I have to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, so q equals zero. Wait, no wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in an adiabatic process, q is zero because there's no heat transfer. But wait, hold on. Because sometimes in real processes, there might be work done and heat exchange. But in an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged. However, in an expansion against a constant external pressure, the work done is considered. Oh wait, but the question says it's adiabatic. So in that case, q should be zero, right? Because adiabatic means no heat transfer. But wait, wait, wait—I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Adiabatic means that no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. So q=0. But in this case, the system is expanding against an external pressure. That process is irreversible, and the work is done against the external pressure. But since the process is adiabatic, the heat transfer q is zero. So the answer should be zero. But wait, looking back, the problem says it's adiabatic. So q is zero, which would make the correct answer either 0 or perhaps another option if I'm mistaken.

Wait no, wait. Wait, wait—another angle. Let me think about the process. The system is an ideal gas, right? So for an ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic process, q is zero. But wait, wait, but wait, is this a reversible or irreversible process? Because sometimes, the adiabatic condition can be tricky. Adiabatic usually refers to a reversible process, but when the process is irreversible, like expansion against a constant external pressure, the heat exchange can be different.

Wait, but the question says it's an adiabatic expansion. So regardless of whether it's reversible or not, if it's adiabatic, q is zero. But wait, wait, wait. No, wait. No, wait, wait—no, wait, no. Because in an adiabatic process, regardless of the path, q is zero. So in this case, whether the expansion is reversible or not, the heat exchange is zero. So the correct answer would be zero.

But wait, the options don't have zero. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: 100 J
B: -150 J
C: -100 J
D: 0
E: -250 J
F: 50 J
G: -200 J
H: 200 J
I: -50 J
J: 150 J

Ah, D is 0. So according to this, the correct answer should be D: 0 J. But wait, wait a minute. No, wait—because CO₂ is a solid? Wait, no, the question says it's a gas. Wait, no, wait—wait, wait, the problem says that all gases are perfect, but it's CO₂ gas, which is a gas. So the gas is expanding.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. CO₂ is a gas at 25°C and 10 atm. So that's correct. The process is expansion against an external pressure. The process is adiabatic, so it's an irreversible expansion. But in such cases, the first law applies as ΔU = q + w. But since q is zero in an adiabatic process, ΔU equals w.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no, because in an adiabatic process, q is zero, so ΔU is equal to the work done on the system. Wait, but wait, the work done by the system is negative when the system expands.

Wait, the work done is P_ext * ΔV.

So let me compute the work done. The system is expanding, so the work is done by the system. So the work is positive? Or negative? Hmm, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think: in the first law, ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So if the system does work (expands), then w is negative.

Wait, okay, so the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV. So the work done on the system is negative, so w is negative.

Wait, but in the case of expansion, the system does work on the surroundings, so w is negative (as per the formula ΔU = q + w). So in this case, since q is zero, ΔU is equal to the work done on the system, which is negative.

So in this case, the system's internal energy decreases because it's expanding. But wait, the problem is asking for the heat q that is transferred. Since the process is adiabatic, q is zero. So the answer is D: 0.

But wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. I'm getting confused because the process is adiabatic, which implies q=0. So regardless of the expansion, the heat exchange is zero. So the correct answer should be D.

But wait, let me think again. Is there any scenario where q isn't zero? No, because in an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged. So the heat q is zero. So the correct answer is D.

But wait, looking back at the problem, the system is expanding. But the question is about calculating q, which is zero. So the answer should be D: 0.

But wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait a moment. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me check if I've made a mistake. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm getting the sign wrong. Because, in the first law, the work done by the system is considered positive when the system is expanding. Wait, but according to the formula, w is work done on the system. So when the system does work (expands), w is negative.

So for example, in expansion against external pressure, the work done by the system is positive (in terms of the system's perspective), but in the formula, it's considered as negative because w is work on the system.

So, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV. Since the system is expanding, ΔV is positive. So work done by system is positive. But in the formula, it's negative because that's the work done on the system.

So, for the expansion, the work done on the system is negative. So w = -P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, but since the process is adiabatic, q is zero, so ΔU = w. So ΔU is negative. But wait, the problem isn't asking about the change in internal energy or anything like that—it's asking for the heat transferred, q.

So since q is zero, the correct answer is D: 0.

But wait, wait, wait. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Let's calculate the work done and see if it's related to q.

Wait, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV. The pressure is 1.0 atm. The volume change is from V_initial to V_final.

Wait, the initial volume and final volume? The initial volume is the volume of the cylinder at 10 atm. The cylinder has a cross-section of 10.0 cm², and the piston moved 20 cm. So the initial volume depends on how much the gas is compressed.

Wait, wait. The problem says the cylinder is initially at 25°C and 10 atm. But when the piston moves, the volume changes.

Wait, for volume change ΔV, it's the change in volume. So the initial volume is V_initial, and the final volume is V_final. The piston has moved 20 cm, so the change in volume is the area times the movement.

Wait, wait. The cross-sectional area is 10.0 cm². So 1 cm² is 1e-4 m², but wait, let me think in cm units.

Wait, 10 cm² is the area. So if the piston moves 20 cm, the volume change is ΔV = area × distance moved. So area is 10 cm², distance is 20 cm.

So ΔV = 10 cm² * 20 cm = 200 cm³. Wait, but wait, that's in cm³. We need to convert this to m³ or something else for units.

Since the pressure is given in atm, and the ideal gas law uses pressure in Pascals (1 atm = 101325 Pa), we can proceed in terms of cm³ or liters.

Wait, but let's think in terms of m³. 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³. So 200 cm³ is 200e-6 m³.

The pressure is 1.0 atm, which is 101325 Pa.

So work done by the system is P_ext × ΔV = 101325 Pa × 200e-6 m³.

Wait, but 1 Pa is N/m², and 1 m³ is 1e3 liters. Wait, let me compute this:

101325 Pa × 200e-6 m³ = 101325 * 2e-4 = 101325 * 0.0002 = 20.265 J.

Wait, so work done by the system is 20.265 J. But in the formula, w is the work done on the system, so since the system is expanding, work done by system is positive, so work done on system is negative. So w = -20.265 J.

But in an adiabatic process, q = 0, so ΔU = w = -20.265 J.

But the problem isn't asking about ΔU, it's asking for q. So q is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. Since the process is adiabatic, q must be zero. So the correct answer is zero.

But wait, the options have D as 0. So the answer is D. So why is there any other options? Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, wait, another thought. The question states that the gas is expanding against an external pressure. So the work done by the gas is P_ext × ΔV. But in this case, since it's expansion, the system is doing work on the surroundings, so the work is positive for the system, but in the formula, work is considered on the system (negative).

So the work done on the system is -20.265 J. Therefore, the internal energy change ΔU is equal to q plus w, but since q=0, ΔU = w. So ΔU is negative, meaning the internal energy decreases.

But the problem doesn't ask for that; it's only asking for q, which is zero.

So the correct answer is D: 0 J.

To solve the problem, we analyze the process and apply the first law of thermodynamics. The system consists of 2.0 moles of CO₂ gas initially at 25°C and 10 atm, confined in a cylinder with a cross-sectional area of 10.0 cm². The gas expands adiabatically against an external pressure of 1.0 atm, causing the piston to move 20 cm. Since the process is adiabatic, there is no heat exchange with the surroundings, meaning \( q = 0 \).

### Key Points:
1. **Adiabatic Process**: By definition, in an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings (\( q = 0 \)).
2. **Work Done**: The work done by the system is calculated as \( w = P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V \). The change in volume (\( \Delta V \)) is determined by the movement of the piston: \( \Delta V = \text{area} \cdot \text{distance} = 10.0 \, \text{cm}^2 \cdot 20 \, \text{cm} = 200 \, \text{cm}^3 \). Converting to meters cubed: \( 200 \, \text{cm}^3 = 200 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3 = 2 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3 \). The external pressure is \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1.0 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \). Thus, \( w = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \cdot 2 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3 = 20.265 \, \text{J} \).
3. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: For an adiabatic process, \( \Delta U = q + w \). Since \( q = 0 \), it follows that \( \Delta U = w \). However, the problem does not ask for \( \Delta U \), so the key result is \( q = 0 \).

### Conclusion:
The heat transferred during this adiabatic process is \( q = 0 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
