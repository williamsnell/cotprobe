Okay, so I have this problem where I need to estimate the quotient of 117.83 divided by 5.67 using compatible numbers. Hmm, let's see. I remember that compatible numbers are numbers that are close to the actual numbers but are easier to work with, usually round to whole numbers or numbers ending with one or two zeros.

Alright, so the original problem is 117.83 ÷ 5.67. Let me think about how to approximate these numbers. Maybe I can round 117.83 to 120 because 120 is pretty close and it's easier to divide. Similarly, 5.67 is a bit over 5.6. But 5.6 is close to 5.7, which is a nice number. Wait, but maybe I can approximate it a bit more. Let me think—5.67 is approximately 6 because 5.67 is just a bit under 6. So, around 6.

Wait, but 120 ÷ 6 is 20. That seems straightforward, but I should check if that's a good estimate. Alternatively, I could think of 5.67 as about 5.5 or 6. Maybe I can make both numbers compatible in other ways. Like, what if I round 117.83 to 100 and 5.67 to 5? Then 100 ÷ 5 is 20, which is the same as before. Alternatively, if I round 117.83 to 120 and 5.67 to 6, I get the same 20.

Wait, but the options don't have 20 as an option. Let me check the options again. The options are A: about 20, B:80, etc. Oh, so option A is about 20. So that matches my calculation.

But wait, I should make sure that the estimation is accurate. Let me think again. 117.83 ÷ 5.67. If I round 117.83 up to 120, and 5.67 up to 6, then 120 ÷ 6 is 20. Alternatively, if I round 117.83 down to 110 and 5.67 up to 6, then 110 ÷ 6 is about 18.33, which is around 18. But that's more than 18. But since the options don't have 18, the closest is 20. So the correct answer would be about 20, which is option A.

Wait, but what if I use another approach. Let's think about the original numbers more precisely. 5.67 is just a bit more than 5. Let me think about how much more. 5.67 is approximately 5.67, which is about 5.67. So 117.83 ÷ 5.67. Let's try to compute it more accurately without approximation.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of fractions. Let me approximate 117.83 as 120 and 5.67 as 6. So 120 ÷ 6 is 20. So that would make option A the right choice.

Wait, but sometimes when I do quick estimates, I might have to consider the exactness. Let me think, 5.67 times 20 is 113.4, because 5.67 * 20 = 113.4. The original numerator is 117.83, which is 117.83 - 113.4 = 4.43 more. So 5.67 * 20 = 113.4, and 5.67 * 20.785 is 117.83. Wait, that's a bit too precise. But in any case, 5.67 times 20 is 113.4, and 117.83 is 4.43 more. So 5.67 * 20 = 113.4, which is 117.83 - 4.43. So 5.67 * 20 = 113.4. 117.83 is 113.4 +4.43. So 4.43 is 5.67 * (4.43/5.67) ≈ 5.67 * 0.784 ≈ 0.784 * 5.67. So 5.67 * 20.784 ≈ 117.83. So 5.67 * 20.784 ≈ 117.83. So 20.784 is the exact value. But since we're estimating, 20.78 is about 21, but 20.78 is approximately 21, but the options don't have 21.

Wait, but the question is about estimating using compatible numbers. So perhaps the original approach was better. Either way, 20 is an option.

Wait, but another way to approach it is to consider that 5.67 is about 5.7, and 117.83 is about 118. So 118 ÷ 5.7. Let me compute that. Let's see, 5.7 times 20 is 114, because 5.7 * 20 = 114. So 118 is 118 - 114 = 4 more. So 5.7 * 20 = 114, and 5.7 * 20.7 ≈ 118. So 20.7 is about 118 /5.7, which is approximately 20.7. So that's about 21. But again, the options don't have 21, so the closest is 20.

So the correct answer is about 20, which is option A.

The correct answer is A: about 20.

The estimation process involves rounding the numbers to compatible figures. Rounding 117.83 to 120 and 5.67 to 6, we find 120 ÷ 6 = 20. This aligns with option A.
