Okay, so I have this question about decreasing hostility between junior high school students. Hmm, I'm a bit new to these types of questions, but I'll try to think through it. Let's see... The question is asking what's the best advice to decrease hostility. There are 10 options from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should probably understand what each option is suggesting. The question is about strategies to reduce tension and improve group dynamics. So I'm thinking about ways to make students feel better about their interactions and work together more effectively.

Option A suggests having a counselor for individual sessions. That makes sense because a counselor can provide individualized support, maybe addressing specific issues the student is having. It's a good idea because individual help can address the root causes of hostility.

Option B says assign goals only achievable through intergroup cooperation. Wait, that seems a bit tricky. If the goals can only be achieved by working together, that might actually encourage cooperation. But I'm not sure. Maybe if students are given tasks that require others to help, it could lead to better collaboration. Alternatively, if the goals themselves require intergroup cooperation, that could foster mutual effort.

Option C suggests a community member talks about the benefits of cooperation. That's a positive approach because it brings in external support. Sometimes, hearing from others who see the positive side can boost feelings of belonging and mutual respect.

Option D is about using educational videos to teach negative impacts through presentations. That could be effective in showing why hostility might occur, which might reduce feelings of self-hate. But would that really decrease hostility? Maybe it would help students understand their own feelings, but I'm not sure it directly decreases hostility.

Option E is implementing a reward system for least hostile groups. Rewarding might make students feel better about their behavior, but it could also make them more motivated to avoid hostile actions. I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Option F suggests a reward for the group with the least hostility. That sounds similar to E but focuses on the group that's least hostile. It might also encourage cooperation by rewarding when others are doing well. But I'm not sure if it's the best method.

Option G is having competitive games. Competitive games can be fun but might actually lead to more conflict. Students might feel threatened by competition, which could increase hostility. So maybe this isn't the best approach.

Option H suggests increasing contact under pleasant conditions. Maybe organizing group activities or social events outside of school could reduce the pressure and help students get used to working together in real settings.

Option I is encouraging each group to develop their own rules. That sounds like it could empower students, allowing them to take charge of their own behavior. It might decrease hostility because students feel more in control and are less likely to be scared of making mistakes.

Option J is establishing strict rules and penalties. If the rules are enforced, students might feel more regulated and less likely to engage in bad behavior. But it's a more structured approach and could lead to accountability, which might reduce hostility. However, enforcing strict rules can also make things more siloed, which might not be ideal if groups want to work together.

Now, thinking about effective strategies for reducing hostility. One of the key things is fostering mutual respect and understanding. Encouraging individual help can address specific issues. Assigning goals that require cooperation can create a sense of necessity for working together. Having a community member's perspective can build a sense of belonging. Encouraging each group to set their own rules might empower them, making them more open to collaboration. 

Looking at the options again, option A is about counselor sessions. That's a proactive approach, addressing the root causes. Option I is about each group creating their own rules. That could empower students, but it's more individualistic. Option H is about increased contact, which might be more about socializing than actually fostering cooperation.

Option J, establishing strict rules, might be effective in getting students to behave in a certain way, but it could also create more tension if the rules are too rigid. On the other hand, option G's competitive games might create more conflict, so that's probably not good.

Option E and F are reward-based, which might make students feel good about their behavior but could also make them avoid bad behavior. So I'm not sure about that.

Option C is about a community member. That's a good idea because it can provide external support and make students feel they have a voice.

So, the best options seem to be either A, C, or I. Let's think about which of these is the best strategy.

Option A: Individual counseling. This can help students address their own issues. It's a direct approach and can be personalized.

Option C: Community member's speech. This could be a powerful way to influence feelings. Maybe the member's perspective can change students' perceptions.

Option I: Each group developing rules. This seems like it could lead to cooperation because each group has control. But is that better than just having a counselor?

Alternatively, option C might be a more immediate and effective way to change feelings. It's a more straightforward approach and can be done in a short time, which is good for reducing hostility.

Wait, but the question is about the best way to decrease hostility. So perhaps the most effective is having a respected member speak up. That way, the school community can provide a voice for students, which might help them feel better.

So, option C seems like it's a good answer because it involves a respected member who can talk about the benefits of cooperation. This would create a positive environment where students feel heard and valued.

Another angle: Option I, where each group creates their own rules, could also help. But I'm not sure if that's as direct as getting the students to work within the rules without external intervention. It might take more time and might not address all issues.

Alternatively, option A is about individual sessions, which can provide personalized help. That might be better for addressing specific issues than a group discussion.

Wait, but the question says "decrease hostility between groups". So perhaps it's about fostering working together rather than individual issues.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between options C and I. Let me reconsider.

When I think about strategies to reduce hostility, a common approach is to create a safe and positive environment where students feel respected and valued. Providing external support (like a community member) can be a powerful tool because it can provide a sense of belonging and encourage students to participate more actively.

So, option C: having a respected member of the community speak about the benefits of cooperation. That sounds like it would be a good way to help students feel that their actions can positively impact the group and the school. This can alleviate some of the fears or resentment that hostility might bring.

On the other hand, if each group is allowed to develop their own rules (option I), that could empower students to take ownership of their behavior, which might reduce the need for external support.

Alternatively, option A is about having a counselor. That's a proactive step, but it's more about the individual than the group as a whole.

So, between C and I, the best choice might be C. Because it involves a respected member, which can provide a strong voice for the group, making students feel they have an impact. That could make them more willing to work together.

Wait, but I'm also considering option H, which is about increasing contact under pleasant conditions. That might help students get used to working together in a less stressful environment, but it's more about social interaction than fostering cooperation.

Option G, competitive games, might not be the best approach as they can create more conflict and make students feel threatened.

So, putting it all together, the best answer seems to be option C because it involves a respected community member speaking up, which can provide a positive influence and help reduce hostility by creating a sense of mutual respect and support.

To decrease hostility between junior high school groups, the best strategy involves fostering a positive and respected environment where students feel valued and respected. Option C, which involves a respected community member speaking about the benefits of cooperation, is the most effective approach. This external support provides a sense of belonging and encouragement, helping students feel that their actions can positively impact the group and the school. It addresses the root causes of hostility by creating a safe and supportive environment, which is crucial for reducing tension and promoting collaboration.
