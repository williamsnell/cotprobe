Okay, so I've got this problem about an astronomical telescope involving a double slit and a double star. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The setup is a large telescope focused on a double star. An adjustable double slit is placed in front of the objective. As the slit distance increases, the interference pattern shows fringes. When the distance reaches 57.5 cm, the fringes disappear. I need to find the angular separation of the two components of the double star, given the mean wavelength is 5550 Å (Angstroms). The options are given in seconds of arc.

Hmm. I remember that when an interference pattern is observed, like in a double-slit experiment, the fringes disappear when the slit separation is such that the path difference equals an integer multiple of the wavelength. Oh wait, but this is about a double star and a double slit setup. So the double slit is acting as a source of two slits, and the interference is due to light passing through them and interfering with itself.

Wait, the formula for the angular separation (θ) in a double-slit experiment is given by θ = λ / d, where λ is the wavelength and d is the separation between the two slits. Oh, right! So θ is the angle between the two maxima, which is the angular separation we're looking for.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula I'm thinking of is when the slits are separated by distance d, and the wavelength is λ. The angular separation θ is λ/(d). But wait, maybe I got the formula a bit wrong. Let me think again. Oh, no wait. The formula is θ (in radians) = λ / (d). So θ in radians is wavelength divided by slit separation.

But wait, the problem states that the slit distance is increased until the fringes disappear. So when the fringes disappear, that's when the path difference equals nλ, which is the condition for constructive interference. But wait, I think in the case of fringes disappearing, it's when the path difference for the two slits equals the wavelength, because that's when constructive interference happens. Or wait, no, when the path difference is an integer multiple, like mλ, you get constructive interference. But when the path difference is such that the two slits produce a maximum, which occurs when the two paths are the same, but the path difference is zero, which is when there's constructive interference. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe I should start with the basics. The condition for constructive interference in a double-slit experiment is when the path difference equals an integer multiple of λ. So the formula is d sinθ ≈ mλ, where m is an integer (m=0,1,2,...). When θ is small (since we're probably dealing with small angles), sinθ ≈ θ in radians. So that gives θ ≈ mλ/d.

But when the fringes disappear, that's when the path difference is an exact multiple of the wavelength, so the maximum occurs at m=1 (the first bright fringe), which is when the path difference is λ. Wait, but wait, the first maximum is when m=1, so d sinθ = λ. But wait, for small θ, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ λ/d. But the actual formula for the angular separation (the position of the maxima) is θ = λ/(d) when d is small compared to the distance to the screen.

So in this problem, the slit separation (d) is increased until the fringes disappear. At that point, the path difference is equal to the wavelength λ. So the condition is d sinθ = λ. But since θ is small, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ λ/(d). So the angular separation is λ/(d). But wait, wait, the problem is giving d as 57.5 cm. But wait, let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem says that the distance between the centers of the components of the double slit is increased until the fringes disappear. So the slit separation (d) is the distance between the two slits. So when they're 57.5 cm apart, the fringes disappear. So the maximum occurs when the path difference is λ, which is what determines the angular separation.

So θ = λ/(d) in radians. But wait, the question is asking for the angular separation in seconds of arc. So I need to convert θ from radians to arcseconds.

Wait, but wait, the formula I used is θ = λ/(d), but I need to be careful about the units. The wavelength is given in Angstroms: 5550 A°. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 5550 A is 5550e-10 meters.

So let's plug in the numbers. First, convert the slit separation d from cm to meters. 57.5 cm is 0.575 meters. Then, λ is 5550e-10 meters.

So θ = (5550e-10 m) / (0.575 m) = ?

Wait, but let me compute that. Let's compute 5550e-10 divided by 0.575.

Wait, 5550e-10 is 5.55e-7 meters. Divided by 0.575 (which is 5.75e-1), so 5.55e-7 / 5.75e-1 = (5.55 / 5.75) * 1e-6. Let me compute 5.55/5.75.

5.55 /5.75 is approximately 0.965. So 0.965e-6 radians. Oh wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1 rad is about 57.3 degrees, so 0.965e-6 radians is about 0.965e-6 * 57.3 degrees ≈ 5.52e-5 degrees. Then, converting to arcseconds: 1 degree is 3600 arcseconds, so 0.965e-6 * 57.3 * 3600.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me compute it step by step.

First, let's calculate λ in meters: 5550 A = 5550e-10 m = 5.55e-7 m.

d = 57.5 cm = 0.575 m.

θ = λ/(d) = (5.55e-7) / 0.575 ≈ 9.66e-7 radians.

Wait, 5.55e-7 divided by 0.575: 0.575 is 5.75e-1. So 5.55e-7 / 5.75e-1 = (5.55 /5.75) * 1e-6.

5.55/5.75 is approximately 0.965.

So θ ≈ 0.965e-6 radians.

Now, converting radians to arcseconds.

We know that 1 radian = (180/pi) degrees ≈ 57.2958 degrees.

Then, 1 degree = 3600 arcseconds.

So 0.965e-6 radians * (180/pi) degrees/rad) * 3600 arcseconds/degree.

Let me compute that.

Let me compute the first conversion: 0.965e-6 * (180/pi) ≈ 0.965e-6 * 57.2958 ≈ 5.52e-5 degrees.

Multiply by 3600: 5.52e-5 * 3600 = 0.19872 arcseconds.

Approximately 0.199 arcseconds.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.2 second of arc. So that's close. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me go through the calculation again because earlier I thought the slit separation was 57.5 cm, which I converted to 0.575 m. Then λ is 5550 A, which is 5550e-10 m = 5.55e-7 m.

So λ/d = 5.55e-7 / 0.575 = 0.965e-6 radians.

Now, 0.965e-6 radians * (180/pi) degrees/rad) = 0.965e-6 * 57.2958 ≈ 5.52e-5 degrees.

Then, 5.52e-5 degrees * 3600 arcsec/degree = 0.1987 arcsec, approximately 0.199, which is about 0.2 second of arc.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.2, option B is 0.25, etc. So the closest is option E: 0.2.

Wait, but wait. Let me look back at the problem statement. Oh, wait, the option choices are:

A: 0.35
B: 0.25
C: 0.05
D: 0.5
E: 0.1
F: 0.4
G: 0.01
H: 0.15
I: 0.3
J: 0.2

So the options are E (0.1) and J (0.2). So according to my calculation, the answer is approximately 0.199, which is about 0.2, so option J.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Because the angular separation is given by θ = λ/(d) when the slit separation is d and the path difference is λ. But wait, in the double slit experiment, θ is the angle where the maxima occur, which is when the path difference is mλ. So the first maximum after the center is at m=1, θ = λ/(d) radians. So yes, the calculation is correct.

But wait, wait a second; the slit separation d is 57.5 cm, which is 0.575 m. So the calculation is correct.

So the answer should be approximately 0.2 seconds of arc. So the correct option is J.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the angular separation in a double-slit experiment:

\[
\theta = \frac{\lambda}{d}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light,
- \( d \) is the slit separation,
- \( \theta \) is the angular separation in radians.

### Step 1: Convert units
- The wavelength is given as \( \lambda = 5550 \, \text{Å} = 5550 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 5.55 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).
- The slit separation is \( d = 57.5 \, \text{cm} = 0.575 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( \theta \) in radians
\[
\theta = \frac{\lambda}{d} = \frac{5.55 \times 10^{-7}}{0.575} \approx 9.66 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{radians}
\]

### Step 3: Convert radians to arcseconds
To convert radians to arcseconds, use the conversion factor:
\[
1 \, \text{radian} = \frac{180}{\pi} \, \text{degrees} \approx 57.2958 \, \text{degrees}.
\]
\[
1 \, \text{degree} = 3600 \, \text{arcseconds}.
\]

First, convert radians to degrees:
\[
\theta = 9.66 \times 10^{-7} \times 57.2958 \approx 5.52 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{degrees}.
\]

Then, convert degrees to arcseconds:
\[
\theta = 5.52 \times 10^{-5} \times 3600 \approx 0.199 \, \text{arcseconds}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The calculated angular separation is approximately \( 0.199 \, \text{arcseconds} \), which is closest to option **J: 0.2 second of arc**.
