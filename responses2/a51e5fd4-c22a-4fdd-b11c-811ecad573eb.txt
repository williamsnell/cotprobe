Okay, so I have this bacteria growth problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that bacteria in a culture increase at a rate proportional to the number present. Hmm, that sounds like a classic exponential growth scenario. I remember from my biology class that when a population grows proportionally to its current size, it follows an exponential model.

The initial population is 200, and it triples in 10 hours. I need to find out how many bacteria there will be after a full day, which is 24 hours. The options are given, so I can check my answer against them once I calculate.

First, I should set up the differential equation. The rate of change of the population (dP/dt) is proportional to P. So, mathematically, that's dP/dt = kP, where k is the proportionality constant. The solution to this differential equation is an exponential function: P(t) = P0 * e^(kt), where P0 is the initial population.

Wait, alternatively, another way to write this is using the natural logarithm. Since P(t) = P0 * e^(kt), I can also express it as P(t) = P0 * e^(kt). But sometimes people use the base e, so that's the same thing.

Alternatively, another approach is to model it using the exponential growth formula: P(t) = P0 * e^(kt), or sometimes written as P(t) = P0 * (1 + r*t), but wait, no, that's for simple interest or something, not exponential. Oh wait, right, I think I confused with simple growth. The correct model is the exponential one, where the growth rate is proportional to the current population.

So, given that, I can use the information provided to find k. The initial population is 200, and after 10 hours, it triples to 600. So, at t=10 hours, P(10) = 600.

Let me plug that into the equation. So:

600 = 200 * e^(k * 10)

I can simplify this. Dividing both sides by 200, we get:

3 = e^(10k)

To solve for k, take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(3) = 10k

So, k = ln(3)/10.

I can calculate ln(3) which is approximately 1.0986. So, k ≈ 1.0986 / 10 ≈ 0.10986 per hour.

Now, I need to find the population after 24 hours. So, t=24. Using the same formula:

P(24) = 200 * e^(k*24)

Plugging in k:

P(24) = 200 * e^(0.10986 * 24)

Let me compute 0.10986 * 24. 0.1 *24 is 2.4, 0.00986 *24 is about 0.23664. So total is about 2.4 + 0.23664 ≈ 2.63664.

So, e^2.63664. What's e squared? e^2 is around 7.389, e^2.63664 is a bit higher. Let me think, 2.63664 is about 2.64. Let me compute e^2.64.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: e^2.64 ≈ 13.87. Hmm, but wait, let me check more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it step by step. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that e^2.64 = e^(2 + 0.64) = e^2 * e^0.64.

e^2 is 7.389, e^0.64 is approximately... Let me think, e^0.6 is about 1.822, e^0.7 is about 2.0138, so e^0.64 is somewhere between. Let me make a linear approximation. Let's say between 0.64 and 0.65.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute using the Taylor series or another method, but maybe it's easier to realize that e^2.64 is approximately 13.87 because I remember that e^2.6 is around 13.46, and e^0.04 is about 1.0408, so e^2.64 is e^2.6 * e^0.04 ≈ 13.46 * 1.0408 ≈ 13.46 * 1.04 is 14. So approximately 13.46 * 1.0408 = let's compute 13.46 * 1.04 = 13.46 + (13.46 * 0.04) = 13.46 + 0.5384 = 13.9984, so about 14.

So, e^2.64 ≈14.

So, P(24) ≈ 200 *14 = 2800.

Wait, but wait, let me cross-check because other methods might give a more accurate number.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 0.10986 *24 = 2.63664, so e^2.63664.

Let me use a calculator approach. I know that e^2.63664 is e^(2.63664). Let me compute using a calculator step (if I had one, but I can think in terms of known values).

We know that e^2 is about 7.389, e^0.6 is about 1.822, e^0.03 is about 1.03045, e^0.00664 is about 1.00666.

So, e^2.63664 = e^2 * e^0.6 * e^0.03 * e^0.00664.

Compute each:

e^0.6 ≈1.822118800

e^0.03≈ 1.03045

e^0.00664≈ 1.00668 (approx)

Multiplying all together:

1.8221188 *1.03045 = let's compute that:

1.8221188 * 1.03 = approx 1.8221188 * 1 + 1.8221188 * 0.03 = 1.8221188 + 0.05466356 ≈1.87678.

Then multiply by 1.00668:

1.87678 * 1.00668 ≈ 1.87678 + (1.87678 * 0.00668) ≈ 1.87678 + 0.01258 ≈1.88936.

So, e^2.63664 ≈ e^2 * e^0.63664.

Wait wait, no, no, wait. Wait, I think I might have confused the steps. Let me correct.

No, wait. I think I went a bit wrong. Let me approach it differently. Let's compute e^2.63664 as follows:

Compute 2.63664 = 2 + 0.63664.

So, e^2.63664 = e^2 * e^0.63664.

We know e^2 ≈7.389056.

Now, compute e^0.63664.

Hmm, 0.63664 can be broken down into 0.6 + 0.03664.

So, e^0.63664 = e^0.6 * e^0.03664.

We know e^0.6 ≈1.8221188.

e^0.03664: let's compute that. Using the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=0: e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6.

x=0.03664.

Compute each term:

x =0.03664

x²= (0.03664)^2 = 0.0013425

x³= 0.03664^3 ≈ 0.00004908

So,

1 + 0.03664 + 0.0013425/2 + 0.00004908/6.

Compute each term:

1 =1

0.03664 =0.03664

0.0013425/2=0.00067125

0.00004908/6≈0.00000818.

Adding them up: 1 +0.03664=1.03664; 1.03664 +0.00067125=1.03731; +0.00000818≈1.03732.

So, e^0.03664≈1.03732.

So, e^0.63664 = 1.8221188 * 1.03732 ≈ let's compute that.

1.8221188 *1.03732.

Multiply step by step:

1.8221188 *1 =1.8221188

1.8221188 *0.03=0.054663564

1.8221188 *0.00732= approx 1.8221188 *0.007=0.0127548 and 1.8221188 *0.00032=approx 0.000583. So 0.0127548 +0.000583≈0.0133378.

Adding all together:

1.8221188 +0.054663564=1.876782364

+0.0133378≈1.89012.

So, e^0.63664≈1.89012.

Then, e^2.63664 = e^2 * e^0.63664 ≈7.389056 *1.89012.

Compute 7.389056 *1.89012.

Let me compute this:

7 *1.89012=13.23084

0.389056 *1.89012.

Compute 0.3 * 1.89012=0.567036

0.08 *1.89012=0.1512096

0.009056 *1.89012≈approx 0.0171 (since 0.009 *1.89≈0.01701)

So, 0.567036 +0.1512096=0.7182456; +0.0171=0.7353456.

So, 7.389056 *1.89012 ≈13.23084 +0.7353456≈13.9661856.

So, e^2.63664≈13.966.

So, P(24)=200 *13.966≈2793.2.

Looking at the options, option D is 2793. So that's the approximate number.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, I computed e^2.63664 as approximately 13.966. Then, 200 *13.966 = 2793.2, which is around 2793. So option D is 2793. So that would be the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me try another approach.

Another formula for exponential growth is P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^(t/k). Wait, no, that's also exponential but perhaps another way to express it. Alternatively, using the formula:

P(t) = P0 * e^(kt), which is the same as the first approach.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the rule of 72 to estimate the growth rate. The rule of 72 states that the doubling time is 72 divided by the growth rate percentage. But wait, in this case, the growth rate is 300% in 10 hours. So, the doubling time would be 72/300 = 0.24 hours per doubling. Wait, that can't be right because 3x growth in 10 hours, the doubling time (approx) is 72/300 =0.24 hours.

Wait, but 0.24 hours is 14.4 minutes. So, the bacteria double about every 14 minutes. So, in 24 hours, which is 24*60=1440 minutes. Divided by 14.4 gives 1440 /14.4 =100 doubling periods. So, 2^100 * initial population. Wait, that can't be right because 2^10 is 1024, so 2^100 would be a huge number. But according to my earlier calculation, the population was approximately 2793, which is way lower than 2^100. So, this suggests I must have made a mistake in using the rule of 72.

Ah, no, wait, perhaps I confused the rule of 72 for the growth rate. The rule of 72 is used for population doubling given a certain growth rate. So, if the growth rate is 300% (i.e., 300% per hour?), that doesn't make sense because exponential growth rates are usually small. Wait, perhaps the rule of 72 is for when the growth rate is expressed as a percentage per period, but in this case, the rate per hour is 300% per 10 hours. So, perhaps we should compute the per-hour rate correctly.

Wait, my initial approach is correct. So, the doubling time approach might not be applicable here because the growth is already given as tripling in 10 hours, not a 300% per hour. So, perhaps the rule of 72 isn't the right approach here. Let me stick with the initial calculation.

Another possible error point: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

k = ln(3)/10.

ln(3) is approximately 1.0986, so k = 0.10986 per hour. That's correct.

So, in 24 hours, t=24 hours.

So, e^(0.10986 *24) = e^(2.63664). Wait, earlier I computed that as approx 13.966, giving P(24)=200*13.966=2793, which is option D.

Looking back at the options, D is 2793, which matches.

Wait, but I should cross-verify using the exponential formula another way. Let me compute using the formula P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^(t/k). Wait, that's another way to express exponential growth when the growth rate is given per some period. In this case, the population triples in 10 hours. So, the growth rate as a fraction per hour is (P1/P0)^(1/t) -1. So, (3)^(1/10) -1.

Wait, 3^(1/10) is the growth rate per hour as a factor. Let me compute that:

3^(1/10) = e^(ln(3)/10) = e^(0.10986) ≈ 1.116123.

So, the growth rate per hour is approximately 0.116123, or 11.6123%.

Thus, the population after t hours is P(t) = 200 * (1.116123)^(t).

So, for t=24 hours,

P(24) = 200 * (1.116123)^24.

Hmm, let's compute this.

But this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can compute (1.116123)^24 as (1.116123)^10 * (1.116123)^14.

Wait, but I already know that (1.116123)^10 ≈3, because 1.116123 is (3)^(1/10). So, (1.116123)^10 = 3.

Thus, (1.116123)^24 = (1.116123)^10 * (1.116123)^14 ) =3 * (1.116123)^14.

Now, compute (1.116123)^14.

Hmm, let's compute it step by step.

(1.116123)^2 = 1.245675.

(1.116123)^4 = (1.245675)^2 ≈1.55150.

(1.116123)^8 = (1.55150)^2 ≈2.40814.

(1.116123)^14 = (1.116123)^8 * (1.116123)^4 * (1.116123)^2.

Which is 2.40814 *1.55150 *1.245675.

Compute 2.40814 * 1.55150 first.

2 *1.55150=3.103, 0.40814 *1.55150≈0.6348.

So, 3.103 +0.6348≈3.7378.

Now multiply by 1.245675:

3.7378 *1.245675.

Let me compute 3 *1.245675=3.737025.

0.7378 *1.245675≈0.7378 *1.245 ≈0.9130.

So, total is approximately 3.737025 +0.9130≈4.6500.

Thus, (1.116123)^14≈4.65.

So, (1.116123)^24 =3 *4.65=13.95.

So, P(24)=200 *13.95=2790. That's approximately 2790, which again rounds to 2793, option D.

So, both methods lead me to option D: 2793.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the exponential growth formula:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \cdot e^{k \cdot t} \]

where:
- \( P_0 = 200 \) (initial population),
- \( k \) is the growth rate constant,
- \( t \) is time in hours.

### Step 1: Find the growth rate constant \( k \)
The population triples in 10 hours. Using the exponential growth formula:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \cdot e^{k \cdot t} \]

At \( t = 10 \):

\[ 600 = 200 \cdot e^{10k} \]

Divide both sides by 200:

\[ 3 = e^{10k} \]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln(3) = 10k \]

Thus:

\[ k = \frac{\ln(3)}{10} \approx \frac{1.0986}{10} = 0.10986 \, \text{per hour} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the population after 24 hours
Using the exponential growth formula with \( t = 24 \):

\[ P(24) = 200 \cdot e^{0.10986 \cdot 24} \]

First, calculate the exponent:

\[ 0.10986 \cdot 24 \approx 2.63664 \]

Now, calculate \( e^{2.63664} \):

Using approximations and known values of \( e^x \), we find:

\[ e^{2.63664} \approx 13.966 \]

Thus:

\[ P(24) = 200 \cdot 13.966 \approx 2793.2 \]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The closest option to 2793.2 is:

**D) 2793**
