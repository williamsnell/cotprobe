Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find out how many ways there are to arrange 9 people in a line such that no one is in their correct position. Hmm, wait, that sounds familiar. I think this is related to permutations called derangements. Let me think about it.

A derangement is when none of the objects appear in their original position. Yeah, that's right. So for n objects, the number of derangements is denoted by !n or sometimes D(n). I remember there's a formula for derangements. Let me recall what it is.

I think the formula is something like n! multiplied by (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n / n!). So for each term, you're adding or subtracting the reciprocal of factorials. Or wait, another way to write it is the sum from k=0 to n of [(-1)^k / k!] multiplied by n!. So !n = n! * sum_{k=0 to n} (-1)^k /k!.

Alternatively, I remember it's approximately n! divided by e, but I think it's more precise to compute the sum as I mentioned. So for 9 people, I need to compute 9! multiplied by that series.

Let me compute 9! first. 9 factorial is 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Let me calculate that. 9×8 is 72, 72×7 is 504, ×6 is 3024, ×5 is 15120, ×4 is 60480, ×3 is 181440, ×2 is 362880, ×1 is 362880. So 9! is 362880.

Now I need to compute the sum S = 1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + 1/4! - 1/5! + 1/6! - 1/7! + 1/8! - 1/9!.

Let me calculate each term step by step.

1: 1

-1/1! = -1

So after first two terms: 1 -1 = 0.

Next term: +1/2! = 1/2 = 0.5 → 0 + 0.5 = 0.5.

Next term: -1/6 → 0.5 - 0.166666... = 0.333333...

+1/24 → 0.333333 + 0.041666... = 0.375.

-1/120 → 0.375 - 0.008333... = 0.366666...

+1/720 → 0.366666 + 0.001388... ≈ 0.368055...

-1/5040 → 0.368055 - 0.0001984 ≈ 0.367856...

+1/40320 → 0.367856 + 0.0000248 ≈ 0.3678808...

-1/362880 → 0.3678808 - 0.000002755 → ≈ 0.367878.

So the sum S is approximately 0.367879441... I think this is close to 1/e, which is about 0.367879441... So that makes sense. The exact value would be 1/e approximately.

So !9 = 9! * S ≈ 362880 * 0.367879441.

Let me compute that. 362880 × 0.367879441.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 362880 multiplied by 0.367879441.

Alternatively, since 9! is 362880, and 0.367879 is approximately 1/e, but I need the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute it step by step.

362880 × 0.367879441.

Let me compute 362880 × 0.367879441.

First, 362880 × 0.3 = 108864.

362880 × 0.06 = 21772.8.

362880 × 0.007 = 2540.16.

362880 × 0.0008 = 290.304.

362880 × 0.00007 = 25.4016.

362880 × 0.000009 = 3.26592.

362880 × 0.000000441 = approximately 0.1605.

Adding all these up:

108864 + 21772.8 = 130636.8

+2540.16 = 133176.96

+290.304 = 133467.264

+25.4016 = 133492.6656

+3.26592 = 133495.93152

+0.1605 ≈ 133496.092.

Wait, that's approximately 133496.092. So the exact value is likely 133496 when rounded, which is option C: 96768 (wait, no, wait, looking back, the options are:

Options:

A: 30240

B: 20160

C: 96768

D: 326592

E: 151200

F: 729

G: 133496

H: 40320

I: 362880

J: 5040

So I calculated approximately 133496, which is option G. But wait, wait a second, I'm a bit confused because 9! is 362880, and 362880 × (1 - 1 + 1/2! - 1/3! + ...) is exactly the derangement number. So the number of derangements should be 133496. So the answer is G.

Wait, but I remember that for n=3, derangements are 2, which is 3!*(1-1 + 1/2 - 1/6) = 6*(0 + 0.5 -0.166666) = 6*(0.333333) = 2. So that's correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be 133496, which is option G.
</think>

The problem asks for the number of derangements of 9 objects, which is calculated using the formula !n = n! × (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - ... + (-1)^n /n!). For n=9, this results in 133496, which matches option G.

Answer: G
