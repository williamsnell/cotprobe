Okay, so I've got this question about a shunt motor's field winding resistance and the power it expends. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the field winding resistance is 110 ohms and the applied voltage is 220 volts. They're asking for the power expended in the field excitation. I remember that in a shunt motor, the field winding is connected in parallel with the armature. So the excitation current is the same for both windings.

Wait, the formula for power in a resistor is power equals current squared times resistance, right? So P = I²R. But I don't know the current. Oh, wait, but the voltage across the field winding is the same as the supply voltage because they're in parallel.

Wait, the supply voltage is 220 volts. So the voltage across the field winding is 220 V. Oh, but wait, no. Let me think again. The shunt motor's armature and field windings are in parallel. So the armature's excitation current I_a and the field's I_f are in parallel. The supply voltage V is the same across both. So the armature's resistance is R_a, and the field's is R_f.

So the armature's resistance is R_a, and the field's is R_f = 110 ohms. But wait, the question gives R_f as 110 ohms. Hmm, but I don't know R_a. Oh wait, the question is about power in the field, so perhaps R_a is connected in series with the field? Or maybe not. Because in shunt, field and armature are in parallel.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the circuit. The supply voltage V is across both windings. So the armature's resistance R_a is in series with the armature current I_a, and the field's resistance R_f is in parallel with the field current I_f. So the voltage across R_f is the same as V, which is 220V. So I_f = V / R_f.

Wait, but the question is about the power in the field, which is P = I_f² * R_f. Since I_f = V / R_f, substituting gives P = (V²)/(R_f²) * R_f = V²/(R_f).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me recheck the formula. Oh wait, no. P = I²R. So I_f is V/R_f, so I_f squared is (V²)/(R_f²). Multiply by R_f, power is (V² R_f)/(R_f²) )= V² / R_f. So P = V² / R_f.

But wait, that doesn't make sense. Because in the question, R_f is 110 ohms and V is 220 V. So V² is 48400, R_f is 110. So 48400 divided by 110 is 440. So 440 watts? But looking at the options, 440 is option H, but wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options provided are:

A:660, B:880, C:200, D:120, E:110, F:330, G:55, H:440, I:500, J:220.

Oh, option H is 440. So according to that, the answer would be H.

Wait but wait a second. Did I make a mistake? Because when I thought about it, the field current is V/R_f, and power is I²R. So I think I did that right. Let me go through the steps again.

V is 220V. R_f is 110 ohms.

I_f = V / R_f = 220 / 110 = 2 A.

Power P = I_f² * R_f = (2)^2 * 110 = 4 * 110 = 440 W.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer is option H, 440 watts.

To determine the power expended in the field excitation of the shunt motor, we use the formula for power in a resistor:

\[
P = I^2 R
\]

Where:
- \( I \) is the current through the field winding,
- \( R \) is the resistance of the field winding.

The field winding resistance is given as \( R_f = 110 \, \Omega \), and the supply voltage is \( V = 220 \, \text{V} \). The current through the field winding is:

\[
I_f = \frac{V}{R_f} = \frac{220}{110} = 2 \, \text{A}
\]

Substituting into the power formula:

\[
P = (I_f)^2 R_f = (2)^2 \times 110 = 4 \times 110 = 440 \, \text{W}
\]

Thus, the power expended in the field excitation is \( 440 \, \text{W} \). Comparing this with the options provided:

- A: 660 W
- B: 880 W
- C: 200 W
- D: 120 W
- E: 110 W
- F: 330 W
- G: 55 W
- H: 440 W
- I: 500 W
- J: 220 W

The correct answer is **H: 440 watts**.
