Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the percentage of world's land area that's forested as of 2015. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers, but I'll try to think through it.

I remember that forests are a significant part of the Earth's surface, but how much exactly? I think there was a study or a report that mentioned this. Wait, I seem to recall that over a third of the world's land is forested. Let me think again. Oh right, around 30-40% is often cited. So looking at the options provided, option D is 60% and option G is 40%. 

Wait, I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should think about the global distribution. I know that countries like Brazil, India, and China have a lot of forests. But does that add up to over 40%? Or is it a bit more than that? I think around 40% is a common figure. So in the options, G is 40%, which would make sense. I don't think the answer is higher like 60%, which would be a lot, but maybe that's the case for a different part of the world.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with another metric, like arable land or agricultural land, but no, the question is about forested land. So the correct answer should be around 40%. Looking back, option G is 40%. So the answer should be G:40%.

The correct answer is G:40%, as it reflects the approximate percentage of world's land area that is forested.
