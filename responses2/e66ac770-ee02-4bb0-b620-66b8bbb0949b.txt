Okay, so I've got this question about the acid-test ratio for ABC Plumbing. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

First, the question gives me ABC's current assets and liabilities. Wait, no, the question says the current assets and liabilities are provided. Wait, no, wait, the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you choose." Oh wait, no, the question is about calculating the acid-test ratio, which is the quick ratio. Acid-test ratio is calculated as (quick assets) divided by (current liabilities), right?

So, quick assets, which are the current assets minus the notes payable. Because quick assets are cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable; you don't include accounts payable because that's part of current liabilities. Okay, so let me list out the numbers.

Current assets:
- Cash: $7,300
- Marketable Securities: $14,200
- Accounts Receivable: $2,120

So quick assets would be the sum of those three: 7,300 + 14,200 + 2,120. Let me add that up.

7,300 +14,200 is 21,500. Then add 2,120: 21,500 + 2,120 = 23,620. So quick assets are $23,620.

Wait, but what about notes payable? Wait, the notes payable is a liability, not an asset. So I should subtract that from the current assets when calculating quick assets.

Wait, no, quick assets are what's on the quick assets list. Quick assets are the current assets without any items that are longer-term. Notes payable is a liability, so it's not part of quick assets. So quick assets are only cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable.

So no, I don't need to subtract anything from the quick assets. The quick ratio is quick assets divided by current liabilities.

Wait, but wait: The current assets include cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable. The notes payable is a liability. So quick assets are only the three mentioned. So I don't subtract anything from quick assets, just the sum.

Wait, but hold on: Quick assets are the same as the current assets excluding the non-quick items. So yes, notes payable is not included in quick assets, so quick assets are 7,300 +14,200 +2,120 = 23,620.

Wait, but wait, the current liabilities are the notes payable and accounts payable. Because current liabilities are a combination of current assets' opposite accounts.

Wait, current liabilities: Notes Payable is $1,400 and Accounts Payable is $1,850. So current liabilities are 1,400 +1,850 = 3,250.

So the acid-test ratio is quick assets (23,620) divided by current liabilities (3,250).

Let me calculate that: 23,620 รท 3,250.

Hmm. Let me compute that.

3,250 goes into 23,620 how many times?

3,250 * 7 is 22,750. Because 3,250*7 = 22,750. Subtract that from 23,620: 23,620 -22,750 = 870.

Then, 870 divided by 3,250 is approximately 0.268. So total is 7.268... So approximately 7.27.

Wait, but wait. Let me do the division more accurately.

3,250 * 7 = 22,750.

23,620 -22,750 = 870.

870 / 3,250 = same as 870 รท 3250.

Let me compute 870 รท 3250.

3250 x 0.268 is approximately 870.

Wait, 3250 * 0.268 = 3250 * 0.2 = 650, 3250 * 0.06 = 195, 3250 *0.008=26. So 650 +195=845 +26=871. So 0.268 is close to 870, so the total is approximately 7.268, which rounds to 7.27.

So the acid-test ratio is approximately 7.27. Looking at the options, that's option G:7.27.

To calculate the acid-test ratio for ABC Plumbing, we first identify the quick assets and current liabilities. Quick assets are the current assets excluding notes payable. The given current assets are:

- Cash: $7,300
- Marketable Securities: $14,200
- Accounts Receivable: $2,120

Summing these gives quick assets of $7,300 + $14,200 + $2,120 = $23,620. The current liabilities include notes payable and accounts payable:

- Notes Payable: $1,400
- Accounts Payable: $1,850

Summing these gives current liabilities of $1,400 + $1,850 = $3,250.

The acid-test ratio (quick ratio) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Quick Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{23,620}{3,250} \approx 7.27
\]

Thus, the acid-test ratio for ABC Plumbing is approximately 7.27.
