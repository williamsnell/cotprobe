Question:

A plaintiff filed a civil action asking for damages resulting from a tortious assault that the defendant inflicted on him. During trial, plaintiff's counsel asked an opposing witness on cross examination: "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" Defense counsel objected to the question. How will the court rule on the objection?

Options:

A: The objection will be sustained because the question is misleading.
B: The objection will be overruled because the question is relevant to the case.
C: The objection will be overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross examination.
D: The objection will be sustained because the question is argumentative.
E: The objection will be overruled because the question is not leading or misleading.
F: The objection will be sustained because the question is irrelevant.
G: The objection will be overruled because leading questions are permitted in this context.
H: The objection will be sustained because the question assumes facts not in evidence.
I: The objection will be sustained because the question is leading.
J: The objection will be overruled because the question is within the allowable scope of cross examination.

Okay, so I've got this question about a civil procedure involving cross-examination. Let me read it carefully. 

The scenario is a plaintiff suing because of a tortious assault. During the trial, the plaintiff's counsel asked a witness cross-examined about whether anyone attempted to leave during the assault. The defense's attorney objected. The question is, how will the court rule on that objection?

Hmm. The options are A to J, each suggesting a different reason why the objection is sustained or overruled. I need to figure out which is the correct answer.

I remember that cross-examination is a serious topic. The key here is whether the question is one that can be answered by the opposing party. If the witness's cross-question is not leading and is not relevant to the case, the objection stands and the question is overruled.

Wait, the witness is being questioned about whether anyone left during the assault. The issue is whether that's a relevant question. Because the assault could have happened at different times, and it's possible that someone was already gone before the assault, or maybe the assault was at a location where someone else was there. But the question is, did anyone leave during the assault.

Is that a good question? Or is it a leading question that the witness can avoid? Because if someone else was present when the assault happened, the witness might be referring to a time before the assault, but the assault itself could have been ongoing. Or perhaps the witness is trying to deny it, but that's more about the witness's credibility.

Wait, but in cross-examination, the witness's role is to provide evidence, not to argue. So if the witness is being asked a question that the opposing party can answer, it's a good question. But if the witness is being asked a question that can be answered by pointing to evidence, like whether someone was near, then that's not a good question.

So the question is about whether anyone attempted to leave during the assault. If the witness's cross-examination is about whether someone left, and if the witness can answer that based on evidence, then the question is not misleading. But if the witness is being asked to prove that someone actually left, that's a leading question because the witness is trying to prove a fact, not to deny it.

Wait, but the witness is being cross-examined about whether someone attempted to leave. So the witness is being asked whether someone had left. If the witness can answer that based on evidence, the question is not misleading. But if the witness is being asked to prove that someone left, that's a leading question because the witness is being told to prove a fact, which is a positive answer, and that's more than a fact-finding question.

Wait, but the witness is being asked a question (the assault happened, so the assault was ongoing), but the witness is being asked whether someone left. So the witness is being asked to deny that someone left. So if someone left, they would say yes, but if not, they say no. But the witness can say yes or no based on evidence.

Wait, but the witness is being asked if someone attempted to leave. So if the witness can show that no one left, then that's a negative answer, but if the witness is being asked to prove that someone left, then that's a positive answer, which is what they would have to show.

But the question is, is the cross-examination question misleading, relevant, leading, etc.

The question is whether the witness can answer a leading question. If the witness is being asked to prove a fact, then it's a leading question. So the witness can't answer without being told to prove a fact, which is a positive answer.

Wait, but the witness's cross-examination is about whether someone attempted to leave. If someone left during the assault, the witness is being asked if they did. If the witness answers yes, that's a positive fact. But if they answer no, that's negative. So in either case, the witness can answer.

But wait, the witness is being cross-examined about whether someone attempted to leave. So the witness is being asked a question that can be answered either way. But the witness can answer whether someone left based on evidence. So the question is not misleading because the witness has the opportunity to answer.

Wait, but the question is about whether someone attempted to leave. So if the witness is being asked that, and if the witness is allowed to answer, then it's not misleading because the witness can answer based on what's on the record. But the question could be whether the assault was forced or not.

Wait, but the issue is whether the question is relevant. The assault happened, and someone could have left. So the cross-examination is about whether someone left, which is a relevant question because it's a fact relevant to the case.

Alternatively, the question could be leading because it's asking to deny the existence of someone leaving. But if the witness is being asked that, then it's a leading question.

Wait, no. The witness is being asked about whether someone attempted to leave. So the witness is being asked a question that can be answered by pointing out evidence. For example, if the witness knows that someone was present when the assault began, they might say no, which would be the negative answer. But if the witness is being asked to prove that someone left, that's a leading question because they are trying to prove a fact, not to deny it.

Wait, but in the context of cross-examining someone, the witness is being asked a question that the opposing party can answer. So if the witness is being asked whether someone attempted to leave, and the witness can answer yes or no based on evidence, then the question is not misleading because the witness is being asked a question that can be answered by evidence.

But wait, another angle: in some cases, leading questions are allowed, but they can be used strategically. However, the issue is whether the question is relevant. If the question is not leading and is not relevant, the objection stands.

Alternatively, the question is whether the witness is being asked a question that the opposing party can answer. Since the witness is being cross-examined about whether someone attempted to leave, and the witness can answer based on evidence, then the question is not misleading. It's also not a leading question because the witness isn't being asked to prove a fact; they're being asked a question about what happened.

Wait, no, if the witness is being asked a question about whether someone left, and the witness can answer based on evidence, that's a good question because the opposing party can answer. So there's no misleading. It's not a leading question because the witness isn't being asked to prove a fact. Leading questions are when the witness is being asked to answer a positive fact, so they're forced to prove it.

So the question is whether the witness is being asked a question that can be answered by evidence, which it is. So the objection is not sustained because the question is relevant and can be answered.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to break it down. When a witness is cross-examined about a specific fact, the question must be a question that can be answered by evidence, not a question that's being asked to prove a fact.

In this case, the witness is being asked about whether someone attempted to leave. The witness can answer based on whether someone was present during the assault, which is a fact in the evidence. So the question is not misleading because the witness can answer. It's also not leading because it's not being asked to prove a fact; it's being asked a question of what happened.

Wait, so the objection is overruled because the question is not misleading and is relevant. Because the witness can answer based on evidence, the question is not leading. So the correct answer would be that the question is not misleading, so the objection is overruled.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the objection is overruled because the question is relevant. Correct because the question is relevant, as it's a fact that's on the record.

Option E says the question is not leading or misleading. Also correct for the same reason.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each stating a reason for the answer. So the options are:

A: Sustained due to misleading
B: Overruled because relevant
C: Overruled because leading
D: Sustained because argumentative
E: Overruled because not leading
F: Sustained because irrelevant
G: Overruled because leading questions permitted
H: Sustained because leading
I: Sustained because leading
J: Overruled because allowable.

So, the correct reasoning is that the question is not misleading (so A is wrong) and it's relevant (B), or whether leading or not (E).

Wait, the standard rule in cross-examining whether someone attempted to leave during the assault. The witness is being asked a question that can be answered based on evidence. So the question is not misleading. It's not a leading question because it's not being asked to prove a fact, but to explain what happened.

So the correct answer would be that the question is not misleading, so the objection is overruled. So the options that fit would be B or E.

Wait, but the question is whether the question is leading or not. If the witness is being asked a leading question (to prove a fact), that's a problem. But if they're being asked a question that can be answered by evidence, it's acceptable.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the question is not misleading, so the objection is overruled. So the correct reasoning is that the question is relevant, so option B.

Wait, but let me think again. If the witness is being asked a question that can be answered, the question is not misleading. So the objection is overruled because the question is relevant (so B is correct). Alternatively, maybe it's overruled because it's not leading (so E is correct).

Wait, but leading questions are when the witness is asked to prove a fact, so it's a positive answer. If they're being asked a question to deny the fact, that's a leading question. If the witness is being asked to prove, it's a positive answer.

In this case, the witness is being asked, "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" So if the witness is being asked, "Did anyone leave during the assault?" then that's a positive fact question. But if the witness is being asked, "Did anyone leave during the assault, and if so, can you prove it?" then it's a leading question because they're being told to prove a fact.

Wait, but in this scenario, the witness is being asked a question of what happened, not a question to prove a fact. So the witness is being asked a question about whether someone left, not whether someone left. So it's a neutral question, but whether it can be answered.

If the witness can answer (e.g., by pointing to the time of the assault or evidence that someone is present), then it's a question that can be answered. So it's relevant, and the question is not misleading.

So the correct answer is that the question is not misleading (so A is wrong), and it's relevant (so B is correct). Alternatively, if the question is not being asked to prove a fact, it's not leading, so E is correct.

Wait, but leading questions are when the witness is being asked to prove a fact. In this case, the witness is being asked a question that the opposing party can answer positively or negatively. If the witness can answer, then it's not a leading question. So the question is neither leading nor misleading.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. The proper rule is that a witness's cross-examination should be a question that can be answered by evidence. If the witness is being asked a question that can be answered by evidence, then it's not misleading. If the witness is being asked a leading question (to prove a fact), it's a problem.

In this case, the witness is being asked whether anyone attempted to leave. The witness can answer yes or no based on the evidence, so it's not misleading. It's not a leading question because they're not being told to prove a fact, but to explain what happened.

So the question is not leading, so it's allowed. Therefore, the answer is B: the objection is overruled because the question is relevant.

Wait, but another angle: if the witness is being asked to prove a fact, then it's a leading question. But in this scenario, the witness is being asked a question that can be answered by the opposing party, not forced to prove a fact. So it's a neutral question, but not a leading one.

So the correct answer is that the question is relevant (so B) and allowed. Therefore, the objection is overruled because the question is relevant.

But wait, what about the options? Looking back, the options are:

B: the question is relevant

E: the question is within the allowable scope

Wait, the correct answer is that the question is not misleading (so A is wrong), and it's relevant (so B is correct). But I'm not sure if the question is allowed as a neutral question or if leading is an issue.

Wait, the key point is whether the question is a leading question. Leading questions are when the witness is being asked to prove a fact. In this case, the witness is being asked a question that the opposing party can answer, either yes or no. So it's a question that can be answered without forcing the witness to prove a fact.

Therefore, the question is not leading and is relevant because it's a fact that's on the record. So the objection is overruled because the question is relevant (B).

But wait, another thought: the question could be a leading question if the witness is being asked to prove a fact. But in this case, the witness is being asked a question that can be answered, so it's not a leading question.

Wait, but the issue is whether the witness is being asked a question that is being asked to prove a fact. If the witness is being asked to prove a fact, it's a leading question. If the witness is being asked a question that can be answered, it's a neutral question.

So if the witness is being asked, "Did anyone attempt to leave during the assault?" then the witness can answer yes or no. But if the witness is being asked, "Did anyone attempt to leave during the assault, and if so, can you prove it?" it's a leading question because the witness is being told to prove a fact.

In this question, the witness is being asked a question that can be answered without being asked to prove a fact. So it's a neutral question, but not leading.

Therefore, the question is not misleading and is within the allowable scope. So the objection is overruled because the question is not leading (E).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to remember the rule: the witness's cross-examination should be a question that can be answered by evidence. If the witness is being asked a question that can be answered without being asked to prove a fact, it's not a leading question. The question is allowed, so it's overruled.

So the correct answer would be option E: the question is within the allowable scope of cross-examination.

Wait, but another angle: if the witness is being asked a question that the opposing party is being asked to prove a fact, then it's a leading question. But in this case, the witness is being asked a question that can be answered, so it's not a leading question. Thus, the question is within the allowable scope.

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but in the options, E says the question is within the allowable scope. So the answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is **E: The objection will be overruled because the question is within the allowable scope of cross examination.**

### Explanation:
The question "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" was being cross-examined to determine whether the witness's cross-examination was misleading or relevant. 

1. **Relevance**: The question is relevant because it pertains to the case and is a fact that the opposing party can address. The witness can answer this question based on evidence, such as whether someone was present during the assault or if any evidence suggests that someone attempted to leave.

2. **Allowed Scope**: The question is within the allowable scope of cross examination because the witness is being asked a question that can be answered by evidence. There is no requirement to frame the question to prove a fact or to avoid a positive answer, which is a positive fact.

3. **Neither Misleading nor Leading**: The question is not misleading because the witness can answer it based on evidence. It is also not a leading question because the witness is being asked a question that can be answered without being forced to prove a fact.

Thus, the objection is overruled because the question is both relevant and within the allowable scope of cross-examination.
