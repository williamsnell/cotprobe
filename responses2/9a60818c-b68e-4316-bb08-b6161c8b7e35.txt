Okay, so I've got this economics question here about Balanced Budget and Net National Product (NNP). Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the government is aiming for a balanced budget by levying taxes of $100 billion and making expenditures of $100 billion. I remember that Balanced Budget usually means that the government's revenue equals its spending, which keeps the budget in check.

The MPC, or Marginal Propensity to Consume, is given as 0.8. MPC is the fraction of additional income that people spend on consumption. So, if MPC is high, people tend to save more. Here, 0.8 means that 80% of the additional income is spent, leaving 20% to be saved.

The question is about how this affects NNP. I'm a bit fuzzy on what NNP is, but I think it's the total national income, or the total output of the economy. The key here is probably to figure out the impact on GDP or NNP when there's a balanced budget.

I remember that in a balanced budget situation, the tax revenue (which is part of GDP) and spending must equalize. But how does that translate into changes in NNP?

Wait, the government's net tax revenue would be taxes minus taxes on the interest from savings. But the question doesn't mention any interest rate, so maybe it's just considering the total tax revenue as net. So, the government's net budget would be zero.

But how does that affect GDP? I think the government spending would be part of GDP, so if the government is spending exactly what it's collecting in taxes, that would keep the economy from growing. Because any growth in GDP would be offset by extra spending.

Wait, let me think about the multiplier effect. If the government increases its spending, it creates jobs, which increases income, and then that income is spent, leading to further increases. But in a balanced budget, the government is exactly spending what it's collecting, so any increase in spending would just be offset by the same amount in tax revenue. That's the point of the balanced budgetâ€”the economy doesn't grow because the extra spending is exactly offset by the same extra tax revenue.

So, in this case, the government is spending $100 billion and collecting $100 billion in taxes. But does that mean there's no change in NNP? Because if you're spending exactly what you're getting from taxes, the economy isn't growing. But wait, NNP is the total output of the economy, so if the government isn't creating any new income, the economy is at potential output. But if the government is spending, wouldn't that affect the economy's potential output?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it in terms of the budget multiplier. The budget multiplier is 1/(1-MPC). So, if MPC is 0.8, the multiplier is 1/(1-0.8) = 1/0.2 = 5. So, a balanced budget leads to a multiplier effect where a dollar increase in spending leads to a 5 dollar increase in NNP. But in this case, the government's budget is balanced, so any spending is offset by the same amount in taxes. So, the net effect is zero.

Wait, but the question is about how the budget being balanced affects NNP. If the government is spending exactly what it's collecting, then the net tax revenue is zero. But how does that affect NNP? The NNP would be the total income generated, which might not change because the government isn't increasing NNP beyond what's already there. Or is it that the government's spending doesn't directly increase NNP but affects it indirectly through the multiplier.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The balanced budget implies that the government's net fiscal policy (government spending minus taxes) is zero. So, the government isn't adding to NNP beyond what is already there because any increase in NNP would be offset by the same increase in taxes. For example, if the economy grows by $100 billion, the government would need to spend $100 billion to maintain the balanced budget. But in this case, the government is already spending $100 billion, so the economy isn't growing. Or maybe I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, if the government spends $100 billion, which comes from taxes, then the economy isn't producing more. So, the NNP (which is the total output) would remain the same because the government isn't creating additional income. Oh wait, no. Because the government's spending is part of NNP. If the economy's NNP is, say, $X, then the government's spending would be a part of that, but the question is about how the balanced budget affects NNP overall.

Wait, perhaps the balanced budget doesn't change NNP because the government isn't creating new income beyond what taxes collect. So, the NNP remains as it was before. But wait, no. Because the government is spending, which contributes to NNP. So, if the government spends an amount equal to taxes, the net effect on NNP would be that it's not creating any new income. Unless the government is using the tax revenue to fund public spending that would otherwise increase NNP.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of the multiplier effect. The balanced budget would mean that the government's spending is exactly equal to the taxes. So, if you increase the government's spending by some amount, the tax revenue would increase by the same amount. But the net effect on NNP would be zero because the increase in government spending (G) would lead to an increase in NNP (because the multiplier is 5), but the increase in taxes (T) would also lead to an increase in NNP. But in a balanced budget, the increase in G would exactly offset the increase in T, so the net change in NNP is zero.

Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me model it with a small example. Suppose MPC is 0.8, so the multiplier is 5. If the government increases its spending by $10 billion, then:

- The government's budget surplus would rise by $10 billion.
- The taxes would rise by $10 billion (since it's a balanced budget, I think this is the case here).
- So, the net budget is zero, but how does this affect NNP?

Wait, no. The government spending is G, which is part of NNP. But the taxes are taxes on the income, so a dollar increase in taxes would mean that the economy's NNP increases by more than the increase in G because of the multiplier.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts here. Let me try another approach. The balanced budget implies that the government's net fiscal outflow (government spending minus taxes) is zero. So, any increase in the government's spending would have to be matched by an increase in taxes. But since the net is zero, the multiplier effect would mean that the increase in spending is offset by the same increase in taxes. But the question is about how this affects NNP.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the government's net fiscal balance. If the government is spending exactly what it's collecting, its net fiscal balance is zero. So, any increase in the government's spending would not lead to a change in NNP beyond the multiplier effect, which is already accounted for. But in this scenario, since the government is already spending exactly the amount from taxes, any increase in NNP would have to come from somewhere else. But wait, in the balanced budget, the government's spending is exactly equal to the tax revenue. So, if the economy's NNP increases because the government is spending more, but the government is already spending the same amount as its taxes, the net effect is no change in NNP.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about NNP in the context of the overall economy. If the government is spending $100 billion, which is exactly what it's collecting, then the net effect on NNP is that the government doesn't increase NNP beyond its current level. But wait, because the government's spending is part of NNP, if the economy's NNP increases by the amount the government spends, then the government's spending would increase NNP by that amount. But in a balanced budget, the government's spending is exactly equal to taxes, so the net effect on NNP would be zero. Because any increase in NNP would have to come from somewhere else, but since the government is spending the same as the tax, the net is zero.

Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think of it this way: the balanced budget implies that the government's net fiscal outflow is zero. So, if the government increases its spending by $100 billion, the taxes would also have to increase by $100 billion to maintain the balanced budget. But the multiplier effect would mean that this $100 billion in spending would lead to an increase in NNP of $500 billion (since the multiplier is 5: 1/(1-0.8)=5). But if the government's spending is offset by the same amount in taxes, then the increase in NNP would be exactly offset by an equal increase in taxes, so the net effect on NNP would be zero. That makes sense.

Wait, but wait a second. If the government is spending $100 billion, which is exactly equal to the tax revenue, then that would imply that the economy's NNP isn't affected because the government isn't creating new income. So, the NNP remains the same as before. But that doesn't align with the options provided. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: Decrease of $500 billion in NNP

B: Increase of $500 billion in NNP

C: Decrease of $100 billion in NNP

D: No change in NNP because taxes cancel out expenditures

E: Increase of $200 billion in NNP

F: Decrease of $80 billion in NNP

G: Increase of $100 billion in NNP

H: Increase of $50 billion in NNP

I: No change in NNP

J: Decrease of $20 billion in NNP

So, option D says no change in NNP because taxes cancel out the government's expenditures.

Wait, but in this scenario, the government isn't creating new income. So, NNP would remain the same as before. But I'm a bit confused because the balanced budget suggests that the government is spending what it's collecting, but that doesn't necessarily mean NNP isn't changing. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the balanced budget implies that the government isn't creating any new income beyond the taxes it's collecting. So, if the government is spending $100 billion, which comes from taxes, the NNP would stay the same because the government isn't creating any new income. So, option D says no change.

But that doesn't seem right because the government is spending, which is part of NNP. Unless the government is spending on things that are already part of NNP, which isn't the case here. So, if the government is spending $100 billion, that's part of NNP. But the taxes are exactly equal to that, so the government isn't creating any new income. So, the NNP would remain the same. So, option D would be correct.

Wait, but the question is about how this affects NNP. If the government is spending $100 billion, which is equal to the tax revenue, then the total NNP is the same because the government isn't adding anything new to the economy. So, the NNP doesn't change, which would be option D.

But wait, another angle: the government's spending is part of NNP. So, if the government is spending $100 billion, NNP increases by that amount. But if MPC is 0.8, the multiplier is 5, so any increase in spending leads to a 5x increase in NNP. But in this scenario, since the government is spending exactly what it's collecting, the increase in spending (G) would be offset by the increase in taxes (T), which would also be G. So, the net effect on NNP would be zero because any increase in G (spending) would have the same effect as any increase in T (taxes), so the net NNP doesn't change.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the balanced budget leads to a multiplier effect where the government's spending is offset by the same amount in taxes, but the government's spending is part of NNP, so it would cause an increase in NNP. But the multiplier would amplify that. So, let's model it: If the government increases its spending by $100 billion, the net fiscal balance is zero, so the government would try to increase T by $100 billion to maintain the balanced budget.

But the multiplier effect would be 5 times the change in G, so NNP would increase by $500 billion. But if the government is spending $100 billion, which is exactly the taxes it's collecting, then the NNP would actually increase by the same amount as the government's spending, because the government is part of NNP. Wait, but the taxes collected are equal to what the government spent, so the net effect on NNP would be zero. Because the government isn't creating any new income beyond what the taxes collect, but the taxes are exactly equal to the government's spending.

Wait, maybe I've got this wrong. Let me think of an example. Suppose the economy's NNP is $200 billion. The government spends $100 billion (which is the same as the tax revenue). So, if the economy's NNP increases by $200 billion, but the government's spending is $100 billion, which is part of that NNP, so the NNP would be the sum of government spending plus whatever else is produced. But if the government is spending $100 billion, and the economy's NNP increases by $200 billion, then the government's spending doesn't affect NNP beyond its own. So, the NNP doesn't change because the government's spending is exactly what the taxes collect. So, NNP remains the same.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because the government is spending, which would contribute to NNP. So, perhaps the correct answer is that NNP doesn't change, so option D is correct.

But wait, maybe I should think about this differently. The balanced budget implies that the government is neither increasing nor decreasing NNP beyond the taxes it collects. So, if the government spends $100 billion, which is exactly what it's getting from taxes, the NNP remains the same as before. So, no change, which is option D.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let's reconsider: the balanced budget leads to spending equal to taxes, so the net fiscal outflow is zero. So, any increase in the government's spending would be offset by an increase in taxes, but since the government is spending the same amount as taxes, the net effect on NNP would be zero.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the government's spending is part of NNP. If the economy's NNP increases, the government's spending would be a part of it. But in a balanced budget, the government isn't creating any new income, so NNP remains the same.

Alternatively, let's think of this as the government's net fiscal balance (government spending minus taxes) is zero. So, the government isn't creating any new income. Therefore, any increase in the government's spending would require an increase in taxes to maintain the balanced budget. But since the multiplier effect would cause the increase in NNP to exactly offset that increase in taxes, the net effect on NNP is zero.

Wait, that would mean that the NNP doesn't change because the increase in G is offset by the same increase in T, which would also cause an increase in NNP. But since G and T are both equal to the same amount, the net effect is zero.

Oh, I'm getting really stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct formula or concept.

Another approach: The balanced budget implies that the government's net fiscal outlay is zero. So, any increase in the government's spending would be offset by an increase in taxes. But because of the multiplier effect, the net increase in NNP would be zero.

Wait, but the government's spending is part of NNP. So, if the government's spending increases by $100 billion, that's added to NNP. But if taxes increase by $100 billion, that would also increase NNP by $100 billion. So, the net effect on NNP would be zero, because the government's spending and taxes are both $100 billion. So, the NNP doesn't change.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D: No change in NNP because taxes cancel out expenditures.
</think>

To determine how the balanced budget affects Net National Product (NNP), we analyze the scenario where the government levies taxes of $100 billion and makes expenditures of $100 billion. Given the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.8, the multiplier effect comes into play.

1. **Balanced Budget**: The government's net fiscal outlay (government spending minus taxes) is zero. This means the government is neither increasing nor decreasing its net income or spending.

2. **Multiplier Effect**: The multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} \). With MPC = 0.8, the multiplier is \( \frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = 5 \). This implies that any increase in government spending will lead to a 5 times increase in NNP.

3. **Net Impact on NNP**: Since the government is spending exactly what it is collecting in taxes, the increase in government spending is offset by an equal increase in taxes. However, the multiplier effect amplifies this relationship. Specifically, the government's spending and taxes are both $100 billion, so the net increase in NNP is zero.

4. **Conclusion**: The balanced budget ensures that the government's spending does not increase NNP beyond the taxes collected. Thus, there is no net change in NNP.
