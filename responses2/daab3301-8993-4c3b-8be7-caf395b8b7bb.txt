Question:

This question refers to the following information.
While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive warâ€¦ most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or "Sea of Precious Virtues," written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.
Robert Irwin, "Islam and the Crusades," 1995
It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.
Ibn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this historical question about Crusading Muslims and their religious beliefs. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about the last character of the answer, which is a letter from the user, so I don't have to worry about that. The main question is about what traditional historical assumptions support the passage mentioned.

The passage talks about several points. First, it says that some theorists argued jihad was a defensive war, while most authorities had a different view. I think this was about the Crusaders and their religious stance. Then it mentions the Bahr, which is a text that discusses the role of rulers in jihad. It says that the ruler must prosecute and win, and if they don't, peace with infidelities would kill them.

Then there's a passage from Robert Irwin about Islam and Crusades, which mentions Christians treating Muslim hermits with kindness. Also, it says some Muslim merchants weren't hindered in their territories.

The question is about which traditional historical assumption is supported by the first passage.

Looking at the options, they're all traditional assumptions about Muslims in the Crusading era's religious practices.

Option A: They were driven by economic gain rather than religious fervor. The passage doesn't mention anything about economic factors or religious fervor. It's more about military obligation and religious duties.

Option B: They were focused on peaceful coexistence. The first passage mentions that Christians treat Muslim hermits kindly, but it doesn't imply that Muslims were mainly peaceful. It's more about the rulers' obligations.

Option C: More interested in scholarly pursuits. The passage talks about the Bahr and rulers' duties, but nothing about scholarly interests.

Option D: More peaceful. Again, the passage doesn't say that Muslims were more peaceful. It's about their military obligations and treating hermits.

Option E: Driven by Islamic faith for violence. The passage says rulers must prosecute and win, so this seems to align with Islamic beliefs about war. The passage doesn't discuss whether Muslims were driven by faith or not, just their obligations.

Option F: Only protecting own territory. The passage doesn't support this; it talks about treating hermits and merchants, not just their own territories.

Option G: Holy war ideology taken seriously. The passage mentions that some theorists argued about jihad as a defensive war, but it doesn't say it was taken seriously. It more about the structure of jihad.

Option H: Holy war dismissed. The passage doesn't dismiss the ideology; it's more about the structure of jihad and its obligations.

Option I: Indifferent to holy war. The passage supports the thesis that the ruler must prosecute and win, so the assumption in the passage is that holy war was taken seriously, not dismissed. So the assumption is that holy war was considered a valid form of war, not dismissed.

Option J: Convert Christians to Islam. The passage doesn't say anything about this, just about hermits and merchants.

So the first passage's point is about the obligations of rulers regarding jihad. It doesn't directly state that Muslims were driven by Islamic faith for the sake of war (option E), but it does support the idea that the Islamic view of jihad as a necessary war was considered. So the assumption is that holy war was taken seriously, which points to option H or F? Wait, no. The passage doesn't mention that Muslims were primarily focused on peaceful. It's about their military duties and treating hermits.

Wait, the passage says that the Bahr insists the ruler must prosecute and win. That's about the religious obligation, not the personal religious choice of the Muslims. So the assumption in the passage is that holy war was considered a form of war, not dismissed. So the traditional assumption is that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously.

Looking at the options, option H says that the ideology was dismissed, and option F says they were only focused on protecting their own territories.

Wait, the passage doesn't say anything about Muslims being more peaceful or focused on coexistence. It's about their obligations, so none of the options except maybe option H or F.

Looking again, the passage supports the assumption that holy war was taken seriously. So the assumption is that the ideology was seriously considered, not dismissed.

So the correct option is H: The ideology of holy war was dismissed by Muslim elites during the crusading era.

Wait, but the passage says that the elite believed in fighting and winning. So the assumption is that holy war was taken seriously, which is option H. However, the options are about traditional assumptions.

Wait, the question is which traditional assumption is supported by the passage. So the passage supports the belief that holy war was taken seriously, which is option H.

But wait, another angle: the passage says that the Bahr insists the ruler must prosecute and win, which implies that holy war was seen as a necessary form of war, so the elite thought it was serious. So the traditional assumption is that holy war was taken seriously. So the correct option is H.

But wait, the passage says that the rulers were required to prosecute and win. So the assumption in the passage is that holy war was taken seriously. So the traditional assumption is that holy war was considered seriously, which is option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, the passage does not directly mention that. It's more about the structure of jihad's obligation. So the traditional assumption is that holy war was taken seriously by the elites. So the correct answer is H. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the passage says that the rulers must prosecute and win, which is about the structure of jihad, not about the religious preference. So the traditional assumption is that holy war was taken seriously, which is option H.

So the correct answer is option H.

The passage describes the obligations of Muslim rulers during the Crusading era, focusing on the structure of jihad and its necessity for victory. It does not explicitly state that Muslims were primarily focused on peaceful coexistence or economic gain. Instead, it emphasizes the requirements of jihad and its obligations, which aligns with traditional assumptions about Islamic beliefs.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the passage does not suggest economic gain over religious fervor.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it focuses on hermit treatment rather than general peace.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it does not discuss scholarly pursuits.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it does not imply peaceful focus.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as the passage does not discuss Islamic faith for war.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it does not focus on territorial protection.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as it does not mention the ideology of holy war.
- **Option H**: Correct, as the passage supports the idea that holy war was taken seriously.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it does not state indifference to holy war.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as it does not discuss conversion to Islam.

The traditional assumption supported by the passage is that holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the Crusading era.

**ANSWER: H**
