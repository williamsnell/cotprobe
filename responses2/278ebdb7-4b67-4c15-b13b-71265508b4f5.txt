Okay, so I've got this question here about memory strategies, specifically about how Elise memorized her phone number. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that Elise was using a memory technique while pulling over to call in. She had to be the seventh caller to win, and she had to remember her phone number. So, I need to figure out which memory strategy she used here.

First, let me recall what each of these memory types is. The options are:

A: Maintenance rehearsal
B: Chunking
C: Long-term memory
D: Iconic memory
E: Elaborative rehearsal
F: Selective attention
G: Procedural memory
H: Episodic memory
I: Echoic memory
J: Semantic memory

I remember that maintenance rehearsal is a method where you practice recalling something you've just learned. It's about internalizing the information so it becomes permanent. On the other hand, chunking is when you break down large amounts of information into smaller chunks to remember them more effectively. Episodic memory is about remembering specific events, while semantic memory is about general knowledge.

Elaborative rehearsal involves using the memory to solve a problem or complete a task, which helps in preserving the information. Elaborative rehearsal seems relevant here because Elise was trying to remember the phone number, possibly by using it as a test.

Chunking could be useful if she had a long number, but the question doesn't specify how long the number was. Maintenance rehearsal would help her retain the number even if she forgets it later. Selective attention is about focusing on certain things, which she was using to pull over, so that might not be it.

Procedural memory is about knowing how to perform tasks, which I don't think she used here. Episodic memory is about specific events, so if she was recalling a past event, that might fit, but she was just trying to remember the number, not a specific event.

Wait, she was trying to remember the number, which is a specific piece of information. Maintenance rehearsal is about recalling what you've just learned, so she was probably trying to remember the number she just heard. Alternatively, if the number was long, chunking could help by breaking it into parts.

Wait, but maintenance rehearsal is a strategy where you practice recalling, which is what she's doing. She was repeating the number to herself, which is using maintenance rehearsal. Alternatively, chunking could be applied if she broke the number into smaller parts, but the question doesn't specify if she used that.

Alternatively, maybe she was using elaborative rehearsal because she was using the number as a way to test herself or complete a task, which would help in retaining it.

Wait, but the question is about which technique she used when she was pulling over to call in. So, she was trying to remember the number, which is a specific memory task. Maintenance rehearsal is when you practice to remember something you've just learned. So, that seems to fit.

So, the answer would be A: Maintenance rehearsal.

But I should double-check. Another strategy is elaborative rehearsal, where you use the task to remember it. So, if she was using the number as a test, that's elaborative. But the question says she was repeating the number to herself. That sounds more like maintenance rehearsal because it's about recalling, not using as a test.

Alternatively, maybe she was using chunking if the number was long. But without knowing the length, it's not clear. However, maintenance rehearsal is a more general term that fits the scenario of trying to remember something she just heard.

So, the correct answer is A: Maintenance rehearsal.

The correct answer is A: Maintenance rehearsal. Elise was using this strategy to remember the phone number by practicing recalling it, which fits the scenario of trying to remember a specific piece of information.

Answer: A
