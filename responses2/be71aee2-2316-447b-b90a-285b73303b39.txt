Okay, so I've got this question about Sandel's case against moral engineering. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Sandel was involved in an ethics case that's been talked about a lot. The case involved a company that engaged in what they thought was moral engineering. Moral engineering is a concept where a company uses professional ethics to influence the behavior of a non-profits, charities, or similar entities. The idea is that by applying professional ethics, the company can improve the behavior of these entities, which in turn could hurt the interests of a donor or the public.

So, Sandel's case was about whether this approach is permissible or not. I think he decided against it, but I'm not entirely sure. I remember something about it being related to a particular ethical theory. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them. The options are about different ethical theories: ethics of care, natural law, ethics of prima facie duty, deontological, etc.

Sandel's case is often cited in discussions about the application of consequentialism and the ethics of prima facie duty. I think he argued against the ethics of care, which is an approach that focuses on the individual's ethical obligations. He believed that applying professional ethics could undermine these obligations, leading to bad consequences for the non-profits.

Wait, what about the ethics of prima facie duty? That's the idea that an agent's duty to do something is based on what they can reasonably expect to be done, regardless of what they might do. If a company uses professional ethics to influence behavior, it might create a situation where the individual doesn't have a prima facie duty, so it's not a valid ethical action. 

Alternatively, Sandel might have been against the deontological approach, which focuses on the impermissible actions, and the consequentialist approach, which is about the outcomes of actions. He probably didn't think that using professional ethics would lead to the desired consequences for the non-profits.

Looking at the options, option H is a Kantian approach, and option I is a consequentialist approach. I'm not sure which applies here. But I think he was against both. He also wasn't using a deontological approach, which is option D.

Option E is existentialism, which deals with the inherent good and bad in individuals, but I don't think that's relevant here. So, the case is more about applied ethics.

Option J is a utilitarian approach, which is about maximizing overall good. But Sandel's case was more about the structure of the law and the ethics, not about maximizing utility.

The options for the theories: A is ethics of care, which he opposed. B is natural law, which is about the inherent laws of society. C is ethics of prima facie duty, which he supported against. So, he probably thought that using professional ethics could create a situation where the non-profits don't have a prima facie duty to act as they would otherwise.

So the case is best considered as an application of the ethics of prima facie duty. That would make option C the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure. Another thought: is there any chance that it's a natural law theory approach? No, because natural law is more about the inherent laws of society and how they apply. He was against that, but maybe not using that approach.

Alternatively, if he opposed the ethics of care, then A is correct, but I think he's more against the prima facie duty. So I think C is the better fit.

The case involving Sandel's decision against moral engineering best fits the application of the ethics of prima facie duty, as discussed. 

Answer:
C: an application of the ethics of prima facie duty.
