Question:

Two cousins took title to real estate as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?

Options:

A: Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.
B: Yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan.
C: No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.
D: No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.
E: Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.
F: No, because the first cousin's debt did not affect the second cousin's rights to the property.
G: Yes, because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan.
H: Yes, because the first cousin's debt was not settled before his death, hence the property cannot be sold until the debt is settled.
I: No, because the second cousin did not have knowledge of the first cousin's debt before his death.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate question about joint tenants and lien enforcement. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

So the situation is two cousins who took out a joint tenancy in real estate. They each have a share in the property, but it's a joint tenancy, which means neither owns the full property themselves. Instead, they each have a right of survivorship, which I think means that if one of them dies, the other takes over. But wait, I think in a joint tenancy, the right of survivorship is usually a limitation on the property. So if one cousin dies, the other owns the remaining property, but the right is limited.

In this case, the first cousin set up his interest as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. That's interesting. So he's using his interest as security for a judgment, which would be a judgment note. Then, it was later entered as a judgment against his interest. Oh, wait, so a judgment note is a type of judgment, right? So the first cousin's note came into being as a judgment.

Then, a year after that, the first cousin died. The second cousin tried to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. So the second cousin is suing the mortgagee, claiming that the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property.

The second cousin is defending by saying that any lien on the first cousin's interest is extinguished upon his death. The question is whether the court will enforce the mortgagee's lien against the second cousin's sale.

Looking at the options, the options are A to I, with E and I being the last options.

So I need to think about what happens with joint tenancies and liens. Let me recall some real estate law. In a joint tenancy, each joint tenant has a right of survivorship, meaning they can't claim the entire property. However, liens or liens on a joint tenant's interest don't automatically terminate unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, but in this case, the first cousin's note was a judgment against his interest. So I think that the second cousin can sue for the lien if it's a lien on the joint tenant's interest. Now, the problem is whether the second cousin's right of survivorship applies here. Because if the second cousin is suing, he's claiming that the first cousin's interest is gone, so the second cousin owns the property.

But wait, in a joint tenancy, the right of survivorship is a limitation. So when the first cousin dies, the second cousin becomes the sole owner of the property. So, any liens or encumbrances on the first cousin's share would be extinguished upon his death, right? Because the right of survivorship doesn't allow the second cousin to claim the first cousin's interest. So, if the first cousin's interest is still in the property, the lien should be extinguished.

Wait, but the first cousin's note was a judgment against his interest. So, when he dies, does the lien on his interest get extinguished? Or does it stay?

I remember that in some jurisdictions, if a joint tenant has a right of survivorship, and a joint tenant has a lien on their interest, that lien is considered to have been extinguished upon the joint tenant's death. Wait, but is the lien on the joint tenant's interest considered extinguished, or is it a lien on the property that's owned by the other tenant?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nature of the lien. If the first cousin's interest is in the property, and the second cousin is suing for the right of survivorship, which would mean the second cousin owns the property, but the lien is still attached to the first cousin's interest. So the second cousin's right of survivorship might not affect the lien, because the lien is against the first cousin's share.

Wait, but in a joint tenancy, the right of survivorship is a limitation. So when the first cousin dies, the second cousin becomes the sole owner. But the right of survivorship doesn't automatically mean that the property is owned by the other tenant. So if the second cousin wants to enforce the lien on the first cousin's interest, would they be able to?

Alternatively, perhaps the lien is on the second cousin's property. Wait, no, the question says the lien was against the first cousin's interest. So the property is still owned by the first cousin, but the lien is against his interest. So when the first cousin dies, the second cousin owns the entire property. But the lien is still on the first cousin's share, so the lien isn't extinguished. Therefore, the second cousin can sue for the lien, but the second cousin may not have the right to actually own the property unless there's a right of survivorship affecting it.

Wait, no, the second cousin is the survivor, so he can actually own the property. So the issue is whether the lien is extinguished upon the first cousin's death.

Wait, but if the first cousin's interest was in the property, and the second cousin's right of survivorship applies, then the second cousin owns the property. But does that mean the lien on the first cousin's interest is extinguished?

I think that the right of survivorship doesn't automatically extinguish the lien on the joint tenant's interest. Instead, the joint tenant's interest in the property is still valid, but the lien would be against their interest. So if the second cousin sues for the lien, he would have to prove that the lien is a lien on the property and not a lien on the second cousin's share.

Wait, but the question states that the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan. So the second cousin is suing for the lien against the first cousin's interest, but the second cousin is the one who owns the property now. So the lien must be against the second cousin's share, not the first cousin's.

Wait, but the first cousin's interest is a lien against the property, right? So if the second cousin is the owner, would the lien be extinguished? Because the lien was against the first cousin's interest (which is now in the second cousin's ownership), so the lien would be extinguished.

Wait, no. The right of survivorship doesn't extinguish the lien on the joint tenant's interest. It's about the ownership of the property. So the first cousin's lien is against his interest, which is in the second cousin's property. Therefore, the lien would be extinguished, because the second cousin now owns the property. So the second cousin can't sue for the lien because the lien is against the second cousin's interest.

Wait, but the problem is that the first cousin's interest is a lien against the property. So the second cousin's right of survivorship doesn't affect that. Let me think again.

When a joint tenancy exists, the right of survivorship is a limitation on the property. So when the first cousin dies, the second cousin owns the property. However, the right of survivorship doesn't automatically mean that the property is owned by the survivor. It's a limitation on the property's use. So the second cousin could still have a right to the property, but it may not own the property outright.

Wait, but the right of survivorship is a limitation on the property's use, not on the ownership. So the second cousin can still own the property, but it's a joint tenancy, and the right of survivorship doesn't automatically extinguish the lien on the joint tenant's interest. The lien is against the joint tenant's interest; the second cousin owns the property, but the lien is against the first cousin's share, which is now part of the second cousin's property.

So the second cousin can sue for the lien because it's a lien against the joint tenant's interest, which is now part of the second cousin's ownership. Wait, no. Wait, the second cousin's ownership of the property doesn't mean that the lien is extinguished. The lien was against the first cousin's interest, which is still in the second cousin's property. So the lien would be extinguished upon the first cousin's death because the second cousin owns the property.

Wait, but then the second cousin doesn't have the right to enforce the lien because the lien is against the second cousin's property. Or does it? Because the lien was against the first cousin's interest. So the second cousin's right of survivorship would allow him to own the property, but the lien is against the first cousin's interest, which is still in the second cousin's property. So the lien is extinguished because the second cousin's ownership includes the first cousin's interest.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think in terms of the right of survivorship. If the first cousin dies, the second cousin owns the property. Now, any claims against the first cousin's interest would still apply. So if the second cousin sues for the lien against the first cousin's interest, could the second cousin successfully enforce it?

But wait, the mortgagee is suing the second cousin to enforce his interest, not the first cousin's. So the second cousin is suing for the lien, bringing up the first cousin's interest. But if the second cousin owns the property, why would he have a right to enforce a lien against the first cousin's interest? Because the lien was against the first cousin's interest, which is now in the second cousin's property.

Wait, no, because the lien was against the first cousin's interest, which is still in the second cousin's ownership. So the lien would be extinguished if the first cousin's interest is gone. Or, perhaps, the lien is against the joint tenant's interest, which is now part of the second cousin's property, so the lien is extinguished.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the right of survivorship doesn't extinguish the lien on the joint tenant's interest. So the second cousin can sue for the lien because it's a lien on the first cousin's interest, which is still in the second's ownership. So the second cousin can claim the lien.

But the options are about whether the court will enforce the lien. So, the second cousin is suing for the lien against the first cousin's interest, but the second cousin owns the property. So if the lien is against the first cousin's interest, which is now in the second cousin's share, the lien shouldn't be enforceable because the second cousin owns the property.

Wait, but that's not quite right. Because the second cousin is the owner. So perhaps he can sue for the lien because it's a lien on the property, which he owns, but the lien was against the first cousin's interest. So the lien is against the second cousin's property, not his own. So the second cousin can sue for the lien because it's a lien against the second cousin's property.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the options again.

Option E says yes, because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan.

Option B says yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest.

So, the second cousin is the one suing against the mortgagee. The mortgagee is the lien holder.

If the second cousin's right of survivorship allows him to own the property, then he can sue for the lien. But in a joint tenancy, the right of survivorship doesn't extinguish the lien on the joint tenant's interest. So the lien is against the joint tenant's interest, which is still in the second cousin's ownership, so the lien would be extinguished.

Wait, but the second cousin's right of survivorship doesn't affect the lien on the joint tenant's interest. So perhaps the lien is still in effect.

Alternatively, maybe the right of survivorship doesn't allow the second cousin to claim the first cousin's interest. So the second cousin can't sue for the lien because it's against his own property, not his right to survivorship.

Wait, but the first cousin's interest is in the second cousin's property, so the lien is on the second cousin's property. So the second cousin can indeed enforce the lien because it's against his own property, not his right of survivorship.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about what a joint tenancy does. In a joint tenancy, each joint tenant has a right of survivorship, which means the other joint tenant becomes the owner of the property upon the death of the first. However, the right of survivorship doesn't extinguish the lien on the joint tenant's interest. Instead, the lien remains against the joint tenant's interest, which is still in the second cousin's property.

So the second cousin can sue for the lien because it's against the first cousin's interest, which is now in the second cousin's ownership. Therefore, the court will enforce the lien against the second cousin's property. But the second cousin is the one who owns the property now, but the lien is against the first cousin's interest, so the lien is extinguished.

Wait, but the second cousin's ownership doesn't affect the right of survivorship. So the second cousin can still own the property, but the lien is against the first cousin's interest. So the second cousin can sue for the lien.

Wait, but in that case, the second cousin can't actually claim the first cousin's interest because the first cousin's interest is gone, right? So the lien would be extinguished, so the second cousin can't sue for it because it's against his own property.

Wait, I'm getting myself tangled here. Let me think about what the options say.

Option E: Yes, because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan.

So, the mortgagee has a valid claim. That would mean that the mortgagee can recover the second cousin's share because the first cousin's interest is a lien, which the mortgagee has the right to enforce.

Alternatively, option B says yes because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest.

I think the correct reasoning is that the first cousin's interest is a lien on the property, which the second cousin can sue for, but the second cousin would have the right of survivorship. However, the right of survivorship doesn't extinguish the lien on the joint tenant's interest. So the lien would be extinguished. Therefore, the second cousin can't sue for the lien because it's against his own property, not the joint tenant's.

Wait, no. The second cousin owns the property, but the lien is against the joint tenant's interest. So the lien is extinguished because the joint tenant's interest is gone. So the second cousin can't actually claim the lien, because the lien is extinguished. Thus, the court shouldn't enforce the lien.

Wait, but the second cousin is the one who owns the property. So if the lien is against the joint tenant's interest, which is now in the second's property, the lien would be extinguished. So the second cousin can't enforce it because the lien is gone.

So the court would not enforce the lien, which would make options E and B incorrect.

Wait, but the question is whether the court will enforce the lien. So if the lien is extinguished, the court won't enforce it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is whether the lien is enforceable against the second cousin's property. If the lien was against the joint tenant's interest, which is now part of the second cousin's property, then the lien is still on his property. So the second cousin can sue for the lien.

Wait, but the first cousin's right of survivorship doesn't affect the lien on the joint tenant's interest. So the lien would still be against the second cousin's property. So the second cousin can sue for the lien, and the court would enforce it because it's a lien on his property.

Wait, but the second cousin is the survivor, so he can own the property. Therefore, if the lien is against the joint tenant's interest, which is now part of his property, then the lien is extinguished. So the court can't enforce it.

I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: Yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan.

Option E: Yes, because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan.

So, the mortgagee's claim is a valid one, so the second cousin could sue for it. But the second cousin is the survivor, so would he have a right to enforce the lien? Or would the lien be extinguished because the joint tenant's interest is gone?

Wait, no, the lien was against the joint tenant's interest, which remains in the second cousin's property. So the lien is still a lien on the second cousin's property, so the second cousin can sue for it.

But then, the second cousin's right of survivorship doesn't allow him to claim the joint tenant's interest. So the second cousin can't actually own the joint tenant's interest. So the lien is against the second cousin's property, so the second cousin can sue for it.

Wait, but that would mean the court can enforce the lien against the second cousin's property, which he owns. So the second cousin can sue for the lien, and the court would enforce it because it's a lien on the second cousin's property.

Alternatively, the right of survivorship doesn't affect the lien on the joint tenant's interest. So the lien is still against the second cousin's property, so the second cousin can sue for the lien and the court would enforce it.

Wait, but E says yes because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's loan. So the second cousin can sue for the lien because it's a lien on the property, not on the joint tenant's interest.

So, the court would enforce the lien against the second cousin's property. So the second cousin can sue, and the court would enforce the lien.

Wait, but the option E is Yes because the mortgagee has a valid claim. So the second cousin can sue for the lien. So the correct answer would be E.

But then, I thought the second cousin can't claim the joint tenant's interest, so the lien is not extinguished. So the court can enforce the lien against the second cousin's property. So E would be correct.

Wait, but why would the second cousin own the property? Because the first cousin died, and the second became the sole owner. So the second cousin owns the property, and the lien is against the joint tenant's interest, which is now part of the second cousin's property. So the lien is still a lien on the second cousin's property, so the court must enforce it.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Yes, because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the second cousin can't claim the joint tenant's interest because that's part of the second's ownership. So the lien is still against the second's property, so the court can enforce it.

So the answer should be E.
</think>

The correct answer is E. Here's the reasoning:

When the first cousin died, the second cousin became the sole owner of the property due to the right of survivorship. The first cousin's note was a lien against the joint tenant's interest, and since the second cousin owns the property, the lien remains against his property. The mortgagee, as the lien holder, has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan. The court can enforce the lien against the second cousin's property because the lien was against the joint tenant's interest, which is now part of the second cousin's ownership.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A and B**: These options incorrectly imply that the second cousin can claim the first cousin's interest, which is extinguished upon the first cousin's death. Instead, the lien remains against the second cousin's property.
- **C**: Incorrect because the joint tenant's right of survivorship doesn't extinguish the lien on their interest.
- **D**: Incorrect because the second cousin is not the survivor; the survivor is the second cousin upon the first cousin's death.
- **E**: Correct because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's loan, allowing the court to enforce the lien against the second cousin's property.

ANSWER: E
