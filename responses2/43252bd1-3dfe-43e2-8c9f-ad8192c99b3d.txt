Question:

A man is the owner of record of a parcel of land designated as "A. " It is the highest of three neighboring properties on a mountain. The man's friend is the owner of parcel "B," which is situated lower than "A" on the mountainside. The man's cousin owns parcel "C," which lies below parcels "A" and "B" on the mountain slope. In 2000, the man who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel "A" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the man sold parcel "B" to his friend. The following year, the cousin purchased parcel "C" from the man. The deeds to the friend and the cousin did not contain any mention of the man's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. From the standpoint of the friend and the cousin, thedrainage system would most likely be defined as a(an)

Options:

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is about a man who owns three parcels of land on a mountain. The highest one is parcel A, then parcel B is lower, and parcel C is the lowest. The man's friend owns B, and his cousin owns C. In 2000, they all sold all three parcels together, building a private drainage system that connects all three. The system had an underground pipeline, and the sewage from A ran into a municipal sewer at the bottom. Then, in 2005, the friend bought B, and the cousin bought C the next year. The question is about what the friend and cousin's view of the drainage system would be, given that their deeds didn't mention the system.

I remember that easements can be created in different ways. There are express easements, implied easements, and others like by necessity, by implication, etc. 

Express easements are created by the owner of the parcel, often because they have a legal right to use it, like a right of way. The owner can't be wrong, so it's an express right.

Implied easements are when someone else grants the owner the right to use it without the owner proving it. It's more about the person granting the right.

Easements by necessity are created when the owner cannot claim otherwise because of necessity (like needing water or electricity). The owner can't use the parcel unless it meets a necessity.

Easements by implication are when someone else grants the owner the right by implication, which is when they use the parcel without the owner proving it, or it's implied by the use.

So, the drainage system was constructed by the man in 2000. The friend bought parcel B in 2005, and the cousin bought C in 2006. The friend and cousin didn't mention the system on their deeds, so they don't know about it.

The question is about what the friend and cousin perceive the system as. Since they didn't mention it on their deeds, it's likely implied or expressed. But the key is that the friend bought B, which was part of the drainage system. So, the friend, as the owner of B, might have a right to use it, which would make the system an implied easement.

Wait, but the man's friend owns B. When the system was built, it connected all three parcels. So the system includes A, B, and C. The friend's deed only includes B, which was part of the system. So, the friend could use the system because they own B. Alternatively, the friend might have a right of way to the system because they own B, which is part of the network.

But in terms of easement types, if the owner of the parcel grants the right to use it (like the friend), that's an implied easement. So the friend would have an implied easement over the system because they own part of it.

Wait, but the system included all three. Does the friend have a right over the entire system, or just the part he owns? The friend owns B, which was part of the drainage system. So, he might have a right to use B, which is part of the system.

So, the friend and cousin, as owners of B and C, respectively, would have the right to use the system. So, the system would be an implied easement because the friend (the owner of B) grants the right to use it. Alternatively, it's implied because the owner of the parcel (B) grants the right to use the entire system, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another thought. If the friend had the right of way to parcel A, which is part of the system, then the friend would have an easement over parcel A. But parcel B is part of the system, so the friend would have an easement over B, which is part of the system.

So, the friend's claim is that he has an easement over the system because he owns part of it ( parcel B). Alternatively, since the system is part of parcel A, and the friend owns B, perhaps the friend can use the system because he owns B, which is part of the system.

But the system is the whole network. So, for the friend, the system includes A, B, and C. So the friend would have a right to use the system because he owns B, which is part of it. So the friend's claim is that he has an implied easement over the entire drainage system because he owns B, which is part of it. Alternatively, the friend might have an implied easement over parcel B, which is part of the system.

Wait, but the system includes all three parcels. So, if the friend has a right of way to parcel B, which is part of the system, then he has an implied easement over the system because he has a right to use it through parcel B.

Alternatively, the system is the entire network, so the friend could use the system because he owns part of it. So, the friend's claim would be that he has an implied easement over the system because he owns parcel B, which is part of the system.

So, looking at the options, the possible answers are:

A: easement by necessity.
B: profit à taken.
C: easement by implication.
D: easement in gross.
E: express easement.
F: license.
G: equitable servitude.
H: natural easement.
I: prescriptive easement.

The most likely answer is that the friend and cousin have an implied easement over the system because they own parts of it. So, the correct option is C: easement by implication.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If the friend owns parcel B, which is part of the drainage system, then he can use the system. So, he has a right to use it, making the system an implied easement.

Alternatively, the system is the network, so the friend has an implied right to use it because he owns part of it. So, the correct answer is C, easement by implication.
</think>

The drainage system consists of three parcels (A, B, and C). The friend owns parcel B, which is part of the system, and the cousin owns parcel C. The system was constructed by the man in 2000, and the friend and cousin bought parcels B and C in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Their deeds did not mention the system, so it is likely implied or expressed.

Implied easements are created by granting the owner the right to use the parcel without the owner proving it. Since the friend owns parcel B, which is part of the system, he has a right to use it, making the system an implied easement.

**Answer: C: easement by implication.**
