Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about family therapy being contraindicated. Let me read through the options again.

The question is: "Family therapy is probably contraindicated in which of the following situations?" The options are A to F, with F being financial stress.

I remember that family therapy, if I recall correctly, is mainly recommended for situations where the family members are struggling together, especially when there's a tough time together. It's used to strengthen bonds and help address problems that might be causing tension.

Looking at the options:

Option A: One of the family members has severe depression. Hmm, that seems like a problem that family therapy can handle. So this situation is not contraindicated. So A is not the correct answer.

Option B: They're dealing with the loss of a loved one. That's a tough situation, but family therapy can help. So B is not contraindicated either.

Option C: Family members attribute their problems to one of the members. That sounds like they're stuck in a cycle of blaming each other, which is a problem for family therapy. So C might be a contraindicated situation.

Option D: Sibling rivalry. That's a common family issue. Family therapy can help address these conflicts, so D isn't contraindicated.

Option E: Moving to a new city. That's just relocation, which is a personal issue. Family therapy might not be directly applicable here, but it's not necessarily contraindicated. It might depend on the family's current dynamics, but this seems unrelated.

Option F: Financial stress. Financial issues can arise from various family dynamics, but family therapy can provide support in financial matters. So F isn't contraindicated.

So, the contraindicated situation would be when family therapy isn't recommended. Looking back, family therapy is contraindicated when there are strong emotional attachments or conflicts within the family. Option C is about attributions, which is a problem for family therapy. Option D is sibling rivalry, which is a family issue that can be addressed. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: "Family members attribute their problems to one of the members."

Family therapy is contraindicated when family members attribute their problems to others within the family, as this can create emotional conflicts and hinder the family's ability to support each other. 

Answer: C
