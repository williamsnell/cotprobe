Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Yi Yin sacrificed to the former king, and presented the heir-king reverently before the shrine of his grandfather. . . . Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.
"Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.
"Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Daoist beliefs. Let me see... I remember that Daoist thought is part of the Chinese philosophical tradition, especially the Confucianism influenced by the Chinese classics like the Analects of Confucius. Daoist ideas often focus on the flow of things, harmony, and the natural state of the universe.

The question gives a Chinese text excerpt about Yi Yin, a shaman who was instructed by his grandfather. The text talks about Yi Yin's teachings and later references to the "Meritorious Ancestor" and the "good-doer" from the Heavens. The question is asking which phrase represents a statement of Daoist beliefs.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess." I think this is talking about the Shang king's abilities, which is a historical figure, not directly Daoist. He's more associated with Confucianism, like Yi Yin's teacher.

Option B: "The former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together." Bonds holding men together might relate to Confucian values of family and social order. But Daoist ideas often emphasize harmony and the flow of things, more about the universe rather than individual bonds.

Option C: "The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature." This sounds like a statement about the natural world. Daoist thought might emphasize the natural state of things, but this seems more about the physical world rather than the spiritual or social aspects.

Option D: "The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings." This directly references the Heavens' teachings, which are central to Daoist thought. The idea that the Heavens' actions (or in this case, their influence) determine outcomes, like the good-doer sending blessings. This aligns with the philosophical belief that the universe operates in accordance with its will, and that the Heavens' actions (or decisions) shape the world.

So, the key point is that Daoist beliefs often emphasize the role of the Heavens in shaping the world and the natural order. D seems to fit that.

The correct answer is D: "The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings." This phrase reflects the Daoist belief that the Heavens' actions determine outcomes, emphasizing the natural order and the influence of divine forces.

Answer: D
