Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Mr. Lucci and his pens. Let me read it carefully.

The question says he made 5 bags of pens. Each bag has 19 black pens and 12 red pens. They're asking which expression shows the total number of pens. The options are A to J.

Hmm, so I need to figure out the total pens. Let me think about the math here. Each bag has 19 + 12 pens, right? Because 19 black and 12 red. So 19 + 12 equals 31 pens per bag. 

Since there are 5 bags, the total should be 5 multiplied by 31. So that would be 5 × (19 + 12). Let me check the options.

Option A is 19 × (5 + 12). That's 19 × 17, which is 323. But that doesn't make sense because each bag has 31 pens, so 5 ×31 is 155. So A is wrong.

Option B is (5 + 19) ×12. That's 24 ×12 = 288. That's way higher than 155, so B is wrong.

Option C is 5 - (19 + 12). That's 5 -31 = -26. No, can't be pens negative. So C is wrong.

Option D is 5 × (19 +12). That's exactly what I thought. 5 ×31 =155. That's the total pens.

Option E is (5 ×19)+12. That's 95 +12=107. That's less than 155. So E is wrong.

Option F is 12 × (5 +19). That's 12 ×24=288. Again, way higher than 155. So F is wrong.

Option G is (5 ×19) -12. 95-12=83. Nope, too low.

Option H is (5 -19) ×12. That's negative, so no.

Option I is 5 + (19×12). 19×12 is 228, plus 5 is 233. That's too high.

Option J is (5 +19)+12. That's 24 +12=36. Definitely too low.

So the only correct one is D.

The correct expression is D: 5 × (19 + 12).

Answer: D
