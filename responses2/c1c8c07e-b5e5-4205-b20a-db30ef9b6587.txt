Question:

A 67-year-old man with Parkinson disease is admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia. The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?

Options:

A: Begin corticosteroid treatment
B: Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube
C: Administer influenza vaccine
D: Prescribe fludrocortisone
E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa
F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy
G: Initiate physical therapy
H: Obtain CT scan of the chest
I: Obtain a swallowing evaluation
J: Start patient on anticoagulant therapy

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient with Parkinson's disease being treated for pneumonia. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The patient is 67 years old, and his daughter is visiting. He's been feeling lethargic for the past day and has decreased ambulation in the past six months. During the day, his tremors get worse, but he's still at home. He has hypertension, and the doctors are using several medications: hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. The patient is 168 cm, 78 kg, BMI 28 kg/m², with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg at rest and 80/50 during activity.

His vitals are 38.9°C, 60 bpm at rest, 68 bpm standing, 22 respirations/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 at rest and 80/50 standing. He's older than his age, so maybe he's in his 60s or 70s. He's fully oriented but lethargic. The chest exam shows rhonchi in the right mid lung. Abdomen is normal. Neurologically, he has masked facial features, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity. Gait wasn't assessed yet.

X-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no issues. The appropriate IV antibiotic is started. Before discharge, what's the next step?

Looking at the options, the patient's condition includes hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for several conditions. He's on medications like hydrochlorothiazide, which is for hypokalemia, and others like carbidopa, which I think is a medication for sedation. Parkinson's is a condition that can lead to hypotension, especially if there's difficulty moving, as he has bradykinesia, which might cause hypokalemia. His age is 67, which is within the age range for Parkinson's, so that's a possible cause.

He's at rest hypotensive, which is a red flag. His blood pressure is 100/60, which is within normal range, but at rest it's elevated. So the patient's hypotension might be due to the medications, but perhaps there's another underlying cause. His elevated heart rate and blood pressure might indicate something else, but the main issue is the hypotension.

The previous treatment was IV antibiotics. But before discontinue a drug, the doctor might need to check for other issues. The question is about the appropriate step before discharge.

Looking at the options:

A: corticosteroid treatment - Not sure about this. If he has hypertension, which is a higher category, corticosteroid might be used for that. But is that the next step before discontinuing others?

B: PEG tube - This is for gastrointestinal issues. His chest X-ray shows an infiltrate, which points to lung tissue changes, but is that related to the gastrointestinal system? Maybe not. Unless the infection is in the stomach, but the chest shows right lower lobe, which is the lower right lung, not the stomach. Also, the patient is a 67-year-old, so he's not likely to have stomach infections, which are more common in kids. But without more info, maybe not.

C: Influenza vaccine - Probably not, unless it's a severe case, but the patient doesn't have a history of severe illness, so that's unlikely.

D: Prescribe fludrocortisone - Fludrocortisone is for hypokalemia. His hypokalemia might be a problem, but the IV was done, but if he's on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a potassium inhibitor, maybe the potassium is fine. So maybe this isn't the next step.

E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa - Wait, he's on carbidopa, which is a sedative. If he's having bradykinesia and is at rest hypotensive, and if he's on a medication that lowers potassium, then maybe the hypotension is due to the drug. If the hypotension persists, he'd need to discontinue. Alternatively, if there's another underlying cause, maybe he needs to start another medication. But the question is about appropriate step before discharge.

F: Home oxygen therapy - Oxygen is important for patients with respiratory issues. If he's had tremors and ambulation issues, oxygen might be needed. So maybe starting home oxygen is a step.

G: Obtain CT scan - His chest X-ray showed an infiltrate, which is a sign of lung disease. Maybe a CT scan would confirm if there's lung cancer or other lung issues. However, prior to discharge, the doctor might want to check this. So perhaps this is a step after the initial plan.

H: Obtain CT scan of chest - That would confirm the right lower lobe infiltrate. But the question is about what's the most appropriate step before discharge. So if he's already given the antibiotics, and now the doctor wants to check for other issues, then obtaining a CT scan would be the next step. However, the question is about the most appropriate step before discharge, so maybe he's already considered all options?

I: Obtain swallowing evaluation - Swallowing evaluation is for things like counterfeit speech or swallowing reflexes. Not directly related to his current condition.

J: Anticoagulant therapy - For heart attacks, or stroke. If the patient is at rest hypotensive and has high blood pressure, but the ECG shows no issues. So, no need for anticoag.

Wait, the patient is on several drugs, including hydrochlorothiazide, which is for hypokalemia. Maybe the hypotension is due to the medications. If the patient's hypotension is due to the medications, then the current IV is probably the correct one. But if his hypotension is due to something else, like a liver issue or something else, then we'd need to start another medication.

But the question is about what's the most appropriate step before discharge. If the patient is on IV antibiotics and the next step is to check for other issues before discontinuing those, then obtaining a CT scan (H) might be next. Alternatively, if the patient's hypotension is due to the medications, then we might not need to start another drug yet.

But the patient's initial assessment on discharge would include the right lower lobe infiltrate, which is an imaging finding. So, perhaps before he's started any new IV, he should have been evaluated for lung issues.

Alternatively, maybe the patient's condition is due to the medications, so the current IV is the correct one and he doesn't need to start more.

Wait, but the patient's current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, which is for hypokalemia. His blood pressure at rest is elevated. So, perhaps the hypotension is due to the medications. So the current IV is probably the correct dose, and he doesn't need to start another drug yet.

So the next step before discharge would be to check for other issues, which includes a CT scan. So option H.

Wait, but the options are about what's the most appropriate step before discharge.

Wait, the options are: the question is, what should be done before discharge. So the initial plan was to initiate IV antibiotics. But perhaps the patient's hypotension is due to the medications, so the antibiotics are the correct dose, and the next step is to check for other issues before discontinuing. So obtaining a CT scan would be the next step.

Alternatively, if the patient's hypotension is normal, then he can continue the antibiotics. Hmm, but the patient is at rest hypotensive, which is a red flag for hypokalemia, and his blood pressure is elevated, which is unusual for a patient on hydrochlorothiazide. But if the hypotension is due to the medications, then the IV is correct. Otherwise, if it's due to something else, like a liver condition, then more treatment is needed.

So the correct approach is to rule out other causes before switching medications. Therefore, the next step is to perform a CT scan to confirm lung issues.

So the options are:

Option H: Obtain CT scan of the chest.

Option E: Discontinue the medications.

So, the next step after initiating IV antibiotics is to check for other causes, so H.

But wait, the question is about the most appropriate step before discharge. So perhaps before starting any new IV, he should check for other issues.

So the correct answer is H: Obtain a CT scan of the chest.

The patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, hypokalemia, and elevated blood pressure (100/60 vs. 80/50 mmHg). He has been prescribed medications such as hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa, and has been on IV antibiotics. The chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate, and the patient is fully oriented but has lethargy and tremors. The goal is to determine the most appropriate step before discharge.

- **Option A: Begin corticosteroid treatment** - Corticosteroids are typically used for hypotension, but the patient's hypotension is likely due to the medications (hydrochlorothiazide), not corticosteroids. This is an unlikely next step.
- **Option B: Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube** - This is for gastrointestinal issues, not related to the patient's current condition. The patient's chest x-ray suggests a lung issue, not the need for a gastrointestinal tube.
- **Option C: Administer influenza vaccine** - This is unrelated to the patient's current symptoms, as there is no evidence of a severe respiratory infection.
- **Option D: Prescribe fludrocortisone** - Fludrocortisone is for hypokalemia, but the patient's hypotension is likely due to hydrochlorothiazide, not fludrocortisone.
- **Option E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa** - The patient's hypotension is likely due to hydrochlorothiazide, not the medications. If the hypotension persists, discontinuing the medications would be appropriate. However, this would be the next step if the current IV was the correct dose.
- **Option F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy** - Oxygen is important for patients with respiratory issues, but the patient's chest x-ray suggests a lung infection, not oxygen therapy.
- **Option G: Initiate physical therapy** - Physical therapy is not indicated for this patient, as the condition is likely due to medications and lung disease.
- **Option H: Obtain a CT scan of the chest** - This is the next step before discharge to confirm the right lower lobe infiltrate, which points to lung abnormalities. This is the most appropriate step to ensure the patient's condition is treated appropriately.
- **Option I: Obtain swallowing evaluation** - This is unrelated to the patient's condition.
- **Option J: Start patient on anticoagulant therapy** - No evidence of a heart attack or stroke is present, so this is not necessary.

The patient's condition is best addressed by confirming the right lower lobe infiltrate with a CT scan, ruling out other potential causes. Therefore, the most appropriate step is **Option H**.

**Answer: H**
