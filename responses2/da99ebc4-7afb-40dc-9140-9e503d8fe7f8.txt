Question:

Explain the term "psychosis" and the distinction between functionaland organic psychoses.

Options:

A: Psychosis is characterized by persistent happiness and clarity of thought
B: Psychosis is a minor mental disorder
C: Organic psychosis results from voluntary substance abuse, whereas functional psychosis is always congenital
D: Organic psychosis is typically induced by changes in the weather or climate
E: Organic psychosis is caused by psychological trauma
F: A psychosis is a severe mental disorder causing impaired thinking and emotion. Organic psychosis is caused by impaired brain functioning due to structural lesions or disease, while functional psychosis does not have any apparent pathological changes in the brain.
G: Functional psychosis is a form of psychosis that only occurs in older adults
H: Functional psychosis is caused by physical brain damage
I: Psychosis is a mild condition that improves without treatment
J: Functional psychosis is caused by infectious diseases, while organic psychosis is a result of genetic factors

Okay, so I've got this question about the term "psychosis" and the distinction between functional and organic psychoses. Hmm, I remember that psychoses are a group of mental disorders, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to piece this together.

First, the question is asking me to explain what "psychosis" is and then differentiate between the two types: functional and organic. The options are labeled A through J, each giving a different explanation.

I think that functional psychosis is something that happens due to underlying factors or genetic issues. Like, maybe a person has a brain defect or was exposed to something that makes their mind behave in a certain way. So, it's more like a biological conditionâ€”something inherent, not caused by external factors. The person doesn't necessarily have to undergo any treatment because the problem is there from the start.

On the other hand, organic psychosis comes from something external. I remember hearing that this can be caused by things like substance abuse. So, it's a result of taking something like alcohol or drugs, which affects the brain. For example, someone might get functional psychosis because of a brain damage, or organic because they drank a lot.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. I think organic psychosis is also called violent psychosis. I've heard stories of people being violent because they were exposed to substances in a toxic environment. That fits with the idea that it's caused externally.

So, looking at the options:

Option C says organic is from voluntary substance abuse, and functional is congenital. That sounds right based on what I recall.

Option F says that functional psychosis is severe, causing impaired thinking and emotion. That makes sense because if your brain is damaged, you can't think clearly. Organic would have more immediate effects, like physical symptoms, but the key is that functional is due to genetics or brain damage.

Wait, any other points? I'm trying to remember if any of these are incorrect. Let me go through the options again.

Option A says it's characterized by happiness and clarity. That's a bit vague and might not be the best description. It's more about the symptoms rather than the cause.

Option B says it's a minor disorder. I think functional is a more serious condition, so maybe not B.

Option D says organic is caused by weather changes. That doesn't sound right. I don't think that's the case. It's more about brain damage.

Option E says organic is caused by psychological trauma. That's plausible, but it's more about trauma than substance abuse.

Option F correctly describes both types: both have severe symptoms, but F also says functional is genetic, whereas organic is structural damage. That's exactly what I remember.

Option G says functional is old adults. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe it's more about the manifestation in different age groups, but the main distinction is about the cause.

Option H says functional is caused by physical damage. That's correct, but it's a broader term, while organic is more specific to external causes like substance use.

Option I says psychosis is mild and improves without treatment. That's not correct. I think psychoses are usually severe and require treatment, especially organic ones.

Option J says functional is infectious diseases. That's not right; it's more about genetic issues.

So, putting it all together, option F is the best answer. It accurately describes both types, the causes, and the symptoms without being incorrect. So, the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F. This option accurately explains that functional psychosis is caused by underlying genetic factors, leading to severe symptoms like impaired thinking and emotion, while organic psychosis results from external causes such as changes in the environment or exposure to substances, such as alcohol or drug use.
