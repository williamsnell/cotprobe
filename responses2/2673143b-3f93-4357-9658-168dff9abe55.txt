Okay, so I've got this gas problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the new volume when the temperature and pressure change. Hmm, I remember something about the combined gas law. Wait, the gas law is PV = nRT. Oh right, and for this problem, since the amount of gas (n) isn't changing, I can probably use the relationship between the initial and final states without worrying about moles.

Wait, the question is about changing conditions—specifically from 500 liters at 27 degrees Celsius and 700 torr to STP. Oh wait, STP is standard temperature and pressure, right? STP is 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm. But wait, the initial temperature is given as 27°C, which is 300.15 K. Oh, I might need to convert that. So the initial state is 500 L at 300 K and 700 torr, and the final state is at 273 K and 1 atm. But I need to convert the pressure from torr to atm because the units have to match.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me jot down the given values:

Initial volume (V1) = 500 L
Initial temperature (T1) = 27°C = 300 K
Initial pressure (P1) = 700 torr
Final pressure (P2) = 1 atm (since STP is 1 atm)
Final temperature (T2) = 0°C = 273 K

Wait, but I need to make sure all units are consistent. So I'll convert P1 from torr to atm. I know that 1 atm is 760 torr, so 700 torr is 700/760 atm. Let me calculate that. 700 divided by 760. Hmm, 700 ÷ 760 is approximately 0.92105 atm.

So now, the initial state is V1 = 500 L, P1 = ~0.92105 atm, T1 = 300 K. The final state is V2 = ?, P2 = 1 atm, T2 = 273 K.

Since the gas is ideal, I can use the combined gas law or the combined gas law equation. The combined gas law is (P1 V1) / T1 = (P2 V2) / T2. Because n is constant. So I can rearrange it to solve for V2.

So, V2 = (P1 V1 T2) / (T1 P2)

Plugging in the numbers:

V2 = ( (0.92105 atm) * 500 L * 273 K ) / (300 K * 1 atm )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.92105 * 500 * 273.

Let me compute 0.92105 * 500 first. 0.92105 * 500 = 460.525.

Then multiply by 273. So 460.525 * 273. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, 460 * 273 = 460*(200 +70 +3) = 460*200=92000, 460*70=32200, 460*3=1380 → total 92000+32200=124200 +1380=125580. Then 0.525 * 273. 0.5 is 136.5, 0.025 is 6.825. So 136.5 +6.825 = 143.325. So adding to 125580: 125580 +143.325 = 125723.325.

Denominator: 300 * 1 = 300.

So V2 = 125723.325 / 300 ≈ 419.0778 liters.

Wait, so approximately 419 liters. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option E is 419 liters. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but did I make any mistakes in calculations? Let me double-check. Perhaps I should compute the numbers more accurately.

Alternative approach: Let me compute the initial conversion again.

700 torr is 700 /760 = 0.92105 atm. Correct.

So (P1 * V1) is 0.92105 *500 = 460.525. Then, (T2 / T1) is 273/300 = 0.91.

Wait, so V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (T1 * P2) → (0.92105 *500 *273) / (300 * 1).

Alternatively, I could compute it as (P1/P2) * (V1) * (T2/T1).

So (0.92105 / 1) * (500 L) * (273/300).

Compute 273/300 = 0.91.

So 0.92105 * 500 = 460.525.

460.525 * 0.91 = let's compute that.

460 * 0.91 is (400 *0.91)+(60 *0.91)=364 +54.6=418.6.

Then 0.525 *0.91. 0.5*0.91=0.455, 0.025*0.91=0.02275. Sum: 0.47775.

So total is 418.6 + 0.47775=419.07775 liters.

So approximately 419 liters.

Looking again at the options, option E is 419 liters. So the answer is E.

To determine the volume of 500 liters of gas at 27°C and 700 torr when it occupies STP, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Given Data:
- Initial volume, \( V_1 = 500 \, \text{L} \)
- Initial temperature, \( T_1 = 27^\circ \text{C} = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- Initial pressure, \( P_1 = 700 \, \text{torr} \)
- Final pressure, \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \) (STP)
- Final temperature, \( T_2 = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273 \, \text{K} \)

### Unit Conversion:
Convert \( P_1 \) from torr to atm:
\[
P_1 = \frac{700}{760} \approx 0.92105 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Rearranging the Combined Gas Law:
\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{T_1 P_2}
\]

### Substituting the Values:
\[
V_2 = \frac{(0.92105 \, \text{atm}) \cdot (500 \, \text{L}) \cdot (273 \, \text{K})}{(300 \, \text{K}) \cdot (1 \, \text{atm})}
\]

### Calculations:
1. Numerator: \( 0.92105 \cdot 500 = 460.525 \), then \( 460.525 \cdot 273 = 125,723.325 \)
2. Denominator: \( 300 \cdot 1 = 300 \)
3. \( V_2 = \frac{125,723.325}{300} \approx 419.0778 \, \text{L} \)

### Final Answer:
The volume at STP is approximately **419 liters**. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is **E: 419 liters**.
