Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the reaction between NaCN and dilute H2SO4. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the problem says that 196 grams of NaCN is used, and H2SO4 is added in excess. I need to find the volume of HCN gas formed at STP.

Wait, what's the reaction between NaCN and H2SO4? I remember that NaCN is a strong base, and H2SO4 is a strong acid. They probably react in a neutralization reaction. But wait, isn't that more typical when an acid reacts with a base to form a salt and water? So maybe the reaction is between H2SO4 and NaCN to produce Na2SO4 and HCN.

Yes, right. The balanced chemical equation would be: H2SO4 + 2NaCN → Na2SO4 + HCN. Let me double-check the stoichiometry. H2SO4 has two H+ ions; each NaCN provides one CN⁻. So two CN⁻ are needed to neutralize two H+ ions. So the equation is correct.

Next, I need to find out how much HCN is produced. To do that, I'll find the moles of NaCN first, then use the mole ratio to find moles of HCN, and then convert that to volume at STP.

The molar mass of NaCN. Sodium is about 23, carbon 12, nitrogen 14. So total is 23 +12 +14 = 50 g/mol?

Wait wait, NaCN's formula is Na+ CN^-. So the molar mass is 23 (Na) + 14 (C) + 1 (H is in HCN, but wait, NaCN is Na+ [CN⁻], so yes, 23+14=37 plus Na is 1? No, wait. Wait, no, NaCN is Na + CN. So Na is 23, C is 12, N is 14. So 23+12+14=50. Oh wait, no, wait, Na is 23, CN is 12 +14=26. So total 23+26=49 g/mol. Wait, that makes more sense. I think I should double-check. Na is 23 u, Cl is 35.5, so CN is 14 (C) +1 (H) =15? No, wait, CN is C (12) and N (14), so 26. So NaCN is 23 (Na) +26 (CN) =49 g/mol.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm making a mistake. NaCN's molar mass is Na (23) + C (12) + N (14) =23+12+14=49 g/mol.

So 196 grams of NaCN is (196 g) / (49 g/mol) = 4 mol. Wait, 49 *4=196. So yes.

The balanced equation is H2SO4 + 2 NaCN → Na2SO4 + HCN.

So for every 2 moles of NaCN, 1 mole of HCN is produced. So if I have 4 moles of NaCN, moles of HCN would be (4 mol) * (1 mol HCN /2 mol NaCN) )= 2 moles HCN.

Now, at STP, 1 mole is 22.4 liters. So 2 moles would be 44.8 liters.

Looking at the options, option J is 44.8 liters.

The reaction between NaCN and dilute H₂SO₄ is a neutralization reaction:

\[
\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2\text{NaCN} \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{SO}_4 + \text{HCN}
\]

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaCN produce 1 mole of HCN. 

First, calculate the moles of NaCN:

- The molar mass of NaCN is \( 23 \, (\text{Na}) + 12 \, (\text{C}) + 14 \, (\text{N}) = 49 \, \text{g/mol} \).
- Moles of NaCN = \( \frac{196 \, \text{g}}{49 \, \text{g/mol}} = 4 \, \text{mol} \).

Using the stoichiometric ratio from the balanced equation, 2 moles of NaCN produce 1 mole of HCN. Therefore, 4 moles of NaCN produce:

\[
\frac{4 \, \text{mol NaCN}}{2 \, \text{mol NaCN per mol HCN}} = 2 \, \text{mol HCN}.
\]

At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. Thus, 2 moles of HCN occupy:

\[
2 \, \text{mol} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 44.8 \, \text{L}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **J: 44.8 liters**.
