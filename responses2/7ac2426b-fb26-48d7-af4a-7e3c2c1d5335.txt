Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay measurements. Hmm, let me think. The question is about determining how long the student should count to establish the rate with an uncertainty of 1 percent.

First, I remember that radioactive decay follows a Poisson distribution. The half-life formula is involved here, but wait, the question isn't directly asking about half-life. Oh, it's about the time measurement uncertainty. 

The student made 10 measurements, each taking one second. The data points are 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. Wait, wait, all these are counts, so maybe we're looking at the average decay rate?

Oh right, the number of decays over time follows a Poisson process. The standard error of the mean is important here. The formula for the standard error (SE) of the mean is sqrt(λ / N), where λ is the average count per second. Wait, no, wait. The number of counts per second is the decay rate λ. But wait, in this case, the student's measurements are of the decay counts over different time intervals. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the uncertainty in the measurement.

Wait, the data provided is the number of decays over 10 one-second measurements. So the average number of decays per second would be the mean of these 10. Let's calculate that.

The data points are: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5.

Adding them up: 3+0=3, +2=5, +1=6, +2=8, +4=12, +0=12, +1=13, +2=15, +5=20. So total of 20 decays over 10 seconds. That's an average of 2 decays per second. So λ is 2.

Now, the uncertainty in the measurement. The formula for the standard deviation (σ) of a Poisson distribution is sqrt(λ). So here, σ would be sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414.

But wait, this is the standard deviation for the entire count. The question is about the uncertainty in the measurement of the rate. Since the measurements are over 10 one-second intervals, perhaps we should calculate the standard error of the mean.

The standard error (SE) is σ divided by the square root of N, where N is the number of measurements. So SE = sqrt(λ) / sqrt(N). Here, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, divided by sqrt(10) which is about 3.162. So 1.414 / 3.162 ≈ 0.447.

Wait, but the problem says "the uncertainty of 1 percent". So we need to find the time T such that the standard error is about 1% of the measured count per second.

Wait, let me think again. The student is measuring the decay rate. The number of decays in a time T is λ*T. The uncertainty in the count for that time would be sqrt(λ*T).

We want this uncertainty to be 1% of λ*T. So:

sqrt(λ*T) = 0.01 * λ*T

Divide both sides by λ*T (assuming it's non-zero):

1/sqrt(T) = 0.01

Solving for T:

sqrt(T) = 100
T = 100^2 = 10,000 seconds.

Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait no, because I think I might have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the uncertainty in the count is sqrt(λ*T). We want this to be 1% of the expected count λ*T. So:

sqrt(λ*T) = 0.01 * λ*T

Square both sides:

λ*T = (0.01)^2 * λ^2 * T^2

Wait, that doesn't make sense because λ*T is on both sides. Let me re-derive.

We have:

sqrt(λ T) = 0.01 λ T

Square both sides:

λ T = (0.01)^2 (λ T)^2

=> 1 = (0.01)^2 (λ T)

Wait, that can't be right because (λ T) is on both sides. So perhaps the correct way is to divide both sides by λ T.

Wait, no, perhaps better to write it as:

sqrt(λ T) = 0.01 λ T

Divide both sides by sqrt(λ T):

1 = 0.01 λ T / sqrt(λ T) )

Simplify the right side:

0.01 * sqrt(λ T) = 1

So:

sqrt(λ T) = 1 / 0.01 = 100

Then, square:

λ T = 10000

But λ is the average decay per second, which we found earlier to be 2.

So λ T = 2 * T = 10,000

So T = 10,000 / 2 = 5000 seconds.

Wait, that's 5,000 seconds, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 10,000. So I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.

Let me re-express the problem. The uncertainty in the measurement is 1%, so the standard error (SE) should be 1% of the measured count per second.

The count per second is λ. So SE = sqrt(λ) / sqrt(N). Wait, but wait, in the problem, each measurement is a one-second count. So the measured counts are 10 data points with an average of 2 per second.

So the standard error of the count (the uncertainty in the count) is sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414.

We want the uncertainty (1.414) to be 1% of the count. So 1.414 = 0.01 * count.

Wait, wait, no. The count is λ*T, which is 2*T. But the count itself is the number of decays, which is a random variable with a mean λ T and standard deviation sqrt(λ T).

The question says the uncertainty is 1% of the rate. So the standard deviation should be 1% of the expected count.

Wait, let me clarify. The student wants the uncertainty in the measurement to be 1% of the measured rate. The measured rate is 2 decays per second on average.

So 1% of that is 0.02 decays per second.

But the standard deviation of the count (number of decays) is sqrt(λ T). So sqrt(2 T) = 0.02.

Wait, but that can't be right because sqrt(2 T) is about 1.414 * sqrt(T). Setting that equal to 0.02? That would require T to be super small, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go back. The problem states that they should establish the rate with an uncertainty of 1 percent. So perhaps the standard error of the count per second should be 1% of the expected count.

Wait, the expected count per second is λ. So 1% of λ is 0.01 λ.

The standard error of the count per second is sqrt(λ / N), where N is the number of measurements, which is 10.

So SE = sqrt(λ / N) = sqrt(2 /10) = sqrt(0.2) ≈ 0.447, but this is the standard error for a single measurement (e.g., for each second's count). But the problem isn't about that; it's about the overall uncertainty in the measurement.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the total time T such that the standard error for the total count (λ T) is 1% of the expected count (λ T) .

So sqrt(λ T) = 0.01 * λ T.

Divide both sides by sqrt(λ T):

1 = 0.01 * sqrt(λ T)

Wait, this can't be right; perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, the uncertainty in the measured rate (per unit time) should be 1%. So the uncertainty in the count per second is 1% of λ.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to consider the uncertainty in the total count. The uncertainty in the total count (λ T) is sqrt(λ T). We want this uncertainty to be 1% of the expected count λ T.

So:

sqrt(λ T) = 0.01 * λ T

Divide both sides by λ T (assuming it's not zero):

1 / sqrt(T) = 0.01

So sqrt(T) = 100 => T = 10000 seconds.

Wait, but that would be option A: 10,000 s.

But earlier I thought it was 5,000 s. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. The uncertainty in the measurement of a count C (number of decays) is σ = sqrt(C). So for the total counts over T seconds, the standard deviation is sqrt(λ T).

We want the standard deviation to be 1% of the mean. So:

sqrt(λ T) = 0.01 * λ T

Divide both sides by λ T:

1 / sqrt(T) = 0.01

So sqrt(T)=100 => T=100^2 = 10,000 s.

Wait, but that's option A. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the counting rate as the rate (decays per second), not the count itself. So the uncertainty in the rate would be 1%.

In that case, the uncertainty in the count (C) is σ = sqrt(C). The rate is λ, so the uncertainty in the rate is σ/λ = (sqrt(C))/λ.

Wait, let's model this. 

The count C has mean λ T and standard deviation sqrt(λ T).

The rate is λ = C / T.

The uncertainty in the rate would be the standard error of C divided by T. Because the standard deviation of C is sqrt(λ T), so the standard deviation of C/T would be sqrt(λ T)/T = sqrt(λ)/sqrt(T).

So the uncertainty in the rate is sqrt(λ)/sqrt(T).

We want this uncertainty to be 1% of the expected rate, which is 0.01 * λ.

So:

sqrt(λ) / sqrt(T) = 0.01 λ

Divide both sides by λ (assuming λ !=0):

1/sqrt(T) = 0.01

So sqrt(T) = 100 → T = 10,000 s.

Again, that leads to 10,000 seconds, option A.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the correct answer was 5,000 s. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think of another approach. The formula for uncertainty in the decay constant λ is σ_λ = σ_λ / λ = [σ_C / T] = sqrt(λ T)/T = sqrt(λ)/sqrt(T).

So σ_λ = sqrt(λ)/sqrt(T) → we want σ_λ = 0.01 λ → sqrt(λ)/sqrt(T) = 0.01 λ.

Divide both sides by λ → 1/sqrt(T) = 0.01 → T= (1/0.01)^2 = 10^4 s = 10,000 s. Same result.

Hmm, but the options don't have 10,000 s as a separate option. Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 10,000. So that would be correct.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the uncertainty in the measurement of the average rate, which is λ. The average rate is λ, with standard error in λ being σ_λ = sqrt(λ/(N)).

But wait, that's for the Poisson distribution. The uncertainty in the average rate λ is sqrt(λ/N). So if we want the uncertainty in λ to be 1%, then sqrt(λ/N) = 0.01 λ.

Divide both sides by lambda (assuming lambda !=0):

1/sqrt(N) = 0.01 → sqrt(N)=100 → N=10,000 measurements.

But wait, in the problem, N is 10 measurements. So that approach would give T=10,000 s, again.

Wait, but the problem says the student makes 10 one-second measurements. So in this model, N=10.

So sqrt(10) ≈3.16. So 1/sqrt(10) = 0.316. So 0.316 = 0.01 → which is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the uncertainty in the mean of counts.

Wait, the problem says "10 one-second measurements", so N=10.

So the standard error (SE) of the mean count per second is sqrt(λ / N) = sqrt(2 /10) ≈ 0.447.

Wait, but the problem isn't about this; the uncertainty they want is about the rate (λ), not the count.

Alternatively, the standard error of the mean for the rate is SE_rate = SE_count / T.

Because SE_count is 0.447 for a single measurement. So for T seconds, the count would be C = λ T. So the uncertainty in C is sqrt(λ T). So the uncertainty in rate (C/T) would be:

Δr = ΔC / T = sqrt(λ T) / T = sqrt(λ) / sqrt(T).

Set Δr = 0.01 λ.

So sqrt(λ) / sqrt(T) = 0.01 λ → 1/sqrt(T) = 0.01 → T=10,000 s. Again, same result.

So the answer is 10,000 s, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 4,500 s, which is 4.5e3. But according to my calculations, it's 10,000 s. But perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the standard error of the mean (λ) itself, not the count. The standard error of the mean for a Poisson distribution is sqrt(λ / N). So sqrt(2 /10) is ≈0.447.

But that's the standard error of the count for a single measurement. The rate is λ, and the uncertainty in the rate would be σ_rate = σ_count / T.

So σ_rate = 0.447 / T.

We want σ_rate = 0.01 * λ → 0.01 * 2 = 0.02.

So 0.447 / T = 0.02 → T=0.447 / 0.02 = 22.35 s.

But that can't be right because 22 seconds is way less than the options.

Wait, but that approach would be incorrect because the rate is a derived quantity, and the uncertainty in the rate should consider the uncertainty in the count and the time measurement. Because the uncertainty in the count is the standard error, but also, the count is a per second measurement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this using the uncertainty propagation formula.

The rate r is λ, which is C / T, where C is the number of decays in T seconds.

The uncertainty in r is σ_r = sqrt( (σ_C)^2 / T^2 + (C^2)/(T^4 σ_C^2) )).

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the relative uncertainty in the rate is sqrt( (σ_C / C )^2 + (1/(2 T)) ) )^2.

Alternatively, since C is the number of decays (count), and the rate is λ = C / T.

The uncertainty in λ is sqrt( (σ_C / C )^2 + (1/(2 T))^2 ) ).

Wait, let's compute that.

σ_C is sqrt(λ T) = sqrt(2 T).

So σ_C / C = sqrt(2 T) / (2 T) ) = sqrt(2/(4 T)) ) = sqrt(1/(2 T)).

Wait, no, wait. C = λ T = 2 T.

σ_C = sqrt(λ T) = sqrt(2 T).

So σ_C / C = sqrt(2 T) / (2 T) )= sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(T)) )= 1/(sqrt(2 T)).

So (σ_C / C )^2 = 1/(2 T).

The second term in the uncertainty is (1/(2 T))^2 = 1/(4 T^2).

So the relative uncertainty in lambda is sqrt( (1/(2 T)) + (1/(4 T^2)) )).

We want this relative uncertainty to be 0.01.

So:

sqrt( (1/(2 T)) + (1/(4 T^2)) ) = 0.01.

Square both sides:

(1/(2 T)) + (1/(4 T^2)) ) = 0.0001.

Multiply both sides by 4 T^2:

2 T + 1 = 0.0004 T^2.

Rearranging:

0.0004 T^2 - 2 T -1 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in T. Let's write a=0.0004, b=-2, c=-1.

The formula is T = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 4 *0.0004 *1)]/(2 *0.0004).

Compute discriminant:

4 + 4 *0.0004 *1 =4 + 0.0016=4.0016.

sqrt(4.0016)= approximately 2.0004.

So the solution is:

[2 ± 2.0004]/ (0.0008).

We take the positive root because T must be positive.

So (2 + 2.0004) / 0.0008 = 4.0004 /0.0008 = 5000.5 seconds.

So approximately 5000 seconds. So option C.

Ah, that's different from earlier. So the correct answer is 5000 seconds. So option C.

But wait, why is this the case? Because the relative uncertainty is not just the relative uncertainty in the count divided by the time, but also includes the relative time uncertainty. Because time is being measured with some uncertainty.

Wait, but in this problem, the time is measured with a 1-second resolution. So the uncertainty in T is 1 second. So the time has an uncertainty of 1, and the count has an uncertainty of 1/(sqrt(2 T)).

Wait, no, the count's standard error is sqrt(2 T), so the relative error in count is sqrt(2 T) / (2 T) = 1/(sqrt(2 T)).

The time's uncertainty is 1, so the relative uncertainty in time is 1/sqrt(T).

But wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the total uncertainty in the rate as the square root of the sum of the squares of the relative uncertainties in count and time.

So:

Δr/r = sqrt( (ΔC/C)^2 + (ΔT/T)^2 )

We want Δr/r =0.01.

So:

sqrt( (1/(sqrt(2 T)))^2 + (1/T)^2 ) =0.01

Simplify:

sqrt( 1/(2 T) + 1/(T^2) ) )=0.01

Square both sides:

1/(2 T) +1/(T^2) )=0.0001.

Multiply both sides by 2 T^2:

T + 2 =0.0002 T^2.

Rearranged:

0.0002 T^2 - T -2 =0.

That's a quadratic in T: a=0.0002, b=-1, c=-2.

Solutions: T=[1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 *0.0002 *2 ) ]/(2 *0.0002).

Compute discriminant:

1 +4 *0.0002 *2= 1 + 0.0016=1.0016.

sqrt(1.0016)= approx 1.0008.

So T=(1 +1.0008)/0.0004 → (2.0008)/0.0004 → 5002 seconds.

Which is about 5,000 s. So again, option C.

So the correct approach is the one where the uncertainty in the rate is the square root of the sum of the squares of the uncertainties in count and time.

So the correct answer is option C: 5,000 seconds.
</think>

To determine the time \( T \) required to establish a decay rate with an uncertainty of 1%, we analyze the problem using the principles of error propagation. The decay rate \( \lambda \) is calculated as \( \lambda = \frac{C}{T} \), where \( C \) is the number of decays and \( T \) is the time in seconds. The uncertainty in the decay rate \( \Delta \lambda \) is given by:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta C}{C}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\Delta T}{T}\right)^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Define the uncertainties
- The number of decays \( C \) follows a Poisson distribution, so the standard error of \( C \) is \( \sigma_C = \sqrt{\lambda T} \).
- The uncertainty in \( C \) relative to \( C \) is \( \frac{\sigma_C}{C} = \frac{\sqrt{\lambda T}}{\lambda T} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2T}} \).
- The time \( T \) is measured with an uncertainty of \( \Delta T = 1 \, \text{s} \), so \( \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{1}{T} \).

### Step 2: Set the desired uncertainty
We want the relative uncertainty in the decay rate to be \( 0.01 \):

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = 0.01.
\]

Substituting the error propagation formula:

\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2T}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{T}\right)^2} = 0.01.
\]

### Step 3: Square both sides
\[
\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2T}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{T}\right)^2 = (0.01)^2.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{2T} + \frac{1}{T^2} = 0.0001.
\]

### Step 4: Multiply through by the denominator
Multiply both sides by \( 2T^2 \) to eliminate denominators:

\[
T + 2 = 0.0002T^2.
\]

Rearrange into standard quadratic form:

\[
0.0002T^2 - T - 2 = 0.
\]

### Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation
Using the quadratic formula:

\[
T = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \( a = 0.0002 \), \( b = -1 \), and \( c = -2 \):

\[
T = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 0.0002 \cdot 2}}{2 \cdot 0.0002}.
\]

Calculate the discriminant:

\[
\sqrt{1 + 0.0016} = \sqrt{1.0016} \approx 1.0008.
\]

Thus:

\[
T = \frac{1 + 1.0008}{0.0004} = \frac{2.0008}{0.0004} \approx 5002 \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the closest option
The closest option to \( 5002 \, \text{s} \) is **5,000 s**.
