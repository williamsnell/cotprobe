Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the rate of a zero-order reaction. Hmm. I remember that the order of a reaction refers to the concentration of reactants involved and how the rate depends on them. Let me think. 

The question is about a zero-order reaction, A → B. Zero-order means that the rate doesn't depend on the concentration of A. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, no, zero-order means that the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant. So the rate law doesn't include [A] in the equation. That would make the rate a constant, right?

Wait, but the options given include various forms. Let me look at the options again. 

Option F says r = k, which sounds like zero-order because it doesn't depend on [A]. But wait, I thought zero-order might have the rate as rate = k. Oh, right! But wait, isn't there more than one possibility for zero-order? Because, wait, I'm getting confused. 

Wait, no, zero-order reaction is when the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant. So the rate law is rate = k, which would be option F. Alternatively, some sources say that zero-order reactions can have rate = k, but I also recall that sometimes people talk about zero-order reactions having a rate of zero—no, that doesn't make sense. No, zero-order refers to the rate not depending on the concentration. So regardless of what k is, the rate is constant.

Wait, but let me think again. What about the rate equations. For a zero-order reaction, the rate is constant and the rate law is rate = k. So the correct expression is r = k, which is option F.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the terms. Wait, another thought: sometimes for zero-order reactions, the rate is expressed as r = k, but other sources might describe it differently. No, I think the correct answer is F.

Looking at the options, option F is r = k. The other options involve [A], so for a first-order reaction, the rate would be r = k [A], which is option C. So no, F is correct.

The rate of a zero-order chemical reaction A → B is expressed as a constant without dependence on the concentration of A. This makes the rate law r = k, where k is the rate constant. Among the given options, the correct expression is:

**F: r = k**

ANSWER: F
