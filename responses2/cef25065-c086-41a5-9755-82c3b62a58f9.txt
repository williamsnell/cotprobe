Okay, so I have this division problem here: 2,314 divided by 4. I need to find the quotient and the remainder, and then match it to the correct option from A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dividing, the quotient is the number of times the divisor goes into the dividend, and the remainder is what's left over after that. So for 2,314 divided by 4, I need to figure out how many times 4 goes into each part of 2,314.

Let me break this down. The number is 2,314. Dividing this by 4. Let me start with the thousands place. 4 goes into 2 zero times, but wait, 4 doesn't go into 2, so I have to take the first two digits, which is 23. Now, how many times does 4 go into 23? 4*5=20, which is less than 23, and 4*6=24, which is too big. So it goes 5 times. 5 multiplied by 4 is 20. Subtract 20 from 23, that leaves a remainder of 3. So far, I have 5, and the remainder is 3.

Bring down the next digit, which is 1, making it 31. Now, how many times does 4 go into 31? 4*7=28, which is less than 31, and 4*8=32, which is too big. So it's 7 times. 7*4 is 28. Subtracting that from 31 leaves a remainder of 3. Now, the number is 03 (since we've already done 2 and 3 earlier). Bring down the last digit, which is 4, making it 34.

How many times does 4 go into 34? Well, 4*8=32 and 4*9=36. So it's 8 times. 8*4=32. Subtract 32 from 34, and the remainder is 2. So now, I have 5, then 7, then 8, and the remainder is 2.

Putting it all together, the quotient is 578, and the remainder is 2. So the way to write this is 578 with a remainder of 2. Looking at the options, I need to find something that says 578 r2. Let me check the options again.

Option E is 578 r3. So that's not right. Option B is 578 r2, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be E, but wait no, wait! Wait a minute. Wait, 578 times 4 is 2312. Adding the remainder 2 gives 2314. So 578*4=2312, plus 2 is 2314. That's correct. So the answer is E, right? But wait, let me double-check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: 508 r1

B: 578 r2

C: 578 r1

D: 509

E: 578 r3

F: 579 r1

G: 508

H: 578

I: 507

J: 508 r2

Wait, I thought the answer was E, but I see that option B is 578 r2, which is what I calculated. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I did the long division correctly. Let's do it another way.

Divide 2314 by 4. 

Start with 2 divided by 4: 0. So take 23. 4 goes into 23 five times (5*4=20), remainder 3.

Bring down 1: 31. 4 into 31 is seven times (7*4=28), remainder 3.

Bring down 4: 34. 4 into 34 is 8 times (8*4=32), remainder 2.

So the quotient is 578, remainder 2. So option B is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is 578 r2. So that should be correct. But wait, option E is 578 r3, which would be incorrect. So I think the correct answer is B.

Wait, but wait again. What about the initial digits. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute 4 times 578 to see if it equals 2312, and then add 2 to get 2314.

578 *4: 500*4=2000, 70*4=280, 8*4=32. 2000+280=2280, +32=2312. 2312 +2=2314. Yes. So the calculation is correct. So the quotient is 578, remainder 2. So the correct answer is B: 578 r2.

But wait, the options don't have that. Wait no, looking again, option B is 578 r2. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm looking at the options again. Oh, I see now. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the options.

Options:

A: 508 r1

B: 578 r2

C: 578 r1

D: 509

E: 578 r3

F: 579 r1

G: 508

H: 578

I: 507

J: 508 r2

Wait, I think I might have misread option B. Oh, wait, no, option B is 578 with remainder 2, which is correct.

So the correct answer is B.
