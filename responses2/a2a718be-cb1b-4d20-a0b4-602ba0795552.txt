Alright, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but let's see if I can figure it out. Okay, the question is about mixing ice and water, and finding the final temperature. Hmm, right. I remember that when ice and water are mixed, the system can exchange heat to reach equilibrium.

The problem states: a 100-gram piece of ice at 0°C is added to 400 grams of water at 30°C. We're in a perfectly insulated calorimeter, which means no heat is lost to the surroundings. So the heat lost by the warmer water will be gained by the ice and the melted water.

Wait, so the ice is at 0°C, and the water is at 30°C. The ice will absorb heat to melt, which will increase the temperature of the melted water. But since the calorimeter is insulated, the heat gained by the ice and melted water will be equal to the heat lost by the original water.

Right, the steps I think are: first, the ice will absorb heat to melt. The heat from the water (initial temp 30°C) will then melt the ice and possibly raise the temperature of the melted water to 0°C and then further raise it as the system reaches equilibrium.

Wait, no, because the ice is at 0°C. So the melted water from the ice would start at 0°C. But the original water is at 30, so after the ice melts, the water could potentially rise in temperature.

Wait, but hold on. Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate how much heat the ice needs to melt. The heat required to melt ice is given by Q = m * Lf, where m is mass and Lf is the latent heat of fusion. I think the latent heat of fusion for water is about 334 J/g, or 33400 J/kg, but since we're using grams, 334 J/g.

So the ice is 100g, so Q = 100g * 334 J/g = 33400 J.

Wait, but does the ice melt completely before the water cools down? Well, the initial water is 30°C, so after the ice melts, the water would have to cool from 30°C to some final temperature T. But wait, if the final temp is 0°C, then the melted water would also be at 0°C, but then the original water would cool from 30 to 0. But wait, the ice is at 0, so if the final temp is 0, that's the point where the ice has melted.

So, the heat released by the original water as it cools from 30 to 0 is Q = m_water * c_water * ΔT.

c_water is 4.184 J/g°C. So m_water is 400g. ΔT is 30°C.

So that's 400g * 4.184 J/g°C * 30°C. Let me compute that: 400 * 4.184 *30 = 400 * 125.52 = 50208 J. Wait, that's a big number. Hmm, but the heat needed to melt the ice is 33400 J. So the heat released by the original water is 50208 J, which is more than 33400. So that means that the ice will melt completely, and the original water will cool down from 30 to 0, and some heat from the original water would go into melting the ice.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the ice melts completely, but in this scenario, the heat released by the original water is more than needed to melt the ice, so the original water would cool down, and some would remain. Wait, but the question is about the final temperature when the ice has all been melted. So in that case, the final temp would be 0°C. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. Because the ice has to absorb the heat to melt, which requires 33400 J. But the original water can give off more than that. So the ice will melt, and the water will cool from 30 to 0, but some of the original water's heat can be used to melt the ice. So the final temperature is 0, because the ice has melted, and the water cools down to 0.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine the problem. The question is, what is the final temperature of the mixture when all the ice has melted. So, that would be 0°C, because all the ice has melted and the water is at 0°C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial water is at 30, and the ice is at 0. So, the ice absorbs heat from the water. The heat from the water is Q = 400g * 4.184 J/g°C * (30-0) = 400 *4.184 *30 = 50208 J.

The heat needed to melt the ice is 33400 J. So, the remaining heat from the original water after melting is 50208 -33400 = 16808 J. Wait, but that's the heat left, so when the ice is melted, the original water would have enough heat to cool down from 30 to 0, but perhaps some of that heat isn't used up in melting the ice. Wait, no. Because the ice requires 33400 J to melt, and the original water gives 50208 J. So, 50208 J is more than 33400 J. So, the heat from the water is 50208 J.

So, first, the ice absorbs 33400 J to melt. The remaining heat is 50208 - 33400 = 16808 J. That remaining heat will cause the original water, which is now at 0°C, to cool down. But wait, the ice is already at 0, so the original water can cool down from 30 to 0.

But wait, the initial water has 30°C. After the ice has melted, the original water would cool from 30 to 0, releasing heat. The heat released by the original water is 400g *4.184 J/g°C *30°C = 50208 J.

But the heat needed to melt the ice is 33400 J. So the original water has 50208 J more than what's needed for melting. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the ice doesn't melt. But the problem states that the ice has all melted, so the final temp is 0.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the heat exchange.

The heat lost by the original water (30°C) is Q_water = m * c * (T_initial - T_final)
The heat gained by the ice (33400 J) is Q_ice = 100g * 334 J/g = 33400 J.

Wait, but wait, the ice's initial temp is 0, so if the final temp is T, then for the ice to reach T, it would need to absorb Q_ice = m_ice * Lf + m_ice * c_water * (T - 0) = 100g*(334 + 4.184*T).

On the other hand, the original water cools from 30 to T, releasing Q_water = 400g *4.184 * (30 - T).

Since the system is insulated, Q_water = Q_ice.

So:

400 * 4.184 * (30-T) = 100 * (334 + 4.184*T)

Let me compute that.

Compute left side: 400 *4.184 = 1673.6; 1673.6 * (30-T) = 1673.6*(30-T)

Right side: 100 * [334 + 4.184*T] = 33400 + 418.4 T.

So:

1673.6 (30 - T) = 33400 + 418.4 T

Let me expand the left side:

1673.6 *30 = 50208, 1673.6 * (-T) = -1673.6 T.

So:

50208 - 1673.6 T = 33400 + 418.4 T

Let's bring all terms to one side:

50208 -33400 = 1673.6 T + 418.4 T

Compute left side: 50208 -33400 = 16808.

Right side: (1673.6 + 418.4) T = 2092 T.

So 16808 = 2092 T.

T = 16808 / 2092 ≈ Let's compute.

Let me see, 2092 * 8 = 16736. That's 8 * 2092 = 16736.

16808 -16736 = 72. So 72 /2092 is approx 0.0344.

So T ≈ 8 + 0.0344 ≈ 8.034°C.

Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 8. But wait, the options do include 8 degrees. Wait, but wait the question says, the ice has all been melted. So according to this calculation, the final temp is about 8.03 degrees. So the answer should be around 8°C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the setup because earlier I thought the final temp would be 0, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the heat exchange.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it another way: the heat lost by the original water is the heat gained by the ice and the melted water.

So, the heat lost by the original water (30°C) is Q = m * c_water * (T_initial - T_final).

The heat gained by the ice is:

Q_ice = m_ice * Lf + m_ice * c_water * (T_final - 0)

Because the ice first melts (absorbs Lf), then the melted water warms up from 0 to T_final.

So,

Q_water = Q_ice.

So,

400 *4.184*(30 - T) = 100 *334 + 100 *4.184*T.

Compute the left side:

400 *4.184 is 1673.6. 1673.6*(30-T) = 1673.6*30 - 1673.6 T = 50208 -1673.6 T.

Right side: 100 *334 = 33400; 100 *4.184 T =418.4 T.

So:

50208 -1673.6 T = 33400 +418.4 T

Bring all terms to left:

50208 -33400 = 1673.6 T +1673.6 T.

Wait, no, let me move 418.4 T and 50208 to the same side.

Wait, 50208 -33400 = (1673.6 +418.4) T.

Which gives 16808 = 2092 T.

So T=16808 /2092 ≈ 8.034°C.

So the final temperature is about 8.03°C. Looking at the options, option F is 8 degrees. So the answer should be F.

To determine the final temperature when a 100-gram ice at 0°C is added to 400 grams of water at 30°C in a perfectly insulated calorimeter, we analyze the heat exchange between the ice and the water. The heat lost by the water as it cools is equal to the heat gained by the ice as it melts and, if necessary, warms up to the final temperature.

### Key Equations:
1. **Heat required to melt the ice**:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{ice}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L_f = 100 \, \text{g} \cdot 334 \, \text{J/g} = 33400 \, \text{J}
   \]
2. **Heat released by the original water as it cools**:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{initial}} - T_{\text{final}})
   \]
   where \( c_{\text{water}} = 4.184 \, \text{J/g°C} \), \( m_{\text{water}} = 400 \, \text{g} \), and \( T_{\text{initial}} = 30 \, \text{°C} \).

3. **Heat absorbed by the melted ice as it warms to the final temperature**:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{melted water}} = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 0)
   \]

### Heat Balance:
The total heat lost by the original water equals the total heat gained by the ice:
\[
Q_{\text{water}} = Q_{\text{ice}} + Q_{\text{melted water}}
\]
Substituting the expressions:
\[
400 \cdot 4.184 \cdot (30 - T_{\text{final}}) = 100 \cdot 334 + 100 \cdot 4.184 \cdot T_{\text{final}}
\]

### Simplification:
1. Compute \( 400 \cdot 4.184 = 1673.6 \, \text{J/°C} \) and \( 100 \cdot 334 = 33400 \, \text{J} \).
2. Expand and rearrange the equation:
   \[
   1673.6 \cdot (30 - T_{\text{final}}) = 33400 + 418.4 \cdot T_{\text{final}}
   \]
   \[
   50208 - 1673.6 \cdot T_{\text{final}} = 33400 + 418.4 \cdot T_{\text{final}}
   \]
   \[
   50208 - 33400 = 1673.6 \cdot T_{\text{final}} + 418.4 \cdot T_{\text{final}}
   \]
   \[
   16808 = 2092 \cdot T_{\text{final}}
   \]

### Solve for \( T_{\text{final}} \):
\[
T_{\text{final}} = \frac{16808}{2092} \approx 8.03 \, \text{°C}
\]

### Conclusion:
The final temperature of the mixture, when the ice has all been melted, is approximately **8.03°C**, which corresponds to **8°C** when rounded to the nearest whole degree.
