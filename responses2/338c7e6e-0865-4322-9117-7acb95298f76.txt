Question:

 Thomson discusses a different version of the violinist case wherein the violinist only needs to use your kidneys for one hour to survive. Her own view about this case is that

Options:

A: because the violinist's life is in danger, you have an absolute moral obligation to let them use your kidneys, regardless of the duration.
B: you have no obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys, but if you choose to do so, the violinist has the right to use them for that hour.
C: you have the right to disconnect the violinist at any point, regardless of the consequences for the violinist.
D: because you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, we should conclude that he or she has a right to use your kidneys for that hour.
E: even though you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, we should not conclude that he or she has a right to use your kidneys for that hour.
F: you have no obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour.
G: you have an obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, but the violinist does not have a right to use your kidneys.
H: the violinist has an obligation to disconnect him- or herself before that hour is over.
I: you have an obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, and the violinist also has a right to use your kidneys.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about Thomson's violinist case, but it's a different version. Hmm, the violinist only needs to use my kidneys for one hour to survive. I need to figure out the correct answer from the options provided.

Alright, let's break this down. The question is about obligations and rights regarding the use of kidneys. I remember that in legal reasoning, especially concerning medical devices, there are important distinctions between obligations and rights.

First, the violinist needs to use her kidneys for an hour to survive. So, she needs to get in the way because if she doesn't, she might die. So, she's in immediate danger. But does that mean I have an obligation to let her use them?

Wait, I think about the concept of "absolute moral obligation" versus "justifiable necessity." The idea is that if someone is in immediate danger, they have a moral obligation to act to prevent their life from being at risk. But does that apply here?

Oh right, in this case, the violinist is in immediate danger because she can't use her kidneys for an hour. So, she must act immediately to protect herself. That would mean I have an obligation to allow her to use the kidneys for that hour.

But then, there's the issue of whether she has a right to use them. Some might argue that she has a right, but legally, the right to use medical devices is separate from the obligation to prevent death. The right is about the use being necessary and appropriate, not just required to prevent harm.

Wait, but the question is about her right to use the kidneys. In many jurisdictions, the right to use medical devices is separate; the right doesn't automatically entitle someone to use them for a specified period. So, she might have a right to use them, but the moral obligation is about preventing her death.

Looking at the options, option A says I have an absolute moral obligation. That seems right because of the immediate danger. But then, does she have a right? So, the answer might have to include both parts.

Alternatively, if the violinist doesn't have a right, then the correct answer would be option H, which says she has an obligation but no right. But I'm a bit confused about when the right exists versus the obligation.

Wait, another angle: the right to use medical devices isn't absolute. For example, if the device is essential for life, the right might be owed. But in this case, the violinist only needs to use the kidneys for an hour. Suppose she needs to save her life, then she has a duty to use the kidneys for that hour. But the right to use the device might not apply because it's not necessary for her survival. 

But for the right, the right depends on whether the act is necessary and appropriate. If the violinist has a right to use the device, that would mean she's deemed necessary. But in this case, she needs to use them for one hour, which is a specific purpose, but perhaps not necessary for her survival. So, she might not have a right.

Wait, but the question is about the violinist's right. So, in this scenario, if she needs to use the device for one hour, does that make her have a right to use it for that duration? Or is it just an obligation to use it for that duration?

I think the right to use medical devices isn't automatically granted. So, the violinist's right to use the device might be limited. So, she doesn't have a right, but she has an obligation to use them for that hour to save her life.

But wait, the question is about the violinist's view. Suppose she's in immediate danger, so she has an obligation to act to prevent her death. But she might have a right to use the device because it's necessary for her survival. But that's a bit of a conflict.

Alternatively, the right to use the device is not absolute. So, the violinist might not have a right, but she does have an obligation to use it. So, in the options, which one fits?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Absolute moral obligation regardless of duration. That seems to fit because she's in immediate danger.

Option H: Violinist has an obligation but no right. Hmm, but I think the right to use medical devices isn't absolute. So, she might not have a right. So, option H would be incorrect.

Option I: Both an obligation and a right. But I don't think the right is absolute here.

Wait, but in some contexts, the right to use medical devices is absolute. For example, if the device is essential for life, then it's considered necessary. But in this case, she only needs to use it for an hour. So, perhaps she doesn't have a right because it's not necessary for her survival, but she does have an obligation to use it for the hour.

So, the violinist doesn't have a right to use them, but she has an obligation. So, looking at the options, which one says that? 

Option H says she has an obligation but no right. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, option I says both, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. The right to use medical devices is not absolute. It's based on necessity and appropriateness. If the device is necessary for her survival, then she has a right. But if she only needs it for an hour, it's not necessary for her survival, so she doesn't have a right.

So, in this scenario, she has an obligation to use the device but no right. So, the correct answer would be option H. But wait, wait. Let's see the options again.

Looking back at the options:

Option I: she has an obligation and a right.

Option H: she has an obligation but no right.

Wait, but I thought she doesn't have a right because it's not necessary for her survival.

So, if she doesn't have a right, then the correct answer would be option H. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I'm taking into account the necessity. If she can't use them for an hour, then she has a right but she must use them. So, she does have a right to use them, but the moral obligation is to use them for that hour.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the difference between obligation and right. The right is an actual possessory right, while the obligation is a legal obligation. So, if the violinist has a right, she can't use the device without permission. But if she's in immediate danger, she must use it because it's not an actual right.

But in this case, she only needs to use her kidneys for an hour. So, the right to use the device isn't necessary for her survival. So, she doesn't have a right. Therefore, the correct answer would be option H: she has an obligation but no right.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions might hold that the right to use the device is absolute, so H is incorrect. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another perspective: the right to use medical devices isn't absolute. It's based on necessity. So, if the device is necessary for her survival, then she has a right. But since she only needs it for an hour, it's not necessary for her survival, so she doesn't have a right.

So, in this case, the violinist doesn't have a right to use the device, but she has an obligation to do so. So, the correct option would be H: she has an obligation but no right.

But wait, looking at the options, option I says she has both an obligation and a right. But if she doesn't have a right, then option I is incorrect.

Wait, the question is about her view. So, she must have an obligation to use the device, but she doesn't have a right.

So, the correct answer should be H: she has an obligation but no right.

Alternatively, the question is about the right to use the device. So, in this case, the violinist's right is limited, so she doesn't have a right. Thus, the correct answer is H.

But wait, another point: in some cases, the right to use medical devices is absolute. So, if she can't use them for an hour, she's required to use them for that duration, which would make her have a right. But that's not the case here since she only needs to use them for an hour.

But I think the general rule is that the right to use medical devices is not absolute. It's based on necessity. So, in this case, she doesn't have a right.

So, the correct answer is H: she has an obligation but no right.

Wait, but looking at the options again, I think the correct answer is option I: she has an obligation and a right. But I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Alternatively, perhaps I've got it wrong. The correct answer is option I, because the right to use medical devices is absolute, so the violinist has an obligation and a right. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to remember the concepts. The right to use medical devices is not an absolute right. Medically, the right to use medical devices isn't absolute. The right is based on the necessity of the device for the person's life. So, if the device is necessary for the person's survival, the right exists. But if not, it doesn't.

In this case, the violinist needs to use her kidneys for an hour to survive. If she can't use them for an hour, then it's necessary for her survival, so she has a right. But if she can use them for that hour, then it's not necessary, so she doesn't have a right.

But the question is about her view in this specific case. So, she is in immediate danger, so she must use the device. But whether she has a right depends on whether the device is necessary for her survival.

But the question is about her right to use the device. So, if she can use it for that hour, then she doesn't have a right, because it's not necessary for her survival. If she can't, she has a right.

But the question is about her view. So, if she's in immediate danger, she must use the device. So, she has an obligation, but she doesn't have a right.

So, the correct answer is H: she has an obligation but no right.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the right to use medical devices is not absolute. So, the violinist does not have a right. She must use them because she can't survive without them. So, she has an obligation but no right.

So, the correct answer is H.
</think>

The violinist is in immediate danger of death if she cannot use her kidneys for an hour. She must act to prevent her life, which is an obligation. However, she does not have a right to use her kidneys for that duration because it is not necessary for her survival. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: H
