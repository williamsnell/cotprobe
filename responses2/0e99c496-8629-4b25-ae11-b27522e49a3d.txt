Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me see if I can figure it out. The problem has two parts: part (a) asks for the number of uranium nuclei remaining after a certain time, and part (b) is about finding the half-life. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a). The initial number of nuclei, N0, is 10^25. The time given is 10^8 years, and the decay constant lambda is 5 × 10^-18 per second. Wait, I should probably make sure the units are compatible since lambda is given in seconds. Oh, because the time is in years, I'll need to convert that into seconds.

Hmm. So time t is 10^8 years. I remember that 1 year is approximately 3.154 × 10^7 seconds, right? So t = 1e8 years * 3.154e7 s/year. Let me calculate that. 1e8 * 3e7 is 3e15, but actually 1e8 * 3.154e7 = 3.154e15 seconds. Wait, no, 1e8 is 10^8, 3.154e7 is 3.154 * 1e7. So 1e8 * 3.154e7 = 3.154e15 seconds. That's correct.

Now, the decay formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-lambda * t). So I'll plug in the numbers. But wait, lambda is given as 5e-18 per second. So lambda * t would be (5e-18) * (3.154e15) = 5 * 3.154e-3 = 15.77e-3, which is 0.01577.

So e^-0.01577. I can approximate this. The natural exponent of x is approximately 1 - x when x is small. So e^-0.01577 ≈ 1 - 0.01577 = 0.98423. But maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: 0.01577 is about 1.577e-2. The exponential of that can be found using a Taylor series or a calculator. Alternatively, since the number is small, maybe 1 - x + x²/2 - x³/6. Let's compute:

x = 0.01577
x² = approx (0.01577)^2 ≈ 0.0002486
x³ = x² * x ≈ 3.93e-6
So e^-x ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - x^3/6
So 1 - 0.01577 = 0.98423
Plus (0.0002486/2) = 0.0001243, so 0.9843543
Minus (3.93e-6)/6 ≈ 6.55e-7, which is negligible. So e^-x ≈ 0.98435.

So N(t) = 1e25 * 0.98435 ≈ 9.8435e24.

Looking at the options, let's see the options for part (a). The options are all around 8e24. Option A is 8.4e24, which is close but not exact. So perhaps I should recheck.

Wait, did I compute lambda * t correctly? Let me double-check:

lambda is 5e-18 s^-1.
t is 1e8 * 3.154e7 s = 3.154e15 s.
So lambda*t = 5e-18 * 3.154e15 = 5 * 3.154e-3 = 15.77e-3 = 0.01577.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, wait, but maybe I should compute 5e-18 * 1e8 years * 3.154e7 s/year.

Wait, 1e8 * 3.154e7 is 3.154e15 seconds. So 5e-18 * 3.154e15 = 5 *3.154e-3 = 0.01577. So yes.

So then e^-0.01577 is about 0.98435. So 1e25 *0.98435 = 9.8435e24. Looking at the options, option A is 8.4e24, which is lower. Wait, are there options where the number is about 9.8e24? Looking again, the options are:

A: 8.4e24, 5.5e9
B:8.4e24,4.7e9
C:5e24,7e9
D:9.8e24,4.5e9
E:6.5e24,4e9
F:9.5e24,6.2e9
G:7e24,5e9
H:1.2e24,3.5e9
I:9.8e24,6.5e9
J:9.2e24,3.9e9

Ah, option D is 9.8e24. So that's the answer for part (a). So the remaining nuclei are about 9.8e24.

Wait, but earlier I thought 1e25 *0.98435 is about 9.84e24. So that's option D, which is 9.84e24. So part (a)'s answer is D.

Now part (b): finding the half-life. The half-life T_1/2 can be found using the formula T_1/2 = ln(2) / lambda. Since lambda is given as 5e-18 per second.

Wait, wait, but wait. Because lambda is the decay constant, which is 5e-18 s^-1. So T_1/2 is (ln 2) / (5e-18 s^-1). Let's compute that.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.6931 divided by 5e-18.

So 0.6931 /5e-18 = (0.6931 /5) * 1e18. 0.6931/5 is about 0.13862. So 0.13862e18 s. Which is 1.3862e17 seconds.

Wait, but I need to express this in years. So converting 1.3862e17 seconds to years.

Number of seconds per year is 3.154e7. So 1e17 / 3.154e7 = 1e17 /3.154e7 = 3.17e9 years. So 1.3862e17 s = 1.3862e17 /3.154e7 years.

Wait, 1e17 / 3e7 is about 3.33e9 (since 3.15e7 is approx 3e7, so 1e17/3e7 = (1e17)/(3e7) = (1e10)/(3e0) = 1e10/3 ≈ 3.333e9). So 1.3862e17 is 1.3862e10 * 1e7. Wait, no, 1e17 /3e7 = (1e10) * (1e7) /3e7 = 1e10 /3 ≈ 3.333e9.

Wait, correct way:

1.3862e17 s = (1.3862e17) / (3.154e7 s/year) = (1.3862 / 3.154) * 1e(17-7) = (0.44) *1e10 years.

Wait, 1.3862 /3.154 is approximately 0.44, because 3.154 × 0.44 is about 1.387. So 0.44e10 = 4.4e9 years. So approximately 4.4e9 years.

Looking at the options, let me check which options have a half-life close to that. Option I is 6.5e9, option G is 5e9, option B is 4.7e9, option F is 6.2e9, option A is 5.5e9, option H is 3.5e9, option D is 4.5e9, option E is 4e9, option J is 3.9e9.

So the closest is option B: 4.7e9, option F:6.2e9, option I:6.5e9, option D:4.5e9.

Wait, let's compute more accurately.

Compute 0.693147 /5e-18. That's 0.693147 /5e-18 = 0.1386294e18 s.

Now, converting 0.1386294e18 seconds to years.

One year is 3.154e7 seconds.

So 0.1386294e18 / 3.154e7 = ?

Compute 0.1386294e18 = 1.386294e17 s.

1.386294e17 / 3.154e7 = (1.386294 /3.154) * 1e10.

1.386294 /3.154 ≈ 0.44, as before.

0.44 *1e10 is 4.4e9 years.

So the half-life is approximately 4.4e9 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B (4.7e9), option D (4.5e9), option F (6.2e9), etc.

So among the options, the half-life is around 4.4e9, which is close to option D (4.5e9) and option B (4.7e9). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.1386294e18 s = 1.386294e17 s.

Divide by 3.154e7 s/year:

1.386294e17 /3.154e7 = (1.386294 /3.154) * 1e10.

1.386294 /3.154 = let me calculate that.

3.154 * 0.44 = 1.387, which is very close to 1.386294. So 0.44 is a good approximation.

So 0.44 *1e10 = 4.4e9 years.

So which option has 4.4e9? Option D is 4.5e9 and option B is 4.7e9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the half-life formula is T_1/2 = ln(2)/lambda.

Lambda is 5e-18 per second. So:

T_1/2 = 0.693147 / (5e-18) = 0.693147 /5e-18 = (0.693147 /5 ) *1e18 = 0.1386294e18 s.

Which is 1.386294e17 s.

Now, converting 1.386294e17 s to years:

1 year = 3.154e7 s.

So 1.386294e17 / 3.154e7 = (1.386294 /3.154) *1e10.

1.386294 ÷3.154.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.154 × 0.44 = 1.387. So 3.154 × 0.44 = 1.387. So 1.386294 is 0.000706 less than 1.387.

So 0.44 → 3.154 *0.44 = 1.387.

So 1.386294 is 1.387 - 0.000706.

Hmm, so 0.44 - (0.000706 /3.154) → 0.44 - (0.000223) ≈ 0.439777.

Wait, let me compute 1.386294 ÷3.154.

Let me do precise division.

3.154 goes into 1.386294 about 0.43977 times.

So 0.43977 ×1e10 = 4.3977e9 years.

So approximately 4.3977e9 years, which is about 4.4e9.

Looking at the options, option D is 9.84e24 (part a) and 4.5e9 (part b). So option D is 4.5e9, which is very close to our calculation of 4.4e9, but slightly higher.

But perhaps I should check if the calculation was done correctly. Let me see.

Wait, wait, wait a minute. I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the half-life. Because the problem says the decay rate per nucleus is lambda =5e-18 s^-1.

Wait, the half-life formula is T_1/2 = ln(2) / lambda. So lambda is 5e-18 s^-1. So ln(2) is approx 0.693147. So 0.693147 /5e-18 = 0.693147/(5e-18) = 1.386294e17 s.

As before. So yes, same result.

So the half-life is approximately 4.4e9 years. So the closest option is D (4.5e9) and B (4.7e9). But option D is 4.5e9, which is closer than option B.

Wait, but perhaps I should check if the calculation in part (a) was correct because the options may have more precise values.

Wait, in part (a), I think the answer is approximately 9.84e24, which is option D. But option D is 9.84e24 and 4.5e9 for the half-life. Yes, that's correct. So the answer for part (a) is D, and part (b) is D as well, but wait, the options list each part as separate options, like option D is for part (a), which is 9.84e24, and part (b) is 4.5e9, which is option D. Alternatively, looking back, the options are:

Options:

A:8.4e24,5.5e9

B:8.4e24,4.7e9

C:5e24,7e9

D:9.84e24,4.5e9

E:6.5e24,4e9

F:9.5e24,6.2e9

G:7e24,5e9

H:1.2e24,3.5e9

I:9.84e24,6.5e9

J:9.2e24,3.9e9

So, option D in the list is (9.84e24, 4.5e9). So that would be the correct answer for both parts.

Wait, but in the initial question, part (b) is the half-life. So the correct answer is option D, which gives both (9.84e24,4.5e9).

To solve the problem, we analyze the two parts separately:

---

### Part (a): Number of Uranium nuclei remaining after 10⁸ years

The formula for radioactive decay is:

\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}
\]

Where:
- \( N_0 = 10^{25} \)
- \( \lambda = 5 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)
- \( t = 10^8 \, \text{years} \)

First, convert \( t \) to seconds:

\[
t = 10^8 \, \text{years} \times 3.154 \times 10^7 \, \text{s/year} = 3.154 \times 10^{15} \, \text{s}
\]

Now, calculate \( \lambda \cdot t \):

\[
\lambda \cdot t = (5 \times 10^{-18}) \cdot (3.154 \times 10^{15}) = 0.01577
\]

Using the exponential function:

\[
e^{-0.01577} \approx 0.98435
\]

Thus, the number of remaining nuclei is:

\[
N(t) = 10^{25} \cdot 0.98435 \approx 9.8435 \times 10^{24}
\]

The closest option is **D: 9.84 × 10²⁴**.

---

### Part (b): Half-life of the uranium nuclei

The half-life formula is:

\[
T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( \ln 2 \approx 0.6931 \)
- \( \lambda = 5 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)

Substitute the values:

\[
T_{1/2} = \frac{0.6931}{5 \times 10^{-18}} = 0.13862 \times 10^{18} \, \text{s}
\]

Convert seconds to years:

\[
1 \, \text{year} = 3.154 \times 10^7 \, \text{s}
\]

\[
T_{1/2} = \frac{0.13862 \times 10^{18}}{3.154 \times 10^7} = 0.44 \times 10^{10} \, \text{years} = 4.4 \times 10^9 \, \text{years}
\]

The closest option is **D: 4.5 × 10⁹**.

---

### Final Answer

Both parts of the question are answered by option **D: 9.84 × 10²⁴, 4.5 × 10⁹**.
