Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a skier filmed by a motion picture. The problem says the skier travels 36 feet during the fourth second of filming and 48 feet during the sixth second. I need to find the total distance he covered in eight seconds. The options are given from A to J, and I've got to pick the right one. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

I remember that when dealing with uniformly accelerated motion, the distance covered can be calculated using the formula for displacement in the nth second. The formula for the distance in the nth second is:

s_n = u + (a/2)(2n -1)

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, the displacement during the nth second is given by s_n = u + (a/2)(2n -1), where u is the initial velocity and a is the acceleration. But wait, that’s for when the initial velocity is known. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't give the initial velocity. Hmm. Maybe I should use another approach.

Oh right, another formula for the distance traveled in the nth second when the motion is uniformly accelerated is:

s_n = (u + (n - 0.5)a) * 1 - (u + (n-1)a) * 0.5

Wait, maybe I should think about total displacement. The total displacement up to t seconds would be given by the equation:

s = ut + (1/2) a t².

But since the skier is moving with uniform acceleration, the displacement in each second can be found by subtracting the displacement up to the previous second from the current displacement.

Alternatively, I can use the formula that relates the displacement in the nth second and the displacement in the mth second. The displacement in the nth second is s_n = u + (n - 0.5) a.

Wait, let me restate that. The displacement in the nth second is u + a(n-0.5)/2. Or maybe I should think about the average velocity during that second.

Wait, another approach: The total displacement up to time t is s(t) = ut + (1/2)a t². So for each second, the displacement is s(n) - s(n-1), where s(n) is the displacement after n seconds.

So for the fourth second, the displacement is s(4) - s(3) = 36 feet.

Similarly, the sixth second, it's s(6) - s(5) = 48 feet.

Let me write that down:

s(4) - s(3) = 36 ft
s(6) - s(5) = 48 ft

But s(t) = ut + 0.5 a t². So,

s(4) = u*4 + 0.5 a (4)^2 = 4u + 8a
s(3) = u*3 + 0.5 a (3)^2 = 3u + 4.5a
So s(4)-s(3) = (4u +8a) - (3u +4.5a) )= u + 3.5 a = 36.

Similarly, s(6) = u*6 + 0.5 a (6)^2 =6u +18a
s(5)= u*5 + 0.5a*(5)^2=5u +12.5a
s(6)-s(5)= (6u +18a) - (5u +12.5a) )= u +5.5a =48.

So now I have two equations:

1. u + 3.5a = 36
2. u +5.5a =48

I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate u.

( u +5.5a ) - (u +3.5a ) = 48 -36
( u -u ) + (5.5a -3.5a) )=12
2a =12 => a=6 ft/s².

Now plug a=6 into equation 1: u +3.5*6=36
3.5 *6=21, so u=36-21=15 ft/s.

So initial velocity u=15 ft/s, acceleration a=6 ft/s².

Now, to find the total distance in 8 seconds: s(8) = u*8 +0.5 a*(8)^2.

Let's compute that:

s(8) =15*8 + 0.5 *6*64
=120 + 3 *64
=120 +192=312 feet.

Looking at the options, choice D is 312 ft. So the answer should be D.

To determine the total distance covered by the skier in eight seconds, we start by analyzing the given information. The skier travels 36 feet during the fourth second and 48 feet during the sixth second. Using the formula for displacement during the nth second:

\[
s_n = u + \frac{a}{2}(2n - 1)
\]

we set up two equations based on the given displacements:

1. For the fourth second (\(n = 4\)):
   \[
   s_4 = u + \frac{a}{2}(2 \cdot 4 - 1) = u + \frac{a}{2}(7) = 36
   \]

2. For the sixth second (\(n = 6\)):
   \[
   s_6 = u + \frac{a}{2}(2 \cdot 6 - 1) = u + \frac{a}{2}(11) = 48
   \]

Solving these equations:

1. \(u + 3.5a = 36\)
2. \(u + 5.5a = 48\)

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

\[
(5.5a - 3.5a) = 48 - 36 \implies 2a = 12 \implies a = 6 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

Substituting \(a = 6\) into the first equation:

\[
u + 3.5 \cdot 6 = 36 \implies u + 21 = 36 \implies u = 15 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Now, calculate the total distance covered in 8 seconds using the formula:

\[
s(t) = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

\[
s(8) = 15 \cdot 8 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 8^2 = 120 + 3 \cdot 64 = 120 + 192 = 312 \, \text{ft}
\]

Thus, the total distance covered in eight seconds is **312 feet**, corresponding to option **D**.
