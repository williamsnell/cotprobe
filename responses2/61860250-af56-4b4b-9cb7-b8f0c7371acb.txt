Okay, so I have this question about the Sinnott-Armstrong thesis. Hmm, I remember it was about the moral obligation of government officials. Let me think. The thesis, I think it's also known as the "Prohibition of Imprisonment" argument. It's part of Kant's moral philosophy. 

From what I recall, the thesis states that the moral obligation to hold certain criminals in prison is the same as the moral obligation to hold all criminals. So, if you have to hold a person for a crime, you must do it. But wait, the question here is about whether this fact proves that the government officials should promote a certain action.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each one. 

Option A says the fact doesn't prove they should promote it. But I thought the thesis supports the obligation, so this seems incorrect. 

Option B says the fact doesn't prove they should do it. Well, the thesis does say they must, but I'm not sure if it's just a statement of obligation or a proof of action. Wait, the thesis is more about the right to hold them, not necessarily the action. Like, it's a moral obligation, but does it force them to do it? 

Option C is about proving they shouldn't do it. That doesn't fit because the thesis says they should, so C is wrong.

Option D says it proves they should do it. That sounds correct because the thesis is about the obligation, not the action. However, I'm a bit confused because sometimes these theses can be about both the obligation and the action. 

Wait, but the question isn't about proving they should do it, but about whether the fact that the government morally ought to do something (like hold criminals) proves that they should. So the fact that they must hold criminals (as per the thesis) implies that they have a moral obligation to do it. So option D would be correct because the thesis shows that they should do it. 

So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: proves that you ought to do it, too. According to the Sinnott-Armstrong thesis, the obligation to hold criminals in prison is the same as the obligation to hold all criminals, implying that the government must take action. 

Answer: D
