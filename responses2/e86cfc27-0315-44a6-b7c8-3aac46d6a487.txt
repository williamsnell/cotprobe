Okay, so I have this question about machine learning concepts, specifically about the 1-NN and SVM with different kernels. Let's try to break this down.

First, the question is about two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. It asks whether each is true or false, then provides options about their correctness.

Statement 1 says that after mapping into a feature space Q using a radial basis kernel, 1-NN with unweighted Euclidean distance in the original space might perform better than in the feature space. But we can't guarantee that. Hmm.

I remember that kernel methods like radial basis are used to transform data into a higher dimensional space where it's easier to separate. So in the feature space, 1-NN might find a separating hyperplane that's easier to achieve. But the original space might have been more complex, so the 1-NN might not perform as well. But the statement says it's possible but we can't guarantee it. So Statement 1 is true? Because it's possible in some cases, but we can't always say for sure. So I think Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: The VC dimension of a Perceptron is smaller than that of a simple linear SVM. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I know that the VC dimension of a Perceptron (linear classifier) is d+1, where d is the number of features. For a linearly separable dataset, the maximum possible is n+1 where n is the number of examples, but usually it's d+1. The SVM, on the other hand, can find the maximum margin, which for a linear kernel is the same as the Perceptron's in some cases, but wait, no—Wait, no. Wait, the VC dimension of a linear SVM is the same as that of a Perceptron because they both are linear classifiers. Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, wait. The Perceptron can represent linear classifiers, but the linear SVM uses the maximum margin, which can also be linear. So both have the same VC dimension? Or is it higher?

Wait, no. The VC dimension of linear classifiers is n+1 if using the perceptron, but for the maximum margin, it's the same as the linear case. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, I think the linear SVM has a higher VC dimension than the Perceptron. Because the Perceptron is a PAC learning model with linear separability, while the SVM is probably more powerful because it finds the maximum margin, which is probably more permissive. Oh, wait, but the VC dimension of a linear SVM is the same as that of the Perceptron because the maximum margin is still linear. Wait no, that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, the VC dimension for a linear classifier is d+1, where d is the number of parameters. For a linear SVM, the number of parameters is d+1 (weights plus bias). Hmm, but both have the same VC dimension because they're both linear.

Wait, no. Wait, the Perceptron is a linear classifier, which has a VC dimension of d+1, where d is the dimension of the input space. The linear SVM is also a linear classifier, but it uses the maximum margin, which is a different approach but still linear. So their VC dimensions must be the same. So Statement 2 is False because their VC dimensions are equal, not smaller.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. The VC dimension for a linear classifier is indeed d+1, where d is the number of features. The linear SVM, using the kernel trick, is effectively a linear classifier, so it should have the same VC dimension.

So Statement 2 says that the Perceptron's VC is smaller than the linear SVM's. That would be false. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident. Let me think again. Another way: The Perceptron can only shatter up to n+1 points in 2D, but for higher dimensions, perhaps it can shatter more. Wait, no, the VC dimension is the maximum number of points that can be shattered. For a linear classifier in d+1 dimensions, it can shatter d+2 points. Wait, no, that's not right. The VC dimension for a linear classifier in d-dimensional space is d+1. So the maximum number of points that can be shattered is d+1. So the VC dimension is d+1. So both the Perceptron and the linear SVM (which is also a linear classifier) have the same VC dimension. So Statement 2 is False.

So now, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Now look at the options. The options are combinations of True and False for Statements 1 and 2.

Options:

A: P/F, P/F → False, False → I think Statement 2 is False. So A is False, False.

B: P/F, P/F → same as A, but according to my analysis, Statement 1 is P, Statement 2 is F. So B is P/F, P/F → which is same as A, but wait, no, because Statement 1 is P, Statement 2 is F. So B would have Statement 2 as P, which is incorrect. So B is incorrect.

C: T/F → No, Statement 1 is T, so C is incorrect.

D: T, P → No, Statement 2 is F, so D is incorrect.

E: F, F → Both statements are F, but I thought Statement 1 is T, so E is incorrect.

F: T, T → No, because Statement 2 is F.

G: P/F, P → No, because Statement 2 is F.

H: P/F, T → No, because Statement 2 is F.

I: P/F, F → Statement 2 is F, correct. So I is P/F, F.

J: F, T → No, because Statement 1 is T, and Statement 2 is F.

So the correct option should be I: P/F, F. Because Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. So the answer is I.

The analysis of the two statements leads to the conclusion that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False. 

- **Statement 1**: After mapping into a feature space using a radial basis kernel, 1-NN may perform better in the original space but cannot guarantee this. This is True because it's possible, but we can't always say it will work.

- **Statement 2**: The VC dimension of a Perceptron (linear classifier) is smaller than that of a linear SVM. This is False because both have the same VC dimension as linear classifiers.

Thus, the correct option is I: Partly True, False.

**Answer: I**
