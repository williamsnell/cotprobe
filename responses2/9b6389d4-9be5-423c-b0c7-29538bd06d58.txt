Okay, so I've got this mortgage problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about calculating the monthly mortgage payment when the homebuyer takes out a $100,000 loan over 30 years with an interest rate of 9%.

Hmm, I remember there's a formula for calculating the monthly mortgage payment. It's something to do with the principal, the interest rate, and the number of payments. Oh right, it's the PMT function in finance, which calculates the payment needed to pay off a loan. The formula is:

M = P [ i(1+i)^n ] / [ (1+i)^n - 1 ]

Where:
- M is the monthly payment
- P is the principal loan amount ($100,000)
- i is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
- n is the number of payments (30 years * 12 months/year = 360)

Let me break it down. The annual interest rate is 9%, so the monthly rate is 9% divided by 12. Let me calculate that. 9 divided by 12 is 0.75%, which is 0.0075 in decimal form.

Then, n is 30 years times 12 months, so that's 360 months.

Now, plugging these into the formula. First, calculate (1 + i)^n. So that's (1 + 0.0075)^360. Hmm, that's a big exponent. I'm not going to compute it exactly right now, but I can remember that (1 + r)^n grows exponentially. For large n, especially when r is small, it's roughly e^(rn), but wait, that's for continuous compounding. Alternatively, I could approximate, but maybe a better approach is to use a financial calculator or a formula.

Alternatively, I know that for a fixed-rate mortgage, the monthly payment can be calculated using this formula. Let me try plugging in the numbers.

First, compute i*(1 + i)^n. Let me compute (1 + i) first: 1.0075. Then, raising that to the 360th power. Hmm, I think (1.0075)^360 is a large number. Maybe I can estimate it, but perhaps I should compute it step by step. Wait, perhaps I can use logarithms or a calculator. But since I'm doing it in my head, I'll have to think of an approximation.

Wait, another approach: I remember that 9% over 30 years is a standard rate, so perhaps the monthly payment is around $870. But I'm probably not remembering correctly. Alternatively, I can think of the formula in another way.

Wait another thought: 9% over 30 years is a standard mortgage rate. I think the monthly payment is around $800 or so. Let me check this with the formula.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, i = 0.09 / 12 = 0.0075.

Then, (1 + i) is 1.0075.

Next, (1.0075)^360. I'm not exactly calculating this, but I remember that for a 9% rate, the monthly payment is about $820. Let me see if I can verify that.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula M = P * [i(1+i)^n] / [(1+i)^n - 1]

But without a calculator, it's a bit tricky. Let me approximate. Let me compute each part one by one.

Compute (1 + i)^n.

(1.0075)^360. Hmm, I think this is a number that's around 1000, but I'm not sure. Because 7.5% over 30 years is a significant rate, so the factor would be way larger than 1. Let's see: 7.5% is lower than 9% but over 30 years. Wait, maybe I can think of it as 1000. Let's say (1.0075)^360 ≈ 1000. I'm not sure if that's accurate, but let's proceed.

So then, (1.0075)^360 ≈ 1000.

Then, the numerator is i*(1.0075)^360 = 0.0075 * 1000 = 7.5.

The denominator is (1.0075)^360 - 1 = 1000 - 1 = 999.

So then, the numerator over denominator is 7.5 / 999 ≈ 0.0075.

So M = P * 0.0075. Since P is $100,000, M = 100,000 * 0.0075 = $750.

But wait, that's $750. But I thought the right answer was around $800 or so. Did I make a mistake?

Ah, perhaps because I approximated (1.0075)^360 as 1000. I think that's too low. Let me think again. Wait, 1.0075^360. Let me try to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 78 or another approximation, but maybe I should think differently. Let me try another approach. 

The formula can be written as M = 100000 * [0.0075*(1.0075)^360] / [(1.0075)^360 - 1]

If (1.0075)^360 is about 1000. Let's assume it's 1000. Then as before, the numerator is 0.0075 * 1000 = 7.5. The denominator is 999.

So 7.5 / 999 = approximately 0.0075.

So M = 100000 * 0.0075 = 750.

But wait, that's $750, which is option A. But I remember that for a 9% rate, the monthly payment is around $820. So maybe my approximation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.0075)^360 more accurately. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I can think that 1.0075^12 is about 1.0938, so for 12 years, it's about 10% increase. For 360 months, which is 30 years, so 30 times that exponent. But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, I can use logarithms. Take natural log of 1.0075. ln(1.0075) ≈ 0.00745.

Multiply by 360: 0.00745 * 360 = 2.682.

Exponentiate: e^2.682 ≈ e^2.682.

e^2 is about 7.389, e^0.682 is approximately e^0.682. Since e^0.6 is about 1.822, e^0.7 is about 2.0138. So 0.682 is about 1.986.

So e^2.682 ≈ 7.389 * 1.986 ≈ around 14.64.

Wait, but wait, that's the result of (1.0075)^360. So that's approximately 14.64. So I think my previous approximation was wrong. It's much higher than 1000. So that changes things.

So let me correct that. (1.0075)^360 ≈ 14.64.

So, going back: numerator is 0.0075 * 14.64 = 0.1098.

Denominator is 14.64 - 1 = 13.64.

So 0.1098 /13.64 ≈ 0.00807.

So M = 100,000 * 0.00807 ≈ $807.

Looking back at the options, D is $804.62, which is very close. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but wait, I got 0.00807, which is 8.07 cents per $1, so 100,000 * 0.00807 is 807. So about $807. The options have $804.62 as D, which is very close. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, the initial calculation with 14.64 was because I took ln(1.0075) ≈0.00745, which when multiplied by 360 gives 2.682. Then e^2.682 is about 14.64, yes.

So then, the monthly payment is approximately $807. So the closest option is D: $804.62.

But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might have made an approximation error. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a better way to compute it.

Alternatively, I can use a financial calculator approach, but since I don't have one, I'll rely on the formula.

So, putting it all together, the correct calculation leads to approximately $804.62 as the monthly payment, which is option D.
</think>

To calculate the monthly mortgage payment, we use the formula:

\[ M = P \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1} \]

Where:
- \( P = \$100,000 \) (principal)
- \( r = 0.09 / 12 = 0.0075 \) (monthly interest rate)
- \( n = 30 \times 12 = 360 \) (total number of payments)

1. Compute \( (1 + r)^n \):
   - \( (1.0075)^{360} \approx 14.64 \)

2. Compute the numerator:
   - \( r \times (1 + r)^n = 0.0075 \times 14.64 = 0.1098 \)

3. Compute the denominator:
   - \( (1 + r)^n - 1 = 14.64 - 1 = 13.64 \)

4. Calculate \( M \):
   - \( M = \frac{100,000 \times 0.1098}{13.64} \approx \frac{10,980}{13.64} \approx 807 \)

The closest option is D: $804.62.
