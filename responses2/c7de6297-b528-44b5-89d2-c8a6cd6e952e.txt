Okay, so I need to solve this initial value problem: the second-order differential equation 3u'' - u' + 2u = 0 with initial conditions u(0)=2 and u'(0)=0. Then, I have to find the first time t>0 where the absolute value of u(t) is 10. The options are given from A to J. 

First, I'll recall that for linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, we typically look for solutions of the form u(t) = e^(rt), where r is a root of the characteristic equation. So, let's form that equation.

The given DE is 3u'' - u' + 2u = 0. To find the characteristic equation, I substitute u'' = r², u' = r, and u = 1. So, the characteristic equation becomes 3r² - r + 2 = 0.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. The standard approach is to replace u'' with r², u' with r, and u with 1. So, the equation becomes 3r² - r + 2 = 0. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that.

Wait, the original equation is 3u'' - u' + 2u = 0. So substituting, that's 3r² * 1 - r * 1 + 2 * 1 = 0. So the characteristic equation is 3r² - r + 2 = 0. Okay, correct.

Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation for r. Using the quadratic formula, r = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4*3*2)] / (2*3). Let's compute the discriminant first: 1 - 24 = -23. So, sqrt(-23) is i*sqrt(23). So, the roots are (1 ± i√23)/6.

So, the roots are complex: r = (1 ± i√23)/6. Let me write that as r = (1 + i√23)/6 and r = (1 - i√23)/6. Since they are complex conjugates, the general solution for u(t) when you have complex roots is u(t) = e^(α t) [C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)], where α is the real part and β is the imaginary part.

In this case, α is 1/6, and β is sqrt(23)/6. So, the solution is u(t) = e^(t/6) [C1 cos(√23 t /6) + C2 sin(√23 t /6)].

Now, we can apply the initial conditions to find C1 and C2. Let's apply u(0)=2 first. At t=0, the exponential becomes e^0 =1, and the sine term is sin(0)=0, the cosine term is cos(0)=1. So:

u(0) = e^0 [C1*1 + C2*0] = C1 =2. So, C1=2.

Next, u'(0)=0. Let's compute u'. To find u', I need to differentiate u(t). Let me write u(t) as e^(t/6) [C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)], where β=√23/6.

So, u'(t) = [e^(t/6)]' [C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)] + e^(t/6) [ derivative of [C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)] ]

The derivative of e^(t/6) is (1/6) e^(t/6). So,

u'(t) = (1/6) e^(t/6) [C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)] + e^(t/6) [ -C1 β sin(β t) + C2 β cos(β t) ]

Now, evaluate u'(0). At t=0:

u'(0) = (1/6) e^0 [2 * 1 + 0] + e^0 [ -2*β*0 + C2 β *1 ]

So, u'(0) = (1/6)(2) + C2 β.

But u'(0) is given as 0. So,

(1/6)*2 + C2*(√23/6) =0.

Simplify:

(2/6) + (C2 √23)/6 =0 → (1/3) + (C2 √23)/6 =0.

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:

2 + C2 √23 =0 → C2 √23 = -2 → C2 = -2/√23.

We can rationalize the denominator, but perhaps it's better to leave it as is for now.

So, now we have C1=2 and C2= -2/√23. Therefore, the solution is:

u(t) = e^(t/6) [2 cos(√23 t /6) - (2/√23) sin(√23 t /6) ]

Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this expression a bit. Let me see.

We can factor out 2 and the denominator √23:

u(t) = 2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t /6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t /6) ].

Alternatively, this can be expressed as a single cosine function with a phase shift. Because any linear combination of sine and cosine can be written as a single cosine with a phase angle. 

Wait, let me think. The form is A cos(ω t) + B sin(ω t) can be written as C cos(ω t - φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²), and tan φ = B/A.

Wait, but in this case, we have A=2 and B= -2/√23. So, let's compute C.

C = sqrt( (2)^2 + ( - 2/√23 )^2 ) = sqrt(4 + 4/23) = sqrt(4*(1 + 1/23)) )= sqrt(4*(24/23)) )= 2 * sqrt(24/23) )= 2*(2 * sqrt(6/23)) )= 4 sqrt(6/23). Hmm, wait, maybe I can compute it more precisely.

Wait, 4 + 4/23 = (4*23 +4)/23 = (92 +4)/23 = 96/23. So, C = sqrt(96/23) = sqrt(96)/sqrt(23) )= (4 sqrt(6))/sqrt(23) )= 4 sqrt(6/23). Hmm, simplifying, but perhaps that's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to keep it as 2 e^(t/6) [ cos(ω t) - (1/√23) sin(ω t) ] where ω = √23/6.

But regardless, for the purpose of finding |u(t)|, perhaps I can compute u(t) as is.

Now, the problem is to find the first time t>0 when |u(t)|=10. So, I need to solve for t in |u(t)|=10.

Since u(t) is a combination of exponential and oscillating functions, as t increases, the exponential term e^(t/6) grows, while the oscillations oscillate with a decaying envelope. Wait, but wait, the exponential here is e^(t/6), which actually grows as t increases. So, the amplitude of u(t) increases with time. So, as t increases, |u(t)| will grow, but since we need |u(t)|=10, and perhaps, wait, the initial conditions are u(0)=2 and u' (0)=0, so the solution starts at 2 and then perhaps, in the future, the exponential growth could cause u(t) to reach 10.

Wait, but let's think about the behavior. The solution is u(t)=2 e^(t/6) [cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t /6)]. The exponential term will dominate as t increases, so u(t) will grow exponentially. So, perhaps, for u(t), the magnitude will eventually exceed 10, but let's see.

Now, let's think about when |u(t)|=10. Since the exponential is positive, and the oscillating terms are bounded, the magnitude of u(t) is approximately 2 e^(t/6) times the amplitude of the oscillation. The oscillation part is bounded by the amplitude C, which we found earlier as 4 sqrt(6/23). So, the maximum value of |u(t)| is approximately 2 e^(t/6) * C.

Wait, but wait, wait, perhaps I can write u(t) in a better way. Let me go back.

The expression is u(t) = e^(t/6) [2 cos(√23 t /6) - (2/√23) sin(√23 t /6) ]

Let me factor out the 2, so:

u(t) = 2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t /6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t /6) ]

Alternatively, I can write this as:

u(t) = 2 e^(t/6) [ cos(θ) - (1/√23) sin(θ) ] where θ=√23 t /6.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to combine these terms into a single cosine function with a phase shift.

Let me consider the expression inside the brackets:

cos(θ) - (1/√23) sin(θ) = A cos(θ + φ)

Wait, the general formula for A cos(θ + φ) is A cos θ cos φ - A sin θ sin φ.

Comparing with cos θ - (1/√23) sin θ, we have:

A cos φ =1, and A sin φ = 1/√23.

So, A² cos² φ + A² sin² φ = (1)^2 + (1/√23)^2 = 1 + 1/23 = 24/23.

So, A² = 24/23 → A= sqrt(24/23) )= 2 sqrt(6/23).

Thus, cos φ = 1/A = √(23)/ (2√6), and sin φ = (1/√23)/A = (1/√23) / [2√(6/23)] )= (1/√23) * √(23)/(2√6) )= 1/(2√6).

So, cos φ = √23/(2√6), sin φ = 1/(2√6). 

Therefore, the expression becomes:

cos(theta) - (1/√23) sin(theta) = A cos(theta + phi) where A= sqrt(24/23) and phi is such that cos phi = √23/(2√6), sin phi=1/(2√6).

So, u(t) = 2 e^(t/6) * sqrt(24/23) cos(theta + phi).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I can compute it as 2 e^(t/6) * C cos(theta - phi), but perhaps I should just compute the exact value.

Wait, but perhaps instead of getting into the phase shift, I can ignore it because for the purposes of finding when |u(t)|=10, I can perhaps consider the maximum possible value of |u(t)|. Since u(t) is a product of an exponential and an amplitude with oscillations, the maximum possible |u(t)| would be roughly 2 e^(t/6) multiplied by the amplitude.

So, the amplitude is sqrt(24/23), which is about sqrt(24)/sqrt(23) ≈ 4.899 /4.796 ≈ 1.020.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the amplitude is about 1.020. So, the maximum |u(t)| is about 2 * 1.020 * e^(t/6) ≈ 2.04 e^(t/6).

We need |u(t)|=10, so 2.04 e^(t/6) ≈10 → e^(t/6)=10/2.04 ≈4.878 → t/6=ln(4.878) ≈1.585 → t≈6*1.585≈9.51. So, approximately 9.51, which is near option B: 9.5678. But wait, this is a rough estimate. The actual value might be a bit higher because the amplitude doesn't stay constant.

But wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model u(t) as 2 e^(t/6) multiplied by a cosine function whose amplitude is sqrt(24/23) ≈ 1.020.

So, the maximum |u(t)| is approximately 2.04 e^(t/6). Setting this equal to 10: 2.04 e^(t/6)=10 → e^(t/6)=10/2.04≈4.878.

So, ln(4.878)= ln(4.878). Let me compute ln(4.878): ln(4)=1.386, ln(5)=1.609, so 4.878 is about 1.585, since 4.878 is between 4 and 5.

So, t/6=1.585 → t=6*1.585≈9.51. So, approximately 9.51 seconds.

Looking at the options, option B is 9.5678. That's close. But perhaps the actual time is a bit longer because the amplitude isn't exactly constant, but perhaps the phase shift allows the oscillation to reach the required amplitude earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is to compute u(t) and set |u(t)|=10.

Wait, let's compute u(t)=2 e^(t/6)[cos(√23 t /6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t /6)]. 

Suppose we let t be such that the amplitude inside the brackets becomes 5, so that 2 e^(t/6)*5 =10 → e^(t/6)=2 → t=6 ln 2 ≈6*0.6931≈4.158, but that would be too early. Wait, but that's assuming that the amplitude inside the bracket is 5, but that might not be the case. No, because the amplitude inside the brackets is sqrt(24/23) ≈1.020.

So, perhaps the actual time when |u(t)|=10 is when 2 e^(t/6) * sqrt(24/23) * cos(theta) = ±10.

So, the maximum value is 2 e^(t/6) * sqrt(24/23). Wait, no, actually, the maximum value of u(t) is 2 e^(t/6) * C, where C is the amplitude of the oscillation. So, the maximum occurs when the cosine term is 1, and the minimum when it's -1, so the absolute value is C.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum possible u(t). The maximum |u(t)| would be 2 e^(t/6) multiplied by the amplitude of the oscillation, which is sqrt( (2)^2 + ( -2/√23 )^2 )= sqrt(4 + 4/23)= sqrt(96/23)=sqrt(4.1739)= approximately 2.042.

So, the maximum possible |u(t)| is 2 e^(t/6) * 2.042 ≈4.084 e^(t/6). So, set 4.084 e^(t/6) =10 → e^(t/6)=10/4.084 ≈2.446 → t/6= ln(2.446)≈0.892 → t≈5.35. Hmm, that's lower than our earlier rough estimate, but that can't be right because at t=5.35, the exponential would be e^(0.892)= ~2.446, but perhaps the actual time when |u(t)|=10 is when the exponential multiplied by the oscillation reaches 10.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute u(t) for t values and see when it reaches 10.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it using the solution we have:

u(t)=2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ]

Let me compute u(t) numerically. Let me pick t=6, which is when the exponential is e^1≈2.718.

At t=6, √23 t/6 = √23 *6/6=√23≈4.796.

So, cos(4.796)≈ cos(4.796 - 2π)= cos(4.796 -6.283)= cos(-1.487)=cos(1.487)= approx -0.113.

Sin(4.796)= approx sin(1.487)= approx 0.992.

So, the expression inside the brackets is cos(θ) - (1/√23) sin(θ) ≈ (-0.113) - (1/4.796)(0.992) ≈ (-0.113) - (0.204) → -0.317.

So, u(6)=2 * e^1 * (-0.317) ≈2*2.718*(-0.317)=approx 5.436*(-0.317)= approx -1.723. So, |u(6)|≈1.723, which is much less than 10.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because the exponential is increasing, but the amplitude of the oscillation is also increasing, perhaps? Wait, no, because the amplitude of the oscillation is sqrt(24/23)≈1.020, not increasing with t. So, the maximum possible |u(t)| is 2 e^(t/6) * 1.020. So, as t increases, the maximum |u(t)| increases exponentially.

Wait, but in that case, when t increases, the maximum |u(t)| would exceed 10 at some finite time. Wait, but the initial value is 2. So, for t=0, |u(0)|=2. As t increases, the maximum |u(t)| increases. So, when does the maximum |u(t)| reach 10?

Wait, perhaps we can compute the time when the maximum possible |u(t)| is 10. That would be when 2 e^(t/6) * sqrt(24/23) =10 → e^(t/6)=10/(2*sqrt(24/23)) )=5/(sqrt(24/23)) )=5*sqrt(23/24).

Wait, sqrt(23/24)=sqrt(0.9583)= approx 0.979.

So, e^(t/6)=5 * 0.979≈4.895 → t/6=ln(4.895)= approx 1.592 → t≈6*1.592≈9.55.

Hmm, so approximately t=9.55. Looking at the options, option B is 9.5678, which is very close. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But wait, perhaps the actual time is a bit longer because the amplitude of the oscillation is not constant. Let me think: the amplitude C depends on the initial conditions. Wait, in this case, the initial amplitude is 2, and the oscillation amplitude is determined by the solution. So, perhaps, the amplitude doesn't change much, so the maximum |u(t)| is approximately 2 e^(t/6) *1.02, so the time when the maximum |u(t)| reaches 10 is about 9.55, which corresponds to option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact solution is more accurate. Let me compute the exact maximum.

The maximum value of |u(t)| is 2 e^(t/6)*sqrt(24/23) =2 e^(t/6)* (2 sqrt(6/23)) )=4 sqrt(6/23) e^(t/6).

Setting this equal to 10:

4 sqrt(6/23) e^(t/6)=10 → e^(t/6)=10/(4 sqrt(6/23)) )= (10)/(4) * sqrt(23/6) )= (5/2) * sqrt(23/6) )= (5/2)* (sqrt(23)/sqrt(6)) )= (5 sqrt(23))/(2 sqrt(6)).

Simplify: (5 sqrt(23))/(2 sqrt(6)) )= (5 sqrt(23) * sqrt(6)) )/(2*6) )= (5 sqrt(138))/(12).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute t when |u(t)|=10.

u(t)=2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ].

We can write this as u(t)=2 e^(t/6) * sqrt(24/23) cos(√23 t/6 + phi), where phi is some phase shift.

Wait, that's a way to write it, but perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it numerically. Let me compute u(t) at t=9.55.

t=9.55, √23 t/6 = sqrt(23)*9.55/6 ≈4.796 *9.55/6≈4.796 *1.5917≈7.658.

So, cos(7.658) ≈ cos(7.658 - 2π *1)= cos(7.658-6.283)=cos(1.375)≈-0.223.

Sin(7.658)=sin(1.375)≈0.975.

So, the expression inside the brackets is:

cos(7.658) - (1/√23) sin(7.658)≈ (-0.223) - (1/4.796)(0.975)≈ (-0.223) - (0.202)≈-0.425.

So, u(t)=2 e^(9.55/6) * (-0.425) → 2 * e^(1.5917) * (-0.425). e^(1.5917)= approx 4.895.

So, u(t)=2*4.895*(-0.425)=9.79*(-0.425)≈-4.166.

Wait, that's |u(t)|≈4.166, which is way below 10. So, perhaps the time is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, the amplitude of the oscillation is sqrt(24/23)≈1.020, so the maximum |u(t)| is 2 * e^(t/6) *1.020≈2.04 e^(t/6). So, to reach 10, t needs to be such that 2.04 e^(t/6)=10 → e^(t/6)=10/2.04≈4.878 → t/6=ln(4.878)=approx1.585 → t≈9.51 seconds.

Hmm, that's near option B: 9.5678. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me set u(t) =2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ].

Let me compute when |u(t)|=10.

So, 2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ] = ±10.

So, let's take the positive case: 2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ] =10.

We can write this as e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ] =5.

Let me denote this as e^(t/6) * A =5, where A= cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6).

But perhaps the phase shift makes it so that A varies between -sqrt( (cos^2 + (1/√23)^2 )) and +sqrt( (cos^2 + (1/√23)^2 ))).

Wait, the amplitude of A is sqrt( cos^2 + (1/√23)^2 )= sqrt(1 + 1/23)= sqrt(24/23)=sqrt(24)/sqrt(23)=2 sqrt(6)/sqrt(23)=approx 2.042.

So, the maximum value of A is 2.042, and the minimum is -2.042.

But in our case, the equation is e^(t/6) * A =5.

So, if A can reach 2.042, then e^(t/6)=5/2.042≈2.446 → t/6=ln(2.446)=approx0.892 → t≈5.35.

But that's way before the time when u(t) starts to become 10. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be solved numerically.

Let me try to write a function for u(t) and find when it equals 10.

Let's pick t=6: u(t)=2 e^1 [ cos(√23) - (1/√23) sin(√23) ].

Compute √23≈4.796.

cos(4.796)=cos(4.796 - 2π)=cos(4.796 -6.283)=cos(-1.487)=cos(1.487)=approx-0.113.

sin(4.796)=sin(-1.487)=approx-0.992.

So, u(6)=2*2.718*(-0.113 - (0.992/4.796)) → 5.436*(-0.113 -0.204)=5.436*(-0.317)=approx-1.723.

So, |u(6)|≈1.723.

Hmm, but 1.723 is much less than 10. So, perhaps the time is much larger.

Wait, perhaps I should compute u(t) when t=6*ln(10/2.04). Let's see:

Wait, if e^(t/6)=5/(2.042)= approx 2.446 → t/6=ln(2.446)=approx0.892 → t≈5.35. But that's before the exponential term starts to grow. So, perhaps the maximum occurs at t=5.35, but in reality, the exponential term grows much more rapidly.

Wait, perhaps I can compute u(t) at t=6*ln(10/2.04)=5.35.

But let me compute u(t) at t=5.35.

Compute √23 *5.35/6 ≈4.796 *5.35/6≈4.796 *0.8917≈4.297.

So, cos(4.297)=cos(4.297 - 2π)=cos(4.297-6.283)=cos(-1.986)=cos(1.986)=approx-0.375.

Sin(4.297)=sin(1.986)=approx0.928.

So, u(t)=2 e^(5.35/6) [ (-0.375) - (1/4.796)(0.928) ] → e^(0.8917)=approx2.446.

So, u(t)=2*2.446 [ (-0.375) - (0.193) ] → 4.892 * (-0.568)=approx-2.822.

So, |u(t)|≈2.822, which is still much less than 10. So, that suggests that the time when |u(t)|=10 is much later.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a numerical method.

Let me set u(t) =2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ].

We can compute this function and find where it equals 10.

Let me try to compute it for t=6:

As done earlier, u(6)=approx-1.723.

At t=6*1.5=9: u(9)=2 e^(1.5) [ cos(√23*9/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23*9/6) ].

√23*9/6=√23*1.5≈4.796*1.5≈7.194.

cos(7.194)=cos(7.194-2π)=cos(7.194-6.283)=cos(0.911)=approx0.625.

sin(7.194)=sin(0.911)=approx0.785.

So, u(9)=2*4.4815 [0.625 - (0.785/4.796) ] → 8.963 [0.625 -0.164] →8.963*0.461=approx4.156.

So, |u(9)|≈4.156.

Hmm, still less than 10. So, perhaps the time is about double that.

Wait, perhaps at t=12: u(12)=2 e^(2) [ cos(√23*12/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23*12/6) ].

√23*12/6=√23*2≈4.796*2≈9.592.

cos(9.592)=cos(9.592-2π*1)=cos(9.592-6.283)=cos(3.309)=approx-0.974.

sin(9.592)=sin(3.309)=approx-0.228.

So, u(12)=2*7.389 [ (-0.974) - ( (-0.228)/4.796 ) ] →14.778 [ (-0.974) - (-0.0475) ] →14.778*(-0.9265)=approx-13.66.

So, |u(12)|≈13.66, which is above 10. So, the time is between 9 and 12 seconds.

At t=10: compute u(10)=2 e^(10/6) [ cos(√23*10/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23*10/6) ].

√23*10/6≈4.796*1.666≈8.06.

cos(8.06)=cos(8.06-2π)=cos(8.06-6.283)=cos(1.777)=approx-0.148.

sin(8.06)=sin(1.777)=approx0.988.

So, u(10)=2*4.4815 [ (-0.148) - (0.988/4.796) ] →8.963 [ (-0.148) -0.204 ] →8.963*(-0.352)=approx-3.168.

So, |u(10)|≈3.168.

At t=11:

√23*11/6≈4.796*1.833≈8.774.

cos(8.774)=cos(8.774-2π)=cos(8.774-6.283)=cos(2.491)=approx-0.787.

sin(8.774)=sin(2.491)=approx0.622.

So, u(11)=2*4.4815 [ (-0.787) - (0.622/4.796) ] →8.963 [ (-0.787) -0.129 ] →8.963*(-0.916)=approx-8.23.

So, |u(11)|≈8.23.

Close to 10.

At t=11.5:

√23*11.5/6≈4.796*1.917≈9.16.

cos(9.16)=cos(9.16-2π)=cos(9.16-6.283)=cos(2.877)=approx-0.96.

sin(9.16)=sin(2.877)=approx0.28.

So, u(11.5)=2*4.4815 [ (-0.96) - (0.28/4.796) ] →8.963 [ (-0.96) -0.058 ] →8.963*(-1.018)=approx-9.10.

So, |u(11.5)|≈9.10.

Closer to 10.

At t=11.8:

√23*11.8/6≈4.796*1.967≈9.395.

cos(9.395)=cos(9.395-2π)=cos(9.395-6.283)=cos(3.112)=approx-0.999.

sin(9.395)=sin(3.112)=approx0.045.

So, u(11.8)=2*4.4815 [ (-0.999) - (0.045/4.796) ] →8.963 [ (-0.999) -0.0095 ] →8.963*(-1.0085)=approx-8.99.

So, |u(11.8)|≈8.99.

Hmm, so between t=11.5 and t=11.8, |u(t)| goes from 9.10 to 8.99.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me try t=11.6:

√23*11.6/6≈4.796*1.933≈9.255.

cos(9.255)=cos(9.255-2π)=cos(9.255-6.283)=cos(2.972)=approx-0.958.

sin(9.255)=sin(2.972)=approx0.288.

So, u(t)=2*4.4815 [ (-0.958) - (0.288/4.796) ] →8.963 [ (-0.958) -0.0598 ] →8.963*(-1.0178)=approx-9.08.

|u(t)|≈9.08.

Hmm, so perhaps the time is around 11.6 to 11.8, but how accurate can we be?

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a function and find the root where u(t)=10.

So, let's define f(t)=2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ].

We are to solve f(t)=10.

We can compute f(t) at various points and use linear approximation to estimate t.

From earlier:

At t=11.5: f(t)=2* e^(11.5/6) [ cos(...) - ... ] → approx -8.23 → |u|=8.23.

At t=11.6: f(t)= approx -9.08 → |u|=9.08.

At t=11.7: compute f(t)=2 e^(11.7/6) [ cos(...) - ... ].

√23*11.7/6≈4.796*1.95≈9.306.

cos(9.306)=cos(9.306-2π)=cos(9.306-6.283)=cos(3.023)=approx-0.951.

sin(9.306)=sin(3.023)=approx0.307.

So, u(t)=2*4.4815 [ (-0.951) - (0.307/4.796) ] →8.963 [ (-0.951) -0.0643 ] →8.963*(-1.0153)=approx-9.06.

|u(t)|≈9.06.

Hmm, interesting.

At t=11.8: √23*11.8/6≈4.796*1.967≈9.395.

cos(9.395)=cos(9.395-2π)=cos(9.395-6.283)=cos(3.112)=approx-0.999.

Wait, but wait, cos(3.112)=approx -0.999, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator for cos(3.112) is better.

But perhaps I can accept that cos(3.112)=approx -0.999.

Similarly, sin(9.395)=sin(3.112)=approx0.045.

So, u(t)=2*4.4815 [ (-0.999) - (0.045/4.796) ] →8.963 [ (-0.999) -0.0095 ] →8.963*(-1.0185)=approx-9.07.

|u(t)|≈9.07.

Hmm, so f(t) is approaching around 9.07 at t=11.8.

Wait, but earlier, at t=11.5, f(t)≈-8.23, |u|=8.23.

At t=11.6, |u|=9.08.

At t=11.8, |u|=9.07.

So, perhaps the time when |u(t)|=10 is between t=11.6 and t=11.8.

But perhaps I can do a linear approximation between t=11.6 and t=11.8.

At t=11.6, |u|=9.08.

At t=11.8, |u|=9.07.

Wait, that's a decrease of 0.01 over 0.2 increase in t. So, the slope is -0.01/0.2= -0.05 per unit t.

We need to find t where |u|=10, which is 10-9.08=0.92 higher than at t=11.6.

So, the required change in t is (0.92)/(0.05 per t unit) )=18.4 units.

But wait, that's impossible because from t=11.6 to t=11.8, it's only 0.2 t units.

Wait, perhaps my previous approach was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the derivative of f(t) to find the rate of change of |u(t)| with respect to t.

Let me denote |u(t)|=sqrt( [2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ] ]^2 )=2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ].

So, let me define y(t)=2 e^(t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ].

We want y(t)=10.

We can compute dy/dt.

Let me compute dy/dt.

dy/dt = 2 [ e^(t/6) ( t/6 ) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ] + e^(t/6) [ -√23 sin(√23 t/6) - (1/√23)*√23 cos(√23 t/6) ] ].

Simplify:

=2 e^(t/6) [ (t/6) [ cos(√23 t/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23 t/6) ] - √23 sin(√23 t/6) - sin(√23 t/6) ].

Hmm, this is getting complex. Maybe instead, I can compute dy/dt numerically.

Compute dy/dt at t=11.6:

First, compute y(t) at t=11.6: y(11.6)=≈-9.08.

Compute dy/dt at t=11.6:

We can compute it as [ y(11.6 + Δt) - y(11.6) ] / Δt, for small Δt.

Let me choose Δt=0.2.

Compute y(11.6 +0.2)=y(11.8)=approx -9.07.

So, dy/dt≈(-9.07 - (-9.08))/0.2= (0.01)/0.2=0.05 per t unit.

Wait, but then, since y(t) is decreasing with a rate of 0.05 per t unit, to reach y(t)=10 from y(t)=9.08, we need a change of (10-9.08)=0.92 in y(t).

So, the required Δt is (0.92)/(0.05 per t unit)=18.4 units.

But this is impossible because from t=11.6 to t=11.8, Δt=0.2.

So, perhaps this suggests that t must be beyond 11.8, but that would cause y(t) to start increasing again.

But wait, let me compute y(t) at t=11.8 + Δt=0.2= t=12.0.

Compute y(12.0)=2 e^(12/6) [ cos(√23*12/6) - (1/√23) sin(√23*12/6) ].

√23*12/6=√23*2≈9.591.

cos(9.591)=cos(9.591-2π)=cos(9.591-6.283)=cos(3.112)=approx-0.999.

sin(9.591)=sin(3.112)=approx0.044.

So, y(12.0)=2 e^2 [ -0.999 - (0.044 /4.796) ].

Compute the terms:

(0.044)/4.796≈0.00924.

So, inside the brackets: -0.999 -0.00924≈-1.00824.

So, y(12.0)=2*7.389*(-1.00824)=14.778*(-1.00824)=approx-14.89.

So, y(t) at t=12.0 is -14.89, so |u|=14.89.

Hmm, but this suggests that y(t) is decreasing beyond t=11.8, which would require more time, but perhaps that's why.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check t=11.8.

At t=11.8, √23*11.8/6≈4.796*1.967≈9.395.

So, cos(9.395)=cos(3.112)=approx-0.999.

sin(9.395)=sin(3.112)=approx0.044.

So, y(t)=2 e^(11.8/6) [ -0.999 - (0.044/4.796) ].

Compute the term inside:

-0.999 -0.00924≈-1.00824.

Multiply by 2 e^(11.8/6):

e^(11.8/6)=e^(1.9667)=approx7.389.

So, 2*7.389=14.778.

Multiply by -1.00824:14.778*(-1.00824)=approx-14.89.

So, y(t)=approx-14.89.

So, |u|=14.89.

Hmm, so that's higher than 10.

Wait, so perhaps the time when |u|=10 is between t=11.6 and t=11.8.

But in reality, as t increases beyond 11.8, y(t) starts increasing again because the cosine term starts increasing, which might cause y(t) to go negative again and beyond.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here because it's getting too complex. Maybe I should accept that t is approximately 11.7, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use another approach. Let me consider that at t=11.6, |u|=9.08.

At t=11.7, let's compute |u|=?

√23*11.7/6≈4.796*1.95≈9.306.

cos(9.306)=approx-0.951.

sin(9.306)=approx0.307.

So, u(t)=2 e^(11.7/6) [ -0.951 - (0.307/4.796) ] →2*4.4815 [ -0.951 -0.0643 ] →8.963 [ -1.0153 ] →-8.99.

So, |u|=8.99.

Wait, that's lower than 9.08, which is the value at t=11.6.

Wait, that can't be right because t increases, and perhaps u(t) would start increasing again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can look for the time when u(t) reaches 10.

But perhaps I can use a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take a linear approximation between t=11.6 and t=11.8.

At t=11.6, y= -9.08.

At t=11.8, y=-14.89.

Wait, that's a decrease of 5.81 over 0.2 t.

So, the rate is -29.05 per t unit.

Wait, but that would mean that the function is decreasing more rapidly as time increases, which would mean that past t=11.8, y(t) would start increasing again.

Wait, but at t=11.8, y(t)=-14.89.

At t=11.9:

√23*11.9/6≈4.796*1.983≈9.498.

cos(9.498)=approx-0.964.

sin(9.498)=approx0.123.

So, u(t)=2 e^(11.9/6)[ -0.964 - (0.123 /4.796) ].

Compute the terms inside:

-0.964 -0.0256≈-0.964 -0.0256≈-0.9296.

Multiply by 2 e^(11.9/6):

e^(11.9/6)=e^(1.983)=approx7.00.

2*7.00=14.

So, 14*(-0.9296)=approx-12.99.

So, y(t)=approx-12.99, |u|=12.99.

At t=12.0, y(t)=approx-14.89, |u|=14.89.

So, between t=11.8 and t=12.0, y(t) is decreasing from -14.89 to -12.99, then to -14.89.

Hmm, so perhaps the function is not linear, but perhaps it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use a linear approximation between t=11.8 and t=12.0.

At t=11.8, y(t)= -14.89.

At t=12.0, y(t)=-14.89.

Wait, that's the same value, so perhaps the function is flat in this region.

Hmm, perhaps this suggests that the function is not differentiable here, but perhaps I can ignore that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that y(t) is decreasing with a rate of -29 per t unit.

So, from t=11.6 to t=11.8, the change in y(t) is -5.82, which is a rate of -29 per t unit.

So, to reach y(t)=10, starting from y(t)= -9.08 at t=11.6:

We need an increase of 19.08 units.

At a rate of -29 per t unit, we need 19.08 /29 ≈0.655 t units.

So, t=11.6 +0.655≈12.255.

Wait, but that's beyond t=12.0 where y(t)=-14.89.

Hmm, perhaps this suggests that the function is not linear beyond this point, and perhaps the rate of change slows down.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the time when |u(t)|=10 is approximately t=11.7.

But perhaps I should look for a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute y(t) at t=11.7.

At t=11.7, √23*11.7/6≈4.796*1.95≈9.306.

cos(9.306)=approx-0.951.

sin(9.306)=approx0.307.

So, y(t)=2 e^(11.7/6)[ -0.951 - (0.307/4.796) ].

Compute the term inside:

-0.951 -0.00437≈-0.951 -0.00437≈-0.95527.

Multiply by 2 e^(11.7/6):

e^(11.7/6)=e^(1.95)=approx6.77.

2*6.77=13.54.

13.54*(-0.95527)=approx-13.00.

So, y(t)=approx-13.00, |u|=13.00.

Hmm, that's higher than 10. So, perhaps the time when |u|=10 is between t=11.7 and t=11.8.

Wait, perhaps I can compute y(t) at t=11.7 +Δt, say t=11.75.

Compute √23*11.75/6≈4.796*1.958≈9.405.

cos(9.405)=approx-0.967.

sin(9.405)=approx0.215.

So, y(t)=2 e^(11.75/6)[ -0.967 - (0.215/4.796) ].

Compute the term inside:

-0.967 -0.00443≈-0.967 -0.00443≈-0.9672.

Multiply by 2 e^(11.75/6):

e^(11.75/6)=e^(1.7917)≈6.14.

2*6.14=12.2.

12.2*(-0.9672)=approx-12.0.

So, y(t)=approx-12.0, |u|=12.0.

Hmm, that's still higher than 10.

Wait, perhaps I need to go further.

Let me compute y(t) at t=11.65.

Compute √23*11.65/6≈4.796*1.943≈9.347.

cos(9.347)=approx-0.953.

sin(9.347)=approx0.245.

So, y(t)=2 e^(11.65/6)[ -0.953 - (0.245/4.796) ].

Compute the term inside:

-0.953 -0.00477≈-0.953 -0.00477≈-0.95526.

Multiply by 2 e^(11.65/6):

e^(11.65/6)=e^(1.9433)≈6.82.

2*6.82=13.64.

13.64*(-0.95526)=approx-13.25.

Wait, so y(t)=approx-13.25, |u|=13.25.

Hmm, but that can't be right because at t=12.0, y(t)=-14.89, which is lower than -13.25.

Wait, perhaps my calculations are off.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the time when |u|=10 is approximately t=11.8.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can try another approach.

Let me consider that the function y(t) = 2 e^(t/6) [ cos(...) - (1/√23) sin(...) ].

Let me denote cos(theta) - (1/√23) sin(theta) as y'(t).

Then, y'(t) = - (theta/10) approximately, as I found earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I can model y(t) as 2 e^(t/6) * (-theta/10), where theta is the phase.

But perhaps this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that when u(t) is at its maximum, the derivative is zero.

But perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the time when |u|=10 is approximately t=11.8.

But I'm not sure, because from t=11.8, y(t)=-14.89, which is lower than -10, but perhaps it's possible that the function crosses -10 somewhere between t=11.8 and t=12.0.

Wait, but at t=11.8, y(t)=-14.89.

At t=11.9, y(t)=-12.99.

At t=12.0, y(t)=-14.89.

So, perhaps the function goes from -14.89 at t=11.8, increases to -12.99 at t=11.9, then increases further to -14.89 at t=12.0.

Hmm, so perhaps the function doesn't cross -10 in this interval, but perhaps it's a bit more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute y(t) at t=11.85.

Compute √23*11.85/6≈4.799*1.97≈9.64.

cos(9.64)=approx-0.993.

sin(9.64)=approx0.125.

So, y(t)=2 e^(11.85/6)[ -0.993 - (0.125/4.796) ].

Compute the term inside:

-0.993 -0.00253≈-0.993 -0.00253≈-0.99423.

Multiply by 2 e^(11.85/6):

e^(11.85/6)=e^(1.8833)≈6.62.

2*6.62=13.2.

13.2*(-0.99423)=approx-13.13.

So, y(t)=approx-13.13, |u|=13.13.

Hmm, that's still too high.

Wait, perhaps I can accept that the time when |u|=10 is beyond t=11.8, but perhaps the answer is about 12 seconds.

Wait, but perhaps I can find a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take into account that the function y(t) can be expressed as 2 e^(t/6) [ cos(theta) - (1/√23) sin(theta) ].

Let me denote cos(theta) - (1/√23) sin(theta) as A.

Then, the maximum of A is when the derivative is zero, which is when the phase is such that the derivative is zero.

But perhaps it's getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the time when |u|=10 is approximately t=11.8, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is t=12 seconds.

Wait, perhaps I can see when y(t)=10.

Wait, but perhaps I can set up an equation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the time is around 12 seconds.

So, after all this calculation, I think the answer is approximately 12 seconds.
</think>

After analyzing the problem, we find that the solution is approximately 12 seconds.

ANSWER: 12 seconds
