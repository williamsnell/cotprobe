Question:

That modern Africans do not possess any Neandertal DNA indicates that:

Options:

A: Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans must have occurred before Neandertals migrated out of Africa.
B: Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.
C: Neandertals who lived in Africa did not interbreed with anatomically modern humans, but must have followed them when they migrated out of Africa.
D: Interbreeding between anatomically modern humans and Neandertals never occurred.

Alright, so I've got this question about Neandertals and modern Africans. Hmm, I remember that the Neandertals are ancient humans, right? They lived around the 13th century AD, which is way before the modern human ancestors, like the Europeans, came into Africa around the 15th century. So, the question is saying that modern Africans don't possess any Neandertal DNA. That's interesting because I know that gene flow between Neandertals and modern humans has been a point of study.

Wait, the question is asking why that doesn't happen. Let me think. So the options are A to D, each making a statement about gene flow's timing or occurrence.

Option A says that gene flow between Neandertals and modern humans must have occurred before Neandertals migrated out of Africa. But I remember that Neandertals had interbreeding with modern humans long before they left Africa. I think the Neandertals were around for a long time, so their migration probably happened after some of their gene flow with humans. So if the Neandertals had interbreeding with humans before they migrated, then A would be incorrect.

Option B says the gene flow happened after modern humans migrated out of Africa. That makes sense because if Neandertals had to reach humans, they would have had time to interbreed. So after they left Africa, perhaps they followed the modern humans. So B sounds correct, but wait, the question says that modern Africans don't have Neandertal DNA. So if gene flow happened after migration, that would mean Neandertals didn't come back, so their DNA isn't there. So B seems correct.

Option C says Neandertals didn't interbreed with modern humans, but must have followed them when they migrated. Wait, I thought that interbreeding happened long before Neandertals left Africa. So if that's the case, C is wrong because it says no interbreeding, which contradicts what I know.

Option D says interbreeding never happened. That's definitely incorrect because I've read that Neandertals and modern humans have definitely had some interbreeding during the Neolithic period.

So putting it together, the correct answer is B. The gene flow happened after the migration, so Neandertals left before they could mix back in.

The question explores why modern Africans do not possess Neandertal DNA. The correct answer is determined by evaluating the timing of gene flow between Neandertals and modern humans.

- **Option A** is incorrect because Neandertals had long-standing gene flow with modern humans before they migrated. Thus, the gene flow did not occur before migration.
- **Option B** is correct because gene flow between Neandertals and modern humans occurred after the migration of Neandertals out of Africa. This explains why modern Africans do not have Neandertal DNA.
- **Option C** is incorrect because Neandertals did interbreed with modern humans, and the statement contradicts this.
- **Option D** is incorrect because interbreeding between Neandertals and modern humans has occurred.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.**

**Answer:** B
