Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The substitution of Plato for the scholastic Aristotle was hastened by contact with Byzantine scholarship. Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to Plato; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato&â€¦The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value."
Bertrand Russell, British philosopher, History of Western Philosophy, 1946
In what way does this passage best exemplify the view of twentieth-century philosophers and thinkers?

Options:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about philosophy and the passage given. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the question is asking which option best exemplifies the view of twentieth-century philosophers and thinkers. The passage talks about a substitution of Plato for Aristotle, but more importantly, it discusses the humanists and their focus. 

Looking at the passage: It mentions that at the Council of Ferrera, which was a big event combining Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate. The Byzantines thought Plato was better than Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici built the Florentine Academy, which was all about Plato. Then there's a part about humanists, which I think refers to humanists like humanists, maybe more of a medieval or early modern perspective. But the key point is that humanists were too focused on acquiring knowledge without considering its application or value. 

So the passage is about humanists focusing on knowledge acquisition without applying it to real life or understanding. That seems like a modern approach. Now, the options are labeled A to J, each making a different statement about twentieth-century philosophy.

Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Twentieth-century philosophers and thinkers championed the fusion of Eastern and Western traditions. Well, the passage doesn't mention anything about fusion; it's more about humanists. So I don't think this is the best fit.

Option B: The humanists focused solely on acquiring knowledge without application. That's exactly what the passage states. Humanists were busy with knowledge but were too busy to do so in a meaningful way. So this seems like it's the correct answer.

Option C: Nihilists doubted the postulations of those before them. The passage doesn't mention anything about nihilists or their views. It's about humanists and their focus on knowledge acquisition.

Option D: Reject past philosophies and focus on new ways. The passage says humanists focused on knowledge, not rejecting past philosophies. So this is incorrect.

Option E: Emphasis on preserving historic knowledge and reevaluating past philosophies. The passage talks about humanists without any mention of preservation or reevaluation. Also, the focus is on knowledge acquisition, not preservation.

Option F: Resurgence of ancient Greek in Christian theology. The passage doesn't mention this at all. It's more about humanists and their focus on Plato.

Option G: Return to studying ancient philosophers, particularly Plato. The passage doesn't support this; it's about humanists.

Option H: Return to studying ancient philosophers, particularly Plato. Wait, the passage mentions Plato again, but the focus is on humanists, not Plato. So this might not be correct.

Option I: Overwhelmed by changes seek refuge in past. The passage doesn't discuss this; it's about humanists.

Option J: Embraced innovation. The passage doesn't mention innovation as a focus of the twentieth century. It's about knowledge acquisition.

So, after reviewing all the options, the passage best exemplifies that twentieth-century philosophers focused on knowledge acquisition, disregarding its application. So the correct answer should be option B.
</think>

The passage discusses a historical debate in the 15th century regarding the value of Plato versus Aristotle, with humanists focusing solely on knowledge acquisition without application. This aligns with option B, which states that twentieth-century philosophers focused on acquiring knowledge without application or value. 

**Answer: B**
