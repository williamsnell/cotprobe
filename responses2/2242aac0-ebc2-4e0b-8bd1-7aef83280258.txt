Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gold and neutrons. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says: A gold sheet with 0.3mm thickness and 5 cm² area is exposed to a neutron flux of 1e7 neutrons per cm² per second. The capture cross-section for ^197Au is 99 barns. I need to find the number of ^198Au nuclei formed per second. Oh, and I have to neglect any other reactions with gold, which probably simplifies things.

First, I remember that the number of reactions is determined by the number of targets (gold atoms) multiplied by the flux and the cross-section. So the formula should be something like N = σ * N_Au * Φ.

Wait, wait. Let me get the units straight. The cross-section is in barns, which is 1e-24 cm². The flux is given in neutrons per cm² per second. So the unit should work out correctly.

But wait, how do I find the number of gold atoms in the sheet? The sheet's area is 5 cm², thickness 0.3mm. Oh, right, I need to convert everything to the same units.

The sheet's volume is area * thickness. The area is 5 cm², the thickness is 0.3 mm, which is 0.03 cm. So volume is 5 * 0.03 = 0.15 cm³.

The density of gold is given as 19.3 g/cm³. So the mass is density * volume: 19.3 g/cm³ * 0.15 cm³ = 2.895 g.

The atomic weight is 197.2 g/mol. So the number of moles is mass / molar mass. 2.895 / 197.2 ≈ 0.01466 moles.

Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 atoms/mol. So the number of gold atoms is 0.01466 * 6.022e23 ≈ 8.82e21 atoms.

Wait, but wait: the cross-section is 99 barns. One barn is 1e-24 cm². So 99 barns is 99e-24 cm².

Now the flux is 1e7 neutrons/cm²/s. Wait, each neutron can hit a gold nucleus with a probability given by the cross-section. So the number of reactions per second is N = (number of gold atoms) * (flux) * (cross-section).

Wait, but wait, the formula is N = N_Au * Φ * σ. So N_Au is the number of atoms, Φ is the flux (neutrons per cm² per second), and σ is the cross-section per atom (cm²).

So plugging the numbers: N = 8.82e21 * 1e7 * 99e-24.

Wait, let me compute that. Let me calculate each part.

First, 8.82e21 *1e7 is 8.82e28.

Multiply that by 99e-24: 8.82e28 * 99e-24.

Let me compute 8.82 * 99 = approx 873.18. Then 1e28 *1e-24 = 1e4. So total is 873.18e4 = 8.7318e6.

Wait, wait that's 8.73e6. But wait, 8.82e21 * 1e7 = 8.82e28. Multiply by 99e-24:

8.82e28 * 99e-24 = (8.82 * 99) * (1e28 * 1e-24) )= (approx 873.18) * (1e4) )= 8.7318e6.

So about 8.73e6 reactions per second. Each reaction produces one atom of ^198Au, right? Because ^197Au captures a neutron to become ^198Au. So each reaction produces one atom.

So the number of ^198Au nuclei formed per second is 8.73e6. Looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the choices.

Wait, the options are A: ~6e23, B: ~9e8, C: ~3.7e4, D: ~2.5e9, E: ~8e6, F: ~5e22, G: ~4e2, H: ~1e5, I: ~5e7, J: ~7.8e10.

Hmm, so option E is 8e6, which is close to what I got (8.7e6). But wait, let me recheck the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me redo the steps, being more precise.

Number of atoms in the gold sheet:

Volume: 5 cm² * 0.3 mm = 5 * 0.03 cm = 0.15 cm³.

Density: 19.3 g/cm³. So mass = 19.3 * 0.15 = 2.895 grams.

Molar mass: 197.2 g/mol.

Moles: 2.895 / 197.2 = let me compute that.

197.2 * 0.01466 = 2.895. So moles are 0.01466 mol.

Avogadro's number: 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So atoms = 0.01466 * 6.022e23 ≈ let's compute 14.66e-2 *6.022e23.

Wait, 0.01466 is 1.466e-2.

1.466e-2 *6.022e23 = 1.466 *6.022e21.

1.466 *6.022 ≈ 8.82.

So 8.82e21 atoms. That's correct.

Cross-section: 99 barns = 99e-24 cm².

Flux: 1e7 neutrons/cm²/s.

Number of reactions per second: (8.82e21) * (1e7) * (99e-24) = (8.82e21 *1e7) = 8.82e28 * 99e-24.

Compute 8.82e28 * 99e-24:

Multiply 8.82e28 by 99e-24: 8.82 * 99 = 873.18.

Then 1e28 *1e-24 = 1e4.

So 873.18e4 = 8.7318e6.

So approximately 8.73e6, which is 8.73 million.

Looking back at the options, option E is 8e6 per second. So that's the closest.

But wait, I might have made a mistake in unit conversions. Let me check.

Wait, another approach: the number of targets is N = (area * thickness) * (density) / (molar mass) * Avogadro's number.

Wait, alternative way:

Number of atoms = (density * volume) / (molar mass) * Avogadro.

Wait, density is 19.3 g/cm³, volume 0.15 cm³, molar mass 197.2 g/mol.

So (19.3 g/cm³ *0.15 cm³ ) / (197.2 g/mol) ) * 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

Wait, let me compute that.

(19.3 *0.15 )= 2.895 g.

Divide by 197.2: 2.895 /197.2 ≈ 0.01466 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 0.01466 *6.022e23 ≈8.82e21 atoms. Same as before.

So that's correct.

So the number of reactions is 8.82e21 * 1e7 *99e-24.

Wait, 8.82e21 * 1e7 = 8.82e28.

Multiply by 99e-24:

(8.82e28) * (99e-24) = (8.82 *99) * (1e28 *1e-24) = 873.18 *1e4 = 8.7318e6. So 8.73e6.

So the answer should be E: 8e6 per second.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 8e6. So that's the answer.

To determine the number of radioactive \( ^{198}Au \) nuclei formed per second, we use the formula:

\[
N = \sigma \cdot N_{\text{Au}} \cdot \Phi
\]

where:
- \( \sigma = 99 \, \text{barns} = 99 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2 \) (capture cross-section),
- \( N_{\text{Au}} = \frac{\text{number of gold atoms}}{\text{molar mass}} \),
- \( \Phi = 10^7 \, \text{neutrons/cm}^2/\text{s} \) (neutron flux).

### Step 1: Calculate the number of gold atoms
1. **Volume of the gold sheet**:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Area} \times \text{Thickness} = 5 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 0.03 \, \text{cm} = 0.15 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

2. **Mass of the gold sheet**:
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume} = 19.3 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 0.15 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.895 \, \text{g}
   \]

3. **Number of moles of gold**:
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{2.895 \, \text{g}}{197.2 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.01466 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Number of gold atoms**:
   \[
   N_{\text{Au}} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Avogadro's Number} = 0.01466 \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \approx 8.82 \times 10^{21} \, \text{atoms}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of reactions per second
The number of reactions per second is given by:
\[
N = \sigma \cdot N_{\text{Au}} \cdot \Phi
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
N = (99 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2) \cdot (8.82 \times 10^{21} \, \text{atoms}) \cdot (10^7 \, \text{neutrons/cm}^2/\text{s})
\]

First, calculate \( 8.82 \times 10^{21} \cdot 10^7 \):
\[
8.82 \times 10^{21} \cdot 10^7 = 8.82 \times 10^{28}
\]

Next, multiply by \( 99 \times 10^{-24} \):
\[
8.82 \times 10^{28} \cdot 99 \times 10^{-24} = (8.82 \cdot 99) \cdot (10^{28} \cdot 10^{-24}) = 873.18 \cdot 10^4 = 8.7318 \times 10^6
\]

Thus, the number of \( ^{198}Au \) nuclei formed per second is approximately \( 8.73 \times 10^6 \).

### Step 3: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 8.73 \times 10^6 \) is **Option E: \( 8.02 \times 10^6 \)**.
