Okay, so I have this math problem here: subtract 1,709 from 2,396. Let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with subtraction, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I'll write down the numbers to visualize it better. So, it's 2,396 minus 1,709. Hmm, both numbers are four-digit numbers, so I don't have to worry about any borrowing across multiple digits. Let me set it up:

```
  2396
- 1709
```

I'll start from the rightmost digit, which is the units place. Subtracting the units digits: 6 minus 9. Wait, 6 is less than 9, so I'll need to borrow from the tens place. The tens digit is 9, so I'll borrow 1, making it 8. Now, 6 becomes 16. So, 16 minus 9 equals 7. I'll write that down.

Next, the tens place. Now, the tens digit of the top number is 8 (after borrowing), and the bottom number has 0. So, 8 minus 0 is 8. I'll put that down.

Moving to the hundreds place: the top number has 3, the bottom has 7. Oh wait, 3 is less than 7, so I need to borrow again. The thousands place is 2, so I'll borrow 1, making it 1. The hundreds digit becomes 13. So, 13 minus 7 is 6. I'll write that.

Now, the thousands place: originally it was 2, but I borrowed 1, so it's now 1. The bottom number has 1 in the thousands place, so 1 minus 1 is 0. So, the thousands digit is 0, but we can omit it.

Putting it all together, I have 0 (thousands), 6 (hundreds), 8 (tens), and 7 (units). So, the result is 687. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, did I borrow correctly? Starting from the units: 6-9. Can't do that, borrow 1 from the tens. So, units become 16, tens go from 9 to 8. 16-9=7. Then tens: 8-0=8. Hundreds: 3 becomes 13, subtract 7 gives 6. Thousands: 2 becomes 1, subtract 1 gives 0. So yes, 687 is correct.

Looking at the options, option C is 687. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: 687.
