Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where people thought the Holy Mother of Mount Fairy Peach was a goddess. I remember that the name peach is a bit tricky. Let me break it down. The word peach has two parts: "peach" and "e-yo." "Peach" sounds like "peach" in English, which is a fruit, but in Greek, "peach" means "honor" or "pride." Oh wait, no, that's not right. The Greek goddess peach is actually known as the goddess of the peach tree, right? So maybe the 'e-yo' part is a loanword from another language.

I think the "e-yo" might be from the Spanish word "eche" which means "old" or "old," so maybe it's a loanword from another language. So the goddess is a Greek one, the peach, and the 'e-yo' is a loan. 

Now, when did people believe in her? I remember that in ancient China, there was this story about a peach tree that was associated with certain characters. The peach tree was considered sacred, and it was said that the peach was a symbol of good luck. So the people in China thought that the peach tree was a sign of good fortune, hence the name "Holy Mother of Mount Fairy Peach." 

Looking at the options, A is China. B is Silla, which is a little island in Turkey. C is Goguryeo, which is in the Philippines. D is Joseon, which is a historical period in Korea. So the answer should be A, China. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's correct.
