Question:

A commissioner of a sports league was charged with embezzling funds by increasing the amount of his allocated travel expenses without the approval of a majority of the team owners. In accordance with the bylaws of the league's charter, the commissioner was required to obtain the approval of at least half the owners before raising his expense allocation. At trial, the commissioner seeks to testify that his predecessor told him that he had authority under the league's charter to raise his expense allocation. The commissioner's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, to show the precedent set by the predecessor.
B: inadmissible, because it is second-hand information.
C: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: inadmissible, because the league's charter is the best evidence.
E: admissible, as it can prove the commissioner's innocence.
F: inadmissible, because the predecessor's statement cannot be verified.
G: admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.
H: inadmissible, as it is not relevant to the case.
I: admissible as evidence of the routine practice of an organization.
J: admissible, as it gives insight into the league's charter interpretation.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically regarding an exception to hearsay. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a commissioner in a sports league who's charged with embezzling funds by increasing his travel expenses without the team owners' approval. The issue is whether his testimony about his predecessor's authority can be admissible.

First, I remember that hearsay is a defense to a criminal case when the statement is made out of court and not directly related to the matter at hand. There are several exceptions to hearsay, like the best evidence rule, statement of purpose, and the rule of exception.

The question says the commissioner was required to seek the permission of at least half the owners for raising his expenses. The bylaws require that. So the issue is about whether the testimony about the predecessor's authority is admissible.

Option A says it's admissible to show the precedent set by the predecessor. I think that's about when someone's statement serves as a precedent for a course of action. But I'm not sure if that's an exception to hearsay. I think statement of purpose is about when someone is repeating a statement and citing its source, which might relate here since the predecessor's statement is about permission.

Option B is inadmissible because it's second-hand info. But wait, the predecessor's statement is about the requirement for the commissioner to get permission. The initial statement's basis is the bylaws, not the testimony of the predecessor. I think statement of purpose is about citing a statement, which is a primary source, so that might be okay.

Option C says the testimony is inadmissible because it's hearsay not within an exception. But wait, this testimony is about the predecessor's authority. Since the bylaws require the predecessor's consent, the testimony is about the proper procedure. But the issue is about the credibility of the statement. The predecessor's statement is a statement of fact, but it's not hearsay because it doesn't present a defense. So maybe this testimony is not hearsay at all.

Wait, but option B's reasoning is about it being second-hand. The statement is from the predecessor, which is a statement of fact, and it's not the same as the initial statement. So I think that's not second-hand info. So maybe option B is incorrect.

Option D says it's inadmissible because the charter is the best evidence. But this testimony is not about the charter. It's about the predecessor's authority. So unless the predecessor's statement is a statement of purpose, which it is, but the statement is about a procedural requirement, not about the commissioner's actions. So maybe D is not the issue.

Option E: admissible as evidence of routine practice. That would be if the statement was made in the course of a routine situation, but I'm not sure if the court would accept that as an exception. I think statement of purpose is more about citing a source, not routine practice.

Option F: inadmissible because the predecessor's statement can't be verified. But the question is about the admissibility of the testimony, not its veracity. If the predecessor's statement is a factual statement, it's verifiable, so F is not the issue.

Option G: admissible to show the commissioner lacked intent. That's about criminal intent, which this testimony doesn't address. So G is not the answer.

Option H: inadmissible as not relevant. But this testimony is about the proper permission, which the court is likely to find relevant. Unless the court can't find it, but I think H is not correct.

Option I: admissible as evidence of routine practice. I think this is similar to E; it's about the practice of the organization, which is okay under the best evidence rule, but I'm not sure if that's the exception here.

Option J: admissible as giving insight into the charter. That's about the purpose, but again, the issue is about the testimony's admissibility.

Back to the main issue: whether the testimony is hearsay. The statement is about the predecessor's authority, which is a requirement, not an assertion of fact. So this is not hearsay. However, option A says it's admissible to show the precedent. I think statement of purpose is about citing a source, which is usually hearsay but in this case, it's about a procedural requirement. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, statement of purpose is hearsay because it's a statement made out of court and relates to the matter at issue. Unless it's a primary source, which it is. But wait, statement of purpose is a hearsay exception that's used when a party is repeating a statement that was made in court, citing the source. So if the testimony is about the predecessor's authority without any prior statement, perhaps it's not hearsay.

I think the proper rule is that the testimony is not hearsay because it's not a statement of fact. So it's not hearsay, so it's admissible. But then option A is about showing the precedent. So maybe option A is correct.

Wait, but isn't the statement about the requirement by the bylaws, not the actual authority? Or is the testimony about the predecessor's authority, which is a fact that could have been based on the bylaw? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the testimony is hearsay because it's an assertion of a fact that provides a defense to an action, but that's not true. Because the testimony is about the requirement to obtain permission, not about whether the commissioner's expenses were overcharged.

Wait, the issue is about the testimony about the predecessor's authority. The court is trying to show that the commissioner's statement is true. If the court finds that the predecessor's statement is true, then the testimony is admissible. But if the testimony is hearsay, then it's inadmissible.

But the testimony is about the predecessor's authorization. That's a factual statement, not a hearsay statement. So it's not hearsay, so it's admissible. But then why is there an option A? Because the testimony shows the precedent, which would be a factual statement, not hearsay. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Wait, statement of purpose is hearsay because it's a statement made out of court and relates to the issue. Statement of purpose is an exception for repeating a statement. So if the testimony is about the predecessor's authority, and the testimony is a reiteration of the bylaw's requirement, then it's not hearsay. But if the court is trying to prove that the predecessor's statement was accurate, then the statement of purpose would be used as an exception. But the testimony itself is not hearsay.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. The question is about whether the testimony is admissible. The testimony in question is about the predecessor's authority. The issue is whether that authority was obtained.

The bylaws require that the commissioner must have the necessary majority approval. The testimony is about the predecessor's authority, which is the basis for that majority. So the court is trying to show that the predecessor's statement was true.

In that case, the statement is not hearsay because it's a factual statement. So the testimony is admissible as a statement of fact, not hearsay.

So the correct option would be A: admissible, to show the precedent set by the predecessor. Wait, no, because the testimony is about the predecessor's authorization, not about the previous executive's conduct. Or is it about the precedent in the proper procedure?

Wait, no, the statement is about the predecessor's authorization, which is the basis for the current action. So the court is trying to show that the predecessor's statement was true, which is a factual statement. So the testimony is admissible because it's a statement of fact, not hearsay.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the testimony is hearsay because it's about the predecessor's authority, which is a fact that the court is trying to prove. Therefore, it must be admissible unless it's hearsay.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is A. Because it's showing the precedent, but since it's not hearsay, that's an exception to the statement of purpose rule. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Another approach. The issue is whether the testimony about the predecessor's authority is admissible. The testimony is about the reason for the commissioner's increase in expenses.

So the question is whether the testimony is hearsay. The statement is not an assertion of a fact that could be used to prove a defense to a criminal case. So it's not hearsay. Therefore, it's admissible as a statement of fact.

But looking at the options, A is admissible to show the precedent. So if the court wants to prove that the predecessor's statement was correct, then it can do so by citing the statement as precedent. But wait, that's statement of purpose, which requires a prior statement, not the same as the statement being offered.

Wait, statement of purpose is when you repeat a statement that you have already made in court, citing its source. But the testimony here is about the predecessor's authorization, not about the previous executive's actions.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the testimony is hearsay because it's about the previous executive's authority, which is a matter that could be considered for a criminal case. So if the court is considering whether the previous executive's statement was true, then the testimony is hearsay because it's a statement being offered to prove a fact that could be used to prove a defense.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Because the court is trying to prove that the previous executive's statement was true. So the testimony is a statement of fact, not an out-of-court statement. So it's not hearsay.

I'm getting myself more confused. Let's think about the options again.

Option A says it's admissible to show the precedent. That's about using a statement to show that someone else did it. I think that's about statement of purpose, where you cite a statement.

Option B says it's inadmissible because it's second-hand. But the predecessor's statement is about a procedural requirement, not a statement that's been previously made. So it's not second-hand.

Option C says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within an exception. But since it's a statement of fact and not hearsay, it's admissible.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the testimony. So the testimony is about the previous executive's authority, which is a statement of fact. So it's not hearsay. So the testimony is admissible.

But then, why is option A an option? Because if it's admissible to show the precedent, that's a statement of purpose, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the testimony is hearsay because it's about a previous executive's authority, which could be used to prove a defense. So the court would have to consider whether it's hearsay.

Wait, but the court is trying to show that the previous executive's statement was true. So the testimony is not hearsay because it's a statement of fact. So why is option A an option? Because it's admissible, perhaps as a statement of fact, not hearsay.

Looking back, the answer options: A is admissible to show the precedent. That's about citing a statement, which is a statement of purpose. But the testimony in this case is about the previous executive's authorization, not about a previous statement.

Ah! Wait, the question is about whether the testimony is admissible. The testimony is about the previous executive's authority, which is a statement of fact. So it's not hearsay, and the court can admit it.

So the correct answer would be A or perhaps another option.

Wait, but another angle: the testimony is about the previous executive's authority, which is a statement that's not hearsay. So the testimony is admissible.

But looking at the options, option C says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within an exception. But that's not correct because the testimony isn't hearsay.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A: admissible, to show the precedent set by the predecessor.

Wait, no, because the testimony is about the predecessor's authorization, which is a statement of fact, not about the previous executive's actions. So perhaps the testimony is not hearsay, but the option A is about showing the precedent.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall: when a court seeks to show the precedent of a prior decision, they can use the statement of purpose rule. So if someone's previous statement has been made, they can cite that as a statement of purpose. But in this case, the testimony is about the predecessor's authority, not about their previous actions. So maybe the testimony is not hearsay, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the testimony is about the predecessor's authorization, which is a procedural requirement. The court is trying to prove that the previous executive's statement was true. So perhaps the court can use the statement of purpose rule (stating that a prior statement is sufficient) to admit the testimony.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the statement is not hearsay, so it's admissible.

Wait, looking at the options again, A is admissible to show the precedent. So if the court uses the testimony as a statement of purpose, it's admissible. But is that the best way to present it?

I think the correct answer is A because if the court wants to show that the previous executive was correct, they can cite the statement of purpose, citing their own statement as the source. But in this case, the statement is about the predecessor's authorization, not about a prior executive.

Wait, perhaps the court can use the statement of purpose to show that the previous statement (from the predecessor) was correct, citing the bylaws and the previous statement as the source. So the testimony would be admissible as a statement of purpose, which is an exception.

But the options don't mention statement of purpose. Option A is statement of purpose as a way to show precedent. So perhaps the court would admit it as a statement of purpose, which is an exception. So the testimony is admissible.

Wait, but that's confusing because the testimony is about the predecessor's authorization, not the previous executive's actions. So perhaps the court doesn't need to use a statement of purpose here.

I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the testimony is not hearsay, so it's admissible. Looking at the options, option C says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within an exception. No, that's not correct because it's not hearsay.

So the correct answer must be one of A, B, D, E, F, G, H, J.

If the testimony is admissible, then the options that would be correct are A, C, or maybe others.

Wait, another point: the statement is about the predecessor's authority, which is a procedural requirement. The court is trying to prove that this was done correctly. So perhaps the testimony is hearsay because it's making a statement about the previous executive that could be used to prove a defense.

Wait, but the bylaws require the previous executive's approval. So the testimony is about the reason for increasing expenses, not about the previous executive's actions. So the court isn't using the testimony to prove that the previous executive did something wrong, but rather that the previous executive's authorization was correct.

Thus, the testimony is not hearsay, so it's admissible.

But according to the options, only option A says it's admissible to show the precedent. So if the court can show that the previous executive's statement was true, then the testimony is admissible.

So perhaps the answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe the testimony is not hearsay because it's a factual statement, and thus admissible.

Wait, option C is inadmissible because it's not relevant. But the testimony is about the previous executive's authorization, which is a valid part of the situation.

I think the correct answer is A: admissible, to show the precedent set by the predecessor.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: the testimony is about the previous executive's authorization, which is a procedural requirement. If the court finds that the previous executive's authorization was incorrect, then the testimony could be admissible to show that.

But according to the options, the testimony is admissible to show the precedent. So perhaps the court uses the testimony as a statement of purpose, citing the previous executive's statement as the source.

But the actual issue is whether the testimony is hearsay. Since it's not hearsay, it's admissible.

Wait, but I'm going in circles. I think the correct answer is A because the testimony is admissible to show the precedent.

Alternatively, maybe the testimony is not admissible because it's hearsay. But I don't think so, because it's a factual statement.

So, going back to the options, A is admissible to show the precedent. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a testimony about the predecessor's authority within the sports league's bylaws, which require the commissioner to seek prior approval. The key issue is whether the testimony is hearsay and admissible.

The testimony in question is about the predecessor's authority to increase expenses, which is a procedural requirement rather than a factual assertion. Since the statement is not an out-of-court assertion of fact and does not relate to the matter at issue, it is not hearsay. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

Option A states that the testimony is admissible to show the precedent set by the predecessor. While this option suggests using the statement of purpose exception, it might not be the best approach in this case. The testimony is about a procedural requirement, not a prior executive's actions. However, the court could use the statement of purpose rule to admit it, as it can cite the predecessor's statement as evidence of authority.

Option C, stating that the testimony is inadmissible as hearsay not within an exception, is incorrect because the testimony is not hearsay. Option D, asserting it is inadmissible as a statement of purpose, is also incorrect because the statement of purpose exception applies to repeating a statement, not to the testimony itself.

Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
