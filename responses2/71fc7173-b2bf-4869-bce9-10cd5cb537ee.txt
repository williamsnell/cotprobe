Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the percentage of Russian people who believe that homos might be accepted by society. The question is from 2019, and I need to choose the correct option among A to J.

First, I remember that this is a sensitive topic, and I should be careful to provide accurate information. I think the question is about the prevalence of views on homophobia in 2019 in Russia.

I recall that in many countries, including Russia, there's been a push towards inclusivity and acceptance of various sexual orientations. But I also remember hearing that some groups, like homophobes, might still feel that way, even though the trend is generally towards acceptance.

Looking at the options, the choices are A to J, with various percentages. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A is 94%, which seems extremely high. I don't think that's correct because I don't recall any country where so many people accept homos. Maybe in some places, but Russia's situation is different.

Option B is 54%, which is a common number in some contexts. But I'm not sure if that's about homophobia or just a general acceptance rate.

Option C is 64%, which is higher than B but lower than A. Again, I'm not certain about this number.

Option D is 4%, which seems low. I don't think a large percentage of the population would hold such a strong view, but maybe there's a subgroup.

Option E is 84%, which is high again. That doesn't sound right for homophobia.

Option F is 14%, which is lower. I don't know if that's too low or just another number.

Option G is 74%, which is close to A's 94% but not the same. Maybe it's a different statistic.

Option H is 24%, which is another low number.

Option I is 44%, which is in the middle range.

Option J is 34%, which is still lower than I.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. I think I remember that in Russia, a significant portion of the population supports homophobia. But I'm not sure of the exact number. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the proportion of people who are against it, not for it.

Wait, the question is about "people from Russia say homos should be accepted by society." So it's about the majority supporting acceptance.

I think I've read somewhere that in many countries, including Russia, homophobia is facing increasing criticism. So a significant number might say that homos should be accepted.

Looking again, I think I've read that in 2019, the percentage was around 74%. That's option G. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 94%, but that seems too high.

Wait, another angle: the question mentions the last character of the answer should be the letter chosen. So if the correct answer is G (74%), the last letter would be 'G' which matches the letter. But I'm not certain about the exact number.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 94%, which would be option A. But I don't think so because 94% of people accepting homos seems too high.

I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the sources. I think in some contexts, the percentage might be around 70-80%. So options G is 74%, which is plausible.

Alternatively, I might have read that about 34% of the population supports homophobia in Russia, but that's not the case here because the question is about those who accept it. So if 34% support it, the correct answer would be J:34%. But that doesn't fit because the question is about acceptance.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the data. Let me think again. I think in 2019, a significant portion of Russian people, particularly the younger generation and some older ones, started to see more acceptance. So perhaps 94% is too high, and 74% is more accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of people who do not accept homos. I've heard that in Russia, around 24% of the population doesn't accept homos. So the percentage that does accept might be higher. If 24% don't, then 76% do. But the options don't have 76%. The closest is option G, 74%, which is close.

So maybe the correct answer is G:74%.
</think>

The correct answer is G:74%. This is because the question asks about the percentage of people who believe homos should be accepted, and 74% aligns with the proportion of Russian individuals who support acceptance, given that around 24% do not. The other options either represent high percentages (94%) that seem implausible or lower numbers that don't fit the context. 

Answer: G
