Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that a sound with a frequency of 1,000 cycles per second is produced when the air temperature is 15°C. They're asking for the wavelength of this sound. Hmm, I remember that wavelength and frequency are related through the speed of sound. Oh right, the formula is wavelength equals speed divided by frequency. So, λ = v/f.

Wait, but what's the speed of sound at 15°C? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think it's a temperature-dependent speed. I recall that at 0°C (which is 273 K), the speed of sound in air is approximately 331 m/s. But that's at 0°C, not 15. I need to find the speed at 15°C. How do I do that?

I think the speed of sound increases with temperature. The formula I remember is v = 331 + (0.6 * T), where T is in degrees Celsius. Let me plug in 15 for T. So 0.6 times 15 is 9. Adding that to 331 gives 340 m/s. Okay, that makes sense. So the speed of sound at 15°C is 340 m/s.

Now, the frequency is given as 1000 cycles per second. So f is 1000 Hz. Using the formula λ = v/f, that would be 340 m / 1000 Hz. Let's compute that: 340 divided by 1000 is 0.34 meters. But wait, the options are given in feet, not meters. Oh right, I need to convert meters to feet. I remember that 1 meter is approximately 3.28084 feet. So 0.34 meters times 3.28084.

Let me do that calculation. 0.34 * 3.28084. Let's break that down. 0.3 * 3.28084 is 0.984252, and 0.04 * 3.28084 is 0.1312336. Adding those together gives 0.984252 + 0.1312336 = approximately 1.1154856 feet. So about 1.115 feet per cycle.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are in feet per cycle. So the options are A:1.40, B:0.98, C:1.20, D:1.25, etc., up to J:1.12.

Wait, my calculation came up to about 1.115, which is roughly 1.12 feet. So the closest option would be J:1.12 ft/cycle. But wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me double-check the speed of sound at 15°C. I used 340 m/s, but I think the exact value might be a bit different. Wait, wait, I think the formula is v = 331 + 0.6*T. So 0.6 *15 =9, 331+9=340 m/s. That's correct.

So using 340 m/s, 340 /1000 = 0.34 m. 0.34 m is about 1.116 feet. So closest to option J, which is 1.12 ft/cycle.

But wait, looking again, option C is 1.20 ft/cycle—no, that's higher. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine the wavelength of a sound with a frequency of 1,000 cycles per second at an air temperature of 15°C, we use the relationship between wavelength, speed of sound, and frequency: 

\[
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the speed of sound at 15°C
The speed of sound in air increases with temperature and can be approximated by the formula:

\[
v = 331 + (0.6 \times T)
\]

where \( T \) is the temperature in degrees Celsius. Substituting \( T = 15 \):

\[
v = 331 + (0.6 \times 15) = 331 + 9 = 340 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the wavelength
The frequency \( f \) is given as 1,000 Hz. Using the formula for wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{340}{1000} = 0.34 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Convert meters to feet
Since the options are given in feet, we convert meters to feet using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{m} = 3.28084 \, \text{ft} \):

\[
0.34 \, \text{m} \times 3.28084 \, \text{ft/m} \approx 1.115 \, \text{ft}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated wavelength of approximately 1.115 ft is closest to option J: 1.12 ft/cycle.
