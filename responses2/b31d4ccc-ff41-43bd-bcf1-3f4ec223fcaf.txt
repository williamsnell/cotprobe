Okay, so I've got this question about astrological signs and someone born on Halloween. Hmm, I remember that each astrological sign corresponds to a specific zodiac sign, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dates. Let me think. 

Halloween is October 31st, right? So I need to figure out what sign someone born on that day would have. I think the signs are determined by the time of year and the zodiac constellations they're associated with. 

The signs go from Aries to Capricorn. Aries is the first sign, so that's around June to July. Libra is from August to September. Scorpio is October, so Scorpio would be the sign born around October. Virgo is November, Capricorn December, Gemini January, etc. 

Wait, but Capricorn is December, right? So if someone's born on October 31, they'd be in Scorpio, which is the second sign of October. Let me double-check. Scorpio is from October 24 to November 22, so yes, someone born on October 31 would be in Scorpio. So the answer should be B: Scorpio.

The correct answer is Scorpio, as Halloween falls in October, and Scorpio is the sign born in October.

Answer: B
