Okay, so I've got this question about Singer's view on whether it's wrong to painlessly kill an animal. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that Singer's work is about animal rights. Singer is a philosopher who wrote about this. The question is about painlessly killing animals. I think painlessly killing would mean killing without any pain, maybe just slicing it with a knife. 

I recall that Singer discussed this issue in his book "The Right to Life." He talked about the ethical implications of killing animals. I think he might have said that it's not always wrong to kill animals, especially when they're not human. But wait, he might have also made some exceptions.

So, the options are about when it's wrong to painlessly kill an animal. Let me look at the options:

A: that is irrelevant as it is never wrong to painlessly kill an animal. That seems off because Singer definitely discussed this. He must have said it's not always wrong.

B: that is only wrong if the animal is a pet. I'm not sure. Maybe only pets have certain ethical concerns? But I think he was more broad about it, not just pets.

C: that is entirely dependent on the species of the animal. I'm not sure about this. Maybe he thought it's more about the nature of the animal, not just its species.

D: that is dependent on the cultural norms of a society. That makes sense. Different cultures have different perspectives. So, in some societies, it's not wrong to kill animals, but in others, it might be.

E: that is ethically unimportant. No, that's not right. Singer definitely touched on this.

F: that is only applicable to endangered species. I don't think so. He probably made it a broader point about animal rights, not just endangered species.

G: to which we need give no precise answer. That's not correct. There's a straightforward answer.

H: that cannot be answered, vaguely or precisely. I think he could have, but maybe the question is implying he couldn't answer it precisely without more info.

I: to which we need to give a precise answer. So that's correct in that sense.

J: that should be answered on a case-by-case basis. I don't think so; he probably had a general stance.

Putting it together, Singer likely said it's not always wrong to painlessly kill animals, but it depends on cultural context. So the correct answer should be D or I. Wait, the options are A to J. The question is about when it's wrong to painlessly kill. So Singer's view is that it's dependent on cultural norms. So I think the answer is D: that is dependent on the cultural norms of a society. Wait, but the options are B, D, etc.

Wait, the options are:

B: only wrong if animal is a pet.

D: depends on cultural norms.

So based on what I remember, Singer did not restrict killing animals without pain unless they were pets. He emphasized that painless killing is a form of human interference, which is unethical. But cultural context matters. So D is correct.

The correct answer is D: that is dependent on the cultural norms of a society.

Answer: D
