Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Asian and Asian-American clients compared to Anglo clients. The question is asking which statement the experts point out as true when comparing these groups. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to recall what I know about Asian, Asian-American, and Anglo clients in therapy. I remember that the Asian American community in the US has a history of integrating into a predominantly Asian society, which can influence therapy practices. It's often said that Asian and Asian-American clients tend to have a more grounded approach, which I think means they focus on the present rather than the future or the past.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: tend to prefer a less directive therapeutic approach.
I think directive approaches are more about giving clear instructions towards the end goal. If Asian-American clients are grounded, they probably don't need as much directive approach because they're focused on the present. So this might be a correct answer.

Option B: are grounded more in the here-and-now than in the past or the future.
This aligns with what I was thinking about the grounding approach. Grounded therapy often emphasizes current awareness, so B seems correct.

Option C: are likely to express emotional problems as verbal symptoms.
Hmm. I'm not as sure about this. I thought verbal symptoms might be more common, but I'm not certain. Maybe this is incorrect.

Option D: respond better when goal-setting is immediate.
If goal-setting is immediate, maybe they can act faster. But I'm not sure how this relates to the grounding approach. Maybe they're better at setting immediate goals, but I'm not certain.

Option E: are grounded more in the past or the future than in the here-and-now.
No, because if they're grounded, they focus on the present, not future or past. So E is the opposite of what should be true.

Option F: are likely to express emotional problems as somatic symptoms.
Somatic symptoms relate to physical symptoms, not emotional. So this might not be correct.

Option G: tend to prefer group therapy over individual therapy.
I don't think this is accurate. Individual therapy is often preferred for clients who need more personalized attention, especially if they're grounded.

Option H: respond better when goal-setting is delayed.
Wait, if goal-setting is delayed, maybe they can't act until they have a plan. But I'm not sure if this is a correct point about their approach. Maybe this is incorrect.

Option I: (Not in the list, but just a thought) Perhaps some Asian clients might have different methods, but the options given don't include that.

So, going back. The question is about what the experts point out. They often highlight that Asian and Asian-American clients are grounded, meaning they focus on the present. So options A and B seem correct.

Wait, but the question is about comparing their approach to Anglo clients. So, which statement is true about their approach?

Option A says they tend to prefer a less directive approach. Directive could mean giving clear directions towards the end goal. If they're grounded, they might not need such a directive approach because they focus on the present. So A could be correct.

Option B says they're grounded more in the here-and-now. That's also correct. Grounded approaches emphasize current awareness, so B is correct.

Looking at the options, the question is asking which one is pointed out. So both A and B seem correct statements. Wait, but the options are A to F, each as a separate choice, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which statement is made by the experts. So which statement is correct.

Wait, I think I read somewhere that Asian and Asian-American clients are grounded, which means they're less directive. So option A would be correct because they'd prefer a less directive approach. But wait, option B also sounds correct because being grounded means they focus on present issues, which relates to grounding being more present-oriented.

But wait, the question is to choose which option is pointed out. So perhaps both A and B could be correct, but I have to see which one is an option.

Wait, the options are all separate. So the question is which statement is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question is comparing Asian and Asian-American clients to Anglo clients. The experts point out that they tend to prefer a less directive approach and are grounded, which means they focus on the present, not future or past.

So option A says they prefer less directive. Option B says they are grounded more in the here-and-now.

Both statements are correct, but the question is which option is correct. But wait, perhaps the options are mutually exclusive. Let me read the options again.

Looking at the options, option A is correct because grounded clients prefer less directive approaches, which is a common trait.

Option B says grounded clients are grounded more in the here-and-now, which is accurate.

So both A and B are correct statements. But the question is a single-answer multiple-choice.

Wait, no. The options are letters A to F, each representing a statement. So I have to pick the correct one. But I'm a bit confused because both A and B seem correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again. The question is phrased as "the experts frequently point out that the former: [statement]".

So the wording suggests that the former group (Asian or Asian-American) clients are pointed out as having a certain trait. So which trait is correct.

Option A: prefer less directive. That's correct.

Option B: grounded more in present. Correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps the options are not entirely accurate. Alternatively, maybe one of the options is incorrect.

Wait, another angle: the question might be about which trait the Asian clients have compared to Anglo. So if the question is about what the Asian clients tend to do, which is grounded approach.

Option B says they're grounded more in the here-and-now. That's correct.

Option A says they prefer less directive approach. That's correct too.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is which statement the experts point out. So perhaps both A and B are correct, but in the given options, only one is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the actual points each option is making. The question is about what the experts point out. So which statement is correct.

I think option B is correct because grounded approach focuses on the present. Option A says they prefer less directive, which is correct because grounded clients don't need to set future goals. So both statements are correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about which statement is correct. So if both A and B are correct, but the options don't allow selecting multiple, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing which is correct.

Wait, the question is a single-choice question where only one option is correct. So perhaps I need to determine which of the statements is correct.

Another thought: in the Asian approach, they're grounded, which means they focus on the present, not past or future. So option E is the opposite, but it's not correct because E says grounded more in past or future, which is incorrect.

Option B says grounded more in the here-and-now, which is correct because grounded therapy is about current awareness.

Option A says they prefer less directive approaches. That's correct because grounded approaches don't require setting future goals, thus making them less directive.

Wait, but perhaps the question is which statement the experts point out. So both A and B are correct, but perhaps the question is about the most accurate statement.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is the correct answer because grounded approaches are grounded more in the present.

Alternatively, maybe option A is incorrect because less directive approaches might not be the same as grounded.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each option is saying. 

Option A: prefer less directive approach. This is correct because grounded clients don't set future goals. They focus on the present, which implies a less directive approach.

Option B: grounded more in the here-and-now. This is correct because grounded approaches emphasize current awareness.

So both A and B are correct statements. But in the options given, each is a separate choice. So perhaps the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which trait the Asian clients exhibit. So both A and B are correct statements, but maybe the question is only pointing out one of them.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of the experts' understanding. I think that Asian clients are more grounded and prefer less directive approaches because they're focused on the present. So both A and B are correct, but perhaps the question is about the most accurate statement.

Wait, but the options are all separate. So perhaps the correct answer is either A or B. But in reality, I think both A and B are correct. However, looking at the options, only one can be selected.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the preferred approach. Since the question is, "the experts point out that the former...", which option is this.

Wait, maybe the point is that Asian clients are grounded, meaning they focus on the present, so option B is correct. Also, option A says they prefer less directive approach, which is a correct statement.

Wait, but perhaps the question is implying that the correct answer is option B. Because grounded clients focus more on present issues, which would make option B correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both A and B, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: in the expert's eyes, which of these is true.

Option B: grounded clients are grounded more in the here-and-now. That's correct.

Option A: prefer less directive approaches. Correct.

So perhaps both are correct, but I have to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which trait the Asian clients are known to exhibit. So, the question is, which statement is correct.

I think both A and B are correct statements. But since in the options, each is a separate letter, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most accurate statement. For example, option B seems more directly related to the concept of grounding.

Wait, another angle: the expert might say that Asian clients are grounded, which is option B. Option A is about less directive approaches, which is correct but perhaps more of a psychological approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the most accurate statement. Both are correct, but perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, as grounded clients are more focused on present issues.

Another thought: some Asian clients may use a more grounded approach, so they are grounded in the here-and-now.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B.
</think>

The question asks which statement the experts point out about Asian and Asian-American clients compared to Anglo clients. The analysis focuses on understanding the grounding approach, which emphasizes current awareness rather than future or past goals. 

- **Option A**: Correct, as grounded clients prefer less directive approaches, focusing on the present.
- **Option B**: Correct, as grounded clients are grounded more in the here-and-now, aligning with their approach.

Both A and B are accurate statements, but since the question is a single-answer multiple-choice, the most directly relevant statement is **Option B**, as grounding is a core aspect of their approach.

ANSWER: B
