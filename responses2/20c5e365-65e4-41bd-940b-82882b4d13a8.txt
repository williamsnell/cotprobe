Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an electron in a rectangular well. Hmm, I remember that rectangular wells are like potential wells in quantum mechanics, right? The well has a certain depth, and the electron is in a specific energy level.

The problem says the well has a depth of 20.0 eV. Oh wait, I think depth refers to the potential energy barrier. So the bottom of the well is at zero potential, and the barrier is 20 eV high. Then it says the lowest energy level is 3.00 eV above the bottom. So the energy of the lowest level is 3 eV.

Wait, but the well depth is 20 eV, and the energy is only 3 eV. That must mean that the electron is in a bound state where its energy is less than the well depth. Because if the energy is higher than the potential (well depth), the electron would be in a scattering state, not bound. So it's definitely a bound state here.

Now, for quantum wells, I think the energy levels depend on the width of the well. The question is asking for the width of the well. So I need to relate the energy level to the width.

I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is something like E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²), where n is the quantum number, h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the width of the well.

Wait, but wait! The problem says the potential depth is 20 eV, so the well is 20 eV high. The electron's energy is 3 eV. But wait, in an infinite potential well, the energy levels are from zero upwards. So the 3 eV corresponds to the ground state (n=1), because if the well were deeper than the electron's energy, the electron couldn't be in a bound state. Wait, but the well depth is 20 eV, so the bottom is at 0, and the barrier is 20 eV. But the electron's energy is 3 eV, which is way below 20, so it's definitely bound.

So the ground state would be E = 3 eV.

So the formula for the ground state (n=1) is E₁ = (h²)/(8 m L²), maybe. Or wait, the correct formula is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2 m L²), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, sometimes written that way. Wait, I think the standard formula is E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²), but sometimes with h replaced by ħ (which is h/(2π)).

Wait, maybe I should write the formula correctly. The energy levels in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2 m L²), where n is an integer (1,2,3...). So E_n is proportional to n squared, and inversely proportional to L squared.

So first, let's plug in the values. E₁ is 3 eV. Let's compute (n=1) E₁ = (1²) * (π² ħ²) / (2 m L²) = (π² ħ²) / (2 m L²).

We can rearrange this to solve for L. So L = sqrt( (π² ħ²) / (2 m E₁ ) )

Wait, yes. So L squared is (π² ħ²) / (2 m E₁), so L is sqrt( (π² ħ²) / (2 m E₁) ).

But wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Let me be careful. The formula is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2 m L²). So rearranged, L² = (n² π² ħ²) / (2 m E_n). Since n=1, L² = (π² ħ²) / (2 m E_n). So L is sqrt( (π² ħ²) / (2 m E_n) )

Wait, but E is in joules, I think. Oh, but I need to convert eV to joules. So 3 eV is 3 * 1.602e-19 joules.

Let me get the constants right. Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is about 1.054e-34 J·s.

The mass of the electron is about 9.109e-31 kg.

So putting it all together: L = sqrt( (π² ħ²) / (2 m E) )

Let me compute that.

First, compute the numerator: π² ħ².

π is approximately 3.1416, so π² is about 9.8696.

ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Squared, that's (1.0545718e-34)^2. Let me compute that numerically.

1.0545718e-34 squared is about (approx) 1.112e-68 (since (1.05)^2 is about 1.1025, but more accurately, 1.0545^2 is approximately 1.112). So 1.112e-68 J² s².

Multiply that by π² (9.8696): 1.112e-68 * 9.8696 ≈ 1.096e-67 J² s².

The denominator is 2 m E. So m is 9.109e-31 kg, E is 3 eV. Let me convert 3 eV to joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 3 eV is 4.806e-19 J.

So denominator is 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 4.806e-19 J.

Compute that: 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30. Multiply by 4.806e-19: 1.8218e-30 * 4.806e-19 = let me compute 1.8218 *4.806 is about 8.76. So 8.76e-49 kg·m²/s²? Wait, better to compute (1.8218e-30) * (4.806e-19) )= 1.8218 *4.806 = approx 8.76, then 1e-30 *1e-19 = 1e-49. So denominator is approx 8.76e-49.

So L² = numerator / denominator = (1.096e-67) / (8.76e-49) = approx (1.096 /8.76) * 1e-67+49 = (0.125) *1e-18.

Wait, (1.096/8.76) is approximately 0.125. So L² = 0.125e-18 = 1.25e-19 m².

Wait, is that right? Because 1e-67 divided by 1e-49 is 1e-18. So L squared is 0.125e-18 m², which is 1.25e-19 m².

So L is sqrt(1.25e-19) meters. Let me compute that. The square root of 1.25e-19 is sqrt(1.25)*1e-9.5.

Wait what? Wait, sqrt(1.25) is about 1.118. And 1e-19 is (1e-9.5)^2. Because 1e-9.5 is 3.16e-10, since 1e-10 is 1e-10, 1e-5 is 1e-5, so 1e-9.5 is 1e-9 * sqrt(1e-0.5) = 1e-9 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.16e-10.

So sqrt(1.25e-19) = sqrt(1.25) * sqrt(1e-19) )= 1.118 * 1e-9.5.

Wait, 1e-9.5 is 1e-9 * 1e-0.5 = 1e-9 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.16e-10 m.

So 1.118 *3.16e-10 m = approximately 3.54e-10 meters, which is 0.354e-9 meters, or 0.354 nm.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because I think I might have messed up a step.

Wait, let me compute L² again. Numerator is (π² ħ²) = (9.87) * (1.112e-68) ≈ 10.96e-67 J² s².

Denominator is 2 m E = 2 *9.109e-31 kg *4.806e-19 J.

9.109e-31 *4.806e-19 = 9.109 *4.806 = about 43.8, then 1e-31*1e-19 = 1e-50. So 43.8e-50. Multiply by 2 gives 87.6e-50.

So L² is numerator (10.96e-67) / denominator (87.6e-50) = (10.96/87.6) * 1e(-67+50) )= (0.125) *1e-17.

Ah, wait, wait, did I miscalculate earlier? Because 1e-67 divided by 1e-50 is 1e-17.

So L² = 0.125 * 1e-17 = 1.25e-18 m².

Wait, then L is sqrt(1.25e-18) m. Let's compute that. sqrt(1.25) is about 1.118, sqrt(1e-18) is 1e-9 meters, so 1.118e-9 m.

Wait, 1e-9 m is 1 nm. So 1.118e-9 m is about 1.118 nm.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought I got 0.354 nm. Now this is 1.118 nm. Which is a big difference. I must have made a mistake in earlier steps.

Let me recompute L².

Wait, E is 3 eV, which is 4.806e-19 J.

So E = 3 eV = 3 * 1.602e-19 = 4.806e-19 J.

Denominator is 2 m E = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg *4.806e-19 J.

Compute 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

Multiply by 4.806e-19: 1.8218e-30 *4.806e-19 = ?

1.8218 *4.806 = let's compute 1.8 *4.8=8.64, but more accurately.

1.8218 *4.806 = 

1.8 *4.806 = 8.6508.

0.0218 *4.806 ≈ 0.1048.

So total ≈ 8.6508 +0.1048 = 8.7556. So 8.7556e-49.

So denominator is 8.7556e-49.

Numerator is π² ħ². Let me compute ħ squared again. ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * (1e-34)^2.

1.0545718 squared is approximately:

1.05^2 =1.1025, 0.0045718^2 negligible, and cross terms 2*1.05 *0.0045718 ≈ 0.0096.

So 1.1025 + 0.0096 ≈ 1.1121.

So ħ² is approximately 1.1121e-68 J² s².

Multiply by π² (≈9.8696): 1.1121e-68 *9.8696 ≈ 10.96e-68 ≈ 1.096e-67 J² s².

So L² = (1.096e-67) / (8.7556e-49) ) = (1.096 / 8.7556) * (1e-67 / 1e-49) ) = (0.125) * 1e-18 = 1.25e-19 m².

Ah, wait, 1e-67 /1e-49 = 1e-18. So 1.096e-67 /8.7556e-49 = 1.096 /8.7556 = approx 0.125, so 0.125e-18 m².

So L = sqrt(0.125e-18) m.

Wait, sqrt(0.125e-18) = sqrt(0.125) * sqrt(1e-18) = approx 0.3536 * 1e-9 m.

Because sqrt(0.125) is about 0.3536, and sqrt(1e-18) is 1e-9 m.

So L ≈ 0.3536e-9 meters = 0.3536 nm.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.300 nm, option G is 0.350 nm.

Wait, 0.3536 nm is approximately 0.35 nm, which is option G.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.

Compute E = 3 eV.

Convert E to J: 3 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV =4.806e-19 J.

Compute denominator: 2 m E = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg *4.806e-19 J.

Compute 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

Multiply by 4.806e-19: 1.8218e-30 *4.806e-19 = ?

1.8218 *4.806 = apprx 8.76 as before.

So 8.76e-49 (since 1e-30 *1e-19 =1e-49).

Numerator: (pi^2) * (hbar)^2.

hbar is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

hbar squared is approx (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.10e-68.

pi^2 is about 9.87, so 9.87 *1.10e-68 ≈10.86e-68 =1.086e-67.

So L² = 1.086e-67 /8.76e-49 = (1.086/8.76) *1e-18.

1.086 divided by 8.76 is approximately 0.125.

So L²=0.125e-18 m².

L= sqrt(0.125e-18) m.

sqrt(0.125) is about 0.3536, sqrt(1e-18) is 1e-9.

So 0.3536e-9 meters is 0.3536 nm.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.350 nm. So the answer should be G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the energy levels of a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels are given by the formula:

\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m L^2},
\]

where \( n \) is the quantum number, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass of the electron, and \( L \) is the width of the well. For the ground state (\( n = 1 \)), the energy is:

\[
E_1 = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m L^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( L^2 \):

\[
L^2 = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m E}.
\]

Taking the square root gives \( L \):

\[
L = \sqrt{\frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m E}}.
\]

### Step 1: Convert energy to joules
The energy of the electron is \( E = 3 \, \text{eV} \). Converting to joules:

\[
E = 3 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} = 4.806 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Plug in constants
The constants used are:
- \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( \pi^2 \approx 9.8696 \).

### Step 3: Compute \( L^2 \)
Substituting into the formula for \( L^2 \):

\[
L^2 = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m E} = \frac{(9.8696)(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 (9.109 \times 10^{-31})(4.806 \times 10^{-19})}.
\]

First, calculate \( \hbar^2 \):

\[
\hbar^2 = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 1.112 \times 10^{-68} \, \text{J}^2 \text{s}^2.
\]

Multiply by \( \pi^2 \):

\[
\pi^2 \hbar^2 = 9.8696 \times 1.112 \times 10^{-68} = 1.096 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \text{s}^2.
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
2 m E = 2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \times 4.806 \times 10^{-19} = 8.76 \times 10^{-49} \, \text{J}^2 \text{s}^2.
\]

Thus:

\[
L^2 = \frac{1.096 \times 10^{-67}}{8.76 \times 10^{-49}} = 0.125 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
Take the square root:

\[
L = \sqrt{0.125 \times 10^{-18}} = \sqrt{0.125} \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}.
\]

\[
\sqrt{0.125} = 0.3536, \quad \sqrt{10^{-18}} = 10^{-9}.
\]

\[
L = 0.3536 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 0.3536 \, \text{nm}.
\]

### Final Answer
The width of the well is approximately \( 0.35 \, \text{nm} \), which corresponds to option **G**.

ANSWER: G
