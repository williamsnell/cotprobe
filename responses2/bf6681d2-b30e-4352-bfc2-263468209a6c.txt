Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about inflation and what type it would be in a specific scenario. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question says that the government decides that labor unions will not be allowed any wage increases until further notice. They want to fight inflation. What type of inflation is this aimed at?

The options are A to J, each representing a different inflation type. I need to recall what each type means.

First, I think about what each inflation type typically refers to. I remember that inflation is generally a general increase in the prices of goods and services. But the question is about a specific reason for the government's decision.

Option A is imported inflation. That's when inflation from other countries affects a country's economy. I'm not sure how relevant that is here because the government's decision is internal.

Option B is hyperinflation. That's a severe and rapid increase in prices that can lead to a complete loss of purchasing power. It usually results from excessive supply creation or a large monetary base. I don't think the government would decide not to increase wages to cause hyperinflation.

Option C is built-in inflation. This is when prices increase due to production costs, supply issues, or other factors, leading to inflation without external shocks. The government's decision is about unions not increasing wages, which affects costs, but I don't think that's built-in inflation.

Option D is sectoral inflation. This happens when a particular industry or sector experiences higher prices, causing a general rise in prices across all goods. But again, the government's decision is about not increasing wages, which is more of an internal cost control measure.

Option E is asset inflation. This refers to prices rising because of the value of assets, like real estate or vehicles. The government's decision isn't related to that.

Option F is stagflation. I remember that stagflation is a mix of high inflation and high unemployment. The government's decision won't directly cause both, so I don't think F is the answer.

Option G is deflation. That's a decrease in prices, so it's the opposite of what the government is doing here.

Option H is wage inflation. This is when wages increase, which directly causes the prices of goods and services to rise as more money is spent on them. So if unions are not increasing wages, that's a reason for wage inflation, which would cause prices to go up.

Option I is cost-push inflation. This occurs when costs of production increase, leading to price rises. If wages aren't being increased, it's because labor costs are rising, which could be a cost-push factor.

Wait, so H and I both seem relevant here. But the question is about the type of inflation the government is aiming at. The government's decision is to prevent wage increases, so it's preventing cost-push inflation. So the type of inflation they're targeting is cost-push, which would be option I.

Alternatively, if the government is not increasing wages, that's a reason for wage inflation. So either H or I could be correct. Let me think again. The question is about the type of inflation the government is fighting. If the government is trying to prevent wage increases, that leads to wage inflation. So the inflation caused by wage increases is the type they're fighting.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The government is trying to prevent wage increases, so that's a way to prevent wage inflation. So the type of inflation this is aimed at is the one caused by wage increases, which is H. But wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. If the government is preventing wage increases, that's a policy to prevent wage inflation. So the type of inflation would be the one that results from wage increases. So if they prevent wage increases, the inflation they're fighting is H. But let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are about the type of inflation the government is targeting. So when unions don't increase wages, that's a reason why they're fighting, which is wage inflation. So the type is H.

But wait, the question is what type of inflation this would be aimed at. So the government is trying to prevent wage increases, which would cause wage inflation. So the inflation they're trying to fight is H: wage inflation.

Alternatively, if the government is trying to prevent wage increases, then the inflation that's happening because of wage increases is what they're fighting. But the question is asking what type of inflation this is aimed at, not what they're fighting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the options again.

The options are A to J. The question is about the type of inflation this scenario is aimed at.

If the government decides not to increase wages, that's because they want to prevent wage inflation. But the inflation they're fighting is because of wage increases. So the type of inflation is H: wage inflation.

Alternatively, if the government is trying to prevent wage increases, that would be a reason for wage inflation, so the type would be H.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think about each option's definition.

A: imported inflation - caused by other factors, not internal.

B: hyperinflation - severe, not this.

C: built-in inflation - internal, caused by supply issues.

D: sectoral - specific sector, not this.

E: asset inflation - real estate, not this.

F: stagflation - high inflation and high unemployment, not this.

G: deflation - opposite.

H: wage inflation - increase in wages leads to price increases.

I: cost-push inflation - cost increases.

J: demand-pull inflation - demand increases.

So the scenario is that unions are not increasing wages, so they want to prevent wage inflation. So the type of inflation they're trying to fight is H: wage inflation.

But wait, the question is about what type of inflation this is aimed at. So perhaps the answer is H.

Alternatively, maybe the government is trying to prevent cost-push, which would be I. So if the government wants to prevent cost-push inflation, which occurs when costs rise, that's I.

Wait, but the question is about the type of inflation the government is fighting. So if unions don't increase wages, that's a reason for wage inflation (H), which would cause the prices to rise. So the government's action is aimed at preventing wage inflation, which is H.

But the options are about what type of inflation this is aimed at. So in this case, the government is trying to prevent wage inflation, so the inflation they're fighting is H. Or, perhaps, it's trying to prevent cost-push, leading to I.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the direction. Let me think: if unions don't increase wages, that's a policy to prevent wage inflation. So the type of inflation this is aimed at is H: wage inflation.

Alternatively, if the government is trying to prevent cost-push, which is I, then the answer would be I.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of another approach.

The options: H is wage inflation, I is cost-push.

The scenario is that unions are not increasing wages. So the government wants to avoid wage increases, which would lead to wage inflation (H).

But the question is about the type of inflation the government is aiming to fight. So the type is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the government is trying to prevent cost-push inflation, which is I, by not increasing wages.

So, the answer is I.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "what type of inflation would this be aimed at?" So the government's policy is to prevent wage increases, which leads to wage inflation. So the type of inflation they are fighting is H.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option again.

When unions don't increase wages, it's because they're trying to avoid wage inflation. So the inflation they're fighting is H: wage inflation.

Alternatively, if the government's aim is to prevent cost-push, that's I. So the answer is I.

Wait, but the question is about the type of inflation the government is fighting. So the type is H.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it this way: if the government doesn't increase wages, that's a reason for wage inflation. So the inflation they're trying to fight is H.

Wait, no. The question is asking what type of inflation this would be aimed at. So the government's policy is to prevent wage increases, which is why they're fighting wage inflation. So the answer is H: wage inflation.

Alternatively, perhaps the government is trying to prevent cost-push, which is I.

Wait, the options are:

H: wage inflation

I: cost-push inflation.

So the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the government is trying to prevent cost-push, but the question is about the type of inflation the government is fighting. So if they are fighting wage inflation, that's H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. If the government doesn't increase wages, that's a reason for wage inflation. So the inflation caused by wage increases is H. Therefore, the government is fighting H.

Alternatively, if the government is trying to prevent cost-push, which would be I, but the question is about the type of inflation they're fighting, which is H.

I think the correct answer is H: wage inflation.
</think>

The government is deciding not to increase wages, which is aimed at preventing wage inflation. Wage inflation occurs when wage increases lead to rises in the prices of goods and services. Since the government's decision is to avoid wage increases, this prevents wage inflation. The type of inflation being targeted is wage inflation. 

Answer: H
