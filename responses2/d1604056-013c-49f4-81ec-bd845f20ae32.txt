Question:

A seller contracted to manufacture 1,000 toasters for a buyer for a specified price. The contract contained a provision that clearly stated: "This contract may not be assigned, and any violation of this prohibition voids the contract." After the contract was signed, the seller informed the buyer that the toasters would be manufactured by a competitor of the seller. Citing the non-assignment provision, the buyer claimed that it was no longer bound by the contract. Toasters manufactured by the competitor were of equal quality to toasters manufactured by the seller. Is the buyer bound by the contract?

Options:

A: Yes, because even though the seller breached the contract, there are no damages since the competitor's toasters are of equal quality to the seller's toasters.
B: No, because the seller assigned a right despite the contractual prohibition.
C: Yes, because the quality of the toasters did not change even though the manufacturer did.
D: No, because the seller violated the contractual prohibition by delegating its duty to a competitor.
E: No, because "this contract may not be assigned" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty.
F: No, because the non-assignment clause voids the contract when violated.
G: No, because the competitor is not a party to the original contract.
H: Yes, because the seller informed the buyer about the change in manufacturer.
I: Yes, because the non-assignment provision is not enforceable since public policy favors free assignment and delegation.
J: Yes, because the buyer did not explicitly reject the toasters manufactured by the competitor.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the buyer is bound by the contract after the seller informed the buyer that the toasters were made by a competitor. Let's break this down.

The contract has a non-assignment provision that says the contract may not be assigned. So, the seller can't transfer the rights or duties to the competitor. But the buyer told the seller that they were made by a competitor. So, the contract might have been assigned to the competitor because the non-assignment clause is about not being assigned. But wait, the contract was signed, and the buyer informed the seller about the new manufacturer. Did that affect the assignment?

I remember that the non-assignment clause generally doesn't allow the other party to assign the contract. So if the contract wasn't assigned, then the original seller can't delegate duties. But in this case, the seller did delegate its duty to a competitor. So the contract might have been assigned to the competitor, which would mean the original contract was void because it was assigned.

Wait, but the contract was signed, and the buyer is claiming that it's not bound. Wait, but the non-assignment clause is a contract term. So if the contract is assigned, it's void. Because the party assigning can't do anything if the contract is already assigned. So the original contract would be void.

So the buyer, thinking the contract is unassignable, is trying to claim it's not bound. But if the contract was assigned, the original contract is void. So the buyer's claim would be valid because the contract is void. So the buyer isn't bound, meaning the contract isn't enforceable.

Looking at the options, option F says "No, because the non-assignment clause voids the contract when violated." So if the contract was assigned (and thus void), the buyer is wrong to think it's not bound. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but the seller did inform the buyer. Does that affect anything? I think the assignment is about whether the contract can be transferred, not about whether it's assigned or not. So the assignment is about whether the contract can be transferred to another party, not whether it's assigned by the original. So the issue is about whether the contract was assigned, which leads to it being void.

So the buyer's claim is that the contract is no longer bound. But if the contract was assigned, the contract is void. So the buyer is correct in believing the contract is no longer bound, because the contract isn't enforceable anymore. So the answer should be F.

The non-assignment provision in the contract prevents the original seller from transferring duties to a competitor. However, the seller explicitly delegated its duty to the competitor, meaning the original contract could potentially be assigned. As a result, the original contract is void under the non-assignment clause. Therefore, the buyer's claim that the contract is no longer bound by the original terms is valid because the contract is void. 

The correct answer is F: No, because the non-assignment clause voids the contract when violated.

Answer: F
