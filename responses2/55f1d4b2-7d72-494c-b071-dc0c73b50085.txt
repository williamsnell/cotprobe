Okay, so I've got this physics problem about thin convex lenses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but let's think through it. The question is about finding the focal length of a combination of two thin convex lenses. Each lens has a focal length f, and they're placed apart at a distance of (2f/3). Wait, no, wait a second—the problem says the two lenses are placed apart at a distance of 2f/3? Or is that the distance between them? I think the distance between them is 2f/3. Wait, no, the problem says "(2f / 3)", which I believe is correct. So the separation is 2f/3.

Wait, no, actually, wait. Wait, the problem states: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So let me reread the question. Oh, right, the question is about the focal length of the combination of two thin convex lenses placed at a distance of (2f/3). Wait, no, wait, wait. No, I think the question is about the focal length of the combination, not the separation. Because the separation is given, but the question is about the focal length of the combination. Oh wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.

Question: "What is the focal length, of a combination of two thin convex lenses, each of focal length f, placed apart at a distance of (2f / 3)?"

Oh wait, the first part is about the combination's focal length. The second part says they are placed apart at a distance of (2f/3). Oh, that's the separation. So the separation is 2f/3, and each lens has focal length f. So I need to find the focal length of the combination.

Wait, but wait: when two lenses are placed together, how do you calculate the equivalent focal length? I remember that for thin lenses in contact, the equivalent focal length is 1/(1/f1 + 1/f2), which is the same as f = f1*f2/(f1 + f2). But wait, wait, no, that's when they are placed together, but if they are separated by some distance, the situation is different. So I think that's when the lenses are placed close together, but when they are separated, the way to calculate the equivalent focal length is a bit more involved.

Wait, right, because when the lenses are separated by a distance d, the combined system behaves as if you have a lens with focal length f_eq, where the separation d is equivalent to a shift in the system. So the formula for the combined focal length when two lenses are separated by a distance d is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + d/(f1*f2). Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the formula is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + d/(f1 f2). Or is it a different arrangement? Wait, no, perhaps not exactly. Let me try to approach this with the thin lens formula.

Let me consider the two lenses placed with separation d. If I place them on the same axis, with lens 1 at some point and lens 2 at a distance d away. The image formed by each lens will be at different positions, so the combined system's behavior depends on their positions.

Alternatively, perhaps each lens is treated as a thin lens, and the combined effect can be found by considering the lenses in series. Wait, no, because when lenses are placed together, they can either be in series or in another configuration. If they're placed side by side (adjacent), then it's like they're in series, but if they're placed apart, it might be in combination as a lens system.

Wait, perhaps I should model the situation as each lens contributing to the combined system. Let me imagine an object placed at some point, and I want to find where the final image is formed, but perhaps that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of treating the two lenses as a single equivalent lens, considering their positions.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume the two lenses are placed such that their principal planes are aligned. So the first lens (L1) is placed at some position, and the second lens (L2) is at a distance d from L1. The separation is d. Now, for thin lenses, the image formed by L1 will form a real object for L2, so we can model this as a combined system.

Wait, I think the combined focal length for two thin lenses separated by a distance d can be found using the formula: 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + d/(f1 f2). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1 f2). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/f_eq = (1/f1 + 1/f2) + (d)/(f1 f2). Wait, let's think of it in terms of the combined system.

Wait, another approach: the combined system can be considered as a combination of the two lenses, with the separation d. The formula for the equivalent focal length of two lenses separated by distance d is given by 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1 f2). Wait, no, I think the correct formula is 1/f_eq = (1/f1 + 1/f2) + (d)/(f1 f2), but that seems to not make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/f_eq = (1/f1 - 1/f2) - (d)/(f1 f2), but that depends on the configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the system as a virtual object. Wait, another approach: Let's model the combination as a single lens. Suppose we have an object at some distance, and we want to find where it forms an image. The first lens, L1, will form an image at a certain position, which will then act as an object for L2. So we can model each step.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to use the concept of equivalent focal length when two lenses are separated. I think the correct formula for the equivalent focal length when two thin lenses are separated by distance d is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + d/(f1 f2). But let me check.

Wait, I think the correct formula is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1 f2). But that would give a larger focal length, which might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2). Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the concept of the system's power. The power of a lens is 1/f (in meters). So, each lens has a power P1 = 1/f and P2 = 1/f. The combined power of the two lenses when placed a distance d apart is P_eq = P1 + P2 + d/(f1 f2). Wait, but that formula for power when two lenses are separated by distance d is perhaps P_eq = P1 + P2 + d/(f1 f2). But wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P_eq = P1 + P2 - d/(f1 f2). I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the situation as two thin lenses in series. Wait, no, because when the lenses are placed apart, the way their images form is different. Wait, another approach: Let's imagine that the first lens (L1) is placed at a certain position, and the second lens (L2) is placed at a distance d from L1. So the separation between L1 and L2 is d.

The first lens (L1) is a convex lens, so it will form a real image at a distance v1 from L1. Then, L2, being a convex lens, will form an image at a distance v2 from L2. The problem is to find the combined effect of these two lenses as a single system.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to model the image formation process. Let me assume an object placed at a distance u from L1. Then, the image formed by L1 is at a distance v1 on the other side. Then, the object for L2 is at a distance u - d, assuming the object is placed at a point where the image is in front of L2. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as if the object is placed at a position such that the image is formed by L2, with the separation in between.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach by considering the combined effect of the two lenses. Let me model the system as L1 followed by L2. Each lens acts as a thin lens, so I can calculate their combined effect as a single lens.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the equivalent focal length when two thin lenses are separated by a distance d. I think that the formula is 1/f_eq = (1/f1 + 1/f2) + d/(f1 f2). Wait, no, that would make 1/f_eq = (f2 + f1)/(f1 f2) ) + d/(f1 f2) ) = (f1 + f2 + d) / (f1 f2) ). So f_eq would be (f1 f2) / (f1 + f2 + d). But f1 and f2 here are in the same denominator as f, so perhaps the formula is f_eq = (f1 f2) / (f1 + f2 + d).

Wait, but in this problem, both f1 and f2 are f. So substituting f1 = f and f2 = f, and d = (2f/3), the formula becomes f_eq = (f * f) / (f + f + (2f/3)).

Let's compute the denominator: f + f = 2f. Plus 2f/3 is 2f + 2f/3 = (6f + 2f)/3 = 8f/3.

So f_eq = f² / (8f/3) ) = (f²) * (3)/(8f) )= (3f) / 8.

Wait, but 3f/8 is one of the options. Let me see: option G is (2f/3), which is about 0.666f. 3f/8 is 0.375f. So that's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - d/(f1 f2). Let me try that.

So substituting f1 = f, f2 = f, d = (2f/3):

1/f_eq = (1/f + 1/f) - (2f/3)/(f * f) )

= (2/f) - (2f/3)/(f²) )

= (2/f) - (2/(3f)) )

= (6/(3f) - 2/(3f)) ) = (4/(3f)) )

So 1/f_eq = 4/(3f) → f_eq = 3f/4.

Wait, 3f/4 is one of the options. Let me check the options. Option E is (3f/4). So that would be the focal length.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I might have the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach the problem differently.

Another way to think about it is to model the two lenses as a combined system where their separation is d. The formula for the combined focal length when two thin lenses are separated by distance d is:

1/f_eq = (1/f1 + 1/f2) + (d)/(f1 f2).

Wait, but wait—does that make sense dimensionally? Because (1/f1 +1/f2) is in terms of 1/m, and (d)/(f1 f2) is in terms of meters. So perhaps that's not the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the system as a combination of the two lenses in a way that their combined effect is a single lens.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1 f2). Let me try that again.

Wait, but if I use this formula, substituting the values:

1/f_eq = 1/f + 1/f + ( (2f/3) )/( f * f )

= 2/f + (2f/3)/(f² )

= 2/f + (2)/(3f )

= (6 + 2)/(3f )

= 8/(3f )

→ f_eq = 3f/8.

But 3f/8 is not one of the options. The closest options are E (3f/4) and D (6f/5), which is 6/5 f. So 3f/8 is about 0.375 f, which isn't listed. So perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Another approach: Let's think of the situation as two lenses placed a distance d apart, each with focal length f. Let's consider the combined effect on an object placed at a certain position. Let's imagine an object placed at a very far distance (u → infinity), so the object is at infinity, and the image is formed by the first lens at a distance v1. Then, the image is at a finite distance, so the second lens is placed between the object and its image. So the image is formed at a distance v2 by the second lens.

In this case, the combined system can be treated as a single lens whose focal length is f_eq, and the separation between L1 and L2 is d. So the image formed by the first lens (L1) is at a distance v1, which is at a distance d + v1 from the second lens (L2).

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to model this as an object placed at a certain point, and then the image formed by each lens. Let me try that.

Suppose the object is at a distance u from the first lens (L1). Then, the image is formed by L1 at a distance v1. Then, the image is at a distance (d + v1) from L2, which is the object for L2. The image is formed by L2 at a distance v2 from L2.

Using the thin lens formula for each:

For L1: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v1 → v1 = (f u)/(u - f).

For L2: 1/f = 1/(d + v1) + 1/v2 → v2 = (f (d + v1))/(d + v1 - f).

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the combined system can be considered as a single lens with focal length f_eq, and the separation d between them. So, for an object at infinity, the image is formed at v1 by L1, which is at a distance d + v1 from L2. Then, L2 forms an image at v2, which is the image of the image from L1.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Let's model this as the image formed by the two lenses as a single system.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the combined focal length when two thin lenses are separated by a distance d is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + d/(f1 f2).

Wait, substituting f1 = f, f2 = f, d = 2f/3:

1/f_eq = 1/f + 1/f + (2f/3)/(f^2 ) = 2/f + (2)/(3f) = (6 + 2)/(3f) )= 8/(3f) → f_eq = 3f/8. But this isn't an option. So what gives?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/f_eq = (1/f1 + 1/f2) - (d)/(f1 f2). Let's test this:

1/f_eq = (1/f + 1/f) - (2f/3)/(f^2) ) = 2/f - (2)/(3f) )= (6-2)/(3f) )= 4/(3f) → f_eq = 3f/4, which is option E.

Looking back, option E is 3f/4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but why is the formula subtracting (d)/(f1 f2) instead of adding? Let's think about it. When the lenses are placed apart, the effect on the combined focal length might be such that it's a combination of the individual focal lengths and the separation.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + d/(f1 f2). But in that case, if I substitute the values, as I did earlier, I get 3f/8, which isn't an option. But the other formula gives 3f/4, which is an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the system using the formula for two lenses in contact and then adjust for the separation. Wait, when two lenses are placed in contact, separated by zero distance, their combined focal length is (f1 f2)/(f1 + f2). Here, f1 = f2 = f, so (f*f)/(f + f) )= f²/(2f) )= f/2. So the combined focal length when they are in contact is f/2.

But when they are separated by d, the combined focal length would be less than f/2, because the lenses are further apart. So in this case, perhaps the formula is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - d/(f1 f2).

Wait, substituting:

1/f_eq = 1/f + 1/f - (2f/3)/(f^2 )

→ 2/f - (2)/(3f) ) = (6 - 2)/(3f) ) = 4/(3f) → f_eq = 3f/4, which matches option E.

So the correct answer should be E: 3f/4.

To determine the focal length of a combination of two thin convex lenses, each with a focal length \( f \), placed at a separation of \( \frac{2f}{3} \), we analyze the possible formulas for the combined focal length. The separation \( d \) affects the calculation, and the correct formula depends on whether the lenses are placed in contact (separation \( d = 0 \)) or separated by a distance \( d \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Formula for Two Lenses in Contact (Separation \( d = 0 \)):**
   The combined focal length when two lenses are placed in contact is given by:
   \[
   \frac{1}{f_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2}
   \]
   Substituting \( f_1 = f_2 = f \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{f_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{f} + \frac{1}{f} = \frac{2}{f}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   f_{\text{eq}} = \frac{f}{2}
   \]

2. **Formula for Two Lenses Separated by a Distance \( d \):**
   When the lenses are separated by a distance \( d \), the combined focal length can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{f_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} - \frac{d}{f_1 f_2}
   \]
   Substituting \( f_1 = f_2 = f \) and \( d = \frac{2f}{3} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{f_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{f} + \frac{1}{f} - \frac{\frac{2f}{3}}{f \cdot f}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{1}{f_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{2}{f} - \frac{2}{3f}
   \]
   Combine terms:
   \[
   \frac{1}{f_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{6}{3f} - \frac{2}{3f} = \frac{4}{3f}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   f_{\text{eq}} = \frac{3f}{4}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The focal length of the combination of two thin convex lenses, each with a focal length \( f \), placed at a separation of \( \frac{2f}{3} \), is \( \frac{3f}{4} \). This corresponds to option **E**.
