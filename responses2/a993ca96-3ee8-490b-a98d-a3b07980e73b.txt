Okay, so I've got this question about the expansion of a steel bridge due to temperature changes. Hmm, I need to figure out how much expansion is needed. Let me think about what I know.

The question says the bridge is two miles long, and the temperature ranges from -40°F to +110°F. The expansion coefficient is given as 0.000012 per degree Celsius. Wait, I remember that the formula for linear expansion is delta_L = alpha * L * delta_T. Right, that's the formula.

So first, I need to convert the temperature change into Celsius because the coefficient is given in °C. Oh yeah, because the expansion depends on the temperature change, not Fahrenheit. So I need to convert each temperature to Celsius.

Let me calculate the temperature change. The starting point is -40°F. To convert to Celsius, I use the formula C = (F - 32) * 5/9. So for -40°F: (-40-32) = -72. Multiply by 5/9: -72*(5/9) = -40°C. Oh wait, that's right because water freezes at 0°C and then 32°F is 0°C, so yeah, -40°F is -40°C.

Now the ending temperature is +110°F. Using the same formula: (110-32) = 78. 78*(5/9) = 43.333... So approximately 43.333°C. So the temperature change is from -40 to +43.333, which is an increase of 83.333°C. Wait, 43.333 - (-40) is 83.333. So delta_T is about 83.333°C.

Now, plug into the formula. L is 2 miles. Alpha is 0.000012/°C.

So delta_L = 2 * 0.000012 * 83.333. Let me compute that step by step. 2 * 0.000012 is 0.000024. Multiply by 83.333: 0.000024 * 83.333.

Hmm, let's see. 83.333 * 0.000024. Well, 83.333 * 0.00002 is 0.00166666, and 83.333 * 0.000004 is 0.00033333. Adding them gives approximately 0.002 miles. Oh wait, because 240. 0.000024 is 24e-5. So 83.333 * 24e-5 = (83.333 * 24) * 1e-5.

83.333 *24: 80*24=1920, 3.333*24=80 (approx). So 1920 +80=2000. So 2000 *1e-5 = 0.02 miles. Wait, wait, that can't be right because 0.000024 *83.333 is 0.002000. Because 0.000024 *83.333 = 0.002.

Wait, but the options are options A to J, and looking at the options, I don't see 0.002. Oh wait, no. Let's check the options again. The options are A: .003, B: .001, C: .008, D: .0005, E: .005, F: .009, G: .006, H: .002, I: .004, J: .007. So option H is 0.002 miles.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck. 2 * 0.000012 is 0.000024. Multiply by 83.333. Let me compute 0.000024 * 83.333.

Alternatively, 0.000024 is 24e-6. So 24e-6 *83.333 = (24 *83.333) * e-6.

24 *83.333 = 24*(250/3) )= 24*83.333 = (24*83) + (24*(1/3)) = 2000 (because 83*24=2000, as 83*20=1660, 83*4=332, total 1992, wait maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 83 *24: 80*24=1920; 3*24=72, so 1920+72=1992. Then, 24*(1/3) is 8. So 1992 +8=2000. So 24*83.333=2000. So 2000 *e-6 =0.002 miles. So yeah, 0.002 miles is the expansion.

Looking back at the options, option H is 0.002 miles. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait, the options are letters, so the choices are A: .003, B: .001, etc. So the answer is H, which is 0.002. So the correct option is H.

To determine the expansion of a steel bridge due to temperature changes, the formula for linear expansion is used: 

\[
\Delta L = \alpha \cdot L \cdot \Delta T
\]

### Given:
- Length of the bridge, \( L = 2 \, \text{miles} \)
- Initial temperature, \( T_{\text{initial}} = -40^\circ \text{F} \)
- Final temperature, \( T_{\text{final}} = +110^\circ \text{F} \)
- Coefficient of linear expansion for steel, \( \alpha = 0.000012 \, \text{per}^\circ \text{C} \)

### Step 1: Convert temperature range to Celsius
The temperature change is calculated as:

\[
\Delta T = T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial}}
\]

First, convert \( T_{\text{initial}} \) to Celsius:

\[
T_{\text{initial, C}} = \left( -40 - 32 \right) \cdot \frac{5}{9} = -72 \cdot \frac{5}{9} = -40^\circ \text{C}
\]

Next, convert \( T_{\text{final}} \) to Celsius:

\[
T_{\text{final, C}} = \left( 110 - 32 \right) \cdot \frac{5}{9} = 78 \cdot \frac{5}{9} \approx 43.333^\circ \text{C}
\]

Thus, the temperature change is:

\[
\Delta T = 43.333 - (-40) = 83.333^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate linear expansion
Using the formula:

\[
\Delta L = \alpha \cdot L \cdot \Delta T = 0.000012 \cdot 2 \cdot 83.333
\]

First, compute \( 0.000012 \cdot 2 \):

\[
0.000012 \cdot 2 = 0.000024
\]

Now multiply by \( \Delta T \):

\[
\Delta L = 0.000024 \cdot 83.333 \approx 0.002 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated expansion is \( 0.002 \, \text{miles} \), which corresponds to option H.
