Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about machine learning algorithms and their performance. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and I need to evaluate each and then match them with the given options.

Statement 1 says that the SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis with respect to its object function. Hmm, I remember that SVMs use a margin-based approach to find a separating hyperplane. The goal is to maximize the margin, which leads to minimizing the classification error on the training data. But does that guarantee the global optimum? Oh right, I think SVMs are known for their ability to find the maximum margin hyperplane, which is the global minimum in some cases, but wait, wait. Wait, the object function here could be the hinge loss, which is convex, so looking for a global minimum is possible. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, sometimes algorithms can get stuck in local minima. But wait, isn't the maximum margin solution unique in some cases? Or not necessarily. Wait, for linear SVMs, the solution is unique because the weight vector is determined uniquely (up to scale) and the bias. So in the case of linear kernels, they have a unique solution. But what about non-linear kernels like SVMs with kernels that are not linear? Oh wait, SVMs can have non-linear decision boundaries because the kernel maps the data into a higher dimension. But the main point is about the learning algorithm. SVMs with convex loss functions should have a unique solution, so they can find the global optimum. So Statement 1 seems correct.

Statement 2 says that using a radial basis kernel (RBF) in a Perceptron can improve classification performance compared to the original space, but we can't guarantee this. Wait, Perceptrons are linear classifiers, right? So the original space is just linear. If we use a kernel, like RBF, we're moving into a higher-dimensional space where the data might be linearly separable. But the RBF kernel is a non-linear kernel. So the Perceptron in the feature space Q (created by the kernel) might find a linear hyperplane there, which corresponds to a non-linear decision boundary in the original space. So yes, using RBF can improve classification, but can it guarantee better performance? Oh, wait, the RBF kernel isn't a linear transformation. The feature space is infinite-dimensional because RBF is a non-kernel function. So the Perceptron in Q (feature space) would be a linear classifier, but the original space is linear. But wait, the RBF kernel allows for non-linear decision boundaries because it's a non-linear transformation. So the Perceptron in the feature space might have better performance in terms of separating the data, but the guarantee is that it's better than the original space. Wait, the statement says that we can't guarantee this. So Statement 2 is claiming that using the RBF kernel's Perceptron can improve performance, but we can't be sure. Is that true?

Wait, the RBF kernel can help in cases where the data isn't linearly separable in the original space. So the Perceptron may find a better (better in terms of classification accuracy) solution in the feature space. But does that guarantee it? Or is it possible that the RBF kernel's Perceptron could perform worse? Or is it that the RBF can't guarantee better performance because it's an approximation? Or is it that the RBF kernel allows for a solution that is better than the linear one, but we can't be sure it's the best possible.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In the original space, the Perceptron can't find a separating hyperplane if the data is not linearly separable. If we use a kernel, like RBF, then the feature space allows for more flexibility. So the Perceptron in the feature space Q would try to find a hyperplane, which, when mapped back, could give a non-linear decision boundary. But can that guarantee better classification? Or is it just that in some cases it's better, but not always.

But wait, the statement says that after mapping into feature space Q, the Perceptron may achieve better classification (so in some cases, yes, it's better), but we can't guarantee it. So the statement is correct because it's possible that using the RBF kernel's Perceptron could improve performance, but it's not a guarantee. So Statement 2 is correct.

Wait, but another thought: The RBF kernel's Perceptron is essentially a linear classifier in the feature space, but the feature space is not explicitly known. So the performance of this classifier depends on how well the data is separable in the feature space. So some data may require a higher dimensionality (more kernel evaluations) to be linearly separable, while others might not. So the performance could vary. But the question is about whether we can guarantee better performance. Since the feature space is infinite-dimensional and the kernel is non-linear, the performance isn't guaranteed. So Statement 2 is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me cross-check.

Statement 1: Yes, the SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis. Because the loss function is convex and differentiable, the optimization problem is convex, which means the global minimum is found. So yes, Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: It's possible that using RBF kernel's Perceptron can improve classification, but we can't guarantee this. Because in some cases, the data is separable in the transformed space, but not in the original. So yes, Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but looking back, the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

I need to evaluate each statement.

Statement 1: True. Because the SVM's loss function is convex, the optimization is convex, so the global minimum is found.

Statement 2: True. Because using the RBF kernel allows the Perceptron to find a better (better in terms of classification) hyperplane in the feature space, but we can't be sure because it depends on the data's separability in the feature space. So yes, Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but wait. The original question says, "Statement 2: After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space (though we can’t guarantee this)."

So yes, the statement claims that the RBF kernel's Perceptron can perform better, but we can’t guarantee it. So Statement 2 is correct.

So Statement 1: True.

Statement 2: True.

But wait, looking at the options, option F is true, true. But I thought option G was statement 1 false, 2 false. Let me read the options again.

The options are:

A: False, True
B: True, False
C: Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is not applicable
D: False, False
E: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is not applicable
F: True, True
G: Statement 1 is partially True, Statement 2 is false
H: Statement 1 and Statement 2 are both not applicable
I: Statement 1 is not applicable, Statement 2 is False
J: Statement 1 is not applicable, Statement 2 is True

So option F says both are true. So if both are correct, then the answer would be F.

Wait, but let me recheck Statement 1. Is the SVM's learning algorithm guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis? The optimization problem is convex, so yes, the solution is global. So Statement 1 is correct.

Statement 2 says that using RBF's Perceptron can achieve better performance, but we can't guarantee. So yes, Statement 2 is correct.

So the correct option is F: True, True.
</think>

The question evaluates two statements about machine learning algorithms and their performance. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Statement 1**: The SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis.  
   - SVMs use a convex loss function (hinge loss), which ensures that the optimization problem is convex. This means the global minimum is found, making Statement 1 true.

2. **Statement 2**: Using a radial basis kernel (RBF) in a Perceptron improves classification performance but cannot be guaranteed.  
   - The RBF kernel allows the Perceptron to operate in a higher-dimensional feature space (Q), enabling the finding of a separating hyperplane that may improve classification. However, the feasibility depends on the data's separability in Q, which isn't guaranteed. Thus, Statement 2 is true.

Both statements are correct, so the correct option is **F: True, True**.
