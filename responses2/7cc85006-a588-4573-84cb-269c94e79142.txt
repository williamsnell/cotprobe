Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that x minus 3 and y plus 3 are both multiples of 7. I need to find the smallest positive integer n such that x² + xy + y² + n is a multiple of 7. Hmm, okay.

First, let's parse what it means for x - 3 and y + 3 to be multiples of 7. That means x - 3 = 7k for some integer k, and y + 3 = 7m for some integer m. So, x = 7k + 3 and y = 7m - 3. That makes sense.

Now, I need to substitute these expressions into x² + xy + y² and see what that gives me modulo 7. Because we're dealing with multiples of 7, working modulo 7 should simplify things.

Let me write down x and y in terms of k and m:

x = 7k + 3
y = 7m - 3

So, let's compute x². That's (7k + 3)². Expanding that, it's 49k² + 42k + 9. Now, modulo 7, 49k² is 0, 42k is 0, so x² ≡ 9 mod 7. But 9 mod 7 is 2, since 7 goes into 9 once with remainder 2.

Next, let's compute xy. That's (7k + 3)(7m - 3). Multiplying this out: 49km -21k +21m -9. Modulo 7, 49km is 0, -21k is 0, 21m is 0, and -9 mod7 is -2. So xy ≡ -2 mod7, which is the same as 5 mod7.

Now, y² is (7m -3)², which is 49m² -42m +9. Modulo7, 49m² is 0, -42m is 0, so y² ≡9 mod7, which is again 2.

So adding them all together: x² + xy + y² = 2 + 5 + 2 = 9. But wait, 9 mod7 is 2. So x² + xy + y² ≡2 mod7.

Now, we want x² + xy + y² +n ≡0 mod7. So, 2 + n ≡0 mod7. That means n≡-2 mod7. Since we need the smallest positive integer, n can be 5 because 5 mod7 is -2. Wait, 5 mod7 is 5, but wait, -2 mod7 is 5 because 7-2=5. So n=5. But wait, let me check that again.

Wait, wait, no: 2 + n ≡0 mod7 ⇒ n ≡-2 mod7 ⇒ which is 5 mod7. So yes, the smallest positive n is 5. So the answer is option C:5.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, x²: (7k+3)^2 = 49k² + 42k +9. Mod7, 49k²=0, 42k=0, so 9 mod7 is 2. Correct.

xy: (7k+3)(7m-3) = 49km -21k +21m -9. Mod7, 49km=0, -21k=0, 21m=0, -9= -2 mod7. So xy=5 mod7. Correct.

y²: (7m-3)^2 =49m² -42m +9. Mod7, 49m²=0, -42m=0, 9=2 mod7. So y²=2 mod7. Correct.

Adding them: 2+5+2=9≡2 mod7. So 2 +n≡0 mod7 ⇒n=5. So n=5 is the answer.

Wait, but let me see the options. The options are A:9, B:8, C:5, D:6, E:3, F:2, G:4, H:7, I:10, J:1. So C is 5, which is what I got. So that's the answer.

The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( x^2 + xy + y^2 + n \) is a multiple of 7, given that \( x - 3 \) and \( y + 3 \) are multiples of 7. 

Express \( x \) and \( y \) as \( x = 7k + 3 \) and \( y = 7m - 3 \). Substituting these into \( x^2 + xy + y^2 \):

- \( x^2 = (7k + 3)^2 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
- \( xy = (7k + 3)(7m - 3) \equiv 5 \mod 7 \)
- \( y^2 = (7m - 3)^2 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)

Adding them: \( 2 + 5 + 2 = 9 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \). To make \( 2 + n \equiv 0 \mod 7 \), \( n \equiv 5 \mod 7 \). The smallest positive \( n \) is 5.
