Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in China who reported being in a physical fight during school in 2015. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that this type of question is likely about a study or report from a specific source. I'm thinking maybe it's from the National Bureau of Statistics or some similar government agency. I'm not exactly sure which year the data was published, but the question says 2015.

I recall that the Chinese government has been tracking school-related incidents, so the data might be from a recent study. I think I've heard that in China, physical fights among schoolchildren are a common issue, especially around the age of 13-15. But what's the exact percentage?

Looking at the options, the choices are around 29-99% percentages. Hmm. I'm trying to remember if I've heard of any specific figures. Oh wait, I think in 2015, the percentage was around 29%. Let me think why. Maybe it's because when I was in school, sometimes fights happen, but it's not a common occurrence. Or perhaps it's a recent study showing a lower incidence compared to previous years.

Wait, another angle: I've heard that the number of physical fights has been decreasing over time, which might explain a lower percentage. But I'm not sure if it's significantly lower. I think 29% is a common number for such statistics in some countries, but I'm not certain about China.

Another approach: let's consider the options. Option C is 29%, which might be the correct answer. But I should double-check. I think that the percentage dropped from around 40% in the past and is now lower. Wait, but the options don't have a lower number; they're all higher. Wait, no. The options are all percentages, but some are much lower than others. Wait, no, the question gives 29% as an option, so someone might think that's the right answer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of other possibilities. Could it be 9%? No, that's too low. 19% seems also too low. 29% is plausible. Or 39%? That's about a third. I think the actual number in China is around 29%, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I've heard that in the past, the percentage was around 29%, and it's been decreasing, but the question is about the current year, 2015, so perhaps it's 29%.

Alternatively, I'm a bit unsure, but I think it's around 29%. So the answer would be option C: 29%.
