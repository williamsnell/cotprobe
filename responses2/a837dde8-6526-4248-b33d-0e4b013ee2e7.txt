Question:

Two competing department stores have a radio whose cost is $10.82. Both stores advertise that they sell the radio on a 70% markup. However, store A bases the markup on the selling price, while store B bases it on the cost price. What is the selling price of the radio in the two stores?

Options:

A: Store A: $23.95, Store B: $18.39
B: Store A: $10.82, Store B: $7.57
C: Store A: $18.39, Store B: $23.95
D: Store A: $15.00, Store B: $20.00
E: Store A: $30.00, Store B: $25.00
F: Store A: $18.39, Store B: $36.07
G: Store A: $25.00, Store B: $30.00
H: Store A: $7.57, Store B: $10.82
I: Store A: $20.57, Store B: $25.72
J: Store A: $36.07, Store B: $18.39

Okay, so I've got this problem about two department stores selling a radio. Both have the same cost price, which is $10.82. They both advertise a 70% markup, but they apply it differently. Store A bases the markup on the selling price, while Store B does it on the cost price. I need to find out the selling price for each store and then match it to the given options.

Wait, let me think. The cost is $10.82. So, the markup is 70% of something. For Store B, it's on the cost price. That sounds straightforward. So for Store B, the markup would be 70% of $10.82. Let me calculate that. 70% is 0.7, so 0.7 * $10.82 equals... let me see. 10 * 0.7 is $7, 0.82 * 0.7 is about $0.574. So total is $7.574, which I'll round to $7.57. Then, the selling price is the cost plus the markup. So $10.82 + $7.57 is $18.39. So Store B's selling price is $18.39. Looking at the options, Store B is $18.39 in all the options except maybe some where it's $10.82. So any option where B is $18.39 is a possible answer.

Now for Store A, the markup is based on the selling price. That's a bit trickier. The markup is 70% of the selling price, but wait, markup is usually a percentage of the cost, not the selling price. Or is it? Hmm. Wait, the wording says both advertise a 70% markup, but they apply it differently. So I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says both have a 70% markup, but the way they apply it is different. Store A uses the selling price as the base, while Store B uses the cost. So for Store B, markup is 70% of cost. For Store A, markup is 70% of selling price. So let me model this.

Let’s denote S as the selling price. For Store A, the markup is 70% of S, so the selling price S is the cost plus 70% of S. Wait, that can't be right because if S = cost + markup (which is 70% of S), then S = $10.82 + 0.7S. Let me solve for S.

S = 10.82 + 0.7S  
Subtract 0.7S from both sides:  
0.3S = 10.82  
S = 10.82 / 0.3  
Calculating that: 10.82 divided by 0.3. Let me do the division. 0.3 goes into 10.82.

Well, 0.3 * 36 = 10.8, so 36 * 0.3 = 10.8. That gives 36, but we have 10.82, which is 0.02 more. So 0.02 / 0.3 is approximately 0.066666... So 36.066666... So total S is approximately $36.07.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 0.3 * 36.07 is 10.821, which is a bit over, but close. Alternatively, perhaps a better way: 10.82 divided by 0.3 is the same as multiplying by (10/3), which is approximately 3.333333. So 10.82 * (10/3) = (10.82 * 10)/3 = 108.2 /3 = 36.066666..., which rounds to $36.07. So Store A's selling price is $36.07.

Wait wait, but looking at the options, Store A's options are either $23.95, $15, $20.57, $36.07, etc.

So Store A's selling price is $36.07, and Store B is $18.39. Looking at the options, which option has Store A selling at $36.07 and Store B at $18.39? Let me look.

Option E: Store A: $30.00, Store B: $25.00. No, that's not. Option J: Store A: $36.07, Store B: $18.39. Yes, that's option J. So the correct answer is J: Store A: $36.07, Store B: $18.39.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the calculations. So for Store A, markup is 70% of S. So S = cost + markup. Markup is 70% of S, so S = 10.82 + 0.7S. So 0.3S =10.82 → S=10.82/0.3 = 36.0666..., which is $36.07.

Store B's markup is 70% of cost, so 0.7*10.82 =7.574, so $7.57, and 10.82 +7.574 is $18.394, which rounds to $18.39. So yes, Store A is $36.07, Store B is $18.39. Looking at the options, that's option J.

The problem involves two stores with a 70% markup on different bases. For Store A, the markup is applied to the selling price, while for Store B, it's applied to the cost price. 

**Store B's markup:**
- Cost price = $10.82
- Markup = 70% of cost = 0.7 * $10.82 ≈ $7.57
- Selling price = Cost + Markup = $10.82 + $7.57 = $18.39

**Store A's markup:**
- Let S be the selling price.
- Markup = 70% of S → S = $10.82 + 0.7S
- Solving for S: 0.3S = $10.82 → S ≈ $36.07

**Matching with options:**
- Store A: $36.07
- Store B: $18.39

This matches **Option J**.
