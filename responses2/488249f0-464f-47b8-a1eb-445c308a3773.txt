Okay, so I have this probability question here about rolling a pair of dice and getting certain totals. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the probability of throwing at least one of the totals 5, 6, or 7 on a single throw of a pair of dice. They've defined events A, B, and C as follows: A is getting a total of 5, B is a total of 6, and C is a total of 7.

Wait, but the question says "at least one," which means I need to consider the probability of A or B or C happening. But since these are separate events, I can't just add their probabilities directly because that would count some cases multiple times. Oh right, so I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That is, P(A ∨ B ∨ C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A ∧ B) - P(A ∧ C) - P(B ∧ C) + P(A ∧ B ∧ C).

But wait, in this case, is there any overlap between these events? Like, can you get two different totals at the same time? Like, can you get both 5 and 6? No, because each die roll can only result in one total. So the events A, B, and C are mutually exclusive. That means there are no overlaps or intersections. So that simplifies things.

So, since A, B, and C are mutually exclusive, their probabilities can just be added together. So the total probability is P(A) + P(B) + P(C).

Now, I need to find the probability of each event.

First, let's figure out how many possible outcomes there are when rolling two dice. Each die has 6 sides, so 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes.

Next, let's find the number of favorable outcomes for each event.

Event A: total of 5. Let's list all the possible pairs that add up to 5. The possible combinations are (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1). So that's 4 outcomes.

Event B: total of 6. The combinations are (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1). That's 5 outcomes.

Event C: total of 7. The combinations are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). That's 6 outcomes.

So now, P(A) is 4/36, P(B) is 5/36, and P(C) is 6/36.

Adding these up: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. So 15/36.

Wait, but let me double-check if any of these events are impossible. Like, is there any overlap? Since each event is a different total, they can't both happen at the same time. So yeah, adding is correct.

So 15/36 simplifies to 5/12.

Looking at the options, option E is 5/12, which matches. So the answer should be E.
</think>

The probability of getting a total of 5, 6, or 7 on a single throw of a pair of dice is calculated by adding the probabilities of each event. There are 15 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible, which simplifies to 5/12. 

Answer: E) 5/12
