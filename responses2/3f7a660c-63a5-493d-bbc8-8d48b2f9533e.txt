Okay, so I have this probability question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about approximating the probability that the sample mean X̄ is between 1/2 and 2/3, given that the sample size is 12 from a uniform distribution on (0,1). Hmm, right.

First, I remember that when dealing with sample means from a uniform distribution, the distribution of the sample mean tends to be approximately normal due to the Central Limit Theorem, especially with a large enough sample size. But wait, the sample size here is 12, which isn't that big, but maybe it's still manageable for approximation. Or perhaps the question is hinting towards using continuity correction because we're dealing with a discrete distribution approximated by a continuous one. Oh, right, sometimes when approximating discrete distributions with continuous ones, continuity correction is applied. So that might be relevant here.

So, the uniform distribution on (0,1) has a mean μ and variance σ². For a uniform distribution U(0,1), the mean is 0.5 and the variance is 1/12. That's because for a uniform distribution on [a,b], the variance is (b-a)^2 / 12. Here, a=0 and b=1, so variance is 1/12.

Since we have a sample of size n=12, the sample mean X̄ will have a mean μ̄ = μ = 0.5 and a variance σ̄² = σ² / n = (1/12)/12 = 1/144. So the standard deviation σ̄ is sqrt(1/144) = 1/12 ≈ 0.08333.

Now, we're looking for P(1/2 ≤ X̄ ≤ 2/3). So, let's convert these values to the standardized form (z-scores) to use the normal distribution.

First, for the lower bound: X̄ = 1/2. The z-score is (X̄ - μ) / σ̄ = (0.5 - 0.5)/(1/12) = 0. So it's exactly at the mean.

For the upper bound: X̄ = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. The z-score is (0.6667 - 0.5) / (1/12) = (0.1667) / (0.0833) ≈ 2. So that's about 2 standard deviations above the mean.

So, the probability that X̄ is between 1/2 and 2/3 is the same as the probability that a standard normal variable Z is between 0 and 2, because the lower bound corresponds to Z=0 and the upper to Z=2.

Looking up the standard normal distribution, the area from Z=0 to Z=2 is the cumulative probability at Z=2 minus the cumulative probability at Z=0. The cumulative probability at Z=0 is 0.5, and at Z=2, it's approximately 0.9772. So subtracting, 0.9772 - 0.5 = 0.4772. That's about 0.4772, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the continuity correction needed here? Since we're dealing with a discrete distribution (uniform) approximated by a continuous one (normal), sometimes we apply continuity correction to adjust for this. But in this case, the sample size is 12, which is a bit small, but maybe the question is expecting the normal approximation without continuity correction.

Alternatively, if I didn't use continuity correction, the probability would be from 0 to 2, which is 0.4772. Looking at the options, C is 0.4772. So that's the answer.

Wait, but another thought: is the distribution of X̄ approximately normal? Because the Central Limit Theorem says that as n increases, the distribution approaches normality. For n=12, maybe it's not that good, but the question says to approximate, so we proceed with normal distribution.

Alternatively, since it's a uniform distribution, the exact distribution of X̄ is the Irwin–Hall distribution, which for n=12 is the sum of 12 uniform variables. But that's complicated, so we go with the normal approximation.

So, to recap: mean is 0.5, standard deviation is 1/12. The interval is from 0.5 (z=0) to (2/3 -0.5)/(1/12)= (2/3 - 3/6)= (4/6 - 3/6)=1/6=0.1667, which over 1/12 is 2. So z=2.

Looking up, the probability between 0 and 2 is 0.4772, which is option C.

To approximate \( P(1/2 \leq \bar{X} \leq 2/3) \), we use the Central Limit Theorem. The sample mean \(\bar{X}\) for a uniform distribution on (0,1) has a mean \(\mu = 0.5\) and standard deviation \(\sigma = \frac{1}{12}\). For \(n = 12\), the standard error is \(\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{1}{12}\). The z-scores for the bounds are:

- Lower bound: \( z = \frac{1/2 - 0.5}{1/12} = 0 \)
- Upper bound: \( z = \frac{2/3 - 0.5}{1/12} = 2 \)

The probability between these z-scores is the area under the standard normal curve from \(z = 0\) to \(z = 2\), which is approximately 0.4772. Thus, the correct answer is:
