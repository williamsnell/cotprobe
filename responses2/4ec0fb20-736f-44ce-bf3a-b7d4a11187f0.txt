Okay, so I need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 42 and 84. Hmm, I remember that the GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Let me think about the steps to find it.

First, maybe I can list out all the factors of each number and then see which ones are common. Let's start with 42. The factors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. Now for 84, the factors are a bit more. Let me see, 84 divided by 1 is 84, so 1 and 84. 2 times 42 is 84, so 2 and 42. 3 times 28 is 84, so 3 and 28. 4 times 21 is 84, so 4 and 21. 6 times 14 is 84, so 6 and 14. I think that's all. So the factors of 84 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 84.

Now I need to find the common factors between 42 and 84. Looking at both lists:

Factors of 42: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.
Factors of 84: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84.

The common ones are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42. The largest among these is 42. So the GCF of 42 and 84 is 42. Wait, but let me think if there's a quicker way. Oh right, I remember the prime factorization method.

Let me factorize both numbers into primes. Starting with 42: it's 2 × 21, and 21 is 3 × 7. So 42 is 2 × 3 × 7.

For 84: 84 divided by 2 is 42. 42 is 2 × 21, which is 3 × 7. So 84 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 7, which is 2² × 3 × 7.

The GCF is the product of the lowest power of all common primes. So the primes common to both are 2, 3, and 7. The lowest power for each is 2¹, 3¹, and 7¹. Multiplying these together: 2 × 3 × 7 = 42. So that's the same as before.

Looking back at the options, I see option G is 42, so that's the answer. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A to J, with G being 42. So yeah, that's the correct one.
