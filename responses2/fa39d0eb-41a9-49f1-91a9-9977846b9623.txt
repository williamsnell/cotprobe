Question:

What external strategies do elites employ?

Options:

A: Elites may also use economic strategies, such as the manipulation of currency or the imposition of sanctions, to maintain their power and control.
B: An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats.
C: Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance frequently are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met.
D: An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what external strategies elites employ. Let me think through this.

The question gives four options: A, B, C, D. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I know.

First, I need to understand what "elites" are. I think elites are the powerful groups or individuals who have a lot of power, like the government, military, or other state organizations. They probably use various strategies to maintain their control and influence.

Looking at the options:

Option A: They might use economic strategies like manipulating currency or imposing sanctions. That makes sense because often powerful countries use economic means to control others. Like how the US imposed sanctions on China to protect its interests.

Option B: Employ private military companies and mercenaries. Wait, isn't that more common in the military? Like, some countries use foreign help to counter internal threats. I'm not sure if they're called "elites" though. Also, this seems more about local security rather than external strategies. Maybe this is about internal threats rather than external ones.

Option C: Weak states avoid alliances because it's conditional on democratization and penalties. This sounds like a strategy to avoid being exploited. Like, if a country's not willing to go through the democratic process and face penalties, they won't ally. That's a form of strategic alliance prevention, which is an external strategy.

Option D: Expel foreign workers and restrict borders. That sounds like a security measure to prevent foreign threats. Like, if migrants come from powerful countries, the country might send back people who don't want to be targeted. That's a security measure, perhaps an external one.

Now, the question is about external strategies. External strategies are those that involve external influence, manipulation, etc., not internal threats. So, options B and D seem to be internal security measures, not external.

So, the correct external strategies would be A and C.

Wait, but the question is about what elites employ. So, external strategies would involve manipulating outside factors, not necessarily internal threats.

So, let's eliminate B and D because they're more about internal security. So, the remaining options are A and C.

Option C: Weak states avoid alliances because it's conditional on democratization and risk penalties. This is about avoiding being exploited by powerful countries, which is an external strategy. Because the weak state wants to avoid the risk of being controlled if they go to a powerful country.

Option A is about economic manipulation, which is more about economic control. It's possible, but perhaps a bit more specific.

So, the answer could be either A or C. But the question is about external strategies. So, A is about economic manipulation, which is an external strategy, and C is about alliance prevention, which is also an external strategy.

Wait, but the options are asking for what external strategies "elites" employ. So, perhaps both A and C are correct. But the options are exclusive, so I need to see which one is more likely.

Looking back, the question is about strategies that the elites use. So, A is about economic manipulation, which is a common external strategy. C is about alliance prevention, which is also a form of external strategy.

But the question is about what external strategies, so both A and C seem correct. However, the answer options are separate, so I need to pick the best fit.

Wait, the answer options are A, B, C, D. So, the question is which one is correct.

The question is, what strategies do elites use. So, the correct answer is either A or C.

Wait, but looking again, option C says "Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met." That's a form of alliance prevention, which is an external strategy.

Option A is about economic manipulation, which is external as well.

But the question is about what external strategies. So, both A and C are correct, but the options don't let me choose both. So, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, the options are exclusive, but the question is asking for what external strategies. So, perhaps both are correct, but I need to pick the correct one among the options provided.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific context of the question. The term "elites" here refers to powerful groups. So, when they employ external strategies, perhaps A is the best fit because it's about economic manipulation, which is a direct way elites manipulate their power.

Option C is about alliance prevention, which is also a strategy, but perhaps it's more about avoiding being exploited rather than directly manipulating power.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, but I think the answer is A. Because the question is about what external strategies (manipulation of external factors) the elites use. So, the correct answer is A: manipulation of currency or sanctions.

But I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought about C, but maybe C is about alliance prevention, which is a form of external strategy.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the question is about the "strategies" ( tactics) the elites use. So, "elites may also use economic strategies..." which is an option. So, A is about manipulating, which is an economic manipulation, and C is about alliance prevention, which is a form of external strategy.

Wait, but the question is about what external strategies they employ. So, both A and C are external strategies. But the options are exclusive, so perhaps the correct answer is A, as it's about manipulation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me try another approach. The term "elites" refers to powerful groups. They would employ various strategies, including economic ones. So, option A is about manipulating currency or imposing sanctions, which is a way to maintain power and control. That's an external strategy.

Option C is about avoiding alliances, which is also an external strategy to prevent being exploited.

But the question is about "what external strategies do elites employ", so both A and C seem correct. However, perhaps C is more about alliance prevention, which is a form of external strategy, and A is about economic manipulation, another form.

Wait, looking at the options again, the correct answer is either A or C. But the options are separate. So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. The question is about what external strategies the elites employ. So, the options are about what they do. So, the correct answer is either A or C.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: weak states avoid alliances because it's conditional on democratization and risk penalties. That's an external strategy (avoiding being exploited).

Option A is about economic strategies, which is also external.

But the question is about what external strategies. So, both A and C are external, but perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, I think I remember that in some contexts, "elites" use economic strategies to manipulate. So, option A would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each option states.

Option A: manipulation of currency or imposing sanctions.

Option C: weak states avoid alliances because alliances and assistance are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met.

So, option C is about alliance prevention, which is a form of external strategy, not economic.

So, the answer could be either A or C. But the question is about what external strategies.

Wait, but the question is about the strategies they employ. So, both A and C are correct in the sense they are external strategies.

But the options are exclusive, so perhaps the correct answer is A because it's about economic manipulation.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, another angle: the question is about what the elites do. They are powerful groups, so they would use strategies to maintain their power. So, economic manipulation (A) is one way. Alternatively, the option C is about alliance prevention, which is another way.

But the question is about external strategies. So, both A and C are correct, but in the options, perhaps A is more about manipulation, which is a strategy to control others.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C. Because the question is about the strategies that the elites use to avoid being exploited. Like, if a country is going to ally with a powerful country, they might send out people who don't want to be targeted. That's an external strategy to prevent being exploited.

So, option C is about alliance prevention, which is an external strategy. So, the answer is C.

Wait, but another thought: option A is about economic manipulation, which is a form of external strategy. But the question is about what they employ. So, both A and C are correct, but the options are exclusive.

Wait, maybe the answer is A. Because the question is about what they do, which includes economic manipulation. So, A is correct. But I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C. Because option C is about avoiding alliances, which is a form of external strategy to prevent being exploited.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find the correct answer.

I remember that in historical contexts, sometimes powerful nations use economic means to influence others. So, option A is plausible.

Alternatively, the answer is C because it's about alliance prevention, which is an external strategy.

Wait, but the question is about what the elites do, and both A and C are correct. But since the options are exclusive, perhaps the intended answer is C. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Because the question is about what they employ, which includes economic manipulation.

Wait, another approach: the term "elites" could refer to general powerful groups. So, when they employ strategies, they might use both economic ones and others. But the options are separate, so perhaps only one is correct.

I think the intended answer is A. Because the question is about what they do, and A is about economic manipulation, which is a way they employ external strategies. Option C is about alliance prevention, which is also an external strategy, but perhaps it's more about avoiding being exploited, which is a form of manipulation.

Wait, I'm not certain. I think the correct answer is A: Elites may also use economic strategies, such as the manipulation of currency or the imposition of sanctions, to maintain their power and control.
</think>

The question asks about the external strategies used by elites. External strategies involve manipulating external factors to maintain control. Option A discusses economic strategies like currency manipulation or sanctions, which are external. Option C talks about alliance prevention, which is also an external strategy. However, the question specifies "external strategies," and both A and C are valid. 

To determine the best answer, consider that elites might employ economic manipulation (A) as a direct form of external strategy. Additionally, alliance prevention (C) is another form of external strategy. However, the question's focus on economic manipulation makes A the likely intended answer.

ANSWER: A
