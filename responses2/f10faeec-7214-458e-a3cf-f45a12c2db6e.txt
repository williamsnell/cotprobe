Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically homomorphisms between groups. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question has two statements and asks about their truthfulness. The options are A through J, each giving different combinations of the statements being true or not.

Statement 1: A homomorphism may have an empty kernel.
Statement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.

I need to evaluate each statement's validity.

First, Statement 1. A homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that map to the identity element of the target group. The kernel is a normal subgroup of the source group. The question is whether the kernel can be empty.

If the kernel is empty, that means only the identity element maps to the identity. So the homomorphism is injective because the kernel is trivial. But for a homomorphism, the kernel must be a normal subgroup. Now, the trivial group is a normal subgroup of any group.

An example comes to mind. Consider the trivial homomorphism from any group to the trivial group. The trivial group has only the identity, so the homomorphism maps every element of the original group to the identity, making the kernel the entire group. Wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, the trivial homomorphism maps everything to the identity, so the kernel would be the entire group, which can't be empty. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, perhaps Statement 1 is incorrect. Let me think again. If the kernel is empty, that would mean the homomorphism is injective. But can a non-trivial group have a homomorphism with an empty kernel? Like, suppose the source group is non-trivial. Then the kernel can't be empty if the homomorphism is non-trivial. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the statement is true. For example, consider a homomorphism from the integers (which is a group under addition) to another group. Let's say the target group is the integers modulo 2, which is cyclic of order 2. The homomorphism could be mapping each integer to 0 mod 2. The kernel here is all even integers, which is a non-trivial normal subgroup. Wait, that's not empty. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing this correctly.

Wait, maybe another example. Suppose we have a group G and a normal subgroup N of G. Then the quotient group G/N is a group. The natural projection from G to G/N is a surjective homomorphism with kernel N. But that's a non-empty kernel. So, if the kernel is empty, that would imply that the homomorphism is injective, which would require that the kernel is trivial. But for that to happen, the homomorphism must be injective. So, for any group G, can we have a homomorphism from G to another group that is injective and has empty kernel? That would require that the kernel is only the identity element. But the only way that can happen is if the kernel is trivial, which implies that the homomorphism is injective. So, if such a homomorphism exists, the kernel must be trivial, making Statement 1 True.

Wait, but wait. Let's think of a specific example. Let G be any non-trivial group. Suppose we have a homomorphism φ: G → H, where H is another group. If φ is injective, then the kernel of φ is trivial. So, such a homomorphism exists. For example, the inclusion map from a group to itself is always injective. So, yes, Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.

Wait, a nontrivial homomorphism is one that isn't the zero map (unless the group is trivial). So, for example, a homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group. Let's think: can we have such a homomorphism?

Yes, for example, consider G being a finite group, say the cyclic group of order 2, and H being the infinite cyclic group. Then, the homomorphism φ could map the generator to 1 (in the integers), which is a nontrivial homomorphism. The kernel would be trivial, making it a trivial homomorphism. Wait, but that's a nontrivial map with kernel {e}. So, it is possible.

But wait, the statement says "it is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group." So if such a homomorphism exists, then Statement 2 is false. But wait, in my previous example, the homomorphism is nontrivial but the kernel is trivial. So, the kernel is {e}, which is trivial. So, it is possible.

But wait, the question says Statement 2: it is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism. So if in reality, it is possible, then Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the statement is: "It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group."

Wait, so let's parse this. The statement is asserting that for all finite groups G and for all infinite groups H, there doesn't exist a nontrivial homomorphism from G to H. But the way it's phrased, "some finite group into some infinite group" implies that there exists at least one pair of finite G and infinite H where a nontrivial homomorphism exists.

But in fact, such homomorphisms do exist. For example, any finite group can be mapped nontrivially into an infinite group. So the statement is false because such homomorphisms do exist. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of another example. Let G be the group of integers under addition, which is infinite, and H be, say, the additive group of rationals. Then, can we have a homomorphism from a finite group to the rationals? Wait, no, because the rationals are a divisible group, and finite groups have elements of finite order. So, any homomorphism from a finite group to a torsion group (like the group of rationals) must have trivial kernel. Because if the homomorphism sends any element of the finite group to an element of order dividing some number, but the group itself doesn't have elements of that order unless the homomorphism is trivial.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because consider G as, say, the cyclic group of order 2, and H as the additive group of rationals. Then, any map from G to H would be determined by where you send the generator. If you map the generator to a non-zero rational number, then the image would have order 1 (since 2 times the image is zero). But wait, the image of the group would be a cyclic subgroup of order 1 or 2. But the kernel would be the set of elements that map to zero. So, if you map the generator to a non-zero element, then the kernel is only the identity element. So, the kernel is trivial, so the homomorphism is injective, hence nontrivial. So, in this case, there exists a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group (cyclic of order 2) into an infinite group (rationals). Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but that would mean that Statement 2 is False. But earlier I thought about G being the integers and H being the rationals, but that's not applicable here, because the integers aren't a finite group. So, the point is, there do exist nontrivial homomorphisms from finite groups into infinite groups. So, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait again. The statement is: "It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group."

If it's possible, then the statement is false. So, Statement 2 is false.

So, now, back to Statements:

Statement 1: True.

Statement 2: False.

Now, looking at the options:

Looking for a combination of Statement 1 True and Statement 2 False. Let's see the options.

Options:

A: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is not given.

B: Both statements are true, but contradict each other.

C: Both statements are not given.

D: False, True.

E: True, False.

F: False, not given.

G: False, False.

H: True, True.

I: True, False.

J: False, not given.

Wait, the options are A to J, each about the given statements.

So, our assessment is Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Looking at the options, which option says Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.

Looking at the options:

Looking for True for 1, False for 2.

Option E says "True, False".

Option E: E: True, False.

So, the correct answer should be E.
</think>

The question requires evaluating the truthfulness of two statements about group homomorphisms. Here's the analysis:

1. **Statement 1**: A homomorphism may have an empty kernel. This is **True** because a homomorphism with an empty kernel is injective, which is possible for a non-trivial group.

2. **Statement 2**: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group. This is **False** because examples exist (e.g., finite group to infinite group with a non-trivial image), so such homomorphisms do exist.

The correct option is **E: True, False**, indicating Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.
