Question:

The rotational inertia of an object is greater when most of the mass is located

Options:

A: at the ends of the object
B: on the rotational axis
C: at the bottom of the object
D: in the center of the object
E: at the top of the object
F: near the rotational axis
G: equally distributed throughout the object
H: away from the axis
I: at one side of the object
J: off center

Okay, so I've got this physics question about rotational inertia. Hmm, I need to figure out which position of mass leads to the greatest rotational inertia. Rotational inertia, right, that's the moment of inertia. I remember that moment of inertia depends on how mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation.

Wait, the question is asking when most of the mass is located. So, I'm thinking about the distribution of mass in a rotating object. Like, if all the mass is right at the center, that should give the smallest moment of inertia because the distance from the axis is zero. Oh, right, I remember that the moment of inertia is calculated as the sum of each mass element multiplied by the square of its distance from the axis. So, I = Σmr².

So, if the mass is spread out more from the center, the further the mass is from the axis, the higher the value of I. That's why objects like rods and rings have higher moments of inertia than solid cylinders because their masses are distributed farther from the center.

Looking at the options: A is at the ends, which would mean the maximum distance from the center. So, that would give the highest I. So the answer should be A: at the ends of the object.

Wait, what about other options? B is on the axis, which is zero distance. So I=0. That's the least. C is at the bottom, but that's not a meaningful difference unless the bottom is a different point. Unless the object is circular, but then the center is where I=0. D is in the center, I=0. E and I are similar to B and D, so I=0. F is near the axis, but that's a small distance, so I would be less than when it's at the ends. G is equally distributed, so I=mr² for each mass. H is away, same as A. J is off-center, which is the same as A.

So the only way to get the highest I is when most of the mass is at the ends. So the correct answer should be A.

The rotational inertia of an object depends on how its mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation. The moment of inertia (I) is calculated as the sum of each mass element multiplied by the square of its distance from the axis (I = Σmr²). 

To maximize rotational inertia, the mass should be as far from the axis as possible. Among the options, placing the most mass at the ends of the object (A) results in the greatest distance from the axis, leading to the highest moment of inertia. Other positions either reduce this distance (B, D, E, F, J) or leave the moment of inertia at zero (B, D, E, F, J). 

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: at the ends of the object**
