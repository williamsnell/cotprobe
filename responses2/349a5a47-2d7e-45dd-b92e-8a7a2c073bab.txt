Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about conjugate acids. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see. The question is asking what the conjugate acid of H2PO4- is. The options are A through J, each a different ion or some variation.

I remember that a conjugate acid is formed when a base gains a proton. So, the process is adding H+ to the base. The base here is H2PO4-. Wait, is that an acid or a base? Oh wait, H2PO4- is an anion, right? Wait no, anion can be either. Let me think about the structure of phosphate ions. Phosphoric acid is H3PO4 (I think that's correct), which dissociates into H+ and H2PO4- in solution. So H2PO4- is acting as a base here because it can accept a proton.

So the conjugate acid of H2PO4- would be H2PO4- plus H+. Let me write that out. H2PO4- + H+ → H3PO4. So the conjugate acid is H3PO4.

Now looking at the options. Let's check them one by one.

Option A: PO4^3-. That's phosphate with three negative charges. Wait, H3PO4 is H3PO4, which is phosphate ion with a charge of -1. So that's phosphate ion, not the conjugate acid. So A is wrong.

Option B: H3PO4^2-. That's a diatomic ion, but I think it's actually written as H3PO4^2-? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Like, H3PO4 is the phosphate ion with a -1 charge. So H3PO4^2- would imply a -2 charge, which would make it more like HPO4^2- or something. But we're looking for H3PO4, which is the triprotic acid.

Option C: H3PO4^3-. That's a triprotic acid, but wait, the conjugate acid is the first step. So that's not the conjugate acid but the second or third. So C is not correct.

Option D: H4PO4-. Wait, H4PO4^-, that's a phosphate with four H. But the conjugate acid would have three H's because the base was H2PO4- (two H's). So D is H4PO4^-, which would be the next conjugate acid, maybe, but no, wait, the conjugate acid of H2PO4- is the first one. So D has four H, which is the third, so no.

Option E: H2PO4-. That's the same as the base, so E is the base, not the conjugate acid.

Option F: H2PO4^3-. Wait, phosphate can't have three H's and a negative charge because H3PO4 is neutral. So F would have a charge of -3, which isn't possible for H2PO4^- because adding H+ would make it positive. Wait, let's think. The conjugate acid would be H3PO4 (if H2PO4^- plus H+ gives H3PO4), which is option I. Because H2PO4^- + H+ → H3PO4 (which is I: H3PO4).

Wait, looking at the options, option I is H3PO4. So the conjugate acid is I. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me read them again.

A: PO4^3- → phosphate(III)
B: H3PO4^2- → phosphate(II) ion?
C: H3PO4^3- → phosphate(III) ion
D: H4PO4^- → phosphate(IV)
E: H2PO4^- → same as base
F: H2PO4^3- → might be a typo, perhaps they meant HPO4^3-?
G: HPO4^2- → that's phosphate(II) anion with one H.
H: H4PO4+ → phosphate(IV) with a positive charge.
I: H3PO4 → correct, the first conjugate acid.
J: H2PO4^2- → phosphate(II) anion but with two H.

So the correct conjugate acid is I: H3PO4.

To determine the conjugate acid of the H₂PO₄⁻ ion, we need to recall that a conjugate acid is formed by adding a proton (H⁺) to a base. The given ion, H₂PO₄⁻, is an anion that can accept a proton, so it acts as a base. Adding H⁺ to H₂PO₄⁻ gives:

\[
\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- + \text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{H}_3\text{PO}_4
\]

Thus, the conjugate acid is H₃PO₄. Now, we evaluate the options:

- **A: PO₄³⁻**  
  This is the phosphate ion with a charge of -3, which is not the conjugate acid of H₂PO₄⁻.

- **B: H₃PO₄²⁻**  
  This is a triply charged phosphate ion, which does not match H₃PO₄, the first conjugate acid.

- **C: H₃PO₄³⁻**  
  This is a triply charged phosphate ion, which is the second conjugate acid of H₂PO₄⁻, not the first.

- **D: H₄PO₄⁻**  
  This is a quadrply charged phosphate ion, which is the third conjugate acid of H₂PO₄⁻, not the first.

- **E: H₂PO₄⁻**  
  This is the same as the base, not the conjugate acid.

- **F: H₂PO₄³⁻**  
  This is not a valid ion for the conjugate acid, as it would imply a charge of -3, which is not possible for H₂PO₄⁻.

- **G: HPO₄²⁻**  
  This is a diatomic ion of phosphate with one hydrogen and a charge of -2, which does not match H₃PO₄.

- **H: H₄PO₄⁺**  
  This is a tetraatomic ion of phosphate with a charge of +1, which is not the conjugate acid.

- **I: H₃PO₄**  
  This is the first conjugate acid of H₂PO₄⁻, formed by adding a proton to H₂PO₄⁻.

- **J: H₂PO₄²⁻**  
  This is a diatomic ion of phosphate with two hydrogens and a charge of -2, which does not match H₃PO₄.

The correct answer is **I: H₃PO₄**.
