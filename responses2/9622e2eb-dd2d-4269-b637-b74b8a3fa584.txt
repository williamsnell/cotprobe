Okay, so I've got a question here about calculating an employee's total earnings. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says the employee worked 43 hours and earns $3.00 per hour. But there's a catch: for more than 40 hours, they get time and a half pay. Hmm, I remember that time and a half is 1.5 times the regular rate. So, let me break it down.

First, the regular hours. The employee worked 43 hours, which is more than 40. So, the first 40 hours are regular time, and the remaining 3 hours are overtime. 

Regular pay: Regular pay is the standard rate multiplied by the regular hours. So, 40 hours * $3.00 per hour. Let's calculate that: 40 * 3 = $120. 

Next, overtime pay: Overtime is 1.5 times the regular rate. So, the overtime rate is 1.5 * $3.00 = $4.50 per hour. The overtime hours are 3, so 3 * $4.50 = $13.50.

Now, adding both parts together: $120 (regular) + $13.50 (overtime) = $133.50.

Looking at the options, option A is $133.50. So, that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

Wait, did I calculate the overtime correctly? 3 hours at $4.50 is indeed $13.50. Regular pay is 40 hours * $3 = $120. Adding them gives $133.50. Hmm, yes, that seems right. 

I don't think I messed up the time and a half calculation. So, the answer is A.

The correct calculation involves regular pay for the first 40 hours and overtime for the additional 3 hours. Regular pay: 40 * 3 = $120. Overtime pay: 3 * (3 * 1.5) = 3 * 4.5 = $13.50. Total: $120 + $13.50 = $133.50. 

Answer: A: $133.50.

Answer: A
