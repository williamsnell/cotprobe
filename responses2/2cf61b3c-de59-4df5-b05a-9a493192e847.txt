Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about collective bargaining, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by breaking down the question and understanding what each option is saying.

The question asks: "Define collective bargaining and give its importance to labor." I know that collective bargaining is a term used in labor relations, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through what I remember.

First, I recall that collective bargaining has to do with negotiations between workers and employers. I think it's a process where employees and employers come together to discuss their interests, perhaps through mediation or arbitration. The goal is usually to find a solution that benefits both parties, like higher wages, better working conditions, or other labor-related benefits.

So looking at the options, I'll go through each one:

Option A: "Collective bargaining is a legal dispute between employees and employers." Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I think it's more about negotiations, not legal disputes. Laws might enforce labor laws, but collective bargaining is a process, not a legal action itself. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: "Collective bargaining is the system through which employers seek concessions from unions." Wait, that seems off. Collective bargaining is about employees and employers, not unions. I thought unions were more about organizing to get better terms or labor rights. So B might be the opposite of what I know.

Option C: "Collective bargaining is a form of employment contract." That doesn't fit. Employment contracts are more like individual agreements, while collective bargaining is about negotiations between two groups. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: "Collective bargaining is a way for workers to demand higher wages." That seems correct. Because the main purpose is to negotiate better wages and conditions, so D sounds accurate.

Option E: "Collective bargaining is a process where individual employees negotiate their contracts separately with the employer." I think that's part of collective bargaining, but it's not the whole process. It's more about the broader negotiation rather than individual efforts. So E might be too narrow.

Option F: "Collective bargaining refers to the governmental intervention in labor disputes." I don't remember that being the definition. It's probably the oppositeâ€”government intervention is more about other mechanisms like labor unions or arbitration, not the direct form of negotiation between employer and employee.

Option G: "Collective bargaining is a term used to describe the setting of industry-wide standards by government bodies." That sounds more like what a labor board does, perhaps, than collective bargaining. I think it's a different concept.

Option H: "Collective bargaining is the approach used by labor organizations to negotiate with employers or their representatives." That makes sense. Labor organizations are involved in collective bargaining to get better deals from employers.

Option I: "Collective bargaining is a strategy used by employers to dictate terms to employees without negotiation." That seems opposite. Without negotiation, it's not collective bargaining. Employers might negotiate, but that's not the definition.

Option J: "Collective bargaining is the unilateral decision-making process by employers regarding work conditions." Wait, this is a bit confusing. Unilateral would mean one side makes the decision, but collective bargaining is a mutual negotiation. So J might be incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. Option H says it's the approach used by labor organizations to negotiate with employers. That's correct because labor organizations are directly involved in the negotiations between employers and employees.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H because it correctly describes the role of labor organizations in the collective bargaining process. They negotiate with both employers and employees, aiming to reach agreements that benefit both.

The correct answer is H: "Collective bargaining is the approach used by labor organizations to negotiate with employers or their representatives." 

**Explanation:** Collective bargaining involves negotiations between workers and employers, typically led by labor organizations. This process aims to reach agreements that benefit both parties, such as higher wages or better working conditions. The key point is that labor organizations play a central role in the negotiations, ensuring that both employers and employees are involved in reaching mutually beneficial agreements.
