Okay, so I'm trying to solve this economics problem about the apple market. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that the apple market is in equilibrium. Now, apple growers are using more pesticides to increase production. So, that's something that affects supply, right? More pesticides would probably increase the supply of apples because more pesticides are being used. So, supply increases, which usually shifts the supply curve to the right.

At the same time, the price of pears is rising. Pears is a substitute for apples, meaning they're similar in production. So, if pears are more expensive, that might affect the demand for apples. Substitutes usually have a negative relationship with demand. So, if pears become more expensive, people might buy less apples because they can get substitute fruits instead. So, that would shift the demand curve to the left.

Wait, but the question is about the new price and quantity of apples. So, we have two shifts: supply increases, demand decreases.

Let me think about each effect. First, increased production (more pesticides) would cause supply to shift right. So, at the same time, pears are more expensive, which would cause demand for apples to decrease, shifting the demand curve to the left.

So, the supply curve moves right and the demand curve moves left. Which of these conditions will lead to what kind of change in equilibrium?

In general, if supply increases and demand decreases, the equilibrium quantity will increase, right? Because the supply is more available, so more apples are supplied. But what about the price?

In the case where both supply increases and demand decreases, what happens? Let me think about the equilibrium. 

Before the change, there was an equilibrium price and quantity. Now, after the changes:

1. Supply increases: More apples are available. So, at the original demand, the quantity would be higher than before, but the price would be lower because the supply is more than what was previously demanded.

2. Demand decreases: At the original supply, the quantity would be lower than before, but the price would be higher because the demand is less.

So, with both of these happening, what's the net effect? The supply curve shifts right, demand shifts left. So, let's imagine the two shifts: the supply curve moves right, and the demand curve moves left.

The equilibrium quantity will be higher because supply is more. But what about the price? The supply increase would lower the price, and the demand decrease would raise the price. So, which effect is stronger?

Hmm, but without knowing the magnitudes, it's a bit tricky. But in general, when both shifts happen, the equilibrium quantity increases, and the equilibrium price is uncertain because it could go either way. Wait, no, not exactly.

Wait, let me think again. When supply increases and demand decreases, the equilibrium quantity will definitely increase because supply is more. But what about the price?

The supply increase would push the price down, and the demand decrease would push it up. So, which effect is stronger? It depends on the relative values of the shifts. But without specific numbers, we can't say for sure. So, in terms of the options given, I think the price could rise or fall, but the quantity definitely rises.

So looking at the options, the options are about the price and quantity. Let's see the options.

Option A: Price ambiguous, quantity rises.

Option C: Quantity rises, price falls.

Option F: Price rises, quantity ambiguous.

Option J: Price falls, quantity rises.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the equilibrium again.

When supply increases (shift to the right) and demand decreases (shift to the left), the equilibrium quantity will definitely increase. So options A, C, F, J, I are out. I is price falls, quantity ambiguous. Those don't seem right.

So, the options narrowing down to A, C, F, J.

Now, what about the price? The supply increase would push the price down, and the demand decrease would push it up. So, the equilibrium price could be higher, lower, or could it stay the same? Or is it ambiguous?

Wait, but generally, if both shifts happen, the equilibrium price could be ambiguous because the supply effect is stronger, the demand effect is stronger, or perhaps they offset each other.

But I'm not sure. Maybe in this case, both shifts are happening, but which effect is stronger? For instance, if supply increases by a larger amount than demand decreases, the price might fall. If demand decreases by a larger amount than supply increases, price might rise.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give us the magnitude of the shifts, so we have to make a general prediction.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction of the price change is ambiguous because it depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts. But none of the options (A, C, F, J) mention ambiguity in price, except option F: price rises, quantity ambiguous.

Wait, option F is "Price rises, but quantity is ambiguous." Hmm, I thought the quantity would definitely rise. So, that's not possible. Because the quantity is definitely going to rise, so options F and J are out.

So, remaining options are A, C, J.

Option J: Price falls, quantity rises.

Option C: Quantity rises, price falls.

Option A: Price ambiguous, quantity rises.

Wait, wait. Let me make this clear.

If supply increases and demand decreases, what happens to price?

When supply increases, the supply curve shifts right. So, at the original demand, the quantity is now higher than before, but the price is lower because supply is higher.

When demand decreases, the demand curve shifts left. So, at the original supply, the quantity would be lower, but the price is higher because demand is lower.

So, the equilibrium quantity is higher than before. What about the price?

In the new equilibrium, the price is somewhere between the new supply curve and the new demand curve. Since supply is higher, the equilibrium price would be lower than before. Because the supply is more, the market can't support a higher price. The demand is lower, so price would be higher than before. So, the equilibrium price is somewhere between the initial price and a lower price.

But without knowing which effect is stronger, we can't say for sure whether the price will rise or fall.

For example, if supply increases by a lot, the price could fall a lot. If demand decreases by a lot, the price could rise a lot. If they're balanced, the price might stay the same.

So, in the absence of specific info, the price is ambiguous—could rise or fall, but in the options, A, C, and J are about price and quantity.

Wait, but in this case, quantity definitely increases. So, options A, C, J.

Wait, no, let me think. The options:

A: Price is ambiguous, quantity rises.

C: Quantity rises, price falls.

J: Price falls, quantity rises.

So, the options are about the two possibilities.

But wait, when supply increases and demand decreases, the equilibrium quantity increases.

So, the correct options are those where quantity rises, so A, C, J.

Now, the price is ambiguous—could fall or rise.

So, which options have quantity rises and price ambiguous? That's option A.

Option C: quantity rises, price falls.

Option J: price falls, quantity rises.

Wait, but the initial analysis suggests that price would fall if the supply increase is more than the demand decrease. But if the demand decrease is more than the supply increase, price would rise.

Wait, but without knowing the magnitude, the equilibrium price is uncertain. So, the price is ambiguous, but quantity definitely rises.

So, the correct answer would be option A: Price is ambiguous, quantity rises.

Wait, but let me think again—could the price fall or rise? If supply increases by a lot, the equilibrium price would fall a lot. If demand decreases by a lot, the price would rise a lot. So, the price is ambiguous because it's either a fall or a rise.

So, the answer should be that quantity rises, and price is ambiguous.

Looking at the options, option A says price is ambiguous, quantity rises. So, A is correct.

So, the answer should be A.

The question involves analyzing the equilibrium of the apple market when apple growers are using more pesticides (increasing supply) and pears, a substitute for apples, are becoming more expensive (decreasing demand). The goal is to determine the new price and quantity of apples.

1. **Supply Increase**: The use of more pesticides by apple growers increases supply, shifting the supply curve to the right. This leads to a higher equilibrium quantity.

2. **Demand Decrease**: Pears are a substitute for apples, and their rising prices reduce demand for apples, shifting the demand curve to the left. This leads to a lower equilibrium quantity if demand decreases alone were the only factor.

3. **Equilibrium Analysis**: Both shifts (supply increase and demand decrease) result in an increase in the equilibrium quantity. However, the equilibrium price is ambiguous because the supply increase would typically lower the price, while the demand decrease would raise it. The direction of the price change depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts, which are not specified.

4. **Options Evaluation**: 
   - **A**: Price is ambiguous, quantity rises. This is correct because the equilibrium quantity increases, but the price is uncertain due to the mixed effects of supply and demand.
   - **C**: Quantity rises, price falls. Incorrect, as the supply increase would lower the price, not raise it.
   - **J**: Price falls, quantity rises. Incorrect, as the demand decrease would typically raise the price, not fall.
   - **F**: Price rises, quantity is ambiguous. Incorrect, as the demand decrease would lower the price, not raise it.
   - **G**: Price rises, quantity falls. Incorrect, as both shifts (supply and demand) increase quantity.
   - **H**: Price is ambiguous, quantity falls. Incorrect, as the demand decrease would raise the price, not fall.
   - **I**: Price falls, quantity ambiguous. Incorrect, as the supply increase would lower the price, not raise it.
   - **D**: Price and quantity both rise. Incorrect, as the demand decrease would lower the quantity, not increase it.
   - **E**: Price and quantity both fall. Incorrect, as the supply increase would lower the price, not raise it.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.
