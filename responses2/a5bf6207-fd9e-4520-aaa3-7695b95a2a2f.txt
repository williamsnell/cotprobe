Okay, so I've got this question here about workers at "K. Industry" and their pay structure. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that workers are paid a bonus if they produce more than 180 microcircuits in a 40-hour workweek. The bonus they get is 50% of the hours saved. They make $2.40 an hour. Now, worker A completed 150 circuits, and worker B did 198. I need to find how much more worker B is paid than worker A.

First, I need to figure out how many microcircuits each worker produced. But wait, the bonus is based on the number of microcircuits, so each worker's bonus depends on their production. So, for each worker, I'll calculate how many extra microcircuits they produced beyond 180, then compute the bonus for each.

Starting with worker A: they made 150 microcircuits. Since 150 is less than 180, they don't get any bonus. So their bonus is zero.

Worker B made 198 microcircuits. So the excess is 198 - 180 = 18 microcircuits. Wait, no, actually, the bonus is paid if they produce more than 180, so the bonus is 50% of the hours saved. So first, I need to find out how many hours each worker worked, but wait, the workweek is 40 hours, but the problem doesn't specify each worker's hours. Wait, wait, the question is about how much more B is paid than A, but each of them worked 40 hours, right? Because all workers in the 40-hour workweek.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says they are paid a bonus if they produce more than 180 in a 40-hour week. So the bonus is based on the number of microcircuits produced within that 40-hour period. So each worker's pay is based on their hourly rate plus any bonus. So I think each worker worked exactly 40 hours, so their pay is 40 hours * $2.40, plus any bonus.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how many hours each worker actually worked. Wait, no, perhaps I misread. The question says worker A completed 150 circuits in a week, and worker B 198. So I think that each worker worked 40 hours, as it's a 40-hour workweek. So I can calculate each of their pay.

For worker A: 150 circuits. Since 150 < 180, no bonus. So pay is 40 * $2.40 = $96.

Worker B: 198 circuits. So 198 - 180 = 18 microcircuits over the threshold. So the bonus is 50% of the hours saved. Wait, but how many hours did each worker save? Because each worked 40 hours, but the bonus is based on the number of hours they saved, which would be the time they didn't produce more than 180. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the hours saved are the number of hours they didn't contribute to the production beyond 180. Or perhaps the bonus is based on how many extra hours they worked beyond producing 180 microcircuits.

Wait, no, I think the bonus is 50% of the hours saved. But each worker worked 40 hours, so perhaps the hours saved is the number of hours they actually worked, because they are paid for each hour. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the hours that they would have worked if they had produced exactly 180 microcircuits. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Let's approach it this way: each worker's pay is based on their hourly rate plus any bonus. The bonus is 50% of the hours saved, which I think refers to the number of hours they didn't earn extra pay for. Wait, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of hours they saved, where 'saved' is the hours they worked beyond the point where they would have produced 180 microcircuits.

Alternatively, maybe the bonus is 50% of the hours they saved, where saved is the number of hours they could have worked without producing more than 180 microcircuits. Or perhaps 'saved' refers to the hours they didn't work, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of hours saved, where 'saved' is the number of hours they would have contributed if they produced exactly 180 microcircuits. So, for worker B, let's calculate how many hours they would have worked to produce exactly 180 microcircuits.

Wait, but the hourly rate is $2.40, so each hour they work, they produce 1 microcircuit (since $2.40 per microcircuit). So to produce 180 microcircuits, they would need 180 hours. But that's way beyond the 40-hour workweek. So perhaps the bonus is calculated based on the number of microcircuits they produced over 180, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of hours saved relative to the production of 180. Or perhaps the bonus is based on the number of extra microcircuits they produced, but that's probably not.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the hours saved relative to the 40-hour limit. Alternatively, maybe the bonus is 50% of the number of hours saved, where 'saved' is the number of hours they would have worked if they produced exactly 180 microcircuits, but that's more than 40 hours, which isn't possible. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of hours saved, where 'saved' refers to the number of hours worked beyond the 180 microcircuit production. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each hour they work, they produce one microcircuit. So to produce 180, they need 180 hours. But they only work 40, so let's see: 40 hours * 1 microcircuit/hour = 40 microcircuits. But they need 180, so they're short by 140 microcircuits. So they didn't save any hours because they didn't work enough hours. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of the bonus as 50% of the extra microcircuits produced. Since the bonus is 50% of the hours saved, but saved hours are the number of hours they worked beyond the threshold. But I'm not getting anywhere. Let's try a different approach.

The bonus is 50% of the hours saved. Hours saved would be the number of hours worked beyond the point of meeting the 180 microcircuits requirement. Wait, but each hour they work, they get 1 microcircuit. So to get 180 microcircuits, they need 180 hours. If they work 40 hours, they produce 40 microcircuits, which is below 180. So they don't have any saved hours. So their bonus is zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem states that they are paid a bonus if they produce more than 180. So perhaps the bonus is based on the number of hours they could have saved by producing more than 180. Wait, perhaps the hours saved are the number of hours they worked beyond what they would have produced 180 microcircuits. Since each hour gives 1 microcircuit, to produce 180, it's 180 hours. So if a worker works 40 hours, they produce 40 microcircuits, so they could have produced 140 more microcircuits by working 180 hours. So the 'saved' hours would be 180-40=140 hours. So the bonus is 50% of 140 hours, which is 70 hours. But wait, that doesn't make sense because 50% of 140 is 70, but that would mean 70 hours saved, but the bonus is 50% of the hours saved, which would be 35.

Wait, no, perhaps the hours saved are the hours they didn't produce more than 180. So, if they produced 198 microcircuits, that's 18 over 180. So the bonus would be 50% of the hours they would have worked to produce 180. Wait, but that's 180 microcircuits, so 180 hours. They worked 40 hours, so they saved 180 - 40 = 140 hours. So 50% of that would be 70 hours saved, but that doesn't make sense because 70 is more than the hours worked. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the bonus is 50% of the number of extra microcircuits they produced beyond 180. So for worker A: 150 - 180 = negative, so 0. For worker B: 198-180 = 18. So the bonus is 18 * 0.5 = 9 microdollars. Then, the bonus is 9, but the hourly rate is 2.40. So total pay is 40*2.40 + 9 = 96 +9= 105. Now, what about worker A's pay? They didn't get a bonus, so 40*2.40=96. So the difference is 105 -96=9. But 9 isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the bonus structure. The bonus is 50% of the hours saved, where 'saved' is the number of hours they would have worked if they produced exactly 180 microcircuits. But since they worked 40 hours and each hour gives 1 microcircuit, to produce 180, they need 180 hours. So saved hours would be 180 (to get 180) minus what they actually worked (40). So saved hours = 140. Then, the bonus is 50% of 140, which is 70. So the bonus is 70 * $2.40 = $168. So worker B's total pay is 40*2.40 +168 = 96 +168= 264.

Worker A: produced 150 microcircuits. Since 150 <180, no bonus. So pay is 40*2.40=96.

Difference: 264 -96=168. But wait, 168 isn't one of the options. So perhaps this is wrong.

Wait, maybe the bonus is calculated differently. Let's read the question again: "The premium paid is 50% of the hours saved." So perhaps the bonus is based on the number of hours saved, which is the number of hours they didn't earn the bonus for. Alternatively, the bonus is 50% of the hours saved, where saved is the number of hours they could have worked if they produced more than 180.

Wait, perhaps the hours saved is the number of hours they could have worked beyond what they needed to produce 180. So, since each microcircuit takes 1 hour, to produce 180, they need 180 hours. But they only worked 40, so they didn't save any hours. So saved hours = 180 -40=140. Then bonus is 50% of 140 hours, which is 70. So 70 * $2.40 = $168.

So for worker B: 40h * $2.40 = $96, plus $168 bonus = $264.

Worker A: 150 microcircuits. 150 <180, so no bonus. 40h * $2.40 = $96.

Difference: $264 - $96 = $168, but the options don't have 168. The options are A:4.8, B:12, etc. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct formula. Let me think again: the bonus is 50% of the hours saved, where saved is the number of hours they would have worked if they had produced exactly 180 microcircuits. Since each microcircuit takes 1 hour, to produce 180, they need 180 hours. So saved hours is 180 -40=140. So 50% of 140 is 70. So the bonus for B is 70 * $2.40= $168.

Worker A's pay: 150 microcircuits. Since less than 180, no bonus. So 40h * $2.40 = $96.

Difference: $168 - $0 (since A didn't get a bonus) = $168. But the options don't have 168. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe the bonus is based on the number of microcircuits they produced beyond 180, but that's not the case. Or perhaps the hours saved is the number of hours they could have worked at a higher rate, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the bonus is 50% of the number of microcircuits produced beyond 180. So worker B produced 198, which is 18 more than 180. So 18 * 0.5=9 microdollars. Then, the bonus is $9.

Worker A's pay: 150. No bonus, so $96.

Difference: $9 - $0 = $9. But 9 isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is calculated as 50% of the number of hours saved, where saved is the number of hours they could have saved by working more hours to reach 180. So to produce 180 microcircuits, they need 180 hours. They worked 40, so saved hours are 180-40=140. Bonus is 50% of 140 =70 hours. So 70 *2.40= $168 bonus.

So worker B's total pay is 40*2.40 +168=96+168=264.

Worker A: 150 microcircuits, less than 180. So pay is 40*2.40=96.

Difference:264-96=168. But the options don't include 168. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the bonus is 50% of the number of microcircuits produced beyond 180. So worker B: 198-180=18. Bonus is 18 *0.5=9. Worker A: 150-180= -30, no bonus. So A's pay is 96. B's pay is 96 +9=105. Difference is 9. But 9 isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of microcircuits over 180. So worker B:18 microcircuits, 18 *0.5=9. So B's pay is 96 +9=105. A's pay is 96. So difference is 9. But no option is 9.

Alternatively, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of hours saved, where saved is the number of hours they worked to produce exactly 180. But they worked 40 hours, so saved hours are 40. 50% of 40 is 20. So 20 *2.4=48. So B's bonus is 48, so pay is 40*2.4 +48=96+48=144. A's pay is 96. Difference is 48. Which is option D: $48. But that's if the bonus is 50% of the hours they saved, where saved is the number of hours they would have worked to get 180. But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the hours saved is the number of hours they worked beyond the 180 microcircuit threshold. So to get 180, they need 180 hours. They worked 40, so saved hours are 180-40=140. Bonus is 50% of 140, which is 70. So 70*2.4=168. So B's pay is 96+168=264. A's pay is 96. Difference is 168, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of microcircuits produced beyond 180. So B:18, 18*0.5=9. So B's pay is 40*2.40 +9=96+9=105. A's pay is 96. Difference is 9, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Let me compute the bonus for each worker based on the number of microcircuits they produced:

Worker A: 150 microcircuits. They don't qualify for the bonus (since it's less than 180). So pay is 40 * 2.40 = $96.

Worker B:198 microcircuits. They qualify. So the bonus is 50% of the hours saved. But wait, hours saved would be the 180 microcircuits threshold. They worked 40, so they could have worked 140 more to reach 180. But that's not possible because they worked 40. Alternatively, perhaps the hours saved is the number of hours they didn't produce the extra microcircuits, which is 40 hours. So maybe the bonus is 50% of 40 hours, which is 20. So 20 *2.40=48. So B's pay is 40*2.40+48=96+48=144. A's pay is 96. Difference is 48. Which is option D.

But why would the bonus be based on the number of hours saved, where saved is the number of hours they worked? That seems backward.

Alternatively, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of microcircuits produced beyond 180. So B:18 microcircuits, 18 *0.5=9. So B's pay is 40*2.40 +9=96+9=105. A's pay is 96. Difference is 9, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of microcircuits produced. So worker B:198, 198 *0.5=99 microdollars. But that's more than the options.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options. The options are A:4.8, B:12, C:24, D:48, E:96.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of microcircuits produced. So worker B:198 microcircuits. 198 * 0.5=99. But 99 isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of hours saved, where saved is the number of hours they would have worked if they produced 180 microcircuits. So to produce 180, they need 180 hours. So saved hours are 180-40=140. 50% of 140 is70. So B's bonus is70*2.40=168. A's pay is 96. So difference is168-96=72. But 72 isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of microcircuits produced. So worker B:198 microcircuits, 198 *0.5=99 microdollars. But worker A: 150, 150 *0.5=75. So the difference is 24, which is option C. But that doesn't match the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the bonus is 50% of the number of microcircuits over 180. So worker B:198-180=18, 18*0.5=9. So their bonus is $9. Worker A:150-180=-30, no bonus. So A's pay is 96, B's pay is 96+9=105. Difference is 9. But 9 isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the bonus is calculated as the number of microcircuits produced beyond 180, multiplied by the bonus percentage. So B:18 microcircuits, 18 *0.5=9. So B's bonus is $9. A has no bonus. So their pay difference is $9, but no option is available.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the correct calculation.

Each worker's pay is calculated as:

Pay = (40 * $2.40) + bonus

Where bonus = 50% of the number of microcircuits produced beyond 180, but only for those who produced more than 180.

So for worker A: produced 150, which is less than 180, so no bonus. Pay = 40*2.40=96.

Worker B: produced 198, which is 18 more than 180. So bonus is 0.5 *18=9. Pay=40*2.40 +9=96+9=105.

Difference:105 -96=9. But 9 isn't an option.

Wait, but maybe the bonus is based on the number of microcircuits produced beyond 180, but multiplied by the bonus percentage. So worker B:198-180=18 microcircuits, 18 *0.5=9. So bonus is $9. So worker B's pay is 40*2.40 +9=96+9=105. So the difference is $9. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the question again: "The premium paid is 50% of the hours saved." So the bonus is 50% of the hours saved. So maybe the hours saved is the number of hours they worked, and the bonus is 50% of that.

So let's recalculate:

Worker A: produced 150, so no bonus. Pay:40*2.40=96.

Worker B: produced 198. So the number of hours saved is 40 (since they worked 40 hours to get 40 microcircuits). So the bonus is 50% of 40 hours, which is 20 hours. So 20 hours saved, but each hour is 1 microcircuit. So 20 microcircuits saved. So the bonus is 20 *2.40=48. So worker B's pay is 40*2.40 +48=96+48=144.

So the difference between B and A is 144 -96=48. So the answer is D: $48.

Ah! That makes sense. So the hours saved are the number of hours the worker worked. Because each hour, the worker produced 1 microcircuit. So if the worker worked 40 hours, they produced 40 microcircuits. So the number of hours saved is the number of hours they worked. So the bonus is 50% of the number of hours they worked. So for worker B, 50% of 40 is 20, multiplied by 2.40 is 48. So their pay is 96 +48=144. So the difference is 48.

So the correct answer is D: $48.
</think>

The bonus is calculated as 50% of the number of hours worked. For worker B, who worked 40 hours, the bonus is:

{ 40 * 2.40 * 0.5 } = 48.

Worker A's pay is:

{ 40 * 2.40 } = 96.

The difference between worker B's and worker A's pay is:

{ 48 - 96 } = -48.

However, since the question asks for the amount by which worker B's pay exceeds worker A's, the correct answer is:

{ 48 }.

ANSWER: D
