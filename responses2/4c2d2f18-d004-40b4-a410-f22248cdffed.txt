Okay, so I have this linear algebra problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that both A and B are n-by-n matrices. The rank of A is n, which I remember means that A is invertible because if the rank is full, it has full row and column rank. So A has an inverse. 

Then it says rank(A*B) is 0. Wait, what does that mean? I think rank zero implies that the matrix A*B is the zero matrix. Because the only matrix with rank zero is the zero matrix itself. So A multiplied by B equals the zero matrix.

Now, the question is asking for the rank of B. So I need to figure out what the rank of matrix B is, given these conditions.

Let me think about the properties here. Since A is invertible, perhaps I can manipulate the equation A*B = 0 to find something about B. If A is invertible, I can multiply both sides by A inverse on the left. So, A inverse * A * B = A inverse * 0. That simplifies to B = 0. Because the identity matrix times B is B, and the right side is zero.

Wait, but if B is the zero matrix, then its rank is zero. Because the zero matrix has all entries zero, so every column is a zero vector, which means the column space is just the zero vector, so the rank is zero.

But wait, the options don't have zero as one of the choices. Let me check the options again.

Looking back: options A to J. Oh wait, I see option A is 0.0, which is zero. So the rank of B would be zero, which is option A. But wait, the problem says rank(A*B) is zero, which leads to B being zero matrix, so rank(B) is zero.

But wait, let me double-check. Another approach: if A is invertible, then the rank of A is n. The rank of A multiplied by B is zero, but since A is invertible, then AB=0 implies that B has to be the zero matrix. Because if AB=0 and A is invertible, then B must be zero. Because you can multiply both sides by A inverse: B = A^{-1} * 0 = 0.

So, B is the zero matrix, so rank(B) is zero. So the correct answer should be option A: 0.0.

Wait, but the options are letters. Let me check the options again:

A: 0.0
B: Undefined
C: 2
D: n-1
E: n+1
F: 1.0
G: 3
H: n/2
I: n-2
J: n

So yes, the correct answer is A: 0.0.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Because I'm a bit confused. Another angle: if rank(A) is n, and A is invertible, then the rank of any product A*B can't exceed the rank of B. But since A is invertible, the rank of A*B is equal to the rank of B. So if rank(A*B)=0, then rank(B)=0.

Yes, that makes sense. So B must be the zero matrix, so rank(B)=0. So the correct answer is A.

The correct answer is A: 0.0.
