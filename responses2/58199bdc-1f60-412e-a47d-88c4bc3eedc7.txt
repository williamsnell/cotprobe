Question:

In a clinical trial, 30 sickle cell anemia patients are randomly assigned to two groups. One group receives the currently marketed medicine, and the other group receives an experimental medicine. Each week, patients report to the clinic where blood tests are conducted. The lab technician is unaware of the kind of medicine the patient is taking. This design can be described as

Options:

A: a completely randomized design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments
B: a completely randomized design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two blocks
C: a matched-pairs design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine forming a pair
D: a double-blind design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments
E: a factorial design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two factors
F: a randomized block design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two blocks
G: a crossover design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments
H: a randomized block design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments
I: a matched-pairs design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two blocks
J: a single-blind design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a clinical trial design. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says there are 30 sickle cell anemia patients divided into two groups. One group gets the current medicine, the other gets an experimental one. Each week, they report to the clinic for blood tests. The lab technician doesn't know which medicine each patient is taking.

I need to figure out what kind of design this is. The options are A to J, each describing a different experimental design.

First, let me recap what each design means.

- Completely randomized design: All subjects are randomly assigned to treatments. There's no blocking or pairing. Each patient is in a random group, and they don't know which treatment they're getting. That fits the scenario here. Because the lab technician is unaware of the medicine, so they're assigning randomly.

- Completely randomized design is option A. The other options are talking about different designs.

Option B: Completely randomized with two blocks. Wait, blocks are used in some designs, like matched-pairs or when you have a blocking variable. Blocks are usually when you have specific groups that are similar. But in this case, the lab technician doesn't know which medicine the patient is taking. So blocking by treatment isn't applicable here. So B is probably not correct.

Option C: Matched-pairs design. That would involve pairing subjects based on some characteristic, like their condition or previous treatments. But the lab is unaware of the treatments, so it's more random assignment.

Option D: Double-blind design. That's when both the patients and the medical staff are unaware of the treatments. In this question, the lab technician is unaware, but patients are. So it's partially blind. So D is not correct because it's not completely blind.

Option E: Factorial design. That's when two or more treatments are applied to the same subjects, each in different conditions. The question is about two different treatments, so E is out.

Option F: Randomized block design. This is when you group subjects into blocks based on a characteristic, then randomly assign within each block. But in this case, the blocks would be based on treatment, but the technician doesn't know which treatment each person is getting, so you don't have any blocks in this scenario. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Crossover design. That's when each subject receives both treatments in a sequence. But this trial doesn't involve crossover; each patient gets only one treatment. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Randomized block design with two treatments as blocks. So, again, the blocks would be based on treatment, but without knowing which treatment each person takes, you can't form blocks. So H is not the right fit.

Option I: Matched-pairs design with two treatments as blocks. No, again, blocks are about grouping, not about treatments. So I's not correct.

Option J: Single-blind design. Single blind is when patients are unaware of treatment. But in this case, the lab technician is unaware, but the patients are. So it's double-blind, but J is single. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the design when the lab technician knows which group each patient is in but not the treatment. So, the patients are randomly assigned, and the lab is unaware of the medicine. So the design is random assignment, which is completely randomized. That's option A.

So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes in crossover designs, the same subjects receive both treatments, but in this case, it's two separate groups. So each group gets only one treatment. So it's a completely randomized design, not a crossover.

Alternatively, if the lab technician knew, it would be double blind, but here, the technician doesn't know. So the design is completely randomized, option A.

The clinical trial described involves 30 sickle cell anemia patients randomly assigned to two groups, with each group receiving a different treatment. The lab technician is unaware of which treatment each patient is taking. This design is characterized by random assignment without any blocking or pairing, as each patient's treatment is unknown to the lab technician. 

- **Option A**: A completely randomized design, with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments. This fits the scenario perfectly since the assignment is random, and the lab technician does not know the treatment each patient is receiving.

Other options incorrectly describe different experimental designs, such as blocking, double-blind, crossover, or single-blind, which do not apply here. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
