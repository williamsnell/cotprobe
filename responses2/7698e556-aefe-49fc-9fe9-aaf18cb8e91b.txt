Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Lyotard's dictum. Hmm, I remember that Lyotard was a French philosopher known for his work on semiotics and postmodernism. But wait, what exactly was his dictum about?

The question says: "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives." So I think that means postmodernism is about being really surprised or not accepting meta-narratives. Meta-narratives are like higher-level narratives that build on lower ones, right? So, if something isn't credible because meta-narratives don't work, then it's considered postmodern.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says postmodernism disregards individual stories. That doesn't quite fit because the dictum is about meta-narratives, not individual stories. So probably not A.

Option B: Universal values are meaningless. That doesn't seem right either. The dictum is about meta-narratives, which are higher-level, not necessarily universal values. Plus, I thought meta-narratives are about how stories are built, not fundamental values. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Literature reproduces repression. I'm not too familiar with this one. I know postmodernism often deals with repression, but the dictum is about the lack of credibility in meta-narratives, not exactly how literature reproduces repression. Maybe C is incorrect, but I'm not sure.

Option D: The concept of truth is objective and undeniable. No, I don't think Lyotard agreed with that. He talked a lot about the subjective nature of meaning and truth. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: The law is static. That doesn't seem related. Postmodernism and Lyotard are more about stories and meaning, not laws. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F: Individual stories are suspect. Wait, the dictum is about meta-narratives, not individual stories. So this option seems to be about individual stories, which doesn't match. Hmm, but F is about stories being suspect, which is a part of meta-narratives. So F might be related, but the question is about the dictum itself, not the underlying issues of stories.

Option G: Postmodernism promotes acceptance of all narratives. Wait, if the dictum is about not accepting meta-narratives, then promoting all might be the opposite. So G isn't right.

Option H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. Again, that doesn't align with the dictum. The dictum is about meta-narratives, not rejecting authority.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate. The dictum is about meta-narratives being doubted. So it's saying that when meta-narratives aren't credible, the story isn't postmodern. So what does that mean? It suggests that stories that rely on higher-level narratives that aren't well understood are considered out of the question. So perhaps these stories aren't accepted as part of the narrative structure, which is a form of meta-narrative.

In that case, if the dictum is about not accepting meta-narratives, then the concept of postmodernism would be that these higher-level narratives aren't credible, so the stories they're built upon are not accepted. So the term 'meta-narrative' here refers to higher-level structures.

Looking back at the options, option F says individual stories are suspect. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about the meaning of the dictum. So the dictum defines postmodernism as being resistant to meta-narratives. So in other words, postmodernism doesn't accept the use or reliance on higher-level narratives.

Oh, wait, maybe the postmodernism itself is about rejecting meta-narratives. So the term 'meta-narrative' in the dictum refers to the kind of narrative where stories are built upon other stories. So if you can't accept such narratives, the stories they are based on aren't considered postmodern.

So, is F about individual stories being suspect, or is it about the stories being part of meta-narrative that are not accepted? I think F is about individual stories being suspect in the sense that they don't exist on their own, but the dictum is about whether meta-narratives are credible.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each option in the context of the dictum. The dictum is about not taking meta-narratives seriously. So, if meta-narratives are not credible, then the stories that rely on them are not considered postmodern. So the concept of postmodernism is that stories are built without meta-narratives, or that meta-narratives are not used.

Looking at the options, option F says individual stories are suspect. That doesn't directly relate to the dictum about meta-narratives. Alternatively, maybe the dictum is about not accepting higher-level narratives, so the stories they're based on aren't considered as part of the narrative structure, thus being suspect.

Alternatively, perhaps the dictum is about the lack of meta-narratives. So if meta-narratives aren't used, then the stories that don't rely on them are considered. So maybe the dictum is implying that stories without meta-narratives are considered postmodern. So the idea that meta-narratives are not accepted, meaning that stories they build are not part of the narrative structure, thus being a form of meta-narrative rejection.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because the dictum is about the lack of meta-narratives, which could mean that individual stories are not considered as part of the narrative structure, hence being suspect or not accepted.

Alternatively, another approach: Lyotard's concept of meta-narrative is about higher-level structures. So without meta-narratives, stories can't be built upon, which makes them more vulnerable, thus considered postmodern. So the dictum says to not take meta-narratives seriously.

So which option aligns with that? Option F: individual stories are suspect. That refers to individual narratives, not the structure. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the dictum is about not accepting meta-narratives, so the stories that can't be built upon meta-narratives are considered postmodern. So, in that case, the concept is that stories that rely on meta-narratives are not accepted, thus being postmodern. So this would mean that the stories they build upon are not considered part of the narrative, which could relate to individual stories not existing as part of the structure.

Wait, perhaps the term 'meta-narrative' in the question refers to higher-level structures. So if such higher-level narratives are not accepted, then the stories they're based on (lower-level narratives) are not considered as part of the narrative structure, making those stories suspect.

But I'm getting stuck between F and G. Option F is about individual stories being suspect, which is more about the content than the structure. Option G is about accepting all narratives, which is the opposite of the dictum.

Alternatively, the dictum is about not accepting meta-narratives. So meta-narratives are higher-level, which are not credible. So stories that are built upon them (meta-narratives) are not considered postmodern. So the concept of postmodernism is that stories without meta-narratives are not considered, which would make the stories based on these meta-narratives suspect.

So perhaps the answer is F, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe another approach: the dictum defines postmodernism as being unable to accept meta-narratives, which means that meta-narratives themselves are not credible. So stories that are based on these meta-narratives are not considered part of the narrative structure, hence suspect.

So in that case, the term 'meta-narrative' refers to the higher-level structures, and the dictum is saying that stories built upon them are not considered as part of the narrative structure, thus making them suspect. So, the concept of postmodernism would be that stories are not built upon meta-narrative structures, making them suspect, which would mean that individual stories are not considered in the same way.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The options are:

A: disregard individual stories.

B: universal values are meaningless.

C: literature reproduces repression.

D: truth is objective and undeniable.

E: law is static.

F: individual stories are suspect.

G: rejects all forms of authority.

H: rejects all forms of meta-narratives.

Wait, the question says that the last character must be the letter chosen. So the answer must be F or G, perhaps.

Wait, the question is about the meaning of the dictum, which is about not accepting meta-narratives. So the concept of postmodernism is that stories are not built upon meta-narratives, hence being considered as being without the higher-level structure.

So the concept of postmodernism is that meta-narratives are not accepted, meaning that stories that are built upon them are not considered, making them suspect.

Wait, but the options are about the meaning of the dictum. The dictum itself says that postmodernism is the lack of acceptance towards meta-narratives. So the concept of postmodernism is that stories are not built upon meta-narrative structures, hence they are not considered, making their content suspect.

So the term 'meta-narrative' is part of the dictum. So the concept of postmodernism is that stories are not built upon higher-level narratives. So the term 'meta-narrative' is part of the definition.

But the options are about what the dictum defines as postmodernism. So the dictum is defining postmodernism as the lack of acceptance towards meta-narratives, meaning that stories without meta-narratives are considered non-postmodern.

So the concept of postmodernism itself is that stories are built without meta-narratives, which are higher-level structures. So the term 'meta-narrative' is part of the definition. But the options don't mention meta-narratives, so maybe that's not the right angle.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler. The question is about the meaning of the dictum. So the dictum defines postmodernism as being resistant to meta-narratives, meaning that meta-narratives are not accepted, so the stories they build upon are suspect.

So, the concept of postmodernism is that stories are not built upon higher-level narratives, making their lower-level narratives suspect.

Looking at the options, F says individual stories are suspect. That would be about the content, not the structure. So maybe F refers to the content, but the dictum is about the structure (meta-narratives) not being accepted.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F because the dictum implies that stories are not based on meta-narratives, so their content is suspect. But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to recall Lyotard's definition. I think he defines meta-narrative as the subordinate structure, which are not credible. So if meta-narratives are not accepted, then stories that build on them are not considered. So the concept of postmodernism is that stories without meta-narrative structures are not accepted, making their content suspect.

So, the concept of postmodernism is about not having meta-narratives, meaning that individual stories are not as important as the structures they build upon. So the term 'meta-narrative' is not part of the definition, but the structure is about not using higher-level narratives.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is F. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, but that seems opposite.

Wait, another thought: the dictum is about not accepting meta-narratives, which are higher-level. So stories are not considered postmodern if they are based on meta-narratives. So the concept is that meta-narratives are not accepted, making stories built on them suspect.

Looking at the options, I think F is about individual stories being suspect, which might not be directly related to the structure. Option G says postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. That's more about the level of authority, not meta-narratives.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F. Because the dictum defines that postmodernism is about not accepting meta-narratives. So meta-narratives are higher-level, and stories that are based on them are not considered. So individual stories, which are the lower-level, are suspect because they are not part of the higher structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F. Let me think: the dictum is about meta-narratives, which are higher-level. So F is about individual stories, which are lower-level. So the dictum's meaning is that stories are not built upon higher levels, making them individual stories suspect. So that might be the case.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about what each option represents. The question is about the meaning of the dictum. The dictum says that postmodernism is the lack of acceptance towards meta-narratives. So the concept is that stories that rely on meta-narratives are not considered part of the narrative structure, making their content suspect.

So the concept of postmodernism is that stories are not based on meta-narrative structures, thus being suspect. So the term 'meta-narrative' is part of the definition. But the options don't include 'meta-narrative', so perhaps the answer is F because the dictum implies that individual stories (lower-level) are suspect because they aren't part of a structure built on meta-narratives.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another angle: Lyotard's concept of meta-narrative is the 'subsequent' or 'higher' level of narrative. So, if you can't accept meta-narratives, then stories that are built on them are not considered part of the narrative structure. So their lower-level narratives are suspect.

So, the concept of postmodernism is that stories are not built on meta-narrative structures, making their content suspect. So the term 'meta-narrative' is part of the definition, but the options don't mention that. Therefore, the answer must relate to the meaning of the dictum.

After considering all, perhaps the correct answer is F: individual stories are suspect. Because the dictum implies that stories built on meta-narratives are not considered, thus their lower-level narratives are suspect. But I'm not sure if that's the exact wording.

Alternatively, the answer could be G: the concept of truth is objective and undeniable. No, that's the opposite.

Wait, another thought: the dictum is about not accepting meta-narratives, which are higher-level. So the concept of postmodernism is that stories are not built upon these higher-level narratives, making their content suspect. So the term 'meta-narrative' is part of the definition. But the options don't include 'meta-narrative', so maybe the answer is F because the dictum implies that individual stories are not part of the narrative structure, hence suspect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the options again. The question is about the meaning of the dictum. So the dictum says that postmodernism is the lack of acceptance towards meta-narratives. So meta-narratives are not credible, meaning that stories that are built upon them are not considered part of the narrative structure, making them suspect.

So, the concept of postmodernism is that stories are not built on meta-narrative structures. So the answer is that stories are not part of the narrative, making them suspect. So the concept is about the structure of stories. But the options don't mention structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because the dictum says that postmodernism is resistant to meta-narratives, meaning that meta-narratives are not accepted, making stories built on them suspect. But the options don't have 'meta-narrative', so I think I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F because the dictum implies that individual stories are suspect, but that's not directly about meta-narrative. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should recall that the dictum is about not accepting meta-narratives. So the concept of postmodernism is that stories are not based on meta-narrative structures, making their content suspect. So the term 'meta-narrative' is part of the definition, but the options don't mention it. So perhaps the answer is F, about individual stories being suspect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because the dictum says that meta-narratives are not accepted, so the stories built upon them are not considered, making their lower-level narratives suspect. So, the concept of postmodernism is about the structure, which the lower-level stories are suspect, but that's not directly addressed in the options. So I'm still not confident.

Wait, maybe another approach: what does each option mean. Option F says individual stories are suspect. The dictum is about meta-narratives, not individual stories. So perhaps the answer is not F. Then, perhaps the correct answer is F because the dictum's meaning is about the lower-level stories being suspect, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because the dictum's meaning is about the structure of stories, and the lower-level stories are suspect, but I'm not certain.

After all this, I think the correct answer is F: individual stories are suspect. Because the dictum's meaning is about stories not being considered as part of the narrative structure, making their lower-level narratives suspect.

The question asks about Lyotard's dictum "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives," and the options are analyzed to determine the correct interpretation of the meaning of the dictum. 

1. **Option A**: "Postmodernism disregards individual stories." This is incorrect because the dictum is about meta-narratives, not individual stories.

2. **Option B**: "Universal values are meaningless." This is unrelated to the dictum, which focuses on meta-narratives rather than universal values.

3. **Option C**: "Literature reproduces repression." This is unrelated to the dictum, which discusses meta-narratives and their lack of credibility.

4. **Option D**: "The concept of truth is objective and undeniable." This contradicts Lyotard's rejection of subjective truth and objective truth.

5. **Option E**: "The law is static." This is unrelated to the dictum, which deals with narrative structures rather than legal systems.

6. **Option F**: "Individual stories are suspect." The dictum refers to the lack of credibility in meta-narratives, which can lead to the suspicion of lower-level stories built upon them. This aligns with the idea that stories not part of a narrative structure are considered suspect.

7. **Option G**: "Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority." This is incorrect because the dictum is about the lack of credible meta-narratives, not rejecting authority.

8. **Option H**: "Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority." This is incorrect because the dictum does not involve rejecting authority, but rather the lack of credible meta-narratives.

After analyzing each option, the correct interpretation of Lyotard's dictum is that it defines postmodernism as the lack of credibility in meta-narratives. The term "meta-narrative" refers to higher-level structures, and the dictum implies that stories built upon these meta-narratives are not considered part of the narrative structure, making their lower-level narratives suspect. This aligns with the idea that individual stories are suspect.
