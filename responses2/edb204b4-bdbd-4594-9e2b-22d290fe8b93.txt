Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is asking me to translate the English statement "Some firefighters rescue victims from danger" into predicate logic using the given predicates.

First, let's break down the sentence. "Some" means there exists at least one. So, I'll need to use the existential quantifier somewhere, probably at the beginning of the statement.

Next, the predicate logic structure needs to capture that there's a situation where a firefighter rescues a victim from some danger. The given predicates are Dx (x is danger), Fx (x is a firefighter), Vx (x is a victim), and Rxyz (x rescues y from z).

Breaking it down:

1. There exists an x (a person) who is a firefighter. So, Fx.
2. Then, this x rescues some y (a victim) from some z (a danger). So, Rxyz.

Wait, but the structure of Rxyz is x rescues y from z. So, in the overall statement, it's "some firefighters rescue victims from danger." So, for some x who are firefighters, there exists a y (victims) and a z (dangers) such that x rescues y from z.

So, putting that together, the main part would be "There exists an x such that x is a firefighter, and there exists a y and z such that x rescues y from z, where y is a victim and z is a danger."

Looking at the options, let's see which one fits.

Option H: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Vy • (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

Let me parse that:

- (∃x) means there exists x.
- Fx is x is a firefighter.
- Then, for the y part, Vy is y is a victim.
- Then, ∃z (Dz • Rxyz) means there exists z where z is a danger and x rescues y from z.

So the entire statement is: There exists an x who is a firefighter, and there exists a y (victims) and a z (dangers) such that x rescues y from z.

Wait, but the original question says "rescue victims from danger." So, is the z part correctly representing the danger? The original problem statement's structure is unclear, but in any case, H seems to capture that.

Option E: (∃x){Fx • (∀y)[Vy ⊃ (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}

E says that for all y, if y is a victim, then there exists a z where z is a danger and x rescues y from z. But wait, x rescues y from z, but z is not necessarily the danger where the rescue happened. The original statement is about rescuing victims from a particular danger, which is the same as the z in the original statement.

Wait, no, the original statement says "some firefighters rescue victims from danger." So, the "from z" in Rxyz is the same as the danger. So, I think that H is correct because for some x (firefighter), there's some y (victims) and some z (dangers) where x rescues y from z.

Wait, but looking again, the original statement is about rescuing victims from some danger. So, the structure should be ∃x (Fx) ∧ ∃y (Vy) ∧ ∃z (Dz) ∧ Rxyz.

But in option H, it's only the existence of x, y, and z. So, H is correct as it starts with ∃x, then Fx, then Vy, then ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz). So, the H option seems to fit.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the original statement is "some firefighters rescue victims from danger," which I think is equivalent to "there exists a x (firefighter) who rescues some y (victims) from some z (danger)." So, the logic would have ∃x(Fx) ∧ ∃y(Vy) ∧ ∃z(Dz) ∧ Rxyz.

But in H, we have ∃x(Fx) ∧ ∃y(Vy) ∧ ∃z(Dz ∧ Rxyz). So that's correct because for some x, y, z exist such that x is a firefighter, y is a victim, z is a danger, and x rescues y from z.

So option H matches this structure.

Looking at other options:

Option E uses a universal quantifier for y, which doesn't fit since it's "some" (existential).

Option G: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Dy • (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}

G uses ∃x, Fx, ∃y, Dy, ∃z, Vz, Rxyz. So, that's the same as H, just written differently.

Wait, both H and G have the same structure. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me re-express H:

H: ∃x (Fx) ∧ ∃y (Vy) ∧ ∃z (Dz) ∧ Rxyz.

But in H, the way it's written is using parentheses to group the conditions. So, it's (∃x)(Fx) and (∃y)(Vy) and (∃z)(Dz ∧ Rxyz). So, the structure is correct.

Alternatively, option G is (∃x) Fx ∧ (∃y) Dy ∧ (∃z) Vz ∧ Rxyz.

Wait, but Vz is the same as Vy, but the structure is ∃y Dy. So, it's the same as H, just written differently. So, both H and G are logically equivalent.

Hmm, but the question is which is the correct translation. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says "some firefighters rescue victims from danger." So, there exists a x (firefighter), a y (victims), and a z (danger) such that x rescues y from z.

So, the correct predicate logic is ∃x (Fx) ∧ ∃y (Vy) ∧ ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz).

Looking at each option, H is:

∃x (Fx) ∧ ∃y (Vy) ∧ ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz).

Yes, that's correct. So option H is correct.

Wait, but looking at option E:

E: ∃x (Fx) ∧ ∀y (Vy → ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz)).

E uses a universal quantifier for y. That would mean for every y, if y is a victim, then there's a z where y is a victim and x rescues y from z. But that would require that x rescues y from some z, but it doesn't necessarily imply that there's a z that is a danger. Because if y is a victim, and x rescues from z, then z could be any possibility. So, the ∀y part doesn't properly capture the original statement, which is about some y (victims) and some z (danger).

Wait, let me think again. The correct translation should have ∃y (Vy) and ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz). So, the correct options are those that have two separate existential quantifiers for y and z.

Looking at the options again:

Option H: ∃x (Fx) ∧ ∃y (Vy) ∧ ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz).

Yes, that's correct.

Another way: H is correct.

Wait, but looking at option G:

G: ∃x (Fx) ∧ ∃y (Dy) ∧ ∃z (Vz) ∧ Rxyz.

Wait, Dy is y being a danger, which isn't correct because in the original statement, the danger is for the rescue. So, the correct predicate would be Vz (z is a danger), but the way G is written, it's ∃y (Dy), which is y is a danger, which is not the same as the z in the original statement.

Wait, so in G, it's ∃y (Dy) which is y is a danger, but in the original statement, it's a particular z. So, G's structure is ∃x (Fx) ∧ ∃y (Dy) ∧ ∃z (Vz) ∧ Rxyz.

Wait, that's not correct because y is a danger, but z is the danger where the rescue happened. So, G is incorrect because it uses the same variable y for both, but in the original statement, y is a victim, and z is a danger.

So, G is incorrect.

So, back to H and E.

H is correct because it uses ∃x (Fx), ∃y (Vy), ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz).

E is incorrect because the ∀y part requires that for every y, if they're a victim, then there's a z (danger) where they are rescued. But this doesn't ensure that there exists a particular z where x rescues y from it. Because the ∀y part would require that for every y (victims), there's a z that x rescues them from. That might not capture the original statement, which is about some y and some z. So E's structure is incorrect.

So, H must be the correct answer.

The correct translation is option H: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Vy • (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}.
