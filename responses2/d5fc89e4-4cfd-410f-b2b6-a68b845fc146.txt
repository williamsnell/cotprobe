Okay, so I've got this question here about converting millimeters to decimeters. Hmm, I remember that metric units have prefixes that represent powers of ten. Let me think. Milli means one-thousandth, right? So millimeter is 10^-3 meters. And decimeter is one-tenth of a meter, which is 10^-1 meters. So I need to find how many decimeters are in 26.1 millimeters.

Wait, how do I convert between units? I think you can use conversion factors. Since I'm going from mm to dm, I need to find the factor that relates them. So 1 decimeter is 100 millimeters because 10^-1 divided by 10^-3 is 10^2, which is 100. Oh wait, no, wait, that's the other way around. Wait, wait, 1 decimeter is 100 millimeters. So 1 dm = 100 mm. Therefore, 1 mm equals 0.01 dm because 1 divided by 100 is 0.01. So to convert mm to dm, I multiply by 0.01.

So 26.1 mm multiplied by 0.01 should give me the dm. Let me do that calculation: 26.1 * 0.01 is 0.261 dm. So looking at the options, option D is 0.261. That should be the right answer.

Let me double-check. Another way is to think about the metric prefixes. Milli is 10^-3, deci is 10^-1. So to go from mm to dm, you're moving from a smaller unit to a larger one. Wait, no, wait. Wait, milli is smaller than deci. So to convert from mm to dm, you multiply by 0.01, which is the same as dividing by 100. So yes, 26.1 mm is 0.261 dm. So the correct option is D.

The correct conversion factor from millimeters to decimeters is 1 dm = 100 mm. Therefore, 1 mm = 0.01 dm. Applying this to 26.1 mm:

26.1 mm Ã— (0.01 dm / 1 mm) = 0.261 dm.

Thus, the correct answer is **D: 0.261**.
