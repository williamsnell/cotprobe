Okay, so I need to figure out what the term "Qur'an" means. I remember from school that "Qur'an" is a word used in Arabic, but I'm not exactly sure about its origin or meaning. Let me think. 

First, I recall that "Qur'an" is a literary work. The word "Qur" is Latin for "the book" and "an" is an indefinite article. So together, it probably means "the book" or "the literary work." Looking at the options, option H says "The Holy Book," which sounds right. But wait, I'm not entirely sure because sometimes people might confuse it with something else.

What about the other options? Option A is "The Recitation." I think recitations are parts of the Quran, like verses in the book, but the book itself is the main text. So A might not be correct. Option B is "The Prophecy," which sounds like a prediction or hidden messages, not the main source of the Quran. Option C is "The Revelations," which I associate with the Bible, not the Quran. Option D is "The Narrative," which refers to stories, not the book. Option E is "The Pillars," which I'm not sure refers to anything specific. Option F is "The Teachings," which doesn't fit. 

Option G is "The Law," which might be a term used in some contexts but I don't think that's the standard translation. Option I is "The Scriptures," which refers to the Bible's science, not the Quran. Option J is "The Commands," which is about religious directives.

So putting it together, "Qur'an" is the Arabic text that's considered the holy book. It's also known as the Quranic Literature. So the correct answer should be H: The Holy Book.
