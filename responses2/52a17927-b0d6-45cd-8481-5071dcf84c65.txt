Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating absolute pressure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question says the gauge pressure is 1.5 MPa and the barometric pressure is 104 kPa. I need to find the absolute pressure and choose the correct option from A to I.

Wait, what's the difference between absolute and gauge pressure? Oh right, Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. Absolute pressure is the total pressure including atmospheric. So the formula I remember is absolute pressure equals gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure.

So the formula is P_absolute = P_gauge + P_atm. Got it. Let me plug in the numbers. The gauge is 1.5 MPa, and the barometric pressure (which is the same as atmospheric pressure) is 104 kPa. Oh wait, but the units aren't the same, right? I need to make sure both are in the same unit before adding.

Let me convert 1.5 MPa to kPa. I know that 1 MPa is 1,000 kPa. So 1.5 MPa equals 1,500 kPa. Oh, right, because 1.5 * 1000 is 1500.

Now, the barometric pressure is 104 kPa. So adding those together: 1500 kPa + 104 kPa equals 1604 kPa. Let me add that up. 1500 plus 100 is 1600, plus 4 more is 1604.

Looking at the options, I see option A is 1504 kPa, which is close but a bit lower. Option C is 1.604 MPa, which is the same as 1604 kPa. So option C should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait, 1.5 MPa is 1.5 * 10^6 Pa, and 104 kPa is 1.04 * 10^5 Pa. When adding, I need to make the exponents match. So 1.5 MPa is 1500 kPa (1.5e6 Pa is 1500 kPa). So 1500 + 104 = 1604 kPa, which is 1.604 MPa. So option C is correct.

Other options: B is 1.5 MPa which is the gauge, not absolute. E is 604, which seems too low. F is 2.104, which is 2104 kPa, way higher. I is 0.5 MPa, way too low. D is 1.4 MPa, but that doesn't match. So yeah, definitely option C.

To calculate the absolute pressure, use the formula:

\[
P_{\text{absolute}} = P_{\text{gauge}} + P_{\text{atm}}
\]

Given:
- Gauge pressure, \( P_{\text{gauge}} = 1.5 \, \text{MPa} \)
- Barometric pressure (atmospheric pressure), \( P_{\text{atm}} = 104 \, \text{kPa} \)

First, convert the gauge pressure to kPa:
\[
1.5 \, \text{MPa} = 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa} = 1500 \, \text{kPa}
\]

Now, add the two pressures:
\[
P_{\text{absolute}} = 1500 \, \text{kPa} + 104 \, \text{kPa} = 1604 \, \text{kPa}
\]

Convert 1604 kPa back to MPa:
\[
1604 \, \text{kPa} = 1.604 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Thus, the absolute pressure is \( 1.604 \, \text{MPa} \), which corresponds to option C.
