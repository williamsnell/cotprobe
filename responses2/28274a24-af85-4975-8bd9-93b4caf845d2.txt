Okay, so I've got this division problem here: 1,248 divided by 7. I need to find the quotient and the remainder. Let me think about how to approach this. 

I remember that when you divide numbers, the quotient is how many times the divisor fits into the dividend, and the remainder is what's left over after that. So, 1,248 divided by 7. Hmm, I think I can do this step by step.

Let me break it down. 7 goes into 12 how many times? Well, 7 times 1 is 7, and 7 times 2 is 14, which is too big. So 1 time. Then I subtract 7 from 12, which leaves 5. Then bring down the 4, making it 54.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me correct that. The first step is how many times 7 goes into 12. Oh right, it's 1 time with a remainder of 5. So I write down 1 for the quotient. Then I bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 54.

Now, how many times does 7 go into 54? Let's see, 7 times 7 is 49, which is less than 54. 7 times 8 is 56, which is too big. So it's 7 times. Subtract 49 from 54, which leaves 5. Bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 58.

How many times does 7 go into 58? 7 times 8 is 56, and 7 times 9 is 63, which is too big. So 8 times. Subtract 56 from 58, that leaves 2. So the remainder is 2.

So putting it all together, the quotient is 178 and the remainder is 2. Let me check the options again. Option A is 168 remainder 2. Wait, that can't be right because 7*168 is 1,176. 1,248 minus 1,176 is 72. Wait, but that can't be. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the initial steps. Let me start over.

Dividing 1,248 by 7. Let's do it properly.

7 into 1: doesn't fit, so take 12. 7 into 12 is 1, remainder 5. Bring down 4, making 54.

7 into 54 is 7 times (7*7=49), remainder 5. Bring down 8, making 58.

7 into 58 is 8 times (7*8=56), remainder 2. So the quotient is 178, remainder 2.

Looking at the options, option A is 168 rem 2, which isn't correct because 168*7=1,176, which is less than 1,248. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I should check option B: 178 rem 2. That matches what I got. So why did I think I made a mistake earlier?

Wait, perhaps I confused the steps. Let me verify using another method, like the multiplication check. If the quotient is 178, then 178*7 should equal 1,246. Because 178*7= 1,246. But the original number is 1,248, so 1,248 minus 1,246 is 2. So yes, remainder 2. So option B is correct.

Wait, but I thought another option was correct earlier. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. 

Another approach: 7 times 170 is 1,190. 1,190 plus 7*8=56 is 1,246. So 178*7 is 1,246, which is correct. Then 1,248 minus 1,246 is 2. So yeah, the remainder is 2. So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option A was correct, but that was wrong. So the answer should be option B: 178 remainder 2.

The correct answer is B: 178 remainder 2.

Answer:
     B: 178 remainder 2
