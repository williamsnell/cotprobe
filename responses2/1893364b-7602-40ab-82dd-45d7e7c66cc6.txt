Okay, so I've got this question about the Quantity Equation of Exchange. Hmm, I remember that the quantity equation is a key concept in economics, especially in monetary theory. Let me think about what it's about.

Wait, the equation relates money supply, price levels, and the value of goods and services. Oh right, the formula involves these variables: M (money supply), V (velocity of money), P (price level), and Q (quantity of goods and services produced). 

I think the basic equation is something like MV = PQ. Let me check each option. Option A is M = PQ/V. That doesn't sound right because M should be on one side. Option B is PQ = MV, which looks correct. Let me think why that's the case. The quantity equation says that the total amount of money in circulation (M) multiplied by the velocity of money (V) equals the total value of goods and services produced (P*Q). So yes, option B fits.

The other options don't make sense. Option C is PQ = M/V, which doesn't seem to balance units correctly. Option D adds money and velocity, that's not the equation. Option E swaps price and quantity. Option F rearranges but not correctly. Option G has QV = PM, which is also not the same as the quantity equation. Option I adds money and velocity, which doesn't fit. Option J is an equivalence, but it's the same as B. So all others are incorrect.

The Quantity Equation of Exchange is represented by the equation \( MV = PQ \), where \( M \) is the money supply, \( V \) is the velocity of money, \( P \) is the price level, and \( Q \) is the quantity of goods and services. 

The correct answer is **B: PQ = MV**.
