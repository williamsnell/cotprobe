Okay, so I've got this question about calculating interest on a loan. Let me think through it step by step. The loan amount is $1,262.77, made on March 15 and repaid on August 12. The interest rate is 8% per year, and we're supposed to use exact time. Hmm, I remember that exact time usually means considering the actual number of days between the two dates, not rounding to the nearest day or anything.

First, I need to figure out how many days are between March 15 and August 12. Let me count each month separately.

March has 31 days. So from March 15 to March 31 is 31 minus 15 plus 1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: March 15 to March 31 is 16 days (including both start and end dates). Because March 15 to 31: 31-15=16, but since both are included, it's 16 days.

Wait, no, wait: March 15 to March 31 is 17 days? Let me count: 15 is day 1, 16 day 2,... 31 is day 17. Yeah, that's right.

Then April has 30 days, May has 31, June 30, July 31, and August 12. Wait, but wait, August starts on August 1. So August 1 to August 12 is 12 days.

So let's add them up.

March: 17 days
April: 30
May: 31
June: 30
July: 31
August: 12

Adding these up: 17 +30=47, +31=78, +30=108, +31=139, +12=151. So total exact days are 151 days.

Wait, let me double-check that. March 15 to August 12. Let's list them:

March 15,16,...31: 17 days.
April: 1-30: 30 days.
May: 1-31: 31.
June: 1-30: 30.
July:1-31:31.
August:1-12:12.

Yes, 17+30=47, +31=78, +30=108, +31=139, +12=151. So 151 days.

Now, the formula for interest is (Principal × Rate × Time)/100. But wait, when using exact time, time is in days divided by 365. Oh right, because it's based on exact days, not annual rate.

The rate is 8% per year. So 8% is 0.08 as a decimal.

So the time factor is 151 days / 365 days.

So the interest would be 1262.77 * 0.08 * (151/365).

Calculating step by step:

First, 0.08 * 1262.77 = let's see, 1262.77 * 0.08. Hmm, 1262.77 * 0.1 is 126.277, so 0.08 is 10% of that, which is 12.58216.

Wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, 1262.77 * 0.08: 1262 *0.08 is 100.96, and 0.77*0.08=0.0616, so total is 100.96 +0.0616=101.0216. So approximately $101.02.

Then multiply that by (151/365). Let's compute 151/365 first. 151 ÷ 365 = approximately 0.414027.

So 101.0216 * 0.414027. Let me calculate that. 101 *0.4=40.4. 0.010216 *0.4 is about 0.004086. So 40.4 +0.004086 is 40.404086. Then the 0.414027 is more precise.

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 101.0216 * 0.414027.

Let me compute 101.0216 × 0.414027.

Alternatively, I can break it down:

101.0216 * 0.4 = 40.40864

101.0216 * 0.01 = 1.010216

101.0216 * 0.004027 = approximately 101.0216 *0.004 = 0.4040864

Adding all: 40.40864 + 1.010216 = 41.418856 + 0.4040864 = 41.8229424.

So approximately $41.82.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here because when you multiply 101.0216 * 0.414027, perhaps it's better to compute as:

101.0216 * 0.414027 = ?

Well, 101 × 0.414 = 41.814.

But let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute:

101.0216 × 0.414027 ≈ 101.0216 * 0.4 = 40.40864; 101.0216 * 0.01=1.010216; 101.0216 *0.004=0.4040864; 101.0216 *0.000027≈0.0027276.

So adding all parts:

40.40864 +1.010216=41.418856

+0.4040864=41.8229424

+0.0027276≈41.82567.

So approximately $41.8257.

Wait, but wait, I'm using 0.08% as 0.08, but is this correct?

Wait, no. Wait, wait, the rate is 8% per annum. So the daily rate is 8%/365, which is 0.08/365 per day.

But when I did 1262.77 * 0.08, I got 101.0216. Then multiplied by (151/365) to get the interest.

So, yes, 101.0216 * (151/365) = 41.8257, which is approximately $41.83.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The options are A: $45.67, B: $35.28, C: $53.60, D: $48.99, E: $41.52, F: $55.10, G: $32.34, H: $60.45, I: $50.23, J: $38.70.

Hmm, E is $41.52, which is close to my calculation of approximately $41.83. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days.

Let me double-check the number of days between March 15 and August 12.

March has 31 days, so March 15 to March 31 is 16 days (since 31-15=16, but including both, so 16 days. Wait, wait: March 15 is day 1, 15,16,...31. So 31-15=16, but since both are included, 16 days? Wait, no, no, wait. The number of days between March 15 and March 31 is (31 -15) +1? No, wait. Let me think: March 15 is day 0, March 16 is day 1,..., March 31 is day 16. So 16 days. So that's correct.

April: 30 days, May:31, June:30, July:31, August:12.

Wait, but August 1 is day 1, so August 12 is day 12.

So adding up:

16 (March) +30 (April) =46

+31 (May)=77

+30 (June)=107

+31 (July)=138

+12 (August)=150.

Wait, wait, that's 150 days. Earlier I thought 151. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recount.

March 15 to March 31 is 16 days (including both dates)

April 1 to April 30: 30 days.

May 1 to May 31: 31.

June 1 to June 30:30.

July 1 to July 31:31.

August 1 to August 12:12 days.

Adding up: 16 +30=46, +31=77, +30=107, +31=138, +12=150. So 150 days.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 151, but now I'm getting 150. Which is correct?

Wait, March 15 to March 31: 16 days (including both ends).

Wait, March 15 is day 0, March 16 is day 1, up to March 31, which is day 16.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should write out each month's days.

March 15 to March 31: 16 days.

April: 30 days.
May:31
June:30
July:31
August:12.

So sum: 16+30=46, +31=77, +30=107, +31=138, +12=150.

Yes, 150 days.

So my initial calculation was wrong. It's 150 days.

So back to the interest calculation.

So 150 days instead of 151.

So time is 150/365.

So let's recalculate.

Compute 1262.77 * 0.08 * (150/365).

First, 0.08 *1262.77 = 101.0216.

Then multiply by (150/365).

150/365 = 0.4109589.

So 101.0216 * 0.4109589 ≈ ?

Let me compute 100 *0.4109589=41.09589.

1.0216 * 0.4109589≈ approximately 0.4214.

So total ≈41.09589 +0.4214≈41.517. So approximately $41.52.

Looking at the options, option E is $41.52, which matches.

Wait, but let me check the initial days again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, March 15 to August 12.

March 15 to March 31: 16 days.

April: 30, May:31, June:30, July:31, August:12.

16 +30=46, +31=77, +30=107, +31=138, +12=150. So yes, 150 days.

So the interest is approximately $41.52, which is option E.
</think>

The correct answer is E: $41.52.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine the Time Period:**
   - The loan is made on March 15 and repaid on August 12.
   - Count the exact number of days between these dates, considering each month's days:
     - March 15 to March 31: 16 days.
     - April: 30 days.
     - May: 31 days.
     - June: 30 days.
     - July: 31 days.
     - August 1 to August 12: 12 days.
   - Total days = 16 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 12 = 150 days.

2. **Calculate the Interest:**
   - Principal: $1,262.77.
   - Rate: 8% (or 0.08 as a decimal).
   - Time: 150 days / 365 days/year.
   - Formula: Interest = Principal × Rate × Time.
   - Calculation:  
     - 1,262.77 × 0.08 = 101.0216.
     - 101.0216 × (150/365) ≈ 101.0216 × 0.410959 ≈ 41.517.
   - Rounded to two decimal places: $41.52.

3. **Match with Options:**
   - Option E: $41.52.
