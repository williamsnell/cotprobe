Question:

A surgeon operated on a patient in an operating room in the Marina General Hospital. The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident. If the intern brings suit against the nurse for contribution, the most likely result is that the intern will

Options:

A: prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur
B: not prevail, because the intern was the one who agreed to the settlement.
C: not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.
D: not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.
E: not prevail, because the nurse was just following the intern's orders.
F: not prevail, because the intern already accepted a settlement.
G: prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.
H: prevail, because both were equally responsible for the patient's pain.
I: prevail, because the nurse was also involved in the faulty bandaging.
J: prevail, because the nurse should have known better as a staff member of the hospital.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about negligence in a medical negligence case. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a surgeon operated on a patient, and the intern was assisted by the nurse. The intern and nurse did bandaging together, which caused constricting blood vessels and led to acute pain. The patient sued the intern for $20,000. Before trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement. Now, the question is, if the intern sues the nurse for contribution, what's the outcome?

First, I need to recall what "contribution" means in negligence cases. Contribution refers to the duty of a third party (here, the nurse) to compensate the plaintiff (the intern) for their absence of proper care. It's like the third party's liability for the harm they caused.

In negligence cases, the third party can recover contribution if they have breached a duty. The breach could be negligence, breach of duty, or other. In this case, the incident was the intern's fault. The hospital staff, including the nurse, had helped with bandaging. The intern was part of the bandaging.

So, the incident was caused by the interplay between the intern and the nurse. The nurse's actions (bandaging) were part of the patient's care. The intern was assisting the nurse, not taking any action themselves.

In negligence, the third party's duty includes ensuring the patient's care was appropriate. Here, the nurse's actions were part of the patient's care that led to the injury. The intern was assisting the nurse, not performing the necessary care, which might be the breach of duty.

Now, the settlement: the patient and intern agreed to settle. The intern paid $12,000, which the patient is suing the intern for. The question is, would the intern be able to recover contribution from the nurse now?

I think contribution requires that the third party (nurse) can show a duty of care. Since the patient and intern agreed to settle, the agreement is binding. The intern's role was assisting the nurse, not taking the necessary care. The duty to assist is a standard of care, but in this case, the patient's care was partly done by the nurse, and the intern was just helping.

Wait, but the patient's patient care was done by the hospital staff, including the intern and the nurse. The intern's role here was assisting the nurse. So, the patient was in the hospital, and the incident happened because of the bandaging (nurse's) and possibly the intern's assistance.

In negligence, the third party's duty is to ensure the patient is not putting themselves in harm's way. If the third party failed to take reasonable care, the patient is liable. The question is whether the third party (nurse) had a duty of care here.

The incident happened because the nurse was assisting, not because of negligence on their own. So, the nurse's actions were part of the patient's care. The intern's role was assisting the nurse, not taking any additional action. So, perhaps the nurse's role was not a breach, but the intern's was.

Wait, perhaps the issue is whether the third party (nurse) had a duty of care. The patient's injury was due to the bandaging (nurse's) and perhaps the intern's assistance. The third party here is the nurse. Did the nurse have a duty of care? Well, the patient was in the hospital, and the bandaging was part of the patient's care. The patient didn't take any steps, but the incident happened during the patient's care.

So, the third party (nurse) wasn't negligent in their role as part of the patient's care. Therefore, the third party (nurse) had no duty of care, and they're not liable for the injury. Therefore, the intern could not recover contribution from the nurse. 

Wait, but the question says the intern sues the nurse for contribution. Since the nurse wasn't negligent, they can't be held liable for the injury. Therefore, the intern can't recover contribution from the nurse.

Wait, but isn't there a rule that the third party must have a duty to ensure the patient is not in harm's way? If the patient's care was done by the hospital staff, the third party (the staff) may not have a duty of care if the patient was not taking any steps themselves.

So, in this case, the nurse was part of the patient's care. The patient didn't take any action during the incident, but the incident was a result of the patient's care. The third party (nurse) didn't breach their duty because the patient wasn't taking any steps. Thus, the nurse isn't liable.

Therefore, the intern can't recover contribution from the nurse. So, the intern would not prevail because the nurse wasn't negligent, so the intern can't claim contribution.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the nurse was just following the intern's orders. But that doesn't directly address whether the nurse is liable. Option G says the intern will prevail because the nurse was also involved in the bandaging. But the issue is if the nurse is liable. If the third party isn't negligent, the intern can't get contribution.

Wait, but the question is about the intern's claim against the nurse. If the nurse isn’t liable, the intern can’t recover. So, the answer would be that the intern won't prevail.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: the nurse was just following the intern's orders. So, no liability. Option G says the nurse was also involved in the bandaging. Wait, the patient's injury was due to the bandaging, which the intern and nurse did. The patient's actions were perhaps the patient's, but the patient didn't take any steps. So, the patient was in their own care, but the incident happened because of the bandaging.

So the incident was caused by the patient's care, but the third party (nurse) wasn't negligent in their role. So the third party isn't liable, so the intern can't claim contribution.

Wait, but the answer options are about whether the intern will prevail. So, the scenario is: the intern sues the nurse for contribution. If the nurse isn't liable, then the intern can't recover, so the answer is that the intern doesn't prevail. So, which option says that?

Looking at the options: Option E says the nurse was just following the intern's orders. So, the third party (nurse) wasn't negligent. So, the intern can't claim contribution, so the answer would be that the intern won't prevail.

Looking at the options:

Option E: not prevail because the nurse was just following the intern's orders. So, the third party isn't liable, so the intern can't recover.

Option G says the nurse was also involved in the bandaging. But that's the patient's care, not the third party's duty. The intern's role was assisting the nurse, not taking care themselves.

So, the correct outcome is that the intern won't prevail because the nurse isn't liable. Thus, the answer would be E.

Wait, but the options are:

A: prevail because of res ipsa loquitur. That would be if the third party's duty was breached, but the third party wasn't negligent.

B: not prevail because the intern agreed to settlement. But that's about settlement, not liability.

C: not prevail because of improper remedy. The intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution. So, the intern can't claim contribution.

D: not because one settles without judgment. No, that's about negligence.

Wait, perhaps I should analyze the possible options.

The possible answers are options E and G. Let me think again.

The question is whether the intern can recover contribution from the nurse. Contribution is the third party's recovery for the harm they caused. The third party can recover contribution if they have breached a duty.

In this case, the third party is the nurse. Did the nurse breach a duty? The patient's injury was due to the bandaging, which the nurse was involved in. The patient didn't take any action, which is typical for negligence. But wait, the patient's actions were not involved. The patient was in the hospital, but the incident happened during their care. So, the patient wasn't taking any steps, but the incident was the result of the patient's care.

The third party (nurse) didn't breach their duty because the patient wasn't taking any action. The patient's negligence is irrelevant here because they weren't negligent, but the third party was negligent in their role. Wait, no, the patient wasn't negligent, but the third party (nurse) was part of the patient's care and perhaps was negligent in their actions.

Wait, but the patient's injury was because of the bandaging, which was the nurse's role. The patient was in the hospital, but the incident was during their care. The third party (nurse) may have been negligent in assisting the patient. But did the patient take any action themselves? No, so the patient wasn't negligent. So, the third party (nurse) was negligent in their role, but the patient wasn't negligent. But in terms of the third party's liability, the question is whether the third party (nurse) had a duty of care.

In this case, the patient's injury was due to the patient's care, not the third party's. So, the third party (nurse) wasn't negligent in their role as part of the patient's care. So, the third party isn't liable. Therefore, the intern (as the third party) can't recover contribution from the nurse. 

So, the intern cannot claim contribution from the nurse. Therefore, the answer would be that the intern won't prevail (so E or G), but looking at the options, the correct outcome is that the intern can't recover contribution because the nurse isn't liable. So, the answer would be G: not prevail because one who settles without judgment can't recover contribution?

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think again.

The question is, if the intern sues the nurse for contribution, what happens? The possible answers are whether the intern prevails.

So, the intern is suing the nurse for contribution. So, the third party (nurse) is suing the intern (as the plaintiff) for contribution.

In this case, the third party is the nurse, and the plaintiff is the intern. Can the third party recover contribution?

The third party's duty is to ensure that the patient isn't putting themselves in harm's way. In this case, the patient's injury was due to the bandaging (nurse's) and perhaps the intern's assistance. The patient didn't take any steps themselves. So, the third party (nurse) didn't breach their duty because the patient wasn't negligent. Therefore, the third party isn't liable for the injury. Thus, the intern can't recover contribution from the nurse. Therefore, the intern doesn't prevail.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are E and G.

Option E: the nurse was just following the intern's orders. So, because the nurse wasn't negligent, the intern can't claim contribution. So, the answer would be E.

Option G: the intern will prevail because the nurse was also involved in the bandaging. But that's not correct because the third party wasn't negligent. So, G is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about the intern's claim against the nurse. The third party for the intern's claim is the nurse. The third party's duty is to ensure that the patient isn't putting themselves in harm's way. Did the nurse breach their duty? Since the patient didn't take any steps, the third party (nurse) isn't liable. Therefore, the intern can't recover contribution, so the answer is E.

But wait, another angle: the patient's injury was the result of the bandaging, which the nurse did. So, the third party (nurse) was negligent in assisting the patient. But the patient wasn't negligent, so the third party isn't liable. Therefore, the intern can't claim contribution from the nurse.

So, the correct answer is that the intern won't prevail because the nurse isn't liable for the injury. So, the answer is E.
</think>

The question revolves around negligence in a medical case where the patient's injury was caused by the bandaging assistance provided by both the intern and the nurse. The intern sues the nurse for contribution, and the question is whether the intern can recover this claim.

Key points to consider:

1. **Contribution Definition**: Contribution is the third party's recovery for the harm they caused. It requires that the third party has breached a duty of care.

2. **Role of the Third Party (Nurse)**: The patient's injury was due to the bandaging, which the nurse was part of. The patient did not take any steps themselves during the incident, indicating that the third party (nurse) may not have breached their duty of care, as they were not negligent in their role.

3. **Negligence and Liability**: The patient's negligence was irrelevant to the third party's liability. The third party (nurse) was negligent in their role as part of the patient's care, but since the patient was not negligent, the third party is not liable.

4. **Interplay Between Intern and Nurse**: The intern assisted the nurse, but the patient did not take any steps themselves. The incident was the result of the patient's care, not the intern's. Therefore, the third party (nurse) did not breach their duty of care in assisting the patient.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the nurse was not negligent in their role, the intern cannot claim contribution from the nurse. The intern will not prevail because the nurse is not liable for the injury.

**Analysis of Options**:
- **Option E**: "Not prevail, because the intern was the one who agreed to the settlement." This is incorrect because the intern's agreement to settle is not the issue; the question is about whether the intern can recover contribution from the nurse.
- **Option G**: "Not prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution." This is incorrect because the intern is suing the nurse for contribution, not the other way around.
- **Options A to D**: These options are irrelevant to the analysis.

**Correct Answer**:  
The intern will not prevail because the nurse is not liable for the patient's injury, as the third party (nurse) did not breach their duty of care. The correct answer is **E**.
