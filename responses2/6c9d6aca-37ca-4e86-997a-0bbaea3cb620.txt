Question:

The capital structure of Merritt Co. is 20% common equity and debt equal to 80%. The cost of common equity is 10% and the pretax cost of debt is 5%. Merritt's tax rate is 21%. What is Merritt's weighted-average cost of capital?

Okay, so I've got this question about weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) for Merritt Co. I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think through the problem carefully.

Alright, the question says that the capital structure of Merritt Co. is 20% common equity and 80% debt. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way the question is phrased is "20% common equity and debt equal to 80%." Hmm, that might not make sense. Oh wait, wait, no, I think I misread that. Let me recheck. Oh no, wait. The question actually says: "The capital structure of Merritt Co. is 20% common equity and debt equal to 80%." Wait, that doesn't add up. Because 20% common and 80% debt would mean the total is more than 100%, which isn't possible. Oh, wait, perhaps the structure is 20% common and 80% debt, so total is 100% (20+80=100). So, 20% in common equity, 80% in debt. Wait, but the question continues: "The cost of common equity is 10% and the pretax cost of debt is 5%." Oh, wait, the problem says "pre-tax cost of debt," so that's the rate before considering taxes.

Wait, but the tax rate is 21%, so I need to adjust the cost of debt accordingly. Because when calculating WACC, after-tax cost of debt is used.

So, the formula for WACC is: (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1 - Tc)), where E is equity, D is debt, V is total value (E+D), Re is cost of equity, Rd is cost of debt before tax, and Tc is tax rate.

So, in this case, E is 20%, D is 80%. So, E/V is 20% and D/V is 80%.

Re is 10%, that's straightforward.

Rd is 5%, but we have to calculate the after-tax cost. So, after-tax cost of debt is Rd*(1 - Tc). Tc is 21%, so 1 - 0.21 is 0.79. So, 5% * 0.79 = 3.95%.

Wait, but wait: 5% * (1 - 0.21) = 5 * 0.79 = 3.95%. So the after-tax cost is 3.95%.

So, putting it all together:

WACC = (0.2 * 10%) + (0.8 * 3.95%)

Calculating each part:

0.2 * 10% is 0.2 * 0.1 = 0.02 or 2%.

0.8 * 3.95% is 0.8 * 0.0395 = 0.0316, which is 3.16%.

Adding those two: 2% + 3.16% = 5.16%.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the percentages. The capital structure is 20% common and 80% debt, so V is 100%, so E is 20%, D is 80%. Correct.

So, 0.2 * 10% = 2% and 0.8 * (5% * 0.79) = 0.8 * 3.95% = 3.16%, sum is 5.16%.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.16%. So that's the answer.

To calculate the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), we use the formula:

\[ WACC = \left( \frac{E}{V} \times Re \right) + \left( \frac{D}{V} \times Rd \times (1 - Tc) \right) \]

Where:
- \( E \) is the proportion of common equity (20% or 0.2),
- \( D \) is the proportion of debt (80% or 0.8),
- \( Re \) is the cost of common equity (10% or 0.1),
- \( Rd \) is the pretax cost of debt (5% or 0.05),
- \( Tc \) is the tax rate (21% or 0.21).

First, calculate the after-tax cost of debt:

\[ Rd \times (1 - Tc) = 0.05 \times (1 - 0.21) = 0.05 \times 0.79 = 0.0395 \text{ or } 3.95\% \]

Then, calculate each part of the WACC:

1. \( E/V \times Re = 0.2 \times 0.10 = 0.02 \) or 2%.
2. \( D/V \times Rd \times (1 - Tc) = 0.8 \times 0.0395 = 0.0316 \) or 3.16%.

Adding these together:

\[ WACC = 2\% + 3.16\% = 5.16\% \]

Thus, the WACC is **5.16%**, which corresponds to option **A**.
