Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. The question is about translating the English statement "Some blue herons migrate" into predicate logic. I'm a bit rusty on predicate logic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to break down the English sentence. The key parts here are "blue herons" and "migrate." So, there's a group of herons that are blue, and among them, some of them migrate. Hmm.

In predicate logic, "some" usually translates to an existential quantifier, meaning there exists at least one instance where the condition is true. So, I'm looking for an option that has an existential quantifier.

Looking at the options, I see options D, F, and H. Let me check them one by one.

Option D is (∃x)[(Hx • Bx) • Mx]. Let's parse this. Hx means the object is a heron, Bx means it's blue, and Mx means it migrates. So, putting it together, this is saying there exists an x such that x is a heron and blue, and x migrates. That sounds right because "some blue herons migrate" would require an object that is a heron, blue, and migrates.

Option F is (∃x)[(Bx • Hx) ⊃ Mx]. Wait, the implication here is that if an object is blue and a heron, then it migrates. But "some" implies that there exists at least one heron that is blue and migrates. So, this seems to be a different structure. The antecedent would require that if an object is blue and a heron, then it migrates. But that's not the same as saying there exists an object that is a heron, blue, and migrates. Because this would require that every blue heron migrates, which is a stronger statement. So F might not capture the existence part correctly.

Option H is (∃x)[(Bx • Mx) ⊃ Hx]. This says that if an object is blue and migrates, then it's a heron. But that doesn't directly address the existence of a heron that's blue and migrates. Instead, it's more about the relationship between blue and migrating, which isn't the same as the original statement.

Option G is (∀x)[(Hx • Bx) ⊃ Mx]. This is a universal statement, saying that all herons that are blue migrate. That's even stronger than needed because we only need existence. So G is too strong.

Option C is (∀x)[(Hx • Mx) • Bx]. So, all herons that migrate are blue. Again, this is a universal statement, which isn't what we need.

So, back to D: it's an existential statement. It correctly captures that there exists an object that is a heron, blue, and migrates. So, D seems to be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The original statement is "some blue herons migrate." So, it's an existential statement where an object is a blue heron and migrates. So, yes, D is (∃x)(Hx ∧ Bx ∧ Mx), which matches D's structure.

Alternatively, looking at E: (∃x)[(Hx • Bx) ⊃ Mx]. That seems like it's saying if an object is a heron and blue, then it migrates. But this is an implication, not a conjunction. So, E is different. It's not the same as saying an object is a blue heron and migrates—E would require that any heron and blue object migrates, which isn't the same as having at least one heron that is blue and migrates.

So, yeah, D is the correct one.

The correct answer is D: (∃x)[(Hx • Bx) • Mx].

Answer: D
