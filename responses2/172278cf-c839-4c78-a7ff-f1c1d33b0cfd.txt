Okay, so I've got this Laplace transform problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of inverse Laplace transforms. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The function given is F(s) = (2s² - 4) / [(s - 2)(s + 1)(s - 3)]. I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of this, which will give me f(t).

First, I remember that for partial fraction decomposition, it's helpful to break down the rational function into simpler terms. The denominator is already factored, so that's a good start. The numerator is a quadratic, so I can try to express F(s) as a sum of simpler fractions.

Let me set F(s) equal to A/(s-2) + B/(s+1) + C/(s-3). So,

(2s² -4) / [(s-2)(s+1)(s-3)] = A/(s-2) + B/(s+1) + C/(s-3).

To find A, B, and C, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator (s-2)(s+1)(s-3):

2s² -4 = A(s+1)(s-3) + B(s-2)(s-3) + C(s-2)(s+1).

Now I need to find A, B, and C by plugging in suitable values of s. 

If I let s = 2, the terms with A will disappear because (s-2) becomes zero. So,

Left side: 2*(2)^2 -4 = 2*4 -4 = 8-4=4.

Right side: A*(2+1)(2-3) = A*3*(-1) = -3A.

So 4 = -3A ⇒ A = -4/3.

Similarly, let me plug in s = -1. Then (s+1) becomes zero.

Left side: 2*(-1)^2 -4 = 2*1 -4 = -2.

Right side: B*(-1-2)(-1-3) = B*(-3)(-4)= 12B.

So -2 = 12B ⇒ B = -2/12 = -1/6.

Next, plug in s =3. Then (s-3)=0.

Left side: 2*(3)^2 -4 = 18-4=14.

Right side: C*(3-2)(3+1) = C*(1)(4) =4C.

So 14 =4C ⇒ C=14/4=7/2.

So now I have A= -4/3, B= -1/6, C=7/2.

So F(s) = (-4/3)/(s-2) + (-1/6)/(s+1) + (7/2)/(s-3).

Now, the inverse Laplace transform of each term is straightforward.

L^{-1}{1/(s-a)} = e^{at}.

So,

-4/3 * L^{-1}{1/(s-2)} = (-4/3)e^{2t}.

-1/6 * L^{-1}{1/(s+1)} = (-1/6)e^{-t}.

7/2 * L^{-1}{1/(s-3)} = (7/2)e^{3t}.

Putting it all together, f(t) = (-4/3)e^{2t} - (1/6)e^{-t} + (7/2)e^{3t}.

Looking at the options, option F is exactly that: f(t) = [(-4)/3]e^{2t} - (1/6)e^{-t} + (7/2)e^{3t}.

Wait, let's double-check the signs. The original F(s) is (2s²-4)/denominator. In the partial fractions, I had A=-4/3, B=-1/6, C=7/2. So when I apply L^{-1}, each term is multiplied by their respective coefficients. So the function is correct as written in option F.

To find the inverse Laplace transform of \( F(s) = \frac{2s^2 - 4}{(s - 2)(s + 1)(s - 3)} \), we first decompose \( F(s) \) into partial fractions:

\[
F(s) = \frac{A}{s - 2} + \frac{B}{s + 1} + \frac{C}{s - 3}.
\]

By solving for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), we find:

\[
A = -\frac{4}{3}, \quad B = -\frac{1}{6}, \quad C = \frac{7}{2}.
\]

Thus, \( F(s) \) can be rewritten as:

\[
F(s) = \frac{-\frac{4}{3}}{s - 2} + \frac{-\frac{1}{6}}{s + 1} + \frac{\frac{7}{2}}{s - 3}.
\]

Taking the inverse Laplace transform of each term, we get:

\[
\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{ \frac{-\frac{4}{3}}{s - 2} \right\} = -\frac{4}{3}e^{2t},
\]
\[
\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{ \frac{-\frac{1}{6}}{s + 1} \right\} = -\frac{1}{6}e^{-t},
\]
\[
\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{ \frac{\frac{7}{2}}{s - 3} \right\} = \frac{7}{2}e^{3t}.
\]

Combining these results, the inverse Laplace transform is:

\[
f(t) = -\frac{4}{3}e^{2t} - \frac{1}{6}e^{-t} + \frac{7}{2}e^{3t}.
\]

Comparing this with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: \( f(t) = \frac{(-4)}{3}e^{2t} - \frac{1}{6}e^{-t} + \frac{7}{2}e^{3t} \).**
