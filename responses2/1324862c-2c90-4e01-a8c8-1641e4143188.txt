Question:

Upon graduation from high school, a student enrolled in a college close to where he lived. However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son. The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, "If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. " The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months. Six months later, the son defaulted on the payment plan, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son. With regard to the father's obligation under his promise to the finance manager, the court would most likely

Options:

A: relieve the father of liability, because the car lot failed to first sue the son.
B: relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.
C: not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.
D: not relieve the father of liability, because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let's read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a high school graduate who lives near college. He didn't have a car, so he rode the bus to and from college each day. He noticed the bus trips took up to two hours, but the car could do it in half that time. He bought a car, but his bank account only had $2,500. The car was $10,000, so he couldn't afford it. He asked his father to help. He ended up buying a used car, but the father didn't sell it because the finance manager said if he defaulted, he'd pay the balance.

Wait, the key point is that the father told the finance manager, so the finance manager agreed. Now, the question is about the father's obligation under his promise. The court is asking whether the father is liable for the car lot's obligations.

Hmm, what's the law regarding surety bonds and obligations? I remember that surety bonds are agreements between the surety (like a father here) and a bondee (the owner of the car). The surety must pay the bond when the bondee is in default. But there's a main purpose exception—so if the surety's primary purpose isn't to support the bondee, but just to secure the debt, the exception applies.

In this case, the main purpose of the surety bond is to secure the car. The car was purchased with a low credit score, so the finance manager didn't sell it. The car lot wanted to sell it, but the finance manager refused. So the father is acting as a surety, agreeing to pay the balance if the car breaks down.

Now, the bond was $2,500, but the car cost $10,000. So the son paid $2,500 down, and the rest is monthly payments of $500 for 15 months. Wait, 15 months is 1.25 years. 500 x 18 is 9,000, plus 2,500 is 11,500. But the car is $10,000, so that adds up. So the son paid the entire $10,000 in 15 months.

Wait, but the bond is a surety bond. The main purpose is that the surety doesn't have a primary obligation to support the bondee (the owner of the car). The bond is a security measure. So the bond is for the car's value, and the surety (father) is just paying for the car if needed. So the father's main purpose is to secure the debt—the car's value. So the main purpose exception applies here.

The question is whether the father is liable for the bond. The father agreed to pay the bond in exchange for the car. But the bond is a surety, not a liability—so the father's obligation is to secure the car. So the father isn't liable because the main purpose exception allows the surety to rely on the bondee's ability to pay.

Looking at the answer options, option B says the father was never under a duty as a surety. That fits because the main purpose exception allows the surety to rely on the bondee's ability to pay, not necessarily under a duty.

Option A says the father is relieved because the car lot failed to sue him. But the father agreed to sell the car, and the finance manager said he'd pay the balance. So the father didn't fail to sue; he just agreed to the terms.

Option C says the father isn't relieved because of the main purpose exception. That's correct because the father's main purpose is to secure the car, so he's not liable.

Option D says parents are responsible for the children's debts. I don't think that's the case here. The father may have a duty to pay for the car, but the main purpose exception allows the father not to be under a duty.

So the correct answer should be option C or B. Wait, the question is about whether the father's obligation is relieveable. So the father's obligations under surety bonds are to secure the debt, not to be liable for it as a surety. So he isn't liable, so the court would relieve him of liability.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.

Option C: not relieve, because main purpose exception.

Wait, wait, the question is about the father's obligation. The main purpose exception allows the surety to pay for the bondee's debts in exchange for a security bond, not as a duty. So the father isn't liable. So the court would relieve the father of liability, making the answer B or C.

Wait, another thought: the main purpose exception applies to surety bonds. The father agreed to pay the bond in exchange for the car. So the father's main purpose is to secure the bondee's debts, not to have a duty to pay. So the father isn't under a duty under the main purpose exception. Therefore, the court would relieve him of liability.

So the correct answer is option B or C.

Wait, let me recheck. The main purpose exception allows surety bonds to be valid even if the surety isn't under a duty. So the father isn't under a duty as a surety. So he isn't liable. Therefore, the court would relieve him, so the answer is B.

Alternatively, option C says, "not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception." Which would be incorrect because the father isn't liable under the main purpose.

Wait, the options:

Option B: relieve liability because the father wasn't under a duty as a surety.

Option C: don't relieve liability because main purpose exception.

Hmm.

The main purpose exception applies when the surety is acting as a bond, not as a surety. So in this case, the father is the surety, and the main purpose is to secure the bondee's debt. So the father isn't under a duty. Therefore, the court would relieve him.

So the answer is B or C.

Wait, the question is whether the father's obligations are relieveable. The father's obligations under surety bonds are for the bondee's debts. So the father's main purpose is to secure the bondee's debt, so he isn't under a duty. So the court would relieve the father. Therefore, the answer is B or C.

Wait, looking at the options, let me read again:

Option B says "relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety."

Option C says "not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception."

So the father's main purpose is to secure the bondee's debt, not to be under a duty. So the father isn't under a duty. So the father isn't liable, and the court would relieve him. So the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, C says the father isn't liable because of the main purpose exception. That would be incorrect because the father isn't acting under the main purpose; he's acting as a surety.

So the correct answer is B: relieve the father of liability because he wasn't under a duty as a surety.

The question revolves around the father's obligation under a promise to secure a car bond for a college student with a low credit history. The father agreed to sell the car in exchange for a security bond, and the main purpose exception applies to surety bonds. The father's primary purpose is to secure the car's value, not to be under a duty as a surety. 

The court would most likely relieve the father of liability because the father's main purpose is to secure the bondee's debts, not to have a duty of security. This aligns with option B, which states that the father was never under a duty as a surety.

ANSWER: B
