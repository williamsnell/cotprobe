Okay, so I have this question about the Saffir-Simpson scale and the wind speeds associated with it. Hmm, I remember that the Saffir-Simpson system is used to categorize wind speeds from a hurricane's center outwards. But wait, what exactly is the scale about? Oh right, it's divided into five categories based on wind speed thresholds.

I think the categories are as follows: I for strong, II for severe, III for very strong, IV for very severe, and V for very very severe. But the question is specifically about the slowest wind speed a hurricane can have according to the scale. So that would be the minimum speed that a hurricane meets for category IV, right?

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting that backwards. Let me think again. The categories go from the strongest to the weakest. I remember that I is the strongest, and V is the weakest. So each subsequent letter is a lower category. So the slowest a hurricane can be is in category IV. Because category IV is the lowest, meaning the wind speeds are the lowest for a category IV hurricane.

Wait, but the question is asking about the slowest wind speed according to the scale. Oh, maybe I'm getting it wrong. So the Saffir scale has categories based on wind speed from 10 m.p.h. being the weakest to higher values. So maybe the categories are:

I: 100-210 m.p.h. (strongest)
II: 70-99 m.p.h. (severe)
III: 50-69 m.p.h. (very strong)
IV: 30-49 m.p.h. (very severe)
V: 10-29 m.p.h. (very very severe)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. I think I might have the order wrong. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the Saffir scale is I (strongest) to V (weakest). So the breakdown is:

I: 100-310 m.p.h.
II: 70-99 m.p.h.
III: 50-69 m.p.h.
IV: 30-49 m.p.h.
V: 10-29 m.p.h.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Another approach: I think the categories are:

I: 100 mph and higher (strongest)
II: 70 to 99 mph (severe)
III: 50 to 69 mph (very strong)
IV: 30 to 49 mph (very severe)
V: 10 to 29 mph (very severe, but I think IV is the lowest)

Wait, so the slowest a hurricane can have is in category IV, which is 30-49 mph. So the minimum wind speed is 30 mph.

Looking at the options: The options are A to J. Let me list the options again.

Options:
A: 120
B:85
C:80
D:50
E:65
F:74
G:96
H:90
I:100
J:110

Wait, according to my earlier breakdown, the category IV is 30-49. So the slowest is 30. But the options don't have 30. The options given start at 50. So perhaps I got the order wrong. Maybe I should double-check.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the categories. Another approach: The Saffir-Simpson categories go from the center outward, with the highest winds in the center. So the lowest category is V: 10-29 mph, which is the slowest. But looking at the options, 10 isn't an option. So the next lowest is IV:30-49, which isn't an option either. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the order.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The Saffir scale is as follows:

- I: 100-310 mph (strongest)
- II: 70-99 mph (severe)
- III: 50-69 mph (very strong)
- IV: 30-49 mph (very severe)
- V: 10-29 mph (very severe)

But that can't be right because that would mean the slowest is V, but I thought V was the weakest. Wait, perhaps the categories are arranged as the strongest is I, then II, then III, then IV, then V. So V is the lowest, which is 10-29 mph.

But the options given don't have 10 mph. So perhaps the question is about the minimum wind speed a hurricane can have, but the question asks for the slowest speed a hurricane can have according to the scale. So the lowest category is V, which is 10-29. So the slowest is 10 mph in V. But the options don't have 10, so perhaps the next lowest is IV, which is 30-49. The question is asking for the slowest possible, so perhaps the minimum is 10 mph, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum wind speed that a category IV hurricane can have, which is 30-49.

Wait, the question says, "What is the slowest wind speed a hurricane can have according to the Saffir-Simpson scale?"

Ah, right, so the slowest possible is the minimum in the slowest category. So the slowest category is V, which is 10-29 mph, so the slowest is 10 mph. But since the options don't include 10, maybe the next one is IV. Alternatively, perhaps I got the categories reversed. Let me think again.

Another way: the Saffir-Simpson categories are in order of decreasing strength, from strongest (I) to weakest (V). So each subsequent letter represents a lower category. So the worst (slowest) category is V, which is 10-29. So the minimum possible is 10 mph.

Wait, but the options don't have 10. The options start at 50 mph. So that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Saffir-Simpson scale's wind speed thresholds, which are given in mph. So perhaps the answer is the lowest threshold, but the options don't have that.

Wait, let me look at the options again. The options are:

A:120
B:85
C:80
D:50
E:65
F:74
G:96
H:90
I:100
J:110

Wait, the highest is I:100, and then others. So the slowest category is V:10-29, which is 10. But 10 isn't an option. So perhaps the question is about the slowest category, which is V, but since the options don't include 10, perhaps the next lowest is IV, which is 30-49. So the minimum is 30, but option D is 50, which is higher than that. So perhaps the minimum is 30, but the options don't have it. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the thresholds wrong. Another approach: the Saffir-Simpson categories are as follows, with their wind speed thresholds from the center outward:

I: 100-310 m.p.h. (strongest)
II: 70-99 m.p.h. (severe)
III:50-69 m.p.h. (very strong)
IV:30-49 m.p.h. (very severe)
V:10-29 m.p.h. (very severe)

Wait, but that can't be right because if I is the strongest, then V is the weakest. So the slowest is V, which is 10-29. But the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm mixing up the order.

Alternatively, perhaps the categories are based on higher wind speeds being more severe, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the Saffir scale is arranged so that each category is a lower wind speed. Wait, no, I think I have it the other way around. Let me look up the Saffir-Simpson wind speed thresholds to make sure.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the Saffir scale is arranged in such a way that the lowest wind speed is 10, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is about the minimum possible, which is 10, but that's not an option here.

Wait, the options given are 50,65,74,80,85,90,96,100,110,120, etc. So the slowest category is V, which is 10-29. But since 10 isn't an option, perhaps the question is about the slowest category, so the answer isn't among the options. But that's not the case because the question must have an answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum wind speed for a category IV hurricane, which would be the lower end of IV. IV is 30-49. The question is asking for the slowest possible, so perhaps the minimum is 30. But the options don't have 30. So the next option is D:50.

Wait, but 50 is higher than 30. So perhaps the question is referring to the lower end of the V category, but V's minimum is 10, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me think again. Another way: The Saffir scale is arranged so that the strongest category (I) is the highest wind speed, and the weakest is V.

So, the categories are:

I: 100-310 m.p.h. (strongest)
II: 70-99 m.p.h. (severe)
III:50-69 m.p.h. (very strong)
IV:30-49 m.p.h. (very severe)
V:10-29 m.p.h. (very severe)

So the slowest is V, which is 10-29. The question asks for the slowest, so the answer would be that the wind speed is as low as possible, so the minimum in the slowest category. But since the options don't have 10, perhaps the next one is IV, which is 30-49. So the answer would be 30, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum possible category, which is V, but the options don't have that.

Wait, but the options are all higher than 50, except option F is74, and so on.

Wait a second. Maybe I messed up the order. Let me try again. I got the categories wrong. Let's think of the Saffir-Simpson scale as follows:

I: 100 to 310 mph (strongest)
II: 70 to 99 mph (severe)
III: 50 to 69 mph (very strong)
IV: 30 to 49 mph (very severe)
V: 10 to 29 mph (very severe)

So the slowest category is V, which is 10-29. The question asks for the slowest possible. So the answer isn't among the options because 10 isn't present.

Wait, but the options start at 50 mph. So perhaps the question is referring to the minimum wind speed a hurricane can have, but that's in category IV. So the minimum would be 30, but the options don't have it. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but I'm probably missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are the maximums for each category. That is, the highest wind speed for I is 310, II is 99, etc.

Wait, if that's the case, then the slowest category (V) would have the lowest wind speed as 10, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is wrong, but I'm supposed to choose the next lowest possible, which would be IV, but IV's minimum is 30.

Wait, but the question is asking for the slowest possible. So the category V is the slowest, but the options don't have 10. So I'm stuck.

Wait, another approach: think about what each letter represents. The options are all around 50 or higher. So perhaps the question is about the minimum possible wind speed that a hurricane can have, but that's in category IV. So the slowest is IV, which is 30-49. But the options don't have 30.

Wait, but the options don't have 30. The lowest is 50. So perhaps the answer is 50, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong, but I'm supposed to choose the minimum possible, which is 30 for IV, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is 50.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum possible wind speed a hurricane can have, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, another way: maybe the question is in reverse. Let me think, the Saffir scale's wind speed thresholds go from the center outward, so the strongest (I) is the highest, and the weakest is V. So the slowest is V, which is 10-29. But the options don't have that. So maybe the answer is IV, which is 30-49, but the options don't have 30.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the maximum wind speeds for each letter. So the maximum for I is 310, II is 99, III is 69, IV is 49, V is 29. So the worst category is V, and its maximum wind speed is 29.

But the question is about the minimum wind speed, which would be category V's minimum, 10. Since the options don't have 10, maybe I'm supposed to choose the next option down.

But the options are A to J, with 50 and above. So the next lowest possible is IV, which is 30. But the options don't have 30. So perhaps the question is wrong, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering the scale. Let me think, perhaps the categories are arranged so that each next letter represents a lower wind speed. So, I is the strongest, then II, then III, IV, V. But that can't be right because then V is the weakest. So the slowest category is V.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum possible wind speed, so V's minimum is 10, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is the next lowest in the V category, which is 29, but that's not an option either. So maybe the question is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrongly. Let me think of the Saffir scale as a list of categories with their respective wind speed ranges:

1: 100-310 mph (strongest)
2: 70-99 mph (severe)
3: 50-69 mph (very strong)
4: 30-49 mph (very severe)
5:10-29 mph (very severe)

So the slowest category is 5, which is 10-29. So the minimum possible is 10. But the options don't have any 10 or 29. So perhaps the question is wrong, but I'm supposed to choose the next possible. Alternatively, perhaps the question is in reverse and the slowest is the highest possible in V, which is 29. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking for the slowest wind speed possible according to the scale. So the slowest is in V, but the options don't have 10. So the next possible is IV, which is 30, but option D is 50. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the minimum of V, which is 10, but since it's not an option, perhaps I'm supposed to choose the highest possible in V, which is 29, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should pick the highest option given, which is option J:110. But that can't be right either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum wind speed a category IV hurricane can have. The maximum for IV is 49. But the options don't have 49.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is that a hurricane can't have a wind speed lower than a certain point. But I think I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: the Saffir-Simpson scale's wind speed thresholds in mph are:

I: 100-310
II:70-99
III:50-69
IV:30-49
V:10-29

So the slowest possible is V, which is 10-29. But the options don't include 10, so perhaps the answer intended is the minimum in IV, which is 30. But the options don't have 30. So perhaps the answer is 50, which is option D.

Wait, but that's an incorrect assumption because IV's minimum is 30. So perhaps the question is wrong, but assuming that the options are correct, the answer would be 50, which is the next possible category.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick and the correct answer is 50, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the maximum wind speeds for each category. So the maximum for V is 29, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is the maximum of IV, which is 49, but the options don't have that. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the letters with the order. For example, maybe the letters in the scale are arranged as I being the strongest, and V being the weakest. So the slowest is V, which is 10-29. But the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the maximum possible wind speed of a category IV hurricane, which is 49 mph. But that's not an option either. So perhaps the intended answer is 50, which is the minimum of IV.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because IV's minimum is 30, and the maximum is 49. So the correct answer must be 30, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is 50.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the maximum wind speed, but that's not what it's saying.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the question as: What is the minimum wind speed a category IV hurricane can have according to the Saffir scale? The answer would be 30, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is 50. But that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is wrong and the answer is not among the options. But the question must have an answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the maximum wind speed for a category IV hurricane, which is 49 mph, but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the possible answer based on the letters. The Saffir scale has letters I to V, each representing a wind speed range. The letters are arranged in order of increasing wind speed. So I is the strongest, V is the weakest.

So the slowest category is V, but in the options, the lowest is 50. So perhaps the answer is 50, because that's the minimum possible for any category.

Wait, but that can't be right because the minimum of IV is 30, which is lower than 50. So the correct answer should be 30, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is wrong, but the intended answer is 50.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the letters with the maximums. Let's think of the maximums:

I:310
II:99
III:69
IV:49
V:29

So the slowest category is V, with a maximum of 29. So the minimum possible is 10 for V. Since the options don't have 10, perhaps the answer is 50, which is the next possible.

But I'm not confident about this. So perhaps the answer is option D:50.
</think>

The Saffir-Simpson scale categorizes wind speeds into five categories based on their intensity. The slowest category is V, which has a wind speed range of 10-29 mph. However, since the options provided start at 50 mph, and there is no 10 mph in the options, the next possible minimum wind speed for a category IV hurricane (30-49 mph) is not directly listed. Therefore, the answer provided is option D:50, which is the minimum wind speed among the given options. 

ANSWER: D
