Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the heat required to convert ice to vapor. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you convert ice to water, you go through the fusion (melting) process, then heating the water to boiling, and then vaporizing it. Oh wait, and then you would heat the vapor to 100°C. But wait, the question says it's converted to vapor at 100°C, which I think is just the boiling point. So maybe the last step isn't needed.

So the steps are: ice (0°C) → water (100°C), then water → steam (100°C). Oh, wait, no, I think the ice warms up to 0°C, then melts into water at 0°C, then that water warms up to 100°C, then vaporizes into steam at 100°C. So that's three steps.

Let me jot down the given values:

Heat of fusion (ΔH_fusion) = 80 cal/g
Heat of vaporization (ΔH_vaporization) = 540 cal/g
Specific heat (c) = 1 cal/g°C

We have 10 grams of ice. So four steps:

1. Ice at 0°C → Water at 0°C: no heat change here because it's just warming from 0 to 0. So that's zero.

2. Water at 0°C → Water at 100°C: this requires heating. The formula is q = m * c * ΔT. So m=10g, c=1 cal/g°C, ΔT=100-0=100°C. So q1 = 10g * 1 cal/g°C * 100°C = 1000 cal.

3. Water at 100°C → Steam at 100°C: this is vaporization. Using q = m * ΔH. So m=10g, ΔH=540 cal/g. So q2 = 10g * 540 cal/g = 5400 cal.

So total heat required is q1 + q2 = 1000 + 5400 = 6400 cal. Let me check the options. Looking at the choices:

Option I is 6400 calories. So that's the answer. Wait, but wait—another thought: sometimes when you convert ice to water, you also need to consider the heat for melting, which is another process. Oh wait, the heat of fusion is already part of the first step. So no, I don't think I missed anything else. So yeah, 6400 calories is the total.

To determine the quantity of heat required to convert 10 g of ice at 0°C to vapor at 100°C, the process involves three steps:

1. **Melting the ice at 0°C to water at 0°C**: No heat change occurs because the temperature remains constant during melting.  
2. **Heating the water from 0°C to 100°C**: The heat required is calculated using the formula \( q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \).  
   - \( m = 10 \, \text{g} \),  
   - \( c = 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \),  
   - \( \Delta T = 100 - 0 = 100 \, \text{°C} \).  
   Thus, \( q_1 = 10 \cdot 1 \cdot 100 = 1000 \, \text{cal} \).

3. **Vaporizing the water at 100°C to steam at 100°C**: The heat required is calculated using \( q = m \cdot \Delta H \).  
   - \( m = 10 \, \text{g} \),  
   - \( \Delta H = 540 \, \text{cal/g} \).  
   Thus, \( q_2 = 10 \cdot 540 = 5400 \, \text{cal} \).

The total heat required is the sum of these steps:  
\( q_{\text{total}} = q_1 + q_2 = 1000 + 5400 = 6400 \, \text{cal} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is **6400 calories**.
