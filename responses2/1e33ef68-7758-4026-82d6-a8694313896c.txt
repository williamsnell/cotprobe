Okay, so I have this problem here about estimating the maximum error in the area of a rectangle using differentials. Let me see, the rectangle has a length of 30 cm and a width of 24 cm, with each measurement having an error of at most 0.1 cm. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with maximum errors, differentials are a good way to approximate.

Alright, so the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, right? So A = l * w. Now, to find the error in the area, ΔA, I think we can use differentials. The differential of A with respect to l and w would be dA = (∂A/∂l) dl + (∂A/∂w) dw.

Let's compute the partial derivatives. The partial derivative of A with respect to l is just w, because if you take the derivative of l*w with respect to l, you get w. Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to w is l. So dA = w * dl + l * dw.

Given that the length l is 30 cm, and the width w is 24 cm. The maximum error in each measurement is 0.1 cm. So dl and dw can each be as large as 0.1 cm, but since we're looking for the maximum error, I think we take both errors into account. So plugging in the numbers: dA = 24 cm * 0.1 cm + 30 cm * 0.1 cm.

Calculating that: 24 * 0.1 is 2.4, and 30 * 0.1 is 3.0. Adding them together gives 2.4 + 3.0 = 5.4 cm². So the estimated maximum error is 5.4 cm². Let me check the options.

Looking back at the options, option B is 5.4 cm². That seems to match. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I correctly compute the partial derivatives? Yeah, dA/dl is w, which is 24, and dA/dw is l, which is 30. The errors dl and dw are both 0.1 cm. Multiplying 24 by 0.1 gives 2.4, 30 by 0.1 is 3.0, and adding gives 5.4. So, yeah, the answer should be B.

To estimate the maximum error in the area using differentials, we start with the area formula \( A = l \times w \). The differential of the area is:

\[
dA = \frac{\partial A}{\partial l} dl + \frac{\partial A}{\partial w} dw = w \, dl + l \, dw
\]

Given \( l = 30 \, \text{cm} \), \( w = 24 \, \text{cm} \), and errors \( dl = dw = 0.1 \, \text{cm} \), we substitute:

\[
dA = 24 \times 0.1 + 30 \times 0.1 = 2.4 + 3.0 = 5.4 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Thus, the maximum error is **5.4 cm²**, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: **B**
