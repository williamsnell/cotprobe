Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about a gang member committing a crime. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a new gang member points a gun at a pedestrian and orders her to give him her expensive watch. She does that, tosses the watch to the gang leader, who then takes it. The pedestrian runs away. The question is what crime the gang leader committed.

First, I need to figure out what kind of crime the gang leader did. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Accomplice to robbery. That's when someone assists in a robbery without being the robber. But in this case, the gang leader didn't commit the robbery. He just received the watch and didn't take it himself. So maybe not this one.

Option B: Accessory before the fact to robbery. This means a person assists in a robbery before the fact. But here, the gang leader received the watch before the robbery, but he didn't participate in the robbery. He just picked it up. So I'm not sure if this is applicable.

Option C: Coercion. Coercion is a form of violence where someone forces another to do something without consent. The gang member ordered her to give the watch, which she did. But the gang leader didn't coerce; he just picked it up. So maybe not coercion.

Option D: No crime, as he didn't directly participate. Well, the gang leader didn't commit any crime, but the question is about what he did. But maybe this refers to not participating in the robbery itself. That's possible.

Option E: Theft by receiving. This is when someone receives property that was stolen and takes it without authorization. In this case, the gang leader received the watch from the gang member, which was stolen. So that fits theft by receiving.

Option F: Accessory after the fact to robbery. This is when someone assists in a robbery after the fact, meaning they received the stolen item before the robbery. The gang leader received the watch before the robbery and took it, so that might fit. But I'm a bit confused about the difference between before and after the fact. So, if the action of taking the watch was after the robbery, then maybe F applies. But in this case, the gang leader took it after receiving it, which is after the robbery. Hmm.

Option G: Aggravated assault. That's when someone attacks another person with deadly force. The gang member pointed a gun, which could be considered a threat, but the gang leader just picked up the watch. So probably not this.

Option H: Grand larceny. This is when someone steals property without authorization, usually for personal use. The gang member stole the watch, and the gang leader took it without authorization, so this could be applicable.

Option I: Conspiracy to commit robbery. This is when a group agrees to commit a crime together. The gang member ordered her to give the watch, but the leader didn't commit the robbery. So this doesn't fit.

Now, I'm a bit torn between E and H. Let me think again. Theft by receiving (E) is about receiving stolen property and taking it without authorization. Here, the gang leader received it and took it, so E fits. Grand larceny (H) is when someone steals without authorization, but the theft was done by the gang member, who is the robber. The gang leader's action is theft by receiving, because he received the stolen property from the gang member and took it.

Alternatively, H would be if the gang leader did the theft themselves. But he didn't; he just received it. So E is the correct answer.

The gang leader received the stolen watch and took it without authorization, which fits the definition of theft by receiving.

Answer: E: Theft by receiving.
