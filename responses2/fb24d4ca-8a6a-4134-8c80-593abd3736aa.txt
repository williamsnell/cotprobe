Question:

 If a global ban would not be effective in prohibiting genetic engineering that goes beyond eliminating obvious defects, then Singer suggests which "bolder" strategy?

Options:

A: none of the above
B: using a lottery system so everyone gets a fair chance at the benefits of genetic engineering
C: using sanctions and trade restrictions against countries that violate the ban
D: allowing genetic engineering only for medical purposes
E: promoting genetic engineering only for the wealthy
F: creating a global consensus on acceptable genetic engineering practices
G: developing a global regulatory body to monitor and control genetic engineering activities
H: implementing a global education program to convince people of the dangers of excessive genetic engineering
I: requiring genetic engineering for every newborn child
J: creating a world military that would enforce the ban with greater strength

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about genetic engineering and a ban. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that if a global ban wouldn't be effective because the genes causing the obvious defects aren't widely expressed, Singer suggests a "bolder" strategy. The options are A to J, each with a different approach.

Wait, I remember that Singer was a scientist who worked on genetic engineering. Oh right, he was involved in the germine project. He proposed some strategies to address the issues with genetically engineered organisms, especially regarding their potential for harmful genes.

So, the scenario is that the ban isn't effective because the "obvious" genes aren't expressed. That would mean that the genetic modification doesn't have a noticeable effect, so the ban might not be effective. But Singer didn't just suggest a "weaker" ban; he was looking to find a more bold way.

I think one of his strategies was to use sanctions against countries that violate the ban. Wait, but that might be the opposite of a bold strategy. Alternatively, maybe he was pushing for more comprehensive regulation rather than sanctions.

Wait, another approach is about monitoring and controlling the activities. Option G says developing a global regulatory body to monitor and control. That sounds like a more comprehensive approach, possibly more bold than the ban itself.

Alternatively, option E is promoting genetic engineering only for the wealthy. That's more of a restriction, not a bold strategy in the sense of control.

Option D is allowing only medical uses. That's a very restrictive approach, which might not be bold.

Option F is creating a global consensus. That's a pretty bold strategy, but I'm not sure if it's the same as the other options.

Wait, Singer's strategies I think included monitoring and preventing gene modification activities. So, if the ban isn't effective because the genes aren't expressed, then maybe he suggests monitoring to prevent such issues. So option G sounds right.

But wait, another thought. I recall that one of his ideas was to create a regulatory body to monitor and control activities, which would prevent the spread of harmful genes. Another strategy was about ensuring safety by not allowing the use of genes that cause obvious defects. But if the defect isn't expressed, maybe the regulation would cover more.

Alternatively, I think the "bolder" strategy he suggested was implementing a global regulatory body. So option G.

Wait, another angle: the options include E, which is promoting only for the wealthy. That's a very restrictive approach, whereas a regulatory body (G) would be more comprehensive and bold.

So I think the correct answer is G: developing a global regulatory body to monitor and control genetic engineering activities.

The question revolves around Singer's strategies for addressing genetic engineering issues beyond obvious defects. If the ban isn't effective, Singer suggests a more bold approach. Among the options, developing a global regulatory body (G) provides a comprehensive and bold strategy by monitoring and controlling activities, preventing harmful gene use. This aligns with Singer's aim to prevent unintended consequences.
