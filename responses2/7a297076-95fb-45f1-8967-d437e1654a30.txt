Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out which expression is another way to show 8 multiplied by 6. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is asking for an equivalent expression to 8 x 6. The options are A to E. So first, let me calculate what 8 x 6 is. I know that 8 times 6 is 48. So any correct expression should equal 48.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (2x4)x6. Let's compute this. 2 times 4 is 8, and then 8 times 6 is also 48. So this seems correct. But wait, could there be another option that's also correct? I need to check all options.

Option B: (24+4)+6. Let's see. 24 plus 4 is 28, plus 6 is 34. That's not 48, so B is incorrect.

Option C: (2+4)x6. 2 plus 4 is 6, then 6 times 6 is 36, which isn't 48. So C is not correct.

Option D: (2x4) + 6. 2 times 4 is 8, plus 6 is 14. That's way too low. Not 48.

Option E: (16+16). That's 32, which is less than 48. So E is out.

Wait, but I thought A was correct, but let me double-check. Option A is (2x4)x6, which is 8 x 6, so that's correct. Alternatively, 8 is 2x4, so 8x6 is indeed (2x4)x6. So A is correct.

But wait, the question is asking for another way. Could there be another option that's also correct? Let me recheck. Hmm, I don't think so. Let me think again.

Alternatively, could (4x2) be another way? But that's the same as 8x6. Unless the question is about breaking down the multiplication into different factors, but 8 is 2x4, so (2x4)x6 is correct. 

Wait, but another way might be 6x2x4, which is the same as 8x6, but again, that's the same as option A. So the only correct option is A. The other options don't equal 48. So the correct answer must be A.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options include (2x4)x6, which is 8x6. Another way to think about it is, perhaps, using the distributive property. For example, 8x6 can be written as 8x(4+2), but that's 8x4 + 8x2, which is 32 + 16 = 48. So that's another way. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me see which option fits that.

Option B is (24+4)+6, which is 28+6=34. Not 48, so that's not it. Option C is (2+4)x6=6x6=36, which is less. So that's not correct.

Wait, but another approach could be to break down 8 into 4x2, so 8x6=4x2x6. So in terms of multiplication, that's (4x2)x6, which is option A. So that's correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me make it clear. 8x6 can be represented as 8 multiplied by 6, which is the same as 2 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 6, because 8 is 2 times 4. So option A is (2x4)x6, which equals 8x6.

Alternatively, using distributive property, 8x6= (4+2)x6=4x6+2x6=24+12=36, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the options given don't include that.

But in the given options, A is (2x4)x6, which is correct. So the answer is A.

The correct answer is A.
