Okay, so I've got this question here about the mass of 1 liter of CO at STP. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let's see if I can figure this out.

First, I remember that at STP, which is standard temperature and pressure, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So, if I can find out how many moles are in 1 liter of CO, I can then find the mass by multiplying by the molar mass.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Oh right, the molar volume at STP is 22.4 L/mol. So, moles = volume (in liters) divided by 22.4. So for 1 liter, that's 1 / 22.4 = approximately 0.04464 moles.

Now, the molar mass of CO is the sum of the atomic masses of C and O. Carbon's atomic mass is about 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen is about 16.00 g/mol. So adding them together, 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 g/mol.

So the mass should be moles multiplied by molar mass: 0.04464 mol * 28.01 g/mol. Let me do that multiplication.

0.04464 * 28 is approximately 1.246 g. But I should be more precise. Let me calculate 0.04464 * 28.01.

Wait, 0.04464 multiplied by 28 is 1.246 (because 0.04464 * 28 = 1.246). But since there's a .01, the total would be 1.246 + (0.04464 * 0.01) = 0.0004464. So adding that to the 1.246, we get approximately 1.2464464 grams.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.92g, which is too low. Option J is 1.25g. Oh wait, my calculation is about 1.246, which is approximately 1.25g. But that's not one of the options exactly. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the multiplication.

0.04464 * 28.01:

0.04464 * 28 = 1.246, and 0.04464 * 0.01 is 0.0004464. So 1.246 + 0.0004464 = 1.2464464g. Approximately 1.25g.

So matching this to the options, the answer would be E or J. But J is 1.25g, which is almost exactly what I got. However, looking again, some of the other options might be more precise.

Wait, let me think again. Oh, wait another thing. Did I make an error in the initial assumption about the molar volume? No, I think I got that right. 22.4 L/mol is correct at STP.

So, the mass is about 1.246g, which is approximately 1.25g. Looking at the options, J is 1.25g.

Wait, but I'm seeing another thought here. Some students might forget to account for the volume correctly. Oh, no, I think I did it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the options don't match exactly. Let me check the options again:

Options:

A:1.67g

B:1.80g

C:1.14g

D:2.20g

E:0.92g

F:1.5g

G:1.0g

H:0.86g

I:2.0g

J:1.25g

So, J is 1.25g. That matches my calculation. So the correct answer must be J.

To determine the mass of 1 liter of carbon monoxide (CO) at standard temperature and pressure (STP), we start by using the molar volume of gases at STP, which is 22.4 liters per mole. 

1. **Calculate the number of moles in 1 liter of CO:**
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Volume (in liters)}}{\text{Molar volume}} = \frac{1}{22.4} \approx 0.04464 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Determine the molar mass of CO:**
   - Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12.01 g/mol.
   - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16.00 g/mol.
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of CO} = 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

3. **Calculate the mass of 1 liter of CO:**
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar mass} = 0.04464 \, \text{mol} \times 28.01 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 1.246 \, \text{g}
   \]

4. **Compare with the options:**
   - The calculated mass is approximately 1.25 g.
   - Among the options, J corresponds to 1.25 g.

Thus, the correct answer is **J: 1.25 g**.
