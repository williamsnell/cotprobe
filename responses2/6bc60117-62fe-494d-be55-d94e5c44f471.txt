Okay, so I've got this question about the 'extension pattern' identified by Parker (1976). I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Parker identified as this pattern. The options are A to H. Let me recall what I know about extension patterns.

From what I remember, extension patterns refer to the ways in which people balance work and leisure. Parker's model proposed that people have a certain way of working, which influences their time off. His theory suggests that people have a natural tendency to work during off-peak hours, which allows them more time to spend on leisure activities.

So looking at the options:

A: Part-time employees integrating work and leisure. I'm not sure about this. Maybe this is more about individual differences, but I thought it was about the general tendency.

B: Neutral balance as neither connected nor oppositional, like semi-skilled workers. This sounds like Parker was suggesting that people have a neutral state where they don't feel connected to work but also don't see work as a problem. That's his main idea.

C: Students working during leisure. I don't think that's the main point. It sounds more like a specific student behavior, maybe a different pattern.

D: Unskilled workers escaping from idle leisure. Again, that's more about a specific type of person, not the general pattern.

E: Full-time employees have a neutral balance. Oh wait, that's what I was thinking. Full-time workers see work and leisure as neutral, neither connected nor opposed, which is what Parker described.

F: Manual workers escaping from work. I don't recall this being a key point in his model. It might be more about people who find work a way to escape from their leisure, but that's not the pattern he identified.

G: Homemakers and their chores. Not sure how relevant this is. Maybe it's a different area.

H: Students working late. That seems more related to time management than extension patterns.

I: Professionals with work interests in leisure. That seems similar to E, but I think E is a more general statement about full-time employees.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So I think E is correct, as it refers to full-time employees having a neutral balance. Let me double-check.

Parker's model says that full-time employees have a neutral balance between work and leisure. So the extension pattern is that they don't see work as a problem or a necessity, so they can take time off. That's option E.

So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: a neutral balance between work and leisure as both connected and oppositional, as evidenced by full-time employees.

Answer: E
