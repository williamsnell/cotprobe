Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about double-slit interference. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the problem says that two narrow slits are illuminated with red light, which has a wavelength of 694.3 nm. The setup produces bright bands on a screen that's 3 meters away from the slits. The distance between the bands is 1.50 cm. I need to find the distance between the slits.

Wait, double-slit interference... I remember that the formula relates the wavelength, the distance to the screen, the distance between the slits, and the order of the bright bands. Oh right, the formula is d sin(theta) = m lambda, where d is the slit separation, lambda is the wavelength, and m is the order of the fringe.

But wait, I think this is often approximated when the angle is small, so sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) ≈ y/L, where y is the distance from the central maximum to the fringe on the screen, and L is the distance from the slits to the screen. That should probably be the case here because the distance between two adjacent bright bands is given, which is the same as the fringe spacing.

So the distance between adjacent bright bands, let's call that delta_y. The formula for delta_y, I think, is (lambda * L) / d. Because for each order m, the position y is approximately (m lambda L)/d, so the difference between adjacent m's would be lambda L / d.

So yeah, delta_y equals (lambda * L) / d. We need to solve for d, so d = (lambda * L) / delta_y.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. Lambda is 694.3 nm. Oh wait, I need to convert that to meters, right? Because the other units are in meters and centimeters.

So 694.3 nm is 694.3e-9 meters. L is 3.00 meters. Delta_y is 1.50 cm, which is 0.015 meters.

Putting it into the formula: d = (694.3e-9 m * 3.00 m) / 0.015 m.

Let me compute the numerator first. 694.3e-9 *3 is 2082.9e-9. So that's 2.0829e-6 meters.

Divide that by 0.015 m: 2.0829e-6 / 0.015 = approximately 1.3886e-4 meters. Convert that to mm, because the options are in mm. 1.3886e-4 m is 0.13886 mm. Let me round that to about 0.139 mm.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.139mm. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I use the correct formula? Oh, right, because I used delta_y = (lambda L)/d. Which is correct for the spacing between adjacent bright fringes. So yes, that's right.

Another thing: the order of the fringes. The formula assumes that m is the order (like m=0 is the central maximum, m=1 is the first bright band, etc.). But the question just says "the distance between the bands", which is delta_y regardless of m. So the formula holds.

So yeah, the calculation should be correct. So the answer is J.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the distance between bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern:

\[
\Delta y = \frac{\lambda L}{d}
\]

where:
- \(\Delta y\) is the distance between adjacent bright fringes,
- \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of light,
- \(L\) is the distance from the slits to the screen,
- \(d\) is the distance between the slits.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\lambda L}{\Delta y}
\]

### Given values:
- Wavelength, \(\lambda = 694.3 \, \text{nm} = 694.3 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\),
- Distance to the screen, \(L = 3.00 \, \text{m}\),
- Distance between adjacent fringes, \(\Delta y = 1.50 \, \text{cm} = 0.015 \, \text{m}\).

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{(694.3 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m})(3.00 \, \text{m})}{0.015 \, \text{m}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(694.3 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m})(3.00 \, \text{m}) = 2.0829 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now divide by \(\Delta y\):

\[
d = \frac{2.0829 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2}{0.015 \, \text{m}} = 1.3886 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}
\]

Convert to millimeters:

\[
d = 1.3886 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m} = 0.13886 \, \text{mm} \approx 0.139 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Conclusion:
The distance between the slits is approximately \(0.139 \, \text{mm}\), which corresponds to option J.
