Okay, so I've got this question about a logical fallacy. The question is asking which fallacy someone commits when they argue that someone couldn't have done something good because they hold a particular position. The options are A through D: Guilt by association, False dilemma, Reprehensible personality, and False dichotomy.

Hmm, I need to think about what each of these terms means. Let me break them down one by one.

First, guilt by association. I remember that's when someone believes someone else did something good because they think the person they associate with did it. Like, if I think my friend did a job well because I know they did it, I might say they're guilty of a good action. That sounds like an association fallacy, so guilt by association would be an incorrect reasoning.

Next, False dilemma. A false dilemma is when someone presents two options that are both presented as extremes but don't actually cover all possible situations. For example, saying that a person could be a liar or honest, but neither is a neutral option. This creates a false barrier between the two extremes, making it seem like neither is a viable option.

Reprehensible personality refers to the idea that someone's behavior is similar to a more extreme version of themselves. So, if someone argues they held a position that led to a particular outcome, they might generalize to the same level as their actual behavior. But I'm not sure if this is a fallacy in the same way as guilt by association.

Finally, False dichotomy is when someone presents two options as the only possibilities, but in reality, there are more alternatives. For example, saying that a person could be lying or honest, but not considering other possibilities like deception or something else.

So the question is about an argument that someone couldn't have done something good because they hold a particular position. So, the person is arguing that their position precludes the good outcome. 

If someone argues their position precludes a good action, they might be committing guilt by association. For instance, if I think my position restricts me from being a good person, I might argue that they did something wrong because I associate with them. That would be guilt by association.

Alternatively, looking at the other options: False dilemma involves presenting two extremes as the only possibilities, which might not apply here unless the position is presented as the only way. False dichotomy is about more alternatives than presented, which might not fit either.

So the fallacy here is guilt by association because the person is using their position as a justification for a bad action, implying that the person does something because they associate with it.

The fallacy committed in this scenario is guilt by association.
