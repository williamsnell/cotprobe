Okay, so I've got this physics question about blackbodies and the radiation they emit. Hmm, I remember something about the energy radiated from a blackbody being related to its temperature. Oh right, it's the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says that the power radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Wait, let me think about the formula. I think it's P = σ * A * T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the area, and T is temperature.

So the question says the temperature is increased by a factor of 3. That means the new temperature is 3T. Oh wait, what happens when you raise temperature to the fourth power? Let's calculate the factor. (3T)^4 is 3^4 * T^4, which is 81*T^4. So the new power is 81 times the original. So the energy radiated per second per unit area increases by a factor of 81.

Looking at the options, option E is 'increases by a factor of 81' and option J is 'increases by a factor of 3'. Wait, wait, no—option J says 3. No, E is 81, J is 3. So the answer should be E.

Wait, did I get the increase right? Let me double-check. Let's say the initial temperature is T, and the power is P = σA T^4. When T becomes 3T, P becomes σA (3T)^4 = 81σA T^4 = 81P. So yes, it's 81 times larger. So the correct option is E.

To determine how the energy radiated per second per unit area changes when the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law: \( P = \sigma A T^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, \( A \) is the area, and \( T \) is the absolute temperature.

If the temperature increases by a factor of 3, the new temperature is \( 3T \). Substituting this into the formula, the new power radiated per second per unit area is:

\[
P' = \sigma A (3T)^4 = \sigma A \cdot 3^4 \cdot T^4 = 81 \cdot \sigma A T^4 = 81P
\]

Thus, the energy radiated per second per unit area increases by a factor of 81. Among the given options, the correct choice is **E: Increases by a factor of 81**.
