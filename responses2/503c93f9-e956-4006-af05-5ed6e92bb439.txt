Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Nagel's work on the moral luck problem. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Nagel says about the moral luck problem. The options are A through J. I remember from my studies that the moral luck problem has to do with why we have moral responsibility because of luck, not because of our actions. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure.

Option A says that moral theories don't take into account luck. That sounds familiar. I think Nagel's main point was that moral theories don't account for luck because they don't consider that events beyond our control might affect our moral obligations. So, for example, if a person is killed because of a random event outside their control, they're still morally obligated to help others. But if we don't consider this, our theories would be off.

Option B suggests too much emphasis on individual responsibility. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. I think Nagel was more concerned with luck, not the weight of responsibility. The problem isn't about whether we should do something, but why we have a moral obligation to act.

Option C: our understanding is limited by inability to predict outcomes. I think that's more about the problem of induction, not the moral luck issue. Nagel was talking about the role of chance beyond our control, not our inability to predict future events.

Option D talks about self-dissolution through the absorption of acts into events. That sounds more like a problem with free will or maybe the idea that our actions determine the world. But that's not the same as luck affecting our moral obligations.

Option E: focus on chance in human actions. Oh, that's similar to D. It's about chance in our actions leading to consequences. But the moral luck problem is about luck influencing our moral obligations regardless of our actions. So E might be a possible answer, but I'm not sure if it's the same as Nagel's point.

Option F: apply stringent standards. I don't think Nagel would suggest that. His work was about the role of luck, not arbitrary standards.

Option G: morality depends on luck. That's a direct statement. So Nagel might have said that morality is contingent on luck, meaning it's not about our actions but the occurrence of events beyond our control.

Option H: theories are off-track. That's a general statement, so it could be a broader issue, but I'm not sure if it's specific to luck.

Option I: theories of action are off-track. Similar to H, it's about the direction of our theories.

Option J: concept of luck incompatible with morality. That makes sense because if luck is about random events outside our control, and morality is about what's right in the world, they don't align.

Wait, I'm a bit torn between G and J. The question is about the problem of moral luck. I think Nagel's original paper, "The Problem of Moral Luck," posits that morality isn't determined by our actions because there's an element of chance. So the concept of luck is incompatible with morality. So J might be the correct answer.

Alternatively, G says that morality is entirely dependent on luck. That's a strong statement, but I'm not sure if it's accurate. Maybe Nagel's view is more about the role of luck in determining moral obligations, not that morality is entirely dependent on it.

Wait, another angle. Nagel's point is that moral theories don't account for luck because it's not our choices causing luck. So luck affects our moral obligations regardless of what we do. So the moral theories are incomplete because they don't address this.

So the correct answer is J: the concept of luck is incompatible with morality. Because morality is about right and wrong in the world, not due to random events outside our control.

The question revolves around understanding Nagel's stance on the moral luck problem, which concerns how luck influences moral obligations rather than our actions. Nagel argues that luck outside our control affects our moral obligations, making morality independent of our choices. The correct answer is J: the concept of luck is incompatible with the concept of morality. This aligns with Nagel's assertion that luck is a fundamental aspect of morality, beyond our control. 

Answer: J
