Okay, so I've got this problem about a satellite's path defined by parametric equations. The question is asking for the upward velocity at t = 1. Hmm, let me think... I remember that velocity is related to the derivative of the position with respect to time. But wait, there's a catch because it's a parametric equation, not just x(t) and y(t). So the velocity vector would be the derivatives of x and y with respect to time.

The equations are x = 4 cos(t) + cos(12t), and y = 4 sin(t) + sin(12t). So to find the velocity at any time t, I need to compute dx/dt and dy/dt.

Let's start with dx/dt. The derivative of 4 cos(t) is -4 sin(t), right? And the derivative of cos(12t) is -12 sin(12t). So putting that together, dx/dt = -4 sin(t) - 12 sin(12t).

Similarly, for dy/dt: the derivative of 4 sin(t) is 4 cos(t), and the derivative of sin(12t) is 12 cos(12t). So dy/dt = 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t).

Wait, but the question asks for the upward velocity. Hmm, velocity has both horizontal and vertical components. So the upward direction is along the positive y-axis. So the vertical component (dy/dt) is what matters here.

So at t=1, I need to compute dy/dt. Let's plug in t=1.

First, calculate cos(1) and sin(1). I think cos(1 radian) is approximately 0.5403 and sin(1) is about 0.8415. But wait, the arguments are in radians because the calculus functions often assume radians.

So for dy/dt at t=1:

dy/dt = 4 cos(1) + 12 cos(12*1) = 4*(0.5403) + 12*(cos(12)).

What's cos(12)? Wait, 12 radians is more than 2π (which is about 6.28), so 12 - 2π is about 12 - 6.28 = 5.72 radians. That's still more than π, so cos(12) is cos(5.72). Let's calculate cos(5.72). Cos(5.72) is in the fourth quadrant, so it's positive. Alternatively, using a calculator, cos(12 radians) is approximately cos(12) ≈ -0.84385 (I think that's correct because 12 is about 12 - 3*2π = 12 - 18.85 ≈ negative angle, so maybe cos(12) is the same as cos(12 - 4π) since 4π is about 12.566, so 12-12.566 is negative, but cos is even, so same as cos(0.566). Cos(0.566) is about 0.84385. Wait, but wait 12 radians is 12*(π/6) = 2π * (12/(2π)) )? No, wait, 2π is about 6.283 radians. So 12 is 12/6.283 ≈ 1.909, so about 1.909 * 2π ≈ 12 radians. So 12 radians is equivalent to 12 - 2π *1 = 12 - 6.283 = 5.717 radians. That's in the fourth quadrant where cosine is positive. So cos(5.717) ≈ 0.84385. So cos(12) ≈ 0.84385.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. Alternatively, let me compute 12 radians numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using a calculator. But I'm not sure about the exact value here. But I'll proceed with the approximate values.

So cos(12) ≈ 0.84385.

So 12 * cos(12) ≈ 12 * 0.84385 ≈ 10.1262.

So the term 12 cos(12) is approximately 10.1262.

Now, the 4 cos(1) term: cos(1) is about 0.5403, so 4 * 0.5403 = 2.1612.

Adding those together: 2.1612 + 10.1262 = 12.2874.

Wait, but wait, what is the unit here? The question asks for the upward velocity, which is the vertical component. So the value I get is approximately 12.2874. But wait, looking at the options, option I is 12.287, which matches. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the sign. Because when I computed dy/dt, it's 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t). So substituting t=1:

4 * cos(1) is positive, 12 * cos(12) is positive. So 4*0.5403 is 2.1612, 12 * 0.84385 is ~10.1262, so sum is 12.2874.

But the options are A to J, and option I is 12.287. So that's what I get. But wait, wait another thing. Wait, the first option is 8.984, which is option A, which is smaller than 12.287. So I'm getting 12.287, which is option I.

But wait, wait a second. Wait, I must have made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. Because the upward velocity is the vertical component. But let me think again. The velocity vector has components dx/dt and dy/dt. The vertical component is dy/dt, which is the upward velocity. So dy/dt is positive when the velocity is upward.

So if I computed it correctly, the upward velocity is about 12.287, which is option I. But wait, looking at the options again, the options given are A to J. So option I is 12.287, which is in the options.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought perhaps the satellite's path is more complicated, but maybe the velocity is just the derivative.

Wait, another thought. Let me recheck the calculations step by step.

Compute dy/dt at t=1.

dy/dt = 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t).

At t=1:

4 cos(1) = 4 * 0.5403 ≈ 2.1612.

12 cos(12) = 12 * cos(12 radians) ≈ 12 * 0.84385 ≈ 10.1262.

Adding together: 2.1612 + 10.1262 = 12.2874. So that's approximately 12.287.

Looking at the options, option I is 12.287. So the answer should be I.

To determine the upward velocity of the satellite at \( t = 1 \), we compute the derivatives of the parametric equations \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), which represent the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity, respectively. The velocity vector is given by \( \left( \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt} \right) \). Since the upward direction corresponds to a positive \( \frac{dy}{dt} \), we focus on this component.

The parametric equations are:
\[
x = 4 \cos(t) + \cos(12t), \quad y = 4 \sin(t) + \sin(12t).
\]

The derivatives are:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -4 \sin(t) - 12 \sin(12t),
\]
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = 4 \cos(t) + 12 \cos(12t).
\]

To find the upward velocity at \( t = 1 \), we evaluate \( \frac{dy}{dt} \):
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = 4 \cos(1) + 12 \cos(12).
\]

Using approximate values:
- \( \cos(1) \approx 0.5403 \),
- \( \cos(12) \approx 0.84385 \),

we calculate:
\[
4 \cos(1) \approx 4 \times 0.5403 = 2.1612,
\]
\[
12 \cos(12) \approx 12 \times 0.84385 = 10.1262.
\]

Adding these:
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} \approx 2.1612 + 10.1262 = 12.2874.
\]

The upward velocity at \( t = 1 \) is approximately \( 12.287 \), which corresponds to option I.
