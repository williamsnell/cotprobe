Question:

An amoeba is placed in a puddle one day, and on that same day it splits into two amoebas. The next day, each new amoeba splits into two new amoebas, and so on, so that each day every living amoeba splits into two new amoebas. After one week, how many amoebas are in the puddle? (Assume the puddle has no amoebas before the first one is placed in the puddle.)

Options:

A: 8192
B: 4096
C: 2048
D: 64
E: 1024
F: 16384
G: 32
H: 512
I: 256
J: 128

Okay, so I've got this question about amoebas splitting each day. Let me try to figure it out. Alright, the problem says that on the first day, an amoeba is placed in a puddle. Then, each day after that, every living amoeba splits into two. So, each day, the number of amoebas doubles.

Wait, the question is about how many amoebas are there after one week. A week has 7 days, right? So, the first day is day 1 with one amoeba. Then day 2, each splits into two, so two. Day 3, each of those two splits into two, making four. Hmm, so it's like each day the number doubles. So, for n days, the number of amoebas would be 2^(n-1), because on day 1 it's 2^0=1, day 2 it's 2^1=2, day 3 2^2=4, and so on.

Wait, so after one week, which is 7 days, starting from day 1. Let me count the days:

Day 1: 1 amoeba
Day 2: 2
Day 3:4 
Day 4:8
Day5:16
Day6:32
Day7:64

Wait, that's 64 amoebas on the 7th day. Looking at the options, option D is 64. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because sometimes people count the days differently. Like, if the first day is day 0, but no, the question says that the first day is when the amoeba is placed, so day 1 is the first day. So the calculation is correct. Each day after that, the number doubles.

Alternatively, the problem says each day the amoeba splits into two. So on day 1, 1 amoeba. Then on day 2, each of those two (no, wait: day 1 is the first day, so the first amoeba on day 1. Then day 2, that one splits into two. So on day 2, two amoebas.

Wait, no, the problem says on the same day, each living amoeba splits into two. So after day 1, it's one amoeba. The next day (day 2), that single amoeba splits into two, so two. The day after (day 3), those two each split into two, making four. So each day, the number of amoebas is multiplied by two.

So after n days, the number is 2^(n-1) because day 1 is 2^0=1. So for n=7, that's 2^6=64. So the answer is D:64.
</think>

The amoebas double each day, starting with 1 on day 1. After 7 days, the number of amoebas is \(2^{6} = 64\).

Answer: D
