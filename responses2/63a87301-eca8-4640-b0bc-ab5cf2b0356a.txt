Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me. Let's see what it's about. I'm trying to figure it out step by step.

The question is about the pH of two lakes, Lake A and Lake B. Lake A has a pH of 8.0, and Lake B has a pH of 6.0. I need to determine which of the given statements is correct.

First, I remember that pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution. A pH of 7 is neutral, below 7 is acidic (weakly), and above 7 is basic (weakly). So, a lower pH means more acidic, and a higher pH means more basic.

So, comparing the two: Lake A is pH 8, which is basic. Lake B is 6, which is more acidic. So, Lake B is more alkaline than Lake A. That means option A says Lake B is alkaline. Wait, option A says "Lake B is alkaline." But wait, when I think about this, lower pH is more acidic, so higher pH would mean less acidic, more basic. So, the alkalinity here is the opposite. So option A is incorrect because it's the opposite of what's true.

Option B says Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than A. Wait, I need to think about the relationship between pH and the concentration of hydrogen ions. The pH scale is logarithmic. The formula is pH = -log[H+]. So, if I have the pH values, I can find the [H+] for each lake.

For Lake A: pH=8 → [H+] = 10^-8 M. For Lake B: pH=6 → [H+] = 10^-6 M.

So, the ratio of [H+] in B to A is (10^-6)/(10^-8) = 10^2 = 100. So, the hydrogen ion concentration is 100 times higher in Lake B than in Lake A. But the question is about the alkalinity, not the [H+]. So, the concentration isn't what determines how alkaline; it's more about the pH.

Wait, the options are about the alkaline levels. So, statement B says Lake B is 100 times more alkaline. But the pH doesn't directly relate to the ratio of [H+]. So, I think option B is incorrect because it's mixing the pH ratio with the [H+] ratio. So, option B's statement is wrong.

Option C: The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 10^4 M? Wait, no, Lake B's [H+] is 10^-6, which is 0.000001 M. 10^4 is 10,000, which is much higher. So option C is incorrect because it's 10^-6, not 10^4. So C is wrong.

Option D: The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain. Acid rain is acidic, so it would lower the pH of the lakes. So, if both are made more acidic (due to acid rain), their pH would go down. So D is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about option D. Both would have their pH decrease, yes. But what if the rain affects only one of the lakes? But the question states that both are affected. So, D is correct.

To determine the correct statement about the two lakes, we analyze the given pH values and evaluate each option:

1. **Option A**: "Lake B is alkaline."  
   A pH of 8.0 for Lake A indicates it is basic, while a pH of 6.0 for Lake B indicates it is acidic. Since Lake B has a higher pH, it is more alkaline than Lake A. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.

2. **Option B**: "Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A."  
   While Lake B has a higher pH, the statement is misleading because pH measures the acidity or basicity, not the magnitude of alkalinity. The ratio of hydrogen ion concentrations ([H+] = 10^-8 M for Lake A and 10^-6 M for Lake B) is 100 times higher, not the alkalinity. Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.

3. **Option C**: "The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 10^4 M."  
   Lake B's pH is 6.0, so its hydrogen ion concentration is [H+] = 10^-6 M. The statement incorrectly claims a concentration of 10^4 M, which is far higher. Therefore, this statement is **incorrect**.

4. **Option D**: "The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain."  
   Acid rain is acidic, and a decrease in pH indicates reduced acidity. If both lakes are affected by acid rain, their pH will indeed decrease. This statement is **correct**.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
