Okay, I have this probability question here where I need to find the probability that X is greater than Y. X and Y are independent random variables. X follows a normal distribution with mean 5 and variance 16, so that's N(5,16). Y is N(6,9), which means mean 6 and variance 9. 

The question is asking for P(X > Y). I remember that when dealing with differences of two normal variables, the result is also a normal distribution. So I should probably compute X - Y first. 

Let me think: since X and Y are independent, the distribution of X - Y will be normal with mean equal to the difference of their means, and variance equal to the sum of their variances. So the mean of X - Y is 5 - 6 = -1. The variance would be 16 + 9 = 25, so the standard deviation is sqrt(25) = 5. Therefore, X - Y follows N(-1, 25).

Now, I need to find P(X - Y > 0). That's the same as P(X - Y > 0) which is P(X - Y > 0). Let me denote Z = X - Y, so Z ~ N(-1,5²). So I need to find P(Z > 0). 

To find this probability, I can standardize Z. The formula for standardizing is (Z - μ) / σ. So here, μ is -1, σ is 5. So (0 - (-1))/5 = 1/5 = 0.2. 

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I have that right. The Z is X - Y, so it's a new variable. So when we standardize, we're calculating how many standard deviations away from the mean our value is. So for Z = 0, (0 - (-1)) is 1, and dividing by 5 gives 0.2. So the z-score is 0.2. 

Now, I need to find the probability that Z is greater than 0, which is the same as the area under the standard normal curve to the right of z = 0.2. That's 1 - Φ(0.2), where Φ is the standard normal CDF.

Looking at standard normal tables or using a calculator, Φ(0.2) is approximately 0.5793. So 1 - 0.5793 = 0.4207. Hmm, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are A: 0.5873, B:0.5124, C:0.6915, D:0.4758, E:0.2431, F:0.4207, G:0.3256, H:0.3591, I:0.5389, J:0.2769.

Yes, option F is 0.4207. Wait a second, did I do the standardization correctly? Let me double-check.

Z = X - Y, so X ~ N(5,16) and Y ~ N(6,9). So X - Y ~ N(5 -6, 16 +9) = N(-1,25). So yes that's correct. Then, the standardization is (0 - (-1))/5 = 1/5 = 0.2. So Φ(0.2) is about 0.5793, so 1 - 0.5793 is 0.4207. So the answer should be F, 0.4207.

Wait, but looking back at the question, I realized that the question is asking for P(X > Y) which is the same as P(X - Y > 0). So that's correct. So yes, F is the right answer.

The question asks for $P(X > Y)$, which is equivalent to $P(X - Y > 0)$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent, $X - Y$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\mu = 5 - 6 = -1$ and variance $\sigma^2 = 16 + 9 = 25$, so $\sigma = 5$. The standardized variable $Z = (X - Y + 1)/5$ is standard normal. We need $P(Z > 0)$, which is $1 - \Phi(0.2)$. From standard normal tables, $\Phi(0.2) \approx 0.5793$, so $P(Z > 0) \approx 1 - 0.5793 = 0.4207$. 

Answer: F
