Okay, so I have this question about Amalgamated Corp. and their stock option. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the question says that the Vice President was given the option to buy 1000 shares at 95% of the day's average price. But wait, I'm a bit confused. I think I might have misread it. Oh, wait, no—actually, the question is about the option's price, not the average. The high for the day was 19 3/8, and the low was 18 3/4. So, I need to find the average price based on high and low, then apply the 95% option.

Hmm, right, so in stock options, the average price is often the average of the high and low during the day. So first, I should convert those mixed numbers to decimals to make it easier.

High was 19 3/8. Let me calculate that: 3/8 is 0.375, so 19 + 0.375 = 19.375.

Low was 18 3/4. 3/4 is 0.75, so 18 + 0.75 = 18.75.

Wait, wait, no—I think I got that reversed. Because 3/4 is more than 3/8. So 19 3/8 is higher than 18 3/4. So the high is 19.375 and the low is 18.75. So the average would be (19.375 + 18.75)/2.

Let me add those two: 19.375 + 18.75. Let's see, 19 + 18 is 37, 0.375 + 0.75 is 1.125. So total is 37 + 1.125 = 38.125. Then divide by 2: 38.125 / 2 = 19.0625.

So the average price is $19.0625 per share. Wait, but the option to buy is 95% of that average. So, 95% of 19.0625.

Wait, I need to calculate 0.95 multiplied by 19.0625. Let's do that.

Hmm, 19.0625 × 0.95. Let me break it down:

19.0625 × 0.95 = 19.0625 × (1 - 0.05) = 19.0625 - (19.0625 × 0.05).

Calculating 19.0625 × 0.05: 0.05 × 19 is 0.95, and 0.05 × 0.0625 is 0.003125. So total is 0.953125.

So subtracting that from 19.0625: 19.0625 - 0.953125 = ?

Let's compute that. 19.0625 is the same as 19 and 625/1000.

Wait, maybe it's easier to convert both to fractions or decimals.

Alternatively, 19.0625 is 19 + 0.0625. 0.0625 is 1/16. So 19 + 1/16 = 19.0625.

Multiplying 19.0625 by 0.95.

Hmm, maybe I can compute 19 × 0.95 and 0.0625 × 0.95, then add them.

19 × 0.95: 19 × 0.95 is the same as 19 × (1 - 0.05) = 19 - (19 × 0.05) = 19 - 0.95 = 18.05.

0.0625 × 0.95: 0.0625 is 1/16, so 1/16 × 0.95 = 0.059375.

So adding those together: 18.05 + 0.059375 = 18.109375.

So the price per share is $18.109375. Let me look at the options.

Looking back, option A is $18.109375 per share. So the correct answer would be A.
</think>

The correct answer is A: $18.109375 per share.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine the High and Low Prices:**
   - High for the day: 19 3/8 = 19.375
   - Low for the day: 18 3/4 = 18.75

2. **Calculate the Average Price:**
   - Average price = (High + Low) / 2 = (19.375 + 18.75) / 2 = 38.125 / 2 = 19.0625

3. **Apply the Option's 95% Discount:**
   - Discounted price = 19.0625 × 0.95 = 18.109375

Thus, the price per share at which the option is awarded is $18.109375.
