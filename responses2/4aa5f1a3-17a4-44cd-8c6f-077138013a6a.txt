Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"When the Portuguese go from Macao in China to Japan, they carry much white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain: and they bring from Japan nothing but silver. They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.
When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned."

Okay, so I've got this question about Portuguese trade patterns and a historical event that undid those patterns. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully to understand what it's asking. The question is about a passage from Ralph Fitch's 1599 book, which talks about Portuguese trade routes. The first paragraph mentions that the Portuguese from Macao go to Japan, bringing a lot of white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain. They bring nothing from Japan except silver. They have a carrack (which probably refers to a ship) going to Japan every year, bringing about 600 coins. But they also bring a lot of silver from Japan, plus more from India, using that silver to gain an advantage in China. They bring a lot of other things too, like gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and gilded items.

Then, the question states that when the Portuguese come to Canton in China, they have to stay there, enter their names in a book at the city gate, and leave at night putting out their names. They can't lie in the town all night but must leave via a boat outside. If someone remains, they're imprisoned.

The question is about which development in the 1750-1900 era undid these trade patterns. The options are A to D, each representing a different event.

I need to think about what each of these options does to the Portuguese's trade. The passage mentions that they bring a lot of valuable silver but nothing much from Japan. That's interesting because it suggests that their trade with Japan was limited, which might have affected the trade patterns.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: The discovery of goods that interested Chinese people. If China found new goods, it might have changed their purchasing patterns. For example, if China wanted luxury items or rare metals, they might have switched from importing large amounts of silver to importing other goods. If the passage mentioned that they were bringing a lot of silver, but perhaps they found other goods that were more desirable, that could change their trade.

Option B: Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas. Revolutions like the French Revolution or the American Revolution could have changed the way people thought about trade and resources. For example, if the revolution led to increased trade or disruption of certain trade routes, it might have affected the Portuguese's trade patterns. However, I'm not too sure about how this directly undid the specific trade mentioned in the passage.

Option C: The Industrial Revolution. This changed the production methods, probably leading to more efficient use of resources. If the passage mentioned that the Portuguese were bringing a lot of silver (which might have been a resource that's now being replaced by more valuable materials), the Industrial Revolution might have affected this. But I'm not certain. The passage is more about their sources of supplies, not about production methods. Alternatively, the shift from trade to manufacturing could change their trade patterns, but the options are about undid trade patterns, not production methods.

Option D: The colonization of Africa. If the Portuguese were colonizing Africa, then the passage's information might have been about their previous routes to China. For example, if they were involved in trade with China, but then started colonizing Africa, perhaps that changed their economic activities. However, the passage doesn't mention any mention of Africa, just their journey to China. So if the colonization happened, it might have changed their trade patterns, but not necessarily the ones described in the passage. Wait, the passage is about their journey to China, so perhaps the colonization of Africa happened after that. But the question is about a development that undid the trade patterns. So if the passage was about their journey to China, which involved a lot of silver and other materials, and perhaps the new patterns (like being in China) changed their trade, but the development that undoes it would be something else.

Wait, the passage is about their journey to Japan and the port of Canton. So the development they're asking about must be a change that affected their trade patterns.

Looking back, the passage says they bring a lot of silver, nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps their dependence on silver in Japan limited trade. If China discovered other valuable resources (like gold or silk), that could change their trade. For example, if the Chinese wanted to import precious metals or luxury goods, they might have switched from importing silver to importing gold or silk. That would require a discovery of such goods, which is option A.

Alternatively, if the passage mentions that they were bringing a lot of silver, perhaps a shift in trade or resource availability in Japan led to a change. Oh wait, the passage says they bring a lot of silver, nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps if Japanese resources changed, such as gold becoming more valuable, the Portuguese's trade would change.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is likely A or B. Let me think again. The passage says they're bringing a lot of silver, nothing from Japan. So perhaps when they went to Japan, they were bringing a lot of silver. But maybe the discovery of new resources in China (like gold or silk) would have allowed them to import those instead.

Wait, but the question is about when the Portuguese go from Macao to Japan, they bring a lot of silver. So in Japan, they bring nothing except silver. This could mean that the Chinese were importing a lot of silver from Japan, but if they found gold or other valuable items there, that would change their trade.

Alternatively, another angle: the passage says that the Portuguese bring a lot of white silk, gold, musk, porcelain, and so on. That suggests that the Chinese were interested in these items, which could have changed their trade patterns. But the passage also says they bring nothing from Japan except silver, which might imply that the Chinese were more interested in silver and other resources, not so much in gold or silk. So, if they were bringing a lot of silver, perhaps their trade with Japan was limited, and Chinese were discovering other resources.

Wait, but the passage says they bring a lot of silver, nothing from Japan. So perhaps the Chinese were interested in silver, not in other items. But the passage mentions that they bring a lot of gold, musk, etc. Maybe that's a point, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think of each option.

Option A: Chinese discovered goods. If China now has more valuable goods, the Portuguese would change their trade. For example, if they were importing gold, and Chinese now have more gold, they might switch. Alternatively, if they were importing silks, and Chinese have more silk, they would switch. So this could directly change their trade patterns, which the passage's description suggests.

Option B: Revolutions. Maybe the revolutions caused more trade or disruption, but I'm not certain. The passage doesn't directly mention revolution.

Option C: Industrial Revolution. This would change methods of production, perhaps leading to more efficient use of resources, but it's possible that the passage was about a specific trade route, not the revolution itself.

Option D: Colonization of Africa. If the Portuguese colonized Africa, then their trade patterns would change as they had access to resources there. But the passage doesn't mention any mention of African trade, so this might not be the case.

So the question is about which development undid the trade patterns mentioned in the passage. The passage talks about their journey to China, which involved bringing a lot of silver and nothing from Japan.

The passage says that when the Portuguese go to Japan, they bring a lot of silver, nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps if they're now in China, they must have acquired a lot of resources from Japan, which might have affected their trade patterns. But the options are about what development happened.

Wait, the options are about events in 1750-1900, and the passage is about their journey to China.

The passage says that when they go from Macao to Japan, they bring a lot of silver, nothing from Japan except silver. So the Chinese were importing a lot of silver from Japan, but maybe they also imported gold or other items, which is what the passage says.

Thus, if the Chinese had discovered other valuable items, say gold or silk, their trade would have changed. But the passage doesn't mention that. It says they bring gold, musk, etc., but nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps the passage's description is about their journey to Japan, but the question is about the port of Canton, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is about their journey to China, which is the main focus here. So if the passage mentions that they were bringing gold, musk, etc., and nothing from Japan except silver, perhaps that's a clue. But the question is about which event undid their trade patterns.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each option and which would affect their trade.

Option A: Chinese discovered goods, perhaps this changed their trade. For example, if they discovered gold, which is more valuable than silver, they would import more gold than silver. This would change their trade pattern. So if they were importing a lot of silver, this new discovery might have shifted their trade.

In the passage, the first sentence says: "they carry much white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain: and they bring from Japan nothing but silver." So the passage is about their journey to Japan, but the main question is about their journey to China. So perhaps the passage is about their journey to China, and the options are about what development happened then.

Wait, no, the passage is about their journey, but the question is about the development in the 1750-1900 period that undid the trade patterns.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me restate: The passage is about their journey to Japan, bringing a lot of silver, nothing from Japan except silver. So they were importing a lot of silver, and nothing else. But the question is about which event in the 1750-1900 period undid their trade patterns as they went to China. So perhaps the events in the options are about the trade patterns that were being changed by these events.

Wait, perhaps the passage is implying that their journey to Japan was limited in terms of resources, so their trade with Japan was less beneficial, so they didn't want to go there, leading them to other destinations. But the options are about events that might have changed their trade.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is about their journey to Japan (so their sources) but the question is about their trade patterns in China. But that's probably not the case.

Wait, the passage says that when they go to Japan, they bring a lot of silver, nothing from Japan except silver. So perhaps the Chinese were importing a lot of silver from Japan. So if they were importing a lot of silver, that might have limited their trade in Japan. But the passage also says they bring a lot of gold, musk, etc., which suggests that the Chinese were importing more than just silver.

So if the Chinese had discovered other valuable resources, their trade patterns would change. But the passage doesn't explicitly state that, so perhaps the development that undid their trade is the discovery of other goods (like gold or silk), which would change their trade.

But the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Option A: Chinese discovered goods that were more desirable (like gold) which would shift their trade.

Option B: Revolution would change trade patterns, but the passage doesn't mention that.

Option C: Industrial revolution, which affects production methods but not the supply of resources.

Option D: Colonization of Africa—change in trade patterns, but passage doesn't mention.

So the best fit would be option A. Because the passage is about their journey to Japan and bringing a lot of silver, but if they discovered gold, that would change their trade. So the development that would undid their trade patterns (by changing what they imported) is the Chinese discovering gold or other valuable items.

Wait, but option A says the Chinese discovered goods. The passage says they bring a lot of gold, musk, etc., so perhaps the Chinese discovered more valuable things. So the passage's statement about their journey to Japan implies that China was importing a lot of silver, but they also imported gold. So perhaps if gold became more valuable, they would switch to importing gold instead of silver.

So the development that would undid their trade patterns would be the Chinese discovering more valuable goods, which would make their trade with Japan less beneficial.

But the passage doesn't state that; it says they brought a lot of gold. So perhaps the development is the Chinese discovering more valuable items, which would change their trade patterns.

Looking back, the question is about which development in the 1750-1900 period undid the trade patterns. The passage is about their journey to Japan, which was limited, so perhaps their trade with Japan was less profitable, so they didn't go there.

Wait, but the options are about events in that period that would affect their trade. So maybe the development is the discovery of gold, which would shift their trade.

So I think the correct answer is A: The Chinese discovered goods that were more desirable in terms of their trade, making their trade patterns undid as they went to China.

Alternatively, the passage says they bring gold. If China's discovery of gold made it more valuable, they would switch from importing silver to importing gold.

So the development that happened in the 1750-1900 period is the Chinese discovering more valuable goods, which would cause the passage's trade patterns to change.
</think>

The question asks which development in the 1750–1900 period undid the trade patterns mentioned in the passage. The passage details the Portuguese's journey to Japan, emphasizing their reliance on silver and the absence of valuable items from Japan. The options provided are analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: The Chinese discovering goods that are more desirable in terms of trade would shift their trade patterns. For example, if gold became more valuable, they might import more gold than silver, changing their trade dynamics. This aligns with the passage's mention of gold and musk, suggesting a potential shift in what they imported, especially considering the passage's focus on their journey to China.

- **Option B**: Enlightenment revolutions would likely disrupt trade patterns, but the passage does not indicate any such events.

- **Option C**: The Industrial Revolution would affect production methods but not necessarily the availability or desirability of resources, making it less likely to undid the trade patterns described.

- **Option D**: Colonization of Africa would change trade patterns but does not relate to the Portuguese's journey to China or their specific trade with Japan.

Given the passage's emphasis on the Portuguese's journey to Japan and their reliance on silver, the most plausible development is the Chinese discovering more valuable goods, such as gold, which would alter their trade patterns. This development would shift their trade from importing silver to importing gold, aligning with the passage's mention of gold and musk.
