Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spring and work done. Let me try to work through it step by step. I remember something about springs and Hooke's Law, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The problem says a force of 30 N is needed to stretch a spring from its natural length of 12 cm to 15 cm. I need to find out how much work is done when stretching it from 12 cm to 20 cm.

Hmm, right. Work done on a spring is related to the force applied, and I think it's connected to the spring constant, k. Oh wait, Hooke's Law is F = kx, where x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. But wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly the same as the problem here. Because in this problem, the spring is stretched from its natural length, which is the equilibrium point. So the displacement x would be the extension from that point.

Wait, so if the spring is initially at 12 cm and is stretched to 15 cm, that's a displacement of 3 cm. So x is 3 cm, which is 0.03 meters. The force needed at that point is 30 N. So applying Hooke's Law, F = kx. So I can find k by rearranging F = kx, so k = F/x.

Let me compute that: F is 30 N, x is 0.03 m. So 30 / 0.03 equals... 1000 Newtons per meter. Oh, that's a pretty stiff spring. But that's okay, I guess.

Now, I need to find the work done when stretching the spring from 12 cm (natural length) to 20 cm. So the total displacement is 8 cm, which is 0.08 meters. But wait, no, wait. Wait, when you stretch a spring from its natural length, the x is the extension. So when we stretch it to 20 cm, the x is 20-12 =8 cm, which is 0.08 m.

But wait, the force varies as the spring is stretched. Hooke's Law is F = kx, which is a linear force. So the work done when stretching from x=0 (natural length) to x= x_f is the integral of F dx from 0 to x_f. Since F is kx, the integral would be (k/2)x² evaluated from 0 to x_f, which is (k/2) x_f².

Wait, so the work done W is (1/2)k x_f². But wait, what's x_f here? Wait, in the initial problem, the first stretch took the spring from 12 to 15, which is 3 cm. So in that case, x = 3 cm, F = 30 N. So k is 30 N / 0.03 m = 1000 N/m.

So when stretching to 20 cm, the total extension is 8 cm, which is 0.08 m. So the work done is (1/2)*1000 * (0.08)^2. Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.08 squared is 0.0064. 1000 * 0.0064 is 6.4. Half of that is 3.2 J. So the work done is 3.2 J. Let me look at the options. Option H is 5.5 J, D is 3.2 J. Oh wait, option D is 3.2 J. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because sometimes when you stretch a spring, the work done is the area under the force vs. displacement curve. Since F is proportional to x, the graph is a straight line from (0,0) to (x_f, F_f). The area under that curve is a triangle. So the work done is (1/2)*F_f * x_f.

Wait, but in this case, F_f is the force at x_f. Wait, in the initial problem, F at x = 0.03 m is 30 N. So F_f at x = 0.08 m would be k * 0.08 m. Which is 1000 * 0.08 = 80 N. Then area would be 0.5 * 80 * 0.08 = 3.2 J. So same result.

Wait, another way to think about it: the work done to stretch the spring from x=0 to x= x_f is (1/2)k x_f^2. Which again gives 3.2 J.

So the correct answer should be D: 3.2 J. Looking at the options, D is 3.2 J. So the answer is D.

To determine the work done in stretching the spring from 12 cm to 20 cm, we use Hooke's Law and the formula for work done on a spring. The force required to stretch the spring is given as 30 N at an extension of 3 cm (0.03 m). Using Hooke's Law, the spring constant \( k \) is calculated as:

\[
k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{30 \, \text{N}}{0.03 \, \text{m}} = 1000 \, \text{N/m}.
\]

The work done to stretch the spring from its natural length to a displacement \( x_f \) is given by:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} k x_f^2.
\]

When stretching the spring from 12 cm to 20 cm, the total displacement is \( x_f = 20 \, \text{cm} - 12 \, \text{cm} = 8 \, \text{cm} = 0.08 \, \text{m} \). Substituting the values:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} (1000 \, \text{N/m}) (0.08 \, \text{m})^2 = \frac{1}{2} (1000) (0.0064) = 3.2 \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the work done is 3.2 J. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:
