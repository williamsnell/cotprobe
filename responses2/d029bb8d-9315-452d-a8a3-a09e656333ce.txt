Okay, so I've got this physics question here about the Moon and the Earth. Hmm, let's think through this. The question is asking what happens to the Moon's motion if the force of gravity between the Moon and the Earth stops. I remember that gravity is what causes the Moon to orbit around the Earth. But wait, the question is about the Moon's rotation, not its revolution around the Earth.

Right, the Moon's orbit is a result of the gravitational pull between the Earth and the Moon. If gravity stops, the Moon would no longer be held in orbit around the Earth. So, in that case, the Moon would start moving on its own, right? Like it would go off on its own tangent. But wait, why would that be the case? Because if the centripetal force (which is gravity providing) is gone, the Moon would start moving in a straight line at the same speed it was moving before. That's the idea of inertia.

Wait, but the question is about rotation. The Moon has its own rotation too. So, rotation refers to spinning on its axis. Does the Moon's rotation change if the Earth's gravity stops? I think it's a separate issue. The Moon's rotation is due to the torque from the Earth's gravity, right? So if the Earth's gravity stops, the Moon would stop rotating on its axis. Because the torque comes from the gravitational pull, which is necessary for the Moon's rotation. So if that stops, the Moon would slow down or stop spinning. But the question is about the resulting motion of the moon. So the moon would start moving (falling) towards the Earth, and the Earth would move away due to the Moon's orbital motion. But the rotation would stop because the torque was provided by the moon's gravity.

Wait, but the options are about the Moon's motion. The question is: what's the resulting motion of the moon if gravity stops. Let's look at the options.

Option E says "It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth." Wait, that's confusing me. Because if gravity stops, the Moon would start moving towards the Earth, right? So it would fall into the Earth, not orbit. So it would not continue rotating. But option E says it continues rotating. So that can't be right.

Wait, let me make sure. The Moon's orbit is due to the gravitational pull between the Earth and Moon. If that stops, the Moon would start moving in a straight line. So the moon would no longer follow a circular orbit but would move on a path tangent to its orbit. But the question is about the Moon's rotation. So how does the rotation get affected?

Oh, wait, the Moon's rotation is caused by the tidal forces from the Earth's gravity. The Moon is tidally locked, meaning its rotation period is the same as its orbital period. So if the moon's rotation period changes, but in this scenario, the Earth's gravity stops. But wait, no, because the Earth's gravity is the cause of the Moon's orbit and rotation. If it stops, the tidal forces would change. Hmm, but in the scenario, the question is about the motion of the moon itself, not the Earth's.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is conceptual: when gravity no longer exists, the Moon would stop orbiting and start moving on its own. So the moon would fall towards the Earth, and the Earth would move away. But does that affect the rotation of the moon? If the moon's rotation is due to tidal forces from the Earth, which are caused by the gravitational pull, which is stopped. So I think the tidal forces would change, causing the rotation to change. But the options don't directly mention that.

Wait, the options are about the motion of the moon, not the Earth's. Let me read the question again. So, if the force of gravity between the Moon and Earth stops, what happens to the moon's motion?

So the moon would no longer be in orbit, so it would start moving towards the Earth. But because the Earth is also moving, the moon would start moving in a straight line, away from the Earth's previous orbit. So the moon's orbital period would change. But back to the rotation: the question is about the moon's rotation.

Wait, the moon's rotation is due to the tidal forces from the Earth's gravity. The Earth's gravity is what causes the tidal locking. If the Earth's gravity stops, the tidal forces would change. But in the scenario, the question is about the Moon's rotation. So if the moon's rotation is tied to the Earth's gravity, and that gravity stops, does the moon's rotation speed change, or stop? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the moon's rotation would stop because without the gravitational pull, there's no torque. So the moon would lose its rotation. Wait, but the moon's orbital motion is what causes its rotation. So if gravity stops, the moon would only stop its orbit, but would it stop rotating? Or would it just fall into the Earth without rotation.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option E says it would continue rotating, but stop revolving around Earth. Wait, but if the moon stops orbiting, it wouldn't be revolving around Earth anymore. So the first part of E is correct.

Wait, but no. The question is about the moon's motion. So if gravity stops, the moon will start moving tangentially. So it would start moving in a straight line. But the second part is about its revolution around the Earth. So the moon would no longer revolve around the Earth. So option E says it would continue rotating (so maybe it's still spinning), but stop revolving around Earth, which matches. So E would be correct. But wait, when the moon's gravity stops, it would stop orbiting the Earth, but would it also stop rotating? Or would it just fall off on its own, meaning it's no longer in orbit, so it's not revolving, but its orbital period changes.

Wait, the question is about the moon's motion. So if the moon's orbit stops, the moon would not revolve around Earth anymore. So it would no longer be in orbit. So the first part of option E says it continues rotating — that makes sense, because the moon's rotation is tied to the Earth's gravity. So if the Earth's gravity stops, the moon's rotation would slow down or stop — but the question is about the resulting motion. So perhaps the moon's rotation would slow down, but the question is not giving the options about rotation speed.

Wait, the options are about the nature of the motion, not about the speed. So option E says it continues rotating, but stops revolving. That makes sense because the moon would start moving away from Earth, so it's no longer orbiting. So the motion is different. So E would be correct.

Wait, but another thought: the Moon's orbital motion is a combination of the Earth's revolution and the Moon's rotation. But if the Moon's gravity stops, would that affect the Earth's orbital motion? Actually, the Moon's gravity does affect the Earth's orbit as well, but the question is about the moon's own motion, not the Earth's.

Wait, the moon's rotation is caused by tidal forces which depend on the Earth's gravitational pull. If the moon's gravity (Earth's) stops, then the tidal forces change. But that would mean the moon's rotation would change, but the options don't suggest that. So perhaps the question is more about the moon's orbital motion.

Wait, the question says: "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the options are A-F, and the answer choice must end with the correct letter. So E's second part is "revolve around the Earth as usual." So that's incorrect. So if gravity stops, the moon would not be in orbit, so it wouldn't revolve around the Earth anymore. So E is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it this way. If the Moon stops orbiting the Earth, it would fall into the Earth. But its rotation would stop because the force causing the rotation would be gone, right? So the moon would stop rotating. But the question is about the resulting motion, not about the rotation.

Wait, the question is about the moon's motion. So if the moon's orbit stops, it would not revolve around the Earth anymore. So the moon would simply fall into the Earth, and the Earth would start moving. But from the perspective of the moon's own motion, it's no longer in orbit. So what's its motion? It would start moving in a straight line, so its orbital motion would cease. But what about its rotation? The moon's rotation is tied to the Earth's gravity, so if the Earth's gravity stops, the moon's rotation would slow down or stop.

Wait, but the options don't mention that. Let me look at the options again. The options are about the moon's motion.

Option E: It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth. So the first part is correct if the rotation stops. But the second part is incorrect because the moon would no longer be revolving.

Wait, so the moon would start moving towards the Earth, but in the options, the second part is about revolving around Earth, which wouldn't happen. So the moon's motion would change from orbit to a straight line.

So the correct answer is when the moon stops orbiting, so it no longer revolves. So which option says that? Let's look.

Option E: It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth. So first part is correct if rotation stops. Second part is incorrect.

Option G says it would stop rotating on its axis, but it would revolve around the Earth as usual. Wait, no. Why? Because the moon's rotation is tied to the Earth's orbit. So if the moon's orbit stops, its rotation would stop.

Wait, but if the Earth's gravity stops, the tidal forces from the Earth's gravity would cause the Moon's rotation to slow down and eventually stop. So the moon would start spinning slower, but not stop. But the options don't include that.

Wait, the question is about the resulting motion of the moon. So in that case, if the moon's orbit stops, it's no longer orbiting. So its orbital motion would stop, which would affect its motion. But since the options are about the moon's motion, perhaps the correct choice is that it would start moving away, and its rotation would stop.

But the options don't have a choice that says it stops rotating. Let's look again.

Looking at the options:

Option E: It would continue rotating ... but stop revolving around the Earth. So the first part is correct if rotation stops. But the second part is not correct because the moon would no longer be revolving.

Option G says it would stop rotating, but revolve around as usual. That's incorrect because if the moon's orbit stops, it would not revolve.

Wait, so none of the options seem to match. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Another approach: if the Earth's gravity stops, the Moon would no longer be in orbit. So the Moon would start moving on its own. So what's its motion? It would move in a straight line (tangent to its orbit), so its orbital period would change. But the question is about the moon's motion, which is now moving away, so it would no longer be in orbit. So it would not revolve around the Earth anymore.

Wait, but from the perspective of the options, which one is correct? The question is about the resulting motion. So the correct answer would be that it stops rotating (so no longer spins) and doesn't revolve. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A. Continue rotating, start revolving. No, because if gravity stops, it won't orbit.

B. Continue rotating, start revolving Mars. Unlikely.

C. Stop rotating, stop revolving. That's not correct, because the moon's rotation is tied to orbital motion. If gravity stops, the moon's rotation would slow, but not stop. Unless the question is about the Earth's effect on the Moon.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the Moon would stop rotating and not revolve. But none of the options say that. So perhaps the question is about whether the moon's rotation would change or not, and whether it would continue to orbit.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the moon's orbital motion. If the force of gravity stops, the moon's orbit would end, so it wouldn't revolve around the Earth anymore.

So the moon would start moving in a straight line, so its orbital motion would change. But the question is about its motion, not its orbit. So from the perspective of the moon, it's no longer in orbit. But the question is about the moon's motion (like its path or movement), not its orbit.

Wait, another approach: the Moon's orbit is determined by the balance between gravitational pull and centripetal acceleration. If the gravitational pull stops, the centripetal acceleration would change, leading to a change in the moon's orbit.

But for the moon's rotation, the torque from the Earth's gravity would be the reason. The torque is the rate of change of angular momentum, which depends on the gravitational force and the distance from the Earth. If the gravitational force stops, the torque stops, so the moon would lose angular momentum. But the moon would start rotating slower. Or perhaps it would stop rotating.

Wait, but the problem is that the question is about the moon's motion, not its rotation. So the moon would start moving in a straight line, so it would no longer revolve around the Earth. So the moon would stop revolving around the Earth. But whether it stops rotating depends on other factors.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because the options don't seem to match. Let me think of the real-world scenario. If the Moon's gravity stops, the Moon would start falling toward Earth, but the Earth would start moving away. The Moon's orbit would change, but its rotation isn't directly tied to its orbit anymore. Wait, no, the rotation is caused by the tidal forces from the Earth's gravity. So if the Earth's gravity stops, the tidal forces would change, causing the Moon's rotation to change as well. But from the answer options, this isn't one of the choices.

Wait, given that the options don't seem to have the correct answer, perhaps I should reevaluate. Another way: if the Moon's orbit stops, it would no longer revolve. So the correct answer would be that the moon continues to rotate but doesn't revolve. But from the options, the only option that says it stops revolving is option E, but its first part is correct. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the "resulting motion" of the moon. So the moon is no longer in orbit, so it's motion is not revolving. So the correct answer would be that it continues rotating but stops revolving. But looking at the options again, perhaps it's option E. Because the moon's orbit stops, so it can't revolve. So the first part of E is correct, the second part is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about the moon's motion, not about the Earth. So perhaps the correct answer is option E, because the moon would stop rotating (so it's option E's first part) and it would stop revolving around the Earth.

Wait, but that can't be right because the moon wouldn't be revolving if its orbit stops. So the second part of E is incorrect. Hmm. Maybe the correct option is E, because the moon stops revolving, but its rotation continues. No, that's not correct either. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the question is about the moon's motion. If the Earth's gravity stops, the moon will start moving tangentially. So the moon's orbital motion would stop, which would mean it no longer revolves. So the correct answer would be that the moon stops revolving, but its rotation continues. But looking at the options, option E says the moon continues rotating but stops revolving. That's the opposite of what I thought.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct option. Let me think about the physics.

When the Moon's gravity stops, it would start moving in a straight line, so it would no longer orbit the Earth. Thus, its orbital motion would stop, meaning it wouldn't revolve around the Earth. But the question is about the moon's motion. So the moon's motion would change: it would leave the Earth's orbit and fall towards it. But in terms of its rotation, if the Moon's rotation is tied to the Earth's orbit, then the moon would stop rotating.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotation of the moon is not directly tied to the orbit. That is, the Moon's rotation is caused by the tidal forces, which depend on the gravitational pull from the Earth. If the Earth's gravity stops, the tidal forces would change, but the moon's rotation would slow down. So in this case, the moon would stop rotating. But none of the options mention that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the moon continues rotating but stops revolving. But I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of it this way: the Moon's orbital motion is determined by the Earth's gravity. If the Earth's gravity stops, the Moon's orbit would stop. So the Moon would no longer revolve around the Earth. So the correct answer would be that the moon continues to rotate but stops revolving. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is E because the moon would stop revolving around the Earth, but the rotation would continue. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because when the Earth's gravity stops, the Moon would start moving away from the Earth, so its orbit would stop, which means it no longer revolves. So the first part of E is correct, but the second part is incorrect. So that can't be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the Moon would stop rotating on its axis, but it would revolve around the Earth as usual. Which would be option G. But that's incorrect because the Moon's rotation is tied to its orbit, so if the orbit stops, its rotation would stop too.

Wait, another idea. The Earth's gravity causes the Moon to rotate. If that gravity stops, the Moon's rotation would also stop. So the correct answer would be that the moon continues rotating, but it stops revolving. But the only option that says that is E, but E's second part is incorrect. So perhaps there's no correct option, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the moon continues to rotate but stops revolving. But that's not any of the options. So maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the possible answers.

Option E: continues rotating, stops revolving. So first part is correct, but second is wrong.

Option G: stops rotating, revolve as usual. So second part is correct.

But why would the Moon stop rotating? If the Earth's gravity stops, the tidal forces from the Earth's gravity would cause the Moon's rotation to slow. So the Moon would stop rotating.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because the Moon would stop revolving around the Earth, but its rotation would continue. But I'm not confident.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake. The correct answer is E because the moon would stop revolving, but its rotation would continue. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the moon's rotation would stop. But the options don't say that.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the moon's orbit is determined by the balance between the gravitational pull and the centripetal acceleration. If the gravitational pull (Earth's gravity) stops, the moon would start moving in a straight line, so it wouldn't orbit. So the moon would stop revolving, but its rotation would depend on other factors. However, the question is about the moon's motion. So perhaps the correct answer is that the moon would continue rotating, but stop revolving.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. Maybe I should pick option G, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to refer to the correct answer. The correct answer is that the moon would stop rotating on its axis, but it would revolve around the Earth as usual. Wait, no, that would mean it's orbiting, but the rotation is tied to the orbit. So the correct answer would be that the moon would stop rotating, but its rotation is tied to its orbit. So the correct answer is that the moon would stop rotating on its axis. But the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the correct answer: the correct option is E, because the moon would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the Moon stops rotating, but because the Earth's gravity stops, the Moon would continue to orbit. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because the moon would stop revolving, but its rotation would continue. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the moon stops rotating, but it continues to revolve.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the correct answer. Let me think again. If the Earth's gravity stops, the Moon would start moving in a straight line, so it would no longer orbit. So the first part of the correct answer would be that the moon continues rotating, but the second part would be that it stops revolving. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the moon continues rotating on its axis, as the Earth's gravity doesn't affect the moon's rotation. So E is the correct option.

Wait, but the moon's rotation is tied to the Earth's orbit, so if the Earth's gravity stops, the moon's rotation would slow, but the question is about the motion of the moon, not whether it stops rotating. Hmm.

I think I'm stuck, so I'll have to make a choice. The correct answer is E: It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth. So option E is correct.
</think>

The correct answer is option E: It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth. 

**Explanation:**
If the gravitational force between the Moon and Earth stops, the Moon would no longer be in orbit around the Earth. This would cause it to start moving in a straight line, effectively stopping its orbit. However, the Moon's rotation is primarily influenced by the gravitational pull from the Earth, which is still present. Without the Earth's gravity, the Moon's rotation would slow, but the question is about the Moon's resulting motion, not whether it stops rotating. Thus, the Moon's motion would cease its orbital movement, meaning it would no longer revolve around the Earth. Therefore, option E correctly describes the Moon's resulting motion.
