Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a voting law being reviewed by a court. The question asks what must be true if the law is upheld. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to understand the context. The question is about the implications of a law being upheld after a court review. The options involve various aspects of the law's relevance to government purposes, whether it's legitimate or not, and how it relates to government priorities.

I remember that in legal terms, a "legitimate" government purpose is one that's essential for the functioning of government, like maintaining order, public safety, or providing services. A "substantially related" purpose is a bit more general, encompassing a wider range of important functions.

Now, the options given are A through H, with E and J being the last two. The question is about what must be true if the law is upheld. So, the law must meet certain criteria to be upheld. Let me look at each option.

Option A: The law is necessary for a legitimate government purpose. That makes sense because if the law is needed for a legitimate purpose, it can't be upheld without the government recognizing it's essential. So this seems plausible.

Option B: The law is rationally related to an important government purpose. Rationality might be a factor, but I'm not sure if this is a necessary condition. The question is about what must be true for the law to be upheld.

Option C: The law is unnecessarily related to a compelling government purpose. If it's unnecessary, then it can't be upheld. So this seems contradictory. If the law is unnecessary, it wouldn't be up for review. So this option is saying the law is unnecessarily related, meaning it's not needed, so it can't be upheld. That suggests it's not a necessary condition, but something else.

Option D: The law is substantially related to an important government purpose. Substantially related means it's more important than just a minor purpose. So if it's substantial, it's important enough for the government to consider. This sounds like a necessary condition.

Option E: The law is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. Compelling is a strong word, so this seems like a strong condition. If the law is necessary for a compelling purpose, it's likely to be upheld. Compelling suggests it's a very important or significant purpose.

Option F: The law is moderately related to a compelling government purpose. This is a weak condition. If it's only moderately related, it might not be enough to be upheld.

Option G: The law is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. Rationality might be a factor, but the question is about what must be true for the law to be upheld, regardless of justification.

Option H: The law is vaguely related to a significant government purpose. Vague might mean it's not even relevant, so it's definitely not a condition.

Option I: The law is substantially unrelated to any government purpose. If it's unrelated, it can't be upheld. So this is the opposite of necessary.

Option J: The law is substantially related to a legitimate government purpose. Legitimate is a positive term meaning essential, so this seems correct.

So, thinking about the logic: a law that's necessary for a legitimate purpose can't be upheld without the government recognizing it's necessary. Therefore, if the law is upheld, it must be necessary for a legitimate purpose. That points towards option J.

Alternatively, option E says it's necessary for a compelling purpose. Compelling is stronger than legitimate, so if a law is necessary for a compelling purpose, it's a more stringent condition. But the question just says "regarded as a legitimate government purpose." So, if the law is needed for a legitimate purpose, which is a broader category than compelling, then option J is a necessary condition.

Wait, but option E is more about compelling, which is a specific type of legitimate purpose, perhaps. So if a law is necessary for a compelling purpose, it's also necessary for a legitimate one, but not necessarily the other way around.

The question is, what must be true if the law is upheld. So the law must meet a condition that makes it necessary for a legitimate purpose. Option J is that it's substantial and related to a legitimate purpose.

Wait, but option E is about compelling purposes. So, the law must be necessary for at least a compelling purpose. Because if it's necessary for a compelling one, it's also necessary for legitimate (since compelling is a type of legitimate). But whether the law is "substantially related" to a legitimate purpose is what's being asked.

Wait, the law must be necessary for a legitimate purpose. So option J is that it's substantially related to a legitimate purpose. That makes sense.

Alternatively, option E says it's necessary to achieve a compelling purpose. Compelling is a more intense requirement. But the question is about what must be true if the law is upheld. So, if the law is upheld, it must satisfy the conditions for it to be necessary for a legitimate purpose.

Thus, the correct answer should be option J: The law is substantially related to a legitimate government purpose.
</think>

The law must be upheld if it is necessary for a legitimate government purpose. A legitimate purpose is essential for the functioning of government, such as maintaining order, providing services, or ensuring public safety. Therefore, the law must meet the condition of being substantial and related to such a purpose.

Answer: J
