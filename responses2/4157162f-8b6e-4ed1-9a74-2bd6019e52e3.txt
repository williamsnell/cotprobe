Okay, so I need to solve this map scale question. Let me see. The question says the map uses a scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles. They're asking how many miles are represented by 5 inches on the map. Hmm, right, so it's a straightforward conversion, but I should make sure I do this step by step.

First, I remember that map scales show the ratio of distance on the map to actual distance. So, here, 1 inch on the map equals 25 miles in real life. So, for each inch, it's 25 miles. Now, I need to find out what 5 inches would be.

I think it's a simple multiplication problem. If 1 inch is 25 miles, then 5 inches would be 5 times 25 miles. Let me calculate that: 5 multiplied by 25. 5 times 20 is 100, and 5 times 5 is 25. So adding those together, 100 plus 25 equals 125. So 5 inches should represent 125 miles.

Looking at the options, option H is 125. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check the options: A is 50, which is 5 times 10, B is 150 (5*30), C is 100 (5*20), D is 25 (5*5), E is 5, F is 200 (5*40), G is 75 (5*15), H is 125, I is 175 (5*35), J is 250 (5*50). So yes, H is the right choice.
