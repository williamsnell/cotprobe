Question:

A buyer contracted in writing to purchase 1,000 gidgets (which are similar to widgets but are more popular because of their greater durability and- resiliency) from a manufacturer for a total contract price of $4,000. After this agreement was executed and before delivery, the buyer and the manufacturer agreed in a telephone conversation to change the quantity term from 1,000 to 800 gidgets. This modification is probably unenforceable, because

Options:

A: it violates the statute of frauds.
B: there was no consideration.
C: the original contract was in writing.
D: the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about contracts and whether a modification to a contract is enforceable. Let me think through it step by step.

The scenario is that a buyer contracted to purchase 1,000 gidgets for $4,000. Then before delivery, they and the manufacturer agreed to change the quantity to 800 gidgets. The question is why this modification isn't enforceable. The options are A through J, but I remember the options include A to J, but the choices given are A, B, C, D, etc.

Hmm, the options are: A is about statute of frauds, B about consideration, C about original contract being in writing, D about the parol evidence rule. I need to figure out which of these is the correct reason why the modification is unenforceable.

First, what's a contract? A contract is a binding agreement made for the purchase, exchange, sale, or delivery of goods or services. Statute of frauds is a rule that outlines what a valid contract must contain. If a contract doesn't meet these requirements, it's invalid.

So, the original contract was in writing, right? Because the buyer contracted "in writing" to purchase 1,000 gidgets. So the original contract was in writing. Now, the modification is changing the quantity from 1,000 to 800. If the original contract was in writing, does that make the modification enforceable?

Wait, but what if the modification is a contract itself. Let me think. The buyer's contract is for 1,000, and the manufacturer agreed to 800. But the original contract was in writing. The modification is a change in quantity, which is a part of the contract. So, does the statute of frauds apply here?

The statute of frauds requires that the contract contain certain elements. One is consideration, which is payment or service provided. Wait, but in this case, the original contract is for $4,000. If the modification is merely changing the quantity, is there still consideration? Because the original contract is for 1,000, but the modification is for 800. 

Wait, let me clarify. The modification is a new contract? Or is it part of an existing one? Because if the original was in writing, and the modification is to change the quantity, but the same terms except for quantity, then perhaps the original contract's consideration (the $4k) still applies.

Wait, but the buyer is now purchasing fewer gidgets. So, the original contract's consideration might not apply because the quantity is now fewer. The consideration for the original contract was for 1,000 gidgets. The new contract's consideration is for 800. So, the modification doesn't provide new consideration for the new quantity. That might be a problem.

Wait, but what about the consideration for the original contract? The original required payment for 1,000 gidgets. So, the modification doesn't change the consideration. So, the original contract would lack consideration for the new quantity. 

So, the modification isn't in the original contract. The original was for 1,000. The new modification is a new contract, but the original didn't require consideration for a different quantity. So, the modification would be unenforceable because it's not in the original contract.

Wait, but the original contract was in writing. Does that mean the modification could be enforced even if it's a new term? Because the original was in writing, which is a pre-existing contract. So, if the modification is a part of the original contract, it's enforceable.

Wait, but the modification is for 800. The original was for 1,000. So, the modification is a new term, but for a different quantity. So, the original agreement didn't specify a quantity, but the contract would have required payment for 1,000. So, the original doesn't provide consideration for a lower quantity. Therefore, the modification isn't enforceable because it's not in the original contract. So, the original contract was in writing, so the modification is enforceable.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The statute of frauds requires that the contract contain consideration. But in this case, the original contract required payment for 1,000 gidgets. The modification is for 800. So, the original contract doesn't specify a different quantity. Thus, the original contract doesn't include consideration for a different quantity, so the modification isn't enforceable.

So, the reason is that the original contract doesn't provide consideration for a different quantity, making the modification unenforceable (because it's not in the original contract). So, the original contract was in writing, so the modification is enforceable? Wait, no. Because if the original contract wasn't in writing, the modification might not be enforceable. But in this case, the original was in writing.

Wait, wait. The statute of frauds doesn't require the contract to contain consideration. It's about whether the contract is enforceable. So, if the original contract doesn't require consideration for a different quantity, then the modification is not in the contract, making it unenforceable.

So, the original contract was in writing, so the modification is not in the contract, hence not enforceable. So the reason is that the original contract was in writing (Option C), making the modification unenforceable because it's not in the contract.

Alternatively, another point is the parol evidence rule. Option D says that the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms. Parol evidence is when a document from a previous party is used to interpret a current contract. But in this case, the modification is in the contract, not in a previous contract.

So, the parol evidence rule doesn't apply here. So, the options are between A, B, and C.

Wait, the original contract was in writing (C), making the modification unenforceable because it's not in the contract. So, the answer would be C.

Alternatively, if the original contract didn't require consideration, then the modification isn't in the contract, so it's unenforceable. So, the correct answer would be C: the original contract was in writing.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether the original contract required consideration. The original contract was for 1,000 gidgets, but the consideration was payment for that. The modification is to 800, but the original didn't specify a different quantity. So, the original contract didn't require consideration for a lower quantity. Hence, the modification isn't in the contract, making it unenforceable.

So, the reason is that the original contract didn't contain consideration for the quantity change, making the modification unenforceable because it's not in the contract. So, the original contract was in writing (C).
</think>

The modification of the quantity term in the contract is unenforceable because the original contract was in writing (Option C). 

**Explanation:** 
- The statute of frauds requires the contract to contain consideration, but the original contract did not specify a different quantity, thus lacking consideration for the modification. 
- The modification is not part of the original contract, making it unenforceable. The original contract was in writing, but the modification itself is not included in it, so the modification is unenforceable.
