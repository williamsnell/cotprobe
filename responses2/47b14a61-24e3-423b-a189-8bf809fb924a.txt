Okay, so I have this question here about calculating Delta m, the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei, in grams per mole for gamma emission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives a specific reaction: the excited state of ^19_8O (which is oxygen-19) emits a gamma ray. The reaction is excited state (excited) → ground state + gamma. The energy of the gamma is given as 1.06 × 10^8 kcal/mole. I need to find Delta m in grams per mole.

Wait, Delta m is the mass difference between the initial and final nuclei? Or is it the mass difference in the reaction? Oh, right, in nuclear physics, the mass difference (Delta m) is a key quantity used in the calculation of the energy released. The formula is Delta m = (mass of initial) - (mass of final). But wait, no, wait. The mass difference is (mass of parent) - (mass of daughter + gamma), but since the gamma is massless, maybe the Delta m is (mass of initial) minus (mass of final). Because the initial is the excited state, and the final is the ground state.

Wait, but the reaction is: excited state → ground state + gamma. So the initial mass is the excited state, and the final is the ground state plus the photon (which has negligible mass). So the mass difference is (mass of excited state) minus (mass of ground state + mass of photon). But since the photon is massless, the Delta m is (mass of excited) minus (mass of ground). So, the mass of the parent (excited) minus the mass of the daughter (ground state).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The reaction is: (excited) → (ground) + gamma. So the mass of the excited state is the mass of the daughter plus the gamma plus any other products. But since the gamma is massless, the mass of the excited state (initial) is equal to the mass of the ground state (final) plus the mass of the gamma (which is zero). So the mass difference would be (mass of excited) - (mass of ground state) = (mass of daughter) + (gamma's mass) - (mass of daughter) = gamma's mass. Wait, but that can't be right because the gamma is a boson and doesn't have mass. Oh, wait, no: the excited state mass is equal to the ground state mass plus the photon's energy. Because E = mc^2, so the mass difference is (E / c²).

So, the mass difference (Delta m) is the energy released divided by c². Alternatively, since the energy is given in kcal per mole, I'll need to convert that into joules and then grams.

Wait, the energy is 1.06 × 10^8 kcal per mole. So each mole of gamma emission releases this amount of energy. But how does that relate to mass difference? Oh, because energy and mass are related via E=mc², so when a gamma is emitted, the mass difference is E/(c²). But since the reaction produces a gamma, the mass of the initial (excited) is the mass of the final (ground) plus the mass of the gamma (which is negligible). So, the mass difference (Delta m) is E/(c²), but in grams per mole.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei. So, initial is the excited state, final is the ground state. So, the mass of the excited state is the mass of the ground state plus the mass of the gamma. So, the mass difference (Delta m) is (mass of excited) - (mass of ground + gamma mass). Gamma mass is negligible, so Delta m = (mass of excited) - (mass of ground).

But the energy E is the difference in mass times c squared. So E = (Delta m) * c².

So, Delta m = E/(c²). But wait, E is given in kcal per mole. So I need to convert that into joules, and then compute Delta m in kg per mole, and then convert to grams per mole.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Convert the energy from kcal/mol to joules/mole.
2. Divide by c squared (the speed of light squared) to get Delta m in kg/mol.
3. Convert kg/mol to grams per mole by multiplying by 1000.

But wait, because the question is about the gamma emission, the mass difference is the amount that the excited state decays into the ground state, so it's the mass of the excited minus the mass of the ground. The energy released is E, so E = (Delta m) * c².

Wait, but the energy released in the reaction would be the energy that the excited state has, which is equal to the mass of the gamma (which is zero) plus any kinetic energy. But in this case, since it's a gamma emission, the energy of the gamma is equal to the difference in mass times c squared. So E = (m_initial - m_final) * c².

So, m_initial is the mass of the excited state, m_final is the mass of the ground state.

So, m_initial - m_final = E / c².

Thus, Delta m is E / c².

So, first, I need to compute E in joules per mole.

E is given as 1.06 × 10^8 kcal/mol.

One kcal is equal to 4184 joules. So,

E = 1.06e8 kcal/mol * 4184 J/kcal = let's calculate that.

1.06e8 * 4.184e3 = Let me compute that.

1.06e8 * 4.184e3 = (1.06 * 4.184) * 1e8 * 1e3 = ?

1.06 * 4.184 ≈ let's compute 1 *4.184 =4.184, 0.06 *4.184≈0.251. So total ≈4.435.

So 4.435e11 J/mol.

So E is 4.435e11 J per mole.

Now, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. So c squared is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

Now, Delta m is E/(c²) = (4.435e11 J/mol) / (9e16 m²/s²) )

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so J/(m²/s²) = kg.

So, kg per mole.

So, kg/mol = (4.435e11) / (9e16) = (4.435 / 9 ) * 1e-5.

Wait, 4.435e11 divided by 9e16 is (4.435)/(9) * 1e-5.

4.435 /9 is approximately 0.4928.

So 0.4928e-5 kg/mol = 4.928e-6 kg/mol.

Convert kg to grams: 4.928e-6 kg * 1000g/kg = 4.928e-3 g/mol.

But wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, 1.06e8 kcal/mol. 1 kcal = 4184 J.

So E = 1.06e8 * 4.184e3 = 1.06 * 4.184 = approx 4.435, so 4.435e11 J/mol.

c² = (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So, E/c² = 4.435e11 /9e16 = (4.435/9) * 1e-5.

4.435 /9 is approximately 0.4928. So 0.4928e-5 kg/mol = 4.928e-6 kg/mol.

To grams: 4.928e-6 kg * 1000 g/kg = 4.928e-3 g/mol.

So Delta m is 4.928e-3 grams per mole.

Looking at the options, option G is -4.92 × 10^-3 g/mole, which is about 4.92e-3. But wait, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, the question says, "the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei in grams per mole." So, final is the ground state, initial is the excited state.

So, the initial mass (excited) is higher than the final (ground) because the excited state decays into the ground state plus a gamma. So, the mass of the initial is larger by Delta m. So the difference (initial - final) is positive. But the question is asking for the difference between the final and initial, which would be negative, because final is lower than initial.

Wait, the wording is: "the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei." So, it's (mass of initial) minus (mass of final) = Delta m. But the reaction is initial (excited) → final (ground) + gamma. So the mass of initial is equal to the mass of final plus the gamma. So, initial's mass is final's mass plus the gamma's mass (which is zero). So, initial's mass is final's mass plus negligible. So, the difference (initial - final) is about zero plus the gamma's mass? Wait, no, because the gamma's mass is zero. So, initial's mass is (final's mass) + (gamma's mass + any other products?), but in this case, the only product after the gamma is the ground state. So, initial is equal to ground + gamma.

So, mass of initial = mass of ground state + gamma's mass (which is zero). So, mass difference between initial and final is mass of initial - mass of final = gamma's mass, which is zero. But that's not right, because the gamma is emitted, so the mass of the initial must be higher than the final. Ah, no, wait. Because the initial is the excited state, which is a nucleus in higher energy state. It decays into the ground state and emits a gamma.

So, the mass of the initial (excited state) is equal to the mass of the ground state plus the mass of the gamma. But the gamma is a photon, so it has zero mass. So, the mass of the initial is equal to the mass of the ground state.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The excited state is higher in mass than the ground state because the nucleus is in a higher energy level. So, the initial (excited) has a higher mass than the final (ground state) because when it emits the gamma (which is massless), the mass difference comes from the kinetic energy of the products. But in this case, the gamma is a boson, so kinetic energy is zero. So, the mass of the excited state is equal to the mass of the ground state plus the mass of any emitted particles. But in the reaction, the ground state is formed, so the initial's mass is equal to the final's mass. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, the reaction is the excited state (initial) → ground state (final) + gamma. So, the mass of the initial is equal to the mass of the final plus the gamma's mass. But the gamma is a photon, which is massless. So, the initial's mass is equal to the final's mass. But that doesn't make sense because the excited state is higher in energy, so it should have a higher mass.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts. Let me think about it differently.

In nuclear physics, the mass defect is the difference between the total mass of the individual nucleons and the actual mass of the nucleus. But that's when considering binding energy. I'm not sure that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, the mass difference (Delta m) for a nuclear reaction is given by the energy released divided by c squared. So, the energy released is E = (Delta m) c².

In this problem, the gamma emission releases energy E. So, E = Delta m * c², so Delta m = E / c².

So, E is given as 1.06e8 kcal/mol. So, converting to J:

1.06e8 kcal/mol * (4184 J/kcal) = 1.06e8 * 4.184e3 J/mol = let's compute that.

1.06e8 is 106,000,000.

Multiply by 4.184e3 (which is 4,184,000).

106,000,000 * 4,184,000 = ?

Wait, 106 million times 4.184 million. Let me compute 106 * 4.184 = ?

106 * 4 = 424, 106 * 0.184 = 19.504, so total is 424 + 19.504 = 443.504.

So, 443.504e12 J/mol.

Wait, 106e6 * 4.184e6 = (106 * 4.184) * 1e6 *1e6 = 443.504 * 1e12 = 4.43504e14 J/mol.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Oh, no, sorry, I think I made a mistake in exponents.

Because 1.06e8 * 4.184e3 = (1.06 * 4.184) × 1e8+3 = 4.435 * 1e11 J/mol.

Ah, yes, because 1e8 * 1e3 = 1e11. So E=4.435e11 J/mol.

Now, c squared is (3e8 m/s)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So, Delta m = 4.435e11 / 9e16 = (4.435 /9) * 1e-5.

4.435 /9 is approximately 0.4928.

So, 0.4928e-5 kg/mol = 4.928e-6 kg/mol.

Convert to grams: 4.928e-6 kg * 1000 g/kg = 4.928e-3 g/mol.

Now, the question is about the difference between the final and initial nuclei. So, which is smaller? The final is the ground state, the initial is the excited state. So, initial is higher in mass than final. So, initial minus final is positive, but the question is the difference between the final and initial, which is negative.

Wait, but wait. The question says "the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei in grams per mole." So, mass of final - mass of initial = negative Delta m.

So, it's -4.928e-3 g/mol.

Looking at the options: option G is -4.92 ×10^-3 g/mole.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss a negative sign. Because when the initial is higher, the difference final - initial is negative.

So the answer should be option G.
</think>

To calculate the difference in mass (Δm) between the final and initial nuclei in grams per mole for the given γ emission reaction, we proceed as follows:

1. **Energy released in the reaction**: The energy released is given as 1.06 × 10⁸ kcal/mol. Converting this to joules:  
   \[
   E = 1.06 \times 10^8 \, \text{kcal/mol} \times 4184 \, \text{J/kcal} = 4.435 \times 10^{11} \, \text{J/mol}.
   \]

2. **Speed of light squared**: The speed of light, \(c\), is approximately \(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), so:  
   \[
   c^2 = (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
   \]

3. **Mass difference (Δm)**: Using the relationship \(E = \Delta m \cdot c^2\), we solve for Δm:  
   \[
   \Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{4.435 \times 10^{11}}{9 \times 10^{16}} = 4.928 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{kg/mol}.
   \]

4. **Conversion to grams per mole**: Since \(1 \, \text{kg} = 1000 \, \text{g}\),  
   \[
   \Delta m = 4.928 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{kg/mol} \times 1000 \, \text{g/kg} = 4.928 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

5. **Sign of Δm**: The problem asks for the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei. Since the initial (excited state) is higher in mass than the final (ground state), the difference is negative:  
   \[
   \Delta m = -4.928 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

6. **Matching the options**: Among the given options, the correct value is:  
   \[
   \text{Option G: } -4.92 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]
