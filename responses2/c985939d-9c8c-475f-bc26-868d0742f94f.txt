Okay, I'm trying to figure out who kills Tony at the end of 'West Side Story.' So, I remember the movie is about a group of soldiers who get captured and have to fight each other. The main characters are Tony, a young boy, and some soldiers named Chino, Riff, Officer Krupke, and others. 

I think the ending happens when the soldiers kill each other. I've heard that in the movie, they end up killing themselves. So, each soldier kills one of the others. That means Tony, who's a young boy, would be the one who kills himself. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The soldiers are called the "Twinning Team" and they each kill another member. So if they're all soldiers, they'd all kill each other. So Tony is a soldier, so he would kill himself. 

Looking at the options, option A says Tony kills himself. That makes sense. The other options either mention different people or imply someone else. So the correct answer should be A.
