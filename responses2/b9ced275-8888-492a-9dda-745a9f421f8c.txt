Alright, so I need to figure out what disposable income is. I remember in economics class, the teacher talked about income and how it's broken down into different parts. Let me think about this.

Disposable income is the amount of money someone has left after all necessary expenses, right? So it's not all of the income you earn because you have to account for things like taxes, rent, utilities, and other expenses.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Total income before taxes. Hmm, that's the pre-tax income. But disposable income isn't that; it's after taxes.

Option B: Total income after business expenses. That sounds more like net income, not disposable. Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Amount after taxes. Again, that's after taxes, not what we're looking for. Disposable income is the total after taxes.

Option D: Mandatory health insurance payments. Those are probably fixed expenses, not part of disposable income.

Option E: Exclusively for investment purposes. That's about savings, not the main category.

Option F: Luxury goods. That's more about spending habits rather than the actual income.

Option G: Government revenue. No, that's about the government's income, not personal disposable.

Option H: Savings only. That's part of savings, not the main category.

Option I: Remaining after paying for basic necessities. That sounds right. It's after paying for things like food and shelter, which are basic.

Option J: Left over after utilities. That would be a specific part, but not the general category.

So putting it together, disposable income is what's left after all necessary expenses, including basic necessities. So I think the answer is I: The income remaining after paying for basic necessities like food and shelter.
