Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about what happens to someone's weight when they stand on a shrinking planet. The planet's diameter shrinks to one-tenth its original, but the mass stays the same. Hmm.

I remember that weight depends on gravity, right? Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity. The formula for gravitational force is F = G*(m1*m2)/r². But since the planet is shrinking, the radius (r) decreases. Oh wait, but the problem says the mass doesn't change. So it's not about the mass being less, but about the radius.

Wait, the radius is the distance from the center to the surface. If the diameter is shrinking to one-tenth, then the radius is also shrinking to one-tenth. Because diameter is twice the radius. So the planet's radius becomes r/10.

So the original weight (before shrinking) would be F1 = G*(M*m)/(R²). After shrinking, the weight becomes F2 = G*(M*m)/( (R/10)^2 ) = G*M*m/(R²/100) ) which is 100 * G*M*m/(R²). So F2 is 100 times F1. That would mean the person weighs 100 times as much, right?

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Because I'm standing on the surface. So the gravitational force depends on the mass of the planet and the radius. When the radius is smaller, the gravitational force should be stronger, because you're closer to the center of mass. So if the radius is smaller, the gravitational acceleration g is higher.

For a planet, the surface gravity g is given by g = G*M/(R²). If the radius R decreases by a factor of 10, then R becomes R/10. So g becomes G*M/( (R/10)^2 ) = G*M*100/R² = 100*g. So the surface gravity is 100 times higher.

So the person's weight, which is m*g, would be m*(100g) = 100 times their original weight. So the correct answer should be J: 1/10 as much? Wait, no. Wait, wait, no! Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, if the radius is smaller, the surface gravity is higher. So if someone is standing on a planet that's getting smaller, they weigh more.

Wait, let's think numerically. Suppose the original planet has a radius R. The new radius is R/10. The mass M is same.

The gravitational force at the surface is F = G*M*m / (R/10)^2 = G*M*m *100 / R² = 100 * (G*M*m/R²) = 100 F_original.

So the person's weight increases by a factor of 100. So J says 1/10. That would mean if they are standing on a larger planet, their weight increases. But in this case, the planet is shrinking, so R is smaller. So their weight increases.

But wait, the question is phrased as: "If it shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter with no change in mass on the shrunken surface you'd weigh..." So the person is on a smaller planet, so their weight is higher.

So which option is that? Let's look at the options:

A: Half as much → not right. Because 1/100 would be if both dimensions decrease by factor of 1/10 (radius and diameter), but in this case, only radius decreases. So weight would be 100 times higher, not 10.

Wait, the options are:

A: 1/10 as much → that's if radius is 1/10, but the gravitational force would be 100 times higher, so A is incorrect.

Wait, let me recheck the options. The options are:

A: Half as much → 1/2

B: 1/100 → 0.01

C: twice → ×2

D: same → same as before

E: 1000000 → 1e6

F: 1000 → 1e3

G: 10,000 → 1e4

H: 10 → ×10

I: 100 → ×100

J: 1/10 → 0.1

Wait, in this case, the weight increases by a factor of 100. So which option is that? The options are about the factor. So the correct answer is J: 1/10 as much → no, that's wrong. Wait, no. Wait, the options don't list it. Wait no, the options have J: 1/10. So which is it? Because the weight is 100 times higher. So the correct choice is about how much higher, not lower.

Wait, the options are all in terms of how your weight compares to before. So the correct answer is J: 1/10 as much? No, that can't be. Wait, no, because 1/10 is less than 1; that would mean their weight is lower, which is the opposite of what's happening.

Wait, I think I have the confusion. Let me clarify: the question is, when the planet shrinks, does the person's weight increase or decrease?

The planet's diameter is shrinking, so radius R becomes R/10. Hence, the planet is smaller. The surface gravity, which is F = G*M/m /R², would be higher since R is smaller. So the person's weight (which is m * g, where g is surface gravity) would be m*(G*M/(R²/100)) = 100 m * (G*M/R²) = 100 times the original weight.

So the weight is 100 times higher. Hence, J is 1/10 as much → no, because that would be the weight if the planet were larger. So the correct answer should be J's opposite. Wait, J is 1/10 as much, which would mean their weight is 1/10 of what it was before, which is not the case. That would be the case if the radius increased to one-tenth, but in this case, the radius is smaller. So the planet is smaller, so the person's weight is bigger.

Wait, the options are in terms of how their weight compares. So in the original scenario, their weight is W. After shrinking, their weight is (100) W. So the correct factor is 100 times.

Now, looking at the options, which one says this? The options don't have 100 as a choice. Let me check the options again. Oh, no, the options include H: 10, I: 100, J: 1/10.

Wait, the options are:

A: Half as much → 0.5

B: 1/100 → 0.01

C: twice → 2

D: same → 1

E: 1,000,000 → 1e6

F: 1,000 → 1e3

G: 10,000 → 1e4

H: 10 → 10

I: 100 → 100

J: 1/10 → 0.1

So, the correct factor is 100. So the correct answer must be I: 100 times as much.

Wait, but another way: I'm standing on a planet that's 1/10th the original radius. So the surface gravity is higher. So the weight would be 100 times higher.

So the correct answer is I: 100 times as much.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. Suppose the planet's mass remains same. So, the gravitational force is F = G*M*m/R². As R decreases, F increases. So when R is 1/10 of original, F becomes 100 times original F.

So your weight is 100 times as much. So the correct answer is I.

The question asks what happens to the weight of a person standing on a shrinking planet with a diameter that reduces to one-tenth of its original size, assuming the mass remains constant. 

Weight depends on the gravitational force, which is given by the formula:

\[
F = \frac{G M m}{R^2}
\]

where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) is the planet's mass, \(m\) is the person's mass, and \(R\) is the planet's radius. Since the mass \(M\) remains unchanged and the radius \(R\) shrinks to one-tenth of its original value, the gravitational force increases. 

The gravitational force on the surface of the planet is proportional to \(1/R^2\). If \(R\) becomes \(R/10\), then \(R^2\) becomes \((R/10)^2 = R^2/100\). Substituting this into the formula, the gravitational force becomes:

\[
F_{\text{new}} = \frac{G M m}{R^2/100} = 100 \cdot \frac{G M m}{R^2} = 100 F_{\text{original}}
\]

Thus, the person's weight increases by a factor of 100. 

Now, reviewing the options:

- **A: Half as much** — Incorrect, as the weight increases, not decreases.
- **B: 1/100 as much** — Incorrect, as this would imply the planet's radius is 100 times larger, which is not the case.
- **C: Twice as much** — Incorrect, as the weight increases, not decreases.
- **D: The same as before** — Incorrect, as the weight changes due to the smaller radius.
- **E: 1,000,000 times as much** — Incorrect, as this is a much larger factor than expected.
- **F: 1,000 times as much** — Incorrect, as this is still smaller than the expected factor of 100.
- **G: 10,000 times as much** — Incorrect, as this is still smaller than the expected factor of 100.
- **H: 10 times as much** — Incorrect, as the weight increases, not decreases.
- **I: 100 times as much** — Correct, as shown by the calculation.
- **J: 1/10 as much** — Incorrect, as this would imply the radius increases to one-tenth, which is not the case.

The correct answer is **I: 100 times as much**.
