Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the largest integer for which (x + 11)/(x + 7) is an integer. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. I need to find an integer x such that when you plug it into (x + 11)/(x + 7), the result is an integer. And among the options provided, I have to choose the largest possible x.

Hmm, okay. So, let's denote y = (x + 11)/(x + 7), and we want y to be an integer. Let me rewrite the expression to see if I can simplify it or find a relationship.

Let me consider (x + 11)/(x + 7). Maybe I can perform polynomial division or manipulate the numerator in terms of the denominator. Let me see:

(x + 11) = (x + 7) + 4. Because (x + 7) + 4 equals x + 11. So, substituting that into the expression, we get:

(x + 11)/(x + 7) = [ (x + 7) + 4 ]/(x + 7) = 1 + 4/(x + 7).

So, y = 1 + 4/(x + 7). Since y is an integer, 4/(x + 7) must also be an integer. Let me denote z = x + 7. Then, 4/z has to be an integer, so z must be a divisor of 4.

So, z is in the set of integers that divide 4. The divisors of 4 are ±1, ±2, ±4. So z can be -4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4.

Since z = x + 7, then x = z - 7.

Let me compute x for each possible z. 

1. If z = 1: x = 1 -7 = -6.
2. If z = -1: x = -1 -7 = -8.
3. If z = 2: x = 2 -7 = -5.
4. If z = -2: x = -2 -7 = -9.
5. If z = 4: x =4-7= -3.
6. If z = -4: x =-4-7=-11.

Wait a second, but looking at the options given, the possible x's are: A: -1, B: -3, C: -6, D: -4, E:1, F:3, G:-5, H:0, I:-2, J:2. So from my calculations, the x values I found are -6, -8, -5, -9, -3, and -11. But these aren't all in the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, because in the options, the largest x would be the highest value among those. Let me list all the possible x's from the options given. The options are A: -1, B: -3, C: -6, D: -4, E:1, F:3, G:-5, H:0, I:-2, J:2. So the x's in the options are -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, 0, 1, 2. But from my earlier calculations, the possible x's are -6, -5, -3, -11, etc. So the x's from the options are -6, -5, -4, -3, etc. Wait, I might have missed some options.

Wait, looking again, the options don't include -8, -9, -11, etc. So perhaps I should find all possible x's that are in the options and see which ones satisfy the condition.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me double-check my earlier steps because maybe I missed something. The key was that 4/(x +7) must be an integer. Therefore, x +7 must be a divisor of 4. So x +7 can be 1, -1, 2, -2, 4, -4. So x can be 1-7=-6, -1-7=-8, 2-7=-5, -2-7=-9, 4-7=-3, -4-7=-11.

Now, looking at the options, the x's are:

A: -1 → x +7 =6 → 4/6 is not integer.

B: -3 → x +7=4 → 4/4=1 → integer. So y=1+1=2. That's valid.

C: -6 → x +7=1 →4/1=4 → integer. y=1+4=5. So that's valid.

D: -4 → x +7=3 →4/3 not integer.

E:1 →x +7=8 →4/8=0.5 not integer.

F:3 →x +7=10 →4/10=0.4 not integer.

G:-5 →x +7=2 →4/2=2 → integer. So y=1+2=3. Valid.

H:0 →x +7=7 →4/7 not integer.

I:-2 →x +7=5 →4/5 not integer.

J:2 →x +7=9 →4/9 not integer.

So, from the options given, the x's that make y integer are B (-3), C (-6), G (-5). Among these, the largest x is -3. So the correct answer should be B: -3.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of x as -6, which is in the options. So when x is -6, y is 5, which is integer. So that's another valid option. So which of those is the largest x? -3 is larger than -6. So the correct answer is B: -3.

The correct answer is B: -3.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. We need to find the largest integer x such that (x + 11)/(x + 7) is an integer.
2. Let y = (x + 11)/(x + 7). For y to be an integer, 4/(x + 7) must also be an integer.
3. Thus, x + 7 must be a divisor of 4. The divisors of 4 are ±1, ±2, ±4.
4. Calculating x for each divisor: x = -6, -8, -5, -9, -3, -11.
5. Among the given options, x = -3, -6, -5 are valid.
6. The largest x among these is -3, which is option B.
