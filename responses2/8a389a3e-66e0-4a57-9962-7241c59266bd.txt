Okay, so I've got this problem here about forming a 7-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4. I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

First, I remember that when you have to arrange digits and there are duplicates, you divide by the factorial of the count of each duplicate. So the formula is n! divided by the product of the factorials of each repeated number.

In this case, the digits are 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4. So the digits are 1, followed by two 2s, three 3s, and a 4. Let me count: 1 appears once, 2 appears twice, 3 appears three times, and 4 appears once. So the total number of digits is 1+2+3+1 =7, which matches the problem.

So the total number of unique arrangements is the factorial of 7 divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each repeated digit. So that's 7! / (2! * 3! * 1! * 1!). Wait, but waitâ€”no, the 1! for digits that don't repeat, right?

Wait, let me clarify. The formula is 7! divided by (2! for the two 2s) multiplied by (3! for the three 3s). Because the 1s don't repeat, so we have 1! each, but 1! is 1, so it doesn't affect the calculation.

Calculating 7! is 5040. 2! is 2, 3! is 6. So the denominator is 2 *6 =12. Then 5040 divided by 12 is 420. So that's 420 ways. Hmm, checking the options, option C is 420, which would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any other constraints? The number has to be a 7-digit number, so the first digit can't be zero. But in this case, the digits are 1,2,3,4, so all are non-zero. So all the arrangements are valid 7-digit numbers. So no issues there.

Another check: the options given are A:500, B:560, C:420, D:600, E:210, F:720, G:840, H:1,260, I:300, J:350.

So yes, 420 is one of the options, option C.

The number of unique 7-digit arrangements of the digits 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4 is calculated by dividing 7! by (2! * 3! * 1! * 1!), resulting in 420. 

Answer: C
