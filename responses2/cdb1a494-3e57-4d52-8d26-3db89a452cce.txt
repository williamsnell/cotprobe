Okay, so I've got this tire pressure problem. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question says that in winter, the tire gauge reads 30 psi. The gauge measures the difference between the actual pressure and atmospheric pressure, which they say is 15 psi. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe the gauge pressure is the difference, so the actual pressure would be atmospheric plus the gauge pressure. But wait, sometimes tire gauges can have a standard offset, like including atmospheric pressure. So, if the gauge is 30 psi, that's the actual pressure minus atmospheric. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, atmospheric pressure is 15 psi. The gauge is 30 psi. So if the gauge measures the difference between the actual pressure and atmospheric, then actual pressure is 15 psi + 30 psi = 45 psi. Because if the tire is at 45 psi, the gauge would read 30 psi (since 45 - 15=30). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, if the gauge is measuring the difference, then when the actual is higher, the gauge will be positive. So the gauge is 30 psi, which would be the actual pressure minus atmospheric. So, if the actual pressure is P, then P - 15 = 30. So P = 45 psi. Got it.

Now, the tire is measured during the summer at 50°C. We need to find the new gauge pressure. Wait, what's the process here? Since the tire doesn't leak and doesn't change volume, it's a constant volume situation. So this is about the ideal gas law, but since it's a gas-filled tire, the pressure and temperature are changing, but volume is constant. So the relationship between pressure and temperature would be such that (P1 * T1) = (P2 * T2), assuming constant volume and no leaks.

Wait, but wait, the gauge pressure is given as 30 psi at 0°C. Wait, but the actual pressure is 45 psi at 0°C. Because P = P_gauge + P_atm. So 30 psi + 15 psi = 45 psi. So initial conditions are P1 = 45 psi, T1 = 0°C, which is 273.15 K (since 0°C is 273.15 K). 

Now, in summer, the temperature is 50°C, which is 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K. We need to find the new gauge pressure, P2_gauge, which would be P2 - 15 psi. So first, find P2, the actual pressure, then subtract 15 to get the gauge.

So using the ideal gas law for constant volume: P1 * T1 = P2 * T2.

We can rearrange to find P2 = (P1 * T1) / T2.

Let me plug in the numbers:

P1 = 45 psi.

T1 = 273.15 K.

T2 = 323.15 K.

So P2 = (45 * 273.15) / 323.15.

Calculating that: let's compute 45 * 273.15 first.

45 * 273.15 = let's see. 45 * 273 = 45*(200+73) = 45*200=9000, 45*73=3285 → 9000+3285=12285. Then 45 *0.15=6.75, so total 12285 +6.75= 12291.75.

Now divide by 323.15: 12291.75 / 323.15 ≈ Let me compute that. Let's see, 323.15 × 38 is about 323 *38. 300*38=11400, 23*38=874 → 11400+874=12274. So 38 *323.15 = 12274.7. Our numerator is 12291.75. So 12291.75-12274.7=17.05. So 17.05 /323.15 ≈ 0.0528. So P2 ≈38 +0.0528 ≈38.0528 psi.

Wait, that would be the actual pressure. So the gauge pressure is P2 -15 = 38.0528 -15 = 23.0528 psi. Wait, but that can't be right. Because the options don't have anything below 30. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, no, because 38 psi would be the actual pressure. So the gauge pressure would be 23 psi, but that's not in the options. So I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, wait, maybe the temperature is in Fahrenheit? No, because in the question, it says 0°C and 50°C, which is in Celsius. So that's correct.

Let me try to re-calculate. Maybe I approximated too much.

Let me compute 45 * 273.15 first.

45 * 273.15: 45*273 is 12285, and 45 *0.15=6.75. So 12285 +6.75 = 12291.75.

Now, dividing by 323.15.

323.15 * 38 = 323.15 * 30 =9694.5, 323.15 *8=2585.2 → 9694.5 +2585.2=12279.7.

So 38 gives 12279.7. Our numerator is 12291.75. So 12291.75 -12279.7 =12.05.

So 12.05 /323.15 = approximately 0.0373.

So 38 + 0.0373 ≈38.0373 psi.

So P2=38.0373 psi. So the actual pressure is about 38.04 psi.

So the gauge pressure is P2 -15 psi = 38.04-15=23.04 psi. But wait, none of the options are around 23. So that can't be right. So I must have an error in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of percentage change in pressure due to temperature change, considering that gauge pressure also depends on absolute pressure, not just the gauge.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the absolute pressure formula.

Because, since the volume is constant, the pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature. But the gauge pressure is the actual minus atmospheric. So let's think in terms of absolute pressure.

Let me rephrase:

At winter, the gauge pressure is 30 psi, and the actual pressure is 45 psi. So gauge = actual - atmospheric. So actual = 45 psi. So the absolute pressure is 45 psi.

In summer, the absolute pressure will be higher because the temperature increases. So find the new absolute pressure, then subtract 15 psi (atmospheric) to get the new gauge pressure.

So using the ideal gas law for constant volume:

P1 * T1 = P2 * T2.

Where P1 is the initial absolute pressure (which is 45 psi), T1 is 0°C (273.15 K), P2 is the new absolute pressure, and T2 is 50°C (323.15 K).

So P2 = (P1 * T2) / T1.

So P2 = (45 psi * 323.15 K) / 273.15 K.

Let me compute that.

45 *323.15 = let's compute 45 *300 =13500, 45*23.15=1041.75. So 13500 +1041.75=14541.75.

Divide by 273.15 → 14541.75 /273.15.

Hmm, let's compute that. 273.15 *53=14554.95. Because 273 *53=14529, 0.15*53=7.95, so 14529+7.95=14536.95. Close.

But 14541.75 divided by 273.15. Let me see: 273.15 *53 is about 14536.95. So 14541.75-14536.95=4.8. So 4.8 /273.15≈0.0176.

So 53 +0.0176≈53.0176. So P2≈53.0176 psi.

So the new absolute pressure is about 53.02 psi.

Thus, the new gauge pressure is 53.02 -15=38.02 psi. So approximately 38.02 psi. Looking at the options, option H is 38 psi, which matches. So the correct answer is H: 38 psi.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between pressure and temperature using the ideal gas law, assuming constant volume and no leaks. The tire's pressure is measured with a gauge pressure of 30 psi at 0°C, where the actual pressure is the sum of the gauge pressure and atmospheric pressure (15 psi). Thus, the actual pressure is:

\[
P_{\text{actual}} = P_{\text{gauge}} + P_{\text{atm}} = 30 \, \text{psi} + 15 \, \text{psi} = 45 \, \text{psi}.
\]

In the summer, the temperature rises to 50°C (323.15 K), and the actual pressure changes accordingly. Using the ideal gas law for constant volume:

\[
P_1 \cdot T_1 = P_2 \cdot T_2,
\]

where:
- \( P_1 = 45 \, \text{psi} \) (initial absolute pressure),
- \( T_1 = 273.15 \, \text{K} \) (initial temperature in Kelvin),
- \( T_2 = 323.15 \, \text{K} \) (final temperature in Kelvin),
- \( P_2 \) is the new absolute pressure.

Rearranging for \( P_2 \):

\[
P_2 = \frac{P_1 \cdot T_2}{T_1}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_2 = \frac{45 \cdot 323.15}{273.15} \approx 53.02 \, \text{psi}.
\]

The new gauge pressure is the difference between the new absolute pressure and the atmospheric pressure:

\[
P_{\text{gauge}} = P_2 - P_{\text{atm}} = 53.02 \, \text{psi} - 15 \, \text{psi} = 38.02 \, \text{psi}.
\]

Thus, the new gauge pressure is approximately **38 psi**, which corresponds to option **H**.
