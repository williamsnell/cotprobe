Alright, so I've got this question in front of me about amino acids and their essential components. Hmm, let's see. The question lists several groups of amino acids, and I need to pick the correct one. I remember that essential amino acids are those that the human body can't produce on its own and must be consumed from food. 

Okay, let me think. Essential amino acids include leucine, methionine, threonine, and so on. Wait, I think the standard list includes 11 essential amino acids. Let me list them out to get clear.

Essential amino acids (EAs) are:
- Leucine
- Methionine
- Threonine
- Cysteine
- Glycine
- Aspartate
- Valine
- Leucine (wait, no, I think I might have that wrong)

Wait, no, I think the correct list is:
Leucine, Methionine, Threonine, Cysteine, Glycine, Valine, Leucine? No, wait, no. Wait, no, I think the list is:

Essential amino acids are:
Leucine, Methionine, Threonine, Cysteine, Glycine, Valine, Leucine? Or is that incorrect. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. I think the standard list is Leucine, Methionine, Threonine, Cysteine, Valine, and Glycine. Oh wait, no, I'm mixing up some.

Wait, another approach: what are the options given? The options are labeled from A to J, each with three amino acids. So each option is a trio. So I need to find which trio is a group of essential amino acids.

Let me list the options:

A: leucine, methionine, threonine
B: leucine, cysteine, glycine
C: proline, tyrosine, serine
D: valine, glycine, arginine
E: methionine, serine, tyrosine
F: isoleucine, alanine, glycine
G: lysine, tyrosine, cysteine
H: aspartate, valine, threonine
I: phenylalanine, arginine, isoleucine
J: lysine, proline, arginine

Wait, I need to remember which of these are essential. Let's think about each one:

Methionine is essential. So any option that includes methionine must be correct. Looking at the options, option A includes methionine, so A is a possible correct answer. But let me check others.

Glycine is essential. So any option with glycine. Looking, option B has glycine, option J has lysine, proline, arginine. But proline isn't essential. So J is probably incorrect.

Valine is essential. So any option including valine. Option D includes valine. Option G has lysine, tyrosine, cysteine. Lysine is essential, Tyrosine is not (as it's a side chain, not an amino acid), Cysteine is essential. So G is a mix of essential and non-essential, so probably incorrect.

Looking again, for each option:

A: All three are EAs (leucine, meth, threonine). Meth is essential, so yes.

B: Includes glycine. So if meth and glyc are essential, this could be correct. But wait, meth is essential, but is B correct? Let me check.

C: Proline is not essential. So C is out.

D: Valine (essential), Glycine (essential), Arginine (not essential). So D is incorrect.

E: Meth is essential but serine and tyrosine are not. So E is incorrect.

F: Alanine (not EAs), Glycine (yes), but meth is correct but Alanine is not. So F is incorrect.

G: K, Tyrosine (no), Cysteine (yes). So K and C are EAs, Tyrosine isn't. So this trio is incorrect.

H: Aspartate (not EAs), Valine (yes), Threonine (yes). But aspartate is a cofactor, not an EAs. So this trio is incorrect.

I: Phe, Arg, Ile. Phe is not, Arg is not (Arg is not essential), Ile is not. So incorrect.

J: K, Pro, Arg. K is yes, but Pro and Arg are not essential. So J is incorrect.

So reviewing, the only correct option is A: leucine, methionine, threonine.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because I thought that other options include other combinations. Let me think again. Oh wait, methionine is essential, so any group that includes methionine must be correct.

Looking at options:

A includes meth, so correct.

B includes glyc, so correct, but since meth is also there, is it correct?

Wait, the question says "all essential components of the diet" are listed in each option. So each option is a trio of EAs, because the question lists amino acids as essential, which implies they are EAs.

So the correct group would be any trio that includes three EAs.

Wait, but some options may have two EAs and a non-EA.

So, meth is essential, so any group with meth must be correct.

So which options have meth?

A: yes.

B: yes.

G: no, because it includes C (yes) and K (yes), but also Y (no).

H: no, aspartate is a cofactor.

D: no, arginine is not.

E: no.

F: no, alanine is not.

G: no.

J: no.

So the options that include meth are A and B.

Wait, but I thought that B also includes glycine, which is correct. So which of these is correct?

Wait, but the question is about which group is correct. So perhaps both A and B could be correct, but let me double-check.

Wait, no, the question lists the options as each a possible trio of EAs. So the correct answer would be any trio that correctly lists all EAs.

Wait, wait. Wait, looking again:

The question says "all essential components of the diet" are listed, so each option is a trio of EAs.

Now, I should recall that the standard list includes:

Leucine: yes

Methionine: yes

Threonine: yes

Cysteine: yes

Glycine: yes

Aspartate: cofactor, not EAs.

Valine: yes

Arginine: no

Ileucine: no

So which option includes three EAs? Let me look.

Looking at each option:

A: Leu, Met, Thr: all three are EAs. So correct.

B: Leu, Cys, Gly: Leu and Gly are EAs. Cys is not, so B is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought that Glycine is essential, so B is correct. But wait, no, because the group includes Cys, which isn't an EAs. So B is incorrect.

Wait, so only A is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm:

Option A includes leucine, methionine, threonine. All three are EAs. So that's correct.

Option B includes Leu, Cys, Gly. Cys is not. So B is incorrect.

So the correct answer is A.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because another thought: meth is essential, but the other two in A are also EAs. So A is correct.

Wait, but another approach: which of the options includes all three EAs.

Looking again:

A: yes.

Other options:

B: includes Cys (no), so incorrect.

C: includes proline (no), so incorrect.

D: Val and Gly, but includes Arg (no), so incorrect.

E: includes serine (no) and Tyrosine (no), so incorrect.

F: includes Alanine (no), so incorrect.

G: includes Cys (yes) and K (yes), but includes Tyrosine (no), so incorrect.

H: includes Aspartate (no), Val (yes), and Tyrosine (no) → incorrect.

I: includes Phe (no), Arg (no), Ile (no) → incorrect.

J: includes K (yes), but Pro and Arg are not (so incorrect).

So only option A is a trio of EAs.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have been wrong earlier. Because I think Meth is essential, but I'm not sure about the other two. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the list.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify a group of amino acids that are all essential components of the diet. Essential amino acids are those that the human body cannot produce on its own and must be consumed. The essential amino acids include leucine, methionine, threonine, and glycine, among others. Let us analyze each option:

- **A: leucine, methionine, threonine**  
  All three are essential amino acids. Methionine is a core component of the human diet, and both leucine and threonine are essential. This group is correct.

- **B: leucine, cysteine, glycine**  
  While leucine and glycine are essential, cysteine is also essential. However, the inclusion of cysteine makes this group incorrect.

- **C: proline, tyrosine, serine**  
  Proline is not an essential amino acid, and tyrosine and serine are not essential. This group is incorrect.

- **D: valine, glycine, arginine**  
  Valine and glycine are essential, but arginine is not. This group is incorrect.

- **E: methionine, serine, tyrosine**  
  Methionine is essential, but serine and tyrosine are not. This group is incorrect.

- **F: isoleucine, alanine, glycine**  
  Alanine is not an essential amino acid, making this group incorrect.

- **G: lysine, tyrosine, cysteine**  
  Cysteine is essential, but lysine and tyrosine are not. This group is incorrect.

- **H: aspartate, valine, threonine**  
  Aspartate is a cofactor, not an essential amino acid, making this group incorrect.

- **I: phenylalanine, arginine, isoleucine**  
  Arginine and isoleucine are not essential amino acids. This group is incorrect.

- **J: lysine, proline, arginine**  
  Lysine and proline are not essential amino acids. This group is incorrect.

After evaluating all options, the only correct group of essential amino acids is **A: leucine, methionine, threonine**.
