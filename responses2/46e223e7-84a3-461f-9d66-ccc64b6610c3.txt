Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about a plane wall with two layers: an inside layer of refractory brick and an outside layer of common brick. I need to find the rate of heat loss per unit area.

First, I remember that for heat transfer through composite walls, we usually have to calculate the thermal resistance of each layer and then combine them. Since the wall is made of two materials in series, the total resistance will be the sum of their individual resistances. Then, using the formula for heat transfer, I can find the rate of heat loss. 

Wait, but wait, the formula for heat transfer through a wall is Q = (ΔT) * (1/R_total), where R is the resistance. So Q is the heat per unit time, but the question asks for the rate per unit area, so I might need to use the area term as well. Hmm, actually, maybe I should think in terms of area. Or perhaps, since it's per unit area, the formula might simplify.

Wait, let me recall the formula. The general formula for heat transfer in a composite wall is Q/A = (T_in - T_out) / R_total, where Q is heat per second, A is area, R is resistance. Oh wait, wait no, wait. The formula is Q/A = (T_in - T_out) / (R1 + R2) — because R_total is R1 + R2.

But wait, another approach: Each layer contributes to the total resistance. So for each layer, the thermal resistance R is (thickness)/(area * k), but area cancels out when calculating Q/A. Because each layer is a slab, R = L/(kA), so for a layer of thickness L and thermal conductivity k, the resistance R is L/(k*A). So when you add resistances, you sum them up.

Wait, yes, because for each layer, since it's a plane wall, the area A is the same for both layers, so when you add resistances, you just add the L/(k) terms. So the total R_total = R1 + R2 = (L1/k1 + L2/k2).

Then, the heat flux (q) is given by q = (T_in - T_out) / R_total. Since R_total is (L1/k1 + L2/k2), the flux becomes (T_in - T_out) / (L1/k1 + L2/k2) = (T_in - T_out) * (k1 + k2 L1 / (L2 k1)) ? Wait, no, perhaps another way.

Wait, the formula for heat flux (q) through a composite wall is (T_in - T_out)/(R_total), which is (T_in - T_out)/( (L1/(k1 A)) + (L2/(k2 A)) )) = (T_in - T_out) * A / ( L1/(k1) + L2/(k2) ) ). But when you're looking for q per unit area, then the A cancels, and q = (T_in - T_out) * (k1 k2 L1 L2) / ( (k1 L2) + (k2 L1) ) ) ? Hmm, no, perhaps I should think in terms of each part.

Alternatively, think of each layer's contribution. For each layer, the heat per unit area is (T_in - T_out) * (k * area) / (thickness). Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right way.

Wait, no. Let me get back. The formula for each layer is q = (T_in - T_out) * (k * A) / (L). Because for a single layer, the heat per unit area (q) is (T1 - T2) * (k*A) / (L). Then, since the layers are in series, the total q is the sum of the q from each layer. Wait, but for each layer, the area is the same, so perhaps the total q is (q1 + q2) = (T_in - T_out) * (k1 A + k2 A) / (L1 + L2). But wait, no, that's not correct because each layer's resistance is separate.

Wait, another approach. The total heat transfer per second Q is (T_in - T_out) * A * (1/(R1 + R2)), where R1 is the resistance of the first layer and R2 of the second. So the flux q = Q/A = (T_in - T_out) / (R1 + R2) = (T_in - T_out) * (k1 + k2 L1/(L2 k1)) )? I'm getting a bit tangled up.

Wait, let me try to compute each resistance.

Given:
First layer (refractory brick): k1 = 0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F, thickness L1 =6 in. 
Second layer (common brick): k2 =0.8 Btu/hr-ft-°F, thickness L2=9 in.

Wait, but the units may be in feet. Since 1 ft = 12 in, so each layer is 6 and 9 inches, which is 0.5 ft and 0.75 ft.

So, first layer's resistance R1 = L1/(k1 * A), but as I thought earlier, A cancels because all layers have same A.

So R1 = L1/(k1 * A) = (0.5 ft) / (0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F * A) ) = (0.5 / 0.08) / A * ( Btu/hr-ft-°F )

Wait, the units of R1 would be (ft) / ( (Btu/hr-ft-°F) * ft ) ) → (ft) / ( (Btu/(hr * ft * °F )) * ft ) ) → (ft^2 * hr * °F ) / (Btu * ft) ) → (ft * hr * °F ) / (Btu ) ?

Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute each R in terms of k and L in ft, then sum.

So for R1: 6 inches is 0.5 ft. R1 = (0.5 ft) / (0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F) ) → (0.5 / 0.08) hr/°F → 6.25 hr/°F. Wait, but I'm not sure about the units, perhaps I should just proceed without worrying about the units for now.

Wait, but perhaps I should just compute each resistance and sum them.

Compute R1 = L1/(k1 * A) → but since A cancels when adding resistances, R_total = R1 + R2 = (L1/k1) + (L2/k2).

Wait, is that correct? Because each layer's R is (thickness)/(k * area), so when you add resistances, since each has area A, R_total = (L1/k1 + L2/k2) / A. Wait, no, because R = L/(kA) → so R1 = L1/(k1 A), R2 = L2/(k2 A). Then, R_total = R1 + R2 = (L1/(k1 A)) + (L2/(k2 A)) ) = (L1/(k1) + L2/(k2)) ) / A. So when you add them, you get (L1/(k1 A) + L2/(k2 A)) ) = (L1/(k1) + L2/(k2)) ) * (1/A). So, R_total = (L1/(k1) + L2/(k2)) ) / A.

But then, what is the formula for heat flux (q)?

q = (T_in - T_out) / R_total.

Substituting R_total,

q = (T_in - T_out) * A / ( L1/(k1) + L2/(k2) )

Wait, so q = (ΔT) * (k1 A) / (L1 + (L2 k1)/(k2) ) ) 

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me re-express the denominator:

Denominator is (L1/k1 + L2/k2) = [ L1 * k2 + L2 * k1 ] / (k1 k2 )

So, denominator = (L1 k2 + L2 k1) / (k1 k2 )

So, q = (ΔT) * A / [ (L1 k2 + L2 k1) / (k1 k2) ) ] → q = (ΔT) * A * (k1 k2) / (L1 k2 + L2 k1 )

But wait, this seems complicated, perhaps I should compute each layer's contribution separately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the heat loss through each layer and then sum them.

Because for each layer, the heat flux (q) is the same. Because heat flows from one layer to the other, so the heat per unit area through each layer is the same.

So, for the first layer (refractory brick), q = (T_in - T1) * (k1 * A) / (L1) → q = (1800 - 200) * 0.08 * A / 6 inches? Wait, wait, units again.

Wait, let's compute for the first layer:

q = (T_in - T1) * (A) * (k1) / (L1 )

Similarly, for the second layer:

q = (T1 - T_out) * (A) * (k2) / (L2 )

Since the heat flux is same, these two should be equal.

So, (1600) * (0.08) * A / 6 = (1600) * (0.8) * A /9 → Let me compute.

Wait, wait, T_in is 1800, T_out is 200, so the temperature drops across the two layers.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

The first layer: thickness L1=6 in=0.5 ft. k1=0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F. So,

q = (1800 - 200) * (0.08) * A / 0.5 → (1600) * 0.08 * A / 0.5 → 1600 * 0.08 = 128 → 128 * A / 0.5 → 256 A.

For the second layer, thickness L2=9 in=0.75 ft, k2=0.8 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

q = (1800-200)*0.8 * A / 0.75 → 1600 * 0.8 → 1280 → 1280 * A / 0.75 → approximately 1706.666... A.

Wait, but this can't be right because the q should be same for both layers. So I must have made a mistake. Because, when I compute q for each layer, they should be the same since the heat flux is the same across the wall.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the q for the first layer:

q = (T_in - T1) * (k1 * A) / (L1) → 1600 * 0.08 * A / 0.5 → 1600*0.08=128 → 128*A / 0.5 → 256 A.

For the second layer:

q = (T1 - T_out) * (k2 * A) / (L2) → (1600) * 0.8 * A / 0.75 → 1600 * 0.8 = 1280 → 1280 A /0.75 → approximately 1706.666 A.

But for q to be same in both layers, 256 A = 1706.666 A → which is not possible. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the area A is the same for both layers. So when I compute q for each layer, the 'A' cancels out. So let's redo that.

Wait, perhaps the proper way is to compute q for each layer individually, but since they are in series, the q must be the same.

So, for the first layer:

q = (ΔT1) * (k1 * A) / L1 → 1600 * 0.08 * A / 0.5 → same as before, 256 A.

For the second layer:

q = (ΔT2) * (k2 * A) / L2 → 1600 * 0.8 * A / 0.75 → 1600 * 0.8 = 1280 → 1280 A / 0.75 → approximately 1706.666 A.

But 256 A = 1706.666 A → which would imply that 256=1706.666, which is not true. So this indicates a problem. Because in reality, heat must flow through both layers, so the q must be the same. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating q.

Wait, perhaps the way I applied the formula is incorrect. Let me think again.

The formula for heat transfer through a single layer is q = (ΔT) * (k * A) / (L).

Wait, no. The formula is q = (ΔT) * (k * A) / (L). So the heat per unit time (q) is this.

In this case, the first layer's q is (1600) * (0.08) * A / 0.5 → 1600 * 0.08 = 128 → 128 * A / 0.5 → 256 A.

The second layer's q is (1600) * (0.8) * A / 0.75 → 1600 * 0.8=1280 → 1280*A / 0.75 → 1706.666 A.

But for both layers to have the same q, we have 256 A = 1706.666 A → which is impossible. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: since the two layers are in series, the total thermal resistance R_total is R1 + R2, and the heat transfer q is (T_in - T_out) / R_total.

So R1 = L1/(k1 * A ), R2 = L2/(k2 * A). So R_total = (L1/(k1 A) ) + (L2/(k2 A)) ) → (L1/k1 + L2/k2 ) / A.

Wait, but then q = (ΔT) / R_total → ΔT is 1600 F.

So q = (1600) / [ (L1/(k1 A) + L2/(k2 A)) ] → 1600 * A / ( L1/(k1) + L2/(k2) )

So q = (1600 * A) / (6/(0.08) + 9/(0.8) )

Compute denominator:

6/(0.08) = 75. 9/(0.8) = 11.25.

75 + 11.25 = 86.25.

So q = 1600 A / 86.25 → 1600 / 86.25 = approximately 18.5333 → 18.5333 A.

Wait, that's the heat per unit time.

But wait, the question asks for the rate per unit area, so q would be (1600 A)/86.25 → So when you divide by A, q/A = 1600 / 86.25 = approximately 18.5333 Btu/hr-ft².

But wait, that's not one of the options given. The options are around 300, 400, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, wait. I think I messed up the thickness units or the formula. Let me double-check the units.

Wait, the thickness is given in inches. Let me convert to feet. 6 inches is 0.5 ft, 9 inches is 0.75 ft.

The formula for the total thermal resistance is R_total = (L1)/(k1 * A) + (L2)/(k2 * A) → but since A is same in both terms, R_total = (L1/k1 + L2/k2) / A.

So the formula for q is (ΔT) * A / ( L1/k1 + L2/k2 )

So q = (1600) * A / ( 6/(0.08) + 9/(0.8) )

Compute denominator:

6/(0.08) → 6 ÷ 0.08 = 75.

9/(0.8) → 9 ÷ 0.8 → 11.25.

Sum → 75 + 11.25 = 86.25.

So,

q = (1600 A ) / 86.25 → 1600 / 86.25 = approx 18.5333.

But that's the value of q in units of (A * Btu/hr). Because q is (ΔT * A)/R_total, which is in terms of heat per second. Wait, but I'm a little confused about the units.

Wait, let me think differently. The formula for q (heat per second) through a composite wall is:

q = (T_in - T_out) * (k1 * k2 * (L1 + L2) ) / ( (k1 * L2) + (k2 * L1) ) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should approach this more systematically.

The correct approach is to compute the thermal resistance for each layer, sum them, and then find the heat per second. Then, since the question is about the rate per unit area, I can divide the heat per second by the area to get Btu/hr-ft².

So:

1. Compute R1 = L1/(k1 * A)
2. Compute R2 = L2/(k2 * A)
3. R_total = R1 + R2
4. q = (T_in - T_out) / R_total
5. q/A = (T_in - T_out) * A / ( R_total * A ) → (T_in - T_out) / R_total, which is q. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you calculate q/A, it would be (T_in - T_out) * (A) / (R_total * A) ) → (T_in - T_out) / R_total = q, which is per second. Wait, perhaps I should re-express.

Alternatively, since the question is asking for per unit area, the formula is:

q/A = (ΔT) * (k1 k2 (L1 + L2)) ) / ( (k1 L2 + k2 L1 ) (k1 k2 A) ) )

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to compute each layer's contribution.

Alternatively, think of the heat per second (q) through the wall as (T_in - T_out) * A / (R_total).

So, first compute R_total:

R_total = (L1/(k1 A)) + (L2/(k2 A)) ) = ( L1 k2 + L2 k1 ) / ( k1 k2 A )

So R_total = (6*0.8 + 9*0.08) / (0.08*0.8 A) )

Wait, wait. Let me compute numerator and denominator correctly.

Wait, L1 is 6 in = 0.5 ft, L2 is 9 in = 0.75 ft.

So,

R_total = (0.5 ft)/(0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F * A) + (0.75 ft)/(0.8 Btu/hr-ft-°F * A )

Which is (0.5/(0.08 A )) + (0.75/(0.8 A )) 

So, R_total = [ 0.5/(0.08 A ) + 0.75/(0.8 A ) ] = [ (0.5 * 0.8) + (0.75 * 0.08) ] / (A * 0.08 * 0.8 )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate each R and sum.

Compute R1 = 0.5 ft / (0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F * A ) → 0.5 / 0.08 = 6.25 hr/°F.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the resistance in terms of (Btu/hr) and so on.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each R in terms of (Btu/(ft-°F)).

So,

R1 = L1/(k1 * A) → 0.5 ft / (0.08 * A ) → 0.5/(0.08) = 6.25 (Btu/(ft-°F)).

Similarly, R2 = 0.75 ft / (0.8 * A ) → 0.75/0.8 = 0.9375 (Btu/(ft-°F)).

So, R_total = 6.25 + 0.9375 = 7.1875 (Btu/(ft-°F)).

Now, the heat per second (q) is (T_in - T_out) * (k1 * k2 * (L1 + L2)) / ( (k1 L2 + k2 L1) * R_total ) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula q = (T1 - T2) * (k1 * A) / (L1) + (T2 - T3) * (k2 * A) / (L2).

But since the heat flux is same, q = (T1 - T2) * (k1 A) / L1 = (T2 - T3) * (k2 A) / L2.

So,

(T1 - T2) * (k1 A) / L1 = (T2 - T3) * (k2 A) / L2 → (T1 - T2) * k1 / L1 = (T2 - T3) * k2 / L2.

So, 1600 * 0.08 / 0.5 = 1600 * 0.8 / 0.75 → 1600 * (0.08 / 0.5) = 1600 * 0.16 = 256.

On the other side: 1600 * 0.8 = 1280 → divided by 0.75 → 1280 / 0.75 ≈ 1706.666.

Wait, but 256 is not equal to 1706.666, so that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat loss through each layer and sum them.

The heat loss through the first layer (refractory) is q1 = (T_in - T1) * (k1 * A) / L1.

The heat loss through the second layer (brick) is q2 = (T1 - T_out) * (k2 * A) / L2.

Since the heat flux is same, q1 = q2.

So, (1800 - 200) * (0.08 * A) / 0.5 = (1800 - 200) * (0.8 * A) / 0.75.

Simplifying, 1600 * (0.08 A) / 0.5 = 1600 * (0.8 A) / 0.75.

Compute each side:

Left: 1600 * 0.08 = 128 → 128 / 0.5 = 256 → 256 A.

Right: 1600 * 0.8 = 1280 → 1280 / 0.75 ≈ 1706.666 → 1706.666 A.

But 256 A = 1706.666 A → which is impossible, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat loss through each layer using the same formula, but with the same q.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat loss in terms of the thermal resistance.

The thermal resistance R for each layer is R1 = L1/(k1 A), R2 = L2/(k2 A).

Since they are in series, R_total = R1 + R2.

Then, q = (T_in - T_out) / R_total.

So,

q = (1600) / ( R1 + R2 )

Compute R1 and R2:

R1 = 0.5/(0.08) = 6.25 (Btu/(ft-°F)).

R2 = 0.75/(0.8) = 0.9375 (Btu/(ft-°F)).

R_total = 6.25 + 0.9375 = 7.1875.

So,

q = 1600 / 7.1875 → approximately 223.5 Btu/(min-°F) → but I'm getting confused about units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the area units to find the heat per unit area.

Wait, the q is the heat per second (q = heat per second). So, if I compute q, and then divide by A, I get q/A (heat per second per unit area), which is what the question is asking.

Wait, no. The question is about the rate of heat loss per unit area. So the correct approach is to compute the total heat loss (q) through the wall, then divide by the area (A) to get q/A.

So, let's compute q.

q = (T_in - T_out) / R_total → (1600) / (7.1875) → Approximately 223.5 Btu/(min-°F) → Wait, but that's per second? Or per minute?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, R_total is in Btu/(ft-°F), and q is in Btu/(min-°F) → but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute q in Btu/s.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the units.

Wait, 0.5 ft is the thickness of the first layer, and 0.08 Btu/(ft-°F) is the thermal resistance of the first layer.

Wait, R1 = L1/(k1 * A) → Units of R are (ft)/( (Btu/(ft-°F)) * (ft²) ) → (ft) * (ft-°F) / ( Btu * ft ) → (ft² * °F ) / ( Btu * ft ) → (ft * °F ) / Btu.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the R has units of (Btu/(ft-°F)) * (ft²) → which is (Btu ft) / (°F).

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation in terms of Btu/(min-°F).

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed numerically.

So, R_total = 7.1875.

q = 1600 / 7.1875 → approximately 223.5 Btu/(min-°F) → but this doesn't make sense because the question is about the rate per unit area. So perhaps I should compute the heat loss per unit area by first finding the heat loss per unit time and then dividing by the area.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the heat loss per unit area without considering the entire wall. Let me think.

The formula for the heat loss is q = (T_in - T_out) * (k1 * A) / (L1) + (T_out - T_out) * (k2 * A ) / (L2) → which doesn't make sense because (T_out - T_out) is zero.

Wait, perhaps I should recast the problem using the formula for the overall heat transfer for a composite slab.

The formula is:

q = (T_in - T_out) / ( (L1)/(k1 A) + (L2)/(k2 A) ) )

Which simplifies to:

q = (T_in - T_out) * A / ( (L1/k1) + (L2/k2) )

So, q = (1600) * A / ( (0.5 / 0.08) + (0.75 / 0.8) )

Compute denominator:

0.5 / 0.08 = 6.25

0.75 / 0.8 = 0.9375

Sum: 6.25 + 0.9375 = 7.1875

So,

q = 1600 * A / 7.1875 → (1600 / 7.1875 ) * A → Approximately 223.5 * A.

But the question is about q/A, which would be 223.5.

Wait, but the question is asking for the rate per unit area, so I can write q/A = 223.5. But looking at the options, none are 223.5. The options are 300, 400, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express the formula for q.

Wait, the correct formula for the heat transfer through a composite slab is:

q = (T_in - T_out) / ( (L1)/(k1 A) + (L2)/(k2 A) ) )

Which is q = (T_in - T_out) * A / ( (L1/k1) + (L2/k2) )

So, in this case, q = (1600) * A / (6.25 + 0.9375) → (1600 * A) /7.1875 → (1600 /7.1875 ) * A → approximately 223.5 * A.

But then, q/A would be 223.5, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I converted the units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the area from square feet to square inches. Because when I compute q = q_total, which is in Btu/s, then q/A would be Btu/(s·in²).

Wait, but the problem asks for the rate of heat loss per unit area, so the correct approach is to compute q (heat per second) and then divide by A (area) to get q/A (heat per second per unit area).

So, let me compute q correctly:

q = (T_in - T_out) * A / ( (L1/k1) + (L2/k2) )

Now,

T_in = 1800 F,

T_out = 200 F.

So,

ΔT = 1600 F.

Now, compute denominator:

(L1/k1) = 0.5 / 0.08 = 6.25.

(L2/k2) = 0.75 / 0.8 = 0.9375.

Sum: 6.25 + 0.9375 = 7.1875.

So,

q = 1600 * A /7.1875 → approximately 223.5 * A.

So, q/A = 223.5 Btu/(s·ft²).

But looking at the options, the closest is 300 and 200.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (L1/k1) + (L2/k2) correctly.

Wait, 0.5 / 0.08 = 6.25.

0.75 / 0.8 = 0.9375.

Sum: 6.25 + 0.9375 = 7.1875.

So, q = (1600) * A / 7.1875 → 1600 /7.1875 = 223.5.

So, q/A = 223.5.

But the options are 300, 400, 180, 200. So 223 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be q = (T_in - T_out) * A * (k1 + k2) / (L1 + L2).

Wait, no, that would be for a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the overall heat transfer for a composite slab where the heat loss is through each layer.

So, the heat loss through each layer is:

q1 = (T_in - T1) * (k1 * A) / L1

q2 = (T1 - T2) * (k2 * A) / L2

But since the heat loss is the same, q1 = q2.

So,

(T_in - T1) * k1 / L1 = (T1 - T2) * k2 / L2.

So, let's compute this.

T_in = 1800 F,

T1 is 200 F (the temperature at the boundary of the first layer),

T2 is 200 F (the temperature at the boundary of the second layer).

So,

(1800 - 200) * 0.08 / 0.5 = (200 - 200) * 0.8 / 0.75 → 1600 * 0.16 = 0.

Which is correct, because the heat flux is same.

So, that approach doesn't give us the heat per unit area, it just confirms the heat flux.

So, perhaps I should proceed with the formula that gives q/A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the heat loss through each layer and sum them, then divide by the area.

So, compute q1 and q2.

q1 = (1800 - 200) * (0.08) / (0.5) → 1600 * 0.08 / 0.5 → 1600 * 0.16 → 256.

q2 = (200 - 200) * (0.8) / (0.75) → 0.

So, total q = 256 Btu/s.

But then, q/A = 256 / A.

But without knowing A, I can't find the numerical value.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem states that the question is about the rate of heat loss per unit area. So, perhaps I should compute the heat loss per unit area using the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the overall thermal resistance and then find the heat loss.

The overall thermal resistance R is R = L1/(k1 A) + L2/(k2 A).

R = 0.5/(0.08 A) + 0.75/(0.8 A) → 6.25/(A) + 0.9375/(A) → 7.1875/(A).

So, R =7.1875/(A).

The heat loss q is q = ΔT * A / R → ΔT is 1600.

So, q = 1600 * A / (7.1875 / A ) → 1600 * A² /7.1875 → (1600 /7.1875) * A² → approximately 223.5 * A².

But the question is about q/A, which would be 223.5.

But none of the options match 223.5. The closest is option B (200), and option D (180). Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate 1600 divided by 7.1875.

1600 ÷ 7.1875.

7.1875 * 224 = 7.1875 * 200 = 1,437.5; 7.1875 *24=172.5; total 1,610.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute 7.1875 * 223.5.

7.1875 *223 = ?

Well, 7 *223 = 1,561.

0.1875 *223 = approx 0.1875 *200=37.5; 0.1875*23=4.3125→ 37.5+4.3125=41.8125.

So, 1,561 +41.8125=1,602.8125.

Hmm, which is more than 1,600.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 7.1875 *223.5.

Let me compute 7.1875 * 223 = 7.1875 * (200 +23) = 1,437.5 + 172.5 = 1,610.

Then, 7.1875 *0.5=3.59375.

So, total 1,610 +3.59375=1,613.59375.

But 1,613.59375 is more than 1,600.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 7.1875 * x =1,600.

So, x=1,600 /7.1875.

Which is approximately 223.5.

So, 7.1875 *223.5=1,613.59375.

Wait, that's not possible because 7.1875 *223=1,602.8125.

Wait, 7.1875 *223=1,602.8125.

So, 7.1875 *223.5=1,602.8125 +3.59375=1,606.40625.

Hmm, which is over 1,600.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, the denominator is 7.1875, so 1600 /7.1875.

Wait, let me compute 1600 ÷7.1875.

Let me compute 7.1875 × 223 =?

7.1875 ×200 =1,437.5

7.1875 ×23= 164.3125 (because 7.1875 ×20=143.75; 7.1875 ×3=21.5625 → 143.75+21.5625=164.3125).

So, 1,437.5 +164.3125=1,601.8125.

So, 7.1875 ×223=1,601.8125.

Which is very close to 1,600. So 7.1875 ×223=1,601.8125.

So, 1,600 ÷7.1875 = approximately 223.5.

Wait, 7.1875 ×223.5 = 7.1875 ×(223 +0.5) =1,601.8125 +3.59375=1,605.40625.

Hmm, but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the formula.

Wait, the formula for q is q = (ΔT) * A / ( (L1/k1) + (L2/k2) )

So, in this case,

q = 1600 * A / (6.25 + 0.9375) =1600 * A /7.1875 = (1600 /7.1875) *A=223.5 *A.

So, q/A=223.5.

But the options are:

A:222.61

B:200

C:180

D:250.

So, the correct answer would be approximately 223.5, which is closest to option A (222.61).

So, the correct answer is A.
</think>

To determine the rate of heat loss per unit area, we use the formula for heat transfer through a composite slab:

\[
q = \frac{\Delta T \cdot A}{\left(\frac{L_1}{k_1}\right) + \left(\frac{L_2}{k_2}\right)}
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta T = T_{\text{in}} - T_{\text{out}} = 1800 - 200 = 1600 \, \text{°R} \),
- \( L_1 = 0.5 \, \text{ft} \), \( k_1 = 0.08 \, \text{Btu/(ft·°R)} \),
- \( L_2 = 0.75 \, \text{ft} \), \( k_2 = 0.8 \, \text{Btu/(ft·°R)} \),
- \( A \) is the area in square feet.

First, calculate the terms in the denominator:

\[
\frac{L_1}{k_1} = \frac{0.5}{0.08} = 6.25 \, \text{Btu/(ft²·°R)},
\]
\[
\frac{L_2}{k_2} = \frac{0.75}{0.8} = 0.9375 \, \text{Btu/(ft²·°R)}.
\]

Sum the terms:

\[
\frac{L_1}{k_1} + \frac{L_2}{k_2} = 6.25 + 0.9375 = 7.1875 \, \text{Btu/(ft²·°R)}.
\]

Now, calculate the heat transfer per unit area:

\[
q/A = \frac{\Delta T}{\left(\frac{L_1}{k_1} + \frac{L_2}{k_2}\right)} = \frac{1600}{7.1875} \approx 223.5 \, \text{Btu/(ft²·°R)}.
\]

Since the question asks for the rate of heat loss per unit area, the closest answer is:

**ANSWER: 222.61 Btu/(ft²·°R)**
