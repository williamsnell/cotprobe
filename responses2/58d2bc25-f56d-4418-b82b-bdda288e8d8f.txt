Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about history. The question is about how the United States acquired the Oregon Territory. The options are A through J, each describing different ways the U.S. could have taken the territory.

First, I need to recall what I know about the Oregon Act. I remember that the U.S. bought Oregon from Native Americans. But wait, let's think about the timeline and the specific events.

I think the key event was the Oregon Purchase. The Oregon Act was a post-Revolutionary era law that granted the U.S. the territory to the Native American people. The U.S. settlers were the ones who first arrived, so option D says "U.S. settlers were the first to arrive and claimed it." That makes sense because the U.S. was the first to settle in Oregon.

Option A suggests the U.S. was annexed after a revolt by settlers living there. I don't think that's right because the U.S. was the ones who had the rights to the territory. They took it after it was recognized as a free territory, not because of a revolt.

Option B says the U.S. bought it from Native Americans. That's correct, but the question is about the means, not the reason. So the reason is more about the cause of the U.S. gaining the territory.

C: The territory was divided between the U.S. and Canada after a vote. I don't recall that being a primary way the U.S. acquired it. It's more about how the territory was structured after the U.S. bought it.

D: U.S. settlers were the first to arrive. That's definitely the case. The U.S. had control over the area, and settlers came first, then the U.S. took over.

E: U.S. acquired it through a war. I'm not certain about this. I don't remember a specific war that led to the Oregon Purchase. The U.S. bought it through the land grant, not a war.

F: U.S. won from Mexico in a war. I think the U.S. didn't take it from Mexico. There was a acquisition from Mexico, but that's the Louisiana Purchase, not the Oregon one.

G: U.S. inherited it from Spain as part of the Louisiana Purchase. No, the Louisiana Purchase was from France, not Spain. The U.S. took it from Spain in 1807, but that's the other purchase, not Oregon.

H: Great Britain ceded it to the U.S. as part of a treaty. That's the Great Britain ceding the present-day territory, but the U.S. didn't take it from Great Britain. That's a different event, maybe from a later period.

I: U.S. got it in a postwar treaty with France. I'm not sure about this. I think the U.S. might have gotten some from France, but the actual purchase of Oregon was a separate event from the U.S. acquiring it from Native Americans.

J: U.S. got it from Russia. That's not correct. The purchase of Oregon came from Native Americans, not Russia.

So the correct answer is D because it's the primary reason the U.S. acquired the territory. The U.S. settlers were the first to arrive, and they took the land after it was recognized as a free territory.
