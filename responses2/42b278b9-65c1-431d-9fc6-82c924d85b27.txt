Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is asking for the value of this expression raised to the 30th power. The expression is (1 + cos(2x) + i*sin(2x)) divided by (1 + cos(2x) - i*sin(2x)), and x is π/60. The options are given from A to J, with varying numerical values.

Hmm, I remember that expressions with complex numbers often involve using Euler's formula, which relates complex exponentials to trigonometric functions. Euler's formula says that e^(iθ) = cosθ + i*sinθ. Maybe I can rewrite both the numerator and the denominator using this formula.

Let me start by substituting x = π/60 into 2x. That would make 2x = π/30. So, cos(2x) is cos(π/30), and sin(2x) is sin(π/30).

So the numerator becomes 1 + cos(π/30) + i*sin(π/30), and the denominator is 1 + cos(π/30) - i*sin(π/30).

Wait a second, I think I can write these in terms of Euler's formula. The numerator is (1 + cosθ + i sinθ) where θ is π/30. Similarly, the denominator is (1 + cosθ - i sinθ). Wait, I think there's a better way to express this.

Wait, I remember that 1 + cosθ can be expressed using the double-angle identity. Oh right! Because 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2). And sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So let me apply that.

So, substituting θ = π/30, 1 + cos(π/30) = 2 cos²(π/60). And sin(π/30) is 2 sin(π/60) cos(π/60).

So, the numerator becomes 2 cos²(π/60) + i * 2 sin(π/60) cos(π/60). Similarly, the denominator is 2 cos²(π/60) - i * 2 sin(π/60) cos(π/60).

Hmm, can I factor out 2 cos(π/60) from both the numerator and denominator? Let me try:

Numerator: 2 cos(π/60) [cos(π/60) + i sin(π/60)].

Denominator: 2 cos(π/60) [cos(π/60) - i sin(π/60)].

Oh, so when I divide numerator by denominator, the 2 cos(π/60) terms cancel out. That leaves me with [cos(π/60) + i sin(π/60)] divided by [cos(π/60) - i sin(π/60)].

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, right! Because [cosθ + i sinθ] is e^(iθ), and [cosθ - i sinθ] is e^(-iθ). So the numerator is e^(iθ) and the denominator is e^(-iθ), where θ is π/60.

So, the expression becomes e^(iθ) / e^(-iθ) = e^(iθ + iθ) )? Wait, no. Wait, division of exponents when they have same base is to subtract: e^(iθ) / e^(-iθ) = e^(iθ - (-iθ)) ) = e^(i2θ).

Wait, wait. e^(iθ) divided by e^(-iθ) is e^(iθ + iθ)? No, wait, no. Division is e^(iθ) * e^(-iθ) = e^(iθ - iθ) = e^(i 2θ). Wait, no—actually, e^a divided by e^b is e^(a - b). So, e^(iθ) / e^(-iθ) = e^(iθ - (-iθ)) = e^(i2θ).

But wait, I thought θ was π/30, right? Because θ is π/60? Let me double-check. No, earlier substitution: θ was 2x, which was π/30. So θ = π/30. So the exponent would be i*(2θ) when θ=π/30: 2θ is 2*(pi/30) = pi/15. So the expression becomes e^(i pi/15).

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. So the expression inside the brackets was [cosθ + i sinθ] = e^(iθ), right? And the denominator is [cosθ - i sinθ] = e^(-iθ). So, the ratio is e^(iθ) / e^(-iθ) )= e^(iθ + iθ) )? Wait no, it's e^(iθ) * e^(iθ) because 1/(e^(-iθ)) is e^(iθ). So e^(iθ) * e^(iθ) = e^(i 2θ).

But wait, I thought θ was π/30, so 2θ is pi/15. So our entire expression is e^(i pi/15).

Wait, but wait—earlier, the numerator was 1 + cosθ + i sinθ, and denominator 1 + cosθ - i sinθ. So, the ratio is [e^(iθ)] / [e^(-iθ)] = e^(i theta + i theta) )? No, wait, 1/(e^(-i theta)) is e^(i theta). So [e^(i theta) ] * [e^(i theta)] = e^(i 2 theta).

So, e^(i 2 theta) is e^(i (2 * pi/30 )) )= e^(i pi/15).

So the entire expression is e^(i pi/15).

Now, we need to raise this to the 30th power. So (e^(i pi/15))^30 = e^(i 30 * pi/15) )= e^(i 2 pi) = cos(2pi) + i sin(2pi) = 1 + 0i = 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the steps again because the options don't have 1, but option H is 2i, and option I is 1. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me go through this again.

Original expression: (1 + cos(2x) + i sin(2x)) / (1 + cos(2x) - i sin(2x)).

Let me substitute 2x as θ. So θ = 2x = 2*(pi/60) = pi/30. So cos(theta) and sin(theta) are as is.

So numerator: 1 + cos(theta) + i sin(theta).

Denominator: 1 + cos(theta) - i sin(theta).

I can rewrite the numerator as 2 cos^2(theta/2) + i * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), using the identities:

1 + cos(theta) = 2 cos^2(theta/2),

sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So numerator becomes 2 cos(theta/2) [cos(theta/2) + i sin(theta/2)] = 2 cos(theta/2) e^(i theta/2).

Denominator is 2 cos(theta/2) [cos(theta/2) - i sin(theta/2)] = 2 cos(theta/2) e^(-i theta/2).

So when we take the ratio, the 2 cos(theta/2) terms cancel out, leaving e^(i theta/2) / e^(-i theta/2) = e^(i theta/2 + i theta/2) = e^(i theta).

Wait, but theta is pi/30, so e^(i pi/30). Then raising this to the 30th power would be [e^(i pi/30)]^30 = e^(i 30 * pi/30) = e^(i pi) = cos(pi) + i sin(pi) = -1 + 0i = -1.

Wait, but that's not any of the options. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option E is -1.0. So this would suggest that the answer is E.

But wait, earlier I thought about substituting 1 + cos(theta) as 2 cos^2(theta/2), right. So the ratio becomes e^(i theta). Then raising to 30 gives e^(i 30 theta) = e^(i pi) = -1.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let's re-express everything step by step.

Alternative approach: Let me write the numerator and denominator in terms of Euler's formula.

The numerator is 1 + cos(theta) + i sin(theta) = e^(i theta) + 1. Wait, no: 1 + e^(i theta) = e^(i theta/2) [e^(-i theta/2) + e^(i theta/2)] = 2 e^(i theta/2) cos(theta/2).

Similarly, the denominator is 1 + e^(-i theta) = 2 e^(-i theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So the ratio becomes [2 e^(i theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 e^(-i theta/2) cos(theta/2)] = e^(i theta/2) / e^(-i theta/2) )= e^(i theta).

So now, we have the expression e^(i theta), where theta is 2x = pi/30. Then raising this to the 30th power: (e^(i theta))^30 = e^(i 30 theta) = e^(i pi) = cos(pi) + i sin(pi) = -1 + 0i = -1.

But looking back at the options, option E is -1.0.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second: when I initially thought of the numerator and denominator, I thought of 1 + cos(theta) + i sin(theta) as e^(i theta) + 1, but actually, 1 + e^(i theta) is different from 1 + cos(theta) + i sin(theta). Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, my mistake. Because 1 + e^(i theta) = 1 + cos(theta) + i sin(theta), which is the numerator. Similarly, the denominator is 1 + e^(-i theta) = 1 + cos(theta) - i sin(theta). So my previous approach was correct.

So, the expression simplifies to e^(i theta), and when raised to 30, it's e^(i 30 theta) = e^(i pi) = -1.

So the answer should be -1.0, which is option E. But wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation.

Wait, theta is 2x, and x is pi/60. So theta = 2*(pi/60) = pi/30 radians. So 30 * theta = 30*(pi/30) = pi. So e^(i pi) is indeed -1.

So the correct answer is E: -1.0.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps I can use the identity for (a + ib)/(a - ib). Let me see. For any complex number a + ib, (a + ib)/(a - ib) can be written as [ (a + ib)^2 ] / (a^2 + b^2 ), because denominator is (a - ib)(a + ib) = a^2 + b^2.

Wait, let's apply that. Let me denote a = 1 + cos(2x), and b = sin(2x).

So, the expression is (a + i b)/(a - i b) = [ (a + ib)^2 ] / (a^2 + b^2).

Wait, because (a + ib)/(a - ib) = [ (a+ib)^2 ] / (a² + b² ), but wait, actually, (a+ib)/(a-ib) = (a+ib)^2 / (a² + b²) only if the denominator is a^2 + b^2. Wait, no, more accurately, (a + ib)/(a - ib) = [ (a + ib) * (a + ib) ] / (a² + b² ) = (a² - b² + 2iab) / (a² + b²).

Alternatively, another approach is to write the ratio as (a + ib)/(a - ib) = [ (a + ib) ] * [ (a + ib)^* ] / ( |a + ib|^2 ), where * is the complex conjugate. But perhaps that's complicating it more.

Alternatively, since (a + ib)/(a - ib) can be rewritten as e^{iθ} where θ is related to a and b.

But perhaps for this problem, the initial approach was correct. The expression simplifies to e^{i theta} where theta is pi/30, so raising to 30 gives e^{i pi}, which is -1.

So the answer is E.

The problem involves simplifying the expression 

\[
\frac{1 + \cos(2x) + i\sin(2x)}{1 + \cos(2x) - i\sin(2x)}
\]

with \( x = \pi/60 \) and then raising it to the 30th power. 

Using Euler's formula and complex number properties, the numerator and denominator can be expressed in terms of exponentials. After simplification, the expression becomes \( e^{i\pi/30} \) raised to the 30th power, yielding \( e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Thus, the correct answer is \( -1.0 \).
