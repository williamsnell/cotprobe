Question:

A state is the only state that imposes a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely

Options:

A: valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.
B: invalid, because the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, which includes the extraction of resources.
C: valid, because the state has the right to impose taxes on resources, regardless of federal legislation.
D: valid, because Congress does not have the power to regulate state taxation.
E: valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.
F: invalid, because Congress has the power to regulate all forms of energy production.
G: invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.
H: invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.
I: valid, because the state has the right to tax resources found within its borders.
J: invalid, because the state cannot tax a resource that is vital to the national economy.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about tax laws and state vs federal powers. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about pitchblende, which is a black mineral containing uranium and some other elements. The key points are that pitchblende is only mined in one state, and the federal government has just passed a law that prevents them from taxing its extraction. I remember that tax laws can be tricky, especially when it comes to state vs. federal authority.

The question is asking what the state's tax on pitchblende would be validly under the Constitution and federal law. The options go from A to J, each with different possibilities.

First, I need to recall the U.S. Constitution, specifically section 5, which deals with interstate commerce. Section 5 allows the government to regulate interstate commerce with a tax or fee if it's necessary to maintain a competitive market. But this can't be done without the consent of both the states and the federal government.

So, the federal law here is about not taxing the extraction of pitchblende. Pitchblende is only mined in one state, so the federal law would be targeting a state that's the only one. But does that mean the state's tax is invalid? Or is there a constitutional issue?

I think about the supremacy clause. The supremacy clause in the US Constitution gives Congress the power to interpret the constitution, which includes the Supremacy Clause. This clause says that the government cannot overrule the states' contradictory or conflicting policies. So if the federal law is placing a state on an unequal footing, that might be a problem.

Wait, the federal law is about not taxing a specific state's extraction. So if the federal law is attempting to prevent a tax on pitchblende in that state, but pitchblende is only in that state, maybe the law itself is a state action. But the Supremacy Clause would say that the federal government can't make a law that imposes a tax on a state if that state is the only one mining the resource. Or is it the opposite?

Hold on, the Supremacy Clause would prevent the federal government from overstepping its authority to make a law that would result in an unequal state. So if the federal law is targeting the state that's mining pitchblende, and that state's resource is vital to the national economy, then the Supremacy Clause might come into play. The state's own laws can't be made to favor another state unless it's done in a way that's recognized as a violation.

In this case, the federal law is about not imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Since pitchblende is only found in one state, and that state's extraction tax would be the only one, the state's own regulations might be subject to the Supremacy Clause. So the federal law might be valid if it's necessary to prevent an unequal tax, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Looking at the options:

Option E says it's valid because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on unequal footing. That sounds right because the Supremacy Clause (fifth Supp.) says the government can't overrule the states' contradictory policies. So the federal law is essentially targeting the state in a way that's conflicting with the Supremacy Clause, so it's invalid.

Option H also mentions the Supremacy Clause, but it's a bit different. It says Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that's harmful. That's more about general welfare, not specifically state taxation. So H might not apply here.

Option D says it's valid because Congress can't regulate state taxation. But that's not correct because the Supremacy Clause allows the federal government to impose taxes on states that are necessary for a competitive market, but the Supremacy Clause also allows the federal government to impose taxes on specific states only if it's necessary for the nation's interests.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. The Supremacy Clause doesn't prevent states from taxing, but it does allow the federal government to regulate interstate commerce. So if the federal law is targeting a specific state, but it's necessary for a competitive market, that's okay. But if the law is making a state's tax higher than another state's, that would be a violation of the Supremacy Clause.

So back to the question: the federal law is about not imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Since it's only in one state, that state's tax would be the only one. But the Supremacy Clause says that the federal government can't make a law that would result in an unequal tax. So if the federal law is imposed on a state, it's an unconstitutional attempt to make that state's tax higher than another's. So the law would be invalid.

Looking at the options, option E says it's valid because Congress can't enact a law to place one state on unequal footing. That seems correct. So the state's tax is invalid because the federal law is in conflict with the Supremacy Clause.

Option I says the state has the right to tax resources, but that's not the case. The Supremacy Clause doesn't prevent states from taxing, only the federal government can't impose taxes on states without their consent.

So the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around whether a federal law imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende is valid, given that pitchblende is only mined in one state. Pitchblende's tax imposes a state-based regime, which risks violating constitutional principles like the Supremacy Clause and the Supremacy Clause Act.

Key points:
1. **Supremacy Clause**: The Fifth Supp. (Constitutional Law Supremacy) prevents the federal government from overstepping its authority to make laws that would result in unequal states. If the federal law targets a state, it would be a violation.
2. **State Taxation**: While the Supremacy Clause doesn't prevent states from taxing, it does prevent the federal government from creating laws that favor one state over another without the states' consent.
3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **E**: Correct. The Supremacy Clause prevents the federal government from making a law that places a state on unequal footing, making the law invalid.
   - **H**: Incorrect. The Supremacy Clause applies to state taxation, not general welfare legislation.
   - **D**: Incorrect. Congress has the power to regulate state taxation, but the Supremacy Clause doesn't prevent it.
   - **E** is the only option that aligns with the Supremacy Clause and constitutional principles.
