Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evolutionary biology, and I need to figure it out. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about two modern organisms that are distantly related in an evolutionary sense. I remember that 'distantly related' means they're quite a bit apart in terms of evolutionary history, so they're not closely related to each other.

The options are A to J. Let's go through each possibility one by one. 

Option A: Their mutation rates should be identical. Hmm, mutation rates can vary between organisms. Even though they're distant, maybe some have higher rates. Like, some genes are under stronger selection. I'm not sure if identical is the correct term here. Alternatively, different species might have different mutation rates, but I don't know if that's expected when they're distant.

Option B: Same DNA structure. Well, DNA structure is genetic material. If they're distantly related, they likely have different DNA sequences. Even if they're modern, like humans and a distant species, their DNA would be different. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Identical physical characteristics. That's not necessarily true. Even if they're distant, they could have similar traits due to common ancestry or different environments. No, I don't think it's expected.

Option D: Same number of chromosomes. Well, if they're related, they might share some chromosomes. But for very distant ones, would that be the case? Like, for example, humans and a species that lived way back. They might share a few, but definitely not the same number. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Very different habitats. That's not directly related. Being very different in habitat doesn't mean they're related. Like, two distant species might live in similar or different environments, but their evolutionary relationships don't depend on that.

Option F: Chromosomes similar. Again, similar in structure but not identical. If they're distantly related, they might share some, but not all. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Common ancestor relatively recently. If they're distantly related, their common ancestor must have been quite far back in time, so G is likely incorrect.

Option H: Share fewer homologous structures than closely related species. Let's think. Homologous structures are similar parts of different organisms. If two are very distant, they might not share as many homologous segments. So H is correct.

Option I: Share more homologous structures than closely related species. That would mean they're more closely related. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Evolve at the same rate. No, because if the organisms are very distantly related, their mutations and evolution might be different. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about H and J. Let me think again. Homologous structures are structures that share a common origin, such as arms of a fish or similar parts. If two organisms are closely related, they share many homologous segments. If they're distant, they share fewer. So H is correct, but J says they evolve at the same rate. No, their rates might be different. So J is wrong.

So which option is correct? Let's recap:

The question is asking which statement is expected when two distant organisms are studied.

H is correct because they share fewer homologous structures. I and J are wrong because the rate might not be the same. G is wrong because they share a common ancestor not recently. F and B are incorrect. D is wrong because they have different chromosome numbers. A and C are incorrect because mutation rates can vary, and they wouldn't share identical structures.

So the correct answer is H: they should share fewer homologous structures than two more closely related organisms.

The question asks about the expected characteristics of two modern organisms that are distantly related. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Mutation rates can vary between organisms, so identical rates are not expected.
- **Option B**: Distantly related species would have different DNA sequences due to different genetic makeup.
- **Option C**: Physical characteristics can be similar due to shared ancestry, but they are not identical.
- **Option D**: Having the same number of chromosomes would imply close relatedness, which is not the case for distant species.
- **Option E**: Habitat differences don't determine evolutionary relationships.
- **Option F**: Similar chromosomes exist but are not identical, so sharing them is unlikely.
- **Option G**: A recent common ancestor is expected for distantly related species.
- **Option H**: Correct, as distantly related species share fewer homologous structures.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as closely related species share more homologous structures.
- **Option J**: Evolution rates might differ, so they don't evolve at the same rate.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as a recent common ancestor is expected.

The correct answer is **H**: they should share fewer homologous structures than two more closely related organisms.

Answer: H
