Question:

In theorising the Responsibility to Protect, fundamental questions are raised about the nature of state sovereignty. Regarding this tension between R2P and notions of sovereignty, which of the following is not an accurate statement?

Options:

A: In order to transcend the intervention-vs.-sovereignty debate, R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty.
B: In order to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention, the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty.
C: The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens.
D: According to R2P, sovereignty is only valid if the state can guarantee the safety and rights of its citizens.
E: In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the R2P approach and state sovereignty. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which statement is NOT accurate regarding the tension between R2P and traditional notions of sovereignty. Let me first recall what R2P stands for. If I remember correctly, R2P is the Right to Protect, which is a concept in international law that states that every state has a right to protect its citizens' interests. So, states are responsible for the safety and rights of their citizens.

The options are A, B, C, D, E. I need to find the incorrect statement about R2P and sovereignty.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: "In order to transcend the intervention-vs-sovereignty debate, R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty." Hmm. R2P is an approach that seems to address the issue by requiring states to protect citizens' interests, which might prevent intervention. So, if they're seeking a new definition, that makes sense. I think this is an accurate statement.

Option B: "In order to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention, the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty." Westphalian sovereignty is about the state's independence from foreign interference, right? R2P redefining sovereignty might involve more responsibilities, maybe requiring states to protect citizens, which could mean states have other responsibilities beyond just sovereignty. So, this sounds accurate.

Option C: "The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens." That seems correct. R2P emphasizes that sovereignty isn't just about the state but includes these responsibilities. So, C is accurate.

Option D: "According to R2P, sovereignty is only valid if the state can guarantee the safety and rights of its citizens." Wait, that seems opposite of what I thought. If R2P requires states to protect citizens' interests, then perhaps the idea that sovereignty is only valid under certain conditions is incorrect. R2P might actually require states to have certain responsibilities, which could imply that sovereignty isn't just about the state but also includes its obligations. So, D is probably wrong because it's saying sovereignty is only valid in that case, which might not align with R2P's approach.

Option E: "In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security." R2P requires states to protect citizens, which could mean that their interventions are necessary for international security. So, invoking Westphalian notions might be accurate. Hence, E is a correct statement.

Wait, let me think again. Option D says sovereignty is only valid if it can guarantee the citizens' safety and rights. But according to R2P, states are responsible for their citizens' safety. So, if a state can't guarantee their own citizens' safety (which is their own right, not an external requirement), then sovereignty isn't valid. So, D is incorrect. Because R2P doesn't just require states to have certain responsibilities; it actually requires them to protect citizens' interests, which implies that the state's sovereignty is tied to these responsibilities, not just being valid in certain conditions.

So, the incorrect statement is D. Therefore, the answer is D.

The correct answer is **D**. According to the Right to Protect (R2P) approach, sovereignty is not only about the state but also includes its responsibilities to protect the interests of citizens. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that sovereignty is only valid if the state can guarantee the safety and rights of its citizens, as R2P emphasizes the necessity of protecting citizens' interests, not just their safety. 

Answer: D
