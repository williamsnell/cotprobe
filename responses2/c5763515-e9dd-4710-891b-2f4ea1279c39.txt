Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What is the source of the material that causes meteor showers?

Options:

A: Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.
B: The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along the comet's orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.
C: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of the Oort Cloud, a theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals proposed to surround the Sun.
D: The nuclei of comets disintigrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a central location in the sky.
E: Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.
F: The material causing meteor showers comes from the dust and debris left behind by passing UFOs.
G: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of space junk, or man-made debris in space, as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.
H: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of asteroids within the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in a barrage of tiny, bright meteors.
I: Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through the path of a disintegrated planet, causing a bombardment of various-sized particles.
J: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of the Earth's moon, due to extreme temperature variations, creating debris that enters the Earth's atmosphere.

Okay, so I've got this question about meteor showers and their sources. Hmm, I remember meteor showers are those bright displays of meteors we see on Earth. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think through this.

The question is asking what causes the material that leads to meteor showers. The options are A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I think meteor showers are related to comets and asteroids because I recall that comets have tails and when they pass near Earth, they blow up and cause meteors. But wait, another possibility is asteroids. Oh right, some asteroids, when they disintegrate, might cause meteors. Or maybe it's the Oort Cloud? Wait, the options don't mention the Oort Cloud. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B says comets disintegrate and spread along their orbit. Option C is about the Oort Cloud. But I'm not sure if meteor showers are caused by the Oort Cloud. I think the Oort Cloud is a theory for where comets come from, but I don't know if that's directly the cause of meteor showers. So maybe B is more likely.

Wait, but meteor showers are caused by the nuclei of comets, right? Because when comets pass through our solar system, they break up and leave behind a trail of debris. So if the nuclei spread out along the comet's orbit, then when Earth passes through that, it gets hit by the debris.

Looking at the options, option B says the nuclei disintegrate and spread out along the comet's path. That sounds right. So option B would be the answer.

But wait, let me check the other options. Option E talks about near-Earth asteroids. I think meteor showers are more about comets than asteroids. Or is it both? Some meteor showers could come from asteroids, but the primary cause is comets. Because comets have tails, which are made of material that can be observed from Earth.

So option B says the nuclei of comets disintegrate and spread out. That makes sense. So I think the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B: The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet, it is bombarded by sand-sized particles, causing a meteor shower. This is the primary source of the material that leads to meteor showers.

Answer: B
