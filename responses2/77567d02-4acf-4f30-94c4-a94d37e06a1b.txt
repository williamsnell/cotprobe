Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding Kb and pKb for the acetate ion, CH3COO^- . Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Wait, acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, right? And acetic acid has an ionization constant Ka, which is given as 1.75 × 10^-5. Oh wait, but wait, the question says K_a is for acetic acid. So the acetate ion is the conjugate base, so Kb would be for the base.

I remember that for a conjugate base, the Kb can be found using Kw and the Ka of the acid. Oh right, because Kw is Kw = Ka * Kb. So Kb = Kw / Ka.

Wait, but wait a second. No, wait: for a weak acid HA ↔ H+ + A^-, the Ka is [H+][A^-]/[HA]. The conjugate base A^- would have a Kb of [OH-][HA]/[A^-], so Kb = Kw / Ka. Oh, correct.

So given that, Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1.00e-14. Ka is 1.75e-5.

So Kb = (1.00e-14) / (1.75e-5). Let me calculate that. 1e-14 divided by 1e-5 is 1e-9. So 1.75e-5 is slightly larger than 1e-5, so the denominator is bigger, making Kb smaller. 

Let me compute it more accurately. 1e-14 divided by 1.75e-5 is equal to (1 / 1.75) * 1e-9. 1/1.75 is approximately 0.5714285... So 0.5714285e-9, which is 5.714285e-10. So approximately 5.71e-10.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it step by step.

Kb = (1.00e-14) / (1.75e-5) = (1 / 1.75) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) = (0.57142857) * 1e-9. So 0.57142857e-9 is 5.7142857e-10. So Kb is approximately 5.71e-10.

But looking at the options, let's see which ones match. The Kb options are:

A: 5.71e-9 → that's bigger than our calculation.

B: 5.71e-10 → that matches our calculation.

C: 5.71e-11 → no.

So option B is the Kb value.

Next is pKb, which is the negative logarithm of Kb. pKb = -log10(Kb). So Kb is 5.71e-10. Let's calculate the log.

Log(5.71e-10) = log(5.71) + log(1e-10) = 0.7569 -10 = -9.2431. So the negative of that is 9.2431. So pKb is approximately 9.24.

Looking at the options, Option B is pKb =9.244, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, Kb is 5.71e-10 → log(5.71e-10) is log(5.71) + log(1e-10) → yes, that's correct. Or wait, wait a second. Wait, wait: Kb is 5.71e-10. So the pKb is -log(5.71e-10).

Wait, no. Wait, pKb is defined as -log(Kb). So:

log(Kb) = log(5.71e-10) = log(5.71) + log(1e-10) = 0.7569 -10 = -9.2431.

So pKb is -(-9.2431) = 9.2431 → approximately 9.244, which aligns with option B.

Let me check the other options quickly.

Option A: Kb 5.71e-9 → pKb would be around 8.24 (since log(5.71e-9)= -8.24), so pKb would be 8.24, which is option A's pKb. But our Kb is 5.71e-10, so A is wrong.

Option B: Kb 5.71e-10, pKb 9.244 → correct.

Other options: C: Kb is 5.71e-11 → that's even smaller Kb, so pKb would be higher. D has Kb as 1e-7 → much larger. Others are either wrong Kb or incorrect pKb.

Wait, looking at the given options, option B is Kb=5.71e-10 and pKb=9.244. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait: the options are given as:

A: Kb=5.71e-9, pKb=8.244 → correct pKb but wrong Kb.

B: Kb=5.71e-10, pKb=9.244 → correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get Kb correctly? Because sometimes I get confused between the two, but no, I think I did it right.

Wait, another thought: the acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. Acetic acid's Ka is 1.75e-5, so Kb for acetate is Kw/(Ka) = 1e-14 / 1.75e-5 = approx 5.71e-10. Yes, so that's correct.

So the correct option is B.

To determine \( K_b \) and \( pK_b \) for the acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)), we use the relationship between \( K_b \), \( K_a \), and the ion constant \( K_w \). For a weak acid \( \text{HA} \), the conjugate base \( \text{A}^- \) has \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \). Given \( K_a = 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \) and \( K_w = 1.00 \times 10^{-14} \), we calculate:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-14}}{1.75 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.71 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Next, \( pK_b \) is calculated as \( -\log_{10}(K_b) \). Substituting \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10} \):

\[
\log_{10}(5.71 \times 10^{-10}) = \log_{10}(5.71) + \log_{10}(10^{-10}) = 0.7569 - 10 = -9.2431.
\]

Thus:

\[
pK_b = -(-9.2431) = 9.2431 \approx 9.244.
\]

Now, comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-9} \), \( pK_b = 8.244 \) → Incorrect, as \( K_b \) is too large and \( pK_b \) is too small.
- **Option B**: \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10} \), \( pK_b = 9.244 \) → Correct, matches the calculated values.
- **Option C**: \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-11} \), \( pK_b = 10.244 \) → Incorrect, as \( K_b \) is too small and \( pK_b \) is too large.
- **Option D**: \( K_b = 9.244 \), \( pK_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10} \) → Incorrect, as \( pK_b \) is too small.
- **Option E**: \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10} \), \( pK_b = 14 - \log_{10}(5.71 \times 10^{-10}) \) → Incorrect, as \( pK_b \) is calculated incorrectly.
- **Options F, G, H, I, J**: These are incorrect as they do not match the calculated values of \( K_b \) and \( pK_b \).

The correct answer is **Option B**.
