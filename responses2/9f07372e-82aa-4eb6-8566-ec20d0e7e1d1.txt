Okay, so I have this question about a bond's price, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question says: What is the price of a five-year bond (face value $100) that pays no coupons, if its yield is 4%?

The options are A to J, with various dollar amounts. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, bonds that pay no coupons are called zero-coupon bonds. They don't have interest payments like the others. So their price is just the present value of their face value, right? Because there's no income from coupon payments. So the price would be calculated by discounting the face value at the given yield over the bond's term.

The formula for the price of a zero-coupon bond is: Price = Face Value / (1 + Yield)^Years_to_maturity.

Wait, but the yield is given as 4%, which is 0.04 as a decimal. The bond is five years long, so the denominator would be (1 + 0.04)^5. Let me calculate that.

Wait, let me think about it step by step. So, 1.04 raised to the 5th power. Let's compute it:

1.04^5. Let me approximate. I know that 1.04^4 is about 1.1695 because 1.04^2 is 1.0816, squared again is about 1.1699. So 1.04^5 would be 1.04 * 1.1699 ≈ 1.1793.

So the denominator is approximately 1.1793. Then the price is $100 divided by 1.1793, which is roughly $84.94. That's close to $85. Looking at the options, J is $85. So the price should be approximately $85.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Oh, right, the formula is correct because the yield is the annual yield. So yes, I think I did it right. So the answer should be J: $85.

The price of a zero-coupon bond is the present value of its face value. Using the formula:

Price = Face Value / (1 + Yield)^Years

With a face value of $100, a 4% yield, and a 5-year maturity, the calculation is:

(1.04)^5 ≈ 1.2167 → Wait, wait, earlier I thought 1.04^5 is approximately 1.2167. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, no. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no, let me correct that. The correct calculation for (1.04)^5 is:

1.04^1 = 1.04  
1.04^2 = 1.0816  
1.04^3 = 1.1249  
1.04^4 = 1.1707  
1.04^5 = 1.1799

So, the denominator is approximately 1.1799. The price is $100 / 1.1799 ≈ $84.94, which is closest to $85. Therefore, the correct answer is J: $85.

Answer: J
