Okay, so I've got this double integral problem to solve. The function is f(x,y) = x*y^3*exp(x² + y²), and the region I is [0,1]x[0,1]. I'm supposed to find the numeric value of this integral. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, double integrals can sometimes be tricky, but since the function is a product of functions each depending on x and y separately, maybe I can separate the integral into two single integrals. That might make things easier.

So, let's write the double integral as the product of two integrals: one with respect to x and the other with respect to y. Since the integrand factors into x and y^3*exp(x² + y²), and exp(x² + y²) can be written as exp(x²) * exp(y²), right? So that's x multiplied by y^3 multiplied by exp(x²) multiplied by exp(y²).

So the double integral becomes the product of two integrals: integral from 0 to 1 of x*exp(x²) dx multiplied by integral from 0 to 1 of y^3*exp(y²) dy.

Wait, that's a good point. Because the exponential terms can be separated, so each variable integral can be handled independently. Let's tackle each integral one by one.

Let me start with the integral over x:

∫₀¹ x * e^{x²} dx.

Hmm, substitution might work here. Let u = x². Then du/dx = 2x, so (1/2) du = x dx. So the integral becomes:

(1/2) ∫ e^u du from u=0 to u=1²=1.

That's (1/2) [e^1 - e^0] = (1/2)(e - 1). 

Wait, let me double-check that substitution. If u = x², then when x=0, u=0; x=1, u=1. So yes, substitution seems correct.

Now, moving on to the integral over y:

∫₀¹ y^3 * e^{y²} dy.

Again, substitution. Let u = y², so du = 2y dy. Hmm, but the integrand is y^3, so that's y^2 * y. Since u = y², y^2 = u, and y dy = (1/2) du. So wait, let's see:

∫ y^3 e^{y²} dy = ∫ y² * y e^{y²} dy.

Let u = y² => du = 2y dy => (1/2) du = y dy.

So substituting, it becomes:

∫ u * e^u * (1/2) du = (1/2) ∫ u e^u du.

That integral can be solved by integration by parts. Let me set:

Let v = u => dv = du.

dw = e^u du => w = e^u.

Integration by parts formula is ∫ v dw = v w - ∫ w dv.

So, the integral becomes:

(1/2) [ u e^u - ∫ e^u du ].

Which is (1/2) [ u e^u - e^u ] + C.

Substituting back u = y²:

(1/2) [ y² e^{y²} - e^{y²} ] + C.

Now, evaluating from 0 to 1:

At y=1: (1/2) [ (1)^2 e^{1} - e^{1} ] = (1/2)(e - e) ) = 0.

At y=0: (1/2) [ 0^2 e^0 - e^0 ] = (1/2)(0 - 1) = -1/2.

Wait, so the integral from 0 to 1 is [0 - (-1/2)] = 1/2.

Wait a second, that's not correct. Let me compute it again. Because when y=1, u=1, so (1/2)(1 * e^{1} - e^{1}) = 0. At y=0, u=0: (1/2)(0 * 1 -1) = (1/2)(-1) = -1/2. So the definite integral is 0 - (-1/2) = 1/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So the integral over y is 1/2.

Wait, but let me check that calculation again. When y=0, the expression is (1/2)( (0)^2 e^{0} - e^{0} ) = (1/2)(0 -1) = -1/2. So when evaluating from 0 to 1, it's 0 - (-1/2) = 1/2.

Wait, that seems correct.

So now, the two integrals are:

Integral over x: (1/2)(e -1).

Integral over y: 1/2.

So the double integral is the product of these two: (1/2)(e -1) * (1/2) = (e-1)/4.

Wait, wait, because (1/2) * (1/2) is 1/4. So (e -1) * (1/4) is (e-1)/4.

e is approximately 2.71828. So e-1 is about 1.71828. Divided by 4 gives approximately 0.42957.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.4295. So I think that's the answer.

The integral is separable into two single integrals, which are evaluated using substitution and integration by parts. The result for the double integral is approximately 0.4295.
