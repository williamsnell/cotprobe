Okay, so George put $500 into an account that earns 8% interest, compounded quarterly. He's leaving it for five years, and I need to find out how much he'll have. Hmm, I remember that compound interest formula is involved here. Let me think about the formula: it's A equals P times (1 plus r divided by n) raised to the power of nt. Right, where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.

So, let's plug in the numbers. P is $500. The annual rate r is 8%, which is 0.08 in decimal. It's compounded quarterly, so n is 4. The time t is 5 years. 

Putting it all together: A = 500 * (1 + 0.08/4)^(4*5). Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.08 divided by 4 is 0.02. So that part becomes 1.02.

Next, 4 times 5 is 20. So the exponent is 20. Now, I need to compute 1.02 raised to the 20th power. I'm not exactly sure off the top of my head what that equals, but I think I can estimate it or use a calculator. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use the formula step by step. Let's see, 1.02^20. Let me compute that. I'll start with 1.02 squared, which is 1.0404. Then, 1.0404 squared is about 1.0824. Hmm, but that's for 4 quarters squared, which is a year. Wait, but 20 is 5 years, which is 4 * 5 = 20.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 1.02^20 by breaking it down. Let's think logarithmically, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or some approximation, but I'm not sure that's the best approach here.

Wait, another approach is to compute 1.02^20 step by step for each quarter. But that would take a while. Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest and remember that 1.02^20 is approximately 1.4859. Wait, that's a number I've seen before. Alternatively, I remember that e^(0.08*5) is about 1.4859, but is that the same as (1.02)^20? Let me check.

Wait, wait. The formula (1 + r/n)^(nt) should be the same as e^(rt) when n is large. But in this case, n is 4, so the approximation might not be exact. So maybe I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, let me think differently. I can compute 1.02^20 by using the formula (1.02^4)^5. Because 4 times 5 is 20. So first compute 1.02^4, and then take that result to the 5th power.

So, 1.02^4: let's compute that. 1.02^2 is 1.0404, as I thought earlier. Then, 1.0404 squared is 1.082432. So, 1.02^4 is approximately 1.082432.

Now, raising that to the 5th power: (1.082432)^5. Hmm, that's a bit tricky without a calculator, but I can approximate it. Alternatively, use logarithms or some exponent rules, but perhaps it's easier to compute this step by step.

Alternatively, I can remember that 1.082432 squared is about 1.171659, and then multiplied by 1.082432 again (since 5 is 2.5 times 2, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of 1.082432^5.

Wait, let me try that. Let's compute 1.082432^2 first. 1.082432 * 1.082432 → I'll compute it as 1.082432 *1.08 = approx 1.1698, but more accurately:

1.082432 * 1.082432:

First, 1 * 1 = 1.0000.

1 * 0.082432 = 0.082432

0.082432 * 1 = 0.082432

0.082432 * 0.082432 ≈ 0.006796.

Adding them together: 1.0000 + 0.082432 + 0.082432 + 0.006796 → approximately 1.17166.

Now, multiplying 1.17166 by 1.082432 again for the next power:

1.17166 * 1.082432 ≈ 1.17166 * 1 = 1.17166, 1.17166 * 0.08 = 0.09373, 1.17166 *0.002432 ≈ 0.00285. Adding these roughly: 1.17166 + 0.09373 = 1.26539, plus 0.00285 is about 1.26824. So that's 1.082432^3.

Wait, but wait, we're at 1.082432^5. Let me try to compute this step by step:

1.082432^1 = 1.082432

^2 = (1.082432)^2≈1.171659

^3 = 1.171659 * 1.082432 ≈ 1.26825

^4 = 1.26825 * 1.082432 → I'll compute 1.26825 * 1 = 1.26825, 1.26825 * 0.08 = 0.10146, 1.26825 *0.002432 ≈ 0.00308. So adding: 1.26825 + 0.10146 = 1.36971, plus 0.00308 gives about 1.37279.

^5 = 1.37279 * 1.082432. Let's compute this:

1.37279 *1 = 1.37279

1.37279 *0.08 = 0.109823

1.37279 *0.002432 ≈ 0.003344. 

Adding these together: 1.37279 + 0.109823 = 1.482613, plus 0.003344 gives approximately 1.485957.

So, (1.02)^20 is approximately 1.485957. 

Now, multiply that by the principal amount, which is $500. 

So, 500 * 1.485957 = ?

Let me compute 500 times 1.485957. 

1.485957 × 500 = ?

Well, 1.485957 × 100 = 148.5957, so 148.5957 ×5 = 742.9785.

So the amount is approximately $742.98. Looking at the options, option I is $742.97, which matches that. 

So the correct answer should be option I: $742.97.
</think>

The correct answer is calculated using the compound interest formula:

A = P × (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- P = $500
- r = 8% = 0.08
- n = 4 (compounded quarterly)
- t = 5 years

So, A = 500 × (1 + 0.08/4)^(4×5) = 500 × (1.02)^20 ≈ 500 × 1.485957 ≈ $742.98.

The answer is I: $742.97.
