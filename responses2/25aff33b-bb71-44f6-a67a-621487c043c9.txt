Question:

Doug Dogman had a domesticated golden retriever named Rover. Rover was a good, friendly dog who loved to run and chase cars but had never hurt anyone. One dark evening before the street lights turned on, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog. As she swerved, Ginny hit a parked car and suffered a head injury. If Ginny brings suit against Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory, the court will likely find for

Options:

A: Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.
B: Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.
C: Ginny, because Rover was not on a leash and was not supervised.
D: Doug, because Ginny was responsible for maintaining control of her vehicle.
E: Ginny, because Rover was chasing cars, a potentially dangerous activity.
F: Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.
G: Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.
H: Doug, because Rover was not known to be a dangerous dog.
I: Doug, because Ginny was negligent in hitting a parked car.
J: Ginny, because Doug was not present when the incident occurred.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this law question about strict liability. The question is about whether Ginny can sue Doug because of a negligence claim. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: Doug has a golden retriever named Rover. Rover is a friendly dog who likes chasing cars and running. The key point is that Rover was not known to be dangerous. So the question is about whether a negligence claim would succeed under a strict liability rule.

Strict liability rules typically apply to certain activities where the defendant's own actions are so dangerous that they are inherently dangerous, regardless of the defendant's negligence. So, for example, if a person was driving on a highway and hit a car, that's strict liability because the act of driving is inherently dangerous.

In this case, Ginny hit a parked car because she swerved without properly maintaining control. Now, the question is whether the act of hitting a parked car is inherently dangerous. The key here is that Rover was a good dog and wasn't known to be dangerous. So the issue is about whether the act of hitting the parked car falls under a strict liability claim based on Rover's behavior.

The options are from A to J. Let's go through each.

Option A: Doug unless a statute bans dogs on public streets. Well, that's about whether a statute exists, but the question doesn't mention any such statute. So this option doesn't directly relate to whether Ginny can sue.

Option B: Doug because the retriever is domesticated. Wait, domesticated animals are not inherently dangerous, so this doesn't seem relevant. If the cause was domesticated, strict liability wouldn't apply because the cause is the animal, not the dog's behavior. So this might not be the right answer.

Option C: Ginny because Rover wasn't on leash and wasn't supervised. That's about negligence or necessity. If Rover wasn't on a leash, she might have been negligent, but under strict liability, it's about the inherent danger, not the dog's negligence.

Option D: Doug because Ginny was responsible for control. Again, this is negligence or necessity. The question is about strict liability, so this option isn't about it.

Option E: Ginny because Rover was chasing carsâ€”dangerous activity. I remember that in strict liability, the activity itself is the key, not the individual's actions. So if someone was driving and hit a car, it's strict. But here, Ginny is hitting a parked car because she swerved. The activity here is hitting a parked car, which is a different scenario.

Option F: Ginny because Doug's dog was a cause. This is about causation. Even if the cause is a dangerous activity, the question is about whether the defendant's negligence is enough. But the question is about strict liability, not causation.

Option G: Doug because Rover wasn't dangerous. This seems relevant. The key is whether the act itself (hitting the parked car) falls under a strict liability claim. The fact that Rover was a good dog doesn't mean it's not dangerous in any circumstances. So if the act of hitting the car is dangerous, even if the dog isn't inherently dangerous, the actions taken by the person are.

Option H: Doug because Rover wasn't known to be dangerous. This also seems relevant. The question is whether the act of hitting a parked car is dangerous enough to be covered by strict liability. Even if the dog wasn't dangerous, if the act is dangerous, it applies.

Option I: Doug because Ginny was negligent. That's about negligence, not strict liability. So this is incorrect because it's not about the defendant's negligence.

Option J: Ginny because Doug wasn't present. This is about responsibility, not negligence. So not relevant here.

Now, the crux of the question is whether the act of hitting the parked car is strictly dangerous. The activity itself is dangerous, so regardless of Rover's behavior, hitting a parked car would be covered under strict liability. But wait, the cause might not be a dangerous activity, but here the activity is hitting a parked car.

Wait, actually, in the question, the act is hitting a parked car because of a swerve. So the activity is hitting a parked car. Is that dangerous? Yes, because when you hit a parked car, you collide and get hurt. So if the activity is dangerous, then it's a strict liability claim.

But wait, the fact that Rover was a good dog and not dangerous doesn't preclude it from being a cause. The question isn't about whether the dog's behavior is dangerous, but whether the act (hitting the car) is. So the activity itself is dangerous, so under strict liability, the person is liable regardless of the dog's own behavior.

So the correct reasoning is that the act itself (hitting the car) is dangerous, so the claim is strict liability. Therefore, the court would likely find for Doug, unless statute bars it. So the answer should be A or G.

Wait, but option G says that because Rover wasn't known to be dangerous, Doug is likely to be liable under strict liability. Option F says because Doug's dog was a cause, but that's about causation, which isn't what the question is asking.

So the right answer is option A: because the statute is not in play, the court will find Doug. Alternatively, option G says because Rover wasn't dangerous, so it applies.

Wait, but G is about the cause being a danger. So if the cause is a dangerous activity, the person is liable under strict liability. The question is about whether the cause (hitting a car) is dangerous or not. The fact that the dog (Rover) is not dangerous doesn't affect the activity's danger.

Wait, no. The activity is dangerous because when you hit a parked car, it's a serious accident. So the cause is dangerous, so the action is strictly negligent.

So the question is, does the activity hit a parked car count as a dangerous act? Yes. So under strict liability, the person is liable regardless of Rover's behavior.

So the correct answer is that the court will find Doug because the activity is dangerous, regardless of Rover's behavior. So the answer is A: unless a statute bars it.

Wait, but option G says because Rover wasn't known to be dangerous. Hmm. Let me re-read the options.

Option A: unless a statute bars it.

Option G: because the cause in fact of her injuries was a dangerous dog.

Wait, that's about whether the cause (hitting the car) is dangerous. So the activity itself is dangerous, making it a strict liability claim.

So the correct reasoning is that the act of hitting a parked car is inherently dangerous, so the claim is strict liability regardless of the dog's behavior.

So the answer would be A or G. Wait, no. Option G is about the cause being a danger, which would be a different question.

Wait, the question is whether the act of hitting a car is a cause. If the cause is a dangerous activity, then yes. But the question's focus is on Rover, who is a good dog, not on the dog's behavior.

Wait, the question is about whether the negligence claim is strict liability or negligence. So the key is whether the act of hitting the car is inherently dangerous. The fact that the dog is known to be a good, friendly one (G) doesn't affect that. So the answer should be that the court will find Doug, unless a statute prohibits it.

So the answer would be A: Doug unless a statute bars it.

Alternatively, option G is about because the cause (hitting a car) is dangerous. So if the cause is dangerous, then it's a strict liability claim. So the answer is A or G.

Wait, the question is about whether Ginny brings a suit against Doug, considering the strict liability theory. So the question is whether the injury was because of negligence or because it's a strict liability claim.

The key here is the activity of hitting the car. If it's a dangerous act, then it's strict liability. The fact that Rover was a good dog is irrelevant to whether the act itself is dangerous.

So the answer is that the court will find for Doug because the act is dangerous. So the answer is A.

Wait, but option G says because the cause was a danger. Let me recheck the options.

Option G: Doug, because the cause in fact of Ginny's injuries was a dangerous dog.

Wait, that's about the cause being a dangerous activity. But the question is whether the act itself is dangerous. The cause is the injury, so the activity is the act of hitting the car.

So the correct reasoning is that the act is dangerous, so the claim is strict liability, leading to Doug's liability. So the answer is A: unless a statute.

Alternatively, if the cause of the injury is a dangerous activity (hitting a car), then it's a strict liability claim.

So the answer is A: Doug unless a statute prohibits it.

Wait, but I'm getting a little tangled. Let me think again.

In strict liability, the defendant's own conduct is not the issue; the act itself must be inherently dangerous. The cause of the injury (hitting a car) is the activity. So if the act is dangerous, then it's strict liability regardless of the dog's behavior.

So the right choice is that the court will find for Doug because the cause is a dangerous activity. Therefore, the answer is A.

Wait, no, option A says "unless a statute." So if a statute exists that prohibits dogs from being on public streets, then option A is correct. But the question doesn't mention any such statute. So the default is that it's strict liability unless a statute bars it.

So the court would likely find for Doug under a strict liability rule, unless a statute exists.

So the correct answer is A: unless a statute bars it.
</think>

The question revolves around whether Ginny can sue Doug under a strict liability theory. Strict liability law applies to acts that are inherently dangerous, such as driving on public roads, regardless of the defendant's negligence. In this case, Ginny hit a parked car, which is a dangerous activity, as it results in serious injury. The fact that Rover was a good dog is irrelevant to the strict liability claim because it pertains to the activity itself, not the dog's behavior.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bars unleashed dogs on public streets.**  
  This is correct because strict liability applies unless a statute prohibits it. Since no such statute is mentioned, the court would likely find for Doug.
  
- **B: Doug, because the retriever is a domesticated animal.**  
  Incorrect. Domesticated animals are not inherently dangerous, so this does not apply.

- **C: Ginny, because Rover was not on a leash and was not supervised.**  
  Incorrect. This relates to negligence or necessity, not strict liability.

- **D: Doug, because Ginny was responsible for maintaining control of her vehicle.**  
  Incorrect. This focuses on negligence, not strict liability.

- **E: Ginny, because Rover was chasing cars, a potentially dangerous activity.**  
  Incorrect. The act of hitting a parked car is the key, not the dog's conduct.

- **F: Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.**  
  Incorrect. Causation is not the focus of strict liability.

- **G: Doug, because the cause in fact of Ginny's injuries was a dangerous dog.**  
  Incorrect. The cause of the injury is the act of hitting a car, not the dog.

- **H: Doug, because Ginny was negligent in hitting a parked car.**  
  Incorrect. Negligence focuses on the defendant's actions, not the activity itself.

- **I: Doug, because Ginny was negligent in hitting a car.**  
  Incorrect. This relates to negligence, not strict liability.

- **J: Ginny, because Doug was not present when the incident occurred.**  
  Incorrect. This focuses on responsibility, not negligence.

### Conclusion:  
The correct answer is **A**, as the act of hitting a car is inherently dangerous, making it a strict liability claim. The fact that Rover is a good dog does not affect this determination.
