Okay, so I need to figure out where the majority of Kurds are from. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, but I'll try to think this through. I know that Kurds are an ethnic group from Turkey, right? They're called the Kurds, and they're a minority, but they're not entirely isolated. Maybe they're part of a larger ethnic group or a different language.

I remember hearing about the Kurds being found in some countries. Like, does anyone mention them being in the Middle East? I think they might be in the Near East or the Middle East. Let me think about the options given. The options are Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Jordan, Turkey, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.

I know that the Kurds are a subset of the Turks and Turks, which are part of the Marmara region in Turkey. So, they're likely in Turkey. But wait, the question is about the majority. Are they the majority of the Kurds or the majority of Turkey? I'm not sure. I think the majority of the Kurds are in the Middle East, but I'm not certain.

Looking at the options, I see that option G is Jordan. Maybe they're in Jordan? Or option I is Syria. I'm a bit confused. I recall that the Kurds are sometimes referred to as "Kurds," and they might be part of Jordan's population. Or perhaps they're in the Middle East, which includes several countries. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the answer is option G: Jordan.
