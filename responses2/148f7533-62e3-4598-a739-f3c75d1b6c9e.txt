Okay, so I have to solve this problem where a record is sold for $3.24, and there's a 35% markup based on the selling price. I need to find the cost. Hmm, let's think step by step.

Wait, what's a markup? I remember it's the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So if the markup is 35% of the selling price, then the selling price includes both the cost and the markup. Oh wait, but sometimes markup can be based on cost. Oh wait, the question says 35% markup based on the selling price. So that's different from the usual cost markup.

Wait, so if it's a markup based on the selling price, then the formula would be Selling Price = Cost + (35% of Selling Price). So that would mean Selling Price = Cost * (1 + 0.35) = Cost * 1.35. Oh, wait, that can't be right because that would make the cost higher than the selling price, which doesn't make sense because the selling price is higher. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas.

Wait, no, actually, when they say markup is based on selling price, that means markup is added on top of the cost. So Selling Price = Cost + Markup. But Markup is 35% of Selling Price. So that would be Selling Price = Cost + 0.35 * Selling Price.

Wait, let's rearrange that. Selling Price - 0.35 * Selling Price = Cost. So 0.65 * Selling Price = Cost. So Cost = 0.65 * Selling Price.

Oh wait, that makes sense because the cost is 65% of the selling price. So if the selling price is $3.24, then the cost is 0.65 times $3.24.

Let me calculate that. 3.24 * 0.65. Let me do the math.

Hmm, 3.24 × 0.65. Let me break it down. 3 × 0.65 is 1.95, and 0.24 × 0.65 is 0.156. So adding those together: 1.95 + 0.156 = 2.106. Oh, so that's approximately $2.11. But wait, looking at the options, option J is $2.11.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because sometimes markup can be calculated as a percentage of the cost, but the question says it's based on the selling price. So if it were markup based on cost, the formula would be Selling Price = Cost + 0.35*Cost = 1.35*Cost. Then Cost = Selling Price / 1.35. Let me see what that gives.

3.24 divided by 1.35. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1.35 times 2 is 2.7, which is less than 3.24. Let's see, 1.35 × 2.4 is 3.24. Because 1.35 × 2 = 2.7, 1.35 × 0.4 is 0.54, so 2.7+0.54=3.24. So the cost would be $2.40. That's an option, E.

Wait, but the question says the markup is 35% based on the selling price. So that would mean that the markup is 0.35 * SP. So SP = Cost + 35% SP → SP - 35%SP = Cost → 65% SP = Cost. So Cost = 0.65 × 3.24 = approx $2.106, which is about $2.11. So option J.

But wait, let me make sure. Another approach: Let me think of the markup as (SP - Cost)/Cost = 35%. So SP = Cost * (1 + 0.35) = 1.35 * Cost. Then Cost = SP / 1.35. So 3.24 /1.35 = 2.40. So cost is $2.40. That matches option E.

Wait, but that's based on markup being on cost. But the question says it's based on the selling price. So that would mean that the correct formula is Cost = 0.65 × SP. So 0.65 ×3.24 is 2.106, which is $2.11. So option J.

So the correct answer should be J, $2.11.

The correct answer is J: $2.11.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Markup:**
   - Markup is the amount added to the cost to arrive at the selling price.
   - The markup can be based on either the cost or the selling price.

2. **Given:**
   - Selling Price (SP) = $3.24
   - Markup percentage = 35% based on SP.

3. **Calculating Cost Based on SP Markup:**
   - The markup is 35% of SP, so SP = Cost + 0.35 × SP.
   - Rearranging: SP - 0.35SP = Cost → 0.65SP = Cost.
   - Cost = 0.65 × SP → Cost = 0.65 × 3.24 = $2.106, which rounds to $2.11.

4. **Alternative Calculation (if markup were based on cost):**
   - SP = Cost × 1.35 → Cost = SP / 1.35 = 3.24 / 1.35 = $2.40.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the markup is based on SP, the cost is $2.11.
