Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about the age at which one can receive full benefits from Social Security. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Social Security offers a reduced benefit after a certain age, but I'm not exactly sure what that age is. I think it's called the "retirement age." Hmm, but wait, I'm not certain. I recall that in the past, the Social Security rules were a bit more flexible. Maybe it's been increasing or decreasing over the years.

I think the original rules were around 62 or 65, but now it's been changing. I remember hearing that in recent years, the retirement age has increased. Let me try to remember the exact numbers. Oh, right! I think it's now 67. So, before, maybe it was 65, but now it's 67. That means people can still receive benefits up until then.

Looking at the options:
A: Has been decreasing – No, because benefits are increasing now.
B: Is 70 – No, that's incorrect.
C: Is 65 – No, because the current age is higher.
D: Has been increasing – Yes, this seems correct.
E: Will never change – No, because it has changed.
F: Is 62 – Probably not, as I think it's higher.
G: Is decided by the individual – No, it's a set age.
H: Is the same age as the retirement age – No, because the retirement age is lower.
I: Is 67 – Yes, this matches.
J: Is 72 – No, that's too high.

Wait, so the options are evaluating whether the age is 67. The question is asking what the age is now. So the correct answers would be either C, D, I, or E. But looking at the options, the answer must be one of the letters. The question is asking which statement is correct about the age. The options are presented as statements, but the correct answer has to be a single letter.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. The options are A through J, each a statement. The question is asking, "The age at which one can receive full benefits from social security." So the correct answer is the letter corresponding to the correct age.

Looking back, the correct age is 67. So that would be option I. But wait, let me check the list.

Wait, looking at the options, I is "Is 67" and E is "Will never change." So E is incorrect because benefits have changed.

So which options are correct? Let me see: the question is about the age. So the correct answer would be either I or E, but E is incorrect.

Wait, the question is asking for the current age. So the correct answer is I, which says "Is 67." So the answer should be option I. But let me make sure I'm not mixing up the options.

Wait, the options are presented as separate choices, each a statement. So the question is, which option correctly states the age. So the correct answer is option I, because the correct age is 67.

The correct answer is I: Is 67.
