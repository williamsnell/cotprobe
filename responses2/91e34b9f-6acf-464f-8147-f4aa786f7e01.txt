D: $7000
E: $5000
F: $500
G: $400
H: 4000
I: $8000
J: $3000

Okay, so I have this accounting question here about amortization. Let me think through it.

The question says Corbet Co. bought a copyright for $20,000. The copyright's legal life is the same as the author's life plus 50 years. Corbet expects to sell the book for five years. I need to find out the amortization expense at the end of the current year.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Amortization is when you allocate the cost of intangible assets over their useful life. So the first thing is to figure out the useful life of the copyright.

The problem says the legal life is author's life +50 years. But wait, I remember that for intangibles, the useful life is often the shorter of the legal life or the estimated useful life. But in this case, the author's life isn't given. Hmm. Wait, maybe that's not the case here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the concept that the amortization period is based on the expected useful life. But the problem states that the expected sale period is five years. Oh, perhaps the useful life is 5 years, or maybe it's the legal life, which is longer than that.

Wait, the problem says Corbet is expecting to sell the book for five years. So perhaps the useful life is five years. Because they expect to use it for five years. But wait, the legal life is the author's life plus 50. So if the expected sale is five years, perhaps the amortization period is five years.

Alternatively, maybe the amortization period is the same as the expected useful life, which is five years. So each year, they would amortize $20k over five years, which is $4,000 per year. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options don't have $4k. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: $0

B: $2000

C: $6000

D: $7000

E: $5000

F: $500

G: $400

H: 4000

I: 8000

J: 3000

Wait, none of these is $4k, which would be 20k /5 = 4k. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the useful life is longer than five years. Because the problem says the legal life is author's life +50. But if the author's life isn't given, maybe the useful life is longer than five years, but the amortization period is the legal life? Or perhaps they are using the expected life.

Alternatively, maybe the amortization period is the estimated useful life. But without knowing the author's life, I can't calculate the legal life exactly. Oh wait, wait, but there's another approach. The amortization expense is calculated based on the useful life. If the useful life is the expected life, which is five years, then each year they would amortize $4,000. But that's not an option. So maybe the useful life is longer.

Wait, perhaps the useful life is the same as the period during which the company expects to use the asset. Since the company is going to sell it in five years, perhaps the useful life is five years. So each year, the amortization expense would be $20k /5 = $4,000. But none of the options match this.

Wait, maybe the problem treats the amortization period as the estimated useful life, which is 50 years or something else. No, because the expected sale is five years. Let me re-read the question.

The question states: "Corbet expects to sell the book for five years." So perhaps the useful life is five years, which is the period during which the company expects to use the copyright. So in that case, amortization expense is $20,000 /5= $4,000 per year. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the amortization is based on the legal life. But the legal life is author's life plus 50. If the expected sale is five years, perhaps the useful life is five years. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the amortization period is based on the legal life, which is longer than five years. But without knowing the author's life, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the amortization period is the shorter of the expected useful life and the legal life. Since the company expects to use it for five years, maybe the amortization period is five years. So, $20,000 /5= $4,000 per year. But that's $4k, which isn't an option. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the amortization period is the same as the period during which the asset is expected to be used. Since the company expects to sell it in five years, the useful life is five years. So annual amortization is 20k/5=4k. But the options don't have 4k. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, looking back, the options given are A to J. Oh, wait, option C is $6000, which is 20k *1.2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the company's amortization is based on the legal life, which is longer than five years, so perhaps the useful life is more than five, but the problem states that they expect to sell in five years. Maybe the useful life is five years, but I must have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the straight-line method. The cost is $20,000. The useful life is the period during which the asset is expected to be used, which is five years. So each year, amortization is 20k /5=4k. But that's not an option. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the amortization is for the period during which the asset is expected to be used, but the legal life is more. So if the legal life is author's life plus 50, but the expected sale is five, maybe the useful life is five. So same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the amortization is for the period until the book is sold, which is five years, so 20k /5=4k. But no option matches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the legal life is longer than five years, but the company uses it for five years. So the amortization is for five years, so 20k/5=4k. Not an option. Oh, wait, the options don't have $4k. So perhaps I'm wrong about the useful life.

Wait, perhaps the useful life is the same as the expected period of use, which is five years. So each year's expense is 4k. But again, none of the options match. Let me check the options againâ€”oh, option E is $5000. That's 20k/4. So perhaps the useful life is four years.

Wait, wait, perhaps the useful life is determined by the period during which the asset is expected to be used, which is five years. So 20k /5=4k. But 4k isn't an option. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me reevaluate.

Problem statement: "Corbet Co. purchased a copyright... legal life equivalent to author's life plus 50 years. Corbet expects to sell the book for five years."

Hmm, perhaps the useful life is five years because the company expects to sell it in five years. So the amortization expense for that year is 20k /5=4k. Again, no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is $4k, but this isn't an option. Wait, looking back, the options are A to J, with H being 4,000.

Wait, no, option H is $4000. So, the correct answer would be H. But why? Because 20k divided by 5 is 4k.

But I'm confused because the options don't have $4,000. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it again: 20,000 divided by 5 is indeed 4,000. So the correct annual amortization expense is $4,000. But looking at the options, H is $4000. So why is option C $6000? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the useful life is the legal life, which is longer than five years, but the company uses it for five years. So the amortization period is five years, but the legal life is longer. For example, author's life plus 50, but the company's useful life is five. In that case, the amortization expense would be based on the useful life, which is five years, so same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the useful life is the same as the period during which the book is expected to be used, which is five years. So the correct answer is 4k, but that's not an option. Wait, looking again, the options don't have 4k. Wait, the options are:

A: 0

B: 2000

C: 6000

D: 7000

E: 5000

F:500

G:400

H:4000

I:8000

J:3000

Wait, option H is 4000. So in that case, the correct answer is H. So why am I getting 4k? Because 20k divided by 5 is 4k, which is H.

But wait, maybe I'm misapplying the useful life concept. Let me think again. The useful life is the period during which the asset is expected to be used and generate economic benefits. The problem says Corbet expects to sell the book for five years. So the useful life is five years.

So annual amortization is 20k /5=4,000. But the option H is 4,000.

But wait, another thing to consider: when the asset is to be sold within the useful life, is that considered as the end of the useful life? Or does the company have to amortize until the asset is sold?

Wait, for example, if the asset is expected to be sold in five years, but the useful life is longer than that, do we still amortize for five years? Or, perhaps the amortization is based on the useful life, which is longer than the expected sale period.

But in this problem, the useful life is longer than the expected sale period. So the company is using the asset for five years, but the useful life is longer. So would they still amortize for five years, or for the entire useful life?

I think that amortization is done for the entire useful life, regardless of when it's sold. Because the useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to be used. So if the useful life is, say, 10 years, they'd amortize it over 10 years, even if they sell it early.

Wait, but the problem states that the company expects to sell it in five years. So perhaps the useful life is five years.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of an example. Suppose the asset has a legal life of 10 years, but the useful life is 5 years. The company expects to sell it in year 5. Then, should they have amortized the entire 10 years, or only for five years?

I think the correct approach is to amortize based on the useful life. The useful life is the period during which the asset is expected to be used and generate economic benefits. So if the useful life is five years, then the annual amortization is 20k /5=4k.

But the options don't have 4k. Wait, option H is 4000. So why is that? Because 20k /5=4k. So the answer should be H, 4000.

But wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A: 0

B: 2000

C: 6000

D: 7000

E: 5000

F: 500

G:400

H:4000

I:8000

J:3000

So option H is 4000, which aligns with 20,000 /5=4,000. So that's the correct calculation.

But why isn't option H the correct choice? Because the options don't have 4k. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the useful life is the longer period. Let's think again. The problem says the legal life is equal to the author's life plus 50 years. But without knowing the author's life, I can't calculate the legal life. However, the company expects to sell it in five years. So the useful life is five years because that's when the asset is sold.

So the annual amortization expense is 20k /5=4k, which is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the amortization to be for the period until the asset is sold, which is five years. So 20k /5=4,000. So the correct answer is H.

So the correct answer is H, $4,000. So the options are H:4000.

The question involves determining the amortization expense for a copyright purchased by Corbet Co. The copyright has a legal life equivalent to the author's life plus 50 years, but Corbet expects to sell the book in five years. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method, where the cost of the asset is spread evenly over its useful life.

Key points:
- **Cost of the copyright**: $20,000.
- **Expected sale period**: Five years.
- **Useful life**: The period over which the asset is expected to be used and generate economic benefits. Since Corbet expects to sell the book in five years, the useful life is determined by this period.
- **Amortization expense**: Calculated as the cost of the asset divided by its useful life.

**Calculation**:
\[
\text{Amortization expense} = \frac{\text{Cost of the copyright}}{\text{Useful life}} = \frac{20,000}{5} = 4,000
\]

**Options Analysis**:
- **Option H ($4,000)**: Matches the calculated amortization expense of $4,000.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: $4,000**.

ANSWER: H
