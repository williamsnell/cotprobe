Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the impact of a minimum wage on fast-food workers. Let me think through each option carefully.

So, the question is asking about the likely outcome when the minimum wage is set in the fast-food market. The options are about changes in demand, supply, prices, etc.

First, I remember that minimum wage laws are supposed to increase the minimum wage for workers. This would typically affect the supply and demand for labor. 

When the minimum wage increases, it's like setting a higher price for workers. From my economics classes, I recall that an increase in the minimum wage (which can be seen as a supply-side shock) would lead to a decrease in the quantity of labor supplied. Because it's a legal minimum, some workers might have to work longer hours or leave the labor market if their wages don't keep up with the higher wage. So that's a decrease in supply.

Wait, but what about the demand side? The minimum wage doesn't directly affect the demand for fast-food items. It's more about the wages of the workers. So the demand for fast-food items might stay the same unless other factors like production costs or prices change, which aren't mentioned here.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A decrease in the supply of fast-food workers. That makes sense because higher minimum wage would reduce the number of workers willing to work for that wage.

What about the other options? 

Option A: Decrease in demand. No, because the minimum wage affects supply, not demand.

Option B: Stabilize the market. I don't think so. Minimum wage usually leads to a decrease in supply, not just a stabilization.

Option D: Decrease in prices. Hmm, if supply decreases, prices might increase, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Wait, the question is about production, so the supply of workers affects the supply of the product. If supply decreases, the price might go up, but the question is about the impact on the workers themselves or the items.

Option E: No change. No, because the minimum wage would change the supply.

Option F: Surplus of workers. That would be a situation where more workers are willing to work than are actually employed at that wage. So if the minimum wage is higher, the supply (the number of people willing to work) might decrease. That leads to a surplus, which is F.

Wait, but I thought a minimum wage is just a legal measure; it's not binding if firms can't afford to pay the new wage. But the question is about the effect of the minimum wage on the market. So, even if the wage is higher, it's just a setting—so supply decreases. So the surplus is caused by the minimum wage increasing leading to lower supply.

So which option is correct? Let me re-examine each option.

Wait, the question is about the impact on the market for fast-food workers, not on production costs.

So the supply of workers (the labor force) is affected. As minimum wage increases, more workers are willing to work at a higher wage, but perhaps they have to work more hours or leave the labor force. So the number of workers willing to work decreases. Hence, the supply decreases.

So the correct answer is F: a surplus of fast-food workers.

Wait, but what about the options. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: demand decrease → no.

B: stabilization → no, because supply side.

C: supply decrease → yes, so C is incorrect.

D: prices decrease → probably not. Because supply decreases, demand might stay same, so price would increase. But the question is about what happens to fast-food workers and items. The price of items is determined by supply and demand. But the question is asking about the impact on the workers and items.

Wait, the question is: The last character of the answer must be the letter you have chosen. So the question is about the impact on fast-food workers and items, but the options are A to G. So the options include changes in demand, supply, prices, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options as whether the supply of workers (option C) or surplus (option F) is affected.

So the question is, after setting the minimum wage, what happens.

When the minimum wage increases, the supply of labor decreases because the wage is higher, so fewer workers can be hired. Therefore, the supply of workers decreases, leading to a surplus.

So the correct answer would be F: a surplus of fast-food workers.

Looking at the options again, option F is 'a surplus of fast-food workers.' So the correct answer is F.

The question asks about the impact of a minimum wage on the fast-food workers market. The key point is that a higher minimum wage increases the supply of labor by increasing the wage rate, leading to fewer workers willing to work at that rate. This results in a surplus of fast-food workers.

1. **Option A (Decrease in demand for workers):** Incorrect. A minimum wage affects the supply of labor, not the demand.
2. **Option B (Stabilize the market):** Incorrect. A minimum wage leads to a decrease in supply, not stabilization.
3. **Option C (Decrease in supply of workers):** Incorrect. The minimum wage increases the supply of labor by raising the wage rate, reducing the number of workers willing to work.
4. **Option D (Decrease in prices):** Incorrect. The supply of workers decreases, which could increase the supply of fast-food items, potentially leading to higher prices, but the question focuses on the impact on workers and items.
5. **Option E (No change in the market):** Incorrect. The minimum wage alters the supply of labor, affecting the market.
6. **Option F (Surplus of workers):** Correct. A higher minimum wage decreases the supply of workers, leading to a surplus.
7. **Option G (Increase in demand for workers):** Incorrect. The minimum wage does not directly affect the demand for workers.
8. **Option H (Decrease in demand for items):** Incorrect. The question focuses on the impact on workers, not production costs or prices.
9. **Option I (No change in the market):** Incorrect. The minimum wage affects the supply of workers, changing the market dynamics.
10. **Option J (Increase in demand for items):** Incorrect. The supply of workers decreases, which could increase the supply of fast-food items.

The correct answer is F: a surplus of fast-food workers.

**ANSWER: F**
