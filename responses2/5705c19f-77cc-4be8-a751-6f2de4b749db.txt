Okay, so I've got this question about glucose metabolism, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which statement about glucose metabolism is correct. There are eight options labeled A to H. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, I remember that glycolysis is the first step in cellular metabolism, converting glucose into pyruvate, which is then further processed. So all the options are talking about different aspects of this process.

Option A: The end-product of glycolysis in all cells is glucose. Wait, no, that can't be right. I think the end product is glucose or something else. Let me think. Oh wait, no. In glycolysis, the product is two molecules of pyruvate. Because glucose is broken down into two three-carbon units (like lactate, but not exactly lactate; it's two three-carbon molecules). So the end product is pyruvate. So A is incorrect because the end product isn't glucose. Unless I'm confusing it with some other process.

Option B: Glycolysis doesn't require any enzymes. No, that's not right. Glycolysis is a multi-step process that requires a bunch of enzymes. I remember that glucose is broken down step by step, each step needing an enzyme. So B is wrong.

Option C: In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products. Hmm. Wait, does that mean each product is three carbons? Because I know that after glycolysis, the two products are two molecules of pyruvate, each with three carbons. So yes, each product is three carbons. So C is correct? Or wait, wait. Wait, I'm seeing glycolysis in which glucose is split into two three-carbon molecules. So the statement says 'glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products.' That sounds right. So C could be a correct statement.

Option D: Glucose metabolism only occurs in the presence of oxygen. No, that's incorrect. Metabolism in the sense of glycolysis doesn't require oxygen. But cells need oxygen for other processes like aerobic respiration. So D is wrong. Glycolysis is anaerobic, but cellular respiration (including glycolysis) requires oxygen.

Option E: In glycolysis, glucose is converted into two molecules of fructose. Wait, I thought that's after the steps. Oh, right. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is the product after the steps. Fructose isn't the end product of glycolysis. So E is wrong.

Option F: Glycolysis requires ATP only. No, because I remember that in glycolysis, some steps require ATP. Like, the first step is phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, which needs ATP. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Glucagon increases the rate of glycolysis. Glucagon is an enzyme that acts on liver to increase glucose uptake. But does it directly affect glycolysis? I think it's more about the body's ability to get glucose into the bloodstream. So G is probably wrong.

Option H: Glycolysis requires NADP+. Wait, in glycolysis, do they use NAD+ or NADP+? Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm. The steps are glycerol-1,3-bisphosphate → 3-phosphoglycerate. The first step is phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, which uses ATP. Then, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, which requires NAD+ as coenzyme. But wait, after that, the next steps (the citric acid cycle) use NADH. So, during glycolysis, is NADP+ used? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, I think the cytoplasmic steps use NADP+ as the electron carrier. Because in the steps:

Glucose → Glucose-6-phosphate (requires ATP)
Glucose-6-phosphate → 3-phosphoglycerate (requires ATP and NADPH?)
Wait, no. The steps are:

Glucose → glucose-6-phosphate. That's a phosphorylation, which uses ATP. Then, glucose-6-phosphate → 3-phosphoglycerate. That step uses NADPH (which is NAD+ reduced, but in the cytoplasm, NADP+ is the carrier). Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. So in glycolysis, the first step uses ATP, the second uses NADPH (which is NAD+ reduced), and the third uses NADP+ as the carrier. So NADP+ is definitely used in the third step. So H is correct?

Wait, but let me think again. The steps are:

1. Glucose + P(two) → glucose-6-P (ATP)
2. Glucose-6-P + P(two) → 3-phospho-glycerate (ATP)
3. 3-phospho-glycerate → 3-PG (with NADP+ as the carrier?)

Wait, no. I think the third step uses NADP+ as the carrier. Let me recall correctly: The third step, G3P to pyruvate, uses NADH as a reducing agent. Wait, no: the steps are:

Glucose → glucose-6-P (requires ATP)
Glucose-6-P → 3-PG (requires NADPH, which is NAD+ reduced, but in the cytoplasm, this is NADP+ as the carrier)
Then, 3-PG → acetyl-CoA (requires NAD+ as a reducing agent, not NADP+)

Wait, I'm getting confused because I'm mixing up the steps. Let me think again. Glycolysis steps:

1. Glucose is phosphorylated to become glucose-6-phosphate (requires ATP).
2. Glucose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated to become 3-phosphoglycerate (requires ATP and NADPH, which is NAD+ reduced and becomes NADP+ in the cell).
3. 3-phosphoglycerate is converted intosuccinate (through the citric acid cycle) and acetyl-CoA. This step uses NADH (reducing agent), not NADP+.

Wait, but during glycolysis, is NADP+ used? Let's think about the steps:

After step 2, the 3-phospho-glycerate is transformed into succinate and acetyl-CoA. The first step (to make succinate) is in the cytoplasm. So the steps are:

After step 2, we have 3-phospho-glycerate. Then, the third step is the conversion to pyruvate. The third step uses NAD+ as a reducing agent, but that's not NADP+.

Wait, I might have confused the roles. The third step (3-phosphoglycerate → succinate) uses NADH (reducing agent), while the second step uses NADP+ (as the carrier for NADPH). So in glycolysis, which uses NADP+ as the carrier for NADPH in the second step, but NADP+ is also the carrier for NADH in the third step. Wait, no, NADH is a reducing agent, and it's used in the steps after, like the steps leading to the citric acid cycle. So perhaps NADP+ is not used in the third step, but only as a carrier in the second step (NADP+).

Wait, I might have to check this. I'm a bit shaky on this. So in glycolysis, NADP+ is used in the third step? Or not?

Wait, let's think about it. The third step is 3-phosphoglycerate to succinate. The reducing agent here is NADH, which is involved in the citric acid cycle.

But in the second step, the 3-phosphoglycerate is being converted to pyruvate. So the second step uses NADPH (which is NAD+ reduced to NADP+). So during step 2, NADP+ is the carrier for NADPH.

In the third step, the reducing agent is NADH, which is not NADP+. So, does NADP+ get used in this step? Or is NADP+ not used there.

Wait, wait no. The third step's reducing agent is NADH, which is not NADP+. So in the third step, NADP+ is not used. Therefore, option H says 'glyc requires NADP+', which is incorrect. So H is wrong.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to think about it.

The steps in glycolysis:

1. Glucose + P2 → glucose-6-P (ATP)
2. Glucose-6-P + P2 → 3-PG (ATP, and uses NADPH, which is NAD+ reduced, but in the cell, becomes NADP+)
3. 3-PG → C3 (succinate) and acetyl-CoA. This step uses NADH as the reducing agent.

So, in step 2, NADP+ is the carrier for NADPH. So during this step, NADP+ is used as the carrier, but in step 3, the reducing agent is NADH, which is not NADP+. Therefore, NADP+ isn't used in step 3. So H is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: whenever you're looking at whether a certain substance is used, look at the steps. Let's think about the electron carriers.

In glycolysis, the steps are:

Step 1: Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-P → requires ATP.

Step 2: Phosphorylation of glucose-6-P → 3-PG → requires ATP and NADPH (NAD+ → NADP+).

Step 3: 3-PG to C3 and acetyl-CoA → uses NADH.

So during step 2, NADP+ is used as the carrier for NADPH. So it is used. Therefore, during glycolysis, NADP+ is used as a carrier during step 2, but not in step 3.

Wait. So H says 'glycolysis requires NADP+', which is correct because NADP+ is used in step 2 as a carrier. So H is correct? Or is it incorrect because in step 3, the reducing agent is NADH, not NADP+.

Wait, this is a bit confusing because I'm trying to remember if during glycolysis, NADP+ is used as a carrier in step 2, but not in step 3. So the statement in H says 'glycolysis requires NADP+', which would be correct because NADP+ is used in steps 2 as a carrier, but not in step 3, which uses NADH. So whether the statement is correct depends on the wording. The question is whether NADP+ is required overall. So if glycolysis uses NADP+ in some steps (like step 2) but not others (step 3), then the statement H is saying "requires NADP+", which would be true because NADP+ is used in some steps. So H is correct?

Wait, but let me think again. The statement is "glycolysis requires NADP+", which is correct because NADP+ is used in the second step (as a carrier for NADPH). So the answer would be H is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is incorrect because in the third step, the reducing agent is NADH, which is not NADP+.

Wait, but glycolysis uses NADP+ in the third step? No, because the third step uses NADH as the reducing agent. So H is incorrect because it's using NADP+ instead of NADH.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me check quickly. I'm trying to remember: the steps of glycolysis, especially the third step, uses NADH.

So, if H says that glycolysis requires NADP+, which is correct because NADP+ is used as a carrier in step 2 (as NADPH), but not in step 3. So the statement in H is correct because it's true that NADP+ is required in some steps. So H is correct.

Wait, but this is a bit tricky because the statement is 'requires NADP+', which depends on whether NADP+ is used in glycolysis overall. So if NADP+ is used in any step, the statement is correct. So since NADP+ is used in step 2, the statement is correct. So H is correct.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is incorrect because NADP+ is not used in the third step. So perhaps H is wrong.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's try to approach this differently. The statement is 'glyc requires NADP+', which is correct because NADP+ is used. So H is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is incorrect because in the third step, the reducing agent is NADH, which is not NADP+.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option E: Glucose converted into two molecules of fructose. No, because that's the product after glycolysis. So E is wrong.

So, back to the question, which option is correct.

Option C: In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products. That's correct because the two steps in glycolysis produce two molecules of pyruvate, each with 3 carbons. So C is correct.

Option E: No, because glucose is converted into fructose, which is part of the steps, but not the end product.

Option A: No, because the end product is pyruvate, not glucose.

Option B: No, because glycolysis requires enzymes.

So which statements are correct?

Wait, option C says glucose is split into two 3C products. So that's correct.

Option E is incorrect because it's fructose, not glucose.

Option F: Glycolysis requires ATP only. No, because step 1 requires ATP.

Option G: Glucagon increases the rate of glycolysis. No, glucagon is involved in promoting glucose uptake, not directly affecting glycolysis.

So, correct options are C and E?

Wait, no. E is incorrect because it's fructose, not glucose.

Wait, the options:

Option C: correct.

Option E: incorrect.

So, among the options, which statements are correct.

So, the correct statements would be A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

Wait, the question is which option is correct. So the correct statements are the correct answers.

Wait, another approach: which of the following statements is correct about glucose metabolism.

Option C is correct because in glycolysis, glucose is split into two three-carbon products.

Option E is incorrect because it's fructose.

Option D: Glyc only occurs in presence of oxygen. No, because glycolysis is anaerobic.

Option H: Glyc requires NADP+.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a list.

Which statements are correct:

Option C: correct.

Option E: incorrect.

Option H: I'm not sure. Let's see.

Option G: Glucagon increases glycolysis. No, glucagon is for glucose uptake.

Option B: no, because glycolysis requires enzymes.

Option A: no, because the end product is pyruvate.

Option F: no, requires ATP.

Option D: no.

So, correct among the options is C, and perhaps E (incorrect). So, looking at the options, the correct statements are C and E is wrong.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct about glucose metabolism. So, the correct statements are C and E is incorrect, E is wrong.

So, C and E are incorrect for different reasons.

Wait, so among the options, which is correct.

So, which one is correct?

The question is multiple-choice, each option is a statement. So, the question is which of the following is correct.

So, let's reevaluate each option.

Option A: No. The end product isn't glucose, it's pyruvate.

Option B: No, because glycolysis doesn't require any enzymes.

Option C: Yes, because the two products are three carbons each.

Option D: No, because it's anaerobic.

Option E: No, because it's fructose.

Option F: No, because ATP is required.

Option G: No, glucagon doesn't affect glycolysis.

Option H: No, H says it requires NADP+, but step 3 uses NADH, which is not NADP+.

Wait, no. So H is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps option H is correct because in the third step, NADP+ is used as the carrier for NADPH (step 2) and as a substrate for NADH (step 3). Wait, I think that in glycolysis, NADP+ is used as a carrier in step 2, but not in step 3. So the statement H says "glyc requires NADP+", which is correct because it's used in step 2, but not in step 3, so overall, NADP+ is used in some steps. So whether the statement is correct depends on the wording. The question says "glycolysis requires NADP+", which is correct because NADP+ is used in glycolysis.

So, the correct answer would be option C and E are incorrect, H is incorrect.

Wait, but let's think about the statement E again. E says "glucose metabolism only occurs in the presence of oxygen." No, because glycolysis is an anaerobic process. So E is incorrect.

So, the correct statement is option C.
</think>

To determine the correct statement about glucose metabolism, let's analyze each option:

### Option A:  
"The end-product of glycolysis in all cells is glucose."  
This is incorrect. The end product of glycolysis is two molecules of pyruvate, not glucose.

---

### Option B:  
"Glycolysis doesn't require any enzymes."  
This is incorrect. Glycolysis requires enzymes to proceed through its three-step cascade.

---

### Option C:  
"In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products."  
This is correct. Glycolysis involves the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (requires ATP) and the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate (requires ATP and NADPH). The two products, pyruvate, each has three carbons.

---

### Option D:  
"Glucose metabolism only occurs in the presence of oxygen."  
This is incorrect. Glucose metabolism is an anaerobic process in glycolysis, which does not require oxygen.

---

### Option E:  
"In glycolysis, glucose is converted into two molecules of fructose."  
This is incorrect. Fructose is the intermediate product of glycolysis, not the end product.

---

### Option F:  
"Gllycolysis requires ATP only."  
This is incorrect. Glycolysis requires ATP in the first two steps, but it is not limited to ATP.

---

### Option G:  
"Glucagon increases the rate of glycolysis."  
This is incorrect. Glucagon regulates glucose uptake into cells, not its metabolism.

---

### Option H:  
"Glycolysis requires NADP+."  
This is incorrect. Glycolysis uses NAD+ as the electron carrier in the first step (phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate), but NADP+ is used as the carrier for NADPH (the reducing agent in the second step). The third step uses NADH, not NADP+.

---

### Conclusion:  
The only correct statement is **Option C**, as glycolysis does indeed cleave glucose into two three-carbon products.
