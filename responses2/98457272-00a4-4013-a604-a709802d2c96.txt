Okay, so I have this math problem here: 22 divided by 2 plus 9. Hmm, let me think about how to solve this. I've seen similar problems before, so I remember that when there are multiple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, there's a specific order to follow. I think it's something called the order of operations, right? Oh wait, I think it's often remembered by the acronym PEMDASâ€”Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

So applying that to this problem: 22 / 2 + 9. Let's break it down step by step. First, I should look for any parentheses or exponents, but there are none here. Next, I check for multiplication or division. There's a division here, so I'll handle that first. 22 divided by 2 is 11. Then, I have addition left, which is 11 plus 9. That should be straightforward. 11 plus 9 equals 20. 

Wait, let me double-check. 22 divided by 2 is indeed 11 because 2 times 11 is 22. Then adding 9 to 11 gives me 20. So the final answer should be 20. Looking at the options provided, option D is 20. So I think the correct choice is D. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me make sure. If I were to approach it differently, like doing 22 divided by (2 plus 9), that would be 22 divided by 11, which is 2. But that's not the case here because the operations are in the order of division coming before addition. The problem is written as 22 / 2 + 9, so the division is first. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 20.
