Okay, so I've got this problem here about a wholesaler who's going out of business and sold some merchandise. Let me try to unpack this step by step. 

The question says he sold the merchandise for $1,288 at a loss of 8 percent of his original cost. I need to find out what the original cost was. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts. 

Hmm, so I remember that when there's a loss, the selling price is less than the original cost. The loss percentage is 8%, so that means the selling price is 92% of the original cost because 100% minus 8% is 92%. 

Wait, right. So if the original cost is, let's call it 'C', then 92% of C equals $1,288. So mathematically, that's 0.92 * C = 1288. 

I need to solve for C. So, C would be 1288 divided by 0.92. Let me do that division. 

Calculating 1288 / 0.92: Let's see, 0.92 goes into 1288 how many times. Hmm, 0.92 * 1400 is 0.92 * 1000 is 920, plus 0.92*400 is 368, so 920 + 368 = 1288. Oh wait, so 0.92 * 1400 is 1288. So C is $1,400. 

Looking back at the options, option C is $1,400.00. So that should be the answer. 

Wait, let me double-check. If the original cost is $1,400 and he sold it at an 8% loss, the loss amount is 8% of 1400. 8% is 0.08, so 1400 * 0.08 = 112. So the selling price would be 1400 - 112 = $1,288. Yep, that matches the given selling price. So I'm confident the original cost is $1,400.

The original cost of the merchandise was calculated by determining that the selling price ($1,288) represents 92% of the original cost (since an 8% loss was made). Solving for the original cost, we find it to be $1,400. 

Answer: C
