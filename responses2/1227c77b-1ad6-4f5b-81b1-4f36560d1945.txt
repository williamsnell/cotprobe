Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the excerpts below.
This corruption is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term sin . . . such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture . . . we are, merely on account of such corruption, deservedly condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 2: Chapter 1, 1545
The covenant of life is not preached equally to all, and among those to whom it is preached, does not always meet with the same reception. This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Calvinist and Lutheran theology, and I need to figure out which option is the biggest contrast between them. Let's start by going through the information provided.

The question presents two excerpts from John Calvin's "The Institutes of Christian Religion." The first excerpt talks about sin and the fruits of sin, pointing out that Jesus died for all sin because God is fair. The second excerpt discusses the covenant of life being preached differently to different people, and how God elects some and not others, leading to the distinction between salvation through faith alone versus good works.

Now, the question is about the biggest contrast between Calvinist and Lutheran views. The options are A to J. I need to analyze each option to see which one clearly shows a major difference.

First, let's recall what each group believes. Calvinism emphasizes that salvation is through grace and that it's not solely dependent on faith. The idea is that God elects individuals, and those who are elected are saved, but not necessarily because of their faith. This ties into the concept of free will and the distinction between salvation through grace and through faith alone. Calvinism also stresses that the elect are chosen by God, not by anyone else.

On the other hand, Lutheranism (as opposed to Protestant Lutheranism) is more about free will and the idea that salvation is not an automatic thing. Lutherans believe that salvation is dependent on the person's will and that God doesn't elect individuals; it's about the individual's choice of salvation. So, the key here is whether salvation is through faith alone, free will, or is it something else.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Lutherans believe in salvation through faith alone, while Calvinists emphasize good works. That seems correct. Calvin's idea is that grace saves, while Lutherans think it's about choice.

Option B: Calvinists believe predestination, while Lutherans have free will. That's right. Predestination is about God's will, while Lutherans think it's the individual's will.

Option C: Calvinists emphasize individual interpretation, while Lutherans stick to the Church's interpretation. I'm not as sure about this. Both Calvinism and Lutheranism have different approaches, but I'm not sure if the emphasis on interpretation is the biggest contrast. Maybe more about predestination or electing individuals, perhaps.

Option D: Calvinists about consubstantiation vs. Lutherans about transubstantiation. Wait, I don't remember exactly what consubstantiation and transubstantiation mean. Consubstantiation is a theological concept where a person is both a person and the Word at the same time. Transubstantiation is a specific event during the Eucharist where the person is both the saved person and the Word. So, Calvinists might have a different view on that. But I'm not sure if that's the biggest contrast between their views.

Option E: Calvinists rejected saints, whereas Lutherans continued to honor them. I think that's incorrect. Both Calvinists and Lutherans have saints, but their views on their role might differ. Calvinists, for instance, might view saints as fallen or as fallen in sin, while Lutherans might consider them as fallen as well but perhaps as fallen in a different way, but that's not the main contrast.

Option F: Lutherans believed the Eucharist had the Christ in it, while Calvinists interpreted it symbolically. So, in the Eucharist, the person is both the saved one and the Christ. Calvinists might see it as symbolic, while Lutherans might see it as literal. That's a big difference, but the question is about the biggest contrast between the two groups' theologies, not just their views on the Eucharist.

Option G: Lutherans emphasized all seven sacraments, while Calvinists only did two. I'm not sure about this. Both groups include the sacraments, but Calvinism emphasizes grace over sin and emphasizes that not everyone is saved by grace. The seven sacraments are part of the covenant, so their inclusion might be similar, but the content of their views might differ. I'm not certain.

Option H: Calvinists thought the state (e.g., the Church's role) is subordinate to the religion. I'm not sure about this. Both Calvinism and Lutheranism have the Church as an organization, but I'm not certain if the hierarchy is their biggest contrast.

Option I: Lutherans preferred a hierarchical church, while Calvinists supported a more egalitarian structure. That's right. Lutherans had a more traditional, hierarchical church, while Calvinists moved towards something more egalitarian, like the Reformation.

Option J: Lutherans used the reform to break from the Pope and Holy Roman Empire, which Calvinists might have opposed. That's a historical point, but not directly about their theological beliefs.

Now, the question is about the biggest contrast. Let's think about the main points each group emphasizes.

Calvinism emphasizes free will, the elect through God's choice, and that salvation can be done through grace. Lutheranism emphasizes that salvation is not automatic and that it depends on the individual's will.

So the biggest contrast is between predestination (Calvin) vs. free will (Luther). That's option B. But let me check the other options to see if any other points are more significant.

For example, if the question is about which option directly shows a major theological difference, the contrast between predestination and free will is the most significant. Another point is Calvinism's commitment to grace over sin, which is a big difference. But the question is about the biggest contrast between the two. So the contrast between predestination and free will is a key difference.

Looking back at the options, option B is exactly that: Calvinists believe in predestination while Lutherans believe in free will.

So the correct answer should be B.

The question asks which option represents the biggest contrast between Calvinist and Lutheran theology. Calvinism emphasizes free will and the elect through God's choice, while Lutheranism focuses on the individual's will and the automatic nature of salvation.

- **Option A**: Correctly identifies the contrast between Calvinism's emphasis on free will and the idea of salvation through faith alone.
- **Option B**: Accurately highlights the key theological difference between predestination (Calvin) and free will (Luther).
- **Option C**: While both groups have different views on interpretation, this is not the biggest contrast.
- **Option D**: Discusses consubstantiation and transubstantiation, which are theological concepts, but not the primary theological difference between their views.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as both groups reject saints.
- **Option F**: While both agree on the literal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, their interpretations differ.
- **Option G**: Both groups include the sacraments, but their content differs, which is less significant than the main theological differences.
- **Option H**: Both groups consider the Church's role, but the hierarchy differs.
- **Option I**: Correctly identifies a historical contrast between the church's structure.
- **Option J**: Correctly points out the historical approach to breaking from the Church's authority.

The biggest contrast is between predestination (Calvin) and free will (Luther), which is best captured by **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
