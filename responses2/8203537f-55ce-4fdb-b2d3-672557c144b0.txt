Question:

In 2006, an investor purchased a 100-acre tract located in a rural county. Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that "in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. " In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)

Okay, so I have this question about property law, specifically about a subdivision plan and a school construction. Let me try to break it down.

So, in 2006, an investor buys a 100-acre tract. He plans to make 90 one-acre lots for residential buildings and the remaining 10 acres for a public school. He wrote a sales brochure saying that the proposed school would be close, so the county district wouldn't need to spend taxes for construction. But then in 2009, the county board built a new school on those 10 acres.

I'm supposed to figure out what the investor's proposed designation is best described as. The options are various legal terms.

Hmm, so the key points are: the subdivision plan in 2006, recording with the recorder's office, and then in 2009, the school was built. The question is about the status of the initial plan.

Wait, so in 2006, the plan was created. The investor is assigning the 10 acres for the school. The idea is that it's close enough to the school, so the school doesn't need tax money. But wait, isn't the 10 acres now being used for a school, which was part of the subdivision plan?

I think this relates to easements. An easement is a right to use land for a specific purpose. So, if the subdivision plan was recorded, the owner (the investor) must have had some legal right to use the land for the school. But wait, the initial plan was created, then the subdivision was recordedâ€”so maybe the plan's right of use is valid?

But wait, the county board built the school. So the initial subdivision plan must have given the right of way to the school. Or perhaps the plan was an easement. Let me think.

In property law, a subdivision plan is a legal agreement that can be considered as an easement if it's part of a larger plan. Since the plan was recorded (recorded as a subdivision), that could imply the right of use for the school.

The investor's plan created the 10 acres for the school. The county board built it. So the plan's right of use must have been valid. So the initial plan is an easement.

Now, looking at the options. Option D is 'implied easement.' Option C is 'invalid legal agreement.'

Wait, but the plan was recorded. So the subdivision was done legally. The plan itself is a legal agreement, but if it's recorded, does that mean it's valid? Or could it be an invalid agreement because it's too close?

Wait, the idea is that the 10 acres are used for a school, which is close. So the proximity is a factor. The investor's plan might have implied that the school would be nearby, so it's an implied easement.

Alternatively, another point: the plan created the 10 acres, so the developer (investor) has a right of use for the school. So the plan is an easement. So the best description is an implied easement.

Wait, but the answer options don't have 'implied easement' as an option. Let me check.

Looking at the options, option D is 'implied easement,' which I think is correct. Alternatively, maybe the plan is an easement because it's part of a subdivision agreement.

Yes, so the correct answer is D: implied easement.
</think>

The correct answer is D: implied easement.

**Explanation:**
The investor's subdivision plan created the 10 acres for a school, which was intended to be close to the proposed school district. This proximity suggested that the 10 acres were available for public use (the school) and implied the right of use for the school district. Since the plan was legally recorded, it implied the right of use, making it an implied easement. The development of the school built on the plan further validates this legal right. Therefore, the best description of the investor's designation is an implied easement. 

**Answer:** D
