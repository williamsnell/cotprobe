Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about how many books Ty can read in 12 weeks if he reads 2 books each week. Hmm, I remember that when something is divided into parts, you multiply. Let me think.

Ty has 12 weeks, and each week he reads 2 books. So, each week adds 2 to his total. So, week 1: 2, week 2: 4, week 3: 6, and so on. That sounds like adding 2 each week. But maybe that's the same as multiplying. Wait, 12 weeks times 2 books per week would be 24 books. Oh, right, because 12 multiplied by 2 is 24. So the expression would be 12 * 2.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option G is 12 * 2, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be G.

The total number of books Ty reads is calculated by multiplying the number of weeks (12) by the number of books per week (2). Therefore, the expression is 12 * 2.

**Answer:**

G: 12 * 2
