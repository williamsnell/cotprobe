Okay, so I have this economics question here about DVD players. Let's see what I remember. The question is about how an increase in household income affects the equilibrium in a competitive market for DVD players, which are normal goods. Hmm.

Wait, I think a normal good is one where the demand increases as income increases, right? So when people have more income, they tend to buy more of a normal good. So if income goes up, demand for DVDs should go up.

Now, the market is competitive, so it's probably a supply and demand graph. The question is about the impact of an increase in income on the equilibrium. So what happens to the demand curve? For normal goods, the demand curve slopes downward, but when income increases, the entire curve shifts to the right because demand is higher at every price level.

So, normally, when the demand increases, the equilibrium price and quantity both go up. But wait, what's the supply curve like here? I think it's also affected. Wait, but the question says "all else equal," so supply doesn't change. So if the demand increases but supply is unchanged, the new demand curve (shifted right) will intersect the supply curve at a higher price and higher quantity.

But wait, let me think. So the equilibrium quantity would definitely increase because both curves moved right. What about the price? It would increase too. Because the shift in demand leads to a higher price, but since supply is unchanged, the quantity increases more.

Wait, but some people might say that since demand increases, the equilibrium quantity increases, but what about the price? Well, if the demand increases more... Or does it?

Wait, maybe I should consider the elasticity. But the question doesn't specify if the good is elastic or inelastic. So perhaps it's better to think in general terms.

So, if income increases, demand increases. Since supply is unchanged, the new equilibrium will have a higher price and higher quantity. So, the options that fit this would be... looking at the options:

Options D says decrease in quantity and increase in price. No, that's the opposite.

Option G says increase in both. Oh wait, but that's not correct because if supply is fixed, an increase in demand leads to the same price going up. So G would be incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose the demand curve shifts right, supply remains same. So new equilibrium is at the intersection, which is higher on both axes. So yes, both quantity and price go up.

Wait, but looking at the options. Let's see:

Option G: increase in equilibrium quantity and increase in price. Correct, because both go up.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, no. Let me read the options again.

Options:

A: No impact on quantity or price. No, because income affects demand, which affects both.

B: No impact on quantity, increase price. No, because quantity increases.

C: No impact on quantity, increase price. No.

D: Decrease in quantity but increase in price. No.

E: Increase in price, ambiguous on quantity. Hmm, or is the quantity ambiguous? No, because the equilibrium quantity will definitely go up.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question is about what happens when household income increases, all else equal.

So, for a normal good, when income increases, demand increases. So the demand curve shifts to the right.

But the supply is unchanged. So the new equilibrium is where the shifted demand meets supply. So, since demand is higher at every price, the equilibrium price will rise, and the equilibrium quantity will also rise.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G says increase in quantity and price. That's the case here.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again if I'm making a mistake. If income increases, demand increases, so the demand curve moves right. So the intersection with supply (which is unchanged) will be at a higher price and higher quantity. So yes, both go up.

Looking back at the options, option G is 'increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.' That must be the correct answer.

But wait, wait another thought. Wait, when demand increases, the equilibrium quantity could change if the supply curve is very elastic. But in this question, the supply is unchanged, so it's a standard shift. So the quantity increases, price increases.

So the correct answer is G.

The question examines how an increase in household income affects the equilibrium in a competitive market for DVD players, which are normal goods. Since DVD players are normal goods, an increase in income leads to an increase in demand, causing the demand curve to shift to the right. With supply unchanged, the new equilibrium will have a higher price and a higher quantity. This aligns with option G: "increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price."

Answer: G
