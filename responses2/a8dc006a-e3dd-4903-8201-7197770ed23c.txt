Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this thermodynamics problem. Let me read it again. So the reaction is CaCO3(s) turning into CaCO(s) and CO2(g) at 950°C. The pressure of CO2 is 1 atm. The enthalpy change, ∆H, is given as 176 kJ per mole. I need to find the change in internal energy, ∆E, under the assumption that the volume of the solid doesn't change much compared to the gas produced.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what ∆E is. Oh right, ∆E is the change in internal energy. Enthalpy change, ∆H, is the change in enthalpy, which is at constant pressure. But ∆E is the change in internal energy, which is at constant volume. So I think I need to relate ∆H and ∆E using the relation ∆H = ∆U + nΔVΔP. Wait, no, the formula is ∆H = ∆U + Δ(n)RT. Because ΔH is at constant pressure, and ΔU is at constant volume. So, the equation is ∆H = ∆U + Δ(n)RT. So, to find ∆U, I can rearrange that to ∆U = ∆H - Δ(n)RT.

Wait, but in this problem, the volume of the solid is considered negligible compared to the gas produced. So the change in volume, ΔV, would be approximately equal to the change in the gas phase. Since CaCO3 is a solid, its volume is fixed, so when it decomposes into CaCO and CO2, the gas's volume change is the important one. Wait, but the question says the volume of the solid changes little, so maybe the change in volume is approximately the same as the gas volume. So ΔV ≈ n(gas) - n(solid). Since the solid's volume is negligible, the change is just the gas volume.

Wait, but the problem says that the volume of the solid phase changes little by comparison with the volume of gas generated. So, the change in volume, ΔV, is approximately equal to the moles of gas produced, assuming the solid's volume is negligible. So, I think Δn is the moles of gas produced minus moles of solid consumed. In this reaction, one mole of CaCO3 becomes one mole of CaCO and one mole of CO2. So the solid is CaCO, and the gas is CO2. So, the moles of gas increase by 1 mole. So Δn is +1 mole. But in reality, wait, the CaCO3 is a solid and becomes CaCO(s) and CO2(g). So, the solid is CaCO(s) which has zero moles of gas. So, when CaCO3(s) decomposes, it produces one mole of gas (CO2). So, the change in moles of gas is +1. So Δn = +1.

But wait, the reaction is CaCO3(s) → CaCO(s) + CO2(g). So, on the left, one mole of solid. On the right, one mole of CaCO solid (same as solid) and one mole of CO2 gas. So, the number of moles of gas increases by 1. So, Δn = n_products - n_reactants. Products have 1 mole of gas, reactants have 0. So Δn = 1 - 0 = +1.

Now, the formula is ∆H = ∆U + Δ(n) R T. That comes from the relation between enthalpy and internal energy. So, solving for ∆U gives ∆U = ∆H - Δ(n) R T.

Wait, but wait! The formula I remember is ∆H = ∆U + V ∆P. At constant pressure, and V is the volume change. But since we're dealing with gases, and the volume change is the change in moles times R T. So, yes, the formula is ∆H = ∆U + Δn R T, where Δn is the change in moles of gas. So, ∆U = ∆H - Δn R T.

So, let's plug in the numbers. We know ∆H is 176 kJ/mol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, the reaction is per mole. Oh, wait, the reaction is written as 1 mole of CaCO3 decomposing into 1 mole of CaCO and 1 mole of CO2. So, the change in moles of gas is +1 per mole of CaCO3. So, Δn is +1.

So, R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/mol·K. The temperature is 950°C, which is 950 + 273.15 = 1223.15 K. Wait, but I should probably be more precise. Let me calculate that: 950 + 273.15 is 1223.15 K. But wait, the problem gives ∆H as 176 kJ per mole. So, I think the units for R have to match. So, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) which is 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K). So, let's compute each term.

Compute Δn R T. Δn is 1. R is 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K). T is 1223.15 K.

So, 1 * 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K) * 1223.15 K = let's calculate that.

1223.15 * 0.008314 = ?

Hmm, 1223 * 0.008314. Let me compute that. 1223 * 0.0083 is about 10.16 (since 1223 *83= approx 101, 1010). Wait, perhaps a calculator approach. 1223 * 0.008314 = ?

Wait, 1223 * 0.008 = 9.784. 1223 * 0.000314 = approx 1223 *0.0003=0.3669, 1223 *0.000014=0.017122. So, adding 0.3669 +0.017122=0.384. So total is 9.784 +0.384 = 10.168. So, approximately 10.168 kJ.

So, ∆U = ∆H - (Δn R T) = 176 kJ - 10.168 kJ = 165.832 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the problem says to calculate ∆E, the change in internal energy. So, the answer would be approximately 166 kJ. Looking at the options, option B is 166 kJ. But wait, let's double-check the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute 1223.15 * 0.008314 more accurately.

1223.15 * 0.008314 = ?

Take it step by step. 1223 * 0.008314 = ?

Calculating 1223 * 0.008314: Let's break it down.

0.008314 = 8.314e-3.

1223 * 8.314e-3 = (1223 *8.314) *1e-3.

1223 *8 = 9784, 1223 * 0.314 = approx 383.022. So total is 9784 + 383.022 = 10167.022. Multiply by 1e-3, which is 10.167022. So about 10.167 kJ.

So, ∆U = 176 - 10.167 = 165.833 kJ. Approximately 166 kJ. So the answer would be option B: 166 kJ.

Wait, but wait, another point: sometimes, when the volume of the solid is considered negligible, the change in volume is just the gas volume. So, the formula is ∆H = ∆U + (Δn) R T. So, ∆n is +1. So, calculation seems correct.

But let me think again. Alternatively, the enthalpy change is 176 kJ per mole. So, if the reaction is written as 1 mole of CaCO3 decomposing, the system gains 176 kJ of heat at constant pressure, but that's the enthalpy change. But the internal energy change would be less because enthalpy includes pressure-volume work, and internal energy is at constant volume. So, ∆U = ∆H - (VΔP) at constant pressure. But since we're assuming the volume of the solid is negligible, the change in volume is just the gas volume. So, the formula ∆U = ∆H - Δn R T holds.

So, yes, the calculation should be correct.

To calculate the change in internal energy, ∆E, for the reaction CaCO₃(s) → CaCO(s) + CO₂(g) at 950°C (1223.15 K), we use the relationship between enthalpy change (∆H) and internal energy change (∆E). The formula is:

\[
\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta n \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Rearranging for ∆U:

\[
\Delta U = \Delta H - \Delta n \cdot R \cdot T
\]

### Step 1: Identify the values
- ∆H (enthalpy change) is given as 176 kJ/mol.
- The reaction produces 1 mole of gas (CO₂) and consumes 1 mole of solid (CaCO). Thus, the change in moles of gas, Δn, is +1.
- The gas constant, R, is 8.314 J/(mol·K) or 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K).
- Temperature, T, is 950°C = 1223.15 K.

### Step 2: Calculate the volume term
\[
\Delta n \cdot R \cdot T = 1 \cdot 0.008314 \cdot 1223.15 \approx 10.167 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate ∆E
\[
\Delta U = \Delta H - \Delta n \cdot R \cdot T = 176 \, \text{kJ/mol} - 10.167 \, \text{kJ/mol} \approx 165.83 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated ∆E is approximately 166 kJ/mol, which corresponds to option **B**.
