Question:

Rita is moving a pile of 120 rocks by hand to build a rock wall. If h represents the number of rocks that she can carry in one load, which expression represents the total number of loads needed to move the entire pile of rocks?

Options:

A: 120 âˆ’h
B: 120 +h
C: 120%h
D: h/120
E: 120h
F: h*120
G: 120/h
H: h^120
I: h-120
J: h+120

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Rita moving rocks. Let me try to think through it step by step.

So, Rita has 120 rocks, and she's moving them one by one to build a rock wall. The question is asking which expression represents the total number of loads needed to move all the rocks, where h is the number she can carry in one load.

Hmm, let's break it down. Each load she does, she carries h rocks. So if she does one load, she moves h rocks. Two loads would be 2h, and so on. The total number of rocks is 120, so I need to find out how many loads (let's say L) she needs to do to reach 120 rocks.

Mathematically, that should be L multiplied by h equals 120. So, L * h = 120. To find L, we can rearrange this equation. So L = 120 / h. That makes sense because if she can carry more rocks in each load, she'll finish earlier.

Looking at the options, option G is 120/h. That matches what I derived. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up numerator and denominator. Yes, 120 divided by h because each load contributes h rocks, so to get to 120, you divide 120 by h.

Wait, what about the other options? Option A is 120 - h. That would be the number of rocks left after each load, but that doesn't give the number of loads, just the rocks remaining. Option B adds h, which doesn't make sense because you can't have partial loads or negative rocks. Option C is 120%, which is the same as 1.2 times, but that doesn't directly relate to the number of loads. Option D is h/120, which would be a fraction less than 1, which wouldn't make sense for the number of loads. Option E and F are just h*120 and h+120, which are way too high and don't represent the number of loads. Options I and J are h-120 and h+120, which are also irrelevant. 

So yeah, option G is definitely the correct one.

The correct expression is 120/h, which represents the number of loads needed when Rita carries h rocks per load.

**Answer:** G: 120/h
