Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about oligopoly and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which condition is a characteristic of oligopoly. I remember that oligopoly is a market structure with a few firms, but they're not just competitors; they have some influence over each other's prices and outputs. So the options are A through J, each with a different statement.

First, what's the definition of oligopoly? Oligopoly is characterized by a small number of firms, each of which has significant market power. This leads to each firm's decisions affecting the others, unlike perfect competition where each firm's actions don't impact others much. So, the key points are that there are a few firms, and they compete in a way that their actions are interdependent.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: "Rival firms act independently of each other." Wait, no, that's not right. In oligopoly, firms are interdependent. Their decisions affect each other, so they don't act independently. So A can't be correct.

Option B: "Rival firms never interact or influence each other's prices." Again, that can't be right. If they never interact, they can't influence each other's prices. So B is incorrect.

Option C: "A rival firm matches price decreases of rivals, but fails to match any price increases of rivals." Hmm, this seems to describe a scenario where a firm sets a lower price, and others respond by lowering theirs. But if they fail to match price increases, maybe they lower more than the rivals. Wait, but in oligopoly, usually, firms might lower prices to gain market share if others do. But I'm not sure if C is correct.

Option D: "A rival firm always undercut the price of rivals regardless of their price changes." Undercutting means setting a price below the competitor's. But if a firm can't undercut when others do, that might not fit. Also, I think undercutting is more about price competition, but oligopolies can have various strategies, not necessarily undercutting.

Option E: "A rival firm matches price increases of rivals, but fails to match any price decrease of rivals." Wait, does that make sense? If a firm sees that rivals are lowering prices, it would probably raise its own. But E says it fails to match any price decrease. So, maybe the firm doesn't lower when rivals do. But I'm not sure how that relates to the characteristic of oligopoly. Maybe it's not about the interaction but rather about some strategic behavior.

Option F: "A rival firm matches both price increases and decreases of rivals." That sounds like a firm is matching price changes in both directions. But in oligopoly, I thought that when rivals lower, a firm might lower more, but if rivals raise, the firm might raise more. But I'm not certain if that's a defining characteristic.

Option G: "A rival firm fails to match both price increases or price decreases of rivals." So, sometimes it matches increases, but not decreases. That doesn't fit. Because if a firm sees rivals raising prices, it might respond by raising its own. But if it sees rivals lowering, it would respond by lowering more. So maybe this is not a characteristic.

Option H: "Rival firms always collude to set prices." Collusion is when firms work together to set prices, which isn't part of oligopoly. Oligopolies don't necessarily have collusion; that's more of a characteristic of perfect competition (where prices are set by the market) or monopoly.

Option I: "A rival firm matches price decreases of rivals, but exceeds any price increases of rivals." So, when a rival firm lowers prices, this firm also lowers theirs more. But when a rival firm raises prices, this firm raises more. That's a bit unclear. I'm not sure if this is a standard oligopoly condition.

Option J: "Rival firms always have the same production costs." This refers to perfect competition, where all firms have identical costs. Oligopolies don't have that; they have varying costs, or perhaps some are cost-effective. So J is incorrect.

Wait, I think I might be getting confused. Let me go back. Oligopolies have a few firms that can influence each other. One key aspect is that their strategies are interdependent, so they adjust their prices and outputs based on what others are doing. So, when a firm lowers its price, the others might too, but if one is able to respond, maybe by lowering more, it could be an oligopoly condition.

Looking again, option C says that a rival firm matches price decreases but fails to match price increases. So, when rivals lower, this firm also lowers. But when rivals raise prices, this firm doesn't increase. Is this a characteristic? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in oligopoly, firms do not necessarily always match price increases; they might respond differently.

Wait, another thought: in oligopoly, firms might engage in strategic behavior where they don't always follow the same price-response pattern. For example, a firm might lower prices more when others do, but when others raise, it might raise more. So, C might describe such a situation, but is that a defining characteristic?

Alternatively, perhaps the key characteristic is that the market is characterized by a small number of firms, each influencing the others' prices and outputs. So, the answer would be something about having a small number of firms and interdependence.

Wait, looking again at the options, option C says the rival firm (another firm) matches price decreases but fails to match price increases. So, perhaps when a firm sees rivals lowering, it matches (like lowers) but when it sees rivals raising, it doesn't match, meaning it might raise more. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the characteristics of oligopoly. Some key features include:

- Few sellers dominate the market.
- Interdependence exists; prices and outputs are influenced by each other.
- Firms may engage in strategies like price wars or collusion.

So, which of the options align with these aspects?

Option C says that a rival firm matches price decreases but fails to match any price increases. So, when rivals lower, this firm lowers as well. But when they raise, it doesn't. So, perhaps in some oligopolies, when rivals are increasing prices, this firm doesn't do the same. But I'm not sure if that's a defining characteristic.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C. Because in oligopoly, when a firm sees a price decrease, it might respond by lowering its own prices as well. But if a firm sees a price increase from rivals, it may not increase its own price as much, perhaps because it's less profitable. So, in that case, the firm would match price decreases but not price increases. So option C seems to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E. Wait, E says that a rival firm matches price increases but fails to match price decreases. Hmm, that's the opposite of C. If a firm sees rivals raising, it might raise more, but if rivals lower, it doesn't lower. So, perhaps that's also a characteristic.

Wait, but I'm trying to think of the key points. The key being that oligopolies are characterized by a small number of firms, not just any number. So, the number is small, but that's not one of the options. The options given are about the conditions.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is option C: a firm matches price decreases but doesn't match price increases. That's a possible characteristic.

Alternatively, another thought: in oligopoly, the firms' strategies are interdependent, so they don't necessarily always do what one does. So, for example, a firm may not always lower its price when rivals do, but that's not a characteristic.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see each option again.

Option A: Rival firms act independently. No, that's not right.

Option B: Rival firms never interact. No.

Option C: Rival firms match price decreases but fail to match price increases. So, if a firm sees a rival lower, it lowers. If it sees a rival raise, it doesn't. Maybe that's a characteristic. So, in such a scenario, the firm is likely to lower more when others lower, but not when others raise. So, this could be a condition of oligopoly.

Looking back, I think the correct answer is option C. Because in oligopolies, when one firm lowers, others might too. But when others raise, this firm might not as much, so it doesn't match any price increase. So option C is a condition.
</think>

The question asks which condition is characteristic of oligopoly. Oligopoly is a market structure with a few firms, each influencing the others' prices and outputs, leading to interdependence. The key features of oligopoly include a small number of firms, interdependence, and strategic behavior.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. In oligopoly, firms act independently, as they are interdependent.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Oligopolies involve firm interaction, so they cannot act independently.
- **Option C**: Correct. A firm matches price decreases when rivals do but fails to match price increases, reflecting strategic behavior in oligopolies.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Undercutting is more of a pricing strategy, not a defining characteristic.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. If firms fail to match price increases, it does not fully describe oligopoly.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Matching both price increases and decreases is not a defining characteristic.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Failing to match both price increases or decreases is not a defining characteristic.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Collusion is not a defining feature of oligopoly.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Failing to match price increases does not describe oligopoly.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Constantly having the same production costs is not a defining characteristic.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it aligns with the interdependence and strategic behavior characteristic of oligopoly.
