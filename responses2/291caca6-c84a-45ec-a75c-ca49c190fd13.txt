Okay, so I have this question about astronomical units. Hmm, I remember that AU is a unit of distance used in astronomy. Let me think, I think one AU is the average distance from Earth to the Sun. Right, the Earth's orbit around the Sun is about 1 Astronomical Unit. 

Wait, what's the actual number? I remember the Sun is about 1.496 times the radius of the Earth. But how does that relate to AU? Oh wait, AU is defined as the distance from the Earth to the Sun, which is approximately 149.6 million kilometers. So looking at the options, option B is 140 million km, which is close. But wait, maybe I should think about the exact number. 

I think the exact value is about 149.6 million km. So the closest option is B: 140 million km. But wait, sometimes I've heard it's 150 million, so maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, I think 1 AU is about 1.5 Ã— 10^8 km, which is 150 million km. So option A is 150 million. 

Wait, the options are: A is 150, B is 140, C is 180, D is 170, E is 200, and so on. So the correct value is approximately 150 million km, so option A. But wait, some sources might say 149.6 million, which is about 1.5e8 km, so that would round to 150 million. So the correct answer should be A. But I'm a bit confused because I've heard it's sometimes 149.6 million, which would be closer to 150 million, so the right choice would be A.
