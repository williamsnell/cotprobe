Question:

An owner-retailer in a small shopping center entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement with an investor. The retailer stayed in possession and became the lessee for the next 25 years with monthly payments and various obligations regarding maintaining the property. The retailer had to pay most of the expenses on the property, and had options for further extensions but not to purchase the property back. Within a few years, lessee's business grew and he wanted to tear down one of the buildings and attach a new building to his store. The investor refused to consent. Lessee filed suit asking for an order compelling compliance. Will the court likely order the investor to comply with the lessor's demands?

Options:

A: Yes, the lessee will be able to make the improvements without the investor's consent but the improvements will belong to the investor.
B: No, because in every sale-leaseback agreement, there is a clause guaranteeing that the lessee cannot make improvements without the written consent of the investor.
C: No, because the investor can deny any changes that they think will devalue the property.
D: Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.
E: Yes, because the lessee has the right to make alterations to improve business operations.
F: Yes, since the lessee's business is growing and needs expansion, the investor should comply.
G: Yes, because the lessee has the right to make changes as he is the one paying for the property.
H: No, the investor has the final say in any changes to the property since they are the legal owner.
I: No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this real property question. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about a sale-leaseback arrangement between an owner and an investor. The retailer (the lessee) stayed in possession and is paying monthly, with various obligations. He's paid most of the expenses and has options for further extensions but not to buy back. Then, the lessee wants to tear down a building and add a new one, and the investor doesn't want that. The lessee is suing the investor for orders to comply.

I remember that in sale-leaseback agreements, there are certain obligations. The lessee (the current owner) has to maintain the property as is. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether they have the right to make improvements on their own without the investor's consent.

Wait, I think in some agreements, the lessee has the right to make improvements, especially if they're part of a real estate development. But I'm not sure if that's always the case or if it depends on the type of lease or the terms of the agreement.

The options given are A to H. The question is whether the court will order the investor to comply.

Let me think about each option. Option A says the lessee can make improvements without consent but the property goes to the investor. But can lessee actually make such improvements on their own? I don't think so; usually, the lessee has the right to make improvements to their own building, especially if it's part of a development.

Option B says there's a clause in every agreement guaranteeing the lessee can't make improvements without consent. That doesn't sound right. I think it's more about the lease terms rather than the agreement guaranteeing it. Maybe some agreements have it, but it's not a universal rule.

Option C says the investor can deny changes they think will devalue the property. That doesn't sound like the court would enforce. The court probably looks at whether the lessee actually has the right to make such changes.

Option D says the lessee's equity interest is greater, so he can make improvements. Hmm, equity interest is a bit different. The lessee might have a higher interest, but I'm not sure if that's the right basis for making improvements. It might be more about the right to use the property or to make repairs, not necessarily the equity interest.

Option E suggests the lessee's right to make alterations is because they're the owner. That makes sense because the lessee owns the property, so they can make improvements on their own. But I'm not sure if that's the case in all situations.

Option F says the lessee's growth needs expansion, so the investor must comply. That doesn't seem right. The lessee's business growth is part of the lease agreement, but the investor's stance isn't supported by law.

Option G states the lessee has the right to make changes as he's paying for the property. I think this is correct. The lessee has a legal right to make improvements, especially if it's part of continuing the business.

Option H says the investor has the final say, which doesn't make sense. The lessee is the lessor, so he retains the power over the lease terms, including making improvements.

Option I says the lessee can't make changes without consent because it's risky. I'm not sure about that. There are risks, but the court probably doesn't hold the lessee liable for making changes without consent.

Putting it all together. The lessee has the right to make improvements on their own, as per the law. So the correct answer should be G.

The lessee, who owns the property, retains the legal right to make improvements as part of the sale-leaseback arrangement. This is a fundamental right under real property law, as outlined in the lease agreement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.**

ANSWER: G
