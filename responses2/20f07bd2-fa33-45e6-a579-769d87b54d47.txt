Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about a neutral density (ND) filter and its transmittance. I remember that ND filters reduce the amount of light that gets through as you go down the filter. The transmittance is the percentage of light that gets through each additional layer. 

The problem states that a 0.1 mm thick filter gives 70% transmissivity. So, wait, that means that 70% of the light passes through each 0.1 mm of the filter. Now, the question is asking, if the filter were 2 mm thick, what would its transmittance be?

Hmm, I think I need to figure out how much the thickness affects the transmittance. Since the filter has a neutral density property, each mm (or each layer) reduces the light by a certain percentage. But wait, the problem says the 0.1 mm gives 70% transmission. Oh, maybe the 70% is the transmission at the 0.1 mm mark. So each additional 0.1 mm would multiply the current transmission by the same factor again. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The 0.1mm gives 70% transmission. So if you have another 0.1mm, does that mean the total is 70% * 70% = 49%? Because each layer multiplies the previous transmission. So for 2 mm, which is two layers of 0.1mm each, the total transmittance would be 70% * 70% = 49%. That makes sense because each subsequent layer reduces the light more. 

So, if the original 0.1mm gives 70%, then each additional 0.1mm would reduce it further. So, 2 mm would be (0.7)^2 = 0.49, which is 49%. Looking at the options, option C is 49%, so that should be the right answer. 

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is the transmission after n layers would be (transmission per layer)^n. Since the 0.1mm is 1 layer, the transmission per layer is 70%, or 0.7. So for two layers, it's 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49, which is 49%. Yeah, that's correct.

The neutral density filter reduces light transmission as it passes through each layer. A 0.1 mm layer transmits 70% of the light. For a 2 mm thick filter, which is equivalent to two layers of 0.1 mm each, the total transmittance is calculated by squaring the transmission per layer. 

Calculations:
- Transmission per 0.1 mm layer = 70% (or 0.7)
- For 2 layers: \(0.7 \times 0.7 = 0.49\) or 49%.

Thus, the transmittance of a 2 mm thick filter is **49%**.
