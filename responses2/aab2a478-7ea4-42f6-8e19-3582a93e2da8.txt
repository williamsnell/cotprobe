Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Carnot refrigerator problem. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that Carnot cycles are the most efficient possible for heat engines, but here it's a refrigerator. Oh right, the Carnot refrigerator has a maximum coefficient of performance (COP) when it's in a reversible process.

The question says the initial temperature inside the refrigerator is 5°C, and the ambient is 27°C. Then it's decreased to -13°C, while the ambient remains at 27. I need to find the percent increase in work input when the same amount of heat is removed.

Wait, wait, so the same quantity of heat is removed. So Q is the same in both cases. I think we can model the two scenarios: initial and final, and calculate the work done each time.

The COP for a refrigerator is Qc/Qw, where Qc is the heat extracted from the cold reservoir (inside the fridge), and Qw is the work input. Oh right, and the COP can be calculated using the temperatures. For Carnot, the COP is Tc/(Tc - Th), but wait, wait, no, I think for a refrigerator, the COP is Tc/(Th - Tc), because it's the heat extracted divided by the work input.

Wait, let me get that right. For a refrigerator, the coefficient of performance is COP = Qc / W, and when using the Carnot cycle, the COP is given by COP = Tc / (Th - Tc), where Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir.

Wait, but wait, the temperatures should be in Kelvin, right? So I need to convert all temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin.

So for the initial case: Tc1 = 5°C = 278.15 K, Th = 27°C = 300.15 K.

So COP_initial = Tc1 / (Th - Tc1) = 278.15 / (300.15 - 278.15) = 278.15 / 22 = around 12.643.

Wait, let me compute that. 300.15 - 278.15 = 22 K. So 278.15 / 22 ≈ 12.643.

Then, work input W1 is Qc / COP_initial. Since Qc is the same as before, let's call it Q. So W1 = Q / 12.643.

Wait, but wait, is Q the same in both cases? The problem states the same quantity of heat is removed. So Q is the same in both cases. So for the initial case, COP_initial = 278.15/(300.15-278.15) = 278.15 / 22 ≈ 12.643.

In the second scenario, the inside temp is -13°C, so Tc2 = 260.15 K. Th is still 300.15 K.

So COP_final = Tc2 / (Th - Tc2) = 260.15 / (300.15 - 260.15) = 260.15 / 40.0 ≈ 6.50375.

Wait, 300.15 - 260.15 is 40 K. So 260.15 /40 is 6.50375.

Wait, but wait: 40 times 6.5 is 260, so yes, about 6.50375.

So the COP for the final case is approximately 6.50375.

So the work input in the final case is W2 = Q / COP_final = Q /6.50375.

Wait, but in the initial case, W1 = Q /12.643. So what's the ratio of W2 to W1?

W2/W1 = (Q /6.50375) / (Q /12.643) ) = (12.643)/(6.50375) ≈ 1.938.

So the work input in the final case is about 1.938 times the initial. So the increase is 0.938 times the initial.

Wait, no: the question is the percent increase. So initial W1, final W2, so the increase is (W2 - W1)/W1 = (1.938 -1 ) = 0.938. So 93.8% increase.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options are all percentages, so 93.8% is not an option. Hmmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the initial COP: Tc is 5 C → 278.15 K; Th is 27 → 300.15 K.

So Th - Tc = 22 K.

COP_initial = 278.15 / 22 → let me compute this more accurately. 278.15 ÷ 22 = 12.643 approximately.

COP_final: Tc2 is -13 C → 260.15 K. Th is 300.15 K.

Th - Tc2 = 40 K. So COP_final = 260.15 /40 = 6.50375.

Wait, so W1 = Q / (278.15/22) ) → which is Q * (22/278.15) → approx 0.07794 Q.

W2 = Q / (260.15/40) ) → Q * (40/260.15) → approx 0.15375 Q.

So the ratio W2/W1 = 0.15375 /0.07794 ≈ 1.978.

Wait, that's about 1.978 times, meaning a 97.8% increase.

Wait, but the options don't have 97.8%. The closest is option G: 94.5% or H: 102.1%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the COP. Another way to think: for a refrigerator, COP = Qc / W.

Wait, but wait, for a Carnot refrigerator, COP is Tc / (Th - Tc). So that part's correct. So I think my calculations are correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the initial COP.

Wait, initial COP is 278.15/(300.15 -278.15) → denominator is (Th - Tc) = 22 K.

So 278.15 /22 = 12.643 approximately.

Wait, let me calculate 22 × 12 = 264. 22×12.643 =22*(12 +0.643)= 264 + 14.146= 278.146 → which is approximately 278.15 K. So COP_initial is correct.

Then in the final case, COP_final is 260.15/(300.15-260.15)=260.15/40=6.50375.

So W2 = Q /6.50375 → which is approximately 0.15375 Q.

W1 was Q /12.643 → about 0.07794 Q.

So the ratio W2/W1 = 0.15375 / 0.07794 → let me compute that more accurately.

0.15375 / 0.07794.

Dividing 0.15375 by 0.07794: let's see. 0.07794 * 1.978 = approx 0.15375.

So it's about 1.978 times. So the increase is 0.978, which is a 97.8% increase. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are like 65.7% (A), 110.4% (B), etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-express everything.

Alternative approach: The work input is W = Q / COP.

So for the initial case:

COP_initial = Tc_initial / (Th - Tc_initial) → = 278.15/(300.15 -278.15) = 278.15/22 ≈12.643.

So W1 = Q /12.643.

In the second case:

COP_final = Tc_final/(Th - Tc_final) → =260.15/(300.15-260.15) → 260.15/40=6.50375.

So W2= Q /6.50375.

So the ratio W2/W1 is (Q/6.50375)/(Q/12.643) )= 12.643/6.50375.

Compute this fraction:

12.643 /6.50375 ≈ let's compute.

Hmm, 6.50375 * 1.938 ≈ 6.50375 * 1.9 = 12.357, and 6.50375 * 0.038 ≈ 0.2471. So 12.357+0.2471=12.604, which is approximately 12.643. So 1.938.

So the ratio is about 1.938, meaning the work input increased by 0.938 times, which is a 93.8% increase.

Wait, but none of the options match that. The options are all around 65-102% increases. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the temperatures are in Kelvin, but perhaps the question uses Celsius directly. Wait no, no, the temperatures are in Celsius, but in the formula, they should be converted to Kelvin.

Wait, let me double-check the problem statement. The initial temperature is 5°C, which is 278.15 K. The ambient is 27°C → 300.15 K.

In the second case, the inside is -13°C → 260.15 K. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the work calculation is different. Alternatively, perhaps the initial COP is correct, and the final COP is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the COPs.

Wait, initial: COP_initial = 278.15 / (300.15 -278.15) = 278.15/22 ≈ 12.643.

Final: COP_final = 260.15 / (300.15 -260.15)= 260.15/40 = 6.50375.

Wait, that's correct. So the COP decreases from about 12.6 to 6.5, which makes sense because the inside temp is going down.

Wait, so the work input in the initial case is Q / 12.643, and in the final case is Q /6.50375.

So the ratio is (Q/6.50375) / (Q/12.643))= 12.643/6.50375 ≈ 1.938.

So the work input increases by approximately 0.938 → 93.8% increase. But the options don't have that.

Wait, what if the work input is the work done by the refrigerator, but I'm considering work input as the work done on the system. Let me think about that.

Wait, no, for a refrigerator, the work input is the work done on the system (from the reservoir to the fridge), and the heat extracted from the fridge is Qc. So the COP is Qc / W, so W = Qc / COP.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the way I calculate the COP. Let me think again.

Another way: the coefficient of performance for a refrigerator is COP = (Tc)/(Th - Tc), correct.

So initial COP_initial = 278.15 / (300.15 - 278.15) = 278.15 /22 ≈ 12.643.

Final COP_final = 260.15 / (300.15 -260.15) = 260.15 /40 → 6.50375.

Wait, so W2 = Q /6.50375, W1 = Q /12.643.

So W2/W1 = (Q /6.5) / (Q/12.643) )= (12.643)/(6.5) → approx 1.938.

So again 93.8% increase.

But none of the options are around 93.8%. Let's look at the options again:

Options are A:65.7%, B:110.4%, C:75.3%, D:78.3%, E:120.8%, F:89.9%, G:94.5%, H:102.1%, I:85.2%, J:99.7%.

Hmm, the closest is option G: 94.5%, which is very close to our 93.8%. So perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, maybe I should compute 12.643 /6.50375 more accurately.

Let me calculate 12.643 /6.50375.

Dividing 12.643 by 6.50375.

Let me compute 6.50375 * 1.938 = ?

6.50375 * 1.9 = 12.357

6.50375 * 0.038 = approximately 0.2471.

So 12.357 + 0.2471 = 12.604. Which is a bit less than 12.643.

So let me compute 6.50375 * 1.938 = 12.604.

We need 12.643, so the difference is 12.643 -12.604=0.039.

So 0.039 /6.50375 ≈ 0.006.

So 1.938 + 0.006 ≈1.944.

So 6.50375 *1.944 → 6.50375 *1.9 =12.357, 6.50375 *0.044= 0.2861.

So total 12.357+0.2861=12.643. So yes, 1.944.

So 12.643/6.50375=1.944.

So the ratio is 1.944, meaning the work input increases by 0.944, which is 94.4% increase.

So about 94.4% increase. The closest option is G:94.5%.

So the correct answer is G:94.5%.

To solve the problem, we analyze the Carnot refrigerator scenario where the inside temperature decreases from \( T_{c1} = 5^\circ \text{C} \) to \( T_{c2} = -13^\circ \text{C} \), while the ambient temperature (\( T_h \)) remains constant at \( 27^\circ \text{C} \). The goal is to determine the percent increase in work input (\( W \)) for the same quantity of heat removed (\( Q \)).

### Step 1: Convert Temperatures to Kelvin
- \( T_{c1} = 5 + 273.15 = 278.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_{c2} = -13 + 273.15 = 260.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_h = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 2: Carnot Refrigerator Coefficient of Performance (COP)
The COP for a refrigerator is given by:
\[
\text{COP} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c}
\]

#### Initial COP:
\[
\text{COP}_1 = \frac{278.15}{300.15 - 278.15} = \frac{278.15}{22} \approx 12.643
\]

#### Final COP:
\[
\text{COP}_2 = \frac{260.15}{300.15 - 260.15} = \frac{260.15}{40} \approx 6.504
\]

### Step 3: Work Input
The work input (\( W \)) for a refrigerator is given by:
\[
W = \frac{Q}{\text{COP}}
\]

Thus:
- Initial work input: \( W_1 = \frac{Q}{\text{COP}_1} \approx \frac{Q}{12.643} \)
- Final work input: \( W_2 = \frac{Q}{\text{COP}_2} \approx \frac{Q}{6.504} \)

### Step 4: Ratio of Work Inputs
The ratio of the final work input to the initial work input is:
\[
\frac{W_2}{W_1} = \frac{\frac{Q}{6.504}}{\frac{Q}{12.643}} = \frac{12.643}{6.504} \approx 1.944
\]

This means the work input increases by:
\[
\text{Increase} = 1.944 - 1 = 0.944 \, (\text{or } 94.4\%)
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The closest option to the calculated increase is **G: 94.5%**.
