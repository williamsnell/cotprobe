Okay, so I'm looking at this question about the normal human chromosome diploid number. Hmm, I remember that diploid refers to having two sets of chromosomes. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. Let me think. 

I think humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Oh wait, but wait, human cells are diploid, right? So each chromosome has a pair. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the term can be tricky. Let me break it down. Each human cell has 46 chromosomes because it's diploid (2n) and n is 23. So 2n would be 46. 

Wait, but wait again. The question is about the normal human's diploid number. So the number per chromosome is two, making the total 46. But wait, sometimes people refer to the chromosome count without considering the pairing. Like, if you have 23 pairs, that's 46 chromosomes. 

So the options are A to J. Let's see the options again. The options are numbers, but I think the question is about the total number. So looking at the options, option B is 42, which doesn't fit. Option E is 47, which is a possible number for some organisms, like humans. Wait, no, wait, humans are diploid with 46. 

Wait, wait. Let's make sure. Humans have 23 pairs, so 23 x 2 = 46 chromosomes in a diploid cell. So the diploid number is 46. So looking at the options, the correct answer should be 46. Looking at the options, option H is 46. But wait, let me make sure about the options. 

Option H is 46. That's the correct answer. Because the normal human has 46 chromosomes in each diploid cell. So the answer is H.

The correct answer is H: 46.
