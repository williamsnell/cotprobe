Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychotherapies and whether self-disclosure by the psychologist is a recommended technique. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which therapy specifically uses self-disclosure as a recommended technique. The options are A through J, each corresponding to a different therapy. I need to recall what each of these therapies entails and whether self-disclosure is a part of them.

First, I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: Object relations therapy. From what I remember, Object relations therapy focuses on the relationships between objects and the subject. It's more about emotional bonds and objectification. I don't think they do much with self-disclosure; they might be more about structure and emotional connections rather than letting go of thoughts or feelings.

Option B: Play Therapy. I know Play Therapy is about creating play and letting go of negative thought patterns. It's a therapeutic approach where children play and adults engage in self-discovery. So yes, they probably use self-disclosure as a technique here.

Option C: Interpersonal therapy. This is a broad category that includes a lot of therapeutic approaches. It focuses on communication and emotional connections. I believe interpersonal therapy does involve self-disclosure, as it's about understanding and expressing thoughts and feelings.

Option D: Narrative Therapy. This involves storytelling and helping people express their experiences. They might discuss their thoughts and feelings, which could involve self-disclosure. But I'm not certain if this is a specific technique recommended for self-disclosure.

Option E: Transactional Analysis. I think this therapy is all about letting go of attachment and finding balance. It's a form of interpersonal therapy that often emphasizes self-discovery and letting go of controlled thoughts. So yes, self-disclosure is a key part here.

Option F: Dialectical Behavior Therapy. This therapy focuses on behavioral changes by challenging and modifying behavior through thought processes. I don't recall Dialectical Behavior Therapy using self-disclosure as much; more about behavioral correction and retraining.

Option G: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. CBT is about identifying and changing negative thought patterns. They use techniques like object elimination and self-talk, which could involve self-disclosure as part of addressing negative thoughts.

Option H: Feminist psychotherapy. This is a more recent and specific approach, focusing on gender and power dynamics in therapy. It might involve discussing self-discovery from a feminist perspective but I don't remember it using self-disclosure as a primary technique.

Option I: Gestalt Therapy. I'm not familiar with Gestalt as a main therapy, but I know it's about creating structures and patterns. It might not involve self-disclosure.

Option J: Exposure Therapy. This is about gradually exposing clients to their fears and behaviors. It's more about acceptance rather than self-disclosure as per the question's focus.

So, looking back, Play Therapy (B), Interpersonal Therapy (C), Transactional Analysis (E), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (G), and Exposure Therapy (J) are all possible candidates. But the question is asking for a specific technique that is recommended and frequently applied.

Wait, the options are asking which one is specifically recommended. Play Therapy is a broad approach where self-disclosure is a key part because it's about letting go of negative thoughts. Transactional Analysis is also about letting go and exploring, so self-disclosure is a frequent technique. CBT might involve, but I'm not sure if it's more commonly used as a specific recommended technique.

Looking at the options, the question is looking for the most specific technique where self-disclosure is a recommended and frequently applied method. Play Therapy fits this because it's a therapeutic approach where they let go of negative thoughts. While Transactional Analysis is also a form of interpersonal therapy, the question is about psychotherapies in general, so Play Therapy is the best fit.
