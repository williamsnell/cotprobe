Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A researcher planning a survey of school principals in a particular state has lists of the school principals employed in each of the 125 school districts. The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?

Options:

A: This is a purposive sampling, where the researcher only selects individuals that meet specific characteristics.
B: This is a non-probability sampling, where the samples are gathered in a process that does not give all the individuals in the population equal chances of being selected.
C: This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.
D: This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.
E: This is a convenience sampling, where the researcher chooses the easiest group to reach.
F: This is a snowball sampling, where existing study subjects recruit future subjects.
G: This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.
H: This is a quota sampling, where the researcher ensures equal representation of each district.
I: This is a sequential sampling, where sampling continues until a certain criteria is met.
J: This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about sampling methods, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me go through it step by step.

The question says that a researcher is planning a survey of school principals in a particular state. They have lists from each of the 125 school districts. The main point is that instead of randomly selecting from all the lists together, the researcher is selecting a random sample from each district. The question is asking which of the given options is correct.

I need to recall what each sampling method entails.

First, the options:

A: Purposive samplingâ€”this is when you select based on specific traits. Like, only certain characteristics are chosen. That doesn't sound right because the researcher is choosing randomly from each district.

B: Non-probability sampling. Non-probability samples don't give each individual the same chance. This method is often used when it's not feasible to get a simple random sample, but the key is that it's not random. The researcher is using a random sample from each district, which sounds more like probability sampling, not non-probability. So B might not be correct.

C: Stratified sample. Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) and then randomly sampling from each. So if they randomly sample from each district, that's similar to stratified. But wait, each district is a cluster here, so it might actually be cluster sampling, not stratified. So I'm not sure C is correct yet.

D: Cluster sample. This is when the population is divided into clusters, and you randomly select some clusters. But the question says they're using a random sample from each district. So if each district is a cluster, and you select one from each, that's cluster sampling. But is the method described here cluster sampling? Or is it another type of sampling?

E: Convenience sampling. That's when you sample people who are easiest to reach. The researcher is choosing based on convenience, but the question says they're using a random sample, which is more likely probability.

F: Snowball sampling. This is when existing subjects recruit others. So if the researcher already sampled some principals, they might recruit others, which is different from random selection.

G: Systematic sampling. This is where you select every nth individual from a list. The key here is that the original order isn't related to the variables, which is correct. But the question is about random sampling, not systematic. So G might not be the right answer.

H: Quota sampling. That's when you ensure certain characteristics are represented. But the researcher is choosing randomly, so it's not quota. So H is incorrect.

I: Sequential sampling. That's when you keep sampling until a certain condition is met. Doesn't fit here.

J: Simple random sample. This is when each individual has an equal chance. But in this case, they're using a random sample from each district, which is a different approach than simple random sampling. So J is not correct.

Wait, let's go back. The question says the researcher is obtaining a random sample from each district. So that's similar to cluster sampling because each district is a cluster. But in cluster sampling, you randomly select clusters (districts) and then sample from those clusters (pick a principal from each selected district). So this is cluster sampling, which is option D.

Wait, but the options are from A to J. Let me recheck the options. Option D says: "This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters." Yes, that fits. Because each district is a cluster, and they're sampling from each cluster.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the question says the researcher is obtaining a random sample from each district. So each district is a cluster, and they're randomly selecting one from each. So that's cluster sampling, yes. So the answer should be D.
</think>

The researcher is using a random sample from each of the 125 school districts, which suggests a method where the population is divided into clusters (districts), and samples are taken from these clusters. This is characteristic of cluster sampling. 

- **Option D** correctly describes this as a cluster sample, as the districts are heterogeneous groups selected randomly, and each has the same chance of being chosen. 

ANSWER: D
