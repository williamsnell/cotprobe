Okay, so I've got this problem here about Trish's resting heart rate and how her exercise affects it. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says Trish's resting heart rate is 50 beats per minute. Every minute she exercises, her heart rate increases by 5 beats per minute. I need to find out how long it will take her to reach 120 beats per minute. The options are A to J, with various time values. 

First, I think I should figure out the total increase needed from her resting rate to the target. So, her resting rate is 50, and she wants to get to 120. Let me subtract 50 from 120. That's 70 beats per minute needed. 

Now, each minute of exercise adds 5 beats. So, I need to find out how many minutes it takes for 5 beats per minute to add up to 70 beats. That sounds like a division problem. I'll take the total needed increase and divide it by the increase per minute. 

So, 70 divided by 5 equals... let's see, 5 times 14 is 70. So that's 14 minutes. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 14 minutes. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Could there be any factors I'm missing, like maybe rounding or something else? The question says "how long will it take," and the calculation is straightforward. She increases by 5 each minute, so it's a linear increase. 

Let me double-check the arithmetic. 50 plus 5 per minute. So after 1 min: 55, 2:60, 3:65, 4:70, 5:75, 6:80, 7:85, 8:90, 9:95, 10:100, 11:105, 12:110, 13:115, 14:120. Yeah, that's exactly 14 minutes. So option B is correct.

The problem requires calculating the time needed for Trish's heart rate to reach 120 from 50, with a 5-point increase per minute. Subtracting 50 from 120 gives 70 points needed. Dividing 70 by 5 (5 per minute) yields 14 minutes. The correct answer is B.

Answer: B
