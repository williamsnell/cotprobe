Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the main nitrogenous compound in urine, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step.

First, I remember that urine is the fluid produced when the kidneys filter the blood. It contains various substances that help the body get rid of excess fluids, waste, and substances like nitrogen. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact components, so I need to think carefully.

The options are A to J. Let me look at each one. 

Option A is Uric acid. I recall that uric acid is a byproduct of the breakdown of urine. I think it's involved in the synthesis of ammonia, so it's definitely not the main one.

Option B is Nitrous Oxide. Wait, isn't that a toxic gas? I remember that it's a byproduct in the urea cycle. So I don't think it's the main compound in urine.

Option C is Nitric Acid. Wait, isn't that a strong acid and a byproduct too? I think it's involved in the urea cycle, but not the main nitrogenous compound.

Option D is Nitrites. Nitrites are nitrogen containing compounds with two nitrogen atoms. I'm not sure, but I recall that ammonia is a byproduct, and maybe there's some nitrogenous compound there. I think ammonia is involved, but I'm not certain if it's the main one.

Option E is Nitrogen. Nitrogen is a gas, but I'm not sure if it's considered a compound. Wait, nitrogen is just an element, right? So maybe not a compound. Or perhaps the question refers to nitrogen-containing compounds, so maybe E is not the right answer.

Option F is Urethane. I think urethane is a non-essential amino acid, used in drugs. So it's not a compound in urine.

Option G is amino Acids. While amino acids are present in urine, they are not the main nitrogenous compound. They're present in small amounts.

Option H is Urea. Oh wait, urea is definitely a nitrogenous compound. I remember that in the urea cycle, ammonia is converted into urea. So H is an option.

Option I is Creatinine. Creatinine is a waste product, but I don't think it's a nitrogenous compound.

Option J is Ammonia. Ammonia is definitely present in urine, but it's not the main nitrogenous compound. Urea is more prominent.

So putting it all together, the main nitrogenous compound in urine is urea (H).

The main nitrogenous compound in urine is urea.
