Okay, so I have this biology question here about meiosis and chromosome numbers. Hmm, I remember that meiosis is a process where a cell divides its chromosomes to produce gametes. But wait, the question is a bit tricky. Let me think.

The question says the organism has a diploid number of 2n = 96. Oh right, in diploid cells, n is the haploid number, which is half the total number of chromosomes. So n would be 48 because 48 times 2 is 96. That makes sense.

Now, meiosis involves two main stages: meiosis I and meiosis II. In meiosis I, the chromosome number gets halved because each chromosome pairs with its homolog. So, each daughter cell gets half of the original number. So from 96, after meiosis I, each cell would have 48 chromosomes. But wait, what about meiosis II?

In meiosis II, the chromosomes separate, so each daughter cell ends up with 48 chromosomes. So after meiosis II, each cell has 48. But wait, the question is about the cells after meiosis. So the process would result in cells with 48 chromosomes each. 

Wait, but meiosis is a division process, so the cells after meiosis are called gametes, and each gamete has half the number of chromosomes. So the cells would have 48. Looking at the options, option I is 96, which is the original n. Option E is 192, which is double the original. So that's not right. I think the correct answer is 48, which is option J.

Wait, but another thought: the question asks what the cells have after meiosis. So in the organism's cells, after meiosis, each cell has half the number of chromosomes. So 96 divided by 2 is 48.

So looking at the options, option J is 48. So that's the correct answer.

The organism has a diploid number of 2n = 96, so the haploid number n is 48. During meiosis, the chromosome number is halved in both meiosis I and II. After meiosis, each resulting cell has 48 chromosomes. Among the options, the correct answer is 48.

Answer: J
