Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I need to determine whether an argument is valid using indirect truth tables. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The argument is:

E ⊃ F
G ⊃ ~F
/ ~G ∨ ~E

Wait, that's a bit confusingly written. Let me parse it properly. So, the premises are E implies F, G implies not F, and the conclusion is that not G or not E. So, in symbols, that's:

1. E → F
2. G → ~F
3. ¬G ∨ ¬E

I need to determine if this argument is valid. If it's invalid, I have to find a counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Alright, indirect truth tables... I remember that indirect truth tables involve assuming the opposite of what you're trying to prove and seeing if it leads to a contradiction. If assuming the conclusion is false leads to something that's always true, then the original argument is valid. If it doesn't, then the argument is invalid.

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. So, to test the validity of the argument, I can set up a truth table for all possible truth values of the propositions involved. Then, for each row that makes all the premises true, I check if the conclusion is also true. If there's at least one row where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

So, the propositions are E, F, G. That means each can be T or F, leading to 8 possible combinations. I'll need to go through each combination and evaluate the truth values of all premises and the conclusion.

Let me list out all possible combinations:

1. E=T, F=T, G=T
2. E=T, F=T, G=F
3. E=T, F=F, G=T
4. E=T, F=F, G=F
5. E=F, F=T, G=T
6. E=F, F=T, G=F
7. E=F, F=F, G=T
8. E=F, F=F, G=F

Now, for each row, I'll evaluate E→F, G→~F, and then see if ~G∨~E is true or false.

Let me go through each row:

Row 1: E=T, F=T, G=T
- E→F: T→T = T
- G→~F: T→F = F
So, premises aren't all true here, so this row doesn't apply.

Row 2: E=T, F=T, G=F
- E→F: T→T = T
- G→~F: F→F = T (since F→F is T)
So, both premises are true. Now, the conclusion is ~G∨~E: G=F, so ~G=T; E=T, so ~E=F. So, T∨F = T. So, conclusion is T. So, this row doesn't make the argument invalid.

Row 3: E=T, F=F, G=T
- E→F: T→F = F
So, premises are not all T here, so this row is out.

Row 4: E=T, F=F, G=F
- E→F: T→F = F
Again, premises not all true, so skip.

Row 5: E=F, F=T, G=T
- E=F: F→T is T
- G→~F: T→~F=T → T→T= T (since F is False, ~F=T)
So, both premises are true. Now the conclusion is ~G∨~E: G=T → ~G=F; E=F→~E=T. So, F ∨ T = T. So, conclusion is T. So, no problem.

Row 6: E=F, F=T, G=F
- E=F: F→T is T
- G→~F: F=T → ~F=F → T→F=F
So, the second premise is F. So, premises not all true, skip.

Row 7: E=F, F=F, G=T
- E=F: F→F is T
- G→~F: F=F → ~F=T → T→T=T
So, premises are T, so check the conclusion. ~G∨~E: G=T → ~G=F; E=F→~E=T. So, F ∨ T = T. So, conclusion is T. No issue.

Row 8: E=F, F=F, G=F
- E=F: F→F is T
- G→~F: F=F → ~F=T → T→T=T
So, both premises are T. Now, the conclusion is ~G∨~E: G=F→~G=T; E=F→~E=T. So, T ∨ T = T. So, conclusion is T. Again, no invalidation.

Wait, so in all rows where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. That suggests that the argument is valid, right? Because there's no scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false.

But wait, am I missing something? Because sometimes when the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. Let me double-check each row where premises are true.

Looking back, the only row where the premises are true is row 2 and row 5. Because in row 2, both premises are T, and in row 5, both premises are T. So, in both cases, the conclusion is T. So, there's no case where premises are true and conclusion false. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Wait, but the options given are A to J. Let me check the options again. The question is whether the argument is invalid, and if so, which counterexample exists.

Wait, the options are A to J. So, the answer options are whether the argument is invalid and choose a counterexample.

Wait, but according to my analysis, the argument is valid. So, the correct answer would be E: Valid.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in evaluating the premises. Let me recheck the rows.

Wait, in row 2: E=T, F=T, G=F

E→F: T→T=T: True

G→~F: F=T, so ~F=F → G=F→F=F? Wait, G=F, so G→~F is F→F, which is T. So, both premises are T, and conclusion is T.

In row 5: E=F, F=T, G=T

E=F: F→T=T

G=T: G→~F → T→F=F

Wait, no, E=F is T, so F→T is T.

G=T: G→~F → T→F=F

Wait, but the premise 2 is G→~F. So in row5, G=T, so G→~F is F→F=F? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, G→~F is equivalent to (G=F) ∨ (~F). So, when G=T and F=T, then G→~F is F→F=F. So, in row5, premise2 is F, so the premises aren't both T. Wait, that contradicts my earlier assessment.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, the premises are:

1. E→F
2. G→~F
3. Conclusion: ~G∨~E

So, in row5: E=F, F=T, G=T.

E→F: F is T, E is F → T→T=T.

G→~F: G is T, ~F is F → T→F=F. So, premise2 is F, so the premises are not all T. So, the conclusion would be ~G∨~E: G=T → F; E=F→T. So, F∨T=T. So, conclusion is T.

So, in that case, in row5, premises are E→F=T and G→~F=F, so not both premises T. Therefore, the conclusion is T.

Wait, so in all the rows where both premises are T, the conclusion is T. So, the argument is valid. So, the answer would be E: Valid.

Wait, but let me check another row where maybe the premises are T but the conclusion is F. If such a row exists, then the argument is invalid.

Wait, looking at the rows again:

I think I might have missed a row where both premises are T and the conclusion is F. Let me check each row again.

Row 2: E=T, F=T, G=F

Premises are both T, conclusion is T.

Row 5: E=F, F=T, G=T

Premises: E→F=T, G→~F=F. So, premises are not both T. Conclusion is T.

Are there any other rows where both premises are true?

In row 6: E=F, F=T, G=F.

E=F: T→F=T

G=F: F→~F=T (since ~F is T). So, G→~F is T→T=T. So, premises are both T. Conclusion: ~G ∨ ~E → G=F → T; E=F→T. So, T ∨ T=T. So, conclusion is T.

Row 6: both premises T, conclusion T.

Row 7: E=F, F=F, G=T.

E=F: F→F=T

G=T: G→~F → T → T=F? Wait, no, G=T, ~F=T → T→T=T. So, both premises are T. Conclusion: ~G=T, ~E=T. So, T∨T=T.

So, conclusion is T.

Row 8: E=F, F=F, G=F.

E=F: F→F=T

G=F: F→~F → F→T=T. So, both premises are T. Conclusion: ~G=T, ~E=T. So, T∨T=T.

So, in all the rows where premises are T, the conclusion is T. So, the argument is valid.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options are A to J, and I thought the answer was E: Valid. But in the options, E is a possible answer, but let me think again.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the truth table. Let me think of another approach. Maybe using logical equivalences.

The premises are E→F, G→~F, and conclusion: ~G∨~E.

Wait, perhaps we can derive the conclusion from the premises.

So, from E→F and G→~F, can we derive ~G∨~E?

Let me try:

We have G→~F. Also, E→F.

Let me assume ~E. Then, if E is false, anything follows. So, if E is false, then E→F is T, and the conclusion would be ~G∨T, which is T, which is okay.

Alternatively, if E is true, then from E→F, F must be true.

So, E→F and G→~F.

If E is true, then F is true. So, if E is true, F is true, but G→~F is G→F=F.

Which means that if E is true, then G must be false (because if G is true, then G→F=F would require F=F, which is a contradiction).

So, if E is true, then G must be false.

Therefore, if E is true, then G is false. So, in this case, ~E and G are both false, so ~G∨~E is T ∨ T = T.

If E is false, then E→F is T, regardless of F. So, the conclusion would be ~G∨T = T, which is also T.

So, in all cases, the conclusion is T. So, the argument is valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Valid.
</think>

The argument is valid because in all possible truth assignments where the premises E→F and G→~F are true, the conclusion ~G∨~E is also true. There is no scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. 

Answer: E: Valid
