Okay, so I have this question about Jaina temples and their appearance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through. 

I remember that the Jains are a religious group in India, right? They were followers of the Mahayana school of thought. I think they lived around the late 5th to early 8th centuries. But wait, the question is about when their temples appeared. So, are they the temples themselves, or just the religious group?

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the temples built by the Jains. So perhaps the answer is about when those temples were constructed. I think I've heard that the Jains are credited with building great temples like the Temple of Dhenkara in Deccan. They started building these structures around the 5th century CE. That makes sense because the 5th century is a significant time in Indian history, and Jains were active then.

Looking at the options, the first one is A: Eighteenth century CE. That doesn't fit because the 5th century is much earlier. Option B is the Eleventh century BCE, which would be the 11th century before the common era, but that period was a lot later, and I don't think Jains were around then. C is First century CE, which is too early, definitely not the Jains. 

Then D: Fifth century BCE. That's too early, like the 5th century in BC. E: Second century CE, that's after the Jains started building temples. F: Tenth century BCE, that's earlier than the Jains. G: Sixth century CE, that's still before the Jains. H: Third century BCE, again too early. I: Fifth century CE, that's when I think the Jains built their temples. J: Eighth century CE, which is even later, probably after the Jains.

So putting it together, the Jains built their temples around the 5th century CE, which is option I. That must be the correct answer.
