Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of an electron. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of the particle. Let me think about the steps I need to take.

Wait, the question says the kinetic energy is 50 eV. Oh right, the formula for de Broglie wavelength is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum. But wait, momentum is mass times velocity, so I need to find the velocity of the electron first.

But how do I find the velocity from the kinetic energy? Oh, right, the kinetic energy (KE) is given by (1/2)mv². The mass m here is the mass of an electron, which I think is approximately 9.11e-31 kg. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact value. Oh wait, sometimes when dealing with electrons, they're treated as having a rest mass of 0.511 MeV/c². But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, no, the kinetic energy is 50 eV. So I should probably use the kinetic energy formula to find the velocity. So KE = (1/2) mv². But I need to make sure about the units here. Let's see, since the energy is in eV, I might need to convert that into joules to use SI units.

Wait, maybe there's a better approach. I remember that the de Broglie wavelength can also be expressed in terms of the kinetic energy. Is there a formula that directly relates lambda to KE without needing to calculate velocity?

Oh right! There's a formula that λ = h / sqrt(2m KE), but wait, I'm not sure about the exact constants. Let me think. Another approach is to use the relativistic energy equation. But wait, for electrons, their rest mass energy is about 0.511 MeV, which is way higher than 50 eV. Oh, so the electron is moving at a speed close to the speed of light, so relativistic effects are important. Hmm, but maybe for this problem, the non-relativistic approach is acceptable. Because 50 eV is much smaller than the rest energy (which is about 511 keV), so the electron's speed isn't close to c, so non-relativistic KE is probably okay.

Wait, but wait, the non-relativistic formula is λ = h / sqrt(2m KE). Let me get the exact formula right. The non-relativistic equation for de Broglie wavelength is λ = h / sqrt(2m KE), but wait, let me check the units. Because h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s. So I need to ensure that KE is in joules.

So, 50 eV. Let me convert eV to joules. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 50 eV is 50 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-18 J.

Wait, but another way to express the de Broglie wavelength is using the relation λ = h / sqrt(2m KE). So plugging the numbers in.

But wait, let me make sure I have the formula correct. The correct formula is lambda = h / sqrt(2m E), where E is the kinetic energy. Wait, but in some sources, it's written as λ = h / sqrt(2m E) when E is in eV. Or does it require some conversion?

Wait, let me get the exact formula. Another way is: λ = h / (sqrt(2mK)), where K is the kinetic energy in joules. So I'll proceed with that.

So h is 6.626e-34 J·s. m is 9.11e-31 kg. K is 50 eV, which is 8.01e-18 J.

So plugging in:

lambda = 6.626e-34 / sqrt( 2 * 9.11e-31 kg * 8.01e-18 J )

First compute the denominator.

2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30.

Multiply by 8.01e-18: 1.822e-30 *8.01e-18 = 1.461e-47.

Take the square root of that: sqrt(1.461e-47) = approximately 3.822e-24.

Now, divide h by that:

6.626e-34 / 3.822e-24 = approximately 1.73e-10 meters.

Wait, 1e-10 meters is 0.1 nm, since 1 nm is 1e-9 meters. So 1.73e-10 meters is 0.173 nm.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.17. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait, another approach: sometimes, people use the formula λ = h/(p) where p is the momentum, and p = sqrt(2m K). So that's the same as what I did. So the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, let me think about units. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake converting eV to J. Let me double-check that part.

50 eV is 50 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-18 J. Yes.

Denominator: 2 * 9.11e-31 kg * 8.01e-18 J = 2*9.11e-31*8.01e-18 = let's compute 9.11*8.01 = approx 73. So 2*73e-49 = 146e-49? Wait, wait, 9.11e-31 *8.01e-18 =  (9.11 *8.01)e-49 = approx 73.0e-49. Multiply by 2, 146e-49. Take square root: sqrt(146e-49) = sqrt(1.46e-47) ) because 146e-49 is 1.46e-47 (since 146 is 1.46e2, but 1e2 *1e-49 is 1e-47). So sqrt(1.46e-47 )= sqrt(1.46) * sqrt(1e-47 )= approx 1.208 * 1e-23.5. Wait, 1e-47 is (1e-23.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-47) is 1e-23.5 = 3.16e-24. So 1.208 *3.16e-24 is approximately 3.82e-24. Then, 6.626e-34 / 3.82e-24 = approx 1.73e-10 meters. Which is 0.173 nm. So about 0.17 nm, which is option G.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 50 eV, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mK}}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of an electron),
- \( K = 50 \, \text{eV} = 8.01 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \) (kinetic energy in joules).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
\[
\sqrt{2mK} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-18}}
\]

First, calculate the product inside the square root:
\[
2 \cdot 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 1.822 \times 10^{-30}
\]
\[
1.822 \times 10^{-30} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-18} = 1.461 \times 10^{-47}
\]

Now, take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1.461 \times 10^{-47}} = 3.822 \times 10^{-24}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the wavelength
\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{3.822 \times 10^{-24}}
\]

Simplify the division:
\[
\lambda \approx 1.73 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Convert to nanometers
Since \( 1 \, \text{nm} = 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \):
\[
\lambda \approx 0.173 \, \text{nm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to \( 0.173 \, \text{nm} \) is **0.17 nm**. Therefore, the correct answer is:
