Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve about concave mirrors. Hmm, let's see. I remember that concave mirrors can produce real images when the object is placed within the focal length. Oh wait, the problem says the object is 1 meter in front of a concave mirror. Wait, 1 meter is 100 cm, right? The radius of curvature is 30 cm. So the focal length f would be half of that, because for a concave mirror, f = R/2. So f is 15 cm.

Wait, the object is initially placed 100 cm in front of the mirror. Since the focal length is 15 cm, which is less than 100 cm, the object is outside the focal point. So the image will be real and inverted. But I think I should first calculate the initial image distance using the mirror equation.

Mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. So f is 15 cm, do is 100 cm. Let's plug in the values.

So 1/15 = 1/100 + 1/di. Let me solve for di.

1/di = 1/15 - 1/100. Let's compute that. 1/15 is approximately 0.0667, 1/100 is 0.01. So, 0.0667 - 0.01 = 0.0567. So 1/di = 0.0567 → di ≈ 17.63 cm. So the initial image is 17.63 cm from the mirror.

The question says to move the image 15 cm farther away. Wait, does that mean the image is moved to a distance of 17.63 +15 = 32.63 cm? Or does it mean the object is moved? I need to clarify the question. The image is initially 17.63 cm from the mirror. How to move it 15 cm further away? Oh, the image is being moved farther away from the mirror. So di → di + 15 cm. But wait, no, the question says 'move the image 15 cm farther away from the mirror'. So the new di is di_initial plus 15 cm? Or is it di_new = di_initial + 15 cm?

Wait, the initial di is 17.63. So moving it 15 cm further would make di_new = 17.63 +15 = 32.63 cm. Wait, but that's the image distance. But the question is about moving the object, not the image. Oh, wait the problem says, "it is required to move the image 15 cm farther away from the mirror." So the new image distance is di_initial +15 cm. So di_new = 17.63 +15 =32.63 cm.

So now, what's the new object distance, do_new, using the mirror equation again. Because with the same mirror, f remains 15 cm. So 1/f = 1/do_new + 1/di_new.

So plug in the numbers: 1/15 = 1/do_new + 1/32.63.

Compute 1/15 = 0.0667, 1/32.63 ≈ 0.0306. So 0.0667 - 0.0306 = 0.0361 → 1/do_new = 0.0361 → do_new ≈ 27.71 cm. Hmm, because 1/27.71 is approximately 0.0361.

Wait, that's 27.71 cm. So the object is now placed 27.71 cm from the mirror. But the original object was 100 cm away, which is 72.29 cm further away. Wait, that can't be right. Because if the object moves closer, but the image is moving further, which is a bit counterintuitive. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate the initial image distance. The object is 100 cm in front of the mirror (do = 100 cm). f is 15 cm. So 1/f = 1/100 + 1/di → 1/di = 1/15 - 1/100.

Compute 1/15 - 1/100. 1/15 is 0.066667, 1/100 is 0.01. So 0.066667-0.01 = 0.056667. So di = 1/0.056667 ≈ 17.63 cm. That's correct.

Now, the image is moved 15 cm farther, so di_final = 17.63 +15 = 32.63 cm.

Now, with f=15 cm, (1/f = 1/do + 1/di). So 1/15 = 1/do_new + 1/32.63.

1/32.63 is approximately 0.03064. So 1/do_new = 0.066667 -0.03064 ≈ 0.036027.

So do_new ≈ 1/0.036027 ≈ 27.75 cm.

Wait, so the object is now placed at 27.75 cm from the mirror. But the initial object was at 100 cm. So the object is moved closer. Because 27.75 cm is less than 100 cm. So the object is moved closer. Wait, let me compute the difference: 100 -27.75 =72.25 cm. So the object is moved 72.25 cm closer. But wait, the options: look at the choices.

Looking at the options, option H is 72.25 cm closer to the mirror. Option B is 27.75 cm closer. Option F is 100 cm closer. So, I think the correct answer is option H, because the object is moved 72.25 cm closer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because the image is moved 15 cm further away. So the new image distance is 32.63 cm. The object is now 27.75 cm. So the object is moved closer by 72.25 cm. So the answer would be H.

But wait, maybe I should double-check the calculation. Let me re-calculate the new object distance.

After moving the image, di is 32.63 cm.

1/f = 1/15 + 1/di → 1/di = (1/15) - (1/32.63).

Compute 1/15 as 0.0666667, 1/32.63 is approximately 0.03064.

So, 0.0666667 -0.03064 = 0.0360267.

So do_new = 1/0.0360267 ≈ 27.75 cm. So yes, the object is moved from 100 cm to 27.75 cm → a movement of 72.25 cm closer. So the correct answer is H.

To solve the problem, we use the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the focal length
The radius of curvature \( R \) is 30 cm, so the focal length \( f \) is:

\[
f = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \, \text{cm}.
\]

### Step 2: Initial object distance and image distance
The object is initially placed at \( d_o = 100 \, \text{cm} \) (converted to cm). Using the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{d_i}.
\]

Solve for \( d_i \):

\[
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{15} - \frac{1}{100} = 0.0667 - 0.01 = 0.0567,
\]

\[
d_i = \frac{1}{0.0567} \approx 17.63 \, \text{cm}.
\]

The initial image distance is \( d_i = 17.63 \, \text{cm} \).

### Step 3: New image distance
The problem requires the image to be moved 15 cm farther away. Thus, the new image distance is:

\[
d_i = 17.63 + 15 = 32.63 \, \text{cm}.
\]

### Step 4: New object distance
Using the mirror equation again with the new image distance \( d_i = 32.63 \, \text{cm} \) and \( f = 15 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
\frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{32.63}.
\]

Solve for \( d_o \):

\[
\frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{1}{15} - \frac{1}{32.63} = 0.0667 - 0.0306 = 0.0361,
\]

\[
d_o = \frac{1}{0.0361} \approx 27.75 \, \text{cm}.
\]

### Step 5: Change in object distance
The initial object distance was \( d_o = 100 \, \text{cm} \), and the new object distance is \( d_o = 27.75 \, \text{cm} \). The change in object distance is:

\[
\Delta d_o = 100 - 27.75 = 72.25 \, \text{cm}.
\]

This indicates that the object is moved 72.25 cm closer to the mirror.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**H: 72.25 cm closer to the mirror**
