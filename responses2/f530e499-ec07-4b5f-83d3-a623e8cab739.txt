Okay, so I have this problem here about a complex number z = a + bi, where a and b are positive integers. The condition is that z³ + z² + z is a real number. I need to find the smallest possible value for b, and the options are given as A through J. 

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the question is asking. A complex number z is given, and when you compute z³ + z² + z, the result is a real number. That means the imaginary part of this expression must be zero. So, I should probably expand z³, z², and z and then separate the real and imaginary parts, setting the imaginary part to zero. That should give me an equation involving a and b, which I can then solve to find the smallest possible b.

Let me write down z, z², and z³. 

z = a + bi.

z² = (a + bi)² = a² + 2abi + (bi)² = a² + 2abi - b², since i² = -1. So, z² = (a² - b²) + 2ab i.

Similarly, z³ is z² multiplied by z: 

z³ = (a + bi)(z²) = (a + bi)(a² - b² + 2abi) 

Let me multiply this out:

First, multiply a by each term: a*(a² - b²) + a*(2abi) = a³ - a b² + 2a² b i.

Then multiply bi by each term: bi*(a² - b²) + bi*(2abi) = b i (a² - b²) + 2a b² i². 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's do it step by step.

z³ = (a + bi)(a² - b² + 2abi)
= a*(a² - b²) + a*(2ab i) + bi*(a² - b²) + bi*(2ab i)
= [a³ - a b²] + [2a² b i] + [b a² - b³ i] + [2a b² i²]

Now, i² is -1, so the last term becomes 2a b² * (-1) = -2a b².

So, combining all terms:

Real parts: (a³ - a b²) + (b a² - b³) + (-2a b²)
Imaginary parts: (2a² b) i + (-b a² + b³) i

Wait, no, perhaps I should collect the real and imaginary parts correctly.

Wait, let me do it again more carefully.

z³ = (a + bi)(a² - b² + 2abi) 

Multiply term by term:

First term: a*(a² - b²) = a³ - a b².

Second term: a*(2ab i) = 2a² b i.

Third term: bi*(a² - b²) = b a² i - b³ i.

Fourth term: bi*(2ab i) = 2a b² i².

Now, I'll collect the real and imaginary parts.

Real parts: (a³ - a b²) + (b a² - b³ i from the third term? No, wait: the third term is 2a² b i, which is imaginary, and the fourth term is 2a b² * (-1) because i² is -1. So, 2a b²*(-1) = -2a b², which is real.

So, real parts are:

(a³ - a b²) + (b a² - 2a b²) 

Wait, no, wait: wait, the third term is bi*(a² - b²) = b a² i - b³ i, so it's the imaginary part, so it's 2a² b i - b³ i. But when adding up all the terms, the real parts are:

a³ - a b² (from first term) 

Plus b a² (from the third term's real part) 

Minus 2a b² (from the fourth term) 

Wait, no. Let me add them:

Real parts: 

- From the first term: a³ - a b² (this is real)
- From the third term: b a² (the real part is b a², because it's b a² i, which is imaginary. So the real part is zero here.)
Wait, no: the third term is (b a² i - b³ i), which is imaginary. So, no real part from the third term.

Wait, perhaps I should list all real and imaginary parts separately.

So, real parts:

1. a*(a² - b²) = a³ - a b² 

2. bi*( - 2ab i) → wait, no. Wait, let me redo this.

Wait, z³ = (a + bi)(a² - b² + 2abi)

Let me compute each multiplication:

First, a * (a² - b²) = a³ - a b². This is real.

a * 2ab i = 2a² b i. Imaginary.

bi * (a² - b²) = b a² i - b³ i. Both terms are imaginary.

bi * 2ab i = 2a b² i² = 2a b² (-1) = -2a b². Real.

So, now, adding up all real parts:

From the first term: a³ - a b².

From the last term: -2a b².

So total real parts: a³ - a b² - 2a b² = a³ - 3a b².

Imaginary parts:

From a * 2ab i = 2a² b i.

From bi * a² - b² i = (b a² - b³) i.

Wait, no: bi * (a² - b²) is b a² i - b³ i. So, total imaginary from these terms is (b a² - b³) i.

And then, from bi * 2ab i, which is 2a b² i² = -2a b².

So, the imaginary parts are:

2a² b i + (b a² - b³) i -2a b².

Wait, no, wait: let me list all the imaginary terms.

1. a * 2ab i = 2a² b i.

2. bi * a² i = b a² i² = -b a².

3. bi * (-b²) i = -b³ i² = b³.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate. Let me make a table.

When multiplying (a + bi) by (c + di), the imaginary part is a*d + b*c. So, for z³:

The terms that contribute to the imaginary part are:

- a multiplied by the imaginary part of z² (which is 2ab) → 2a² b i.

- bi multiplied by the real part of z² (which is (a² - b²)) → bi*(a² - b²) = (a² - b²)b i.

So, the total imaginary part is 2a² b i + (a² - b²) b i.

Wait, but wait: the last term is bi*(a² - b²) which is (a² - b²)b i. So, all together, the imaginary part is:

2a² b i + (a² - b²) b i = [2a² b + a² b - b³] i = (3a² b - b³) i.

Plus, any other terms? No, because the last term is the b² i², which is -b², which is real.

So, to summarize, z³ is:

Real part: a³ - 3a b².

Imaginary part: (3a² b - b³) i.

Ok, so now let's write down z³ + z² + z.

We have:

z³ = (a³ - 3a b²) + (3a² b - b³) i.

z² = (a² - b²) + 2ab i.

z = a + bi.

So, adding them together:

Real parts: (a³ - 3a b²) + (a² - b²) + a.

Imaginary parts: (3a² b - b³) + 2ab + b.

So, combining real and imaginary parts:

Real part: a³ - 3a b² + a² - b² + a.

Imaginary part: 3a² b - b³ + 2ab + b.

Now, the problem states that z³ + z² + z is a real number. That means the imaginary part must be zero.

So, set the imaginary part equal to zero:

3a² b - b³ + 2ab + b = 0.

Factor out b:

b (3a² - b² + 2a + 1) = 0.

Since b is a positive integer, it can't be zero. So, the other factor must be zero:

3a² - b² + 2a + 1 = 0.

So, 3a² + 2a + 1 = b².

So, b² = 3a² + 2a + 1.

We need to find positive integers a and b such that this equation holds, and we need to find the smallest possible b.

So, our goal is to find the smallest b where b² = 3a² + 2a + 1.

We can think of this as finding integer solutions (a, b) where b² equals that quadratic in a.

Since a and b are positive integers, let's try small a values and see if 3a² + 2a +1 is a perfect square.

Let me start with a=1:

3(1)^2 + 2(1) +1 = 3 + 2 +1 =6. Is 6 a perfect square? No, because 2² is 4, 3² is 9.

a=2:

3*(4) +4 +1= 12+4+1=17. Not a square.

a=3:

3*9 +6 +1= 27+6+1=34. Not a square.

a=4:

3*16 +8 +1=48+8+1=57. Not a square.

a=5:

3*25 +10 +1=75+10+1=86. Not square.

a=6:

3*36=108 +12+1=121. Oh! 121 is 11². So b=11.

Wait, let me check this. 3(6)^2 + 2*6 +1 = 3*36=108 +12=120 +1=121. Yes, 11²=121. So b=11.

Wait, but I should check if there are smaller b's before a=6.

a=1: 6, not square.

a=2:17, nope.

a=3:34, no.

a=4:57, no.

a=5:86, no.

a=6:121, yes.

So the smallest b is 11.

Looking at the options, option C is 11. So, the answer should be C:11.
