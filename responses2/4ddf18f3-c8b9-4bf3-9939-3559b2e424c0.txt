Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about specific rotation. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that a solution has 6.15 grams of cholesterol per 100 ml. When a portion of this solution was placed in a 5-cm polarimeter tube, the observed rotation is -1.2 degrees. I need to find the specific rotation of cholesterol. The options are given from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that specific rotation is a measure of how much a chiral substance rotates plane-polarized light. The formula I think is specific rotation equals the observed rotation divided by the concentration. Oh wait, right, the formula is ω = ξ / c, where ω is specific rotation, ξ is the observed rotation, and c is the concentration.

But wait, the concentration here is given in grams per 100 ml. Oh, right, and because specific rotation is a molar quantity, I need to convert grams per 100 ml to molarity. So let's think about that.

First, the concentration c is 6.15 g/100 ml. To get that into grams per liter, I multiply by 10, because 100 ml is 0.1 liters. So 6.15 g/100 ml = 61.5 g/L. But wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think. 100ml is 0.1 L, so 6.15 g in 0.1 L is 6.15 * 10 g/L, which is 61.5 g/L. Yes, because 1 L is 1000 ml, so 6.15 g * (1000 ml / 100 ml) = 6.15 * 10 = 61.5 g/L.

Wait, but for specific rotation, the units are specific rotation per mole. So I need to find the number of moles per liter. Because specific rotation is per mole.

Wait, but how do I get moles from grams? I think I need the molar mass of cholesterol. I remember that the molar mass of cholesterol is about 386.6 g/mol. Let me double-check that. I think it's 386.6 g/mol. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So, concentration c is 61.5 g/L divided by molar mass (386.6 g/mol) to get moles per liter. 

So, moles per liter = 61.5 g/L / 386.6 g/mol = let's calculate that. 61.5 divided by 386.6 is approximately 0.1597 mol/L, which is about 0.1597 M.

Wait, let me compute it accurately: 61.5 / 386.6.

Let me do 61.5 ÷ 386.6. 

Well, 386.6 * 0.159 is about 61.445. So 0.159 gives 61.445, which is very close to 61.5. So approximately 0.159 mol/L.

So c ≈ 0.159 mol/L.

Now, the observed rotation is ξ = -1.2 degrees. The specific rotation ω is ξ divided by c. So ω = (-1.2) / (0.159) ≈ -7.568 deg/(mol·L).

Wait, but the options don't have that. The options are A: -1.2, B: -0.5, C: -6.15, D: -39.02. Hmm, so none match exactly. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let's go back. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of concentration.

Wait, the solution is 6.15 g per 100 ml. So that's 6.15 g / 0.1 L = 61.5 g/L. That's correct.

Then, the molar mass of cholesterol is about 386.6 g/mol. So 61.5 / 386.6 = 0.1597 mol/L.

So c = 0.1597 mol/L. So ξ = -1.2 °, so ω = ξ / c = -1.2 / 0.1597. Let me compute that.

So 1.2 / 0.1597 is approximately 7.568. So ω is -7.568, which is about -7.57.

Looking at the options, none of them have -7.57. So I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, specific rotation is sometimes expressed in terms of degrees per mole per liter. So the formula is correct: ω = ξ / c.

Wait, but wait, the options have option C as -6.15, which is 6.15, but I got 7.56. So none match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact calculation.

Compute 61.5 / 386.6:

386.6 × 0.159 = 386.6 * 0.1 = 38.66; 386.6 * 0.05 = 19.33; 386.6 * 0.009 = 3.4794. Add them: 38.66 +19.33 =57.99, +3.4794 =61.4694. Which is approximately 61.4694, and 61.5 is about 0.0306 more. So 0.159 + (0.0306)/(386.6) ≈ 0.159 + 0.0000786 ≈ 0.1590786. So c ≈ 0.159079 mol/L.

So 1.2 /0.159079 ≈ 7.568. So about -7.568.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: -1.2o

B: -0.5o

C: -6.15o

D: -39.02o

So none match. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration calculation.

Wait, maybe the concentration was 6.15 g per 100 ml, not per liter. Oh wait, no, because for concentration, we're considering per liter. So 6.15 g per 100 ml is 61.5 g per liter. So my calculation is correct.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the molar mass. Let me double-check that.

Wait, cholesterol's molar mass is indeed about 386.6 g/mol. I think that's correct. Let me think: 

Cholesterol is C19H43O2. So 19*12=228, 43*1=43, 2*16=32. So 228+43=271 +32=303. No wait, wait—wait, 19×12=228, 43×1=43, 16×2=32. So 228+43=271, 271+32=303. Oh wait, no, I think I'm missing something. Wait, wait, 19×12=228, 43×1=43, 16×2=32. So 228+43=271, plus 32 is 303. But wait, that's for 19 carbons, 43 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. So the molar mass is 19×12 + 43×1 + 2×16 = 228 +43 +32= 303 g/mol. Oh! Wait a second, I thought it was 386.6. Hmm, that might be where I was wrong. Oh wait, so I must have made a mistake in the molar mass calculation.

Wait, wait, 19×12 is 228. 43×1 is 43. 2×16 is 32. So total is 228+43=271, plus 32 is 303. So the molar mass is 303 g/mol. So I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. That must have thrown off the entire calculation.

So correct molar mass is 303 g/mol.

So now, c is 61.5 g/L. Divided by 303 g/mol gives moles per liter.

So 61.5 / 303 = let's compute that. 303 × 0.2 is 60.6. So 0.2 mol/L would be 60.6 g. But we have 61.5, which is 0.9 g more. So each 0.01 mol is 303 ×0.01 = 3.03 g. So 0.9 /3.03 ≈ 0.2967 mol/L. So 0.2 mol/L plus 0.0967 mol/L is about 0.2967.

Wait, 0.2 mol/L is 60.6 g/L. 61.5 g/L is 0.9 g more. So 0.9 /303 = 0.002967 mol/L. So total is 0.2 + 0.002967 ≈ 0.202967 mol/L. Approximately 0.203 mol/L.

So c ≈ 0.203 mol/L.

Wait, but the observed rotation is ξ = -1.2°. So ω = ξ / c = (-1.2)/0.203 ≈ -5.918 degrees per mole.

So about -5.92°, which is approximately -5.92. Looking at the options, the closest is option B: -0.5, D: -39.02, and C: -6.15.

But none match. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the concentration. Let me recalculate 61.5 / 303.

61.5 ÷ 303.

Well, 303 × 0.2 is 60.6. So 61.5 – 60.6 is 0.9. So 0.9 /303 = 0.002967.

So 0.2 + 0.002967 = 0.202967 mol/L. So c is ~0.203 mol/L.

So ω = -1.2 / 0.203 ≈ -5.918 ≈ -5.92 degrees per mole.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The options are A: -1.2o, B: -0.5o, C: -6.15o, D: -39.02o.

So none match. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of the concentration? Let me double-check.

Wait wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration. Let me re-calculate 6.15 g/100ml. So 100ml is 0.1 L. 6.15 g in 0.1 L is 61.5 g/L. So that part is correct.

Wait, but maybe the concentration isn't 0.203 mol/L. Let me compute it again.

Molar mass of cholesterol is 303 g/mol. So 61.5 g /303 g/mol = 0.202967 mol/L. So yes, about 0.203.

So ω = -1.2 / 0.203 ≈ -5.918, which is approximately -5.92. None of the options match this. So perhaps I did something wrong in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the observed rotation is ξ = ω × c × l, where l is the path length. But in this problem, I don't think path length is given, so maybe it's under the assumption of a certain path length, like 1 cm. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the question. The solution was placed in a polarimeter tube. Polarimeter tubes are usually about 1 cm in length, so perhaps l is 1 cm. So, perhaps I need to consider that.

But wait, if the path length is 1 cm, then the calculation would be using cm. Let me see.

Wait, the formula is ξ = ω × c × l, where l is in cm. But in the formula, c is in mol/L, l is in cm, which is 0.01 m. So, perhaps that's a point I'm missing.

Wait, the formula is ξ (in degrees) = ω (in degrees per mole per liter) × c (mol/L) × l (cm).

Because 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So if l is in cm, I should convert it to meters or adjust the formula accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be ξ (in degrees) = ω (in degrees per mole per liter) × c (mol/L) × l (in cm) × (100 / 0.01) × (1/100) )).

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of units. Let me think again.

The specific rotation is defined as ω = ξ / (c × l), where ξ is in degrees, c in mol/L, and l in cm.

Wait, no. Wait, the definition is ω = ξ / (c × l), where l is in cm, and ξ is in degrees. Because when you measure rotation, you have ξ = ω × c × l. So ω = ξ/(c*l). So if l is in cm, and ξ is in degrees, the units would be degrees/(mol/L * cm) = (degree * L)/(mol * cm) = (degree * 1000 mm)/(mol * cm) = (degree * 10 mm)/(mol * cm) → Wait, maybe I'm complicating.

Wait, perhaps using the standard formula where ω is in degrees per mol per liter, and l is in cm. So if you have a rotation of ξ = ω × c × l, then ω = ξ/(c × l).

But let's check.

If the path length is 1 cm, then ω = ξ/(c × 1 cm) = ξ/(c * 0.01 m). Wait, perhaps mixing units is causing confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the path length l is 1 cm, so the formula ξ = ω × c × l, with l in cm, and c in mol/L.

So, if l is 1 cm, then ω = ξ/(c × l) = (-1.2)/ (0.203 * 1) = -5.918, which is about -5.92. Again, none of the options match.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation. Let me double-check that.

Wait, cholesterol's molecular formula is C19H43O2. So:

C: 19 × 12 = 228 g/mol.

H: 43 × 1 = 43 g/mol.

O: 2 × 16 =32 g/mol.

So 228 +43 =271 +32 =303 g/mol. So yes, correct.

So that's 303 g/mol. So that part is correct.

So, now, I'm stuck because the calculated specific rotation is about -5.92, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation. Let me recount.

Wait, 19 carbons: 19 ×12=228. 43 H:43×1=43. 2 O:2×16=32. So 228+43=271, +32=303. Yes, correct.

So, perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about the units again. Let me write the formula again: 

ω = ξ / (c × l), where ω is in degrees per mole per liter (deg/(mol·L)), ξ is in degrees, c in mol/L, l in cm.

So if the path length is 1 cm, then:

ω = (-1.2) / (0.203 mol/L × 1 cm) ) → (-1.2)/(0.203) ≈ -5.92.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration. Let me recalculate:

Concentration c = 6.15 g/100ml = 61.5 g/L.

Molar mass M = 303 g/mol.

So, c = 61.5 /303 = 0.202967 mol/L. So correct.

So, the calculated ω is about -5.92, which is approximately -6. But no option is exactly -6.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is -6.15. Which is about -6.15, but I calculated about -5.92. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed differently. Maybe the concentration is 6.15 g per 100 cm³, which is 0.0615 g/L. But that would change the calculation.

Wait, no, because the solution is 6.15 g per 100 ml. So 6.15 g per 0.1 L is 61.5 g/L. That's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is being done with the assumption that the concentration is 6.15 g per 100 cm³. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of specific rotation being expressed as (deg) per (mol per liter). So, perhaps the value is being rounded.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: -0.5, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the specific rotation is given as ξ = ω × (c × l), where l is in cm.

Wait, but in that case, the calculation would be:

ω = ξ/(c × l).

With l in cm.

But for the specific rotation, the formula is: ξ = ω × c × l. Where l is in cm.

So, if I rearrange, ω = ξ / (c × l).

But then, if the observed rotation is ξ = -1.2°, and l is 1 cm, then ω = -1.2 / (c × 1 cm).

But then, I need to calculate c in mol/L.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should use 6.15 g per 100 ml as 6.15 g per 100 cm³, which would be 0.0615 g/L. That's a much lower concentration.

Wait, let me try this approach.

If the solution is 6.15 g per 100 cm³, which is 0.0615 g/L.

So, c = 0.0615 g/L.

Molar mass is 303 g/mol.

So, c = 0.0615 / 303 = 0.0002027 mol/L.

So, c ≈ 2.027 ×10^-4 mol/L.

Then, ω = ξ / (c × l) = (-1.2) / ( (2.027e-4 mol/L) × 1 cm ) )

Wait, but units for ω are degrees/(mol·L) × cm. So cm is 0.01 m.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too confused. Let me think instead about the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the concentration is 6.15 g per 100 ml. So that's 6.15 g per 0.1 L = 61.5 g/L.

Then, molar mass is 303 g/mol.

So, c = 61.5 /303 = 0.202967 mol/L.

So, ω = ξ / c = (-1.2)/0.202967 = about -5.918, which is approximately -5.92.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option B: -0.5. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should have divided by 0.2 instead of 0.203.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with c = 0.2 mol/L, ignoring the 0.203.

Let me see: 61.5 /303 = 0.202967 mol/L.

If I incorrectly use 0.2, then ω =-1.2/0.2 =-6.0.

So, that would give ω =-6.0, which is exactly option C: -6.15. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, option C is -6.15. So, I'm getting -6.0, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I have to consider that the solution is placed in a polarimeter tube of 1 cm path length, but without that information, perhaps the calculation is to be done with 1 cm.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation, I'm supposed to use the formula without the path length. But that would give a different result.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ξ = ω × c × l, so ω = ξ/(c × l).

If I think of l as 1 cm, then ω = (-1.2)/(0.203 *1) = -5.92.

But that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the entire approach.

Let me think again: The specific rotation is a measure of how much a chiral compound rotates plane-polarized light. The formula is:

ω = ξ / (c × l),

where ω is in degrees per mole per liter (°/mol/L), ξ is in degrees, c in mol/L, and l in cm.

Wait, so in the problem, the observed rotation is ξ = -1.2°. The concentration c is 61.5 g/L, molar mass is 303 g/mol. So, c is 61.5 /303 =0.203 mol/L.

l is 1 cm.

So, ω = (-1.2) / (0.203 *1) = (-1.2)/0.203 ≈ -5.92.

So again, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option C: -6.15, which is approximately -6.15. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but perhaps I should proceed with the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: -0.5, but I'm not getting that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the exact value of 6.15 g per 100 ml.

So, 6.15 g /100 ml = 61.5 g/L.

Molar mass 303 g/mol.

c =61.5 /303 =0.202967 mol/L.

So, ω = -1.2 / (0.202967 × 1) ≈ -5.918, which is about -5.92.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Let me double-check.

Wait, 19 carbons: 19 ×12=228.

43 hydrogens: 43 ×1=43.

2 oxygens: 2 ×16=32.

Total=228+43=271 +32=303. Yes, correct.

So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is placed in a polarimeter tube of length 1 cm, but perhaps the molar mass is 386.6 g/mol, which would change the calculation.

Wait, if I use molar mass 386.6 g/mol, then:

c=61.5 /386.6 = approximately 0.1585 mol/L.

So, ω= (-1.2) / (0.1585 ×1) ≈ (-1.2)/0.1585 ≈ -7.56.

Which is approximately -7.56, which is close to option C: -6.15, but not the same.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C: -6.15. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation, but perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B: -0.5, but I'm not seeing how that would come about.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the concentration is 0.203 mol/L and l is 1 cm.

So, ω = (-1.2) / (0.203 × 1) = (-1.2) / 0.203 ≈ -5.918. So, approximately -5.92.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is option B: -0.5, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the specific rotation is calculated using the formula ω = (ξ) / (c × l).

So, if the solution is placed in a polarimeter tube of length l=1 cm, then the calculation is:

ω = ξ/(c × l) = (-1.2) / (0.203 ×1) ≈ -5.918.

So, about -5.92, which is approximately -6.0. So, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: -0.5, but that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the problem is that I have to consider that the solution is placed in a polarimeter tube of length 1 cm, but perhaps without that information, perhaps the calculation is to be done with 1 cm.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the path length is 1 cm. So, the calculation would be:

ω = (-1.2) / (0.203 × 1) = -5.918, which is approximately -5.92.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option C: -6.15, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think that perhaps the solution is placed in a 1 cm path length, and the molar mass is 303 g/mol, and the concentration is 0.2 mol/L.

Wait, if c is 0.2, then ω = (-1.2) / (0.2 ×1) )= -6.0.

So, that would give ω =-6.0. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option B: -0.5, but that's not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the conclusion.

The specific rotation of a chiral compound is defined as:

\[
\omega = \frac{\xi}{c \cdot l}
\]

where:
- \(\xi\) is the observed rotation in degrees,
- \(c\) is the concentration in mol/L,
- \(l\) is the path length in cm.

### Given Data:
- The solution contains 6.15 g of cholesterol per 100 mL.
- The observed rotation is \(\xi = -1.2^\circ\).
- The molar mass of cholesterol is \(M = 303 \, \text{g/mol}\).

### Step 1: Calculate the concentration \(c\)
The concentration \(c\) is calculated as:

\[
c = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{6.15 \, \text{g}}{100 \, \text{mL}} = \frac{6.15 \, \text{g}}{0.1 \, \text{L}} = 61.5 \, \text{g/L}
\]

Using the molar mass \(M = 303 \, \text{g/mol}\):

\[
c = \frac{61.5 \, \text{g/L}}{303 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.203 \, \text{mol/L}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the specific rotation \(\omega\)
Using the formula:

\[
\omega = \frac{\xi}{c \cdot l}
\]

Assuming the path length \(l = 1 \, \text{cm}\):

\[
\omega = \frac{-1.2^\circ}{0.203 \, \text{mol/L} \cdot 1 \, \text{cm}} = \frac{-1.2^\circ}{0.203 \, \text{mol/L} \cdot 0.01 \, \text{m}} = -5.92^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The calculated specific rotation is approximately \(-5.92^\circ\), which does not match any of the provided options.

### Conclusion:
The closest match to the calculated value is **Option B: -0.5**, but this is not accurate. Given the provided options, none of them are correct based on the calculations.

ANSWER: -5.92
