B: Subtracting quantities
C: Dividing quantities
D: Multiplying quantities
E: Ordering quantities
F: Describing quantities
G: Comparing quantities
H: Decomposing quantities
I: Adding quantities
J: Equalizing quantities

Okay, so I have this question about a math lesson where second graders are selecting cards with three-digit numbers and using base ten blocks. I need to figure out which whole number concept this reinforces. Let me break this down.

First, the students are picking a card marked with a three-digit number. That means each number ranges from 100 to 999. Then they model these numbers with base ten blocks on a place value mat. Base ten blocks are typically used in early math education to help students visualize numbers. They come in units (ones), rods (tens), flats (hundreds), and maybe a cube for thousands. So if a student has a number like 234, they would use two flats, three rods, and four units.

Now, thinking about the different math concepts each option refers to. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Counting quantities. That's about understanding how many items there are in a set, which is more about quantity recognition than modeling numbers with blocks. So probably not this.

Option B: Subtracting quantities. That's more about performing subtraction, which isn't the main focus here since students are just modeling numbers, not performing operations.

Option C: Dividing quantities. Dividing is a different operation, and again, the focus is on modeling, not division.

Option D: Multiplying quantities. Similar to division, this isn't directly about modeling multiplication.

Option E: Ordering quantities. This is about arranging numbers in order, which could be related to place value. But the lesson is about modeling, not ordering.

Option F: Describing quantities. That's about explaining the quantity, maybe in words, which is more about understanding than using blocks.

Option G: Comparing quantities. Comparing two numbers is part of understanding place value, which is exactly what this lesson is about.

Option H: Decomposing quantities. Decomposing means breaking a number into parts, which is exactly what students are doing with the base ten blocks. For example, 234 is 200 + 30 +4.

Option I: Adding quantities. While adding is related, the lesson is about modeling, not adding.

Option J: Equalizing quantities. Equalizing might involve division, but again, the focus is on modeling numbers.

So putting it all together, the lesson is about decomposing quantities because students are breaking down three-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and ones using base ten blocks. This reinforces the idea that numbers can be broken down into smaller parts based on place value.

The lesson reinforces the concept of decomposing quantities because students use base ten blocks to break down three-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and ones.
