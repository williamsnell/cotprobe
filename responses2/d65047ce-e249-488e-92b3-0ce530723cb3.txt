Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a copper penny. Hmm, let me read it again. It says the penny weighs 3.1 grams and contains equal amounts of positive and negative charges. The question is asking for the magnitude of these charges, q.

Wait, I remember that copper has a certain number of atoms, and each atom contributes one positive and one negative charge. So the total positive and negative charges should be equal. But how do I find the charge per atom and then per mole?

Oh right, from the periodic table, copper has an atomic mass of about 64 g/mol. So, first, I need to find the number of moles in 3.1 grams. Moles are calculated by dividing grams by molar mass. So that's 3.1 g divided by 64 g/mol. Let's compute that: 3.1 /64 equals approximately 0.0484375 moles. Hmm, about 0.0484 moles.

Wait, each mole of copper atoms contains Avogadro's number of atoms. Oh yeah, Avogadro's number is 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol. So the total number of atoms in the penny would be 0.0484375 mol * 6.022e23 atoms/mol. Let me calculate that: 0.0484375 * 6.022e23 is approximately (0.0484375 * 6e23) = 2.906e22 atoms? Wait, let me be precise. 0.0484375 * 6.022e23 = let me compute:

0.0484375 is approximately 0.0484375. Multiply by 6.022e23:

0.0484375 * 6.022e23 = (0.0484375 * 6.022) * 1e23. 0.0484375 *6.022 is about 0.2925 (since 0.048 *6 is 0.288, 0.048 *0.022 is ~0.001056, so total about 0.289056). Wait, better to compute accurately:

0.0484375 * 6.022 = let's do 0.0484375 *6=0.290625, then 0.0484375 *0.022=0.001065625. So total is 0.291690625. So approximately 0.2917e23? Wait, 0.2917e23 is 2.917e22 atoms. Wait, no, wait: 0.2917e23 is 2.917e22? Wait, no. 0.2917 * 1e23 is 2.917e22. Yeah, correct.

So 2.917e22 atoms in the penny. Now, each copper atom has a nuclear charge of +4.6e-18 C and a charge of -4.6e-18 C. Oh, right! The problem states that each copper atom has a positive nuclear charge of 4.6e-18 C and a negative electronic charge of the same magnitude (so -4.6e-18 C).

So each atom contributes a net charge of 0 because +4.6e-18 and -4.6e-18 cancel each other. Wait, but the penny has equal amounts of positive and negative charges. Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me reread the question.

Wait, the problem says the penny contains equal amounts of positive and negative electricity. So that means the number of positive and negative charges are the same. So each copper atom contributes one positive and one negative charge. So each atom contributes a net zero charge. So the net charge of the penny is zero.

Wait, but the question is about the magnitude of each charge, not the net charge. So each individual atom's positive and negative charges are each 4.6e-18 C. Oh, but wait, the problem states that each copper atom has a positive nuclear charge of 4.6e-18 C and a negative electronic charge of equal magnitude. So each atom contributes 4.6e-18 C positive and 4.6e-18 C negative. So the net charge per atom is zero. But the problem says the penny has equal amounts of positive and negative charges, which implies that the total positive is equal to total negative. So the positive and negative charges in the entire object are equal. So each positive charge is 1e-18 C, and negative is same. But the question is about the magnitude q, which is 4.6e-18 C per atom.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the magnitude q of these charges." So each positive and negative charge is q. So each copper atom has a +q and -q, where q is 4.6e-18 C. So the magnitude is 4.6e-18 C. Oh, but wait, looking at the options, option I is 4.6e-18 C. But wait, looking at the options, option H is 1.3e5, which is way larger. Option A is 6e23, which is way larger.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

It says the penny contains equal amounts of positive and negative charges. So the number of positive charges equals the number of negative charges. So for each atom, the number of positive and negative charges contributed is the same. So each atom has one positive and one negative charge. So each atom's net charge is zero. So the total number of positive charges equals the total number of negative charges.

But the problem is about the magnitude of these individual charges, not the net charge. So each positive and negative charge in the penny is 4.6e-18 C. So the magnitude q is 4.6e-18 C. Looking at the options, option I is 4.6e-18 C. But wait, I should check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A: 6.0e23C

B:9.2e-18C

C:2.4e4C

D:2.9e22C

E:3.1e6C

F:5.0e20C

G:7.5e21C

H:1.3e5C

I:4.6e-18C

J:8.1e22C

Wait, option I is 4.6e-18 C. So that would be the answer, I think. Because each copper atom's positive and negative charges are 4.6e-18 C. So the magnitude is 4.6e-18 C.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the question says 'contains equal amounts of positive and negative electricity' which implies that the number of positive charges equals the number of negative charges. Each positive and negative charge would be 4.6e-18 C, so the magnitude is 4.6e-18 C. So the answer is option I.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.6e-18C. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the magnitude \( q \) of the charges in a copper penny, we start by analyzing the problem:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The penny weighs 3.1 g and contains equal amounts of positive and negative charges. Each copper atom has a nuclear charge of \( +4.6 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{C} \) and a negative electronic charge of equal magnitude.

2. **Calculating the Number of Atoms**: 
   - The molar mass of copper is \( 64 \, \text{g/mol} \).
   - The number of moles in 3.1 g of copper is \( \frac{3.1}{64} \approx 0.0484375 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Using Avogadro's number \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \), the total number of atoms is:
     \[
     0.0484375 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 2.917 \times 10^{22} \, \text{atoms}.
     \]

3. **Determining the Magnitude of Each Charge**:
   - Each copper atom contributes one positive charge and one negative charge, each with magnitude \( 4.6 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{C} \).
   - Since the total number of positive and negative charges in the penny are equal, the magnitude of each charge \( q \) is \( 4.6 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{C} \).

4. **Matching with the Options**:
   - Option I corresponds to \( 4.6 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{C} \), which matches the calculated value.

Thus, the magnitude of the charges is \( 4.6 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{C} \), and the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: I**
