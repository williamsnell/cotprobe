Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about rotational transitions in a diatomic molecule. The question gives me that the J=2 to J=3 transition is at 126.4 GHz, and I need to find the frequency for the J=5 to J=6 transition.

Hmm, I remember that rotational transitions in diatomic molecules are governed by the selection rule ΔJ = ±1. So, when an electron moves from one rotational state to another, the change in J is 1. That makes sense because of the angular momentum considerations.

The energy levels for a diatomic molecule are given by the formula E_J = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The difference in energy between two adjacent levels corresponds to the photon's energy, which is related to the frequency by E = h * ν. 

So, the transition from J=2 to J=3 would have an energy difference of E3 - E2. Let me compute that.

E3 = B * 3*(3+1) = 12B
E2 = B * 2*(2+1) = 6B
So, ΔE = 12B -6B =6B.

This energy corresponds to the frequency ν1 = (6B)/h.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the formula for the transition frequency is ν = (E3 - E2)/h = (6B)/h. Oh wait, but I think for rotational transitions, the frequency is given by (2J' +1 - 2J) multiplied by some constants. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the selection rule.

Another approach: the energy difference between J and J+1 is 2B (J+1) - 2B J = 2B (J+1 - J) = 2B. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the energy difference for J=2 to 3 as 2B. But earlier, my calculation gave 6B, but that would be the difference for J=2 to 3, which is 3(3+1) - 2(2+1)= 12-6=6B.

Wait, perhaps I should correct that. So the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1).

So for J=2, E is B*(2)(3)=6B.

J=3: B*(3)(4)=12B.

ΔE = 12B -6B =6B. And this ΔE is equal to h ν.

So, ν = (6B)/h.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the exact formula. Another way to think: the rotational energy levels for a diatomic are E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. The energy difference between J and J+1 is (E_{J+1} - E_J) = (ħ²/(2I)) [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ].

Simplify that: [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] expands to (J+1)(J+2 - J) ) = (J+1)(2) = 2(J+1).

So the energy difference is (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 (J+1) ) = ( ħ² (J+1) ) / I.

But I also know that the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ² / (2 I). So substituting B into the energy difference:

ΔE = B (J+1) * 2? Wait, no. Let me redo that.

Wait, for J to J+1, the energy difference is 2 B (J+1). Because B = (ħ²)/(2I), so substituting, ΔE = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 (J+1) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 (J+1) ) = (ħ²/(I)) (J+1).

But since B = ħ²/(2I), then ΔE = 2 B (J+1). Because, let me see: B = ħ²/(2I), so 2B = ħ²/(I), so ΔE=2B (J+1).

Yes, that makes sense. So the energy difference for J to J+1 is 2B (J+1).

Wait, but in the first calculation, for J=2 to J=3, the energy difference is 2B (3) = 6B. Which matches the earlier calculation. So that's correct.

So the frequency ν is (2 B (J+1)) / h.

Wait, but wait, the energy is h ν. So (2 B (J+1)) = h ν.

So ν = (2 B (J+1)) ) / h.

But also, the rotational constant B can be expressed in terms of the frequency of the transition. Because, the transition frequency ν is given by 2B, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the transition from J=2 to J=3 has a frequency of 126.4 GHz. So for that, using the formula:

ν = (2 B (J+1)) ) / h.

Wait, for J=2, the next is J=3. So J+1 in this case is 3.

So ν = (2 B * 3) / h.

So 126.4 GHz = (6 B) / h.

Hmm, but what is h? Planck's constant. Oh, but wait, perhaps I can find B from this equation.

Wait, but for a diatomic molecule, B is related to the frequency of the emitted photon. Oh wait, the rotational constant B is given by the expression B = (h c) / (8 π² I), where c is the speed of light, and I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, but alternatively, B is also related to the frequency of the transition. Because, for the transition from J to J+1, the photon's energy is h ν = 2 B (J+1) (from earlier equation).

Wait, but wait, earlier I wrote that the energy difference is 2B (J+1). So for the transition from J to J+1, the energy change is 2B (J+1), and that's equal to h ν.

So, 2B (J+1) = h ν.

But I can also express B in terms of h and ν. Because B = h ν / (2 (J+1)).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach would be better.

Alternatively, the rotational constant B is given by (h c) / (8 π² I). But I don't have I. So perhaps another angle is better.

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic are E_J = B J (J+1). The energy difference between J and J+1 is ΔE = B [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] = B (2 J + 2 ) ) = 2 B (J+1).

Alternatively, ΔE = 2 B (J + 1) = h ν.

But for the transition between J and J+1, the change in J is +1. So the frequency ν is given by (2 B (J+1) ) / h.

Wait, but wait, for J=2, the transition is to J=3. So J+1 is 3, so ν = (2 B * 3) / h.

Given that ν for J=2→3 is 126.4 GHz, so:

126.4 GHz = (6 B) / h.

So we can write B = (126.4 GHz * h) / 6.

Wait, but what's h in terms of units? Let me think about the units. h is in J s, and B is in Hz (since B = E/h).

Wait, perhaps I should write it in terms of B = (h c) / (8 π² I), but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: The rotational constant B is given by B = h c / (8 π² I). But I'm not sure if I'll need I for this.

Wait, perhaps there's a relationship between B and ν for a transition from J to J+1. Since for each transition, the energy change is 2 B (J+1), which equals h ν. So ν = (2 B (J+1)) / h.

So, for the first transition (J=2 →3), we have:

ν1 = (2 B * (3)) / h = 6 B / h = 126.4 GHz.

So, B = (126.4 GHz * h) /6.

But B is also (h c )/(8 π² I).

Hmm, maybe I can eliminate I somehow. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio between the two transitions.

Wait, let's think about the two transitions:

Transition 1: J=2 →3: ν1 = 126.4 GHz.

Transition 2: J=5 →6: ν2 = ?

We need to find ν2.

So, for transition 1, ν1 = (2 B (3)) / h.

For transition 2, ν2 = (2 B (6)) / h.

So, ν2 = (6 B) / h = 3 * (2 B / h) = 3 ν1.

Wait, because 2B/h is a constant for the molecule. So, if ν1 is 126.4 GHz, then ν2 is 3 times that.

Wait, 3 * 126.4 is 379.2 GHz. Looking at the options, that's not present. Wait, let me check the options again.

Oh wait, the options are:

F: 210.8 GHz

G: 189.6 GHz

H: 226.4 GHz

I: 126.4 GHz

J: 378 GHz

K: 379.2 GHz.

Wait, none of the options have 379.2 GHz. But wait, looking back, the options are J to I. So J is 378 GHz, which is close but not exactly. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. Let me re-examine the reasoning. Did I make a mistake in the ratio?

Wait, the transition from J to J+1. The frequency for each transition is proportional to (J+1). Because ν = (2 B (J+1)) ) / h.

So the frequency is ν = (2 B (J+1)) / h.

So for J=2: ν1 = (2 B * 3)/h.

For J=5: ν2 = (2 B *6 ) /h.

So, ν2 = (6 B /h) = 3 * (2 B/h) = 3 * ν1.

So 3 *126.4 is 379.2 GHz.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I've made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from J=2 to J=3 in the first case, which is a ΔJ of +1. So the energy difference is 2B (J+1) = 2B *3 =6B. Thus, 6B = h ν1.

Similarly, for J=5 →6, the energy difference is 2B *6 =12 B = h ν2.

So, ν2 = (12 B)/h.

But from the first transition, 6B = h ν1 → B = (h ν1)/6.

Substitute B into ν2:

ν2 = (12 * (h ν1/6) ) / h = (2 h ν1 ) / h = 2 ν1.

So, ν2 = 2 * 126.4 GHz → 252.8 GHz.

Wait, that's one of the options. Wait, looking at the options, option B is 252.8 GHz.

But wait, I thought earlier that the frequency was 3 times, but if this approach is correct, it's 2 times. Which one is correct?

Hmm, this is a point of confusion. Let me double-check the reasoning.

The energy of a rotational transition from J to J+1 is given by:

ΔE = E_{J+1} - E_J = [ B (J+1)(J+2) ] - [ B J (J+1) ] 

Simplify that: B (J+1)(J+2 - J) ) = B (J+1)(2) = 2 B (J+1).

So, ΔE = 2 B (J+1) = h ν.

So, for the first transition (J=2 →3), ν = 2 B (3) / h =6 B/h.

We have ν1 = 126.4 GHz =6 B/h → B = (126.4 GHz * h) /6.

Now, for the second transition (J=5→6), ΔE = 2 B (6) =12 B → ν2 =12 B /h.

But substituting B from earlier: ν2=12 * (126.4 GHz *h /6 ) /h → 12 *126.4 /6 GHz = 2 *126.4 = 252.8 GHz.

So, the frequency is 252.8 GHz. Which is option B. But wait, but in my initial approach I thought it was 3 times, but that was a mistake.

Wait, but why? Because I incorrectly thought that the energy difference for J=2→3 is 6B, but then in the second case, it's 12B. So, the frequency is double.

So, the correct answer would be option B: 252.8 GHz.

But wait, looking at the options again, the choices are:

A:315.2 GHz

B:252.8 GHz

C:158.6 GHz

D:347.2 GHz

E:283.2 GHz

F:210.8 GHz

G:189.6 GHz

H:226.4 GHz

I:126.4 GHz

J:378 GHz

Wait, so option B is 252.8 GHz. But wait, looking back, I thought the energy difference for J=2→3 is 6B, which would lead to ν=6B/h=126.4 GHz. Then, for J=5→6, it's 12 B/h.

But since for J=2, 6B/h=126.4 GHz → B= (126.4 GHz *h)/(6).

So, 12 B/h = 12 * (126.4 * h/(6)) ) /h → 12 *126.4 /6 → 2 *126.4 → 252.8 GHz.

Ah, so that's correct. So the answer should be option B, 252.8 GHz.

But wait, none of the options list 252.8 GHz. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:315.2

B:252.8

C:158.6

D:347.2

E:283.2

F:210.8

G:189.6

H:226.4

I:126.4

J:378.

So yes, option B is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: Did I make a mistake in the transition selection?

Wait, perhaps for J=2 →3, the energy difference is 2B*(3), which is 6B. So that's 6B= h*126.4.

So, 6B = h ν → B = h ν/(6).

Then, for J=5 →6 transition, the energy is 2B*(6) = 12 B → 12 B =12 * (h*126.4)/(6) ) → 12 *126.4 /6 = 2 *126.4 = 252.8. So yes, that's correct.

But I'm still confused because earlier, I thought the frequency was 3 times, but that was a mistake.

Wait, perhaps another way: The rotational constant B is the same for all transitions. So the ratio between the two frequencies is (J+2)/(J+1).

Wait, because for transition J→J+1, frequency is (2B (J+1)) / h.

So, for J=2: ν1 = (2 B *3)/h.

J=5: ν2 = (2 B *6)/h.

So, ν2 = (6 B/h) *2 → 3 * (2 B/h). Wait, wait, no. Because 2 B/h is a constant for the molecule. So, ν1=3*(2 B/h) * (B) → no, wait, 2 B/h is a constant. So, ν2= (6 B/h) = 2*(2 B/h) = 2 ν1.

Wait, no, wait, ν1= (2 B *3) /h → which is 6 B/h.

ν2 = (2 B *6)/h → 12 B/h.

So, ν2= (12 B/h) = 2*(6 B/h) ) → 2*(ν1) = 2*126.4 = 252.8 GHz.

So the correct answer is option B:252.8 GHz.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the rotational transitions in diatomic molecules. The energy levels are given by:

\[
E_J = B J (J+1),
\]

where \( B \) is the rotational constant, and \( J \) is the rotational quantum number. The energy difference between adjacent levels is:

\[
\Delta E = E_{J+1} - E_J = B [(J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1)] = 2B (J+1).
\]

This energy difference corresponds to the photon's energy, \( E = h \nu \), so:

\[
\nu = \frac{2B (J+1)}{h}.
\]

### Step 1: Determine \( B \) from the given transition
The transition for \( J=2 \to J=3 \) is given as \( \nu_1 = 126.4 \, \text{GHz} \). Using the formula above:

\[
\nu_1 = \frac{2B (3)}{h} = \frac{6B}{h}.
\]

Rearranging for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{\nu_1 h}{6}.
\]

### Step 2: Apply the same formula to the desired transition
For the transition \( J=5 \to J=6 \), the energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = 2B (6).
\]

The corresponding frequency is:

\[
\nu_2 = \frac{2B (6)}{h} = \frac{12B}{h}.
\]

Substitute \( B \) from Step 1:

\[
\nu_2 = \frac{12 \cdot \frac{\nu_1 h}{6}}{h} = \frac{12 \cdot \nu_1}{6} = 2 \cdot \nu_1.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \nu_2 \)
Given \( \nu_1 = 126.4 \, \text{GHz} \), calculate \( \nu_2 \):

\[
\nu_2 = 2 \cdot 126.4 = 252.8 \, \text{GHz}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated frequency \( \nu_2 = 252.8 \, \text{GHz} \) corresponds to **Option B**.
