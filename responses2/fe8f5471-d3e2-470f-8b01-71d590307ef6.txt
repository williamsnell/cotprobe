Question:

Two weeks before an election, a local newspaper published an article implying that one of the mayoral candidates was a thief. The candidate subsequently lost the election and sued the newspaper for defamation. The newspaper defended on the grounds of truth. At trial, the candidate took the stand and testified that he was not a thief. Thereafter, the newspaper called a witness to testify that three years ago the candidate committed a larceny while employed at his former job. Upon objection by the candidate's attorney, the witness's testimony should be

Options:

A: excluded, as it can potentially bias the jury.
B: excluded, because it is hearsay evidence.
C: admitted, as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth.
D: excluded, because it is improper character evidence.
E: admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.
F: excluded, because the act was committed too long ago to be relevant.
G: admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity.
H: admitted, as it is relevant to the candidate's credibility.
I: admitted, but only if the witness can provide conclusive proof of the larceny.
J: excluded, because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.

Okay, so I have this law question here about defamation, truth tellers, and hearsay evidence. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a candidate who's suing a local newspaper that published an article saying one of the mayoral candidates was a thief. The candidate then loses the election and sues the newspaper. The newspaper is defending on the grounds of truth, which I think refers to the truth-teller defense. 

So the candidate then testified that he wasn't a thief. The newspaper called a witness three years ago, who testified that the candidate committed a larceny while employed at his former job. The question is whether the witness's testimony should be excluded or admitted.

I remember that truth-teller defense is when the defendant claims he wasn't involved in the event, and the truth-teller is the witness. But for the truth-teller to be successful, the defendant must be unable to deny that they were involved. In this case, the candidate testified that he wasn't a thief, so the defense is likely successful, meaning the newspaper's defense is valid.

Now, when a witness testifies about a past event, that's hearsay. But wait, if the witness is the truth-teller, then the event is not hearsay because the truth is already established. Hearsay requires the statement to be original, direct, and credible. So if the witness is the truth-teller, there's no hearsay issue because the truth isn't hearsay anymore.

Wait, but the newspaper is defending as truth, so the candidate is claiming he wasn't involved. The witness is testifying about the same event, so that's hearsay. But if the witness is also the truth-teller, then the statement is not hearsay because the truth is already established, not hearsay. So the witness's testimony isn't hearsay and thus can be admitted.

Looking at the options:

Option C says it's admitted as supporting the newspaper's defense. That makes sense because the truth-teller defense relies on the statement being true, so the admission of the witness's testimony is for that purpose.

Option B says it's excluded because it's hearsay. But if the witness is the truth-teller, the statement isn't hearsay because the truth isn't hearsay. So B is incorrect.

Option A suggests exclusion, but that's not the case here because the witness's testimony is hearsay, unless the witness is the truth-teller. So A is wrong.

Option E: admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as thief. No, wait. The candidate's character as thief is more about whether he's a thief, but the witness is testifying about a past act. So this might not be relevant. Unless it's about the character's past behavior, but here the issue is the truth-teller defense and hearsay.

Option F says excluded because it's too long ago. But the newspaper mentions it was committed three years ago, which is a good point. So that's not excluded.

Option G: admitted as probative evidence because it supports the truth-teller defense. That's correct because the witness's testimony supports the newspaper's defense.

Option H: admitted as character evidence. No, because the character evidence is about the defendant's character in the act, which isn't the focus here. The focus is the truth-teller defense and hearsay.

Option I says only if the witness can provide conclusive proof. Maybe, but the newspaper's defense is the truth, so the witness's testimony should support it, regardless of whether the witness can prove it conclusively. Unless they can't, but the newspaper wants to proceed, so the witness's testimony is admitted.

Option J: excluded because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. I don't think that applies here; the witness's testimony is about a past act, which is relevant.

So the correct answer is either option C or G.

Wait, another angle: when the defendant is a truth-teller, the statement is not hearsay. So the witness's testimony is not hearsay, so it's admissible. But, the witness's testimony is about a past event that could be relevant to the truth-teller defense. So it's admissible as evidence to support the defense. So the correct answer is C (admitted as supporting the defense) or G (admitted as probative evidence).

Wait, but what's the definition here. The candidate's defense is that he wasn't involved, so the defense is truth-telling. The witness's testimony is that he committed a larceny three years ago. If the witness is the truth-teller, the statement is not hearsay because the truth is established. So the admission of the witness's testimony is to support the defense, not to prove the event itself.

So the witness's testimony is admitted because it supports the defense. So option C says "admitted as supporting the newspaper's defense of truth." Option G says "excluded, because it's improper character evidence." No, G doesn't fit. So the correct answer is C.
</think>

The candidate's defense is based on the truth-teller defense, which relies on the statement being true. When the witness testifies about a past event, it is hearsay unless the witness is also the truth-teller. Since the candidate testified that he was not a thief, the witness's testimony is not hearsay and can be admitted to support the newspaper's defense. 

Option C correctly states that the witness's testimony is admitted as supporting the newspaper's defense. 

ANSWER: C
