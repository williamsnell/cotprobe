Okay, so I have this question about depreciation and book value. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that Global Bus buys a bus for $40,000 and depreciates it on a straight-line basis for five years. I need to find the book value after two years. 

Wait, straight-line depreciation. I remember that straight-line means the bus loses value evenly each year. So, the total depreciable cost is $40,000, and it's spread over five years. 

So, the annual depreciation would be $40,000 divided by 5 years. Let me compute that: 40,000 /5 =8,000. So, each year the bus loses $8,000 in value.

Now, after two years, the total depreciation would be 2 times 8,000. That's 16,000. 

So, the book value is the original cost minus the accumulated depreciation. Original cost is 40,000 minus 16,000 equals 24,000. 

Looking at the options, option F is $24,000. So the correct answer should be F.

The book value after two years of service is calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation from the original cost.

- **Original Cost:** $40,000
- **Depreciable Cost per Year:** $40,000 / 5 = $8,000
- **Accumulated Depreciation after 2 years:** 2 * $8,000 = $16,000
- **Book Value:** $40,000 - $16,000 = $24,000

ANSWER: F
