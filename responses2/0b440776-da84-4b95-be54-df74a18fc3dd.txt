Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a ball being thrown into the air. The question is asking me to find the velocity of the ball at t=2 seconds. The equation given is y = 40t -16t², where y is the height in feet and t is the time in seconds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with motion under gravity, the velocity is related to the derivative of the position function. So I think I need to take the derivative of y with respect to t to find the velocity function, and then plug in t=2 into that function.

Wait, let me think again. Oh right, because velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time. So, yeah, calculus is the way to go here. The position function y(t) = 40t -16t² is a quadratic function, which makes sense because the height under gravity is a parabola. The derivative should give me the velocity as a function of time.

So, let's compute the derivative. The derivative of 40t with respect to t is just 40, since the derivative of at + b is a, where a and b are constants. Then the derivative of -16t² is -32t, using the power rule. So putting that together, the velocity function v(t) should be 40 -32t. That makes sense because the initial velocity when t=0 is 40 ft/s, which is the coefficient of t, and then the -32t term comes from the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 32 ft/s² downward, hence the negative sign.

Now, I need to find the velocity at t=2. So substitute t=2 into v(t). Let's do that: v(2) = 40 -32*(2) = 40 -64. Wait, 32 times 2 is 64. So 40 -64 equals -24 ft/s. Hmm, that's negative, which makes sense because the ball is moving downward at t=2 seconds, so the velocity is negative.

Looking at the options: A is 64, which is the initial velocity, so that's the position, not the velocity. B is -40, which would be the velocity if the initial velocity were -40, but the initial velocity here is 40. C is 56, that's higher than the initial, so probably not. D is 16, that's half of the initial velocity. E is 0, which would be the case if the ball reached the peak of its trajectory, but at t=2, it's on the way down. F is -32, which isn't in the options. G is -16, also not. H is -8, no. I is -24, which matches what I calculated. J is 8, which is lower than the initial velocity.

So the correct answer should be option I: -24 ft/s.

To find the velocity at t=2, we take the derivative of the position function y(t) = 40t -16t², yielding the velocity function v(t) = 40 -32t. Substituting t=2 gives v(2) = 40 -64 = -24 ft/s. The correct answer is I: -24 ft/s.

Answer: I
