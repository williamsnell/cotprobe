Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I travelled thence to 'Aden, the port of Yemen, on the coast of the ocean. It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God."
Ibn Battuta, ca. 1325â€“1354 C.E.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about identifying which event directly led to the development of the economic system described. The options are a bunch of historical events, and I have to pick the one that was directly responsible.

First, I'll try to understand the economic system described in the passage. The passage talks about a port called Aden, which is the port of Yemen. It's surrounded by mountains, and the inhabitants live there. The major points are:

- The port is exceedingly hot.
- It's the port of the Indians, with large vessels from places like Kinbayat.
- There are Indian merchants and Egyptian merchants living there.
- All inhabitants are merchants, porters, or fishermen.
- Some merchants are extremely wealthy, often owning large ships. This is a subject of rivalry and ostentation.
- They're pious, humble, upright, generous, and pay tithes.

So the economy there is probably based on trade and commerce, especially involving large ships and port transactions. The people are part of a trade network, and there's a lot of trade happening there.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Influence of religious institutions.
B: Competition with European trade networks.
C: Invasion by neighboring territories.
D: Discovery of new trade routes.
E: Meteorological phenomena.
F: Presence of highly developed port cities.
G: Government policies promoting trade.
H: Introduction of new crops.
I: Technological advancements in shipbuilding.
J: Military campaigns.

Hmm. The main economic system here is probably a trade-based economy, not necessarily a centralized or newly discovered trade route. So I'm thinking about what led to such a system.

The passage mentions the port of Aden, which is a significant port. The passage also talks about the port being the port of the Indians, implying that there were other Indian trade routes. So the economic system must have been driven by trade with various regions, including the Indian Ocean.

The question is about what led directly to the economic system. So, the development would be due to the interaction between different regions, perhaps due to the port's location and the presence of different trade routes.

Looking at the options, option F says the presence of highly developed port cities. If Aden is a port city, then the development of trade routes there must have been facilitated by its high development.

Alternatively, option D says the discovery of new trade routes. Aden is the port of Yemen, which is part of the Indian Ocean. If they were trading with other Indian regions, there might have been new trade routes discovered. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the passage mentions the port of the Indians, so there were other Indian ports. The port of Aden is part of the Indian Ocean, so the port cities there would have facilitated trade with other parts of the world, including other Indian ports.

So the economic system developed because of the port cities acting as trade hubs.

Alternatively, another angle: the system's development would be due to the port's function as a hub, which facilitated trade with other regions. So the economic system developed because of the port's role in trade.

Looking again at the options, option F is about port cities. So if Aden was a port city, then the development was due to high development in that port.

Alternatively, option D is discovery of new trade routes. If Aden was part of a newly discovered trade route, then that would lead to the economic system. But Aden is a well-known port, so more likely it's the role of the port itself in the trade networks.

Wait, another thought: The economic system in the passage is based on trade, which is facilitated by port infrastructure. So the development of the port (like Aden's infrastructure) would have allowed for trade, hence the economic system.

But the question is about what led directly to the economic system. So the answer is probably the port's role as a trade hub, which is facilitated by its high level of development.

So looking at the options, option F says the presence of highly developed port cities. If Aden is a port city, then the high development would have led to the economic system. So the correct answer is F.

The economic system described in the passage is based on trade and commerce, particularly involving large ships and port transactions. The port of Aden, as a significant trade hub, facilitates this system. The development of the port's infrastructure, combined with its role as a trade network, led to the economic system. Among the options, the presence of highly developed port cities (Option F) best explains the system's development.

Answer: F
