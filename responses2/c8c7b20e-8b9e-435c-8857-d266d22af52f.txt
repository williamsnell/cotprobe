Question:

Late one night, co-defendants broke into a warehouse and proceeded to load the large crates of appliances onto their truck. As they were leaving, one of the co-defendants inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a refuse pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. Soon afterward, the refuse ignited into a small fire. Although the co-defendants had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, neither did so. Instead, they climbed into the truck and fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames. At common law, the co-defendants should be found guilty of

Options:

A: burglary and larceny.
B: burglary only.
C: burglary and arson.
D: larceny and arson.
E: burglary, arson, and criminal negligence.
F: burglary, larceny, and arson.
G: arson only.
H: larceny only.
I: larceny, arson, and criminal negligence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about criminal law. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a group of co-defendants break into a warehouse, load crates, and then one of them throws a cigarette butt into old cardboard boxes. That butt ignited a fire, which spread and engulfed the entire warehouse. The co-defendants had time to extinguish the fire but couldn't, so they fled. Meanwhile, the fire spread and engulfed everything.

The question is asking which crimes the co-defendants are guilty of under common law. The options include combinations of burglary, larceny, and arson.

First, I need to recall the definitions of each crime here.

Burglary: This involves the unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. It includes activities like breaking and entering, with the intent to commit a felony. So, if they entered the warehouse unlawfully, that's burglary.

Larceny: This is the unlawful transfer of property. It's similar to burglary but with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. So, if they took the boxes and papers, that's larceny.

Arson: This is the intentional burning of a building or structure for the purpose of cooking, heating, or for other purposes. The fire here was intentional and spread instantly. So, arson.

Now, the key here is whether these crimes are separate or if they combine. In common law, each of these is a separate crime. So, if the co-defendants committed burglary (entering and intending to commit a felony), and they also committed larceny (taking property), and they committed arson (burning property), then each is a separate offense.

Wait, but in typical cases, when a single act causes multiple crimes, it's considered a single offense. But in this question, the actions are separate. The co-defendants entered, took the property, and the fire spread, which was an additional act. Each of these is separate, so each crime would apply.

So, the possible options are: A is burglary and larceny. B is only burglary. C is burglary and arson. D is larceny and arson. E, F, etc., include more.

Wait, but when an act causes multiple crimes, like if the fire started after they entered, but each action (entry, taking, and burning) is separate, then each would be considered a separate offense. But wait, the question is about what the co-defendants should be found guilty of. So, each individual action is a separate offense.

Alternatively, maybe the entire act of burning constitutes part of the entry or taking process. Hmm, but in this case, the fire started after they entered, so the entry was intentional, but the fire itself was accidental. So it's not a separate offense.

Wait, maybe I should consider each crime separately. So, the co-defendants committed burglary (entering with intent to commit a felony inside), larceny (taking property), and arson (burning property). So that would be option F: burglary, larceny, and arson.

But wait, is the fire considered a separate crime? Or is it part of the same event? For common law, each separate act is considered a separate offense. So, the entry (burglary), taking (larceny), and the fire (arson) are each separate crimes.

Wait, no, maybe not. The act of burning (arson) is the result of the entry and taking. So, in some cases, you might combine them, but in common law, it's each individual offense.

Alternatively, sometimes when an act causes multiple crimes, the individual crimes are considered. But in this case, the co-defendants entered (burglary), took the property (larceny), and then the fire (arson) spread. Each is a separate offense.

So, the correct answer would be F: burglary, larceny, and arson.

Wait, but did the fire start after they entered? The question says they had time to extinguish but couldn't. So the fire is the result of their unlawful entry and taking. So, each of the three actions is a separate offense.

So, the correct answer would be F.

The co-defendants committed a series of unlawful acts: they entered the warehouse unlawfully with the intent to commit a felony (burglary), took the boxes and papers (larceny), and the fire, which spread and engulfed the warehouse, was an intentional act of burning property (arson). Each of these actions is a separate crime under common law, so the co-defendants are found guilty of burglary, larceny, and arson.

**Answer: F**
