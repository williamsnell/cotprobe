Question:

Most people use C°(degree Celsius) to measure everyday temperatures. Astronomers prefer to use K (Kelvin) to measure temperatures. Approximately how many Kelvin are 25 C°?

Options:

A: 350 Kelvin
B: 250 Kelvin
C: 200 Kelvin
D: 300 Kelvin
E: 375 Kelvin
F: 275 Kelvin
G: 450 Kelvin
H: 225 Kelvin
I: 400 Kelvin
J: 325 Kelvin

Okay, so I've got this question about converting Celsius to Kelvin. Hmm, I remember that the Celsius scale is used everywhere in everyday life, like when we talk about room temperatures or body temperature. But wait, astronomers use Kelvin because it's an absolute scale, right? I think Kelvin starts at absolute zero, which is the lowest possible temperature. So, the scales aren't the same. 

Wait, how do you convert Celsius to Kelvin? Oh right, I think you just add 273.15 to the Celsius temperature. But wait, sometimes people approximate it as adding 273. So for this question, it's 25°C, so adding 273.15 would give 298.15 K. But the options don't have 298.15. Let me look at the options again.

The options are A: 350, B:250, C:200, D:300, E:375, F:275, G:450, H:225, I:400, J:325.

Wait, the options are all around 250-400. So 25°C is 298.15 K, which is approximately 300 K. Looking at the choices, D is 300, and E is 375, which is higher. So the correct answer should be D:300 Kelvin.

Wait another thought: sometimes you might forget the 273.15. Like, someone might just subtract 273, but that's not right. Because Kelvin is absolute, you can't have negative values.

Wait, let's do the calculation again. 25°C to Kelvin is 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K. So the closest option is D:300 K.

Looking at the options, D is 300 K, which is correct. So the answer is D.

The question asks for the conversion of 25°C to Kelvin. The correct formula is K = °C + 273.15. Applying this, 25°C becomes 298.15 K. Among the options, the closest value is 300 K. 

Answer: D: 300 Kelvin
