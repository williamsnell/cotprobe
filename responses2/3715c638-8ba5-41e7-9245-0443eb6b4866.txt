Question:

A grocery store is sued by a customer for damages for injuries allegedly suffered to the face and forearms, which resulted from his collision with the store's automatic doors. The customer contended that at the time of the mishap, the doors were programmed to swing outward, taking would-be customers entering the store, by surprise. At trial, the customer testified to both the nature of his injuries and the events leading up to their occurrence. The grocery store denied that the doors to its store were in any way unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by his encounter with the doors. The customer's sister testified at trial that she accompanied her brother to the store the day of the accident and witnessed the outward swinging doors, which struck him. She further alleged that when she returned to the store the following week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, due to the possibility of bias.
B: admissible, as a first-hand witness account of the event.
C: inadmissible, as it lacks direct connection to the case.
D: admissible, as evidence of the store's negligence.
E: inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.
F: inadmissible, as it is hearsay evidence.
G: admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.
H: inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.
I: admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.

Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got this question about evidence law, specifically regarding a customer's testimony and a store's statement. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is a customer suing a grocery store for injuries sustained from a collision with the store's doors. The customer says the doors were set to swing outward at the time of the accident, but they were surprised because they thought that might have caused people to leave. The store denied any liability, and the main issue is whether the customer's testimony is admissible.

Now, what's the key here? I remember that evidence can be admissible if it meets certain criteria, like being direct, relevant, and not biased. Also, the credibility of the testimony matters. If the customer is a witness, her testimony might be admissible, but there are exceptions.

Looking at the sister's testimony. She testified about witnessing the doors swinging outward, which struck her, and then when she returned the next week, the doors were reprogrammed inward. The trial judge is trying to rule on whether her testimony is admissible.

So, I need to assess the credibility and admissibility of her testimony. The sister is a first-hand witness, so that's a plus. But wait, could there be any bias here? If the store had a policy that doors would swing outward, which the customer thought might cause people to leave, that might influence the witness's perception. But the customer's own testimony, from the accident, was direct and factual. The sister's testimony was about what she saw, which could be seen as corroborating the same facts.

Wait, but does the sister's testimony provide any additional information that could be used to prove the store's negligence? Or is it just adding another angle? Alternatively, the store's statement about the doors being unsafe might have been an admission, but that's a different issue. The sister's testimony is about her own experience, which is more direct.

Also, is there a public policy consideration? The store's doors were programmed outward, which could be seen as a design flaw. But the sister's testimony isn't about the store's product; it's about what she saw. So that's probably not the issue.

Another angle: is the testimony of the sister inadmissible as hearsay? No, because she's a witness and her testimony is about events that happened. Unless it's hearsay without a direct connection to the case. But here, the sister's testimony is about the store's doors, which were a product. So maybe not hearsay.

Wait, wait. The store's statement about the doors being in any way unsafe is being denied. The sister is testifying about what she saw. So the store's statement is about the doors, not about the customer's witness. So the sister's testimony is separate and unrelated, but still hearsay. But does that make it admissible?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Admissible hearsay requires a direct connection. The sister's testimony about the doors is about the store's doors, which are a product. So does that count as a separate issue? Or is the store's statement about the doors (which they denied) acting as a defense?

Wait, the trial judge is considering whether the sister's testimony is admissible. The store's statement that the doors were in a way unsafe was denied, but the sister's testimony about what she saw is separate. So the sister's testimony is about the events, which could be admissible.

Wait, another point: is the sister's testimony about the doors a hearsay witness? Because the store said the doors were swinging outward, but the sister saw them swinging outward as well. So the store's statement could be used as an admission, but the sister's testimony is about her own experience, which is more direct.

Wait, but the trial judge is considering the sister's testimony. So if the sister's testimony is hearsay, it must be admissible only if it has a direct connection to the case. The store's statement about the doors being unsafe was denied, but the sister's testimony is about the customer's experience. So the store's statement doesn't directly relate to her testimony, unless the store's statement was about a defect in the doors.

Wait, no. The customer's testimony, which included the doors swinging outward, was about the accident, which led to injury. The sister's testimony is about the store's doors and their subsequent reprogramming. So the store's statement about the doors being in a way unsafe was inadmissible because it's a statement from the store, not the customer's statement. So the sister's testimony isn't about the store's product, but about the events of the accident.

So the sister's testimony is hearsay, but if it's an admission, it might not be necessary. Or is it a proper statement? She testified about what she saw, which is a direct statement about the event, so it should be admissible.

Wait, but the issue is whether the testimony is admissible. So, the sister's testimony is about the events that happened, so it's a proper statement. But wait, is the store's statement about the doors considered hearsay? Because the store's statement was made about the store's doors, which were a product, so the store's statement is about the product, not the event, so the customer's testimony and sister's testimony are separate.

Wait, but the store's statement was about the doors swinging outward, which was a product issue. The sister's testimony is about her own experience. So the sister's testimony is a direct statement about the event, making it admissible as a witness account.

Wait, but the problem is whether the sister's testimony is hearsay. If the store had a policy that doors would swing outward, the customer's own testimony would have shown that the doors were swinging outward. The sister's testimony is about what she saw, which is another statement about the same event. So the witness's statements are both about the same event, so perhaps they're not inadmissible.

Wait, but the sister's testimony is about the store's doors, which were a product, not the accident. So the store's statement is about a product, not the event. So the sister's testimony is hearsay, but is it admissible as a witness's account.

Wait, the standard for hearsay is that it must have a direct connection to the case. If the sister's testimony is about a specific event (her seeing the doors), then it's relevant. So it's admissible.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the sister's testimony is about the store's doors, which were a product, not the accident, so it's not hearsay. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

When a witness gives testimony about the events of an accident, it's admissible because it's a statement about the facts. So even if the product was a part of the accident, the statement is about the event, so the testimony is admissible.

So the sister's testimony is admissible as a witness's account of the event. So the trial judge would rule it inadmissible if it's hearsay without a direct connection. Wait, but the sister's testimony is about the accident, so it's a proper statement.

Wait, but the store's statement about the doors was a fact from the accident, so the customer's testimony was about that fact. The sister's testimony is about her own experience, but she's a witness, so her testimony is admissible.

Wait, but wait another point. The store's statement about the doors being in a way unsafe was denied. The sister's testimony about the doors being reprogrammed inward is about her own experience. So the store's statement about the doors was a separate fact, but the sister's testimony is about her own account, which is about the same event.

So the sister's testimony is admissible. So option B would say admissible as a first-hand account of the event. But wait, the question is about whether the sister's testimony is admissible.

Wait, another angle: if the store's statement was about the doors (which were a product), then the store's statement is not hearsay. But the customer's statement about the doors being swinging outward is about the accident, which is hearsay. So the customer's testimony is hearsay, and the sister's is a separate statement about the event. So neither is hearsay.

Wait, but the trial judge is considering the sister's testimony. So she's a witness, so her testimony is admissible.

Alternatively, maybe the store's statement about the doors is hearsay because it's a statement about a product, not an event. But the store's statement was part of the accident and was denied. Wait, no— the store's statement was about the doors, which were part of the accident. The customer's testimony was about the doors swinging outward during the accident. So the store's statement was part of the accident.

Wait, but the question is about whether the sister's testimony is admissible. So the sister's testimony is about the event (her seeing the doors), so it's admissible as a first-hand account.

But wait, another point: if the store's statement was about the doors being in a way unsafe, the customer's statement about the doors swinging outward (which was their belief) would be hearsay. So the customer's testimony is hearsay, but the sister's is about her own experience, making it admissible.

So the trial judge would find the sister's testimony admissible as a first-hand witness. So the answer would be B or another option, but let me look at the options.

The options are:

A: inadmissible due to bias

B: admissible, first-hand

C: inadmissible as lack direct connection

D: admissible as evidence of negligence

E: inadmissible on public policy

F: inadmissible as hearsay

G: tacit admission

H: inadmissible on irrelevance

I: commonsense impression

So, the sister's testimony is admissible as a first-hand account. So B is the answer.
</think>

The customer's testimony about the doors swinging outward during the accident is admissible as a first-hand witness account of the event. The sister's testimony, which describes what she saw about the doors swinging outward, is also admissible as it directly relates to the events of the accident. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony inadmissible only if it lacked a direct connection to the case, but in this case, it is admissible as a first-hand account.

ANSWER: B
