Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the kinetic energy and speed of nitrogen molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question gives me a temperature of 300 K and asks for the average kinetic energy of air molecules, then the typical speed of nitrogen molecules. They also give the mass of a nitrogen molecule as 4.68e-26 kg. The options are A to J, each with two parts: energy in J and speed in m/s.

Wait, I remember from my studies that the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule is related to temperature. Oh right, the formula for average kinetic energy is (3/2)kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature in Kelvin. But wait, some sources say this is for an ideal gas, but I'm not sure if that matters here. Maybe I should proceed as if that's applicable.

So, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Let me plug in the numbers. The temperature is 300 K. So, 3/2 * k * T is (3/2) * (1.38e-23 J/K) * 300 K. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 300 times 1.38e-23 is 4.14e-21, then multiplied by 3/2 (which is 1.5) gives 6.21e-21 J. So the average kinetic energy would be about 6.21e-21 J. Looking at the options, let's see which have that value.

Looking at the options: let's see. Option A is 6.21e-21 J for energy. Then the speed part. For the speed, I think the formula comes from the kinetic energy equation. Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So if (1/2)mv² equals the average kinetic energy, then v can be found as sqrt(2KE/m).

Wait wait, let's double-check. Average kinetic energy is (3/2)kT, which is the same as (1/2)m v^2 at thermal equilibrium? No, no, wait. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy per molecule is (3/2)kT, which is equal to (1/2)mv^2. So yes, both expressions are correct.

So for the speed, KE = (1/2)mv^2. So solving for v: v = sqrt(2*KE/m).

We have KE as 6.21e-21 J and m as 4.68e-26 kg. Let me compute 2*KE/m first.

2 * 6.21e-21 = 1.242e-20. Divided by 4.68e-26 kg: 1.242e-20 /4.68e-26 = Let me compute that. 

Dividing 1.242e-20 by 4.68e-26 is the same as (1.242 /4.68) * 1e6. Because e-20 /e-26 is e6.

1.242 /4.68 is approximately 0.266 (since 4.68 * 0.266 is about 1.25). So 0.266 * 1e6 = 2.66e5 m²/s². Taking the square root gives 163 m/s.

Wait wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it more carefully.

KE is 6.21e-21 J. So 2 * KE is 1.242e-20 J. Divide by m (4.68e-26 kg): 1.242e-20 /4.68e-26.

Let me write it as (1.242 / 4.68) * (1e-20 /1e-26) = (0.266) * 1e6 = 2.66e5 m²/s². Then sqrt is about 163 m/s. Hmm, but let's compute it accurately.

Alternatively, let me compute 6.21e-21 *2 = 1.242e-20.

Divide by 4.68e-26: 1.242e-20 /4.68e-26 = (1.242/4.68) * (1e6) = approximately 0.266 * 1e6 = 2.66e5. Then sqrt(2.66e5) is sqrt(266000). Let me compute that.

Well, 515^2 is 265,225. Because 500^2 is 250,000, 510^2 is 260,100. 515^2 is (500 +15)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*15 +15^2 = 250000 +15000 +225= 265225. So 515^2 is 265225, which is close to 266000. So the speed is approximately 515 m/s, but wait, wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the calculation gives 2.66e5, which is 266,000. So the square root of 266,000 is approximately 515 m/s, because 515^2 is 265,225, which is about 775 less than 266,000. So 515 m/s is approximate.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which have speed around 515 m/s. Let's go through the options.

Option A: speed 5.15e2 m/s (515 m/s). Yes. So energy is 6.21e-21 J.

Option B: speed 4.20e2 m/s (420 m/s). No.

Option D: speed 6.21e2 m/s (621 m/s). No.

Option E: speed 3e2 m/s (300 m/s). No.

Option F: speed 4.5e2 m/s (450 m/s). No.

Option G: speed 3.15e2 m/s (315 m/s). No.

Option H: speed 6.7e2 m/s (670 m/s). No.

Option I: speed 1.5e2 m/s (150 m/s). No.

Option J: speed 7e2 m/s (700 m/s). No.

So only option A and option D have the correct energy. But wait, option A's speed is 515 m/s and option D's speed is 621 m/s. Which is which?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. The KE is 6.21e-21 J. So, 2*KE is 1.242e-20. Divided by m (4.68e-26) gives 1.242e-20 /4.68e-26 = 2.66e5.

Wait, sqrt(2.66e5) is sqrt(266000) = approx 515.3 m/s.

So the speed should be about 515 m/s. Looking back, option A has speed 515 m/s, and energy 6.21e-21 J. So option A is correct.

Wait, but another option, option D, has energy 5.15e-21 J, which is not the same as our calculated 6.21e-21. So option D is out.

Wait, but hold on. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the speed. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 2 * KE is 1.242e-20 J. Divided by m (4.68e-26 kg) gives 1.242e-20 /4.68e-26.

1.242e-20 /4.68e-26 = (1.242 /4.68) * 1e6 = ?

1.242 /4.68 = 0.266 approximately. So 0.266 * 1e6 = 2.66e5. So sqrt(2.66e5) is sqrt(266000)= approx 515.3 m/s.

So the speed is about 515 m/s, which is option A's speed.

So the correct answer is option A: 6.21e-21 J, 5.15e2 m/s (515 m/s).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.15e2 m/s, which is 515 m/s. So that matches.

But wait, wait, let me check the KE calculation again. The average kinetic energy is (3/2)kT.

Given that k is 1.38e-23 J/K, T=300 K.

So (3/2)*1.38e-23 *300 = (3/2)*4.14e-21 = 6.21e-21 J. Yes, that's correct.

So the average KE is correct as 6.21e-21 J.

The speed comes to approximately 515 m/s, so option A is correct.

To determine the average kinetic energy of air molecules at 300 K and the typical speed of nitrogen molecules, we use the following relationships:

1. **Average Kinetic Energy**:  
   The average kinetic energy of a gas molecule is given by:  
   \[
   KE = \frac{3}{2}kT
   \]  
   where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant (\(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)) and \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin.

   Substituting \(T = 300 \, \text{K}\):  
   \[
   KE = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 300 = 6.21 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Thus, the average kinetic energy is \(6.21 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}\).

2. **Speed of Nitrogen Molecules**:  
   The average kinetic energy of a molecule is also expressed as:  
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]  
   Rearranging for \(v\):  
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2KE}{m}}
   \]  
   where \(m\) is the mass of a nitrogen molecule (\(4.68 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}\)).

   Substituting \(KE = 6.21 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}\) and \(m = 4.68 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}\):  
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 6.21 \times 10^{-21}}{4.68 \times 10^{-26}}}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   v = \sqrt{\frac{1.242 \times 10^{-20}}{4.68 \times 10^{-26}}} = \sqrt{2.66 \times 10^5} \approx 515 \, \text{m/s}
   \]  
   Thus, the typical speed of nitrogen molecules is \(5.15 \times 10^2 \, \text{m/s}\).

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   - Option A: \(6.21 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}\) for energy and \(5.15 \times 10^2 \, \text{m/s}\) for speed.  
   - Option D: \(5.15 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}\) for energy and \(6.21 \times 10^2 \, \text{m/s}\) for speed.  

   Option A matches both the energy and speed values.
