Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about theories of morality. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking about two types of theories: one that's normative and one that's ethical, or something like that. Hmm.

The question is structured as a contrast between two concepts. The first blank is asking what theory is described as a code of conduct for all rational beings, and the second is the opposite, contrasting it with another type of morality.

Wait, I remember from my studies that there are different theories about morality. I think one is called the Code of Conduct, which I believe is a set of rules everyone should follow, like the Golden Rule in ethics. That sounds like a normative theory because it's about what's right and wrong for everyone.

Then there's the ethical theory, which is what a particular group or society has. So the ethical theory would be tied to a specific society's values. For example, some ethical theories might be based on religious beliefs or cultural norms. So the first blank is about a normative theory, and the second is about an ethical theory.

Looking at the options, the first blank needs a noun that fits. Let's see the options:

A: Normative, Ethical
B: Ethical, Descriptive
C: Normative, Instrumental
D: Normative, Descriptive
E: Descriptive, Ethical
F: Ethical, Normative
G: Instrumental, Normative
H: Descriptive, Normative
I: Normative, Prescriptive
J: Descriptive, Prescriptive

Wait, I'm trying to think about each term. So, the first blank is about a theory that applies to all rational beings. That's like a universal code of conduct. The opposite would be an ethical theory tied to a particular group or society. So, the first term is normative, and the second is ethical.

So the options are A and F. Let me think about what the second term is. Ethical theory is the code society uses, like the code of Hammurabi or the Code of Hammurabi's law. So the second blank should be Ethical.

Looking at the options, A is "Normative, Ethical" and F is "Ethical, Normative". So the question is asking which is the first blank and which is the second.

The question says the first blank is a normative theory, and the second is the opposite, which is an ethical theory. So the first is normative, the second is ethical. So the first blank is A's first part, the second blank is A's second part. Wait, no. Wait, the first blank is "_______ theory can be described as a code of conduct to which all rational beings should adhere." So the first blank is the code for all rational beings, which is normative because it's a universal rule. The second part is the opposite, which is the code of conduct adopted by a particular group or society. So the second blank is ethical theory.

So looking at the options, the first blank is normative, and the second is ethical. So option A is correct. Because option A says "Normative, Ethical." Option F is "Ethical, Normative," which would be the reverse, which isn't what the question is asking.

Another way to check: what do the other options say? Let's see:

Option B: Ethical, Descriptive. No, that's not right. Descriptive is about describing how things are, not about a code.

Option C: Normative, Instrumental. Instrumental is about utility or value, not a code of conduct.

Option D: Normative, Descriptive. Again, that's not the opposite.

Option E: Descriptive, Ethical. Hmm, that's probably not. Descriptive is about description, not a code.

Option F: Ethical, Normative. This would mean the first is ethical (the society's code) and the second is normative (the universal code). But the question asks which is the opposite of the other. So if the first is normative, the second should be ethical. So option F is the reverse, which isn't what the question wants.

So the correct answer is A: Normative, Ethical.

The first blank refers to a normative theory, which is a universal code of conduct for all rational beings. The second blank refers to an ethical theory, tied to a particular group or society. This makes the correct answer:

ANSWER: A
