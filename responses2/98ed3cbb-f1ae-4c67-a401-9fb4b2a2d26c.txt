Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about Hopewell culture. Hmm, let me think through it. The question is asking which element Hopewell culture did NOT lack. The options are A: formal government, B: monumental earthworks, C: urban centers, D: a permanent military.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on Hopewell culture. From what I remember, Hopewell is a pre-Hopewell culture, so they didn't have a formal state like the British Empire. They were a civilization that lived in small communities, right?

Let me go through each option. Option A is formal government. I think Hopewell had a system of local governments, but I'm not sure if they were fully formal. Also, when I think of formal government, maybe the British Empire had a more structured system, so perhaps Hopewell didn't have a formal government. Or wait, maybe they did have some sort of local administrative structure. I'm a bit unsure, but I think Hopewell had some kind of governance, maybe not a constitutional government but more local.

Option B is monumental earthworks. I believe Hopewell had significant cultural practices, like the Hopewell Code, which involved creating intricate stone carvings and structures. These were massive, so B is probably something they did have. So the question is, which element they lack.

Option C is urban centers. Hopewell was known for their settlements, which were usually small, located in rural areas. I don't think they had major urban centers in the same way that, say, the Amish or Native American tribes did. So maybe urban centers were missing from their culture.

Option D is a permanent military. Hopewell had a strong military, relying on their knowledge of navigation and engineering to protect their communities. I think they had a permanent military system, so D is something they did have.

So putting it together: they had a formal government? Maybe not as much as the British Empire, but I'm not certain. They had monumental earthworks, so B is something they had. Urban centers were probably not part of their culture, so C is the answer. They had a permanent military, so D is something they had.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about A. In the British Empire, a formal government is a thingâ€”like the Articles of Confederation. But Hopewell was more about regional governance. So maybe they didn't have a formal state government. So the question is, which element they did NOT lack. So the answer would be A: formal government. Because Hopewell didn't have a formal state government, but had local governance.

So the answer is A.

The correct answer is A: formal government. Hopewell culture lacked a formal state government, had no permanent military, and did not have urban centers like the Amish or Native American tribes. However, they did have monumental earthworks, which aligns with option B. Since the question asks for what they did NOT lack, formal government (A) is the correct choice.

Answer: A
