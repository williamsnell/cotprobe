Question:

Consider that in horses a single pair of genes controls gait. Some horses can only exhibit a trotting gait, while others exhibit only a pacing gait. In an attempt to determine the pattern of inheritance displayed by this trait, a horse breeder crossed a stallion (\male) that came from a long line of pacers to several mares (\venus) that were trotters. All of the foals were trotters. Which gait is under the control of the dominant gene? Using the letters T and t to represent the dominant and recessive genes, respectively, identify the genotypes of the stallion, the mares and the foals.

Options:

A: Trotting gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is TT, that of the mares is tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
B: Pacing gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is tt.
C: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
D: Trotting gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is TT, that of the mares is Tt, and the genotypes of the foals is tt.
E: Trotting gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is TT.
F: Trotting gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
G: Trotting gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is Tt, and the genotypes of the foals is tt.
H: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is Tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
I: Pacing gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
J: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is TT, that of the mares is tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.

Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about horse gait and inheritance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it. The question is about how the gait (tramping or trotting) is determined by a single pair of genes in horses. So, genes for gait are probably a simple Mendelian trait.

The setup is a breeder crossed a stallion (male) from a long line of pacers to several mares (venus) who are trotters. All the foals ended up being trotters. So, the question is about figuring out which gene is dominant and recessive, and the genotypes involved.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each with different combinations. Let me think about the possible scenarios.

First, I remember that in a dominant-recessive model, the dominant allele (T) is expressed, and the recessive (t) is not. So, if a horse has at least one dominant allele, it will express the dominant trait.

In this case, the horses are either trotters or mares. The question is about how their gait is determined. The stallion is from a long line of pacers, who presumably are mares. So, the stallion must be a male from a racing lineage. But since the mares are trotters, perhaps their genotype is tt, because if they were Tt, they would exhibit the dominant trait (trailing), which they do. But wait, the question says that the mares are trotters, so their genotype is tt.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The question says that the mares are all trotters. So, their gait is determined by the dominant gene. Because if they are tt, they would exhibit the recessive trait (trailing). But they're showing a dominant trait (trailing), so their genotype must be TT. Because if they're Tt, they'd show the dominant trait, but if they're tt, they would show the recessive.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backward. Let me clarify. The scenario is that the mares are trotters. If the dominant gene is T, then having at least one T allele will make them show the dominant gait. So, if a horse is Tt, it would show the dominant trait. If it's tt, it shows the recessive.

So, the mares are all trotters. So, they must have at least one dominant gene. So, their genotype is either TT or Tt. But wait, let's think about their parents.

The mares are from a line of racers, who presumably are either all Tt or TT. Wait, but the question says that the mares are all trotters. So, their genotype must be TT because if they were Tt, they would be showing the dominant trait (trailing). So, wait, that would mean the mares are TT because they are showing the dominant trait. But wait, the question says that the mares are all Tooters, which would mean that they have the dominant trait. So their genotype is at least one T. So, could it be that the mares are all TT.

Wait, but the question says that the mares are all Tooters. So, their genotype must be TT because recessive would be tt, showing the other trait. So, the mares are all TT.

So, the mares are all TT. Now, the stallion is from a long line of pacers. Pacers are likely to be mares, but perhaps they are all tt because if they were Tt, they would express the dominant trait (trailing). But the question states that the mares are all Tooters, which suggests that the dominant trait is the gait. So, the mares are all TT.

So, the stallion is from a line of pacers, which are mares, but perhaps they are all tt. Because if they were Tt, they would show the dominant trait, but the question says that the mares are all Tooters. So the stallion must be tt, because if it were Tt, the horse would be a Tooter, but the question says all foals are Tooters.

Wait, no. The question says that the mares are all Tooters, which implies that the dominant trait is Tooters. So, the mares are all TT. The stallion is male, so let's say it's a Tt genotype. Because if the stallion were TT, then all foals would be TT (since mares are all TT). But the question says that all the foals are Tooters, which would happen only if the dominant allele is present in the offspring.

Alternatively, if the dominant gene is T, the mares are TT, the stallion is Tt, then when they mate, their offspring would be Tt (from T from mares and t from stallion) or TT (if both T). So, all foals would be Tooters if the dominant gene is present in any of their parents.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Let's model the possible genotypes.

Stallion genotype: Let's denote the dominant gene as T and recessive as t.

The mares (parents of the foals) are all trotters (TT). The stallion is male, so he must be either Tt or tt. Because if he were TT, then all foals would be TT, which would all be Tooters, which matches the question. If the stallion were Tt, then the foals could be either TT or Tt. If the mares are all TT, then:

If the stallion is TT, then all foals would be TT: so all Tooters. This would fit the question.

If the stallion is Tt, then the foals could be TT (with probability 50%) or Tt (50%). If a Tooter is present (i.e., if any of the offspring is TT), then the dominant trait is expressed.

But wait, the question says that all foals are Tooters. So, the only way that all of them are Tooters is if the dominant gene is present in the gametes passed on, which would require that the stallion is TT.

Wait, but the question is about the gait trait. So, the dominant gene (T) determines the gait.

So, the scenario is that the mares are all Tooters. Therefore, their genotype must be TT. The stallion is male, so his genotype must be either Tt or tt.

If the stallion were Tt, then when he mated with a Tooter (TT), the offspring would have a 50% chance of being Tt (from T from father and t from mother) and 50% chance of being TT (from T from father and T from mother). So, all foals would be Tooters. Alternatively, if the stallion were TT, the foals would all be Tooters as well.

Wait, but that doesn't change the situation. So, the question is, what is the dominant gene?

If the dominant gene (T) is present, the gait is Tooters; if not, the gait is trotters.

So, the mares are all Tooters. So, their genotype is TT. The stallion is either Tt or tt.

If the stallion is Tt, then when he mated with a Tooter (TT), the offspring would have a 50% chance of being Tt (so Tooters) and 50% chance of being TT (so Tooters). Therefore, all foals are Tooters.

If the stallion were tt, then all the foals would be tt, which would be Trotters, which doesn't match the scenario. So the stallion must be Tt, because otherwise, the foals would all be Tooters only if the stallion is Tt, but if the stallion is tt, the foals would be t t, which are Trotters.

So, the scenario is that the mares are all Tooters (TT), the stallion is Tt (so he has at least one dominant T allele), and the foals are all Tooters because they're either Tt or TT.

So, the dominant gene is T, and the recessive is t.

Now, the question is about the genotypes.

So, for the stallion: he is Tt.

The mares (even though the question says their genotype is TT) have genotype TT.

The foals: all are Tooters, so their genotype is Tt or TT.

So, the options given are:

Looking at the options, which one matches this scenario.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Tooters are dominant (T). Stallsion is Tt, mares are TT, foals are TT. But wait, the mares are all Tooters, so their genotype is TT. The foals are Tooters, so their genotype is Tt or TT.

So, option E says mares are TT, which is correct. Stallsion is Tt, which is correct. Foals are TT, which would be Tooters. But wait, that would mean all foals are Tooters, which is correct.

Wait, but the scenario is that the stallion is Tt (because if he was tt, the foals would all be t t, which are Trotters, which doesn't match the given situation). So, stallion must be Tt.

So, the genotypes are:

Stallion: Tt

Mares: TT

Foals: Tt or TT.

Looking at the options, which option matches this.

Looking at option E: Tooters are dominant (T). Stallsion is Tt, mares are TT, and foals are TT. But wait, that would mean that the foals are Tooters, which is correct because the question says all are Tooters. So, in this case, the dominant gene is T, and the mares are TT.

Wait, but according to the scenario, the mares are all Tooters, which is TT. The stallion is Tt. So, the genotypes are stallion Tt, mares TT, and foals Tt or TT.

Looking again at the options:

Option E says mares are TT (correct), stallion Tt (correct), and foals are TT (which would be Tooters, which is what the scenario says). So, option E would say that.

Wait, but option E says that the foals are TT. But the question says all the foals are Tooters. So, that's correct because Tooters are T, so Tt and TT are both Tooters.

So, option E would have:

Stallion: Tt → mares: TT → foals: TT.

Which would imply that all the foals are Tooters, which matches the scenario.

Looking back at the options, option E is:

E: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. Stallsion is Tt, mares are TT, and foals are TT.

Wait, but according to our analysis, the dominant gene is T, and the mares are TT, which are Tooters. The stallion is Tt, and the foals are Tooters. So, option E’s description of the foals as TT is correct.

But wait, the question says that the mares are all Tooters, which is correct with TT. The stallion is Tt, and the foals are Tooters.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the foffals are TT. But according to the scenario, the foffals are Tooters, which are T. So, the description is correct.

But wait, option E says that the gait is controlled by T, which is correct. So, the options are:

Looking again at the options, option E is:

E: Pacing gait is controlled by T. Stallsion Tt, mares TT, foals TT.

But wait, in this case, the mares are TT (all Tooters), the stallion is Tt (so has a dominant T), and the foals are Tooters (either Tt or TT).

Wait, but option E's description of the foals is TT, which is correct, but the question says all the foals are Tooters.

So, option E would be correct.

But wait, another option is option D: Tooters are recessive? No, that would make them t. But in our scenario, the mares are Tooters, so the dominant is T.

Wait, no. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the letters mixed. The options use t for recessive. So, for the question, the dominant is T, and the recessive is t.

So, in the scenario, the gait is Tooters (T), so the dominant gene is T.

So, looking at the options, the correct scenario is that the dominant is T, and the recessive is t.

So, the correct answer should have dominant T, recessive t.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Tooters are T (dominant), mares TT (so gait Tooters), stallion Tt (so gait Tooters), and foals TT (so Tooters). So, this fits.

But wait, the question says that the gait is controlled by the dominant gene, which is T. So, the correct answer should have the dominant gene as T.

Looking back at the options, option E is that.

But wait, what about option D?

Option D says that the dominant is t, which would make the gait recessive. But in our scenario, the mares are Tooters, which suggests that the dominant is T.

So, option D would have mares as tt, which would be Trotters, which is not the case.

Wait, but in the question, the mares are all Tooters, which is T. So, the dominant is T.

So, the correct option is E.

Wait, but I'm confused because option E says that the stallion is Tt, mares are TT, and the foals are TT. So, the foals are Tooters, which matches the given scenario.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option E: Pacing gait is controlled by T. Stallsion is Tt, mares TT, and foals TT.

Wait, but the question says that the mares are all Tooters. So, their genotype is TT. So, the mares are TT.

The stallion is Tt, so that's correct.

The foals are Tooters, so their genotypes are Tt or TT.

So, option E says that the foals are TT. But in reality, the foals could be Tt or TT. So, option E's description of the foals as TT is correct, but it's not necessary if the actual genotype can be Tt or TT. So, the correct answer is that the foffals are Tooters, which is correct.

But looking back, the options are about the gait, not about the foals. So, the question is about the gait, not the genotype of the offspring.

But in the options, the gait is determined, so the correct option must have the gait in the dominant or recessive.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial analysis. The question is whether the dominant is T or t.

Wait, the question says the gait is controlled by T or t. So, the dominant is the same as the letter.

So, in our case, the gait is Tooters (the dominant), so T is dominant.

Options E and others have T as the dominant.

Looking at the options:

Option E says that the gait is T, and the mares are TT, stallion is Tt, and foals are TT.

So, the mares are TT (so gait Tooters), stallion is Tt (so gait Tooters), and the foals are TT (so Tooters).

Wait, but the question states that all foals are Tooters. So, option E is correct.

But wait, no. The scenario is that the mares are Tooters (so their genotype is TT), stallion is Tt, and foals are Tooters (so their genotype is Tt or TT).

So, looking for which option's description matches the scenario.

Option E: Stallsion is Tt, mares TT, foals TT.

But wait, that would mean all foals are Tooters, which fits the scenario.

But wait, the scenario says that the mares are Tooters (so their genotype is TT), the stallion is Tt, and the foals are Tooters.

So, the correct answer is the one where the mares are TT (so gait Tooters), the stallion is Tt, and the foals are Tooters.

Looking at the options:

Option E says mares are TT, stallion is Tt, and foals are TT.

Which would mean all the foals are Tooters, which is correct. So, option E would be correct.

Wait, but the options are:

Looking at the options again, it's a multiple-choice question with options A to J. Each option gives the dominant and recessive letters, the genotypes of the stallion, mares, and foals.

So, the correct option is the one where the dominant gene is T, mares are TT, stallion is Tt, and foals are Tooters (so T).

Wait, in the options, option E says:

E: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is TT.

But according to our scenario, the mares are TT, the stallion is Tt, and the foals are Tooters (either Tt or TT). So, the correct genotype for the foals is Tooters, which is the same as T.

But in the options, option E says the foals are TT. But according to the scenario, the foals are Tooters, which is T, so the option E's description would be correct in terms of the gait, but the actual genotype of the foals might be Tt or TT.

But in the options, the gait is determined by the dominant letter. So, the correct option is the one where the dominant is T, and the genotypes of the parents and offspring are correct.

So, the correct option would be option E.

Wait, but the question's options are:

Looking at the options, which one matches the scenario.

Option E: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene (T). Stallsion is Tt, mares are TT, foals are TT.

But wait, the scenario is that all foals are Tooters. So, if the correct option is E, then the correct genotypes are stallion Tt, mares TT, and foals TT.

Which would be correct because in that case, all foals are Tooters.

But wait, if the mares are TT (so gait Tooters), the stallion is Tt (so Tooters), and the foals are Tooters, that's correct.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option E says the mares are TT (correct), the stallion is Tt (correct), and the foals are TT (correct). So that would fit.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because earlier I thought that option E would have the foffals as TT, which would be Tooters, which is correct.

But let's look for the option that correctly describes the scenario. So, the correct scenario is that the dominant is T, mares are TT, stallion Tt, and foals are Tooters.

Looking at the options, option E says:

E: Pacing gait is controlled by T. Stallsion Tt, mares TT, and foals TT.

So, that would mean all the foals are Tooters, which is correct. So, option E would be correct.

Wait, but the options are:

Looking at the options again, it's a multiple-choice question with options A to J. Each option gives the dominant and recessive letters, the genotypes of the stallion, mares, and foals.

So, the correct option is the one where the dominant gene is T, mares are TT, stallion is Tt, and foals are Tooters.

Which option is that?

Looking at the options:

Option E says mares are TT, stallion Tt, foals TT.

So, that would match.

Wait, but wait. Another option, option D, says:

D: Pacing gait is controlled by recessive. So, t is recessive.

So, if the mares have tt genotype, then their gait would be Trotters.

But in the scenario, the mares are Tooters, which would require that their genotype be at least one T. So, if the mares are tt, their gait would be t (Trotters), which contradicts the scenario.

So, the correct option must have the mares as TT, which would be Tooters.

So, looking for an option where the mares are TT, the stallion is Tt, and the foals are Tooters.

Looking at the options:

Option E says mares are TT, stallion Tt, and foals TT.

Therefore, option E is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option E's description of the foffals is TT, which would be Tooters. So, that is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is option E.
</think>

The question involves determining the gait (Tooters or Trotters) based on the inheritance of a dominant or recessive allele. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Identify the gait**: The mares are all Tooters, indicating that the dominant gait is Tooters. This implies that the dominant allele (T) is present in the mares.

2. **Determine the genotypes**:
   - The mares are all Tooters, so their genotype is **TT**.
   - The stallion is male, so his genotype depends on whether the dominant allele (T) is present. If the stallion is **Tt**, he will produce gametes that can result in Tooters (T) or T (t). If the stallion is **tt**, he will produce t gametes, resulting in Trotters.
   - Since all foals are Tooters, the stallion must carry at least one dominant allele (T). Therefore, the stallion is **Tt**.

3. **Analyze the options**:
   - **Option E**: States that the gait is controlled by the dominant gene (T). The stallion is **Tt**, the mares are **TT**, and the foffals are **TT**. This fits the scenario because the mares are Tooters, the stallion is Tt (resulting in Tooters), and the foffals are Tooters.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option E**.

ANSWER: E
