Question:

Kerri ran the same distance in four different races. Her times were 18.04 seconds, 21.39 seconds, 12.99 seconds, and 14.14 seconds. If the individual times are rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a second, what is the estimate of Kerri's total time for all four races?

Options:

A: 66.5 seconds
B: 64.5 seconds
C: 65.6 seconds
D: 66.6 seconds
E: 68 seconds
F: 65.5 seconds
G: 66.4 seconds
H: 66 seconds
I: 67 seconds
J: 67.5 seconds

Okay, so I have this problem where Kerri ran four races and I need to find her total time, rounded to the nearest tenth of a second. The times given are 18.04, 21.39, 12.99, and 14.14 seconds. The options are A to J, each being a different time. I need to add these four times together and then round the total to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, let me think. First, I should add the times step by step. Let me write them down:

18.04 
+21.39 
+12.99 
+14.14 
= ?

Let me add them one by one. Starting with 18.04 and 21.39. 

Adding 18.04 and 21.39: 

18 +21 = 39, and 0.04 +0.39=0.43. So 39.43.

Now, add 12.99 to that. 

39.43 +12.99. Let me see, 39+12=51, 0.43+0.99=1.42, so 51+1.42=52.42.

Next, add 14.14 to 52.42.

52.42 +14.14. 

52 +14=66, 0.42+0.14=0.56. So 66.56.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because when adding decimals, sometimes it's easier to line them up properly.

Let me try adding all four times more accurately:

18.04
21.39
12.99
14.14
= ?

Adding the seconds: 18 +21=39, 39+12=51, 51+14=65.

Adding the hundredths: 0.04 +0.39=0.43, 0.43+0.99=1.42, 1.42+0.14=0.56.

So total time is 65.56 seconds?

Wait, but that can’t be right because when I add the times step by step, I got 65.56. But the options don't have 65.56. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is 66.5, which is higher, B is 64.5, which is lower, C is 65.6, D is 66.6, E is 68, F is 65.5, G is 66.4, H is 66, I is 67, J is 67.5.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me recalculate.

Let me add each time accurately:

18.04
+21.39
+12.99
+14.14
= ?

Let me add the seconds and the decimal parts separately.

First, sum the whole numbers: 18 +21=39, 39+12=51, 51+14=65. So that's 65 seconds.

Now the decimal parts: 0.04 + 0.39=0.43; 0.43+0.99=1.42; 1.42+0.14=0.56.

So total time is 65.56 seconds.

Wait, but when I look at the options, I don't see 65.56. The closest options are F (65.5) and G (66.4). So perhaps I made a mistake in addition.

Wait, maybe I should add them in a different order.

Let me try adding 18.04 and 12.99 first.

18.04 +12.99 = ?

18 +12 is 30. 0.04 +0.99=1.03. So 31.03.

Now add 21.39: 31.03 +21.39. 31+21=52, 0.03+0.39=0.42. So 52.42.

Then add 14.14: 52.42 +14.14.

52+14=66, 0.42+0.14=0.56. So 66.56.

Wait, this gives the same result as before. Hmm, but none of the options have 66.56. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question says each time is rounded to the nearest tenth of a second before adding. Oh wait, no, the question says the individual times are rounded to the nearest tenth before adding. So each time is first rounded, then added.

Wait, that's a different approach. So maybe I should first round each time to the nearest tenth, then sum them.

Let me check each time:

18.04 seconds: to the nearest tenth. Look at the hundredth place, which is 0.04. Since 4 is less than 5, it rounds down. So 18.0.

21.39: the hundredth is 9, which is 9 >=5, so round up. 21.4.

12.99: the hundredth is 9, round up. 13.0.

14.14: hundredth is 4, less than 5, so 14.1.

Wait, so the times after rounding are: 18.0, 21.4, 13.0, 14.1.

Now, let's add them.

18.0 +21.4 =39.4

39.4 +13.0 =52.4

52.4 +14.1 =66.5.

Wait, that's 66.5 seconds. Looking at the options, option A is 66.5. So that's an option. But wait, I thought the initial approach without rounding gave 65.56, which isn't an option either. So maybe the question is asking to round each time to the nearest tenth before adding, leading to 66.5.

But let's double-check because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, in the first approach, the initial sum was 65.56, which rounds to 65.6 or 65.5 depending on rounding rules. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is to round each time to the nearest tenth before adding.

Wait, let me re-calculate each time:

18.04 → to the nearest tenth: 18.0 (since the hundredth is 0 which is less than 5).

21.39 → 21.4 (since the hundredth is 9 ≥5).

12.99 → 13.0 (since 9 ≥5).

14.14 →14.1 (since 4 <5).

Adding these correctly: 18.0 +21.4=39.4; 39.4 +13.0=52.4; 52.4 +14.1=66.5.

So the total is 66.5 seconds, which is option A. But wait, why did the first approach give a different result? Because in the first approach, I added all the precise times without rounding each to the nearest tenth, which gave 65.56. But the question specifies that each time is rounded, so the correct total is 66.5.

Looking at the options, option A is 66.5, which would be the correct answer.

The correct approach is to round each time to the nearest tenth before adding. This results in a total of 66.5 seconds.
