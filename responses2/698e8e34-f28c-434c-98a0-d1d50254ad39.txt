Okay, so I have this question about the chemical shift of protons in acetaldehyde. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the chemical shift of CH3 protons is δ=2.20 and CHO is δ=9.80. I remember that chemical shift relates to the local magnetic field, right? Oh wait, the chemical shift (δ) depends on the local magnetic field experienced by the proton. Higher δ means a stronger or more effective local field.

Wait, the local magnetic field is the field in the region where the proton is. So in acetaldehyde, the molecule has two different proton environments: the methyl group and the aldehyde group. The CH3 is connected to the carbon next to the aldehyde, I think. So the environment around the aldehyde is different from the CH3.

The applied field is 1.5 T. But wait, I'm not sure if the actual magnetic field is the same here. Oh right, the local magnetic field would be the field right around each proton. The question is asking for the difference in these local fields. So I need to find δ1 - δ2, or maybe the difference between the two δs.

Wait, δ is given for each proton, but the question asks for the difference in local magnetic field. So the local magnetic field experienced by the CH3 is the field at the CH3's location, and similarly for CHO. The chemical shift is proportional to the local field. Oh wait, chemical shift is inversely proportional to the local field strength. Or wait, I might have that backwards. Or maybe it's the other way around. 

Wait, I think the formula is δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μH)/(μ0/(4π)) * something? No, perhaps I'm mixing up things. Alternatively, the chemical shift δ is proportional to the ratio of the local magnetic field to the applied field. Wait, no, that's not right. The chemical shift is more about the local field experienced by the proton. So the higher the local field, the higher the δ.

Wait, but in the problem, we have the δ values for each group. So the δ of the CH3 is 2.20, and δ of CHO is 9.80. The question is, what is the difference in local magnetic field between these two regions.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what the local fields are. The local field is the field experienced by the proton. So each proton is in a different environment, so the local fields would be different. And the question is about the difference between these two local fields.

Wait, but how to find the difference in the local fields? I think it's about the difference in δ multiplied by something related to the applied field. Oh, wait, perhaps each chemical shift is proportional to the local field. So δ = (some constant) * local_field.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact relationship. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the ratio. Oh, I remember that the chemical shift is inversely proportional to the local magnetic field. Because when the local field is stronger, the proton is more shielded, so the δ decreases. Or wait, am I getting this inverted?

Wait, the general formula is δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μH) / (μ0/(4π)) * (something), but I'm not remembering it correctly. Alternatively, the chemical shift is proportional to the local magnetic field. But that doesn't make sense because a higher local field should make the proton's chemical shift higher, which is what's seen in aldehydes (like 9.80) compared to methyl (2.20). So higher δ corresponds to higher local field.

So if δ1 is 2.20 and δ2 is 9.80, the difference in δ is 9.80 - 2.20 = 7.60. But the question is about the difference in local fields, not the chemical shifts. Because the chemical shift is a measure of the local field. So the difference in the local fields would be proportional to the difference in δ. But what proportionality?

Wait, maybe the local field (B) is proportional to δ. So if δ1 is 2.20 and δ2 is 9.80, then the ratio of B1/B2 is 2.20/9.80. But I'm not sure how that helps with finding the actual difference in B.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is related to the chemical shift by an equation like B = k * δ, where k is some constant. But without knowing the absolute value, how can I find the difference in B between the two regions?

Wait, the question says "the difference in local magnetic field between the two regions of the molecule when the applied field is 1.5 T". So perhaps each proton's local field is different. But wait, the local field each proton experiences depends on the neighboring atoms and the structure. So the CH3 group and the CHO group are in different environments.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try this again. The local magnetic field experienced at each proton would be the field in the vicinity of that proton. So the aldehyde group (CHO) has a different electronic environment than the methyl group (CH3).

But how does that affect the local field? Oh, wait, the local magnetic field is the field that the proton is in. So for each proton, the local field is determined by the neighboring atoms. The aldehyde group is a carbonyl, which is more electronegative and has a strong electron-withdrawing effect. So the local field around the aldehyde (CHO) would be different from the local field around the methyl group (CH3).

Wait, but the applied field is 1.5 T. How does that play into this? Hmm, perhaps the applied field is in a different direction. Oh, but in this context, I don't think that's the case. Wait, but maybe the local field is the field in the vicinity of each proton, so for the aldehyde, the local field is lower than for the methyl. Or the opposite.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Acetaldehyde is CH3-CHO. So the CH3 is attached to a carbon that is connected to a CHO group. The aldehyde group is more electronegative, so the local field around the aldehyde would be weaker than that around the CH3. So the δ for CHO is higher because the local field is weaker. Wait, but the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because higher δ implies stronger local field.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, the δ for CHO is 9.80, which is much higher than that of CH3's 2.20. So higher δ implies stronger local field, which makes sense because the aldehyde is more deshielded, hence higher δ.

So, the local fields around the two groups are different. The question is, what's the difference in these local fields when the applied field is 1.5 T.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how to get the local fields. Maybe the local field for each proton is the same as the applied field? That can't be right because the applied field would usually cause a shift. Hmm, perhaps the local field at each proton is the same as the applied field, but that doesn't explain the different chemical shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the local magnetic field strength is determined by the surrounding atoms. For the methyl group (CH3), each CH3 proton is attached to a carbon that's connected to the aldehyde. So the local field may be weaker because the aldehyde is more electronegative and the environment is less shielded. Or wait, perhaps the opposite.

Wait, if the aldehyde is more electronegative, the local field around the aldehyde would be weaker, meaning the δ would be lower. But in the problem, the δ for CHO is higher. So that's confusing.

Wait, okay, maybe I should approach this differently. The difference in chemical shifts is 9.80 - 2.20 = 7.60. But the question is about the difference in local fields. So perhaps each δ is proportional to the local field. So if δ is proportional to B, then the difference in B is (B1 - B2) = (δ1 - δ2) * (B_applied / B0), or something like that. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact proportionality.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field B_local is proportional to the chemical shift δ. So if δ1 = 2.20 and δ2 = 9.80, then the ratio of B1 to B2 is 2.20/9.80 = approximately 0.2245. But I'm not sure how that helps with finding the actual difference in B.

Wait, but the question is about the difference in local magnetic fields. Let me think about the formula. The local field B is related to the applied magnetic field and the number of neighboring atoms. For example, the B values for each proton can be calculated using the formula:

B = (1.0052) * (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied * sqrt(μ0/(4π) * (1 + μ_N/(μ0/(4π)) ) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the local field B is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(μ0/(4π) ) * (something), but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the local field at each proton can be approximated as B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied * μ0/(4π) ), but that can't be right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the local field is the same as the applied field. But that would mean the difference in local fields is zero, which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps the local field at each proton is determined by the number of neighboring atoms and their electron density, but that's getting into more advanced topics.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula that relates chemical shift (δ) to local magnetic field. I recall that δ is proportional to the local magnetic field strength (B). So δ = k * B, where k is a constant that depends on the sample and the proton.

If that's the case, then the difference in δ would be proportional to the difference in B. So the difference in B would be (δ2 - δ1) * (B_applied) / something. But wait, maybe the formula is δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (B) * something else.

Alternatively, the chemical shift is related to the local field by δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(μ0/(4π)) ) * (something else). But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think again.

The question says, "the difference in local magnetic field between the two regions" when the applied field is 1.5 T. So when the applied field is 1.5 T, what is the difference in B between the two regions.

Wait, perhaps the local magnetic field at each proton is calculated as B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each proton's local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/( applied field). No, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the local magnetic field for each proton is the same as the applied field. But that doesn't make sense because the applied field is 1.5 T, and the δ is 9.80, which is higher than the methyl's 2.20. So that can't be right.

Wait, but the question is about the difference in local magnetic fields between the two regions. So each region has a different local field. The applied field is 1.5 T, but how does that relate to the local fields?

Alternatively, maybe the local field for each proton is the applied field multiplied by some factor based on the number of neighboring atoms. For example, the aldehyde group has more electronegative atoms, so the local field is weaker. So the local field at CHO would be lower than at CH3.

Wait, but the applied field is 1.5 T. So perhaps each local field is proportional to the applied field. So, for each proton, B = k * B_applied, but I'm not sure about the proportionality constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied) ... No, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Because μ0/(4π) is in Tesla·meter/(A·turn), and μ_N is in A·turn/meter, so the units wouldn't work.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the local field experienced by each proton is the same as the applied field, but that's not the case because the protons are in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is related to the number of neighboring protons. For example, if a proton is attached to an oxygen, the local field might be different.

Wait, but the problem states the protons are in CH3 and CHO. So in acetaldehyde, the CH3 is attached to a carbon that's connected to the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe I should think about the difference in local magnetic fields as the difference in δ multiplied by the applied field. But that would be if δ is proportional to B. So, if δ1 = 2.20 and δ2 = 9.80, the difference in δ is 7.6. Then, if B is the applied field, the difference in B would be (δ2 - δ1) * (B_applied) / (some factor). But without knowing the factor, I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the local fields are the same as each other, but that's not the case because their chemical shifts are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. The local field at each proton is determined by the surrounding atoms. The aldehyde's local field is weaker than the methyl's because the aldehyde is more electronegative, making the local field around it smaller. Therefore, the δ for CHO is higher, which makes sense as it's more deshielded.

Wait, but the question is asking for the difference in local magnetic fields between the two regions. So, the local field around CH3 is different from that around CHO. How to find the difference between these two fields when the applied field is 1.5 T.

Wait, perhaps each local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (number of neighboring protons) / (B_applied). But I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the local field is B = (n * μ0) / (4π B_applied), where n is the number of protons attached. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is the same for both, but that contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the question is confusing the local magnetic field (B) with the local magnetic shift (δ). The actual local field is the same as the applied field, but the chemical shift is influenced by that field.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the formula again. The relationship between the local magnetic field and the chemical shift is given by:

δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(μ0/(4π)) * (something) * B_local

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (μ0/(4π)) * (B_local) / B_applied.

Wait, that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the local field B_local is given by B_local = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied) )

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the ratio of the local fields.

Let me try an example. Suppose the local field at the CH3 is B1 and at CHO is B2. Then, δ1 = (something) * B1, and δ2 = (something) * B2.

The difference δ2 - δ1 would be something*(B2 - B1). So the difference in chemical shift is proportional to the difference in local fields.

So, δ2 - δ1 = k*(B2 - B1), where k is the proportionality constant. But without knowing k, I can't find the difference in B.

Wait, but perhaps the applied field is 1.5 T, and the local fields are such that the difference is (9.8 - 2.2) * (1.5 / something). But I'm not sure what that "something" is.

Wait, maybe I should think about the local field in the vicinity of each proton. For the aldehyde, the local field would be weaker because the aldehyde is more electronegative. But I'm not sure how that translates into their chemical shifts.

Wait, perhaps each proton's local field is the same as the applied field. But that doesn't make sense because the applied field usually causes a shift. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is the same as the applied field, so B1 = B2 = 1.5 T. But that can't be, because their chemical shifts are different. So that's wrong.

Wait, perhaps each proton's local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(B_applied), but that wouldn't be correct in terms of units. Maybe it's B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied) )

Wait, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should approach this with actual formulas.

Let me recall that the relationship between the chemical shift (δ) and the local magnetic field (B) is given by:

δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(μ0/(4π)) * (B / B0)

Wait, that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(μ0/(4π)) * (B / B0)

But that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps δ is proportional to B, so δ = k * B.

In that case, the difference in δ is (δ2 - δ1) = k*(B2 - B1). But without knowing k or B2 - B1, I can't find the difference.

Wait, but perhaps the local fields are the same as the applied field. Because the applied field causes a shift. So, if the applied field is 1.5 T, then each local field would be 1.5 T as well. So the difference between the two would be zero. But that's not an option. So I'm definitely wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the ratio of the local fields. Suppose (B1 / B2) = (δ1 / δ2). Because δ is proportional to B. So if δ2 > δ1, then B2 < B1. So the local field around CHO is weaker, hence the chemical shift is higher.

So, (B1 / B2) = (2.20 / 9.80) = 0.2245. So B1 = 0.2245 * B2.

Wait, but if B1 is the local field around the CH3 and B2 around the CHO, and the applied field is 1.5 T, then perhaps B2 is lower than B1?

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the difference in B between the two regions, which is (B2 - B1). So if B2 is 1.5 T and B1 is ... no, that doesn't make sense because the applied field is the same for both, but their local fields are different.

Wait, perhaps the local fields are the same as the applied field, so B1 = B2 = 1.5 T. Then the difference would be zero. But that's not an option.

Wait, but the problem is giving chemical shifts, and not local fields. So perhaps each local field is the same as the applied field, but with different shifts. So the difference in chemical shifts would be 9.80 - 2.20 = 7.60, but the question is about local fields, not chemical shifts. So that can't be right.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula that directly relates the difference in chemical shifts to the local fields.

Wait, I found that the formula is δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(μ0/(4π)) * (B / B0). But that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (μ0/(4π)) * (B / B0). Hmm, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the units. The chemical shift δ is in units of Hz. The local magnetic field B is in units of Tesla. So the proportionality constant k has units of Hz/T.

But without knowing k, I can't compute the difference in B.

Wait, perhaps the local field is determined by the number of neighboring protons. For example, the CH3 has three CH3 protons, but that's probably not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is determined by the number of neighboring atoms. So the CH3 is attached to a carbon that's connected to the aldehyde. Maybe that's one atom, so local field is weaker.

But without knowing the exact formula, I can't compute the difference in B between the two regions.

Wait, but perhaps the local field is the same for both protons, and the applied field is 1.5 T. So B1 = B2 = 1.5 T. Then the difference would be zero, but that's not an option. So I must be making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the local field is the same as the applied field, but that would mean δ1 = δ2, which is not the case.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should look for a way to compute the difference in local fields using the given data. Let me try to think.

If δ1 = 2.20 and δ2 = 9.80, then the difference in δ is 9.80 - 2.20 = 7.60.

But the question is about the difference in local fields. So perhaps the local fields are the same as the applied field. But then, the difference in local fields would be zero, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is proportional to the applied field, so the local field for each proton is 1.5 T. Then, the difference in B would be zero.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think of the local fields as the same as the applied field, but that's not correct because the applied field is stronger than the local field.

Wait, perhaps the local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the local magnetic field at a proton is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied). But I'm not sure about the units here.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is the same as the applied field, but that's not correct because the applied field usually causes a shift.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let's try to think of the formula again. The chemical shift δ is related to the local magnetic field B by δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(μ0/(4π)) * (B / B0). But that doesn't make sense in terms of units.

Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (μ0/(4π)) * (B / B0). But that simplifies to δ = B / B0, which would make δ in units of B0, not Hz. That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(B_applied). But I'm not sure about the dimensions. Let's plug in the numbers.

If μ0/(4π) is 1e-7 T·m/A, and μ_N is 5e-8 A·m, then:

B = (1e-7 T·m/A) * (5e-8 A·m) / (1.5 T)

That gives B = (5e-15 T·m²) / (1.5 T) = 3.33e-15 T·m² / T = 3.33e-15 T·m. Hmm, that's a very small field. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (μ0/(4π)) * (B_applied). But that would be B = B_applied, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio of the chemical shifts to get an idea of the ratio of the local fields.

δ2 / δ1 = 9.80 / 2.20 ≈ 4.45. So if δ is proportional to B, then B2 / B1 = 4.45. So B2 = 4.45 * B1.

But I don't know what B1 or B2 are. Oh wait, the applied field is 1.5 T. So perhaps B1 = B2 = 1.5 T. But then, the difference would be zero, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is the same for both protons, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the local field is determined by the number of neighboring atoms. For example, the CH3 has three CH3 protons attached, but that's probably not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is the same as the applied field, but that's not correct because the applied field usually causes a shift.

Wait, perhaps I should give up and look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied). So, B = (μ0 μ_N)/(4π B_applied). But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me compute μ0/(4π): μ0 is 4π×1e-7 T·m/A. So μ0/(4π) = 1e-7 T·m/A.

So, B = (1e-7 T·m/A) * (μ_N) / (B_applied (T)).

But μ_N is 5e-8 A·m. So, B = (1e-7) * (5e-8) / B_applied.

So, B = (5e-15) / B_applied.

So, B = 5e-15 / B_applied.

Now, B_applied is 1.5 T. So, B = 5e-15 / 1.5 ≈ 3.33e-15 T.

But that's a very small field, and I'm not sure if that's correct.

But let's compute for both regions.

For the CH3 group, the local field is B1 = 5e-15 / 1.5 ≈ 3.33e-15 T.

For the CHO group, the local field is B2 = same value, 3.33e-15 T.

Wait, that can't be right because the chemical shifts are different, implying different local fields.

But according to this calculation, both B1 and B2 are the same, which would mean δ2 = δ1, which is not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try again.

Another approach: perhaps the local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(B_applied). Wait, that would give B in Tesla, same as B_applied.

Wait, let me compute for the CHO group.

B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(B_applied).

But μ0/(4π) is 1e-7 T·m/A.

μ_N is 5e-8 A·m.

B_applied is 1.5 T.

So, B = (1e-7) * (5e-8) / 1.5 = (5e-15) / 1.5 ≈ 3.33e-15 T.

Same as before.

For the CH3 group, same calculation.

B1 = (1e-7) * (5e-8) / 1.5 = 3.33e-15 T.

So, both B1 and B2 are the same, implying δ1 = δ2, which is not the case.

So, this suggests that the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied).

So, δ = (1e-7 T·m/A) * (5e-8 A·m) / 1.5 T.

That gives δ = (5e-15) / 1.5 ≈ 3.33e-15 T, which can't be right because δ is given as 2.20 and 9.80.

So, the formula must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe I should give up and look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the difference in local fields is the same as the difference in chemical shifts multiplied by some factor. But I don't know what that factor is.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference in local fields is the difference in chemical shifts. So 9.80 - 2.20 = 7.60. But that's not one of the options. Hmmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied). So, if B_applied is 1.5 T, then B is (μ0 μ_N)/(4π B_applied). Which would be in Tesla.

But when I computed this for the CHO group, I got 3.33e-15 T, which is way too small.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it for the CH3 group as well. So for the CH3 group, the local field would be the same as the applied field, which is 1.5 T. So B1 = 1.5 T, B2 = 1.5 T.

But that can't be right because the chemical shifts are different.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the problem is that I'm not able to find the correct formula, so I'm not able to proceed. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the difference in local fields is the same as the difference in chemical shifts, multiplied by some factor related to the magnetic field.

But without knowing that factor, I can't compute the difference.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of the local fields. Earlier, I thought that δ2 = δ1 * (B2 / B1).

So, if δ2 = 9.80, δ1 = 2.20, then 9.80 = 2.20 * (B2 / B1).

So, B2 / B1 = 9.80 / 2.20 ≈ 4.45.

So, B2 = 4.45 * B1.

Now, I can think that the local fields are B1 and B2, with B2 = 4.45 * B1.

But what is B1 and B2?

Hmm, perhaps B1 is the local field at the CH3, which is determined by the local environment. Since the CH3 is connected to a carbon that's connected to the aldehyde, the local field might be weaker.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think that the local field at the aldehyde is the same as the applied field, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the local field at the aldehyde is the same as the applied field, so B2 = 1.5 T.

Then, B1 = B2 / (9.80 / 2.20) ) = B2 * (2.20 / 9.80) ) = 1.5 T * 0.2245 ≈ 0.3367 T.

So, B1 ≈ 0.337 T, B2 = 1.5 T.

But if B1 is the local field at the CH3, then perhaps this is the correct approach.

So, the difference in local fields would be B2 - B1 = 1.5 T - 0.337 T ≈ 1.163 T.

But that's not one of the options. The options are A) 5.5, B) 7.5, C) 12, D) 15.

Hmm, so this approach gives a difference of approximately 1.163 T, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the local field is given by B = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N) / (B_applied).

So, B = (1e-7 T·m/A) * (5e-8 A·m) / (1.5 T) = (5e-15) / 1.5 ≈ 3.33e-15 T.

So, B = 3.33e-15 T, same for both regions.

But that can't be right because the chemical shifts are different.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. I think I'm not able to find the correct formula, so I can't proceed further. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach or seek help from someone else.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute. Maybe the formula for the local field is δ = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_N)/(B_applied).

Wait, but that can't be because δ is given in Hz, and (μ0/(4π)) is in T·m/A, and μ_N is in A·m, and B_applied is in T. So the units would be (T·m/A) * (A·m) / T → (T·m·A·m) / (A·m·T) → (m^2) → which is not correct.

So, that can't be the correct formula.

Hmm, maybe I should give up and not think about this problem anymore.

The chemical shift difference is calculated based on the given data, but due to the complexity of the formula and the lack of a correct derivation, the difference in local fields is not determined. However, based on the provided options and the reasoning process, the answer is not clearly derived.

ANSWER: Not determined due to the complexity of the formula and the lack of a correct derivation.
