Okay, so I've got this question here about probabilities in a normal distribution. Hmm, let me think. The question says the probability is 0.2 that a value selected at random from a normal distribution with mean 600 and standard deviation 15 will be above a certain number. I need to find what that number is from the options given.

Alright, I remember that in a normal distribution, the mean is the center point, and the standard deviation tells me how spread out the data is. The standard normal distribution is when the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. So, to find the value that corresponds to a certain probability, I probably need to use the Z-score.

Wait, the probability is 0.2 that the value is above a certain number. So that means the probability that it's below that number is 0.8 (since 1 - 0.2 = 0.8). So I need to find the Z-score that corresponds to the 0.8 cumulative probability.

I think the Z-table gives the area under the curve from the left up to a certain Z-score. So looking up 0.8 in the Z-table would give me the Z-score. Let me think about the Z-table. For 0.8, the Z-score is about 0.84. Wait, because the Z-table for 0.8 is 0.84, right? Because when I look up 0.8, it's the value where 80% of the area is to the left.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So the Z-score for 0.8 is 0.84? No, wait. Because the Z-table gives the area to the left of the Z-score. So for 0.8, the Z is approximately 0.84. Because the 0.84 is the value where 84% of the data is below it. So that makes sense. So the Z is 0.84.

Now, using the Z-score formula: Z = (X - μ) / σ. Here, μ is 600 and σ is 15. So X is what we're solving for. Rearranging the formula: X = μ + Z * σ.

So plugging in the numbers: X = 600 + 0.84 * 15. Let me calculate that. 15 times 0.84 is 12.6. So 600 + 12.6 is 612.6. Let me check the options. Option H is 612.6. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to calculate the Z-score correctly. Let me double-check the Z-value. Oh wait, I think I was a little confused earlier. So I'm looking for the Z-score where the area to the left is 0.8. So yes, Z is 0.84 because the table for 0.8 (the first two digits) is 0.84, which corresponds to 0.84 probability. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, another thing: Did I get the direction right? The question says the value is above X, so the Z is positive. So yes, it's +0.84σ above the mean. So 600 + (0.84 * 15) is 612.6. So the correct answer is H.

To determine the value above which there is a 0.2 probability in a normal distribution with mean 600 and standard deviation 15, we use the Z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.

1. The probability of being above a value is 0.2, so the cumulative probability up to that value is 0.8.
2. The Z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.8 is approximately 0.84.
3. Using the Z-score formula: \( Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \), rearrange to find \( X = \mu + Z \cdot \sigma \).
4. Substitute the values: \( X = 600 + 0.84 \cdot 15 = 612.6 \).

The correct answer is **H: 612.6**.

Answer: H
