Question:

Before the close of evidence in a federal negligence trial, the defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction on contributory negligence. Before instructing the jury, the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, which did not include the defendant's contributory negligence instruction or any instruction on contributory negligence. Neither party objected, either then or after the judge had given the instructions. The jury after the judge had given the instructions. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the judge entered judgment on the verdict. The defendant would like to appeal the verdict on the ground that the judge should have instructed the jury on contributory negligence. Has the defendant preserved the issue for appeal?

Options:

A: Yes, because the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction.
B: Yes, because the defendant's proposed instruction was a valid point of appeal.
C: No, because the defendant did not raise the issue of contributory negligence during the trial.
D: Yes, because the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence.
E: No, because the defendant did not reiterate the need for the instruction after it was not included.
F: Yes, because the judge did not give an instruction on contributory negligence.
G: Yes, because the defendant's proposed instruction was ignored by the judge.
H: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the defendant has preserved the issue of whether the judge should have instructed the jury on contributory negligence. Let me break down the facts and see what's going on.

The scenario is a federal negligence trial. The defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction before the trial, and the judge informed them of the instructions she would give, which don't include the defendant's contributory negligence instruction. Neither party objected, so there was no immediate issue. The jury then returned a verdict, and the judge entered judgment based on that verdict.

Now, the defendant wants to appeal because they think the judge didn't give a proper instruction on contributory negligence. I need to determine if the court has preserved the issue for appeal.

In federal courts, when parties are involved in jury instructions, there are certain standards. One key point is whether the parties have submitted a notice of their objection to the judge. If they do, the judge must respond by giving an instruction on the issue. If not, the court doesn't have to rule on the issue.

In this case, the defendant submitted the proposed instruction, but neither party raised an objection. So the judge didn't have to give a notice of objection. The question is whether that's enough to preserve the issue for appeal.

I remember that in cases where neither party objects, the court doesn't need to rule on whether the instruction was given. If the parties didn't object, the instruction given doesn't automatically bar the court from appealing. The court just needs to determine whether the instruction was given and whether it was relevant.

But wait, if the instruction was given, does that mean it was given in a way that's relevant? The judge didn't give a specific instruction on contributory negligence. She gave a general instruction about jury instruction. So the issue was about whether the instruction was given.

So the question is whether the instruction was given. The defendant submitted it, so the judge did give it. But because neither party objected, the court didn't have to rule on whether that instruction was appropriate. The issue of contributory negligence wasn't raised, so the court can decide whether the instruction was given.

Since the instruction wasn't given, the issue wasn't raised, right? Or was it? Wait, if the instruction wasn't given, then the court didn't have to rule on whether the instruction was appropriate, so the issue of whether the instruction was given was already decided. So the issue for appeal would be whether the judge should have instructed on contributory negligence. Since the instruction wasn't given, the court's decision would have been based on the instruction given, not the issue at hand.

Wait, no. The issue was whether the judge should have instructed on contributory negligence. The fact that the instruction wasn't given doesn't automatically mean the issue was resolved. The instruction given might have been on a different issue, so the court can then address whether the instruction was appropriate.

Alternatively, if the instruction wasn't given, the issue wasn't raised, so the court wouldn't have to decide whether the instruction was given. Therefore, the issue of contributory negligence wasn't raised, so the court can decide whether the instruction should have been given.

Wait, but in this case, the judge did give an instruction on general jury instruction, not specifically on contributory negligence. The defendant's instruction was a proposal, but the judge didn't give their specific instruction. So the question is whether the instruction given was sufficient to address the issue of whether the instruction should have been given.

If a party submits a notice of objection, the judge must respond with an instruction. If the parties don't object, the instruction is given, but it doesn't bar further court proceedings unless the parties object.

So in this case, since neither party object, the instruction was given. But since the specific issue was about contributory negligence, and the instruction wasn't given, the court can decide whether the instruction was appropriate. Therefore, the issue wasn't raised in the first place, so the court can decide whether the instruction should have been given.

Wait, but the question is whether the judge should have instructed on contributory negligence. The instruction wasn't given, so the issue didn't come up. So when the court hears the instruction, it can proceed to determine whether the instruction was given and whether it was relevant. Therefore, the issue is already resolved, and the defendant didn't need to raise it.

Wait, no. If a party submits a notice of objection, the judge must respond with an instruction. If the parties don't object, the instruction is given, but it doesn't bar further court proceedings unless the parties object.

So in this case, since neither party object, the instruction was given. But since the specific issue was about contributory negligence, and the instruction wasn't given, the court can decide whether the instruction was appropriate. Therefore, the issue wasn't raised in the first place, so the court can decide whether the instruction should have been given.

Wait, but the issue is whether the judge should have instructed on contributory negligence. The instruction wasn't given, so the issue wasn't raised, so the court doesn't have to decide whether the instruction was givenâ€”so the issue for appeal is already addressed. Therefore, the defendant hasn't preserved the issue for appeal because the instruction wasn't given.

So, the correct answer would be option E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, option E says: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give. So, the defendant didn't object, so the judge didn't have to give a specific instruction on contributory negligence. So the issue wasn't raised, hence the court can decide whether the instruction should have been given.

Alternatively, if the judge had given the specific instruction, then the issue would be up for appeal. But since she didn't, the issue wasn't raised. So, the defendant hasn't raised the issue for appeal because the instruction wasn't given, so the issue was already resolved.

Wait, but the question is about whether the issue was raised. The instruction wasn't given, so the issue wasn't raised. So the answer would be whether the court ruled on whether the instruction was given.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, that's about whether the judge had the opportunity to give a specific instruction. If the judge had given the specific instruction, then the issue would be preserved. But in this case, the judge did not give the defendant's instruction, so the issue wasn't raised. So the answer would be that the issue wasn't raised, so the court can decide whether the instruction should have been given.

But the options are about whether the issue for appeal was preserved. So, since the instruction wasn't given, the court can proceed to decide whether it should have been given. So the issue wasn't raised, so the court does not need to decide on whether the instruction was given. Hence, the issue isn't preserved for appeal.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine:

The defendant submitted a proposed instruction, which the judge informed would be given. The parties didn't object. So the instruction was given. Now, the question is whether the instruction was given in a way that would preserve the issue for appeal.

But in federal courts, if neither party objects, the instruction given doesn't bar further proceedings unless the parties object. So the instruction was given, but if the court doesn't have to rule on whether the instruction was appropriate, then the issue wasn't raised.

Wait, but I'm trying to determine if the court preserved the issue for appeal. The issue was whether the judge should have instructed on contributory negligence. Since the instruction wasn't given, the issue wasn't raised, so the court doesn't have to decide on it. Therefore, the issue wasn't preserved for appeal because the instruction wasn't given.

Looking at the options:

Option E says: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, that's about whether the judge had the opportunity to give a specific instruction. If the defendant did object, then the judge would have had to give the specific instruction. But since the defendant didn't object, the instruction was given, but the issue wasn't raised.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the main points of the test.

In a federal court, if the parties do not object to a proposed jury instruction, the judge must respond by giving an instruction on the matter at issue. If they do object, the judge must respond by giving an instruction on the matter at issue. If neither party objects, the court does not have to rule on whether the instruction was given.

So, in this case, the defendant submitted a proposed instruction, and the judge told them she would give it. The parties didn't object, so the instruction was given. But since the issue was about contributory negligence, and the instruction wasn't given, the court doesn't have to decide on whether the instruction was appropriate. So the issue wasn't raised, so the defendant hasn't preserved it for appeal.

Wait, but the question is whether the issue for appeal was preserved. Since the instruction wasn't given, the court can't decide on whether the instruction was relevant. So the issue wasn't raised, so the court doesn't need to decide on whether the instruction was appropriate. Therefore, the issue wasn't preserved for appeal because the instruction was given, but the issue wasn't raised.

Wait, but the question is whether the defendant preserved the issue for appeal. The issue was about whether the instruction should have been given. Since the instruction wasn't given, the issue wasn't raised, so the court doesn't have to decide whether the instruction was appropriate. Therefore, the issue wasn't preserved for appeal because the instruction wasn't given. So the answer would be that the issue wasn't preserved, so the defendant didn't preserve it for appeal.

But looking at the options, the correct answer would be E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, but no. Option E says the defendant failed to object. If the defendant didn't object, then the judge didn't have to rule on the instruction. So the issue wasn't raised, so the court doesn't need to decide on whether the instruction was given. Thus, the issue wasn't preserved for appeal. Therefore, the answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of it as a test scenario.

In a court, if neither party objects, the instruction given doesn't affect whether the issue is raised. So if the instruction wasn't given, the issue wasn't raised. So the court can proceed to decide whether the instruction was given, but the issue wasn't raised. So the defendant didn't preserve the issue for appeal because the instruction wasn't given, so the issue wasn't raised.

Wait, but the options are whether the court has preserved the issue for appeal. Since the instruction wasn't given, the issue wasn't raised, so the court doesn't need to decide on the issue. So the issue wasn't preserved for appeal because the instruction wasn't given.

Wait, but the options are about whether the issue was preserved. The answer would be E, because the defendant failed to object after the judge told them she would give the instructions. But if the judge didn't give the specific instruction, then the issue wasn't raised.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. The key point is whether the instruction was given. If neither party objects, the instruction is given, but it doesn't bar further proceedings unless the parties object again. So the issue wasn't raised because the parties didn't object.

Therefore, the issue isn't preserved for appeal because the instruction wasn't given. So the correct answer is E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, no. If the defendant didn't object, then the judge didn't have to give a specific instruction, so the issue wasn't raised. So the issue wasn't preserved for appeal because the instruction wasn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: No, because the defendant failed to object. But that's about whether the judge had the opportunity to give a specific instruction. If the defendant had given an objection, then the judge would have had to give the instruction. But since the defendant didn't, the issue wasn't raised.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the answer that says the issue wasn't preserved because the instruction wasn't given. Looking back at the options:

Option E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, but if the defendant didn't object, the judge didn't have to give the specific instruction, so the issue wasn't raised. So the answer is that the issue wasn't preserved because the instruction wasn't given.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try a different approach. The elements of preserving the issue for appeal are:

1. The issue wasn't raised at all.
2. The court must decide on whether the instruction was given.
3. The issue was raised in court.

In this case, the judge did give the instruction. The issue was about contributory negligence. The court doesn't have to rule on the instruction unless the parties object. Since the parties didn't object, the instruction was given, but the issue wasn't raised. Therefore, the issue wasn't preserved for appeal because the instruction wasn't given.

So, which option reflects that? Looking at the options:

Option E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, but that's about whether the judge had the opportunity to give a specific instruction. If the defendant had raised an objection, the judge would have had to give the instruction. But since the defendant didn't object, the instruction wasn't given, but the issue wasn't raised.

So, the correct answer is E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge told the parties the instructions she would give. But that's about whether the judge had the opportunity to give the instruction. However, the issue wasn't raised because the instruction wasn't given.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge told the parties the instructions she would give.

Wait, no. The issue is about whether the instruction was given. If the defendant had raised an objection, the judge would have had to give the instruction. But the defendant didn't object, so the instruction wasn't given, but the issue wasn't raised.

So, the court doesn't have to decide on the issue because the instruction wasn't given. Therefore, the issue wasn't preserved for appeal because the instruction wasn't given.

So, the answer would be E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, no. The problem is that the judge didn't give the specific instruction, so the issue wasn't raised. So the answer is that the issue wasn't preserved because the instruction wasn't given.

Thus, the correct answer is E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give. Because the defendant didn't object, the instruction wasn't given, so the issue wasn't raised.

Wait, but if the court had heard the instruction, it could have decided whether the instruction was appropriate. So the issue wasn't preserved because the court doesn't have to decide on the instruction.

But the options are about whether the issue was preserved for appeal. So, since the instruction wasn't given, the issue wasn't raised, so the judge doesn't have to decide on it.

So, the answer is E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge told the parties the instructions she would give.

Wait, but the answer is E, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: No, because the defendant failed to object.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of this another way. The question is whether the court preserved the issue for appeal. The issue is whether the judge should have instructed on contributory negligence.

Since the judge didn't give that instruction, the issue wasn't raised. Therefore, the court doesn't need to decide on whether the instruction was given because the issue wasn't raised. So, the court didn't have to decide on the issue for appeal, hence the issue wasn't preserved.

But the options are:

A: Yes, because the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction.

B: Yes, because the defendant's proposed instruction was a valid point of appeal.

C: No, because the defendant did not raise the issue of contributory negligence during the trial.

D: Yes, because the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence.

E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, option C says "No, because the defendant did not raise the issue of contributory negligence during the trial." That's correct. The defendant did raise the issue by submitting the instruction, but the judge didn't give the specific instruction. So the issue wasn't raised, so the court doesn't have to decide on it. Therefore, the court hasn't preserved the issue for appeal because the instruction wasn't given.

So, the correct answer is E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give. Wait, option E says the defendant failed to object. If the defendant didn't object, then the judge didn't have to give the specific instruction. So the issue wasn't raised.

But the issue is about whether the instruction was given, not whether the issue was raised. So the answer is E because the defendant didn't object, so the instruction wasn't given, but the issue wasn't raised.

Alternatively, I think the court didn't have to decide on whether the instruction was given because the instruction wasn't given. Therefore, the issue wasn't preserved because the instruction wasn't given.

So, the correct answer is E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, no. Wait, the issue is about whether the instruction was given, not about whether the issue was raised. So, the issue wasn't raised because the judge didn't give the specific instruction.

So, the answer would be E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge told the parties the instructions she would give.

Because if the defendant had raised an objection, the judge would have had to give the instruction. But since the defendant didn't object, the instruction wasn't given, so the issue wasn't raised.

So the correct answer is E: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Wait, but option E is about the defendant not objecting, which is correct. So the answer is E.
</think>

The defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction, but the judge did not give a specific instruction on contributory negligence. Since neither party raised an objection, the court did not have to rule on whether the instruction was appropriate. Therefore, the issue of whether the instruction should have been given was not preserved for appeal.

ANSWER: E
