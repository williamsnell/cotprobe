Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an elevator. Hmm, let me think through it. Alright, the question says the elevator is accelerated upward at 2 ft/sec². The weight of the elevator is 500 lb, and I need to find the tension in the supporting cable.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that when an elevator accelerates, the tension changes because the net force has to account for both the weight and the acceleration. Oh right, Newton's second law, F = ma. But wait, what's the direction of the forces here?

The elevator is accelerating upwards. So the forces acting on it are the tension in the cable pulling up and the weight pulling down. Since it's moving upward, the net force is T - W = ma. Oh wait, I think I should get the signs right. If the elevator is moving upward, and the acceleration is upward, then the net force would be T (up) minus W (down) equals ma. Wait, but what's the sign convention? If I take upwards as positive, then T would be positive, W is positive as well. So the equation becomes T - W = ma.

Wait, but I need to get the units right. Oh, wait, the weight is given in pounds. I remember that weight is a force, and in the formula, mass is in slugs. Because force equals mass times acceleration, and since weight is mass times gravity (W = mg), so mass would be W/g. But wait, sometimes when dealing with acceleration in terms of g, the equation might get a bit confusing.

Wait, let me clarify. The elevator's weight is 500 lb. So the force due to gravity (W) is 500 lb. The acceleration a is 2 ft/s² upward. So the net force is T - W = m*a. But m is the mass, which is W/g. So substituting, T - W = (W/g) * a. Oh, wait, but I'm not sure if g is in ft/s². Because normally, g is around 32 ft/s². So perhaps I should include that.

Wait, maybe it's better to convert the weight into mass units. Alternatively, since the acceleration is given in ft/s², perhaps I should express things in pounds-force and use the formula directly. I'm a bit confused about the approach here.

Alternatively, another way to think: the elevator's weight is 500 lb. So the force due to gravity is 500 lb. When it's accelerating upward, the tension must be more than the weight. So the tension T is greater than 500 lb.

Wait, the acceleration is 2 ft/s² upward. So the net force is ma. Let's compute the mass in terms of lb. Wait, lb is a unit of weight, not mass. So mass (m) is weight (W) divided by g. So m = W / g = 500 lb / 32 ft/s². But wait, when using Newton's second law, the units need to be consistent. 

Hmm, I might be complicating things. Let's approach it from the perspective of forces. The net force upward is T - W = m*a. But m is W / g. So substituting, T - W = (W/g) * a. Wait, that can't be right, because if a is positive, then T would be W*(1 + a/g). Does that make sense?

Wait, let me do the math. Let's plug in the numbers. W is 500 lb, a is 2 ft/s². So,

T = W + (m * a)
m = W / g = 500 lb / 32 ft/s².

Wait, but when using lb as a unit, the units of mass and acceleration would have to be compatible. Because sometimes, in the English system, lb is a unit of force, not mass. So perhaps it's better to convert to lb-force and then compute using the formula T = m*(g + a), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for tension in the cable when an elevator is accelerating upward is T = W + (m * a). But m is W/g, so substituting:

T = W + (W/g) * a = W (1 + a/g).

Wait, but then substituting the values, W is 500 lb, a is 2 ft/s², g is 32 ft/s².

So a/g is 2/32 = 0.0625. So 1 + 0.0625 = 1.0625. So T = 500 * 1.0625 = 531.25 lb. That's one of the options, option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh! I think I made a mistake here. Because when you have a force in the upward direction, the net force is T - W = m*a. But if a is upward, then the equation is T - W = m*a. Let me see.

Alternatively, I remember that in some cases, when dealing with acceleration, the tension is calculated as T = m(g + a). But wait, since m = W/g, substituting gives T = (W/g)(g + a) = W (1 + a/g). Which is the same as before. So that gives T = 500 * (1 + 2/32) = 500 * 1.0625 = 531.25 lb. So that's 531.2 lb, option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: the net force is T - W = m a. But m is W / g. So,

T = W + m a = W + (W/g) a.

Which is W (1 + a/g) = 500*(1 +2/32)=500*(1.0625)=531.25 lb. So this approach also gives the same answer.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of standard units. Because sometimes, when using pounds as a unit, the calculations get a bit tricky. Wait, but the problem gives the weight as 500 lb, which is force. So I should think in terms of lb-force.

Wait, another approach: Newton's second law in terms of mass and acceleration. But since the weight is given as 500 lb, which is a force, the mass can be found as m = W/(g), but using the correct units.

Wait, since W is in pounds-force, and g is in ft/s², then m would be in slugs. Wait, but maybe we don't need to convert it. Let me think. Since F = ma, and a is 2 ft/s², and F is the net force, which is T - W = m*a. But m is W/g (in slugs), which when multiplied by a (ft/s²) gives lb-force.

Wait, perhaps it's better to treat everything in lb and adjust the acceleration due to gravity. Since the acceleration is 2 ft/s², and g is approx 32 ft/s², the effective acceleration in terms of force is g + a, which is 34 ft/s²? No, wait, I think that's not accurate. Because when you have an elevator acceleration upward, the effective acceleration for the force is g + a, but only if a is much smaller than g, which it is here (2 vs 32). So the tension T is W*(g + a)/g. Or wait, perhaps the formula is T = W (1 + a/g). Because when a is positive upward, the effective gravity is g + a, so T = W * (g + a)/g = W*(1 + a/g). Which is what I had earlier.

So 500*(1 + 2/32) = 531.25 lb, which is option B.

So the correct answer should be option B: 531.2 lb.

To determine the tension in the supporting cable of an elevator accelerating upward at \( 2 \, \text{ft/sec}^2 \) while weighing \( 500 \, \text{lb} \), we analyze the forces acting on the elevator. The elevator is accelerating upward, so the net force is given by Newton's second law, \( F = ma \). The forces acting on the elevator are the tension \( T \) in the cable (upward) and the weight \( W = 500 \, \text{lb} \) (downward). Since the elevator is accelerating upward, the net force is \( T - W = ma \).

The mass \( m \) of the elevator can be expressed as \( m = \frac{W}{g} \), where \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/sec}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Substituting \( m = \frac{W}{g} \) into the net force equation:

\[
T - W = \frac{W}{g} \cdot a
\]

Rearranging for \( T \):

\[
T = W + \frac{W}{g} \cdot a
\]

Substituting the given values \( W = 500 \, \text{lb} \), \( a = 2 \, \text{ft/sec}^2 \), and \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/sec}^2 \):

\[
T = 500 + \frac{500}{32} \cdot 2
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{500}{32} \cdot 2 \):

\[
\frac{500}{32} \cdot 2 = \frac{500}{16} = 31.25
\]

Then, add this to \( W \):

\[
T = 500 + 31.25 = 531.25 \, \text{lb}
\]

Thus, the tension in the supporting cable is \( 531.2 \, \text{lb} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:
