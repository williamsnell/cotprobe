Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The problem says there's a sample with one million radioactive nuclei. The half-life is 20 seconds, and we need to find out how many remain after 10 seconds. Hmm, right, the half-life is the time it takes for half the nuclei to decay. So each half-life, the number of nuclei halves.

Wait, but the time here is 10 seconds, which is less than the half-life of 20 seconds. So after one half-life, it'll go from 1,000,000 to 500,000. But since 10 is half of 20, I guess it's going to go through a fraction of the half-life.

Oh right, the formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where N0 is the initial number, t is time, and T is the half-life. 

So plugging in the numbers: t is 10 seconds. Half-life is 20, so t/T is 10/20 = 0.5. So (1/2)^0.5 is the same as sqrt(1/2), which is about 0.7071. 

So N(t) = 1,000,000 * 0.7071. Let me calculate that. 1,000,000 * 0.7 is 700,000. 1,000,000 * 0.0071 is 7,100. So adding together, 707,100 approximately.

Looking at the options, option G is 707,000. That's the closest. So the answer should be G.

The problem involves determining the number of radioactive nuclei remaining after a given time. Using the formula \( N(t) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{T}} \), where \( N_0 = 1,000,000 \), \( t = 10 \) seconds, and \( T = 20 \) seconds, we find that \( \frac{t}{T} = 0.5 \). Thus, \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{0.5} \approx 0.7071 \), leading to \( N(t) \approx 707,100 \). The closest option is G: 707,000 nuclei.

Answer: G
