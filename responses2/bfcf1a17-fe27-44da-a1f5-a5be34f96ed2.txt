Okay, so I've got this question here about the circumference of a dime. Hmm, I remember that the formula for circumference is related to the radius or diameter. Oh wait, right! The formula is C = 2πr, where r is the radius. But wait, sometimes people use the diameter, so another formula is C = πd. Either way, they're the same because diameter is twice the radius.

The problem says the dime has a radius of about 0.85 cm. So I'll need to use the circumference formula with the radius. Let's plug in the numbers. So, radius r = 0.85 cm. 

Using C = 2πr, that would be 2 times pi times 0.85 cm. Let me calculate that. Pi is approximately 3.1416. So 2 * 3.1416 is about 6.2832. Then multiply that by 0.85. Let me do that step by step.

First, 6.2832 * 0.85. Let me compute that. 6 * 0.85 is 5.1, 0.2832 * 0.85 is approximately 0.2408. Adding them together gives about 5.1 + 0.2408 = 5.3408 cm. So approximately 5.34 cm.

Looking at the options, option I is 5.34 cm. So that's the closest. Wait, let me double-check my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me do it again more carefully.

C = 2 * π * r. So r is 0.85. 2 * 0.85 is 1.7. Then 1.7 * π. π is about 3.1416, so 1.7 * 3.1416. Let's calculate that.

3 * 1.7 is 5.1. 0.1416 * 1.7: 0.1416 * 1 = 0.1416, 0.1416 * 0.7 = 0.09912. So 0.1416 + 0.09912 = 0.24072. Add that to 5.1: 5.1 + 0.24072 = 5.34072 cm. Approximately 5.34 cm.

Looking at the options, option I is 5.34 cm. So that's the correct answer.

The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula \( C = 2\pi r \), where \( r \) is the radius. For a dime with a radius of 0.85 cm:

1. **Calculate the circumference:**
   - \( C = 2 \times \pi \times 0.85 \)
   - \( C \approx 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.85 \)
   - \( C \approx 5.34 \) cm.

2. **Match the result to the options:**
   - Option I: 5.34 cm.

**Answer:** I
