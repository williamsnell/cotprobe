Question:

Define Piaget's preoperational stage of cognitive development. Name and describe its twosubstages. The Conceptual Period of Intelligence Stage 1. Preoperational (2 - 7 yrs.) a.Preconceptual (18 mos. - 4 yrs.) First such use of representational thought and symbols, such as words, for objects; classification of objects. b. Intuitive thought (4 - 7 yrs.) Beginning of reasoning, but thinking is fragmented, centered on parts of things, rigid, and based wholly on appearances. 2. Concrete operations (7 - 11 yrs.) Can perform mental operations and reverse them. Can add up "all the marbles." Operations are however confined to concrete and tangible objects that are immediately present. 3. Formal operations (12 - 15 yrs.) Can form hypotheses, can go beyond operations appearances to deal with the truth or falsity of propositions.

Options:

A: The preoperational stage includes the intuitive thought substage from ages 2 to 4 and the formal operations substage from ages 4 to 7.
B: The preoperational stage consists of a single phase of development that spans from ages 2 to 7, without distinct substages.
C: The preoperational stage includes the preconceptual substage from ages 7 to 11 and the intuitive thought substage from ages 11 to 15.
D: The preoperational stage is characterized by abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning from ages 4 to 7.
E: The preoperational stage is from birth to 2 years.
F: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The preconceptual which lasts from ages 2 to 4 and the intuitive thought which extends from ages 4 to 7.
G: The preoperational stage consists of three substages: The preconceptual, concrete operations, and formal operations.
H: The preoperational stage involves logical thinking and reasoning.
I: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The sensorimotor stage which lasts from birth to age 2, and the concrete operational stage which begins at age 2.
J: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The symbolic function substage from ages 2 to 4 and the operational thought substage from ages 4 to 7.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Piaget's preoperational stage. I'm a bit new to this concept, but I'll try to break it down step by step. 

First, I remember that Piaget's stages are different periods during a child's cognitive development. The preoperational stage is the second one, which comes after the sensorimotor stage. The stages are divided into three main phases: sensorimotor, preoperational, and formal operational. But wait, the question specifically asks about the preoperational stage and its two substages, which are the conceptual and operational phases.

The preoperational stage is from ages 2 to 7. I think it's characterized by the use of concrete, logical thinking, but with a lot of perceptual and motor activities. So, the key here is that the child starts to think more abstractly and use language and symbols. 

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly describes the preoperational stage's substages. The options are A through J, each giving a different description.

Option F says: "The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The preconceptual which lasts from ages 2 to 4 and the intuitive thought which extends from ages 4 to 7." Wait, I thought the preconceptual stage is from 2 to 4, but then the intuitive thought starts at 4. Or wait, maybe F is correct. 

Alternatively, let's think about the options. The preconceptual stage is from 2 to 4, which is the sensorimotor stage. The intuitive thought is the first stage of preoperational, where the child starts using symbolic thinking, like using words for objects and classifying them. So maybe the two substages are from 2-4 (preconceptual) and 4-7 (intuitive thought). That would match option F.

Looking at option A: It says the preoperational stage includes intuitive thought from 2-4 and formal operations from 4-7. That seems to be combining two subphases with the same start, which might not be correct because they should be distinct. 

Option F's description seems to fit. It lists two substages: preconceptual (2-4) and intuitive (4-7). That makes sense because the preconceptual is the initial stage where symbolic use begins, and then the intuitive is the first use of abstract thinking. So, the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F. The preoperational stage is divided into two substages: the preconceptual stage from ages 2 to 4, where symbolic use begins, and the intuitive thought stage from ages 4 to 7, where abstract thinking starts. 

Answer: F
