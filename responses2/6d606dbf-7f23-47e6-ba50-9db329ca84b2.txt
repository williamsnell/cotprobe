Okay, so I have this question about Miss Florence Parrish's earnings for January. Let me read it carefully. She earns a semi-monthly salary of $160, plus a commission of 1% on her monthly sales. Her sales for January were $3,680. I need to find her total earnings.

Hmm, first, let me make sure I understand the terms. A semi-monthly salary means she gets paid twice a month. So if she's making $160 every two weeks, that's her regular pay. Then there's a commission, which is an extra percentage of her sales. The commission rate is 1%, so I need to calculate that.

Let me write down the steps. Total earnings = salary + commission.

Salary: $160. That's straightforward.

Commission: 1% of $3,680. To find 1% of a number, I can multiply it by 0.01.

So, 3,680 multiplied by 0.01. Let me calculate that. 3,680 * 0.01 is 36.80. So her commission is $36.80.

Now, adding that to her salary: $160 + $36.80 equals $196.80? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, that would make her total $196.80, but looking at the options, none of them are near that. Oh wait, the options are all around $300 or so. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the commission. Let me check again. 1% of $3,680 is indeed $36.80. So her total would be $160 (salary) + $36.80 (commission) = $196.80. But the options are in the $300 range, so something's wrong here. Maybe I misread the question.

Wait, the question says she earns a semi-monthly salary of $160. Does that mean she gets paid every two weeks, so in January she gets two payments? So $160 per two weeks. So in January, which is 13 weeks (assuming), she gets paid every two weeks, so two payments. So the total salary for the month would be 2 * $160 = $320. Oh, I see! I think I misread the question. It's semi-monthly, meaning twice a month, so if it's a 32-week month, she gets paid every 16 weeks, but in the question, it's stated as a semi-monthly salary. So perhaps that's $160 per two weeks, so two times in the month. So $160 * 2 = $320.

That makes more sense because the options are in the $300s. So the correct total would be $320 (salary) plus $36.80 (commission) equals $356.80. That's one of the options. Looking at the options, option C is $366.80, D is $360.80, J is $325.80, I is $376.80. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate. No, wait. No, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait no, perhaps I confused the time frame. Let's think again. Perhaps the semi-monthly salary is $160 per two weeks, so in January, she gets two payments, so $160 * 2 = $320. Then the commission is 1% of $3,680, which is $36.80. So total is 320 + 36.80 = 356.80. So looking at the options, option C is $366.80, D is $360.80, J is $325.80, I is $376.80. Oh wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me check the options again: 

Options are A:380.80, B:372.80, C:366.80, D:360.80, E:350.80, F:342.80, G:356.80, H:340.80, I:376.80, J:325.80.

Wait, option G is $356.80. So that's what I got. So the correct answer should be option G: $356.80.

Wait, but why am I doubting this? Let me make sure. The question says she earned a semi-monthly salary of $160. So that's after two weeks, so in a 32-week month, she would have 16 payments. But the question is about her earnings for the month, which would include all her earnings, including the commission.

So her salary is $160 twice, so $320. Commission is 1% of $3,680, which is $36.80. Total is $356.80, which is option G.

But wait, why is option I $376.80? Let me check. Oh, perhaps I added the salary and the commission incorrectly. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 1% of 3,680 is 36.80. 320 + 36.80 = 356.80. So yes, it's $356.80, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm seeing that the options include higher amounts, like 372.80, which is option B. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the commission.

Wait, wait, 3,680 * 0.01 is 36.80. That's correct. So why is option B 372.80? That's $372.80, which is higher. How could that be?

Wait, is there a mistake in the commission calculation? Maybe she's earning a commission of 1% on her sales, but perhaps the sales are 3,680, and maybe it's 3,680 plus something else? No, the question says she earned 1% commission on her monthly sales, which were $3,680.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a dollar sign or a multiplication somewhere. Let me check: 3,680 * 0.01 is 36.80. That's correct. So adding 320 and 36.80 gives 356.80, which matches option G.

But wait, the options list G as 356.80, which is one of them. So the correct answer would be G: $356.80.

Wait, but let me make sure that the semi-monthly salary is $160. So if she gets paid every two weeks, in January, she would get two payments. So two times $160 is $320. Then adding the 1% commission on $3,680, which is $36.80, totals $356.80. So option G is correct.
</think>

The correct answer is G: $356.80.

**Explanation:**
1. **Salary Calculation:** Miss Florence earns a semi-monthly salary of $160, which means she receives this amount twice in a month (since a month is typically considered to have two pay periods). Thus, her total salary for the month is:
   \[
   2 \times \$160 = \$320
   \]

2. **Commission Calculation:** She earns a commission of 1% on her monthly sales. Her sales for January were $3,680. To find 1% of $3,680:
   \[
   3,680 \times 0.01 = \$36.80
   \]

3. **Total Earnings:** Adding the salary and commission together:
   \[
   \$320 + \$36.80 = \$356.80
   \]

Thus, her total earnings for the month are $356.80, which corresponds to option G.
