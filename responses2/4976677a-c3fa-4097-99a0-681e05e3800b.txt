Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about voting populations, and I need to figure out which statement is the most accurate. Let me think through each option carefully. 

The question asks which statement is the most accurate about voting populations. I remember that voting behavior can vary based on various factors like education level, income, age, etc. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Voters are more likely to vote at age 18 than at age 65. Hmm. I think older ages are more likely to have more experience with politics. Maybe someone who's 18 might be more active in the workforce and thus more likely to vote. But I'm not sure if that's always the case. Also, some people don't vote because of other reasons. So maybe it's not as straightforward as that.

Option B: An individual with a bachelor's degree is less likely to vote than someone with only a high school diploma. I'm not sure about this. I know that higher education often correlates with more informed citizens and sometimes a greater commitment to public service. But I also remember that some studies show that education doesn't directly predict voting behavior. For example, people with higher education might be less likely to vote if they're not interested or motivated. So this might not be accurate.

Option C: Affluent individuals are less likely to vote than those from impoverished areas. Affluent people have more resources, but some might be more likely to pay attention to politics. But I've heard that people from poorer areas have higher turnout rates, especially in some regions. Also, affluence might be more about economic status, which isn't the same as political awareness. So this might not be correct.

Option D: Individuals are less likely to vote in a closely contested race. This sounds familiar. I remember that in closely contested races, there might be more questions or debates, which could lead to less commitment to voting. So maybe people don't feel as strongly about the issues, leading them to not vote as much. But I'm not sure if this is a general trend. Some sources might say this is true, but others might argue that in a closely contested race, the political climate is more intense, possibly leading to more voting.

Option E: Individuals without high school diplomas are more likely to vote than those with degrees. I've read that low education levels don't necessarily correlate with higher voting rates. In fact, some studies suggest that higher education might lead to better political awareness. Also, some people might not feel motivated to vote because they lack the knowledge or experience. So this might not be accurate because it's possible that both high and low educated individuals have similar voting tendencies.

Option F: Less likely to vote in rural areas compared to urban. I don't recall any strong correlation between living in a rural area and voting behavior. In fact, urban areas might have more access to events and media coverage, which can boost voting rates. So this statement might be incorrect.

Option G: An individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than someone with a high school diploma. This seems plausible because higher education might offer more opportunities, making the individual more committed to politics. Additionally, people with higher education might be more aware of their political stance and thus more likely to engage in voting. This could make G the most accurate statement.

The most accurate statement is G: An individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than someone with only a high school diploma. Higher education often correlates with greater political awareness and commitment, making graduates more likely to vote. 

Answer: G
