Question:

 A ball is thrown eastward into the air from the origin (in the direction of the positive $x$-axis). The initial velocity is $50 \mathrm{i}+80 \mathrm{k}$, with speed measured in feet per second. The spin of the ball results in a southward acceleration of $4 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{s}^2$, so the acceleration vector is $\mathbf{a}=-4 \mathbf{j}-32 \mathbf{k}$. What speed does the ball land?

D: $9\sqrt{93}$ $\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{s}$

Okay, so I have this physics problem about a ball being thrown eastward into the air. Hmm, let's see. The initial velocity is 50i + 80k. That means it's moving along the x and z axes. So, the x-axis is east, and the z-axis is up, since it's thrown into the air. The acceleration is given as -4j -32k. Oh wait, so the acceleration has both a southward component (negative y-axis) and a downward component (negative z-axis). So the ball is being hit with a southward push and also accelerating downward.

I need to find the speed when it lands. So, when does the ball land? Well, it's thrown from the origin, so the initial position is (0,0,0). But I don't know the horizontal distance it travels, so maybe I need to find the time it takes for the ball to land. Then, given the time, I can find the velocity components and calculate the speed.

Let me think about the motion in each direction. Let's break it down into x, y, and z components.

Starting with the x-direction. The initial velocity is 50 ft/s east, so v0x = 50 ft/s. The x-component of acceleration is zero because the acceleration is only in y and z. Wait, no, the problem says the acceleration is -4j -32k. So the acceleration is in all three directions. Oh, right, because it's thrown eastward, and the spin causes southward and downward accelerations. So all three components are non-zero.

Wait, so for the x-direction, acceleration is zero because the spin is causing the acceleration in y and z. So the x-component of velocity remains constant. So the velocity in x is 50 ft/s all the time. So the x-component of the position at time t is x(t) = v0x * t = 50t.

For the z-direction, the initial velocity is 80 ft/s upwards, and the acceleration is -32 ft/s². So the z-position as a function of time is z(t) = v0z * t + 0.5 * a_z * t². So that's 80t - 16t².

Now, for the y-direction, the initial velocity is zero (since the throw is eastward), and the acceleration is -4 ft/s². So the y-position is y(t) = 0 + 0.5*(-4)*t² = -2t².

Wait, but when does the ball land? It lands when z(t) = 0 again because it's thrown from the ground. So we can set z(t) = 0 and solve for t.

z(t) = 80t - 16t² = 0. Let's factor that: t(80 - 16t) = 0. So t = 0 (which is the initial time) or 80 -16t = 0 → 16t =80 → t=5 seconds.

So the time when it lands is 5 seconds.

Now, I need to find the velocity components at t=5 s.

For x: v_x = 50 ft/s. So the speed in x is 50.

For y: The y-component of velocity is v_y(t) = v0y + a_y * t. Since v0y is zero, it's 0 + (-4) * t = -4t. At t=5, v_y = -4*5 = -20 ft/s. The speed is the magnitude, so 20 ft/s.

Wait, but the question asks for the speed. So the speed is sqrt(vx² + vy² + vz²).

Wait, yes. Because velocity is a vector, so the speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector.

So, at t=5:

vx = 50 ft/s

vy = -20 ft/s

vz: Let's compute that. vz(t) = v0z + a_z * t. v0z is 80 ft/s, a_z is -32 ft/s². So vz =80 + (-32)*5 =80 -160= -80 ft/s.

So the velocity vector is (50, -20, -80) ft/s.

Now, the speed is sqrt(50² + (-20)² + (-80)^2) = sqrt(2500 + 400 + 6400) = sqrt(2500 + 6400 = 8900; 8900 +400=9300). So sqrt(9300) = sqrt(93 * 100) = 10*sqrt(93). So speed is 10√93 ft/s.

Looking at the options, option I is 10√93. So the answer is I.

To determine the speed of the ball when it lands, we analyze the motion in each direction (x, y, z) and calculate the velocity components at the time of landing.

### Motion in the z-direction (vertical motion):
- Initial velocity: \( v_{0z} = 80 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Acceleration: \( a_z = -32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \)
- Position as a function of time: \( z(t) = v_{0z} t + \frac{1}{2} a_z t^2 = 80t - 16t^2 \)

When the ball lands, \( z(t) = 0 \):
\[
80t - 16t^2 = 0 \implies t(80 - 16t) = 0 \implies t = 5 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

### Velocity in the z-direction:
\[
v_z(t) = v_{0z} + a_z t = 80 - 32t.
\]
At \( t = 5 \, \text{s} \):
\[
v_z = 80 - 32(5) = 80 - 160 = -80 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

### Motion in the x-direction (eastward motion):
- Initial velocity: \( v_{0x} = 50 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Acceleration: \( a_x = 0 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \)
- Velocity in the x-direction remains constant: \( v_x = 50 \, \text{ft/s} \).

### Motion in the y-direction (southward motion):
- Initial velocity: \( v_{0y} = 0 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Acceleration: \( a_y = -4 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \)
- Velocity in the y-direction as a function of time: \( v_y(t) = v_{0y} + a_y t = -4t \).

At \( t = 5 \, \text{s} \):
\[
v_y = -4(5) = -20 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

### Total Velocity Vector:
The velocity components at landing are:
\[
v_x = 50 \, \text{ft/s}, \quad v_y = -20 \, \text{ft/s}, \quad v_z = -80 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

The speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector:
\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2} = \sqrt{50^2 + (-20)^2 + (-80)^2} = \sqrt{2500 + 400 + 6400} = \sqrt{9300}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
\sqrt{9300} = \sqrt{93 \times 100} = 10\sqrt{93} \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

Thus, the speed of the ball when it lands is \( 10\sqrt{93} \, \text{ft/s} \).
