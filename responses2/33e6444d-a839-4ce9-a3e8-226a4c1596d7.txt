Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about algebraic topology and group theory. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about two statements regarding free abelian groups and finitely generated abelian groups. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false, and then match them with the given options.

First, let me look at Statement 1: "There exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank." Hmm, I remember that a free abelian group is one that has a basis, much like how vector spaces have bases. The rank of a free abelian group is the number of elements in a basis. So, for any positive integer n, can we find a free abelian group of rank n?

Wait, yes. For any n, we can take Z^n, which is the set of all n-tuples of integers. Each Z^n is free abelian, and its rank is n. So Statement 1 should be true, right? Because regardless of the positive integer n, you can construct such a group.

Now, Statement 2: "A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set." Hmm, Betti numbers... I think the Betti numbers are related to the ranks of the homology groups. For a connected space, the first Betti number is the number of independent cycles, which is the rank of the first homology group. But in group theory terms, for finitely generated abelian groups, the Betti numbers relate to the ranks of the abelian groups in their decomposition into cyclic components.

Wait, the Betti number in this context might be the rank of the homology. For a finitely generated abelian group G, I remember that the first homology group H_1(G) is isomorphic to G. So the Betti number, which I think is the rank of H_1, is equal to the rank of G. But Statement 2 says that if the Betti number of G equals the number of elements in some generating set, then G is free abelian. Wait, but isn't G itself free abelian if that's the case?

Wait, wait. No, not necessarily. Because, for example, consider a finitely generated abelian group that has a higher rank than its generating set. But wait, no: a finitely generated abelian group's rank is the number of direct summands in its decomposition. So if you have a group with rank r, it can be generated by at most r elements. So if, for example, the Betti number (which is the rank of H_1, which equals the rank of G) is equal to the number of elements in some generating set. Wait, no. Because the number of elements in a generating set can be larger than the rank.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think about it differently. For a finitely generated abelian group G, if the rank of G is r, then the minimal number of generators needed is r. So, the number of elements in some generating set would be at least r. So, if the Betti number (which is the rank r) is equal to some number k, which is the number of elements in a generating set, that would mean k is at least r. But then, what does that mean for G being free abelian?

Wait, if G is finitely generated and abelian, and its Betti number (r) equals the number of elements in some generating set (k). So k must be at least r, but what if k equals r? Then G would have a generating set of size r, which is exactly the rank. But that's the minimal number of generators. So any group with r generators would have a generating set of size r. So the Betti number (r) equals the size of a generating set (r). So in that case, G is free abelian. But wait, another example: suppose G is Z × Z, which is rank 2. Then any generating set would have at least 2 elements, right? So in this case, if the Betti number (2) equals the number of elements in the generating set, then G is free abelian. But wait, what if the generating set is smaller? Like, if you have Z × Z / (2Z × 2Z), which is Z/2Z × Z/2Z. This group is finitely generated (generated by a single element, perhaps (1,1)), but it's not free abelian because every element has order 2. So in this case, the Betti number is 2, but the number of elements in some generating set (which is 1) is not equal to 2. So the statement says that if the Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set, then G is free abelian. But in this case, Betti number is 2, which is not equal to 1, so it doesn't apply. Wait, but if the Betti number is equal to the number of elements in a generating set, what's the implication?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the Betti number here. Let me clarify. The Betti number is the rank of the homology groups. For a finitely generated abelian group G, H_1(G) is isomorphic to G, so the Betti numbers (which are the ranks of the homology groups) are the ranks of G. So the first Betti number is the rank r of G. So if the Betti number (r) equals the size of a generating set (k), but wait, the size of the generating set can't be smaller than r, because you need at least r elements to generate a rank r group. So if k >= r, and r=k. So k must equal r. Then, in that case, G can be generated by exactly r elements, which is the minimal generating set. So G is free abelian—because any group that is f.g. and has a generating set of size equal to its rank is free abelian. Because otherwise, you couldn't have a free abelian group with a smaller basis.

Wait, but wait. Suppose G is Z^2, which has rank 2. If I have a generating set of size 2, then it's free abelian. If I have a generating set of size 3, then G is still free abelian, but the minimal generating set is 2. So in that case, if a group G has rank 2, and a generating set of size 2, it's free abelian. But what if G has rank 2, and the generating set is of size 3. Then, can G still be free abelian? No, because a free abelian group of rank 2 only requires 2 generators. So if someone gives me a group that's rank 2, but requires 3 generators, that's not possible because a free abelian group of rank 2 can't have more than 2 generators. Therefore, such a group can't exist. Wait, but in reality, any group that is finitely generated and abelian is free abelian only if it's rank is equal to the minimal number of generators. So if the Betti number (which is the rank) equals the number of elements in the generating set, then the group is free abelian. So Statement 2 is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of another example. Suppose G is Z × Z × Z, which is rank 3. Suppose someone says that G can be generated by 3 elements. That's true. If someone says that G can be generated by 4 elements, is that possible? No, because the minimal generating set is 3. So if G is generated by 4 elements, then it's possible only if the minimal generating set is 3, meaning G is free abelian. So the statement is correct.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Statement 2 says: "A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set." So if the Betti number (rank) equals the number of elements in some generating set, then G is free abelian. But how can that be? Because if G is finitely generated and abelian, then it's free abelian if and only if it's torsion-free. The Betti number is the rank, which is the maximum number of Z-linearly independent elements, which for free abelian groups is the same as the number of generators in a generating set. So, if the Betti number equals the size of the generating set, then the group can't have any torsion, because any torsion element would contribute to the torsion subgroup, which is detected by Betti numbers beyond the free part. So if the Betti numbers (ranks) equal the number of generators, then there's no torsion, so G is free abelian. Therefore, Statement 2 is correct.

Wait, so both statements are true. Let me look at the options. Option F says Statement 1 is false for certain positive integers, and Statement 2 is false. Option F isn't correct because I thought both statements are true. Option G says Statement 1 is true only for certain positive integers, which isn't correct because it's always true. Option J says both are true. So the answer should be J.
</think>

Both statements are true. Statement 1 is true because every free abelian group has a basis of a given size. Statement 2 is correct under the reasoning that if a finitely generated abelian group's Betti number matches the number of its generators, it must be free abelian, as torsion elements would make the Betti numbers different.

ANSWER: J
