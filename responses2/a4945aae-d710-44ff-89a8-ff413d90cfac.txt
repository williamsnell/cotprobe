Question:

A psychologist conducts an experiment in which subjects are asked to learn a series of “facts” which are actually statements that have been fabricated by the research team. The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?
I. The amount the subjects were compensated.
II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.
III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.
IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.

Options:

A: I and II only
B: III only
C: I, II, and III only
D: II, III, and IV only
E: I and IV only
F: I and III and IV only
G: I, III, and IV only
H: II and IV only
I: II only
J: I, II, and IV only

Okay, so I need to figure out which of the variables are dependent variables in this experiment. Let me start by recalling what a dependent variable is. From what I remember, a dependent variable is what the experiment measures to see if the independent variable(s) have an effect. 

In this experiment, the independent variables are things like the compensation, the time given, and the room where the facts were recalled. So the dependent variables would be the outcomes measured for each subject, which are likely the things being tested.

Looking at the options, the variables given are I, II, III, IV.

I. The amount the subjects were compensated.
II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.
III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.
IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.

Wait, the question is asking which are dependent variables. So, the dependent variables are what is measured, not what's manipulated.

Compensation (I) is an independent variable because it's what's varying to see its effect. So I is an independent variable, not a dependent one.

The room (II) is where the subjects were recalling the facts. That's another independent variable because it's being manipulated. So that's the room, not the dependent.

Number of facts recalled (III) — that's likely the dependent variable because we're measuring how many they can remember. So III is a dependent variable.

Time given (IV) — that's also an independent variable because it's the amount of time given. So IV is independent, not dependent.

So the dependent variables are III and that's it. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A: I and II only — No, because those are independent.

B: III only — Yes, that's correct.

C: I, II, III — No, because III is dependent and I and II are independent.

D: II, III, IV — No, because II and IV are independent.

E: I and IV — No, those are independent.

F: I, III, IV — No, because I and IV are independent.

G: I, III, IV — No, same as F.

H: II and IV — No, because II and IV are independent.

J: I, II, and IV — No, same as A.

So the correct answer should be option B: III only.

The dependent variables in the experiment are those measured to assess the effect of the independent variables. Among the options:

- **I. The amount the subjects were compensated.** (Independent, not dependent)
- **II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.** (Independent, not dependent)
- **III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.** (Dependent variable, as it measures the outcome)
- **IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.** (Independent, not dependent)

The correct answer is **B: III only**.

**Answer: B**
