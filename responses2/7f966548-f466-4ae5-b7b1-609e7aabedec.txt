Okay, so I need to find the 1001th digit after the decimal point in the decimal expansion of 9/28. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you divide two numbers, the decimal can either terminate or repeat. Since 9 and 28 don't have common factors besides 1, the decimal should repeat.

Wait, maybe I should first perform the division of 9 by 28 to see what the decimal looks like. Let me try that.

So, 28 goes into 9 zero times. Add a decimal point and a zero, making it 90. 28 goes into 90 three times (because 28*3=84). Subtract 84 from 90, and you get 6. Bring down another zero, making it 60. 28 into 60 is 2 times (28*2=56). Subtract 56 from 60, you get 4. Bring down another zero, making it 40. 28 into 40 is 1 time (28*1=28). Subtract 28 from 40, you get 12. Bring down another zero, making it 120. 28 into 120 is 4 times (28*4=112). Subtract 112 from 120, you get 8. Bring down another zero, making it 80. 28 into 80 is 2 times (28*2=56). Subtract 56 from 80, you get 24. Bring down another zero, making it 240. 28 into 240 is 8 times (28*8=224). Subtract 224 from 240, you get 16. Bring down another zero, making it 160. 28 into 160 is 5 times (28*5=140). Subtract 140 from 160, you get 20. Bring down another zero, making it 200. 28 into 200 is 7 times (28*7=196). Subtract 196 from 200, you get 4. Wait, I've seen 4 before. So the decimal starts repeating from here.

Let me list out what I have so far. The decimal expansion of 9/28 is 0.32142857142857142857..., right? Wait, no, let me recount. Wait, maybe I should write it step by step.

Wait, no, perhaps I should do the long division properly to get the correct decimal places. Let me try again:

9 ÷ 28:

28 into 9.000000...

First digit: 0.
9 ÷ 28 is 0, so we write 0.
Multiply by 10: 90. 28 into 90 is 3 (3*28=84). Subtract: 90-84=6. Bring down 0: 60.
28 into 60 is 2 (2*28=56). Subtract: 60-56=4. Bring down 0: 40.
28 into 40 is 1 (1*28=28). Subtract: 40-28=12. Bring down 0: 120.
28 into 120 is 4 (4*28=112). Subtract: 120-112=8. Bring down 0:80.
28 into 80 is 2 (2*28=56). Subtract:80-56=24. Bring down 0:240.
28 into 240 is 8 (8*28=224). Subtract:240-224=16. Bring down 0:160.
28 into 160 is 5 (5*28=140). Subtract:160-140=20. Bring down 0:200.
28 into 200 is 7 (7*28=196). Subtract:200-196=4. Bring down 0:40.

Wait a minute, I've seen 4 before. So the decimal starts repeating from here. So the decimal is 0.32142857142857142857... Let me write it as 0.32142857142857142857... So the repeating part is 142857142857... Wait, wait, let me see. Wait, after 321428, the next digits were 571428, which is the same as before. So the repeating cycle is 142857, I think. Let me check that again.

Wait, from when I got 4, then I had 160, which gave me 5. So the next digits after the initial 32142 are 857142... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the repeating part is 571428 because after 32142, the next is 8, then 5, then 7, etc. Let me write out the decimal expansion step by step:

0.

After division, the digits are:
3 (from 90 ÷28=3), so 0.3
2 (from 60 ÷28=2), so 0.32
1 (from 40 ÷28=1), 0.321
4 (from 12 ÷28=4), 0.3214
2 (from 80 ÷28=2), 0.32142
8 (from 240 ÷28=8), 0.321428
5 (from 160 ÷28=5), 0.3214285
7 (from 200 ÷28=7), 0.32142857
1 (from 40 ÷28=1), 0.321428571
4 (from 120 ÷28=4), 0.3214285714
2 (from 80 ÷28=2), 0.32142857142
8 (from 240 ÷28=8), 0.321428571428
5 (from 160 ÷28=5), 0.3214285714285...
So the decimal is 0.32142857142857142857... and so on.

Wait, so the repeating part starts after how many digits? Let's see, after the initial 3, the next digits are 2,1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,2,8,5,7... So perhaps the repeating cycle is 142857, which is 6 digits long. Because once we get to 5, the next digits start repeating the same sequence.

Wait, but let's look at the sequence. After 321428, the next digits are 571428571428... So the repeating cycle is 571428, which is 6 digits. Alternatively, perhaps the cycle is longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's 142857, which is 6 digits.

Wait, perhaps the repeating part is 142857. Let me think: the decimal expansion of 9/28 is 0.32142857142857142857..., so after the initial 32142, the next digits are 857142857142857142... Hmm, perhaps I should write the decimal as 0.32142857142857142857... So the repeating cycle is 142857, which is 6 digits. Wait, let me check the actual decimal expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as 0.32142857142857142857... So the decimal is 32142857142857142857..., which is 0.32142857142857142857..., so the repeating cycle is 571428, but perhaps it's 6 digits. Wait, perhaps I can count the digits after the initial 32142. Let me see:

The digits after 32142 are 8,5,7,1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,2,8,... So the cycle seems to be 571428, which is 6 digits. So the repeating period is 6 digits, 571428, repeating.

Wait, 32142857142857142857... So after 32142, the next digits are 857142, but wait that's 6 digits: 857142. Oh, wait, no. Let me see: 32142 is the first five digits, then 8571428571428571..., so the repeating cycle is 571428, but wait, perhaps I need to look again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just note that the decimal expansion of 9/28 is 0.(32142857142857142857...) So the repeating part is 571428, which is 6 digits. Let me check this.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for the cycle length. Alternatively, perhaps I can perform the long division to find the period.

Wait, another approach: the denominator 28 can be factored into 4*7, so the period of the decimal expansion is the least common multiple of the periods of 1/4 and 1/7. But 1/4 has a period of 1, and 1/7 has a period of 6, so the period of 9/28 is 6. So the repeating cycle is 6 digits long.

Wait, let me confirm this. Since 28 = 4*7, and 1/4 has a period of 1, and 1/7 has a period of 6. The overall period is the LCM of 1 and 6, which is 6. So the decimal expansion of 9/28 will repeat every 6 digits.

Wait, but let's actually perform the division to see the exact repeating part. Let me list the decimal expansion step by step:

After the initial 3, the decimal is 32142857142857142857... So the sequence after 32142 is 857142, which is 6 digits. Wait, 857142 is the next 6 digits, but perhaps that's part of the cycle. Alternatively, perhaps the cycle is 571428, which is 6 digits.

Wait, let me try writing out the decimal expansion as per long division.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as 0.32142857142857142857... So the first 5 digits after the decimal are 3,2,1,4,2. Then the next digits are
