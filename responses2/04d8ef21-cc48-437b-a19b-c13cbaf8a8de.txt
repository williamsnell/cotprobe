Okay, so I have this question about effective interest rates. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking for the effective rate when you have a 3% interest rate compounded monthly. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. 

Wait, effective rate... I remember that effective rate takes into account the compounding periods. So, I think the formula is something like (1 + nominal rate / number of periods) raised to the number of periods and then subtracting 1. Let me get that straight.

The formula for effective annual rate (EAR) is EAR = (1 + (nominal rate / m))^m - 1, where m is the number of compounding periods per year. In this case, the nominal rate is 3%, so 0.03, and since it's monthly, m is 12.

So plugging in the numbers, it's (1 + 0.03 / 12)^12 - 1. Let me calculate that step by step. 

First, 0.03 divided by 12. Let's see, 0.03 / 12 is 0.0025. So each month adds 0.25% to the principal. Now, I need to raise (1 + 0.0025) to the 12th power. 

I think the exact calculation would be (1.0025)^12. I remember that this isn't a simple 0.03 multiplied by 12, because compounding means each month's interest is added to the principal, which then earns interest the next month. So the effective rate is higher than the nominal rate.

I think the value of (1.0025)^12 is approximately 1.0304. Let me confirm that. I remember that when you have something like (1 + r/m)^m, it's about e^(r) when m is large, but here m is 12. Alternatively, I can use logarithms or a calculator function.

Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step. Let me try:

1.0025^1 = 1.0025

1.0025^2 = 1.0025 * 1.0025. Let me calculate that:

1.0025 * 1.0025 = (100.25 * 100.25) / 10000. Wait, no, perhaps a better way. 1.0025 * 1.0025 = 1 + 2*0.0025 + (0.0025)^2 = 1 + 0.005 + 0.00000625 = 1.00500625.

So 1.00500625. Now, let's cube this for the third month.

1.00500625 * 1.0025. I'll approximate. 1.005 * 1.0025 = 1.0075125. But the actual numbers are 1.00500625 * 1.0025. Let me compute that:

1.00500625 * 1 = 1.00500625
1.00500625 * 0.0025 = 0.002512515625
Adding them gives approximately 1.007518775. So after three months, it's about 1.007519.

But I'm doing this step by step for 12 months. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn) when n is large. But here, m=12, which isn't that large, so maybe that's not the best approach.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the exact calculation. Maybe there's a way to remember that (1.0025)^12 is approximately 1.0304. Let me think... So 3% nominal rate, 12 months. 3% divided by 12 is 0.25% per month.

Alternatively, I could use the formula in another way. Since I'm not good at exact calculations, maybe I can use the approximation formula for EAR: EAR ≈ (1 + r/m)^m -1. So plugging in 3% as r, which is 0.03, and m=12, I get (1.03/12)^12 -1.

Wait, no, that's the same as before. Alternatively, using the formula (1 + 0.03/12)^12. Let me compute that with a calculator.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as 1.0025^12. I remember that (1.0025)^12 is approximately 1.030446. So subtracting 1 gives 0.030446, which is approximately 0.0304.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.0304. So the effective rate should be approximately 3.04%, which is option B.

The effective annual rate (EAR) for a 3% nominal rate compounded monthly is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^m - 1 \]

where \( r = 0.03 \) (3%) and \( m = 12 \) (monthly compounding). Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{0.03}{12}\right)^{12} - 1 = (1.0025)^{12} - 1 \]

Approximating \( (1.0025)^{12} \) yields approximately 1.030446. Subtracting 1 gives:

\[ \text{EAR} \approx 0.030446 \]

This corresponds to option B (0.0304).
