Question:

Dr. Sam Solo is the only psychologist in a small town, and his son is enrolled in the town's only elementary school. Dr. Solo receives a call from his son's teacher who says she would like to begin therapy with him. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Solo should:

Options:

A: tell the teacher that he can only see her if she agrees to switch his son to a different class.
B: begin therapy with her but avoid discussing his son or any school-related matters.
C: begin therapy with her and discuss the potential for conflicts during the initial session and, if necessary, in subsequent sessions.
D: suggest that the teacher seek therapy with a different professional to avoid any potential conflict of interest.
E: refuse therapy and refer her to a psychologist in a neighboring town.
F: accept the teacher as a client, but only after discussing the situation with the school board.
G: tell the teacher that he is ethically prohibited from seeing her because to do so would constitute a multiple (dual) relationship.

Okay, so I've got this question about ethics and therapy. Let me try to break it down.

So, Dr. Sam Solo is the only psychologist in a small town. His son is in the only elementary school there. The teacher wants to have the child therapy with him. Dr. Solo is supposed to act ethically as an psychologist.

Hmm. The options are A to G. Let me think about each one.

Option A says tell the teacher he can only see her if she agrees to switch classes. That doesn't sound right. If he can't see her without her agreeing, maybe she's asking for something she can't do. Also, as an psychologist, he should respect the child's decision. So A probably isn't the right choice.

Option B suggests beginning therapy but not discussing school matters. Wait, but if it's mutual, I think the child might not want to discuss school stuff. Plus, psychological interventions can involve school dynamics. So B might not be ethical.

Option C says to begin therapy and discuss potential conflicts. That makes sense. If they're in the same school, conflicts could arise, like the child's interest shifting. So, discussing that upfront is important. So C could be correct.

Option D suggests the teacher should seek a different professional, which I don't think is ethical. Trying to avoid conflict of interest is against the principles of professional ethics. So D is probably not the right answer.

Option E is refusing and referring, which is against ethical standards. If he can't help, he shouldn't refuse. So E is not right.

Option F says accept the child as a client but only after discussing with the school board. That sounds a bit too cautious. Maybe the school board has authority to involve the teacher, but it's still about ethics. If he doesn't discuss, it's not making a decision. Maybe F is too restrictive, but I'm not sure.

Option G says telling the teacher he's prohibited, which is unethical. He should let the child make her own choice if possible. So G is definitely wrong.

So the options left are C and F. Between them, C is about discussing potential conflicts, which is a responsible approach. F is about delaying the decision, which might be less ethical.

Wait, the question is about the ethical practice. If the child is okay with therapy, but conflicts are a possibility, it's better to discuss them. So C is correct.
</think>

The correct answer is C. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Sam should discuss potential conflicts during the initial session to ensure the child's well-being and school dynamics are managed appropriately.

Answer: C
