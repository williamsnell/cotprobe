Question:

In 1996, a developer purchased a 100-acre tract located in a northern county in a state. Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. "In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?

Options:

A: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.
B: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.
C: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
D: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully. 

The scenario is about a developer who bought a 100-acre tract in a northern county. He made a subdivision plan with 100 one-acre lots. Then in 1997, he sold 60 of them to individuals, each with a deed that said the same thing about no trailer or mobile homes. The next year, he sold the remaining 40 to a builder. The problem arises when the builder later sells all 40 lots, and the buyer (a mobile home owner) has a deed to one of them. The question is about which statement is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed.

Let me break down the facts step by step. 

In 1996: Developer buys 100 lots. 1997: He sells 60 lots, each having a deed stating that no trailer or mobile home can be built or maintained on any lot. These 60 lots are recorded with the county recorder's office.

Then, in 2003, he sells the remaining 40 lots to a builder. The builder's deed is identical to the first 60, I assume. So, the builder is the one who gets the 40 lots. 

In 2008, the builder sells all 40 lots. Each of these lots was identified as part of the subdivision, but the builder’s deed didn't include the mobile home restriction. So, the buyer (the mobile home owner) bought one of these lots through the builder.

The key point is whether the builder's deed included the restriction. It said the same as the first 60, so the builder's deed would have included the mobile home clause. But wait, the problem says the builder's deed was identical to the first 60. So, the builder's deed would have the restriction. 

Wait, but in 2003, the developer transferred the remaining 40 lots to the builder, and the builder's deed included the same clause. So, the builder's deed does include mobile home restriction. So, the buyer's deed to the builder didn't include that clause.

Now, the buyer's claim is that the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer. That is, the covenant was created by the developer and when the developer transferred the lots to the builder, the builder received the covenant. But the covenant hasn't been transferred to the buyer yet. So, the covenant is with the land at the developer's end, but not with the builder's. 

So, option A says the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder, but not the buyer. That sounds correct because the developer created the covenant (the no trailer and mobile home clause) by purchasing the lots. The builder received the covenant when he bought them (from the developer), but the buyer (the mobile home owner) doesn't have the covenant yet. So the covenant is with the developer and the land, but not with the builder or the buyer. So A seems correct.

Option B: The covenant could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner. Wait, does the covenant run with the land as far as any subdivision owner? The buyer is a subdivision owner, but the covenant was created by the developer, not the subdivision owners. So the builder is a subdivision owner, and the developer is another subdivision owner. So B says the covenant could be enforced by any subdivision owner. But the covenant was created by the developer, not the subdivision owner. So the owner's enforcability depends on their own ownership. So if the subdivision owner is the developer, then yes, the covenant is with them, but if the subdivision is the builder, the covenant is with him. So, the covenant is with the developer, which is a subdivision owner. So the builder is a subdivision owner. But does that mean the covenant could be enforced by any subdivision owner? Well, the developer is a subdivision owner. So (B) says the covenant could be enforced by any subdivision owner, including the builder. So B is correct, but the question is which statement is least accurate. Hmm, perhaps B is accurate, so not the answer.

Option C: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes. Wait, the developer sold the lots with the covenant, but the buyer didn't have it. So when the buyer bought the lot, the court doesn't know about the covenant. Because the covenant was created when the developer sold the lots, and the buyer didn't have the knowledge. So the buyer didn't have constructive notice. So C says the buyer should have had constructive notice, which is incorrect. So C is the least accurate statement.

Option D: All subsequent grantees would be in privity of estate. Wait, privity of estate means that the grantee and grantor are the same person, but in this case, the buyer is a new owner, so he's a grantee. The developer granted the builder a grantee (the builder). The builder later sold to the buyer. So the buyer is a grantee of the builder, who is a grantee of the developer. So, the buyer and the developer are not privity. If the buyer had been a grantee of the developer, then yes, but in this case, the buyer is a grantee of the builder, and the builder is a grantee of the developer. So the buyer and the developer are not privity, but the buyer and the builder are. So D says all subsequent grantees would be in privity. But the buyer is a grantee of the builder, who is a grantee of the developer. So, the buyer isn't privity with the developer. Therefore, D is correct because not all grantees would be in privity. 

Wait, but the question is about the buyer's deed. The buyer is a subsequent owner of the lots. So, when the buyer buys the lots through the builder, the developer's deed to the builder might have created a new covenant. But the buyer doesn't have the original covenant, so the covenant isn't enforceable against the builder yet. But the problem is whether the buyer has constructive notice. 

So, the developer sold the lots with the covenant, with the buyer not having it. So the buyer didn't have constructive notice, so C is the least accurate statement. So the answer would be option C.

The issue revolves around whether the buyer, a subsequent owner of the lots, had constructive notice of the covenant regarding mobile homes. The key points are as follows:

1. **Covenant Created by the Developer**: The developer created the covenant (no trailer or mobile home) by purchasing the lots in 1996. The covenant was not passed through to subdivision owners but was created when the developer sold the lots.

2. **Buyer’s Lack of Notice**: The buyer, who purchased the lots through the builder, did not have constructive notice of the covenant. Constructive notice requires the grantor ( Developer ) to disclose the covenant to the grantee ( the builder or buyer ). Since the covenant was created during the sale to the builder, it was not transferred to the buyer.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A**: Correct. The covenant ran with the land as far as the developer ( subdivision owner ) but not as far as the builder or the buyer.
   - **B**: Correct. The covenant could be enforced by subdivision owners, including the developer, but not by the builder or the buyer.
   - **C**: Incorrect. The buyer did not have constructive notice of the covenant.
   - **D**: Correct. Subsequent grantees ( builder and buyer ) are not in privity with the developer, even though they are in privity with each other.

The least accurate statement is **C**, as the buyer lacked constructive notice of the covenant.

**ANSWER: C**
