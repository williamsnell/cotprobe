The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Which of the following is a true statement?

Options:

A: An experiment is always more reliable than an observational study, regardless of design.
B: Cause-and-effect relationships can only be established through controlled experiments.
C: Increasing the sample size in an observational study can completely eliminate bias.
D: If properly designed, observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments.
E: While properly designed experiments can strongly suggest cause-and-effect relationships, a complete census is the only way of establishing such a relationship.
F: Controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies.
G: A census is the least accurate method of establishing cause-and-effect relationships.
H: The sample size of an observational study has no impact on the potential bias.
I: Observational studies can never suggest cause-and-effect relationships.
J: A useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about experiments and observational studies. I need to figure out which statements are true. Let me think through each option.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about these two research methods. Experiments are usually designed to establish cause-and-effect relationships because they manipulate variables and control for other factors. Observational studies, on the other hand, observe and measure variables without intervention.

Looking at the options:

Option A: An experiment is always more reliable than an observational study, regardless of design. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I remember that sometimes observational studies can have more variability because there might be confounding variables or if there's selection bias. Also, observational studies might have lower power because you can't control variables. So I think A is false.

Option B: Cause-and-effect can only be established through controlled experiments. Wait, I'm not so sure. There are methods like quasi-experimental or natural experiments that can show causality, especially in quasi-experiments using regression discontinuity or difference-in-differences. Also, sometimes observational studies can show causality if they're well-designed, but maybe not always. So B might not be entirely correct. Or wait, maybe it's true that it's difficult to say, but B says it can only be done through controlled experiments. I'm not sure. I'll come back to this.

Option C: Increasing sample size in observational can eliminate bias. I don't think so. Sample size affects power, maybe the precision of estimates but doesn't eliminate bias. Bias is about systematic errors, not random variation. So C is false.

Option D: If properly designed, observations can establish cause-effect as well. That sounds familiar. I think that's right. Properly designed observational studies can sometimes mimic experiments, especially in settings where treatment is assigned randomly or other balance is achieved. So D is true.

Option E: Properly designed experiments suggest causality, and a complete census is the only way. No, that's not right. Observational studies can also suggest causality with proper designs. And a complete census isn't just for establishing cause-and-effect, it's also a type of observational study (if you measure everything). So E is wrong.

Option F: Controlled experiments are done later to establish cause first suggested by obs. No, experiments are usually done first, and then observational studies are used to check or confirm. So F is incorrect.

Option G: A census is the least accurate. No, a census is when you measure everyone, so it's more accurate than an observational study. Because in an observational study, you can't control for all variables. So G is false.

Option H: Sample size doesn't affect bias. No, that's not right. Sample size affects the precision of estimates and statistical power. If you have a larger sample, your estimates are more likely to be accurate, but bias is more about systematic errors, not random variation. So H is false.

Option I: Observational studies can't suggest cause-effect. That's incorrect. They can, as I thought in D. So I is false.

Option J: Increase sample size to overcome bias. I don't think so. Sample size affects the accuracy but not necessarily the bias. Bias is more about systematic issues, like confounding variables. So J is false.

Wait, reviewing again. So the only true statements are D and perhaps another. Let me double-check.

Wait, what about option B? It says cause-effect can only be established through controlled experiments. No, that's not true. Because there are observational studies that can show causality, especially if they're properly designed. So B is false.

So which options are left? The only one that's definitely correct is D. So the answer must be D.
</think>

The correct answer is D.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Option A:** Incorrect. Experiments are usually more reliable because they manipulate variables and control for confounding factors, whereas observational studies lack this control.

2. **Option B:** Incorrect. While some observational studies can establish causality, they are not limited to controlled experiments. Quasi-experimental designs and natural experiments can also show causality.

3. **Option C:** Incorrect. Increasing sample size affects precision and power but does not eliminate bias, which is systematic error.

4. **Option D:** Correct. Properly designed observational studies can suggest causality, especially with randomized or balanced designs.

5. **Option E:** Incorrect. Properly designed experiments establish causality, and a complete census is not the sole method for establishing cause-and-effect; it's a type of observational study.

6. **Option F:** Incorrect. Controlled experiments are done first, and observational studies are used to confirm or explore.

7. **Option G:** Incorrect. A census is more accurate than an observational study.

8. **Option H:** Incorrect. Sample size affects precision, not bias.

9. **Option I:** Incorrect. Observational studies can establish causality.

10. **Option J:** Incorrect. Increasing sample size doesn't resolve bias; it improves accuracy.

Thus, the only true statement is D.
