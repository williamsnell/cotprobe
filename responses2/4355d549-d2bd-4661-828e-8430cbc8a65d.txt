Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Homo erectus. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with all the details, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that Homo erectus is a hominid, which I think is one of the first modern humans. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let's break down the options.

Option A: a stable, long-lived species. I'm not too sure, but I don't recall Homo erectus being stable or long-lived. Maybe some other species are, but not this one.

Option B: the first hominid to stand "erect" and walk upright. Wait, "erect" isn't a term I'm familiar with. I think erect means standing tall, but I don't remember if Homo erectus was the first to stand upright. Maybe it's the first to walk upright, but I'm not certain.

Option C: a hominid species that was completely herbivorous. I don't remember any completely herbivorous hominid. Most of the options are about their behavior, not diet.

Option D: the first hominid to develop agriculture. I think Homo erectus is considered the first hominid, but was it the first to develop agriculture? I'm not sure, but I thought the first was a later species, maybe something like Homo sapiens. Wait, no, I think the first hominid was the earliest, so maybe D is incorrect.

Option E: an unsuccessful, short-lived species. That doesn't ring a bell. I don't think Homo erectus was unsuccessful or short-lived.

Option F: a hominid species that lived primarily in trees. I've heard that Homo erectus lived in grasslands, not just trees. So F might not be correct.

Option G: a species that coexisted with modern humans. That's true because many hominids, including Homo erectus, were part of the larger human and animal community. So G is probably correct.

Option H: the first hominid to develop complex language. I'm pretty certain that complex language development comes later, maybe with the rise of writing and grammar. So H isn't right.

Option I: the first hominid to make and use stone tools. Wait, Homo erectus is associated with writing? No, stone tools are made by modern humans. I think the first hominid to use stone tools would be Homo sapiens, maybe, but I'm not sure if that's considered the first. Alternatively, maybe the first hominid to make writing (like using a system of sounds) was another species. But I'm not certain about this one.

Wait, going back to the options. The question asks about the characteristics of Homo erectus. Let me think about the key points.

Homo erectus was the first hominid. So options B and D might not be correct because the first hominid is the first in the group, but perhaps D is incorrect because the first was the earliest, not necessarily the first to develop agriculture.

Wait, I think the first hominid was Homo erectus, but he's not the first to develop agriculture. The first hominid to develop agriculture was more like the Tigris or Etruscan species. So D is incorrect.

So between options, A and B are about stability, which I don't think apply. C is about herbivorous, which I don't think was the case. G says coexisted with modern humans. That's true. So G is correct.

Between B and I: I'm thinking that the first hominid to make stone tools might be a different species, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the first hominid who made stone tools is perhaps the one that used it, but the first hominid to have stone tools as part of their toolmaking might be a different species. Alternatively, maybe the first hominid to have written (which uses stone) was a different species. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another angle: the question is a multiple-choice about what was true about Homo erectus. So let's list the options again.

A: stable, long-lived. No, I don't think so.

B: first to stand erect and walk upright. I think Homo erectus was the first to have upright bodies, but not necessarily the first to stand erect. Maybe the first hominid to stand erect would be someone else. Alternatively, maybe B is correct.

C: completely herbivorous. No, I think it was more of a蜥iform or herbivorous but not entirely.

D: first to develop agriculture. No, it was more the first hominid to have written, which included stone tools.

E: unsuccessful, short-lived. No.

F: lived in trees. No, he lived in grasslands.

G: coexisted with modern humans. Yes, correct.

H: complex language. No.

I: first to make stone tools. Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the first hominid who used stone tools (like writing) might be a different species, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the first hominid to have stone tools as part of their toolmaking was a different species. So I'm not sure about this.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that Homo erectus was the first hominid, and that it was the only one to have written. Which probably involved using stone tools. So the first hominid to make and use stone tools would be the one who developed that. But I'm not sure if that's the first hominid or another species.

Alternatively, maybe the first hominid to have written was a different species, which would require a different answer.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

Homo erectus: what was it like?

So, I think the correct answer is G: a species that coexisted with modern humans. Because Homo erectus was the first hominid, but not the first to have written or development of agriculture.

Wait, the question is about the characteristics of Homo erectus. So the options are about what was true about him.

So the options:

A: stable, long-lived. No.

B: first to stand erect, walk upright. Maybe not.

C: completely herbivorous. No.

D: first to develop agriculture. No, because the first was a later species.

E: unsuccessful, short-lived. No.

F: lived in trees. No.

G: coexisted with modern humans. Yes.

H: complex language. No.

I: first to make stone tools. Hmm. I'm not exactly sure. I think the first hominid to use stone tools (like writing) might be a different species, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the correct answer is that the first hominid to make and use stone tools was the one who developed that, but I'm not sure if that's the first hominid. Alternatively, the first hominid to have such tools was the one that later evolved into the first hominid to have complex language.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about what's true about Homo erectus. The correct answer is G. Because he coexisted with modern humans. That's definitely true. So G is correct.

Homo erectus was the first hominid, but it is not the first to have developed complex language, coexist with modern humans, or stand erect. It was not the first to walk upright, nor was it completely herbivorous. While it is correct that it coexisted with modern humans, this is not the key characteristic of Homo erectus. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: G
