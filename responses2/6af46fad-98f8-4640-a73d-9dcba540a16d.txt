Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the lac operon in E. coli. I remember that the lac operon is responsible for the metabolism of lactose, right? It's involved in the breakdown of lactose into glucose and pyruvate.

The question is about a mutation in the repressor associated with the lac operon that prevents the repressor from binding to lactose. I think the lac operon has a repressor protein that's involved in repressing the operon when lactose isn't present.

Wait, the repressor binds to the operator region to inhibit transcription. So, in normal conditions, when lactose isn't present, the repressor is active and binds to the operator, preventing the operon from being transcribed. But when lactose is present, the repressor can't bind, so the operon is expressed.

But here, there's a mutation that stops the repressor from binding lactose. So normally, when lactose is present, the repressor would bind, but in this case, it's prevented from binding. Hmm, does that mean the repressor can't bind lactose anymore?

Wait, no. The repressor is usually bound to the operator when lactose isn't there. Normally, in the absence of lactose, the repressor is active and binds. But if a mutation prevents the repressor from binding lactose, does that mean the repressor can't bind lactose anymore? Or does it mean that the repressor is always active regardless of lactose presence?

Wait, the question says the mutation prevents the repressor from binding lactose. So the repressor can't bind lactose. So normally, when lactose is present, the repressor is inactive and can bind. If the repressor can't bind lactose, then it's always active. Because without being able to bind lactose, which is the inducer, the repressor can't be inactivated.

Wait no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Normally, the repressor is active when lactose is absent. So when lactose is absent, the repressor is active and binds the operator, preventing transcription. When lactose is present, the repressor is inactive (or can't bind lactose), so it can't block transcription. So the operon is expressed when lactose is present.

In the case of this mutation, the repressor can't bind lactose. So if the repressor can't bind lactose, it can't be inactivated. So the repressor remains active regardless of lactose presence. Because normally, in the presence of lactose, the repressor can't bind to the operator, so it doesn't repress. But in this mutation, the repressor can't bind lactose anymore, so it's always active.

Wait, no. Because the repressor's ability to bind is dependent on lactose. So if the mutation prevents the repressor from binding lactose, then the presence or absence of lactose doesn't affect whether the repressor can bind. So even if lactose is present, the repressor can't bind it, so it's still active.

So the operon would be repressed when lactose is present? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, in the normal situation, when lactose is present, the repressor is inactive (so it doesn't bind the operator). So the operon is active.

In this mutation, the repressor can't bind lactose. So when lactose is present, since the repressor can't bind, it's active. So the operon is always on. But when lactose is absent, the repressor would normally bind, but in this case, it can't. So in the absence of lactose, the repressor would still be active, meaning it can bind the operator and repress the operon.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Normally, when lactose is present, the repressor is inactive, so it can't bind the operator, so the operon is on.

In this mutation, the repressor can't bind lactose. So, when lactose is present, the repressor can't bind, so it's active. So the operon is on.

When lactose is absent, the repressor normally would bind (because lactose is present), so the operon is off. But in this mutation, the repressor can't bind lactose, so when lactose is absent, the repressor is still active and binds the operator, so the operon is on.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the repressor can't bind lactose, then when lactose is present, the repressor can't bind, so it's active. When lactose is absent, the repressor can't bind, so it's active. So in both cases, the operon is on. But that would mean the operon is always active, regardless of lactose presence. So the mutation would make the operon constitutively active.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when lactose is present, the operon is on, but the repressor is active. So in the presence of lactose, the operon is active, but the repressor is active.

So, in the mutation scenario, the operon would always be on. Because the repressor can't bind lactose, so it's always active.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in the presence of lactose, the operon is on because the repressor is inactive. But in the mutation, when lactose is present, the repressor is inactive, so the operon is on.

So, when lactose is present, operon is on. When lactose is absent, the repressor is active (since it can't bind lactose), so operon is off.

Wait, that's the opposite of normal. So the operon would be on only when lactose is present, and off when absent.

Wait, no, that can't be because in the mutation, the repressor can't bind lactose, which is the operator's binding. So if the repressor can't bind lactose, the presence of lactose doesn't affect whether the repressor can bind the operator.

So, when lactose is present, the repressor is inactive (since it can't bind), so operon is on.

When lactose is absent, the repressor is still active (since it can't bind lactose), so operon is off.

Wait, that's what the mutation would do. So the operon would be on when lactose is present and off when absent.

But the options are about the expression of the genes. The options are:

A: expression only when glucose is present.

B: no expression or reduced in all circumstances.

C: no change.

D: expression only when lactose is absent.

E: constitutive expression.

F: expression only when lactose is present.

G: expression always.

H: expression only when glucose is absent.

I: repressed always.

J: reduced only when lactose is present.

Wait, in our scenario, the operon is on when lactose is present and off when lactose is absent. So when lactose is present, it's active; when not, it's off.

So looking at the options:

Option F: expression only when lactose is present. That would mean the operon is on when lactose is present, off otherwise. Which matches our scenario.

But wait, I thought when the repressor can't bind lactose, whether lactose is present or not, the repressor would always be active and bind the operator when lactose is absent. Wait, no, because if the repressor can't bind lactose, then it can't be inactivated regardless of lactose presence. So when lactose is present, it's inactive, so operon is on.

When lactose is absent, the repressor can't bind lactose, so it's active again. So the operon remains off.

So, in this mutation, the operon is on when lactose is present, off when it's not. So the genes would be expressed when lactose is present, and not expressed otherwise.

Looking at the options, option F says: expression only when lactose is present. That would be correct if the operon is on only when lactose is present.

Wait, but in the initial state, when lactose is present, the operon is on. With the mutation, when lactose is present, the operon is on whether or not the repressor is active, because the repressor can't bind lactose. So in the presence of lactose, the operon is on, and when lactose isn't present, the operon is off.

So the genes are expressed only when lactose is present.

Wait, but another thought: the mutation prevents the repressor from binding lactose. So when lactose is present, the repressor can't bind, so it is inactive and the operon is on. When lactose is absent, the repressor can't bind lactose, so it's active, the operon is off.

So the genes are expressed only when lactose is present.

Looking at the options, F says: expression only when lactose is present. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. The options:

F: expression only when lactose is present.

So, the operon is on (genes expressed) only when lactose is present, and off when absent.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is F.

The lac operon in *E. coli* is regulated by the interaction between the repressor protein and the operator region. The repressor binds to the operator to block transcription when lactose is absent. In the presence of lactose, the repressor is inactivated and can no longer bind to the operator, allowing transcription to occur. 

In this scenario, a mutation prevents the repressor from binding lactose. This means that the repressor remains active regardless of whether lactose is present or absent. When lactose is absent, the repressor remains active and binds to the operator, blocking transcription. When lactose is present, the repressor cannot bind lactose, so it remains inactive and allows transcription to proceed. 

Thus, the lac operon is expressed only when lactose is present, and not expressed when lactose is absent. This matches the description in option F: "expression of the genes only when lactose is present."
