Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about psychosomatic disorders. Let's break it down. 

I remember that psychosomatic disorders are a type of mental health issue. So the options related to that would probably be D and H. Let me think about each.

Option D says psychosomatic disorders are imaginary diseases. Hmm, I think imaginary diseases are more like delusions or hallucinations, which aren't real. So maybe they're not purely imaginary. I'm not entirely sure, but I think they're more about internal conflicts or thoughts that aren't physical symptoms.

Option H says they're caused by spiritual imbalances and treated with spiritual healing. That sounds familiar. I remember that some mental disorders are rooted in internal beliefs or emotions, not physical factors. For example, depression might stem from unresolved trauma or an unresolved sense of isolation. So H seems correct.

Now, considering the options, the question asks what psychosomatic disorders are and what general means are used for treating them. So I should look for both parts.

Looking at the options again, I think the first part of the question is defining psychosomatic disorders, and the second part is about the general treatment methods.

Option E: They're diagnosed through physical exams and treated with surgery. That doesn't seem right because psychosomatic disorders are more about internal factors, not physical symptoms. So E is probably incorrect.

Option A: No physical symptoms, treated by counseling. That's a possibility, but I think psychosomatic disorders are more about internal issues, not just psychological alone. So maybe not A.

Option B: Exclusively environmental factors. I don't think that's the main cause. Many psychosomatic disorders have genetic or internal causes, not just environment.

Option C: Pure physical illnesses. No, psychosomatic disorders are mental, not physical.

Options F and G: Genetic disorders and gene therapy. Those are conditions caused by genetics, but psychosomatics are more about internal issues, so F and G are incorrect.

Option I: Only medication. No, because treatment can involve more than just medication; sometimes mental health is treated through therapy or other methods.

So the correct options for the first part of the question are D and H. Now, the second part of the question is about the general means used. So the treatment methods.

Option G says psychosomatic disorders are imaginary diseases, and treated with gene therapy. Wait, gene therapy is a medical approach, not necessarily treating the underlying mental issues. So G is incorrect because it associates it with medical treatment, where as psychosomatics are more about psychological factors.

Wait, another angle: Option H says treatment is both medical and psychological. So the treatment involves both. So for the second part of the question, which is about the general means, the correct options would be H or perhaps another.

Looking back at the options, the question is about what is meant by psychosomatic disorders and the general means used for treating them. So perhaps the first part is correct as D and H, and the second part is about the methods, which I think is H.

Wait, let me think again. The question is asking about the general means used. So the treatment methods for psychosomatic disorders include both medical approaches and psychological techniques.

Looking at the options, the correct treatment methods would involve both. So among the options, option H says "treated with medical and psychological." So H is correct.

So putting it together: psychosomatic disorders are a type of mental health condition (so D and H). The treatment methods include both medical and psychological approaches, which is option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer is a single choice. The question is asking for both the definition and the treatment methods.

Wait, the options are A to J. I think the correct answer is H because it correctly describes psychosomatic disorders and the general treatment methods. Because H says they are caused by spiritual imbalances and are treated with spiritual healing, and the treatment is a mix of medical and psychological approaches.

Option D is about imaginary diseases, which is more about delusions, not sure about the general treatment methods. So probably, the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is H: "Psychosomatic disorders are diagnosed only through physical examinations, and are treated with surgical procedures." This option accurately describes psychosomatic disorders as rooted in internal factors, such as spiritual imbalances, and emphasizes the use of both medical and psychological approaches for their treatment.

Answer: H
