Question:

A well-known Washington newspaper columnist was researching the background of a lawyer who had been nominated to become attorney general of the United States and was awaiting confirmation by the U. S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to "dirty tricks" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the information was obtained illegally.
B: prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.
C: prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.
D: prevail, because the apprentice acted on behalf of the columnist, making him liable.
E: not prevail, because the apprentice acted independently and without the knowledge or direction of the columnist.
F: not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.
G: not prevail, because the information was of public interest and its publication served a greater public good.
H: not prevail, because the lawyer was a public figure and therefore his actions are subject to public scrutiny.
I: prevail, because the publication of private letters is an infringement on personal rights.
J: not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no "false light. "

Okay, so I've got this legal question here. Let me read through it again. The question is about a situation where a lawyer's privacy is in question. An apprentice from a newspaper columnist copied some letters about a lawyer who won a presidential campaign. The lawyer is suing the columnist, and I need to determine who wins.

Hmm, the options are from A to J, each giving a different reason. I remember that the law has rules about the protection of personal privacy, especially when someone else copies letters. I think this relates to the doctrine of "infringement of private rights." But wait, there's more to it than just that; I think it's about the nature of the letters and whether they were obtained in a lawful way.

So, the letters are copies of letters from the lawyer's campaign. Are those letters private and can be freely copied? I remember that letters from the private sector, especially from a lawyer, are generally considered private. So, if the lawyer is suing the columnist, they might have grounds to challenge the copying.

But wait, there are some exceptions. For example, if the letters are part of a large document or if they are being published without authorization, that could be a problem. But in this case, the letters were copied without telling anyone, and presented to the columnist. The key here is whether the copying was done lawfully.

If the letters were obtained through a lawful means, then the copying might be infringing on the right to privacy. But if the letters were obtained without permission, then the copying wouldn't be a violation. But since the letters were from a lawyer's campaign, which is a private figure, I think they can be freely copied. So the copying here is probably considered lawful.

Wait, but another angle: the letters were private, so they're considered a private matter. The copying of private letters is generally protected by the Fifth Amendment, because it's a private matter. But I'm a bit fuzzy here. Let me think again. The Fifth Amendment applies to private rights, so if the letters are a matter of private rights, copying them without permission would be a violation.

But wait, the letters were written by a private figure. So if the letters were written by the lawyer, their nature is private. So the copying is against the right to private information. So the law would say that the copying is illegal because it's depriving the private individual of their right to information.

So looking at the options, option A says the information was obtained illegally, implying that the copying was done without permission. But wait, the letters were obtained without telling anyone, meaning the copying was done without authorization. So the information was obtained illegally. That would mean option A is correct.

Wait, but another possibility: what about the fact that the letters are private? So, perhaps, even if the copying law says it's illegal, some cases might hold that the private nature of the letters allows it. But I'm not sure. I think that the Fifth Amendment applies to the private rights, so the copying would be illegal regardless of the content.

So the lawyer's claim is that the copying was unlawful. So the answer should be A, which says the information was obtained illegally. But wait, another point: if the letters were part of a larger document or if they were being published without authorization, that could affect the outcome. But in this scenario, the letters were copied without telling anyone, and presented to the columnist. So the copying wasn't done for another purpose; it was for publication. So perhaps the copying was done without permission, making it illegal.

Let me think again. The key points are: the letters were copied without authorization, and they were part of the lawyer's campaign, which is a private figure. So the copying was done without permission, which would make it illegal. Therefore, the lawyer's claim would prevail, and the answer would be A.

Wait, but another thought: the letters are private, so when the lawyer is suing, they might argue that the copy infringes on the right to private information. So if the letters are considered private, then the copying is a violation, and the answer would be A.

Alternatively, if the letters were part of a larger document that the lawyer published, then perhaps the copying isn't against their private rights. But in this question, the letters are presumably part of the campaign, which the lawyer is awaiting confirmation. So the letters are likely considered a private matter, making copying against their rights.

So the correct answer is probably A: prevail, because the information was obtained illegally.
</think>

The correct answer is A: prevail, because the information was obtained illegally. The letters were copied without authorization and were part of a private figure's campaign, making the copying against their rights. The Fifth Amendment protects private rights, and the private nature of the letters ensures that the copying was unlawful.
