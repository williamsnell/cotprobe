Alright, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Okay, so it's about an adiabatic expansion of CO₂ gas. Hmm, I remember that adiabatic means no heat exchange with the surroundings. So Q is zero. But wait, wait, let's think about the details here.

The problem says the system is 2.0 mol of CO₂ gas. It's initially at 25°C, which is 298.15 K, and 10 atm pressure. The cylinder has a cross-section of 10 cm², which I guess means the area is 10 cm². The piston moves outwards through 20 cm. Oh, right, the volume change is important.

So, when the piston moves, it's expanding against an external pressure. The external pressure is 1.0 atm. Since it's adiabatic (Q=0), the first law of thermodynamics tells us that ΔU = -W, where W is the work done by the system. Because the system is expanding, work is done by the system, so W is positive, but since ΔU is negative, that makes sense because the internal energy decreases.

Wait, I should calculate the work done. Work done by the gas during expansion against a constant external pressure is W = P_ext * ΔV.

But wait, the external pressure is 1 atm, and the change in volume is the area times displacement. The area is 10 cm², which is 10e-4 m². The displacement is 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. So ΔV is area * displacement = 10e-4 m² * 0.2 m = 2e-5 m³.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the initial volume and final volume? Because the initial volume is the volume inside the cylinder when the piston is at 25°C. But wait, the initial state: initial pressure is 10 atm. But the volume can be calculated using PV = nRT. Oh, wait, right, so the initial state is 2.0 mol CO₂ at 10 atm and 25 C.

Wait, but wait, the initial pressure is 10 atm, volume is calculated by PV = nRT. Let me compute that. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) or 8.314 J/(mol·K). Wait, but since pressure is in atm and volume in liters, better to use R in those units.

So initial volume V_initial = nRT/(P). n=2.0, R=0.0821, T=298.15 K, P=10 atm.

V_initial = (2.0 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 298.15 K) / 10 atm.

Let me compute that:

2 * 0.0821 = 0.1642. Multiply by 298.15: 0.1642 * 298.15 ≈ 49.0. So 49.0 L·atm /10 atm = 4.9 L. So V_initial is 4.9 liters.

Wait, but the piston moves outward by 20 cm. So the displacement is 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. Area is 10 cm² = 0.001 m². So the volume change is 0.001 m² * 0.2 m = 0.0002 m³. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Wait, 10 cm² is 0.001 m² (since 1 m² is 100 cm x 100 cm = 1e4 cm², so 1 cm² is 1e-4 m². So 10 cm² is 10e-4 = 0.001 m². Yes. So 0.001 m² * 0.2 m = 0.0002 m³. Oh wait, wait, 0.001 * 0.2 is 0.0002 m³? Because 1 m³ is 1000 liters. No, wait, 1 m³ is 1000 L. So converting m³ to liters: 0.0002 m³ = 0.2 L.

Wait, wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Volume is in m³. So, displacement of 20 cm is 0.2 m. The area is 10 cm² = 10e-4 m². So each cm² is 1e-4 m², yes. So 0.2 m * 10e-4 m² = 0.002 m³? Wait no, 10e-4 * 0.2 is 0.002 m³? Because 10e-4 * 0.2 = 0.002. But wait, 10 cm² is 0.001 m², so (0.001 m²) * (0.2 m) = 0.0002 m³. Oh wait, 0.2 * 0.001 is 0.0002 m³. Because 0.001 m² is 10 cm², right. So displacement is 0.0002 m³.

So the change in volume is ΔV = 0.0002 m³. But wait, since the piston is expanding, the volume increases. So if initial V is 4.9 L, then the final V is 4.9 L + 0.0002 m³. Wait, but I should convert 0.0002 m³ to liters. 1 m³ is 1000 L, so 0.0002 m³ is 0.2 L. So ΔV = 0.2 L.

But wait, wait, the initial volume is 4.9 L, so initial V is 4.9 L, final V is 5.1 L? Because 4.9 + 0.2 is 5.1 L. Oh, wait no: wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. The displacement is 20 cm. The area is 10 cm². So the volume change is 10 cm² * 20 cm = 200 cm³. Oh because 10 cm² * (20 cm) = 200 cm³. Which is 0.2 L (since 1 L = 1000 cm³). So the volume increases by 0.2 L. So initial V is 4.9 L, final V is 5.1 L.

Wait, but wait, initial pressure is 10 atm, and the expansion is against 1 atm. So the work done is W = P_ext * ΔV. So P is 1 atm, ΔV is 0.2 L. Since 1 atm * 1 L = 101.325 J (approx). So W = 1 atm * 0.2 L = 0.2 L·atm. To convert that to Joules, multiply by 101.325 J/(L·atm). So 0.2 * 101.325 ≈ 20.265 J. So W ≈ 20.27 J.

But wait, wait, because the system is expanding, the work done by the system is positive. So since ΔU = -W, then ΔU would be about -20 J, because W is positive.

Wait, but wait, the initial and final volumes are when the gas is expanding. So the work done is positive, so the internal energy decreases. So the change in internal energy (ΔU) is negative. So, the options have negative numbers. Let me look at the options. Option F is -20 J, which seems correct then.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the work. Let me double-check. Work done against a pressure is P_ext * ΔV. But wait, wait: the formula is W = P_ext * ΔV, but when the system expands, P_ext is less than P (since it's pushing against atmospheric pressure?), but wait, in an expansion against a constant external pressure, the work done is W = P_ext * ΔV, regardless of the internal pressure.

Wait, but in this case, the external pressure is 1 atm, and the internal pressure is the gas pressure, which at the initial state is 10 atm. So the gas is expanding against 1 atm. So the work is P_ext (1 atm) multiplied by the change in volume (ΔV = 0.2 L).

So W = 1 atm * 0.2 L = 0.2 L·atm. Converting to J: 0.2 * 101.325 ≈ 20.265 J. So W ≈ 20.27 J.

Wait, but wait, the system is expanding, so the work done is positive. So ΔU = -W = -20.27 J. So the ΔU is approximately -20 J, which matches option F.

But wait, the problem says it's an adiabatic process. Oh right, because the system is adiabatic, Q=0. So the first law is ΔU = Q - W. But Q=0, so ΔU = -W. So yeah, that's what I did.

Wait, but another thought: in an adiabatic process, the internal energy change is equal to the negative of the work done. So ΔU = -W.

Wait, but wait. The work done by the system is positive when the system expands. So W is positive, so ΔU is negative.

So our calculation gives ΔU ≈ -20 J, which is option F.

But looking at the options, option F is -20 J, option H is -70 J, etc.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because I remember that in some cases, especially with ideal gases, the work done in an expansion is P_ext * ΔV, regardless of the internal pressure. So that should be correct.

Another point: the formula for work done when the external pressure is constant. So yes, W = P_ext * (V_final - V_initial) = P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, but wait, the units. I used 0.2 L, but the R units matter. Oh, no, because I converted everything to L·atm earlier. But let's double-check the calculation.

n = 2.0 mol, R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T=298.15 K. Initial pressure P_initial = 10 atm, V_initial = nRT/P_initial = (2 * 0.0821 * 298.15)/10 = (49.01)/10 = 4.901 L.

Final volume: 0.001 m² * 0.2 m = 0.0002 m³ = 0.2 L. So V_final = 4.901 + 0.2 = 5.101 L.

ΔV = 0.2 L. So W = P_ext * ΔV = 1 atm * 0.2 L = 0.2 L·atm. 0.2 * 101.325 ≈ 20.265 J.

So ΔU = -W = -20.265 J. So the correct answer is F: -20 J.

Wait, but the options don't have 20.26 J. Oh, I see, perhaps the approximation was done. So option F is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation. Let me compute W again.

P_ext is 1 atm, ΔV is 0.2 L. So W = 1 atm * 0.2 L = 0.2 L·atm. Now, 1 L·atm = 101.325 J. So 0.2 * 101.325 = 20.265 J. So ΔU is -20.265 J. The closest option is F: -20 J.

But wait, looking at the options, F is -20 J. So that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the adiabatic expansion of 2.0 mol of CO₂ gas. Since the process is adiabatic (Q = 0), the first law of thermodynamics simplifies to:

\[
\Delta U = -W
\]

where \( W \) is the work done by the system. The work done during an expansion against a constant external pressure is given by:

\[
W = P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V
\]

### Key Calculations:
1. **Initial Volume (\( V_{\text{initial}} \)):**
   Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), the initial volume is:
   \[
   V_{\text{initial}} = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{(2.0 \, \text{mol})(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K})(298.15 \, \text{K})}{10 \, \text{atm}} \approx 4.9 \, \text{L}
   \]

2. **Change in Volume (\( \Delta V \)):**
   The piston moves outward by 20 cm, and the cross-sectional area is \( 10.0 \, \text{cm}^2 = 0.001 \, \text{m}^2 \). The volume change is:
   \[
   \Delta V = \text{Area} \cdot \text{Displacement} = (0.001 \, \text{m}^2)(0.2 \, \text{m}) = 0.0002 \, \text{m}^3 = 0.2 \, \text{L}
   \]

3. **Work Done (\( W \)):**
   The external pressure is \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1.0 \, \text{atm} \), and the work done is:
   \[
   W = P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V = (1.0 \, \text{atm}) \cdot (0.2 \, \text{L}) = 0.2 \, \text{L·atm}
   \]
   Converting to joules:
   \[
   1 \, \text{L·atm} = 101.325 \, \text{J}, \quad \text{so} \quad W = 0.2 \cdot 101.325 \approx 20.27 \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Change in Internal Energy (\( \Delta U \)):**
   Since \( Q = 0 \), the first law simplifies to:
   \[
   \Delta U = -W = -20.27 \, \text{J}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated value of \( \Delta U \) is approximately \( -20 \, \text{J} \), which matches option F.
