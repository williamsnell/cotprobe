Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the average total energy of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, I remember that for a single particle in a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. Oh wait, but in the context of thermal physics, we usually consider the average energy. Oh right, the equipartition theorem! That should apply here because the oscillator is in thermal contact with a reservoir, so it's in thermal equilibrium.

The equipartition theorem states that each quadratic degree of freedom contributes (1/2) kT to the average energy. Wait, but wait—quadratic in what variables? Oh, right, it's about the energy degrees of freedom. For a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, each spatial degree of freedom (x, y, z) contributes (1/2)kT. So for three dimensions, that's 3*(1/2)kT, which is (3/2)kT. Oh, but wait—I'm a bit confused because I thought harmonic oscillators in 3D relate to each dimension having energy (1/2)kT each. So adding them up.

Wait, but isn't each direction (x, y, z) contributing (1/2)kT each? So total energy would be 3*(1/2)kT = (3/2)kT. So the average energy would be (3/2)kT. Let me look at the options. There's an option H which is (3/2)kT. So that's one of the choices.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused with the 2D vs 3D. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, because each dimension is a quadratic degree of freedom, so yeah. So three dimensions would sum the energies.

Wait another thought—could the system be a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator as in a particle moving in x, y, z directions, each with their own oscillator. Then each direction contributes (1/2)kT. So for all three, 3*(1/2) = 3/2 kT.

So the average energy is (3/2)kT, which is option H.

Looking at the options, option H is (3/2)kT. So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the average total energy of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature \( T \), we apply the equipartition theorem. The theorem states that each quadratic degree of freedom contributes \( \frac{1}{2}kT \) to the average energy. For a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, there are three quadratic degrees of freedom (one for each spatial dimension: \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \)). Therefore, the total average energy is:

\[
\text{Average energy} = 3 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = \frac{3}{2}kT
\]

From the given options, the correct choice is \( \frac{3}{2}kT \), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
