Question:

Brood parasites such as the cuckoo successfully trick other species of birds into rearing their young by exploiting the host birds' instinctive response to the loud begging cues of a fledgling in their nest. The genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring most likely remain in the gene pool of the population because

Options:

A: the host birds learn from the experience and are less likely to be duped in the future
B: on average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry
C: the cuckoo fledglings share some of their genes with the host birds
D: the cuckoo fledglings contribute to the survival of the host bird species by increasing genetic diversity
E: the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species
F: the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced
G: on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own
H: the cuckoo fledglings help to protect the nest from predators
I: the genes that allow the host birds to be duped are necessary for the survival of the cuckoo species

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about brood parasites like cuckoo birds. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about why the genes that allow host birds to be duped into rearing cuckoo fledglings remain in the gene pool. The options are A to H.

Hmm, I remember that genes that confer a survival advantage are more likely to be passed on. So if the host bird species loses efficiency in their offspring, those genes might not get passed on because the birds aren't as good at reproducing anymore.

Option A says the host birds learn from their experience and are less likely to be duped. That sounds like they're improving their own survival, so their genes would stick. But I'm not sure if the question is about learning or about the genes being passed on.

Option B talks about the response allowing them to rear efficiently by feeding hungry birds. The cuckoo is tricking the host, so maybe the host's response is more about their own survival, not about being able to rear more. Not sure.

Option C says the cuckoo fledglings share genes with the host. If the host is being duped, the cuckoo might carry their genes, but does that mean the host's genes are lost? Or are the host's genes just not being passed on because it's a bad strategy?

Option D suggests the cuckoo's genes help the host's survival by increasing diversity. But the question is about why the genes remain in the host's gene pool. If the genes are being used for the cuckoo, that might mean the host's genes aren't being passed on. So maybe D is not correct.

Option E says the maximum fitness of the cuckoo isn't compromised. But I think the point is that the host's genes aren't passed on, so their own genes are lost. So E might not be the right answer.

Option F claims the cuckoo's fitness would be reduced. That's opposite of what I thinkâ€”maybe the host's genes aren't useful anymore, so their own genes don't make it.

Option G says little energy spent rearing. If the host isn't doing it well, maybe they don't contribute to future reproduction. But that doesn't directly explain why the host's genes are kept. It's more about their own survival.

Option H: the genes are necessary for the cuckoo's survival. So without the host's genes, the cuckoo can't rear their own. That makes sense because if the host isn't rearing their own, they may not survive.

Option I: the genes are necessary for the cuckoo's survival. So the genes are part of the host's strategy, but do they stick? Or do the host's genes get lost?

Wait, the question is about why the host's genes remain. If the host is being duped, then their own genes are probably lost because they're not being used effectively. So the genes that allowed them to rear the cuckoo are not being passed on, making the host's genes less likely to be passed on in the future. So the genes are necessary for the cuckoo's survival, but they get lost.

Looking back at the options, option I says "the genes that allow the host birds to be duped are necessary for the survival of the cuckoo species." So if the host is being duped, their genes are needed for the cuckoo's survival, but they're not passed on to future generations. So I think the genes are necessary for the cuckoo's survival, but they're not passed on to the host's gene pool. So which option is correct.

Wait, the question is asking why the host's genes remain. The host's genes are no longer effective because they're used by the cuckoo. So the genes that allowed the host to rear the cuckoo are not passed on because the host isn't being used as efficiently. Thus, the genes are needed for the cuckoo's survival, but they are not passed on.

Wait, but the options are about why the host's genes are retained. So which statement explains that.

Option I says the genes are necessary for the cuckoo's survival. But the question is why the host's genes remain. So perhaps the answer is that the genes are necessary for the cuckoo's survival, but don't get passed on. So the genes remain because they're needed for the cuckoo's own survival, not for the host's.

Alternatively, option I might be the correct answer. Because the genes are necessary for the cuckoo to survive, but the host's genes are not passed on.

Wait, let's think again. The question is about the genes that allow the host to be duped. Those genes are used by the cuckoo. So the genes are necessary for the cuckoo to have a successful strategy, but the host's genes are not getting passed on because the cuckoo is causing the host to not be effective.

Therefore, the genes that are needed for the cuckoo's survival (option I) are necessary for the host's survival, but the host's genes are not passed on. So the genes that allow the host to be duped are necessary for the cuckoo's survival. Therefore, the genes are needed for the cuckoo's survival, but they're not passed on to the host.

So I think the correct answer is I. The genes are necessary for the cuckoo's survival, but the host's genes are not passed on.

The question asks why the genes that allow host birds to be duped into rearing cuckoo fledglings remain in the host's gene pool. The correct explanation must focus on the necessity of these genes for the cuckoo's survival and their potential loss from the host's gene pool.

- **Option A** suggests the host learns from the experience, which implies improved survival and thus retained genes. However, the question focuses on the loss of host genes due to the cuckoo strategy, not learning.
- **Option B** links the host's response to efficient rearning to their own survival, but the question is about why the host's genes remain, not about their effectiveness.
- **Option C** posits that cuckoo genes share with host genes, which would mean host genes are lost. This is unlikely because the question emphasizes the necessity of host genes for the cuckoo's survival.
- **Option D** claims cuckoo genes help host survival by increasing diversity, but this does not explain why host genes remain.
- **Option E** suggests cuckoo fitness is not compromised, which contradicts the idea that host genes are lost.
- **Option F** states cuckoo fitness would be reduced, which is the opposite of the scenario.
- **Option G** mentions little energy spent rearing, which focuses on the energy aspect but does not explain gene retention.
- **Option H** states cuckoo genes are necessary for their survival, which aligns with the necessity of these genes but does not directly address why host genes remain.
- **Option I** states these genes are necessary for the cuckoo's survival, which explains why the host's genes are retained, as the host's genes are not effective and thus their loss would harm the host's survival.

The most accurate explanation is **Option I**, as the genes necessary for the cuckoo's survival are required for the host's survival, but the host's genes are not passed on.
