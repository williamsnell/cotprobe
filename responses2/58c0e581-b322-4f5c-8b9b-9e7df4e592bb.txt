Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about simple harmonic motion. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question says that six simple harmonic motions with the same amplitude and period are superimposed along the same straight line. The phase difference between each successive pair is the same. We need to find a phase difference where the resultant amplitude is zero. The options are all in degrees, so I'll have to work in degrees.

Wait, I remember that when you superimpose multiple SHMs with the same amplitude and period, their resultant amplitude depends on the phase differences between them. Oh right, this setup is like adding vectors in the same direction because they're along the same line.

So, if there are six SHMs with phase differences between each, each successive one is phase-differing by some angle. Let me call the phase difference between each as 'φ'. But wait, the problem says the phase difference between each successive pair is the same. So between the first and second is φ, second and third is φ, and so on.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If there are six SHMs, each successive pair has a phase difference of φ. So the first SHM is at phase 0, the second is at phase +φ, the third at +2φ, and so on until the sixth, which is +5φ. Because the sixth is the last one, so the phase difference from the first to the sixth is 5φ. 

But wait, when you superimpose multiple SHMs, the resultant amplitude is the square root of the sum of squares of individual amplitudes plus some cross terms. Or wait, no, because all are in the same direction. So actually, each SHM contributes a certain amplitude, and the phase differences determine their vector addition.

Wait, but since they're all along the same line, it's like adding phasors with the same amplitude, varying phase. So the total resultant amplitude would be the magnitude of the vector sum of these phasors.

The formula for the resultant amplitude when there are n SHMs with phase differences of φ between each is given by R = A * sqrt(n^2 + (n(n-1)φ)^2) )? Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, the formula for the amplitude when adding n SHMs with phase differences φ between each is A * sqrt( (n^2) + ( (n(n-1)φ) )^2 ) divided by something. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula for the amplitude of the resultant when n SHMs are superimposed with a phase difference of φ between each is A * sqrt( n^2 + (n(n-1)φ)^2 ) ) / something else. No, wait, I think the correct formula is A multiplied by the square root of [1 + (n-1)^2 (φ)^2 ]? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the resultant amplitude R is given by R = A * sqrt( 1 + ( (n-1)φ )^2 ). Because each successive SHM is phase-shifted by φ from the previous. Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe I should model it mathematically.

Let me model each SHM as a sine or cosine function. Let's say the first SHM is x1(t) = A sin(ωt). The second is x2(t) = A sin(ωt + φ). The third is x3(t) = A sin(ωt + 2φ), and so on until x6(t) = A sin(ωt +5φ).

The resultant displacement is the sum of all these: x(t) = sum_{k=0}^{5} A sin(ωt + kφ). Wait, perhaps another approach: since all SHMs are in the same direction, the resultant amplitude is the sum of their amplitudes in phase. But wait, that's only true if all SHMs are in phase, which they aren't because of the phase differences. So it's not as simple as adding their amplitudes.

Alternatively, thinking of each SHM as a vector in phase space. Each vector has a magnitude of A and a phase shift of kφ, where k is 0,1,2,3,4,5 for the six SHMs.

Because they're all along the same line, the resultant amplitude is the vector sum of their phasors. The vector sum of six vectors each of length A, with angles 0, φ, 2φ, 3φ, 4φ, 5φ.

The resultant amplitude R is given by the magnitude of this vector sum.

So, to find R, we can compute the magnitude:

R = sqrt( (A)^2 + (A)^2 + (A)^2 + ... + (A)^2 ) + ... + cross terms.

But wait, for vectors, the sum is the sum of each component. Since all are in the same direction, the resultant amplitude would be the square root of the sum of the squares of each vector's contribution, plus twice the sum of the products of each pair, but that's only if they are at 0 phase difference. Wait, no, that approach isn't correct because each phase difference affects the vector sum.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the sum of the sine functions with phase differences.

The sum of sinusoids with the same frequency can be written as a single sinusoid with a phase shift and amplitude. But in this case, each SHM has a phase shift, so it's a sum of six sine functions with phases 0, φ, 2φ, up to 5φ.

Wait, perhaps this can be modeled as a phasor addition. Each SHM is a vector in the complex plane. The sum of these vectors gives the resultant vector.

Each vector has a magnitude A and a phase angle of 0, φ, 2φ, 3φ, 4φ, 5φ, respectively.

The sum of these vectors is the vector sum of all six, so the resultant vector's magnitude is R.

So, the problem reduces to finding when this resultant vector has a magnitude of zero.

So, sum_{k=0}^5 A e^{i k φ} = 0.

Wait, because each SHM can be represented as a complex number A e^{iθ}, where θ is the phase.

So, the sum of these six complex exponentials equals zero.

Let me write this sum as:

A [ e^{i0} + e^{iφ} + e^{i2φ} + e^{i3φ} + e^{i4φ} + e^{i5φ} ] = 0.

Since A is non-zero, the sum of the exponentials must be zero.

So, the sum S = e^{i0} + e^{iφ} + e^{i2φ} + e^{i3φ} + e^{i4φ} + e^{i5φ} = 0.

Hmm, this is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is S = (1 - r^n)/(1 - r), where r is the common ratio.

In this case, r = e^{iφ}, and n=6.

So S = (1 - e^{i6φ}) / (1 - e^{iφ}).

We want this sum to be zero, so numerator must be zero.

So, 1 - e^{i6φ} = 0 → e^{i6φ} = 1.

Which happens when 6φ is a multiple of 2π radians, or 360 degrees.

So, 6φ = 2π k, where k is integer.

Which implies φ = (2π k)/6 = π k/3 radians.

But since we're dealing with degrees, let's convert: (π radians) = 180 degrees.

So, φ = (180 k / 3) degrees = 60 k degrees.

But since phase differences are modulo 360, we can have k=0,1,2,...,5.

Wait, but when k=0, φ=0, which would mean all SHMs are in phase. So the sum is 6A, which is non-zero. So we need non-zero k.

Wait, wait, let me think again. Because when k=0, 6φ=0 → φ=0, which is not a valid case because then all SHMs are in phase, which isn't the case here. So the condition is 6φ = 2π k, but with k=1,2,3,4,5,6? No, because 6φ = 2π k → φ = (π k)/3. But wait, when k=3, 6φ=6π → φ=π → 180 degrees.

Wait, but if φ is 180 degrees, then each SHM is out of phase by 180 degrees from the next. So the sum might cancel out.

Wait, let me compute this. Let's plug in φ=60 degrees, which is  π/3 radians. Then 6φ= 6*(π/3)=2π → e^{i6φ} =1. So the sum S would be (1 - 1)/(1 - e^{iπ/3}) )= 0.

But wait, the condition is that S =0.

Wait, but when k=1, 6φ =2π *1 → φ= (2π)/6 = π/3 → 60 degrees.

Wait, but wait, when φ=60 degrees, the sum S would be:

e^{i0} + e^{i60} + e^{i120} + e^{i180} + e^{i240} + e^{i300}.

Wait, let me compute each term:

e^{i0} = 1.

e^{i60} = cos60 + i sin60 = 0.5 + i (sqrt(3)/2)

e^{i120} = cos120 + i sin120 = (-0.5) + i (sqrt(3)/2)

e^{i180} = cos180 + i sin180 = -1 + i 0 = -1.

e^{i240} = cos240 + i sin240 = (-0.5) - i (sqrt(3)/2)

e^{i300} = cos300 + i sin300 = 0.5 - i (sqrt(3)/2)

So adding them all up:

1 + (0.5 + i√3/2) + (-0.5 + i√3/2) + (-1) + (-0.5 - i√3/2) + (0.5 - i√3/2 )

Let me compute the real parts:

1 + 0.5 -0.5 -1 -0.5 +0.5

= [1 -1] + [0.5 -0.5] + [-0.5 +0.5] = 0 + 0 +0 = 0.

The imaginary parts: sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2.

= [ (sqrt(3)/2 *4) ) ] → Wait, let me calculate each term:

0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2) + (-sqrt(3)/2) + 0 (from -1) + (-sqrt(3)/2) + (-sqrt(3)/2)

Wait, sum of imaginary parts:

( sqrt(3)/2 ) + (-sqrt(3)/2) = 0.

Then, the other terms:

0.5 [from first term] + (-1)[from third term] is 0.5 -1 = -0.5.

Wait, no, let me list all the imaginary terms:

From e^{i60}: +sqrt(3)/2 i.

From e^{i120}: +sqrt(3)/2 i.

From e^{i240}: -sqrt(3)/2 i.

From e^{i300}: -sqrt(3)/2 i.

So adding:

sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3).

Then, minus sqrt(3)/2 + (-sqrt(3)/2) = -sqrt(3).

So total imaginary sum: sqrt(3) - sqrt(3) = 0.

So yes, the sum is zero. So when φ=60 degrees, the resultant amplitude is zero.

Wait, but let me check for another possible value. What about when φ= 180 degrees? Let's see:

If φ=180 degrees, which is π radians.

6φ=6 * 180 = 1080 degrees. 1080 mod 360 is 0 degrees (since 3*360=1080). So 6φ=0 mod 360, which is the same as 6φ=0.

So the sum S would be (1 - e^{i0}) / (1 - e^{i180} ) → (1 - 1) / (1 - (-1)) → 0 / 2 =0. So yes, sum is zero. So φ=180 degrees is another solution.

Wait, but the options include 60 degrees, 90, 75, etc. So the problem is asking for one value where the resultant amplitude is zero.

So from the analysis, when φ=60 degrees, the sum of the vectors is zero, so the resultant amplitude is zero.

So looking at the options, option B is 90, E is 150, D is 180, etc.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait, let's think again. Wait, I've concluded that when φ=60 degrees, the sum is zero. So that would be option B (90 degrees) no, wait, option B is 90. No, the options are:

A: 120, B:90, C:75, D:180, E:210, F:60, G:45, H:30, I:135, J:150.

Ah, so option F is 60 degrees, which is what I found. So that's the correct answer. So the resultant amplitude is zero when φ is 60 degrees. So the correct option is F.
</think>

To solve the problem, we consider six simple harmonic motions (SHMs) with the same amplitude \( A \) and period, acting along the same straight line. The phase difference between each successive pair is \( \phi \). The goal is to find a value of \( \phi \) for which the resultant amplitude is zero.

Each SHM can be represented as a complex number of the form \( A e^{i k \phi} \), where \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \). The resultant amplitude is the magnitude of the sum of these complex numbers:

\[
R = A \left| \sum_{k=0}^{5} e^{i k \phi} \right|.
\]

The sum of the vectors \( e^{i k \phi} \) is a geometric series with the common ratio \( r = e^{i \phi} \) and \( n = 6 \). The sum of this series is:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{5} e^{i k \phi} = \frac{1 - e^{i 6 \phi}}{1 - e^{i \phi}}.
\]

For the resultant amplitude to be zero, the numerator must be zero:

\[
1 - e^{i 6 \phi} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad e^{i 6 \phi} = 1.
\]

This condition is satisfied when \( 6 \phi \) is a multiple of \( 2\pi \) radians (or \( 360^\circ \)):

\[
6 \phi = 2\pi k \quad \Rightarrow \quad \phi = \frac{\pi k}{3} \, \text{radians} \, (60^\circ k \, \text{degrees}),
\]

where \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \). Since \( \phi \) must be non-zero, we exclude \( k = 0 \), which corresponds to \( \phi = 0 \) (all SHMs in phase, which is not valid here).

### Checking the options:
- **Option F (60°):** When \( \phi = 60^\circ \), \( 6 \phi = 360^\circ \), so \( e^{i 6 \phi} = 1 \), and the sum of the vectors is zero. This satisfies the condition.
- **Other options:** For example, \( \phi = 90^\circ \) (Option B) gives \( 6 \phi = 540^\circ \), which is not a multiple of \( 360^\circ \), so the sum is not zero. Similarly, \( \phi = 180^\circ \) (Option D) gives \( 6 \phi = 1080^\circ \), which is a multiple of \( 360^\circ \), so the sum is zero. However, the question asks for one value, and \( 60^\circ \) is the smallest such value.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: F**
