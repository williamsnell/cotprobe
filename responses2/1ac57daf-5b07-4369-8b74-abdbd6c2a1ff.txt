Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Abe finding the mean and median of a list of numbers and then adding a new number. Let's break it down step by step.

The initial list is [1, 3, 3]. Abe found the mean and median of this list. Then, if we add the number 6 to this list, I need to figure out how the mean and median change.

First, let's compute the initial mean and median.

The initial list has three numbers: 1, 3, 3.

The median is the middle number when they are ordered, which here is 3. Because there are three numbers, the second one is the median.

The mean is the average. So (1 + 3 + 3) divided by 3. That's (7) / 3 â‰ˆ 2.333.

Now, the question says we add the number 6 to the list. So the new list will have four numbers: 1, 3, 3, 6.

Let me compute the new median. Since there are four numbers, the median will be the average of the second and third numbers. So (3 + 3)/2 = 3. So the median remains the same (still 3).

Now, what about the mean? Adding 6 to the sum: the new total is 7 + 6 = 13. The number of elements is now 4. So the new mean is 13 /4 = 3.25.

So the mean went up from approximately 2.333 to 3.25, which is an increase. The median stayed the same at 3.

Looking at the options, option D says the mean would increase, and the median would stay the same. Option E is about both increasing, which isn't the case here. Option A says the median increases, which isn't true because it stays the same. Option B says the median stays the same, which is correct. For the mean, it's increasing.

So the correct option is D: the mean would increase, and the median would stay the same.

The initial list is [1, 3, 3]. The median is 3, and the mean is approximately 2.333. Adding 6 increases the sum to 13 and the count to 4, making the new mean 3.25. The new median is the average of the second and third numbers, which remains 3. 

Thus, the mean increases, and the median stays the same. The correct answer is D: the mean would increase, and the median would stay the same.

Answer: D
