Okay, so I've got this question about foreign currency gains and translations for a corporation. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So the question is about Mentor Co., a U.S. corporation. They own 100% of a Swiss corporation, and the Swiss franc is their functional currency. At year end, they remeasured their financial statements and noticed two gains: a $25,000 gain in remeasurement and a $40,000 gain from translating their financial statements. The question is asking what amount Mentor should recognize as foreign currency gain in their income statement.

Wait, I remember there are two main aspects to consider here. First, the remeasurement gain, which is when the currency changes in value because of fluctuations in the exchange rate. Second, the translation gain, which is the gain or loss when converting the foreign currency to U.S. dollars. But the foreign currency gain is only recognized when the currency is settled, right?

So the remeasurement gain is a gain in the foreign currency, but it's not yet settled with the Swiss company. That means it's not considered a foreign currency gain recognized in the U.S. income statement. It's more of a gain that's not settled yet. So only the translation gain would be recognized because that's when the exchange rate is fixed.

Wait, but wait. I think when you remeasure, you actually get a foreign currency gain only if the exchange rate has changed. But in this case, the question says the remeasurement resulted in a $25k gain. But in terms of accounting, the remeasurement gain is an unrealized gain because it hasn't been settled. Similarly, the translation gain is realized because it's settled.

So Mentor should only recognize the translation gain in their income statement. Because the remeasurement gain is unrealized. So $40,000 would be the amount to recognize as foreign currency gain.

Looking at the options:

A: $30k — Doesn't make sense
B: $50k — No, that's higher than the translation gain
C: $65k — That's the sum of both, but that's probably incorrect
D: $15k — Lower than the translation gain
E: $35k — Not matching
F: $65,000 — That's same as the sum, but again, that's the total of both gains, not the recognized one.
G: $40k — That's the translation gain, so correct.
H: $25k — That's the remeasurement gain, but that's not recognized because it's unrealized
I: $45k — Doesn't match
J: $0 — No, because the translation gain is a gain, not zero.

Wait wait wait, the translation gain is a gain recognized. So the correct answer is G: $40,000.

Mentor Co., a U.S. corporation, owns 100% of a Swiss corporation with the Swiss franc as the functional currency. At year end, remeasurement resulted in a $25,000 gain, but this is unrealized because it hasn't been settled. The translation gain of $40,000 is realized and should be recognized in the U.S. income statement. The remeasurement gain is not recognized as a foreign currency gain because it is unrealized. 

Answer: G: $40,000
