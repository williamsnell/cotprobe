Question:

Bob Wilson borrowed $20,000 from Ted Lamar to open a hardware store. Ted's only interest in the business was the repayment of his 5-year unsecured loan. Bob was so grateful for the loan that he named his business "Wilson and Lamar Hardware" and purchased signs and advertising displaying this name. He also listed Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as "partners" on his stationery. When Ted found out, he was flattered to the point that he voluntarily reduced Bob's interest rate from 9 percent to 8 percent per annum. A few weeks later, Pete Smith, who had assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and was not familiar with the true situation, sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Pete Smith has been unable to collect for the goods and he seeks your advice. Your advice to Pete is

Options:

A: The Wilson and Lamar Hardware business entity is solely liable.
B: Neither Bob Wilson nor Ted Lamar is liable.
C: Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.
D: Bob Wilson is liable up to the amount of the initial loan, and Ted Lamar is liable for the remainder.
E: Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.
F: Ted Lamar is solely liable.
G: Only the de jure partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about partnership liability. Let's try to break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is Bob Wilson borrowed $20,000 from Ted Lamar. Ted is only interested in repaying his 5-year loan, I guess. Bob names his business Wilson and Lamar Hardware and puts up some signs and ads. He also lists Bob and Ted as partners on his stationery. Then, Ted finds out about this business and is flattered. He cuts Bob's interest rate from 9% to 8% per annum. 

Then, Pete Smith comes in, assuming both Wilson and Lamar were operating a hardware store, but he's not familiar with the real situation. Pete wants to sell goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware, but he can't collect. So, Pete is suing and I need to figure out who's liable.

Hmm, so first, let's understand the business setup. Bob and Ted are partners, I assume, because they listed each other on Pete's stationery. But Bob names his business "Wilson and Lamar Hardware." When Ted finds out, he's reducing the interest rate. Wait, does that affect who is liable?

In a partnership, there are a few key things to consider: whether it's a de facto or de jure partnership. A de facto partnership occurs when one partner is personally liable, while the others are only liable as partners. A de Jure partnership is when all partners are liable.

In the case of a business formed by two individuals (like a partnership), the general rule is that the partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the business. But that's only if it's a de Jure partnership. 

Wait, but in this case, when Ted finds out about the business, he's reducing Bob's interest rate. Does that affect the partnership status? I'm a bit fuzzy on this part. If Ted is legally bound to reduce the interest rate, perhaps he's still a member of the partnership. Or maybe he's not a member anymore because he's not a partner anymore? That could change the liability structure.

But wait, let's look at the options. The options are about individual liability, partners, etc.

Option A: The Wilson and Lamar Hardware business entity is solely liable. That would mean that the partnership itself is responsible for the debts. But under UCC rules, I think that's not the case because the partnership would generally be a separate entity. So, the partnership might not be liable per se; debts would fall under the partners' liability.

Option B: Neither Bob Wilson nor Ted Lamar is liable. That would mean no liability at all. But if Ted is now a member of the partnership, he should still be liable. Maybe not.

Option C: Both are liable jointly. So both own the business and are jointly and severally liable. That sounds like a de Jure partnership. But if Ted is a member, would that make the business a de facto partnership? Or is the matter still a partnership?

Wait, if Ted is a member of the partnership, then the partnership is a de Jure one, so everyone is liable. But if the partnership is formed, and a member changes their interest, perhaps the partnership becomes a de facto one? Or maybe not, because the partnership is formed based on the initial terms. 

Wait, let me think again. The partnership is formed between Bob and Ted. But when Ted discovers the business, he reduces Bob's interest rate. Does that mean Ted is now a member of the partnership, or is he just a business partner that doesn't have personal liability?

Wait, in a partnership, once formed, each member is a member, and liability is generally as a partner. But if one of the partners changes their interest or is removed, that could affect the partnership's relationship. But in this case, Ted seems to still be a member because he's a partner. So perhaps the partnership is still a de Jure one.

Wait, but if Ted is a member, then the partnership is a de Jure one, so all partners are liable. So, when Pete comes in and sells goods, he's selling into the partnership, which is now a de Jure partnership. So, Pete could be partially liable if he's buying goods from the partnership. But the question is, who's liable for the debts?

Wait, the question is about Pete's liability when he sells goods. So, in a business partnership, when a third party sells goods to the business, that third party can be liable if they can collect. But if the partnership is a de Jure one, the partners are all liable for the business debts. So, if the partnership is a de Jure one, then all partners (Bob and Ted) are responsible for any debts from the partnership. So, if Pete is buying goods from the partnership, he's in breach, but the partners are liable.

But wait, the question is about the liability of the partners. Let me think about the partners' liability. If the partnership is a de Jure one, all partners are liable. But if Ted is not a member anymore because he reduced the interest rate, then perhaps the partnership is now a de facto one, and only Ted is liable. But I don't think that's the case because the partnership was formed in Ted's name, and it's a business with both partners involved.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline what I know:

- Bob and Ted formed a partnership.
- Bob named the business, and Ted signed on as a partner.
- Ted is a member, so unless he's removed, the partnership is a de Jure one.
- When Ted discovers the business, he cuts Bob's interest rate.
- The question is about Pete's liability when he sells goods to the partnership.
- So, Pete is a third party selling into the partnership.

In a partnership, the partners are generally liable for the debts of the business. So, if the partnership is a de Jure one, all partners are liable. But if the partnership is a de facto one, only the current members are liable.

In this case, when Ted discovers the business, he's still a member of the partnership, just with a different interest. So, the partnership is a de Jure one, and all partners are liable. Therefore, both Bob and Ted are jointly and severally liable for debts from the partnership.

But wait, the question is about the liability of Bob and Ted. So, if the partnership is a de Jure one, then both are liable. So, the answer would be option C: Both are liable jointly.

But wait, another angle: the business is formed by two individuals, so if one of them changes their interest, does that affect the partnership status? Or does it remain a partnership regardless? I think it's a partnership regardless of the individual changes. Ted is still a member, so the partnership is a de Jure one. Therefore, both are liable.

So, the question is about the liability of the partners. So if the partnership is a de Jure one, the partners are all liable. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Option E says Bob is liable for the entire amount, Ted only to the extent it can't be collected from Bob. That's the de facto scenario. But in this case, since Ted is still a member, it's a de Jure partnership, so option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Another approach: in a partnership, the partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership. So, if Ted is a member, the partnership is a de Jure one, meaning all partners are liable. So, both Bob and Ted are liable for any debts from the partnership.

So, when Pete sells goods, he's into the partnership, but the partnership's debts are now with the partners. So, if Pete is the one selling, he's not directly liable unless he can't collect. But the partners are liable.

Wait, but the question is about the advice to Pete. So, Pete is a third party. So, the partnership is a de Jure one, so both are liable.

So, the correct answer would be option C: Both Bob and Ted are liable jointly.
</think>

The correct answer is **C: Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.**

### Explanation:
- **Business Formation**: Bob and Ted formed a partnership, with Bob naming the business and Ted assuming the role of a partner. This indicates the partnership is in place.
- **Ted's Interest Change**: Ted reduced Bob's interest rate, but this does not alter the partnership status. Ted remains a member of the partnership.
- **Liability Structure**: Under UCC rules, a business partnership formed between two individuals is typically a de Jure partnership. In such a structure, all members are jointly and severally liable for the partnership's debts.
- **Pete's Action**: Pete sold goods into the partnership, but since the partnership is a de Jure one, both Bob and Ted are liable for any debts from the partnership.
- **Options Analysis**: 
  - **A**: Incorrect, as a partnership is a de Jure entity, not solely liable.
  - **B**: Incorrect, as Ted, a member, should be liable.
  - **C**: Correct, as both Bob and Ted are jointly and severally liable.
  - **D** and **E**: Incorrect, as they suggest only one partner is liable, which does not apply to a de Jure partnership.
  - **F**: Incorrect, as a partnership is not solely liable unless it's a de facto one.
  - **G, H, J**: Incorrect, as they imply both partners are independently liable, which is not the case in a de Jure partnership.
