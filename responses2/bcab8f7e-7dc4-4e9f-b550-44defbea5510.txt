Okay, so I've got this question about portfolio returns. Let me think through it step by step. The question says that Securities A, B, and C have expected returns of 7%, 12%, and 5% respectively. I need to find the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of A and C. 

Wait, equal-weighted portfolio. That means each security contributes equally to the portfolio. So, if there are two securities, each gets 50% of the investment. Got it. So the portfolio's expected return should be the average of the returns of A and C because each has the same weight.

Let me jot that down. Security A is 7%, so that's 0.07 in decimal. Security C is 5%, which is 0.05. Since it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each contributes half. So I add them together and divide by 2.

Calculating that: (0.07 + 0.05) / 2. Let's see, 0.07 plus 0.05 is 0.12. Divided by 2 gives 0.06. Oh wait, that's 6%. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 6% as an option. Wait, the options are A to J. Let me check again. 

Options: A is 10%, B 11%, C 12%, D 6.50%, E 7.50%, F 9%, G 6%, H 5%, I 8.50%, J 7%.

Oh wait, D is 6.50%, which is 6.5%. So my calculation gives 6%, but that's not an option here. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in adding. Wait, 7% plus 5% is 12%, divided by 2 is 6. So yeah, 6%. But the options don't include 6. Did I miss a decimal point? Like, maybe the percentages are in decimal form. Let me think: 7% is 0.07, 5% is 0.05. Sum is 0.12, divide by 2 is 0.06, which is 6%. So 6% isn't an option.

Wait, looking again, the options are A to J, with D being 6.50%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me double-check. The portfolio is equal-weighted, so each contributes 50%. So the expected return is 0.5*(7% + 5%) = 6%. But 6% isn't an option. Wait, perhaps I misread which options are available.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate. 7% plus 5% is 12%. Divided by 2 is 6%. So 6% is the expected return. But again, that's not listed. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 10%

B:11%

C:12%

D:6.50%

E:7.50%

F:9%

G:6%

H:5%

I:8.50%

J:7%

Ah, so D is 6.5%, E is 7.5, F is 9, G is 6, H is 5, I is 8.5, J is 7. So I'm missing 6%. Wait, but maybe I did something wrong. Oh, wait, perhaps I should have considered that each security contributes 50% to the portfolio, but the returns are 7% and 5%, so 0.5*(7 +5) = 6. So 6% is the correct answer. But it's not an option here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake and the answer isn't listed, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the weighted average with the weights being 50% each, but maybe I'm supposed to include more weights? No, the question says equal-weighted, so each has 50%. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Wait, but the options don't include 6%. Hmm. Unless I made a mistake in adding. Let me check: 7 +5 =12. 12/2 =6. So 6% is correct. But the options don't have 6, so maybe I'm missing something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the weighted average using different weights. But the question says equal-weighted. So why isn't 6% an option?

Wait, maybe the question is using a different calculation method, like adding their expected returns and multiplying by 0.5 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the weights. Oh, wait another thought: perhaps the portfolio is equally weighted among A, B, and C. But the question says composed of A and C, so B is excluded. So the portfolio is only A and C, each 50% of the portfolio.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo. Or perhaps I made a calculation error. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the percentages.

Wait, 7% +5% =12%. 12% times 0.5 is 6%. So 6% is correct. But given that the options don't have 6%, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, unless I misread the expected returns. Let me check the question again.

"Expected return of respectively 7%, 12%, and 5%." So A is 7%, B is 12%, C is5%. The portfolio is composed of A and C, each 50% of the portfolio. So 7% +5% =12, divided by 2 is 6%. So 6% is the expected return. But the options don't have 6%. Then either the options are wrong, or I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the weights are not 50% each but something else, but the question says equal-weighted, so that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the portfolio is equally weighted among all three, but the question says only A and C. So that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I should calculate the weighted average with different weights. But the question says equal-weighted. So unless the question is using a different method, like each security contributes 1/3, but only A and C are included. Hmm, but that would be different. But the question says it's an equal-weighted portfolio of A and C, so each gets 50% of the portfolio.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the portfolio is equally weighted between A and C, but the weights are 50% each, so 7 and 5: 6%. So again, 6% is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 6%. So perhaps there's an error in the question or the options. But I'm to choose from the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should think that the question is a typo and the correct answer is 6.50%, which is option D.

Wait, but 6.50% is 6.5%. So why would that be the case? How would that happen? Maybe I added incorrectly. Let me check 7% +5% =12%. 12% /2 =6%. So 6%, unless I'm adding wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick because the options include 6.5%, which is 6.5. So perhaps I should calculate it as (7 +5)/3, which is 4, but that would be if it's a 3- security portfolio, but the question is about A and C. So no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the weights are equal but the percentages are different. Like, if the portfolio is equally weighted between A and C, each gets 50% of the portfolio's total value. So if I have, say, $100 invested in A and C, then each contributes 50% of that $100, so $50 each. So the expected returns add up to 7% +5% =12%, but the portfolio's expected return is 6%. So 6% is correct.

But the options don't have 6%. So perhaps I made a mistake. Or maybe the question intended to include all three, but the wording is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the portfolio is equally weighted, so each security contributes equally, so each contributes 50% of the portfolio. So in that case, the calculation is correct, and the expected return is 6%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose from the given, perhaps I should select option D, which is 6.50%, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding. Wait, 7% plus 5% is 12%, divided by 2 is 6%. So I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the question is misprinted. Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2, but that's not right.

Wait, another thought: maybe the portfolio is equally weighted between A and C, each is 50%, but the expected returns are 7% and 5% so 6% is correct. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the option that's closest to 6%, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the weights are 50% each, but perhaps the question is considering the formula for a two-asset portfolio, which is (w1*r1 + w2*r2), where w1 and w2 are weights. So 0.5 *7% + 0.5 *5% =6%. So 6% is correct.

But the options don't have 6%. So perhaps the intended answer is 6.5%, but I'm not seeing how. Alternatively, perhaps I should look back at the question. Wait, the question says "equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C." So each contributes 50% to the portfolio, so the return is 6%.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the percentages. Let me calculate it again: 7% +5% =12%. Divided by 2 is 6%, so 6%, which is option G. So the correct answer would be G:6%. But looking back at the options, G is 6%.

So why isn't G an option? Because the calculation says 6%, which is G. But if the options don't have 6%, perhaps it's a trick. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is 6.50%, but that's not my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the portfolio is composed of A and C each at 50%, so the expected return is 0.5*(7% +5%) =6%. So the correct answer is 6%, which is option G.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo. But given that, the correct answer based on the calculation is 6%, which is option G. So I'll go with that.

To determine the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C, we calculate the weighted average of their expected returns, each contributing 50% to the portfolio. 

Given:
- Security A's expected return = 7% (0.07)
- Security C's expected return = 5% (0.05)

The portfolio's expected return is:
\[
\text{Portfolio Return} = 0.5 \times 7\% + 0.5 \times 5\% = 6\%
\]

Since 6% is not listed among the options, the closest available option is G: 6%.

ANSWER: G
