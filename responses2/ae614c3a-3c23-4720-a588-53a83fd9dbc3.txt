Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the question says that the intensity of solar radiation at Earth's mean distance from the Sun is 1.35 × 10^3 J·m⁻²·sec⁻¹. Then, if radiation were all at one wavelength, what would be the amplitude of the electromagnetic waves? The options are A to D, each with different values for electric and magnetic field amplitudes.

Hmm. Wait, I remember that the intensity (I) of electromagnetic radiation is related to the power per unit area. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas. Let me think.

Oh right, the power per unit area (intensity) can be expressed in terms of the electric field amplitude. The general formula I think is I = (1/2) c ε0 E_max², where c is the speed of light, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and E_max is the amplitude of the electric field.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another formula I've come across is that the intensity is also related to the Poynting vector, which for electromagnetic waves is S = (1/(2μ0)) E × B. And since E and B are in phase and perpendicular, their magnitudes are such that E = cB. So substituting, S = (1/(2μ0)) E * (E/c) ) = E²/(2 μ0 c). Alternatively, since μ0 * ε0 = 1/c², substituting that in would yield S = (E² c) / (2 μ0 c^2) )? Wait, I might be getting mixed up here. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, I'll look up the exact formula. Oh wait, no, I'm supposed to be thinking this through. Let's recall that for electromagnetic radiation, the intensity can be expressed as I = (ε0 c E_max²) / 2. Or maybe I = (E_max²) / (2μ0 c). Let me think.

Wait, let's get the right formula. The intensity I (power per area) for an electromagnetic wave is given by I = (1/2) c ε0 E_max². Because when you have E and B fields, the intensity is (ε0 E²)/(2) but also considering the speed of light.

Wait, another approach: the wave's electric and magnetic fields are related by E = c B, where B is the magnetic field. So, if the intensity is I = E * B, but I think that's not correct. Wait, the Poynting vector S is E × B / μ0. And for a wave, E and B are in phase and perpendicular, so their magnitudes are such that E = c B. So substituting: S = (c B × B) / μ0 ) = (c B²) / μ0. But since E = c B, B = E/(c). Substituting, S = c (E²/c²) ) / μ0 ) = E²/(c μ0).

Wait, so S = E²/(c μ0). Alternatively, knowing that c² = 1/(ε0 μ0), so μ0 = 1/(c² ε0). Substituting that into S, we get S = E² c ε0.

Wait, so which formula is correct? I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try a different approach.

Let me recall the power per unit area (intensity) formula: I = (1/2) c ε0 E_max². Because in this formula, E_max is the amplitude of the electric field. This comes from the fact that the intensity is the average power per area, and the average of E squared over 2.

Wait, but another way to remember is that for a wave, the intensity is (1/2) c ε0 E_max². So that's the formula I'll go with.

So the given intensity I is 1.35e3 J·m⁻²·s⁻¹. Wait, what's the unit of intensity here? Oh, right, J/(m²·s). But another unit for intensity is watts per square meter (W/m²). Because power is in watts (W) which is J/s, so J/(m²·s) = (J/s)/m² = W/m².

So I = 1350 W/m² (since 1 J = 1 W·s, so 1.35e3 J/(m² s) = 1350 W/m²).

Wait, no, 1.35e3 is 1350, correct.

So the formula is I = (1/2) c ε0 E_max². I need to solve for E_max.

So rearranging, E_max = sqrt( 2 I / (c ε0) )

Let me plug in the numbers. What's c? It's approximately 3e8 m/s. ε0 is about 8.85e-12 F/m; and μ0 is 4πe-7 H/m.

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

Compute the denominator: c * ε0.

c = 3e8 m/s,

ε0 = 8.85e-12 F/m.

So c * ε0 = 3e8 * 8.85e-12 = let's calculate that.

3e8 is 3*1e8, 8.85e-12 is 8.85 * 1e-12.

Multiply: 3 * 8.85 = 26.55. Then exponents: 1e8 * 1e-12 = 1e-4.

So c * ε0 = 26.55e-4 = 2.655e-3.

So denominator is c ε0 = 2.655e-3.

Now, 2I/(c ε0) = 2 * 1350 / 2.655e-3.

Wait, 2*1350 is 2700.

So 2700 / 2.655e-3 = let's compute that.

2700 / 0.002655 ≈ ?

Wait, 2700 divided by 0.002655. Let me compute this.

But alternatively, perhaps it's easier to rearrange.

Wait, 2700 / 0.002655 ≈ 2700 / 2.655e-3 = 2700 * (1 / 0.002655) ) ≈ 2700 * 377.38 ≈ 2700 * 377.38.

Wait, what's 377.38 multiplied by 2700?

Hmm, 377 * 2700 = ?

Compute 377 * 2000 = 754,000.

377 * 700 = 263,900.

377 * 0 = 0.

So total is 754,000 + 263,900 = 1,017,900.

Plus the 0.38 part: 377 * 0.38 ≈ 142.86.

So total ≈ 1,017,900 + 142.86 = 1,018,042.86.

So 2700 / 0.002655 ≈ approximately 1.018e6.

Wait, but wait, that would make E_max squared equal to 1.018e6.

Wait, wait, no. The denominator is 2.655e-3, which is 0.002655.

Wait, 2700 / 0.002655 = 1,018,042.86 approximately.

So sqrt(1,018,042.86) is the amplitude E_max.

What's the square root of 1,018,042.86? Let me approximate.

Since 1000^2 = 1e6, 1009^2 is (1000 +9)^2 = 1000^2 + 2*1000*9 + 81 = 1e6 + 18,000 +81 = 1,018,081.

Wait, 1009^2 = 1,018,081.

Our number is 1,018,042.86, which is a little less. So the square root would be approximately 1009 - a little.

Wait, 1009^2 is 1,018,081. 1,018,042 is 1,018,081 minus 39. So approx 1009 - (39/(2 * 1009)) ) ≈ 1009 - 0.019 ≈ 1008.98.

So E_max is approximately 1009 V/m.

Wait, but the options have 1000 V/m as the first number (options A-D). So 1.01e3 V/m would be 1000 V/m.

Wait, and the second part of the question is about the amplitude of the magnetic field. The relation between E and B is E = c B. So B = E / c.

So once I have E_max, B_max is E_max / c.

So let's compute that. E_max is approx 1009 V/m. c is 3e8 m/s.

So B_max = 1009 / 3e8 = approx 3.36e-6 T.

Wait, 1009 / 3e8 → 1009 / 3 is about 336.333; so 336.333e-8 T → 3.36333e-6 T.

Looking at the options, option C says 1.01e3 V/m and 3.37e-6 Wb/m². Wait, note that Wb is the unit for magnetic flux, and sometimes B is in T (tesla). But in the options, it's written as Wb/m², which is tesla, since Wb/m² is T. Because 1 T = 1 Wb/m².

But let me make sure.

So the options are:

A: 0.01 × 1e3 V/m and 3.7e-6 Wb/m².

B: 1e3, 3e-6.

C: 1.01e3 V/m and 3.37e-6.

D: 1.11e3 V/m and 4.37e-6.

So according to our calculation, E is about 1e3 V/m, and B is about 3.36e-6 T, which is 3.36e-6 Wb/m².

Looking at the options, option C matches that (1.01e3 V/m and 3.37e-6 Wb/m²). But wait, I used 1.35e3 J/(m² s) as the intensity. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial setup because the given intensity is 1.35e3 J/(m² s) which is 1.35e3 W/m². So when I calculated I = 1.35e3, that's correct.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator and numerator.

Denominator: c * ε0 = (3e8)(8.85e-12) = 26.55e-4 = 2.655e-3.

I = 1.35e3 W/m².

So 2I/(c ε0) = 2 * 1.35e3 / 2.655e-3.

Compute numerator: 2.7e3.

Denominator: 2.655e-3.

So 2700 / 0.002655 = 1,018,042.86.

Square root of that is sqrt(1,018,042.86) ≈ 1009 V/m. So E_max is approx 1009 V/m, which is 1.01e3 V/m. So that's correct.

Then B_max is E_max / c = 1009 / 3e8 = approximately 3.363e-6 T, which is 3.36e-6 Wb/m².

Looking at the options, option C and option B have 3.37e-6 and 3.7e-6 respectively.

So option C's B is 3.37e-6, which is very close to our calculation. So option C is the correct choice.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the initial formula. Another formula I remember is that the intensity is I = (ε0 c E_max²)/2. Let me try that.

So I = ε0 c E_max^2 / 2.

Solving for E_max: E_max = sqrt( 2 I / (ε0 c) )

So same as before.

Yes, so same calculation as before.

So with I = 1.35e3.

So E_max is sqrt( (2 * 1.35e3) / (8.85e-12 * 3e8) )

Compute denominator: 8.85e-12 * 3e8 = 26.55e-4 = 2.655e-3.

So 2I/(ε0 c) = 2 * 1.35e3 / 2.655e-3 = 2700 / 2.655e-3.

Which is 2700 / 0.002655 = 1,018,042.86.

Square root is around 1009 V/m.

Hmm, option C has 1.01e3 V/m and 3.37e-6 Wb/m². So that's correct.

To determine the amplitude of the electromagnetic waves at Earth's position if they were all at one wavelength, we start with the given intensity of solar radiation at Earth's mean distance: \( I = 1.35 \times 10^3 \, \text{J} \cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot \text{s}^{-1} \), which corresponds to \( 1.35 \times 10^3 \, \text{W/m}^2 \). The formula for the intensity of electromagnetic radiation is:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} c \varepsilon_0 E_{\text{max}}^2
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( E_{\text{max}} \), we get:

\[
E_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{2I}{c \varepsilon_0}}
\]

### Step 1: Substitute values
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \)
- \( I = 1.35 \times 10^3 \, \text{W/m}^2 \)

First, calculate \( c \varepsilon_0 \):

\[
c \varepsilon_0 = (3 \times 10^8)(8.85 \times 10^{-12}) = 2.655 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Next, compute \( 2I \):

\[
2I = 2 \times 1.35 \times 10^3 = 2700
\]

Now, calculate \( \frac{2I}{c \varepsilon_0} \):

\[
\frac{2I}{c \varepsilon_0} = \frac{2700}{2.655 \times 10^{-3}} = 1,018,042.86
\]

Finally, take the square root to find \( E_{\text{max}} \):

\[
E_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{1,018,042.86} \approx 1009 \, \text{V/m}
\]

Thus, the amplitude of the electric field is approximately \( 1.01 \times 10^3 \, \text{V/m} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the magnetic field amplitude
The relationship between the electric field \( E_{\text{max}} \) and the magnetic field \( B_{\text{max}} \) is given by:

\[
E_{\text{max}} = c B_{\text{max}}
\]

Rearranging for \( B_{\text{max}} \):

\[
B_{\text{max}} = \frac{E_{\text{max}}}{c}
\]

Substitute \( E_{\text{max}} = 1009 \, \text{V/m} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
B_{\text{max}} = \frac{1009}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.36 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{T}
\]

### Final Answer
The amplitude of the electric field is approximately \( 1.01 \times 10^3 \, \text{V/m} \), and the amplitude of the magnetic field is approximately \( 3.36 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{T} \). Comparing this to the options provided, the correct choice is:
