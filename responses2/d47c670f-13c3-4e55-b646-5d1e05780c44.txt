The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An assembly line machine is supposed to turn out ball bearings with a diameter of 1.25 centimeters. Each morning the first 30 bearings produced are pulled and measured. If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: μ = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: μ ≠ 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?

Options:

A: An incorrect assumption about the machinery's calibration
B: An unnecessary stoppage of the production process
C: Continued production of wrong size ball bearings
D: An unnecessary adjustment of the machinery
E: A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery
F: A false alarm about the size of ball bearings
G: Continued production of proper size ball bearings

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this hypothesis testing question. Let me read it carefully. So, the assembly line machine is supposed to produce ball bearings with a diameter of 1.25 cm. Each morning, the first 30 are measured. If the average is too low (under 1.23 cm) or too high (over 1.27 cm), machinery stops and adjustments are made. The setup looks like a hypothesis test with H0: μ=1.25 and Ha: μ≠1.25. The engineer stops when H0 is rejected.

The question is about what a Type II error would result in. So Type II errors are when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. In this context, that would mean concluding the machinery is working properly (μ=1.25) when in reality it's not. So the machine is producing bearings of the correct size, but the test doesn't catch it because the sample mean doesn't fall outside the rejected region.

Looking at the options, the Type II error would result in the machine producing ball bearings of the wrong size. So looking at the options:

A: Incorrect assumption about calibration. Not sure, because Type II is about rejecting a false null. So A might be a Type I, but it's not the main point here.

B: Unnecessary stoppage. That's about rejecting H0 when it's true, which is Type I. So B would be Type I.

C: Continued wrong production. If the null is true, the machine is producing correctly. So Type II would mean accepting μ=1.25 when it's actually not. So the machine is still producing proper sizes, but we don't know because it's a Type II error.

D: Unnecessary adjustment. Again, this is Type I. Because if H0 is true, and we reject it, we'd be adjusting unnecessarily. So D is Type I.

E: A warranted halt to adjust. Wait, a Type II error doesn't involve stopping for adjustment. E is about stopping to adjust, which is Type I. So E is Type I.

F: A false alarm. Type II is about not rejecting a false H0, so F is actually the opposite of Type II error. Because Type II is about failing to reject when H0 is false, which is a false negative.

G: Continued proper production. So if Type II error occurs, the machine is still producing the correct size (μ=1.25). So the machine is producing correct bearings, but we didn't notice because the test failed to detect it. So G is correct for Type II.

Thus, the answer should be G.

The question involves understanding Type II errors in hypothesis testing. A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis. In this context, it means concluding the machinery is working properly (μ=1.25) when it's actually not. This results in the machine producing incorrect-sized ball bearings, so the correct answer is **G: Continued production of proper size ball bearings**.

Answer: G
