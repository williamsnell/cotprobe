Okay, so I've got this question about Drosophila and their chromosomes. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the last part of the response being the letter I choose. The options are A to I, and the last character must be the letter I pick.

The question says: "The polytene chromosomes seen in Drosophila silvarentis with the aid of a light microscope are...?"

Wait, I remember that polytene chromosomes are a term used in fruit flies, like Drosophila, for the type of chromosome structure that's more than one chromosome. So they have multiple copies of a single chromosome. Oh right, because they're in the mid-20th century, and it's called polytene because they have many chromosomes, but each individual has multiple copies.

So the options are about what they look like when viewed under a light microscope. Let's go through the options:

A: multiple copies of a single chromosome. That sounds right because polytene refers to multiple copies of a single chromosome.

B: not visible even under a light microscope. No, I don't think so. I remember that in Drosophila, the chromosomes are so visible because each has many copies. So B is incorrect.

C: produced only during mitosis. No, mitosis happens in somatic cells, but polytene is part of the somatic cells. Some cells divide by mitosis, but the chromosomes are already present. So C is wrong.

D: produced by repeated rounds of nuclear division without DNA replication. Hmm. Wait, in the body of the fly, do they undergo DNA replication? I think in fruit flies, the nuclear division is interphase, so there's DNA replication. But polytene chromosomes are in the nucleus, so the cells divide via mitosis. So D is incorrect because they do have DNA replication.

E: single copies of multiple chromosomes. No, because polytene implies multiple copies. So E is wrong.

F: not actively carrying out transcription. I don't think so. The main thing is replication, but some cells might express proteins that have transcription factors, but I'm not sure. But the question is about what the chromosomes look like, not their function.

G: produced by single round of DNA replication without nuclear division. No, because the fly's cells undergo multiple nuclear divisions. So G is wrong.

H: produced only during meiosis. No, meiosis is for gametes, not the somatic cells. So H is incorrect.

I: produced by repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division. Oh wait, that's correct. Fruit flies undergo mitotic division, so the DNA replicates each time and then the cell divides. So I is correct.

So the correct answer is I, which ends with 'I'.

The correct answer is **I**, as the polytene chromosomes in Drosophila silvarentis are produced by repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division. 

Answer: I
