Question:

A woman took her car to a mechanic to be serviced. After doing a thorough inspection of the car, the mechanic told the woman that her car needed extensive work and that he could do all that was needed for $1,000. The parties then entered into a written contract to have the car serviced for $1,000. As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. While servicing the car, the mechanic discovered that a belt was severel' worn and need to be replaced. The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so. When the mechanic was finished, he presented the woman with a bill for $1,100, representing the $1,000 called for by the contract and $100 for the replacement of the worn belt, which is a reasonable amount. The woman refused to pay any more than$1,000. The mechanic sued the woman to collect the $100 for the replacement of the worn belt. If the court rules in favor of the mechanic, which of the following is the most likely cause for such a ruling?

Options:

A: The mechanic had a legal obligation to replace the worn belt in order to ensure the car's safety.
B: The parties entered into a collateral oral agreement for the replacement of the worn belt that was excludable from the integrated writing.
C: The written contract was not specific about what services were included in the $1,000 fee.
D: The mechanic performed an action beyond the agreed contract and hence has the right to additional compensation.
E: An implied-in-law contract was created at the moment the mechanic replaced the worn belt.
F: The woman verbally agreed to the extra work and therefore should cover the additional costs.
G: The oral agreement was not legally binding as it was not included in the written contract.
H: The writing was construed as a complete integration of the parties' agreement.
I: The writing was construed as a partial integration of the parties' agreement.
J: The mechanic could reasonably assume that the woman would want the worn belt replaced.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this legal question. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a woman suing a mechanic for an additional fee after a car had a belt replaced that wasn't listed in the written contract. The contract was $1,000, but the mechanic paid $1,100 because he replaced the belt, which cost an extra $100. The question is about why the court might rule in favor of the mechanic, meaning the mechanic's action is valid.

First, I need to understand the contract between the woman and the mechanic. They entered into a written contract that said the car would be serviced for $1,000. Then, at the time the contract was formed, the woman and mechanic orally agreed that any additional work beyond what the contract specified would be included. But the contract didn't mention the belt replacement, so the woman never had to pay extra for it. However, when the mechanic found the belt was worn, he didn't know it was specified in the contract and thought it wasn't. He replaced it and added $100 to the bill, thinking it was part of the $1,000. The woman refused further payment.

So the key here is whether the contract was clear about what was included. The contract didn't specify the belt replacement as part of the $1,000. That means the contract was void because it didn't include the additional services. But wait, noâ€”wait. Or perhaps the contract was oral, so it's unclear. 

Wait, the contract was written, but the oral agreement was before the contract was finalized. So the written contract's terms were oral. So when the contract was signed, the parties didn't agree on including the belt replacement in the $1,000. Thus, the contract itself was void because it didn't specify the extra work. But wait, if the contract was oral, then the contract's terms are not legally binding unless it's written. So maybe the contract is unenforceable because it was oral. Or perhaps the initial oral agreement is binding because it's part of the contract.

Wait, the question says they entered into a written contract. Then, at the time it was formed, they had an oral agreement about the extra. But the written contract didn't say anything about it. So the written contract was silent on the belt replacement. So the contract is void because it was not written, right? But wait, the contract was written and signed, but the oral agreement wasn't part of the contract, so the contract itself isn't binding beyond what the written part says. Or perhaps the contract's terms were oral, but since it's written now, the written terms take precedence. Hmm, I might need to think about that.

So, the contract was oral. If the contract is oral, then it's not legally binding unless it's written. But when they made a written contract, does that make it legally binding? Or does the contract itself have to be written? I think a contract can be oral, but it must be legally binding. So the written contract is just a written version of the oral agreement. So the contract is a contract, but the terms are oral. So the written contract is not legally binding because it's oral. Wait, no. The contract itself is a written agreement, so it's legally binding. The problem is whether the contract included the extra work.

Wait, the contract was written, but the additional work wasn't specified. So when the contract was signed, the parties didn't agree to include the belt replacement. So the contract is void because it wasn't written. But the contract was formed, so the parties intended to perform the services as written. So the contract is unenforceable because it wasn't written. But if the contract is unenforceable, the mechanic can't claim the extra $100 as part of the contract. Therefore, the mechanic is liable for the extra amount, which is $100. So the court would rule in favor of the mechanic because he is acting within the contract.

But wait, the question says that the contract was formed, they had an oral agreement. But the written contract wasn't. So the contract itself as written is void because it was oral. But the contract as intended is the written part, which is enforceable. So the written contract is enforceable and is the basis for the $1,000. The oral agreement was only for the extra beyond that, which wasn't part of the contract.

So the contract is enforceable, and the $1,000 was for the services specified. The belt replacement, being an additional service, is not included in the $1,000. Thus, the mechanic did not have to pay for it when he replaced it. But the woman didn't accept the replacement, so the mechanic could sue for the extra.

Wait, but the fact that the contract was oral doesn't make the contract unenforceable. Because the contract was written, but the parties had an oral agreement. So the written contract is enforceable, and the oral agreement is just a separate agreement. So the contract's terms are the written part, which is to have the car serviced for $1,000. Any additional work, like the belt replacement, isn't included in it. Thus, the contract is void because it wasn't written. But wait, the contract was written, so it's enforceable, but it doesn't include the extra work. So the contract's terms were not in writing, so the contract is void.

Alternatively, if the contract was oral, but then written version is made, then the contract is enforceable. But the original contract was written, so it's enforceable regardless of the initial agreement being oral.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify. A contract can be oral or written. When it's oral, it's not legally binding unless it's written. But when it's written, it is legally binding. So if the contract is written, it's enforceable. But if it's oral, it's not. So the written contract is enforceable, but it doesn't include the extra work. So the contract is void because it didn't specify. But the contract is enforceable only if it's written.

Wait, no. A contract can be written or oral but not binding unless it's written. So if the contract is written, it is enforceable. The initial agreement being oral doesn't affect the enforceability of the contract. So the written contract is legally binding. But the contract doesn't include the belt replacement in the $1,000. So the contract is void because it's oral, but the written version is what's enforceable.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. The contract being written makes it legally binding regardless of whether it was oral. The contract is written, so it's enforceable. The original oral agreement was separate. So the contract as written is enforceable, but the part that wasn't in the contract is void. So the contract is not binding because it was oral. So the contract is not enforceable, so the mechanic can't claim the extra $100.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the contract was written, so it's enforceable. The contract didn't specify the belt replacement. So the contract is void because it was oral, but the contract is written. So the contract is enforceable only if it's written. So the contract is void, so the mechanic can't sue.

But the woman didn't accept the contract, but the mechanic replaced the belt, which is an extra service. So perhaps the contract was written, so the $1,000 was for the services listed in the contract. Any additional work, like the belt replacement, wasn't part of the contract. So the contract is void because it was oral, but the written contract is enforceable. Wait, no. The contract as written is enforceable regardless of whether it was oral. So the contract is enforceable, but the terms are not in writing. So the contract is void because it's oral.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about it differently. The contract is written, so it's enforceable. But the contract doesn't include the belt replacement, so it's void. Thus, the contract isn't valid, so the mechanic can't claim the extra $100.

But the question is, why would the court rule in favor of the mechanic? The only way the mechanic wins is if he's acting within the contract. So if the contract is void, he can't claim the extra.

But then, the written contract was formed with an oral agreement. So the contract isn't written, hence void. So the mechanic is not bound by the contract. So the question is, what's the reasoning for the court ruling in his favor? Maybe the contract was not specific about the services, so the mechanic was acting beyond the contract.

Wait, looking at the options, option C says the contract was not specific about the services included in the $1,000. So the contract didn't specify the belt replacement, so when the mechanic replaced it, he's adding something not covered in the contract. So the contract is not specific, making the mechanic liable.

That would make sense. So the contract was not specific, so the mechanic couldn't have relied on it. Therefore, the court would rule in favor of him.

So the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The question revolves around a scenario where a woman sued a mechanic for an additional fee after the mechanic discovered a belt replacement beyond the written contract's terms. The key issue is whether the contract was specific about the services included in the $1,000 fee, allowing the mechanic to claim the extra $100.

1. **Contract Formation and Terms**: The woman and mechanic entered into a written contract for $1,000 to service the car. However, at the time of formation, an oral agreement was reached, which the contract did not specify. The contract was oral, meaning it wasn't legally binding unless written.

2. **Contract Enforceability**: The written contract is enforceable as it was legally binding. However, the contract did not include the belt replacement service, making it void because it was oral.

3. **Mechanic's Action**: The mechanic replaced the belt, which was not part of the contract. As the contract was not written, the mechanic couldn't rely on it for coverage. The absence of a specific clause in the contract regarding the belt replacement created a basis for the mechanic to sue for the additional cost.

4. **Legal Reasoning**: The contract was not specific about the included services, allowing the mechanic to act beyond the contract terms. This situation aligns with option C, where the contract lacked specificity, enabling the mechanic to claim the extra fee.
