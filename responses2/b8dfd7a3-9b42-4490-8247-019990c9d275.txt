Okay, so I need to answer this question about a Mars mission. Let me take it step by step.

The question is asking which Mars mission will land on May 25, 2008 and dig a trench into ice-rich soil. The options are given from A to J.

First, I should recall which missions are launched around that time. I remember that some of the key Mars missions from the early 2000s were part of the New Horizons, which landed in 2006, and then the Perseverance rover which is on the launch vehicle.

Wait, but the options given don't include New Horizons. Let's check the options again. The options are A to J, and I see some names like Mars Global Surveyor (MarsGS), which is a mission from NASA. I think Mars Global Surveyor is called "Mars Express" sometimes, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm trying to remember. Mars Express (also known as Mars Express) was launched in 2003 and landed on the surface in 2006. That's not the one we're looking for since it's a few years before 2008.

Another option is the Perseverance, which is part of the Perseverance program. Perseverance was launched in 2007 and landed on Mars in 2012. So that's after 2008. So that's not it either.

Looking back, the options include "Mars Express." But I'm not sure if that's the same as Mars Express. Maybe it's a different mission? Or perhaps the question is referring to a different year.

Wait, the question specifies May 25, 2008. I think Mars Express was launched in 2005 and landed in 2007. So that's not the one.

Another option is Mars Global Surveyor, but I think that's called Mars Express. Or maybe Mars Express is a different mission. Alternatively, I recall that the Perseverance is part of the Perseverance program, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps there's another mission. Another one that comes to mind is the Curiosity rover, launched in 2014. But that's after 2008.

Looking back, the options don't include some of the more recent missions. Let me think again. The options are A to J, but the answers I'm supposed to choose from include a few missions like Mars Express, which I think is part of the Perseverance program. But the correct option for May 25, 2008 might be Mars Express, which was launched in 2005, so that's before the question's date.

Wait, another thought: the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) program is another possibility, launched in 2004. But that's before as well.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the missions that were launched around 2008.

Wait, another option is the Mars Global Surveyor (MarsGS), which is an older mission. I think Mars Global Surveyor 2 was launched in 2001 and landed in 2005. So if I'm looking for 2008, that's way too early.

Wait, maybe I should look for the Perseverance. Oh, wait, no, that's 2007. So May 25, 2008 is after that, so Perseverance is no good.

Wait, perhaps there's a mission called Mars Express or some earlier mission that I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a different year.

Alternatively, I remember that the Perseverance took a while to land, but perhaps I'm mixing up the years. Let me check: Mars Express was launched in 2005, landed in 2007.

Another possibility: the Curiosity was launched in 2014, which is way later.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options include "ExoMars" which I'm not sure what that is. Or "Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)" was launched in 2005, but I'm not sure when it landed.

Wait, I think Mars Express was launched in 2005, which would take a while. But May 25, 2008, that's after that. So none of the options seem to match.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question refers to a different year. Let me think again. Or maybe I'm recalling the wrong mission.

Wait, another possibility: the Mars Global Surveyor (MarsGS) is actually a mission launched in 2001, but I'm not sure if it's called "Mars Express" or another name. Alternatively, perhaps "Mars Express" is a different mission.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the Perseverance, but that's 2007.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mars Express, which is part of the Perseverance program. But I'm not certain about the exact year it landed. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a different mission.

Wait, another approach: let me check what each option is.

Option A: Mars Science Laboratory. I think that was launched in 2004, which is before 2008.

Option B: Mars Odyssey. I believe it was launched in 2006, so May 25, 2008, is after that. So it's not it.

Option C: Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN). That was launched in 2011. May 25, 2008, so it's way later.

Option D: Phoenix Mars Lander. Launched in 2006, so again, after 2008.

Option E: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Launched in 2008. May 25, 2008. So if the question is about a mission that lands in 2008, this is a possibility. But the question says "will dig a trench into (hopefully) ice-rich soil." So I'm not sure if the Reconnaissance Orbiter is the one.

Option F: Mars Express. That's from the Perseverance program. It was launched in 2005, so after May 25, 2008.

Option G: Mars Global Surveyor. I think that's called Mars Express. I'm not certain about the exact landing dates.

Option H: Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). Launched in 2005, so before 2008.

Option I: ExoMars. I'm not familiar with this one, but perhaps it's a different mission.

Option J: Mars Exploration Rovers. Not sure what that does, but perhaps it's a rover mission.

Hmm, the question is asking for a mission that lands on Mars in May 2008 and digs a trench into ice. So which of these options is launched in May 2008?

Looking at the options, only E (Mars Reconnaissance) is launched in 2008. So if the question is about a mission launched in May 2008, then E is the correct answer. But the question also says that the mission will dig a trench into ice-rich soil. So I'm assuming that the mission lands on the surface and digs into the soil, perhaps looking for water or other resources.

Wait, Mars Reconnaissance was launched in 2008 and, as far as I remember, it does have instruments that can dig trenches into the soil, especially in the northern hemisphere. So the correct answer would be E.

To determine which Mars mission will land on May 25, 2008, and dig a trench into ice-rich soil, we analyze the options provided:

- **Option A (Mars Science Laboratory)**: Launched in 2004, this mission is before the target date.
- **Option B (Mars Odyssey)**: Launched in 2006, this mission is also before the target date.
- **Option C (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution)**: Launched in 2011, this mission is well after the target date.
- **Option D (Phoenix Mars Lander)**: Launched in 2006, this mission is before the target date.
- **Option E (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter)**: Launched in 2008, this mission is the correct launch year. Additionally, it is known to dig trenches into ice-rich soil in the northern hemisphere.
- **Options F, G, H, I, J**: These missions do not align with the target launch date of May 25, 2008.

The correct answer is the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, as it is launched in May 2008 and is designed to explore Mars, including digging trenches into ice-rich soil.

**Answer: E**
