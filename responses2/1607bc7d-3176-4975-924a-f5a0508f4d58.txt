The cab driver recognized the passenger as a former girlfriend, and the passenger invited him into her house when they arrived. Unknown to the cab driver, the passenger was an undercover police officer who worked in the sex crimes unit. When they were inside the passenger's house, the cab driver made sexual advances toward the passenger, who responded by kissing him and holding his hand. The cab driver was about to kiss the passenger again, when she got up to answer the phone in the kitchen. If the cab driver is subsequently arrested and charged with the attempted rape of the passenger, he should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, if he was predisposed to commit thecrime.
B: guilty, if he continued his advances after she got up.
C: not guilty.
D: guilty, based on the passenger's account.
E: not guilty, if he raises the proper alibi defense.
F: guilty, if his advances were unwelcome.
G: not guilty, if he can prove his intentions were not malicious.
H: guilty, if the passenger felt threatened.
I: not guilty, solely because he was entrapped.
J: not guilty, if he did not use force or threats.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this legal question. Let me read through the scenario carefully.

So, a cab driver is looking for a last passenger. He gets a passenger who's a former girlfriend, but the passenger is an undercover police officer in sex crimes. They go into her house, and the driver makes sexual advances. The passenger responds by kissing him and holding his hand. Then the driver is about to kiss again, and the passenger gets up to answer the phone in the kitchen. He's then arrested for attempted rape.

The question is whether the cab driver should be guilty if he was about to kiss again, or if he can be acquitted.

I remember that the law has a rule about continuing advances after getting uncomfortable. The rule is like the "two-step" rule, which states that if someone is in an intimate relationship, they can't continue making advances after the initial contact. So, in this case, the passenger was a mutual acquaintance, but the driver was already in a relationship.

Wait, but the passenger is the undercover police officer. Did she get to know the driver before? The passenger is an undercover officer, so they might not have known the driver personally. But the fact that the driver was about to kiss her again when she got up suggests that she was uncomfortable, so he couldn't continue without causing conflict.

I think the key here is the rule against continuing sexual advances after the initial contact. So, even though the passenger might not be explicitly aware, the fact that the driver was about to make more advances after the initial contact would likely lead to him being found guilty.

Looking at the options:

A: Not guilty if predisposed. I think if the driver's past history suggests he's prone to such behavior, but the question doesn't mention any such history, so not the reason.

B: Guilty if he continued after she got up. That seems correct because the rule says you can't continue after getting uncomfortable.

C: Not guilty. That's not right because the two-step rule applies.

D: Guilty based on passenger's account. The passenger's account is unreliable, so this doesn't hold.

E: Not guilty solely because of alibi. The alibi defense is about not knowing, but the question doesn't state that; it's more about the legal precedent.

F: Guilty if advances were unwelcome. But that's more about the intent, which the rule doesn't address.

G: Not guilty if he can prove intentions were not malicious. That's about intent, which the rule doesn't require.

H: Guilty if passenger felt threatened. The rule doesn't address threats, only the two-step.

I: Not guilty because of being entrapped. Entrapment is about the situation, not the legal rule.

J: Not guilty if he used force or threats. Again, not about the legal precedent.

So the correct answer should be B, guilty if he continued his advances after she got up.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: guilty, if he continued his advances after she got up.**

**Explanation:**
The scenario involves aCab driver who, after a mutual acquaintance (the passenger, an undercover police officer), made sexual advances. The rule against continuing advances after initial contact applies here. Even if the passenger wasn't aware, the driver's continued advances after discomfort would violate the two-step crime rule. 

**Answer:**
B
