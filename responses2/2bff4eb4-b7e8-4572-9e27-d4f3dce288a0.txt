Okay, so I've got this linear algebra problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the rank of a vector group after some transformations. The vectors are u₁, u₂, u₃, and they're given to be linearly independent. Then there are two cases: λ equals sqrt(5) and λ equals 1. I need to find the rank for each case and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, first, I should recall what linear independence means. Linearly independent vectors are those that cannot be expressed as a combination of the others. Since u₁, u₂, u₃ are linearly independent, they form a basis for the space they're in, assuming they're in R³, which they probably are since the problem is about rank which is typically discussed in the context of 3D vectors.

Now, the vectors in question are u₁ - λ u₂, u₂ - λ u₃, u₃ - λ u₁. I need to find the rank of this new set when λ is sqrt(5) and when it's 1.

Wait, rank is the maximum number of linearly independent vectors in the set. So for each λ, I need to see how many of these three vectors are linearly independent.

Let me think about the matrix formed by these vectors. Let's denote the new vectors as v₁ = u₁ - λ u₂, v₂ = u₂ - λ u₃, v₃ = u₃ - λ u₁. So, the matrix would be:

[ v₁ v₂ v₃ ] = 
[ u₁ - λ u₂ , u₂ - λ u₃ , u₃ - λ u₁ ]

I can represent this matrix as a combination of the original vectors. Let me write it out more clearly.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of linear combinations. Let me arrange them as a matrix. Let me write the vectors as rows or columns. I think arranging them as columns might make it clearer.

So the matrix would be:

[ u₁ - λ u₂ ]
[ u₂ - λ u₃ ]
[ u₃ - λ u₁ ]

Wait, no, that's not the right arrangement. Because v₁ is a combination of u₁ and u₂, v₂ is a combination of u₂ and u₃, and v₃ is a combination of u₃ and u₁. So the matrix would have the columns as the new vectors.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express this in terms of the original vectors. Let me consider the original vectors as u₁, u₂, u₃. So each new vector is a linear combination of two of the original vectors. So when I arrange them as a matrix, the columns are these new vectors.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider the transformation as a matrix multiplication. Let me think: if I create a matrix M where each column is a new vector, then the new vectors are M multiplied by a vector of coefficients. But I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Wait, another approach: since u₁, u₂, u₃ are linearly independent, any set of vectors that's dependent on them will have a rank less than or equal to 3. But in this case, we have 3 vectors, so the maximum rank is 3. But maybe they could be dependent in some way.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors. If the determinant is non-zero, the rank is 3. If it's zero, then the rank is less than 3. So I can compute the determinant for each λ value.

Let me set up the matrix for the first case, λ = sqrt(5). The matrix would be:

Row 1: u₁ - sqrt(5) u₂

Row 2: u₂ - sqrt(5) u₃

Row 3: u₃ - sqrt(5) u₁

Wait, or wait, perhaps I should arrange them as columns. Let me write them as columns. So the matrix M for λ = sqrt(5) is:

[ u₁ - sqrt(5) u₂, u₂ - sqrt(5) u₃, u₃ - sqrt(5) u₁ ]

Wait, no. Wait, each column is a new vector. So for each column i, it's a linear combination of u₁, u₂, u₃. So the first column is v₁ = u₁ - λ u₂, the second is v₂ = u₂ - λ u₃, and the third is v₃ = u₃ - λ u₁.

So the matrix M is:

[ 1  0  -λ ]
[ -λ 1  0 ]
[ 0 -λ 1 ]

Wait, no—wait. Each column is a vector, which is a linear combination. So the first column is [1, 0, -λ]^T, right? Because v₁ is u₁ (coefficient 1) plus -λ u₂ (coefficient 0, wait no. Wait, no, the vector v₁ is u₁ minus λ u₂. So the coefficients are 1 for u₁, -λ for u₂, and 0 for u3.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should represent the transformation as a matrix. Let me think: perhaps I can express the new vectors as a matrix product. Let me denote the new vectors as:

v₁ = u₁ - λ u₂
v₂ = u₂ - λ u₃
v₃ = u₃ - λ u₁

So in matrix form, if I have a vector [u1; u2; u3], then the transformation is:

[1, -λ, 0; 0, 1, -λ; -λ, 0, 1] * [u1; u2; u3]

Wait, because v₁ = 1*u1 + (-λ)*u2 + 0*u3
v₂ = 0*u1 + 1*u2 + (-λ)*u3
v₃ = (-λ)*u1 + 0*u2 + 1*u3

So the transformation matrix is:

M = [
[1, -λ, 0],
[0, 1, -λ],
[-λ, 0, 1]
]

To find the rank of the new vector set, which is the set {v₁, v₂, v₃}, I need to find the rank of this matrix. Alternatively, since the original vectors are independent, the rank of this matrix will tell me the rank of the new set. Wait, no, because the original vectors are independent but the new vectors are in terms of them, so perhaps the rank is the same as the rank of the transformation matrix.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because the columns of M are the vectors v₁, v₂, v₃, which are linear combinations of the original vectors. So the rank of M is the rank of the transformation, but since the original set is independent, the rank is equal to the number of independent columns in M, provided the original set is also independent.

Wait, but I think the rank of the set {v₁, v₂, v₃} is the same as the rank of the transformation matrix M. Because the transformation is just expressing v's in terms of u's. So if the transformation matrix has rank r, then the set {v₁, v₂, v₃} has rank r.

So for each λ, I need to compute the rank of M.

Let's compute the determinant of M. If the determinant is zero, the rank is less than 3.

So for M:

| M | = 1*(1*1 - (-λ)*0) - (-λ)*(0*1 - (-λ)*(-λ)) + 0*(0*0 - 1*(-λ)).

Let me compute that step by step.

The determinant of M is:

1*( (1)(1) - (-λ)(0) ) - (-λ)*( (0)(1) - (-λ)(-λ) ) + 0*( (0)(0) - (1)(-λ) )

Simplify each term:

First term: 1*(1 - 0) = 1*1 = 1.

Second term: -(-λ) * (0 - λ²) = λ * (-λ²) = -λ³.

Third term: 0 * something = 0.

So the determinant is 1 - λ³.

Wait, wait, let me check that again.

Wait, the general formula for a 3x3 matrix is:

det = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg),

where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So in our case, M is:

[1, -λ, 0]
[0, 1, -λ]
[-λ, 0, 1]

So a=1, b=-λ, c=0.

d=0, e=1, f=-λ.

g=-λ, h=0, i=1.

So det = 1*(1*1 - (-λ)*0) - (-λ)*(0*1 - (-λ)*(-λ)) + 0*(0*0 - 1*(-λ)).

Compute each part:

First term: 1*(1 - 0) = 1*1 = 1.

Second term: -(-λ) * (0 - λ²) → because 0*1 is 0, and (-λ)*(-λ) is λ². So 0 - λ² = -λ². So second part is -(-λ) * (-λ²) = lambda * (-lambda squared) = -lambda^3.

Third term: 0*(something) = 0.

So total det = 1 - lambda^3.

So det(M) = 1 - λ^3.

So for λ = sqrt(5), det(M) = 1 - (sqrt(5))^3.

Hmm, (sqrt(5))^3 is 5^(3/2) = 5 * sqrt(5). So det = 1 - 5*sqrt(5), which is definitely non-zero. Because 5*sqrt(5) is about 5*2.236≈11.18, so 1-11.18 is about -10.18. So determinant is not zero.

Wait, wait, but if the determinant is non-zero, then the matrix is invertible, so rank is 3.

But wait, I thought the determinant was 1 - λ^3. So for lambda^3 =1, the determinant is zero. When does lambda^3 =1? When lambda is 1, since it's real. For the other roots, which are complex, but we're dealing with real numbers here.

So for lambda =1, det(M) =1-1=0, so the matrix is singular, and the rank is less than 3. So in that case, the rank is 2, I think.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check.

Wait, when lambda =1, the determinant is zero. So the matrix is singular. So the rank is less than 3.

So for lambda= sqrt(5), det is not zero, so rank is 3.

For lambda=1, det is zero, so rank is less than 3. But what is it? Since it's a 3x3 matrix, the rank could be 2 or 3 if the matrix is singular. Wait, but since the original vectors are independent, and the transformation is expressible in terms of them, perhaps the rank is 2 or 3.

Wait, when the determinant is zero, the rank is 2 because the rows (or columns) are linearly dependent.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the determinant is zero, but the matrix might have two linearly independent rows. So the rank would be 2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform row operations to see.

Let me consider M for lambda=1.

M becomes:

1   -1   0
0    1  -1
-1   0    1

Let me try to compute the rank by row operations.

First, let me write the matrix:

Row 1: 1, -1, 0

Row 2: 0, 1, -1

Row 3: -1, 0, 1

Let me add Row 1 to Row 3: Row3 = Row3 + Row1.

Row3 becomes: (1-1), (0 -1), (0) → Wait, no: original Row3 is -1,0,1. Adding Row1 (1,-1,0) gives:

-1 +1=0

0 + (-1) = -1

1 + 0=1

So Row3 becomes [0, -1, 1]

Now the matrix is:

Row1: 1, -1, 0

Row2:0, 1, -1

Row3:0, -1, 1

Now, add Row2 to Row3: Row3 becomes Row3 + Row2.

0+0=0

-1 +1=0

1 + (-1)=0.

So Row3 becomes [0,0,0].

So now the matrix looks like:

Row1: 1, -1, 0

Row2:0,1,-1

Row3:0,0,0

So now, the matrix has two non-zero rows, so the rank is 2.

So when lambda=1, the rank is 2.

For lambda= sqrt(5), the determinant is non-zero, so the matrix is invertible, and rank is 3.

So the ranks are 3 and 2 for lambda= sqrt(5) and lambda=1 respectively.

Looking at the options, which pair is [3,2]?

Option F: [3,1] → No, because the second is 1, but it's 2.

Option G: [3,3] → No, second is 3, but correct is 2.

Option E: [2,3] → No.

Option D: [1,1] → No.

Option A: [1,2] → No.

Option B: [2,1] → No.

Option C: [3,2] → Yes, this is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check: for lambda= sqrt(5), the determinant is 1 - (sqrt(5))^3. Let me compute that:

sqrt(5) is about 2.236, so (sqrt(5))^3 = 5 * sqrt(5) ≈ 11.18. So 1 - 11.18 ≈ -10.18, which is not zero. So determinant is non-zero, so rank 3.

For lambda=1, rank 2.

So the answer should be [3,2], which is option C.

The problem involves finding the rank of a vector group after transformations for specific values of λ. The vectors are u₁ - λ u₂, u₂ - λ u₃, and u₃ - λ u₁. The determinant of the transformation matrix is calculated for each λ. For λ = sqrt(5), the determinant is non-zero, indicating full rank (3). For λ = 1, the determinant is zero, leading to rank 2. Thus, the ranks are [3, 2], corresponding to option C.
