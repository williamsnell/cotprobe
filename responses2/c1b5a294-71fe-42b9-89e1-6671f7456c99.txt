Question:

Mrs. Johnson spends her entire daily budget on potato chips, at a price of $1 each, and onion dip at a price of $2 each. At her current consumption bundle, the marginal utility of chips is 12 and the marginal utility of dip is 30. Mrs. Johnson should

Options:

A: do nothing; she is consuming her utility maximizing combination of chips and dip.
B: increase her consumption of chips until the marginal utility of chip consumption equals 30.
C: decrease her consumption of dip until the marginal utility of dip consumption equals 12.
D: increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility of dip consumption equals 12.
E: decrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.
F: decrease her consumption of dip and increase her consumption of chips until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.
G: increase her consumption of both chips and dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.
H: do nothing; she should continue consuming chips and dip at the current ratio.
I: increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility of dip consumption equals 24.
J: decrease her consumption of chips until the marginal utility of chip consumption equals 30.

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about Mrs. Johnson's consumption of potato chips and onion dip. She spends her entire daily budget on these two items. The price of each potato chip is $1, and the onion dip is $2 each. Her current consumption bundle is what she's spending her entire budget on.

The problem gives me the marginal utilities for each. The marginal utility of chips is 12, and for the dip it's 30. The options are about how she should adjust her consumption to maximize her utility.

Hmm, I remember from my microeconomics class that to maximize utility given a budget constraint, the marginal utility per dollar should be equal for all goods. So the idea is that the last dollar spent on each should provide the same additional utility. If the marginal utility per dollar is higher for one good, she should reallocate her spending to the other.

Let me think about the numbers. The marginal utility per dollar for chips would be the marginal utility divided by the price. So for chips, it's 12 divided by 1, which is 12. For dip, it's 30 divided by 2, which is 15.

So currently, the marginal utility per dollar for dip is higher (15) than chips (12). That means she's getting more utility per dollar from the dip. So to maximize utility, she should spend less on chips and more on dip until their marginal utilities per dollar are equal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E says she should decrease chips and increase dip until their marginal utilities per dollar are equal. That aligns with what I just thought. So E is the correct choice.

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option A says she's already maximizing. But since the per-dollars are not equal, she's not, so A is wrong. B suggests increasing chips until their marginal utilities equal 30. But the marginal utility per dollar is the key here, not the marginal utility itself. So B is incorrect. C talks about decreasing dip until its marginal utility equals 12, which is not the per-dollar thing. D is the opposite, increasing dip until its per-dollar equals 12. That's not right. E is correct as discussed. The other options don't fit the logic.

To maximize utility, the marginal utility per dollar should be equal for all goods. Calculating this, the marginal utility per dollar for chips is 12, and for dip, it's 15. Since dip has a higher per-dollar utility, Mrs. Johnson should increase consumption of dip and decrease chips until their per-dollar utilities are equal. 

Answer: E
