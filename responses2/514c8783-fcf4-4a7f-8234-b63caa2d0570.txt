Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the probability that X1 is between 0.5 and 1, and X2 is between 0.4 and 0.8. X1 and X2 are independent random variables. 

First, I remember that for independent variables, the joint probability density function is just the product of their individual density functions. That means I can multiply f1(x1) by f2(x2) to get the joint pdf, f(x1, x2).

So, f(x1, x2) = f1(x1) * f2(x2) = 2x1 * 4x2^3. Let me compute that: 2 * 4 is 8, so f(x1, x2) = 8 x1 x2^3.

Now, I need to find P(0.5 < X1 < 1 and 0.4 < X2 < 0.8). Since X1 and X2 are independent, I can write this as the product of two separate probabilities: P(0.5 < X1 < 1) * P(0.4 < X2 < 0.8). 

Let me handle each probability separately.

Starting with P(0.5 < X1 < 1). The density function for X1 is 2x1, valid between 0 and 1. So, the probability is the integral from 0.5 to 1 of 2x1 dx1.

Computing that integral: The integral of 2x1 is x1². Evaluated from 0.5 to 1, so 1² - (0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. So, P(0.5 < X1 < 1) is 0.75.

Next, P(0.4 < X2 < 0.8). The density function for X2 is 4x2^3. So, the probability is the integral from 0.4 to 0.8 of 4x2^3 dx2.

Computing that: The integral of 4x2^3 is x2^4. Evaluated from 0.4 to 0.8, so (0.8)^4 - (0.4)^4.

Let me compute each term. 0.8^4: 0.8 is 4/5, so (4/5)^4 = (256)/(625) = 0.4096. Similarly, 0.4^4: 0.4 is 2/5, so (2/5)^4 = 16/625 = 0.0256.

So, the probability is 0.4096 - 0.0256 = 0.384. 

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations. 0.8 to the fourth is 0.8*0.8=0.64, then 0.64*0.8=0.512, and 0.512*0.8=0.4096. Yes, that's correct. 0.4^4 is 0.4*0.4=0.16, then 0.16*0.4=0.064, then 0.064*0.4=0.0256. So, 0.4096 - 0.0256 is indeed 0.384.

So, P(0.4 < X2 <0.8) is 0.384.

Now, the joint probability is the product: 0.75 * 0.384. Let me compute that.

0.75 * 0.384. 0.75 is 3/4, so 3/4 * 384/1000. Let me compute 384 * 3 = 1152, then 1152 divided by 4000 (since 4 * 1000 is 4000). 1152 / 4000. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 16: 72 / 250. 72 divided by 250 is 0.288.

Hmm, so the joint probability is 0.288.

Now, looking at the answer options, I have to see which fraction equals 0.288.

The options are all fractions over 125, so let me convert 0.288 to a fraction over 125.

0.288 is equal to 0.288 * 125 / 125. Let's compute 0.288 * 125.

0.288 * 100 =28.8; 0.288 *25=7.2. So, 28.8 +7.2=36. So, 0.288 = 36/100, but wait, we need it over 125. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.288 as a fraction. 0.288 = 288/1000. Simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 8. 288 ÷8=36, 1000 ÷8=125. So 36/125.

Yes, that's correct. So, the probability is 36/125.

Looking at the options, option B is 36/125, so that's my answer.

The problem involves finding the joint probability \( P(0.5 < X_1 < 1 \text{ and } 0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) \) for independent random variables \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) with given probability density functions.

1. **Joint PDF**: Since \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent, the joint PDF is the product of their individual PDFs:
   \[
   f(x_1, x_2) = f_1(x_1) \cdot f_2(x_2) = 2x_1 \cdot 4x_2^3 = 8x_1x_2^3
   \]

2. **Compute \( P(0.5 < X_1 < 1) \)**:
   \[
   \int_{0.5}^{1} 2x_1 \, dx_1 = \left[ x_1^2 \right]_{0.5}^{1} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
   \]

3. **Compute \( P(0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) \)**:
   \[
   \int_{0.4}^{0.8} 4x_2^3 \, dx_2 = \left[ x_2^4 \right]_{0.4}^{0.8} = 0.8^4 - 0.4^4 = 0.4096 - 0.0256 = 0.384
   \]

4. **Joint Probability**:
   \[
   P(0.5 < X_1 < 1 \text{ and } 0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) = 0.75 \times 0.384 = 0.288
   \]

5. **Fraction over 125**:
   \[
   0.288 = \frac{36}{125}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is **B: \(\frac{36}{125}\)**.
