Question:

Explain how the MC = MR rule can be applied to the hiring of laborin a perfectly competitive market.

Options:

A: Firms hire an unlimited number of workers as long as they contribute any positive amount to total revenue.
B: In a perfectly competitive market, firms don't hire workers based on MRC = MRP rule.
C: MRC = MRP for labor and a firm will pay each worker a wage equal to the MRP of the last worker hired.
D: Firms hire workers until the wage rate is equal to the average cost of labor.
E: Firms hire workers based on a fixed wage, regardless of marginal revenue or marginal costs.
F: Firms pay each worker a wage equal to the total revenue of the company.
G: Marginal revenue product of labor is ignored, and firms focus on minimizing the average cost of labor per worker.
H: Firms hire workers until the marginal cost of labor exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor.
I: Each worker's wage is set by the average revenue product of all workers combined.
J: MRC = MRP and firms pay each worker a wage higher than the MRP of the last worker hired.

Okay, so I've got this question about the MC = MR rule and how it applies to hiring labor in a perfectly competitive market. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through this.

First, I remember that in a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price taker. That means they can't set their own price; the price is determined by the market. So, the firm's revenue is based on the price set by the market.

Now, the question is about the rule MC = MR. MC stands for Marginal Cost, which is the additional cost of hiring one more worker. MR, on the other hand, is the Marginal Revenue, which is the additional revenue from hiring one more worker. 

In a perfectly competitive market, MR is equal to the market price because each additional worker adds revenue equal to the price. So, MR is P, the price of the product. 

Then, the rule says MC should equal MR. So, the firm will hire workers as long as the additional cost of hiring another worker (MC) is less than or equal to the revenue it brings in (MR). Once MR is less than MC, the firm stops hiring because it's not profitable to do so anymore. 

So, let's think about each option:

Option A: Firms hire an unlimited number of workers as long as they contribute any positive amount to total revenue. Hmm, this doesn't sound right. If the MC is higher than MR, you stop. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Firms don't hire workers based on MRC = MRP. No, that's the opposite. The rule is that they do. So B is incorrect.

Option C: MRC = MRP for labor, and wage is equal to MRP. Wait, MRP is the marginal revenue product, which is MR times MP (marginal product). So in a perfectly competitive market, since MR is P, MRP becomes P*MP. The firm's wage is set by the marginal revenue the firm can get from each additional worker. But wait, in a perfectly competitive market, the firm's average revenue per unit is P, so the wage should equal the MRP. So the firm pays each worker a wage equal to the MRP. So option C says wage equals MRP. So this seems correct. But I'm not sure if it's the correct way to state it.

Option D: Hire workers until wage equals average cost. Wait, no. The rule is about MC = MR, not about average cost. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Firms pay a fixed wage regardless of MR or MC. No, the wage depends on the MR, so E is wrong.

Option F: Pay each worker based on total revenue. No, wage is set by MRP, not total revenue. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Marginal revenue product is ignored, focus on minimizing average cost. That's not right. The rule is about equating MC and MR, not about minimizing average cost. So G is incorrect.

Option H: MRC = MR, so hire workers until MRC > MRP. Or wait, the rule is when MRC (which is equal to MR) is greater than MRP, the firm stops. So the condition is when MC (which is MRC) exceeds MRP, the firm stops. So H says MRC > MRP, correct. So H is correct.

Option I: Each worker's wage is average revenue product. No, the wage is set by MRP, not the average. So I is incorrect.

Option J: MRC = MRP, wage higher than MRP. No, because when MRC equals MRP, the firm is indifferent between hiring another worker or not. So the wage would be equal to MRP. So J is incorrect.

Wait, looking back at the options, option H says "Firms hire workers until the marginal cost of labor exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor." Which matches our understanding. So H is correct.

Wait, but I thought the correct condition is that the MC (marginal cost) is less than or equal to MR (marginal revenue). So when MC > MR, you stop. So when MRC (MC) is greater than MRP (MR), the firm stops hiring. So H is correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option H: "Firms hire workers until the marginal cost of labor exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor." Yes, that's exactly the condition. So H is correct.

Wait, but I remember sometimes that in perfectly competitive markets, the MR is the market price, and the MRP is P multiplied by MP. So the condition is that the marginal cost (MC) must be less than or equal to the MRP. So when MRC (MC) > MRP, the firm stops. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but let me make sure. The rule is MC = MR. So when MR (which is P) is higher than MC, the firm should stop. So the correct statement is that the firm hires workers until MC exceeds MR, which is the same as until MC > MRP.

So the correct option is H.

The question asks how the MC = MR rule applies to hiring labor in a perfectly competitive market. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Firms do not hire an unlimited number of workers because, at some point, the additional cost (MC) exceeds the additional revenue (MR), leading to profit maximization.

- **Option B**: Incorrect. The rule explicitly states that firms hire workers based on the equality of MC and MR, not ignoring MRC and MRP.

- **Option C**: Correct. In a perfectly competitive market, the marginal revenue (MR) equals the market price (P), and the marginal revenue product (MRP) is the product of the marginal product (MP) and MR. Firms hire workers until the wage rate (w) equals the MRP, which is the additional revenue generated by the last worker hired.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. The rule does not involve minimizing average cost; it focuses on equating marginal cost and marginal revenue.

- **Option E**: Incorrect. Firms do not pay a fixed wage; the wage rate is determined by the MR of the last worker.

- **Option F**: Incorrect. Firms do not pay based on total revenue; the wage is set by the marginal revenue product.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. The rule focuses on equating MC and MR, not on ignoring MRP.

- **Option H**: Correct. Firms hire workers until the marginal cost of labor exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor, ensuring profitability.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. The wage is set by the MRP, not the average revenue product.

- **Option J**: Incorrect. When MC equals MRP, the firm is indifferent between hiring another worker or stopping, so the wage equals MRP.

The correct answer is **H**: Firms hire workers until the marginal cost of labor exceeds the marginal revenue product of labor.

**ANSWER: H**
