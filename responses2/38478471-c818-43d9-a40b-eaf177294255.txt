Okay, so I've got this question here about the North Star, Polaris, when you're traveling north from the US into Canada. Hmm, I remember that the North Star is a big thing in navigation, but I'm not exactly sure how it behaves when you're moving across the sky. Let me think this through.

First, I know that the North Star is always in the sky, but how does it move when you're moving north towards Canada? So, when you're in the US, you're on the east side, and moving north towards Canada, you're moving towards the west. Wait, no, wait—Canada is to the west of the US. So, when you're in the US and moving north, you're moving west towards Canada.

Wait, the North Star is more about the direction you're facing. So, when you are facing north, the North Star will be in the east. But as you move north, you're changing your heading. So, for example, when you're in the US, the North Star is in a certain position. If you turn north and cross over into Canada, what happens to it?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about how the North Star rises and sets. I remember that Polaris is not stationary. It moves east and west with the Earth's rotation. So, when you're in the US, Polaris is in the east. But as you move north towards Canada, Polaris will appear to move west, because the Earth is rotating beneath it. Wait, but that's when it's west of the prime meridian. Wait, no—if you're moving north, you're moving towards the west, so Polaris will rise higher in the west. Or does it? Or does it move west each day?

Wait, I think the North Star appears to move west each day, but its position relative to the sky changes. So, when you're in the US, Polaris is in the east. As you move north, it moves west. So, if you're in the US and turn north, Polaris would be moving west, but it's still the same star, just its position in the sky is changing. So, when you're moving north, Polaris would be higher in the west.

Wait, but in the question, it's about what happens to it as you move north. So, when you're in the US, Polis is east. When you move north, you're moving towards the west, so Polis is moving west each day. So, in the evening, when you're crossing into Canada, Polis would be in the west. But wait, the question is about the movement as you move north. So, when you're moving north, the star is moving west each day. So, its position in the sky is moving west each time you face north.

Wait, but the question is about the last character of the answer, which is the answer itself. The options are about what the last character is. So, the question says, "you’ll see the North Star getting _________."

The options are A to J. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: Higher in the sky
B: More to the East
C: Closer
D: Changing color
E: More to the West
F: Further away
G: Brighter
H: Lower in the sky
I: Disappearing from sight
J: Dimmer

Wait, the question is about what happens to the North Star as you move north from the US into Canada. So, when you're in the US, the North Star is in the east. When you move north, you're heading west. So, as you move, the North Star will appear to move west each day, but I think the correct way to look at it is that the North Star doesn't move in the sky. It's the Earth that's rotating, so Polaris moves west each day. But in terms of its position relative to the sky, when you're facing north, it's in the east, but as you move north, the star is moving west. So, when you're in Canada, which is west of the US, the star would be in the west.

Wait, but the question is what happens to it as you move north. So, when you start in the US, the star is in the east. As you move north, the star is moving west. So, the star is not getting higher; it's moving west. So, in the evening, when you're in Canada, the star is in the west. But the options don't have 'Lower in the sky' as the answer, but option H is 'Lower in the sky.' Wait, no, the options are:

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A: Higher in the sky
B: More to the East
C: Closer
D: Changing color
E: More to the West
F: Further away
G: Brighter
H: Lower in the sky
I: Disappearing from sight
J: Dimmer

Wait, the question is about the movement of the star as you move north from the US into Canada. So, when you're moving north, the star appears to move west each day, but its position in the sky is changing. So, when you're in the US, it's in the east, and when you move north, it's moving west. So, in the evening, when you're in Canada, the star is in the west. But the question is about what happens when you move north. So, the star's position in the sky is moving west.

Wait, but the options are about what the star does. So, when you're moving north, the star moves west each day. So, the correct answer is that it moves west, which is option E.

Alternatively, wait, when you're moving from the US to Canada, which is west. So, the star is moving west each day. So, if you were to track it, when you're in the US, it's east; as you move north, it's moving west. So, the star is moving west each day.

Wait, but the question is about the movement. So, when you go north, the star moves west. So, the correct answer would be E: More to the West.

Wait, wait, but when you're facing north, the star is in the east. So, as you move north, the star shifts west each day. So, in the evening, when you're in Canada, the star is in the west. So, the star is moving west, but the options are about what the star is doing. So, in the answer, the last character is the choice.

Wait, but the options are all about the star's position or behavior. So, when you're moving north, the star's position in the sky is moving west. So, the star is moving west each day.

So, looking at the options:

E: More to the West

H: Lower in the sky

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The North Star is a point in the sky that doesn't change its position relative to the Earth's rotation. So, when you're facing north, it's in the east. But when you move north, you're moving west, so the star moves west each day. So, in the evening, when you're in Canada, the star is in the west.

But the options are about the behavior as you move north. So, as you move north, the star is moving west. So, the star is moving west, which is option E. But I'm not sure if the movement is 'getting' higher or more to the west.

Wait, another approach: the North Star is in the sky, and as you move north, it appears to move west each day. So, when you're moving north, the star's position in the sky is moving west. So, the star is not getting higher, it's moving west. So, the correct answer is that it's moving west, which is option E.

Wait, but when you're moving north, the star is moving west each day. So, the answer would be E: More to the West.

Wait, but earlier I thought the star is moving west each day, but there's another point. Wait, when you are moving north, the star is always in the west. So, in the evening, when you're in Canada, the star is in the west. So, the star is moving west each day.

So, the correct answer is E: More to the West.

Alternatively, wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Because when you're moving north, the star's position in the sky is moving west each day. So, the star is moving west each day, but its position is changing from east to west.

So, in terms of what is happening, the star is moving west each day. So, the answer is E: More to the West.

Wait, but wait, when you're moving from the US to Canada, the star is moving west each day. So, the direction of the star in the sky is changing.

Wait, but the options are about what the star does, not the direction. So, the star is moving west each day, so the answer is E.

Wait another point: when you're in the US, the star is in the east. When you move north, the star is moving west. So, when you're in Canada, the star is in the west, but that's because the star itself is moving. So, the star isn't disappearing from sight or anything. It's moving.

So, the correct answer is E: More to the West.

Wait, but another way to think: the North Star was in the east when you were in the US, but as you move north, the star is moving west. So, in the evening, when you're in Canada, the star is in the west. But the question is about what is happening as you move north. So, the star's position in the sky is changing.

So, the answer is that the star is moving west each day, so the correct option is E: More to the West.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the options are not all about movement. Some options are about position.

Wait, looking again, let me read the options again:

A: Higher in the sky

B: More to the East

C: Closer

D: Changing color

E: More to the West

F: Further away

G: Brighter

H: Lower in the sky

I: Disappearing from sight

J: Dimmer

So, the question is about what happens when you're moving north into Canada. So, the star's position in the sky is moving west each day. So, the correct option is E: More to the West.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. I think the correct answer is that the North Star is moving west each day, so the correct answer is E.

Wait, but another thought: the star is in the east when you're in the US. As you move north, it's moving west. So, when you're in Canada, the star is in the west. So, the star is moving west, but the answer here is E because it's more to the west.

Hmm, I think I've got it. So, the correct answer is E: More to the West.
