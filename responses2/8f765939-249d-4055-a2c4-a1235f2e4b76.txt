Okay, so I'm trying to solve this predicate logic problem. The question is about translating the statement "Alexis is greeted by Ben" using the given symbols. Let me break it down.

First, the symbols are defined as:
- a: Alexis
- b: Ben
- Gxy: x greets y

The statement is "Alexis is greeted by Ben." So, Alexis is being greeted by Ben. 

In predicate logic, the statement "Alexis is greeted by Ben" can be translated. Let's see: "gripped by" is a relation, so G is the predicate. So, Alexis is the subject, Ben is the object. So, it's G applied to Alexis and Ben. 

Wait, wait. Wait, the way the statement is phrased is "Alexis is greeted by Ben." So, the subject is Alexis, and it's being greeted by Ben. So, in predicate logic, that would be G_ab, which is G applied to a and b. So the predicate is G, the object is Alexis (a), and the subject is Ben (b). 

So, G(ab) is the same as G(a, b). But looking at the options, option J is Ga/b, which is a bit confusing because it's written as Ga/b. Wait, maybe J is G(a, b), but written as Ga/b. Alternatively, let me make sure.

Looking at the options:

A: G(ab)
B: aGb
C: aGba
D: ~Gba
E: Gba
F: Gaa
G: Gab
H: Gb~a
I: Gbb
J: Ga/b

So, the correct translation should be G(a, b) which is G(ab) because Gxy is x greets y, so G(a, b) means Alexis greets Ben. So that's option A: G(ab) or G(a,b).

Wait, but looking at option J: Ga/b. Hmm. Wait, Ga/b might be intended as G(a, b), but written as Ga/b, perhaps with a slash. Alternatively, maybe it's a different notation. But G(a, b) is the same as G(ab). So, option A is G(ab), which is correct.

Wait, but looking at option J: Ga/b. Maybe Ga/b represents G(a, b), but the way it's written is Ga/b, which could be a function notation, but in predicate logic, Ga/b would imply that a is the subject and b is the object. So, Ga/b is the same as G(a, b). But in predicate logic, Ga/b might not be standard notation. Wait, perhaps it's G(a, b), which is option A.

Wait, another way: Let me parse each option. Option A is G(ab), which is G(a, b), correct. Option J is Ga/b, which is G(a, b) written as Ga/b. So, Ga/b is equivalent to G(a, b). So both A and J seem correct. But wait, no—probably Ga/b is the same as G(a, b) because it's a single term.

Wait, but Ga/b would be if the order is a then b, which is the same as G(a, b). So, Ga/b is the same as G(a,b), which is the same as G(ab) when written as a string. So, both A and J would be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, looking again: The options are A through J. Let me re-examine each.

Wait, the options are:

A: G(ab) → G(a, b)
B: aGb → aG b, which would be a G b, i.e., Alexis greets Ben? No, because that would be G(a, b), not aGb. Wait, no, because the predicate G is applied to two arguments, so aGb would mean a is the subject, G is the predicate, and b is the object. So that would be interpreted as G(a, b) but written as aGb. So that's not correct.

Wait, no. Wait, in predicate logic, the standard way is to write Gxy as xG y, meaning x is the subject, y is the object. So, aGb would translate to G(a, b), but written as aGb. So that would be different from G(a, b) which is ab, but written as G(ab). So, G(a, b) is G(ab), which is option A. So option J is Ga/b, which would be like G(a, b). So, both A and J seem correct, but I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the notation. In formal logic, when you have a subject and an object, it's written as G(s, o), where s is the subject and o the object. So G(a, b) is Alexis greets Ben, which is what we want. So, option A is G(ab) which is the same as G(a, b). So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking at option J: Ga/b. So, Ga/b would translate to G(a, b), but written as Ga/b. So that's also correct. But wait, is Ga/b a standard notation? Or is it possible that Ga/b is G(a, b), but the way it's presented is as G(a) and then b, which would be G(a, b). So, Ga/b is the same as G(a, b). So, both A and J seem correct, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, now I'm getting confused because I thought the correct option is A. Alternatively, perhaps J is the correct answer because Ga/b is the same as G(a, b), but written in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

The options are:

A: G(ab) → G(a, b)
B: aGb → G(a, b) written as aGb, which is incorrect because it's G(a, b) but in a different order.
Wait, no: aGb would be G(a, b), which is correct. Because a is the subject, G is the predicate, and b is the object.

Wait, no, that would mean that the entire "aGb" is a predicate application. So, G(a, b) is the same as aGb, because a is the subject, G is the predicate, and b is the object. So, aGb is G(a, b) as well.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, in standard predicate logic, Ga b would be G(a, b). So, aGb is just a way of writing G(a, b). So, Ga b is a different way of writing G(a, b).

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let's approach it differently.

The correct translation is G(a, b), which is Alexis greets Ben, so that's G(ab) because a and b are the arguments.

Looking at the options:

A: G(ab) → correct.

B: aGb → which is G(a, b), which is same as aGb, which is the same as G(a, b), which is correct.

Wait, but wait, the options are presented as:

A: G(ab)
B: aGb
C: aGba
D: ~Gba
E: Gba
F: Gaa
G: Gab
H: Gb~a
I: Gbb
J: Ga/b

So, Ga/b is the same as G(a, b), which is correct. So both A and J seem correct. But that can't be, because each option is a different translation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the options.

Let me read the options again.

Option J is Ga/b. So, Ga/b is G(a, b). So that's correct.

Option A is G(ab) → same as G(a, b). So, A and J both seem correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps Ga/b is not the same as G(a, b). Maybe Ga/b is G(a, b) with a slash, but that's just the same as G(a, b).

Wait, but perhaps Ga/b is a way of writing G(a, b) as G(a, b) without a space, so it's the same.

But let's think about the options. The correct answer is option A, because Ga/b is G(a, b), which is the same as G(ab). So perhaps both A and J are correct. But no, because the options can't have two correct answers, so maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the predicate is Gxy, which is x greets y.

So, Alexis is a, Ben is b.

So, Alexis is greeted by Ben → G(a, b) is correct, which is G(ab) when written as G(a, b).

So, the correct answer is option A: G(ab).

Wait, but then why is Ga/b an option? Because Ga/b is the same as G(a, b). So, Ga/b is correct, but Ga/b is also correct. So, both A and J are correct. But that can't be because the options are unique.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me double-check.

Option J: Ga/b. So, that would be G(a, b), which is correct.

So, both A and J would be correct, but that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps Ga/b is not the same as G(a, b). Maybe Ga/b is a different notation. Maybe it's G(a, b) written as Ga/b, which is the same as G(a, b). So, both options A and J are correct.

But the options can't have both A and J as correct, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: G(ab) → G(a, b)
B: aGb → G(a, b)
C: aGba → G(a, b) (since it's a followed by Gba, which is G(b, a))
D: ~Gba → not correct.
E: Gba → G(b, a), which is incorrect.
F: Gaa → G(a, a), incorrect.
G: Gab → G(a, b)
H: Gb~a → incorrect.
I: Gbb → G(b, b), incorrect.
J: Ga/b → G(a, b)

Wait, so both A and B are G(a, b), but Ga/b is J, and B is aGb, which is same as G(a, b). So, A is correct, and J is correct. But that can't be right because each option is a separate possibility.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting Ga/b.

Wait, Ga/b would be G(a, b) but written in a different way, perhaps with a slash separating a and b, but in predicate logic, that's not a standard notation. So Ga/b is same as G(a, b), which is correct.

So, both A and J are correct. But that's impossible, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, and J is a typo or something. Or perhaps Ga/b is not the same as G(a, b).

Wait, perhaps Ga/b is G(a,b), which is correct, but Ga/b is written with a slash, but that's not standard. So, Ga/b is same as G(a, b), so J is correct.

Wait, but in that case, both A and J are correct, which can't happen. So perhaps J is a typo, and the intended correct answer is A.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think another way.

The correct translation is G(a, b), which is G(ab). So, the correct option is A.

Option J is Ga/b which is same as G(a, b), so it's also correct. But in the options, both A and J are correct, which is not possible. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps Ga/b is G(a, b) written as G(a, b). So, option J is correct.

But wait, the options are:

A: G(ab) → correct.
J: Ga/b → same as G(a, b) → correct.

So, both A and J are correct, but that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps Ga/b is a different way of writing G(a, b). For example, maybe Ga/b is G(a, b) but with a slash, which is not a standard notation. So Ga/b is same as G(a, b), but perhaps Ga/b is written as G(a, b) without a space, which is same as G(a, b). So, J is correct.

So, the correct answers are both A and J. But that's impossible because each option is unique. So perhaps the correct answer is A, and J is incorrect because Ga/b is not the same. Alternatively, perhaps Ga/b is not the standard notation.

Wait, no, Ga/b is the same as G(a, b). So, J is correct. So, the options allow both A and J as correct, but each is a separate option. So, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer, so the intended correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps Ga/b is written as G(a, b), so J is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct translation is G(ab), which is option A, so the answer is A.
</think>

The correct translation of "Alexis is greeted by Ben" into predicate logic is "G(a, b)" or "G(ab)". Among the options, option A is G(ab), which accurately represents Alexis (a) being greeted by Ben (b). Option J, Ga/b, is also correct in terms of notation but is redundant as Ga/b is the same as G(ab). Since the question likely expects the most straightforward and direct translation, the answer is:

ANSWER: A
