Okay, so I've got this question about combinational PLDs and the options given. Let me think about what I remember from my digital electronics class.

The question is asking what a combinational PLD with a fixed AND array and programmable OR array is called. The options are A through I, with choices like ROM, FPGA, PLD, etc.

Wait, I think PLD might stand for Programmed Logic Array, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me break it down. A PLD is a type of logic circuit, right? It's called a programmable logic device. There are different types of PLDs, like PLAs (Programmed Logical Arrays) and PLAs (Programmed Array Logic), and PLDs (Programmable Logic Devices) which are more general.

PLAs have a fixed array of minterms and an OR array, but I'm not sure if they're programmable in this case. Oh wait, the question says it's a fixed AND array and a programmable OR array. That sounds more like a PLD because PLDs combine both AND and OR operations, and they're programmable, which means the OR part can be changed.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, a PLD usually has a fixed part (like the AND array) and a programmable part (the OR array). So it's a programmable logic array. But looking at the options, I don't see PLD as one of the choices. Hmmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The options are A: ROM, B: FPGA, C: PLA, D: PLD, E: EEPROM, F: PAL, G: RAM, H: PROM, I: CPLD, J: ASIC.

Wait, the question describes a combinational PLD. So what's the difference between PLA and PLD? Oh, right, a PLA is a PLD with a fixed array of minterms (AND) and a programmable OR array. But a PLD might have both fixed and programmable parts, but I think the term PLD is broader than PLA.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me recall. A PLD is a type of combinational logic circuit that can be programmed. It's called a programmable logic device, but I believe it's also known as a PLA (Programmed Logic Array) when it's only programmable in the OR part. Wait, no, no. PLAs have both fixed AND and programmable OR. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, I think a PLD is a more general term that includes both PLAs and PLAs with a programmable AND array. Because the question mentions a fixed AND array and a programmable OR array, which is typical of a PLD.

Wait, but looking at the choices, option D is PLD. So the correct answer should be D: PLD.

Wait, but let me think about other options. What's a PLA? It's a PLD with a fixed AND array and a programmable OR array. So if the question is about a PLD, which is the more general term, then the answer is D.

The other options: ROM is read-only memory, which is static. FPGA is field-programmable gate array, which can be programmed in both AND and OR areas. PLA is a specific type of PLD with a fixed AND array and programmable OR. PLA and PLD are both PLD types, but PLD is a more general term. PLAs are a specific case, but PLDs are the broader name.

So the answer should be D: PLD.

The question asks what a combinational PLD with a fixed AND array and programmable OR array is called. A PLD is a programmable logic device that can be programmed to include both fixed AND and programmable OR arrays. Among the options provided, the correct term is **D: PLD**.

Answer: D
