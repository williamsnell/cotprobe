Okay, so I've got this question about moral theories and how they view the moral standing of nonhuman animals. Hmm, let's think. The question is asking from which moral theory Carruthers approaches the topic. The options are A to J, each a different theory.

First, I should probably remember what each of these theories considers about animals, especially nonhuman ones. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Relativism. I think relativism is about the standards people have to follow as they view the world. But I'm not sure how it applies to nonhuman animals. They might be treated as lesser or greater, but relativism seems more about the ethical standards existing in the world, not the specific cases.

Option B: Consequentialism. That's about actions leading to consequences and evaluating based on what's right because of the results. It's about the outcomes of actions, so maybe animals are treated based on what their actions would cause. I think this theory would probably view animals similarly to humans, placing them in a moral hierarchy based on their actions.

Option C: Natural Law Theory. This one is about the law being created by God to govern the universe. I don't think it focuses on individual animals, more on the laws that apply to all, which might include humans but not specific entities.

Option D: Egoism. This is a form of relativism, right? It's about the self as the one who should be treated as the final cause. So, nonhuman animals are probably placed in the same hierarchy as humans based on their moral standing.

Option E: Kantianism. That's about the moral universe being a product of God's will and therefore an absolute standard. It's a strict moral framework, so nonhuman animals would be treated as part of that framework.

Option F: Utilitarianism. This is about the best interests of the greatest good, so it looks at consequences. So, animals would be evaluated based on their actions and outcomes.

Option G: Deontological. This is similar to natural law, focusing on duties and moral codes. It doesn't deal with the consequences of actions but rather what is right or wrong according to moral rules.

Option H: Contractualism. This is about obligations and what one must do. It might treat animals within that framework, but I'm not sure if it specifically addresses their moral standing in a way that's unique.

Option I: Existentialism. This is about the individual's self and the good they have. It's more about personal well-being and individual moral choices, not specifically about the moral hierarchy of other entities.

Option J: Virtue ethics. This is about character and virtues influencing behavior. It's more about how people behave based on their character, not about the moral status of other entities.

So, the question is about nonhuman animals. Relativism and utilitarianism focus on the outcomes of actions, so maybe treating them as part of a bigger system. Kantianism would have them as products of God's will. Egoism and deontological would treat them as part of a larger moral framework.

Wait, the question says Carruthers approaches from the perspective of which theory. I'm trying to recall if there's a theory that specifically treats nonhuman animals in a certain way. I think natural law theory might focus on laws and the universe, while Kantianism is about a moral universe.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is about natural law because the question is about the moral standing of animals. Or maybe it's about deontological because it's about the rightness of actions. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the last character of the answer, so the answer must be a letter. For example, if option F is the answer, the last letter is F, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, looking back, the question is about the moral standing of nonhuman animals. So, which theories are there that address their moral status?

Relativism and Utilitarianism are more about the consequences of actions and the greatest good. Deontological focuses on the rightness of actions. Egoism and deontological treat animals similarly.

Kantianism would treat them as products of God's will, so they would be placed in the same hierarchy as humans.

Wait, but the question is about who approaches the moral standing from. So, perhaps the answer is Kantianism? Because it's a theory about the moral universe being a product of God's will. So, in that case, the last character of the answer would be K, but that's not an option. Wait, the options are A to J, so the last letter of the answer (the letter) must be the one given.

Wait, the question says, "from the perspective of which of the following moral theories?" So, if the answer is Kantianism, then the letter is K. But wait, none of the options are K. The options are A to J, which are relativism, consequentialism, etc.

Wait, no, the options are A to J, and the question is which theory is it. So the correct answer would be one of these letters.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. The question is about the last character of the answer, which must be the letter. So, for example, if the correct answer is E (Kantianism), the letter is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F (utilitarianism). But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another approach: I recall that in some theories, nonhuman animals are treated as part of the moral hierarchy. For example, in deontological ethics, they are considered part of the principle of rightness, but in natural law, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is deontological, because it's about duties and the rightness of actions, so perhaps they are considered part of the moral framework.

Wait, but the question is about the perspective of a moral theory. So, which of these theories would approach it that way.

Wait, natural law theory talks about the creation of laws by God, so perhaps it's not about the moral standing of nonhuman animals, but about the laws that apply. So maybe not.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is F, Utilitarianism, because it looks at the consequences of actions. But from which theory? Or perhaps F is the answer, but that's not an option for the answer letter.

Wait, the options are A through J, and the question is, "which of the following moral theories?" So, the answer is the letter corresponding to the theory. So, if the correct theory is Kantianism, the letter is E. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E (Kantianism). Because in Kantianism, all humans and nonhuman animals are placed in the same moral hierarchy, under the authority of God. So, their moral status is determined by their place in the universe as created by God.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another thought: some theories might treat animals differently. For example, deontological ethics might treat them as part of the framework, but perhaps they're more about duties than the outcomes of actions.

Wait, maybe the answer is E, Kantianism. So, the letter would be E.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, Utilitarianism. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the question differently. The question is about which theory Carruthers approaches the moral standing of nonhuman animals from. So, the reason for that is the theory's account of the universe and its moral framework.

Kantianism is about the universe as God's creation, so it would place all entities, including nonhuman animals, in the same moral hierarchy. So, the last letter of option E is E, but the correct letter would be E.

So, the answer is E, which would correspond to the letter E.

The question asks which moral theory Carruthers approaches the moral standing of nonhuman animals from. To determine this, we analyze each option:

- **Relativism (A)**: Focuses on the moral standards existing in the world, not specific cases like nonhuman animals.
- **Consequentialism (B)**: Evaluates actions based on their outcomes, applicable to nonhuman animals.
- **Natural Law Theory (C)**: Deals with laws created by God, not the moral status of specific entities.
- **Egoism (D)**: A form of relativism, treating individuals (including nonhuman animals) based on their self-interest.
- **Kantianism (E)**: Views the universe as God's creation, placing all entities, including nonhuman animals, in a moral framework.
- **Utilitarianism (F)**: Focuses on the greatest good, applicable to evaluating nonhuman animals based on their actions.
- **Deontological (G)**: Treats entities as part of a moral framework, similar to natural law.
- **Contractualism (H)**: Focuses on obligations, which might apply to nonhuman animals.
- **Existentialism (I)**: Concerns self-preservation and well-being, not the moral status of other entities.
- **Virtue Ethics (J)**: Focuses on character and virtues, not the moral framework.

Kantianism (E) is the most fitting theory as it creates a moral universe where all entities, including nonhuman animals, are treated by God. Thus, the letter corresponding to this theory is **E**.

**Answer: E**
