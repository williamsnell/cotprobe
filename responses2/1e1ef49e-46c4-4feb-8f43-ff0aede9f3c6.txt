Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about equilibrium constants. Hmm, I think I remember that equilibrium constants depend on the concentrations of the products and reactants. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The reaction is A + B ⇌ C + D. The first part of the question says that 0.7 moles of C are formed when 1 mole each of A and B are initially present. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, initial moles of A and B are 1 each, so that's 1 mol each, and 0.7 mol of C formed. Oh wait, but since it's a 1:1 reaction, the moles of D formed would also be 0.7, right? Because for every mole of A and B that reacts, a mole of C and D is formed.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The initial amounts are 1 mole A and 1 mole B. The change would be something like, let's say, x moles of A and B react to form x moles of C and D. But the problem says 0.7 moles of C are formed. So x is 0.7. So, the change is -x for A and B, and +x each for C and D. So, initial concentrations would be, assuming volume is 1L, [A] = 1 M, [B] = 1 M, [C] = 0, [D] = 0.

At equilibrium, [A] = 1 - x = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 M. Similarly, [B] is 0.3 M. [C] is 0.7 M, [D] is 0.7 M.

Wait, but then the question says, for this same equilibrium, find the equilibrium composition when 1 mole each of A, B, C, and D are initially present. Oh, so the initial concentrations are [A] = [B] = [C] = [D] = 1 M each.

Wait, but the reaction is A + B ⇌ C + D. So, each mole of A and B reacting produces a mole of C and D. So, in the initial state (1 M each), if all of them react, what happens?

Wait, but in the first part, when 0.7 moles of C are formed, that's when x is 0.7. So, in the first case, the concentrations are A=0.3, B=0.3, C=0.7, D=0.7.

Wait, but the equilibrium constant K can be calculated for the first scenario. Let me calculate K.

K = [C][D]/([A][B]) = (0.7)(0.7)/(0.3)(0.3) = (0.49)/(0.09) ≈ 5.444... So, approximately 5.444. Hmm, looking at the options, option F is K=5.44, [A]=0.6, [B]=0.6, [C]=1.4, [D]=1.4. Wait, that's a bit different. Because 1.4 is higher than 0.7, but maybe that's the same as x=0.7, but no—wait, actually, the initial condition in the first part is when 1 mole each of A and B are present. So, in the first part, x=0.7, so [C] and [D] are 0.7 each, as I thought.

Wait, but the first part's K is 5.444... Looking at the options, option F has K=5.44, [A]=0.6, [B]=0.6, [C]=1.4, [D]=1.4. So, that's a different scenario, but perhaps not. Maybe I should calculate K for the first case, then use that K to solve the second part.

Wait, but the second part asks for the equilibrium composition when 1 mole each of A, B, C, D are initially present. So, initial concentrations are [A]=[B]=[C]=[D]=1 M.

The reaction is A + B ↔ C + D. So, let's set up an ICE table.

Initial concentrations:
A: 1
B: 1
C: 1
D: 1

Change: Let's say that 's' moles of A and B react, producing 's' of C and D. So,

At equilibrium:
A: 1 - s
B: 1 - s
C: 1 + s
D: 1 + s

But wait, wait, but when you have 1 mole each, if all of them react, s would be 1. But that would give [C] and [D] as 2 each, but that's probably not the case because the reaction is A + B ⇌ C + D, and the stoichiometry is 1:1:1:1.

Wait, but maybe the situation at the second part is that the reaction mixture is 1 mole each. So, let me proceed.

The equilibrium expression is K = [C][D]/([A][B]).

We calculated K from the first scenario as approximately 5.444. Let me recalculate that to be precise.

K = (0.7 * 0.7) / (0.3 * 0.3) = 0.49 / 0.09 = 5.444... So, K is 49/9 = 5.4444...

So, K = 49/9 = 5.444...

Now, in the second case, with initial concentrations all 1 M, we can set up the ICE table.

So, let's denote the change as 'x' moles (but wait, perhaps using x is not the best approach here. Let me think of it as y, but perhaps just let the change be 'y' for each reactant and product.

Wait, the initial concentrations are:

[A] = 1, [B]=1, [C]=1, [D]=1.

Change: Let's say the reaction proceeds to form 'y' moles of C and D, and consume 'y' moles of A and B.

So,

At equilibrium:
[A] = 1 - y
[B] = 1 - y
[C] =1 + y
[D] =1 + y

Wait, but for the reaction, each mole of A and B produces one mole of C and D. So, the change is correct.

But wait, when the reaction goes forward, the products increase, and the reactants decrease.

Now, the expression for K is:

K = ( [C][D] ) / ( [A][B] ) = ( (1+y)^2 ) / ( (1 - y)^2 ) )

We know that K is 49/9 (about 5.444).

So,

( (1 + y)^2 ) / ( (1 - y)^2 ) = 49/9

Take square roots on both sides:

(1 + y)/(1 - y) = sqrt(49/9) = 7/3.

So,

(1 + y)/(1 - y) = 7/3

Cross-multiplying:

3(1 + y) = 7(1 - y)

3 + 3y = 7 -7y

3y +7y =7 -3

10y=4

y= 4/10 = 0.4.

So, y=0.4.

Now, let's compute the concentrations at equilibrium.

[A] = 1 - y = 0.6 M

[B] = 1 - y = 0.6 M

[C] = 1 + y = 1.4 M

[D] = 1 + y = 1.4 M

So, the equilibrium concentrations are [A] = [B] = 0.6 M, [C] = [D] = 1.4 M.

Now, I need to look at the options to see which one has these concentrations and the same K.

Looking at the options:

Option F: K=5.44, [A] and [B]=0.6, [C] and [D]=1.4. So that matches.

Wait, but in the first part, the K was 5.444, and that's what option F also has. So, the same K applies to both scenarios? Or is the K same for both? Because the second scenario is a different starting point.

Wait, no. Because the first scenario is when 1 mole each of A and B are present. The second scenario is when 1 mole each of all are present. So, the K in the second scenario is calculated based on the initial conditions, which is 1 M each. So, in that case, with K=49/9, the equilibrium concentrations are [A]=[B]=0.6, [C]=[D]=1.4.

So looking at the options, option F says K=5.44, [A}=0.6, [B}=0.6, [C}=1.4, [D}=1.4. That's exactly what I found.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first scenario had K=5.444 which is 49/9. So, the second scenario's K is also 49/9, so the same K applies. So, in the second part, we calculate the equilibrium concentrations as 0.6 and 1.4.

So the correct answer must be option F.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction \( \text{A} + \text{B} \rightleftharpoons \text{C} + \text{D} \) based on the given conditions and then determine the equilibrium composition for the second scenario.

### First Scenario: 1 mole of A and 1 mole of B initially present
The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([A] = 0.3 \, \text{M}\), \([B] = 0.3 \, \text{M}\), \([C] = 0.7 \, \text{M}\), \([D] = 0.7 \, \text{M}\).

The equilibrium constant \( K \) is calculated as:
\[
K = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]} = \frac{(0.7)(0.7)}{(0.3)(0.3)} = \frac{0.49}{0.09} \approx 5.44.
\]

---

### Second Scenario: 1 mole each of A, B, C, and D initially present
The initial concentrations are:
- \([A] = [B] = [C] = [D] = 1 \, \text{M}\).

Let \( y \) represent the change in concentration of A and B, and \( y \) is also the concentration of C and D formed. The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([A] = [B] = 1 - y\),
- \([C] = [D] = 1 + y\).

The equilibrium constant \( K \) is given by:
\[
K = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]} = \frac{(1 + y)^2}{(1 - y)^2}.
\]
Since \( K = \frac{49}{9} \approx 5.444 \), we solve for \( y \):
\[
\frac{1 + y}{1 - y} = \frac{7}{3}.
\]
Cross-multiplying and solving:
\[
3(1 + y) = 7(1 - y) \implies 3 + 3y = 7 - 7y \implies 10y = 4 \implies y = 0.4.
\]

Substituting \( y = 0.4 \) into the equilibrium concentrations:
- \([A] = [B] = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 \, \text{M}\),
- \([C] = [D] = 1 + 0.4 = 1.4 \, \text{M}\).

---

### Final Answer
The equilibrium constant \( K \) is the same for both scenarios, \( K = 5.44 \), and the equilibrium concentrations for the second scenario are \( [A] = [B] = 0.6 \, \text{M} \) and \( [C] = [D] = 1.4 \, \text{M} \). This matches **Option F**.
