Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about rotational speed and angular momentum when a spinning system contracts without an external torque acting on it. Hmm, right.

So, angular momentum is a key concept here. I remember that angular momentum (L) is related to the moment of inertia (I) and the angular velocity (ω) by the equation L = I * ω. Oh wait, right, and when there's no external torque, angular momentum should be conserved. Because torque is the rate of change of angular momentum, and if torque is zero, angular momentum doesn't change.

The system is spinning, contracting—so the radius of rotation is decreasing. Let me think about how I changes when the radius changes. If the spinning object contracts, the distribution of mass is getting closer to the axis of rotation. Oh, right, the moment of inertia depends on the distribution of mass. For a point mass, I is m*r². So if r decreases, I decreases (assuming mass m stays the same). 

Wait, so if I decreases and L is conserved (since no external torque), then ω must increase because L is fixed. Because L = I * ω, if I goes down, ω must go up to keep L the same. So the rotational speed (angular speed) increases. 

Looking at the options, option G is 'increases'. So the answer should be G. Let me just make sure I'm not mixing this up with anything else. The system's angular momentum doesn't change because the torque is zero. So when I contracts, I decreases, leading to an increase in ω. Yeah, that makes sense.

When a spinning system contracts without an external torque, angular momentum is conserved because there is no torque acting on it. Angular momentum \( L \) is given by \( L = I \cdot \omega \), where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity. As the system contracts, the radius \( r \) decreases, and for a point mass, \( I = m \cdot r^2 \). Thus, \( I \) decreases. Since angular momentum is conserved, \( \omega \) must increase to compensate for the decrease in \( I \). 

The correct answer is that the rotational speed increases. 

**ANSWER: G**
