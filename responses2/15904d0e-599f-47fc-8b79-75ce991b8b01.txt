Okay, so I've got this question about nerves and the effects of severing their roots. Hmm, I remember that nerves have roots and a bulb. The roots are involved in sensation and motor control, right? The bulb is where the action potential is generated.

The question is about the consequences of severing either the dorsal root or the ventral root. The nerve leads to the leg, which is a part of the rat. So, when the roots are severed, what happens?

Wait, I think the roots are parts of the nerve that are responsible for transmitting signals. The ventral root is the part that's in the direction of the muscle fiber, which is where the movement happens. The dorsal root is the part that's in the direction of the sensory organs, like the sense hairs on the skin.

If the dorsal root is severed, that means the nerve can't send signals to the muscles, right? So, without the signal, the muscle wouldn't respond to the nerve's signals. So the effect would be loss of sensation because the nervous system can't send the necessary signals. But wait, the question is about the nerve leading to the leg. Does the nerve beyond the leg affect the movement? No, the leg's movement is controlled by the root that's attached to the muscle fiber. So if the root is severed, that part can't send signals, so the muscle can't contract. So the effect would be loss of sensation, but movement isn't possible. Or wait, maybe it's about the movement of the nerves leading to the leg. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, when the root is severed, the action potential can't flow. So the nerve stops sending signals, meaning the movement stops. But in terms of sensation, if the nerve can't send signals, the animal can't detect anything related to the nerve. So, for example, if the root is severed, the animal can't feel anything, like taste or touch.

Wait, but the question is about the rat's nervous system. So, if the root is severed, the nerve can't send signals to the muscles. So, the animal can't sense any sensation, because the nerve can't send the signal for the muscles. So, the sensation would be lost. But what about the reflex action? If the nerve can't send the signal, the reflex isn't triggered either.

Wait, the question is a bit different. It's about severing the roots. So, if the root is severed, then the nerve can't send signals, so the animal can't control its own movement. So, if the root is severed, the animal can't control anything, because the nerves can't send signals to the muscles.

Wait, but the question is about the effect when the roots are severed. So, for example, if the root is severed, maybe you lose movement. But what about sensation?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the functions of the roots and the bulb. The root is the part that's responsible for the signal transmission. The bulb is where the action happens, and the bulb is connected to the sense hairs on the skin.

So, if the root is severed (say, the ventral root), then the signal can't reach the muscle. So, the animal can't sense anything (because there's no signal to send the sensation). But wait, if the root is severed, the animal can't send a signal, so no sensation. But wait, no, the question is about what happens to the effect. So, if the root is severed, the animal can't send signals, so the sensation (like taste, touch) would be lost. But if the root is severed, the animal can't control its own muscles either. So, movement would stop.

Wait, the question is asking what the effect is when either the root is severed. So, in the case of the root being severed, the animal loses sensation, but if the root is in the direction of the muscle, it can't move.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A says both severing the roots cause increased sensation and reflex action. That can't be right because if you can't send signals, you lose sensation and reflex.

Option B says severing the dorsal root causes loss of motor function, severing the ventral causes enhanced sensation. I'm not sure. But actually, if the root is severed, you lose the motor function, meaning you can't move. So, motor function is lost. But how about the effect on sensation? If the root is severed, the animal can't receive signals, so there's no sensation either. So, option B might be incorrect because it says enhanced sensation.

Wait, no. If the root is severed, the animal can't receive any signals, so no sensation. So B's assertion that it causes enhanced sensation is wrong.

Option D: Severing the dorsal root causes enhanced movement, which doesn't make sense because you can't send signals. So that's wrong.

Option E: Severs the dorsal causes loss of sensation and reflex, and vice versa for ventral. Wait, if you sever the root, you lose reflex action. But what about sensation? The root is the part that's responsible for sending signals. So, without the signal, you can't sense anything. So, the effect would be loss of sensation and loss of reflex. But option E says loss of sensation and reflex action. Wait, no, because the question is about whether the root is the root for the muscle. So, maybe if the root is severed, the animal can't detect anything, so no sense, and no reflex.

Wait, but option E says that if you sever the root, you lose the reflex, but no about the sensation. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it this way: the nerve leading to the leg is part of the peripheral nervous system. If the root is severed, the animal can't send signals, so it can't control its own muscles, nor can it detect anything related to that nerve.

So, severing the root would lead to loss of both movement and sensation.

Looking at the options, option C says both severing the roots cause complete paralysis. Which means the animal can't perform any movement, and can't sense anything. So that's what I'm thinking.

Wait, but the options are A to J. So, let's see:

The question is about what the effect is when a root is severed. So, when you sever the root, the animal's ability to move and to detect anything is lost.

So, the options that say that are C and F. Option C is both cause complete paralysis. Option F is that severing the root causes loss of sensation, but nothing about reflex. But wait, if the root is severed, the animal can't respond to any signal, so no reflex action.

Wait, but the options should consider both effects. The question says, how would the effect vary if the root was severed. So, perhaps, for the first part (the root being the root for movement), and the second part (the root being the root for sensation).

Wait, perhaps the question is about the effect on the animal's ability to move and whether it can detect the nerve signals. So, if the root is severed, the animal can't sense anything, nor can it control its own muscles. So, for both movement and sensation, the animal loses the ability.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C: Both severing the roots causes complete paralysis. So, both movement and sensation are lost.

Option F: Se severing the root causes loss of sensation but nothing about movement. Which doesn't make sense because the root is responsible for both.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the effect on movement. So, if the root is severed, the animal can't move. So, the effect would be loss of movement. But what about sensation? If the root is severed, the animal can't receive any signals, so no sense. Thus, the effect is loss of both.

But looking at the options, option C says both cause complete paralysis. So, complete paralysis would mean movement and sensation are lost. So option C seems correct.

But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous in terms of which part it's severing. It says, "how will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?"

So, the question is about two scenarios: a) the root is severed (likely the ventral root) and b) the root is severed (the dorsal root).

Wait, but the question is not phrased correctly. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the question says: The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

The question is, "How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?"

Wait, perhaps the question is about the effect of severing each root, and how it affects the animal. So for the first part, if the root is severed, the animal's reflex and sensation are lost. For the second part, if the ventral root is severed, the animal can't sense the nerve signals, so movement is impaired, but perhaps sensation is lost. Or are they separate?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the effect on movement and on sensation.

Wait, another approach: The function of the root is to transmit signals from the nerve to the muscle. The bulb is where the action potential is generated. So, if the root is severed, the signal can't pass through, so the animal can't respond to the nerve's information.

So, if the root is severed (the ventral root), the animal can't sense the nerve signals, so it can't detect anything related to that nerve. So, in terms of movement, it can't move; in terms of sensation, it can't detect anything.

If the root is severed (the dorsal root), then the animal can't send signals, so it can't detect anything else. So, the animal's movement is not possible.

Thus, when either root is severed, the animal can't move (regardless of which root is severed), and can't detect anything. So, the effect is complete paralysis.

Wait, but why would option C say both cause complete paralysis. So, option C is correct.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: Both severing the roots cause complete paralysis. So, movement and sensation are both lost.

But wait, in the options, option C is 'both severing the roots cause complete paralysis of the affected part.' So, that's the correct statement.

Wait, but what about option E? Let me check.

Option E says: Severing the dorsal root causes loss of sensation and reflex action, severing the ventral root has no effect.

Wait, no. Because if the root is severed, the animal can't send signals. So, no reflex action would occur because the reflex is based on the signal from the root. Thus, if the root is severed, the animal can't respond to the reflex because it can't send the signal.

So, option E is incorrect because it says the ventral root has no effect, which is wrong because both would have the same effect.

So, back to the options. Let's re-examine each one.

Option A: Both severing the roots cause increased sensation and reflex action. No, because without signal, sensation and reflex would be lost.

Option B: Severing the dorsal causes loss of motor function, ventral causes enhanced sensation. No, because both would have the same effect, as both lack signal transmission.

Option C: Both cause complete paralysis. So yes, movement and sensation are lost.

Option D: Severing the dorsal causes enhanced movement, which is wrong.

Option E: Se severing the root causes loss of sensation and reflex, and the ventral has no effect. No, both would have the same issue.

Option F: Severing the root causes loss of sensation, ventral has no effect. No, both would lose the same.

Option G: Severing the root causes paralysis, ventral sensitivity. No, both would have the same effect.

Option H: Se severing the root causes involuntary twitching, ventral no. No, both would have same.

Option I: Se severing causes increased reflex, ventral no. No, same.

Option J: Se severing causes no effect, ventral paralysis. No.

So, only option C and option E or C.

Wait, but option C says both cause complete paralysis. So, the correct answer is C.

Wait, but no, let me think. Suppose I sever the ventral root. The animal can't detect the signal, but can it move? Without the signal, it can't respond to the muscle's movement. So, movement is impaired. But what about the reflex action? The reflex is based on the signal from the root. So if the root is severed, the reflex can't occur. So, the animal can't move, and can't perform reflex actions.

So, in effect, both severing the root causes loss of movement and reflex.

So, option C is correct.

Another way: When you sever the root, you lose both the ability to send signals and to receive them. So, if the root is in the direction of the muscle, you can't move. If the root is in the direction of the sensory part, you can't detect anything. So, both scenarios cause the animal to lose movement and sensation.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the effect on the movement. Let me read the options again.

The question is: How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?

So, the first part is about the effect when the root is severed. The second part is about the effect when the ventral root is severed.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about it.

When the root is severed (say, the ventral root), the animal can't send signals to the muscles. So, it can't move. So, movement is impaired.

When the root is severed (the dorsal root), the animal can't send signals to the sense hairs. So, no sense (sensation) is received.

So, both severing the root causes loss of movement and loss of sensation.

Looking at the options, option C says both cause complete paralysis. So, complete paralysis of the affected part. So, the animal cannot move, and cannot sense anything.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The question examines the effects of severing either the dorsal or ventral roots of a nerve leading to the leg in a rat. severed roots impair the animal's ability to detect or control its own movements. severed the root causes the animal to lose both movement and sensation, as the root is responsible for transmitting signals to the muscles and sense hairs.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. Seversing the root would not cause increased sensation or reflex action; instead, both would be lost.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. Seversing the root (either root) would not cause loss of motor function or enhanced sensation; both would be lost.
- **Option C:** Correct. Seversing either root completely paries the animal's ability to move and detect anything, leading to complete paralysis.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. Seversing the root does not cause increased motor function; both cannot respond to the nerve's signals.
- **Option E:** Incorrect. Seversing the root does not cause loss of sensation or reflex action; both would be lost.
- **Option F:** Incorrect. Seversing the root does not cause loss of sensation; both would be lost.
- **Option G:** Incorrect. Seversing the root does not cause paralysis or increased sensitivity; both would be lost.
- **Option H:** Incorrect. Seversing the root does not cause involuntary twitching or loss of reflex action; both would be lost.
- **Option I:** Incorrect. Seversing the root does not cause increased reflex action or loss of reflex; both would be lost.
- **Option J:** Incorrect. Seversing the root does not cause no effect or paralysis; both would be lost.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option C**, as severing either root causes the animal to lose both movement and sensation, resulting in complete paralysis.
