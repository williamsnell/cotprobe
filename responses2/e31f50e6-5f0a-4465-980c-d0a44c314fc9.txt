This question refers to the following information.

Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. The question is based on a song called "Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!" The song is about a historical figure named Winter King, and I need to determine what he did according to the song.

First, I'll try to recall the song's context. I think it's from the 17th century. The song probably has some historical references. I remember that in the 17th century, the Holy Roman Empire (also known as the German Empire) had various territories, including Bohemia. 

The song mentions that Ferdinand was the king of Bohemia, and he's granted full pardon for the Winter King's actions. Wait, no, actually, the song says something about Ferdinand alone being able to be Bohemia's king. Hmm. Alternatively, I think the song's title hints at a confrontation with the Holy Roman Empire, so maybe the Winter King was a ruler or a figure associated with them.

Looking at the options provided, each corresponds to a different historical action. The options are A to H. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Claimed the lands of Bohemia for the Catholic Church. That doesn't fit because the song seems to suggest the Winter King was against the Catholic Church, possibly in a role against the Holy Roman Empire.

Option B: Allied with King Ferdinand against other kingdoms. But the song's title refers to the Winter King, so perhaps the Winter King was in conflict with Ferdinand, implying that he allied with him.

Option C: Stole the crown from the kaiser. That's directly from the song: "Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king." So he might have been granted full pardon, but in the song, he's not stealing the crown; he's the king. So maybe this is incorrect.

Option D: Was granted full pardon for his actions by King Ferdinand. That rings a bell. The song says that Ferdinand granted him full pardon, which perhaps indicates that he was not guilty. Or wait, does the song suggest that he's been beaten? Because the song's title is "poor Winter King," which is a play on words about "king" and "ruler." If the Winter King was beaten, then he's not full pardon. But the song mentions "right well you knew, and all the world, right well they know this thing, that Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king." So perhaps he's granted full pardon, implying he's not guilty, but then he's also beaten. Alternatively, maybe the song suggests he's beaten, so he's not full pardon.

Option E: Was a symbolic figure without real power. That doesn't fit because the song is about a king, so symbolic figures might not be the answer.

Option F: Was a popular folk hero celebrated in songs and stories. The song is about a historical figure, but the song's context is about a conflict, not a traditional folk hero.

Option G: Successfully defended his land from the Holy Roman Empire. That could be true if the Winter King was fighting against the Holy Roman Empire, defending his land.

Option H: Rebelled against King Ferdinand. That would mean he escalated conflict, but the song might show that he's been beaten.

Option I: Gave over his crown to King Ferdinand. That's directly from the song: "Your days and nights will plague. Right well you knew, and all the world, right well they know this thing, that Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king." So, he's been given full pardon, but I'm not sure if he's given the crown. The song says he's granted full pardon, but doesn't explicitly state he's given the crown. However, in the context, the king is granted full pardon, so perhaps he's not actually holding the crown anymore, or the crown is no longer his. Alternatively, he might have been beaten, so he's no longer in power.

Wait, the song says he's been granted full pardon but didn't mention the crown. So if the king was granted full pardon, maybe he's no longer in power, but perhaps he still holds the crown. Alternatively, perhaps he's been beaten, so he's not in power anymore.

Looking again, the song's line is: "Right well you knew, and all the world, right well they know this thing, that Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king." So it's about Ferdinand being the king. The Winter King is associated with the Holy Roman Empire, perhaps fighting against them. So the Winter King might have taken the crown, but in the song, it's about Ferdinand being granted full pardon. Wait, but the song doesn't say he's taken the crown, so perhaps he's been defeated. So he's not in power anymore.

Looking at the options, D and I are about pardon. Option D is full pardon granted by Ferdinand, and I is giving over the crown. But the song says he's been granted full pardon, but maybe he's not holding the crown because he's been beaten.

Wait, the song's title is "poor Winter King," which suggests that he's being treated poorly. But in the song, it's more about the conflict with Ferdinand. So the Winter King is a ruler, perhaps fighting against the Holy Roman Empire, which is why Ferdinand is granted the title. So maybe the Winter King is a figure who was beaten, so he's not in power anymore. In that case, he's not given the crown, but the song says he's granted full pardon. So, perhaps the song is about his actions being wrong, but he's still in power. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Winter King was fighting against Ferdinand, which is why he's granted full pardon. So the Winter King was defeated, perhaps, and thus no longer in power. But the song is about the conflict, not a traditional hero.

Looking back at the options, I think the correct answer is D: Was granted full pardon for his actions by King Ferdinand. Because the song says that Ferdinand granted him full pardon, indicating that he's not guilty, but he might have been beaten so he's no longer in power. Alternatively, the song might be implying that he's been beaten, so he's not in power. But the options are about actions, not necessarily the political status. So option D seems to fit.

The song "Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!" revolves around a historical figure, the Winter King, who was associated with the Holy Roman Empire. The song's context suggests that the Winter King was fighting against Ferdinand, who was granted the title of King of Bohemia. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** ("Was granted full pardon for his actions by King Ferdinand") aligns with the song's reference to Ferdinand granting full pardon to the Winter King, indicating that he was not guilty. However, the song does not explicitly state that he was given the crown, but the context implies he was beaten, so he might not be in power anymore.

- **Option I** ("Gave over his crown to King Ferdinand") is also suggested by the song, as the Winter King might have been defeated, but the song does not explicitly state he gave the crown away.

Between **D** and **I**, the song's focus is on the granting of full pardon rather than the crown. The song's title and context suggest the Winter King was defeated, so he might not be in power, making **D** the most accurate choice.

ANSWER: D
