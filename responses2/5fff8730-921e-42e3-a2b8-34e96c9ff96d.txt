Okay, so I've got this question about Chodorow's 1978 argument regarding gender socialization. Hmm, I remember that Chodorow was a social psychology researcher who studied how people form gendered relationships. Let me think about what I learned.

So, the question is about what gender socialization means. The options are A through J, each describing a different scenario. I need to figure out which one matches Chodorow's argument.

I recall that Chodorow proposed that both genders are attached to their parents, but then something changes. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. No, actually, he said that both boys and girls are attached to their fathers, but then they break away. Or was it the other way around? Let me try to remember.

Wait, Chodorow's theory was about how both genders are attached to their parents but then they form separate relationships. Wait, no, he said that in socialization, both boys and girls are closely attached to their mothers, but then they break away. Oh no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Chodorow's model was that both boys and girls are attached to their fathers, but then they form their own relationships. So, both are closely attached to their male parents, then they leave the gendered attachment and form their own relationships. That would mean that the answer is B: both boys and girls being closely attached to their fathers, but then boys breaking away. Or wait, no, wait. Let me look again.

Wait, the options: Option B says both boys and girls being closely attached to their fathers, then boys breaking away. But I think Chodorow's model was that both boys and girls are attached to their fathers, but then they form their own relationships, meaning they don't stay attached to the parents. So Chodorow's argument was that both genders are closely attached to their fathers, but then they break away from the gendered attachment, forming their own relationships with their own partners.

But wait, I've also heard that Chodorow's model was that both boys and girls are attached to their mothers. No, wait, maybe Chodorow's model was that both are attached to their fathers, but then they form their own relationships. Let me think about the exact wording.

Wait, in the article, Chodorow argued that both boys and girls were closely attached to their fathers, but then they broke away. So the model is that both are attached to their fathers, but then they don't stay attached. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me try to think of each option. Option B is: both boys and girls being closely attached to their fathers, but then boys breaking away. So, that suggests that boys stay attached to their fathers, but girls leave.

Wait, but Chodorow's model is that both are attached to their fathers but then break away. So, the first part is correct, but the second part is that boys break away, not girls. So the second part is that boys break away. So the option says both boys and girls being attached to fathers, then boys break away. That would be option B.

Another option is I, where boys are attached to fathers and girls to mothers. That might not be Chodorow's argument. Chodorow didn't have both boys and girls attached to different genders; he said both were attached to their fathers but then formed their own relationships.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me check my notes. Chodorow's model was that both boys and girls are attached to their fathers, but then they don't stay attached. So, they form their own relationships with men, not their mothers, and leave the gendered attachments. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but another thought: I'm pretty sure Chodorow's model was that both boys and girls are attached to their fathers but then leave the gendered attachment and form their own relationships. So the correct answer would be option B: both boys and girls being closely attached to their fathers, then boys break away. Wait, no. Because Chodorow's model says they break away, but which gender breaks away? Wait, in the option B, it says boys break away.

Wait, wait, let me re-read the options. Option B says both boys and girls are attached to their fathers, but then boys break away. So the boys break away, not the girls. But Chodorow's theory was that both are attached to their fathers but then they form their own relationships. So the boys are attached to their fathers, but then they don't stay attached. So the sentence is: both are closely attached, but then they break away. So the sentence in the option B says "boys breaking away" â€” but wait, the model was that they break away, which would be the opposite. Or is it that they leave the gendered attachment and form their own?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the model. Let me think again, perhaps I should recall the exact content of Chodorow's article. Oh wait, I think Chodorow argued that both genders are attached to their fathers, but then they leave the gendered attachment and form their own relationships. So, both are close to their fathers, but they break away. So, the first part is correct (attached to fathers), and the second part is that they break away. But the options are a bit different.

Looking at the options again: Option B says boys and girls being attached to their fathers, then boys break away. So, the second part is boys breaking away, which aligns with the model where both are attached to fathers, but then they leave the gendered attachment and form their own relationships. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but another thought: some sources say Chodorow's model was that both boys and girls are attached to their mothers, but that's not what I remember. Or was it that both are attached to their fathers? No, I think Chodorow's model was that both boys and girls are attached to their fathers, but then they don't stay attached. So the model was that both are close to their fathers, but they leave the gendered attachment and form their own relationships. So option B would be correct.

Alternatively, another option is I: boys to fathers, girls to mothers. That doesn't match Chodorow's model. So I think the correct answer is option B.

Chodorow's 1978 argument about gender socialization centers on the idea that both boys and girls are closely attached to their fathers but then leave the gendered attachment and form their own relationships. This model suggests that while both genders are attached to their male parents, they do not remain in the gendered relationship but instead establish their own, non-gendered relationships. The correct option reflects this understanding, which is option B: both boys and girls being closely attached to their fathers, but then boys breaking away.

Answer: B
