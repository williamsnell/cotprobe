Okay, so I've got this question here about electrical analogy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking what analogous quantity to a spring element's stiffness, K, is in the force-voltage analogy.

Wait, I remember that in electrical systems, we often compare mechanical systems to electrical ones. So, mechanical systems use force and displacement, while electrical systems use voltage and current. The analogy often relies on the same type of system. For example, a mass-spring system in mechanics is often compared to an inductance-capacitance system in electricity.

Right, so in mechanical terms, a spring's stiffness (K) is the force per unit displacement. That is, F = K * x, where x is the displacement. So, in electrical terms, what's the analogous quantity? I think it's related to current. Oh wait, in an inductor, the voltage is proportional to the rate of change of current. That's V = L * di/dt. So, if in mechanical, F is proportional to x (Kx), then in electrical, V is proportional to dI/dt (which is the current's rate of change). 

So, the analogy goes: mechanical (force) corresponds to electrical voltage, displacement to current. So, the spring constant K (force per displacement) would correspond to something in electrical terms that's related to current. Looking at the options, the choices are V (A), 1/C (B), C (C), L (D), LC (E), 1/L (F), 1/R (G), RC (H), I (Ampere), R (Ohm).

Wait, the inductance L is the analogous to something. Let me think. In electrical terms, inductance L is related to the rate of change of current, which is current over time. So, L has units of H (henry), which is equivalent to Vs/A (since V is J/C, and 1 H is 1 V s/A). 

In the mechanical system, K has units of N/m (force per displacement). In the electrical analogy, the force is replaced with voltage, and displacement with current. So, the equivalent for K would be voltage over current, which is V/I. But wait, in the options, V is an option (A), and 1/C is option B. Let me think about that.

Wait, I think the analogy is that in mechanical, F = K * x, and in electrical, V = L * di/dt. Another way: the force is force, displacement is current; so K is force per displacement, so in E, it would be V (since V is force per charge, but displacement is charge per time? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, in E, the quantity analogous to force would be voltage, and displacement to current. So, K (force per displacement) would correspond to V/(I), which is V/I. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: in the analogy, mechanical variables are replaced as: F ↔ V, x ↔ I, m ↔ C, etc. So, for a spring, which is F = K x, the equivalent in electricity would have V (voltage) proportional to I (current) with a proportionality constant that is analogous to K. So, V = K x → I = K x → V = K x → I = (K x) / R? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Alternatively, think about power. In a spring, the potential energy is ½ K x², which is the work done by the spring. In E, the electrical analog would have the charge squared over something. Wait, maybe each system's energy per unit state is analogous. Hmm, perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, let me think about the differential equations. For the spring, F = -K x (force proportional to displacement). In E, that would be V = -L (di/dt) (voltage proportional to current's rate of change). So, the analogous quantity for K is the inductance's reciprocal? Or wait, no. Wait, in the mechanical system, K is a constant that relates F and x. In E, K would relate V and I? Or wait, no, because in E, V and I are related through the conductance (G = I/V), so if the mechanical system has F = K x, and E has V = K I, that would make K the analogous quantity.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. The analogy is F in mechanical ↔ V in E. So, if F = K x, then V = K I in E, because F would be replaced by V, and x by I. So, K (force per displacement) would be V/I. But none of the options include V/I. Looking at the options, option C is C, which is the reciprocal of inductance. So, perhaps the analogy is different.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the analogy. Another way: the mechanical system is F = K x, and the electrical system is V = L (di/dt). So, K is F/x, which is (V * I) / (x * I) → V/(x * I) * I → V/(x) times I. Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, looking for what's the equivalent of force per displacement. In mechanical, force per displacement is K. So, K has units of N/m. In E, voltage is measured in volts, which is J/C, and current is A. So, let's think about the unit of K. K = F/x → (N m^-1) = kg m/s² / m → kg/(s²). Now, what's the unit for V/I? (V) is (kg m^2)/(s^3 A), because V = J/C = (kg m²/s²)/C. And I is A. So, V/I → (kg m²/(s² A)).

Wait, but K's unit is kg/(s²). So, V/I's unit is (kg m²/(s² A)) → (kg/(s²)) * m² / A. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe the analogy isn't voltage over current. Maybe it's current over voltage? Because V/I would be (kg m²/(s^3 A)) / (kg/(s^2)) ) → (m²/s^3 A) * s^2/kg → m²/(s A kg) → which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the analogy is K → conductance. Conductance is I/V, which has units of S (siemens) = A/(V). So, if K is force per displacement, then in E, K would be analogous to conductance. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is C (capacitance). If I have K → 1/C, because capacitance is C=Q/V. So, K would be analogous to 1/C? Because if K is F/m or something else.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the entire analogy. In mechanical systems, each component has a physical quantity. Force (F) is analogous to voltage (V), displacement (x) to charge (q), mass (m) to inductance (L), velocity (v) to current (I), and damping (b) to resistance (R).

So, for each mechanical quantity, we have an electrical counterpart.

So, F → V

x → q

m → L

v → I

b → R

So, for the spring, which is F = K x, the electrical equivalent would be V = K q. So, K is the analogous quantity to V/q, which is voltage per charge. But voltage is V, and charge is C, so V/C. But none of the options is V/C (option B is 1/C, which is like C⁻¹). Wait, no, option B is 1/C, which is same as C⁻¹. So, V/C would be V times C⁻¹, which is (V/C). Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Wait, the mechanical spring's stiffness is K, which is F per x. So, K has units of N/m. The electrical equivalent would be voltage per current. So, K (N/m) would be analogous to V/I. But V/I is (V)/(A) = (J/C)/(A) → (kg m²/(s³ A)) / (A) → kg m²/(s³ A²), which doesn't match N/m (kg m/s²). So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the analogy is that in mechanical systems, F = K x. So, in E, V is analogous to F, and current is analogous to x. So, K would be analogous to V/I. Hmm, but V/I is (V) / (A) → (kg m²/(s³ A)) ) / (A) → kg m²/(s³ A²), which doesn't match N/m (kg m/s²). So that's not matching.

Wait, but perhaps I've got it wrong. Perhaps the analogy is that K is analogous to the reciprocal of inductance. Because in E, inductance is L = V/dt. So, if in E, voltage is analogous to force, then in E, current is analogous to displacement. So, K would be analogous to V/I, since V = K x → I = K x → x = I/(K) → but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the equation for a spring. F = K x. If in E, V = L (dI/dt), then comparing, K x = L (dI/dt). So, x = (L/K) (dI/dt). So, K is the analogous of V/(x * L). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, in the mechanical system, the energy stored is ½ K x². In E, the analogous energy is ½ V I (since V = L dI/dt, so energy is the integral of V I dt, which would be something else). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is to remember the standard electrical analogy. The spring is analogous to the inductor. Because in E, the inductor's voltage is proportional to current's rate of change: V = L (di/dt).

In mechanical, F = K x, so in E, V would be K x. But x is displacement, which is analogous to current. So, V = K x → I = (K x)/R? Wait, no, because in E, V = L (di/dt). So, if K is the analogous of V/I, then K would be V/I. But V/I is (V)/(A) → V * A⁻¹. But in E, the conductance is S = A/V. So, K would be analogous to conductance.

Wait, but what's the option for conductance? Looking back, the options are A: V, B: 1/C, C: C, D: L, E: LC, F:1/L, G:1/R, H: RC, I: I, J: R.

So, option B is 1/C, which is the conductance. So, if the analogy is K → 1/C, then that's option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought K is F/x → which is (kg m/s²)/m → kg/(s²). What's 1/C's unit? C is farads? No, in SI units, capacitance is in farads (F = C/V). So, 1/C would be V/C. V is kg m²/(s³ A), because V is J/C, and J is kg m²/s². So, V = kg m²/(s³ A). C is coulombs (C = A s). So, V/C = (kg m²/(s³ A)) ) / (A s) ) → kg m²/(s⁴ A²). Hmm, that doesn't match K's unit.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the analogy wrong. Another way: the mechanical equation is F = K x. The electrical equation is V = L (di/dt). So, K is analogous to V/(x). Wait, but in E, V is across the capacitor, and x is displacement. So, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about mechanical systems. Wait, the question is about force and voltage. So, perhaps the mechanical system's spring is F=Kx, and the electrical analogy is V= L (dI/dt). So, K is analogous to V/I. But V/I is (V)/(A) → (kg m²/(s³ A)) / A → kg m²/(s³ A²). That doesn't match the unit of K, which is N/m → kg/(s² m) → kg/(s² m).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the system where K is analogous to inductance. Let me think. If in E, inductance is L = V/dt. So, if the mechanical system's K is analogous to inductance, then K would be analogous to L, which is option D. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is C, which is capacitance. Because the spring's force per unit displacement is K, and in E, the analogous quantity is current per displacement? But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the standard analogy. In mechanical, the quantity analogous to force is voltage, displacement to charge, mass to inductance, velocity to current, and damping (force per velocity) to resistance.

So, for a spring, the force is proportional to displacement: F = K x. So, in E, voltage is proportional to current's rate of change. So, V = K x → I = (V)/(R), but R is resistance. Wait, that would not make sense. Alternatively, in E, perhaps the analogous equation is V = L (dI/dt). So, comparing F = K x to V = L (dI/dt), so K would be analogous to V/I, but that's the conductance. So, K would be analogous to 1/C.

But wait, in E, Capacitance is C = Q/V, so 1/C is V/Q. So, if V is analogous to F, and Q is analogous to displacement, then 1/C is analogous to V/Q. So, K (F/x) would be analogous to V/Q, which is 1/C. So, K is analogous to 1/C, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought that K's unit is kg/(s²), and 1/C's unit is (V/C) = (kg m²/(s³ A)) / (A s) → kg m²/(s⁴ A²). That doesn't match kg/(s²). So, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is capacitance. Because when you have a spring, the equation is F = K x, and in E, the analogous equation would be V = K I. So, K (F/x) would be analogous to V/I, which is conductance (1/C). So, the answer would be option B, 1/C.

Wait, another way: in mechanical, K is N/m. In E, V is measured in volts. So, V/I (current) → (kg m²/(s³ A)) ) / (A) → kg m²/(s³ A²). That's not the same as N/m. So, that can't be.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose K is 10 N/m. What would be the corresponding E quantity? If K is analogous to 1/C, then C would be (1/V) * (something). Alternatively, perhaps the analogy is that in mechanical, F is analogous to V, and x is analogous to I. So, F = K x would correspond to V = K I. Then, K is the analogous quantity, which is C (capacitance) because C = Q/V, so V=Q/C → Q = C V. So, if V = K I, then K = V/I = (Q/C)/I = (Q/(C I)) ) → but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to recall that in mechanical systems, the force per unit displacement is K, and in E, the voltage per unit charge is E. But I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 1/C. Because the analogy is K (force per displacement) is analogous to 1/C (capacitance) because in the differential equation, K x would be F, and V = L di/dt. So, if K is analogous to 1/C, then the relationship would be V = (1/C) * di/dt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The electrical analogy for mechanical systems. So, F = K x, which in E is V = L (di/dt). So, the mechanical equation is F = K x, and the E equation is V = L (di/dt). Thus, K x = L (di/dt). So, K is the coefficient in the mechanical equation. So, the analog of K would be the coefficient in the E equation, which is L. Wait, no, because the equation is V = L (di/dt), so K x = L (di/dt). So, K x = V → x = V/(K), but that doesn't make direct sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the analogy is that the mechanical force is analogous to the voltage across a capacitor. Because in a capacitor, V = Q/C. So, if the mechanical force F is analogous to the voltage V, then F = K x would be analogous to V = K I, where I is current. So, in that case, K would be analogous to V/I, which is conductance (1/C). So, K is analogous to 1/C, which is option B.

Wait, but then F = K x would be analogous to V = (1/C) I. Because V = K I, and K is F/x, so F = (V x)/I → V/I = F x / I → V = F x / I. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps K is analogous to inductance. Let me think. F = K x → K = F/x. In E, V = L (dI/dt). So, K in the mechanical system would be analogous to L in the electrical system. That can't be right because their units are different.

Wait, units again. F is force (kg m/s²), x is displacement (m). So, K's unit is kg/(s²). The E system's units: V is kg m²/(s³ A), current is A. So, V/I = (kg m²/(s³ A)) ) / A → kg m²/(s³ A²), which doesn't match kg/(s²). So, that can't be the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C, which is capacitance. Because in the mechanical system, the equation is F = K x, which is analogous to the E equation V = L (di/dt). So, if K is the analogous quantity, then K is analogous to V/I, which is conductance.

But what's the unit of conductance? Conductance is S = A/V. So, K's unit must be V/A → which is (kg m²/(s³ A)) ) / A → kg m²/(s³ A²). That doesn't match the unit of K (kg/(s²)).

Wait, perhaps the analogy is different. Maybe K is analogous to charge. Because in the mechanical system, each mass is m, and each displacement is x. So, perhaps the analog is m ↔ C, so K is analogous to C/m. But that would make K's unit (kg/(m)) → not matching the unit of K (kg/(s²)).

Alternatively, perhaps the analogy is F ↔ V, and x ↔ I. So, K would be analogous to V/I, which is (kg m²/(s³ A)) ) / (A) → kg m²/(s³ A²). That's not matching K's unit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 1/C. Because in the mechanical system, F = K x, and in E, V = L (di/dt). So, K would be analogous to V/I, which is (kg m²/(s³ A)) ) / (A) → kg m²/(s³ A²), which doesn't match K's unit of kg/(s²).

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the electrical analogy for a spring. In E, the inductance is L and the capacitance is C. So, in the mechanical system, F = K x is analogous to V = (1/C) I. Because in E, V = L (di/dt). So, if K x = L (di/dt), and we want V = K x, then K x = L (di/dt). So, V = (L/C) I. So, K is analogous to L/C. But wait, that's not right because the units don't match.

Wait, the unit of L is H (henrys) which is F^{-1}. So, L/C is (F^{-1})/F) → F^{-2}. So, K's unit would be F^{-2}, but in the mechanical system, K's unit is F/m. So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct analogy is that K is analogous to capacitance. Because in E, V = L (di/dt), so if K is analogous to V/I, then K is 1/C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is capacitance. Because in E, V = L (di/dt), so the analogous equation for K would be V = K I, which implies K = V/I = (kg m²/(s³ A)) ) / (A) → kg m²/(s³ A²). But K's unit is kg/(s²), which is different.

Hmm, I'm not confident. I think the correct answer is option B: 1/C. Because the mechanical spring's F is analogous to voltage, and displacement to charge. So, K would be analogous to voltage per charge, which is conductance, so option B.

Wait, but in that case, F = K x → K = F/x → (N/m) / (m) → N/m². Which is (kg m/s²) / m² → kg/(s² m). That's not the same as conductance's unit, which is kg/(s³ A²).

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the answer elsewhere. Since I can't, I'll have to make a guess.

Wait, another approach. In mechanical systems, the equation is F = K x, and in electrical systems, it's V = L (di/dt). So, if we want to find the analogous quantity for K, then K in the mechanical system is analogous to V/I in the electrical system. But V/I is (kg m²/(s³ A)) ) / (A) → kg m²/(s³ A²), which doesn't match K's unit.

Wait, but in E, the conductance is S = A/V. So, if K is analogous to conductance, then K is 1/C. So, the correct answer is option B, 1/C.

The question asks for the analogous quantity in an electrical system to the stiffness (stiffness coefficient) in a mechanical system. In mechanical systems, the stiffness is represented by \( K \), and its unit is \( \text{N/m} \). In electrical systems, the analogous quantity is represented by \( V/I \), which is known as the conductance. Conductance has units of \( \text{S} = \text{A/V} \). Since the question is about the analogy between \( K \) (stiffness in the mechanical system) and the analogous quantity in the electrical system, the correct answer is \( 1/C \), which corresponds to conductance.

ANSWER: B
