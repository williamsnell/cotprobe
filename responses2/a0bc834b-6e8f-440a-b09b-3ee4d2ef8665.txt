Okay, so I've got this question about thyristors, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the latching current when the holding current is 2 mA. The options are A, B, C, D with values 0.001, 0.004, 0.01, and 0.002 Amps respectively.

Hmm, I remember that thyristors are semiconductor devices that conduct electricity when a trigger is applied. They have different characteristics, like holding and latching currents. Oh wait, right, the holding current is the current needed to turn the thyristor on, and the latching current is the current that keeps it on when the gate is activated.

So, I think the latching current is usually higher than the holding current. Because once you've turned on the thyristor, you need a bit more current to keep it conducting. I recall that typical latching currents are in the range of a few hundred milliamperes. Let me thinkâ€”what's the exact range?

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. I think for most common thyristors, the latching current is around 0.01 A (100 mA) or higher, but maybe more? Or was it lower? Wait, no, I think I've read that the latching current can vary, but a common value is about 0.005 to 0.01 A. Wait, but the options given don't have that range.

Looking back at the options: the highest is 0.01 A (0.01 A is 100 mA), but the next is 0.004 (40 mA) and 0.002 (20 mA). The options are all lower than that. So maybe I got the question wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking the opposite. Because sometimes the holding current is the current required to charge the gate, and the latching current is the current that keeps it conducting. So, the latching current is higher than the holding current.

If the holding current is 2 mA, then the latching current should be higher. The options don't have any higher than 0.01 A. So if the only option near 0.01 is C (0.01A), perhaps that's the right choice.

Wait, but what if the holding current is 2 mA, which is 2 mA, so the latching current needs to be higher. So options D is 0.002A, which is 2 mA. That can't be right because that's the same as the holding current. But I thought the latching current is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was phrased the other way. Maybe it's asking for the higher current, but the options are lower. Hmm. Or perhaps I'm confusing the concepts.

Wait, another approach: the latching current is the current that, once the gate is triggered, keeps the device conducting. So depending on the device, it's usually higher than the holding current. So if the holding current is 2 mA, the latching current should be higher, perhaps 0.01 A (100 mA) or more.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.01A, which is 100 mA, which is higher. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh, wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is stating that the device is triggered with a current of 2 mA, which is the holding current. Then the latching current is the current needed to keep it on. So if the holding current is 2 mA, then the latching current is higher. So the options are A: 0.001 (1 mA), B: 0.004 (4 mA), C: 0.01 (100 mA), D: 0.002 (2 mA).

So the holding current is 2mA, latching current must be higher. So the correct answer must be C, 0.01 A.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the latching current when the holding current is 2 mA, but the options only go up to 0.01 A. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

The question asks for the latching current of a thyristor when the holding current is 2 mA. The latching current is the current required to keep the thyristor conducting once the gate is activated and is typically higher than the holding current. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (0.001 A, 1 mA):** This is lower than the holding current, which is not possible since the latching current must be higher.
- **Option B (0.004 A, 4 mA):** This is also lower than the holding current but still lower than the latching current required.
- **Option C (0.01 A, 100 mA):** This is the highest option and is consistent with the latching current typically being higher than the holding current.
- **Option D (0.002 A, 2 mA):** This is the same as the holding current and cannot be the latching current.

Given that the latching current must be higher than the holding current, the correct answer is the highest option, **0.01 A**.
