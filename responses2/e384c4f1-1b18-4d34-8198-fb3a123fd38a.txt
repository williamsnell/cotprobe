Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

On May 2, a woman mailed the following letter to a man:"May 1I have two tickets to the concert on July 1 at the auditorium in town. I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. "The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. "Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?

Options:

A: Yes, because the man did not read the letter until after the 15-day period.
B: No, because the woman sold the tickets before the man could accept the offer.
C: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.
D: No, because the man attempted to accept the offer within 15 days of receiving the letter.
E: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.
F: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.
G: No, because the man was still within the 15-day period when he went to the woman's home.
H: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.
I: Yes, because the woman had already sold the tickets by the time the man went to her home.
J: Yes, because the man attempted to accept the offer after 15 days from the date of the letter.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contracts and the power of acceptance. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully.

The scenario is that a woman sent a letter on May 2 to a man. The letter offers two tickets to a concert on July 1 at the auditorium. She says each ticket should be sold at $60, which is $10 above face value. She also mentions that the concert has been sold out for months, so it's a good deal. The man received the letter on May 4, but didn't read it until May 6. On May 18, he tried to accept the offer. The woman replied that tickets were sold last week for $75 each, which is more than the $60 she offered. So the question is whether the woman's power of acceptance was terminated because the time lapse was too long, or if the man was still within the 15-day period.

I remember that the power of acceptance, or the right to accept a contract, typically requires that the offer is made within a certain time frame. The standard rule is that the offer must be made within 15 days of the contract being delivered. So, if the offer is made too late, the contract can't be accepted, and the offer fails.

The key points here are:
1. The offer was made on May 2.
2. The time period is 15 days. So from May 2, adding 15 days would be May 2 + 15 = May 17. So the period is up to May 17.
3. The man received the letter on May 4 and didn't read it until May 6. So he had 2 days of waiting before reading it.
4. He then tried to accept the offer on May 18, which is two days after May 16. Wait, no, wait: let's calculate the timeline.

Wait, the man received the letter on May 4. The offer was made on May 2, so the time between May 2 and May 4 was two days. But the time period for acceptance is 15 days from when the offer is made. So from May 2, 15 days later is May 17.

So the man didn't read the letter until May 6. That's 2 days after receiving it. So the time he could have taken to read is May 4 (original receipt) + 2 days = May 6. So he read it on May 6.

He then went to accept on May 18. Wait, May 18 is how many days after May 17? Let's see: from May 17 to May 18 is one day. So if the offer required 15 days, May 18 is within the 15-day window. Wait no, wait. Because the 15-day period starts on May 2, 15 days later is May 17. So May 18 is 1 day after that. So the time lapse is May 17 to May 18 is one day. So that's less than 15 days.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.

Let me count the days between May 2 and May 17. May 2 is day 0. May 3 is day 1, May 4 day 2, May 5 day 3, 6 day 4, 7 day5, 8 day6, 9 day7, 10 day8, 11 day9, 12 day10, 13 day11, 14 day12, 15 day13. So May 17 is 15 days from May 2. So May 18 is 16 days from May 2.

Wait, no. May 2 is day 0. May 17 is 15 days later. So May 18 is 16 days from May 2. So that's within the 15-day period? No, because 16 is beyond 15.

Wait, no. 15 days from May 2 is May 17. So if someone tries to accept on May 18, that's 16 days from May 2. So that's outside the 15-day period.

Wait, but according to the problem, the man received the letter on May 4, but didn't read it until May 6. So he read it 2 days after receipt.

So the time period for acceptance is 15 days from when the offer is made, which is May 2. So up to May 17.

So May 18 is outside the 15-day window. So the man couldn't accept on May 18 because the time was too long.

But wait, the woman's reply was that tickets were sold last week for $75 each. So she's saying that she made the offer because she already sold them. But the issue is the time lapse.

So the question is whether the power of acceptance was terminated because the time lapse was too long.

So the man didn't read until after 15 days? Wait, he read it until May 6, which is two days after receipt. So that's within the 15-day period, but he then tried to accept on May 18, which is 1 day after May 17.

So the 15-day period is May 2 to May 17.

So May 18 is beyond that. So the man couldn't accept the offer because the time was too long. Therefore, the power of acceptance was terminated because the time lapse was too long.

Wait, but in the options, let me look.

The options are about whether the power was terminated because the time was too long or within the period.

Option D says No, because man accepted before 15 days. So the power was terminated because the time was too long.

Wait, but the man didn't read until after 15 days. He read until May 6, which is within 15 days (since May 6 is 4 days after May 2). So he didn't violate the time, the 15-day period. So the power is still valid because he read it within 15 days.

But he then accepted on May 18, which is outside the 15-day period. So the offer was made on May 2, and the man didn't read until May 6. But he accepted after May 17, which is when the time expired.

Wait, but the woman's reply said the tickets were sold last week, meaning she made the offer before the man read it, so she had the power.

Wait, but the key is whether the offer was made within the time period. So the woman made the offer on May 2. The 15-day period is from May 2 to May 17.

If the man reads it before May 17, the offer is still valid. But he didn't read until May 6. So that's within the 15-day period. So the offer is still valid.

But he then tried to accept on May 18, which is 1 day after May 17. So that's outside the time period. Therefore, the power was terminated because the time lapse was too long.

So the correct answer would be option A: Yes, because man did not read until after 15-day period? Wait, no. Because he did read it within 15 days. He read on May 6, which is within May 2 +15 days.

So the man didn't violate the time. The power is still valid because he read it before the 15-day window. But then he accepted too late, so the offer can't be accepted. So the woman's offer is invalid because the time was too long.

The question is, did the power of acceptance get terminated because the time lapse was too long, or because he accepted too late.

The question says: "Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?"

So the man went home on May 17.

Wait, the man received the letter on May 4, didn't read until May 6 (so 2 days after receipt). Then he tried to accept on May 18, which is 1 day after May 17.

So the 15-day period is May 2 to May 17. So May 18 is one day beyond.

So the man's attempt was after the 15-day period. So the power was terminated because the time was too long.

So the answer is A: Yes, because the man did not read the letter until after the 15-day period.

Wait, no, because he did read it on May 6, which is within the 15-day period. So the 15-day period was May 2 to May 17. He read it by May 6. So he didn't violate the time. So the offer is still valid, but he tried to accept too late.

Wait, but the question is whether the power was terminated because of the time lapse. The woman's reply was that tickets were sold before he could accept. So her offer was made before he read it, so the power was valid. But because the time was up, he couldn't accept.

So the answer is whether the power was terminated because the time was too long. So the answer is A: Yes, because the man did not read until after the 15-day period. Wait, no. He did read it on May 6, so the time was within the 15-day period. So the power is still valid, but the man accepted too late.

Wait, but the question is whether the power was terminated because of the time. So if he read it before the 15-day period, then the power is still valid. But if he didn't read until after, then the power is terminated.

In this case, he read it on May 6, which is within the 15-day period. So he didn't violate the time. The time was up, so the offer can't be accepted.

So the power is still valid, but he was too late. The question asks whether the power was terminated because of the time lapse. So the answer is that the time lapse was within the 15-day period, but he was too late.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is that the power was not terminated because he accepted too late. So the answer is option D: No, because he accepted too late.

Wait, but the man's intent is to accept the offer. He didn't read it, so he couldn't accept it, even if the offer was made before.

So the power is still valid because he couldn't accept it because the time was too long.

Wait, the woman's letter created the power. The man read the letter, didn't accept because the time was up, but he accepted because he didn't read.

So the power is still valid because he didn't read it before the 15-day period, but he accepted too late. So the power wasn't terminated because of the time, but because he was too late to accept.

So the correct answer should be A: Yes, because the man did not read the letter until after the 15-day period.

Wait, no. He did read it on May 6, which is within the 15-day period. So he didn't violate the time. The time was up, so the offer can't be accepted.

So the power is still valid, but he was too late. So the answer is that the power was not terminated because he accepted too late. So the woman's letter's power wasn't terminated because the time was up. So the answer is option A: yes, because the man didn't read until after the 15-day period, but wait, he did read until May 6. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question is, was the power terminated because of the time lapse before he went home.

So if he didn't read until after the 15-day period, the power was terminated. But he did read until May 6, which is within 15 days. So the time was up, so the power was still valid, but he was too late to accept.

So the woman's letter's power wasn't terminated because the time was up. So the answer is D: No, because he accepted too late.

Wait no, the woman's letter created the power, so the man's attempt to accept is a problem because he didn't read. So the power is valid because he couldn't accept, even though the time was up. So the power wasn't terminated because of the time, but the man was too late.

Wait, the question is about whether the power was terminated because of the time lapse. So the correct answer would be that the power wasn't terminated because he accepted too late.

Looking at the options:

A: Yes, because the man didn't read until after the 15-day period. No, he did read until May 6.

B: No, because the woman sold tickets before he could accept. Yes, because the woman had already sold them.

C: Yes, because she sold tickets before he accepted. No, because the woman made the offer first.

D: No, because he accepted too late. Yes, because he couldn't accept because the time was up.

E: Yes, because the man attempted to accept after 15 days. No, because it was only 1 day after.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me think again.

The man's intent was to accept. He didn't read the letter, so he couldn't. But the offer was made on May 2, 15 days later is May 17. So he accepted on May 18, which is beyond. So the offer can't be accepted. So the power is still valid, but the man was too late to accept.

Thus, the woman's power was valid, but he was too late. So the answer is D: No, because he accepted too late.

Wait, but the question is whether the power was terminated because of the time lapse. So the answer is that the power wasn't terminated because the time was up, but he was too late. So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the power of acceptance created by the woman on the man's letter was terminated because the time lapse was too long. The key points are:

1. The offer was made on May 2, and the 15-day period for acceptance starts from this date, ending on May 17.
2. The man received the letter on May 4 and read it until May 6, which is within the 15-day period.
3. The man attempted to accept the offer on May 18, which is one day after the 15-day period (May 17).
4. The woman's reply indicates that tickets were sold earlier, but the power of acceptance was still valid because the man read the letter within the time frame.
5. The man's attempt to accept on May 18 was too late, so the power was terminated because the time lapse was beyond the 15-day period.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Yes, because the man did not read the letter until after the 15-day period.**  
  Incorrect. The man read the letter until May 6, which is within the 15-day period.
  
- **B: No, because the woman sold the tickets before the man could accept the offer.**  
  Incorrect. The woman's offer was made before the man read the letter, creating the power of acceptance.
  
- **C: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.**  
  Incorrect. The mailing date is irrelevant to the power of acceptance, which is determined by the time lapse.
  
- **D: No, because the man attempted to accept the offer within 15 days but after the time lapse.**  
  Correct. The man violated the 15-day period by accepting too late.
  
- **E: Yes, because the man attempted to accept the offer after 15 days from the date of the letter.**  
  Incorrect. The man attempted to accept after 1 day, not after 15 days.
  
- **F: No, because the man read the letter on May 4, the day it was received.**  
  Incorrect. The man read it later, on May 6.
  
- **G: No, because the man was still within the 15-day period when he went to the woman's home.**  
  Incorrect. The man was outside the 15-day period when he accepted.
  
- **H: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.**  
  Incorrect. The receipt date is irrelevant to the 15-day period.
  
- **I: Yes, because the man had already sold the tickets by the time he went to her home.**  
  Incorrect. The woman's offer was made before the man read the letter.
  
- **J: Yes, because the man attempted to accept the offer after 15 days from the date of the letter.**  
  Incorrect. The man accepted after 1 day.

### Conclusion:
The power of acceptance was valid because the man read the letter within the 15-day period. However, the man accepted too late, which terminated the power of acceptance.
