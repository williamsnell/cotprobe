Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a particle moving along the x-axis. The equation given is x = a + b t². The constants are a =20 cm and b =4 cm/sec². The questions are about displacement between t1=2 and t2=5, average velocity, and instantaneous velocity at t1=2.

Hmm, let's break this down. Displacement is the change in position, so I need to find x at t2 and subtract x at t1. Right.

So for part (a), displacement = x(t2) - x(t1).

x(t) =20 +4 t². So x(5) =20 +4*(5)^2=20 +4*25=20+100=120 cm. x(2)=20 +4*(2)^2=20+16=36 cm. So displacement is 120-36=84 cm. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 84 cm as the displacement in all cases. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, C and D have displacement 84 cm. So that's a clue. Now for part (c), the instantaneous velocity at t1=2. Velocity is the derivative of x with respect to time. So v(t) = dx/dt = 0 + 8t cm/sec. So at t=2, v=8*2=16 cm/s. So that's part (c).

So looking at the options, C and D have 16 cm/s as the instantaneous velocity. So which one is correct? Let's see the displacement for the options C and D.

Wait, for displacement, I think it's 84 cm in both C and D. Oh wait, no: looking again, option C says displacement 84, average velocity 28, and instantaneous velocity 16. Option D says displacement:84, average velocity:16, instantaneous velocity:28.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because I think displacement is 84 cm. So between C and D, which one has the correct average velocity.

Wait, part (b) is average velocity. Average velocity is displacement divided by time interval.

Time interval is t2 - t1 =5-2=3 sec. So for part (b), average velocity is 84 cm /3 sec =28 cm/s.

So the correct options should have displacement 84, average velocity 28, and instantaneous velocity 16.

Looking at the options, option C is displacement 84, average velocity 28 cm/sec, and instantaneous velocity 16 cm/sec. So that's the correct answer.

The problem involves finding the displacement, average velocity, and instantaneous velocity of a particle moving along the x-axis with the equation \( x = a + bt^2 \), where \( a = 20 \, \text{cm} \) and \( b = 4 \, \text{cm/sec}^2 \). The time interval is from \( t_1 = 2 \, \text{sec} \) to \( t_2 = 5 \, \text{sec} \).

1. **Displacement**:  
   Displacement is the change in position, calculated as \( x(t_2) - x(t_1) \).  
   \( x(5) = 20 + 4(5)^2 = 20 + 100 = 120 \, \text{cm} \).  
   \( x(2) = 20 + 4(2)^2 = 20 + 16 = 36 \, \text{cm} \).  
   Displacement = \( 120 - 36 = 84 \, \text{cm} \).

2. **Instantaneous Velocity**:  
   Velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time: \( v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 8t \, \text{cm/sec} \).  
   At \( t_1 = 2 \, \text{sec} \), \( v(2) = 8(2) = 16 \, \text{cm/sec} \).

3. **Average Velocity**:  
   Average velocity is displacement divided by the time interval:  
   \( \text{Average velocity} = \frac{\text{Displacement}}{\Delta t} = \frac{84 \, \text{cm}}{3 \, \text{sec}} = 28 \, \text{cm/sec} \).

From the options, the correct combination is **displacement 84 cm, average velocity 28 cm/sec, and instantaneous velocity 16 cm/sec**. This matches **Option C**.
