Question:

A law bookstore entered into a written contract to purchase from the publisher 100 copies of the latest edition of a certain casebook for $10 per book. Three days after the contract was formed, but prior to delivery of the casebooks, the publisher called the owner of the law bookstore and informed him that, because of a calculation error, the price for the casebooks should have been $11 per book, and the shipment could not be delivered unless the owner promised to pay that amount. The owner reluctantly agreed. The owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is

Options:

Alright, I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read through it again.

So, a law bookstore entered into a contract to buy 100 casebooks from a publisher. The price was $10 each. Three days after the contract was formed but before the books were delivered, the publisher called. He said there was a calculation error; the price should have been $11 each, and they couldn't ship unless the owner promised to pay that amount.

The owner agreed reluctantly. Now, the question is about whether this new agreement is enforceable.

Hmm, okay. So the key points are: the original contract, the error, the publisher's response, and the owner's acceptance.

First, I think about whether the original contract can be enforced. The law requires that the contract must be in writing, which it is. So the original contract stands.

But then, the publisher changed the price and had to wait for payment. So the original contract's price was $10, but the error led to a $11 increase. The owner agreed to pay $11 each, but that's a new consideration.

Wait, what are the requirements for enforceability? I remember that for a contract to be enforceable, it must meet the requirements of a valid contract. One of the key points is that the new consideration must be reasonable and agreed upon at the time the contract was made. 

So in this case, the original consideration (price) was $10. The new consideration is $11. The owner agreed to pay an additional $1 per book. That seems like a reasonable addition. But wait, is there a legal requirement about whether the new consideration is reasonable?

I think the law requires that the new consideration is reasonable, agreed, and not an alteration of the original terms. So if the publisher corrected the error, maybe it's considered a reasonable change. But does the original contract include the new consideration, like the increased price? Or is it just a change in the terms?

Wait, the original contract was for $10. The new terms are $11. So the new consideration is $1 more per book. But the original terms already included the consideration, so does the new agreement add a new consideration?

Alternatively, maybe the original contract already included the increased price. Or perhaps the new terms are merely a new consideration. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another point: contracts must be in writing, which they are. The new agreement is a written agreement, so that's okay. But the question is whether the new terms are enforceable.

The issue here is whether the new consideration is reasonable. The publisher changed the terms from $10 to $11, which is a $1 increase. Thatâ€™s a small change, but not negligible. In some jurisdictions, changes are allowed as long as they're reasonable and not a mere alteration of terms. So the owner's acceptance of $11 would be a new consideration, making the agreement enforceable.

Wait, but in contract law, the consideration must be new and reasonable. The original contract included the consideration of receiving the books. The new terms add the consideration of paying more, which is reasonable. So the agreement is enforceable.

Wait, but let me think about the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds protects parties from being sued for breach of contract if the consideration was given within a certain time. The original contract was formed three days before the books were delivered. The original consideration was given (the books) three days before delivery. The consideration must be given within 30 days after the contract is created. So in this case, the books were delivered after 3 days, which is within the 30-day period. So the original consideration was given three days before delivery, which is within the statute period. So that's okay.

But what about the new consideration? The new agreement adds the consideration of payment. But payment is a consideration, but it's a new one. The consideration for the payment is the payment itself, not the books. Wait, no, the payment is another consideration for the books. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the original contract included the consideration of the books. The new terms add the consideration of the payment. So the new consideration is the payment. But in some cases, the consideration must be the same for both parties. Wait, no, the consideration is what's agreed upon between the parties. So the original consideration was the books, the new consideration is the payment.

So perhaps the new agreement is a new consideration. So if the consideration (the payment) is new, does that affect the enforceability?

Wait, no. The consideration for the contract is the books. The consideration for the new agreement is the payment. So the new agreement is a new consideration. But is that a problem? Or is the original contract's consideration sufficient?

Hmm, I'm a bit lost here. Let me think again.

The original contract's consideration was the books. The new terms add the consideration of payment. So the owner is now agreeing to pay $11 each, which is additional consideration. So the agreement is a new consideration, making the contract enforceable.

But wait, can a contract add new terms? I think so. The original contract was enforceable, and the new agreement is a new consideration, so it's enforceable.

Wait, but then let me look at the options. The options are about whether the new agreement is enforceable.

Looking at option E: enforceable because the increase in price wasn't agreed at the contract's formation. But that's not the issue. The new agreement is a new consideration, so E is incorrect.

Option F says it's enforceable because owner agreed. That's correct if the consideration is reasonable, but the options don't list that as a choice. So maybe the correct reasoning is that the new consideration is reasonable.

Wait, another point: the consideration for the books was given (the books) three days before delivery. The consideration for the payment is given (the payment) when the books are delivered? Or is it when they are received?

Wait, in the initial contract, the consideration was given three days before delivery. In the new agreement, the consideration is the payment when the books are delivered. But payment is a consideration, but it's a new consideration for the owner. So the consideration for the books is the same; the consideration for the payment is new.

Wait, but in the contract for the books, the consideration is the books. The new agreement is a new consideration, so the new agreement is enforceable because it's a new consideration.

Wait, but in some cases, a new consideration is required. Oh, wait, no. The consideration is the agreement to pay. So the consideration is the payment. So it's a new consideration.

So I think the owner's agreement is enforceable because it's a new consideration. So which option is that?

Looking at the options:

F: enforceable because the owner agreed to the new terms.

That's a possible option, but I'm not sure if that's the right reasoning.

Wait, another possibility: the new consideration is not reasonable, so the agreement is unenforceable.

But in this case, the increase is only a $1 per book, which is a small amount. So that's reasonable. So F might be correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: the consideration for the books was given three days before delivery. So the consideration was given before the books were delivered. But the consideration for the payment is when the books are delivered, which is after the original contract.

But the consideration for the payment is a new consideration, so the agreement is enforceable.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another point: the consideration for the books is given (the books) three days before delivery, which is within the statute of frauds. So that's okay.

The consideration for the payment is a new consideration, but the consideration for the payment is the payment itself, which I'm not sure if that's a new consideration. Wait, the consideration for the payment is the amount paid, but the payment is a consideration for the books.

Alternatively, maybe the consideration for the books is the books, which were given before delivery, and the consideration for the payment is the payment, which is a new consideration. So the new agreement is a new consideration, making it enforceable.

So looking back at the options, I think F is correct: the owner agreed to the new terms.

Wait, but another thought: Some jurisdictions require that the consideration be the same for both parties. If the original consideration was the books, and the new consideration is the payment, that's a different consideration. So that's allowed.

So the answer is F: enforceable because owner agreed to new terms.

Wait, but another angle: the original contract was a written agreement for $10 each. The publisher corrected the error. The owner agreed to pay $11 each.

Wait, perhaps the original contract's terms are for the books, and the new terms are for the payment. But if the books were delivered after the payment was made, that's okay because the payment is a new consideration.

So, the new agreement is for $11 each, which is a new consideration, making it enforceable.

So the correct answer is F: enforceable, because owner agreed to new terms.
</think>

The law requires that contracts meet the requirements of a valid contract, which includes reasonable, agreed-upon consideration. The original contract was in writing and in place, so it stands. The publisher corrected the error by agreeing to a higher price and promised payment, which the owner agreed to. The new consideration for the payment is reasonable and agreed upon at the contract's formation. The original consideration for the books was given three days before delivery, which is within the statute of frauds period. The new consideration for the payment is a new agreement, making the owner's agreement enforceable.
