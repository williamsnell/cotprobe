Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. 

The problem is about the Dumas bulb, which I remember is a device used to measure the volume of a gas. The setup is that the Dumas bulb initially contains n moles of nitrogen at 0.5 atm pressure and a temperature of T degrees Kelvin. Then, 0.01 moles of oxygen are added, and to maintain the same pressure, the bulb needs to be cooled to 10°C. We have to find n and T.

Hmm, right. I think I'll need to use the ideal gas law here. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, since the pressure is the same after adding oxygen, maybe I can set up two equations and solve for n and T.

Let me break it down. Initially, the bulb has only N₂: so P1 = n₁ R T₁ / V, where V is the volume, T is temperature in Kelvin, P is pressure, n is moles, and R is the gas constant.

After adding O₂, the total moles change. So n₂ = n + 0.01. The pressure remains the same, so P2 = P1. But T₂ is 10°C, which is 283 K (since 10 + 273 = 283). 

So, using the ideal gas law again for the second scenario:
P2 V = n₂ R T₂.

Since P1 = P2, I can set the two equations equal to each other:

n₁ R T₁ / V = (n + 0.01) R T₂ / V.

Wait, I can cancel R and V from both sides. That leaves me with n₁ T₁ = (n + 0.01) T₂.

I know n₁ is n, T₁ is T, and T₂ is 283 K. So substituting:

n * T = (n + 0.01) * 283.

Let me write that as nT = 283(n + 0.01). 

I can rearrange this to solve for n. Let's expand the right side:

nT = 283n + 2.83.

Then, bring all terms to one side:

nT - 283n = 2.83.

Factor out n:

n (T - 283) = 2.83.

So, n = 2.83 / (T - 283).

But wait, I don't know T yet. I need another equation or way to find T. Hmm, but perhaps I can use PV = nRT in the initial case.

Initial case: P1 V = n R T.

n = (P1 V)/(R T).

But I don't know V, but wait, the bulb volume is given as 2 liters. So V = 2 L. But I should make sure about units: R is in L·atm/(mol·K), so that's correct.

So, n = (0.5 atm * 2 L) / (R * T).

But what's R? I think R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Let me plug that in.

Wait, but in this equation, I have n in terms of T. Let me think: I have two equations, but I'm getting stuck because I have two variables, n and T. 

Wait, but from the first equation, I derived that n = 2.83/(T - 283). Let me call this equation (1).

But I can also express n in terms of T from the initial ideal gas law.

Wait, perhaps I can plug equation (1) into the initial equation. Let's see.

We have n = 2.83/(T - 283), so substituting into the initial equation:

n = (0.5 * 2) / (0.0821 * T) = 1.0 / (0.0821 T) ≈ 12.185 / T.

Wait, but from equation (1), n is 2.83/(T-283). So:

2.83/(T-283) = 12.185 / T.

Cross multiply:

2.83 * T = 12.185 (T - 283).

Expanding the right side:

2.83T = 12.185T - (12.185 * 283).

Calculate 12.185 * 283. Let's see, 12 * 283 = 3396. 0.185 * 283 is approximately 52.355. So total is about 3396 + 52.355 = 3448.355.

So:

2.83 T = 12.185 T - 3448.355.

Bring all terms to left:

2.83 T - 12.185 T = -3448.355.

Which is -9.355 T = -3448.355.

Divide both sides by -9.355:

T = 3448.355 / 9.355 ≈ Let's compute that.

Compute 3448.355 ÷ 9.355.

Hmm, 9.355 * 368 = let's see, 9 * 368 is 3312. 0.355 * 368 ≈ 130. So 3312 + 130 is 3442. Close to 3448.355. So, 368 * 9.355 = 3442. So 3448.355 -3442 = 6.355. So 6.355 / 9.355 ≈ 0.675. So T ≈ 368.675 K. Rounded to about 369 K.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately.

Compute 3448.355 / 9.355.

Let me do it step by step.

9.355 * 367 = ?

Well, 9 * 367 = 3303. 0.355 * 367 = approx 129.785. So total is 3303 +129.785= 3432.785.

Subtract from 3448.355: 3448.355 -3432.785 = 15.57.

Now, 15.57 /9.355 ≈ 1.66. So 367 + 1.66 ≈ 368.66 K. So T is approximately 368.66 K.

Wait, but the options have T as 283, 310, etc. This doesn't match. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial setup. Let me go back.

Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express the equations.

Alternative approach: Let me write the two equations.

Equation 1: P1 V = n R T → 0.5 * 2 = n * R * T → 1 = n R T.

Equation 2: After adding O₂, n₂ = n + 0.01, P2 = P1, T₂=283 K.

So, P2 V = n₂ R T₂ → 0.5 * 2 = (n + 0.01) * R * 283 → 1 = (n + 0.01) * 283 R.

But from equation 1, n R T = 1. Let me express R T as (1)/n.

So equation 2 becomes 1 = (n + 0.01) * 283 * (1/n).

So, 1 = (n + 0.01) * 283 / n.

Multiply both sides by n: n = 283 (n + 0.01).

Which gives n = 283n + 2.83 → n - 283n =2.83 → -282n=2.83 → n= 2.83 / (-282) → n is negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be right. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the algebra.

Wait, equation 2 after substitution: 1 = (n + 0.01) * (283 R) / R? Wait, no.

Wait, wait, equation 2 from the ideal gas law is:

( (n +0.01 ) * R * 283 ) = 1.

Because P2 V = n₂ R T₂. P2 is 0.5 atm, V is 2 L, T₂ is 283 K. So:

0.5 atm * 2 L = (n + 0.01) * R * 283 K → 1 = (n +0.01) * R * 283.

But from equation 1: 1 = n R T. So R = 1/(n T).

Substitute R into equation 2:

1 = (n +0.01) * (1/(n T)) * 283.

So 1 = (n +0.01) * 283 / (n T).

Multiply both sides by n T: n T = 283 (n + 0.01).

Which gives n T = 283 n + 2.83.

Rearranging: n T - 283 n = 2.83 → n (T - 283) = 2.83.

So n = 2.83 / (T - 283). 

But wait, earlier when I tried this, I substituted n into the initial equation and got a T way above 360 K, but in the options, the possible Ts are all below 300 K or 283 K. So this suggests that my setup is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution step. Let me re-express equation 1 correctly.

Wait, equation 1 is P V = n R T.

P is 0.5 atm, V is 2 L. So 0.5 * 2 = 1 = n R T.

Equation 2 is P V = (n + 0.01) R T₂.

P is 0.5, V 2, T₂ 283: 0.5 * 2 = 1 = (n + 0.01) R (283).

But from equation 1, n R T = 1 → R = 1/(n T). Substitute into equation 2:

1 = (n +0.01) * (1/(n T)) * 283.

Which simplifies to 1 = 283 (n + 0.01) / (n T).

Multiply both sides by n T: n T = 283 (n +0.01).

Which brings us back to n(T - 283) = 283 * 0.01 → n = (283 * 0.01) / (T - 283).

Wait, 283 * 0.01 is 2.83. So n = 2.83/(T - 283).

But in this equation, n is positive when T is greater than 283 K. So T must be higher than 283.

Wait, but earlier calculation with T=368 K gives n=2.83/(368-283) = 2.83 / 85 ≈ 0.0332. That's one of the options, option B: n=0.0332, T=367K.

But wait, let me check if this makes sense. When T is 367 K, n is 2.83/(367-283) = 2.83 /84 ≈ 0.0335.

Wait, but let me plug back into the initial equation. Let's compute n R T.

n = 0.0332, T=367. R is 0.0821.

nRT = 0.0332 * 0.0821 * 367.

Compute 0.0332 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.002725. 0.002725 * 367 ≈ Let me calculate 0.002725 * 300 = 0.8175, and 0.002725 * 67 is about 0.1821. So total is about 0.8175 + 0.1821= 1.0 K atm·L/(mol). But wait, nRT must equal 1 (from equation 1). So 0.0332 * 0.0821 * 367 ≈ 1.0? Let me compute more precisely.

0.0332 * 0.0821 = 0.002725 (approx).

0.002725 * 367 = ?

367 * 0.002725 = ?

Well, 300 *0.002725=0.8175, 67 *0.002725 = 0.1821. So 0.8175 + 0.1821 = 0.9996, which is approximately 1.0. So that works.

Now, after adding O₂, the total moles is 0.0332 +0.01=0.0432.

The pressure should stay the same, so let's check if the new n₂ * R * T₂ =1.

n₂=0.0432, T₂=283.

n₂ R T₂ = 0.0432 * 0.0821 * 283.

Let me compute that:

0.0432 *0.0821 = 0.003539.

0.003539 * 283 ≈

Well, 0.0035 * 283 = 0.9905, 0.000039 * 283 ≈ 0.0110. So total is about 0.9905 +0.0110=1.0015. Approximately 1.0 atm·L/(mol).

Which is the same as the initial pressure of 1.0 atm·L/(mol), so that's correct.

So the initial calculation gives n=0.0332 and T=367 K.

Looking back at the options, option B is n=0.0332, T=367 K.

But wait, the options include option B as (n=0.0332, T=367), which seems correct.

But wait, another approach: Let's think about the change in moles and temperature.

Initially, n1 moles at T1= T.

After adding 0.01 moles, n2=n1+0.01, and the temperature is lowered to 283 K, causing the pressure to remain same. So we can set up equations based on the initial and final states.

n₁ * R * T = 1 (from ideal gas law, since P1 V =n1 R T)

n₂ * R * 283 = 1 (same P, V)

So,

n2 = (1) / (R * 283 )

But n2 =n1 +0.01.

So, n1 +0.01 = (1) / ( R * 283 )

But from the first equation, n1 = 1/(R T).

So,

1/(R T) +0.01 = 1/( R * 283 )

Multiply both sides by R:

1/T + 0.01 R = 1/283.

Wait, but R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), so:

0.01 * 0.0821 = 0.000821.

So,

1/T = (1/283) - 0.000821.

Compute 1/283 ≈0.003534.

0.003534 - 0.000821=0.002713.

So,

1/T=0.002713 → T=1/0.002713 ≈368 K.

Which is about 368 K, but our options don't have 368 K. They have 367.

Hmmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let's redo this approach.

We have two equations:

n1 R T = 1  --> equation1

(n1 +0.01) R T2 =1 --> equation2

Where T2=283.

Substituting equation1 into equation2:

(n1 +0.01) R (283) =1.

But equation1 gives n1 R T =1 --> n1 R = 1/(T).

Substituting into equation2:

( (1/(T) ) + 0.01 ) * R * 283 = 1.

Wait, no: we have equation2 = (n1 +0.01) R T2 =1.

But from equation1, n1 R T =1 → n1 R = 1/(T).

So, equation2 becomes:

( (1/T) + 0.01 ) * R * 283 =1.

Wait, no, equation2 is (n1 +0.01) R T2 =1. We can write this as:

n1 R T2 + 0.01 R T2 =1.

But n1 R T =1, so n1 R T = T * (1/T) )=1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor in equation1 into equation2.

Since equation1 is n1 R T =1, equation2 is (n1 +0.01) R T2=1.

Let me express equation2 as:

n1 R T2 + 0.01 R T2 =1.

But from equation1, n1 R T =1 → n1 R T =1.

Let me see if I can express this in terms of equation1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write equation2 as:

(n1 +0.01) R T2 =1.

Multiply both sides by T:

(n1 +0.01) R T2 T = T.

But that's getting me nowhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express equation2 in terms of equation1.

Wait, equation2: (n1 +0.01) R T2 =1.

But equation1: n1 R T=1.

So, from equation1, n1 R T =1 → n1 R =1/(T).

Substitute into equation2:

( (1/(T)) +0.01 ) R T2 =1.

Simplify:

( (1/(T) +0.01 ) * R ) * T2 =1.

Wait, but R is a constant. Let me factor R:

( (1/(T) +0.01 ) * R ) * T2 =1.

Which can be written as:

(1/(T) +0.01 ) * R * T2 =1.

But R is 0.0821, T2 is 283.

So,

(1/(T) +0.01 ) * 0.0821 * 283 =1.

Compute 0.0821 *283.

0.0821 * 283 = let me compute 0.08 *283=22.64, 0.0021 *283≈0.5943 → total ≈23.2343.

So,

(1/T +0.01) * 23.2343 =1.

Let me write this as:

(1/T) *23.2343 +0.01 *23.2343 =1.

Compute 0.01 *23.2343=0.232343.

So,

(23.2343)/T +0.232343 =1.

Subtract 0.232343:

23.2343/T = 1 -0.232343 =0.767657.

So,

T= 23.2343 / 0.767657 ≈ 23.2343 /0.767657.

Compute 23.2343 ÷ 0.767657.

Well, 0.767657 *30=23.02971. Close to 23.2343.

So, 0.767657 *30.3= ?

0.767657 *30 =23.02971.

0.767657 *0.3=0.230297.

Total=23.02971 +0.230297=23.26.

But the numerator is 23.2343, which is a bit less than 23.26.

So, T≈30.3.

Which is about 30.3 K.

But none of the options match. The options with T below 300 K, but the correct T is around 30 K, which is not present.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the rearrangement.

Let me go back to equation 1 and 2.

From equation1: n1 R T =1.

From equation2: (n1 +0.01) R T2 =1.

Divide equation2 by equation1:

[(n1 +0.01) R T2 ] / [n1 R T ] =1/1 → [ (n1 +0.01) T2 ] / [n1 T ] =1.

So,

(n1 +0.01) T2 =n1 T.

Rearranged: n1 T -n1 T2 =0.01 T2 → n1 (T -T2) )=0.01 T2.

So,

n1 = 0.01 T2 / (T -T2).

Since T2 is 283, T is 283 (or higher).

Wait, but if n1 is positive, T must be greater than T2, which is 283.

So,

n1 = 0.01 *283 / (T -283) → n1= 2.83/(T -283).

Then, from equation1, n1 R T =1 → (2.83/(T -283)) * R T =1.

Multiply both sides by (T -283):

2.83 R T = (T -283).

Expressed as:

2.83 R T = T -283.

Bring all terms to left:

2.83 R T - T +283 =0.

Factor T:

T (2.83 R -1) +283=0.

But for this to be valid, the coefficient of T must be zero, because otherwise it's a linear equation in T, which would have a unique solution. Wait, but this would require:

2.83 R -1 =0 → R = 1/(2.83) ≈0.353.

But R is 0.0821, so this is impossible.

Thus, the only conclusion is that the equation can't be satisfied except when 2.83 R -1 =0, which isn't the case. Hence, perhaps the only way this is possible is if there's another approach.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the two moles of gas. Initially, there are n moles, then after adding 0.01, it's n+0.01.

The temperature drops from T to T2=283 K.

The pressure remains same.

So, using the combined gas law:

P1 V1 / T1 = P2 V2 / T2.

But since P1 = P2, V1 = V2=2 L, so:

V1 / T1 = V2 / T2 → 2 /T1 =2/283 → T1=283 K.

But wait, that's the same as the initial temperature. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct way is to use the combined gas law correctly.

Wait, the combined gas law is (P1 V1) / T1 = (P2 V2) / T2.

Since P1 = P2, V1 = V2 = 2 L.

So,

(1 * 2) / T1 = (1 * 2) / T2 → 2/T1 = 2/T2 → T1=T2 → T=283 K.

But that's not the case because the T in the options is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe the initial setup should be based on the initial and final conditions.

Wait, let me try this approach.

The initial conditions are V=2 L, pressure P=0.5 atm, temperature T1= T.

After adding 0.01 moles, the total moles is n₂ =n +0.01.

The temperature is lowered to T2=283 K.

The pressure remains the same: P=0.5 atm.

So, using the ideal gas law for initial and final states.

For initial state: P V =n R T.

For final state: P V =n₂ R T₂.

Since P, V, R are constants, we can set the two equations equal:

n R T =n₂ R T₂.

Cancel R, and you get n T = n₂ T₂.

But n₂ =n +0.01.

So,

n T = (n +0.01) T₂.

We can write this as:

n T = (n +0.01) T₂ → n T = n T₂ + 0.01 T₂.

Rearranged: n (T - T₂) )=0.01 T₂.

So,

n = (0.01 T₂) / (T - T₂).

Now, plug in T₂=283.

n= (0.01 *283) / (T -283).

n= 2.83/(T -283).

But from the initial state equation: n R T =1.

n R T =1 → n R = 1/(T).

So,

n = 1/(R T).

Substitute into the equation for n:

1/(R T) = 2.83/(T -283).

Multiply both sides by R T (T-283):

(T -283) = 2.83 R T.

Rearranged:

T -283 = 2.83 R T.

Bring all terms to one side:

T -2.83 R T =283.

Factor T:

T (1 -2.83 R )=283.

Now, compute 2.83 R.

R is 0.0821.

2.83 *0.0821 = ?

Compute 2 *0.0821=0.1642.

0.8 *0.0821=0.06568.

0.03*0.0821=0.002463.

So, 0.1642 +0.06568=0.22988 +0.002463=0.232343.

So, 2.83 R ≈0.2323.

So,

1 - 0.2323 =0.7677.

So,

T = 283 /0.7677.

Compute 283 /0.7677.

0.7677 × 367 =?

Compute 0.7677 *300=230.31.

0.7677 *60=46.062.

0.7677 *7=5.3739.

So, 230.31 +46.062=276.372 +5.3739=281.7459.

Which is close to 283.

So, 367 * 0.7677=281.7459.

The difference is 283 -281.7459=1.2541.

So, 1.2541 /0.7677=1.641.

So, T≈367 +1.641=368.641 K.

Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 283 /0.7677.

0.7677 *367 =281.7459.

As above.

So,

283 -281.7459 =1.2541.

So, 1.2541 /0.7677≈1.641.

So, T≈367 +1.641=368.641 K.

But our options don't have this. The options have T=367, which is close, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me compute 283 /0.7677.

Well, 0.7677 *367 =281.7459.

The difference is 283 -281.7459=1.2541.

So, 1.2541 /0.7677=1.641.

So, 367 +1.641=368.641.

So, T≈368.64 K.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option B, which is T=367.

But let me re-examine the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial setup was incorrect. Let me try another approach.

We have the initial pressure P1 = 0.5 atm.

After adding 0.01 moles, pressure is still 0.5 atm. So, the change in moles and temperature must result in the same pressure.

So, using the ideal gas law:

P1 V1 / T1 = P2 V2 / T2.

But since P1 = P2 and V1 = V2, we have:

T1 = T2.

Which would imply T1 = T2 =283 K.

But that's not possible because the initial temperature must be higher than 283 K.

This suggests that the options provided may not include the correct answer, but among the given options, option B (n=0.0332, T=367) seems correct.

Wait, but earlier calculations show that n=0.0332 and T=367 K gives the correct pressure.

So, the correct answer is option B.

To solve the problem, we use the ideal gas law and the given conditions. The ideal gas law is:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

### Step 1: Initial Conditions
Initially, the system has \( n_1 \) moles at temperature \( T \), and the pressure is \( P_1 = 0.5 \, \text{atm} \). The volume is \( V = 2 \, \text{L} \). Using the ideal gas law:

\[
P_1 V = n_1 R T \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_1 R T = 0.5 \times 2 = 1 \, \text{L·atm}
\]

### Step 2: After Adding Moles
After adding \( 0.01 \, \text{moles} \), the total moles become \( n_2 = n_1 + 0.01 \). The volume remains \( V = 2 \, \text{L} \), and the pressure remains \( P_2 = 0.5 \, \text{atm} \). Using the ideal gas law again:

\[
P_2 V = n_2 R T_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_2 R T_2 = 0.5 \times 2 = 1 \, \text{L·atm}
\]

### Step 3: Relating Initial and Final States
From the initial and final states:

\[
n_1 R T = n_2 R T_2
\]

Cancel \( R \):

\[
n_1 T = n_2 T_2
\]

Substitute \( n_2 = n_1 + 0.01 \):

\[
n_1 T = (n_1 + 0.01) T_2
\]

Rearrange:

\[
n_1 (T - T_2) = 0.01 T_2
\]

Solve for \( n_1 \):

\[
n_1 = \frac{0.01 T_2}{T - T_2}
\]

### Step 4: Using Initial Conditions
From the initial state:

\[
n_1 R T = 1 \, \text{L·atm}
\]

Substitute \( n_1 \):

\[
\left( \frac{0.01 T_2}{T - T_2} \right) R T = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{0.01 T_2 R T}{T - T_2} = 1
\]

Multiply both sides by \( T - T_2 \):

\[
0.01 T_2 R T = T - T_2
\]

Rearrange:

\[
T (1 - 0.01 R T_2) = T_2
\]

### Step 5: Substituting Values
Given:
- \( T_2 = 283 \, \text{K} \)
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

Substitute \( T_2 = 283 \):

\[
T (1 - 0.01 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 283) = 283
\]

Calculate \( 0.01 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 283 \):

\[
0.01 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.000821; \quad 0.000821 \cdot 283 = 0.2323
\]

Thus:

\[
T (1 - 0.2323) = 283 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T (0.7677) = 283
\]

Solve for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{283}{0.7677} \approx 368.64 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 6: Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated temperature is:

**Option B: \( n = 0.0332 \, \text{moles}, T = 367 \, \text{K} \)**
