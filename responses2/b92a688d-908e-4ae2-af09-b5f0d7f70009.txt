Okay, so I need to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q. Hmm, I remember that the degree is the dimension of the field extension as a vector space over Q. So, first, let me think about what field we're dealing with here.

Wait, sqrt(18) can be simplified. Since 18 is 9*2, sqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2) which is 3*sqrt(2). Oh, so Q(sqrt(18)) is the same as Q(3*sqrt(2)), but that's just Q(sqrt(2)) because multiplying by a rational number (3) doesn't change the field. So, sqrt(18) doesn't add anything new to the field. So, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is actually the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).

So now, the problem reduces to finding [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q]. I've heard that when you have two fields like this, you can multiply their degrees if they're extensions over Q and they're linearly disjoint. But I need to recall how to calculate that.

I remember that [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] is the product of the degrees of each extension if they are linearly disjoint. So, let's see: [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] is 2 because sqrt(2) has degree 2 over Q. Similarly, [Q(sqrt(3)) : Q] is also 2. Now, are these extensions linearly disjoint? I think that's the case here because sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both quadratic and their minimal polynomials over Q don't share any common factors, so their compositum should have degree 4.

Wait, let me think again. The compositum Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] * [Q(sqrt(3)) : Q] / [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))]. Hmm, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, let's consider the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)). Since sqrt(3) isn't in Q(sqrt(2)), the minimal polynomial is x^2 - 3. So, [Q(sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] is 2. Therefore, the degree of the compositum is 2 * 2 = 4. So, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] is 4.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm that. Alternatively, another approach: Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is a field extension of Q. Let's find a basis for it as a Q-vector space. A basis could be {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)} because sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) = sqrt(6). So, that's four elements, meaning the degree is 4.

So, putting it all together, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is a degree 4 extension over Q. Therefore, the degree of the field extension is 4. Looking at the options, option G is 4. So I think the correct answer is G.

The field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q simplifies to Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). The degree of this extension is 4, as it is spanned by {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)}. Thus, the correct option is G: 4.

Answer: G
