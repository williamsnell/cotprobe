Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about partitioning a set of 6 distinct letters into 3 non-empty groups where each group has at least 2 letters. Hmm, I remember that when you need to split a set into groups, it's related to combinations and maybe something about permutations. 

Wait, the question says non-empty groups and each must have at least 2 letters. So with 6 letters, and 3 groups, each group has 2 letters because 2*3=6. That makes sense. So it's about dividing the 6 letters into 3 pairs.

How do I calculate that? I think the formula for dividing a set into groups where each group has the same size is (n-1)! divided by the product of (k!^m), where m is the number of groups. Wait, maybe that's for indistinct groups. Or is it something else?

Alternatively, I remember that the number of ways to partition a set into groups of equal size is (n!)/( (k!^m) * m! ), where m is the number of groups. So here, n is 6, m is 3, and each group has 2 letters. So that would be 6! / (2!^3 * 3!). Let me calculate that.

6! is 720. 2! is 2, so 2^3 is 8. 3! is 6. So denominator is 8 * 6 = 48. 720/48 is 15. Wait, but wait, another thoughtâ€”does this formula apply when the groups are indistinct? Or in this problem, since the groups are labeled (like Group 1, Group 2, Group 3), maybe it's different.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is for when the groups are indistinct. But in the problem, the groups are distinct because they're labeled, so maybe I shouldn't divide by 3!. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let's think about the process. I can start by choosing 2 letters out of 6 for the first group. Then, from the remaining 4, choose 2 for the second group. The last 2 form the third group. So that's C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2). But this counts each partition multiple times because the order of selecting the groups doesn't matter. 

Wait, for example, choosing group A first, then B, then C is the same as choosing group B first, then A, then C. So we've overcounted by a factor equal to the number of ways to order the groups, which is 3! =6. So the total number would be (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) divided by 3! .

Let me compute that. (6C2) is 15, 4C2 is 6, 2C2 is 1. Multiply them: 15 *6 *1 =90. Then divide by 6 (3!): 90/6=15. So that's 15 ways.

Looking at the options, 15 is option D. But wait, let me make sure. Are there any other constraints? The problem says each group must have at least 2 letters, but in this case, since we're dividing into 3 groups, each must have exactly 2 letters. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be 15, which is option D.

The problem requires partitioning 6 distinct letters into 3 non-empty groups, each with at least 2 letters. 

To solve this, we can use the combination formula for dividing the set into groups. Since each group must have exactly 2 letters, we calculate the number of ways to choose the groups as follows:

1. Choose 2 letters out of 6: C(6,2) = 15.
2. Choose 2 letters from the remaining 4: C(4,2) = 6.
3. The last 2 letters form the third group.

Multiply these: 15 * 6 = 90. However, since the order of the groups doesn't matter, we divide by 3! to account for overcounting: 90 / 6 = 15.

Answer: D: 15
