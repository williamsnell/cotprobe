Okay, so I've got this problem about a radio with some taxes and payment terms. Let's see. The question has two parts: first, finding the cash price, and second, the installment price. Let me break it down.

The radio costs $38.00. Plus, there's 3% excise tax and 4% sales tax. The customer is buying it on a $10.00 down and three payments of $11.60 each. So, I need to calculate both the cash price and the installment price.

Wait, wait. Cash price... so that's the total price before any discounts or taxes. So the radio is $38, plus taxes. Let's calculate the total tax first. Oh wait, the question says to include both the excise and sales tax. So the total tax rate would be 3% +4% =7%. So 7% of $38 is 0.07 * 38. Let me compute that: 0.07 *38 is 2.66. So total tax is $2.66. So the total price including taxes is $38 + $2.66 = $40.66.

But wait, that's the price after taxes. But the customer is buying it with a $10 down, so the cash price is what they're paying initially. Let me think. The cash price is the amount they pay upfront, which in this case is $10.00 down. But wait, the problem is asking for the cash price, which I think is the total cost minus the down payment? Or is it the total including taxes?

Wait, no. Cash price is just the total cost, including taxes. The down payment is part of the purchase, and the installment payments are the remaining amount. So perhaps the cash price is the total after adding taxes.

But wait, in the problem statement, part (A) says, "What is the cash price of the radio?" So the cash price is the total, including all taxes. So 38 + 2.66 (taxes) = $40.66. Hmm, but looking at the options, some have $40.71 as the cash price. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the tax calculation.

Wait, 3% of 38: 0.03*38=1.14. 4% of 38: 0.04*38=1.52. So total tax is 1.14 + 1.52=2.66. So total price is 38 + 2.66=40.66. So cash price is $40.66. But the options have $40.71 as the cash price in option A. Hmm, maybe it's rounded.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. Wait, 3% of 38 is 1.14, 4% is 1.52. So 1.14+1.52=2.66. So 38 +2.66=40.66. But the options don't have this. Oh wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option A says cash price is $40.71 and installment price $44.80. So I must have miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the 3% and 4% are applied to the sale price, but I'm adding them to the original price.

Wait, maybe the way the taxes are structured. The excise tax is 3% on the $38, and sales tax is 4% on the $38, plus the down payment. Or perhaps, the 3% and 4% are applied to the total amount after the down payment. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says the radio costs $38.00 plus 3% excise tax and 4% sales tax. So maybe the total price is 38 plus 3% plus 4%, so 38*(1 + 0.03 + 0.04) =38*1.07=40.66, same as before. So cash price is 40.66. But the options don't have that. Hmmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the total including the taxes, and then the down payment is part of the cash price.

Wait, the cash price is the total, including all the taxes, so 40.66. But none of the options have that. Looking at the options, option B says cash price $40.71, which is close. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the 3% is applied to the $38, and the 4% is applied to the sales price, but the sales tax is on the amount after the down payment. Wait, that's more complex.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. It says, "a radio costing $38.00 plus 3% excise tax and 4% sales tax may be purchased for $10.00 down and 3 payments of $11.60."

Ah, so the purchase includes the 3% and 4% taxes, but the initial purchase price is $10.00 down. So the cash price would be the amount paid after the down. Hmm, perhaps the cash price is the price after the $10 down, but before the taxes. Or maybe the down is a separate payment, and the cash price is the price before the down. Let's think.

Wait, the cash price is the total cost of the radio, including taxes. So the total cost is $40.66. But the options have $40.71, which is about 3 cents higher. Maybe my calculation is off due to decimal precision. Let me recalculate.

38 * 1.03 = 38 * 1.03. Let me compute that. 38*1=38, 38*0.03=1.14. So 38 +1.14=39.14. Then, adding 4% of 38: 39.14*(1+0.04)=39.14*1.04. Let's compute 39.14 *1.04.

39.14 * 0.04 = 1.5656. So 39.14 +1.5656 =40.7056. So approximately $40.71. Ah, so that's where the $40.71 comes from. So the cash price is $40.71, which matches option A and B.

Wait, but option A says cash price is $40.71, and the installment is $44.80, which is option A's installment. So option A would be correct.

But wait, the problem is part (A) is about the cash price. So the cash price is the total after taxes, which is $40.71. The installment price is the sum of the three payments, which is 3 * $11.60 = $34.80. But looking at the options, none of the cash prices match that. Wait, because the installment price in option A is $44.80, which doesn't match the $34.80 I calculated. So perhaps I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the structure of the payment. The problem says "purchased for $10.00 down and 3 payments of $11.60." So the total amount paid is $10 + 3*$11.60 = $10 + $34.80 = $44.80. But that's the total amount paid, which would be the installment price. So the installment price is $44.80, which matches option A's installment.

So, putting it together: cash price is $40.71, installment is $44.80. So option A is correct.

Let me check the options again.

Option A: Cash price: $40.71, Installment price: $44.80.

Yes, that matches. So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves calculating the cash price and installment price of a radio with specific taxes and payment terms. The radio costs $38.00, with 3% excise tax and 4% sales tax. The customer pays $10.00 down and three payments of $11.60. 

**Cash Price Calculation:**
1. Total tax on $38.00: 3% + 4% = 7% of $38.00 = $2.66.
2. Total price including taxes: $38.00 + $2.66 = $40.66.
3. The $10.00 down and three payments of $11.60 sum to $44.80, which is the installment price.

**Installment Price:**
- Total payments: $10.00 + 3 * $11.60 = $44.80.

**Matching Options:**
- Cash price: $40.71 (closest to $40.66).
- Installment price: $44.80.

**Answer:**
The correct option is **A**, where the cash price is $40.71 and the installment price is $44.80.
