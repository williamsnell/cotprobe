Question:

A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate, who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and admitted to the hospital yesterday. The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have "caught the same bug." Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2째C (98.9째F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?

Options:

A: Administer a tetanus shot
B: Prescribe azithromycin
C: Administer the meningococcal vaccine
D: Prescribe ibuprofen
E: Prescribe penicillin
F: Administer the pneumococcal vaccine
G: Prescribe amoxicillin
H: Prescribe doxycycline
I: Prescribe rifampin
J: No intervention is needed at this time

Okay, so I've got this question about a 16-year-old girl who's been concerned about getting meningitis. Let's try to break this down. 

First, the patient is a 16-year-old girl. She feels well but is worried she might have caught the same bug. Her mom is concerned because her soccer teammate had meningococcal meningitis admitted to the hospital yesterday. So, the main issue here is the possibility of a bacterial infection, specifically meningitis, which can be spread through respiratory droplets. 

She shares a hotel room with a hospitalized girl. So, the patient is in contact with someone who's already been infected. That's a red flag because it can spread quickly. 

Her medical history is remarkable for asthma, which I think is relevant because infections can be influenced by breathing conditions. She's on inhaled albuterol, which is a cough suppressant. She's got normal vital signs: temperature 37.2째C (98.9째F), which is within normal range, pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Those are all within normal, so no obvious shock or signs of infection. 

The question is about choosing the most appropriate intervention. Let's look at the options: A to J. 

Option B is prescribing azithromycin. Oh wait, azithromycin is an antibiotic, not a vaccine. It's used for bacterial infections, especially in cases of bacterial meningitis. But wait, the patient is in a hospital room, and the other infected person is hospitalized. So maybe the patient is close, so maybe a vaccine is better. 

Option C is the meningococcal vaccine. That sounds right because the patient's team is from another state, so she might be close. The vaccine protects against the common bacterial cause of meningitis. Plus, it's an immunization, so it's a safe option. 

Option B is an antibiotic. While antibiotics can help manage a bacterial infection, the patient is close to someone who's already been infected. Administering an antibiotic could lead to serious complications like sepsis. Also, the question is about the most appropriate intervention, not necessarily treating the infection. So maybe the best choice is to prevent the infection from spreading.

Option D is ibuprofen. That's an antihistamine. But the patient is in a hotel room with someone who's already been infected, and the patient's symptoms are mild. There's no mention of any allergies to albuterol or other medications. Plus, the infection is likely bacterial, so treating it with antibiotics makes more sense.

Option E is penicillin. Penicillin is for bacterial infections, but again, the patient is close to someone with a bacterial infection. Using it could be risky for the patient. Also, the patient's symptoms are mild, so antibiotics might be the way to go.

Option F is the pneumococcal vaccine. Pneumococcal is another cause of meningitis, but the patient's history is with asthma and a soccer team (which is a different sport). The patient's mother is the one concerned, but the patient's own diagnosis is the main point. The patient's own diagnosis is from the team, so if the patient is close, she's in contact. The patient's own symptoms are mild, so maybe the vaccine is a better option than an antibiotic.

Option G is amoxicillin. That's another antibiotic, but again, the patient is close and the infection is likely bacterial. I think it's better to prevent the infection from spreading rather than treat it.

Option H is doxycycline. Another antibiotic, but same reasoning as B and G. It's used for infections where the main mode of transmission is through the air. Since the patient is close to an infected person, the best intervention is to prevent the infection from spreading, which would be a vaccination.

Option I is rifampin. That's another antibiotic, but again, it's for bacterial infections. If the patient is in close contact, the best is to prevent the infection from being spread.

So to recap: The patient is in the same room as someone who's already got a bacterial infection. She has mild symptoms. The main issue is preventing the spread of the infection, not treating it. So the best option is to administer the meningococcal vaccine. That's option C. Alternatively, if the patient's symptoms point towards a bacterial infection, they might consider an antibiotic, but the patient is in a hospital room, so the safest thing is to prevent the infection from being transmitted.

The patient is in a hospital room with an infected teammate from another state, making her in close contact. Her symptoms are mild, and the infection is likely bacterial. The best intervention is to prevent the spread of the infection, which is best achieved by administering the meningococcal vaccine, an immunization that protects against the common cause of meningitis.

Answer: C
