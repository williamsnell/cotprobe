Okay, so I have this question about Pizarro and the Inca empire. Hmm, I remember that Pizarro was a Spanish conquistador, right? He led the Spanish colonial army into the Inca Empire. The question asks why he was able to subdue the entire empire.

Let me think about each option. Option A says the Incas were suffering from a plague when Pizarro arrived. I don't think that's the main reason. I think he just arrived, not that they were sick.

Option B: the empire had never won the allegiance of the peoples it had conquered. That doesn't make sense. The empire's success wasn't because it had never won; that's more about the empire's success, not the cause of Pizarro's success.

Option C: the Incas were already weakened by a civil war. I don't recall that being a reason for Pizarro's success. He was successful because he was a leader, not because the Incas were weak.

Option D: the Incas were expecting Pizarro and willingly surrendered to him. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, I think I remember that. Pizarro was a Spanish conquistador, and he was willing to give up his position and the army to the Incas. So D might be the correct answer.

Option E: he arrived with a superior force of more than 80,000 soldiers. That's true, but it's more about the number of soldiers rather than why he was able to take the empire. It's a factor, but the main reason is his leadership and willingness to give up.

Option F: he used advanced technology that the Incas couldn't comprehend. I don't know much about that, but I think he used firearms and horses, not advanced tech.

Option G: his horses and guns frightened the Incas. I think he used horses, but I'm not sure about the technology part. Maybe not the main reason.

Option H: he had the support of other tribes. I don't think so. He was supported by the Spanish, not the Incas.

Option I: he was such a brilliant military strategist. That's true, but again, it's about his own skills, not the reason.

Option J: he manipulated the Incas into believing he was a god. That doesn't make sense either. Spanish were not like that.

Putting it together, the reason Pizarro was able to subdue the empire is because he was willing to give up his position, which led to the surrender of the Incas. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D, as Pizarro's willingness to surrender the Incas allowed him to capture the empire. 

Answer: D
