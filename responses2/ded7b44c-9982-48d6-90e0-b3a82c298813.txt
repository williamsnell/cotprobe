The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A motorist was traveling at 5 miles per hour when she became distracted, and negligently tapped the rear of another vehicle. A passenger in the struck vehicle had a rare medical condition that made her highly vulnerable to any slight physical impact or intrusion. The minimal impact caused the passenger to lightly bump her shoulder against the door, which triggered her rare immunosuppressant disease to surface. The passenger became permanently incapacitated from the impact. She sued the negligent motorist for all of her injuries. A physician submitted a report stating that the collision was a substantial factor in causing the disability. Has the plaintiff stated a claim for relief under prevailing legal principles?

Options:

A: No, because the motorist could not have predicted that such a small impact would have such severe consequences.
B: Yes, because the victim in this case is called a "predictably unpredictable plaintiff."
C: No, because the passenger's rare medical condition was not directly caused by the motorist.
D: Yes, because the motorist is always responsible for any harm caused by their negligent actions.
E: No, because the medical report did not conclusively prove that the collision was the sole cause of the disability.
F: Yes, because the law holds the defendant liable for all injuries, regardless of their severity or nature.
G: No, because the victim's psychosomatic reaction is usually held to be malingering under the law.
H: Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff "as he finds her."
I: No, because the motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries that are not of psychological origin.

Okay, so I have this legal question to tackle. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about negligence and claims for relief. The scenario is a motorist who was going too fast and hit a passenger who has a rare medical condition. The passenger got hurt and got sick because of the impact. The motorist is sued for all her injuries.

Hmm, the options are A through I. I need to figure out whether the plaintiff has stated a claim under the usual legal principles. The options are about whether the plaintiff is claiming negligence, whether the defendant should be held liable for all injuries, whether the plaintiff can claim unpredictably, and other factors like psychological factors or the law of negligence.

Let me break it down. The motorist was traveling at 5mph and hit someone negligently. The passenger has a rare condition which makes her highly vulnerable. She got hurt and got sick because of the impact. The motorist lost, and the medical report said the collision was a big factor. The question is whether the plaintiff has stated a claim.

Wait, the question says she "sued the negligent motorist for all of her injuries." So she is claiming negligence on her own, not on the defendant. But is that a claim for relief? In some states, a plaintiff can sue for negligence, regardless of whether they're claiming recovery. But in others, like some jurisdictions, the plaintiff must show that the defendant was negligent and that the harm was foreseeable. If the plaintiff doesn't show that, they might not be able to recover because they can't claim for negligence.

Looking at the options: 

A: No, because the motorist couldn't have predicted the impact. So the plaintiff is claiming negligence, but the defendant can't predict the harm in advance. The plaintiff might not be able to recover because negligence claims require the plaintiff to show that the defendant was negligent and that the harm was foreseeable.

B: Yes, because the victim is a "predictably unpredictable" plaintiff. Wait, this term isn't familiar to me. I think "predictably unpredictable" might refer to the plaintiff's inability to predict the outcome because of the medical condition. But I don't know if that's a recognized legal principle. In some cases, like in product liability or medical malpractice, the plaintiff might claim unpredictability. So if the plaintiff is unpredictable, they might not have a claim for negligence. But I'm not certain.

C: No, because the passenger's condition wasn't directly caused by the motorist. Oh, but the question says the motorist is negligent, so the cause of injury is due to the negligence. So maybe C is incorrect. Because the condition was a result of the collision, the same negligence.

D: Yes, because the motorist is always responsible. Well, in general negligence cases, the plaintiff is often liable because the defendant's actions were negligent. But I'm not sure if the law requires the plaintiff to be predictably or necessarily negligent in such cases. So D might be incorrect.

E: No, because the report didn't prove the collision was the sole cause. The plaintiff says she's a plaintiff because the collision caused her injury. But in negligence cases, the plaintiff can recover for any injury caused by negligence, regardless of whether the defendant's fault was the only cause. So E might not be a valid reason to say the plaintiff didn't state a claim.

F: Yes, because the law holds defendant liable for all injuries. But I'm pretty sure in negligence, the plaintiff can recover for all damages, but the defendant may be liable for the harm if it was foreseeable. So F might not be correct because the plaintiff would need to show that the harm was foreseeable.

G: No, because the condition was malingering. Malingering usually refers to the defendant's intent to cause harm, not the plaintiff's reaction. The plaintiff doesn't have to show that the defendant intended to cause harm. So G is probably incorrect.

H: Yes, because under the law, defendant is liable for all injuries, regardless of severity. So H is correct because the plaintiff isn't requiring the defendant to be only liable for foreseeable injuries. She can recover for all damages.

I: No, because the motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries. But the plaintiff is suing for all injuries, which would include non-foreseeable ones. So I is incorrect.

Wait, let me think again. The question is whether the plaintiff has stated a claim for relief under the usual principles. So, the plaintiff is claiming negligence, but can she recover?

In some states, the plaintiff can state a claim for negligence even if they're not claiming recovery. So the plaintiff's claim is about negligence, but whether she can recover under the law depends on whether the defendant was negligent and if the harm was foreseeable.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option E says the plaintiff didn't state the claim because the report didn't prove it was the sole cause. But the plaintiff's claim is about negligence, not about recovery. So E might not be correct because the plaintiff is claiming negligence, not recovery.

Option B says she is a "predictably unpredictable" plaintiff. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but if the plaintiff's condition isn't predictable, she might not be able to claim negligence. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Option F says the defendant is liable for all injuries. But I thought that in negligence, the plaintiff can recover for all damages, and the defendant is only liable for the harm if it was foreseeable. So F is incorrect because the plaintiff needs to show the harm was foreseeable, not just that they're a plaintiff.

Option H says the defendant is liable for all injuries, regardless of their severity. But the plaintiff is only claiming negligence, not recovery. So the defendant can be liable for the injury, regardless of whether it's foreseeable. So H is correct because the plaintiff isn't claiming recovery, just negligence.

Wait, the question is about whether the plaintiff has stated a claim. The options A through I are talking about the plaintiff's claim. So the main issue is whether she can recover for the injuries, regardless of whether she can recover for recovery.

So the main question is whether the plaintiff can recover for negligence. The defendant is liable for all damages, regardless of whether the harm was foreseeable. So the correct answer would be H: Yes, because in the law of negligence, the defendant is liable for all injuries regardless of their severity or nature. Because the plaintiff is only claiming negligence, not recovery.

Wait, but some states require the plaintiff to show that the harm was foreseeable. So if the plaintiff's condition was not directly caused by the motorist, and the report didn't prove the collision was the cause, then perhaps she can't claim for negligence because the harm wasn't foreseeable.

Wait, but the question is whether the plaintiff has stated a claim under the usual legal principles. So the main issue is whether she can make a claim for negligence.

So under the law, the defendant can be liable for all damages, regardless of whether the harm was foreseeable. Because the plaintiff is only claiming negligence, not recovery.

So the correct answer should be H: Yes, because under the law, the defendant is liable for all injuries, regardless of their severity or nature.

Wait, but is that right? I thought that in many states, the plaintiff is only required to prove negligence and that the harm was foreseeable. So if the plaintiff's condition isn't directly caused by the negligence, and the harm wasn't foreseeable, she might not be able to claim.

But the question is whether the plaintiff has "stated a claim for relief under prevailing legal principles." So the main issue is whether she can claim negligence, regardless of whether she can recover for recovery.

So in that case, the answer would be H: Yes, because the defendant is liable for all injuries regardless of their severity. Because the plaintiff is only claiming negligence, not recovery, the defendant is still liable for all damages.

Wait, but some states require that the harm be foreseeable. So if the plaintiff's condition wasn't directly caused by the defendant's negligence, and the report didn't prove the collision was the cause, then the harm isn't foreseeable, so the plaintiff can't claim for negligence because the harm isn't expected.

But the question is about whether the plaintiff has stated a claim, not whether she can recover for recovery. So the answer is H.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The options are about whether she has stated a claim for negligence.

The question is, has the plaintiff stated a claim for relief under the usual legal principles.

The usual principles are that the plaintiff must state a claim for negligence, but the defendant may have to show that the harm was foreseeable (under some states).

So in this case, since the plaintiff is suing for all her injuries, regardless of whether the harm was foreseeable, she has stated a claim for negligence. But the answer depends on whether she can recover for recovery.

But the options are about whether the plaintiff can claim, not whether recovery is possible.

So the main issue is whether she has stated a claim, which she has, but the question is about whether the defendant is liable for all injuries regardless of severity.

If the defendant is liable for all injuries regardless of severity, then H is correct.

But another point: under the law, the defendant is only liable for the harm if it was foreseeable. So if the plaintiff didn't show that, then she can't recover for recovery, but she can claim for negligence.

Wait, the question is whether the plaintiff has stated a claim. So the answer would be H: Yes, because the defendant is liable for all injuries regardless of their nature.

Wait, but no, because the plaintiff is only claiming negligence, not recovery. So perhaps the correct answer is H: Yes, because the defendant is liable for all injuries regardless of their severity.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: Yes, because the law holds the defendant liable for all injuries, regardless of their nature.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option.

Option A: No, because motorist couldn't predict impact. So she doesn't have a claim for negligence because the plaintiff can't show the harm was foreseeable. So if she can't claim, the answer is A.

But the option is about whether she has stated a claim. So the answer is that she did state a claim. So A would say she didn't have a claim, so H is correct.

But I'm a bit confused about what each option is saying.

The question is about whether the plaintiff has stated a claim under the usual legal principles. So the usual principles require the plaintiff to state a claim for negligence. So the answer would be that she has done so.

But the options are about whether the claim is valid, not whether she can recover for recovery. So the correct answer is H: Yes, because the defendant is liable for all injuries regardless of their nature. Because she's only claiming negligence, not recovery.

Wait, but perhaps another angle: if the plaintiff's condition was caused by the defendant's negligence, and the report indicates the collision was substantial, then the plaintiff's claim for negligence would be valid. But the issue is whether she can recover for her injuries, regardless of whether the harm was foreseeable.

So the main issue is whether she can claim for the negligence, which she can, but whether she can recover for the injury. That would depend on whether the harm was foreseeable.

But the question is about the claim, not recovery. So the answer is H.

So I think the correct answer is H: Yes, because the defendant is liable for all injuries regardless of their nature.

The question revolves around whether the plaintiff has stated a claim for relief under the usual legal principles, specifically regarding negligence. The motorist was negligent, and the plaintiff is suing for all her injuries. The key issue is whether the plaintiff can claim for negligence and whether the defendant is liable for all injuries, regardless of their severity.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The plaintiff has stated a claim for negligence because she is claiming that the motorist was negligent.
2. **Option B**: Incorrect. The term "predictably unpredictable" is not a recognized legal principle, and there is no evidence that the plaintiff is unable to predict the outcome due to the rare medical condition. The plaintiff's claim is about negligence, not unpredictability.
3. **Option C**: Incorrect. The rare medical condition is a result of the collision, not a direct cause of the plaintiff's injury. The collision is the cause of the injury.
4. **Option D**: Incorrect. The motorist is always responsible for any harm caused by their negligence, even if it is not of psychological origin. The plaintiff does not need to be predictably or necessarily negligent.
5. **Option E**: Incorrect. The report does not conclusively prove that the collision was the sole cause of the plaintiff's injury. The plaintiff's claim is about negligence, not recovery.
6. **Option F**: Incorrect. The law holds the defendant liable for all injuries, but the plaintiff is only claiming negligence, not recovery.
7. **Option G**: Incorrect. The plaintiff does not need to show that the defendant intended to cause harm; negligence is about the defendant's actions.
8. **Option H**: Correct. Under the law, the defendant is liable for all injuries, regardless of their severity or nature. The plaintiff is only claiming negligence, not recovery.
9. **Option I**: Incorrect. The motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries, not all possible injuries.

### Conclusion:
The plaintiff has stated a claim for negligence, as she is claiming that the motorist was negligent. The defendant is liable for all injuries, regardless of their nature, as per the law of negligence. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: H
