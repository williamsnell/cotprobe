Question:

A homeowner gave his friend a mortgage on his property to secure a loan from the friend to the homeowner in the amount of $100,000. The homeowner then gives an investor a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the investor to the homeowner in the amount of $80,000. The friend then records his mortgage. The homeowner then gives a bank a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the bank to the homeowner in the amount of $50,000. The investor then records. The bank then records. The homeowner lost his job and was unable to pay the mortgages on the property. In a foreclosure proceeding in which the friend, the investor, and the bank were parties, the property sold for $160,000. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. "What dollar amount, if any, should go to the friend?

Options:

A: $100,000. 00
B: $90,000.00
C: $160,000.00
D: $0. 00
E: $70,000.00
F: $60,000.00
G: $20,000.00
H: $50,000.00
I: $80,000. 00
J: $30,000. 00

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about a homeowner who gave two different mortgages to friends and investors, and the friends and investors recorded their mortgages. Then the bank records too. But the main issue is that the homeowner lost his job and couldn't pay the mortgages. This led to a foreclosure on the property, which sold for $160,000. 

Wait, the question is about who gets what. The options are about the friend's share. The options are A to J, each with different dollar amounts. I need to figure out which one is correct based on the recording statute provided.

So, the recording statute says: "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice." Hmm, so that means if someone later buys the property (like the friend, investor, or bank) and they've paid the market value, then their mortgage is void. But if they didn't pay the market value, then the instrument is void.

Wait, but the friend recorded his mortgage. The friend recorded his mortgage when he got the first loan. Then the homeowner gave a bank a mortgage and the bank recorded it. The friend and investor then recorded their first mortgages.

So, the key points are: the friend and investor recorded their mortgages before the homeowner gave a bank mortgage. But the initial mortgages (from the friend and investor) were recorded before the homeowner gave the bank any mortgage.

Wait no, let me read again. The friend recorded his mortgage, then the homeowner gave a bank a mortgage and the bank recorded. So the initial mortgages (friend and investor) were recorded, but the bank came later, and the friend and investor's mortgages were recorded before that.

Wait, no. The problem says: The friend then records his mortgage. The homeowner then gives a bank a mortgage and the bank records. The investor then records. So the friend recorded his first mortgage, then the investor did the same. Then, the bank gave a mortgage and the bank recorded it. So the friend and investor's mortgages were recorded before the bank's.

But wait, the problem says, "the friend, the investor, and the bank were parties." So perhaps the friend and investor recorded their initial mortgages, but the bank didn't record until later.

Wait, the problem says: "the friend then records his mortgage." So the friend records his first mortgage. Then the investor records his own. Then the bank records his own.

Wait, but the problem says that the friend, investor, and bank are parties. So the friend's and investor's mortgages were recorded first, and the bank's was given later and later recorded.

But the main point is, when the property sold for $160,000, which is less than the $100,000 the friend originally got. Oh wait, the friend got $100,000 with a $160,000 sale because the friend's mortgage was recorded and then the property was sold for more than the friend's mortgage. Wait, no—Wait, the friend's initial mortgage was $100,000, but the property sold for $160,000, so the friend's net was $60,000 (160-100). But wait, how does that work with the recording statute?

Wait, the recording statute says that if a subsequent buyer pays the market value, the instrument is void. So in the case of the friend, when the property was sold for $160,000, the friend's mortgage was $100,000. So the market value was higher than the mortgage, so the friend's mortgage wasn't void. But if the friend later buys the property for $160k, then the mortgage is still valid.

But wait, in this scenario, the friend recorded his mortgage, then the property was sold. The friend's mortgage was a written instrument. So the property's sale would be subject to the friend's mortgage unless the friend later bought it for more than the market value.

Wait, no. The problem is that the friend recorded his mortgage, and the property was sold for $160k. The friend's initial mortgage was $100k, which is less than the sale price. So the friend's mortgage is valid. But the problem is about who gets what in the foreclosure.

Wait, the main issue is that the friend, investor, and bank are parties to the foreclosure. The question is about the portion of the proceeds that belongs to the friend.

So, the friend recorded his mortgage, but the property sold for more than that. So the friend's net is $160k - $100k = $60k. But wait, the problem is about the actual distribution of the $160k proceeds.

Wait, but the recording statute says that if someone later buys the property (like the friend, investor, or bank) and pays the market value, their mortgage is void. But if they don't pay the market value, their instrument is void.

Wait, the friend recorded his mortgage, and the property sold for $160k, which is more than the friend's initial mortgage of $100k. So the market value is $160k, but the friend's mortgage is $100k. So the friend's net is $60k. But the friend's instrument (the mortgage) wasn't void because he didn't buy at the market value.

Wait, but the problem is about who gets what in the proceeds. When the property goes into foreclosure, the heirs are entitled to the proceeds. But the friend, investor, and bank are all parties. So the question is, how are the $160k distributed?

Wait, the initial mortgages were given by the homeowner to the friend and the investor, and then the bank received a mortgage. The friend and investor recorded their first mortgages, and the bank recorded his later mortgage.

So when the property is foreclosed and sold, the heirs of the friend, investor, and bank will get the proceeds. But the question is about the value allocated to each person.

Wait, the friend's share would be based on the original mortgage. His initial mortgage was $100k, and the property sold for $160k. So the friend's share would be $60k. But wait, the recording statute says that if a subsequent person (like the friend) later buys the property for more than the market value, the subsequent person's instrument is void. But when the friend's mortgage was recorded, the property's value was still the original value minus his mortgage. Wait, no, the initial value is $100k plus the mortgage. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the initial mortgage from the homeowner to the friend was $100k. So the property's value was $100k (home) + $100k (mortgage) = $200k? But the property sold for $160k, which is less than the property's original value. Wait, no—if the home is $100k and the mortgage is $100k, then the property's value was $200k. But the property sold for $160k, so the friend's net is $60k, but the mortgage is still on the property.

Wait, but the friend's mortgage was recorded, and the property's sale is $160k. So, the friend's net is $60k, but the mortgage is still valid. But in terms of the proceeds, when the property goes into foreclosure, the heirs are entitled to the proceeds. So, if the friend's mortgage was $100k, the bank's $50k, and the investor's $80k, but each of these is subject to the recording statute.

Wait, the problem is about the recording of the mortgages. So each mortgage is recorded unless the subsequent buyer pays the market value and the instrument is void. But since the friend, investor, and bank are all parties, and the friend recorded his mortgage, but the property's sale was $160k, which is less than the friend's initial $100k mortgage, so his net is $60k. But the recording statute says that if someone later buys the property (like the friend) and pays the market value, then their instrument is void.

Wait, no. The friend recorded his mortgage, which was $100k. The property's sale price was $160k. So the friend didn't buy at market value; he sold the property for more. So the friend's mortgage was $100k, so the sale's proceeds are $160k, but the friend's net is $60k. Because the friend's mortgage is still on the property.

So the friend's net is $60k. But the friend's instrument is still valid because he didn't buy at market value. So in this case, the friend's portion is $60k, the investor's is $80k, and the bank's is $50k. But the problem is about the portion of the proceeds that belong to the friend. 

Wait, but the problem states that the friend recorded his mortgage, but the property was sold for more than his initial mortgage. So the friend's share is $60k. But maybe the recording statute affects this.

Wait, no. The recording statute is about the validity of the instruments. So when the property was sold, the friend's instrument (mortgage) wasn't void. So the friend's net is $60k. But the question is, who gets that $60k?

Alternatively, perhaps the friend, investor, and bank are all heirs of the original mortgage, so they each have their own share. But the initial mortgage was $100k, so the friend's share would be $60k, the investor's $80k, the bank's $50k. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, but the options are about the amounts, not the shares. So perhaps the question is about the portion that still belongs to the friend. Since the friend's mortgage wasn't void, his share is $60k. But none of the options are $60k. Wait, looking back, the options are A to J, with options like $100k, $90k, etc. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the friend's instrument is subject to the recording statute. Because the friend recorded his mortgage, but the property's sale price is $160k, which is less than the initial mortgage amount, so the friend's instrument wasn't void. But the problem is that the friend's instrument is $100k, and the property's sale is $160k. So the friend's net is $60k, but the recording statute may affect the distribution.

Wait, maybe when the property is sold, the friend's instrument is still valid, so he gets his share. But then, perhaps the answer is that the friend should get his initial mortgage, $100k minus the property's sale price? No, I don't think that's how it works.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again: the friend recorded his mortgage. The property sold for $160k, which is less than the initial $100k, so the friend's net is $60k. However, the friend's instrument wasn't void, so he is entitled to the $60k. But the question is about how it's distributed among the three parties (friend, investor, bank). So, the friend's share is $60k, the investor's is $80k, the bank's is $50k. But the options don't have that. Looking at the options, option B is $90k, which is higher than $60k.

Wait, maybe the friend's share is based on the difference between the initial mortgage and the property's sale price. So, 100k - 160k would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the net is 160k - 100k = $60k. But none of the options match that. Oh, I see option B is $90k, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the friend's share is $100k minus the property's sale price, but that's not correct either.

Wait, perhaps the friend's mortgage is worth $160k. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the problem is that the friend recorded his mortgage, which is $100k, but the property was sold for more than that, so the friend's net is $60k. 

Wait, but the options don't include $60k. So perhaps the friend's share is $90k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the friend's share is $100k minus the amount the property was sold for, which is $160k - $100k = $60k. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again.

The problem says that the friend recorded his mortgage. The initial mortgage was $100k, so he recorded that. Then the property sold for $160k. So, the friend's net is $60k. But the friend's instrument is valid, so he should get his $60k. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is zero? Because the friend's instrument is valid.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is $0.00. So that would be if the friend's instrument is void. But that's not correct because the friend recorded his mortgage, and the property's sale price is higher than his initial mortgage, so the instrument isn't void. Hence, the friend should have his share.

But the options don't have $60k. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the recording statute again. The statute says that unless the subsequent buyer pays the value, the instrument is void. So, if the friend bought the property for $160k, which is more than the market value of the property at the time of recording, then the instrument would be void. But wait, the market value for the friend's mortgage was $100k. But when the friend recorded his mortgage, the property's value was still $200k (home plus mortgage), but the sale was at $160k.

Wait, no—no, the friend's initial mortgage was $100k. So the property's value was $100k (home) + $100k (mortgage) = $200k. The property sold for $160k, which is less than the original value. So the friend's net is $60k. But the friend's instrument (the mortgage) wasn't void because he didn't buy at market value. So he should get his $60k. But the options don't have that.

Wait, but the friend recorded his mortgage before the bank gave him a mortgage. So when the bank gave him a $50k mortgage, perhaps the friend's instrument is still subject to the recording statute. So when the bank recorded his mortgage, the friend's instrument wasn't void. Or perhaps the friend's instrument is subject to the recording statute because the friend recorded it before the bank gave a mortgage.

Wait, the problem says the friend recorded his mortgage. Then the bank received a mortgage and recorded it. So the friend's instrument is recorded before the bank's. So when the bank's mortgage was recorded, the friend's was still valid. So the friend's instrument remains on the property, and when the property is sold, the friend's net is $60k. But the question is about how that proceeds is distributed to the three parties.

Wait, but the friend's instrument is still valid. So the friend gets his $60k. But the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is that the friend gets $0? Or perhaps the friend's share is zero because the instrument is void.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. The problem is about the recording statute. The friend recorded his mortgage, which was $100k. The bank's mortgage was $50k. The property was sold for $160k. So, the friend's net is $60k, the investor's net is $80k, the bank's net is $50k. But the problem is about the portion that belongs to the friend. So, if the friend's instrument is still valid, he gets $60k. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is zero. Because the friend's instrument was recorded and then the property's sale was lower than his initial mortgage, but the friend's instrument wasn't void. Alternatively, maybe the friend is a subsequent buyer, so his instrument is void because he bought at the market value.

Wait, no. The friend's initial mortgage was $100k, and the property's sale was $160k, which is higher than the initial mortgage. So the friend didn't buy at the market value, so his instrument isn't void. So the friend's portion is $60k, but that's not among the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, the only one that makes sense is option D: $0.00. Because perhaps the friend's instrument was void because he bought it for more than the market value. But that doesn't align with the facts.

Alternatively, perhaps the friend's instrument is void because the property's value at the time of the friend's recording was $100k. Because the friend recorded his $100k mortgage, the property's value at that time was $100k (home) + $100k (mortgage) = $200k. But the friend didn't buy the property for $160k at that time because he didn't pay the market value. 

Wait, no, the friend recorded his mortgage, but the property's sale is $160k. The friend's net is $60k. The friend's instrument is valid because he didn't buy at the market value. So he should get $60k, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is zero, which would imply that the friend's instrument is void. But why would that be the case?

Wait, maybe the friend's instrument is void because when the property was first sold, someone else bought it at the market value. But the problem doesn't mention that. So perhaps the answer is zero. Because the friend's instrument wasn't void, so he gets his share.

But the options provided don't include $60k. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the friend's net is $60k, but the bank and investor's are due to the recording. Let me look at the problem again.

Wait, the problem says that the friend recorded his mortgage, and the bank received a mortgage and recorded it. So when the bank records, the friend's mortgage is still valid because the friend recorded his mortgage before the bank's. So the friend's net is $60k. So he gets $60k. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is zero. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the friend's instrument is void because the property's value at the time of the friend's recording was $200k, but the friend's net was $100k, so he bought at the market value, making his instrument void. That would mean he gets nothing, which is option D.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me think again. The friend recorded his $100k mortgage. When the property was first sold, the net was $100k (the buyer's share) and $100k (the property's sale). Wait, no, the property was $160k, but the friend's net was $100k minus the property's sale, which is $160k. Wait, no. The friend's net is the property's sale minus the friend's initial mortgage, which is $160k - $100k = $60k. So the friend bought at the market value, so his instrument is void. Hence, he gets nothing, which is option D.

Ah, that makes sense. So the friend bought the property for $160k, which is the market value, so his initial mortgage of $100k is valid, but the recording statute says that if a subsequent buyer (like him) buys at the market value, the instrument is void. So the friend's instrument is void, so he gets nothing. So the correct answer is D: $0.00.
</think>

The friend recorded his $100k mortgage, but the property was sold for $160k, which is the market value. This means the friend bought the property at the market value, and according to the recording statute, his mortgage instrument is void. As a result, the friend does not receive any of the proceeds from the foreclosure.

ANSWER: D
