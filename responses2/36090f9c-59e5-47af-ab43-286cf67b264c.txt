Question:

What is the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention?

Options:

A: Theories of Westphalian sovereignty argue that humanitarian intervention is an essential tool for maintaining global security, and hence should be supported by all states.
B: State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.
C: The Westphalian model of sovereignty promotes the idea of shared responsibility, arguing that states have a duty to intervene in a humanitarian crisis, regardless of the sovereignty of the affected state.
D: In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.
E: Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.
F: Westphalian sovereignty supports the idea of humanitarian intervention only when it is requested by the state in question.
G: The Westphalian concept of sovereignty emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and hence supports the idea of humanitarian intervention under the supervision of international bodies.
H: The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.
I: Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention are not related, as the former is a political concept and the latter is a social one.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Westphalia is a German state, known for its strict governance and theright to self-defense. The question is about whether their model of sovereignty connects with humanitarian intervention. Let me break down the options.

Option A: Westphalian sovereignty says that humanitarian intervention is essential for global security. So, they argue that any intervention is a must, not just in their own country. That seems to align with the idea that if you can't self-defense, you have to intervene.

Option B: It says that state sovereignty and non-interference can be disregarded if international consensus on human life within state is at risk and it's from the state's actions. So, it's about consensus, not necessarily the model itself. I'm not sure if this directly aligns with Westphalian's model.

Option C: Westphalian promotes shared responsibility, requiring states to intervene in humanitarian crises, regardless of the affected state's sovereignty. That sounds a bit different. Their model seems to require states to act, whereas C says the affected state has a duty, which I'm not sure is the same.

Option D: Westphalian defines sovereignty as subjective to political elites, favoring human welfare over sovereignty values. It doesn't mention humanitarian intervention. So this doesn't directly tie to intervention.

Option E: Westphalian's theories say non-intervention is paramount for security, extended to modern times. The UN's stance is that humanitarian intervention is bad, so this might be saying that Western models support intervention, but the UN doesn't. Not sure how that connects.

Option F: Says intervention only when the state requests it. But I think Western sovereignty includes more than just self-defense, so F might be too restrictive.

Option G: Westphalian emphasizes international cooperation and supports intervention. That fits, as they probably advocate for cooperation and when necessary, intervention.

Option H: UN norms are Western, so they support non-intervention. But the UN does condemn humanitarian intervention, so this might be a conflict.

Option I: They're unrelated. But I think they're not, so I don't think this is right.

Now, focusing on the core points. Westphalian sovereignty is about self-defense, and when states can't self-defense, they have to intervene. So, the idea that humanitarian intervention is essential is what A says. But then, Westphalian's model is more about requiring states to take action, not just rely on it.

Option D says sovereignty is about human welfare, not intervention. So it's not directly about humanitarian intervention. Option G says the model emphasizes international cooperation, which would support intervention. So G seems correct.
</think>

The Westphalian model of sovereignty emphasizes state sovereignty as a subjective issue concerning the actions of the political elite, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values. This model supports international cooperation and humanitarian intervention when necessary, as outlined in Option G.
