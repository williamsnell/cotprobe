Okay, so I have this problem here about the school principal and the teachers for the graduation ceremony. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The principal needs three different teachers to speak: one as the opener, one as the name-reader, and one as the closer. There are 85 teachers on staff. I need to find how many possible lineups the principal can have. The options are A to J, and I have to choose the right one.

Hmm, so the first thing that comes to mind is permutations because the order matters here. Each teacher is assigned a specific role, so the order in which they speak matters. For example, if Teacher A is the opener, Teacher B is the name-reader, and Teacher C is the closer, that's a different lineup than if they switch places.

The formula for permutations when selecting r items from a set of n is nPr = n! / (n - r)!. In this case, n is 85 (since there are 85 teachers) and r is 3 (since we need to choose 3 teachers). So plugging in the numbers, it would be 85P3 = 85! / (85-3)! = 85! / 82!.

Calculating that, I can simplify it. 85! divided by 82! is the same as 85 × 84 × 83 × 82! / 82! which cancels out the 82! terms, leaving 85 × 84 × 83. Let me compute that.

First, multiply 85 and 84. 85 times 80 is 6800, and 85 times 4 is 340. Adding those together gives 6800 + 340 = 7140. Now, multiply that by 83. So 7140 × 80 is 571,200, and 7140 × 3 is 21,420. Adding those together: 571,200 + 21,420 = 592,620.

Looking at the options, option C is 592,620, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be C.

The school principal needs to select three different teachers out of 85, considering the order of speaking (opener, name-reader, closer) as important. This is a permutation problem, calculated as 85P3 = 85 × 84 × 83 = 592,620. Option C matches this result.

Answer: C
