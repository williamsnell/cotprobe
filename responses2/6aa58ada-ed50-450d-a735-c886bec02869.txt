Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about beats in sound waves. Hmm, beats are when two sound waves interfere, right? I remember that beats occur when the two waves have slightly different frequencies, and this causes a periodic variation in the amplitude of the resultant wave. Oh wait, and the beat frequency is the difference between the two frequencies. But wait, I should think this through more carefully.

The question says the first source has a frequency of 500 Hz, and the second one is 504 Hz. So, the two frequencies are 500 and 504. Oh wait, so the beat frequency is just the difference between these two. So, I subtract the lower frequency from the higher one. Let me calculate that: 504 minus 500 is 4. So, the beat frequency should be 4 Hz. Wait, but does that mean the answer is B?

Wait, but wait, another thought. What's the actual formula for beat frequency? Oh right, the beat frequency is the absolute difference of the two frequencies. So, if two frequencies f1 and f2 are close, then f1 Â± f2 causes beats. So, when f1 and f2 are 500 and 504, their difference is 4 Hz. So yes, the beat frequency is 4 Hz.

Looking at the options, option F is 4 Hz. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. For example, sometimes I get confused between beat frequency and the actual frequencies. Oh wait, no. The beat frequency is the difference, not the actual frequencies. So, yeah, 504-500=4, so 4 Hz. So the correct answer is F.

The beat frequency is determined by the difference between the two sound wave frequencies. Given the frequencies of 500 Hz and 504 Hz, the beat frequency is calculated as the absolute difference: \( 504 \, \text{Hz} - 500 \, \text{Hz} = 4 \, \text{Hz} \). This corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
