Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the work done by a system when magnesium reacts with hydrochloric acid. Hmm, I need to calculate the work done. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

First, the reaction. When magnesium reacts with HCl, it should produce magnesium chloride, water, and hydrogen gas. The reaction equation is Mg + 2HCl → MgCl₂ + H₂↑. So, the system (the reaction) releases hydrogen gas into the atmosphere.

Work done by the system is related to the expansion or compression of the gas. Since the reaction produces hydrogen gas, which expands, the system does work on the surroundings. The work done by the system is positive when the system expands against atmospheric pressure.

Work (w) is calculated using the formula w = -P_ext * ΔV, but wait, I might be mixing this up with enthalpy. Alternatively, for expansion, if the gas is expanding, the work done by the system is positive. 

Wait, the formula for work when pressure is constant and the gas expands is w = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). But here, since the reaction produces gas, the volume increases, so the work done by the system would be positive, right?

But wait, in some cases, the work is considered as negative if the system is doing work. No, I think the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So if the system expands, ΔV is positive, so w would be negative. But wait, that depends on the sign conventions. If the system does work on the surroundings, the work is negative in the formula. Oh, I might have this mixed up.

Wait, another approach: For expansion, the system does work on the surroundings. So the work done by the system is positive. Or is it negative? Let me think. If I consider the system doing work, in physics, work done by the system is positive. But in some contexts, especially in chemistry, work done by the system is considered negative because it's energy leaving the system.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign conventions. Let me clarify. The first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So when the system does work, w is negative. Alternatively, some sources define the sign as w = -P_ext * ΔV, which would make it negative if the system expands because the volume increases.

Wait, let me get the signs right. For expansion, the system's volume increases. So, if the system expands, the external pressure (P_ext) is pushing against the system, doing work. So when the system does work on the surroundings, the work done by the system is positive. But in the formula, if the system is expanding, the volume change is positive, so the work would be positive. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, the formula used for work in expansion is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So if the volume increases (ΔV is positive), then w becomes negative. But that can't be right because expansion would mean the system is doing work, so w should be positive.

Hmm, maybe I should think of it this way. If the system expands, it's pushing against the atmosphere, so the surroundings are doing work on the system, but the system is doing work on the surroundings. Wait, no, the system is the reaction itself. The system (the reaction) is expanding, so it does work on the surroundings (the atmosphere). So from the system's perspective, it's doing work, so w is positive.

But wait, the formula for work is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So if ΔV is positive (expansion), then w would be negative. That would imply that the system is losing energy, which doesn't make sense because the reaction produces gas, which should do work.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the system doing work, so the work is positive, but the formula gives a negative value. So perhaps I should take the absolute value and assign the sign based on the process.

Alternatively, another approach: For expansion against a constant external pressure, the work done by the system is positive. So if the system expands, the work is positive. So the formula would be w = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). If V increases (final > initial), then (V_final - V_initial) is positive, so w would be negative. But that contradicts the idea of work done by the system being positive.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Another version of the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV, regardless of direction. So if the system expands (ΔV is positive), then w is negative. That would mean the system is losing energy, which can't be right because the reaction is releasing gas, which would push the system to do work.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me think of the reaction. The reaction produces gas, so the system's volume increases. So, the work done by the system is positive. But according to the formula, w = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial) = -P_ext * ΔV. So if ΔV is positive, w is negative. That suggests the system is doing work, but according to the formula, the work is negative.

Wait, maybe the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV, so if the volume increases, ΔV is positive, so w would be negative. But this would imply that work is done on the system, which can't be right because the system is expanding and doing work.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the system's perspective. The system is the reaction—so the gas is expanding. The system is doing work on the surroundings, so the work done by the system is positive. But according to the formula, if w = -P_ext * ΔV, and ΔV is positive, then w is negative. That would imply that the system is losing energy, which doesn't make sense because it's expanding.

Wait, another way: The formula for work done when the system expands is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So if the system expands, ΔV is positive, so w is negative. But that's confusing because the system is doing work, which should be positive.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think of another approach. For a gas expanding against a constant external pressure, the work done by the system is positive. The formula is w = P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). But wait, if the system expands, V_final is higher, so the work done by the system is positive. So w would be positive. But according to the formula I thought of earlier, it's w = -P_ext * ΔV. So if ΔV is positive, w is negative. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is w = P_ext * (V_initial - V_final). No, that would mean the work done by the system is negative. Because when the system expands, V_final > V_initial, so (V_initial - V_final) is negative, making the work negative. So that can't be right either.

Hmm, maybe I should approach it from the first law. The first law says ΔU = q + w. Here, when the system does work on the surroundings, q is negative (exothermic reaction) and w is negative as well. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, maybe I should just focus on the problem's parameters. The problem states that the system is the reaction, and the work is done by the system. The reaction is the system. The reaction produces hydrogen gas, which expands into the atmosphere. So, the system (reaction) is doing work on the surroundings (atmosphere). So the work done by the system is positive.

But how do I calculate this? I need to find the volume change of the system and then compute the work.

Wait, but wait. How do I find the volume change? Because the reaction produces a certain number of moles of gas. The reaction is Mg + 2HCl → MgCl₂ + H₂↑. So for 1 mole of Mg, 1 mole of H₂ is produced. So the moles of gas increase.

Wait, but the problem states that the reaction is done in a beaker of dilute HCl. So the initial moles of gas are zero (HCl is a gas, but wait, in dilute HCl, it might dissociate a little, but perhaps we can assume the initial moles of gas are negligible? Or maybe the initial moles are that of HCl, and the product is H2 gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a certain volume of H2, which contributes to the expansion.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the volume of the container. Hmm, that's a problem. Because to calculate the work, I need the volume change. Unless the container is a fixed volume, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the pressure is constant, and the volume changes. But without knowing the initial and final volumes, I can't compute the work. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, but perhaps the work is calculated based on the moles of gas produced. Because the reaction produces H2 gas, which is expanding. Let me think: the system (the reaction) is releasing H2 into the atmosphere. So the volume of the system increases. So the work done by the system is positive.

But wait, the calculation of work for an ideal gas expanding against a constant external pressure is given by w = -P_ext * Δn * R T. Where Δn is the change in moles of gas.

Wait, I think that's the correct formula. So for an ideal gas, the work done when expanding against a constant external pressure is w = -P_ext * Δn * R T. Because each mole of gas expands, contributing to the volume change.

Wait, so the reaction produces 1 mole of H2 (since the reaction produces 1 mole of H2 from 1 mole of Mg). So the change in moles of gas, Δn is (1 mole H2) - (0 moles, since HCl is H+ and Cl- which are gases, but I'm not sure)—Wait, perhaps the initial moles are zero? Because the reactants are solid (magnesium) and dilute HCl (which is a gas). So the initial moles of gas in the system are from HCl (but perhaps the HCl dissociates into H+ and Cl-). Wait, but in dilute HCl, it might not dissociate much, so the initial moles of gas are zero? Or perhaps the HCl is a gas, so the initial moles are negligible.

Wait, perhaps the system is the reaction, which produces H2 gas. The initial moles of gas in the system are zero (since HCl is a gas, but perhaps it's a dilute solution, so HCl is considered as a pure gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is that the HCl is a gas, and the reaction produces H2 gas. So the initial moles of gas are from HCl, which is perhaps 1 mole (but wait, no, because it's dilute, maybe not). Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the reaction occurs in a container where the volume is fixed. But that's not stated. I think that's the case.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "the work done by the system as a result of the reaction." So the system is the reaction itself. So the reaction produces hydrogen gas. So the system's volume increases. Assuming the system's volume is fixed (like a container with a fixed amount of gas), but that's not given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the expansion of the system's gas. So the work done by the system would be the pressure times the volume change. But without knowing the volume, how can I calculate it?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem might be assuming that the work is based on the number of moles of gas and the pressure. Because each mole of gas expands against the pressure, contributing to the work.

Wait, but the problem says "the atmospheric pressure is 1.0 atm." So the work done by the system is P multiplied by the volume change. But I don't know the volume change.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces H2 which occupies a certain volume, and that volume is the system's volume change. So for each mole of H2 produced, the system's volume increases by V_molar.

Wait, the problem is a bit unclear, but perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the work based on the moles of gas produced because that's the volume change.

So let's proceed with that.

The reaction produces 1 mole of H2. So Δn = 1 mole (because 1 mole gas is produced, and perhaps the initial moles of gas in the system are zero (since HCl is a gas, but maybe in the solution it's considered as H+ and Cl- which are gases, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles of gas in the system (before reaction) are negligible. So the initial moles of gas (n_initial) is 0, and the final is 1 mole. So Δn = 1 - 0 = 1.

So the work done is w = -P_ext * Δn * R T.

Wait, but wait. The formula for work done by expansion is w = -P_ext * ΔV. But for an ideal gas, ΔV = Δn * V_m. So ΔV = R T (Δn) / P, because PV = nRT. So V_m = R T / P.

So substituting into w: w = - P_ext * (R T Δn / P_ext ) ) → but P_ext cancels out.

Wait, wait, let me recast. Let's think in terms of R and T.

At constant temperature and pressure, the work done by the system is w = - P_ext * (V_initial - V_final) ) ?

Wait, but if the system expands, V_final > V_initial, so V_initial - V_final is negative. So w = - P_ext * (V_initial - V_final) = P_ext (V_final - V_initial).

But V_final is the volume after the reaction. Since the reaction produces gas, V_final is the initial volume plus the volume of H2 produced. But perhaps the problem assumes the volume is fixed, so the initial volume is zero, and the final volume is the volume of the H2 gas. But without knowing the volume, how can I compute it?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a key point. The problem gives the mass of magnesium as 15 grams. So perhaps I should calculate the moles of H2 produced, then find the volume of that gas at 25 degrees Celsius and 1.0 atm, then compute the work.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the moles of H2 can be found from the reaction, then the volume can be found using the ideal gas law.

So let's proceed step by step.

1. Calculate moles of Mg: 15 g / 24.3 g/mol ≈ 0.617 mol (exactly 15 / 24.3 ≈ 0.61728 mol).

2. The reaction is 1 Mg → 1 H2. So moles of H2 = 0.617 mol.

3. Use ideal gas law PV = nRT to find the volume of H2.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T is 25°C → 298 K.

So V = (nRT)/P = (0.617 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298 K) / 1.0 atm.

Calculate that:

0.617 * 0.0821 = approx 0.0505 L·atm/mol.

Multiply by 298 K: 0.0505 * 298 ≈ 15.049 L.

So the volume of H2 is approximately 15.05 L. So the system's volume increases by 15.05 L.

Now, work done by the system is w = -P_ext * ΔV.

Since P_ext is 1.0 atm and ΔV is 15.05 L, the work is:

w = -1.0 atm * 15.05 L = -15.05 L·atm.

But the options are in kJ. So how much is 15.05 L·atm in kJ?

We know that 1 L·atm ≈ 101.325 J. So 15.05 * 101.325 ≈ 1524 J = 1.524 kJ.

So the work done by the system is approximately -1.524 kJ.

Looking at the options, option A is -1.5 kJ, which is close to our calculation. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Did I get the sign right? Because the work done by the system is negative in the formula, but in the problem statement, it's asking for the work done by the system. So according to the formula, if the system expands, w is negative, which means work is done by the system.

But wait, I thought the formula w = -P_ext * ΔV would give work done by the system as negative. So in this case, the system is expanding, so it's doing work on the surroundings, so the work should be positive. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. The correct formula for work done by the system (expansion against constant pressure) is w = -P_ext * ΔV, where ΔV is the change in volume. But if the system's volume increases, ΔV is positive, so w is negative. That would imply the system is doing work on the surroundings, which is correct. Because when the system expands, it's losing energy by doing work.

Wait, so in this case, the system (the reaction) produces gas, so it's expanding. Therefore, the work done by the system is negative. Wait no, because work done by the system is negative according to the formula. So perhaps the work done by the system is -1.5 kJ, but the question is asking for the work done by the system, so it would be negative.

Wait, but all the options have negative signs except option D but not. Let me read the options again.

Options:

A: -1.5 kJ

B: 0.0 (positive)

C: -3.0

D: -2.5

E: -1.0

... etc.

Wait, according to our calculation, the work done by the system is about -1.5 kJ. So option A.

Wait, but I thought the formula would give a positive value. Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me re-examine the formula.

The formula is:

For expansion against a constant external pressure, the work done is w = -P_ext * ΔV.

Where ΔV is the change in volume.

If the system expands (ΔV is positive), then w is negative.

So the system is doing work on the surroundings, which is why the work is negative.

So in our calculation, the work done by the system is -1.524 kJ. So the correct option is A.

But wait, another perspective: the system is what's being calculated. The work done by the system is the energy released in the reaction. So the energy is positive, but since the system is expanding, the work done by the system is negative.

Wait, no, this is getting confusing. Let me think of another way. The first law states that ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So if the system is expanding, the work is done on the system by the surroundings, so w is negative. So the work done by the system is positive, but according to the formula, it's negative.

Wait, no. Let me correct. The formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So when the system expands, ΔV is positive, so w is negative. That means the system is doing work on the surroundings, which would mean that the work done by the system is negative.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So if the system expands, the work done by the system is negative. So the system is losing energy because it's doing work on the surroundings.

So in our problem, the system is the reaction, which produces H2 gas. The system expands, so it's doing work on the surroundings. So the work done by the system is negative.

So our calculation was correct. So the work done by the system is approximately -1.5 kJ.

Looking at the options, option A is -1.5 kJ, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but why isn't the work positive? Because the formula says w is negative. So the answer should be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the absolute value. Let me think. If the system's volume increases, the work done by the system is negative. So the system is losing energy by doing work. So the work done by the system is negative.

So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

To calculate the work done by the system (the reaction), we analyze the scenario as follows:

1. **Reaction and Gas Production**:  
   The reaction is:  
   \[
   \text{Mg} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{MgCl}_2 + \text{H}_2 \uparrow
   \]  
   For 15 g of Mg, the moles of Mg are:  
   \[
   \frac{15}{24.3} \approx 0.617 \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   Since the reaction produces 1 mole of H₂, the moles of H₂ produced are:  
   \[
   0.617 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Ideal Gas Law for Volume of H₂**:  
   Using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \), where \( P = 1.0 \, \text{atm} \), \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \), and \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K} \):  
   \[
   V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{0.617 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 298}{1.0} \approx 15.05 \, \text{L}
   \]  
   Thus, the volume of the system increases by approximately 15.05 L.

3. **Work Done by the System**:  
   The work done by the system is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
   \]  
   Here, \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1.0 \, \text{atm} \) and \( \Delta V = 15.05 \, \text{L} \). Substituting the values:  
   \[
   w = -1.0 \cdot 15.05 = -15.05 \, \text{L·atm}
   \]  
   Convert to kilojoules:  
   \[
   1 \, \text{L·atm} = 101.325 \, \text{J} = 0.101325 \, \text{kJ}
   \]  
   \[
   w = -15.05 \cdot 0.101325 \approx -1.524 \, \text{kJ}
   \]  

4. **Sign of the Work**:  
   The negative sign indicates that the system is doing work on the surroundings. Therefore, the work done by the system is negative.

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Among the given options, the closest match is:  
   \[
   \text{A: } -1.5 \, \text{kJ}
   \]  

Thus, the correct answer is **A: -1.5 kJ**.  

ANSWER: A
