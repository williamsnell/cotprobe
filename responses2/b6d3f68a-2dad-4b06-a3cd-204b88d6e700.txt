Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the resistance of a wire changing with temperature. I remember that resistance depends on temperature, right? The formula probably involves the temperature coefficient of resistance.

The problem says that a silver wire has a resistance of 1.25 ohms at 0°C. And the temperature coefficient is 0.00375 per degree Celsius. I think the formula is R = R0 [1 + α(t - t0)], where R is the resistance at temperature t, R0 is the resistance at t0, and α is the temperature coefficient. Oh wait, I should make sure about the units. Oh, the coefficient is given per degree Celsius, so that's right.

The question is asking when the resistance doubles. Oh, right, so we need R = 2 * R0. Let me plug in the numbers.

R0 is 1.25 ohms, so when R doubles, it's 2.5 ohms. So 2.5 = 1.25 [1 + 0.00375 (t - 0)]. Let me write that equation down more clearly.

1.25 [1 + 0.00375 (t)] = 2.5.

Divide both sides by 1.25 to simplify. That gives [1 + 0.00375 t] = 2.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 0.00375 t = 1.

Wait, so t equals 1 divided by 0.00375. Let me calculate that. 1 / 0.00375. Hmm, 0.00375 is 3.75e-3. So 1 / 0.00375 is approximately 266.666... So about 266.6667°C.

Looking at the options, option H is 266°C, which is the closest. So the answer should be H.

To determine the temperature at which the resistance of the silver wire doubles, we use the formula for temperature dependence of resistance:

\[
R = R_0 [1 + \alpha (t - t_0)]
\]

Here:
- \( R_0 = 1.25 \, \Omega \) (resistance at \( t_0 = 0^\circ C \)),
- \( \alpha = 0.00375 \, /^\circ C \) (temperature coefficient of resistance),
- \( R = 2 \times R_0 = 2.5 \, \Omega \) (doubled resistance).

Substituting the values into the equation:

\[
2.5 = 1.25 [1 + 0.00375 (t)]
\]

Divide both sides by 1.25:

\[
2 = 1 + 0.00375 t
\]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[
1 = 0.00375 t
\]

Solve for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{1}{0.00375} \approx 266.6667^\circ C
\]

The closest option is **H: 266°C**. 

Answer: H
