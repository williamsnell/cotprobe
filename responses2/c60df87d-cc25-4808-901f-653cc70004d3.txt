Question:

A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of abdominal pain. She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?

Options:

A: Both CFTR alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms
B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR
C: The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier
D: The patient's symptoms are coincidental and not related to the CFTR mutation
E: The G551D mutation in CFTR does not cause symptoms
F: The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype
G: The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained
H: The patient's clinical phenotype is due to a mutation in a different gene
I: The patient has a rare form of CFTR mutation that requires two alleles
J: The CFTR mutation is associated with her clinical phenotype but not the cause

Okay, so I've got this medical question here about a patient with a CFTR mutation. Hmm. Let me think through this.

The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (sinusitis) and pancreatitis. Oh, and she has thick nasal secretions. Oh, right, thick nasal secretions can indicate something like cystic fibrosis, perhaps. She says her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Oh, that's interesting. Saltiness and crystallization often come up with cystic fibrosis.

Her vital signs are normal, so no heart or kidney issues. The physical exam shows epigastric (gas) tenderness. Epigastric pain is a classic feature in CF, often because the lungs are sensitive to CF. So, that's a clue.

Genetic testing shows a detectable mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene. Wait, CFTR is the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. The main mutation is G551D. But what does a single mutation mean?

I remember that cystic fibrosis is usually a dominant disorder. So, if a person has one CFTR mutation (G551D), they can have the disease. But wait, the options here are about whether it's a dominant or recessive trait. If it's dominant, then a single mutation would be enough. But sometimes carriers can have dominant issues.

The options are A through J. Let's look at them.

Option A: Both CFTR alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms. But CF is a dominant disorder. So even if one is mutated, the person can have the disease. So A is false.

Option B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR. That makes sense because cystic fibrosis is dominant. So a single mutation is enough for the disease. So B sounds correct.

Option C: The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier. That's more like a recessive disease. Since cystic fibrosis is dominant, a carrier would only need one mutation. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: The symptoms are coincidental. But the patient does have a CF mutation, so the symptoms are related. So D is wrong.

Option E: The mutation doesn't cause symptoms. But the patient has thick nasal secretions, which is a symptom of CF. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The mutation is unrelated. That's the opposite of what the patient has. She has a mutation, so F is wrong.

Option G: Another gene mutation. The question only mentions CFTR, so G is not relevant.

Option H: Mutation in a different gene. No, the question says the mutation is in CFTR. So H is wrong.

Option I: Second mutation not detected. No, the testing found one in the 36 most common. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The mutation is associated with the phenotype but not the cause. But the mutation is the cause. So J is incorrect.

So the best option is B: Only one G551D allele is needed.
</think>

The patient has a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, pancreatitis, and thick nasal secretions. Her symptoms are indicative of cystic fibrosis, as thick nasal secretions are a hallmark of CF. The patient also reports salty sweat and crystallization on her skin, which are consistent with CF. The genetic testing revealed a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene, which is the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis.

Cystic fibrosis is a dominant disorder, meaning that a single mutation in the CFTR gene can lead to the disease. Therefore, only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR to produce symptoms. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A**: Both mutations are not required for symptoms.
- **C**: CF is a dominant disorder, and a single mutation is sufficient.
- **D**: The symptoms are related to the CF mutation.
- **E**: The mutation does cause symptoms.
- **F**: The mutation is related to the patient's phenotype.
- **G**: The mutation is in CFTR, not another gene.
- **H**: The mutation is in CFTR, not a different gene.
- **I**: A second mutation was not detected.
- **J**: The mutation is the cause of the phenotype, not just related.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.
