Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it again. A cart of mass 5 kg is moving at 1 m/s on a frictionless table. Then a brick of the same mass, 5 kg, is dropped onto the cart. The question is about the change in velocity of the cart. The options are A through J, each with different values.

Hmm, right, since the table is frictionless, the brick will exert a force on the cart, causing it to change velocity. But wait, both the cart and the brick are on the same table, and friction is zero. So the brick's momentum must be transferred to the cart.

Wait, but the brick itself is moving when it's dropped. Oh wait, no, the brick is being dropped, so when the brick is on the cart, it's moving horizontally. But wait, when you drop the brick, it's initially moving horizontally with the cart, right? Because when you drop something, it's just like when you drop a ball; it's moving with the same velocity as the cart. So the brick has a certain momentum.

Let me think about momentum conservation. Since the table is frictionless, there's no external horizontal force acting on the system (cart plus brick), so the total momentum should be conserved. Wait, but wait, the table is frictionless, so the only force is between the cart and the brick. So their momenta should add up to the initial total.

Wait, the system is the cart and the brick. The initial momentum is the cart's momentum plus the brick's. The brick is moving with the cart's velocity, so the brick's initial velocity is 1 m/s. So the brick's mass is 5 kg. So initial total momentum is (5 kg)(1 m/s) + (5 kg)(1 m/s) = 10 kg路m/s.

After the brick is dropped, the brick is stuck to the cart. So now the combined mass is 5 + 5 = 10 kg. The cart and brick will move together. Let me call their combined velocity v. The total momentum after must be 10 kg * v.

So 10 kg * v = 10 kg路m/s. So v = 1 m/s. But wait, that's the velocity after. But the question is about the change in velocity. Oh wait, the cart was initially moving at 1 m/s. Now it's moving at 1 m/s as well. So the change is zero. So the cart's velocity doesn't change.

Wait, but wait. No, that's not right. Because the brick was moving at 1 m/s, but when it's on the cart, it's moving with it. So the brick's initial velocity is 1 m/s, same as the cart. So system total momentum is 5*1 + 5*1 = 10 kg m/s. After, both move at 1 m/s, so 10 *1 =10. So momentum is conserved. So the velocity of the cart remains 1 m/s. So the change in velocity is zero. So the cart doesn't speed up or slow down. So the velocity doesn't change.

Wait, but the brick was moving with the cart, so when it's attached, the combined system's velocity is same as before. So the cart's velocity remains 1 m/s. So the change is zero.

Looking back at the options, option C is "No change in velocity." So the correct answer should be C.

The problem involves a cart of mass 5 kg moving at 1 m/s on a frictionless table with another brick of mass 5 kg being dropped onto it. Since the table is frictionless, there are no external horizontal forces acting on the system (cart + brick), so momentum is conserved.

The initial total momentum of the system is the sum of the cart's momentum and the brick's momentum:

\[
p_{\text{initial}} = (5 \, \text{kg})(1 \, \text{m/s}) + (5 \, \text{kg})(1 \, \text{m/s}) = 10 \, \text{kg路m/s}.
\]

After the brick is dropped onto the cart, the combined mass of the system is \(5 \, \text{kg} + 5 \, \text{kg} = 10 \, \text{kg}\). Let \(v\) be the new velocity of the combined system. The total momentum after the collision is:

\[
p_{\text{final}} = (10 \, \text{kg})(v).
\]

Since momentum is conserved, \(p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}}\), so:

\[
10 \, \text{kg路m/s} = 10 \, \text{kg} \cdot v \implies v = 1 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The cart's velocity remains the same as before the collision, meaning there is no change in velocity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: No change in velocity.**
