Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: ∫ from -∞ to ∞ of sin(3t) * sin(t/π) / t² dt. Hmm, I remember integrals involving products of sines can sometimes be simplified using trigonometric identities. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I recall that there's a product-to-sum identity for sine functions. The formula is something like sin A sin B equals [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2. So maybe I can rewrite the product sin(3t) sin(t/π) using that identity.

Let's apply the identity. Here, A is 3t and B is t/π. So sin(3t) sin(t/π) becomes [cos(3t - t/π) - cos(3t + t/π)] / 2. That simplifies to [cos((3π - 1)/π t) - cos((3π + 1)/π t)] / 2.

Wait, let me double-check the coefficients. Oh, right, 3t minus t/π is (3π t - t)/π = t(3π -1)/π. Similarly, 3t plus t/π is t(3π +1)/π. So the expression becomes [cos(t(3π -1)/π) - cos(t(3π +1)/π)] / 2.

So now the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ [cos((3π -1)/π t) - cos((3π +1)/π t)] / t² dt from -infty to infty.

Wait, but wait a second. The integral is over all t, but t² is in the denominator. So integrating 1/t² from -infty to infty might cause an issue because 1/t² is not absolutely integrable. However, when dealing with Fourier transforms or certain standard integrals, I think there's a standard result that might help here.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should consider the integral of cos(kt)/t². Hmm, but I'm integrating from -infty to infty, and t² is in the denominator. Wait, but 1/t² is an even function, so integrating from -infty to infty would be twice the integral from 0 to infty. But wait, the integral of cos(kt)/t² from 0 to infty — does that converge?

Wait, for t approaching 0, cos(kt) behaves like 1, so the integrand behaves like 1/t². The integral of 1/t² from 0 to a is -1/t evaluated from 0 to a, which would diverge to negative infinity. So integrating cos(kt)/t² from 0 to infty might not converge, but perhaps the integral as a whole does. Or maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach using Fourier transforms. Because the integral we're dealing with might relate to the Fourier transform of 1/t².

Wait, I remember that the Fourier transform of 1/t² is related to the square of the sinc function or something like that. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Wait, perhaps I should think about the Fourier transform of 1/t². Alternatively, maybe the integral can be expressed using the Dirichlet integral or other standard integrals.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the integral formula for the product of sines over t squared. I remember that ∫_{-infty}^{infty} [sin(a t) sin(b t)] / t² dt equals (π/2)(a + b) if a and b are positive. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I can use the integral formula ∫_{-∞}^∞ [sin(at) sin(bt)] / t² dt. I think the formula is (π/2)(a + b) when a and b are positive. So in this case, a would be 3, and b would be 1/π. Let me plug those in.

So (π/2)(3 + 1/π) = (π/2)( (3π +1)/π ) ) = (3π +1) * π / (2π) ) = (3π +1)/(2) )? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the options don't have that. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express the formula. Suppose I have the integral of [sin(at) sin(bt)] / t² dt from -infty to infty. If I set a and b as positive, then I think the integral is (π/2)(a + b) when a and b are positive. So in our case, a is 3 and b is 1/π because the arguments are 3t and (1/π)t.

So substituting, (π/2)(3 + 1/π) = (π/2)( (3π +1)/π ) ) = (3π +1)/(2). But wait, that's (3π + 1)/2. Looking at the options, none of them match this. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the integral of sin(kt) / t², but I'm not sure about that. Wait, perhaps I should use integration by parts. Let me try that approach.

Let me consider I = ∫_{-infty}^{infty} [sin(3t) sin(t/π)] / t² dt. Let me use integration by parts, setting u = sin(3t) sin(t/π) and dv = dt/t². Then du would be the derivative of the product, and v would be -1/t.

Wait, let's compute du. The derivative of sin(3t) sin(t/π) is 3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + sin(3t)(1/π) cos(t/π). And v is -1/t.

So integration by parts gives us I = [ - sin(3t) sin(t/π) / t ] from -infty to infty + ∫_{-infty}^{infty} [3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π)] / t dt.

Now, evaluating the first term at the limits: as t approaches ±infty, sin(3t) and sin(t/π) oscillate between -1 and 1. So when divided by t, which is going to infinity, the term tends to zero. So the first term is zero.

So I = ∫ [3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π)] / t dt.

Hmm, but that seems more complicated. Wait, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Let me consider whether the integrand is even or odd.

Looking at the integrand: [3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π)] / t. Let me check for t replaced with -t:

Each term would have cos(3t) and sin(t/π). Since cos is even, and sin is odd. So:

cos(3*(-t)) = cos(3t)
sin( (-t)/π ) = - sin(t/π)

So the first term becomes 3 cos(3t) ( - sin(t/π) ) = -3 cos(3t) sin(t/π)
The second term becomes (1/π) sin(3*(-t)) cos( (-t)/π ) = (1/π) (-sin(3t)) cos(t/π).

So the entire numerator becomes:

-3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (-1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π) ) = - [3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π) ].

So the integrand becomes [ - (3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π) ) ] / t.

Wait, but the original integral is I = ∫ [3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π)] / t dt.

So after integration by parts, I becomes:

I = [0] + [ - ∫ (3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π)) / t dt ]

Which is I = - I. So this implies that I + I = 0 → 2I = 0 → I = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So according to this, the integral I is zero. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait again, let's double-check. The integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv| - ∫ v du.

We set u = sin(3t) sin(t/π), dv = dt/t².

Then du = [3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + sin(3t) (1/π) cos(t/π) ] dt.

v = ∫ dv = ∫ dt/t² = -1/t.

So ∫ u dv = u v | - ∫ v du.

So the first term is u v evaluated at ±infty, which as t approaches infinity, sin terms oscillate, but multiplied by 1/t, so the limit is zero.

So the first term is zero.

The integral becomes ∫ [3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π) ] dt / t.

But when we substitute t → -t, the integrand changes sign. So the integral from -infty to infty is equal to the negative of itself, implying it must be zero.

Hmm, that seems to suggest the integral is zero. But wait, the options don't have zero as an option except option E. But wait, wait. Let me review this because I might have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, the substitution is correct. Because if t → -t, the denominator is t, which flips sign, and the numerator becomes negative.

So the integral becomes I = [0] - ∫ [ same integrand ] / t dt.

Which is I = -I → 2I = 0 → I = 0.

So the value of the integral is zero. But let me double-check this approach because sometimes integration by parts can be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the original integral as the imaginary part of some complex integral, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, but according to the integration by parts approach, the integral is zero. So the correct answer would be option E: 0.0.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if I made a mistake in the integration by parts. Let me rederive it.

So u = sin(3t) sin(t/π).
dv = dt/t².

du = [3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + sin(3t) (1/π) cos(t/π) ] dt.

v = -1/t.

So I = u v | from -infty to infty - ∫ v du.

As t approaches ±infty, sin(3t) and sin(t/π) oscillate but are multiplied by 1/t, which goes to zero. So uv at the limits is zero.

So I = - ∫ v du = ∫ [1/t] [3 cos(3t) sin(t/π) + (1/π) sin(3t) cos(t/π) ] dt.

Wait, but wait, the substitution I made earlier was correct. 

But earlier, I thought that the integral becomes I = -I, so I must be zero. So the integral is zero.

But wait, wait a moment. Let me think about the original integral again. It's an integral of sin(3t) sin(t/π) divided by t². Since both sin functions are odd functions, their product is even. Because sin(3t) is odd, sin(t/π) is odd, their product is odd * odd = even. So the numerator is even, denominator is t², which is even. So overall, the integrand is even. So the integral over symmetric limits would be twice the integral from 0 to infty, which would be 2 times (0) which is zero.

Wait, so maybe that's another way to see it. So the integral from -infty to infty is twice the integral from 0 to infty. But if the integral from 0 to infty is zero, then the overall integral is zero. So that makes sense.

So the correct answer is E: 0.0.

The integral to evaluate is:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\sin(3t) \sin(t/\pi)}{t^2} dt.
$$

### Approach and Analysis

1. **Product-to-Sum Identity**:  
   Use the trigonometric identity for the product of sines:  
   $$
   \sin(A)\sin(B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)].
   $$  
   Let $A = 3t$ and $B = t/\pi$. Then:  
   $$
   \sin(3t)\sin(t/\pi) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos\left(\frac{3\pi t - t}{\pi}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{3\pi t + t}{\pi}\right) \right].
   $$  
   Simplifying the arguments:  
   $$
   \cos\left(\frac{(3\pi - 1)t}{\pi}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{(3\pi + 1)t}{\pi}\right).
   $$  
   Thus, the integral becomes:  
   $$
   \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos\left(\frac{(3\pi - 1)t}{\pi}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{(3\pi + 1)t}{\pi}\right)}{t^2} dt.
   $$

2. **Symmetry Consideration**:  
   The integrand is even because both $\cos\left(\frac{(3\pi - 1)t}{\pi}\right)$ and $\cos\left(\frac{(3\pi + 1)t}{\pi}\right)$ are even functions, and $t^2$ is also even. Therefore, the integral over $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ is twice the integral from $0$ to $+\infty$. However, if the integral from $0$ to $+\infty$ is zero, the entire integral is zero.

3. **Integration by Parts**:  
   Using integration by parts, let $u = \sin(3t)\sin(t/\pi)$ and $dv = dt/t^2$. Then $du$ and $v$ can be computed. However, this approach leads to the conclusion that the integral is zero because the resulting integral is its own negative, implying $I = -I$ and thus $I = 0$.

4. **Final Evaluation**:  
   Since the integrand is even and the integral over $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ is twice the integral from $0$ to $+\infty$, but the latter is zero, the overall integral is zero.

### Conclusion

The value of the integral is **0.0**.
