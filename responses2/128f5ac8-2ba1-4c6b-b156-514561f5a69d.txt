Question:

An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?

Options:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count
B: Decreased basophil count
C: Decreased macrophage activity
D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration
E: Increased macrophage activity
F: Decreased neutrophil count
G: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration
H: Increased eosinophil count
I: Increased lymphocyte count
J: Increased basophil count

Okay, so I've got this question here about medical students and their colds during finals week. Let's see if I can figure this out. The question is about the hypothesis that stress from exams makes them more susceptible to the cold, which the investigator is seeing with increased upper respiratory tract infections. The options are various lab findings, and I need to pick the one that supports this hypothesis.

Hmm, the hypothesis is about stress and immune system issues. Stress usually affects the immune system, right? Like how stress can cause you to be more susceptible to infections. So, if they're stressed, their immune response would be higher, making them more likely to catch colds.

Let me think about the options. The options are A to J. Let's go through each.

Option A: Decreased lymphocyte count. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. If they decrease, that would mean the immune system is weaker. But the hypothesis is that stress makes them more susceptible, so a decreased immune system would support that. But I'm not sure if this is the best choice yet.

Option B: Decreased basophil count. Basophils are a type of white blood cell that produces white blood cells. If their count goes down, the immune response might be weaker. So that also supports the idea of a weakened immune system.

Option C: Decreased macrophage activity. Macrophages are another type of white blood cell. Their activity is high when the body is fighting infections. If it's decreased, that would mean the body isn't firing as many immune responses. So that's supporting the idea of a weaker immune system.

Option D: Increased cortisol. AM serum cortisol is a blood test for cortisol levels. Stress leads to cortisol production. So if cortisol is high, that suggests they're stressed, which supports the hypothesis.

Option E: Increased macrophage activity. If macrophages are active, that's bad because they help destroy pathogens. If they're increased, that would mean the body is more robust against infections, which doesn't support the hypothesis.

Option F: Decreased neutrophil count. Neutrophils are part of the immune system too. Lower neutrophils mean the body isn't fighting infections as well. So that supports a weaker immune system.

Option G: Decreased cortisol. If cortisol is low, that suggests they're not stressed. But the hypothesis says they're stressed during finals, so this would be against the hypothesis.

Option H: Increased eosinophil count. Eosinophils are another type of white blood cell involved in inflammation. If they're up, that's a sign of more inflammation. But how does that tie into stress and infection? Maybe stress leads to more inflammation, but I'm not sure if this directly shows a decreased immune system.

Option I: Increased lymphocyte count. If lymphocytes are up, the immune system is strong. That would contradict the hypothesis, so this is probably not the right answer.

Option J: Increased basophil count. Basophils are involved in producing white blood cells. If they're up, that's a strong immune response. So, this would support a stronger immune system, which is against the hypothesis.

Now, the hypothesis is that stress (from exams) makes them more susceptible, implying a weakened immune system. So, we're looking for a lab finding that shows a weaker immune response.

Looking at the options: which ones show weaker immune response?

Decreased basophil count (B) would mean less white blood cells, weaker immune response. Decreased macrophage (C) would be bad, so not supporting. Decreased lymphocyte (A) would be even worse. Decreased neutrophile (F) makes the body less immune.

Of the options, D (cortisol) and B (basophils) are about inflammation or immune response. But the hypothesis is about stress and immune system.

Stress causes cortisol, which is high. So D would be a good candidate. Also, high cortisol would mean they're stressed, which is the cause of the cold.

So the correct answer should be either D or B. But which one?

The question is about the hypothesis. The stress leads to more susceptibility, so the cause is stress. So any lab finding that reflects a weakened immune response would support this.

Option D: increased cortisol (which is a sign of stress) supports the hypothesis. Option B: decreased basophils (which would imply less white blood cells, weaker immune response) supports the hypothesis.

Wait, but the question is about the last character of the correct option, so the correct answer is either D or B.

Hmm, the question states that the hypothesis is that stress makes them susceptible. So the lab finding should reflect an increased susceptibility, which is stress-related.

Of the choices, cortisol (D) is directly due to stress. So D is a good candidate.

So looking back, which of the options is increased cortisol? Yes, D.

So the correct answer is D: Increased cortisol concentration.
</think>

The investigator hypothesizes that stress from exam preparation increases susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections, suggesting a weakened immune system. To support this hypothesis, a lab finding reflecting a reduced immune response would be appropriate.

- **Option A: Decreased lymphocyte count:** Low lymphocyte count indicates a weakened immune system, which supports the hypothesis. However, it does not directly address stress.
- **Option B: Decreased basophil count:** A reduced basophil count indicates a weaker immune response, supporting the hypothesis. Basophils produce white blood cells, so their decrease weakens the immune system.
- **Option C: Decreased macrophage activity:** High macrophage activity is associated with infection resistance, contradicting the hypothesis.
- **Option D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration:** High cortisol levels are a direct result of stress, aligning with the hypothesis. Stress increases susceptibility, making this a strong candidate.
- **Option E: Increased macrophage activity:** This contradicts the hypothesis of a weakened immune system.
- **Option F: Decreased neutrophil count:** Low neutrophils indicate a weaker immune response, supporting the hypothesis.
- **Option G: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration:** Low cortisol suggests no stress, which contradicts the hypothesis.
- **Option H: Increased eosinophil count:** Increased inflammation could be a result of stress but does not directly support a weakened immune system.
- **Option I: Increased lymphocyte count:** Strong immune response contradicts the hypothesis.
- **Option J: Increased basophil count:** Increased basophils suggest a stronger immune response, contradicting the hypothesis.

The most direct evidence supporting the hypothesis is **Option D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration**, as stress leads to higher cortisol levels, which in turn increases susceptibility to infections.

**ANSWER: D**
