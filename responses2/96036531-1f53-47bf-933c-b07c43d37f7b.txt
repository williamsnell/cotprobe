Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about pharaohs and the population they ruled. The question gives me a list of options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me read it carefully.

The question states: "The pharaoh ruled a population of ________, of which _________ were farmers." The options are labeled from A to J, each with two numbers. I need to figure out which option correctly represents the population and the percentage of farmers.

Hmm, I remember that the Ancient Egyptian pharaohs ruled over a large area. I think the pharaohs were called "Nekus" and they ruled over Egypt. But wait, what was the exact population size? I'm not entirely sure, but I've heard figures like 3 million or 5 million. Oh wait, no, maybe that's the size of the kingdom, not the pharaohs themselves. Because the pharaohs were the rulers, not the entire kingdom. So the population of the pharaohs themselves might be a different number.

Wait, the pharaohs were called Nekus, and they ruled over Egypt. The population of Nekus, as a pharaoh, would be a specific number. I think I've read that the Nekus population was around 2 million people. But let me think again. Oh, perhaps the question is referring to the total population of Egypt, but no, that's not right because pharaohs were a subset of the population.

Alternatively, maybe the pharaohs ruled a kingdom that was about 5 million people. But pharaohs aren't the entire population, they were just the leaders. So the pharaoh's population would be a subset of the kingdom's population.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the pharaoh's actual population. The pharaohs were called Nekus, and they ruled over Egypt, which had a population of around 10 million. But that's the size of the kingdom, not the pharaohs themselves. So the pharaohs as rulers were a specific number, perhaps 1 million? Or more?

Wait, I think I remember a specific figure. The pharaoh of Nekus was about 2 million. So the pharaoh's population (the size of the Nekus people) was around 2 million. Then, how many were farmers? I think like 70%. Wait, let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A: 5,000,000; 100%
B: 3,000,000; 75%
C: 4,000,000; 80%
D: 2,500,000; 90%
E: 1,500,000; 70%
F: 100,000; 25%
G: 500,000; 50%
H: 750,000; 30%
I: 1,000,000; 50%
J: 2,000,000; 60%

Wait, the pharaoh's population was 2 million, but the options only have 2 million in option D. So D says 2.5 million. Hmm, that's a bit off. Maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the pharaoh's population was around 3 million. Let me see. Option B is 3 million with 75% farmers. That's a common figure I've heard. So if the pharaoh's population was 3 million, and 75% were farmers, then option B would fit.

Wait, but then another thought: the pharaohs were 2 million (as I thought earlier), but perhaps the population referred to here is that of the Nekus, which was 3 million. Let me check which option has 3 million. Option B is 3 million, 75% farmers. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, perhaps the pharaoh's population is 5 million, but that's option A. But 75% of 5 million is 3.75 million, which isn't an option. So that's probably not it.

Another angle: the pharaohs were 2 million people, but how many were farmers? I think around 70%. So that would be option E: 1.5 million? No, that's way too small. Wait, no, option E is 1.5 million and 70%. So if pharaohs were 2 million, and 70% were farmers, that's 1.4 million farmers. But none of the options have 1.4 million. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the pharaoh's population was 3 million. So 75% would be 2.25 million farmers. But that's not an option either. So maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, maybe the pharaoh's population was 10 million. No, that's way too high, and the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the pharaoh's population was 1 million, and 50% were farmers, but that's option I. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. I remember that the pharaohs ruled over Egypt, which then became the capital of the world. The population of Egypt at that time was about 10 million, but the pharaohs weren't the entire population. However, I think the pharaohs were approximately 2 million. So if the pharaoh's population were 2 million, then 70% (1.4 million) were farmers. But the options don't have 1.4 million as a population. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the pharaoh's population was 2.5 million. Option D says 2.5 million, and 90% farmers. That's a high number, but possible. But I'm not sure if that's the correct figure.

Alternatively, maybe the pharaoh's population was 3 million. Option B: 3 million, 75% farmers. That seems plausible. But then, the pharaohs would be 3 million, and 75% of them were farmers. That would mean 2.25 million farmers. Wait, but in the options, 3 million is the population, and 75% is the farmer percentage.

Wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the pharaoh's population was 5 million. But that's way off the options. So I think the correct option is B: 3 million population, 75% farmers.

The pharaoh of Nekus ruled over Egypt, and the population of the pharaohs themselves was approximately 3 million. Among these, 75% were farmers. This aligns with option B.

Answer: B
