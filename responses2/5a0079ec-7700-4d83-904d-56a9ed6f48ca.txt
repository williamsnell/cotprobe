Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a proton moving through a magnetic field. Hmm, I need to find the speed of the proton based on the given data. Let me try to remember what I know about charged particles in magnetic fields.

Wait, right, when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it experiences a force that causes it to move in a circular path. The force is given by the Lorentz force equation. Oh wait, the formula I think is F = q(v × B), but when the velocity is perpendicular, that simplifies to F = qvB, right? And this force provides the centripetal force needed for circular motion. So, F = mv²/r, or wait, no, because centripetal force is mv²/r, but that's when the force is the centripetal one. So, combining the two equations, I should set them equal.

So, the magnetic force provides the centripetal force. So:

qvB = mv²/r

Wait, I think I can rearrange this to solve for v. Let me see. Dividing both sides by m and the q gives:

v = (qB r)/(m)

Wait, or wait, let me double-check that. The equation is F = qvB = (mv²)/r. So yeah, that's right. So v would be (q B r) / (m).

Wait, but in the problem statement, they give the magnetic field as 1.0 weber per square meter. Oh, wait, the unit of magnetic field is Tesla. Because 1 T = 1 Wb/m². So the problem says 1.0 Wb/m², which is 1.0 T. So B is 1.0 T.

The radius of curvature is 0.22 m, so r is 0.22 m.

What's the charge of a proton? The charge q is +e, which is 1.602×10^-19 coulombs.

The mass of a proton is about 1.67×10^-27 kilograms. Wait, is that correct? Let me think: a proton's mass is approximately 1.67e-27 kg.

So putting it all together:

v = (q B r) / m

Substituting the values:

q = 1.602e-19 C
B = 1.0 T
r = 0.22 m
m = 1.67e-27 kg

So let's compute this step by step.

First, multiply q, B, and r. 

1.602e-19 * 1.0 * 0.22 = 1.602e-19 * 0.22 = let's calculate that.

0.22 is 0.22, so 1.602e-19 * 0.22 = 0.35244e-19, which is 3.5244e-20.

Then divide that by m, which is 1.67e-27 kg.

So 3.5244e-20 / 1.67e-27 = ?

Let me compute that. 3.5244 / 1.67 is approximately 2.110, and the exponents are 10^(-20 +27) = 10^7. So 2.110e7 m/s.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.1 x 10^7 m/s. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the formula. I think I might have made a mistake in the order of operations. Oh wait, I did it right: v = (q B r) / m. Because F = q v B = (m v²)/ r → v = (q B r) / m.

Wait, another thought: I remember sometimes the formula for the speed in a magnetic field is v = (q B r) / m. Yes, that's correct.

So yeah, the calculation leads to approximately 2.1e7 m/s, which is option I.

To determine the speed of the proton, we use the relationship between the magnetic force and the centripetal force for circular motion. The magnetic force provides the necessary centripetal force, leading to the equation:

\[
qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

Rearranging for \(v\), the speed of the proton, we get:

\[
v = \frac{q Br}{m}
\]

### Given Data:
- Magnetic field, \(B = 1.0 \, \text{T}\) (since \(1 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 = 1 \, \text{T}\))
- Radius of curvature, \(r = 0.22 \, \text{m}\)
- Charge of a proton, \(q = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)
- Mass of a proton, \(m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
v = \frac{(1.602 \times 10^{-19})(1.0)(0.22)}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
1.602 \times 10^{-19} \times 0.22 = 3.5244 \times 10^{-20}
\]

Now, divide by the mass:

\[
v = \frac{3.5244 \times 10^{-20}}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 2.110 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated speed is approximately \(2.1 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}\), which corresponds to **option I**.
