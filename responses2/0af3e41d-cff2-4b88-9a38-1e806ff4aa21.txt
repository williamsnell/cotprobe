Okay, so I've got this law question about contracts and the trial court's decision. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The scenario is Connie and Computer Retailer Inc. Connie buys a laptop from Computer Retailer for $1,000. Then a salesperson offers her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200, making the total $2,200. Wait, no, actually, wait. The service agreement is part of the purchase? Or is it separate?

Wait, the laptop cost $1,000. Then, Computer Retailer sold her a service agreement for $1,200, adding up to $2,200 total. The laptop stopped working nine months later, and the retailer refused. So Connie is suing.

The question is about what the trial court will likely find for Connie or Computer Retailer.

I remember something about the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) and how the purpose of the contract determines what the court holds. The UCC has both the goods and services parts. So, the main thing is determining the primary purpose of the contract.

Looking at the options, the options are about Connie's case under common law or UCC. The question is about which law applies.

Wait, in the UCC, a service agreement is a service. The primary purpose under the UCC is the goods, but if something like a service is part of the agreement, does the court's rule apply?

I think that if one side is better off only by a small amount, the court might prioritize the goods part. But in this case, Connie paid $1,000 for the laptop, and they sold her a service for $1,200. But the laptop stopped working—maybe she's losing the laptop but not getting the service. Alternatively, the service might not be worth as much as the laptop for Connie.

Wait, but the laptop was purchased from the retailer. So if the retailer sold her a service agreement, the laptop is the goods part, and the service is a service. So Connie's total was $2,200. The laptop was worth $1,000, and the service agreement was for $1,200.

In the UCC, the goods (laptop) part is $1,000, the service part is $1,200. So the goods are worth less than the service. So under UCC, the service is the primary purpose. But wait, wait—wait, no, the service is the service, but the goods are the laptop. So which part is the primary purpose? Or is it that the goods are the main part.

Wait, the rule is that the primary purpose is the part that gives the greatest consideration. So if the service is part of the agreement, the service part is the primary purpose. But in some cases, like a service contract, the goods are the main part. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think the goods are the main part. Because the service is an additional service. So if the service is part of the agreement, then the goods are the main. Alternatively, maybe the service is the main part, because it's a service agreement.

Wait, confusion here. Let me think. The UCC has two parts: goods and services. The goods part is the main consideration, and the service part is the service. So, if the service is part of the agreement, the service is the primary purpose.

In this case, Connie's laptop was purchased under the goods part. Then, a service agreement was sold. So the goods (laptop) are $1,000, the service is $1,200. So the service is the primary purpose.

But wait, the service agreement might not be a service but a contract for a service—like, maybe a service contract where the goods are the laptop and the service is the service provided. Hmm, but in the scenario, Connie bought the laptop and the service agreement. So the service is part of the agreement. So the service is the primary purpose.

Wait, but what's the rule? I remember that the rule is that the goods part is the primary consideration. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the rule is that the goods part is considered the primary consideration. So if the contract is a service agreement, the service is the primary purpose. So in this case, the service is part of the agreement, so the service is the primary purpose.

So under UCC, if the service is the primary purpose, then Connie, as the buyer, would be entitled to the service part (the service agreement) under UCC. Because the service is the main purpose.

Wait, but wait another thing. The service is part of the agreement. Connie's entire payment was for the laptop and the service? Or was the service a separate contract?

Wait, the laptop was purchased for $1,000, and the service agreement for $1,200. So the total is $2,200. So Connie's payment covers both.

In any case, the service is part of the agreement. So the service is the primary purpose under UCC.

So, the question is, what's the outcome? If Connie sues, under what law would she be entitled? The options are about common law or UCC.

Option A says, under common law because the primary purpose was the sale of goods. But that can't be right because the service is the primary purpose. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Connie under UCC only if the primary purpose was the goods part. But in this case, the primary is the service part, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Connie under UCC unless the primary purpose was for the service. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read it again. Option C says Connie, under UCC unless the primary purpose is for the service agreement. So the court would decide under UCC unless the primary purpose is the service.

But in this case, the primary purpose is the service, so C's condition is not met. So the court would apply UCC, unless the primary purpose was for the service.

Wait, no. The wording is a bit tricky. Option C says, "under the UCC unless the primary purpose was for the service agreement portion of the contract."

Wait, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Let me parse it: "unless the court determines that the primary purpose was for the service agreement portion of the contract."

So, if the primary purpose is the service, then under UCC, Connie would be entitled. But in this case, the primary purpose is the service. So the condition is not met.

Wait, no, wait. We're in the situation where the primary purpose is the service. So, the condition in option C is, "unless the court determines that the primary purpose was for the service agreement portion." So if the primary purpose is for the service, then the condition is not satisfied, and the court would apply UCC.

Wait, no, the way the option is written, "unless the primary purpose was for the service." So if it was for the service, the condition is not met—so the court would apply UCC. But in this case, the primary purpose is the service, so the condition is not met. So the court would apply UCC.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me re-express the options:

Option C: Connie, under the UCC unless the primary purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.

Wait, that's a bit odd wording. So the condition is that if the primary purpose is for the service, then the court applies UCC. But in our scenario, the primary purpose is the service, so the condition is not met, and the court applies UCC.

Wait, no. The option says, "unless the primary purpose was for the service." So if the primary purpose is for the service, the condition is not met, so the court applies UCC. But in our case, the primary purpose is for the service, so the condition is not met, so the court applies UCC.

Wait, wait: the option says if the primary purpose is the service, then the court applies UCC. So the opposite: if it's the service, then under UCC. So in our case, since it's the service, the court applies UCC.

Wait, but the scenario is that Connie is suing under the UCC. So under the UCC, Connie would be entitled to the service part.

So, options about the trial court's decision:

The options state that Connie could be entitled under common law if the primary purpose was the sale of goods. But in the case, the primary purpose is the service, so option A is incorrect.

Under the UCC, Connie would be entitled unless the primary purpose was for the service. So option C says "under the UCC unless the primary purpose is for the service." So that would imply that if the primary purpose is for the service, then the UCC applies. In our case, the primary purpose is the service, so under UCC, Connie is entitled.

So the correct outcome is that under the UCC, Connie is entitled since the primary purpose is the service. So the answer would be option C?

Wait, let's check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Connie, under the UCC unless the primary purpose was for the service agreement portion of the contract.

So, the condition is that if the primary purpose was for the service, then the court applies UCC. So in our scenario, the primary purpose was for the service agreement, so the condition isn't met—so the court applies UCC. So Connie is entitled under UCC.

Option B says Connie under UCC only if the primary purpose was for the goods. But that's opposite of what's happening.

Option C: so the court would apply UCC unless the primary purpose is for the service.

In our case, the primary purpose is for the service, so the court applies UCC.

So the correct answer is option C: Connie under the UCC unless the primary purpose was for the service.

Wait, but wait—another angle. The UCC might have some exceptions. For example, if the service is considered to be a service contract, maybe the goods part is treated differently. Or perhaps the UCC doesn't apply unless the service is treated as a separate service.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another approach: the rule is that the goods are the main part, and the service is an additional service. So if the service is part of the agreement, then the service is the primary purpose. So Connie is entitled to the service part.

In the UCC, this would mean that Connie is entitled to the service agreement, so answer C would be correct.

So the trial court would likely find Connie under the UCC unless the primary purpose was for the service agreement. But in our case, primary purpose is service, so option C says "unless [primary purpose was for the service], so the court applies UCC.

Wait, but the option's wording is a bit tricky. Let me rephrase the options:

Option C: Connie, under the UCC unless the primary purpose was for the service agreement.

Wait, no. The option says "unless the primary purpose was for the service." So if the primary purpose is for the service, then the condition is not met, so under UCC, Connie is entitled.

In our case, primary purpose is service, so the condition is not met, so UCC applies.

So the answer is option C.

Connie Computer decided to purchase a $1,000 laptop from Computer Retailer Inc., which also sold a 5-year service agreement for $1,200, making the total $2,200. The laptop stopped working nine months later, and the retailer refused to perform on the service agreement. Connie is suing Computer Retailer. The question is under what law the trial court will likely find Connie.

The key issue revolves around the primary purpose of the contract. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the primary purpose is typically the goods part of the agreement, unless the service is part of the agreement. In this case, the laptop was purchased under the goods part, and the service agreement was part of the contract. The service is more valuable than the laptop, so the service is considered the primary purpose.

The UCC governs the treatment of the goods and services parts of the contract. If the service is part of the agreement, it is treated as a service, and the goods (laptop) are the main consideration. Therefore, Connie, as the buyer, is entitled to the service part of the agreement under the UCC.

Option A is incorrect because the primary purpose is not the sale of goods; it is the service agreement. Option B is also incorrect because Connie is entitled to the service part under UCC. Option C correctly states that Connie is entitled under UCC unless the primary purpose was for the service agreement, which aligns with our analysis. Option D is irrelevant as it focuses on intent and not relative dollars.

ANSWER: C
