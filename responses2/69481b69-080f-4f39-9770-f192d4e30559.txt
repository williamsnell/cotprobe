Okay, so I've got this question about the Earth's rotation at the equator. Hmm, I remember that the Earth spins on its axis, and the speed varies depending on where you are. But wait, the question is specifically about the equator. I think I need to recall the formula or the approximate speeds at different latitudes.

I remember there's a formula related to the Earth's circumference. The Earth's circumference is roughly 24,901 miles. Oh wait, no, more accurately, it's about 24,901 miles. So if the circumference is the distance around the Earth, and the Earth rotates 360 degrees in a day, then each point on the Earth's surface (except the poles) completes a full rotation in about 24 hours.

So, the Earth's rotation speed at the equator would be the Earth's circumference divided by the time it takes to complete one rotation. Let's compute that. Circumference is about 24,901 miles. Time is 24 hours. So 24,901 divided by 24. Let me do that calculation.

24,901 รท 24. Well, 24 x 1000 is 24,000. So 24,901 - 24,000 = 901. So 901 left. 901 รท24 is approximately 37.54. So adding that to 1000, it's about 1037.54 miles per hour. Oh wait, so approximately 1040 mph.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A is about 2500 mph, which is way too high. B is 3000, also too high. C is 3500, even higher. D is 100, which is way lower. E is 2000, also lower than our calculated 1040. F is 500, lower. G is 1500, higher than 1040. H is 750, lower. I is 1000, which is about the number I got. J is 200, way too low.

Wait, but I thought the speed was about 1000 mph. So the correct answer should be I, about 1000 miles per hour. But wait, let me think again. Oh! Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because the Earth's rotation speed is actually about 1000 mph at the equator. But wait, wait, no, let me double-check because sometimes I get confused between poles and equator.

Wait, wait another way. The Earth's rotation period is about 23 hours and 56 minutes, which is roughly 24 hours. So 24,901 miles over 24 hours is indeed about 1040 mph. So I think the correct answer is I: about 1000 mph. But wait, looking at the options again. Let me list all options:

A: 2500
B:3000
C:3500
D:100
E:2000
F:500
G:1500
H:750
I:1000
J:200

Wait, so option I is 1000. That's 1040, so the closest is I. So the correct answer should be I: about 1000 mph.

But wait, wait a second. Wait, I think I have a different recollection. I've heard it's about 1000 mph. But I might have the speed wrong. Because now I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. The Earth's circumference is about 24,901 miles. Rotating every 24 hours (or 23:56), so 24 hours.

So 24,901 miles / 24 hours = 1037.54 mph. So approximately 1000 mph. So the correct answer is I. But wait, wait, I think I have another source in mind. Oh, wait! I'm not considering the difference between equator and poles. Because the pole's rotation is much faster, but the equator is slower. So yeah, the equator is about 1000 mph.

But wait, wait another thought. I remember that the speed at the equator is about 1000 mph. So the correct option is I.

The Earth's surface at the equator rotates at approximately 1000 miles per hour. This is calculated by dividing the Earth's circumference (about 24,901 miles) by the time it takes to complete one full rotation (24 hours). 

Answer: I: about 1000 miles per hour
