Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about solutes and distribution constants in a two-phase mixture. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through this.

So the question says a solute is added to a two-phase mixture where the components are immiscible at any proportion. That probably means they don't mix, so the solute can dissolve in one phase but not the other. But wait, I think the distribution constant (K_d) tells us about the solubility between the two components. Oh right, K_d is the ratio of the concentration of the solute in one phase to the other.

The distribution constant K_d is 508 here. Wait, that's a big number. So K_d = [solute in phase B] / [solute in phase A]. Or is it the other way around? I think the distribution constant is usually the concentration of the solute in the phase with the higher solubility. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. If K_d is the ratio of the concentrations in the two phases, then K_d = [A]/[B] where [A] is the concentration in phase A and [B] in phase B. Or is it the other way around? Maybe I should think about it in terms of solubility.

Wait, the distribution coefficient is the ratio of concentrations. So if a substance is more soluble in phase B than phase A, K_d would be larger. Since in this problem, K_d is 508, which is a large number, that implies that phase B is more concentrated. Or wait, no, wait. Suppose the solute is more soluble in B, so more in B. Then in phase B, the concentration is higher, so [A]/[B] would be less than 1. But K_d is 508. Alternatively, if the solute's concentration in B is much higher than A, then K_d is a big number. So K_d = (concentration of solute in B phase) / (concentration of solute in A phase) = 508. So that would imply that phase B has much more solute than A.

But wait, the question is asking for the fraction of the solute in phase B at equilibrium. So the total solute is the sum of the solute in both phases. Let me think about it. Let's say the initial solute added is S. Let x be the amount in phase A, and y in phase B. Then x + y = S.

The distribution is such that y = K_d * x. So substituting, x + K_d x = S → x (1 + K_d) = S → x = S/(1 + K_d) → y = K_d S/(1 + K_d).

So the fraction in phase B is y/S = (K_d S) / ( (1 + K_d) S ) ) → which simplifies to K_d / (1 + K_d).

So K_d is 508 here. So the fraction is 508 / (1 + 508) = 508 / 509.

Wait, 508 divided by 509 is approximately 0.998... Wait, that's almost 1. That can't be right because the options don't have a 0.998 fraction. Hmm, wait, maybe I messed up the setup.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, no. If K_d is the ratio of the solute in phase B to phase A, then y = K_d x. So x + y = S → x + K_d x = S → x(1 + K_d) = S → x = S/(1+K_d), and y = K_d S/(1+K_d).

So the fraction in phase B is y/S = K_d/(1 + K_d) → 508/(509) ≈ 0.998... but none of the options are close to that. Wait, looking at the options, the highest option is 2.5e-3, which is 0.0025. So I must have gotten this wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the definition of K_d reversed. Maybe K_d = [A]/[B], where [A] is the concentration in phase A. So if [A]/[B] = K_d, then [B] = [A]/K_d. Hmm, but that would mean that phase B has a lower concentration. Wait, but the problem says the solute is added to a mixture of immiscible components. So if it's more soluble in one phase than the other, then the higher concentration is in one phase. But the distribution constant is the ratio of the concentrations between the two phases. So perhaps I got the fraction wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the amount in phase B as a fraction of the total. Let's re-express. Let the total solute be S. Let x be the solute in phase A, y in B. x + y = S.

The distribution is y = K_d * x. So y = 508 x. So x = S - y = S -508 x → x (1 +508) = S → x = S/(509). So y = 508 S/(509).

So fraction in B is y/S = 508/(509) ≈ 0.998, which is about 0.998 of the total. But the options are much smaller. Wait, this can't be right. I must have a mistake.

Wait, maybe I've got the ratio backwards. Let's think again. The distribution constant K_d is given as the ratio of the concentration in phase B to that in phase A. So K_d = [B]/[A]. So [B] = K_d [A]. Then, the fraction in B is [B]/([A] + [B]) = [B]/( [A] (1 + K_d) )) = [B]/(S) = (K_d [A])/ ( [A] (1 + K_d) ) ) = K_d/(1 + K_d ). So same as before, 508/509.

But that's about 0.998, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the mole fractions. Because the total solute is the sum of the two phases. Let's suppose the mole fraction in phase B is y/(x+y). Since x and y are the amounts in each phase.

Wait, perhaps K_d is (y)/(x) → then y = K_d x. Then y = 508 x → same as before. So x + y = x (1 + K_d) = S → x = S/(1 + 508) → y = (508 S) / (508 +1). So y/S = 508/509 → approximately 0.998.

But the options are all around 0.001 to 0.003. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm getting the ratio reversed. Maybe K_d is [A]/[B] = x/y = 508. So x = 508 y. Then x + y = 508 y + y = 509 y = S → y = S/509.

So the fraction in phase B would be y/S = (S/509)/S = 1/509 → approximately 0.00196. But looking at options, option H is 1.96e-3, which is about 0.00196.

Wait, so why is this conflicting with the earlier approach? Because the first approach gave a fraction of 0.998, but that's not an option. The second approach gives 0.00196, which is option H.

Ah, but perhaps the problem is being interpreted in the wrong way. Maybe the distribution constant is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the solute in the second phase to the first phase. So K_d = [B]/[A] = 508. So [B] =508 [A]. Then, the total is [A] + [B] = S → [A] +508 [A] = S → [A](1 +508) = S → [A] = S/(509). [B]=508 S/(509).

So the fraction in B is [B]/S = 508/(509) ≈ 0.998, but that's not in the options.

Wait, the options have fractions like 0.001 to 0.002, which are much lower. So perhaps I'm thinking this through wrong. Maybe the distribution is the other way around.

Let me think again. Suppose K_d is the ratio of the solute concentration in phase B to that in phase A → K_d = [B]/[A] =508. So [B] =508 [A].

So the total is [A] + [B] = [A] +508 [A] = [A] (509) = S → [A] = S/509. [B] = (508 S)/509.

So fraction in B is [B]/S = (508 S/509)/S =508/509 ≈ 0.998. But options don't have that.

Wait, but the question says "the distribution constant, K_d, for the solute between the two components, A and B, is 508." So K_d is [B]/[A] =508. So [B] is much larger than [A], so phase B has a much larger concentration. So the fraction in B is [B]/( [A] + [B] ) = [B]/S.

Which is (508 S/509)/S =508/509. So 508/509 is approximately 0.998. But wait, the options don't have that.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Wait, perhaps K_d is the ratio of the concentration in A to B. Then [A]/[B] =508 → [B] = [A]/508. Then the total is [A] + [A]/508 = [A] (1 + 1/508 ) = [A] (509/508 ) → [A] = S * (508/509).

Then [B] = [A]/508 = (508 S/509 ) /508 → [B] = S/(509). So the fraction in B is S/(509)/S =1/509≈0.00196, which is about 0.00196. Looking at options, option H is 1.96e-3, which is 0.00196.

Ah, so the confusion arises from whether K_d is [B]/[A] or [A]/[B]. If K_d is [B]/[A], then the fraction in B is about 0.998, but that's not an option. If K_d is [A]/[B], then fraction in B is about 0.00196, which is option H.

So which is it? The question says K_d is 508, and the solute is added to a two-phase mixture of immiscible components. Which phase is more soluble?

Wait, the distribution coefficient K_d is a measure of how much more soluble a component is in one phase than another. Suppose the solute is more soluble in phase B. Then the distribution constant would be greater than 1. So K_d = [B]/[A] =508, which would mean [B] is much larger than [A], so more in phase B. So the fraction in B would be about 0.998, but that's not an option. So why is the fraction in the options so low?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The question is about the fraction of the solute in phase B. So perhaps K_d is the ratio of the solute concentrations. So if K_d = [B]/[A], then [B] is much larger. But the options don't include 0.998.

Wait, perhaps I've got the setup wrong. Maybe the formula should be K_d = [A]/([B]) → which would make [B] = [A]/K_d. Then, [A] + [B] = [A] + [A]/K_d = [A] (1 + 1/508) = [A]*(509/508). So [A] = S * (508/509). Then [B] = (508/509) * (508 S)/(508) ) → [B] = (508 S)/(509). So the fraction in B is [B]/S = (508/509) → ~0.998, which again is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is the other way around. Maybe the solute is more soluble in phase A, so K_d = [A]/[B] =508. Then [A] =508 [B]. So [A] + [B]=508 [B] + [B] =509 [B] = S → [B] = S/(509). So the fraction in B is [B]/S = 1/509 ≈0.00196, which is 0.00196. So that's about 1.96e-3, which is option H.

But why would K_d be 508 if the solute is more soluble in A than B? Because K_d is [A]/[B], which can be larger than 1 if [A] is larger than [B]. So if [A] is 508 times [B], then yes, K_d would be 508.

So the confusion was about which ratio is K_d. If K_d is [A]/[B] =508, then the fraction in B is 1/509 ≈ 0.00196 → option H.

Wait, but the question says "the distribution constant, K_d, for the solute between the two components, A and B, is 508." So K_d is [A]/[B] =508. So the fraction in B is 1/509. So approximately 0.00196, which is option H.

The problem involves a solute added to a two-phase mixture of immiscible components (A and B) with a distribution constant \( K_d = 508 \). The distribution constant is defined as the ratio of the solute concentrations in the two phases, \( K_d = \frac{[B]}{[A]} \). The goal is to calculate the fraction of the solute in phase B at equilibrium.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Distribution Constant**:
   - If \( K_d = \frac{[B]}{[A]} = 508 \), this indicates that phase B is significantly more concentrated than phase A.
   - The total solute in both phases is \( S \), so \( [A] + [B] = S \).

2. **Expressing in Terms of \( [A] \)**:
   - From \( K_d = \frac{[B]}{[A]} = 508 \), we get \( [B] = 508 [A] \).
   - Substituting into the total solute equation: \( [A] + 508 [A] = S \) → \( [A](1 + 508) = S \) → \( [A] = \frac{S}{509} \).
   - Therefore, \( [B] = 508 \cdot \frac{S}{509} = \frac{508S}{509} \).

3. **Fraction of Solute in Phase B**:
   - The fraction of the solute in phase B is \( \frac{[B]}{S} = \frac{\frac{508S}{509}}{S} = \frac{508}{509} \).
   - Simplifying, \( \frac{508}{509} \approx 0.998 \), which is approximately 99.8%. However, this result does not match any of the provided options.

4. **Revisiting the Definition of \( K_d \)**:
   - The problem states that \( K_d = 508 \), but it is crucial to clarify whether \( K_d \) is defined as \( \frac{[B]}{[A]} \) or \( \frac{[A]}{[B]} \).
   - If \( K_d = \frac{[A]}{[B]} = 508 \), then \( [A] = 508 [B] \). Substituting into the total solute equation: \( 508 [B] + [B] = S \) → \( [B](1 + 508) = S \) → \( [B] = \frac{S}{509} \).
   - The fraction of the solute in phase B is \( \frac{[B]}{S} = \frac{\frac{S}{509}}{S} = \frac{1}{509} \approx 0.00196 \), which is approximately 0.00196 or 1.96 × 10⁻³.

5. **Matching with Options**:
   - Among the options provided, \( 1.96 \times 10^{-3} \) corresponds to option **H**.

### Conclusion:
The correct fraction of the solute in phase B, based on the definition \( K_d = \frac{[A]}{[B]} = 508 \), is \( 1.96 \times 10^{-3} \). This matches option **H**.
