Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the number of moles in a certain amount of propane. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking how many moles of propane (C3H8) are in 6.2 grams of it. The options are labeled from A to J.

Alright, I remember that moles are calculated using the molar mass of the substance. The formula for moles is moles = mass (g) divided by molar mass (g/mol). So first, I need to find the molar mass of propane.

Propane is C3H8. So each molecule has 3 carbons and 8 hydrogens. Carbon has an atomic mass of about 12.01 g/mol, and hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol. So I need to calculate the total for propane.

Let me do the math: 3 carbons times 12.01 equals... 36.03. And 8 hydrogens times 1.008 is... 8.064. Adding those together gives 36.03 + 8.064 = 44.094 g/mol. Wait, is that right? Let me check the calculations again. 3 * 12.01 is indeed 36.03. 8 * 1.008: 1.008 * 8 is 8.064. So 36.03 +8.064 is 44.094 g/mol. That's the molar mass.

Now, the mass given is 6.2 grams. So moles = 6.2 g / 44.094 g/mol. Let me compute that. Let's see, 6.2 divided by 44.094. Hmm, 44.094 is approximately 44.1. So 6.2 / 44.1. Let me compute that. 44.1 goes into 6.2 once, with 1.8 left. Wait, no, wait. 44 * 0.14 is 6.16. Because 44 * 0.1 is 4.4; 44 *0.04 is 1.76. So 0.14 gives 44 * 0.14=6.16. So 44.1 *0.14 is 6.174. But wait, 6.2 is 6.174 plus 0.026. So 0.026 is a bit more than 0.02. So approximately 0.141 mol. Because 44.1 * 0.141 is 44.1 *0.1 is 4.41, 0.04 is 1.764, 0.001 is 0.0441. So 4.41 + 1.764 is 6.174, plus 0.0441 is 6.2181. Hmm, but wait, our numerator is 6.2, so maybe 0.141 is a bit high. Let me think. Let's do the division more accurately.

6.2 divided by 44.1. Let me compute it as 6200 divided by 44100 (to make it easier for decimal places). Well, wait, maybe using a calculator approach. 44.1 * 0.14 = 6.174. 6.174 is less than 6.2. The difference is 0.026. So 0.026 /44.1 = approximately 0.00059 (since 44.1 * 0.0005 is 0.02205). So 0.00059. So 0.14 + 0.00059 is 0.14059. So approximately 0.1406 moles.

Looking back at the options, let's see. The options are A:14.1, B:7.1, C:71, D:0.71, E:0.14, etc. Oh, wait, D is 0.71, which seems a bit high. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check the molar mass. C is 12.01, H is 1.008. So C3H8: 3*12.01 is 36.03, 8*1.008 is 8.064. Sum is 44.094 g/mol. Wait, but wait, 8 *1.008: 1.008 *8 is 8.064, correct. So that's correct.

Hmm, so 6.2 /44.094 = let me compute accurately. 44.094 * 0.14 = 6.17316. 6.17316 is less than 6.2. The difference is 6.2 -6.17316 =0.02684. So 0.02684 /44.094 = approximately 0.000609. So total is 0.14 +0.000609=0.140609 mol. Approximately 0.1406 mol. Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1.4e-1, which is 0.14, and D is 0.71. Hmm, but wait, 0.14 is option E, but wait the options given. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, the options are:

A:14.1 mol

B:7.1 mol

C:71 mol

D:14.1 ×10^-1 mol → 1.41 mol?

E:1.4 ×10^-1 → 0.14 mol

F:1.41 ×10^2 → 141 mol

G:7.1 ×10^-1 →0.71 mol

H:0.71 mol (same as G?)

I:1.4 mol

J:141 mol

Wait, D is 14.1 ×10^-1, which is 14.1 *0.1=1.41 mol. Hmm, but our calculation is about 0.14 mol. So neither D nor E is close; E is 0.14, but wait, 0.14 is E. But wait, wait, our calculation was 0.1406, which is approximately 0.141 mol. So looking at the options, option E is 1.4 ×10^-1, which equals 0.14. So the correct answer should be E. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting 0.1406, which is approximately 0.14. But let me make sure I'm doing the calculation correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation. Let me recheck. Carbon is 12.01, so 3 carbons: 3*12.01=36.03. Hydrogen is 8*(1.008)=8.064. Sum 36.03+8.064=44.094 g/mol. Correct.

So 6.2 /44.094 = ?

Wait, 44.094 * 0.14 = 6.17316. 6.2 -6.17316=0.02684. Now, 0.02684 /44.094 = approximately 0.000609. So total is 0.1406 mol. So approximately 0.141 mol.

Which option is that? The options:

Option I is 1.4 mol. That's way too high. Option E is 1.4e-1 →0.14.

So the correct answer would be E. But wait, let me recheck all the options again. Wait, looking at the options list again:

Options:

A:14.1

B:7.1

C:71

D:14.1 ×10^-1 →1.41

E:1.4 ×10^-1 →0.14

F:1.41 ×10^2→141

G:7.1 ×10^-1 →0.71

H:0.71

I:1.4 →1.4

J:141.

So our calculation is approximately 0.1406 mol, which is about 0.14. So the correct option is E, which is 1.4 ×10^-1 mol. So the answer is E.

To determine the number of moles of propane (C₃H₈) in 6.2 g, the molar mass of propane is calculated as follows:

1. **Calculate the molar mass of propane (C₃H₈):**  
   - Carbon (C): 3 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 36.03 g/mol  
   - Hydrogen (H): 8 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 8.064 g/mol  
   - Total molar mass = 36.03 + 8.064 = 44.094 g/mol  

2. **Use the formula for moles:**  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{6.2}{44.094} \approx 0.1406 \, \text{mol}
   \]  

3. **Compare with the options:**  
   - **Option E (1.4 × 10⁻¹ mol):** This corresponds to 0.14 mol, which is very close to the calculated value of 0.1406 mol.  
   - Other options are either too high (e.g., 14.1 mol, 71 mol, 141 mol) or too low (e.g., 7.1 mol, 0.71 mol).  

Thus, the correct answer is **E: 1.4 × 10⁻¹ mol**.
