Okay, so I've got this question about the impact of an open market sale on the money supply. Hmm, let me think. I remember that open market operations involve the Federal Reserve buying or selling government bonds from banks or other financial institutions. 

The question says the FED does an open market sale of $3,000,000 in government bonds. And the banks are fully "loaned up," meaning their excess reserves are zero. Oh wait, and the required reserve ratio is 25%. 

So, I'm trying to recall what that means. The required reserve ratio being 25% means that for every dollar a bank has in deposits, 25 cents must be held as reserves, and 75 cents can be lent out. If they're fully loaned up, that implies they are using all their excess reserves. Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm mixing things up. Full loan-up would mean that the banks are holding all their excess reserves. Because excess reserves are deposits minus required reserves. If they're fully "loaned up," meaning they can't lend more because they don't have excess reserves. So, their reserves are equal to required reserves. 

Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. If a bank is fully loaned up, it means it's not holding any excess reserves. So their reserves are exactly equal to required reserves. Because if they were holding any excess, they would be able to lend some more. So, in this case, their required reserve ratio is 25%, so they're holding 25% of their deposits as reserves, and can lend 75% of their deposits.

So when the FED sells $3,000,000 in bonds, they're taking from the banks. This makes the banks' reserves decrease by $3,000,000. But since the required reserve ratio is 25%, that means for every $1 they have in reserves, they have to hold 25 cents. Wait, but since they're selling bonds, which is like taking out reserves from the banks. 

Wait no, when the FED buys government bonds from banks, it increases the banks' reserves. But when they sell bonds (open market sale), they take money out of the banking system, which reduces the banks' reserves. That reduces the money they can lend out, which in turn affects the money supply through the multiplier effect.

So, the FED selling $3 million in bonds would reduce the banks' reserves by $3 million. But the question says the banks are fully "loaned up," which I think means they have no excess reserves. So, if the FED sells the bonds, reducing their reserves, and since they are already fully loaned up, that's the end of their lending capacity.

Wait, no, let's think again. If a bank is fully loaned up, they can't lend more because they've used up all their excess reserves. So, when the FED sells a bond, that reduces the bank's reserves. Suppose the bank had $10,000 in reserves. If they sell a bond, their reserves drop by $3,000,000. But if their required reserve ratio is 25%, that means the maximum they can have is their deposits minus (25% of deposits). Wait, no, the required reserve is 25% of deposits. So, if they have $X in deposits, they must hold 0.25X in reserves, and can lend 0.75X. 

But in this scenario, after the sale, their reserves would be reduced by $3,000,000. So their new reserves would be (original reserves - 3,000,000). But since the question says they're fully "loaned up," which I think means they can't lend any more because they have no excess reserves. Wait, no, that's not right. If they are fully loaned up, they can't make any more loans because they don't have excess reserves. So, if the FED sells a bond, reducing their reserves, but they can't lend anymore, that's when the money supply doesn't change because there's no change in the money supply; it's just a transfer.

Wait, no. Let me think of it another way. Open market operations impact the money supply through the lending process. When the Fed buys bonds, it increases the money supply. When it sells bonds, it decreases the money supply, but only up to a certain point.

Wait, more accurately, when the FED sells government bonds (like open market sale), it reduces the monetary base. The money supply is determined by the monetary base multiplied by the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1/(rr), where rr is the required reserve ratio. So, money multiplier is 1/0.25 = 4. So, the money supply would increase by 4 times the reduction in the monetary base.

Wait, the monetary base is the sum of the reserves held by banks and the deposits held by the public. If the FED sells $3M in bonds (i.e., reduces the monetary base by $3M), the money supply would increase by the money multiplier times this reduction. 

But wait, in this scenario, the banks are fully "loaned up," which I think means that they are not holding any excess reserves. So, when the Fed sells bonds, which reduces their reserves, but if they're fully loaned up, their reserves are already at the maximum. So, selling more bonds would mean they can't lend anymore, but the money supply might not change.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the money supply is still affected. Let me think. Open market operations: when the Fed sells bonds, it reduces the money supply. Because it takes money from the banks and gives them to the Fed. So, the money supply decreases by the amount of the bond sold multiplied by the money multiplier.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The money multiplier is 1/rr. So with rr=25%, the multiplier is 4. So, if the monetary base decreases by $3M, the money supply would increase by 3*4 = $12M. Because the formula is ΔM = ΔMB * (1/rr). Wait, no, the formula is that the money supply increases by the amount of the bond sold multiplied by the money multiplier.

Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think of the basic steps.

The monetary base (MB) is the sum of the reserves held by banks and the deposits held by the public. So, when the FED buys bonds, it's increasing the MB. When the FED sells bonds, it's decreasing MB.

When the Fed sells a bond, it takes money out of the banking system. This reduces the banks' reserves by $3M. But since the banks are fully loaned up, they can't lend any more money. So, the money that was lent out by the banks is now gone. So, the money supply would decrease by the amount of the bond sold, but multiplied by the money multiplier.

Wait, the money multiplier is 1/rr, so the change in the money supply is ΔMB * (1/rr). So, the MB decreases by $3M, so the money supply decreases by 3M * 4 = $12M. Because 1/0.25 is 4.

But wait, what about the effect on reserves and lending? Let me see. The FED sells a bond, which reduces the bank's reserves by $3M. But since the required reserve is 25%, the maximum they can lend is 75% of their deposits. Wait, no. If their reserves are reduced, but they are fully loaned up, that implies that their reserves have hit zero. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the concept.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model it as the FED selling bonds reduces the reserves by $3M. But since the required reserve ratio is 25%, the amount of money that can be lent out is 75% of the deposit, but in this case, the banks are fully 'loaned up', meaning they can't lend any more because they have no excess reserves. So, the excess reserves are zero. Wait, no, when the required reserve ratio is 25%, the excess reserves are deposits minus required reserves. So, if the required reserve ratio is 25%, and the banks are fully loaned up, that would mean that their excess reserves are zero. So, they can't lend any more.

But how does selling a bond affect this? Let's think: when the FED sells a bond, it takes a loan from the banks. So the money supply increases because the money that was in the banks is now freed up. But since the banks were fully 'loaned up', meaning they were not in a position to lend any more, then the money that was in the bank's reserves is now taken out. So the money supply would decrease because the money that was in the banks' reserves is no longer there.

Wait, no. Let me model it step by step.

Suppose a bank has $100,000 in deposits. rr =25%, so required reserves are $25,000. Excess reserves are $75,000.

If the FED sells a bond, the bank's reserves decrease by $3,000,000 (assuming the bond is worth $3M). So, after the sale, the bank's reserves are down by $3 million.

But since they were fully loaned up, that implies that they have no excess reserves. Wait, no, that can't be because if they have $3M less in reserves, they can still lend up to 75% of their deposits.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the money multiplier again. The change in MB is -3M (since the FED is selling bonds, MB decreases). The change in the money supply is ΔMB * (1/rr). So, 3M * 4 = 12M. So, the money supply decreases by 12M. So the answer would be a $12,000,000 reduction. That's option B.

Alternatively, another approach: when the FED sells a bond equivalent to the $3M, the money that's in the banking system is reduced by $3M. But because the required reserve ratio is 25%, the money supply increases by 4 times that, so 12M. So the money supply decreases by 12M.

So the answer would be B.
</think>

The question involves the impact of an open market sale by the Federal Reserve of $3,000,000 in government bonds, given that commercial banks are fully "loaned up" and have a required reserve ratio of 25%. 

When the FED sells bonds, it reduces the monetary base by $3,000,000. Since the banks are fully "loaned up," they have no excess reserves, meaning they cannot lend any more money. This reduction in reserves affects the money supply through the money multiplier effect. The money multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{rr} \), where \( rr \) is the required reserve ratio. Here, \( rr = 25\% \), so the money multiplier is \( \frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \).

The change in the money supply is therefore the change in the monetary base multiplied by the money multiplier:  
\[
\Delta M = \Delta MB \times \frac{1}{rr} = (-3,000,000) \times 4 = -12,000,000
\]  
This indicates a reduction in the money supply of $12,000,000.

Thus, the correct answer is:
