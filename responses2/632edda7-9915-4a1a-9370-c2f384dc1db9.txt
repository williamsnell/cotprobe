Okay, so I have this problem about finding the current through a capacitor at t=0. The capacitor has three different voltage functions given in parts (a), (b), and (c). I remember that the current through a capacitor is related to the derivative of the voltage with respect to time. Oh right, the formula is I = C * dV/dt.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): The voltage is 2 sin(2π10^6 t) volts. Hmm, the derivative of sine is cosine. So dV/dt would be 2 * (2π10^6) cos(2π10^6 t). Then I multiply that by the capacitance, which is 0.01 microfarads. Wait, microfarads is 1e-6 farads. So 0.01 microfarad is 1e-8 farad.

So putting it together: I = C * (2 * 2π10^6) cos(0) because at t=0, cos(0) is 1. Let me calculate that. First, 2 * 2π1e6 is 4πe6. Multiply that by 1e-8 F. So 4πe6 * 1e-8 = 4πe-2. Wait, 4π is about 12.566. So 12.566 * 0.01 (since 1e-2 is 0.01) is approximately 0.12566 A. So that's about 0.1256 A for part (a). Looking at the options, the first numbers in the options for part (a) are 0.1256, 0.2, etc.

Wait, for (a), the current is 0.1256 A. Let's move on to (b).

Part (b): voltage is -2 e^(-10 t) volts. Wait, wait, let me double-check the exponent. Oh wait, the exponent is - (10)7 t? Oh no, wait, the expression is -2 e^-(10)7 t V? Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps it's -2 e^{-10^7 t}? No, probably -2 multiplied by e to the power of -10^7 t. Hmm, but let me make sure. Oh, wait, the problem says (b) is -2 e^-(10)7 t V. Wait, maybe that's a typo. Let me double-check the original problem. Oh, wait, the user wrote "(b) - 2e^-(10)7 t V". Oh, wait, actually, perhaps it's -2 e^{-10,7 t}? Or maybe it's -2 e^{-10^7 t}? Hmm, perhaps it's written as -2 e^{-10 t} V. Wait, the user wrote (b) as -2e^-(10)7 t. So perhaps the exponent is -10^7 t. So that's e^(-1e7 t). So the voltage is V(t) = -2 e^(-1e7 t) volts.

The derivative of V(t) with respect to t is dV/dt = (-2) * (-1e7) e^{-1e7 t} = 2e7 e^{-1e7 t}. Then, the current I is C * dV/dt. Substituting C=0.01e-6 F (since 1 microfarad is 1e-6), so 0.01e-6 = 1e-8 F.

So I = 1e-8 F * 2e7 e^{-1e7 t} = (2e7 * 1e-8) e^{-1e7 t} = 0.2 e^{-1e7 t} A.

Wait, but at t=0, e^{-1e7 * 0} is e^0=1. So I at t=0 is 0.2 A. Hmm, looking at the options, for (b), the options are 0.1256, 0.3, 0.1256 etc. So the current for (b) is 0.2 A. So somewhere, looking for the first number in each option.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option F: 0.1256, 0.2, -0.1256. Hmm, but (b) is 0.2 A. So for (b), the current is 0.2 A. So the options' second number is 0.2. So the option that starts with 0.2 A as the first value is option F. Let me check option F: (a) 0.1256, (b) 0.2, (c) -0.1256. So that would fit. So for (b), the current is 0.2 A.

Now part (c): voltage is -2 e^{-10 t} V. Wait, that's a small exponent. Wait, perhaps it's -2 e^{-10 * t} V? Or perhaps it's -2 e^{-10^7 t}? Because the way it's written is a bit ambiguous. The original problem says (c) is -2e-(10)7 tsin(2π10^6 t) V. Oh wait, no, the problem (c) is just -2e^{-10^7 t} V, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as -2e^{-10 t} V. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that (c) is V(t) = -2 e^{-10 t} sin(2pi 1e6 t) V. Because that's the full expression.

Wait, but the problem says (c) is -2e^{-10^7 t} V. No, wait, no, looking again: the problem says part (c) is "- 2e-(10)7 tsin 2π 10^6t V". Oh, so the exponent is - (10)7 t? Or is it e^{-10 * 1e6 t}? Because the way the problem is written is "-2e^{-(10)7 t} V", which is e^(-10 * 7 t) or e^{-70 t}? Hmm, that's tricky. Let me parse the exponent: it's written as (10)7. Wait, perhaps it's a typo and it's e^{-10^7 t} V, but perhaps the user made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the exponent is -10^7 t. So V(t) = -2 e^{-10^7 t} sin(2pi *1e6 t) V.

If that's the case, then when t=0, sin(0) is 0. So the voltage is zero. So the derivative of V(t) at t=0 would be [d/dt (-2 e^{-10^7 t} sin(2pi 1e6 t)) ] evaluated at t=0.

Let me compute dV/dt:

dV/dt = (-2) * [ d/dt ( e^{-10^7 t} sin(2pi1e6 t) ) ]

Using product rule: derivative of e^{-10^7 t} is -10^7 e^{-10^7 t}, and derivative of sin(2pi1e6 t) is 2pi1e6 cos(2pi1e6 t).

So,

dV/dt = (-2) * [ (-10^7 e^{-10^7 t}) * sin(2pi1e6 t) + e^{-10^7 t} * (2pi1e6 cos(2pi1e6 t)) ) ]

At t=0, e^0 is 1. So,

dV/dt = (-2) [ (-10^7 * 0) + (1) * (2pi1e6 * 1) ) ]

Because sin(0) is 0, and cos(0) is 1.

So,

dV/dt = (-2) [ 0 + 2pi1e6 ] = (-2)(2pi1e6) = -4pi1e6.

Wait, no: wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 

The expression is: (-2) * [ (-10^7 * 0) + (1 * 2pi 1e6 *1) ) ] = (-2) * (2pi1e6) = -4 pi 1e6.

So the current I is C * (dV/dt) = 0.01e-6 F * (-4 pi 1e6).

Compute that:

0.01e-6 * (-4 pi 1e6) = 0.01 * 1e-6 * (-4 pi) * 1e6 = 0.01 * (1e6 / 1e6) * (-4 pi) = 0.01 * (-4 pi) = -0.04 pi.

Hmm, but 0.04 pi is approximately 0.12566. So -0.12566 A. But wait, our calculation shows dV/dt is -4 pi * 1e6? Let me double-check.

Wait, 1e6 is 10^6. 1e6 * 1e6 is 1e12? No, wait, no. Wait, the calculation is:

dV/dt = (-2) [ (-10^7 * sin(0) ) + (1 * 2pi * 1e6 * cos(0) ) ) ]

Because e^{-10^7 *0}=1, so the first term is (-10^7)*0=0. The second term is 1 * 2pi*1e6 *1. So, dV/dt = (-2) (0 + 2pi*1e6) = (-2)(2pi*1e6) = -4 pi 1e6.

Wait, so multiplying by C=0.01e-6 F:

0.01e-6 * (-4 pi *1e6) = 0.01e-6 * 1e6 * (-4 pi) = 0.01 * (-4 pi) = -0.04 pi.

Wait, 0.04 pi is approximately 0.12566, so this gives I = -0.12566 A.

Wait, but wait, I can calculate 0.04 pi: pi is about 3.1416, so 0.04 *3.1416 = 0.125664.

So current is -0.12566 A. Looking at the options, for part (c), the third option is -0.1256 A. So the current is approximately -0.1256 A.

Now, looking at the parts:

(a) I = 0.1256 A

(b) I = 0.2 A

(c) I = -0.1256 A

So now, looking at the options provided.

Option F is (a) 0.1256, (b) 0.2, (c) -0.1256. So that's F.

Wait, but wait, let me check each option's parts.

Option F: (a) 0.1256, (b) 0.2, (c) -0.1256.

So according to that, the correct option is F.

To determine the current through a 0.01 μF capacitor at \( t = 0 \) for each given voltage function, we use the formula for current in a capacitor: 

\[
I = C \frac{dV}{dt}
\]

where \( C = 0.01 \ \mu\text{F} = 1 \times 10^{-8} \ \text{F} \).

### (a) Voltage: \( V(t) = 2 \sin(2\pi \times 10^6 t) \ \text{V} \)
The derivative of \( V(t) \) is:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 2 \times 2\pi \times 10^6 \cos(2\pi \times 10^6 t)
\]
At \( t = 0 \), \( \cos(0) = 1 \), so:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi \times 10^6
\]
Multiplying by \( C \):
\[
I = 1 \times 10^{-8} \times 4\pi \times 10^6 = 0.1256 \ \text{A}
\]
Thus, the current is \( 0.1256 \ \text{A} \).

### (b) Voltage: \( V(t) = -2 e^{-10^7 t} \ \text{V} \)
The derivative of \( V(t) \) is:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = -2 \times (-10^7) e^{-10^7 t} = 2 \times 10^7 e^{-10^7 t}
\]
At \( t = 0 \), \( e^{0} = 1 \), so:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 2 \times 10^7
\]
Multiplying by \( C \):
\[
I = 1 \times 10^{-8} \times 2 \times 10^7 = 0.2 \ \text{A}
\]
Thus, the current is \( 0.2 \ \text{A} \).

### (c) Voltage: \( V(t) = -2 e^{-10^7 t} \sin(2\pi \times 10^6 t) \ \text{V} \)
The derivative of \( V(t) \) is:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = -2 \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( e^{-10^7 t} \sin(2\pi \times 10^6 t) \right) \right]
\]
Using the product rule:
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( e^{-10^7 t} \sin(2\pi \times 10^6 t) \right) = (-10^7 e^{-10^7 t}) \sin(2\pi \times 10^6 t) + e^{-10^7 t} (2\pi \times 10^6 \cos(2\pi \times 10^6 t))
\]
At \( t = 0 \), \( \sin(0) = 0 \) and \( \cos(0) = 1 \), so:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = -2 \left[ 0 + (1) (2\pi \times 10^6) \right] = -4\pi \times 10^6
\]
Multiplying by \( C \):
\[
I = 1 \times 10^{-8} \times (-4\pi \times 10^6) = -0.1256 \ \text{A}
\]
Thus, the current is \( -0.1256 \ \text{A} \).

### Final Answer
For each part:
- (a) \( 0.1256 \ \text{A} \)
- (b) \( 0.2 \ \text{A} \)
- (c) \( -0.1256 \ \text{A} \)

This matches **Option F**:
\[
\text{F: } (a) \, 0.1256 \, \text{A}, \, (b) \, 0.2 \, \text{A}, \, (c) \, -0.1256 \, \text{A}
\]
