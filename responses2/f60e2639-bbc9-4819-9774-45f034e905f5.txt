Okay, so I've got this question about a voltmeter and limiting error. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says the voltmeter has a guaranteed accuracy of 2% of full scale. The full scale reading is 100 V, so the accuracy would be 2% of 100, which is 2 V. Oh wait, but wait, let me get that right. So 2% of 100 V is 2 V. So the voltmeter's accuracy is 2%—which means the maximum error is plus or minus 2 V.

The measured voltage is 75 V. Now, the limiting error is the maximum possible error. But wait, what's the formula for limiting error? I think it's the difference between the measured value and the actual value, but considering the accuracy. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. The limiting error is calculated based on the accuracy. The accuracy is given as a percentage of full scale, so the maximum possible error is ± (accuracy) * full scale. So, in this case, it's ±2% of 100 V, which is 2 V. So the limiting error is 2 V.

But wait, the question is about the percentage error, not the absolute value. So to find the percentage error, we take the limiting error (2 V) divided by the measured value (75 V) and multiply by 100. Let's calculate that: (2 / 75) * 100. Hmm, 2 divided by 75 is approximately 0.026666..., which is about 2.666... percent. So that's 2.666...%, which is roughly 2.67%.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.66%, which matches our calculation. Other options are 2%, 3%, etc. So the limiting error is about 2.66%, so the correct answer must be B.

The voltmeter has a guaranteed accuracy of 2% of full scale (100 V), corresponding to a maximum error of ±2 V. The measured voltage is 75 V, and the limiting error is the maximum possible error relative to the measured value. To calculate the percentage error:

1. Limiting error = ±2 V
2. Percentage error = (Limiting error / Measured value) × 100 = (2 / 75) × 100 ≈ 2.666...

The closest option is **B: 2.66%**.

Answer: B
