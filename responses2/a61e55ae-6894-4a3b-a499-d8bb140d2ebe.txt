Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about goods categories, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is: These goods are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve a reasonably high level of consumer risk. The options are A to J, each representing different types of goods.

First, I need to understand each category based on the characteristics mentioned. The key points are:

1. **Frequently bought**: So it's not something you buy often.
2. **Used repeatedly**: This implies that once you use it, you don't buy it again.
3. **High level of consumer risk**: This suggests that the goods are not reliable, are expensive, or have issues that could be risky for consumers.

Let me go through each option one by one.

**Option A: Staple goods.**
Staple goods are things that are commonly used and needed for daily life. They're essential for survival. For example, food, water, shelter, and clothing. These are frequently bought because they're essential. So they're not infrequent. Also, they're not used repeatedly; typically, you just use them once. Plus, they're not high risk. So probably not A.

**Option B: Specialty goods.**
Specialty goods are unique or niche items. They might not be as common or essential. For example, rare collectibles, rare medications, or very specific products. These could be bought infrequently because they're not as common, but they might not be used repeatedly. However, the question mentions a high level of risk. Specialty goods can be risky if they're not well-maintained or if there's a sudden problem. Also, they might be bought infrequently because of their niche nature. But I'm not sure if they're "used repeatedly."

Wait, but the options mention "used repeatedly." So if they're bought infrequently, maybe they're not bought often. But I'm not sure if they're bought repeatedly. Maybe I'll come back to this.

**Option C: Luxury goods.**
Luxury goods are high-end products, often sought after by wealthy individuals. They're usually bought infrequently because they're exclusive. But I don't think they're used repeatedly. They might have a high risk because they can be expensive, but they're not necessarily bought frequently. So not sure if this fits, but maybe not the best fit.

**Option D: Perishable goods.**
Perishable goods are those that have a limited shelf life, like food that can spoil quickly or items that expire. These are typically bought infrequently because they're not carried in large quantities. They're not used repeatedly, but I think they are consumed quickly. They also have a high risk because they can spoil or become unavailable. So this seems to fit some of the criteria. But wait, the question says "high level of consumer risk," which could align with perishable goods.

**Option E: Impulse goods.**
Impulse purchases are quick, unthought decisions made without careful consideration. These are bought infrequently because people don't take them seriously. They might be used once and then discarded. But this doesn't seem to fit the criteria of being bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and having high risk. Impulse items are more random and might not fit the "used repeatedly" part. They're often consumed quickly and not carried around much. So maybe E is not the right answer.

**Option F: Durable goods.**
Durable goods are intended for long-term use and are usually bought infrequently because they're not in short supply. They're used repeatedly, but durability is a benefit, not a risk. So this doesn't fit the criteria of a high level of risk. So F is probably not correct.

**Option G: Non-durable goods.**
Non-durable goods are used once and then thrown away. They're bought infrequently because they're not needed for long periods. They might be used repeatedly, but they're not durable. However, the question is about high consumer risk. If the goods are used once and thrown away, they are not bought repeatedly, so G might not fit.

**Option H: Services.**
Services are not typically bought infrequently; they're often used for long periods. For example, services like consulting or software are long-term. So this doesn't fit the criteria.

**Option I: Unsought goods.**
These are goods that are not purchased at all. They don't fit the criteria of being bought infrequently, used repeatedly, or having a high risk. So I is not the answer.

**Option J: Complementary goods.**
Complementary goods are used together with another item. They might be bought infrequently if the main item is not bought often. They might not be used repeatedly. So J doesn't fit.

Now, going back to D: Perishable goods. They are bought infrequently because they have a limited life. They are not used repeatedly, but they have a high risk because they can go bad or become unavailable. So this seems to fit the question's criteria. But wait, the question says "used repeatedly," which I think applies to items that are consumed or used up quickly. Perishable items are consumed quickly, so maybe they are used repeatedly. But in reality, people might buy them once and then discard them, so they aren't bought repeatedly.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The options are about the frequency of purchase, not the use. So for example, if something is used repeatedly, that's about how often you use it, not how often you buy it.

Wait, the question says "infrequently bought" and "used repeatedly." So if something is bought infrequently, but then used once and discarded, maybe that's not "used repeatedly." Hmm, this is confusing.

Another approach: Let's consider what each term implies. For example, "used repeatedly" could mean that the product is being used up, but not necessarily that it's bought often. So maybe the category is about products that are used up quickly, like certain medications or items that expire.

But going back, the key is that the goods are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and have a high risk. So perishable goods are bought infrequently because they run out quickly, but are they used repeatedly? They might be used once and then discarded. So maybe D is not the best fit because they are not used repeatedly.

Wait, but the options are about the category of the goods, not their usage. So D: Perishable goods are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, but their risk comes from their limited lifespan. So yes, they fit the criteria.

Alternatively, maybe "used repeatedly" refers to using them up, but I'm not sure. I'm a bit stuck, but I think D is the correct answer because they are infrequent, have a high risk (like expiring), and are used frequently.

The correct answer is **D: Perishable goods**. These goods are bought infrequently due to their limited shelf life, but they are used repeatedly (though often discarded quickly). Their high risk comes from the possibility of spoilage or degradation, which aligns with the criteria of infrequent purchase, repeated use, and high consumer risk.

Answer: D
