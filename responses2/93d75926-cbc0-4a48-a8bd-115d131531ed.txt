Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the pH of a solution after adding some HCl. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in class.

The problem has two parts. First, I need to find the pH of a 0.5 M solution that's a mixture of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and sodium acetylate (CH3COONa). Then, after adding 0.1 mole of HCl per liter, I have to calculate the new pH. The acid dissociation constant, Ka, is given as 1.75e-5. Oh wait, I remember that the formula for the pH of a weak acid solution can be found using the approximation if the concentration is low compared to the Ka. But wait, wait—actually, I think the formula is pH = ½ (pKa - log C), but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, that's the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, right? It's pH = pKa + log ( [base]/[acid] ). Yes, that's right. So for the first part, when the solution is just 0.5 M acetic acid and sodium acetate, both are at the same concentration because Na+ comes from the salt. So their concentrations are equal. So the log term would be log(1) = 0. So pH would just be the pKa. Oh, wait, but wait—the solution is a buffer, so pH = pKa. So the first part is straightforward.

Calculating pKa: Ka is 1.75e-5. So pKa is -log(1.75e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.75) is about 0.243, so log(1.75e-5) is approximately 0.243 -5 = -4.757. So pKa is about 4.757. So the pH of the first part would be approximately 4.757, which is about 4.76. So part (a) pH is 4.76.

Wait, but wait—the initial solution is 0.5 M acetic acid and sodium acetate. So the concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO⁻ are both 0.5 M. So the ratio is 1. So Henderson-Hasselbalch gives pH = pKa → 4.76. Okay, so part (a) is 4.76.

Now part (b): After adding 0.1 mole HCl per liter. Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. So adding 0.1 moles per liter of HCl will increase the concentration of H+ ions in the solution.

Wait, but the volume is unchanged, so the solution remains the same volume. Let me think about the initial conditions. Initially, the solution is 0.5 M acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate). Then, adding HCl will react with the acetate ion.

The reaction should be: H+ + CH3COO⁻ → CH3COOH.

So, when I add 0.1 M HCl (since it's 0.1 mole per liter), the H+ concentration will increase by 0.1 M.

But wait, the initial solution has 0.5 M CH3COO⁻, because it's the sodium salt of acetic acid. So adding 0.1 M H+ will react with the acetate. The amount of H+ added is 0.1 M, so it'll neutralize some of the acetate, increasing acetic acid's concentration.

Let me model this. Let's denote the initial concentrations as:

CH3COOH: 0.5 M

CH3COO⁻: 0.5 M

After adding HCl:

H+ from HCl: 0.1 M.

Reaction: CH3COO⁻ + H+ → CH3COOH.

So, the H+ from HCl (0.1) will react with CH3COO⁻ (0.5). The amount of H+ is 0.1, which is less than 0.5, so all of H+ will react, and some CH3COO⁻ will be converted to CH3COOH.

The change will be:

CH3COO⁻: 0.5 - 0.1 = 0.4 M.

CH3COOH: 0.5 + 0.1 = 0.6 M.

Wait, but wait: the total volume is unchanged. So the concentrations after reaction would be:

[CH3COOH] = (0.5 + 0.1) = 0.6 M.

[CH3COO⁻] = 0.4 M.

Wait, but then I have a new buffer solution. So the pH can be calculated again using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log ( [base]/[acid] )

pKa is 4.76 as before.

Base is 0.4 M, acid is 0.6 M.

So log(0.4/0.6) = log(2/3) = log(0.666...) ≈ -0.1761.

So pH = 4.76 + (-0.1761) = 4.5839, approximately 4.58.

Wait, but wait—wait a second. Did I make a mistake here? Because when adding a strong acid like HCl to a buffer, the buffer's pH should decrease. Let me think: in the initial buffer, the pH is 4.76. Adding HCl (which is a strong acid and provides H+), which will react with the conjugate base (acetate) to form more acetic acid. So the pH should decrease, which is what I found. So 4.58 seems correct.

But wait, the options are given. Let me look at the options. Option J is 4.76 and 4.58. So the first part is 4.76, and the second part is 4.58. So the options would be option J.

Wait, but let me check another way: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial pH calculation. Let me re-calculate pKa.

Ka = 1.75e-5.

pKa = -log (1.75e-5) → Let's compute log(1.75e-5). 1.75e-5 = 1.75 * 1e-5. Log(1.75)=0.243, so log(1.75e-5)=0.243-5= -4.757. So pKa is 4.757 → approx 4.76. That's correct.

So the initial pH is 4.76. Then, after adding HCl, the pH is 4.58. So the pH values are 4.76 and 4.58. Looking at the options, option J is 4.76, 4.58.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option J says 4.76 and 4.58. So the correct answer would be option J. So the answer should be H: J? Wait, no, the options are:

A:4.70,4.60

B:4.85,4.50

C:4.76,4.65

D:4.65,4.85

E:4.85,4.76

F:5.00,4.90

G:4.58,4.76

H:4.90,4.76

I:4.65,4.76

J:4.76,4.58

So option J is 4.76 and 4.58. So the correct answer is J.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the pH of the 0.5 M solution of CH₃COOH and CH₃COONa (a weak acid buffer). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right)
\]

Here, the concentrations of CH₃COOH and CH₃COO⁻ are both 0.5 M, so the ratio \(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\) is 1. The pKa is calculated as:

\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.75 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.76
\]

Since the ratio is 1, the pH is simply the pKa:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.76
\]

Next, we consider the addition of 0.1 mole HCl per liter. HCl is a strong acid that dissociates completely, providing 0.1 M H⁺ ions. The H⁺ ions react with the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) in the buffer:

\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH}
\]

The initial moles of CH₃COO⁻ are 0.5 M, and the moles of H⁺ added are 0.1 M. After the reaction, the new concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.5 - 0.1 = 0.4 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = 0.5 + 0.1 = 0.6 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation again:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.76 + \log \left( \frac{0.4}{0.6} \right) = 4.76 + \log(0.6667) \approx 4.76 - 0.176 = 4.58
\]

Thus, the pH after adding HCl is approximately 4.58.

The two calculated pH values are 4.76 (initial buffer) and 4.58 (after adding HCl). Comparing these to the options, the correct choice is:

**J: 4.76, 4.58**
