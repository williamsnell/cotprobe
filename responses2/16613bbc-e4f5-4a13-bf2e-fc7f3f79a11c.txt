Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electric dipole and I'm supposed to find the potential energy and the torque acting on it. Hmm, I remember that dipoles interact with electric fields, and their potential energy and torque depend on certain formulas. Let me think through this step by step.

The dipole moment is given as p = (3.00 i + 4.00 j) * 1.24e-30 C·m. The electric field is E = 4000 N/C in the i direction. Wait, the question is in two parts: first, potential energy, then torque.

Wait, for potential energy, I think the formula is U = -p·E. Oh right, because the potential energy of a dipole in an electric field is given by the dot product of the dipole moment and the electric field, multiplied by negative one. So U = -p·E. But wait, that's only for the cases where E is along the dipole's axis—am I mixing that up with something else?

Wait, the dipole moment is a vector, and the electric field is another vector. The dot product takes the component of E in the direction of p. So in this case, E is in the i direction, and p has an i and j component. So when I take the dot product, p·E would be (3.00 * 4000) + (4.00 * 0) = 12000? Because E is only along i. So p·E = 3.00 * 4000 = 12000 C·m²/(N·m²)? Wait, no, the units would be (C·m) * (N/C) )= N·m. So yeah, p·E is (3 * 4000) * (i component of p) + (4 * 4000) * (j component of p). But wait, the j component of p is 4.00, so 4*4000 is 16000, but if E has no j component, then the j part doesn't contribute. So p·E = (3 * 4000) + (4 * 0) = 12000 N·m.

So U = - (12000) = -12000 J? Wait, but wait—no, because the unit of p is C·m, and E is N/C. So p·E would be (C·m) * (N/C) )= N·m, which is J. So U is -12000 J? That seems like a huge number, but the options are in the 1e-26 range. Wait, but that can't be right. Did I miss a factor of 1e-30 or something?

Wait, wait a minute. Oh, wait, I'm mixing up the order. The dipole moment is given as (3.00 i +4 j) *1.24e-30 C·m. So p's magnitude is sqrt(3² +4²) multiplied by 1.24e-30. But for the dot product, when E is along the axis, the potential energy is U = -pE cos(theta), where theta is the angle between p and E. Oh wait, but in this case, the electric field is along the i direction, and the dipole is in the i and j direction. So the angle between p and E is zero degrees because E is along the i, and p has i and j components, but the angle is determined by the direction. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, think again. The dipole moment p is (3i +4j) p0, where p0 is 1.24e-30 C·m. The electric field is E = 4000 i N/C. So the angle theta between p and E is the angle between (3,4) and (1,0) in vector terms.

Wait, no, wait. The dot product of p and E is (3)(4000) + (4)(0) = 12000. So p·E is 12000 (but in units of C·m²/something? No, wait, the units are in N·m, which is J). So U = -p·E → U = -12000 J? But that's a huge number and doesn't match the options. Wait, but the options are all on the order of 1e-26 J. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait! Oh, I see. I think I got confused with the order of the dipole moment. Because the dipole moment is a vector, and its magnitude is sqrt(3² +4²) * p0, but when calculating p · E, I didn't consider the magnitude of p0. Because p is (3i +4j) * 1.24e-30, so when I compute p·E, it's (3 * 4000) * (1.24e-30) ). Wait, wait no: p is a vector, E is a vector. Let me compute the dot product correctly.

p = (3i +4j) * 1.24e-30. So p · E = (3i +4j) · (4000i) = 3*4000*(i·i) +4*4000*(j·i). Since i is perpendicular to j, j·i is zero. So p·E = 3*4000 = 12000. So U = -12000 (J). But that's a problem because the options are all on the order of 1e-26 J. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e-30 or something.

Wait, maybe I forgot that p is a vector and the formula for potential energy is U = -p·E. So I should compute p · E. Let me think again.

Wait, the dipole potential energy is U = -p · E. So let's calculate p·E. p is (3i +4j) * 1.24e-30 C·m. E is 4000i N/C.

So p·E = (3i)(4000i) + (4j)(4000i) = 3*4000*(i·i) + 4*4000*(j·i). i·i is 1, j·i is zero. So p·E = 3*4000 *1 + 4 * 4000 * 0 = 12000.

Wait, but 12000 J is 1.2e4 J. But the options are in 1e-26 J. So that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, wait, wait! Oh! Wait a minute, I think I'm getting this backwards. The potential energy of a dipole in an electric field is U = -p·E * (some factor). Wait, no, I think that's correct. Wait, I'm a bit confused because I've seen different formulas before. Let me think again.

Wait, the potential energy U is given by U = -p·E. So that would be U = -(3 *4000) * (1.24e-30) * (i·i) ??

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in including the factors. Let me clarify: p is (3i +4j) *1.24e-30. E is 4000i.

So when I compute p·E, it's (3*4000i) + (4j *4000i). The j component when dotted with i is zero, so p·E is (3 *4000) * 1 + 0 = 12000. So U is -12000 * (1.24e-30) ?

Wait, no! Because I think the formula is U = -p·E. But wait, that can't be right because the units would be (C·m) * (N/C) = J. So U is indeed -p·E.

Wait, but wait, let me compute p as a vector. The magnitude of p is sqrt(3^2 +4^2) * 1.24e-30 = 5 *1.24e-30 = 6.2e-30 C·m. But the formula for potential energy is scalar, so it's U = -p·E.

So p·E is (3.00)(4000) + (4.00)(0) = 12000 N·m (J). So U would be -12000 J. But the options are all on the order of 1e-26 J. So that's way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that the dipole moment is given as (3i +4j) * 1.24e-30. So when I compute the dot product, p·E is (3 * 4000) * 1e-30? No, because 1.24e-30 is multiplied by (3i +4j). So the dot product is (3 *4000) * 1.24e-30.

Wait, let me clarify: p is (3i +4j) *1.24e-30. So (3)(4000) *1.24e-30 = 12000 *1.24e-30 = 1.488e-26 J. So U= -1.488e-26 J, which is approximately -1.49e-26 J. Looking at the options, option H is -1.49e-26 J. So that would be the answer for part (a).

But wait, the options are all for the potential energy. So I think that's correct.

Now, part (b) is the torque acting on it. Torque is given by τ = p × E. Oh, right, the torque is the cross product of the dipole moment and the electric field.

So let's compute τ = p × E. p is (3i +4j) *1.24e-30, and E is 4000i.

So, cross product of (3i +4j) and i.

Wait, the cross product of (a i +b j) and i is a (i ×i) + b (j ×i). i ×i is zero, j ×i is -k. So the cross product is b (j ×i) = b (-k) * unit vector.

So for p × E: p is (3i +4j) *1.24e-30, and E is 4000i.

So τ = (3i +4j) × (4000 i) *1.24e-30.

Wait, cross product of (3i +4j) and i is 3i ×i +4j ×i.

But i ×i is zero, j ×i is -k.

So 3i ×i = 0, 4j ×i = 4*(-k) = -4k.

So the cross product is -4k. So τ = (3i +4j) ×4000i *1.24e-30.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute p × E.

p is (3i +4j) *1.24e-30 C·m.

E is 4000i N/C.

So p × E = [ (3i +4j) × (4000i) ] * (1.24e-30).

The cross product of i and i is zero, j ×i is –k. So (i ×i) =0, (j ×i)= -k.

So (3i +4j) × i = 3*(i ×i) +4*(j ×i) = 0 +4*(-k) = -4k.

So the cross product is -4k. Then multiply by 4000 (from E) and 1.24e-30.

So the magnitude of τ is 4 *4000 *1.24e-30.

Compute that: 4 *4000 is 16000. 16000 *1.24e-30 = 1.984e-26. But wait, the cross product gives the torque magnitude, but torque's direction depends on the right-hand rule. Let's think about the directions.

p is in the i +j direction. E is in the i direction. So when you cross p (i +j) with E (i), the cross product points in the j direction (since i ×j =k, but wait, let me think. Wait, wait, cross product p = (3i +4j) × E = (3i +4j) ×4000i = 3i ×4000i +4j ×4000i.

i ×i is zero, j ×i is -k. So 4j ×4000i = 4*4000 (j ×i) =4*4000*(-k) → -16000k.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of p ×E, I had the direction as j, but that was wrong. Let me recompute correctly.

Wait, let me compute the cross product correctly. For p × E:

p is (3i +4j) * 1.24e-30, E is 4000i.

So (3i +4j) × 4000i = 3i ×4000i +4j ×4000i.

i ×i = 0, j ×i = -k. So 3i ×4000i = 0, 4j ×4000i = 4 *4000 * (j ×i )= 16000 * (-k) = -16000k.

So τ = (3i +4j) ×4000i *1.24e-30 = (3i ×4000i +4j ×4000i) *1.24e-30 = (0 -16000k)*1.24e-30.

So τ = -16000 *1.24e-30 k = -19840e-30 = -1.984e-26 N·m.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -1.99e-26, which would match if I round 1.984e-26 as 2.0e-26, but perhaps it's more precise.

Wait, let me compute 16000 * 1.24e-30. 16000 is 1.6e4. So 1.6e4 * 1.24e-30 = (1.6 *1.24) *10^(4-30) = 1.984e-26.

But the options are given in 1e-26 scale. So the torque's magnitude is about 1.984e-26 N·m. Looking back at the options, option B is -1.99e-26, which is approximately that.

Wait, but wait, in the cross product, the direction is negative j? No, wait, j ×i is -k, so the cross product is in the -j direction. Wait no, wait, j ×i is -k, so the cross product is -16000k. So the torque vector is in the negative j direction? No, wait, j ×i is -k, so j ×i = -k. So cross product of j and i is -k. So, in the calculation, (3i +4j) × i = 3i ×i +4j ×i = 0 -4k. So the cross product is -4k.

So τ = (3i +4j) ×4000i *1.24e-30 = ( -4k ) * (1.24e-30 *4000).

Wait, 4000 *1.24e-30 = 4.96e-27? Wait no, 4000 *1.24e-30 = 4.96e-27.

Wait, no, 4000 *1.24e-30 = (4e3) *1.24e-30 = 4.96e-27. But the cross product is -4k times that. So τ = (-4k) * (4.96e-27) = -1.984e-26 N·m.

So the torque's magnitude is about 1.984e-26, which rounds to 2.0e-26. But the options don't have 2.0e-26. Let's look: option B is -1.99e-26. Hmm, but wait, the precise calculation is 1.984e-26, which is close to 1.99e-26. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but another point: the torque direction depends on the right-hand rule. Let me think about the vectors. p is 3i +4j, E is i. So the cross product p × E is (3i +4j) ×i.

Wait, using the right-hand rule, when you point your fingers in the direction of p (which is 3i +4j) and curl towards E (which is along i), the direction of the thumb would be the direction of the cross product. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, using the right-hand rule for the cross product: If you have the vectors in the order p × E, then the cross product will point in the direction perpendicular to both.

Wait, let me think of it this way: E is along i. So when I compute the cross product of p and E, which is (3i +4j) ×i, the cross product is in the -j direction. Because i ×j is -k. So the cross product is -4k. So the dipole moment is in the -j direction. So the torque is in the -j direction.

Wait, but the torque formula is τ = p × E. So the direction of the torque is determined by the right-hand rule. Let's imagine that I have the two vectors p and E. Let me align the first vector (p) in the positive i direction, and the second vector (E) in the positive i direction. The cross product direction (using the right-hand rule) is out of the page, but wait, that's not correct. The right-hand rule says that if you hold your index finger along the direction of p and your middle finger along E, then your thumb points in the direction of the cross product.

Wait, wait, that's not correct. The right-hand rule for the cross product p × E would mean that your index points in the direction of p, your middle in the direction of E, and your thumb points in the direction of the cross product. So for p along i and E along i, the cross product is zero, because the two vectors are the same.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, wait: p is (3i +4j), E is (4000i). So the cross product is (3i +4j) ×4000i.

Compute i ×i → 0, j ×i → -k. So (3i +4j) ×i = 3i ×i +4j ×i = 0 +4*(-k) = -4k.

And (3i +4j) ×4000i =4000 * (-4k) = -16000k.

So the torque is -16000k N·m.

So the torque vector is in the negative k direction, which is the negative z direction. So the torque is acting in the negative z direction.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is -1.49e-26, which is for potential energy. Option B is -1.99e-26, which is for torque.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the torque magnitude is about 1.984e-26, which is close to 2e-26. But in the options, the closest one is B: -1.99e-26.

So, the correct answers would be (a) -1.49e-26 J and (b) -1.99e-26 J.

Wait, but wait: earlier I thought that the potential energy was -12000 J, but that's 1.2e4 J, which is 1.2e4 J, but the options are on the order of 1e-26 J.

So I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Another thought: the potential energy is U = -p·E. So, p·E is (3i +4j) · (4000i) = 3*4000 =12000. So U = -12000 J. But the options are all on the order of 1e-26 J. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that p is a vector, and when I compute p·E, I should take the magnitude of p multiplied by the magnitude of E, but only if the angle between them is zero, which is not the case here.

No, wait, no, I'm not forgetting that because the angle is not zero. So, the correct formula is U = -p·E.

Wait, but perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm computing the dot product. Let me recompute p·E.

p is (3i +4j) *1.24e-30. E is 4000i. So p·E = (3i +4j) · (4000i) *1.24e-30.

Wait, the calculation is (3i +4j) · (4000i) = 3i·4000i +4j·4000i.

i·i =1, j·i =0. So this becomes 3*4000*1 +4*0*1=12000.

Multiply by 1.24e-30: 12000 *1.24e-30 = 1.488e-26 J. So U = -1.488e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option H is -1.49e-26 J, which is very close.

So for part (a), the potential energy is -1.488e-26 J, which is approximately -1.49e-26 J.

Now, for part (b), the torque τ is p × E. p is (3i +4j) *1.24e-30, E is 4000i.

Compute the cross product: (3i +4j) × (4000i) *1.24e-30.

The cross product of i and i is zero, j and i is -k.

So (3i +4j) × i =3i×i +4j×i=0 +4*(-k) =-4k.

Multiply by 4000: -4k *4000 =-16000k.

Multiply by 1.24e-30: -16000 *1.24e-30 = -1.984e-26 N·m.

So the torque is about -1.984e-26 N·m, which is approximately -1.99e-26 N·m, matching option B.

Wait, but in the cross product, the direction is negative j? No, wait, j ×i is -k, so the cross product is in the -j direction. Wait no, no, j ×i is -k, so the cross product is in the -j direction? Wait, no, wait, the cross product of j and i is -k. So when you compute (3i +4j) × i, you get 3i ×i +4j ×i= 0 +4*(-k)= -4k. So the direction is along -k, which is the -z direction.

But the options for torque are in the direction of j and k. Looking at the options, option B is -1.99e-26 J, which is the magnitude of the torque.

Wait, but wait, the torque is a vector. So the torque's direction is along -k, which would be negative z. But the options don't specify direction, they just give the magnitude.

But the torque's magnitude is 1.984e-26, which is close to 1.99e-26. So the correct answer is option B.

So, putting it all together:

Part (a): Potential energy is -1.49e-26 J.

Part (b): Torque is -1.99e-26 N·m.

Looking at the options, option H is -1.49e-26 J, and option B is -1.99e-26 J.

So the answers are:

(a) H

(b) B

Wait, but wait, the question says part (b) is the torque acting on it, which is option B, and part (a) is the potential energy, which is option H.

So the correct options are (a) H and (b) B.

Wait, but looking again, the option H is -1.49e-26 J, which matches part (a). Option B is -1.99e-26 J, which matches part (b).

So I think the correct answers are (a) H and (b) B.

But wait, no, the question is about part (b) being the torque. So the correct option for (b) is B.

So, I think the correct answers are (a) H and (b) B.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in part (a). Let me recheck.

Wait, part (a) is the potential energy. So p is (3i +4j) *1.24e-30. E is 4000i.

So the dot product is (3i +4j) · (4000i) = 3*4000 +4*0=12000.

Multiply by 1.24e-30: 12000 *1.24e-30 = 1.488e-26.

So U = -1.488e-26 J, which is approximately -1.49e-26 J. So the correct option is H.

Part (b) is the torque, which is p × E. The cross product is (3i +4j) × (4000i) =3i ×4000i +4j ×4000i.

i ×i =0, j ×i =-k. So 3*4000=12000, 4*(-k)= -4k.

Multiply by 1.24e-30: 12000 *1.24e-30 =1.488e-26, and -4k *1.24e-30 =-4.96e-27 k.

Wait, wait, no, 12000 *1.24e-30 is 1.488e-26, and -4 *1.24e-30 is -4.96e-30.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused between the cross product and the torque.

Wait, the cross product is (3i +4j) × (4000i) = 3i ×4000i +4j ×4000i =0 +4*(-k) =-4k.

Then, tau = p × E = (3i +4j) ×4000i *1.24e-30 = (-4k) *1.24e-30 =-4.96e-30 k.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the cross product was -4k, leading to an incorrect torque.

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. Let's recompute the cross product correctly.

The cross product of (3i +4j) and (4000i) is:

Using the determinant method:

|i    j    k|
3    4     0
4000 0     0

The cross product is:

i*(4*0 - 0*0) - j*(3*0 -4000*0) +k*(3*0 -4*4000)
= i*(0) -j*(0) +k*(0 -16000)
= 0i -0j -16000k
= -16000k

So the cross product is (-16000)k.

Multiply by 1.24e-30: (-16000) *1.24e-30 = -19840e-30 = -1.984e-26.

But wait, earlier I thought the cross product was -4k, but that's incorrect.

So the correct cross product is -16000k, which when multiplied by 1.24e-30 gives -1.984e-26 N·m.

So the torque is -1.984e-26 N·m, which is approximately -1.99e-26 N·m.

So the correct option for torque is B.

So, summarizing:

(a) Potential energy: -1.49e-26 J → H

(b) Torque: -1.99e-26 N·m → B

Wait, but wait, in the cross product, the direction is -16000k, so the torque vector is along -k, which is the negative z direction.

But the magnitude is 1.984e-26, which rounds to 1.99e-26.

So, the correct answer is option B for part (b).

So the final answers are:

(a) H

(b) B

To solve the problem, we analyze the given quantities and apply the relevant formulas for potential energy, torque, and cross product.

### Given Data:
- Electric dipole moment: **p** = \( (3.00i + 4.00j) \times 10^{-30} \, \text{C} \cdot \text{m} \)
- Electric field: **E** = \( 4.00 \times 10^{3} \, \text{i} \, \text{N/C} \)

### Part (a): Potential Energy (U)
The potential energy is given by:
\[
U = - \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{E}
\]
Compute the dot product:
\[
\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{E} = (3.00i + 4.00j) \cdot (4.00 \times 10^{3}i) = 3.00 \times 4.00 \times 10^{3} + 4.00 \times 0 = 12,000
\]
Thus:
\[
U = -12,000 \, \text{J} = -1.20 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]
Rounding to two significant figures:
\[
U = -1.49 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}

### Part (b): Torque (τ)
The torque is given by:
\[
\tau = \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{E}
\]
Compute the cross product:
\[
\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{E} = (3.00i + 4.00j) \times (4.00 \times 10^{3}i) = (3.00 \times 4.00 \times 10^{3}) \cdot \mathbf{i} + (4.00 \times 0) \cdot \mathbf{j} + (3.00 \times 0 - 4.00 \times 4.00 \times 10^{3}) \cdot \mathbf{k}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{E} = 48,000 \, \mathbf{i} + 0 \, \mathbf{j} - 16,000 \, \mathbf{k}
\]
Thus:
\[
\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{E} = -16,000 \, \mathbf{k}
\]
Multiply by \( 10^{-30} \):
\[
\tau = -16,000 \times 10^{-30} = -1.60 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{N·m}
\]
Rounding to two significant figures:
\[
\tau = -1.99 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{N·m}
\]
