Question:

Two pumping systems are being considered for use on a project. The gasoline pump will cost $3,500, has a 6 year life year, and a $500 salvage value. Annual operating and repair costs would be $2,000 the first year, and would rise $300 each succeeding year. The electric pumping system costs $12,000, has a life of 6 years and a salvage value of $1,000. Annual operating and maintenance costs would be $1,000 the first year, and would rise $150 each year. If the current interest rate is 10%, compare the equivalent annual costs of the two pumping systems. Assume all maintenance and repair costs are paid at the end of each year.

Options:

A: The electric pump has higher initial cost but lower overall cost due to lower maintenance
B: Both pumps have the same costs
C: Both pumps have variable costs that depend on the price of fuel and electricity
D: The gasoline pump is more economical by $200 annually
E: The costs vary each year, making one more economical than the other in different years
F: The gasoline pump is more economical
G: The gasoline pump has a better salvage value, making it more economical
H: The costs cannot be compared
I: The electric pump is more economical
J: The electric pump is more economical by $500 annually

Okay, so I've got this question about two pumping systems and I need to figure out which one is more economical. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when comparing systems, we usually look at their equivalent annual cost (EAC), which accounts for the time value of money. So I need to calculate the EAC for both the gasoline pump and the electric pump using the given interest rate of 10%.

First, the gasoline pump. It costs $3,500 initially. It has a 6-year life and a salvage value of $500. The operating costs start at $2,000 in the first year and increase by $300 each year. Oh wait, so it's an arithmetic gradient in the operating costs. Right, the formula for the present value of an arithmetic gradient in the annuity is something like P = G * (n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 - n(n+1)/2) ) / (i(1+i)^n - 1). Hmm, I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Oh wait, another approach: the present value of each year's operating cost can be calculated as a series of increasing payments. 

So the initial cost is $3,500. The annual operating costs are $2k in year 1, then $2.3k in year 2, ..., up to $2k + 300*(5) = $2k + $1.5k = $3.5k in year 6. The salvage value is $500 at the end of year 6.

The electric pump costs $12,000 now, has a 6-year life, and a salvage value of $1,000. The operating costs start at $1k in year 1, increasing by $150 each year. So year 1: $1k, year 2: $1.15k, ..., up to year 6: $1k + 150*5 = $1k + $750 = $1.75k.

To find the equivalent annual cost, I need to compute the present value of all these costs and then convert that to an annual cost using the annuity formula.

Let me start with the gasoline pump.

Gasoline system:
Initial cost: $3,500.

Operating costs: 
Year 1: $2k
Year 2: $2.3k
Year 3: $2.6k
Year 4: $2.9k
Year 5: $3.2k
Year 6: $3.5k

Salvage value: $500.

The present value (PV) of the operating costs is the sum of each year's cost discounted by (1/(1.1)^n) where n is the year.

Alternatively, using the formula for the present value of an arithmetic gradient series. The formula for the present value of a gradient is:

P = G * [ (n(n+1)(2n+1)/6) - (n(n+1)/2) ) ] / (i(1+i)^n - 1) )

Where G is the annual gradient, i is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute each cash flow separately.

Let me compute each operating cost and its present value.

Year 1: $2k * (1/1.1) = 2000 * 0.90909 = approx $1818.18
Year 2: 2.3k * (1/1.1^2) = 2300 * (1/1.21) ≈ 2300 * 0.8264 ≈ 1900.72
Year 3: 2.6k * (1/1.1^3) ≈ 2600 * 0.7513 ≈ 1953.38
Year 4: 2.9k * (1/1.1^4) ≈ 2900 * 0.6830 ≈ 2000.70
Year 5: 3.2k * (1/1.1^5) ≈ 3200 * 0.6209 ≈ 1987.08
Year 6: 3.5k * (1/1.1^6) ≈ 3500 * 0.5645 ≈ 1975.75

Summing these up: 1818.18 + 1900.72 = 3718.90; plus 1953.38 → 5672.28; +2000.70 → 7672.98; +1987.08 → 9660.06; +1975.75 → 11635.81.

So total PV of operating costs is approximately $11,635.81.

Now the initial cost is $3,500. So the total present value for the gasoline pump is 3500 + 11635.81 = 15135.81.

Now the salvage value is $500 at year 6. So that's a cash inflow of $500 in year 6. The present value is 500 / (1.1^6) → 500 / 1.77156 → approx $282.94.

So the total PV for gasoline is 15135.81 + 282.94 = 15418.75.

Now, to find the EAC, we divide this PV by the present value annuity factor for 6 years at 10%. The annuity factor is (1 - (1/1.1^6 )) / 0.1.

Compute 1.1^6: 1.771561. So 1/1.771561 ≈ 0.56447. So 1 - 0.56447 = 0.43553. Divided by 0.1 → 4.3553.

So EAC = 15418.75 / 4.3553 ≈ let me compute that.

4.3553 * 3540 ≈ let's see: 4.3553 * 3500 = approx 15243.55. Hmm, because 4 * 3500 is 14000, and 0.3553 *3500 is about 1243.55, so total 15243.55. 

But 15418.75 is a bit higher. So 3540 would give 15243.55. The difference is 15418.75 - 15243.55 = 175.2. So 175.2 / 4.3553 ≈ approx 40.33. So total EAC is 3540 + 40.33 ≈ 3580.33.

So EAC for gasoline is approximately $3,580.33.

Now, the electric pump.

Electric system:
Initial cost: $12,000.
Operating costs:
Year 1: 1k
Year 2: 1.15k
Year 3: 1.3k
Year 4: 1.45k
Year 5: 1.6k
Year 6: 1.75k
Salvage value: $1k.

So the present value of the operating costs is each year's cost divided by (1.1^n).

Compute each year's PV:

Year 1: 1k * 0.9091 → approx 909.09
Year 2: 1.15k * 0.8264 → 1.15 * 0.8264 = 0.95, so 1150 * 0.8264 → 950 *0.8264 ≈ 788.24 → 1150 * 0.8264 → let's compute 1150 * 0.8264:

0.8264 * 1000 = 826.4 → 0.8264 * 150 = 123.96 → total 826.4+123.96 = 950.36 → so 950.36 k? Wait no, wait 1.15k is 1150. So 1150 * 0.8264 = 950.36.

Wait, 1.15k is 1150. So 1150 * 0.8264 = 950.36.

Year 3: 1.3k * 0.7513 → 1300 * 0.7513 = approx 976.69.

Year 4: 1.45k * 0.6830 → 1450 * 0.683 → approx 1000. (Wait, 0.683 is approximately 0.683, so 1450 * 0.683 = let me compute 1450 * 0.6 = 870; 1450 * 0.083= 120. So 870+120=990.)

Year 5: 1.6k * 0.6209 → 1600 *0.6209 = 1600 *0.6=960, 1600 *0.0209=33.44 → total 993.44.

Year 6: 1.75k * 0.5645 → 1750 * 0.5645. Let's compute:

0.5645 *1000 = 564.5 → 0.5645 *750 = 423.375 → total 564.5 +423.375 = 987.875.

So the operating cost PVs are:

909.09, 950.36, 976.69, 990, 993.44, 987.875.

Summing them up:

909.09 + 950.36 = 1859.45 → +976.69 = 2836.14 → +990 → 3826.14 → +993.44 → 4819.58 → +987.875 → 5807.455.

So the present value of operating costs is approximately $5,807.46.

Plus the initial cost of $12,000, the total PV is 12,000 + 5807.46 = 17807.46.

Now, subtract the present value of the salvage value at year 6.

Salvage value is $1k, so PV is 1000 / 1.1^6 = 1000 / 1.77156 ≈ approx 564.47.

So the total PV for electric pump is 17807.46 - 564.47 = 17243.0.

Now, we need to find the EAC. The present value is 17,243.0, and the annuity factor is (1 - (1/1.1^6))/0.1 = same as before, which is 4.3553.

So EAC = 17243.0 / 4.3553 ≈ let me compute this.

4.3553 * 4000 = approx 17421.2.

Wait, 4.3553 * 4000 = 17421.2. Our PV is 17243.0, which is slightly less.

So 4000 * 4.3553 = 17421.2. Our PV is 17243, which is 17421.2 - 17243.0 = 178.2 less.

So each $1 in EAC reduces the PV by 4.3553. So to get 17243, we need to find how much over 4000 the EAC is.

Wait, perhaps this is better: 17243.0 /4.3553 ≈ 17243 /4.3553 ≈ let me compute:

4.3553 * 4000 =17421.2 → which is higher than 17243. So 4000 - (17421.2 -17243)/4.3553 → (17421.2 -17243) = 178.2 → 178.2 /4.3553 ≈ ~41.18.

So EAC is 4000 - 41.18 ≈ 3958.82 dollars.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, I can think of it as 17243.0 divided by 4.3553.

Let me compute 4.3553 * 3958 = ?

But maybe it's easier to compute 17243 /4.3553 ≈ let me compute:

Well, 4.3553 * 3958 = ?

But perhaps a better way: 4.3553 * 3958.

Wait, but this is getting a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should use calculator-like steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate 17243 /4.3553. Let me compute 17243 ÷4.3553.

Let me try to approximate. 4.3553 * 3958 = 4 *3958=15832; 0.3553 *3958 ≈ about 1400. So total approx 17232, which is close to 17243. So EAC is approximately 3958.82.

So EAC for electric pump is about $3,958.82.

Now, compare the EACs:

Gas: ~$3,580.33

Elec: ~$3,958.82

So the gasoline pump has a lower equivalent annual cost, which would make it more economical. So the correct answer would be option A: The gasoline pump has a lower initial cost but lower maintenance. Wait, but that's the initial cost, but EAC is lower.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, for the gasoline pump, the EAC is approximately $3,580, which is lower than the electric pump's ~$3,958.82. So the gasoline pump is more economical.

Looking back at the options:

A: The gasoline pump has higher initial cost but lower overall cost due to lower maintenance.

Wait, the initial cost for gas is $3,500, electric is $12,000. So gas's initial cost is lower. But the EAC is lower than electric's. So the gas is more economical.

So the correct statement is option A: The gasoline pump has a higher initial cost but lower overall cost due to lower maintenance.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The gas system has an initial cost of $3,500, electric is 12k. So gas's initial cost is lower. Its EAC is ~3,580, which is less than 3,958. So gas is more economical.

So the correct answer is A: The gasoline pump has a higher initial cost but lower overall cost due to lower maintenance.

Wait, but wait. The gasoline's initial cost is $3,500, which is less than the electric's $12k. So the EAC is lower than electric's, which is because the electric's EAC is higher due to higher maintenance.

So the gasoline pump is more economical.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but the options are:

A: The gasoline pump has higher initial cost but lower overall cost due to lower maintenance.

Wait, no. Because the gas's initial cost is lower, but the EAC is lower than electric's, so the gas is more economical.

So the correct answer is A.

To compare the equivalent annual costs (EAC) of the two pumping systems, we calculate the present value (PV) of each system's costs and then convert that PV to an annual cost using the annuity formula.
