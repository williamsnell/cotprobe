Okay, so I have this question about John Hobbes' philosophy, specifically about the state of war and the rights of the individuals involved. I remember that Hobbes was part of a school of thought called rationalism, which emphasizes reason and individual freedoms over the government. His main goal was to create a perfect state where everyone is equal and there's no oppression.

The question asks what each individual has a right to when everyone is in a state of war. The options are various rights like due process, property, self-defense, etc. I think I need to recall what Hobbes considered as the fundamental rights of the individual.

From what I remember, Hobbes talked a lot about the individual rights. He believed that each person should have the right to self-defense, which is the ability to take out a bullet to protect oneself. He also thought about the right to life and liberty, which he considered fundamental. But looking at the options, the closest one is self-defense, which might be option C.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The question is about the condition of the man in a state of war, so all individuals are in conflict. Hobbes might have thought that everyone has a right to defend themselves, which is self-defense. So the answer should be C: self-defense.

Looking at the options again, I don't recall any option that directly states self-defense except for option C. The other options like due process (A) or property (B) are more related to the state of war and the government's role, not the individual rights.

So I think the correct answer is C: self-defense.

The correct answer is C: self-defense. Hobbes emphasized individual rights, and self-defense is a fundamental principle, aligning with option C.

Answer: C
