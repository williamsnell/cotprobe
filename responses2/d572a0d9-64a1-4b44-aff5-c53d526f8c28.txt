Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have two Boolean random variables, A and B. The probabilities given are P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/3, and P(A | ¬B) = 1/4. We need to find P(A | B).

Hmm. So, I remember that conditional probability is involved here. The formula for conditional probability is P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Similarly, P(A | ¬B) = P(A ∩ ¬B) / P(¬B). So maybe I can use these to find P(A ∩ B) or P(A ∩ ¬B), and then combine them to find P(A | B).

Let me break it down. First, let's find P(¬B). Since P(B) is 1/3, then P(¬B) must be 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.

Now, according to the given, P(A | ¬B) = 1/4. Using the conditional probability formula, that's equal to P(A ∩ ¬B) / P(¬B). So, 1/4 = P(A ∩ ¬B) / (2/3). Let me solve for P(A ∩ ¬B). Multiply both sides by (2/3): P(A ∩ ¬B) = (1/4) * (2/3) = 2/12 = 1/6.

So, we now have P(A ∩ ¬B) = 1/6. Now, since we know P(A), which is 1/2, and P(A) can be expressed as the sum of P(A ∩ B) and P(A ∩ ¬B), we can find P(A ∩ B).

So, P(A) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ ¬B). Plugging in the known values: 1/2 = P(A ∩ B) + 1/6. Let's solve for P(A ∩ B): subtract 1/6 from both sides. 1/2 is 3/6, so 3/6 - 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So, P(A ∩ B) = 1/3.

Now, using the conditional probability formula again, P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). We have P(A ∩ B) = 1/3 and P(B) = 1/3. So, 1/3 divided by 1/3 is 1. So, P(A | B) is 1.

Wait, let me double-check that. If P(B) is 1/3, and P(A ∩ B) is also 1/3, that would mean that whenever B is true, A is always true. So, P(A | B) is 1, which makes sense because if B happens, A must happen. That seems right.

So, looking at the options, option D is 1. So the answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: 1.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. **Given Probabilities:** P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/3, P(A | ¬B) = 1/4.

2. **Calculate P(¬B):** Since P(B) = 1/3, P(¬B) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.

3. **Find P(A ∩ ¬B) using Conditional Probability:**
   P(A | ¬B) = P(A ∩ ¬B) / P(¬B) → 1/4 = P(A ∩ ¬B) / (2/3).  
   Solving gives P(A ∩ ¬B) = (1/4) * (2/3) = 1/6.

4. **Find P(A ∩ B):**  
   P(A) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ ¬B) → 1/2 = P(A ∩ B) + 1/6 → P(A ∩ B) = 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3.

5. **Calculate P(A | B):**  
   P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = (1/3) / (1/3) = 1.

Thus, the answer is D: 1.
