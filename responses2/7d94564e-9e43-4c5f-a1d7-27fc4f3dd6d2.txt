Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Augustine's views on academic skepticism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that Augustine was an early Christian philosopher, and he wrote a lot about the nature of knowledge and belief. The question is about his stance on academic skepticism. Wait, what's academic skepticism? From what I recall, it's the belief that knowledge is not absolute or unassailable, especially in the realm of academia. So people might doubt what they already know, thinking maybe they can't be certain.

Now, Augustine's view. I think he was critical of the scholastic tradition. The scholastics believed in a belief in God and in a hierarchy of knowledge. They thought that knowledge is certain because it's based on reason and dogma. Augustine, on the other hand, attacked this. He thought that belief in God and the certainty of knowledge are not self-evident. So he argued that people can't be completely sure about their beliefs because they rely on faith and prior assumptions, which might not be as certain as they think.

Looking at the options, the question is about what Augustine claims. The options are about whether he considers these beliefs true or not, and whether they can be refuted.

Option A: Neither true nor false, and cannot be proven. So Augustine thinks his beliefs are not true and can't be proven. That makes sense because he's saying his faith can't be absolutely certain.

Option B: Neither true nor false but can be refuted. Wait, that's different. If it's neither, then it can't be refuted either. But Augustine's argument probably doesn't support that. He probably thinks it's true, but can't be proven, so it's not refutable. So B might not be correct.

Option C: False and can be refuted. That seems contradictory. If he claims his beliefs are false, they can still be refuted. But I think he's not saying they are false. He's more likely saying they're uncertain and can't be proven.

Option D: False but cannot be refuted. Again, I think he's not claiming they're false. He's just saying his belief in God and knowledge isn't certain. So this might not fit.

Option E: True, can be proven. No, that's opposite. He's not believing his beliefs are certain. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: True but can be refuted. That doesn't fit with his view either. He's more likely claiming he can't be proven, so refuting isn't his main point.

Option G: False but can be refuted. I'm not sure about this. I thought he was critical of scholasticism, so maybe he's saying his faith isn't proven, but he might not be considering refuting his own beliefs. Or perhaps he believes his faith is true but can't be proven. So maybe he isn't saying his beliefs are false, just that they can't be proven.

Option H: True and can be refuted. No, I don't think so. He's claiming his beliefs are not certain, not necessarily true.

Option I: True and can be refuted. Again, probably not. He's not saying they're true, just that they're uncertain.

Option J: True and cannot be refuted. That would mean he's certain, which isn't the case. He's skeptical.

Wait, so going back, the question is about what Augustine claims. So I think he says that his beliefs are not true and can't be proven, meaning they're uncertain. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let me make sure. The options are:

A: neither, can't be proven.

So the correct answer is A.

The correct answer is A: is neither true nor false, and cannot be proven.

**Answer: A**
