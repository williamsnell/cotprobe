Okay, so I've got this question here asking which traits are affected by more than one gene. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember from my genetics class that genes are the units of heredity, and each gene contributes to the traits of an organism.

The question lists several options: A to J. I need to find out which ones are affected by multiple genes. Let's break them down one by one.

Option A: Heterozygous traits. Wait, heterozygous means having two different alleles for a gene. I don't think this refers to the number of genes affecting a trait. It's more about the presence of two different forms of the same gene. So probably not the answer.

Option B: Mendelian traits. Mendelian refers to traits that follow simple Mendelian genetics, like single gene inheritance. So this is probably affected by just one gene, so probably not the answer.

Option C: Multiple alleles traits. Wait, multiple alleles mean that a gene has more than two forms—like more than two alleles. Oh wait, but each multiple allele refers to the same gene. I'm a bit confused. Like, for example, if a gene has three alleles, then the trait is influenced by multiple alleles. So multiple alleles is a form of multiple gene influence? Or is it just one gene with multiple alleles? I think multiple alleles are a form of a single gene with multiple versions, so each allele contributes. So maybe this is affected by multiple genes? Or maybe not. I'm not sure, but I'll come back to this.

Option D: Polygenic traits. Oh, wait, that's the one I'm pretty sure about. Polygenic traits are those influenced by multiple genes. So each gene contributes separately, and the trait is a combination of all those contributions. So this definitely fits.

Option E: Pleiotropic traits. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Like, a gene might influence height, eye color, and beak size all at once. So this fits the idea of multiple genes affecting a single trait.

Option F: Sex-linked traits. These are traits influenced by genes located on the sex chromosomes, which differ between males and females. For example, in females, the X chromosome is homologous to another X, but in males, the X is only present once. So these traits are influenced by one gene but are expressed differently based on sex. So they're affected by a single gene but expressed in different ways, so they're not multiple genes affecting the trait itself. So this is more about one gene, not more than one.

Option G: Incomplete dominance traits. This is about how alleles interact. If two alleles are present, each contributes to the trait. Like with coat colors in mice. So this is about one gene, not multiple.

Option H: Autosomal traits. These are traits influenced by genes on non-sex chromosomes. Like blood type, which is determined by the ABO system. So they are influenced by one gene, not multiple.

Option I: Codominant traits. This is when two alleles of the same gene are both expressed and are in close proximity. Like the A and B alleles in blood types, where the phenotype is a blend. So this is about a single gene, not multiple.

Option J: Blended alleles. I'm not sure what this refers to. Blending alleles might be a term I'm not familiar with. Maybe it's a term from another context, like blending selection in evolutionary biology. If that's the case, it's about a single gene's alleles. So I'm not sure if this is affected by multiple genes.

So going back, the question is which are affected by more than one gene. Let me reevaluate each option.

A: Heterozygous—no, each has one gene.
B: Mendelian—only one gene.
C: Multiple alleles—usually refers to one gene's multiple alleles, so this is about a single gene.
D: Polygenic—yes, multiple genes contribute.
E: Pleiotropic—single gene affects multiple traits.
F: Sex-linked—single gene, expressed differently.
G: Incomplete dominance—single gene.
H: Autosomal—single gene.
I: Codominant—single gene.
J: Blended alleles—maybe I don't know, but perhaps this refers to something else.

So the correct answers are D, E, and perhaps others? Wait, wait, let me check the options again. The options are A to J, and the question is which are affected by more than one gene.

Looking again:

Which of the following are traits that are affected by more than one gene?

So, the correct options would be D (polygenic), E (pleiotropic), and perhaps another.

Wait, let's think about each:

D: Polygenic traits are influenced by multiple genes—so yes.

E: Pleiotropy is one gene affecting multiple traits.

What about C, which is multiple alleles. Wait, but multiple alleles is a form of a single gene having multiple alleles. So for example, if a gene has three alleles, each has a different effect, but the trait is due to multiple alleles. So perhaps this is not multiple genes but a single gene with multiple alleles. So if the question is about multiple genes, then C would not fit. So only D and E.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about traits affected by more than one gene. So:

- Polygenic: yes, multiple genes.
- Pleiotropic: yes, one gene affecting multiple traits.
- What about C: Multiple alleles are a single gene's effect. So it's one gene, not more than one. So C is not the answer.

So the options are D, E, perhaps another.

Wait, what about the other options?

Option J: Blended alleles—does that refer to a single gene's alleles blending? I don't remember. Blending alleles might refer to a situation where two different alleles (like from different loci) affect the same trait, leading to a blend. But that's still a single gene.

Wait, but I'm not sure about option J. Let me think again. The question is about which are affected by more than one gene. So, the only options that fit are D and E.

Wait, let me check the question again. The options are A-F, so options D and E are possible. Wait, but the initial options in the question are A to J.

Wait, but looking back, the options are A: heterozygous, B: Mendelian, C: multiple alleles, D: polygenic, E: pleiotropic, F: sex-linked, G: incomplete dominance, H: autosomal, I: codominant, J: blended alleles.

So the correct options are D and E.

Wait, but the options given in the question are from A to J, and the question is which of the following are traits... So the answer would be D and E.

Wait, but the question is multiple choice, asking which are traits affected by more than one gene. So in the options, which are correct.

Looking back, the options are each labels. So the correct answers would be D (polygenic), E (pleiotropic), and possibly another.

Let me think again: 

- Polygenic traits (D) are influenced by multiple genes—yes.

- Pleiotropic traits (E) are traits influenced by a single gene through multiple expressions—yes.

What's the question asking? Which are traits that are affected by more than one gene? So these are the options.

So the correct options are D and E. But looking at the provided answer options, the options are A to J.

Wait, the question is asking which are traits that are affected by more than one gene. So the correct ones are D and E.

So the answer should include D and E.

Wait, but the options are given as A through J, and the question is which are the options. So the selection would be D and E.

Wait, but the options are options A through J, and the question is to select which are the correct. So it's a multiple-choice question with options A to J.

Wait, but the way the question is presented, the user wants to select the correct answer from A to J, each being a possible option. So the question is asking which of the options (A-D, etc.) are traits affected by more than one gene.

So in the answer options, the correct answers would be D and E.

But let me look at the options again.

Looking at the answer options, the options are:

A: Heterozygous

B: Mendelian

C: Multiple alleles

D: Polygenic

E: Pleiotropic

F: Sex-linked

G: Incomplete dominance

H: Autosomal

I: Codominant

J: Blended alleles

So the correct answers are D and E. So in the given options, which are these: D and E are correct.

Wait, but the question is, which are the traits (so which statements are correct). So the answer would be options D and E.

But the user probably expects me to choose from the given options, and choose the letters. But the question is phrased as "which of the following are traits that are affected by more than one gene?" So the answer includes D and E.

Wait, but in the options provided, each letter is a possible trait. So the options for the answer is one letter, but wait, no, the options are A to J, and the question is asking which are the correct options.

Wait, no. The user says, "Which of the following are traits that are affected by more than one gene?"

The options are multiple, and the response is to select which letters are correct. So the answer would be options D and E.

But let me think about the options again. Are there any other traits that fit?

Looking at the options:

Option C: Multiple alleles. That's a single gene with multiple alleles. So that's a single gene, so not more than one.

So only D and E are correct.

Wait, but I remember that multiple alleles refers to a single gene having multiple alleles. So if the trait is influenced by multiple alleles of a single gene, then it's not affected by more than one gene. So multiple alleles is one gene with multiple alleles.

So for more than one gene affecting the trait, the options are D and E.

So the correct answers are D and E. So in the options, the letters would be D and E. So the answer would include both D and E.

But the question asks which are the traits, so the correct letters are D and E.

Wait, but the question is presented as a multiple-choice question where the options are A-G, and the user is to select the correct letters. So the answer is D and E.

But wait, looking at the answer options, the options are A to J, and the user is to select which of those are correct.

Wait, but the question is, "Which of the following are traits that are affected by more than one gene?" So the correct options are D and E.

But looking at the options, the only correct answers are D and E.

So in the given answer options, the letters should be D and E.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. It says "which of the following are traits..." So the correct letters would be D and E.

Wait, but the answer format requires selecting one letter. Wait, no, the way it's worded, the options are the letters A to J, and the question is, "Which of the following are..." So the correct answer is the letters that correspond to D and E.

But the user will have to choose from the options A through J, each is a possible letter.

Wait, but the question is in the form of a multiple-choice question, with each option being a trait. The user is to select all correct options, but the way the question is presented, perhaps the user is to choose all that apply, but in the given options, each option is a single letter. Wait, perhaps the question is a list, and the user has to select which letters are correct.

But the way the question is written, the user is to choose which of the following (A-G) are correct. So the correct choices are D and E.

So the answer would be options D and E.

To determine which traits are influenced by more than one gene, let's analyze each option:

- **A: Heterozygous traits**  
  Heterozygous refers to having two different alleles of a gene, but it specifically refers to having one gene.  
- **B: Mendelian traits**  
  Mendelian traits follow simple inheritance patterns, influenced by one gene.  
- **C: Multiple alleles traits**  
  Multiple alleles refer to a single gene being expressed in multiple forms. This is a form of a single gene and not multiple genes.  
- **D: Polygenic traits**  
  Polygenic traits are influenced by multiple genes, which can result in a single trait. This fits the criteria.  
- **E: Pleiotropic traits**  
  Pleiotropy is when a single gene influences multiple traits. This also fits the criteria of being influenced by multiple genes.  
- **F: Sex-linked traits**  
  These traits are influenced by genes on the sex chromosomes (e.g., X and Y), but they are expressed differently based on sex, not multiple genes.  
- **G: Incomplete dominance traits**  
  Incomplete dominance occurs within a single gene's expression and is not influenced by multiple genes.  
- **H: Autosomal traits**  
  Autosomal traits are influenced by genes on non-sex chromosomes, but they are expressed based on a single gene.  
- **I: Codominant traits**  
  Codominant traits are a form of interaction within a single gene's alleles.  
- **J: Blended alleles**  
  This term is not clearly defined and may refer to a single gene's alleles blending, which is not multiple genes.

From the analysis, the traits influenced by more than one gene are **D: Polygenic traits** and **E: Pleiotropic traits**.

ANSWER: D, E
