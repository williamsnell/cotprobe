"Those whose condition is such that their function is the use of their bodies and nothing better can be expected of them, those, I say, are slaves of nature. It is better for them to be ruled thus."
Juan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522
"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolomé de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'"

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about presidents and their involvement in Latin American politics during the twentieth century. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is asking which president from the options given was most involved in Latin American politics in the 20th century. The options are A through J, each representing a different president. I remember the 20th century includes the 1940s and onwards, so I'm looking for a president whose presidency had significant interactions with Latin America.

First, I'll recall the presidents listed. Let me jot down their names and a bit about them.

Option A: Theodore Roosevelt. I know he was a leading figure in the U.S. during the Great Depression and World War II. He was part of the New Deal and played a big role in international relations, especially during the Cold War. I think he was involved with Latin America, but I'm not too sure about the specifics.

Option B: Franklin D. Roosevelt, same as A. So same as above.

Option C: Harry S. Truman. He was the 43rd president. I remember that he was the first U.S. president to come to power in the 1940s. I think he was part of the "Sparta-Francfort" strategy, which included expanding trade and cooperation, which could have touched Latin America. Also, during the 1950s, he was involved in the Vietnam War, but that was more about military and economic aspects. I'm not certain if he directly connected with Latin America much, but the "Sparta-Francfort" approach might have influenced some policies.

Option D: Chester Arthur. He was the 32nd president. I don't remember much about him. He was a consultant to the U.S. government, but I'm not sure if he was involved with Latin America. Not sure about this one.

Option E: Dwight Eisenhower. He was the 46th president. He was part of the "Great Society" campaign, which aimed to modernize the U.S. economy and government. He also supported the Vietnam War. I don't recall him much about Latin American involvement.

Option F: Woodrow Wilson. He was the 19th president. He was involved in international relations, especially the New World Order. He focused on themes like democracy, freedom, and economic development. But I don't think he was much into Latin America.

Option G: James K. Polk. He was the 19th president. He was a strong leader in the Pacific, especially in the Fifth and Sixth Agreements. The Fifth Agreements were on trade and economic cooperation with Latin American countries. The Sixth Agreements were about the French colonial empire. So Polk was involved in Latin America, especially through economic and military cooperation.

Option H: James Monroe. 21st century president, so not relevant here.

Option I: John F. Kennedy. He was the 32nd president. He was involved in immigration and the civil rights movement. I don't think he was much into Latin America.

Option J: Richard Nixon. The 33rd president. Also the 20th century, but he was the vice president. He played a role in the Cold War, especially in the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was involved in some Latin American interactions, but not the most significant ones.

So, focusing back on the options A to J, the candidates are either Trumans (C and B), Polk (G), and possibly others.

Harry S. Truman's involvement with Latin America: The "Sparta-Francfort" strategy in the early 1950s. This strategy involved international cooperation, trade, and military expansion in Latin America. Truman was a key figure in expanding relations with these regions. His role might have been significant in promoting economic and political cooperation with Latin American nations.

Chester Arthur (G) was a consultant, not a president, so he's not in the options.

Wait, the question is about presidents involved in Latin American politics. So Truman and Woodrow Wilson were in the 20th century. But Woodrow Wilson was the 19th, not the 20th, so he's out.

So, between Truman and Polk. Polk was involved in the economic and military cooperation with Latin America, which is a key area. Truman's involvement was more in the strategic approach but also in economic cooperation.

So which was more involved? Both were major players. However, Truman's involvement was more in the strategic aspects of international relations, including Latin America. His policies and actions, like the Fifth and Sixth Agreements, were significant. The economic cooperation with Latin America, especially through the Fifth Agreement, which aimed to boost economic ties, could have been a big part of his involvement.

Wait, but the question is about presidents who were most involved in Latin American politics. So perhaps the answer is Truman, as he was more involved in the strategy and economic aspects. Alternatively, Polk was more involved in the direct economic cooperation with Latin America.

Another thought: Truman's role in the 1950s and 1960s, when Latin America was a major area. He was a leader in developing relationships, which includes Latin America.

Putting it all together:

The options are:

Which president was most involved in Latin American politics in the 20th century? The 20th century includes the 1940s and 1950s. Truman's involvement was in the 1950s, when he was president. He was involved in international policy, particularly economic and military cooperation with Latin America. The Fifth Agreements were a significant part of his strategy.

Polk was a 19th-century president, but he was involved in Latin America in the 19th century through the Fifth and Sixth Agreements.

So between Truman and Polk. But the question is about presidents who were in the 20th century. So Truman was in the 50s, which is within the 20th century.

Wait, the options include J: Richard Nixon, but he was in the 33rd century, so no.

So the answer is either Truman or Polk.

But the question is about presidents who were most involved in Latin American politics. So both were involved, but perhaps Truman was more involved in the strategic aspects and economic cooperation.

Alternatively, another angle: Economic cooperation with Latin America. Truman's involvement in the Fifth and Sixth Agreements was in that area.

So given the options, the correct answer would be Truman, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are only the 20th-century presidents given. So the question is asking which of the listed presidents was most involved in Latin American politics in the 20th century.

Looking at the options, the 20th century includes 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, etc.

Harry S. Truman was the 43rd president. He was involved in the 1950s with international relations, especially the Fifth and Sixth Agreements, which promoted economic cooperation with Latin America.

Chester Arthur was the 32nd president, but he's not in the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are from A to J. So the correct answer is Truman, but the options given are A to J.

Wait, another thought: The question is about the 20th century. So the 43rd president, Truman, was in the 1950s, which is part of the 20th century. So he was involved in Latin America.

So the answer is C: Harry S. Truman.
