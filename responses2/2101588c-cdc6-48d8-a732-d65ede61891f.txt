Okay, so I've got this algebra problem to solve. The expression is 6j² - 4j + 12, and I need to rewrite it in the form c(j + p)² + q. Then, find the value of q divided by p. The answer choices are given from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that rewriting a quadratic in vertex form is useful because it can easily identify the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form is c(j + p)² + q, which is similar to completing the square. So, I should try to complete the square for the given expression.

The original expression is 6j² - 4j + 12. Let me write it down:

6j² - 4j + 12.

I know that to complete the square, the coefficient of j² should be 1, so I think the first step is to factor out the coefficient of j² from the first two terms. Let's try that:

6(j² - (4/6)j) + 12.

Simplifying 4/6 gives me 2/3, so:

6(j² - (2/3)j) + 12.

Now, I need to complete the square inside the parentheses. The formula for completing the square is to take half of the coefficient of j, square it, and add it inside. But since we're adding something inside the parentheses, we have to adjust for the fact that the 6 is factored out.

So, the coefficient of j is -2/3. Half of that is -1/3, and squaring it gives (1/3)² = 1/9. 

But wait, since we're inside the parentheses that's multiplied by 6, adding 1/9 inside is like adding 6*(1/9) = 2/3 to the entire expression. So to keep the value the same, I need to subtract that amount, but it's better to think that I'm adding it inside and then subtracting it outside.

Wait, maybe I should rephrase. Let me take it step by step.

So, inside the parentheses, we have j² - (2/3)j. I want to make this a perfect square trinomial. The perfect square would be (j - 1/3)², because (j - a)² = j² -2a j + a². So, comparing, 2a = 2/3 → a = 1/3. So, the square is (j - 1/3)².

But wait, when I expand (j - 1/3)², I get j² - (2/3)j + 1/9. So, to get from j² - (2/3)j to (j - 1/3)², I need to add 1/9. However, since I'm adding 1/9 inside the parentheses that's multiplied by 6, the total added is 6*(1/9) = 2/3. So, to balance that, I need to subtract 2/3 outside.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Since I added 1/9 inside the parentheses, which is multiplied by 6, that's actually adding 6*(1/9) = 2/3 to the expression. So, to maintain equality, I have to subtract 2/3. Let me write this out:

6(j² - (2/3)j + 1/9) + 12 - 6*(1/9).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

The expression inside the parentheses is j² - (2/3)j. To complete the square, I add (1/9) inside, so I have to subtract the same added value multiplied by 6 to keep the expression equivalent. Alternatively, maybe it's better to factor out the 6 first.

Wait, I think the correct approach is:

Start with 6j² - 4j + 12.

Factor out 6 from the first two terms: 6(j² - (4/6)j) + 12 → which is 6(j² - (2/3)j) + 12.

Now, inside the parentheses, j² - (2/3)j. The coefficient of j is -2/3. Half of that is -1/3, and the square is (1/3)² = 1/9.

So, I add 1/9 inside the parentheses to complete the square. But since it's inside a multiplied by 6, adding 1/9 inside is adding 6*(1/9) = 2/3 to the entire expression. So, to compensate, I must subtract 2/3 outside.

So, the expression becomes:

6(j² - (2/3)j + 1/9) + 12 - 2/3.

Simplify the constants:

12 is 36/3, so 36/3 - 2/3 = 34/3.

So the expression is 6 times (j - 1/3)² plus 34/3.

Wait, let me make sure:

(j - 1/3)² is j² - (2/3)j + 1/9. So, when you factor 6 out, it's 6j² -4j + 6*(1/9) = 6j² -4j + 2/3.

Wait, but our original expression after factoring was 6(j² - (2/3)j) +12. Adding 1/9 inside gives 6*(j² - (2/3)j +1/9) = 6j² -4j + 6*(1/9) = 6j² -4j + 2/3.

But the original expression was 6j² -4j +12. So, when I add 2/3 inside, the total expression becomes 6j² -4j + 2/3. Therefore, to get back to the original expression, I need to subtract 2/3. So yes, the expression becomes:

6(j - 1/3)² + 12 - 2/3.

12 is 36/3, so 36/3 - 2/3 = 34/3.

So, 6(j - 1/3)² + 34/3.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have a fraction as q. Wait, let me check.

Wait, the options are all integers or -11, 0, etc., except for 34/3 is about 11.333, which is not among the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I didn't factor correctly. Let me recheck the completing the square steps.

Original expression: 6j² -4j +12.

Factor out 6 from the first two terms: 6(j² - (4/6)j) +12. So that's 6(j² - (2/3)j) +12.

Now, inside the parentheses, j² - (2/3)j. Coefficient is -2/3. Half of that is -1/3. Squared is 1/9.

So, adding 1/9 inside the parentheses, which, when factored by 6, adds 6*(1/9) = 2/3 to the expression. Thus, to balance, subtract 2/3.

So, the expression becomes 6(j² - (2/3)j + 1/9) +12 - 2/3.

Which becomes 6(j - 1/3)² + (12 - 2/3).

12 is 36/3, so 36/3 - 2/3 = 34/3. So, q is 34/3.

Wait, but the options don't have 34/3 as an option. The options are integers: A is -3, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake because I might have messed up the sign somewhere.

Wait, another way: Let me write the expression as 6(j - p)² + q.

Wait, perhaps I should express it in the form c(j + p)^2 + q. So, it's c*(j + p)^2 + q.

Wait, in the previous step, I have 6(j - 1/3)^2 + 34/3. So, that's 6(j + (-1/3))^2 + 34/3. So, c is 6, p is -1/3, and q is 34/3.

Wait, but the options have 34 as an option, which is option C. But 34/3 is not an option. The options are A: -3, B:38, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the process.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to expand 6(j + p)^2 + q and see if it can match 6j² -4j +12.

Expanding 6(j + p)^2 + q = 6(j² + 2pj + p²) + q = 6j² +12pj +6p² + q.

Comparing to 6j² -4j +12.

So, the coefficients must satisfy:

12p = -4 → p = -4/(12) = -1/3.

Then, 6p² + q = 12.

Compute p squared: (-1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So, 6*(1/9) + q = 12 → 2/3 + q =12 → q =12 -2/3 = 34/3.

Hmm, same result. So, q is 34/3, p is -1/3. So, q/p is (34/3)/(-1/3) = 34/3 * (-3/1) = -34.

So, that would be option H: -34.

Wait, but the options don't have 34/3 as an option, but option H is -34, which is the value we have for q/p.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the question says to rewrite the expression in the form c(j + p)^2 + q, not necessarily with p as a fraction. Wait, but in the options, H is -34, which matches our result.

Wait, but in the options, option H is -34, which is the value of q/p. So, the correct answer should be H: -34.

Wait, but let me make sure that the process I followed is correct. Let me re-derive the steps.

Alternative approach: Let's find p and q such that 6j² -4j +12 = 6(j + p)^2 + q.

Expanding the right-hand side:

6(j² + 2pj + p²) + q = 6j² + 12pj +6p² + q.

Set equal to the left-hand side:

6j² -4j +12 = 6j² +12pj +6p² + q.

Comparing coefficients:

12p = -4 → p = -4/12 = -1/3.

Then, 6p² + q =12.

Compute 6*(1/9) = 2/3. So, 2/3 + q =12 → q = 12 -2/3 =34/3.

Thus, q/p = (34/3)/(-1/3) = 34/3 * (-3/1) = -34.

So, the answer is -34, which is option H.
</think>

The expression is rewritten as \(6(j - 1/3)^2 + 34/3\). Therefore, \(p = -1/3\) and \(q = 34/3\). The ratio \(q/p\) is \(-34\), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
