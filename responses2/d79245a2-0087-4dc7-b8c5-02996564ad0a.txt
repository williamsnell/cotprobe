Okay, so I've got this question here about converting cubic meters to liters. Hmm, I remember that liters and cubic meters are related units, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conversion factor. Let me think.

Wait, I think one cubic meter is a cube that's 1 meter on each side. And a liter is a measure of volume, right? Oh yeah, and I remember that 1 liter is equal to 0.001 cubic meters. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? Let me get this straight.

If 1 cubic meter is 100 centimeters on each side, then the volume would be 100 cm x 100 cm x 100 cm. Wait, that's 1,000,000 cubic centimeters. But wait, 1 liter is 1,000 cubic centimeters. So, 1,000,000 cubic centimeters divided by 1,000 gives 1,000 liters in a cubic meter. Oh wait, no—that's 1,000,000/1,000 = 1,000 liters. So that would mean 1 cubic meter is 1,000 liters. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because I thought 1 liter is less than a cubic decimeter, but maybe I'm mixing units.

Wait, another way: I remember that 1 cubic decimeter is equal to 1 liter. And 1 cubic meter is 10 decimeters on each side, so 10 x 10 x10 = 1,000 cubic decimeters. So, since each cubic decimeter is a liter, that would make 1,000 liters in a cubic meter. So 1 m³ = 1,000 liters.

Looking at the options, option E is 1,000 liters. So the correct answer should be E. But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the units. Sometimes it's easy to get confused between cubic meters and liters.

Wait, another way: 1 liter is 1,000 cm³. So 1 m³ is 1,000,000 cm³. So 1,000,000 divided by 1,000 is 1,000. So yeah, 1 m³ is 1,000 liters. So the answer is E.

The correct answer is E: 1,000 liters. 

Step-by-step explanation:
- 1 cubic meter (m³) is a cube with sides of 1 meter each.
- 1 meter = 100 centimeters, so 1 m³ = 100 cm × 100 cm × 100 cm = 1,000,000 cm³.
- 1 liter is defined as 1,000 cm³.
- Therefore, 1,000,000 cm³ ÷ 1,000 cm³/L = 1,000 liters.
- Correct answer: E (1,000 liters).

Answer: E
