Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a tennis ball. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think this through. Let's start by recalling what I remember.

De Broglie's equation, right. The wavelength λ is equal to h divided by the momentum p. So, λ = h / p. But wait, p is mass multiplied by velocity, so p = m*v. So putting that together, λ = h / (m*v). Got it.

Now, the given data: the mass of the tennis ball is 57 grams. Wait, grams to kilograms. Oh right, I should convert that. 57 grams is 0.057 kilograms, because 1 kg is 1000 grams. So m = 0.057 kg.

The velocity is given as 25 m/s. So v =25 m/s.

Planck's constant h, I think, is a fundamental constant. I remember it's approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s or something like that. Let me check the exact value. Oh yeah, 6.62607015 × 10^-34 m² kg/s, but maybe for this problem, I'll use 6.626e-34.

So plugging the numbers into the formula: λ = h/(m*v). Let's compute that step by step.

First, calculate m*v. So 0.057 kg * 25 m/s. Let me compute that. 0.057 * 25. Let me think, 0.05 *25 is 1.25, and 0.007 *25 is 0.175. So adding them gives 1.25 + 0.175 = 1.425. So m*v = 1.425 kg·m/s.

Now, λ = h / (m*v) → 6.626e-34 / 1.425.

Let me compute that division. 6.626 divided by 1.425. Let me see. 1.425 * 4 is 5.7, which is less than 6.626. 1.425 * 4.6 is about 6.565. Because 1.425 *4 is 5.7, 0.6 *1.425 is 0.855. So 5.7 + 0.855=6.555, which is close to 6.626. The difference is about 0.071. So 1.425 * 0.05 is about 0.07125. Oh, so 4.6 + 0.05 =4.65. So 4.65 *1.425 is approximately 6.626. So 6.626e-34 /1.425 is approximately 4.65e-34 m.

Wait, but let me do the actual division more accurately. 6.626e-34 divided by 1.425. Let me compute 6.626 divided by 1.425.

1.425 times 4 is 5.7. 5.7 is less than 6.626. The difference is 0.926. So 1.425 goes into 0.926 how many times? Let me compute 0.926 /1.425. 1.425 * 0.65 is 0.92625. Oh wait, exactly because 1.425 * (65/100) = 0.92625. So 0.926 is approximately 0.65 *1.425. So 4.65.

So λ is 4.65e-34 meters. Let me look at the options. Let's see the options:

A: 3.0e-32
B:5.5e-33
C:1.2e-30
D:8.9e-36
E:2.3e-30
F:7.2e-31
G:4.7e-34
H:9.3e-35
I:1.5e-35
J:6.1e-33

4.65e-34 is close to option G, which is 4.7e-34. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, double-checking my calculations. Oh, wait another thing. Did I convert grams correctly? The mass was 57 grams, which is 0.057 kg. Yes. Velocity is 25 m/s. Ok. So m*v is 1.425 kg m/s. h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So, 6.626e-34 / 1.425 = let me compute that more accurately.

6.626 ÷ 1.425. Let's see:

1.425 * 4 = 5.7 → 5.7
Subtract from 6.626 → 0.926

Bring down the next digit (but since it's 6.626, we can think of it as 6.626000...), so 0.926000. Now, how many times does 1.425 go into 0.926? It goes 0.65 times because 1.425 * 0.65 = 0.92625. So 4.65 times.

So 4.65e-34 m. So the answer is option G, 4.7e-34.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a tennis ball, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{m \cdot v}
\]

where:
- \( h \) is Planck's constant, approximately \( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),
- \( m \) is the mass of the tennis ball, \( 57 \, \text{g} = 0.057 \, \text{kg} \),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the tennis ball, \( 25 \, \text{m/s} \).

First, calculate the momentum \( p = m \cdot v \):
\[
p = 0.057 \, \text{kg} \cdot 25 \, \text{m/s} = 1.425 \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, substitute into the de Broglie formula:
\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.425}.
\]

Performing the division:
\[
\lambda \approx 4.65 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{m}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is \( 4.7 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option G.
