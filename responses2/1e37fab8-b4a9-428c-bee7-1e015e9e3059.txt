Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this criminal law question. Let me read it again and break it down.

The situation is a young man suggests his friend stealing a large-screen TV from the neighbor's house. The friend gets angry and uses him to get even by having him arrested. The friend helps, and that night, the young man goes to the neighbor's house. The friend calls the police and drives away. When they arrived, the young man was carrying the TV out the door. The question is about what crime the friend can be convicted of if they were acting within the bounds of the common law.

So, what's the common law approach here? Under common law, crimes are based on the rules of the time they were written, not on law enforcement actions. So, the friend's actions were taken to get even, but the TV theft is a separate offense.

The young man broke into the neighbor's house. Stealing a TV is a specific type of theft. If he broke in and took the TV, it's a burglary. Burglary is a crime where you commit theft with the intent to commit a felony. So, the theft of the TV is burglary.

But wait, the friend was helping to get even. Did the friend commit a crime by aiding and abetting the theft? Under common law, aiding and abetting a crime (like burglary) is generally not considered a separate offense. The common law would treat the act of aiding someone else in committing a crime as a separate offense. So, the friend might be charged with conspiracy to commit burglary or something else related.

Wait, but the friend was helping to get even. Did that involve any criminal conduct? Like, was the friend aiding someone else in the theft? The friend called the police and then drove away. The young man broke in and took the TV. The friend didn't commit the theft himself, but they helped him.

Under common law, the friend's actions were aiding and abetting the theft. But in that case, aiding and abetting a crime isn't considered a separate crime. So, the friend would not be charged with burglary or any related crime because it's not aiding the crime itself.

Wait, but the friend was present when the theft occurred. Did the friend commit the theft? No, because the young man was the one who took it. So, the theft was done by the young man, but the friend was assisting in that act.

So, the friend's actions were aiding and abetting the theft. But under common law, aiding and abetting a crime is not a separate offense. So the friend wouldn't be charged with any crime related to the theft because it wasn't the friend's intent to commit it. The friend's actions were more about helping to get even rather than aiding the theft itself.

Alternatively, maybe the friend's actions were considered a separate offense. Wait, but in criminal law, the friend's actions were actions taken to commit the theft, and the friend's intent was to help, not to commit the crime. So under common law, the friend's actions wouldn't be considered a separate offense. That is, the friend didn't commit the theft; he helped someone else.

So, the friend's actions didn't involve any crime because the crime was committed by the young man, and the friend was aiding him but not the crime itself.

Looking at the options: the possible choices are A (no crime), H (attempted larceny), and others like B, etc.

Wait, option H is attempted larceny. That's a type of burglary. But under common law, attempting a felony is not a separate crime. So, H wouldn't be charged.

Option B is conspiracy and larceny. But the friend didn't commit the theft himself. He was just helping. So, the friend did something to get even, but it wasn't the theft itself.

So, the friend's actions would not constitute a separate crime. The only possible option is A: No crime. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the friend's actions were considered a separate offense because he was aiding and abetting the theft, but under common law, it's not.

Wait, another angle: the friend might be considered aiding and abetting the theft, but the crime is theft, which is a separate offense. So, the friend's actions were aiding and abetting the theft. But in common law, aiding and abetting a crime isn't a separate offense. So, the friend isn't charged with any crime because the crime was done by someone else.

So the answer would be A: No crime.

Alternatively, maybe the friend's actions were considered a separate offense. But under common law, they aren't. The common law wouldn't hold the friend responsible for the theft unless the friend's actions directly contributed to the crime. Since the friend helped but didn't commit it, they aren't liable.

So, the correct answer is A: No crime.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the friend can be convicted of any crime for aiding and abetting the theft of a large-screen TV. Under common law, crimes are based on the rules of the time they were established, not on law enforcement actions. The theft of the TV itself is a burglary, as it involves the intent to commit a felony. 

The friend's actions were taken to get even and helped the young man into the house. While aiding and abetting a crime under common law is not considered a separate offense, the friend's actions were not the theft itself. The theft was committed by the young man, not the friend. Therefore, the friend did not commit any crime and was not liable for any related offense.

The correct answer is:

**A: No crime.**
