Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about boiling points and colligative properties. I've studied a bit about this before, so I'll try to think it through.

The question says ethanol boils at 78.5°C. Wait, I remember that when you dissolve a solute in a solvent, the boiling point increases. That's the colligative property. The solute affects the boiling point based on its molality.

So, the problem gives me 10 grams of sucrose dissolved in 150 grams of ethanol. And I'm told that the ebullosity constant (kb) for ethanol is 1.20°C per mole. I need to find the new boiling point of the solution.

Hmm, I think the formula for boiling point elevation is ΔT = i * K_b * m, where i is the van't Hoff factor, which for sucrose is 1 because it's a non-electrolyte. So i is 1.

Wait, what's 'm' here? Oh right, molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. So I need to calculate the molality of the sucrose solution.

First, let's find the moles of sucrose. The molecular formula is C12H22O11. Let me calculate its molar mass. Carbon is 12 g/mol, hydrogen 1, oxygen 16. So:

Molar mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) + (16 * 11)
= 144 + 22 + 176
= 144 + 22 is 166, plus 176 makes 342 g/mol.

So moles of sucrose = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 342 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 342 is approximately 0.02924 moles. Let me check: 342 * 0.02924 is about 10. So yes.

Now, the solvent is ethanol, which is 150 grams. I need to find the molality. Molality is moles per kg of solvent. So 150 grams is 0.15 kg. So molality m = 0.02924 mol / 0.15 kg.

Let me compute that. 0.02924 / 0.15 = 0.19493 mol/kg. Wait, 0.02924 divided by 0.15 equals approximately 0.1949 mol/kg. Let's double-check: 0.15 times 0.1949 is 0.029235, which matches the moles. Good.

Now, applying the formula: ΔT = i * K_b * m. Since i is 1, it's 1 * 1.20 * 0.1949.

Calculating that: 1.20 * 0.1949 = approximately 0.2339°C. So the boiling point increases by about 0.234°C.

The original boiling point of ethanol is 78.5°C. Adding 0.234 gives a new boiling point of 78.5 + 0.234 = 78.734°C. So approximately 78.73°C.

Looking at the options, option C is 78.73. So that's the answer. Let me see if I missed anything.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recheck the molality calculation. Moles of sucrose: 10g / 342g/mol = 0.02924 mol. Solvent is 150g = 0.15 kg. So molality is 0.02924 / 0.15 = approx 0.1949 mol/kg. Yes, that's correct.

So the increase is 1.20 * 0.1949 = 0.2339. So 78.5 + 0.2339 is 78.7339, which is about 78.73°C. So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the new boiling point of the ethanol-sucrose solution, we use the colligative property of boiling point elevation. The formula is:

\[
\Delta T = i \cdot K_b \cdot m
\]

where:
- \(i\) is the van't Hoff factor (1 for sucrose, a non-electrolyte),
- \(K_b\) is the boiling point elevation constant for ethanol, \(1.20 \, \text{°C/m}\),
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution.

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of sucrose
The molecular formula of sucrose is \(C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}\). Its molar mass is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass} = (12 \cdot 12) + (22 \cdot 1) + (16 \cdot 11) = 144 + 22 + 176 = 342 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of sucrose are:
\[
\text{Moles of sucrose} = \frac{\text{Mass of sucrose}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{10 \, \text{g}}{342 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.02924 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the molality of the solution
The solvent is ethanol, which has a mass of 150 g. Converting this to kilograms:
\[
\text{Mass of ethanol} = 150 \, \text{g} = 0.15 \, \text{kg}.
\]
Molality (\(m\)) is defined as:
\[
m = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Mass of solvent (in kg)}} = \frac{0.02924 \, \text{mol}}{0.15 \, \text{kg}} \approx 0.1949 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

### Step 3: Apply the boiling point elevation formula
Since \(i = 1\), the formula simplifies to:
\[
\Delta T = 1 \cdot 1.20 \, \text{°C/m} \cdot 0.1949 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]
Calculating the increase in boiling point:
\[
\Delta T \approx 1.20 \cdot 0.1949 \approx 0.2339 \, \text{°C}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the new boiling point
The original boiling point of ethanol is \(78.5 \, \text{°C}\). Adding the increase:
\[
\text{New boiling point} = 78.5 \, \text{°C} + 0.2339 \, \text{°C} \approx 78.73 \, \text{°C}.
\]

### Final Answer
The new boiling point of the ethanol-sucrose solution is approximately \(78.73 \, \text{°C}\). Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C: 78.73°C**
