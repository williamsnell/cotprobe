Question:

A rancher, being owner in fee simpleconveyed the property by warranty deed to a woman. The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman in the amount of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee will probably

Options:

A: succeed, because the mortgage was recorded immediately.
B: not succeed, because the quitclaim deed did not reference the mortgage.
C: succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.
D: succeed, because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.
E: not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.
F: succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.
G: not succeed, because the woman was still legally responsible for the mortgage debt.
H: not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
I: succeed, because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage by accepting the quitclaim deed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is about a rancher who conveyed his property by a warranty deed to a woman. But then, the woman gives her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Then, two years later, the woman sells the ranch to a farmer by a quitclaim deed. The woman defaults on the mortgage, and the niece brings an in-person action to recover the amount due. The question is about whether the woman's default will succeed against the farmer, and what the mortgagee will probably do.

First, I need to understand the conveyance chain here. So, the ranch was originally conveyed by a warranty deed to the woman. A warranty deed is a type of deed that allows the grantor to transfer the title as if it were a simple conveyance, but with the possibility of the grantee accepting a fee simple. It doesn't commit the grantee to any liability beyond the fee simple.

Now, the woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch. So, the mortgage is a lien on the property, but the lender is the niece, not the woman. Wait, but the woman conveyed the ranch to the farmer via a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed is when the grantor transfers title without transferring the ownership interest. It's similar to a fee simple conveyance, but without a fee. So the farmer takes the ranch, and can't necessarily sell it or use it for personal purposes unless the deed provides for that.

The woman defaults on the mortgage. The mortgagee (the niece's lender) is suing the farmer for the interest that's due. But the question is about the mortgagee's likely response.

The options are about whether the action will succeed or not. Let's think about the key issues here: the mortgage was recorded immediately, the nature of the conveyance (quitclaim deed), and whether the delegatees are properly abided by the original condition.

So, the woman's deed was a warranty deed, so she can't be held liable for the mortgage unless she defaulted, which she didn't. But the mortgage was recorded immediately. Wait, when is the recording? The warranty deed is a conveyance that can be recorded at any time during the grant. So, if the warranty deed was recorded, the mortgage was recorded as well. So the mortgage was immediately recorded, meaning the estate (the woman) doesn't have notice of the mortgage's existence.

But what's important here is whether the mortgage is a lien that the grantee (the woman) is legally responsible for. If the mortgage was recorded, the property is subject to the lien. But the woman hasn't taken possession yet because she has a warranty deed. So the mortgage is a lien on the property, but whether the woman is liable for it depends on whether she's the grantee. Since she's the grantee, any lien she has is her responsibility.

Wait, but the woman's deed (warranty) didn't commit her to any liability beyond the fee simple. So if she had a debt, she could be held liable. But in this case, she hasn't taken possession yet because she only conveyed by warranty. She gave the mortgage to her niece as a lien. The woman has a warranty deed, so she can't sue for the mortgage unless she (the grantee) defaulted, which she didn't. So, the mortgage she gave is a lien, and she's the owner, so she's responsible for it. But wait, wait—when a warranty deed is recorded, the grantor (woman) can't be liable for the mortgage unless she (the grantee) defaulted. She didn't, so she's not liable.

But wait, the woman's deed is a warranty deed, so the grantor (woman) can't be sued for the mortgage unless she defaulted. She didn't, so the mortgage is a lien on the property, but the grantee (her) isn't liable because she's the grantor.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The woman's deed is a warranty deed, which allows her to transfer the title as if it were a simple conveyance, but with the possibility that the grantee (the woman) could default. So, if the woman defaults on the mortgage, she's the one who can take action against the mortgagee, but she's not responsible because she's the grantee. But the mortgagee has the lien on the property, so she can sue the grantor (woman) for that. But wait, the woman's deed is a warranty deed, which doesn't commit her to any liability—so she can't be sued for the mortgage. So the mortgagee is suing the woman, but the woman is not liable because she didn't default. However, the woman did convey the property by warranty, so she can't be held liable for the mortgage unless she (the grantee) defaulted. She didn't, so no liability.

Wait, but the woman also conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed is a type of conveyance that transfers title without transferring ownership. So, the woman is selling the property to the farmer as if it's her own. So, the farmer owns the property now, but the woman's transfer via the warranty deed (and thus the quitclaim deed) doesn't commit the farmer to any liability. The farmer can't take possession, but he can still take in the future.

So, the mortgagee has a lien on the property, which is the woman's deed. The woman conveyed by warranty, so she is not responsible. But she also conveyed by quitclaim, so the farmer is not liable either. Wait, no—the woman's conveyance (warranty) didn't commit the woman to any liability beyond the fee simple. So the woman has a fee simple, but the mortgagee has the lien. However, the woman didn't take possession of the property, so she can't be sued for the mortgage, but she's the grantee. So the mortgagee has the lien on the property, so the farmer, who's the owner, has the lien.

But wait, the woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed. So the farmer is the owner now. So the mortgagee has a lien on the property, and since the farmer took the property but didn't commit any liability, the mortgagee can sue the farmer.

Wait, but the question is about whether the in-person action by the niece will succeed. The woman defaulted on the mortgage. So, when the woman defaulted, she had a lien on the property. The mortgagee's action (in person) is against the farmer. The farmer only took the property via the quitclaim deed. So, the farmer is the owner of the property now. The mortgagee is suing the farmer for the interest that's due.

But the woman (the grantee) didn't take possession because she conveyed by warranty. So, as the grantee, she isn't liable for the mortgage. So the mortgagee has a lien on the property. But the woman has a warranty deed, so she can't be sued for the mortgage. So the question is, does the farmer have any liability?

Wait, the woman conveyed by warranty, so the farmer doesn't have any liability because the warranty deed doesn't commit the grantee (woman) to any liability beyond the fee simple. So, the woman didn't take possession, so she can't sue for the mortgage. But the woman defaulted, so the mortgagee has a lien on the property. The farmer is the owner, but the woman didn't take it yet. So the mortgagee can sue the farmer for the interest that's due.

But the woman's deed to the farmer was a quitclaim, which doesn't commit the grantee to any liability. So, the farmer has no liability from the woman. But the woman defaulted on the mortgage, so the mortgagee (the lender) is suing the farmer for the interest.

Wait, but the woman's deed was a warranty. So, the woman can't be sued for the mortgage because she didn't default. She just defaulted on the mortgage she gave to the niece. So, the mortgagee has the lien. The woman's deed (warranty) didn't commit her to any liability. So, the woman is the grantee, so she isn't liable. But she gave the property to the farmer, so the farmer is the owner.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about it again. The woman's deed is a warranty deed to the farmer. So, the woman has the fee simple, and the farmer has the property, but the warranty deed doesn't commit the woman to any liability. So, the woman is not liable for the mortgage she gave to the niece. She only gave the mortgage to the niece as a lien. So, the mortgagee has the lien on the property. The property is now owned by the farmer, but the woman didn't take possession, so she can't sue for the mortgage. But she defaulted on the mortgage, so the mortgagee has the lien.

So, the question is whether the in-person action by the woman's default will succeed against the farmer. The woman's action is against the farmer, and the farmer is the owner.

Wait, but the woman is the grantee. She conveyed the property to the farmer via warranty. So, the farmer is the owner. But the woman hasn't taken the property yet. So, she can't take any action against the farmer in the future, right? Because she's the grantee. So, the in-person action must be against the future owner, the farmer.

So, the woman's action is against the farmer, who is the current owner. The farmer has a lien on the property. So, the farmer is the property owner, and the mortgagee is suing him for the interest that's due.

But the woman's deed was a warranty deed, so she can't be sued for the mortgage. She only defaulted on her own mortgage. So, the mortgagee has the lien, and the woman's action is against the farmer, not the woman.

Wait, but the woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a warranty deed, so the farmer is the owner. The woman's action is against the farmer. So, the in-person action is against the farmer, who is the current owner. The farmer is the owner, and the woman didn't take the property yet. So, the action is against the farmer, not the woman.

So, the question is whether the in-person action by the woman (who defaulted) against the farmer (who is the current owner) will succeed. The woman's action is against the farmer, so the farmer must be the owner.

But the woman's action is against the farmer. So, the farmer is the one who's liable, because the woman didn't take the property and the farmer is the owner. So, the farmer is the one who is in the position of interest.

So, the in-person action is against the farmer, who is the property owner. So, the question is whether the farmer is liable for the interest that's due. But the woman has a warranty deed, so she can't be sued for the mortgage. So, the woman's action is against the farmer.

Wait, but the woman's action is against the farmer. So, the farmer is the one who is in position of interest. So, the farmer is the one to sue. But the woman, in her deed, didn't take the property. So, the woman didn't commit any liability, so the farmer is the owner.

So, the farmer is the owner. The woman gave the property to him via a warranty deed, but she doesn't own it yet. So, the in-person action must be against the farmer. The farmer has a lien on the property, which is the woman's deed. So, the farmer is the owner, and the mortgagee is suing him. So, the woman didn't take the property, so she can't sue for the mortgage. But she defaulted, so the mortgagee has the lien.

So, the in-person action must be against the farmer. So, the question is whether the farmer is liable. The woman has a warranty deed, but she didn't take the property. So, the farmer is the owner. The woman didn't take the property, so she can't sue for the mortgage. Thus, the mortgagee (lender) has the lien on the property, and the farmer is the owner, so the in-person action against the farmer will succeed.

Wait, but the woman's default is on her own mortgage, not on the property's lien. So, the woman gave the property to the farmer, but the mortgage was a lien on the property. The woman's default is on the mortgage she gave to the niece, not the property's lien.

Wait, but the woman's deed to the farmer was a warranty, so the woman didn't commit the woman to any liability. She only gave the mortgage to the niece as a lien. So, the woman didn't take the property, so she can't be sued for the mortgage. But the woman defaulted on her own mortgage, so the mortgagee (lender) has the lien on the property. The farmer is the owner, so the mortgagee can sue the farmer for the lien.

But the woman's action is against the farmer. So, the in-person action is against the farmer. The farmer is the owner. So, the mortgagee (lender) has the lien on the property, and the farmer is the owner. The woman's action is against the farmer, so the farmer is the one who is in the position of interest. So, the in-person action will succeed because the farmer is the property owner and has the lien.

Wait, but the woman's deed is a warranty deed to the farmer, so she can't be sued for the mortgage. She only defaulted on her own mortgage. So, the woman's action is against the farmer, not the woman. So, the farmer is the owner, and the mortgagee is suing him. So, the in-person action against the farmer will succeed.

But wait, the woman gave the property to the farmer via a warranty deed, which doesn't commit her to any liability. So, the woman is the grantee, and the property is now with the farmer. The woman didn't take possession, so she can't sue for the mortgage. But she defaulted, so the mortgagee has the lien on the property.

So, the woman's action is against the farmer. The farmer is the owner, so the in-person action will succeed because the farmer is the property owner and the mortgagee is suing him.

Looking at the options, let's see which fit.

Option A: succeed, because the mortgage was recorded immediately.

Well, the fact that the mortgage was recorded immediately doesn't necessarily mean it's successful. Because it's the woman's deed that's a warranty, not the mortgagee's. So, the in-person action against the farmer would be successful regardless of when the mortgage was recorded. So, A is not necessarily correct.

Option B: not succeed, because the quitclaim deed did not reference the mortgage.

But the woman gave the mortgage to the niece, and the quitclaim deed was to the farmer. But the quitclaim deed doesn't commit the grantee (the woman) to any liability. So, the mortgagee doesn't have any reference to the mortgage. The quitclaim deed is about transferring the title, not the lien. So, the mortgagee's action is against the farmer, not the woman. So, B is incorrect.

Option C: succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.

Wait, delegation of duties is about the grantee taking on the burden. In a warranty deed, the grantor doesn't delegate. So, the woman didn't delegate any duty to the mortgagee. So, C is incorrect.

Option D: succeed, because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.

Wait, the quitclaim deed is a type of deed that transfers title without transferring the ownership interest. But it doesn't absolve the grantee of any duty. So, the woman didn't absolve the farmer from the mortgage debt. So, the in-person action against the farmer would succeed because the farmer is the owner.

Wait, but the woman's deed is a warranty deed, which doesn't commit her to any liability. So the woman's action is against the farmer, not the woman. So, the answer would be D.

Wait, the woman gave a mortgage to the niece, and the woman conveyed the property to the farmer via quitclaim. The woman's deed to the farmer was a warranty, so she didn't commit any liability. She didn't take the property, so she can't be sued for the mortgage. The woman defaulted on her own mortgage, so the mortgagee has a lien on the property. The farmer is the owner, so the in-person action against the farmer will succeed.

But wait, let me look at the options again. The correct option must be one where the in-person action against the farmer will succeed, and the woman's action against the farmer doesn't.

Option D says: succeed, because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.

Wait, but the woman's deed to the farmer was a warranty deed, which doesn't absolve the grantee (woman) of the mortgage. So, the woman didn't absolve the farmer. So, the farmer is in the position of interest and can recover.

So, the correct answer would be D.

But let me think about option B again. Option B says the woman's deed didn't reference the mortgage. But the woman gave the mortgage to the niece as a lien. The quitclaim deed is to the farmer, so the woman didn't give the mortgage to the farmer. So, option B is incorrect.

Wait, the woman's deed was to the farmer, which is a quitclaim deed. She gave a mortgage to the niece. The woman's deed is a warranty, which doesn't commit the grantee (woman) to any debt. So, the woman didn't default on the mortgage. The woman's action is against the farmer, but the farmer is the current owner.

So, the in-person action against the farmer will succeed because the farmer is the owner and has the lien. But the woman's action is against the farmer, not the woman. So, the woman didn't commit any liability, but she defaulted on her own mortgage. So, the woman's action is against the farmer, which is the owner, and the farmer is the owner.

So, the correct answer is D: succeed, because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.

Wait, but the woman's deed is a warranty, which doesn't absolve the woman, but does it absolve the farmer? No. The farmer is the current owner, so the in-person action against the farmer will succeed regardless.

But let's look at the options again. The options are about the in-person action.

So, the options are about the outcome of the in-person action against the farmer.

Option D says the in-person action will succeed because the quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the farmer.

Wait, the quitclaim deed is to the farmer. So, the woman gave the mortgage to the niece as a lien. The woman conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed, which is a type of deed that transfers title without transferring the ownership interest. But the quitclaim deed doesn't absolve the grantee (the woman) of any duty. So, the woman didn't absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.

Wait, but the woman's deed was a warranty, not a quitclaim. So, the woman gave the property to the farmer via a warranty deed, which allows the grantor (woman) to transfer the title as if it were a simple conveyance, but without a fee. So, the woman can't be sued for the mortgage because she didn't default, but she just gave the mortgage to the niece as a lien.

Wait, the woman's deed was a warranty deed, which allows her to transfer the title without transferring the ownership interest. So, the woman can't be sued for the mortgage because she only transferred the title, not the ownership.

So, the woman's deed to the farmer was a warranty deed, so she can't be sued for the mortgage. The woman defaulted on her own mortgage, so the mortgagee has the lien on the property. The farmer is the current owner, so the in-person action against the farmer will succeed.

So, the correct answer is D.
</think>

The woman conveyed the property by a warranty deed, which allows her to transfer the title without transferring the ownership interest. As a result, she cannot be sued for the mortgage she gave to the niece, even though she defaulted on her own mortgage. The woman also conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed, which transfers title without transferring ownership. The woman did not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt because the quitclaim deed is a type of deed that transfers title without transferring ownership, and it does not absolve the grantee (the woman) of any liability. However, the woman's deed to the farmer was a warranty deed, so she cannot be sued for the mortgage. The woman defaulted on her own mortgage, so the mortgagee has a lien on the property. The farmer is the current owner, so the in-person action against the farmer will succeed because the farmer is the property owner and has the lien. The woman's action is against the farmer, not the woman. The woman did not commit liability because she did not default on her own mortgage, but she did not commit liability on the property. Therefore, the in-person action against the farmer will succeed, and the woman's action against the farmer will fail.

ANSWER: D
