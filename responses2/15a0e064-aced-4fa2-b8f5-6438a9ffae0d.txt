Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the work required to expand a cell's surface area. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in class.

Alright, the question says the cell is roughly spherical with a radius of 20.0 micrometers. Oh wait, 20.0e-6 meters—that's 20 micrometers. So, the radius r is 20e-6 m. The radius increases by a factor of three, so the new radius R is 3 times that. Let me calculate that: 3 * 20e-6 m is 60e-6 m, which is 60 micrometers or 6e-5 meters.

The problem asks for the work required to expand the cell surface against the surface tension. So, surface tension—right, surface tension is the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid. I remember the formula for the work done is the surface tension multiplied by the change in surface area.

Wait, but wait. The surface tension is in units of J/m², right? I think the formula is W = γ * ΔA, where γ is the surface tension and ΔA is the change in area.

But wait, surface tension is actually a property of the liquid, but in this case, the cell is surrounded by pure water. So, the surface tension of the water would be what we're using here.

I need to find the surface tension of water. Hmm, I seem to recall that water's surface tension is around 72 mN/m. Wait, wait, mN is milli Newtons, so 0.072 N/m. Let me confirm that—yes, I think that's right. So γ is 72 mN/m, which is 72e-3 N/m.

Now, the change in area ΔA is the area of the larger sphere minus the area of the smaller sphere. Since the cell is spherical, the area is 4πr². So, the initial area A1 is 4π*(20e-6)^2, and the final area A2 is 4π*(60e-6)^2.

Let me compute those values. But maybe I can factor that out. So, ΔA = 4π [ (R)^2 - (r)^2 ].

Substituting R=3r, that's 4π [ (9r²) - r² ] which is 4π(8r²) = 32 π r².

Wait, that's a much simpler way. So, the change in area is 32 π r squared.

So, now putting this all together. The work W is γ multiplied by ΔA. So:

W = γ * (32 π r²)

Plugging in the numbers:

γ is 72e-3 N/m (since 1e-3 is a thousandth, 72e-3 is 0.072 N/m).

r is 20e-6 m. So r squared is (20e-6)^2 = 400e-12 m². Multiply that by π: 400e-12 * π ≈ 1256.64e-12 m².

Wait, 400e-12 * π is approximately 1.2566e-9 m².

Multiply that by 32 π. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute step by step.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the change in area is 32 π r², right? Because 32π (20e-6)^2 is the correct change. So let me compute that.

r = 20e-6 m.

r squared is (20e-6)^2 = 400e-12 m².

32π times that is 32 * π * 400e-12.

Wait, 32 * 400 is 12,800. So 12,800e-12 * π.

Wait, 12,800e-12 is 1.28e-8 m². Multiply by π (approx 3.1416), so 1.28e-8 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.021e-8 m².

Wait, but wait, that's the change in area, ΔA.

So, W = γ * ΔA.

γ is 72e-3 N/m, which is 0.072 N/m.

So W = 0.072 N/m * 4.021e-8 m².

Wait, 0.072 * 4.021e-8. Let me compute that. 0.072 times 4 is 0.288, but with 4.021e-8, it's 0.072 * 4.021e-8 = ?

Wait, 0.072 * 4.021 = let's compute that. 72 * 4021 = ?

Wait, no, perhaps better to think in terms of exponents.

0.072 = 7.2e-2.

Multiply by 4.021e-8: 7.2e-2 *4.021e-8 = (7.2 *4.021) e-10.

7.2 *4 is 28.8, 7.2*0.021=0.1512. So total is 28.9512.

So 28.9512e-10 = 2.895e-9 J.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option E is 2.89e-9 J. So that's the answer. But wait, wait, let me double-check my calculations, because sometimes I make mistakes.

Wait, let me redo the changes step by step.

Compute ΔA: 4π (R² - r²) = 4π ( (3r)^2 - r^2 ) = 4π (9r² - r²) )=4π (8r²) )=32 π r².

r = 20e-6 m. So, r^2 is (20e-6)^2 =400e-12 m².

So, 32 π * 400e-12 = 12800 π e-12.

Wait, 32 *400 is 12800. So, 12800e-12 * π.

Wait, 12800e-12 equals 1.28e-8.

Multiply by π: approx 3.1416 * 1.28e-8 = 4.021e-8 m².

So, ΔA is 4.021e-8 m².

Multiply by γ: 0.072 N/m.

0.072 *4.021e-8 = ?

0.072 =7.2e-2.

7.2e-2 *4.021e-8 = (7.2 *4.021) * 1e-10.

7.2 *4 is 28.8; 7.2 *0.021 is 0.1512.

28.9512 * 1e-10 is 2.89512e-9 J.

Wait, so approximately 2.895e-9 J. Which is option E: 2.89e-9 J.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option E is 2.89e-9. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the surface tension value. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait a second. What is the surface tension of water?

I thought it was around 72 mN/m, but some sources say 72 mN/m is correct. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, wait. Another source says the surface tension of water is about 72 mN/m. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the surface tension of another liquid, but the problem states it's water.

So, I think the calculation is correct. So the work required is about 2.89e-9 J, which is option E.

To calculate the work required to expand the cell surface against the surface tension of pure water, we use the formula:

\[
W = \gamma \cdot \Delta A
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the surface tension of water (72 mN/m or \( 72 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{N/m} \)) and \( \Delta A \) is the change in surface area.

### Step 1: Initial and final surface areas
The cell is spherical with radius \( r = 20.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). The surface area of a sphere is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi r^2
\]

For the initial radius \( r \), the surface area is:

\[
A_1 = 4 \pi (20.0 \times 10^{-6})^2 = 4 \pi (400 \times 10^{-12}) = 1600 \pi \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m}^2
\]

For the final radius \( R = 3r \), the surface area is:

\[
A_2 = 4 \pi (3r)^2 = 4 \pi (9r^2) = 36 \pi r^2
\]

The change in surface area is:

\[
\Delta A = A_2 - A_1 = 36 \pi r^2 - 4 \pi r^2 = 32 \pi r^2
\]

Substituting \( r = 20.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), we find:

\[
r^2 = (20.0 \times 10^{-6})^2 = 400 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m}^2
\]

\[
\Delta A = 32 \pi (400 \times 10^{-12}) = 12,800 \pi \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Approximating \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[
\Delta A \approx 12,800 \times 3.1416 \times 10^{-12} \approx 4.021 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the work
The surface tension of water is \( \gamma = 72 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{N/m} \). Substituting into the formula for work:

\[
W = \gamma \cdot \Delta A = (72 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot (4.021 \times 10^{-8})
\]

\[
W = (72 \cdot 4.021) \times 10^{-11}
\]

\[
W \approx 289.512 \times 10^{-11} = 2.895 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{J}
\]

### Final Answer
The work required to expand the cell surface is approximately \( 2.89 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
