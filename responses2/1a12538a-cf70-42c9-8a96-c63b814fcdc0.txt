Question:

A reliable police informant telephoned the police to report seeing two men in a blue car selling narcotics outside a local movie theater. The informant gave a detailed description of the two men and the license number of the vehicle. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to the movie theater. A few minutes later, the police saw a car matching the description given parked about two blocks from the movie theater. When the police approached, they saw one man fitting the description provided. The police proceeded to the car and opened the doors of the vehicle. The police then pried open a locked tool case that was situated in the rear of the vehicle. Inside, the police found an envelope that contained about one gram of cocaine. They then placed the driver of the vehicle under arrest. Immediately thereafter, the police opened the glove compartment and found a small amount of marijuana. The driver of the van was subsequently prosecuted and charged with two counts of possession of controlled dangerous substances. He filed a motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence. His motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, as to the cocaine only.
B: denied, but only as to the marijuana.
C: granted, as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.
D: granted, because the police didn't have probable cause to search the vehicle.
E: denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.
F: denied, because the police had probable cause to search the vehicle.
G: denied, but only as to the cocaine.
H: granted, because the police didn't have a warrant to search the vehicle.
I: granted, as to the marijuana only.

Alright, let me try to figure out this case. So, the scenario is about a police officer and a reliable informant. The situation goes like this: a police officer calls a informant who describes two men in a blue car selling narcotics. The car has a license number. Then the patrol car was sent to a local movie theater. A few minutes later, another car matching the description was found near the theater. When the police arrived, one of the two men fit the description. They approached the car, took it, opened the doors, and then pried open a locked tool case to find some cocaine inside. The driver was arrested and charged with two offenses. Now, the question is about the officer's motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence.

I need to analyze whether the police should keep the evidence or not. The options are about whether the cocaine and marijuana should be excluded. So, let's go through the steps.

First, the police initially found a car with the description. But then they went to the movie theater, where they found another car. The idea here is that maybe the second car wasn't actually the same vehicle. So, the police might have mistakenly thought they found a new vehicle, but in reality, it was the same. So, they were in the process of taking the vehicle and then found another one.

So, the key here is whether the police had probable cause to search the vehicle. Because if they didn't, then they can't exclude the evidence. Probable cause is the main factor here.

In the case of a search where the police are trying to find a specific vehicle, if they don't have probable cause to search the area, they can't use a search warrant. The search is usually done to locate a specific object or vehicle. If the vehicle isn't there, the police can't exclude it.

In this case, the police initially thought the vehicle was theirs but then found another one. So, they went to the movie theater where they found the second vehicle. That means they didn't find the vehicle in the theater, so they couldn't search the area for it there, because they didn't have probable cause.

Wait, but the initial search was for the vehicle. So, the police went to the movie theater, found the vehicle, then went back and found another one. That suggests that the police didn't have the probable cause to search the area again because they already found the vehicle in the theater. So, they didn't have the means to search again. Therefore, they can't exclude the evidence they found in the second vehicle.

Wait, no. Maybe they still had probable cause to search the area. Let me think again. The initial situation is that a patrol car was sent to the theater, which is where the vehicle was found. But then after that, the police found another vehicle. So, perhaps the initial search for the vehicle was not successful, but the second search was successful.

But the key is whether the police had probable cause to search the vehicle. If the initial search didn't find anything, but then they went and found another vehicle, does that mean they had probable cause? Or is the probable cause based on the fact that they found another vehicle, implying that the vehicle was there?

Alternatively, maybe the police didn't have a warrant because they didn't have probable cause. Because in a search for a vehicle, the officer can't just go around to look everywhere without probable cause. If they didn't search the area and found the vehicle in a different place, they can't use a search, so they can't exclude the evidence from the second vehicle.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the standard procedure. When a police officer finds a vehicle and says it's theirs, they might look around the area for another vehicle, but if they find it, they can't use a search to locate it. So, the initial search for the vehicle wasn't successful, and they didn't have probable cause to search again. Therefore, they couldn't exclude the evidence from the second vehicle.

So, the police were trying to use a search to find the vehicle, but didn't have probable cause. Therefore, they can't exclude any evidence, including the cocaine and marijuana, because the evidence is in the second vehicle, which they couldn't search. But wait, the question is about whether the evidence should be excluded.

Wait, the motion is to exclude the drug and marijuana. So, the police can't use a search to look for them because they didn't have the right circumstances. So, they can't exclude the evidence. So, the motion is denied.

Looking at the options, option F says "denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana." Option H says "grant, as to the marijuana only." Option A is "grant as to the cocaine only."

But wait, in this scenario, the police found the vehicle in the second location, so they can't use a search to get it, so they can't exclude the evidence. So, the motion to exclude is denied. So, the answer would be F: denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: sometimes, when a vehicle is found, the officer can use a search to locate it, but if the vehicle wasn't there, the search can't be used. So, if the officer found the vehicle in the second location, they didn't have the probable cause to search the vehicle again. Therefore, they can't exclude anything.

So, the police's motion is to exclude the evidence, but they can't. Therefore, the court should deny the motion. So, the options are F: denied, as to both. Or E: denied as to both. Or D: granted as to marijuana only.

Wait, the options are:

F: denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.

E: denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.

H: granted, because police didn't have warrant.

G: denied, only for the cocaine.

I: granted, marijuana only.

Wait, the problem is whether the driver can be prosecuted. If the police can't search the vehicle, they can't get the evidence. So, they can't exclude it, so the evidence is available for prosecution. But the question is about the motion to exclude.

So, the police can't use a search to find the drug and the marijuana, so they can't exclude them. Therefore, the motion is denied. So, the options are F or E.

But wait, the options are about the motion: the motion is to exclude the evidence. So, the police can't search the vehicle to find the drug or the marijuana, so the evidence is not available for prosecution. Therefore, the motion is denied.

So, the answer is F: denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F says "denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana."

Alternatively, let's think about the context. If the police found the vehicle in the second location, and didn't have the probable cause to search it again, then they can't use a search to get the evidence. So, the evidence isn't available for the prosecution. Therefore, the motion is denied.

So, the correct answer would be F.
</think>

The police encountered the vehicle in a different location and couldn't use a search to locate it, as they lacked probable cause to search again. Therefore, the police cannot exclude the evidence of the drug and marijuana from evidence. The motion to exclude is denied.

Answer: F
