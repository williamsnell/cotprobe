Okay, so I've got this question about intense interspecific competition and what consequences it has. Hmm, interspecific competition is when different species compete for the same resources, right? But the term 'intense' might mean it's really strong. Let me think about each option.

Looking at the options, the question is specifically about the consequences of intense interspecific competition. So the options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Option A: Increased species diversity. Wait, if competition is intense, would that lead to more diversity? I don't think so. Intense competition usually reduces species because it makes it harder for species to coexist. So A might not be right.

Option B: Homogenization of traits. Homogenization is when similar traits develop in different species. Intense competition might cause similar traits to spread, but I'm not sure if it homogenizes or not. Maybe it leads to some similarities, but not necessarily homogenization. Not sure about B.

Option C: Decreased genetic diversity. Intense competition would probably lead to less variation within species. Because if species are competing, they might not have enough resources to retain their own genetic diversity. So C could be right. Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Option D: Spontaneous generation of new species. That doesn't sound right. Intense competition isn't about new species forming; it's about existing species' ability to coexist. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Development of identical ecological niches. Yeah, if two species are competing for the same resources, they might end up occupying the same ecological niches. So E might be correct.

Option F: Creation of new resources. That doesn't make sense. Intense competition doesn't create new resources, that's a different process. So F is probably not the right answer.

Option G: Extinction of rival species, evolution in divergent directions, and competitive exclusion. Wait, competitive exclusion is part of the principle, right? So if intense competition happens, it leads to the principle of competitive exclusion, meaning species can't coexist. Also, maybe the two species go extinct because they can't coexist. But the option says "extinction of rival species" which is a result of intense competition. The rest is more about the principle. So G seems to cover these aspects.

Option H: Unrestricted population growth. That's opposite of what competition does. More competition would actually lead to fewer individuals because resources are limited. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Formation of stable mutualistic relationships. Well, mutualism is a type of interspecific interaction. But does intense competition lead to that? Maybe not. Intense competition is more about direct competition, so mutualism might not be the consequence. So I is probably wrong.

Option J: Enhanced cooperation. Intense competition would lead to less cooperation. So J is not correct.

So going back, the options. G says that it leads to extinction of rival species, evolution in divergent directions, and the principle of competitive exclusion. That makes sense. Intense competition would cause two species to have identical niches, leading to their extinction. Plus, they wouldn't evolve the same traits, which is about divergent evolution. And competitive exclusion is a key principle where species can't coexist, so they can't coexist, leading to their decline.

So the correct answer is G.

The consequences of intense interspecific competition are best captured by the principle of competitive exclusion, where species cannot coexist if they are directly competing for the same resources. Additionally, intense competition can lead to the extinction of rival species by forcing them into identical ecological niches, resulting in the evolution of divergent traits. This aligns with option G, which states that intense competition leads to the extinction of rival species, evolution in divergent directions, and the principle of competitive exclusion.
