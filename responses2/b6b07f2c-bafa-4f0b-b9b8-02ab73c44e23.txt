Okay, so I've got this question about the main difference between the short-run and long-run Phillips curves. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that the Phillips curve relates inflation and unemployment. There are two versions: short-run and long-run. From what I've learned, the short-run curve is downward sloping, while the long-run is different.

Wait, the short-run Phillips curve is downward sloping because when the unemployment rate decreases, inflation tends to rise. That's because lower unemployment usually means higher demand, so demand-pull inflation happens. So, as the economy recovers, people start thinking it's bad and demand decreases, leading to lower inflation. So, in the short run, there's a trade-off between low unemployment and high inflation.

Then, the long-run Phillips curve is horizontal because in the long term, people expect inflation to stabilize, so the natural rate of unemployment is a natural level where the economy is at full employment. So, the long-run curve is flat, meaning that the natural rate is fixed. It's a horizontal line, not sloping. So, the short-run is sloping (downward), the long-run is flat.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Short is down, long is horizontal. That makes sense.
Option B: Short down, long vertical. No, long is horizontal, not vertical.
Option C: Short up, long vertical. No, short is down.
Option D: Short is horizontal, long vertical. No, short is sloping.
Option E: Short vertical, long horizontal. No, short is down.
Option F: Both down and up. No, both would be different.
Option G: Short is horizontal, long upward sloping. No, long is flat. Also, upward isn't correct.
Option H: Both upward. No, both are different.
Option I: Both vertical. No, they aren't vertical.
Option J: Both upward. No, same as H.

So looking again, option A is correct.

The short-run Phillips curve is downward sloping, reflecting the trade-off between low unemployment and high inflation as the economy recovers. The long-run Phillips curve is horizontal, indicating that the natural rate of unemployment is fixed due to expectations of full employment. Thus, the correct answer is:
