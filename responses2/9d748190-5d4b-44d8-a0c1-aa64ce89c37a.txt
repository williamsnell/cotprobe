Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer between iron and water. Let me see if I can figure this out. The question says a piece of iron is placed in water, and I need to find the resulting temperature. 

Hmm, let's think. The iron starts at 95°C and the water at 25°C. Since the iron is hotter, it'll lose heat, and the water will gain heat, right? And assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings, the heat lost by the iron should equal the heat gained by the water.

The formula for heat transfer is q = m * c * ΔT. Oh wait, yeah, q is the heat, m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature. But wait, since the iron is losing heat, its q will be negative, and the water will have a positive q. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, I can just set them equal.

The data given is:
Iron: mass is 20.0 g, specific heat is 0.108 cal/g°C. Water: mass 100.0 g, specific heat 1.0 cal/g°C.

So the initial temperatures are T_iron = 95°C and T_water = 25°C.

Let me set up the equation. The heat lost by iron equals the heat gained by water.

m_iron * c_iron * (T_iron_initial - T_final) = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_water_initial)

Plugging in the numbers:

20.0 g * 0.108 cal/(g·°C) * (95 - T_final) = 100.0 g * 1.0 cal/(g·°C) * (T_final - 25)

Let me compute each part. 

First, let's compute the left side and the right side.

Left side: 20 * 0.108 = 2.16. So 2.16 * (95 - T_final).

Right side: 100 * 1 = 100. So 100 * (T_final -25).

So the equation is 2.16*(95 - T) = 100*(T -25).

Let me expand both sides.

Left: 2.16 *95 = 2.16 * 90 is 194.4, 2.16 *5 is 10.8. So 194.4+10.8=205.2. So left side is 205.2 - 2.16 T.

Right: 100 T - 2500.

So equation is 205.2 - 2.16 T = 100 T -2500.

Let me move all terms to one side.

205.2 + 2500 = 100 T + 2.16 T.

2705.2 = 102.16 T.

Hmm, wait, no. Because when I move terms, it's: 205.2 +2500 = 100 T +2.16 T.

Wait, let me re-calculate. The correct approach is to bring all terms to the left or right. Let's move 100T to the left and 205.2 to the right.

Wait, perhaps I should subtract 100T from both sides and add 2.16 T to both sides.

Wait no, let me reorganize:

205.2 -2.16 T = 100 T -2500.

Adding 2.16 T to both sides: 205.2 = 102.16 T -2500.

Add 2500 to both sides: 2705.2 = 102.16 T.

Ah yes, so 2705.2 equals 102.16 T.

So T = 2705.2 / 102.16.

Let me compute that. Hmm, 102.16 times 26 is about 2656. So 2705 is a bit more. Let me calculate it.

Wait, 102.16 * 26 is 102 *26 = 2652, plus 0.16*26=4.16 → 2656.16. So 26. So 26.56. Hmm, but let me compute more precisely.

Wait, 2705.2 / 102.16.

Let me compute 102.16 × 26 = ?

102.16 * 26: 100 *26=2600, 2.16*26: 2*26=52, 0.16*26=4.16 → 52+4.16=56.16. So 2600+56.16=2656.16.

So 2705.2 -2656.16 = 49.04.

So 49.04 /102.16 = approx 0.479.

So total T is 26 + 0.479 = approximately 26.479°C.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's do it with exact division.

102.16 T = 2705.2 → T = 2705.2 / 102.16.

Let me compute 2705.2 ÷ 102.16.

I can write 102.16 ×26 = 2656.16, as before.

Subtract from 2705.2 → 2705.2 -2656.16 = 49.04.

So now, 49.04 divided by 102.16.

Let's compute 49.04 ÷102.16.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 49040 / 102160.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 49.04 ÷ 102.16.

Approximating, 49 ÷ 100 = 0.49.

But 102.16 is a bit more than 100, so the result will be a bit less than 0.49.

Let me compute 49.04 / 102.16.

Well, 102.16 × 0.479 is approximately:

102.16 × 0.4 =40.864.

102.16 × 0.07 =7.1512.

102.16 × 0.009=0.91944.

So 0.4 +0.07+0.009=0.479.

So 40.864 +7.1512=47.0152 +0.91944=47.93464.

Wait, 0.479 ×102.16=47.93464.

But the numerator is 49.04, so 49.04 -47.93464=1.10536.

So remaining 1.10536 /102.16 = approximately 0.0108 (since 102.16 *0.01=1.0216; close to 1.10536).

So 0.0108.

So total is approximately 0.479 +0.0108=0.4898.

So T is approximately 26 +0.4898=26.4898°C, which is about 26.49°C.

Looking at the options, option E is 26.48°C, option J is 32.5, etc.

Wait, wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the equation? Because the initial setup:

q_iron = q_water.

But iron is losing heat, so q_iron is negative, and water's q is positive.

So, m_iron * c_iron * (T_initial - T_final) = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water).

Wait, no, the equation is m_iron * c_iron * (T_initial_iron - T_final) = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water).

Yes, because the iron is losing heat, so the temperature change is T_initial - T_final. The water is gaining, so T_final - T_initial.

Hmm, but in the equation setup, I set it as:

m_iron * c_iron * (95 - T) = m_water * c_water * (T -25).

Which is correct.

So T is about 26.4898, which is about 26.49°C. But looking at the options, option E is 26.48, which is close, but wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation step.

Wait, let me compute 2705.2 divided by 102.16.

Let me do it as 2705.2 ÷ 102.16.

Let me compute 102.16 * 26 = 2656.16.

2705.2 -2656.16= 49.04.

So 49.04 /102.16 = ? Let's compute it as 49.04 ÷102.16.

Well, 102.16 ×0.48= 49.0608.

Ah! Because 102.16 ×0.48 = 102 *0.48 +0.16*0.48 → 48.96 +0.0768=49.0368.

Which is just about 49.04.

So 0.48 ×102.16 =49.0368.

So that means 49.04 /102.16 =0.48.

So T=26 + 0.48=26.48°C.

So the correct answer is E: 26.48°C.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is 26.48, option J is 32.5. So the correct answer is E. But wait, no, I'm getting 26.48, which is option E.

Wait, but the problem says "resulting temperature of the iron and water." But wait, the options include E as 26.48, which is our result. So the correct answer is option E.
</think>

To determine the resulting temperature of the iron and water, we use the principle of conservation of energy: the heat lost by the iron equals the heat gained by the water. The heat transfer equation is:

\[
q_{\text{iron}} = q_{\text{water}}
\]

Substituting the formula for heat transfer (\(q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T\)):

\[
m_{\text{iron}} \cdot c_{\text{iron}} \cdot (T_{\text{initial, iron}} - T_{\text{final}}) = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial, water}})
\]

Given data:
- \(m_{\text{iron}} = 20.0 \, \text{g}\), \(c_{\text{iron}} = 0.108 \, \text{cal/g°C}\)
- \(m_{\text{water}} = 100.0 \, \text{g}\), \(c_{\text{water}} = 1.0 \, \text{cal/g°C}\)
- \(T_{\text{initial, iron}} = 95.0 \, \text{°C}\), \(T_{\text{initial, water}} = 25.0 \, \text{°C}\)

Substitute these values into the equation:

\[
20.0 \cdot 0.108 \cdot (95.0 - T_{\text{final}}) = 100.0 \cdot 1.0 \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 25.0)
\]

Simplify:

\[
2.16 \cdot (95.0 - T_{\text{final}}) = 100.0 \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 25.0)
\]

Expand both sides:

\[
205.2 - 2.16T_{\text{final}} = 100T_{\text{final}} - 2500
\]

Rearrange terms to isolate \(T_{\text{final}}\):

\[
205.2 + 2500 = 100T_{\text{final}} + 2.16T_{\text{final}}
\]

\[
2705.2 = 102.16T_{\text{final}}
\]

Solve for \(T_{\text{final}}\):

\[
T_{\text{final}} = \frac{2705.2}{102.16} \approx 26.48 \, \text{°C}
\]

Thus, the resulting temperature of the iron and water is approximately \(26.48 \, \text{°C}\). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: 26.48°C**
