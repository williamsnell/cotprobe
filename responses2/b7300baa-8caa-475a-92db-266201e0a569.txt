Question:

Walter, a widower, died in 1997 leaving $1,000,000 to Trend Trust Company in trust to pay the income to his son, Stan, for life. Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. "Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. There is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction. Harriet, on behalf of Grace, brings an appropriate action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from said trust to be paid to Grace. Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?

Options:

A: No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.
B: Yes, because Grace is the only surviving child of Harriet and therefore is entitled to the income from the trust.
C: Yes, because the death of Stan and Morgana in an airplane crash in 2009 triggered the provision for the income to be paid to the living children of Harriet.
D: Yes, because that was Walter's intent.
E: No, because the trust was to be paid to Grace only after the death of any widow of Stan, and Morgana's death nullified this provision.
F: Yes, because there is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction that would prevent Grace from receiving the income from the trust.
G: Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.
H: No, because the trust explicitly states that the income is to be paid to the living children of Harriet only after the death of Stan's widow.
I: No, because the Rule against Perpetuities prevents the trust from being held indefinitely.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically involving trusts and the Rule against Perpetuities. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand the scenario. Walter died in 1997, leaving $1,000,000 to Trend Trust Company. This trust is set up to pay the income to Stan, his son, for life. So, the trust is intended to give Stan his share. Then, upon Stan's death, the income goes to any widow of Stan. And then, if Stan's widow dies, the income goes to Harriet's living children, Grace, in equal shares.

Now, in 2009, both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash. They're the widows of Stan? Wait, no. Wait, the will says that "the net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for life." Then, "Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan." Wait, so the widows of Stan would be the people who wereStan's widows. But in this case, both Stan and Morgana died, but they're the parents of Andrew and Beverly, so they aren't widows of Stan. So, how did they become widows? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the will says that the trust is to pay to Stan for life. Then, upon Stan's death, the income goes to any widow of Stan. Wait, but Stan's widows would be people who were his widows. But in this case, both Stan and Morgana died. Wait, but in the scenario, both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash. So, maybe the widows ofStan are the people who wereStan's widows. But anyway, the point is, in 2009, both died, so perhaps the next step is that the trust's income is passed to Harriet's children.

Wait, but the problem says their children are Andrew and Beverly, but they're only children of Stan, right? Because the will says Stan was married to Morgana, so yes, Andrew and Beverly are Stan's children. So the trust is intended to pay Andrew and Beverly, the children of Stan, to him for life. But when Stan dies and his widow is someone, the income goes to the living children of Harriet. Wait, Harriet is presumably the sister of Andrew and Beverly. So, if Andrew and Beverly are the children of Stan, and Harriet is the sister, then after Stan's death and his widow's death, the income goes to Harriet's living children, which would be Grace, since Andrew and Beverly were children of Stan, and Harriet is Grace's mother. Wait, noâ€”wait, Harriet is Grace's sister, right? So Grace is Andrew's sister, Harriet's other sister. So Grace's living children would be Andrew and Beverly, but Andrew and Beverly are no longer in the living after their parents died. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the trust's instructions are: "the net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares."

So, if Stan's widow dies, the income goes to Harriet's living children. But Harriet is the sister of Andrew and Beverly. If Andrew and Beverly are dead, then Harriet may have Grace as her living child. Because Grace was born in 2001, which is after the crash in 2009. So, in 2001, Grace was born. Then, in 2009, both Stan and Morgana died, triggering the provision that after their death, the income goes to Harriet's children. But Harriet, as the sister of Andrew and Beverly, would have Grace as her only child at that point.

Wait, but why is Grace the only surviving child of Harriet? Because Andrew and Beverly were the children of Stan, and they died in 2009. So, Harriet only has Grace as her child. So, when the income is passed to Harriet's living children, it's just Grace.

But let's get back to the question. The scenario is that both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. The options are whether Harriet can get the income from the trust to pay to Grace.

So, the original plan was that the trust would pay to Andrew and Beverly (Stan's children) for life. Then, if Stan's widow dies, the income goes to Harriet's living children, which would be Grace only (since Andrew and Beverly are dead, and Harriet is Grace's sister). So, Grace would get the income.

But what about the Rule against Perpetuities? I remember that the Rule against Perpetuities (also known as the future interest rule) applies to trusts where the interest is intended to last forever. But here, the trust's life is only for life, so it's a contingent future interest. So, the question is whether the provisions in the will violate the Rule against Perpetuities.

So, the options are about whether Grace can get the income. Let's look at the options.

Option A: No, because the provisions violate the Rule against Perpetuities.

Option F: Yes, because there's no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction that would prevent Grace from receiving the income.

Option G: Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust are deceased.

Option E: No, because the trust explicitly states that the income is to be paid to the living children of Harriet only after the death of Stan's widow. But wait, in this case, the death of Stan's widow would be in 2009, which would trigger the provision to pay to Grace. So, the trust's provisions do include that: upon the death of Stan's widow, the income goes to Harriet's living children. So, if the widows of Stan are Harriet? Wait no, Harriet is the sister of Andrew and Beverly, who were the children of Stan. So, if Harriet is the sister of Andrew and Beverly, then Harriet is the sister of the children of Stan. So, if Andrew and Beverly wereStan's children, then Harriet is the sister ofStan's children. So, when the trust's provisions are that the income goes to Harriet's living children upon her death, but wait, that's not correct.

Wait, the will says that the income is paid to the living children of Harriet only after the death of Stan's widow. So, if Harriet's sister is Andrew and Beverly, who are the children of Stan, then if Andrew and Beverly are dead, what about Harriet? If Harriet is the sister of Andrew and Beverly, and Andrew and Beverly are dead, then Harriet has Grace as her only child. So, the provisions would require the income to go to Harriet's living children, which would be Grace.

So, in this scenario, the life estate is forStan, and death of Stan's widow (probably Harriet, but I'm getting a bit confused) would trigger the next step. So, perhaps the rule is that the income is to go to Harriet's living children, which would be Grace. So, Grace would get the income.

But are there any issues with the Rule against Perpetuities here? Let me think. The question is whether the trust's provisions are perpetuities, and if they violate the Rule against Perpetuities.

The Rule against Perpetuities applies when a trust is intended to last forever, which is the case here because it's for life. So, the life estate is for life, which is a perpetuity. So, the Rule against Perpetuities affects the interpretation of such trusts.

The Rule states that the interest of a life estate must terminate if it would otherwise extend beyond the estate of the life estatee. So, if the interest is such that it would otherwise extend beyond the estate of the grantor, it is void.

In this case, the trust is intended to pay the income to Andrew and Beverly for life, which is the estate of the grantee (Stan's son, Stan). So, the life estate is for life, which is a perpetuity. So, the Rule against Perpetuities does not apply here because the interest is meant to last forever.

Wait, but the question is whether the provisions in the will would violate the Rule against Perpetuities. So, the life estate is for life, which is a perpetuity. Therefore, the Rule against Perpetuities doesn't apply here. So, the answer would not be A.

Wait, but the options have F as an option, which says "Yes, because there is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction that would prevent Grace from receiving the income from the trust."

Alternatively, the fact that the death of Stan's widow triggers the next step, which would pay to Grace, would perhaps involve a limitation on the perpetuity, or perhaps it's a peculiar interest.

Wait, but the Rule against Perpetuities deals with whether the life estate is a perpetuity. If the life estate is a life estate for life, it's a perpetuity. So, the Rule doesn't affect it.

So, the correct answer would not be A, because the Rule against Perpetuities doesn't apply. So, the life estate is for life, which is a perpetuity, so the Rule doesn't stop it.

But wait, the question is whether Harriet can prevail. The options are about whether Grace would get the income.

Another angle: the fact that the death of Stan's widow triggers the next step, which is to pay the income to Harriet's living children. So, the termination of the trust's interest occurs after the death of Stan's widow, which is in 2009. So, the life estate is for life, but the next step is triggered at the death of Stan's widow, which is after the life estate. So, this would be an interest that terminates only after a certain event (Stan's widow's death), which would be a limitation on the duration of the interest, but it's not a perpetuity. 

Wait, because the life estate is for life, but the next step occurs after the life estate, which would be a limitation. So, the life estate is not a perpetuity because it's triggered by a prior event (Stan's widow's death) that occurs after the life estate. So, this might be a peculiar interest, and the Rule against Perpetuities doesn't apply because peculiar interests are treated as interests in life.

Therefore, the Rule against Perpetuities doesn't prevent the income from being distributed to Grace because it's not a perpetuity. So, the answer would be F: Yes, because there is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction that would prevent Grace from receiving the income.

Wait, but let's think about the options again. Option F is "Yes, because there is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction that would prevent Grace from receiving the income from the trust." That makes sense because the Rule against Perpetuities doesn't apply here, so the life estate is a life estate for life, and it's followed by a limitation on the duration, so it's a peculiar interest. So, the will doesn't violate the Rule.

Wait, but the options give A as No, because of the Rule. So, if the Rule is not a factor, then F is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the Rule against Perpetuities does apply here because the life estate is for life, but the arrangement would constitute a life estate for life, so the Rule doesn't stop it. So, in that case, the answer would be F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the Rule against Perpetuities doesn't apply because the interest is a life estate for life. So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A: No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.

F: Yes, because there is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction that would prevent Grace from receiving the income from the trust.

So, the question is, does the Rule against Perpetuities apply here? In this case, the life estate is for life. So, the Rule against Perpetuities doesn't apply because it's a life estate for life, so it's a perpetuity. So, the answer is not A.

So, the correct answer would be F, which says that there's no statute preventing Grace from receiving the income.

The question revolves around the interpretation of the Rule against Perpetuities (RAP) in a trust involving Walter, his son Stan, and his sister Harriet. The trust is intended to distribute income to Stan for life, and upon Stan's death, the income is to be paid to his widow for life. Harriet, the sister of Andrew and Beverly (Stan's children), is the only surviving child of her sister, Grace, born in 2001, in 2009 after the plane crash. The key issue is whether Grace can recover the income from the trust.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Nature of the Trust**: The trust's life estate is for life, which is a perpetuity. The Rule against Perpetuities primarily concerns life estates intended to last forever, which is the case here. Therefore, the RAP does not prevent the life estate from existing.

2. **Provisions in the Will**: The will specifies that the income is to be paid to Harriet's living children only after the death of Stan's widow. However, the life estate is for Stan, and the death of Stan's widow triggers the next step. This creates a limitation on the duration of the life estate, but it is not a perpetuity.

3. **Perpetuities and the RAP**: The RAP applies to life estates intended to last forever. Since the life estate in this trust is for life, it is not subject to the RAP. The arrangement described in the will does not violate the RAP because it is not a perpetuity but a peculiar interest.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The RAP does not prevent the life estate from being for life, so there is no violation.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. Grace is not a guaranteed heir or estate; the trust does not specifically intend to give her income.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The death of Stan and Morgana does not necessarily trigger the provision for Grace's income.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The will clearly states the purpose for the income to be distributed.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The RAP does not prevent the life estate from being for life.
   - **Option F**: Correct. There is no statute modifying the common law that would prevent Grace from receiving the income, as the life estate is for life.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. Grace is not the only surviving child of Harriet; Andrew and Beverly were dead.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. There is no conflict with the will.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The RAP does not prevent the life estate from existing.

### Conclusion:
The life estate in the trust is for life, which is a perpetuity and not subject to the Rule against Perpetuities. Therefore, the correct answer is **F**.
