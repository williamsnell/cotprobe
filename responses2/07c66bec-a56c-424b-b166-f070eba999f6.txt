Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these concepts yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about stopping a 3000-lb automobile from a speed of 30 mi/hr, which is 44 feet per second. The coefficient of friction between the tires and the road is 0.70. They're asking for the stopping distance. The options are from A to J, with various distances.

Hmm, I remember that stopping distance has to do with how quickly you can decelerate. So, I think it involves the initial velocity, the acceleration (or deceleration in this case), and maybe the friction force. Oh right, because the friction provides the stopping force. So friction is what stops the car.

Wait, okay, so first, I need to find the acceleration. Because the stopping distance depends on how much the car slows down before stopping. But friction is involved, so I can find the deceleration from the friction force.

Frictional force formula: F_friction = μ * m * g, right? Where μ is the coefficient of friction (0.70), m is the mass, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. But wait, the mass is given in pounds, which is a force, not mass. Oh wait, I think I need to convert that to mass. Because 3000 lb is the weight, so mass m = F/g. So m = 3000 lb / 32.2 ft/s². Let me calculate that.

Wait, 3000 divided by 32.2. Let me see, 32.2 * 90 is 2900, because 32*90=2880, and 0.2*90=18, so 2900. So 3000-2900=100. 100 divided by 32.2 is about 3.1. So m≈93.1 lb/s²? Wait, no, wait, mass in slugs? Or maybe I should think in terms of weight.

Wait, no, because F = m * g. So m = F/(g) = 3000 lb / 32.2 ft/s². So m ≈ 93.16 lb-s²/ft. But wait, units might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can work in terms of force, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of acceleration.

Wait, another approach: The frictional force is F = μ * N, where N is the normal force, which equals the weight of the car. So N = m * g. So F_friction = μ * m * g. But F_friction is also equal to m * a, where a is the acceleration (negative because it's deceleration). So μ * m * g = m * a. Oh, wait, the mass m cancels out. So a = μ * g. Wait, that's a big simplification.

So a = 0.70 * g. Now, g is approximately 32.174 ft/s². So a = 0.7 * 32.174 ≈ 22.52 ft/s². So the deceleration is about 22.5 ft/s².

Now, I need to find the stopping distance. I remember the kinematic equation that relates initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and distance. The equation is:

v² = u² + 2 a s

Here, v is the final velocity (0, since it stops), u is the initial velocity (44 ft/s), a is the acceleration (which is negative here, so -22.5 ft/s²), and s is the distance we're trying to find.

Plugging in the numbers: 0 = (44)^2 + 2*(-22.5)*s. Let me compute that.

So, 0 = 1936 - 45 s. Because 2 * 22.5 is 45, and it's negative. So rearranging:

45 s = 1936 → s = 1936 /45. Let me calculate that. 45 * 43 = 1935, so 1936/45 is 43.022... approximately 43 feet.

Looking at the options, option C is 43 ft. So the answer should be C.

To determine the stopping distance of a 3000-lb automobile from an initial speed of 44 ft/s with a coefficient of friction (μ) of 0.70, we start by calculating the acceleration caused by friction. The frictional force is given by \( F_{\text{friction}} = \mu \cdot N \), where \( N \) is the normal force (equal to the weight of the car). Since \( N = m \cdot g \), the frictional force becomes \( F_{\text{friction}} = \mu \cdot m \cdot g \). 

The acceleration \( a \) is related to the frictional force by \( F_{\text{friction}} = m \cdot a \), and the mass \( m \) cancels out, leaving \( a = \mu \cdot g \). Substituting \( \mu = 0.70 \) and \( g \approx 32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), we find:

\[
a = 0.70 \cdot 32.174 \approx 22.52 \, \text{ft/s}^2.
\]

Next, we use the kinematic equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \) to find the stopping distance \( s \). Here, \( v = 0 \) (final velocity), \( u = 44 \, \text{ft/s} \) (initial velocity), and \( a = -22.52 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \) (deceleration). Substituting these values:

\[
0 = 44^2 + 2(-22.52)s.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
0 = 1936 - 45s \quad \Rightarrow \quad 45s = 1936 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = \frac{1936}{45} \approx 43.02 \, \text{ft}.
\]

The stopping distance is approximately \( 43 \, \text{ft} \), which corresponds to option C.
