Okay, so I've got this question about a camera lens setup. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

The question states that the lens system is equivalent to a thin converging lens with a focal length of 10 inches. The person is seated 50 inches away from the lens. I need to find two things: how far behind the lens the film should be located (which I think is the image distance), and how large the image will be compared to the object.

Hmm, right. For thin lenses, the thin lens equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. Oh wait, I should make sure about the signs. Since everything is on one side, I think the convention is that object distance is positive if it's on the same side as the incoming light. But wait, for thin lenses, the standard sign conventions are: for a converging lens, both object and image distances are positive if the object is on the same side as the incoming light. Wait no, wait—I think for a converging lens, the object is on the same side as the incoming light, so do is positive. The image is on the opposite side, so di is positive as well. Or wait, no: I think when the image is on the opposite side, di is positive. Wait, maybe I should double-check. Oh wait, no—actually, for thin lenses, the convention is that object distance is positive if the object is on the same side as the incoming light. Image distance is positive if the image is on the opposite side. So in this case, the object is on the same side as the incoming light (the object is in front of the lens), so do is positive. The image is behind the lens, so di is positive as well because it's on the opposite side.

So the given values: f = 10 inches, do = 50 inches. Let me plug into the equation.

1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/10 = 1/50 + 1/di.

Let's compute that. 1/10 is 0.1, 1/50 is 0.02.

So 0.1 = 0.02 + 1/di → 1/di = 0.08 → di = 12.5 inches.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, because 0.1 - 0.02 is 0.08 → 1/di = 0.08 → di = 12.5 inches. So the image is 12.5 inches behind the lens. So the answer for the first part is 12.5 inches, which would be option J, which has 14.0 in. Wait no, option J is 14.0 inches. Option I is 12.5, option J is 14.0. So the first part is 12.5 inches, which is option I. Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, I see:

Option I: 12.5 in, 0.250

So for the first part, the distance is 12.5 inches.

Now, the second part: how large will the image be compared to the object. I think that's the magnification factor, m. The formula is m = -di/do. The negative sign indicates the image is inverted, but for size comparison, the magnitude is needed.

So di is 12.5 inches, do is 50 inches.

m = -12.5 /50 → m = -0.25.

So the image is 0.25 times the size of the object. The negative sign means inverted, but the question asks how large the image is compared to the object, so the magnitude is 0.25. So the image is 25% the size of the object.

Looking at the options, let's see which one has di=12.5 and m=0.25.

Option I has di=12.5 and m=0.25, so the image is 0.25 times the size, which is 25% as big. So option I is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

1/f = 1/50 + 1/di → 1/di = 1/10 - 1/50 → 5/50 - 1/50 = 4/50 → 1/di = 2/25 → di = 25/2 = 12.5 inches. So yes, that's correct.

Magnification m = -di/do = -12.5/50 = -0.25. So the magnification is 0.25, so the image is 25% the size.

Looking at the options again.

Option I: 12.5 in, 0.250 → correct.

So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we use the thin lens equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

where \( f = 10.0 \, \text{in} \) is the focal length, \( d_o = 50.0 \, \text{in} \) is the object distance, and \( d_i \) is the image distance. Rearranging the equation to solve for \( d_i \):

\[
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{10.0} - \frac{1}{50.0} = 0.1 - 0.02 = 0.08
\]

Thus:

\[
d_i = \frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5 \, \text{in}
\]

The image is located 12.5 inches behind the lens, which corresponds to option I.

Next, to determine how large the image is compared to the object, we use the magnification formula:

\[
m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
m = -\frac{12.5}{50.0} = -0.25
\]

The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted, but for size comparison, the magnitude is \( 0.25 \). This means the image is 25% the size of the object.

Finally, we check the options. Option I provides \( d_i = 12.5 \, \text{in} \) and \( m = 0.25 \), which matches our calculations. Therefore, the correct answer is:
