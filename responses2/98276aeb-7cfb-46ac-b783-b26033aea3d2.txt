Okay, so I've got this question here about personal income and disposable income. Let me see if I can figure it out. I remember from my economics classes that personal income is the total income a household earns before any taxes and deductions. Disposable income is what's left after paying taxes and other necessary expenses, like savings.

The question gives me the household's consumption, savings, and taxes. Consumption is $5000, savings are $3000, and $2000 is paid out in taxes. Wait, so the total income is probably the sum of consumption and savings because those are the main sources of income. But wait, sometimes taxes are calculated based on income. Oh, right, the way it's phrased here, the $2000 is taken as taxes, which probably comes directly from the household's income. So personal income would be consumption plus taxes because those are the sources of income.

Wait, no. Wait, consumption is part of personal income. Wait, consumption is the total amount the household spends, including all their expenses. So personal income would be the sum of all income sources, like consumption, taxes, and other sources. Wait, but the question doesn't mention other income sources. Hmm, but in this case, the household's total income is their consumption plus whatever they receive from taxes. Wait, no, the problem says $2000 is paid out in taxes. So perhaps their personal income is the sum of consumption and taxes.

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way. Personal income is all the money they earn before taxes and other deductions. So if they earn $5000 in consumption and are also entitled to $2000 in taxes, then their personal income would be their total income from all sources, including taxes. But the problem doesn't mention other income sources, so perhaps the household's personal income is their consumption plus taxes.

Wait, but that's not usually how it works. Because, for example, if someone earns $1000 a month, their personal income is $1000, but their taxes could be $200, so their disposable income is $800. But in this question, the household's consumption is $5000, which would be the amount they spend, and the taxes they are entitled to, which is $2000. So perhaps their personal income is their total income from all sources, including taxes. But the problem doesn't specify other income sources. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the $2000 is their tax liability, which is taken from their personal income. So their personal income before tax would be the sum of their consumption and taxes. So personal income would be 5000 (consumption) + 2000 (taxes) = $7000. Then, their disposable income is personal income minus taxes. So 7000 - 2000 = $5000.

Wait, but another approach: personal income is the total income, which includes all sources. If the household's total income is their consumption plus all other income. But the problem doesn't mention other income sources like from other jobs or investments. So perhaps in this case, the personal income is their consumption plus taxes. So 5000 + 2000 = 7000.

Wait, but wait. The question says that savings are $3000. So perhaps the household's disposable income is their consumption minus savings, which is 5000 - 3000 = $2000. But that's not part of the question, though.

Wait, the question is asking for two things: a) personal income and b) disposable income.

So, to find personal income, perhaps it's consumption plus the amount they are entitled to in taxes. So 5000 + 2000 = 7000.

Then, disposable income is personal income minus taxes. So 7000 - 2000 = 5000.

Wait, but that can't be, because some sources of income are considered personal income, others are not. Let me think again. The personal income is the total income the household has, regardless of how it's earned. So if the household's only income is from consumption (5000) and taxes (2000), then their personal income is 7000.

Disposable income is personal income after paying taxes and other necessary expenses. So, if their personal income is 7000 and they have a tax bill of 2000, their disposable is 5000. But wait, in this case, the question mentions savings are 3000. So perhaps the savings are part of their personal income. So then, personal income is 5000 (consumption) + 2000 (taxes) = 7000. Disposable income would be 7000 - 2000 (taxes) - other expenses, but since the question says savings are 3000, perhaps that's part of their savings, which is a type of personal income. So maybe the disposable is 7000 - 2000 = 5000. But then, why is savings 3000? Because savings would be personal income minus other expenses. Hmm.

Wait another approach: the household's total income is what they receive from all sources. So if the household pays $2000 in taxes, the personal income is the sum of the money they receive. So if the household's income is 5000 (consumption) plus 2000 (taxes), because the tax is taken from their income, then personal income is 7000. Disposable income is 7000 - 2000 = 5000.

Wait, but that would make disposable income 5000, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says personal income: 8000, Disposable:5000.

Option B: 10k, 8k.

Option C: 10k,7k.

Option D:11k,9k.

Option E:7k,5k.

Option F:9k,6k.

Option G:8k,6k.

Option H:9k,7k.

Option I:11k,8k.

Option J:12k,10k.

Wait, I'm thinking personal income is 7000, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps personal income is the sum of consumption, taxes, and other income. But the question doesn't mention other income, so perhaps that's not the case.

Another way: personal income is the total amount the household earned, which is their consumption plus taxes. So 5000 + 2000 = 7000. But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps savings is an expenditure. So the household's personal income is the sum of consumption and savings. So 5000 + 3000 = 8000. Then, their disposable income is 8000 - 2000 (taxes) = 6000. But that's not an option either.

Wait, the problem says, 'the last character of your response must be the letter you've chosen.' So the options end with certain letters, and I have to pick the correct pair, with the last letter matching.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ends with A.

Option B: ends with B.

Option C: ends with C.

Option D: ends with D.

Option E: ends with E.

Option F: F.

Option G: G.

Option H: H.

Option I: I.

Option J: J.

So if my calculation for personal income is 7000, which is option E: E is 7000, and disposable is 5000, which is option E's disposable is 5000. So that would be option E: Personal income: $7000, Disposable income: $5000. So the letters would be 'E' and 'E'â€”but the options don't have that as a pair.

Wait, but looking again, the options are pairs of personal and disposable. So if personal is 7000, which is E, and disposable is 5000, which is E, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should compute the disposable income differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the $2000 tax is part of their personal income, so their personal income is 5000 (consumption) + 2000 (taxes) = 7000.

Disposable income is personal income minus taxes, which would be 7000 - 2000 = 5000.

But looking at the options, option E says personal:7000, disposable:5000. So the letters would be 'E' and 'E' for the options, but the options don't have such a pair. Wait, looking at the options:

Options:

A: personal 8000, disposable 5k.

B: personal 10k, disposable 8k.

C: personal 10k, disposable 7k.

D: personal 11k, disposable 9k.

E: personal 7k, disposable 5k.

F: personal 9k, disposable 6k.

G: personal 8k, disposable 6k.

H: personal 9k, disposable 7k.

I: personal 11k, disposable 8k.

J: personal 12k, disposable 10k.

Wait, none of these pairs have both as 7000 and 5000. Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the household's personal income is their consumption plus taxes, which is 7000. Their disposable income is 7000 minus taxes, which is 5000. So the correct pair would be personal:7000, disposable:5000. So looking for an option where personal is 7000 and disposable is 5000. But looking at the options, I don't see such an option. The closest is option E, which says personal:7000, disposable:5000. But wait, option E's disposable is 5000, which is correct. But option E says personal is 7000, disposable is 5000. So the pair is E: personal 7000, disposable 5000.

But let me check the question again. The question says: a) What is the personal income? b) What is the disposable income?

So, a) personal income is 7000, b) disposable is 5000.

Looking at the options, option E is personal:7000, disposable:5000. So the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but let me recheck the options. The options are:

E: personal:7000, disposable:5000.

Yes. So the correct pair is E.

To determine the personal income and disposable income, we analyze the given data:

1. **Personal Income**: This is the total income a household earns before taxes. The household's consumption is $5000, and $2000 is paid out in taxes. Assuming the household is eligible to receive taxes as part of their personal income, personal income is the sum of consumption and taxes: $5000 + $2000 = $7000.

2. **Disposable Income**: This is the amount of money a household has left after paying taxes and other necessary expenses. Disposable income is calculated as personal income minus taxes: $7000 - $2000 = $5000.

3. **Options Analysis**: Evaluating the options, the correct pair matches personal income: $7000 and disposable income: $5000, which corresponds to **Option E**.
