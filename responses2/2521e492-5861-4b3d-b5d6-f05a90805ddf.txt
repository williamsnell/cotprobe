The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I observe the great and wonderful mistake, both our own and our fathers, as to the civil powers of this world, acting in spiritual matters. I have read…the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground…"
Roger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652

Okay, so I have this question about the "First Great Awakening" and which historical event it responds to. Hmm, let me think about this. 

I remember that the First Great Awakening was a movement in the 17th century, right? It was a response to the Black Death, I think. The idea was to bring people together and start a new way of life. People were encouraged to leave their comfort zones, seek new opportunities, and resist the oppressive nature of the time.

The question is asking which event this awakening directly responds to. So I need to connect the First Great Awakening with one of the options provided.

Let me look at the options:

A: Existentialism
B: The Civil War
C: The Reformation
D: The Industrial Revolution
E: The Age of Exploration
F: Transcendentalism
G: Puritanism
H: Romanticism
I: The French Revolution
J: The Enlightenment

I'm trying to recall each of these. Existentialism was a movement that emerged in the 19th century, focusing on individualism and existential questions. The Reformation was about changing religious practices, the Industrial Revolution was about industrialization, the Age of Exploration was the 16th century, Transcendentalism was another 17th-century movement, Puritanism was a form of Protestantism, the French Revolution was a political event, and the Enlightenment was a broader thing, focusing on reason, science, and individualism.

Wait, the First Great Awakening was a movement that emerged in the late 17th century. It was a response to the Black Death and aimed to create a new society. So which event in the options is closest to that?

The Enlightenment was a broader movement, but I think the First Great Awakening was part of it. Or perhaps it's a different movement entirely. Wait, no, the First Great Awakening was a specific event that emerged in the 17th century as a response to the Black Death. It was a response to the perceived decay of society.

I think the Enlightenment was a broader term that included various movements and ideas, including the First Great Awakening. So the awakening is a response to the Enlightenment's principles.

Alternatively, the First Great Awakening is often considered part of the Enlightenment's broader movement. So the correct answer would be J: The Enlightenment.

Let me double-check. The First Great Awakening (FGA) was a movement that emerged in the late 17th century, responding to the Black Death and promoting individualism and social change. It was a significant part of the Enlightenment's spirit, so it's directly responding to the Enlightenment's ideas.

So the answer should be J: The Enlightenment.

The First Great Awakening, which emerged in the late 17th century, was a response to the Black Death and aimed to create a new society. This movement aligns closely with the Enlightenment's principles, which emphasized individualism and social change. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: The Enlightenment**
