Question:

Mrs. Walter gave an exam in a mathematics class of five students. She entered the scores in random order into a spreadsheet, which recalculated the class average after each score was entered. Mrs. Walter noticed that after each score was entered, the average was always an integer. The scores (listed in ascending order) were 71,76,80,82,and 91. What was the last score Mrs. Walter entered?

Options:

A: 82
B: 91
C: 71
D: The score that was the mode of the five scores
E: The score that made the average 75
F: 80
G: A score not listed among the five provided scores
H: The score that was the median of the five scores
I: 76
J: The score that made the average 79

Okay, so I've got this problem here where Mrs. Walter entered five math scores into a spreadsheet one by one. After each entry, the average was an integer. The scores are 71, 76, 80, 82, and 91. I need to figure out which score was entered last. The options are A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm. Let's break this down. The average after each entry is an integer. So, after the first score, the average is that score itself, which is obviously an integer. So the first score can be any of them, but all must be integers, which they are.

For the second entry, the average of the first two must be integer. So, the sum of the first two must be even because average is sum divided by 2, which has to be integer. So the sum of the first two must be even.

Similarly, for the third entry, the sum of the first three must be divisible by 3.

Fourth entry: sum divisible by 4.

Fifth: sum is obviously divisible by 5 because that's the total sum of all five.

Wait, but the total sum is 71 + 76 + 80 + 82 + 91. Let me calculate that.

71 + 76 is 147. 80 +82 is 162. 147 + 162 is 309. 309 +91 is 400. Oh, wait, 71+76=147, 80+82=162, and 91. 147+162=309, 309+91=400. So the total sum is 400. So the average after all five entries is 400/5=80. But wait, 400 divided by 5 is 80. So if the average after all five is 80, but the problem says that the average after each entry was integer. So it's possible that the last average is 80, which is an integer.

Wait, but the problem says that after each entry, the average was integer. So all steps from 1 to 5 must have integer averages.

So, let's think about the constraints:

1. First score: any of the five, since average is itself.

2. Second score: sum of first two is even.

3. Third score: sum of first three is divisible by 3.

4. Fourth score: sum of first four is divisible by 4.

5. Fifth score: sum is 400, which is 80*5, so it's integer.

So, I need to find the order in which the scores are entered such that each partial sum is divisible by the number of entries.

Let me approach this by considering the partial sums.

Let me list the scores: 71,76,80,82,91.

We need to arrange them in order a1, a2, a3, a4, a5 such that:

Sum1 = a1 is integer → always true.

Sum2 = a1 + a2 is even → so a1 and a2 must both be even or both be odd.

But looking at the scores, let's see:

71 is odd.

76 is even.

80 is even.

82 is even.

91 is odd.

So, the odd scores are 71 and 91; even are 76,80,82.

So, the first two numbers must be either both odd or both even.

But since there are only two odd scores (71 and 91), the first two can't be both odd because that's only possible if one is 71 and the other is 91. But wait, what if the first two are both even? Then the sum is even.

So, first two can be either both even or a mix of two odds if possible. But since there are only two odds, the first two can't have two odds unless they are 71 and 91, but that would make the sum 71+91=162, which is even. So that's possible.

Wait, but if the first two are both odd, then sum is 162, which is even. That's allowed.

So, the first two entries could be any combination of two odds or two evens.

But wait, let's think about the third partial sum.

After three entries, the sum must be divisible by 3.

Similarly, after four entries, the sum must be divisible by 4.

So, perhaps the most efficient way is to model this step by step.

Let me list all possible permutations and check which ones satisfy the conditions, but that might take too long because there are 5! = 120 permutations. Maybe there's a smarter approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for what's necessary for each step.

First, let's think about the second entry. The sum must be even. So, the first and second scores must be both even or both odd.

So, the first two can be:

Option 1: Both even. So from 76,80,82.

Option 2: Both odd, which are 71 and91.

Now, let's consider the third entry. Sum of three must be divisible by 3.

So, the sum of three. Let's see.

Another approach: The total is 400. So, after four entries, the sum is S4, which must be divisible by 4.

So, the fourth entry would be the fourth score, and the fourth partial sum is S4 = sum of four, which must be divisible by 4.

Similarly, the fifth score is 400, which is 80*5, so that's fine.

So, let's think about the fourth partial sum: S4 must be divisible by 4.

What is S4? S4 = sum of first four scores.

But S4 = sum of all five minus the fifth score.

We know the total sum is 400, so S4 = 400 - a5, where a5 is the fifth score.

So, 400 - a5 must be divisible by 4.

Which means that a5 must be congruent to (400 mod 4). Since 400 is divisible by 4, 400 mod4 is 0. So 400 - a5 ≡ 0 mod4 → a5 ≡0 mod4.

So, a5 must be a number that is divisible by 4.

Looking at the scores:

71: 71 /4 is 17 *4 +3 → mod4 is 3 → 71 mod4=3.

76: 76 /4=19 → 76 mod4=0.

80: 80/4=20 → mod4=0.

82: 82/4=20*4=80, so 82 mod4=2.

91: 91 = 22*4 + 3 → mod4=3.

So, the fifth score must be either 76 or 80, because those are the only ones that are 0 mod4.

So, a5 is either 76 or 80.

So, which of the options gives the fifth score as either 76 or80?

Looking at the options:

Options A:82 → not in the possible a5.

B:91 → not in possible.

C:71 → no.

D: mode → the mode is 82, I think. Wait, no: the mode is the most frequent number. But in this case, all are unique. So D is 82.

E:76 → yes.

F:80 → yes.

G: a score not in the list → no.

H: median, which is 80. So H would be 80.

I:76 → yes.

J: average 79 → but 79 is one of the numbers, but as the last score? Wait, 400 is the total sum. The average after five is 80, which is the correct average. But if the last score is 79, then S4 would be 400 -79=321. 321 divided by4 is 80.25, which is not integer. So that's not allowed. So J is 79 → which is not possible.

Wait, that means J is invalid.

So a5 must be either 76 or80. So the fifth score is either 76 or80. Let's note that.

So, the last score is either 76 or80. So looking at the options, option E is76, option F is80, option I is76, etc.

Wait, the options are:

A:82 → no.

B:91 → no.

C:71 → no.

D: mode (82) → would that be the case?

E:76 → possible.

F:80 → possible.

G: no.

H: median (80) → possible.

I:76 → possible.

J:79 → no.

So, the possible last scores are E, F, H, I. So, but need to find which one is the correct answer.

So, let's think about the options.

Now, let's see which of E, F, H, I (76,80,80,76) would be the correct last score.

Wait, but the last score is either 76 or80. So options E and F are possible.

Now, perhaps the problem is to find which one of these is the correct last score.

Let me think about the fourth entry.

Because S4 must be divisible by4. So S4 = 400 -a5.

So, if a5 is 76, then S4 = 400-76=324. 324 divided by4 → 81, which is integer. So that's okay.

If a5 is 80, then S4=400-80=320. 320 divided by4 is 80, which is integer. So that's also okay.

So both possibilities are valid, but the problem is to find which last score is correct.

Hmm. So, perhaps the problem is to find which of these options is the correct one. So, we need to find which of the options must be the last.

But maybe we can proceed by considering the possible a5 options.

Let me consider a5 being 76.

If a5 is76, then the fourth score is 80. Because S4=324, which is 81*4. So, the first four scores sum to324, which is 81*4.

So, the first four entries sum to324. The fifth is 76.

So, the first four scores sum to324.

Which four scores? Let's see: 71,76,80,82,91.

If 76 is the fifth, then the first four must be 71,80,82,91. Let's sum them: 71+80=151, 82+91=173. 151+173=324. So that's correct.

So, if a5 is76, the first four are71,80,82,91. So the order of first four must be such that each partial sum is divisible by the number of entries.

Wait, but that's a lot to check. But perhaps in this case, 71 is the first entry. Then, the sum after two must be even, then three must be divisible by3, etc.

Alternatively, let me see what the fourth score is in this scenario. The fourth score is80, which is S4=324.

So, the fourth score is80.

So, let's see, the first three scores must sum to a multiple of3.

Let me think: the first three scores: a1, a2, a3. Sum must be divisible by3.

Let me try possible combinations.

Wait, the first three scores could be any three of the four (71,80,82,91) since 76 is the fifth.

Wait, but the first four are 71,80,82,91.

So, if a1 is71, then a2 and a3 can be 80,82,91.

We need the sum of first two to be even, so a1 and a2 must be both even or both odd. Since71 is odd, a2 must be odd. So a2 can be 71 or91. But 71 is already used as a1.

Wait, no, a1 is71, a2 can be from the remaining three: 80,82,91.

Wait, but 80 is even, 82 even, 91 is odd. So, a2 must be odd. So a2 could be91.

Then, a1 is71, a2 is91. Sum is 71+91=162, which is even, good.

Then, a3 is80. So sum after three is 71+91+80=242. 242 divided by3 is 80.666... which is not an integer. So that's a problem.

Wait, that can't be. So that combination would not work.

Hmm. So perhaps a1 can't be71 if a2 is91 and a3 is80.

So, maybe a1 isn't 71 in this scenario. Let me try a1 being80.

Then, a2 must be odd. The remaining odds are 71 and91. So a2 could be71 or91.

Let's take a1=80, a2=71. Sum is 80+71=151, which is odd. That's not allowed because sum after two should be even. So that's a no-go.

Alternatively, a1=80, a2=91. Sum=80+91=171, which is odd. Not allowed. So a2 can't be91 either. Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, so if a1 is80, a2 can't be 71 or91 because both would make the sum odd. So, that's not possible. So maybe a1 can't be80 if a5 is76.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, in this scenario, a5 is76. So the first four are71,80,82,91.

So, let's see, the first four must be arranged such that the sum after each step is divisible.

Let me try a1=71.

Then, a2 must be odd, because 71 is odd. So a2 can be91.

Sum after two:71+91=162, which is even.

Sum after three:71 +91 +a3. We need this sum to be divisible by3.

So, 71 +91=162; adding a3 must make the total divisible by3.

162 is already 162/3=54, which is integer. So adding a3 must keep the sum divisible by3.

So 162 +a3 must be divisible by3. But 162 is divisible by3, so a3 must be divisible by3.

Looking at a3: the remaining numbers are80 and82.

Neither is divisible by3. 80 mod3 is 2, 82 mod3 is 1. So a3 can't be either. So that's a problem. So this arrangement won't work.

So, a1=71 and a2=91 is not possible because a3 can't be either 80 or82. So a1 can't be71 in this scenario.

Wait, but perhaps a1 is not 71. Let me try a1=91.

Then a2 must be odd. The remaining odds are71 and... Wait, the remaining numbers after a1=91 would be71,80,82. So a2 can be71 or 80 or82. Wait, but a2 must be odd to make the sum even after two entries. So the only odd is71.

So, a2=71. Sum after two:91+71=162, which is even, good.

Sum after three:91+71+a3. 162 +a3 must be divisible by3.

Again, 162 is divisible by3, so a3 must be divisible by3.

The remaining numbers are80 and82. None are divisible by3. So again, a3 can't be either. So this arrangement is impossible.

Hmm. So a1 can't be91 in this scenario either.

What about a1=80? Let's try that.

a1=80. Then a2 must be odd. The remaining odds are71 and91. So a2 can be71 or91.

Case1: a2=71.

Sum after two:80+71=151, which is odd. Not allowed. So invalid.

Case2: a2=91.

Sum after two:80 +91=171, which is odd. Invalid again.

So a1 can't be80 in this scenario either. So this seems like a dead end. So when a5 is76, the first four scores would have to be arranged in a way that each step meets the condition, but it's not possible.

Hmm. So perhaps a5 can't be76. Let's consider the other possibility: a5=80.

So the fifth score is80. Then, the sum of the first four would be 400-80=320. 320 is divisible by4, so that's fine.

So, the first four scores must sum to320, and each partial sum must be divisible by the count.

So, the first four are71,76,82,91. Let me check if that's possible.

Let me think about the possible orderings.

Let me consider the first two entries.

They can be any two, as long as their sum is even. So, possible pairs:

Both even:76,82.

Both odd:71,91.

So, let's try to arrange them step by step.

Case1: First two entries are76 and82.

Sum is76+82=158, which is even. Good.

Sum after two:158.

Now, the third score must make the sum divisible by3. So, 158 + a3 must be divisible by3. So a3 = (divisor -158) mod3.

Wait, let's compute 158 mod3. 3*52=156, so 158 mod3 is 2.

So, to make (158 +a3) mod3=0, a3 must be1 mod3.

Looking at the remaining scores:71,91, and the scores used are76,82.

So, the remaining numbers are71,91.

71 mod3 is 2 (3*23=69, 71-69=2), 91 mod3 is 1 (3*30=90, 91-90=1).

So, a3 must be91.

So, a3=91.

Sum after three:158 +91=249.

249 divided by3 is83 → integer. Good.

Now, sum after four must be320 (since 320-80=320). So, sum after four must be320.

But wait, 320 is the sum of the first four. Let me see what the fourth score is.

Wait, the first four scores are76,82,91, and the fourth score must be the remaining one, which is71.

So, a4=71.

Sum after four:76+82+91+71= 76+82=158, 91+71=162. 158+162=320. Correct.

So, let's check each step:

1. a1=76: sum=76 → divisible by1.

2. a2=82: sum=76+82=158 → 158/2=79 → integer.

3. a3=91: sum=158+91=249 → 249/3=83 → integer.

4. a4=71: sum=249+71=320 →320/4=80 → integer.

5. a5=80: sum=320+80=400 →400/5=80 → integer.

So this arrangement works! So, the last score is80. So optionE.

Wait, but what about other possible arrangements when a5=80?

Let me check another possible arrangement.

Another possibility: first two are76 and71.

Sum is76+71=147.

147 is odd, so the sum after two entries is not allowed. So that's invalid.

Another possibility: first two are82 and71.

Sum is82+71=153, which is odd. So that's invalid.

Another possibility: first two are76 and91.

Sum is76+91=167, which is odd. Invalid.

Another possibility: first two are82 and91.

Sum is82+91=173, which is odd. Invalid.

Another possibility: first two are76 and71, which we've already seen.

Wait, perhaps another arrangement. Let me think.

What if first two are71 and76. Sum is71+76=147, which is odd. So invalid.

Wait, perhaps first two are76 and82, which sum to158, which is even. So that's the only valid pair for the first two.

So, the arrangement I described earlier is the only possible way when a5=80.

So, the last score is80, which is optionE.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that a5 could be76 or80. But when I considered a5=76, the first four would have to be 71,80,82,91, but when I tried that, I couldn't find a valid arrangement. So, the only valid option is a5=80.

So the correct answer is E,76. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. The last score is80, which is optionE.

Wait, the options are:

A:82

B:91

C:71

D: mode (82)

E:76

F:80

G: score not listed

H: median (80)

I:76

J:79.

So, in my scenario, the last score is80, which is optionE or F. But in the arrangement I described, a5=80. So that's an option.

Wait, but another possibility: if a5=76, but that arrangement didn't work.

So, the only valid case is a5=80.

So, the correct answer is E:76 or F:80. Wait, no, in this scenario, the last score is80. So, the answer is F:80.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no, in this arrangement, the last score is80, which is optionF. So, the correct answer isF:80.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the last score could be76 or80. But when I tried a5=76, it didn't work, so only a5=80 works.

So, the correct answer is F:80.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me make a table.

In the scenario where a5=80, the arrangement is:

76,82,91,71,80.

Wait, wait, let me check the steps again:

1. 76 → sum=76.

2. 82 → sum=76+82=158.

3. 91 → sum=158+91=249.

4. 71 → sum=249+71=320.

5. 80 → sum=400.

Yes, that's correct. Each step gives the correct integer.

So, the last score is80, which is optionF.

So, the correct answer is F:80.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that optionE:76 is the correct answer, but that's not the case. So, no, the correct answer is F:80.

Wait, but earlier in the scenario, I thought that a5 could be76 or80, but only a5=80 worked. So, the correct answer is F:80.

So, the final answer is F:80.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me think again.

In the arrangement where a5=80, the last score is80, which is optionF.

But in the arrangement where a5=76, the last score is76, which is optionE.

But in the arrangement when a5=76, the first four scores are71,80,82,91. But that arrangement didn't work because the sum after three was249, which requires a3=91, but that leaves us with71, which can't be arranged without issues.

So, the only arrangement that works is when a5=80, and the last score is80.

So, the correct answer is F:80.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think of another approach.

Another approach: Let's consider the sum of all five scores is400.

Each step from1 to4, the sum must be divisible by the number of entries.

So, after two entries, sum must be even.

After three entries, sum must be divisible by3.

After four entries, sum must be divisible by4.

So, the sum after four entries must be divisible by4, and the sum after four entries is S4 =400 - a5.

So, S4 must be divisible by4. Thus, a5 must be congruent to400 mod4. Since400 is 0 mod4, a5 must be 0 mod4. So, a5 must be divisible by4.

Looking at the options, the numbers are76,80,71, etc.

So, 76 mod4 is 0, 80 mod4 is0, 71 mod4 is3, 82 mod4 is2, 91 mod4 is3.

So, the options that are divisible by4 are76 and80.

So, a5 must be either76 or80.

So, the possible last scores areE andF.

Now, we need to determine which one is correct.

Earlier, when I considered a5=76, I found that the arrangement didn't work because the sum after three entries couldn't be made correct. So, a5=76 is invalid.

But, when a5=80, the arrangement works.

So, the correct answer isF:80.

Thus, the answer is F:80.
</think>

The correct answer is F:80.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Possible Last Scores:**
   - The last score (a5) must be divisible by 4. From the options, 76 and 80 are divisible by 4.

2. **Check Each Possible Last Score:**
   - **Case 1: a5 = 76**
     - The first four scores must sum to 400 - 76 = 324.
     - Trying various orderings of the first four scores (71, 80, 82, 91) leads to inconsistencies, such as requiring a non-divisible score to achieve the sum for three entries.
     - Concludes that a5 cannot be 76.

   - **Case 2: a5 = 80**
     - The first four scores must sum to 400 - 80 = 320.
     - Arranging the first four scores as 76, 82, 91, 71:
       - Sum after 2 entries: 76 + 82 = 158 (even).
       - Sum after 3 entries: 158 + 91 = 249 (divisible by 3).
       - Sum after 4 entries: 249 + 71 = 320 (divisible by 4).
     - All sums are valid, confirming a5 = 80.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct answer is F:80.
