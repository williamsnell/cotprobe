Okay, so I've got this question here about the refracting power of a spherical surface. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. 

The question says it's a spherical surface with a radius of 20 cm. The materials on either side are air (n=1) and glass (n=1.5). I remember that refracting power is related to the curvature of the surface and the refractive indices. Oh wait, the formula for the power of a spherical surface... I think it's P = (n2 - n1)/(r), but wait, I might have that backwards. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, the formula for the focal length of a spherical surface is 1/f = (n2 - n1)/r. Oh right, because the curvature is 1/r. So, since f is the focal length, and power is 1/f, then P = (n2 - n1) / r, but if the radius is positive or negative. Wait, the sign depends on whether the surface is converging or diverging. For a convex lens (like a converging surface), the focal length is positive, and for a concave, negative.

But wait, in this question, the surface is separating air from glass. So, air is on one side and glass on the other. Let's think about the formula. I think the general formula for a spherical surface is P = (n2 - n1) / r. But wait, wait. Wait, if the surface is convex (like a convex lens), then it's positive. If it's concave, negative.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's double-check. The standard formula for a spherical surface is:

1/f = (n2 - n1)/r

But wait, another way to frame this is: when the surface is placed in medium, the formula is P = (n2 - n1) / r, where r is the radius of curvature. But I think the actual formula is 1/f = (n2 - n1)/r, so P = 1/f = (n2 - n1)/(r). Or wait, no, because f is in meters, and r is in meters. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. The formula is 1/f = (n2 - n1)/r. So f is the focal length, and power is 1/f. So P = (n2 - n1)/r. But wait, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again.

The general formula for a spherical surface (like a lens) is:

1/f = (n2 - n1)/r

So, for example, if you have a convex lens (which is a converging surface), then n2 (glass) is greater than n1 (air). So n2 -n1 is positive, and r is positive (for convex surfaces, the radius is positive). So 1/f is positive, so f is positive, meaning the focal length is positive. Which makes sense because for a converging lens, the focal length is positive.

Wait, but wait. Another way to look at it: if the surface is convex (positive radius), then the focal length is positive, which aligns with this formula.

So in this problem, the radius r is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. But wait, the radius is 20 cm, so r is 0.2 m. Wait, but in the formula, is r positive or negative? Because for a convex lens, the radius is positive, but if the surface is concave, it's negative. Wait, but in this problem, the surface is separating air and glass. So the first medium is air (n=1) and the second is glass (n=1.5). So the surface is between two media.

Wait, so the formula I'm using is: P = (n2 - n1)/r.

So, substituting the values:

n2 = 1.5, n1 =1.

r is 20 cm, which is positive because it's a convex surface (because it's going from air to glass, which is a convex surface).

So P = (1.5 -1) / 0.2 = (0.5) / 0.2 = 2.5 diopters.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. What does the radius being positive mean? Because if the radius is positive, the focal length (f) would be positive for a converging surface, which makes sense.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the sign conventions. I'm a bit shaky on the signs here. Another way to approach this is to use the lensmaker's formula: 1/f = (n2 - n1)/r, where r is the radius of curvature in meters. The sign is positive if the lens is converging (r positive) or diverging (r negative).

In this case, the glass is on the other side of the air, so the surface is converging. So r is positive.

Wait, the radius of a spherical surface is the radius of curvature of the surface. For a convex surface, it's positive. For a concave, it's negative. So, for the surface separating air and glass, the radius is 20 cm. But wait, the sign would depend on whether the surface is convex or concave relative to the incident medium.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the direction. If the incident medium is air (n=1) and the next medium is glass (n=1.5), then the surface is convex. Because when you go from a lower n to higher n, the surface is convex. So the radius is positive.

So, formula:

P = (n2 - n1) / r = (1.5 - 1) / (0.2 m) = 0.5 / 0.2 = 2.5 diopters.

Looking at the options, option H is 2.5 diopters. So the answer should be option H.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because the options don't have 2.5 as an option. Wait, no, option H is 2.5. So that's the correct choice.

To determine the refracting power of a spherical refracting surface separating air (n = 1) from glass (n = 1.5), we use the lensmaker's formula:

\[
P = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{r}
\]

Here:
- \( n_2 = 1.5 \) (refractive index of glass),
- \( n_1 = 1 \) (refractive index of air),
- \( r = 20 \, \text{cm} = 0.2 \, \text{m} \) (radius of curvature of the surface).

Substituting the values:

\[
P = \frac{1.5 - 1}{0.2} = \frac{0.5}{0.2} = 2.5 \, \text{diopters}
\]

The sign of \( r \) is positive because the surface is convex (the radius of curvature is positive). This corresponds to a converging surface, as the refractive index of glass is greater than that of air. Thus, the refracting power is \( 2.5 \, \text{diopters} \).
