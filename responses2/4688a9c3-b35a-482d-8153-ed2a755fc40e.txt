Question:

A widower was the record owner of a lemon grove, a 30-acre parcel of land in a suburb. The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, "Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, "Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. " Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, "No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. "Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer. Infuriated, the widower confronted the farmer and told him, "Listen, you lying sneak, if I catch you on my property again, I'm going to have you arrested for trespass. " The farmer replied, "Sorry, Pops, but I've acquired an easement over that roadway, and I'll continue to use it anytime I want. "Then, the widower institutes an appropriate action to enjoin the farmer from using the roadway across the lemon grove. If the widower prevails, it will be because the farmer's use was

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with easements and trespasses. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: There's a widower who owns a lemon grove. The widower lives in a farmhouse nearby the grove and uses it to grow produce. To the west of the grove is a 10-acre farm owned by a farmer. There's a four-lane highway that borders the grove to the east. The widower granted a deed to his daughter, naming her as the grantee. The deed granted an antebellum mansion to her, which is near the southern edge of the grove. The mansion is accessible by a little- used road that runs west to east from the grove's boundary to the highway's southern boundary.

The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession. Then, the daughter and the farmer fell in love, and they need to meet somewhere. To do that, the farmer has to drive over the little-used road to the highway, which is the east side. The farmer was also using that road to get to the mansion. When they were meeting, the widower asked the farmer if he was using the road for his pickup. But the farmer denied using it because he had an easement. The farmer then argued that he had an easement and should continue using it, while the widower tried to enforce a trespass by arresting him.

Now, the question is about why the widower would enforce the trespass. It's about the nature of the use of the property.

Let me recall the concepts involved here. Easements are a type of legal right granted to one party to use a piece of land. An easement doesn't automatically grant the right to use the land for a specific purpose, but it does indicate that the owner has an interest in that use. Easements can be either implied or constructive. 

In this case, the deed granted an easement for the mansion. The grantee (the daughter) recorded and took the deed, so she has the right to use the property. However, the father used the road to get to the mansion. Now, the father says he has an easement, so he's claiming to have the right to use it.

The key here is whether the easement is open or not. An open easement is one where the grantor has an interest in using the land for a specific purpose, which makes the easement more likely to be used for that purpose. If the easement is closed, it means the grantor doesn't have an interest in using it for that purpose.

In this scenario, the father's use of the road to get to the mansion is against the grantee's easement. The grantee has a right to use the property as per her deed. The father is arguing that he has an easement, so he's claiming to have the right to use the road for his own purpose, which is to meet his wife.

But wait, the grantee's deed is about the mansion, not the road. The father's use of the road is separate. So, the grantee's easement is for the mansion, not the road. The father is using the road in a way that benefits him (meeting his wife), not for the purpose described in the easement.

So, the father's use is not in the interest of the grantee. Therefore, his claim against the grantee is based on a separate easement. The grantee's easement doesn't apply to the father's use of the road.

But another angle: Did the grantee's easement implicitly grant the right to use the road? Well, an easement can be open or closed. If it's a closed easement, the grantor doesn't have an interest in using it for any purpose. If it's open, the grantor has an interest in using it for the purpose described in the deed.

In this case, the grantee recorded the deed, so she presumably has some ownership rights. But does that imply an open easement for the mansion? Or is it constructive? 

If the deed is open, the grantee has the right to use the property for the purpose of getting to the mansion, which is the purpose of her easement. So, the father's use of the road is in violation of her easement, which is open. So, he's claiming to have an easement, which is not necessary, and he's using the road for a purpose not covered by her grant.

Wait, but the father is using the road to meet his wife, which is a separate use. The grantee's easement is about the mansion. So, the father's claim is based on a separate easement.

So, the father's use of the road is against the grantee's easement, and that's what he's claiming. If the grantee's easement is open, then the father's claim is based on a different easement, not hers. So, his claim is open.

But the question is why the widower (the grantor) prevails. The options are about what the widower would say.

Let me look at the options:

A: not for a necessary purpose.
B: not open and notorious.
C: not hostile.
D: fraudulent.
E: not continuous.
F: not under claim of right.
G: permissive.
H: not for a legal purpose.
I: not exclusive.
J: under implied permission.

The question is, the widower's action is based on the father's use of the road. Why would he enforce it? Because the father's use is against the grantee's easement, which is open.

So, the father's claim is based on a separate easement. The grantee's easement is about the mansion, so the father's use is not for that purpose. So, the father's claim is not for a necessary purpose, which would be to use it for the purpose described in his easement. But the purpose isn't hers, so it's not necessary.

Wait, but the father's claim is about the road, which is not for the mansion. So, the father's use is against a separate easement, not the purpose she granted to the mansion.

But the question is, why does the widower prevail? The widower enforces the trespass because the father's use is against the grantee's easement. The grantee's easement is open, so the father's claim is without legal basis.

Wait, but the question is about what the widower would say. So, if the father is using the road for a purpose not covered by the grantee's easement, why would the widower care? The widower's action is because the father is using the road in a way that violates the grantee's easement.

So, the father's claim is based on a separate easement, not the grantee's. The grantee's easement is open, so the father's claim is open, and the widower will enforce because the father is using the road for a purpose not covered by his own easement.

So, the question is, what is the reason the widower prevails. The answer relates to whether the father's use is for a necessary purpose.

Wait, the father's use is to get to the mansion, not to use it for the purpose of the easement. So, the father is using it for a different purpose. So, the father's claim is for a purpose not covered by the grantee's easement. Thus, the widower will find that the father's claim is open, and enforce it.

But the question is, what is the reason the widower prevails. So, the widower's prevails because the father's use is against the grantee's easement, which is open. So, if the grantee's easement is open, the father's claim is without legal basis.

Looking at the options, option A is "not for a necessary purpose." The father's use is not for a necessary purpose (since he's using it to meet his wife, not to use it for the mansion). So, the father is using the road for a purpose not covered by the grantee's easement. Hence, the widower prevails because the father's claim is open.

Wait, but let's think again. The grantee's easement is for the mansion, not the road. The father uses the road to get to the mansion, but the father's claim is against the grantee's easement. So, the father's claim is not for a necessary purpose because it's not for the purpose of using the road for the mansion. Therefore, the father's claim is open, and the widower will enforce because he's using the road for a purpose not covered by the grantee's easement.

Therefore, the reason the widower prevails is that the father's use is against the grantee's easement, which is open. So, the answer is A: not for a necessary purpose.

Wait, but another angle: The grantee's easement is for the mansion. The father's use is to get to the mansion, so the father is using the road for the purpose of meeting his wife. But the father's claim is that he has an easement, so he's claiming to have the right to use it for his own purposes. So, the father's claim is about the road, not the purpose of the mansion.

So, the father is using the road to meet his wife, which is a separate use. The grantee's easement is about the mansion, so the father's claim is against a different easement.

Therefore, the father's use is not in her interest, and the widower will enforce because it's against the grantee's easement, which is open.

So, the answer is A: not for a necessary purpose.

The question revolves around the enforceability of a trespass by the grantor (widower) based on the father's use of a road. The father claims to have an easement over the road, which he uses to meet his wife. The grantee (daughter) recorded an easement for the property, including the mansion, but the father's use of the road is against the grantee's easement.

Key points:
1. The grantee's easement is for the mansion, not the road, so the father's claim is unrelated to this easement.
2. The father's use of the road is for a purpose not covered by his own easement, specifically to meet his wife, which is not necessary for the purpose described in his claim.
3. The grantee's easement is open, meaning the grantor (widower) has an interest in using the land for the purpose described in the deed. Therefore, the father's claim is based on a separate easement, not the grantee's.
4. The widower enforces the trespass because the father's use violates the grantee's easement, which is open, leading to a necessary purpose violation.
5. The correct answer is that the father's use is not for a necessary purpose, as it is not for the purpose of using the road for the mansion.
