Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the net price of a reclining chair. Let me try to break it down step by step. The chair has a list price of $635, and there's a trade discount of 16%. I need to find the net price, which is basically the amount the customer has to pay after the discount is applied.

Hmm, I remember that discounts can be calculated in different ways. There's the simple discount method and the trade discount method. Wait, I think the trade discount is calculated by subtracting the discount percentage from 100% and then multiplying that by the list price. Oh right, that's the formula. So, the net price is the list price multiplied by (1 minus the discount rate).

So the discount rate here is 16%. Let me write that down. First, I'll calculate 16% of 635. To find 16% of 635, I can multiply 635 by 0.16. Let me do that calculation. 635 * 0.16. Let's see, 635 * 0.1 is 63.5, and 635 * 0.06 is 38.1. Adding those together gives 63.5 + 38.1 = 101.6. So the discount is $101.60.

Wait, no. Hmm, wait a minute. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because 16% is the discount, so the net price would be the original price minus the discount, which is 635 - 101.6. Let me calculate that. 635 minus 100 is 535, then minus 1.6 more gives 533.4. So that's $533.40. Let me check what option that is. Looking back at the options, option E is $533.40. But wait, wait, is that correct?

Wait no, wait. Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Another way to think about it is that the net price is the original price multiplied by (1 - discount rate). So, 1 - 0.16 is 0.84. So 635 * 0.84.

Let me calculate that. 635 * 0.84. Hmm, 635 * 0.8 is 508, and 635 * 0.04 is 25.4. Adding those together, 508 + 25.4 = 533.4. So the net price would be $533.40. Looking at the options, option E is that. So, why am I getting confused?

Wait, but the options also have some other numbers. Let me double-check. Oh, perhaps I should check if the discount is applied correctly. Let me think again. The trade discount is 16%, so the net price is 84% of the list price. So 635 * 0.84 is indeed 533.40, which is option E. But wait, looking at the options, option E is $533.40, which is the net price. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, 635 * 0.16 is indeed 101.6. So 635 minus 101.6 is 533.40. Alternatively, 635 * 0.84: 635 * 0.8 is 508, 635 * 0.04 is 25.4, so 508 + 25.4 is 533.4. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, looking at the options again. The options are:

A: $476.20

B: $550.90

C: $487.40

D: $101.60

E: $533.40

F: $635

G: $503.60

H: $608.40

I: $734.60

J: $589.85

So the correct answer should be E: $533.40.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when discounts are applied, especially if it's a chain or something else, but in this case, it's a single discount. So I think E is correct.

The correct calculation for the net price after applying a 16% trade discount is done by multiplying the list price ($635) by (1 - 0.16) = 0.84. This results in $533.40, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
