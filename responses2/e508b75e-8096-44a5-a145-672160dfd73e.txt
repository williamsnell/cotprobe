Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in Japan who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months in 2015. The options are A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the statistics off the top of my head, but I know that bullying is a big issue in schools and society. I think in some countries, like the US, the rate is high, but in Japan, I believe it's lower. I remember reading somewhere that the number of bullied children might be lower, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I should think about how to approach this. Maybe I can recall some data points. I seem to remember that in Japan, the rate of bullying is lower compared to some other countries. For instance, I think in Germany, the rate is higher, but Japan is in the middle. Also, I've heard that in Japan, bullying is more of an issue for younger children, maybe 13-15 years old, because they're more likely to be bullied.

Looking at the options, the highest percentage is 96%, which seems too high. I don't think that many children report being bullied that often. The next highest is 86%, then 76%, 66%, 6%, 46%, 56%, and the lower ones are 36% and 26%.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the actual data was. Oh right, the 2015 Japanese National Population and Housing Survey (NPS) found that a certain percentage reported being bullied. I think in 2015, the percentage was around 46%. Or was it 66%? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the exact number might be 66%, but I'm not sure. Let me try to break it down. I think the numbers in the 13-15 age group in Japan are lower, but maybe 66% is a higher number than I thought. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the data with another country's statistics.

Wait, another approach: I can try to remember if I've heard this before. Oh, I think Japan's bullied children percentage was around 66% in 2015. Or maybe 56%? Hmm, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I might recall that the number was 66%, which is option F. So the answer would be F: 96%? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, 96% is too high. The options are from 26% to 96%, with F being 96%, which is the highest. I think the correct answer is 66%, which is F, but I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, no, I think I heard in 2015, the number was 66%, so F. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing it up with another year. Oh, maybe it's 66%? I'm a bit uncertain, but I'll go with F: 66% as the answer.
