Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the main difference between Hobbes and Locke regarding their views on certain social or political structures. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that both thinkers are involved in the debate over government and rights. Hobbes and Locke were part of the later Enlightenment and the revolution of ideas in 17th and 18th centuries. Their positions are often contrasted in discussions about the nature of society and governance.

Hobbes was a rationalist, which means he believed in the power of reason and the natural order of the world. He thought that a strong, unifying social contract, like a social contract, was essential to establish a stable society. He rejected the idea of a natural state and believed that only through a contract could individuals be bound to each other and to the state. So Hobbes was really into the idea of the "state as an institution" and the necessity of social contracts for security and order.

On the other hand, John Locke was more pragmatic. He believed that the state was not necessary for a stable society because the people themselves had the power to organize and maintain order. Locke's key idea was the "natural rights" theory, where each person is free to pursue their own rights, like the right to life, property, and religion. He thought that the state was a luxury and that people would act in their own self-interest, rather than under the threat of a larger structure. Locke also thought that the government was an instrument of power rather than a necessary part of society.

So the main difference would be in their views on the necessity of the social contract and the role of the state. Hobbes believed the state was necessary, because it was an institution that would ensure security and individual rights. Locke, however, thought that the state wasn't necessary because the people could organize themselves to manage their own rights without external control.

Looking at the options:

Option A: They differ in their views about the necessity of a social contract. That sounds right because Hobbes talked about the state needing to be in place, while Locke didn't think it was necessary, thinking the people were in charge.

Option B: disagree about the role of law in society. Well, both would have some role, but I think the main difference is more about the social contract and state. The law was important but perhaps not the main point.

Option C: Contrasting roles of religion. Both would have some, but again, the primary difference is not religion but social contract issues.

Option D: Different ideas about education. Both might have some views, but again, the main point is their views on the state and social contract.

Option E: Different perspectives on economic policies. Both would have some, but the primary difference is about the state and contract.

Option F: Contrasting views on contractual obligations. They do discuss obligations, but it's more about the necessity and the structure.

Option G: differ in their account of life before the social contract. That's more about individual rights as per Locke, which isn't the main point.

Option H: Their views on individual rights. That's a separate issue, like Locke's natural rights.

Option I: Different views on government structure. Hobbes had the state as a necessary institution, while Locke thought it's a luxury. So this is the correct answer because they differ in the structure and role of the government.

Option J: Different attitudes towards courts. Their views on courts might be more related to individual rights (Locke) and the state (Hobbes), but it's not the main difference.

So the key difference is their views on the necessity of a social contract and the role of government. The most important point is that Hobbes emphasized the state, while Locke didn't think it was necessary. Therefore, the correct answer is option I: They disagree on the structure and role of government in society.

The principal difference between Hobbes and Locke lies in their views on the necessity of the social contract and the role of the state in society. Hobbes believed that a strong social contract was essential, while Locke thought that the state was unnecessary as the people could manage their own rights. This makes the correct answer:

**I: They disagree on the structure and role of government in society.**

Answer: I
