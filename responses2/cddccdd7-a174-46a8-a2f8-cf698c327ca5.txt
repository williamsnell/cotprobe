Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the selling price of an item that cost him $18.20. The markup is 40% based on the selling price. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that markup is the amount added to the cost price to get the selling price. But wait, it's based on the selling price, not the cost price. So it's a bit different from a markup on the cost. I think the formula for markup when it's based on the selling price is selling price minus cost equals markup. But in this case, the markup is 40% of the selling price.

Let me write that down. Let's call the selling price 'S'. The cost is $18.20. The markup is 40% of S, which would be 0.40 * S. So, the selling price equals the cost plus the markup. So:

S = Cost + Markup
S = $18.20 + 0.40 * S

Wait, that can't be right. Because if I solve for S, I get:

S = 18.20 + 0.40S
Subtract 0.40S from both sides: S - 0.40S = 18.20
That's 0.60S = 18.20
So, S = 18.20 / 0.60

Let me calculate that. 18.20 divided by 0.60. Hmm, 0.60 goes into 18.20... Well, 0.60 is the same as 3/5. So 18.20 divided by 3/5 is the same as 18.20 multiplied by 5/3.

Wait, 18.20 * 5 = 91, and 91 divided by 3 is approximately 30.333... So around $30.33.

Looking at the options, C is $30.33. So the answer should be C.

The selling price is calculated by dividing the cost by (1 - markup percentage). For a 40% markup on S, the equation is S = 18.20 / 0.60 = $30.33. The correct option is C.

Answer: C
