Okay, so I've got this question about Iran Contra and a poll from 1987. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking about the percentage of Americans in Iran Contra in 1987 who believe Reagan was withdrawing information. The options are A to J, with numbers varying from 60% down to 25%. I remember that Iran Contra was a drug empire, but I don't think it involved any significant events around 1987 related to Reagan.

Wait, Reagan was the president in the late 1980s, right? So 1987 is just a few years before that. I think the Iran Contra scandal happened after the 1980s, maybe in 1986 or 1987. The main point of contention, if I recall, was whether the empire was still active.

In 1987, Iran Contra was still a thing. The main issue was whether the empire was still active and what information they were releasing. Some believed they were withdrawing info, while others thought they were still active.

I think the poll was conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in 1987. I believe the question is referencing a 1987 poll where the percentage was around 50%. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the years or the specific percentage.

Looking at the options, 50% is an option (I). I remember reading that in 1987, about half of the surveyed Americans believed Reagan was withdrawing information. The other half thought the empire was still active. So the correct answer would be I: 50%.

The correct answer is I: 50%.
