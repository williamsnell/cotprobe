Okay, so I'm looking at this question about transformations of data when converting total number of errors to percent correct or vice versa. Hmm, the question is asking what type of transformation is being performed. The options include things like exponential, sinusoidal, polynomial, quadratic, etc.

I remember that transformations in data often refer to how variables are scaled or changed. When you're talking about percent correct, that's a transformation of the total number of correct answers. Let's think about this.

If you have the number of errors, which is the total number minus correct answers, then converting that to percent correct would involve dividing by the total possible. So, for example, if there are 20 questions and someone got 15 correct, 5 errors. 5/20 is 25%, which is linear in this case because it's a proportion.

Wait, but what's the transformation? If you have total errors E and total possible P, then percent correct is E/P * 100. So if you have E and P, perhaps you're considering E/P as the variable. So when you calculate that, it's a ratio, which is linear only if both E and P are linearly related. But wait, no, if E is the independent variable and P is fixed, then E/P would be a linear transformation because it's E multiplied by (1/P), which is a constant. So that's linear.

Alternatively, if you're considering the percentage of correct answers, that's (P-E)/P *100 = 100 - (E/P)*100. So that's a linear transformation as well because it's a constant minus a linear term. So both converting to percent correct and vice versa would involve linear transformations.

Wait, but another way: suppose you have the number of correct answers, C. Then E = P - C. So percent correct would be (P - C)/P *100 = 100 - (C/P)*100. That's also a linear transformation because it's a constant minus a multiple of C.

So if you're converting the number of errors (E) to percent correct, it's a linear transformation. Similarly, converting from C to percent correct is also linear. So the question is, when you convert E to percentage, or C to percentage, you're doing a linear transformation.

Looking at the options, option I is linear. So the answer should be I.

When converting total number of errors to percent correct or vice versa, the transformation is linear because it involves scaling by a constant factor (either dividing by the total or multiplying by 100). This corresponds to option I: Linear.

Answer: I
