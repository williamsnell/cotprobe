Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let's see what the question is.

The scenario is that Berg offered to sell a parcel of land to Jones for $75,000 in cash. The offer was made by e-mail on March 1. Jones responded on March 10 with a letter saying he accepts, but wants to pay $25,000 in three equal installments over the next three years. Berg received the letter on March 15. The question is about whether a contract was formed based on these interactions.

Hmm, so the issue here is whether the contract was formed when the installment was added. I remember that in contract law, an offer and a acceptance can form a contract only if the acceptance is complete. If someone makes an offer and then a counter-offer, that can create a contract.

Wait, so let me think. An offer is made by Berg, and Jones responds on March 10. The response is a counter-offer. Because the counter-offer is a request to accept, it can be seen as a condition for the offer to take effect. So when the counter-offer is added, it completes the offer and creates a contract.

But wait, what's the timeline? The offer was March 1, the response March 10. Then the installment on March 15. So, the offer was in writing on March 1, and the response was March 10.

In contract law, when a party offers something and then makes a counter-offer (like a condition), the counter-offer is part of the contract. So, the offer is March 1, the acceptance is March 10, the counter-offer is March 10. So, the contract is formed on the acceptance date, which is March 10, unless the counter-offer is accepted before March 10. But in this case, the counter-offer is March 10, so it's accepted on that day.

Wait, but sometimes there's the issue of when the counter-offer is made. If it's made on March 10, and the offer was on March 1, then the contract is formed on March 10, because the counter-offer is part of the contract. So, the contract is formed when the counter-offer is accepted, which is March 10.

So looking at the options, option B says the contract was formed on March 10. That makes sense because the counter-offer is accepted on that day, completing the offer and creating the contract.

But wait, what about the timing of the response. The response is March 10, and the offer is March 1. So the contract is formed on March 10, the day when the counter-offer is accepted. So the contract is formed on March 10.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another way to think is that the offer is March 1, and the counter-offer is March 10. So the contract is formed when the counter-offer is accepted, meaning March 10. So yes, the contract is formed on March 10.

Looking at the options, option B says the contract was formed on March 10. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. There's a concept called a "counter offer." When one party offers something and the other responds by making a counter-offer, that counter-offer can be seen as a condition for the offer to take effect. So the offer is made by Berg, and then Jones responds by making a counter-offer. So the contract is formed on March 10 because that's when the counter-offer is accepted.

So the correct answer is B: Formed on March 10.

The contract was formed on March 10 because the counter-offer by Jones on that day completed the offer and created a binding contract. 

Answer: B
