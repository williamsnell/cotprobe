Okay, so I've got this question about John Kenneth Galbraith and his concept of 'countervailing power'. Hmm, I need to figure out what that means. Let me think. I remember that Galbraith was a economic theorist, right? So he probably came up with some economic concepts.

The question gives me the options from A to J. I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option carefully.

Option A: Countervailing power is the economic control exercised by trade unions. I think trade unions do control, but I'm not sure if that's Galbraith's concept. Galbraith's work was on price regulation, not specifically about trade unions.

Option B: Countervailing power is the influence consumers have through boycotts and advocacy. Wait, that sounds familiar. I recall that Galbraith talked about how consumers can exert influence through things like strikes or producing goods in quantities they don't need, which is a form of regulation. So this might be his concept.

Option C: Eliminates need for government regulation. That doesn't seem right. Galbraith was about regulating businesses, not eliminating it altogether. So probably not C.

Option D: Competitive advantage of large corporations. That's more about why big companies exist in the first place, not about their ability to counteract government regulation.

Option E: Self-regulation by corporations. I think that's more about what big companies do to prevent government actions. Perhaps Galbraith was looking into that, but not the term itself.

Option F: Restraints on giant corporations without competition. This sounds like market regulation or something. But isn't that more about state intervention? Maybe not Galbraith's main point.

Option G: International regulations on multinational corporations. That's a different angle, probably not the same as countervailing power.

Option H: Government authority to nationalize large corporations. Nationalization is a government action, not something Galbraith would have focused on as a concept.

Option I: Power held by small businesses. That doesn't align with what I know about Galbraith's work. He focused on regulating big corporations, not the power of small ones.

Option J: Balancing effect of monopolies. Monopolies can be bad for competition, but again, that's more about market structure than regulation.

Wait, so going back to option B. I think Galbraith's concept was about how consumers can influence prices through things like strikes, boycotts, or producing more than they need. That's countervailing power. It's about the ability of consumers to affect prices without big corporations. So when big companies set prices, consumers can supply more, which lowers prices. That's countervailing power as the ability to counteract government's regulation.

So the correct answer should be B. The countervailing power is the influence consumers have through things like boycotts and advocacy.

The correct answer is:

**B: Countervailing power is the influence consumers have through boycotts and advocacy.**

**Explanation:**
John Kenneth Galbraith's concept of "countervailing power" refers to the ability of consumers to exert influence through actions like strikes, boycotts, and advocating for their demands, which can counteract government regulation. This concept highlights how consumers can change prices without large corporations' regulation, thus countervailing the effects of such regulation.
