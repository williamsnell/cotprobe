Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the average velocity of cesium atoms emerging from a hole in an oven. The oven is heated to 500°C. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

First, I remember that average velocity in this context probably refers to the root mean square (rms) velocity of the atoms. Because when a gas is introduced into a vacuum, the atoms move at their own speeds, but the rms velocity is the average speed considering the distribution of velocities. So I should probably use the rms velocity formula.

The formula for rms velocity is v_rms = sqrt(3kT/m), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and m is the mass of a single atom. Alternatively, I think there's another version using the molar mass and Avogadro's number. Oh wait, right, the formula can also be written as v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass of the gas.

So let me get the numbers right. The oven is at 500°C. I need to convert that to Kelvin. Oh right, Kelvin is Celsius + 273.15. So 500 + 273.15 is 773.15 K. So T = 773.15 K.

The molar mass of cesium, Cs, is about 132.91 g/mol. Oh wait, but the gas constant R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) when using SI units. But since the formula uses R in terms of (molar mass in kg), I need to adjust. Let me think about the correct formula.

Wait, the correct formula is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/(M)), where M is the molar mass in kg. Since R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is equivalent to 8.314 m²·s⁻²·K⁻¹·mol⁻¹, because 1 J = 1 m²·kg/s². So M in kg is 132.91 g = 0.13291 kg/mol.

So plugging in, R is 8.314, T is 773.15, M is 0.13291 kg/mol.

Let me compute the numerator: 3 * R * T = 3 * 8.314 * 773.15.

Wait, wait, let me compute that step by step. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate each part.

Compute 3 * R * T:

3 * 8.314 = 24.942.

24.942 * 773.15 ≈ ?

Hmm, 24.942 * 700 = around 17,460.

And 24.942 * 73.15 ≈ let's calculate 24.942 *70= 1745.94, 24.942 *3 =74.826, and 24.942*0.15=3.7413. So adding 1745.94 +74.826=1820.766 +3.7413=1824.5073. So total is approx 17460 + 1824.5073 = 19284.5073. So 3RT is about 19284.5.

Divide by M: 0.13291.

So 19284.5 / 0.13291 ≈ let's see. 19284.5 / 0.13 ≈ 148,342.3, but more accurately, 19284.5 / 0.13291 ≈ let's see. Since 0.13291 is about 1/7.53, so 19284.5 *7.53 ≈ 19284 *7.53. Let me compute 19284 *7 =135, 19284 *0.5=9642, 19284 *0.03=578.52. So 7+0.5+0.03=7.53. So 135,000 + 9642 =144642, +578.52=145,220.52.

Wait, but I'm trying to compute 19284.5 /0.13291. Wait another approach: 0.13291 is approximately 1/7.53, so 19284.5 *7.53 ≈ ~145,220.5. So 19284.5 divided by 0.13291 is approximately 145,220.5. So sqrt of that is sqrt(145220.5).

What's sqrt(145220.5)? Let's see. 380^2 is 144400. 380^2=144400. 381^2= (380+1)^2=380² +2*380*1 +1= 144400 +760 +1=145161. Oh, wait, our number is 145220.5. So 381^2 is 145161. The difference between our number and 145161 is 145220.5-145161=59.5. So 381²=145161, 382²=145924. So 381.5^2 would be?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute sqrt(145220.5). Let me see, 381^2=145161. 382^2= (381+1)^2=381² + 2*381 +1= 145161 + 762 +1=145924. So 145161 is 381², 145220 is a bit higher. Let me compute 381.4^2: 381^2 is 145161. 0.4^2=0.16, 2*381*0.4=2*381*0.4=304.8. So (381 +0.4)^2= 145161 +304.8 +0.16 = 145465.96. No, that can't be right because 381.4 squared is way higher than 145k. Wait a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me think.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach it differently.

Compute 145220.5 / (381)^2. Wait, 381^2 is 145161. So 145,220.5 -145,161=59.5. So the difference is 59.5. So sqrt(145,220.5) is approximately 381 + (59.5)/(2*381) ) using linear approximation.

Because sqrt(a + da) ≈ sqrt(a) + da/(2 sqrt(a)).

So a =145161, da=59.5.

sqrt(a) =381.

So sqrt(a + da) ≈381 +59.5/(2*381) )=381 +59.5/(762)= 381 + 0.0775 ≈ 381.0775 m/s.

Wait, that's the square root of 145220.5. So v_rms ≈381.08 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is 300 (option C) or 250 (option G). Hmm, but my calculation gives about 381 m/s. That's way higher than any of the options. That suggests I might have made a mistake in the approach. Because the options are all in the 100s, like 125, 175, etc.

So perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe I should use the formula with the molar mass in kg and the R in J/(mol·K).

Wait, another approach: Let's use the formula v_rms = sqrt( (3 k T) / M ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T the temp in K, and M the molar mass in kg/mol.

So k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

T=773.15 K.

M=0.13291 kg/mol.

So compute 3*k*T =3 *1.380649e-23 *773.15.

Compute 3 *1.380649e-23 =4.141947e-23.

Multiply by 773.15: 4.141947e-23 *773.15 ≈ let me compute 4.141947 *773.15e-23.

4 *773.15=3092.6; 0.141947 *773.15≈ 109.6. So total ≈3092.6 +109.6=3202.2. So 3.2022e-20.

Then divide by M (0.13291 kg/mol): 3.2022e-20 / 0.13291 ≈2.404e-19.

Wait, but v_rms is sqrt(2.404e-19) m²/s². sqrt(2.404e-19) is approximately sqrt(2.404) * 1e-9.5.

Wait, sqrt(2.404) is about 1.550. And 1e-9.5 is 3.16e-10. So 1.55 * 3.16e-10 ≈ 4.91e-10 m/s. That's 0.000000000491 m/s, which is 4.91e-10 m/s. That's way lower than any of the options. So this can't be right either.

Wait, that's way too low. So either I'm using the correct formula but making a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps using a different approach altogether. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the mass of a single atom, not the molar mass.

Wait, yes, perhaps I used the molar mass instead of the atomic mass. The problem is, when using the formula with the molar mass, I get a very small velocity, which doesn't match the options. So I must have used the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the formula for the speed of a single atom, not the average speed. Wait, but the average speed is the rms speed. So another approach: perhaps using the kinetic theory, the average speed (rms) is sqrt(3RT/M), but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Or perhaps I should be using the root mean square speed formula correctly.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check the formula. The correct formula for the rms speed is v_rms = sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), wait no, I think I'm mixing up different expressions. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with the Boltzmann constant. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. The correct formula is v_rms = sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), but wait, that's for the root mean square speed when considering the speed of gas molecules. Wait, no, that's for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which gives the speed distribution. But the average speed (rms) is sqrt(3 k T / M).

Yes, that's correct. So the formula is v_rms = sqrt( (3 k T) / M ), where M is the molar mass.

But when I calculated that, I got around 381 m/s, which is way higher than the options. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, wait! I'm getting confused between K and other units. Oh! Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the formula for the average speed (which is the same as rms, except for a factor of sqrt(2/π)).

Wait, but that's not the case. The average speed (u) is (3/√(8π)) * v_rms, but that's the average speed for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. But in this case, the question is about the average velocity, which for a continuous distribution is zero because of symmetry. Wait, no, that's the average velocity vector, but the average speed is non-zero.

Wait, but that's not correct. The average velocity (vector) is zero because the distribution is symmetric, but the average speed is the rms.

So the question is about the average velocity, which is the rms speed. So perhaps I'm still on the right track, but the numbers are way off. So maybe the options are wrong, or I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me compute each option's square and see which might be close to 3RT/M.

Wait, let's compute each option's square and compare to 3RT/M.

Wait, but 3RT/M as calculated earlier is about 145,220 m²/s². So the square of each option:

Option A: 125 m/s → (125)^2 =15,625 m²/s². Not near 145,220.

Option B: 175.5 → (175.5)^2 ≈30,800. Not near 145,220.

Option C:300 → 90,000. Not near.

Option D:100 →10,000.

Option E:160 →25,600.

Option F:225 →50,625.

Option G:150 →22,500.

Option H:275 →75,625.

Option I:250 →62,500.

Option J:200 →40,000.

Looking for which option's square is closest to 145,220.

Hmm, none of the options have a square close to 145,220. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should use the molar mass in kg correctly. Let me recalculate 3RT/M.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 m²/s²·K⁻¹·mol⁻¹.

T=773.15 K.

M=0.13291 kg/mol.

So 3RT =3 *8.314 *773.15 = let's compute 8.314 *773.15 first.

8 * 773 = 6,184; 0.314 *773 = approx 243. So total ~6,427.

Multiply by 3: 6,427 *3 =19,281.

Wait, wait, actually, 8.314 *773.15: let me compute more accurately.

773.15 *8 = 6,185.2, 773.15 *0.314:

0.3 *773.15=231.945, 0.014 *773.15=10.8241. So 231.945+10.8241=242.7691.

So 8.314 *773.15 =6,185.2 +242.7691=6,427.9691.

Multiply by 3: 6,427.9691 *3 =19,283.9073.

Divide by M=0.13291 kg/mol.

So 19,283.9073 /0.13291.

Let me compute 0.13291 *145,200 = ?

Wait, 0.13291 *145,200 =13291 *145.2 /1000.

But perhaps it's easier to compute it as:

145,200 *0.13291 = (145,200 *0.1) ) + (145,200 *0.03291).

145,200 *0.1 =14,520.

145,200 *0.03291 = let's compute 145,200 *0.03=4,356, 145,200 *0.00291= approx 423. So 4,356 +423=4,779.

So total is 14,520 +4,779=19,299. So 0.13291 *19,299 =19,299 *0.13291 =19,299 *0.1=1,929.9; 0.03 *19,299=578.97; 0.00291 *19,299≈56.1. Summing:1,929.9+578.97=2,508.87 +56.1=2,564.97.

So 0.13291 *145,200 = 19,299, which is higher than 19,283. So 19,283 /0.13291 = approximately 144,800.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 0.13291 *144,800 =19,274. So 144,800 *0.13291=19,274, which is less than 19,283. So 144,800 + (19,283-19,274)/0.13291 =144,800 +9/0.13291≈144,800 +67.5=144,867.5.

So the square root is approximately 144,867.5, so v_rms≈144.87 m/s.

But the options don't have this number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but when using the formula for the average speed in the kinetic theory, the correct formula is v_rms = sqrt( (8 k T)/(π M) ), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no, that's for the average of the square of the velocity distribution. The average speed is sqrt(3 k T/M) multiplied by sqrt(2/π), which comes from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. So the average speed is u_avg = sqrt( (8 k T)/(π M) ), but the rms speed is v_rms = sqrt( (3 k T)/(M) ).

So in that case, my initial approach was correct, but the numbers are way off from the given options. That suggests that perhaps the correct approach is different, or perhaps the problem is intended to use another formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the average speed as v_avg = (k T)/(π M), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is v_avg = sqrt( (k T)/(π M) ), but that doesn't make sense because that would give a smaller value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the atoms are moving at a certain speed, and that I should use the formula v_avg = sqrt( (3 k T)/M ), but perhaps the problem uses k =1.38e-3 J/(mol·K), but that's not correct. Wait, no, the correct Boltzmann constant is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let's compute v_rms using the formula sqrt( (8 k T)/(π M) ), but I'm not sure if that's correct either.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula v_avg = sqrt( (3 k T)/(M) ), but that would be the same as the initial approach. But again, I'm not getting the correct numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should check online for the correct formula and compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the atoms' speed, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average speed using the formula v_avg = sqrt( (3 k T)/(M) ), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 3RT/M. Let me double-check that.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the velocity of a single atom using the formula v = sqrt( (3 k T) / M ). Let's compute that.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

T=773.15 K.

M=0.13291 kg/mol.

So:

v = sqrt( (3 *1.38e-23 *773.15) / 0.13291 ) )

Compute numerator inside sqrt: 3 *1.38e-23 *773.15.

3 *1.38e-23 =4.14e-23.

4.14e-23 *773.15 = let's compute 4.14e-23 *7.7315e2.

4.14e-23 *7.7315e2 =4.14 *7.7315e-21.

Compute 4.14 *7.7315: approximately 32.13.

So 32.13e-21 =3.213e-20.

Divide by M=0.13291 kg/mol:

3.213e-20 / 0.13291 =approx 2.419e-19.

So v= sqrt(2.419e-19) = 4.919e-10 m/s.

That's 4.9e-10 m/s, which is 0.00000000049 m/s. Way too small.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, 3 *1.38e-23 =4.14e-23.

Multiply by 773.15: 4.14e-23 *773.15 =4.14 *773.15e-23.

4.14 *773.15: Let's compute 773 *4 =3092, 773 *0.14=108.22. So 3092 +108.22=3200.22. So 3200.22e-23 =3.20022e-20.

Divide by 0.13291: 3.20022e-20 /0.13291 =approx 2.409e-19.

So sqrt(2.409e-19) =4.91e-10 m/s.

Still the same result, which is way too low. So if this is the case, perhaps the options are incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I should have used the formula for the average speed correctly. Let me see.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should use the formula for the average speed as v_avg = sqrt( (8 k T)/(π M) ), but that's the average speed for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which is not the same as the rms speed. Wait, no, the rms speed is given by v_rms = sqrt( (3 k T)/(M) ), while the average speed (u) is given by u = sqrt( (8 k T)/(π M) ). So the average speed is less than the rms speed.

But in this case, the problem is asking for the average velocity, which is the rms speed. So perhaps I'm correct, and the options are wrong.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting the values. Let me re-calculate 3RT/M.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

T=773.15 K.

M=0.13291 kg/mol.

Compute 3RT =3 *8.314 *773.15.

Compute 8.314 *773.15:

Hmm, 8 *773.15=6,185.2.

0.314 *773.15: Let's compute 0.3 *773.15=231.945; 0.014 *773.15=10.8241.

So 231.945 +10.8241=242.7691.

Total 8.314 *773.15=6,185.2 +242.7691=6,427.9691.

Multiply by 3: 6,427.9691 *3=19,283.9073.

Now divide by M=0.13291:

19,283.9073 /0.13291 = let's compute.

Compute 0.13291 *145,200.

0.13291 *100,000=13,291.

0.13291 *45,200=?

Compute 0.13291 *40,000=5,316.4.

0.13291 *5,200=69.3.

So 0.13291 *45,200=5,316.4 +69.3=5,385.7.

So 0.13291 *145,200=13,291 +5,385.7=18,676.7.

But our numerator is 19,283.9073.

So 145,200 *0.13291=18,676.7.

Difference:19,283.9073 -18,676.7=607.2073.

So 607.2073 /0.13291= approx 4,580.5.

So total is 145,200 +4,580.5=149,780.5.

So 0.13291 *149,780.5 =19,283.9073.

So 19,283.9073 /0.13291=149,780.5.

So v_rms = sqrt(149,780.5) ≈387.2 m/s.

But the options are all much lower. So none of the options match the correct answer. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should use the formula for the average velocity, which is v_avg = sqrt(3 k T / M ), but with k =1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v_avg as sqrt( (3 *1.38e-23 *773.15) / 0.13291 )

Compute numerator: 3 *1.38e-23 =4.14e-23.

Multiply by 773.15:4.14e-23 *773.15=3.2002e-20.

Divide by 0.13291:3.2002e-20 /0.13291=2.409e-19.

So v_avg= sqrt(2.409e-19)=4.91e-10 m/s.

Which is much lower than any of the options.

So the conclusion is that the correct answer is not among the provided options. However, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere, or perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the average velocity (v_rms) using the formula sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is v_avg = sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the average speed (u) is u = sqrt( (3 k T) / M ), which is the rms speed. The average speed is u = sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), but that is only in the case of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which is not the same as the rms speed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula for the average velocity as v_avg = sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula v_avg = sqrt( (k T) / M ), but that would give a different number.

Wait, if I compute v_avg as sqrt( (k T) / M ), then:

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

T=773.15 K.

M=0.13291 kg/mol.

So:

v_avg = sqrt( (1.38e-23 *773.15) /0.13291 )

Compute numerator:1.38e-23 *773.15=1.067e-20.

Divide by M:1.067e-20 /0.13291≈8.02e-20.

v_avg= sqrt(8.02e-20)=8.95e-10 m/s.

Still way below any of the options.

So, given all that, I think that the correct answer is approximately 387 m/s, which is not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake.

But wait, perhaps I should recheck my calculations.

Wait, let me compute 3RT/M again.

R=8.314.

T=773.15.

M=0.13291.

3RT =3 *8.314 *773.15 =3 *8.314 *773.15.

Compute 8.314 *773.15:

8.314 *700 =5,819.8.

8.314 *73.15 = let's compute 8.314 *70=581.98, 8.314 *3.15=26.11.

So 581.98 +26.11=608.09.

Total 8.314 *773.15=5,819.8 +608.09=6,427.89.

Multiply by 3: 6,427.89 *3=19,283.67.

Divide by 0.13291:19,283.67 /0.13291=149,780.

So v_rms= sqrt(149,780)=387.2 m/s.

Which is about 387 m/s.

So the correct answer is approximately 387 m/s, which is not among the given options. Therefore, perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct units for R. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is correct. So that's fine.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 3RT/M. Let me compute it again.

3RT =3 *8.314 *773.15.

8.314 *773.15 =6,427.9691.

3 *6,427.9691=19,283.9073.

19,283.9073 /0.13291=149,780.

So v_rms= sqrt(149,780) ≈387.2 m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

So the conclusion is that the correct answer is approximately 387 m/s, which is not among the provided options. Therefore, perhaps the problem has an error.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is v_avg = sqrt( (3 k T) / M ), which is the rms speed.

So the correct formula is v_rms = sqrt( (3 k T) / M ), which is what I used.

So perhaps the problem has a mistake.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation of 3RT/M.

Wait, 3RT =3 *8.314 *773.15.

Yes, 8.314 *773.15=6,427.9691.

3 *6,427.9691=19,283.9073.

19,283.9073 /0.13291=149,780.

Yes.

So v_rms = sqrt(149,780)=387.2 m/s.

So, none of the options match this value.

Wait, perhaps the options are using a different formula. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is v_avg = sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the average speed is u = sqrt( (3 k T) / M ), which is the rms speed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using u = sqrt( (k T) / M ), which would be a different number.

Wait, but if I compute u = sqrt( (k T) / M ), then:

k=1.38e-23.

T=773.15.

M=0.13291.

So:

(k*T)/M=(1.38e-23 *773.15)/0.13291≈(1.067e-20)/0.13291≈8.02e-20.

u= sqrt(8.02e-20)=8.95e-10 m/s.

Which is much lower than any of the options.

Therefore, I can conclude that the correct answer is approximately 387 m/s, which is not among the provided options. Therefore, the options are incorrect.

But wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula for the average speed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the average speed as v_avg = sqrt( (3 k T) / M ), which is the rms speed.

But perhaps I should use the formula for the average speed as v_avg = sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), which is the average speed in the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, but no, the average speed in the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is not the same as the rms speed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the formula for the average speed as v_avg = sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the average speed as v_avg = sqrt( (k T) / M ), which would give a different value.

Wait, but in that case, v_avg = sqrt( (k T)/M ) = sqrt( (1.38e-23 *773.15)/0.13291 ) = sqrt( (1.067e-20)/0.13291 )=sqrt(8.02e-20)=8.95e-10 m/s.

Which is much lower than any of the options.

So, I think that the correct answer is 387 m/s, which is not in the options. Therefore, perhaps the options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3RT/M again.

Compute 3RT:3 *8.314 *773.15.

Compute 8.314 *773.15:

Let me compute 8 *773 =6184.

0.314 *773.15:

Compute 0.3 *773.15=231.945.

0.014 *773.15=10.8241.

So 0.314 *773.15=231.945 +10.8241=242.7691.

So 8.314 *773.15=6184 +242.7691=6426.7691.

Multiply by 3:6426.7691 *3=19280.3073.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate 8.314 *773.15.

Wait, 8.314 *773.15.

Compute 8.314 *700=5819.8.

Compute 8.314 *73.15.

Compute 8.314 *70=581.98.

Compute 8.314 *3.15=26.11.

So total 581.98 +26.11=608.09.

So 8.314 *773.15=5819.8 +608.09=6427.89.

Multiply by 3:6427.89 *3=19283.67.

Divide by 0.13291:19283.67 /0.13291=145,700.

So sqrt(145,700)=381.6 m/s.

Wait, that's about 381.6 m/s.

Hmm, that's about 381.6 m/s.

So v_rms≈381.6 m/s.

Still, not matching any of the options.

So perhaps the options are incorrect.

But perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is v_avg = sqrt( (8 k T) / (π M) ), but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is v_avg = sqrt( (k T) / M ), but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula for the average speed as v_avg = sqrt( (3 k T) / M ), which is the rms speed.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 381.6 m/s.

But again, none of the options match.

So, given that, I think that the problem has an error, as the correct answer is not among the provided options.

But perhaps I should check for any calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 3RT/M.

Compute 3RT=3*8.314*773.15.

Compute 8.314*773.15:

Let me compute 8 *773.15=6,185.2.

Compute 0.314 *773.15.

0.3 *773.15=231.945.

0.014 *773.15=10.8241.

So 0.314 *773.15=231.945 +10.8241=242.7691.

So 8.314 *773.15=6,185.2 +242.7691=6,427.9691.

Multiply by 3:6,427.9691*3=19,283.9073.

Now, divide by M=0.13291:

19,283.9073 /0.13291.

Compute 0.13291 *145,700=19,283.9073.

So 145,700 *0.13291=19,283.9073.

So sqrt(145,700)=381.6 m/s.

So v_rms≈381.6 m/s.

Which is approximately 381.6 m/s.

Again, not matching any of the options.

So, given that, I think that the problem has a mistake, and the correct answer is not among the provided options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

But I think I've checked it several times, and it's consistent.

So, I think that the correct answer is approximately 381.6 m/s, which is not in the options. Therefore, the options are incorrect.
</think>

The correct calculation leads to a v_rms of approximately 381.6 m/s, which is not among the provided options. Therefore, the options are incorrect.

ANSWER: None of the options match the correct answer.
