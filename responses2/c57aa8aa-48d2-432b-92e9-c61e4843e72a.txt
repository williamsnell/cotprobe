Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the spread of an epidemic. Let me read it again. The question says that the rate of spread is jointly proportional to the number of infected people and the number of uninfected people. Hmm, I think that translates into a differential equation. 

The setup is an isolated town with 5000 inhabitants. At the start of the week, 160 people are infected, and by the end, 1200 are infected. I need to find how long it takes for 80% of the population to become infected. That means 4000 people need to be infected, since 80% of 5000 is 4000.

Wait, let's break this down. Let's denote I(t) as the number of infected people at time t. Then, the number of uninfected people would be 5000 - I(t). Since the rate of spread is jointly proportional to both, the differential equation should be dI/dt = k * I(t) * (5000 - I(t)), where k is the proportionality constant.

I remember that this is a logistic growth model. The solution to this equation is I(t) = K / (1 + (K/I0 - 1)e^{-kt}), where K is the carrying capacity, which in this case is 5000. 

Given that I0 is 160 at t=0. So, substituting, I(t) = 5000 / (1 + (5000/160 - 1)e^{-kt}). Let's compute 5000/160. 5000 divided by 160 is 31.25. So, I(t) = 5000/(1 + (31.25 - 1)e^{-kt}) = 5000/(1 + 30.25 e^{-kt}).

Now, at t = 7 days (end of the week), I(t) is 1200. So, let's plug that in. 1200 = 5000/(1 + 30.25 e^{-7k}).

Let me solve for k. Multiply both sides by denominator: 1200(1 + 30.25 e^{-7k}) = 5000.

Divide both sides by 1200: 1 + 30.25 e^{-7k} = 5000/1200 ≈ 4.1667.

Subtract 1: 30.25 e^{-7k} = 3.1667.

Divide both sides by 30.25: e^{-7k} = 3.1667 /30.25 ≈ 0.1046.

Take natural log of both sides: -7k = ln(0.1046). Let me compute ln(0.1046). Hmm, ln(0.1) is about -2.3026, and 0.1046 is slightly higher than 0.1, so maybe around -2.25? Wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, 0.1046 is e^{-2.25} because e^2.25 is about 9.48, so 1/9.48 ≈ 0.1055, which is a little higher than 0.1046. Let me compute ln(0.1046). Let me use a calculator approach. Let me think: e^-2 = 0.1353, e^-2.1 is about 0.1225, e^-2.2 is about 0.1108, e^-2.25 is about 0.1054. So, 0.1046 is between e^-2.2 and e^-2.25. Let's say it's approximately -2.24.

So, -7k ≈ -2.24 → k ≈ 2.24/7 ≈ 0.32 days^-1.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation steps. I think it's correct, but let me check:

At t=7, I=1200.

Equation: 1200 = 5000/(1 + 30.25 e^{-7k}).

Multiply both sides by denominator: 1200 + 363000 e^{-7k} = 5000 → 363000 e^{-7k} = 3800 → e^{-7k} = 3800/363000 ≈ 0.01046.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, that's not right. Let me redo the algebra.

Wait, 1200 = 5000 / (1 + 30.25 e^{-7k}).

Multiply both sides by denominator: 1200(1 + 30.25 e^{-7k}) = 5000.

Divide both sides by 1200: 1 + 30.25 e^{-7k} = 5000 / 1200 = 50/12 = 25/6 ≈4.1667.

So, 30.25 e^{-7k} = 4.1667 - 1 = 3.1667.

So, e^{-7k} = 3.1667 /30.25 ≈ 0.1046.

So, ln(0.1046) ≈ -2.24 as I thought earlier.

So, -7k = -2.24 → k ≈ 0.32 days^-1.

Okay, so k is approximately 0.32 per day.

Now, we need to find the time t when 80% of the population is infected, which is 4000 people. So, I(t) =4000.

Using the same formula: 4000 = 5000/(1 + 30.25 e^{-kt}).

Multiply both sides by denominator: 4000(1 +30.25 e^{-kt})=5000.

Divide both sides by 4000: 1 + 30.25 e^{-kt} = 1.25.

Subtract 1: 30.25 e^{-kt} = 0.25.

Divide both sides by 30.25: e^{-kt} = 0.25/30.25 ≈ 0.008264.

Take natural logarithm: -kt = ln(0.008264).

What's ln(0.008264)? Let's calculate. Ln(0.008) is about -4.828. Let me compute ln(0.008264). Since 0.008264 is approximately 8.264e-3, so ln(8.264e-3) = ln(8.264) + ln(1e-3) = ln(8.264)≈2.113 (since e^2≈7.389, e^2.1≈8.166, e^2.11 ≈8.264). So, ln(8.264e-3) ≈2.113 -6.908≈-4.795.

So, -kt ≈-4.795. Therefore, t ≈4.795/k. Since k is approximately 0.32, t ≈4.795 /0.32 ≈14.98 days, approximately 15 days.

Looking back at the options, option H is 10 days, and I is 15 days. Wait, but the calculation gives approximately 15 days. So, the answer should be 15 days, which is option I.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let me recalculate the value of k.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, I think I messed up somewhere. Let me recompute.

Wait, earlier I had I(t) =5000/(1 + (5000/160 -1) e^{-kt} )=5000/(1 +30.25 e^{-kt}).

At t=7, I=1200. So, 1200 =5000/(1 +30.25 e^{-7k}).

Multiply both sides: 1200*(1 +30.25 e^{-7k})=5000.

So, 1 +30.25 e^{-7k}=5000/1200 ≈4.1667.

Subtract 1: 30.25 e^{-7k}=3.1667.

So, e^{-7k}=3.1667/30.25≈0.1046.

So, ln(0.1046)= -2.24.

Thus, -7k= -2.24 → k=2.24/7≈0.32 days^-1.

Now, for I(t)=4000.

So, 4000=5000/(1 +30.25 e^{-kt}).

Multiply both sides: 1 +30.25 e^{-kt}=5000/4000=1.25.

So, 30.25 e^{-kt}=0.25.

e^{-kt}=0.25/30.25≈0.008264.

Take natural log: -kt=ln(0.008264)= ln(8.264e-3)= ln(8.264)+ ln(1e-3)= 2.113 -6.908≈-4.795.

So, -kt = -4.795 → t=4.795/k.

k=0.32, so t=4.795/0.32≈14.98 days, which is approximately 15 days. So the answer should be option I: 15 days.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option I is 15 days. So that's the correct answer.

The problem involves modeling the spread of an epidemic using a logistic growth equation, where the rate of infection is jointly proportional to the number of infected and uninfected individuals. The key steps are:

1. **Differential Equation Setup**: The rate of infection is given by \( \frac{dI}{dt} = kI(5000 - I) \), leading to the solution \( I(t) = \frac{5000}{1 + (5000/160 - 1)e^{-kt}} \).

2. **Initial Condition**: At \( t = 0 \), \( I = 160 \), so \( K = 5000 \) and \( I(t) = \frac{5000}{1 + 30.25e^{-kt}} \).

3. **Finding \( k \)**: Using \( I(7) = 1200 \), solve for \( k \):
   \[
   1200 = \frac{5000}{1 + 30.25e^{-7k}}
   \]
   Solving gives \( k \approx 0.32 \, \text{days}^{-1} \).

4. **Time for 80% Infection**: Set \( I(t) = 4000 \) and solve for \( t \):
   \[
   4000 = \frac{5000}{1 + 30.25e^{-kt}}
   \]
   Solving gives \( t \approx 14.98 \, \text{days} \), approximately 15 days.

Thus, the time to reach 80% infection is **15 days**, which corresponds to option **I**.
