Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the interest rate for an account. Let me see... The account started with $5,000 and now has $13,000 after 12 years, compounded annually. I'm supposed to find the interest rate between 0 and 1. Hmm.

Wait, I remember the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r)^t. Where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is the time in years. Right. So in this case, A is $13,000, P is $5,000, and t is 12 years. I need to find r.

Let me plug in the numbers. So 13,000 = 5,000 * (1 + r)^12. I can divide both sides by 5,000 to simplify. That gives me 13/5 = (1 + r)^12. So 13 divided by 5 is 2.6. So 2.6 equals (1 + r) to the 12th power.

Now I need to solve for r. That means I have to take the 12th root of 2.6. I'm a bit rusty on exponents, but I think I remember that taking the nth root is the same as raising to the power of 1/n. So (2.6)^(1/12) is the same as the 12th root of 2.6.

I'm not sure exactly how to calculate that without a calculator, but maybe I can approximate. Alternatively, I can use logarithms. Oh wait, I could use natural logarithms. The formula for that is ln(A/P) = r*t. Wait, no, that's the continuous case. For annual compounding, earlier formula was better.

Wait, another approach: maybe I can use trial and error. Let's see. What if I guess a value for r and see if (1 + r)^12 gets me to 2.6.

Let me try r=0.05 (5%). Then (1.05)^12. Let me calculate that. 1.05^12. Hmm, I think 1.05^10 is about 1.6289. Then 1.05^12 is that multiplied by (1.05)^2, which is 1.1025. So 1.6289 * 1.1025 ≈ 1.6289*1.1=1.7918, plus 0.0025*1.6289≈0.00407, so about 1.7959. That's way below 2.6. So 5% is too low.

What about 0.07? Then 1.07^12. Let's think: 1.07^12. I remember that 1.07^10 is about 1.967, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate step by step or use a logarithmic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms. The equation is (1 + r)^12 = 2.6. Take natural logs on both sides: ln(2.6) = 12 * ln(1 + r). So ln(2.6) / 12 = ln(1 + r). Let me compute ln(2.6) first. I think ln(2)=0.6931, ln(3)=1.0986. 2.6 is between 2 and 3. Let me approximate ln(2.6). Let's say ln(2.6)≈0.9555. Then dividing by 12 gives 0.079625. So ln(1 + r) ≈ 0.079625. So 1 + r ≈ e^0.079625. Now, e^0.08 is approximately 1.0833. So 1 + r ≈ 1.0833, so r ≈ 0.0833, which is 8.33%. Wait, that's a guess, but not precise. Wait, but wait what if I do a more accurate calculation.

Let me compute ln(2.6) more accurately. Let's think: ln(2)=0.693147, ln(e)=1, which is about 2.71828. So 2.6 is 2.6/2.71828 ≈ 0.958. So ln(2.6) ≈ 0.958 * 1 + (1.0...? Wait, no, I should use Taylor series or a better method. Alternatively, I can use a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that ln(2.6) is approximately 0.9555 as I thought earlier. So 0.9555 /12 ≈ 0.079625. So e^0.079625 is e^0.08. Let me compute e^0.08 exactly. e^0.08 is approximately 1.083287. So 1 + r ≈ 1.083287, so r ≈ 0.083287, which is about 8.33%. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 8.33% as an option. Wait, the options given are A: 0.0695 (6.95%), B:0.0587 (5.87%), C:0.0871 (8.71%), D:0.05 (5%), E:0.0654 (6.54%), F:0.0828 (8.28%), G:0.0999 (9.99%), H:0.11 (11%), I:0.0756 (7.56%), J:0.0932 (9.32%).

Wait, 8.33% isn't an option. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I should try a different method.

Wait another approach: Perhaps using the rule of 72. But wait, rule of 72 is for doubling time. Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithms with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula for compound interest and apply logarithms more accurately. Let me try that.

So the equation is (1 + r)^12 = 2.6.

Take natural logs: ln(2.6) = 12 ln(1 + r).

Calculate ln(2.6):

I think the exact value is approximately 0.9555116319. So 0.9555116319 /12 = 0.07962597.

So ln(1 + r) = 0.07962597.

Now, 1 + r = e^0.07962597.

What's e^0.07962597? Let's compute that more accurately.

e^0.07 is approximately 1.072508.

e^0.08 is approximately 1.083287.

e^0.07962597 is between 0.07 and 0.08.

Compute the difference between 0.07962597 and 0.07: 0.00962597.

So, e^0.07 = 1.072508.

The derivative of e^x is e^x, so to approximate e^0.07 + d, where d=0.00962597, we can use a linear approximation.

The derivative at x=0.07 is e^0.07 ≈1.072508.

So, e^(0.07 + d) ≈ e^0.07 * (1 + d) = 1.072508 * (1 + 0.00962597) ≈ 1.072508 * 1.00962597.

Calculating that: 1.072508 * 1.00962597 = approx 1.072508 * 1.00962597.

Compute 1.072508 * 1 = 1.072508.

1.072508 * 0.00962597 ≈ approximately 1.072508 * 0.01 is 0.01072508, minus 1.072508 * 0.00037403. Let's compute:

0.00037403 * 1.072508 ≈ 0.000403.

So 0.01072508 - 0.000403 ≈ 0.010322.

So total approximation is 1.072508 + 0.010322 ≈ 1.08283.

So e^0.07962597 ≈ 1.08283.

So 1 + r ≈ 1.08283 → r ≈ 0.08283, or 8.283%.

Looking at the options, F is 0.0828, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's about 8.3%, but the closest option is 8.28% (0.0828). Alternatively, maybe my approximation of ln(2.6) is a bit off. Let me check a more precise value of ln(2.6).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator for more accurate value.

But assuming I have to choose from the given options, the closest is F: 0.0828. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait another approach: maybe using logarithms for better precision. Let me try.

Compute ln(2.6) = 0.9555116319.

Divide by 12: 0.9555116319 /12 = 0.07962597.

Compute e^0.07962597.

Using a calculator, e^0.0796 equals approximately 1.08283.

So r is approximately 8.283%, which is 0.08283. The closest option is F: 0.0828.

But wait, looking at the options, F is 0.0828, which is 0.0828, which is 8.28%. So that's the closest to our calculation. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recheck because sometimes when I do these calculations, I might have made a mistake. Let me compute 1 + r = approximately 1.0828. So 0.0828 is the rate. So the correct option is F.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for r in another way. Let me compute (13/5)^1/12.

13 divided by 5 is 2.6.

Take the 12th root of 2.6.

Using a calculator, 2.6^(1/12) ≈ 1.08283.

So again, r is approximately 0.08283, which is 8.283%, so 0.0828.

Looking at the options, F is 0.0828, so that's the answer.

The interest rate for the account can be calculated using the compound interest formula:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^t \]

Where:
- \( A = 13,000 \) (final amount),
- \( P = 5,000 \) (principal),
- \( t = 12 \) years.

Rearranging for \( r \):

\[ 13,000 = 5,000 \times (1 + r)^{12} \]
\[ \frac{13,000}{5,000} = (1 + r)^{12} \]
\[ 2.6 = (1 + r)^{12} \]

Taking the 12th root:

\[ 1 + r = 2.6^{1/12} \]

Using a calculator for the 12th root of 2.6 or applying logarithms:

\[ \ln(2.6) \approx 0.9555 \]
\[ \frac{\ln(2.6)}{12} \approx 0.0796 \]
\[ e^{0.0796} \approx 1.0828 \]

Thus, \( r \approx 0.0828 \), or 8.28%. The closest option is:

**Answer: F: 0.0828**
