Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of the boys on 'My Three Sons' is adopted. The question gives me a list of options from A to J, each with a name. I'm not super familiar with the show, but I'll try to recall what I know.

First, I think 'My Three Sons' is a British comedy show, right? It's a family drama show that explores themes of friendship, family, and sometimes, some tricky situations. The main characters are Danny, Sam, and Charlie. I remember that the show often has a lot of humor and sometimes funny situations that the characters try to avoid.

Now, the question is about adopted boys. I'm not entirely sure, but maybe some of them are adopted somehow. I think about the characters and their backgrounds. Danny is an Englishman, Sam is a Scottishman, and Charlie is a German. But I don't remember if any of them have adopted parents or if any of them are from adopted families.

Wait, I think I heard that in the show, some of the main characters are adopted. But I'm not certain about the details. For instance, I believe that one of them might have been adopted by someone, but I'm not sure which character that would be. Alternatively, maybe none of them are adopted, but that seems unlikely because the show often explores family dynamics and sometimes family issues.

I'm trying to remember the names. I think one of the boys is adopted. If I recall correctly, maybe Billy is adopted. Or perhaps someone else. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the names. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm pretty sure that one of the boys is adopted. I think it's either Sam or maybe Ernie. Wait, noâ€”Ernie is one of the main characters, not adopted. So maybe Sam is adopted. Alternatively, I think I've read that Billy is adopted. Hmm.

Or perhaps the other way around. Let me try to piece it together. From what I remember, in 'My Three Sons,' some of the boys are adopted. Specifically, I think that one of them is adopted as part of a family. For example, if I recall correctly, someone in the show had to give up their family because of some difficult situation, and they ended up in an adopted family. But I'm not sure which boy that would be.

Wait, I think the answer is that Sam is adopted. Or maybe it's Billy. Alternatively, maybe it's someone else. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of it another way. The show's main characters are Danny (English), Sam (Scottish), and Charlie (German). None of them are from adopted families, but perhaps one of them is. I think that Billy is adopted, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that Sam is adopted.

Wait, another angle: maybe the question is tricky. The show has a lot of family dynamics, but the main boys are the ones who have to deal with adopted parents. So perhaps the answer is that Sam is adopted. Alternatively, maybe it's another character.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the answer choices again. The options are A-J, each with a different name. I think the correct answer is that Sam is adopted, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's Billy. I'm not sure, but I think the answer is that Sam is adopted. Or perhaps it's another boy.

Wait, I think I remember that one of the boys is adopted. I believe it's Sam. So, the answer is B: Sam.

The correct answer is that Sam is adopted. 

Answer: B
