Okay, so I have this question about the truth table of a 3 input NAND gate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see.

First, what's a truth table? Oh right, it's a way to show all possible combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each input can be either 0 or 1, so for a 3-input gate, each input has 2 possibilities. So the number of rows in the truth table would be 2^3. Let me calculate that: 2*2*2 is 8. So there are 8 possible input combinations. 

Wait, but the question is about the number of entries. Each row is an entry. So that's 8 entries. Let me look at the options again. The options are A:6, B:12, C:4, D:10, E:18, F:9, G:16, H:8, I:3, J:7. Oh, so H is 8. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh yeah, the NAND gate is a combination of AND and NOT. So normally, an AND gate with 3 inputs would have 8 rows, but NAND is just the NOT of that. Wait, no, the truth table of NAND is the same as the NOT of the AND gate. So the output is 1 in all cases except when all three inputs are 1. Because the AND gate would output 1 only when all inputs are 1, so the NAND would be 0 only in that case, making the rest 1.

So in terms of the truth table, it's still 8 entries, each with all possible input combinations. So the number of entries is 8. So the answer should be H.

The number of entries in the truth table for a 3-input NAND gate corresponds to the number of possible input combinations. Each of the 3 inputs can be either 0 or 1, leading to 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. Therefore, the truth table has 8 entries.

Answer: H
