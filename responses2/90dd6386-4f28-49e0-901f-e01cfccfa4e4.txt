Okay, so I have this question about Dr. Harry Holliday planning a three-week cruise. The question is about his best course of action for his clinical practice. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. Dr. Holliday is a clinical psychologist, so he's probably involved in treating various mental health issues. Taking a cruise is a big commitment, so he needs to manage his practice efficiently during that time.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Leave without informing his clients. Hmm, that could be a problem if his clients are called away. But I'm not sure if he should inform them or not. It might be better to have their information updated so they know he's away.

Option B: Give a phone number. That sounds like they might need to contact him if they have issues. But if his clients don't know, they could get in trouble with the practice, especially if they're treated or if there's a legal issue. So maybe not the best idea.

Option C: Provide online resources. That could help clients manage their issues without needing to contact him. If he's on a trip, maybe clients can access support materials or follow up on their own. That might be a good idea.

Option D: Continue via phone or video calls. That's a good idea because many clinical settings allow for telehealth, especially if there's an urgent situation. It's flexible and depends on the practice's protocol.

Option E: Inform clients only a day before departure. That seems like a good idea to avoid any potential issues when they're called away. It allows them time to respond or seek help.

Option F: Cancel all appointments. That could be risky because if he's busy on the cruise, he might be missing out on his regular appointments. Plus, clients might expect him to still be there, so canceling too soon could cause problems.

Option G: Discuss vacation plans with current clients. That's a proactive approach. If he's planning to take the cruise, he should probably know his clients are unavailable. This way, clients are informed and can arrange their usual sessions elsewhere if needed.

Option H: Hire a colleague. That might solve some issues, but it's a big decision. If he's managing his own practice, it could be a burden. Plus, it might not be necessary if he's already managing well.

Option I: Give clients a colleague's emergency number. That's a good idea. If he's unavailable during the cruise, a colleague can provide emergency support. It's a temporary solution and might be easier for clients to handle.

Option J: Cancel regular sessions, pause emergency ones. That seems like a more drastic measure. It allows him to focus on his own business, but it might not be necessary if he's managing his own practice.

Now, thinking about clinical practice, the best approach would be to avoid putting the client on the hook if he's unavailable. So, informing them beforehand (Option E) is important. But maybe he can also handle it himself. For example, if he can take care of his own appointments (Option D), that might be better than informing so they can't contact him.

Wait, but Option G is about discussing the vacation plans with current clients. That way, he's informed, which might prevent issues. Alternatively, Option E is about informing a day before, which could be better because the client is still with him.

But I'm not sure if informing them a day before is the best approach. Maybe it's better to inform them as soon as possible and allow them to arrange their own sessions if needed, especially if they're having something urgent.

Another thought: If he's on vacation, he should probably inform his clients to avoid any potential issues. But it's also important not to overwhelm them. So perhaps Option E is a good balance between being proactive and not overcontacting.

Looking at the options, Option G is about discussing vacation plans with current clients. That could prevent any issues during the cruise. Option E is about informing clients a day before departure. Which is better?

If he's planning the trip, maybe he should discuss the vacation plans with his clients now. That way, he knows the itinerary and can handle any emergencies himself. It's a proactive step, but also allows for flexibility.

Alternatively, informing them beforehand (Option E) could be more proactive because it allows them to respond without further action. But sometimes, clients might not know what's going to happen, so perhaps a day in advance is better.

I'm a bit torn between Options E and G. G is about discussing the vacation, which might be a good idea, and E is about informing them a day before. Both seem good, but maybe G is better because it's proactive and allows him to handle the situation without immediate contact.

Wait, but if he's already planning the trip, why would he need to inform his clients? They might know it's his trip, so they might be less likely to contact him. So, perhaps he should inform them only if needed. But he's planning a trip, so maybe he should inform them about that.

Wait, but if he's planning a trip, it's probably not his job to inform his clients. Or is it? Maybe he's just taking the cruise, but he's already busy. So perhaps he should inform his clients about his trip to avoid any potential issues. That makes sense. So Option G is a good idea.

Alternatively, he might find it easier to inform them a day before. But both options are valid.

But looking at the options, Option G is the best because it allows him to discuss the vacation plans with current clients, which could prevent any potential issues. That way, his clients know he's taking the trip and can handle it themselves.

Wait, but another thought: If he's taking a trip, maybe he should let his clients know. But that might not be necessary unless he's having an emergency. So, perhaps the best is to inform them when he's leaving.

But the options don't specify when. So Option E is " inform his clients only a day before his departure." That might be the best approach because it's a clear plan and allows them to manage their own arrangements.

Alternatively, Option G is to discuss the vacation plans with his current clients. That might be a proactive step, but perhaps he's better off letting them know the trip is planned so they can handle it themselves.

Wait, but if he's on vacation, he's probably not available. So he should inform them. So perhaps Option E is better.

Wait, but if he's on vacation, he's busy, so informing them could be a problem. Because he might not have the time or capacity to manage his own practice. So maybe he should inform them first, but only if it's necessary.

Alternatively, Option G is about discussing the vacation plans, which could be a good way to ensure that his clients know he's taking the trip and can handle it without needing to contact him.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about what's more standard. In clinical settings, it's often better to inform clients of potential absences. So Option E is about informing them a day before departure. That's a common practice.

Another consideration is whether he can handle his own appointments during the cruise. If he can, he might not need to inform his clients. But if he's busy, he might need to inform them.

But the question is about his best course of action, so he should inform his clients regardless, but perhaps the best time is before departure.

Wait, but if he's on vacation, perhaps he should inform his clients only when they are called away, which is Option E.

So, to sum up, the best approach is to inform his clients that he's taking a vacation (Option E). That way, they know he's not available and can arrange their own sessions if needed, avoiding any potential issues.

The best course of action for Dr. Harry Holliday's clinical practice during a three-week cruise is to inform his clients about the trip. This proactive approach ensures they are aware of his absence and can manage their own arrangements. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: inform his clients only a day before his departure about his unavailability.**
