Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Christopher Columbus and the Dominican Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, Bartholomew de las Casas.
Source 1
Indians would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.
—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493
Source 2
It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.
—Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542

Okay, so I need to figure out which motive for exploration is most likely most important in Source 2. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through Source 2 carefully to understand the context. The text is by Bartholomew de las Casas, a Dominican bishop, discussing the Spanish domination in Hispaniola (modern-day Mexico). He explains that the Spanish have been killing the indigenous population, which is a big point of contention. The Spanish claim that they're killing the indigenous people to get gold and expand their own resources quickly. 

Looking at the options provided, let me go through them one by one. 

Option A: Seeking better living conditions. I don't see any mention of living conditions in this text. The focus is on the indigenous population being killed for gold and their own wealth, not better living conditions.

Option B: Finding new mates. Again, the text doesn't talk about the indigenous people seeking new mates. It's more about the indigenous people being targeted for violence.

Option C: Personal glory. Well, the Spanish might have had a sense of pride in their success, but the text doesn't explicitly state that. It's more about the economic gain than personal pride.

Option D: Expanding trade routes. The Spanish are said to be expanding their trade routes, which makes sense if they were trying to exploit the natives. So this seems relevant.

Option E: Cultural exchange. While the Spanish are presenting a case for cultural exchange, the text doesn't explicitly state that. It's more about the economic and political gains, which might be seen as cultural exchange, but not the main motive.

Option F: Discovering new lands. The text does mention that there are many indigenous people, so they must be discovering new lands. This is a strong point.

Option G: Financial gain. The Spanish are clearly trying to gain financial gain, which is a direct motive.

Option H: Scientific research. The text doesn't mention any scientific experiments. It's more about warfare and economic gain.

Option I: Converting the natives to Christianity. The Spanish are presented as converting them to Christianity to gain a political advantage. This is a key point from the text.

Option J: Establishing political dominance. The Spanish are trying to establish power, which is another important motive.

Now, looking back at the options, the question is asking which motive is most likely most important. Let's see which options are explicitly mentioned in the text.

The text says the Spanish are killing the indigenous people to get gold and to expand their resources. So, financial gain (G) and converting the natives to Christianity (I) are both mentioned. However, the question is about the most important motive.

In the context of the text, the primary reason is probably the desire for gold and the economic gain. But converting the natives to Christianity is also a significant factor, as it's a political and cultural shift.

Wait, but the text says they are "killing them" to get gold, which is a direct economic gain. However, converting them to Christianity is also a consequence of that. So both are important, but the question is which is the most likely important motive.

In the context of the question, the options are to pick the most likely most important. So let's think about what each option implies.

Personal glory (C) is more about pride, which might be a factor, but the text doesn't state it as the main reason.

Expanding trade routes (D) is also a possible motive, but the text doesn't mention it. It's more about the economic gain.

Cultural exchange (E) is another possible motive, but the text doesn't explicitly say that.

Financial gain (G) is a clear motive because the text states that the Spanish are trying to get gold.

Converting the natives to Christianity (I) is also a motive, but it's more of a political and cultural shift, which might be secondary to the economic gain.

So, financial gain (G) is the most directly mentioned motive. However, the text also mentions converting the natives to Christianity (I), which I think is more about the political aspect. But in terms of the primary reason for the Spanish' existence, it's the economic gain.

Wait, but the question is about what de las Casas is most likely to think is most important in Source 2. So in the text, the primary reason is the economic gain, but there's also the cultural shift. However, the question is about the motive, and both are present.

Looking back at the options, the most important might be either G or I. But looking at the options again, the text doesn't explicitly say that they're converting the natives to Christianity, but it's a consequence of that conversion. So perhaps the primary motive is the economic gain.

Alternatively, the text could be implying both, but in terms of the answer choices, I think the key point is that they're trying to gain gold and expand their influence. So the most likely important motive would be financial gain (G). But wait, the text also says that they "killed them" to get gold, which is financial gain, and also "to swell themselves with riches" which is another way of saying financial gain.

Alternatively, perhaps the main reason is converting the natives to Christianity (I), as that's a political shift but also a cultural one, which is a more important aspect of the Spanish' strategy.

Wait, but the text says that the Spanish have an "ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits." So acquiring gold and expanding their resources (which implies financial gain) is their main aim.

So, financial gain (G) is the most likely most important motive.

Looking at the options, I see that option D is "Expanding trade routes" which is also a possible motive, but the text doesn't explicitly mention it. However, the text does mention that the Spanish are trying to exploit the natives (to get gold) and that this is their main aim.

So, the answer would be either G or I. But the text doesn't mention I as a primary motive, but as a consequence. So, perhaps the primary motive is financial gain.

Wait, but another angle: the text says, "the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days." This implies that the Spanish were driven by the desire to gain wealth and gain themselves. So their primary motive is to expand their resources, which is financial gain.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be G: Financial gain.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is "Cultural exchange," which is a different aspect. However, the text doesn't mention cultural exchange, just economic gain.

So, the most likely answer is G: Financial gain.
</think>

The text by Bartholomew de las Casas clearly states that the Spanish aimed to acquire gold and expand their resources, which led to their eventual conquest. While the text also mentions converting indigenous people to Christianity, this is a secondary motive. The primary focus is on the economic gain. Therefore, the most likely most important motive is financial gain.

Answer: G
