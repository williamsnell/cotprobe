Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the quotient of 5.04 divided by 0.7. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit nervous about dividing decimals, but I remember some steps from school.

First, I think it's easier if both numbers are whole numbers. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number to eliminate the decimal point. Since 0.7 has one decimal place, multiplying both by 10 should work. Let me try that.

So, 5.04 times 10 is 50.4, and 0.7 times 10 is 7. Now the problem becomes 50.4 divided by 7. That seems a bit more manageable.

Wait, I can maybe simplify this further. Let me see if both 50.4 and 7 have common factors. 7 is a prime number, so let's check if 7 divides into 50.4 evenly. 7 times 7 is 49, which is close to 50.4. Let me try 7.428... Hmm, that's probably not helpful. Maybe I should just do the division step by step.

Alternatively, I could think of 50.4 divided by 7 as how many times 7 goes into 50.4. Let's see: 7 times 7 is 49, which is less than 50.4. So, 7 goes in 7 times, leaving a remainder of 1.4. Then, bring down the 4. Now, 7 goes into 14 twice. So, that's another 2, making it 7.4 times 7? Wait, wait, let me think again. Wait, no, maybe I should just do it as a decimal division.

Alternatively, maybe I can divide 50.4 by 7 directly. Let me set it up: 7 into 50.4.

7 into 50 is 7 times 7 (49) with a remainder of 1. Bring down the 4 to make 14. 7 into 14 is exactly 2. So, putting it together, it's 7.428... Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 7.428... is 7.428571... recurring? Or is it 7.428571428571... I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can express 50.4 as 504 divided by 10, and 7 as 7/1. So, 50.4 /7 = (504/10) /7 = 504/(10*7) = 504/70. Let me compute that. 504 divided by 70. Hmm, 70 times 7 is 490, so 504 is 70*7 +14. So that's 7 and 14/70, which simplifies to 7.2. Oh, wait! So the quotient is 7.2.

Wait, so going back, 5.04 / 0.7 is equal to 7.2. Let me check that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way is to multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate decimals, as I did earlier, which gave me 50.4/7 =7.428... No, wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 7.2. Maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait wait, wait. Let me redo the division. 7 into 50.4. 7 into 50 is 7*7=49, remainder 1. So, it's 7 with a remainder of 1.4. Then bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 14. 7 into 14 is 2. So the result is 7.2. Oh, right! So 7.04 divided by 0.7 is 7.2. So the correct answer should be option D: 0.72? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the options are A through J. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 0.00702

B: 0.7

C:7.2

D:0.72

E:0.702

F:5.04

G:0.0072

H:10.0571

I:720

J:72

Wait a second, I thought the answer was 7.2. But option C is 7.2. But wait, wait, no, let me double-check the division.

Wait, 5.04 divided by 0.7. Let me do this another way. Let me convert 0.7 into a fraction. 0.7 is 7/10. So, 5.04 divided by (7/10) is the same as 5.04 multiplied by 10/7. So, 5.04 *10 =50.4, and 50.4 divided by7 is 7.2. So yes, correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.2. So if the answer is 7.2, which is option C, then the correct choice is C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure. Let me try a different approach. Multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate decimals. So 5.04 times 10 is 50.4, 0.7 times 10 is7. So 50.4 /7. Let's compute that.

7 times 7 is 49, subtract from 50.4, remainder 1.4. Bring down a zero (since we're working with decimals now) to make 14. 7 into 14 is 2. So after decimal, it's 0.72. So 5.04 /0.7 =7.2.

So the answer is 7.2, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't confuse the options. Looking back, the options are A to J. So the options are:

A: 0.00702

B:0.7

C:7.2

D:0.72

E:0.702

F:5.04

G:0.0072

H:10.0571

I:720

J:72

So, the correct answer is 7.2, which is option C.

The correct answer is C: 7.2.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Problem Statement**: Find the quotient of 5.04 divided by 0.7.

2. **Convert to Whole Numbers**: To eliminate decimals, multiply both numerator and denominator by 10:
   - 5.04 * 10 = 50.4
   - 0.7 * 10 = 7

3. **Perform Division**: 50.4 รท 7 = 7.2

4. **Verify with Alternative Method**: Expressing 5.04 as 504/10 and 0.7 as 7/10. The division becomes (504/10) / (7/10) = 504/7 = 72/10 = 7.2.

5. **Conclusion**: The quotient is 7.2, which corresponds to option C.

**Answer**: C: 7.2
