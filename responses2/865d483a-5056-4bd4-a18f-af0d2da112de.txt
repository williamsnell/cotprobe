Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Lyons family's net income and how much they spend on food. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that the family estimates 20% of their net income goes towards food each week. Last week, Mrs. Lyons spent $36 on food. I need to find out what their total net income was for that week. 

Hmm, right. So if 20% of their income is $36, I can set up an equation. Let me write that down. Let’s say the net income is X. So 20% of X equals $36. In math terms, that's 0.20 * X = 36. 

Wait, to find X, I should divide both sides by 0.20. So X = 36 / 0.20. Let me calculate that. 36 divided by 0.2 is the same as 36 * 5, which is 180. So X is $180. 

Looking at the options, E is $180. So that should be the answer. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If the net income is $180 and 20% of that is 0.2 * 180, which is 36. Yep, that matches what was given. So I’m confident that E is correct.

The correct answer is E: $180. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Problem:** The family spends 20% of their net income on food. Last week, they spent $36 on food. We need to find the total net income.

2. **Set Up the Equation:** Let the net income be \( X \). 20% of \( X \) equals $36.
   \[
   0.20 \times X = 36
   \]

3. **Solve for \( X \):**
   \[
   X = \frac{36}{0.20} = 180
   \]

4. **Match to Answer Choices:** The answer is $180, which corresponds to option E.

**Answer:** E
