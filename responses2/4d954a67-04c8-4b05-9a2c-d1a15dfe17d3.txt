Okay, so I've got this problem here: I'm supposed to find the composition of three functions f, g, and h, where f(x) is 3x, g(x) is 5x plus 3, and h(x) is 1 minus x squared. The composition is f(g(h(x))). Hmm, function composition can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you compose functions like f(g(h(x))), you start from the innermost function and work your way out. So, h(x) is the first function I need to compute. Let me write down what h(x) is again: h(x) equals 1 minus x squared. So h(x) = 1 - x².

Next, I need to plug h(x) into g(x). So, g(h(x)) would be g(1 - x²). Since g(x) is 5x + 3, I substitute (1 - x²) in place of x. Let's compute that: 5*(1 - x²) + 3. Let me do the math. 5 times 1 is 5, and 5 times -x² is -5x². Then adding 3. So that's 5 -5x² + 3. Combining like terms, 5 +3 is 8, so 8 -5x². So g(h(x)) simplifies to -5x² +8.

Now, I need to take that result and plug it into f(x). So f(g(h(x))) is f(-5x² +8). Since f(x) is 3x, I substitute (-5x² +8) into x. So f of that would be 3 multiplied by (-5x² +8). Let's compute that. 3 * (-5x²) is -15x², and 3 *8 is 24. So putting it together, that's -15x² +24.

Wait a second, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option A is –15x² +24. So that's the answer I'm getting. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Let me retrace:
1. h(x) = 1 - x².
2. g(h(x)) = 5*(1 -x²) +3 = 5 -5x² +3 = 8 -5x².
3. f(g(h(x))) = 3*(8 -5x²) = 24 -15x², which is the same as -15x² +24.

Looks right. So the correct answer should be option A: –15x² +24.

To find \( f(g(h(x))) \), we start from the innermost function:

1. Compute \( h(x) = 1 - x^2 \).

2. Substitute \( h(x) \) into \( g(x) \): \( g(h(x)) = 5(1 - x^2) + 3 = 5 - 5x^2 + 3 = 8 - 5x^2 \).

3. Substitute \( g(h(x)) \) into \( f(x) \): \( f(g(h(x))) = 3(8 - 5x^2) = 24 - 15x^2 \), which simplifies to \( -15x^2 + 24 \).

The correct answer is **A: –15x² + 24**.
