Okay, so I've got this question about group theory, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to work through it. The question has two statements and asks whether each is true or false, and then gives options about their truthfulness across different groups.

Statement 1: (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2}. Hmm, I remember that in group theory, the inverse of a product is the product of the inverses in reverse order. So, (ab)^{-1} is b^{-1}a^{-1}. But here, it's the inverse squared. So, (ab)^{-2} would be ((ab)^{-1})^2, right? Which would be (b^{-1}a^{-1}) squared. Squaring that would mean multiplying (b^{-1}a^{-1}) by itself. Let's see: (b^{-1}a^{-1})(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = b^{-1}(a^{-1}b^{-1})a^{-1}. Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, let's think about it in terms of exponents. In a group, (ab)^n = a^n b^n only if the group has some specific properties, like being abelian. Wait, no, actually, I think that's not correct. In an abelian group, (ab)^n = a^n b^n holds because multiplication is commutative. But the statement here is for n=2, and it's not necessarily true for all groups. So, does (ab)^{-2} equal b^{-2}a^{-2}?

Let me test with a specific group. Take the symmetric group S3. Let a be a transposition, say (1 2), and b be another transposition, say (1 3). Then ab would be (1 2)(1 3), which is (1 3 2), a 3-cycle. Its inverse would be (1 2 3), which is the same as the inverse of ab. So (ab)^{-2} would be (ab)^{-1} * (ab)^{-1} = (1 2 3)(1 2 3) = identity. On the other side, b^{-2}a^{-2}: b^{-1} is (1 3 2), so b^{-2} is (1 3 2)^2 = (1 2 3). Similarly, a^{-2} is (1 2)^2 = identity. So b^{-2}a^{-2} would be (1 2 3)*identity = (1 2 3). But (ab)^{-2} is identity, which is not equal to (1 2 3). So in this case, Statement 1 is false. So Statement 1 is False.

Wait, but wait, maybe I chose a specific group where it's false. So the first part of the answer would be False for Statement 1, but I need to check Statement 2 as well.

Statement 2: (ab)^n = a^n b^n. I think this holds in abelian groups because if the group is abelian, then ab=ba, so (ab)^n = ababab...n times = a^n b^n. But is this true for any group, or only abelian ones?

Wait, if I take a non-abelian group, say S3 again. Let's see. Take a = (1 2) and b = (1 3). Then ab is (1 2)(1 3) = (1 3 2). So (ab)^2 = (1 3 2)^2 = (1 2 3). On the other hand, a^2 is identity, b^2 is (1 3)^2 = identity. So a^2 b^2 is identity * identity = identity. But (ab)^2 is (1 2 3), which is not identity. So Statement 2 is False in this non-abelian group.

So Statement 2 is False in general, not just in abelian groups. Hence, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but the options are about whether each statement is True or False. So Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is False. So looking at the options, let me see.

The options are labeled A through J, each providing a pair of truth values. The options are:

A: False, True
B: False for statement 1 only for some groups, True for statement 2 for all groups
C: False, False
D: False for statement 1 only for some groups but not all, True for statement 2 only for some groups
E: False for statement 1 for all groups, True for statement 2 only for some groups
F: True, False
G: True for statement 1 only for some groups, False for statement 2 for all groups
H: True, True
I: True for statement 1 for all groups, False for statement 2 only for some groups
J: True, True for some groups but not all.

So our analysis: Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is False. So the correct option is C: False, False.

The correct answer is C: False, False.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Statement 1 Analysis:**  
   We evaluate whether $(ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2}$ holds in any group.  
   Testing with $S_3$ (symmetric group on 3 elements):  
   - Let $a = (1 2)$ and $b = (1 3)$.  
   - Compute $(ab)^{-2} = (b^{-1}a^{-1})^2 = (b^{-1}a^{-1})(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = (1 3 2)^2 = (1 2 3)$.  
   - Compute $b^{-2}a^{-2} = (b^{-1})^2 a^{-2} = (1 3 2)^2 (1 2)^2 = (1 2 3) \cdot \text{identity} = (1 2 3)$.  
   Both sides equal $(1 2 3)$, which suggests Statement 1 holds. However, this contradicts our initial group-specific analysis. Re-examining, in $S_3$, $(ab)^{-2} = (1 2 3)$ and $b^{-2}a^{-2} = (1 2 3)$. Wait, both sides are equal, so Statement 1 is **True**? Or is it False?

   Wait, earlier analysis with $ab = (1 3 2)$, $(ab)^{-1} = (1 2 3)$, $(ab)^{-2} = (1 2 3)^2 = (1 3 2)$. And $b^{-2}a^{-2} = (1 2 3)$. So $(ab)^{-2} = (1 3 2) \neq (1 2 3) = b^{-2}a^{-2}$. Hence, Statement 1 is **False**.

2. **Statement 2 Analysis:**  
   Evaluate $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ in any group.  
   In an abelian group, this holds because $ab = ba$, so $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$. However, in a non-abelian group like $S_3$, $(ab)^n \neq a^n b^n$ for $n \geq 2$. For example, $(ab)^2 \neq a^2 b^2$. Hence, Statement 2 is **False**.

3. **Option Selection:**  
   Both statements are False, so the correct option is C: False, False.

**Answer:** C
