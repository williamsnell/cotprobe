Alright, I'm trying to figure out which option supply-side economists would prefer. Okay, so supply-side economics is all about reducing the income gap, increasing welfare, and encouraging more investment and consumption. They say that what's good for the bottom is good for the top, right?

Looking at the options:

A: Lower taxes on household income. That sounds like it would lower the cost of living and increase disposable income. That's positive for supply-side arguments because it's more affordable for people.

B: Tax credit on capital investment. Tax credits would make businesses more attractive, which could stimulate investment. But I'm not sure if that's a primary focus of supply-side economists. More investment might be part of the argument, but maybe they argue against just giving credits, like in favor of higher taxes on capital.

C: Increased government spending. That's a big one. If the government spends more, it could boost GDP. But I think supply-side tends to oppose government spending because it's seen as inefficient. Like, they prefer having private factors of production rather than government intervention.

D: Higher tariffs on imported goods. That seems counterproductive. Tariffs would make imports more expensive, reducing demand, which would hurt supply-side arguments. It's like a tax on wealth because it redistributes tax burden.

E: A tax on wealth. I'm not sure. Wealth taxes are sometimes discussed, but I think supply-side tends to support lower taxes, not higher. Wealth might be a more neutral or controversial point.

F: Government regulation of industry. That's more of a traditional approach, not supply-side. They prefer private markets and regulation to certain degrees.

G: Increased minimum wage. That's a microeconomic concern. Higher wages might help lower the cost of labor, but supply-side might prefer higher taxes on income to reduce the need for labor.

H: Higher corporate tax rates. That would reduce corporate profits, which could lower corporate investments. But I'm not sure if that's a primary supply-side focus. Sometimes, they argue against corporate tax rates, but I'm not certain.

I: Reduction in defense spending. Defense is a public good, but supply-side might prefer less public spending in defense. They argue that defense is more about the military and could be a burden.

J: Increased social welfare programs. That's definitely supply-side. They provide a safety net for the poor and reduce the need for private sector spending.

So, looking back, supply-side economists would likely prefer options that lower income taxes, increase government spending, and provide more welfare. Among the options, J seems to be the most likely. But let me double-check.

Option E: Tax on wealth. Some supply-side arguments focus on wealth redistribution, but I'm not sure if that's their main focus. They might argue against wealth taxes as they don't address the underlying issues like inequality.

Option J is about social welfare, which is a big part of supply-side. The other options seem more about economic policy like reducing income taxes, increasing government spending, or providing welfare, which aligns with supply-side's goals.

So the answer should be J.

The supply-side economists are likely to prefer options that focus on reducing income taxes, increasing government spending, and providing social welfare. Among the options, **J: Increased social welfare programs** is the most likely choice, as it aligns with the core arguments of supply-side economics aimed at addressing economic inequality and reducing the need for private sector spending.

Answer: J
