Okay, so I've got this question about whether a set F is sequentially compact using different theorems. The set F consists of functions F(x) which are integrals of functions f from M. M is the set of bounded functions on [0,1], and F(x) is the integral from 0 to x of f(t) dt. I need to determine if F is sequentially compact.

Hmm, I remember that sequential compactness is related to being totally bounded and complete, but in the context of function spaces. The Arzelà-Ascoli theorem comes to mind. That theorem says that a set of continuous functions on a compact interval is relatively compact (i.e., its closure is compact) if and only if it's bounded, closed, and uniformly equicontinuous.

So for F, each function is an integral of f in M. Since M consists of bounded functions, each F(x) is continuous because it's an integral of a continuous function (assuming f is continuous, but M is just bounded, so f might not be continuous. Wait, but M is defined as bounded functions, so f is in C[0,1] only if it's continuous. But M is just bounded, so f could be any bounded function, not necessarily continuous.

Wait, no. The set M is just bounded functions, not necessarily continuous. So F(x) is the integral of a bounded function, which is continuous. So F is a set of continuous functions on [0,1].

But wait, the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem requires the functions to be uniformly continuous. Since each F(x) is the integral of a bounded continuous function, each F is uniformly continuous on [0,1]. Because the integral of a continuous function is continuous, and for a function f that's bounded, the integral is uniformly continuous on a compact interval.

But Arzelà-Ascoli requires not just uniform continuity, but also equicontinuity. So for F, I need to check if the set is equicontinuous.

Wait, let me think again. Let me consider two points x and y in [0,1]. The difference |F(x) - F(y)| is the integral from y to x of |f(t)| dt. Since f is bounded, say by M, then it's less than or equal to M*(x - y). So the difference is less than or equal to M*(x - y). So for any epsilon, choosing delta = epsilon / M would make |F(x) - F(y)| < epsilon whenever |x - y| < delta. So that's equicontinuous.

Wait, but wait. So F is a set of functions that are uniformly continuous and equicontinuous, and each is bounded. So over the interval [0,1], which is compact, by Arzelà-Ascoli, F is relatively compact? But wait, no, because Arzelà-Ascoli requires that the set is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous.

Wait, but M is the set of bounded functions, so F consists of integrals of such functions. Each f in M is bounded, say by some constant K. So each F(x) is <= K*x, which is <= K*1. So F is uniformly bounded: all functions are bounded by K.

But wait, F is a subset of C[0,1], and it's equicontinuous because the difference is <= K*(x - y). So, yes, by Arzelà-Ascoli, F is relatively compact. But wait, the question is about sequential compactness. In a metric space, relative compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness. So F is sequentially compact.

Wait, but that would suggest option [0,3] or something like that. Let me check the options. The options are:

A: [0,2]
B: [0,3]
C: [1,3]
D: [0,1]
E: [1,1]
F: [1,0]
G: [1,2]
H: [0,4]
I: [1,4]
J: [0,0]

Wait, but in the question, the options are for two answers: the first is for whether the set is sequentially compact (1 for yes, 0 for no) and the second is for using which theorem. Oh, wait, the question asks to return two answers in a list, like [0,2], which implies that the answer is 0 for the first question and 2 for the second, but that doesn't make sense because the first question is about sequential compactness.

Wait, no, I think I misread the question. The original question says: "Is the set F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(t)dt | f ∈ M [...] a sequentially compact set?" So the first part is about whether F is sequentially compact.

Then, the next part says: "Furthermore, it can be proved using 1. Arzelà-Ascoli, 2. Riesz representation theorem, 3. Banach fixed point, 4. None of the above." So the second part is about which theorem(s) is/are used to prove that F is sequentially compact.

Wait, but if F is relatively compact (i.e., sequentially compact) by Arzelà-Ascoli, then the answer is 1 for the first question. But the second part says, using which theorem: 1. Arzelà-Ascoli, 2. Riesz, 3. Banach fixed point, 4. None.

So the answer would be 1 for the first part and 1 for the second part. So the list would be [1,1], which is option E. But wait, let me think again. Because F is a set of functions, and using Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, which is option 1, to show that F is relatively compact, which is sequential compactness.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the set F is not only bounded and equicontinuous but also closed. Because Arzelà-Ascoli requires closedness as well. Wait, M is bounded, but is F closed? Because F is the image of M under an integral operator, but that operator is not necessarily closed.

Wait, but in the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, the set needs to be bounded, closed, and equicontinuous. So if F is not closed, then Arzelà-Ascoli doesn't directly apply. So perhaps F is not closed, so F is not relatively compact. But wait, no, M is bounded, but the integral might not be closed. Let's think again.

Wait, F is the set {∫₀ˣ f(t) dt | f ∈ M}. Each f is bounded, so each F(x) is ≤ M*1. So F is uniformly bounded. Is F closed in C[0,1]? Because M is a closed set in C[0,1] (assuming M is closed under some condition, but actually, M is only given as bounded, not necessarily closed). So F is the image of M under a continuous linear operator (the integral operator). The image of a closed set under a continuous function is closed. But if M is closed, then F is closed. But M is not necessarily closed.

Wait, but in the problem, M is defined as the set of bounded functions in C[0,1], but whether it's closed depends on the topology. Wait, no, in C[0,1], the bounded functions form a metric space, but perhaps M is not closed. So F might not be closed in C[0,1], meaning that the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem can't be applied directly because the image might not be closed.

Wait, but if F is a subset of C[0,1], and we can show that it's bounded, equicontinuous, and closed, then it's compact. Alternatively, maybe F isn't closed, so Arzelà-Ascoli doesn't apply, meaning F isn't compact.

Wait, but in this case, because F is the image of M under a continuous operator, and if M is a closed subset of C[0,1], then F would be closed. But is M closed? M is the set of bounded functions on [0,1]. But in the space C[0,1], which is the set of continuous functions, the bounded functions are not closed. Because any continuous function on [0,1] is bounded, but not all bounded functions are continuous.

Wait, for example, the function f(x) = 1/x for x in (0,1] and f(0) = 0 isn't continuous, but it's bounded. So M is not closed in C[0,1]. Therefore, the image F under the integral operator might not be closed. So Arzelà-Ascoli can't be applied because the image isn't necessarily closed.

Hmm, so then, what else is required for sequential compactness? Maybe F is not closed, so Arzelà-Ascoli doesn't guarantee compactness. But maybe there's another theorem or approach.

Wait, perhaps using the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, if F is closed, then it's compact. But since F might not be closed, maybe it's not compact. Alternatively, perhaps F is not closed, so Arzelà-Ascoli doesn't help.

Wait, but perhaps the set F is not closed, so Arzelà-Ascoli doesn't directly apply, so F might not be compact. So the answer to the first part is no, and the second part would need another approach.

Wait, but in the question, the two parts to return are the answers for each part. So perhaps the first part is about whether F is sequentially compact, which is yes or no. If it's yes, then the answer is 1, else 0. Then the second part is which theorem is used, 1. Arzelà-Ascoli, 2. Riesz, etc.

But earlier I thought that F is not closed, so Arzelà-Ascoli doesn't apply because the image might not be closed. So F is not closed, so Arzelà-Ascoli can't be applied directly. So F might not be compact.

Wait, but maybe another approach can be used. Alternatively, perhaps F is not closed, so it's not sequentially compact.

So the first part would be 0, and the second part would be 0 as well because Arzelà-Ascoli is not applicable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps F is not compact because it's not closed. So the answer would be 0 for both parts, which is option J: [0,0].

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about another approach. Let's think about the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem again. It requires the set to be closed. If F is not closed, then it's not compact by Arzelà-Ascoli. So then, the answer to the first part is no, and the second part would say 2. Riesz's theorem.

But wait, Riesz's theorem is about the dual space. Alternatively, maybe F is compact in another way.

Alternatively, perhaps F is equicontinuous and bounded, so it's relatively compact by Arzelà-Ascoli, but since F is not closed, it's not compact. So the first part is no, the second part is 1. Arzelà-Ascoli.

Wait, but the question is about whether F is sequentially compact. Sequential compactness implies that every sequence in F has a convergent subsequence in F. But if F is not closed, then it's not sequentially compact either.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is no for the first part, and 1 for the second part. So the list is [0,1], which is option D.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me structure this:

1. To determine if F is sequentially compact, which requires being totally bounded and complete. But since F is a subset of C[0,1], which is a complete metric space, if F is compact, it's sequentially compact.

2. Using Arzelà-Ascoli, we require the set to be closed and equicontinuous. Since M is bounded, F is bounded. But F is the image of M under a continuous operator, which is the integral. The integral operator maps bounded functions to bounded functions. Equicontinuity: for each x, the functions f(t) are bounded, so the integral's difference is bounded by M*(x - y), so it's equicontinuous. But since F is the image of M under a continuous function, and M is not necessarily closed, F might not be closed. So Arzelà-Ascoli doesn't directly apply.

Wait, but if F is not closed, then it's not sequentially compact. So perhaps the answer is no for the first part, and 1. Arzelà-Ascoli is used because it's a condition for compactness, but since F isn't closed, it's not compact.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 0 for the first part (F is not sequentially compact) and 1 for the second part (Arzelà-Ascoli is used, though it's not directly applicable because F isn't closed). But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about Arzelà-Ascoli and F being sequentially compact. If F is closed, then by Arzelà-Ascoli, it's compact, hence sequentially compact. But if F isn't closed, then it's not compact.

In this case, is F closed? For that, F is the image of M under the integral operator. Since M is bounded, but not closed in C[0,1], the image F is also not closed. So F is not closed, hence not sequentially compact.

So F is not sequentially compact, so the first part is 0. The second part is whether Arzelà-Ascoli is used. But since F is not closed, Arzelà-Ascoli can't be applied because the theorem requires closure. So perhaps the answer is 0 for the first part and 2. Riesz's theorem for the second part.

Wait, but I'm not sure about Riesz's theorem here. Riesz's theorem is about the dual space of C[0,1], which is L^∞, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe another theorem is applied, like the Banach fixed-point theorem, but that's for contractions, which doesn't seem directly applicable here.

So, perhaps the answer is 0 for the first part and 1 for the second part, because Arzelà-Ascoli is used to show that F is compact (thus sequentially compact), though F isn't closed, but I'm a bit confused because F isn't closed.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about F not being closed. Let me think again. The operator T(f) = ∫₀ˣ f(t)dt is a linear operator, but its image depends on whether M is closed. But M is the set of bounded functions, which is not closed in C[0,1]. So T(M) is not necessarily closed. Therefore, F is not closed. Hence, F is not compact, so not sequentially compact.

So, the first part is 0, and the second part is about which theorem is used. The Arzelà-Ascoli theorem is used in the sense that it's a condition for compactness, but since F is not closed, the theorem doesn't directly apply. So perhaps the second part would say 1. Arzelà-Ascoli, but that's not correct because the theorem isn't applicable.

Wait, but the question says, "using 1. Arzelà-Ascoli, 2. Riesz representation theorem, 3. Banach fixed point theorem, 4. None of the above." So if the answer is 0 for the first part and 1 for the second part, that would correspond to [0,1], which is option D.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that F isn't sequentially compact, so the first part is 0, and the second part is Arzelà-Ascoli is used, but since F isn't closed, it's not compact. So the second part is 1. Arzelà-Ascoli.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Another approach: perhaps F is not sequentially compact because it's not closed. So first part is 0, second part is 1. So [0,1], option D.

Wait, but let me check another angle. Maybe using the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, F is compact, but since it's not closed, it's not sequentially compact. But the question is about the set F being sequentially compact. So if F is compact, then it's sequentially compact.

Wait, but if F is the image of a compact set under a continuous operator, then F is compact. So if M is compact in the space of bounded functions, then F would be compact, hence sequentially compact. But wait, M is not compact in C[0,1], because it's closed and bounded, but not compact. So M is not compact, but F is the image under a continuous operator. So F might not be compact.

But wait, M is a bounded set, so F is a subset of C[0,1], which is a complete metric space. If F is closed, then by Arzelà-Ascoli, it's compact, hence sequentially compact. But F is not closed, so F is not compact.

So F is not sequentially compact. So the first part is 0. The second part is about which theorem is used. Arzelà-Ascoli is used to show compactness, but since F isn't closed, it's not compact. So perhaps the answer is 0 for the first part and 1 for the second part.

Wait, but the question asks about the set F being sequentially compact. So, if F is compact, it's sequentially compact. But since F isn't closed, it's not compact. So F is not sequentially compact. So the first part is 0, and the second part is 1. So the list is [0,1], option D.

Alternatively, perhaps F is not compact, so the answer is no for both parts, which is option J: [0,0]. But that would mean F is not sequentially compact, which may not be the case.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about Arzelà-Ascoli. It's a condition for compactness. So if F is closed, then it's compact, hence sequentially compact. But since F isn't closed, it's not sequentially compact. So the first part is 0, and the second part is 1. So the answer is [0,1], option D.

To determine if the set \( F = \left\{ \int_0^x f(t) \, dt \,\bigg|\, f \in M \right\} \) is sequentially compact, we analyze the conditions using the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem.

1. **Sequential Compactness**: A set is sequentially compact if every sequence has a convergent subsequence within the set. The Arzelà-Ascoli theorem states that a set of continuous functions on a compact interval is relatively compact (sequentially compact) if it is bounded, closed, and equicontinuous.

2. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - **Boundedness**: Each function \( F(x) \) is bounded since \( f \) is bounded. Thus, \( F \) is uniformly bounded.
   - **Equicontinuity**: The integral of a bounded function is equicontinuous. For any \( x, y \in [0,1] \), \( |F(x) - F(y)| \leq M|x - y| \), which is equicontinuous.
   - **Closedness**: \( M \) is the set of all bounded functions, not necessarily closed in \( C[0,1] \). Therefore, \( F \) is not guaranteed to be closed.

3. **Conclusion**: Since \( F \) is bounded and equicontinuous but not necessarily closed, it does not satisfy the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem directly. However, sequential compactness can still hold if \( F \) is compact, which depends on whether it is closed.

4. **Final Answer**: The set \( F \) is not sequentially compact, and the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem is used to show compactness, though it doesn't apply because \( F \) is not closed. Therefore, the first part is 0, and the second part is 1. The list is [0,1], which corresponds to option D.
