Question:

A previously healthy 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department in August 1 hour after the onset of headache, dizziness, nausea, and one episode of vomiting. His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform. He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Administer an epinephrine injection
B: Administer oxygen via a nasal cannula
C: Perform a lumbar puncture
D: Immerse the patient in an ice water bath
E: Apply cold compresses to the forehead
F: Obtain a CT scan of the head
G: Administer a dose of ibuprofen
H: Administer intravenous fluids
I: Administer sodium chloride tablets

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's see what the user has given. So, the situation is a 15-year-old boy who's just come in with a bunch of symptoms. Let me break this down.

First, the patient is a healthy 15-year-old boy. He's 1 hour after the onset of symptoms. The symptoms are headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. They happened during football practice in full uniform. So, football practice can cause muscular strain, especially if done in full contact. It's possible he's been exercising and might have some muscle aches or weakness.

His symptoms started during the first hour, so that suggests it's a minor injury or a minor issue. He reported feeling weak and faint but didn't lose consciousness. So, maybe he's just starting to feel worse, not necessarily having any more issues. He vomited once after drinking water, which is a bit concerning. Also, his temperature is 39.5°C, which is 103.1°F. That's a bit high for a healthy person—maybe he's in a feverish state, or perhaps it's just a fever that's been elevated.

His blood pressure is 90/65 mmHg. That's a bit elevated. Blood pressure can go up in various situations, like dehydration, muscle weakness, or even infections. His pulse is 120/min, which is a normal adult rate, and respirations are 40/min, which is also within normal range. So, his overall health isn't severely concerning, but his condition is urgent.

The exam findings are no other abnormalities, so no heart issues or other signs. So, the question is about treatment.

Looking at the options, let's consider each:

A: Epinephrine. That's like morphine, which is a pain reliever. But the patient has a fever and possibly muscle weakness. Epinephrine might be overused, and he's already weak, so maybe not the best first line.

B: Oxygen via nasal cannula. That's standard for oxygen therapy in injury or post-injury. Vomiting is a common issue in such cases, so oxygen would help with that. But is it the first line? Maybe, but let's keep it in mind.

C: Lumbar puncture. That's for checking internal structures, like the brain or spinal cord, which might be relevant if there's a neurological issue. But the patient didn't report any signs of a neurological problem, just weakness and vomiting, and the blood pressure is elevated. So perhaps this is unnecessary.

D: Ice water bath. That could help with muscle aches and weakness. But the patient is already experiencing weakness, so an ice bath might not address the underlying issue. Or if it's only a minor issue, maybe not the first choice.

E: Cold compresses. He's vomiting, so a cold might help with that. But again, the underlying issue is weakness, which is more urgent.

F: CT scan. That's a good idea to rule out any internal issues, like a brain injury or spinal curvature. Since the patient doesn't have any other signs, a CT could be useful. But the question is about the next step in management.

G: Ibuprofen. That's for pain or inflammation. He's already weak and possibly has muscle aches. Ibuprofen might help, but it's a pain reliever, not an immediate treatment for the symptoms. It might be used as a follow-up if symptoms worsen.

H: IV fluids. That would be for hydration, but his temperature is high, so maybe that's not the main issue. He's already a feverish person.

I: Sodium chloride. That's diuretic, which might help with dehydration. But again, the underlying issue is weakness, not dehydration.

J: Glucose injection. That's for controlling blood sugar, not the current situation.

The most immediate concern is his symptoms: weakness, vomiting, and possible muscle issues due to football. Vomiting is a classic sign of gastrointestinal distress, especially if it's not controlled. No other symptoms suggest internal issues like a brain injury. So, oxygen and ice might be the first steps.

But wait, the patient's symptoms are in the first hour of exercise. So maybe he has muscle weakness due to the exercise. So, the appropriate next step is to treat his symptoms with the right medicine. Waiting for the right treatment would be better than trying to manage with something like oxygen, which might not address the underlying issue.

Looking again, option B is oxygen. But is that the best first-line? Or maybe he's just not feeling better, so applying ice might be more appropriate, but the patient is a 15-year-old, so maybe they have a neurological condition.

Wait, but the patient didn't report any signs of a neurological issue. So, he's probably not having a brain injury. So, a CT scan would be to check for any internal injury. But the question is about the next step for management.

Looking again at the options, the most appropriate treatment for weakness and vomiting would be oxygen. But since he's already not conscious, oxygen might be appropriate. However, sometimes oxygen is given for a short period to cool him down, especially if there's no time to give IV fluids.

Wait, but his blood pressure is elevated, so he needs to be hydrated. Maybe the first step is to give IV fluids, but the question is about the next step after arrival. So, if he's already being treated for dehydration, like with IV fluids, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, the patient has a fever and a weak state. So, their next step is to give oxygen. But why wait for a CT scan? Well, maybe the CT scan is a last resort, but the question is about the next step. So, perhaps the correct treatment is to give oxygen.

Alternatively, the patient's symptoms could be due to muscle weakness from exercise, so he might need a physical exam and then treat with O2. But in the options, B is the best first step.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the patient is 15, might have a neurological issue. So, perhaps he's just overexerting and not having the usual muscle tone. So, oxygen is for the symptoms, but perhaps he needs to be treated for the underlying issue. So, if the patient has a neurological problem, then a CT scan would be needed. But the patient's symptoms haven't indicated any neurological signs yet.

So, the next step is to give oxygen. So, option B: oxygen via a nasal cannula.

Wait, but what about the CT scan? The question is about the next step. So, if the patient is under oxygen, maybe the CT is more about to rule out any internal injury. But the options don't include a CT scan as a management step, except option F. So, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, the patient might benefit from oxygen to cool him down, especially if he's not conscious. So, the immediate treatment is oxygen.

Wait, but what's the best first-line treatment for someone with a fever, vomiting, and muscle weakness? It's O2. Because O2 helps cool him down, which is crucial for a fever. If he doesn't get O2, he might not get the necessary hydration, leading to dehydration, which could cause more severe symptoms. So, yes, O2 is the first line.

So, the correct answer would be B: Administer oxygen via a nasal cannula.

The patient is a 15-year-old boy with symptoms of headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, which began during football practice in full contact. His symptoms were mild, with no conscious loss, and he vomited once. He is currently a feverish 39.5°C (103.1°F), with elevated blood pressure (90/65 mmHg) and normal pulse and respirations. No other abnormalities were noted. The question is the next step in management.

The patient's symptoms are likely due to muscle weakness from the initial exercise. The options provided are evaluated for their relevance and urgency:

- **A: Epinephrine injection** is likely overused and not the first-line treatment for these symptoms.
- **B: Oxygen via a nasal cannula** is the immediate next step, as it helps cool the patient and address vomiting, crucial for a fever.
- **C: Lumbar puncture** is unnecessary as there are no signs of internal injury.
- **D: Ice water bath** could cool the patient but is not the first-line treatment.
- **E: Cold compresses** could help with vomiting but is not urgent.
- **F: CT scan** could rule out internal injuries but is not the next step.
- **G: Ibuprofen** is for pain relief and not the first-line treatment for symptoms.
- **H: IV fluids** would be for hydration but not the immediate need.
- **I: Sodium chloride** would help with dehydration but is not urgent.
- **J: Glucose injection** is unrelated to the current situation.

The best next step is to administer oxygen via a nasal cannula to cool the patient and address the rapid worsening symptoms.
