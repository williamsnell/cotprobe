Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 1 eV. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that de Broglie's equation is lambda equals h over (m times v), right? Or was it lambda equals h over p, where p is momentum? Oh yeah, p is mass times velocity, so yeah, lambda is h divided by (m*v). But wait, I think there's another version when using mass in kg and velocity in m/s. Oh right, because the unit of h is in ergs or something. Oh wait, the unit for h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s, but sometimes it's written in terms of ergs and seconds because 1 J is 10^7 ergs. So I need to make sure the units are consistent.

So the electron has a kinetic energy of 1 eV. I know that kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So I can set that equal to 1 eV and solve for v. But wait, because I need the momentum, which is m*v. Let me think about the steps.

First, perhaps I can find the velocity from the kinetic energy. Since KE = 0.5 * m * v², I can rearrange that to v = sqrt(2*KE/m). M is the mass of the electron, which I think is around 9.11e-31 kg. But wait, sometimes when dealing with eV and mass in grams, I might have to adjust units.

Wait, but for momentum, I need m*v. Alternatively, maybe I can find the momentum using another approach.

Another thought: the de Broglie wavelength is also related to the momentum. So, if I can find the momentum, I can find the wavelength. So, KE = p²/(2m), which gives p = sqrt(2m*KE).

Wait, but the units are important. Let me check. KE is given in eV, which is energy. Mass in kg. So I need to convert eV into joules because the equation for momentum uses SI units.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules. So KE in joules is 1eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV = 1.6e-19 J.

So, p = sqrt(2m * KE). Let's plug in the numbers.

m = 9.11e-31 kg
KE = 1.6e-19 J

So p = sqrt(2 * 9.11e-31 * 1.6e-19) kg·m/s.

Let me compute that inside:

2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30
Multiply by 1.6e-19: 1.822e-30 * 1.6e-19 = 2.9152e-49.

Wait, no, 1.822e-30 * 1.6e-19 is 1.822 * 1.6 = 2.9152, and exponents add: 1e-30 * 1e-19 = 1e-49. So 2.9152e-49.

Then, sqrt(2.9152e-49) = ?

What's the square root of 2.9152e-49? Let me think. The square root of 2.9152 is about 1.707 (since 1.7^2=2.89, 1.707^2≈2.915). The square root of 1e-49 is 1e-24.5, which is 1e-24.5 = sqrt(1e-49)=1e-24.5 = 3.16e-25 (since 1e-30 is 1e-30, so sqrt(1e-30)=1e-15, but 1e-49 is 1e-30 *1e-19, so sqrt is 1e-24.5=1e-24 * sqrt(1e-0.5)=1e-24 * 0.316 ≈ 3.16e-25).

So p is approximately 1.707e-24.5 kg·m/s, which is 1.707e-24.5. Wait, no, wait, 1e-49's square root is 1e-24.5, which is 3.16e-25, as I said. So 1.707e-24.5 is 1.707 * 3.16e-25? No, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express it.

Wait, 2.9152e-49 is equal to (1.707e-24.5)^2, because (1e-24.5)^2 is 1e-49. So sqrt(2.9152e-49) = 1.707e-24.5 kg·m/s.

Wait, 24.5 is 24.5, which is 24 + 0.5. So perhaps it's better to write it in exponent terms.

Wait, alternatively, let's compute it more accurately.

Compute 2 * m * KE:

2 * 9.11e-31 kg * 1.6e-19 J = 2 * 9.11 * 1.6e-50 = (approx) 2 * 14.576e-50 = 29.152e-50 = 2.9152e-49.

Then, square root of 2.9152e-49 is sqrt(2.9152) * sqrt(1e-49).

sqrt(2.9152)=approx 1.707, as before. sqrt(1e-49) is 1e-24.5, which is 3.1623e-25 (since sqrt(1e-49)= (1e-49)^(1/2)=1e-24.5 = 1e-24 * 1e-0.5 = 3.1623e-25).

So p ≈ 1.707 * 3.1623e-25.

1.707 * 3.1623 ≈ let me compute that. 1.7 *3 is 5.1, 1.7*0.1623 is about 0.276, so total around 5.376. So p ≈5.376e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, 1.707 * 3.1623 = let me compute more accurately.

1.707 *3.1623:

Break it down: 1.7 * 3.1623 = ?

1.7 *3 =5.1; 1.7 *0.1623=0.27591. So total 5.37591. Then the 0.007 part: 0.007 *3=0.021; 0.007 *0.1623=0.001136. So adding 0.021 +0.001136 =0.022136. So total p is approximately 5.37591 + 0.022136=5.398. So p≈5.398e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the order of exponents. Because 1e-49 is (1e-24.5)^2, which is 1e-49. So sqrt(2.9152e-49) is 1.707e-24.5.

Which is 1.707 * 1e-24.5 = 1.707 * 3.1623e-25 = 5.398e-25 kg·m/s.

So p ≈5.398e-25 kg·m/s.

Then, the de Broglie wavelength lambda is h / p.

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So lambda = h / p = (6.626e-34 J·s) / (5.398e-25 kg·m/s).

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s². So 6.626e-34 * J·s → 6.626e-34 * (kg·m²/s²) * s = 6.626e-34 kg·m²/s.

So numerator is 6.626e-34 kg·m²/s.

Denominator is 5.398e-25 kg·m/s.

So lambda = (6.626e-34) / (5.398e-25) = (6.626 /5.398) *1e-34/(1e-25) 

Compute 6.626 /5.398 ≈ 1.225.

1e-34 / 1e-25 = 1e-9.

So lambda ≈ 1.225e-9 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see.

Options are given as:

A: 2.48e-8 cm → that's 2.48e-10 m (since 1 cm is 0.01 m). So 2.48e-8 cm = 0.0248e-6 m → wait, no, 1 cm is 1e-2 m. So 2.48e-8 cm is 2.48e-8 * 1e-2 m = 2.48e-10 m.

Option A is 2.48e-8 cm → 2.48e-10 m.

Option B:5.92e7 cm/s → not a wavelength, it's a velocity. So likely wrong.

Option C:8.66e-6 cm → which is 8.66e-8 m.

Option D:3.14e-10 m → looks like part of the result.

Wait, wait. I have lambda ≈1.225e-9 meters. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option H: 4.14e-10 m.

Wait, but my calculation gives 1.225e-9 m. So that's 1.225e-9 m, which is 1.225e-6 cm because 1 m=100 cm. So 1.225e-9 m = 0.001225e-6 m = 1.225e-6 cm? Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters. So 1e-9 m is 1e-7 cm.

Because 1e-9 m = (1e-9 m) * (100 cm/m) )= 1e-7 cm.

Wait, lambda is 1.225e-9 m → which is 1.225e-7 cm.

Looking at the options, option E is 9.81e-4 cm. That's 0.000981 m. I don't think that's right.

Option G:1.23e-7 cm → that's 1.23e-9 m. Oh wait! 1.23e-7 cm is 1.23e-9 m (since 1 cm is 1e-2 m). So 1.23e-7 cm = 1.23e-9 m.

But wait, my calculation was 1.225e-9 m.

So option G is 1.23e-7 cm. So that would be 1.23e-9 m.

Wait, but wait, in my calculation, I have lambda=1.225e-9 m, which is 1.225e-7 cm, because 1e-9 m is 1e-7 cm.

So lambda is approximately 1.225e-9 m → 1.225e-7 cm.

Which is option G: 1.23e-7 cm.

Wait, but wait, did I make any calculation mistakes?

Let me double-check the steps.

Compute p = sqrt(2 m KE).

m = 9.11e-31 kg.

KE =1 eV = 1.6e-19 J.

So 2*m*KE = 2 *9.11e-31 kg * 1.6e-19 J = 2*9.11 * 1.6 * 1e-50 = 29.152e-50 = 2.9152e-49.

Square root of 2.9152e-49: let's compute.

sqrt(2.9152e-49) = sqrt(2.9152) * sqrt(1e-49).

sqrt(2.9152) ≈1.707.

sqrt(1e-49)=1e-24.5 → which is 3.1623e-25.

So p = 1.707 *3.1623e-25 =5.398e-25 kg·m/s.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

lambda= h/p =6.626e-34 /5.398e-25.

Compute that: 6.626 /5.398 ≈1.225 → 1.225e-9 m.

Which is 1.225e-7 cm (since 1e-9 m = 1e-7 cm).

So the correct wavelength is approximately 1.225e-9 meters, which is 1.225e-7 cm.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.23e-7 cm. So that's the right answer.

But wait, let me think again. I've used the relation p= sqrt(2m KE), but is that correct for electron's de Broglie wavelength?

Wait, another approach: using the relation that lambda = h / (sqrt(2 m KE)).

Wait, but I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, sometimes people use 1/2 m v^2 = KE, and v≈sqrt(2 KE/m). Then p= m v ≈ m sqrt(2 KE/m) )= sqrt(2 m KE) → same as before.

So yes, same result.

So the answer should be option G.
</think>

To determine the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 1 eV, we use the relationship:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}, \quad \text{where } p = \sqrt{2m \cdot KE}.
\]

Here:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the electron),
- \( KE = 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) (kinetic energy).

### Step 1: Calculate momentum \( p \)
\[
p = \sqrt{2m \cdot KE} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-19}}.
\]
\[
2 \cdot 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 1.822 \times 10^{-30}, \quad 1.822 \times 10^{-30} \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-19} = 2.9152 \times 10^{-49}.
\]
\[
p = \sqrt{2.9152 \times 10^{-49}} = 1.707 \times 3.1623 \times 10^{-25} \approx 5.398 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate de Broglie wavelength \( \lambda \)
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{5.398 \times 10^{-25}}.
\]
\[
\frac{6.626}{5.398} \approx 1.225, \quad \frac{10^{-34}}{10^{-25}} = 10^{-9}.
\]
\[
\lambda \approx 1.225 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Convert to centimeters
\[
1 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm}, \quad 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 10^{-7} \, \text{cm}.
\]
\[
\lambda \approx 1.225 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated wavelength is \( \lambda \approx 1.225 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to **option G**.
