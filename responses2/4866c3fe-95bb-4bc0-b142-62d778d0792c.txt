Okay, so I've got this problem here about the ratio of toucans to parrots in a zoo. Let me see, the zoo has 15 toucans and 60 parrots. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I'm good to go.

First, I need to remember what a ratio is. A ratio compares the quantities of two things. In this case, it's comparing toucans to parrots. So, the number of toucans is 15, and the number of parrots is 60.

I think ratios can be written in different ways. Like, sometimes it's written as "to" or using a colon. So, the ratio of toucans to parrots would be 15 to 60, or 15:60. Alternatively, it can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor.

Wait, what's the greatest common divisor of 15 and 60? Let's think. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15. The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. So the common factors are 1, 3, 5, 15. The largest one is 15.

So, I can divide both 15 and 60 by 15. 15 ÷ 15 is 1, and 60 ÷ 15 is 4. So the simplified ratio is 1:4. Let me double-check that. 15 toucans and 60 parrots, so 15:60 equals 1:4 when simplified.

Looking back at the options, option G is 5:04, which doesn't match. Option D is 1:04, which is the same as what I got. So D would be 1:04. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 15 is the original number, not 5. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should double-check my calculations. Oh wait, maybe I confused the numbers. Let me read the options again. Option D is 1:04, which is 1 to 4. If I have 15 toucans and 60 parrots, and I divide both by 15, I get 1 and 4, so 1:4. But wait, 60 divided by 15 is 4, yes. So 15:60 simplifies to 1:4, so the ratio is 1:4, which is option D. But wait, wait a minute—hold on. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the options are presented differently. Oh, I see, option D is written as 1:04. Wait, that's 1 to 04, which is 1:4. So that's correct. So the answer should be D. But wait, another thought: sometimes ratios are written as a:b, so 1:4 is correct.

Wait, but wait another point. The options given:

A:1:03
B:60:15
C:4:01
D:1:04
E:3:01
F:15:60
G:5:04
H:1:05
I:4:05
J:5:01

So, yes, D is 1:04. So that's correct. So the answer should be D.

The ratio of toucans to parrots is calculated by dividing the number of toucans (15) by the number of parrots (60), which simplifies to 1:4. This corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
