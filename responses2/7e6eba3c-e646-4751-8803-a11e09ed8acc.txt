Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about molality. Hmm, I remember molality is different from molarity. Let me think. Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent, right? Oh wait, and the question says 49 grams of H2SO4 is dissolved in 250 grams of water. So the solute is H2SO4, and the solvent is water.

Wait, so first I should find the number of moles of H2SO4. The molecular weight given is 98 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass. So 49 grams divided by 98 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 49 divided by 98 is 0.5 moles. So that's 0.5 mol of H2SO4.

Then, the solvent is water, which is 250 grams. But I need to find molality, which is moles of solute per kg of solvent. Oh wait, because kg is the unit for the solvent in molality. So I have 250 grams of water. To convert that to kg, I divide by 1000. So 250 / 1000 is 0.25 kg.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. I think I might have mixed up molality and molarity. Molality uses kg of solvent, so that's correct. So now, molality is moles of solute divided by kg of solvent. So 0.5 moles divided by 0.25 kg. Let me compute that. 0.5 / 0.25 is 2. So molality is 2 moles per kg. So the answer should be option A: 2.0 moles/kg.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't confuse anything. The solute is H2SO4, which is the acid. Yes, that's correct. The solvent is water, so that's correct too. So the calculation seems right. So I think the answer is A.

To determine the molality of the solution, we use the formula:

\[
\text{molality} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}}
\]

1. **Calculate the moles of H₂SO₄**:  
   The molar mass of H₂SO₄ is 98 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{moles of H₂SO₄} = \frac{\text{mass of H₂SO₄}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{49 \, \text{g}}{98 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.5 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Convert the mass of water to kg**:  
   The mass of water is 250 g.  
   \[
   \text{kg of water} = \frac{250 \, \text{g}}{1000} = 0.25 \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate molality**:  
   \[
   \text{molality} = \frac{0.5 \, \text{mol}}{0.25 \, \text{kg}} = 2.0 \, \text{mol/kg}
   \]

Thus, the molality of the solution is 2.0 moles per kilogram of solvent. The correct answer is **A: 2.0 moles/kg**.
