Okay, so I've got this problem here about a dress on sale. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The dress originally costs $47.50, right? And it's being marked down by 30%. I need to find out the total price after the discount and then add the sales tax. Hmm, okay.

First, I think I should calculate the discount amount. A 30% discount means I take 30% of $47.50. Let me compute that. 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form. So, 0.30 multiplied by 47.50. Let me do the math: 47.50 * 0.30. Hmm, 47 times 0.3 is 14.1, and 0.50 times 0.3 is 0.15. So adding those together, 14.1 + 0.15 equals 14.25. So the discount is $14.25.

Wait, no, wait. That doesn't sound right. Because 30% of 40 is 12, and 30% of 7.50 is 2.25, so 12 + 2.25 is 14.25. Yeah, that's correct. So the discount is $14.25.

So the sale price would be the original price minus the discount. That's 47.50 - 14.25. Let me subtract. 47.50 minus 14 is 33.50, and then minus 0.25 more is 33.25. So the price after the discount is $33.25. Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. 47.50 minus 14.25: 47.50 minus 14 is 33.50, minus another 0.25 brings it down to 33.25. Yep, that's correct.

Now I need to add the sales tax, which is 6%. So I have to calculate 6% of $33.25 and add it to the discounted price. Let's see, 6% is 0.06 in decimal. So 0.06 multiplied by 33.25. Let me compute that. 

33 times 0.06 is 1.98, and 0.25 times 0.06 is 0.015. So adding those together, 1.98 + 0.015 equals 1.995. So approximately $1.995, which is about $2.00 when rounded to the nearest cent. 

So now, adding that to the discounted price: 33.25 + 2.00 is $35.25. Wait, but looking at the options, option F is $35.25. So that's the total price.

Wait, but let me just make sure I did everything correctly. 

Original price: $47.50. 30% off. 30% of 47.50 is 14.25. So 47.50 -14.25 = 33.25. Then, 6% tax on 33.25 is 33.25 * 0.06 = 1.995, which is about $2.00. So total is 33.25 + 2.00 = $35.25. So the answer should be F, $35.25.

The dress is discounted by 30%, so the discount is $14.25, bringing the price down to $33.25. Adding 6% sales tax to $33.25 gives a total of $35.25. Therefore, the correct answer is F.

Answer: F: $35.25
