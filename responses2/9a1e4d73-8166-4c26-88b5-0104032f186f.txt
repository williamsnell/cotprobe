Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about freezing point depression and the degree of ionization of HF. Hmm, let's see what I remember. I think the problem gives me some data and asks me to calculate the degree of ionization. 

Alright, let's start breaking it down. The problem states that 10.0 grams of HF is dissolved in 500 grams of H2O, and the freezing point drops to -1.98°C. The freezing point depression constant for water is given as 1.86°C/molal. Wait, right, freezing point depression formula is ΔTf = i*Kf*m, where i is the van't Hoff factor, Kf is the freezing point depression constant, and m is the molality of the solution.

So first, I need to find the molality (m) of the solution. Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The solution has 500 grams of water, which is 0.5 kg. Then, the moles of HF. The mass of HF is 10.0 grams, and the molecular weight is 20.0 g/mol. So moles = mass / m.w. So 10.0 / 20.0 = 0.5 moles.

So molality m = 0.5 moles / 0.5 kg = 1 mol/kg. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 10g /20g/mol is 0.5 mol. 0.5 / 0.5 kg = 1 mol/kg. Oh wait, yes, that's correct.

Then the freezing point depression is ΔTf =1.86 *1 = 1.86°C. But the actual freezing point is -1.98°C, which is a drop of 1.98°C. Wait, but wait, I thought the freezing point goes down. So the calculated ΔTf was 1.86, but observed was 1.98. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait wait, no, the problem says the freezing point is -1.98, so the change is 1.98°C. Oh wait, but the calculation using m=1 gives 1.86. So that's a problem. Did I compute m correctly?

Wait, let me double-check. The mass of HF is 10g, MW 20g/mol: 10/20 =0.5 moles. Mass of solvent is 500g, which is 0.5 kg. So m = 0.5 /0.5 =1 mol/kg. That's correct.

Wait, but then according to the formula, ΔTf should be 1.86 *1=1.86°C. But the solution's freezing point is -1.98, which is a drop of 1.98°C. Hmmm. So that's a problem because 1.86 is less than 1.98. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, maybe the solution is more concentrated, so m is higher. Let me see. Wait, did I compute the mass correctly? Let me recheck. 10g HF in 500g H2O. Yes, 10/20=0.5 mol.

Wait, but maybe the freezing point depression formula needs to be applied differently. Oh wait, maybe the formula is ΔTf = Kf * m, but sometimes it's multiplied by something else. Wait, no, the formula is ΔTf = i*Kf*m. For HF, which is a weak acid, it's a diprotic acid, so the degree of ionization is considered. Wait, but wait, HF is a weak monoprotic acid, so when it dissociates, it produces one H+ ion. So for each HF, it dissociates into H+ and F-.

So the van't Hoff factor i for HF is 1, because it's a weak acid and doesn't dissociate completely. Wait, no, wait, HF is a weak acid, so when it dissociates, it might produce H+ and F^- ions. So the degree of ionization is the fraction that dissociates. Let's denote α as the degree of dissociation. So the van't Hoff factor i is 1 + α (if it doesn't fully dissociate), but wait, no, that's only if it's a weak acid. Wait, no. The van't Hoff factor for a monoprotic weak acid is 1 + α, because each molecule can release one H+ ion. Or is it i=1? Wait, no, the van't Hoff factor is the number of particles in solution. For a monoprotic weak acid that doesn't dissociate completely, each mole of HF gives one mole of H+ and one mole of F^- ions. So the total number of particles is 1 (from HF) +1 (from H+) +1 (from F^-) = 2. So i would be 2. Wait, that can't be right. Because for a strong acid, the i is 1. For a weak acid, the i is 1 + α, but perhaps in this case, the solution's freezing point depression is given, which should account for the number of particles. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for freezing point depression is ΔTf = i*Kf*m. So for a strong electrolyte, i=2 (like NaCl: each molecule gives 2 ions). For a weak acid, i=1 (if it doesn't dissociate). Wait, but wait, in this case, HF is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. So the van't Hoff factor i is 1. Wait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, but let me think about the calculation again. So if the calculated ΔTf is 1.86, but the observed is 1.98, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup. Wait, maybe I should compute the i (van't Hoff factor) based on the freezing point depression and the molality.

So, given ΔTf = i*Kf*m.

We know ΔTf is 1.98°C (since the freezing point is -1.98, which is a drop of 1.98 from 0°C).

So 1.98 = i * 1.86 * m.

But earlier, I found m =1 mol/kg. Let me plug m into the equation.

1.98 = i * 1.86 * 1 → i = 1.98 /1.86 ≈ 1.0645.

Wait, but that can't be possible because for an acid, i should be an integer. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I mixed up the solution. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the problem says that the solution has a freezing point of -1.98. So the solution is more concentrated than the pure water, causing a higher freezing point depression. Wait, no. Wait, pure water's freezing point is 0°C. When you add a solute, the freezing point goes down (because the solute particles lower the freezing point). So if the solute's freezing point is -1.98, the solution is more concentrated.

Wait, but the calculation using m=1 gives a ΔTf of 1.86. But the observed is 1.98. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating molality. Let me check again.

Wait, the mass of H2O is 500g, which is 0.5 kg. The moles of HF is 10/20=0.5. So molality m is 0.5 / 0.5 =1 mol/kg. So that's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps the problem is that I didn't account for the degree of ionization correctly. Because HF is a weak acid, the actual freezing point change depends on the extent of ionization. So perhaps the calculation should involve the degree of ionization.

Wait, perhaps I should first find the number of particles in solution. Let's say the solution is 0.5 moles of HF in 0.5 kg of water. When HF dissociates, it produces H+ and F^- ions. Let's denote the degree of ionization as α. So, the amount that dissociates is α * 0.5 mol. So, the number of ions produced is:

Each HF that doesn't dissociate stays as a molecule: 0.5(1 - α) → each gives 1 mole of HF → contributes 0.5*(1-α) moles of HF, which in solution would remain as 0.5*(1-α) moles.

The dissociated HF (α *0.5) → each gives 1 H+ and 1 F^-.

So total moles of particles:

0.5*(1-α) + α*0.5 + α*0.5 (because each dissociation gives one H+ and one F^-).

Wait, so the total particles are:

(0.5*(1-α)) + α*0.5 + α*0.5 = 0.5 + (α *0.5 + α *0.5) → 0.5 + α * (0.5 +0.5) = 0.5 +α.

So the total number of particles is 0.5 + α.

But wait, wait, wait. That doesn't seem right. Let me recount. The initial moles of HF are 0.5.

After ionization:

Number of HF molecules remaining: 0.5*(1-α).

Each H+ and F^- comes from dissociating HF. So each α mole of HF dissociates, producing α moles of H+ and α moles of F^-.

So the total moles of particles in solution is:

0.5*(1 - α) + α*(1 +1) = 0.5*(1-α) + 2α.

So 0.5(1 - α) + 2α = 0.5 -0.5α +2α = 0.5 +1.5α.

Thus, the number of particles is 0.5 + 1.5α.

But wait, the van't Hoff factor i is the number of particles per formula unit. So for each HF that dissociates, it contributes to the number of particles. So for each mole of HF that dissociates, we get 2 moles of ions (H+ and F^-). But wait, the initial moles of HF is 0.5 mol. So the total moles of particles is 0.5*(1 - α) + 2α = 0.5 +1.5α.

So the van't Hoff factor i for the solution is (0.5 +1.5α) / 0.5, because the initial moles of HF is 0.5, and each mole of HF gives 1 mole of HF, 1 H+, 1 F^- → so per mole of HF, it produces 2 moles of particles. But if not all dissociates, it's 1 + α.

Wait, perhaps this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, since the freezing point depression is given, perhaps we can relate it to the total number of particles, which includes the dissociated HF as ions.

So, let's think again: the freezing point depression formula is ΔTf = i * Kf * m.

We have ΔTf =1.98°C, Kf=1.86, m=1.

So 1.98 = i * 1.86 * 1 → i =1.98 / 1.86 ≈1.0645.

Wait, but i must be an integer, as it's the number of particles each mole contributes. So this suggests that perhaps the calculation is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the freezing point depression is due to the ions produced. Let me re-express the problem.

The solution is 0.5 mol of HF in 0.5 kg of water. The freezing point is depressed by 1.98°C.

So, applying ΔTf = i*Kf*m. Here, m is molality, which is 0.5 /0.5 =1 mol/kg.

So, 1.98 = i * 1.86 * 1 → i=1.98/1.86 ≈1.0645.

But that's not possible because i should be an integer. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution isn't as I assumed. Let's think again. Maybe the solution's molarity is different.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the molality. Wait, the solution is 10g of HF in 500g of H2O. So 0.5 kg of water. So 10g is 0.01 kg. No, wait, 500g is 0.5 kg. So 10g is 0.01 kg. So the mass of solvent is 0.5 kg, which is correct.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps I should account for the degree of ionization α in the calculation of the freezing point depression. Let me define the problem in terms of the degree of ionization.

So, the solution is 0.5 mol of HF in 0.5 kg of water. The degree of ionization is α.

So, the number of HF molecules that dissociate is 0.5 α. So, each dissociation produces 1 H+ and 1 F^-.

Thus, the total number of particles in solution is:

The remaining HF: 0.5(1 - α).

Plus, the H+ and F^- ions: 0.5 α * 2 =α.

Wait, no. Wait, the dissociation of each mole of HF produces two moles of ions. So, if α is the fraction that dissociates, the total number of moles of ions is:

(0.5 - 0.5 α) * 1 (HF remains) + (0.5 α) * 2 (H+ and F^-).

So:

0.5 -0.5 α + 1 α = 0.5 + 0.5 α.

So the total particles is 0.5 + 0.5 α.

But wait, the van't Hoff factor i is the number of particles per mole of solute. So each mole of HF that doesn't dissociate contributes 1 mole of particles, and each mole that dissociates contributes 2 moles of particles. So, for the entire solution, the number of particles is:

mols HF remaining * 1 + mols dissociated * 2.

Which is 0.5*(1 - α) *1 + 0.5 α *2 → 0.5(1 - α) + α.

Which simplifies to 0.5 + 0.5 α.

But the van't Hoff factor i is (total particles) / (moles of solute).

Wait, moles of solute is 0.5 mol. So i = (0.5 + 0.5 α) / 0.5 ) = 1 + α.

So i =1 + α.

So the freezing point depression is ΔTf =i*Kf*m.

We have ΔTf =1.98, Kf=1.86, m=1.

So:

1.98 = (1 + α) * 1.86 *1 → 1+α =1.98 /1.86 ≈1.0645.

Thus, α = 0.0645.

Hmm, but α is the degree of ionization, so it's the fraction that dissociates. So to find the degree of ionization, we just have α=0.0645, which is about 6.45%.

Looking at the options, option C is 6% and option F is 12%. Hmm, but 6.45 is approximately 6% → so option C is 6%.

Wait, but wait, let me check my calculations again because this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, so the formula I used is i =1 + α.

But let's re-calculate.

ΔTf = i * Kf * m.

Given:

ΔTf =1.98°C,

Kf =1.86,

m=1 mol/kg.

So,

1.98 = i * 1.86 *1 → i=1.98/1.86 ≈1.0645.

But i must be an integer because it's the number of particles each mole contributes. Wait, but 1.0645 is not an integer. That suggests that perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't 1 mol/kg. Let me double-check the molality.

Wait, again, the solution is 0.5 moles of HF in 0.5 kg of water. So molality m=0.5 / 0.5=1 mol/kg. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake lies in the assumption of the van't Hoff factor. Wait, HF is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. So the degree of ionization is α, and the van't Hoff factor i is 1 + α.

Wait, but α is about 0.0645, which is about 6.45%. So the degree of ionization is 6.45%, which is approximately 6.45%, which is closest to 6% → so option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me compute the freezing point depression again with the correct i.

So, if i=1.0645, then ΔTf =1.0645 *1.86 *1 ≈1.98°C, which matches the given data.

So that's correct. So the degree of ionization is 6.45%, which is about 6% → so the correct answer should be option C:6%.
</think>

To calculate the degree of ionization of HF, we start by determining the molality of the solution. The solution contains 10.0 g of HF in 500 g of water, which is equivalent to 0.5 kg of water. The molality \( m \) is calculated as:

\[
m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}} = \frac{10.0 \, \text{g}}{20.0 \, \text{g/mol}} \div 0.5 \, \text{kg} = \frac{0.5}{0.5} = 1 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

Next, the freezing point depression formula is applied:

\[
\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m,
\]

where \( \Delta T_f = 1.98 \, \text{°C} \), \( K_f = 1.86 \, \text{°C·kg/mol} \), and \( m = 1 \, \text{mol/kg} \). Substituting these values:

\[
1.98 = i \cdot 1.86 \cdot 1.
\]

Solving for \( i \):

\[
i = \frac{1.98}{1.86} \approx 1.0645.
\]

The van't Hoff factor \( i \) represents the number of particles produced per mole of solute. For HF, which is a weak acid, \( i \) is not an integer because it does not dissociate completely. However, the degree of ionization \( \alpha \) can be related to \( i \) using the expression:

\[
i = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Rearranging for \( \alpha \):

\[
\alpha = i - 1.
\]

Substituting \( i = 1.0645 \):

\[
\alpha = 1.0645 - 1 = 0.0645.
\]

Thus, the degree of ionization \( \alpha \) is approximately \( 6.45\% \). Among the given options, the closest value is **6%**.
