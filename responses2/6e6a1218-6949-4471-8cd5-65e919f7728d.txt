Okay, so I need to answer this question about which organ has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass. Let me think. I remember that energy expenditure is related to how active an organ is and how much it's used daily. 

So, the question asks for the lowest energy expenditure per kg. That means we're looking for the organ that doesn't use as much energy when it's working. 

Let me list out the options:

A: Brain
B: Kidney
C: Liver
D: Skeletal Muscle

I think the skeletal muscle is actually the most active organ. When you exercise, like in a workout, your muscles consume a lot of energy. So D is probably not the answer.

The brain is involved in thinking, decision-making, and memory. It uses a lot of energy, especially when you're awake. So A might not be the lowest. 

The liver is used a lot in metabolism, especially when you're digesting food. So C's probably not the one with the lowest.

That leaves the kidney. The kidneys filter waste products from the blood. I remember that kidney function is actually quite efficient. They don't burn as much energy as, say, muscles. So the kidney might have the lowest energy expenditure here.

Wait, but I should double-check. Are there any other factors? Like, maybe the liver is used a lot in metabolic processes, but the kidney is more about waste removal. Also, some studies suggest that the kidney's energy cost is around 1-2 kcal/kg, which is lower than the brain's, which is higher. Yeah, that makes sense.

The correct answer is **Kidney** (B), as it has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass due to efficient waste removal processes.

Answer: B
