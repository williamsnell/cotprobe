Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about peace studies, and I need to figure out which statement cannot be applied to its initial development. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, I'll read each option carefully and think about what I know about peace studies. I'm a bit rusty on the specifics, but I'll try to recall what I studied.

Option A says that peace studies was initially not recognized as a legitimate academic discipline. Hmm, I remember hearing that peace studies, especially as a formal field, wasn't established until much later. It's possible that it was not widely recognized in academic circles until much later in the 20th century, maybe the 1960s. So if the question is about the initial development, perhaps this statement is correct. But wait, I'm not sure. I'll come back to this.

Option B states that the initial development was influenced by the Cold War political climate. The Cold War was a major historical event, so it's plausible that that's a significant factor in the early development of peace studies. People were probably looking to address tensions, so that makes sense. So B is probably a correct statement about the initial development.

Option C claims mathematicians and natural scientists joined the field, which was otherwise a social-science area. I think that's true. The early days of peace studies required quantitative methods, so mathematicians and scientists would have been key contributors. This makes sense, so C is probably a correct statement.

Option D says that the field was initially developed by historians and anthropologists. Wait, I thought that was more in line with social studies, not exactly peace studies. History was a big part of it, but the field itself, if it's more academic, might have been developed by scholars with a broader academic background. I'm not sure, but I'm leaning towards this being incorrect because I think the initial development was more from social scientists, not necessarily specifically from history and anthropology. So maybe D is the correct answer.

Option E: Early work was in North America and Scandinavia. I know that the early peace studies were indeed conducted in North America before the Cold War. Scandinavia, as part of Canada, definitely contributed. So E is a correct statement.

Option F: Early work was by government agencies. I think that's more common in fields like public health or military science. Peace studies might have been more academic initially, so government agencies might not have been the primary contributors. So F might not be a correct statement.

Option G says that research institutes were established across the world. That seems more recent. I recall that research institutes were established much later, like in the 20th century, so G might not be correct about the initial development.

Option H: Creation of journals was a prominent feature until late in the 20th century. I'm not sure about this. I think journals were in existence before, but perhaps they were more prominent in the 20th century. Wait, I think journals have been around longer. So H's statement might not be correct, but I'm not certain. It depends on the timeframe.

So, the question is asking which statement CANNOT be applied to the initial development of peace studies. Let's go back.

A: Initially not recognized. I'm pretty sure that's correct. The field was not widely recognized as a legitimate discipline until much later.

B: Influenced by Cold War. True.

C: Mathematicians and natural scientists joined. True.

D: Initially developed by H and A. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. I thought the early development was from social scientists, but maybe some early work was from these fields. Alternatively, perhaps it's not. I'll need to think more.

E: North America. Definitely correct.

F: Government agencies. Probably not correct.

G: Research institutes across the world. I think that's more recent. So G is incorrect.

H: Creation of journals. Maybe accurate, but I'm not sure.

So the options that are correct are A, B, C, E, G. The incorrect ones are D, F, H.

The question is about which statement CANNOT be applied. So the correct answer would be the statement that is incorrect.

Looking again at D: Did early work in peace studies have more than history and anthropology? I thought maybe not. Maybe the field was initially more academic, so perhaps it started with scholars from various fields, not just H and A. So D might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe not. I'm a bit unsure.

If I'm forced to pick the one that's a correct statement, then H is incorrect because journals weren't prominent until late in the 20th century. Wait, noâ€” journal creation was more a recent development. My study might have been older, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, I've read that the establishment of journals was more of a later development. So H's statement is incorrect because the creation of journals wasn't a prominent feature until later. Or wait, maybe it was that journals were established earlier. I'm a bit confused.

But going back to the question, the options are about what cannot be applied. So the correct answer would be the one that's not applicable.

So the options are:

A: Initially not recognized. Correct.

B: Influenced by Cold War. Correct.

C: Correct.

D: Initially by H and A. Not sure, I thought maybe more social scientists.

E: North America. Correct.

F: Government agencies. Incorrect.

G: Research institutes worldwide. Incorrect.

H: Journals were prominent until late 20th century. Hmm. I'm not certain. I thought that journals were established earlier, but I'm not sure. Maybe in the early 20th century. So H's statement is incorrect because it says they were prominent until late in the 20th century. If journal creation happened earlier, then this statement would be wrong.

Wait, the question is about which cannot be applied. So which statement is incorrect about the initial development.

Wait, the question is asking which statement cannot be applied. So the correct answer is the statement that is incorrect.

So:

Option D: Did early work in peace studies have more than H and A? I'm not sure. I thought that early work was from a range of fields, but maybe it wasn't specifically H and A. Alternatively, maybe that's correct.

Wait, I think in the early days of peace studies, the primary researchers were social scientists, not necessarily just history and anthropology. So D might be correct in that early work was helped by social scientists, so D is correct, making it a correct statement, not the answer.

So the question is which statement CANNOT be applied. So the incorrect statement is F, because early work was mainly by government agencies. Alternatively, option F could be incorrect.

Wait, so the options are:

Which statement cannot be applied to initial development.

So the incorrect statement is F. Because I think early work in peace studies was more academic, involving social scientists, not government agencies.

So looking at options:

F: Early work was primarily conducted by government agencies. That's incorrect. So F cannot be applied, making it the correct answer.

So the answer would be F.

Wait, but wait. I'm not entirely sure about D. Did early work in peace studies come mainly from H and A? I think that's the case. For example, I recall that some early work in peace studies was done by historians and anthropologists, but perhaps more so. So D is correct, so it's not the answer.

So putting it all together, the incorrect statement is F: Early work was primarily by government agencies.

The question asks which statement cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies. Here's the breakdown:

- **Option A**: Correct. Peace studies was initially not recognized as a legitimate academic discipline.
- **Option B**: Correct. The initial development was influenced by the Cold War's political climate.
- **Option C**: Correct. Mathematicians and natural scientists joined the field, enhancing interdisciplinary nature.
- **Option D**: Correct. Early work was influenced by social scientists like Historians and Anthropologists.
- **Option E**: Correct. Early work was primarily conducted in North America and Scandinavia.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Early work was not primarily conducted by government agencies.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Research institutes were established much later, not as a prominent feature of the field until late in the 20th century.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The creation of journals was more prominent in the early 20th century, not until late.

The correct answer is **F**, as it cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies.
