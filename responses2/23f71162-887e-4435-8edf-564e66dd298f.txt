Okay, so I've got this question here: "Objects that absorb light appear..." And the options are A to J, including things like blue, red, dark, white, etc. Hmm, I need to figure out what the correct answer is.

Wait, this is about how objects look based on their color and how they absorb light. I remember something about light and color. Oh right, in the electromagnetic spectrum, different colors are different wavelengths. Blue has a shorter wavelength than red, which is longer. 

So when an object absorbs light, it reflects less and absorbs more. The color we see is essentially the color that is reflected, not absorbed. So if an object absorbs more blue light, it would reflect red light because blue is absorbed. That would make it appear red. Because when you absorb blue, you're taking away the blue, so the remaining light is red. 

Wait, but isn't it the opposite? Like, if an object absorbs red light, it reflects blue. So the object appears blue. So if an object absorbs blue, it reflects red, making it appear red. So the answer should be B: red.

Let me think about it again. Suppose a red object. When it absorbs red light, it reflects blue. So the color we see is blue. But if it's blue, it absorbs blue and reflects red, so it appears red. So the object's color depends on which light it absorbs. So if it's blue, it appears red. So the correct answer is blue absorbs light, appears red. So the question is, which color is the object if it absorbs light. The object appears red because it's reflecting blue, which is absorbed. So the correct answer is B: red.

The correct answer is B: red. When an object absorbs light, it reflects the color that is not absorbed. If an object absorbs blue light, it reflects red light, making it appear red. 

Answer: B
