Question:

Two years ago, a developer conveyed title to a lot to a woman by warranty deed. The woman purchased an owner's policy of title insurance before the an owner's policy of title insurance before the closing. Because of an error by the title insurance company, the title commitment and title policy failed to list a county tax lien encumbering the lot as an exception to coverage. Last year, the woman conveyed the lot for a bargain price by a quitclaim deed to a friend, who paid cash, did not conduct a title search, and did not purchase title insurance. Subsequently, the county began proceedings to foreclose the tax lien, and the friend filed a claim with the woman's title insurance company, demanding that the company reimburse her for the tax lien amount. Is the title insurance company obligated to pay the friend's claim?

Options:

A: No, because the friend did not conduct a title search before purchasing the lot.
B: No, because the friend did not purchase her own title insurance.
C: No, because the title insurance policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend.
D: Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.
E: No, because the woman no longer owns the property, and thus her title insurance is no longer valid.
F: Yes, because the woman used a quitclaim deed, which means all encumbrances should transfer to the new owner.
G: No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.
H: Yes, because the friend paid cash, making her eligible for claims.
I: Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.
J: Yes, because the title insurance company made an error in not listing the tax lien.

Okay, so I've got this real estate question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a developer conveying a lot to a woman by a warranty deed two years ago. The woman bought an owner's policy of title insurance before closing, which is a bit confusing. I remember that an owner's policy (OP) is a type of title insurance that covers the principal and interest of the property. So she was paying for it using her OP.

Now, the problem says there was an error by the title insurance company that caused the title commitment and policy to fail to list a county tax lien as an exception. A tax lien is a lien against the property, so if it's not listed, it means the company didn't recognize it as a covered item. That would mean the coverage was incomplete.

Last year, the woman sold the lot at a bargain price with a quitclaim deed to a friend. A quitclaim deed doesn't create a remainder; it just transfers the ownership to the new owner without allowing them to sell the property. The friend paid cash and didn't do a title search. Also, she didn't purchase title insurance, which might have been necessary for the friend to claim the tax lien.

The friend then sued the title insurance company for reimbursement. The question is whether the insurance company is obligated to pay the friend's claim.

Looking at the answer options from A to J, I need to determine which option is correct.

First, I think about the principles of title insurance. When you transfer property, you need to ensure that the new owner is in possession. A quitclaim deed doesn't create a remainder, so the friend becomes the owner of the property. But if the property was encumbered by a tax lien, which wasn't covered by the OP, then the company didn't recognize it as a covered item.

When a title company sells property with an exception (like a tax lien), the new owner must purchase title insurance to cover the cost. So, if the friend bought the title insurance, they would have to pay for the lien.

But wait, the friend didn't purchase the title insurance. She just sold the lot, and the friend is the new owner. If the title insurance policy wasn't updated or renewed, the friend doesn't have coverage. So the company might not have covered the friend.

But let's consider the options again.

Option A: No, because the friend didn't conduct a title search before purchasing. If a title search was necessary to look for exceptions, and if the friend didn't do it, maybe the exception wasn't recognized. But wait, the exception was already listed as an exception when the company failed to list it. So if the company failed to list it, the friend isn't covered. But if she didn't do a title search, does that matter?

Hmm, I'm not sure about that. The problem states that the exception was already listed, meaning the company didn't list it as an exception. So the friend isn't covered regardless of whether she did a title search or not. So option A might be incorrect because the friend isn't in possession without title coverage, which the OP provided.

Wait, but the OP was purchased before closing. So the OP is valid because it was in place when the property was transferred. So the friend owns the property, but without coverage, she can't claim the lien.

So the question is whether the company is obligated to pay. The friend can't claim unless the title is valid. So if the title is valid, the friend's claim is invalid, and the insurance company shouldn't have to pay.

Option B: No, because the friend didn't purchase her own title insurance. That makes sense. If the friend doesn't have the necessary title insurance, she can't claim. So the company doesn't have to pay because she can't even prove ownership.

But wait, the friend sold the property with a quitclaim deed, which means she became the owner without a remainder. So she is the owner and is allowed to claim. But she didn't purchase title insurance. So she can't claim, so the company isn't obligated to pay.

Wait, but wait another point. The woman's OP was valid when she sold the property. So the friend is the owner, and she needs to prove ownership, which she didn't. So the company can't claim because she didn't have the necessary title insurance.

So option B says the company is not obligated because she didn't purchase her own title insurance. That makes sense because the friend has no title insurance.

Option C: No, because the policy expired when the woman conveyed to the friend. The policy's expiration doesn't affect whether the friend can claim. The policy's validity is already in place when she gave the quitclaim deed. The problem is whether she had the right to sell. But since the friend only paid cash, the title insurance might not cover her as she's the new owner.

Wait, no. The friend is the owner, so she needs title coverage. But she didn't purchase her own title insurance. So the company isn't obligated.

Option D: Yes, because the tax lien wasn't covered. That's not right because if the exception wasn't listed, the company didn't recognize it. So the friend isn't covered regardless.

Option E: No, because the woman no longer owns. But the woman sold it, so she's the owner. So E isn't correct.

Option F: Yes, because the friend didn't purchase title insurance. That's correct because she can't claim without it.

Option G: No, because the friend isn't a named insured. She's the new owner, so she should be insured. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Yes, because the friend paid cash. She's the owner, so she's entitled to the lien. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Yes, because the woman is liable. But the woman sold the property, so she's the owner. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Yes, because the company made an error. But the error was in the company's part, but she did everything right (quitclaim deed, paid cash, no title insurance). So J's reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, but the friend didn't purchase title insurance. So the company doesn't have coverage. So the correct answer is B: No, because the friend did not purchase her own title insurance.

Another point: The friend's ownership is subject to title insurance. If she didn't have it, she can't claim. So the company isn't obligated to pay.

The correct answer is **B: No, because the friend did not purchase her own title insurance.**

### Explanation:
When the woman conveyed the property to her friend, she sold it with a quitclaim deed, making the friend the owner. The friend then sold the property for a bargain price, and the friend paid cash, making her eligible for claims. However, the friend did not purchase title insurance, which is necessary to claim the tax lien. Since the friend lacks title insurance, she cannot claim the tax lien, and the title insurance company is not obligated to reimburse her claim. The key issue is that the friend's failure to purchase title insurance means she lacks the necessary coverage to claim the tax lien.
