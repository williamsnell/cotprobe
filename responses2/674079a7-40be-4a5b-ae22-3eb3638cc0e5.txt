Question:

A farmer was the fee-simple owner of a tract of land inthe country. The farmer moved to the city in 1986. Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wanted to move back to the tract because he desired to return to the country. Finding the man in possession, the farmer initiated a suit in ejectment against the man. The most probable judicial determination would be

Options:

A: the farmer would lose, because he had abandoned the property for over 20 years.
B: the farmer would win, because the man had not paid property taxes during his occupancy.
C: the farmer would lose, because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.
D: the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.
E: the farmer would win, because the man did not have legal documentation of ownership.
F: the farmer would win, because the man had left the property for a year.
G: the farmer would win, because the man's possession was not continuous.
H: the farmer would lose, because the man was the current resident of the property.
I: the farmer would win, because he is the titleholder of record.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a case involving adverse possession and possibly eviction based on the statutory period. Hmm.

So, the farmer moved to the city in 1986. Then, in 1987, someone named Aman took over and stayed on the land until 1997. Then he left for his sick mother for one year, returning the next year, 1999. The state's statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. The farmer wants to move back in 2010 because he wants to return to the country.

So, the key here is the admissibility of Aman's possession. Adverse possession comes into play when someone else takes over a property and remains for a period longer than the statutory period. The state's rule here is that the man must remain for 20 years after taking over. Wait, but when was he in possession?

Wait, Aman took over in 1987 and stayed until 1997, which is 10 years. Then he left in 1998 and came back in 1999. So, from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years. But wait, that's after he left and came back. So, the question is about whether the man was in possession when the farmer wanted to evict him.

Wait, the farmer wants to move back. So he tried to evict Aman when he was moving back. So, the period of Aman's possession is from 1987 to 1997 (10 years) and then again from 1999 to 2010 (11 years, but the state's period is 20 years from when he took over. Or is it the duration after taking over?

Wait, the rule is that adverse possession is considered when someone remains for a period longer than the statutory period. So, the statutory period is 20 years. So, if someone takes over and stays for more than 20, they are considered adverse.

Wait, the question says the state's period is 20 years. So, if someone remains for 20 years or more, they are considered adverse.

In this case, Aman was in possession of the property from 1987 to 1997 (10 years) and then again from 1999 to 2010 (11 years). But the period is based on when he took over.

Wait, the statutory period is 20 years from when the possession begins. So, if the man remains for 20 years or more after taking over, he's considered an adverse possessor.

But in this case, Aman took over in 1987, and the state period would be from 1987 onwards. So, if he remained for 20 years, that would be from 1987 to 1997 (20 years exactly). But when he left, he returned in 1999, so that's 2 years after his initial 20-year period (1987-1997). Then, he stayed again from 1999-1999+11=2010? Wait, but the state period is 20 years. Wait, perhaps the state period is the duration after taking over, so if someone stays for 20 years or more, they are considered adverse.

So, Aman took over in 1987. If he remains for 20 years, that would end in 1987+20=1997. But he stayed until 1997, which is exactly 20 years. Then, he left, and the next time he comes back is in 1999, which is 2 years after his original 20-year period. So, from 1987 to 1997 is 10 years, then again from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years.

Wait, but the state's period is 20 years. So, Aman's first 20 years would be 1987-1997. Then, he was away for 2 years (1998-1999) and came back again in 1999, which is the next 20 years would be 1999-2018. But he stayed only until 2010, so that's 11 years instead of 20.

So, the state's rule is that if someone remains for a period longer than the statutory 20 years, they are considered adverse. So, in this case, Aman was in possession but only for 11 years after his second entry. So, the problem is whether he met the required period.

Wait, but the period for adverse possession is when a person remains for a period longer than the statutory 20 years. So, if the period is 20 years or more, they're considered adverse. So, in this case, Aman was in possession for 10 years (1987-1997) and then for 11 years (1999-2010). But the state period is 20 years from when he took over. So, for the first time, he was in possession for 10 years, then 11 years again. So, neither of those is longer than 20, I think. Wait, wait, no.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Adverse possession is when someone remains on a property for a period longer than the state's statutory period of 20 years. So, if someone remains for 21 years or more, they are considered adverse.

But in this case, Aman took over in 1987. The first time he stayed was 10 years (1987-1997). Then he left for a year, and came back again in 1999, which is 11 years. So, the first time he was in possession was 10 years. If the state requires 20 years, then 10 is less than that. So, the first period is not long enough. The second period, 11 years, is still less than 20, so it's not considered adverse.

Wait, but the question is about the farmer trying to evict him. So, the question is whether the man is considered adverse possession. Because the farmer is suing for eviction because the man was in an adverse position.

Ah, wait, no. The farmer is the one who moved into the property. Wait, no. Wait, the farmer moved in 1986. So, he was the one who moved into the city in 1986. Then, in 1987, Aman took over and stayed for 10 years (1987-1997). Then he left, came back in 1999, and the state is considering whether the farmer is allowed to evict him.

Wait, but the problem is about the farmer trying to evict Aman because he was in an adverse position. So, when the farmer tried to evict Aman, he was the one who wanted to leave because Aman was considered adverse.

Wait, but the state's rule is that the man must remain for 20 years; otherwise, the farmer, being the titleholder, can take him out.

So, the farmer is the one who's suing for eviction. So, the question is whether the man is considered adverse possession, leading to eviction.

So, the initial period is 10 years (1987-1997). Then, he left, and came back in 1999. But the state's period is 20 years. So, from when he took over (1987), he was in possession for 10 years (1987-1997). Then, he was away for two years (1998-1999), and then came back for 11 years (1999-2010). So, in total, he was in possession for 10 years plus 11 years, but the state's rule is 20 years or more.

So, the first time, he was in possession for 10 years, which is less than 20. The second time, 11 years, still less. So, neither of those periods meets the requirement. Therefore, he's not considered adverse possession.

Wait, but then, the state requires 20 years from when he took over. So, if he stayed 20 years, he's considered adverse. But in this case, he only stayed 10 years and then 11, but the first time was only 10. So, none of his periods are longer than 20. So, he's not considered adverse possession.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 'lose' as the answer. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the man was in possession for 20 years or more. Let me re-examine the timeline.

Aman took over in 1987. He stayed until 1997, which is 10 years. Then, he left for a year, and came back in 1999, which is 2 years later. So, that's 2 years in 1998 and 1999. Then, in 1999, he stayed again for 11 years until 2010. So, the first period was 1987-1997 (10 years). Then, 1999-2010 (11 years). So, 10 years is less than 20.

Wait, but is the state period 20 years from when he took over, or 20 years from the start of his stay?

Hmm, state's period is 20 years from when he took over. So if he took over in 1987, and left in 1998, that's 11 years, which is less than 20. So, not adverse.

So, the first time, he was in possession for 10 years, which is less than 20. The second time, 11, which is still less than 20.

So, neither time he met the required 20 years. So, he's not considered adverse possession.

Wait, that would mean the farmer doesn't have the right to evict him because he's not in an adverse position. But the options don't have 'lose' as the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: farmer would lose, because he had abandoned for over 20.

B: farmer would win, because property taxes not paid.

C: farmer loses because possession was open, hostile, and continuous.

D: farmer loses because he fulfilled the statutory period.

E: farmer wins because no legal docs.

F: farmer wins because left for a year.

G: farmer wins because not continuous.

H: farmer loses because he's the titleholder.

I: farmer wins because he's the record.

J: farmer loses because man had made improvements.

So, the question is, does the man meet the required 20 years?

Wait, perhaps the key here is that the man's first period of 10 years is less than 20, so he's not considered adverse. So, the farmer can't evict him for that period.

But the options don't have 'lose' as the correct one. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous. Oh, option C. So, the state requires that the man must be in possession for a period longer than the statutory 20 years. So, if he remains for 20 years or more.

But in this case, he stayed only for 10 years and then 11. So, the first time he was in possession was 10 years. If the state requires 20 years, then he's not considered adverse. So, the first time, he wasn't. So, the farmer can't evict him for that.

Wait, but the options are about the judge's determination. So, in this case, the judge would find that the man wasn't in adverse possession because neither of his periods met the 20-year requirement.

Wait, but the options don't have 'lose' as the correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario.

Wait, the man left the property for a year. So, after 1997, he left, and came back in 1999. So, between 1997 and 1999, he was not in possession. So, that's a gap of two years. Does that affect the calculation? Hmm, perhaps, but if the state's period is 20, then the man's first period was 10 years, so no.

Wait, but wait: when the man left, he was not in possession. So, the period after he left is not considered. So, the only periods when he was in possession are 1987-1997 (10 years) and 1999-2010 (11 years). But 10 and 11 are both less than 20. So, he's not in adverse possession.

So, the farmer can't evict him because he isn't in adverse possession. So, the judge would find him not in adverse possession, allowing the farmer to evict him, which would mean the farmer loses because the farmer is the titleholder.

Wait, but option H says the farmer would lose because he's the titleholder. But that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, no. If the man remains for 20 years, he's considered adverse. In this scenario, he only remained for 10 years. So, the first time, he didn't meet. The second time, 11, which is still less than 20. So, he's not considered adverse.

So, the farmer can't evict him because he's not in adverse possession. So, the judge would find him not in adverse, so the farmer can evict, meaning the farmer loses.

Looking at the options, option H says the farmer would lose because he's the titleholder. But that's not necessarily correct. Because being the titleholder (as in, the farmer took over) allows the farmer to evict the man when he's in adverse possession.

Wait, but option I says the farmer would win, because he is the titleholder. So, the correct determination is that the farmer can evict the man, so the farmer would lose.

Wait, but the question is, the farmer wants to move back. So, if the farmer is the titleholder, he can evict the man for proceeding with the transfer. So, the farmer would lose because he's the titleholder. Therefore, the correct answer is H.

But wait, the options are A to J, each a possible answer. Let me think again.

So, the man remained for 10 years and then for 11. The state requires 20 years. So, neither of these periods meets the requirement. So, the man is not in adverse possession, allowing the farmer to evict him.

So, the farmer would lose the eviction. Therefore, the correct answer is H: the farmer would lose, because he's the titleholder.

Wait, but the options are about the judge's determination. So, the farmer's standing is that he's the titleholder, so he can evict the man. So, the court would determine that the man is not in adverse possession, allowing the farmer to evict him, which means the farmer loses.

Looking at the options, answer H says the farmer would lose because he's the titleholder. That's correct.

The question revolves around the legal determination regarding adverse possession and eviction in a state with a statutory period of 20 years. Aman, the man, took over the farmer's property in 1987 and remained for 10 years (1987–1997) before leaving and returning again in 1999, lasting for 11 years. The state requires a period of 20 years to qualify as an adverse possessor. 

### Key Points:
1. **Adverse Possession Criteria**: Adverse possession is determined by the state's statutory period of 20 years. If someone remains in possession for more than this period, they are considered adverse, and the titleholder (the original owner) can evict them.

2. **Aman's Periods of possession**:
   - First period: 1987–1997 (10 years), which is less than the statutory 20-year requirement.
   - Second period: 1999–2010 (11 years), still less than 20 years.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The farmer did not abandon the property for over 20 years.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. Aman had not paid property taxes during his occupancy.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The man's possession was not considered hostile or continuous.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The man did not fulfill the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The man did not have legal documentation of ownership.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The man had left the property for a year.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The man's possession was not continuous.
   - **Option H**: Correct. The farmer would lose because the man was not in adverse possession, as neither of his periods of possession met the 20-year requirement.

### Conclusion:
The farmer would lose because the man was not in adverse possession, as neither of his periods of possession met the statutory 20-year requirement. The farmer's standing as the titleholder allows them to evict the man, making the farmer lose.
