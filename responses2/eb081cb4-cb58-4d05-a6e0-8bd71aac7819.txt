Okay, so I have this question about counting the number of trees on 5 unlabeled vertices. Hmm, I remember that trees in graph theory are connected acyclic graphs. The problem is about unlabeled trees, meaning that the vertices don't have any specific labels, so the count depends on the structure rather than the arrangement.

I think the number of trees on n vertices is given by something called Cayley's formula. Oh right, Cayley's formula states that the number of labeled trees on n vertices is n^(n-2). So for 5 vertices, that would be 5^(5-2) = 5^3 = 125. But wait, that's the number of labeled trees. The question is about unlabeled trees, which is a different count.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. The question is about unlabeled trees, so I think it's not about labeled trees. So I need to find the number of non-isomorphic trees with 5 vertices.

I remember that the number of non-isomorphic trees is given by the sequence A000058 in the OEIS. Let me try to recall the values. For n=1, it's 1. For n=2, it's 1. n=3, it's 2. n=4, it's 3. n=5, it's 5. So wait, that would mean 5 is the answer. Looking at the options, option J is 5. So it should be J.

The question asks for the number of unlabeled trees on 5 vertices. The correct answer is 5, which corresponds to option J.

Answer:
J: 5
