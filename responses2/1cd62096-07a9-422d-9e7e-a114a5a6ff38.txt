Okay, so I have this problem about finding the shortest path in an undirected graph. The graph G has edges E = {<0,2>,<2,1>,<2,3>,<3,4>,<4,1>}. I need to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 0. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I should probably visualize the graph. Let me sketch the nodes and their connections. So, the nodes are 0,1,2,3,4. The edges connect them as follows:

- 0 is connected to 2.
- 2 is connected to 0, 1, 3.
- 3 is connected to 2 and 4.
- 4 is connected to 3 and 1.
- 1 is connected to 2 and 4.

Wait, no, looking again, 1 is connected to 2 and 4, and 4 is connected to 3 and 1. So, the structure is like a diamond: 0-2-3-4, and 4 is also connected to 1, which is connected to 2.

So, the graph looks like this:

0 connected to 2.

2 connected to 0, 1, 3.

3 connected to 2, 4.

4 connected to 3 and 1.

1 connected to 4 and 2.

I need to find the shortest path from 4 back to 0. The shortest path is the one with the least number of edges.

I can approach this using BFS (Breadth-First Search), which is typically used for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

Let's list all possible paths from 4 to 0 and see which is the shortest.

Option 1: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0. How many steps? Let's count the edges. 4 to 3 is one, 3 to 2 is two, 2 to 0 is three. Wait no, for the number of edges, 4 to 3 is one edge, 3 to 2 is another, 2 to 0 is third. So that's 3 steps.

Option 2: 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. Let's see: 4 to 1 is one, 1 to 2 is two, 2 to 0 is three. So again, 3 steps.

Option 3: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0. That's four steps, which is longer.

Option 4: 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 0. That's way longer, not the shortest.

So, the shortest paths are either 4-3-2-0 or 4-1-2-0. Both have 3 edges. So, which one is correct?

Wait, looking back: The options given are a list of possible paths. Let me check which of the options matches either of these.

Option A: [4,3,1,0] → 4 to 3, then 1, then 0. So that's three steps. But wait, is 3 connected to 1? Yes, because 3 is connected to 2 and 4, so 3-1 is an edge. So, 4 to 3, then 3 to 1, then 1 to 0. So that's correct.

Option B: [4,2,1,0]. Let's see: 4 to 2 (edge), 2 to 1 (edge), 1 to 0 (edge). So that's three steps. That's another correct path.

Wait, but wait, the question says "Represent the path as a list." So both A and B are correct in terms of being shortest, but let's check the options.

Wait, the options are A to J, and each is a list of nodes. Looking at the options:

Option A: [4,3,1,0] → 4 to 3 (edge), then 3 to 1 (edge), then 1 to 0 (edge). That's correct.

Option B: [4,2,1,0] → 4-2, 2-1, 1-0. Correct.

So both A and B are valid shortest paths. But wait, looking at the answer choices, the options are single letters. So, which one is the correct answer?

Wait, I must have made a mistake because the options don't seem to have both A and B as correct. Or wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the BFS traversal order.

Wait, let me think again. So, in BFS, the order in which nodes are discovered is level by level. Let's see.

Start at 4 (level 0). Then, neighbors are 3 and 1. So, level 1: 3 and 1.

Then, for each of those:

3's neighbors are 2 and 4 (4 is already visited).

1's neighbors are 2 and 4.

So, level 2: nodes 2 (from 3 and 1). So, when considering 2, it can go to 0 or 1? Wait, no, 3's other connection is 2, and 1's is 2 and 4.

Wait, let's think of the BFS in order.

Level 0: 4.

Level 1: 3, 1.

Level 2: from 3, 2; from 1, 2. So, 2 is added to level 2.

Level 3: from 2, can go to 0 and 3. But 3 is already in level 1. So, 0 is added to level 3.

So, the shortest path is either 4-3-2-0 or 4-1-2-0.

Hmm, so which option is correct? Let's look at the options.

Option A: [4,3,1,0] → 4-3-1-0. So, 4 to 3, 3 to 1, 1 to 0. That's three steps.

Option B: [4,2,1,0] → 4 to 2, 2 to 1, 1 to 0. Also three steps.

Wait, but in the BFS traversal, the first time a node is visited, it's via the shortest path. So, the order in which nodes are discovered is:

4 (level 0), 3 (level 1), 1 (level 1), 2 (level 2), 0 (level 3).

So, the first node at level 3 is 0. So, the path from 4 to 0 is 4-3-2-0 or 4-1-2-0.

So, how do these paths look in the options?

Looking at the options:

Option A: [4,3,1,0] → 4-3-1-0. That's 4 to 3, 3 to 1, 1 to 0. So, the path is 4-3-1-0. But wait, in BFS, the order is 4 ->3, then 3 ->2, then 2->1, then 1->0. So, the path via 3-2-1-0 would be a different one, but it's not in the options.

Wait, the question is asking for the shortest path. So, both A and B are possible, but the options may have both. Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A is 4-3-1-0.

Option B is 4-2-1-0.

Option C is 4-3-2-0 → which is the other possible path.

So, perhaps both A and C are possible, but the given options include both. However, looking at the options, the correct answer is either A or C.

Wait, but the question is, what's the shortest path. So, which of the two is considered the shortest? Since both have the same number of steps, three edges, they are both shortest. However, in the options, both A and C are present.

Wait, but wait, the options are A to J. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: [4,3,1,0]

B: [4,2,1,0]

C: [4,3,2,0]

D: [4,1,0]

E: [4,3,2,1,0]

F: [4,3,1,2,0]

G: [4,1,3,2,0]

H: [4,3,0]

I: [4,1,2,0]

J: [4,2,3,1,0]

So, the correct paths are A, B, C, H, I, J.

Wait, but how to choose between A, B, and C.

Wait, the BFS traversal path would have 4 visited, then 3 and 1. So, the next nodes to visit are 2 (from 3) and 2 (from 1). So, when processing 2, it can go to 0 and 3.

So, the first time 0 is visited is in level 3. So, the shortest path is either 4-3-2-0 or 4-1-2-0. So, both A and C are correct.

Wait, but in the options, both A and C are present, but the question asks to choose one. Oh, wait, perhaps I need to check the paths and see which one is present in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4-3-1-0 → which is 4→3→1→0. But in the BFS, from 3, the next node is 2, not 1. So, perhaps this isn't the correct path. Wait, but in the BFS, when 3 is processed, it's connected to 2, so 2 is added to the queue. So, 3's neighbor 1 is not processed until 1 is processed. So, 3→1 is a longer path.

Wait, so the correct shortest path is 4→3→2→0. So, that's path C.

Wait, but wait, let me think again: Starting from 4, level 0.

Process 4's neighbors: 3 and 1 (level 1).

Process 3: its neighbors are 2 and 4. 4 is already visited, so 2 is added to level 2.

Process 1: its neighbors are 2 and 4. 4 is visited, so 2 is added again to level 2.

So, level 2 nodes are 2. Now, process 2's neighbors: 0 and 3. 3 is already in level 1, so 0 is added to level 3.

So, the first time 0 is processed is in level 3. So, the shortest path is 4-3-2-0. So, option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, what about the option A: 4-3-1-0. That would require going back from 3 to 1. But in BFS, the first time a node is visited is via the shortest path. So, the path 4-3-1-0 would have 3 edges, but the path 4-3-2-0 is also 3 edges. But the BFS would process 3's neighbors, and the first time 2 is added is via 3, not via 1.

Wait, no. Let me think again: when processing node 3, it's neighbors are 2 and 4. So, 2 is added to the queue. Then, when processing node 1, it's neighbors are 2 and 4. So 2 is added again. So, the queue now has 2 (from 3) and 2 (from 1). So, the next node to process is 2, which is the first time, so it's level 2.

So, processing 2, it's neighbors are 0 and 3. 3 was already in level 1, so 0 is added to level 3.

So, the order of processing is 4 (level 0), 3,1 (level 1), 2 (level 2), 0 (level 3).

So, the first time 0 is processed is via 4→3→2→0. So, the path is [4,3,2,0] which is option C.

Thus, option C is the correct shortest path.

Wait, but let me confirm. The BFS approach: for each node, when you visit it, you process all its neighbors. So, the first time a node is visited is via the shortest path.

So, when 3 is processed, 2 is added. When 1 is processed, 2 is added again. But when 2 is processed, 0 is added. So, the first occurrence of 0 is via 4→3→2→0, which is path C.

So the correct answer should be option C: [4,3,2,0].

To determine the shortest path from node 4 to node 0 in the given undirected graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). The BFS algorithm explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path is found.

### Graph Structure:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Edges: 0-2, 2-1, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1.

### BFS Steps:
1. **Level 0 (Start at node 4):** Queue = [4].
2. **Level 1 (Neighbors of 4):** Add nodes 3 and 1. Queue = [3, 1].
3. **Level 2 (Neighbors of 3 and 1):** Both 3 and 1 connect to 2. Add node 2 to the queue. Queue = [1, 2].
4. **Level 3 (Neighbors of 2):** Node 2 connects to 0. Add node 0 to the queue. Queue = [1, 2, 0].
5. **Level 4 (Neighbors of 0):** Node 0 has no unvisited neighbors. Queue becomes empty.

### Shortest Path Identification:
- The first occurrence of node 0 is via the path 4-3-2-0, which is 3 edges long.
- Other possible paths, like 4-1-2-0, are also 3 edges long but are not the shortest since BFS ensures the first visit is the shortest path.

### Correct Path:
The shortest path from 4 to 0 is **4-3-2-0**, corresponding to option **C**.
