Question:

A dentist has noticed that about two children in every seven whom he sees professionally develop cavities before they turn 10 years old. Last week he examined the teeth of five unrelated children younger than 10. Let X be the number of children who develop cavities before turning 10. Which of the following gives the probability that at least one will develop a cavity before turning 10?

Options:

A: P(X = 3 out of 5)
B: P(X = 0)
C: P(X = 7 out of 10)
D: P(X = 1)
E: 1 – P(X = 1)
F: P(X = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
G: P(X = 2 out of 7)
H: P(X = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
I: 1 – P(X = 0)
J: P(X = 2 out of 5)

Okay, so I've got this probability question here about a dentist seeing children and their chances of developing cavities. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that about two children in every seven seen professionally develop cavities before turning 10. So the probability of a child developing a cavity is 2/7. Wait, or is it 2 out of 7 in each group he examines? So each time he looks at a child, there's a 2/7 chance they'll have a cavity by then. 

He examined five unrelated children last week, and we're looking at the number X of those who develop cavities before 10. So this sounds like a binomial probability problem because each child is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: either they develop a cavity or they don't. 

The question is asking for the probability that at least one will develop a cavity. So, "at least one" means X is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. But wait, the options don't all cover that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A is P(X=3 out of 5). That's the probability that exactly 3 out of 5 children develop a cavity. Similarly, option E is 1 – P(X=1), which is the probability that at least one doesn't develop a cavity. 

Wait, no. Let me think. The probability of at least one is the complement of none. So, P(at least one) = 1 – P(none). So if none have a cavity, then X=0. So 1 – P(X=0) would be the probability that at least one child does have a cavity. 

Wait, but let me make sure. If he's seeing five children, the probability that none develop a cavity is (5/7)^5, because each has a 5/7 chance of not developing a cavity (since 1 - 2/7 = 5/7). 

So, the probability that at least one does develop a cavity is 1 minus the probability that none do. So that's 1 – P(X=0). So looking at the options, option E is 1 – P(X=1). That can't be right because 1 – P(X=1) is the probability that none have a cavity, not at least one. 

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. 

The question is asking for the probability that at least one child has a cavity. So, that's the same as 1 minus the probability that none have a cavity. So 1 – P(no one has) = 1 – P(X=0). So option E says 1 – P(X=1), which isn't correct. 

Wait, no. What's X? X is the number of children who do develop a cavity. So P(X=0) is the probability none do. So 1 – P(X=0) would be the probability that at least one does. So the correct expression for the probability of at least one is 1 – P(X=0). 

Looking at the options, option E is 1 – P(X=1), which is not what I want. Option I is 1 – P(X=0), which is correct. 

Wait, but wait. Let me see the options again. Oh, option A is P(X=3) out of 5. Option E is 1 – P(X=1), which is incorrect. Option I is 1 – P(X=0), which is correct. So the correct answer would be option I.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. What about the wording of the question? It says, "the probability that at least one will develop a cavity before turning 10." So yes, that's the same as 1 – P(no one does). So 1 – P(X=0). So option I is correct. 

But wait, let me look again. Option E is 1 – P(X=1). So that's the probability that none have a cavity. So E is incorrect for the desired probability. So the correct answer is option I. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is P(X=2,3,4,5,6,7). That doesn't make sense because X is the number of successes (cavities), and the dentist examined five children. So X can be 0,1,2,3,4,5. So H is for more than 5, which isn't possible. So that's incorrect. 

Option F is P(X=1,2,3,4,5). That is the probability that at least one does, but it's the sum of all possibilities from X=1 to X=5. So F is the same as the desired probability, but it's not presented as an option. The options are individual probabilities, not the sum. So the correct probability is 1 – P(X=0), which is option I. 

Wait, but wait again. What is the question exactly asking? It says, "at least one will develop a cavity before turning 10." So that's P(X >=1). Which is 1 – P(X=0), which is option I. 

So the answers are:

I: 1 – P(X=0) → Yes, this is correct.

E: 1 – P(X=1) → No, because that's P(X=0).

Wait, E is the probability that none develop a cavity (since X=1 means one does, so none don't). So E is incorrect for the desired probability.

So the correct answer is option I.

The question is about finding the probability that at least one child out of five examines develops a cavity. This is the complement of the probability that none develop a cavity. 

- **Option A** and **E** target specific numbers (3 and 1, respectively), so they are incorrect for the required probability.
- **I** correctly identifies the expression as 1 – P(X=0), which is the correct probability for at least one cavity.
- **F** and other options either target multiple values or incorrect scenarios (e.g., X=1 to X=5).

The correct answer is **I: 1 – P(X=0)**.

Answer: I
